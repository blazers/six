<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sebright, Sir  John Saunders</span>, seventh baronet  (1767&#150;1846), <span class="occ">politician and agriculturist</span>, was born in Sackville Street, Westminster, London, on 23 May 1767, the elder son of Sir John Sebright, sixth baronet (<i>bap</i>. 1725, <i>d</i>. 1794), MP for Bath (1761&#150;80), and Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1812/13), daughter of Edward Knight of Wolverley, Worcestershire. The family, originally from Essex, had settled in Worcestershire in the fourteenth century, and the baronetcy was conferred on Edward Sebright of Besford, Worcestershire, in 1626. From the late seventeenth century, when Sir Edward Sebright, third baronet, married Anne Saunders, the heir of Beechwood, near Hemel Hempstead, their main residence and sphere of influence shifted to Hertfordshire.<br>
<br>After attending Westminster School, Sebright entered the army in 1785, but retired, as a lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards, on succeeding his father in the title and estates in February 1794. On 6 August 1793 he had married Harriet (<i>d</i>. 1826), the daughter and heir of Robert Croftes of Harling, Norfolk; they had one son, Thomas Gage Saunders Sebright (1802&#150;1864), Sebright's successor as eighth baronet, and eight daughters, of whom five died in their father's lifetime.<br>
<br>Nothing came of a notion of Sebright's standing for parliament at Bath in 1789. At the general election of 1807 he stood for Hertfordshire, which his uncle Sir Thomas Saunders Sebright, fourth baronet, had represented from 1715 to 1736. He came in unopposed, as he did at the next six general elections. At the seventh, in 1832, when he was persuaded to defer his intended retirement, he was returned at the head of the poll. He retired at the dissolution in 1834. In seeking Lord Spencer's support in 1807 he declared that he was &#145;not devoted to any party&#146; and would &#145;always consider myself at liberty to act as I may think proper&#146;  (Sebright to Earl Spencer, 26 April 1807, HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1790&#150;1820</span>, 5.117). He mostly acted up to these professions in the Commons, where he was a frequent and sometimes tiresome speaker, fond of proclaiming his virtuous independence. As a sincere and steady supporter of religious toleration, particularly Catholic emancipation, and of parliamentary reform, and a critic of excesses in public expenditure, he more often than not sided with the Foxite whig opposition until late 1830, but they could not take his support for granted, especially on questions of law and order, on which he could be an alarmist. He favoured relaxation but not drastic revision of the corn laws, and was a consistent advocate of reform of the game and usury laws. In a deliberate departure from his usual practice of studied neutrality, he declared his support for Canning's ministry in May 1827; but a year later, with typical perversity, he voted against the financial provision for Canning's widow and family. On 1 March 1831 he broke the &#145;dead silence&#146; which had fallen on a stunned house at the close of Lord John Russell's speech detailing the Grey ministry's <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> by seconding the motion for leave to introduce it and giving it his personal blessing  (Aspinall, 13). Both inside and outside parliament he was a zealous supporter of reform during the following fifteen months, although later in March 1831 he published a short letter entitled <span class="italic">County Reform</span>, in which he expressed misgivings about the effect of enfranchising tenants with short leases. He had similar anxieties about the susceptibility to landlord influence of the tenants-at-will enfranchised by the Chandos amendment, but he accepted that the enactment of reform was the paramount consideration. On 4 February 1832 he belatedly joined Brooks's Club, thereby signifying his final adherence to the whigs. An improving agriculturist, with a deep interest in and love of animals, he published works entitled <span class="italic">The Art of Improving the Breeds of Domestic Animals</span> (1809), <span class="italic">Observations upon Hawking</span> (1826), and <span class="italic">Observations upon the Instincts of Animals</span> (1836). Sebright, who built and endowed a school at Cheverell's Green and erected almshouses at Flamstead, Hertfordshire, died at Turnham Green, Middlesex, on 15 April 1846.<br>
<br>Sebright's oddness and bluntness made him one of the minor celebrities of the Commons. Although Brougham, nettled by his support for repressive legislation in 1818, cursed him as &#145;Jack Gabble&#146;  (Brougham to Lambton, HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1790&#150;1820</span>, 5.119), Le Marchant referred to him in 1831 as &#145;a sagacious, hardheaded man&#146;, whose &#145;opinion is generally esteemed of much weight&#146;  (Aspinall, 168). Frances Calvert, wife of his Hertfordshire parliamentary colleague Nicolson Calvert, wrote that he had &#145;some good qualities&#146; but &#145;also a great many disagreeable ones&#146;, including &#145;a violent temper&#146;  (Blake, 20). Maria Edgeworth, who described his eyebrows as &#145;prodigious natural curiosities&#146;, stayed at Beechwood in 1822:<blockquote>Sir John Sebright is one of the most entertaining characters I ever saw. He is very clever, very vain, very odd, full of fancies and paradoxes and with abilities to defend them all &hellip; notwithstanding his philosophical tenderness principles about dogs and horses &hellip; he has been violent with his children &hellip; his daughters &hellip; all look under abject awe of him &hellip; They all have dogs faces &hellip; They do not seem to live happily together and in the midst of luxuries and fine house and park this perception chills their guests. (<span class="italic">Letters from England</span>, 325&#150;6)</blockquote>
