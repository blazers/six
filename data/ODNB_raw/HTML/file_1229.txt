<span class="headword">Ballantyne,  James Robert</span>  (1813&#150;1864), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born on 13 December 1813 in Kelso, Roxburghshire, the eldest son of Alexander Thomson Ballantyne (1776&#150;1847), newspaper owner, editor, and printer in Edinburgh, and his wife, (Anne) Randall Grant (<i>c</i>.1786&#150;1855). Alexander Ballantyne was a younger brother of James Ballantyne (1772&#150;1833), Sir Walter Scott's publisher. One of James Robert's brothers was the author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1232/', "Robert Michael Ballantyne")</script>.<br>
<br>Ballantyne was educated at Kelso grammar school, Edinburgh (New) Academy (1824&#150;7), and Edinburgh College, where he began to study oriental languages. He continued this at the East India College, Haileybury (1829&#150;32), under his uncle, Major James Michael, professor of Hindu literature, and Francis Johnson, professor of Sanskrit. Ballantyne published his first book, <span class="italic">A Grammar of the Hindustani Language</span>, in 1838, and the following year he was appointed to teach Hindi and Sanskrit at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy, Edinburgh. In 1845 he was made an LLD by Glasgow University.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the government of the North-Western Provinces of India had decided to add English literature and science to the Sanskrit syllabus of the Government College, Benares. On the recommendation of Horace Hayman Wilson, Boden professor of Sanskrit at Oxford and librarian to the East India Company, the company's court of directors appointed Ballantyne principal of the college in 1845 to supervise the reorganization. As principal (from 1856 also professor of moral philosophy), his task was to bring the Sanskrit students to appreciate European thought and ways without losing the influence among their countrymen which was based on their mastery of the traditional learning of India. His tact, broad-mindedness, and genuine respect for the best in Hindu thought enabled him to succeed by winning their trust; he described his methods and approach to Indian traditions in the introductions to his <span class="italic">Synopsis of Science in Sanskrit and English</span> (1852) and <span class="italic">The Bible for the Pandits</span> (1860). These were the two most notable of a number of works, designed primarily for his Benares pupils, in which he aimed to adapt the Sanskrit philosophical vocabulary so that it could express European concepts, and which also included a version (1852) of Francis Bacon's <span class="italic">Novum organum</span>.<br>
<br>Ballantyne published several English translations of Hindu philosophy (especially the aphorisms of the Nyaya, Sankhya, and Vedanta schools) and of Indian linguistics (notably the <span class="italic">Mahabhashya</span> (1856), Patanjali's &#145;great commentary&#146; on the classic grammar of Panini), besides European-style grammars of Sanskrit, Hindi, Maratha, and Persian. These were intended to make Indian thought more accessible to Europeans, whom he hoped to dissuade from their tendency to scorn or distrust Indian achievements.<br>
<br>Ballantyne's first wife was Violet Roberton (1811&#150;1847), like him a native of Roxburghshire. They married in Edinburgh on 20 November 1844, and had two children: Alexander John Ballantyne (1845&#150;1878), who was born at sea on the voyage to India and later became a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and Elizabeth Roberton Ballantyne (1847&#150;1916), born at Benares, who became a teacher of languages. His second wife was Annabella Georgiana Monck Mason (1830/31&#150;1915), daughter of Captain Thomas Monck Mason RN, of Enniskerry, co. Wicklow, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grey. The political agent in India, George Henry Monck Mason of the Bengal army, was her elder brother. She and Ballantyne married at Keroby, Rajputana, on 9 February 1854, and had three children: Violet Annabel Ballantyne (<i>b</i>. 1855 in Benares), Katherine Gordon Ballantyne (1857&#150;1907), born in Calcutta, and George Monck Mason Ballantyne (1859&#150;1889), born in Edinburgh. Ballantyne's health began to fail in India, and in 1861 he resigned from the college and returned to Britain. He served as librarian to the India Office until his death on 16 February 1864, at his London home, 14 Bessborough Street, Pimlico. He was buried at Kensal Green. The following year his widow, Annabella, married Edward George Jenkinson (1835&#150;1919), deputy collector of Benares. They had several children in India and returned to Britain in 1879; after serving as assistant under-secretary for police in Ireland he was knighted in 1888.<br>
