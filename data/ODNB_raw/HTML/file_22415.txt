<span class="headword">Plunket,  William Conyngham</span>, first Baron Plunket  (1764&#150;1854), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Ireland</span>, born at Enniskillen, co. Fermanagh, on 1 July 1764, was the fourth and youngest son of Thomas Plunket, a Presbyterian minister of Enniskillen, whose father also was a zealous minister of the same denomination. His mother, Mary, was the daughter of David Conyngham of Letterkenny, Donegal. The father, who was educated at Glasgow, was transferred from Enniskillen to Dublin, where in 1768 he was appointed the colleague of the Revd Dr Moody in the ministry of the Strand Street Chapel. In 1778 he died, leaving his widow ill-provided for; and it was only by the support of the Strand Street congregation that she was able to bring up and educate her children.<br>
<br>William Plunket attended the school of the Revd Lewis Kerr, and became familiar with Barry Yelverton (later Lord Avonmore) through a friendship with his son. In 1779 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, twice took the class prize, obtained a scholarship in his third year, and joined the historical society, where, with his friends young Yelverton and Thomas Addis Emmet, he was a frequent speaker. Fired by the example of its members Bushe, Magee, Parsons, and Wolfe Tone&#151;inspired, too, by the enthusiasm of the patriotic successes of 1782&#151;he became a leading debater, was vice-president in 1783, took the medals for oratory, history, and for composition in turn, and produced an essay in defence of the age, which the society decided to print and rewarded with a special prize. In 1784 he graduated BA, and having kept his terms at the King's Inns while at the university, he entered Lincoln's Inn and began to study law, depending for money on his mother's narrow means and on the help of friends. He returned to Dublin in May 1786, was called to the bar in 1787, and acquired a modest practice before the year was out. He practised indiscriminately in common law, equity, and criminal courts, and went the north-western circuit, which included Enniskillen. He was soon one of the leading advocates of his day. On 20 October 1790 he married Katharine, daughter of John McCausland of Strabane, then MP for Donegal, and Elizabeth Span. They had six sons and five daughters.<br>
<br>In 1797 Plunket was made a king's counsel by Lord Clare, but until 1798 he kept aloof from politics. Nor was he professionally brought into political prominence except when, on 4 July 1798, he appeared with Curran to defend Henry Sheares on trial for high treason. Early in 1798 James Caulfeild, first earl of Charlemont, offered Plunket the seat for the borough of Charlemont, once held by Grattan. At first the offer was refused, Plunket being for, and Charlemont against, the Roman Catholic claims; but it was renewed without any pledge being attached to it, and on these terms was accepted. Plunket was elected, and devoted himself to an uncompromising opposition to the projected <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>. He took his seat on 6 February 1798, and during the remainder of the existence of the Irish parliament frequently spoke in debate. He was also a contributor of witty articles to <span class="italic">The Anti-Union</span> newspaper, begun on 27 December 1798 and abandoned in March 1799. The extinction in 1800 of the Irish parliament, and with it the disfranchisement of the Charlemont borough, for a time put an end to Plunket's political ambitions, and he devoted himself to his practice and to the accumulation of a fortune. He did attempt to secure the Dublin University parliamentary seat in 1802, but was unsuccessful. He appeared for the prosecution on the trial of Robert Emmet in September 1803 for his rebellion, and was charged with having pressed with undue severity the charges and evidence against his former friend, in order to win the favour of the government. Plunket was embarrassed by rumours of his former radicalism, and by Emmet's accusation that he had inculcated popular resistance by his speeches in parliament and at the bar. By the attorney-general's special request Plunket made a speech in reply. Emmet was convicted of treason and executed. Shortly afterwards, at the end of 1803, Plunket became solicitor-general for Ireland, and was at once denounced as a renegade by Juverna in Cobbett's <span class="italic">Weekly Register</span>. In 1804 he recovered &pound;500 damages against Cobbett in an action for libel. Some years afterwards he took proceedings against the publishers of <span class="italic">Sketches of History, Politics, and Manners in Dublin in 1810</span>, for repetition of the charge.<br>
<br>In October 1805 Pitt made Plunket attorney-general, and Plunket retained that office in the &#145;ministry of all the talents&#146;. Hitherto, with official approval, he had treated the post as professional and non-political. Now it became a party and parliamentary one. He was distrusted by the Foxite whigs, but was urged by Lord Grenville to enter the House of Commons. He was accordingly, though with reluctance, elected for Midhurst early in 1807. He then became an adherent of Lord Grenville, and, though he sat only for two months before the dissolution, made his mark in debate, particularly in his advocacy of Catholic relief. Having identified himself with the whigs, he declined the request of the new tory administration that he retain the attorney-generalship.<br>
<br>Upon the dissolution Plunket was not re-elected to parliament, and for the next five years he remained in Ireland, earning both reputation and an income probably unequalled at the Irish bar. In cross-examination he excelled; he addressed juries with marked success; but it was to chancery cases that he devoted most of his time, and in them he felt most at home. Despite the offer of two successive seats in the interval, it was not until 1812 that he re-entered parliament, as member for Dublin University. The government favoured a tory candidate, but his friends Burrowes and Magee secured his unopposed return. He held the seat until he retired from parliament. He was now rich, partly from his own exertions, partly from his brother Dr Plunket's bequest to him of &pound;60,000. In parliament he generally supported Lord Grenville, but sought to model himself on the independent oppositionism of Henry Grattan, whom he greatly admired. He chiefly directed his parliamentary efforts to furthering the cause of Catholic emancipation. On 25 February 1813 he made a great speech in support of Grattan's motion for a committee on the laws affecting Roman Catholics, of which even Castlereagh declared that &#145;it would never be forgotten&#146;. His moderation and support for the royal veto over episcopal appointments did not, however, endear him to Irish Catholic activists. His next great effort was, on 22 April 1814, in favour of Lord Morpeth's motion for a vote of censure on the speaker for expressions hostile to the Roman Catholic claims. The cause of emancipation, however, which had seemed hopeful in 1813, grew more and more hopeless until 1821, and Plunket, though he spoke not infrequently, won no more oratorical victories.<br>
<br>Following the lead of Lord Grenville, Plunket supported the tory government in renewing the war against Napoleon in 1815, and in rejecting Burdett's parliamentary reform motion in 1817. He went on to denounce &#145;radical revolutionaries&#146;, and to oppose an inquiry into the Peterloo massacre in 1819, on the grounds that its proposers intended it &#145;for the degradation of public functionaries&#146;. On the introduction of the <span class="roman">Seditious Meetings Bill</span> in December 1819, he delivered a speech which satisfied Grenville and the government and offended the whigs. Brougham upbraided him for his vote, and Lord Grey was reported to have called him an &#145;apostate&#146;. He was rewarded by an assurance of security in his Dublin University seat.<br>
<br>Time, however, healed this breach with the whigs. When Grattan died in 1820, Plunket succeeded to his position as foremost parliamentary champion of Catholic emancipation. On 28 February 1821 he reintroduced the subject in a speech of which Peel said, twenty years later, &#145;it stands nearly the highest in point of ability of any ever heard in this house&#146;. He saw his emancipation bill safe through its second reading on 16 March by 254 to 243 votes, and then left its conduct to Sir John Newport; it failed to become law. His wife's death on 14 March 1821 recalled him to Ireland, and so paralysed his energies that he withdrew for some time from public and professional life.<br>
<br>In January 1822 Plunket was appointed by Lord Liverpool attorney-general for Ireland under the new lord lieutenant, Marquess Wellesley, and was sworn of the privy council. Hopes were held out to him and to the other Grenvillites who now joined Liverpool's government that something would now be done for the Roman Catholics. He believed that their cause would progress more surely with friends in the administration than if its supporters remained permanently in opposition. His situation was difficult. The Irish part of the administration had been expressly constructed on the principle of a combination of opposites; Henry Goulburn, the chief secretary, and William Gregory, the under-secretary, were evangelical anti-Catholics, O'Connell and his party were impatient for reform, and the protestant party, enraged by the replacement of the Orangeman William Saurin by Plunket, endeavoured to thwart such efforts as could be made. On the whole, Plunket discharged his duties with courage and fairness. When the grand jury of Dublin threw out the bills against the ringleaders of the &#145;bottle riot&#146;&#151;a violent protest against Wellesley's banning of Orange demonstrations in November 1822&#151;Plunket proceeded with <i>ex officio</i> informations against them, but failed to obtain convictions. Saurin then accused him of having resorted to an unconstitutional procedure, and instigated a vote of censure upon him in the House of Commons. In a house predisposed against him, he made a powerful speech refuting the charge. His difficulties in Ireland were incessant, and made worse by the informal restriction of his powers imposed by the anti-Catholic home secretary, Robert Peel. Plunket's failure to secure convictions against Catholic leaders, most notoriously in the abortive prosecution of O'Connell in 1824 for his &#145;Bol&iacute;var&#146; speech, further antagonized protestant opinion. The rise of the Catholic Association led to the introduction of a bill for its suppression in February 1825, which he supported, once assured that it would also apply to the Orange order. Though his speech in support of Burdett's <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span> on 28 February was one of his finest, still the bill was defeated in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>On Lord Liverpool's resignation in March 1827 and Canning's assumption of office, Plunket expected to become Irish lord chancellor. The king's dislike of advocates of Catholic claims denied him the office, as George IV refused to accept Lord Manners's resignation of the Irish chancellorship. Canning then offered Plunket the English mastership of the rolls, just vacated by Copley, which Plunket accepted, held for a few days, and then resigned, owing to the professional feeling of the English bar against the appointment of an Irish barrister to an English judicial post. Lord Norbury was thereupon induced to resign as chief justice of the Irish common pleas, and Plunket succeeded him, and was raised to the peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Plunket of Newton, co. Cork. His first speech in the House of Lords was made on 9 June 1827, on the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span>, the approaching success of which was now almost assured; and when it passed, in 1829, it was felt that no protestant had done more for it than he.<br>
<br>Politically, Plunket's work was now almost done, though in later years he voted and not infrequently spoke on Irish questions. On 23 December 1830 he was appointed by Lord Grey lord chancellor of Ireland. The change was not popular with the bar, as his reputation in the common pleas was that of a hasty and imprudent judge. Politically his influence was still great, and his advice was highly esteemed by successive lord lieutenants; and in 1839 he made a powerful defence of Mulgrave's administration in the House of Lords. As a judge he proved himself patient, bold, and acute; and whatever may be said of his deficiency in learning&#151;and his decisions certainly were frequently reversed on appeal&#151;his practical efficiency could not be denied. The numerous legal appointments he from time to time bestowed on his relatives excited comment, and even scandal. Early in 1839 a report was put about that he was to be replaced by Sir John Campbell, and overtures were made to him to co-operate. He refused. Lord Melbourne sounded him again in June 1841, without result. The lord lieutenant then asked for his concurrence as a personal favour to himself, and on 17 June Plunket yielded and resigned.<br>
<br>Plunket retired altogether from politics, travelled in Italy, and lived a peaceful country life at his seat, Old Connaught, Bray, co. Wicklow. At last his mental faculties failed; he died at Old Connaught on 4 January 1854, and was buried in Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin. He was succeeded in the title by his eldest son, Thomas Spen Plunket (<i>d</i>. 1866), bishop of Tuam, Killala, and Achonry.<br>
<br>Plunket was physically very strong and a keen sportsman, but indolent: he rose late, hated to put pen to paper, and left to the last moment the preparation of his cases. A deep-read lawyer he was not, but he had a tenacious grasp of principle. Conviction rather than passion, close and comprehensive reasoning rather than appeals to sentiment, were the leading characteristics of his public speaking. As a statesman, his fame rests on his service to Catholic emancipation.<br>
