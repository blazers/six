<span class="headword">Stewart,  Henry</span>, first Lord Methven  (<em>c.</em>1495&#150;1553/4), <span class="occ">courtier and administrator</span>, was the second of four sons of Andrew Stewart, second Lord Avondale (<i>d</i>. 1513), and Margaret, daughter of John Kennedy, second Lord Kennedy. Nothing is known of his early years, but in 1524 he and his brothers supported the coup by which, in the absence of the duke of Albany in France, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18052/', "Queen Margaret (1489&#150;1541)")</script> took control of the young King James V, who nominally assumed the government. Margaret had married Archibald Douglas, sixth earl of Angus, in 1514, but by this time she was estranged from him. While she was in power Henry Stewart&#151;who on 3 November 1524 was described by English ambassadors in Scotland as &#145;a young man about her, who keeps all the seals, and orders everything&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 4, pt. 1, no. 800)&#151;acted as her treasurer and chancellor, held custody of the privy seal, and was appointed principal carver to the king; his brothers also obtained posts in the royal household. Henry VIII considered Angus a more reliable English agent in Scotland than his own sister; he was scandalized by her infatuation with Stewart and objected to her plans to divorce her husband.<br>
<br>With English support Angus removed Margaret from power in 1525 and secured control of the king. As a result Henry Stewart and his brothers lost the offices and influence they had acquired, but Stewart's relationship with the queen dowager endured. In December 1527 word reached Margaret that the annulment had been granted, and in the following April Stewart became her third husband. Not long afterwards Angus compelled her to give him up, and he was placed in temporary imprisonment; but after James V made his escape from the tutelage of Angus in the summer of 1528, the queen and Henry Stewart became two of the king's chief advisers. On 17 July he bestowed on them jointly the lands of Methven, Perthshire, and Stewart was raised to the peerage with the title of Lord Methven; this was the only baronial creation of the reign. He was also made master of the artillery. Subsequently he received other grants of lands, including Cockburnspath, Berwickshire, in September 1528, Ardety, Perthshire, in January 1531, and Galashiels and Mossilie, Selkirkshire, in January 1536.<br>
<br>In 1537 the queen attempted to divorce Methven, complaining that he had squandered her revenues. It is also possible that she had discovered his affair with Lady Janet Stewart, whom he later married, but Methven persuaded the king that her real reason was a desire to remarry Angus, who had been convicted of treason in 1528 and was in exile in England. James V therefore refused to grant consent and even restrained his mother from flight into England. By 1539 Margaret and Methven were reconciled, and the latter also retained the favour of the king, from whom he obtained the lands of Gilgerston in Methven in July 1541. On 16 August 1540 Methven was one of the lords who sat on the assize which convicted Sir James Hamilton of Finnart of treason, and in May 1541 he was appointed to replace Finnart as sheriff of Linlithgow. Queen Margaret died on 18 October 1541, and before 5 June 1545 Methven had a new wife, his mistress of some years, Lady Janet Stewart. She was the daughter of John Stewart, second earl of Atholl, and successively the widow of Alexander Gordon, master of Sutherland, and of Sir Hugh Kennedy of Girvanmains. They had four children, all of whom were born before the marriage and were legitimated in 1551: Henry, second Lord Methven (<i>d</i>. 1572), Johanna or Janet, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1627?), and Dorothea. Methven also had another son, John, whose mother is not recorded in the contemporary accounts but is said to have been a certain Lady Leslie, married to Stewart before his liaison with Queen Margaret. In July 1537 John Stewart, son of Lord Methven, was gifted an escheat, and in February 1540 he was granted a letter of rehabilitation following his conviction for heresy. Possibly he died at the battle of Pinkie on 10 September 1547.<br>
<br>Methven served on the privy council during the minority of Mary, queen of Scots, and was associated with the attempted coup by Mary of Guise against Governor Arran in June 1544. Both Mary of Guise and Arran used Methven as an ambassador attempting to arrange peace with England in 1544 and 1545, and as master of the artillery he took a major role in the siege of Haddington in 1548. One English report even claimed that he had been captured, but if this were so, he was probably not held for long. In February 1548 and October 1551 he and his wife received confirmations of the lands of Methven under the great seal. He died some time between June 1553, when he is recorded making a payment to the crown, and 3 April 1554, when the wardship of his heir was assigned to John Hamilton, archbishop of St Andrews. His wife survived him.<br>
