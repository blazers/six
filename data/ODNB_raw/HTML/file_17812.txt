<span class="headword">Mainwaring,  Rowland</span>  (1783&#150;1862), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, born on 31 December 1783, possibly at Whitmore Hall, Whitmore, near Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire, was the second of seven children of Rowland Mainwaring (1745&#150;1817), an army officer, of Four Oaks Park, near Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, and his second wife, Jane Latham (<i>d</i>. 1809), daughter of Captain Thomas Latham RN. He probably was educated by a private tutor, and in June 1795 he entered the navy as a first-class volunteer on the <i>Jupiter</i>. He served later as a midshipman in the <i>Majestic</i> at the battle of Abu Qir Bay and in the <i>Defence</i> at the battle of Copenhagen before being promoted lieutenant of the <i>Harpy</i> in 1801. On 31 December 1810 he married Sophia Henrietta Duff (1788?&#150;1824), the stepdaughter of Captain George Tobin RN; they had nine children. By December 1810 he had served continuously throughout the decade, including four years as first lieutenant of the <i>Narcissus</i>. In his privately published autobiography, <span class="italic">The First Five Years of my Married Life</span> (1853), he wrote an interesting account of his subsequent service in the <i>Menelaus</i> and as a commander of the <i>Kite</i> and the <i>Paulina</i> seeing out the war, under the aegis of Sir Edward Pellew, chasing and blockading privateers in the Mediterranean. He moved to Bath when the war ended, and though he did not see active service again, he was promoted captain on 22 July 1830 and was placed on the list of retired rear-admirals on 27 September 1855.<br>
<br>Mainwaring's first wife died in October 1824, and he married, on 15 November 1826, Mary Ann Clark (1786?&#150;1835); they had one child, a daughter. He became very active in the community affairs of Bath, being appointed the honorary secretary of a number of charitable societies. A supporter of the Liberals in later life, on 13 October 1831 he chaired a large open-air meeting of supporters of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in Bath. An energetic man, who once set out to walk from Gosport to Bath (reaching Frome on the third day), he was also a competent artist and a friend of the marine painters Thomas Luny and George Tobin. He published an anthology of writings on painting and several accounts of the affairs of Bath. After the death of his second wife, in January 1835, he decided to settle in Mannheim, Germany. Within a short while he married, on 11 November 1836, Laura Maria Julia Walbugha Chevillard (<i>d</i>. 1891), the only child of one of Napoleon's colonels killed at Leipzig, and the adopted daughter of the baroness de Heygendorf. They had seven children.<br>
<br>In 1837 Mainwaring succeeded his first cousin, Miss Sarah Mainwaring, in the estates of Whitmore Hall, near Newcastle under Lyme, and Biddulph, Staffordshire. His daily diary, kept from 1819 until his death, records the life of an active country gentleman, justice of the peace, and deputy lieutenant of Staffordshire. He died on 11 April 1862 at Whitmore Hall from the effects of a heart attack and was buried on the 21st in the family vault in the parish church of St Mary and All Saints in Whitmore. A memorial tablet was erected in the church.<br>
