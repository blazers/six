<span class="headword">Shaw,  George</span>  (1751&#150;1813), <span class="occ">natural historian</span>, was born on 10 December 1751 at Bierton, Buckinghamshire, the younger of two sons of the Revd Timothy Shaw, vicar of Bierton. He was educated at home by his father until 1765, with a strong interest in natural history, then entered Magdalen Hall, Oxford, graduating BA on 24 May 1769, and MA three years later. He was ordained deacon in 1774 to assist his father. His continuing interest in natural history led him after a few years to abandon the church as a profession and to study medicine in Edinburgh, then at its peak as a centre for natural history and medical education. On his return to Oxford he was appointed deputy botanical lecturer. On 17 October 1787 he was admitted to the degrees of bachelor and doctor of medicine. He was unable to succeed to the botany professorship because of the conditions of its establishment, so left for London to make a career in medical practice. He rapidly became a member of the group of naturalists led by James Edward Smith, and joined with them in founding the Linnean Society in 1788. Six years later he was elected its vice-president.<br>
<br>Shaw was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1789. In 1791 he was appointed assistant keeper of the natural history section of the British Museum, and was promoted to keeper in 1807. He was responsible for organizing its collections at a time when budgetary limitations and lack of space led to their continuing deterioration. His annual burnings of those which time, insects, and rot were destroying became part of the folklore of the museum's early history. He retained the post until his death.<br>
<br>Shaw had a tenacious memory, wrote Latin with facility, elegance, and purity, and sometimes lapsed into poetry. He delivered a series of twelve popular lectures on zoology at the Royal Institution in 1806 and 1807 (published in 1809). He was an indefatigable worker, and in his <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions Abridged</span> (18 vols., 1809) dealt with all the papers on natural history, nearly 1500 in number, inserting the Linnaean names of the species and adding references to later works.<br>
<br>Shaw was more a popularizer than a naturalist. Subscribing to the Linnaean method of classification, he brought to the attention of an expanding lay audience for natural history the more remarkable novelties not only in such collections as the Leverian Museum, with which he had a working association, but also from the recently settled Australia with which he became familiar as the editor of the natural history appendix to J. White's <span class="italic">Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales</span> (1790); in the latter he provided the first systematic description of the natural wonders of the new continent. His most important contribution to natural history was his <span class="italic">Naturalist's Miscellany</span> whose twenty-four volumes from 1789 until his death in 1813 consisted of a monthly series of coloured illustrations and Latin and English classificatory descriptions of the more interesting botanical and zoological novelties, such as the remarkable black swan and the egg-laying mammalian spiny anteater (echidna) and the duck-billed platypus. The materials of the <span class="italic">Miscellany</span> served as the basis for the multi-volumed <span class="italic">General Zoology</span>, begun in 1800 but left unfinished at his death. His publications were well illustrated, providing for the non-professional naturalist the description of rare specimens available in the original only to the wealthiest collector or museum. Shaw died at his residence in the British Museum on 22 July 1813.<br>
