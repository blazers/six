<span class="headword">Shipley, Sir  Charles</span>  (1755&#150;1815), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born on 18 February 1755 at Copt Hall, Luton, Bedfordshire, the son of Richard Shipley, of Stamford, Lincolnshire, and of Copt Hall, a cavalry captain, and his wife, Jane, the daughter of Robert Rudyerd, of Wormley, Hertfordshire. The latter was great-grandson and representative of Sir Benjamin Rudyerd (1572&#150;1658) of West Woodhay, Berkshire. On the death of Shipley's mother's only brother, Captain Benjamin Rudyerd of the Coldstream Guards (who was aide-de-camp to Lord Stair at the battle of Dettingen, and whose various accomplishments were celebrated by Smollett in the <span class="italic">Memoirs of a Lady of Quality</span> as those of Mr R&#151;), his mother became sole heir of the families of Maddox and Rudyerd, but, owing to his father's extravagance, Charles Shipley inherited little.<br>
<br>On 1 April 1771, after a period at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Shipley, aged sixteen, was commissioned ensign and practitioner engineer. In 1772 he went to Minorca. On 4 March 1776 he was promoted lieutenant and sub-engineer. He returned to England in 1778, and was stationed at Gravesend as engineer on the staff. In Gravesend, in May 1780, he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1820), the daughter of James Teale and his wife, Mary, the daughter of Dr Ralph Blomer, prebendary of Canterbury. They had three daughters.<br>
<br>From 1780 to 1783 Shipley reportedly served in the Leeward Islands, and in 1788 he went to the West Indies and was stationed at Antigua. Early in 1792 he returned to England to be court-martialled for disobedience to regulations in employing his own slaves in Antigua on government fortification work. The court sat at the Horse Guards from 23 February to 1 March, found Shipley guilty, and sentenced him to twelve months' suspension from rank and pay, but stated that his conduct did not stem from any corrupt motive.<br>
<br>On 15 August 1793 Shipley was promoted captain. At the request of Sir John Vaughan, commander-in-chief in the West Indies, he again applied to be sent thither, and embarked in November with his family in the government storeship <i>Woodley</i>. After leaving Plymouth severe storms compelled them to put into Gibraltar and Cadiz for some weeks, and when at length they arrived within a few miles of Barbados they were captured by the French corvette <i>Perdrix</i>. The prisoners were confined in hulks at Guadeloupe, and suffered great hardships; but Shipley's wife was set free, and eventually managed to obtain the liberation of her husband from the notorious French republican commander Victor Hugues.<br>
<br>Shipley was promoted major in the army on 6 May 1795. In May 1796 he sent home reports on the defences of Martinique and of Prince Rupert's Head, Dominica, and on 20 October that year he was appointed commanding royal engineer of the Windward and Leeward Islands. In February 1797 he accompanied Sir Ralph Abercromby as commanding royal engineer of his expedition to Trinidad; the Spaniards surrendered the island on the 17th. He also accompanied Abercromby as commanding royal engineer, and took part in the unsuccessful attack on Puerto Rico in April. The British failed to capture San Juan, and re-embarked. This marked the end of the British offensive expeditions to the Caribbean: &#145;the heyday of Caribbean warfare was over&#146;  (Duffy, 291). On 11 September 1798 Shipley was promoted lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Engineers.<br>
<br>In 1799 Shipley was sent by Lieutenant-General Thomas Trigge in the <i>Amphitrite</i> to examine the coasts in the neighbourhood of the Surinam River for a landing-place to attack Surinam. Trigge, in his dispatch (22 August 1799), stated that Shipley acted with great zeal and judgement. Surinam surrendered on 20 August but was soon retaken. Shipley also took part, during March, in the capture of the islands of St Bartholomew, St Martin, and St Thomas, and of Santa Cruz. On 21 and 22 June 1803 he commanded a detachment of infantry at the capture of St Lucia. In April 1804 an expedition was sent under Brigadier-General Charles Green, temporarily commanding in chief in the Leeward Islands, against Dutch Guiana. Shipley accompanied it as commanding royal engineer, and, having landed with Lieutenant Arnold of the Royal Engineers and a small party, reconnoitred the defences of Surinam, which was again captured. Green, in his dispatch to Lord Camden, dated 13 May 1804, admitted obligations to Shipley, as commanding engineer, &#145;far beyond my power to express&#146;.<br>
<br>On 13 July 1805 Shipley was accordingly promoted colonel in the Royal Engineers, and on 12 June 1806 brigadier-general to the forces serving in the West Indies. In that year, under orders from the Board of Ordnance, he made the circuit of the coast of Jamaica and explored the interior with a view to a survey. In 1807 he accompanied the expedition from Barbados against the Danish West Indian islands under General Bowyer and Rear-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane. They arrived before St Thomas on 21 December, when Shipley was sent ashore to demand from the governor, von Scholten, the surrender of St Thomas and St John, which capitulated the next day. On 23 December the expedition sailed for Santa Cruz, and Shipley was again sent on shore to negotiate terms. The governor would capitulate only if some of his officers were allowed to inspect the British ships and troops and satisfy his honour that the British force was so strong that resistance would be hopeless. Shipley agreed, and the island capitulated on 25 December 1807.<br>
<br>On 22 March 1808 Shipley was knighted, and in that same year he sent home proposals for strengthening the defences of the island of St Thomas. In January 1809 he took part in the expedition against Martinique under Lieutenant-General Sir George Beckwith. He landed on 30 January and began operations against Pigeon Island, admirably supported by Captain George Cockburn (1772&#150;1853) of HMS <i>Pomp&eacute;e</i> and his sailors. The night after the batteries opened fire the enemy surrendered, and Pigeon Island fell to the British on 4 February, followed by Fort Bourbon and Fort Royal, and on 23 February by the whole island of Martinique. Shipley received the thanks of both houses of parliament.<br>
<br>In February 1810 Shipley commanded the 2nd division of the army in the successful operations against Guadeloupe. Brigadier-General Harcourt, in his dispatch of 7 February, expressed his indebtedness to Shipley during the operations, and especially in the action of 3 February at Ridge Beaupaire, St Louis, in front of Bellair.<br>
<br>Shipley was promoted major-general on 4 June 1811. On 27 February 1813 he was appointed governor of the island of Grenada. His administration was reportedly mild and just, and he dispelled those party feuds to which small colonies were prone.<br>
<br>After Bonaparte's return from Elba, a naval and military expedition, under Admiral Sir Philip Durham and Lieutenant-General Sir James Leith, was sent to secure the French West Indian islands for Louis XVIII, from whom they had revolted, and in June 1815 Martinique and Marie Galante were reoccupied without trouble. Guadeloupe, however, held out for Bonaparte (by then a British prisoner sailing to St Helena), and did not yield without fighting&#151;the last between Bonaparte's troops and the allies. The British attacked on 8 and 9 August 1815, and Shipley commanded the 1st brigade. The enemy were defeated with few British casualties. Following negotiations, on 10 August Guadeloupe surrendered. Both naval and military commanders in their dispatches highly praised the &#145;distinguished and indefatigable engineer&#146; Sir Charles Shipley. He received, by the command of the prince regent, a medal for Martinique with a clasp for Guadeloupe.<br>
<br>A skilful engineer and soldier, Shipley in July 1815 declined promotion out of the corps of Royal Engineers, of which he was senior regimental colonel, preferring to wait for his battalion. Ever careless of personal exposure, excessive fatigue at the attack on Guadeloupe apparently brought on an illness which ended in his death, at St George, Grenada, on 30 November 1815. He was buried in the church of St George's, Grenada.<br>
<br>His widow died at Boulogne (where she was granted a residence by Louis XVIII for her husband's services in the French West Indies) on 6 August 1820. Their youngest daughter, Elizabeth Cole (<i>d</i>. 1828), married in 1809 Henry David Erskine, twelfth earl of Buchan.<br>
