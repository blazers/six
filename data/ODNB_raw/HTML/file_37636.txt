<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kinloch,  George, of Kinloch</span>  (1775&#150;1833), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 30 April 1775 in Dundee, the younger son (there were no daughters) of Captain George Oliphant Kinloch of the 53rd regiment of foot, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Colonel John Balneavis. Captain Kinloch had inherited the estate of Kinloch in Strathmore from his younger brother, John, who had purchased it from the proceeds of a fortune made as a sugar planter in Jamaica, and had died in 1770. Captain Kinloch himself died in 1775 and his widow in 1782.<br>
<br>John, their elder son, was a permanent invalid, and for the sake of his health the boys were sent abroad to France and Italy. John died in Nice in 1789, and George returned to Scotland in 1791. He studied at Edinburgh University during 1791&#150;2 but did not graduate. He became laird of the Kinloch estate on his twenty-first birthday in 1796. In the same year he married his cousin Helen, daughter of John and Joanna Smyth, and between 1797 and 1805 they had six daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>In 1797, as part of his duties as a young laird, Kinloch was appointed to command the Coupar Angus company of the volunteers, territorials who were recruited to meet the danger of a possible French invasion, but in Scotland confined their activities to suppressing riots aroused by the <span class="roman">Militia Acts</span> and the press-gangs. Eleven years later, in 1808, Kinloch decided that he was opposed to the maintenance of a standing army in time of peace and resigned his commission. In 1812 he attacked the war in Spain: &#145;we have been fighting for a worthless king, an insolent nobility and a useless clergy&#146;. In addition to his burgeoning radicalism, he was a progressive landlord, and the only landlord of consequence in Scotland who supported the radical reform movement in the early nineteenth century. He took his part in local politics as a JP and was active in working for the development of Dundee harbour as a member of the Dundee Harbour Board. In 1817 he spoke in Dundee in support of annual parliaments and universal suffrage.<br>
<br>As a result of the Peterloo massacre in Manchester in August 1819, Kinloch, who from his youth in France had held liberal views, became actively opposed to the oppressive measures enforced by the authorities acting under the orders of the tory government. He agreed to preside over a public meeting of the people of Dundee to be held on 10 November 1819 to protest against &#145;the unprovoked, cruel and cowardly attack made on the people of Manchester&#146; and &#145;to suggest the means most likely to lead to a reform of abuses&#146;. The meeting was held as advertised and Kinloch addressed it in a wordy speech in which, after pleading with his audience to keep the peace, he criticized the government for excessive taxation, and declaimed: &#145;In short, the whole of our misfortune as a nation, the whole of our misery, the whole of our distress, can be clearly traced to the circumstances of the people being deprived of their share of the British Constitution by not having a voice in the election of persons to represent them in the House of Commons.&#146; The speech was reported in the <span class="italic">Dundee Advertiser</span>.<br>
<br>Two weeks after the meeting Kinloch was astounded to be confronted with a warrant for his arrest on a charge of sedition, issued on the authority of the Home Office in London. He was allowed bail, but after consulting his lawyers, Henry Cockburn and Francis Jeffrey, he was convinced that it was highly probable that he would be convicted for sedition and sent to Botany Bay. He decided that he had no alternative but to flee abroad. He reached Paris on 24 December, two days after having been declared an outlaw in the High Court.<br>
<br>For the next three years (1820&#150;22) Kinloch lived in exile in France. In January 1822 Robert Peel became home secretary and in October the leader of the Peterloo riot was released from prison. Hoping that, in the changed climate of opinion in England, he would soon be granted a pardon, Kinloch returned secretly to London, where for some time he remained under cover until early in 1823, when he made a clandestine return to Scotland. Then, in May 1823, the hoped-for pardon arrived and he was able to resume a normal life at Kinloch.<br>
<br>Dundee was one of the new constituencies created by the 1832 <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>. Kinloch stood as the whig candidate in the election that followed, and in December of that year was elected the first MP for the borough. He took his seat in the house in February 1833, but did not enjoy his position for long as, in the following month, he caught a chill and died in London on 28 March 1833.<br>
