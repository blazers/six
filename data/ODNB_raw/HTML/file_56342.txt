<span class="headword">Jay,  (Arthur) Osborne Montgomery</span>  (1858&#150;1945), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and social commentator</span>, was born on 14 April 1858 at Landour, north India, the second son of the Revd William James Jay and Harriet, daughter of Martin Rawling of St Ives, Huntingdonshire. His parents had married in 1850 just as William was about to take up a position as chaplain to the Bengal establishment, which he held until his return to England in 1860. From 1860 to 1866 William was chaplain of the East India Hospital, Poplar, and Osborne's connections with the East End of London went back to his childhood. In 1865, however, William was presented to the rectory of Elvedon, Suffolk, by the maharaja Duleep Singh, and Osborne was sent to boarding-school in Leamington Spa, where he remained until about 1870. From Leamington Spa he proceeded to Eton College, and in 1876 to St Catharine's, Cambridge, in the footsteps of his brother William (who was a pensioner there from 1874 until 1878). Osborne was also admitted pensioner on 1 September 1876 and took his BA in 1880. In 1881 he was ordained deacon in the diocese of London. Later Osborne remembered that he became curate of &#145;the mother church of East London, Old Stepney&#146;, which was Holy Trinity, Stepney, in that same year. In 1882 he took priest's orders and in 1883 became an MA of the University of Cambridge.<br>
<br>From 1883 until 1886 Jay was in charge of a college mission in Stepney. He described in one of his books  (<span class="italic">Life in Darkest London</span>, 1891, 12) how &#145;on the closing of this enterprise [he was] living in a dismal street near Ratcliff Highway, close to the famous &#147;Tiger-Bay&#148;, drawing a stipend from the Bishop of Bedford's Fund &hellip; and looking for fresh opportunities of work&#146;. Then the bishop of London offered him the living of Holy Trinity, Shoreditch, with &pound;200 a year and a deal &#145;of hard work to be done, and that for many years to come&#146;. In December 1886 Jay accepted the living, which was on the boundary between Shoreditch and Bethnal Green. Within the parish was the notorious Old Nichol. When Jay entered the parish there was no church building; instead services were held in the loft of a stable. He was supported by a grant from Magdalen College, Oxford. Within ten years he had raised &pound;25,000 to build a church, social club, lodging house, and gymnasium. He campaigned (successfully) for the London county council to demolish the slums of the Old Nichol and replace them with an estate of model dwellings (known as the Boundary Street estate). Jay was much annoyed that the former slum dwellers were not rehoused in this estate but were forced to move themselves and their slums elsewhere. When he read Arthur Morrison's <span class="italic">Tales of Mean Streets</span> (1894) he promptly wrote and invited the novelist to come and live in the parish and experience at first hand the life of the Old Nichol, which contrasted with the boring respectability of the mean streets. Morrison accepted the invitation, and the Old Nichol became the Jago of his novel <span class="italic">Child of the Jago</span>; in the novel the character of Father Sturt was modelled closely upon Jay. Jay told his own story in three books, <span class="italic">Life in Darkest London</span> (1891), <span class="italic">The Social Problem and its Solution</span> (1893), and <span class="italic">A Story of Shoreditch</span> (1896). Jay, in other respects a humane man, advised that the criminal elements of society (the population of the Old Nichol) could not be reformed and that, therefore, they should be forcibly removed to penal settlements where they should serve life sentences and be forbidden to procreate. This, he believed, would have the effect of wiping out the strain of criminality from the British population.<br>
<br>In the late 1890s Ernest Aves commented that Jay was, with the exception of the bishop of Stepney, the &#145;best known man associated with the Church in Bethnal Green&#146;. He went on to describe Jay's ministry, which he reckoned to be successful as measured both by attendance and by the success of his clubs. In contrast to many churches, more than half of the congregation at Holy Trinity consisted of men. Aves contrasted Jay's muscular brand of Christianity and his personal appearance&#151;&#145;he looks like a prize fighter&#146;&#151;with his aestheticism and his high-churchmanship. He had never &#145;had the gloves on in his life&#146; and &#145;in his buildings he has attached very great importance, and has secured great richness in design, compactness, and great aesthetic beauty. He is a High churchman, and estimates very highly the parish system of the church of England. He thinks that one &#147;should clean ones' own doorstep&#148; and that useful work has to be concentrated in the way which strict adherence to the parochial system alone makes possible&#146;  (Ernest Aves's report on district IX, Booth Collection). In the interview upon which Aves's report was based, George Duckworth described Jay as &#145;a voluble and discursive talker&#146; and described how he had roused considerable opposition in the neighbouring parishes.<br>
<br>Jay never married and, when interviewed by Duckworth, admitted that he did not get on well with women. He remained at Holy Trinity, Shoreditch, until 1921. In that year he retired to Great Malvern, in Worcestershire, where he died of &#145;senile cerebral degeneration&#146; at his home, Thornbury, Avenue Road, on 14 January 1945.<br>
