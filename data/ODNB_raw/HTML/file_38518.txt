<span class="headword">Clark,  Hilda</span>  (1881&#150;1955), <span class="occ">physician and humanitarian aid worker</span>, was born on 12 January 1881 at Green Bank, Street, Somerset, the youngest of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46819/', "William Stephens Clark (1839&#150;1925)")</script>, shoe manufacturer and social reformer, and Helen Priestman Clark (1840&#150;1927), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3421/', "John Bright (1811&#150;1889)")</script>, politician, and his first wife, Elizabeth Priestman. The historian and campaigner for women's rights <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38517/', "Alice Clark (1874&#150;1934)")</script> was her sister. The family's wealth derived from the shoemaking enterprise, C. and J. Clark Ltd, in Street. Hilda Clark was a birthright member of the Society of Friends. She counted some noted Quaker women ministers among her forebears, while her aunt, Dr Annie Clark, was among the first women to train in medicine in Britain, and her mother and great-aunts helped to found a range of women's rights organizations from the late 1860s.<br>
<br>Hilda Clark was an athletic child, a keen gymnast and an intrepid horsewoman. Her education began at home, and was continued at two Quaker-run schools: Brighthelmston, at Birkdale in Southport, Lancashire, about 1896&#150;7, and The Mount, in York, from about 1897 to 1900. She then went on to medical training at Birmingham University, about 1901, moving to the Royal Free Hospital, London, in 1906 to complete her studies, graduating MB BS in 1908. There she met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37871/', "Edith Mary Pye")</script>, a superintendent of nurses, with whom she enjoyed a lifetime's companionship and shared endeavours in the fields of humanitarian aid and internationalism. Edith Pye later wrote of the Clark family that &#145;their Quaker faith permeated their whole existence, and their relations with the world around them&#146;  (<span class="italic">War and its Aftermath</span>, 5). Hilda Clark, like many young Quakers of her generation, was especially influenced by the Quaker summer school movement begun by John Wilhelm Rowntree. This movement sought to promote among Quakers both a greater intellectual rigour with regard to their religious faith, and a fuller engagement with contemporary social problems. Her family background ensured an active interest in public affairs, especially through her commitment to radical politics, temperance, women's suffrage, and internationalism. Her vital and energetic presence was valued by colleagues in the many causes that she pursued.<br>
<br>Clark's medical career began in 1909 with an appointment at the Birmingham Maternity Hospital. Her growing interest at this time, however, was in public health. The following year she left her hospital post to establish a tuberculosis dispensary in her home village of Street. There she provided the controversial tuberculin vaccine treatment under the guidance of Camac Wilkinson, a specialist committed to the promotion of this therapy, which offered an alternative to sanatorium treatment. Both her sister, Alice Clark, and Edith Pye were among her private patients at this time, each making a successful recovery from episodes of the disease. Hilda Clark eventually published the results of her work at the Street dispensary in 1915 in her <span class="italic">Dispensary Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</span>. In 1911 she was appointed a tuberculosis officer by the public health authorities in Portsmouth and subsequently published several articles in this field. Her advocacy of tuberculin treatment eventually proved the source of some local controversy, however, and she resigned from her post in 1913 to pursue an ambition to establish a working-class general practice in London.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of the First World War, Clark was among those who proposed that the Society of Friends undertake refugee relief work in France. She herself was among a Quaker expeditionary force sent there in November 1914, and soon she became supervisor of a maternity hospital for refugees established at Chalons. There she was joined at various times by Edith Pye and Alice Clark. Subsequently she added to her responsibilities the supervision of a convalescence home, while also spending some time in Paris each week at the headquarters of the Quaker relief effort. Eventually her own health broke down, and in 1917 she left France for recuperation in England, where afterwards she returned temporarily to her post as tuberculosis officer in Portsmouth. In 1919 Clark heard from a close family friend, General Jan Smuts, of the famine in Austria. She set off in July 1919 to investigate the need for aid, and her report led to the Quaker Austrian famine relief effort, in pursuit of which she returned to the field, administering aid from Vienna. Subsequently she toured the United States to raise funds for similar famine relief efforts in the Soviet Union.<br>
<br>In 1922 Clark's name reappeared in the medical directories after an absence of several years, though she seems never to have returned to her medical career. Instead she devoted herself to the causes of the League of Nations, the Women's Peace Crusade, and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom in which her closest friends, Edith Mary Pye and Kathleen Courtney, were also active in the inter-war period. This work took her to Geneva on a number of occasions, and also on fact finding missions in Poland, Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Turkey during the 1920s. In the 1930s she became a public speaker and broadcaster on international affairs, and worked for the relief of refugees from the Spanish Civil War through the International Commission for the Assistance of Child Refugees. She also aided refugees from Nazi Germany and from Austria through the Friends' Service Council.<br>
<br>After their home in London was bombed in 1940, Clark and her household moved to Kent, where she helped with the work of the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Families Association. Becoming increasingly disabled with Parkinson's disease, she returned to Street in 1952, where she died at her home, 4 Overleigh, on 24 February 1955. She was buried in the Street meeting-house burial-ground.<br>
