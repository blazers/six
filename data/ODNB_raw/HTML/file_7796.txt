<span class="headword">Constantine II</span> <span class="st"> [Causant&iacute;n mac Aeda]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 952), <span class="occ">king in Scotland</span>, was the son of King Aed (<i>d</i>. 878). It has been suggested that a King Dyfnwal of Strathclyde was his brother, but this is simply a misreading of an Irish source's obit of Domnall mac &Aacute;eda, king of the northern U&iacute; N&eacute;ill. Constantine succeeded as king to his cousin <a name="cosubject_7796"></a><span class="headword">Donald II</span> <span class="st"> [Domnall mac Causant&iacute;n]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 900), who was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6114/', "Constantine I (d. 876)")</script> and the first ruler to be described as &#145;king of Scotland&#146; (<i>ri Alban</i>) in contemporary record. <i>Alba</i> referred to the region over which Donald and his successors established their rule, and was probably only the area bounded approximately by the River Spey to the north, the Forth to the south, and the central highlands to the west. The title &#145;king of Scotland&#146; replaced the earlier &#145;king of Picts&#146;, and the people of the kingdom ceased to be known as Picts, and became simply &#145;inhabitants of Scotland&#146; (<i>fir Alban</i> or <i>Albanaig</i>). Since <i>Alba</i> had hitherto denoted &#145;Britain&#146; in Gaelic, this represents an extraordinary change in terminology, suggesting that the adoption of <i>Alba</i> as the kingdom's name represented the coining of a radically new identity, and perhaps signifying an attempt, following a period of disruption and uncertainty between 875 and 889, to establish a new political order based on dynastic kingship. During the reign of Donald II (889&#150;900) &#145;the Northmen wasted Pictland&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 1.395), but Donald defeated the Danes in a battle on some unidentified islands, before being killed by Scandinavians at Dunnottar, Kincardineshire. He was later reported to have been buried on Iona.<br>
<br>The long reign of Constantine II was probably crucial for the new kingdom's survival, allowing the new political order to be consolidated. It is now that mormaers (literally &#145;chief steward&#146;, the ruler of a province) are first heard of, and the first reference is found to one of a number of post-Pictish regional names associated with earls. It is possible, moreover, that Constantine was responsible for establishing St Andrews as the chief bishopric of his kingdom. If this is so, and the creation of earls and earldoms was in some sense his initiative, then it could be claimed not only that Constantine was the first king to be inaugurated as &#145;king of Scotland&#146;, but that he laid the foundations of the kingdom's political and ecclesiastical structure for the next five centuries.<br>
<br>Constantine's reign also represented a turning point in the kingdom's fortunes in its struggle for survival against Danish incursions. In 903 the grandsons of &Iacute;varr plundered Dunkeld and &#145;all Scotland&#146;, but in 904 Constantine met them in battle at an unknown location in Strathearn, in modern Perthshire, and comprehensively defeated them; there are no more recorded Scandinavian invasions for half a century. In 905&#150;6 he made an agreement at Scone with Bishop Cellach, probably the first chief bishop of &#145;Scotland&#146;, which may represent Constantine's backing for the church in an attempt to restore social order&#151;of which the creation of earldoms may have formed a part&#151;in the wake of more than sixty years of repeated invasion and worsening political instability. In the 910s Constantine went on the offensive and backed the Bernicians against Rognvald, Danish king of York, culminating in a titanic but indecisive battle in 918 (probably) on the River Tyne in Lothian.<br>
<br>The rise of the kings of Wessex changed the balance of power in Britain, however. In 920 along with other northern kings Constantine made a peace with Edward of Wessex, but he allied himself with the kings of Norse Dublin, marrying his daughter to King Guthfrith's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20670/', "Olaf")</script>. After Edward of Wessex died, Constantine made his peace with Edward's successor, &AElig;thelstan, in 927; and &AElig;thelstan may have stood as godfather for one of Constantine's sons, possibly <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14379/', "Indulf (d. 962)")</script>. In 934, however, he renewed his alliance with Dublin against &AElig;thelstan, causing &AElig;thelstan to make a fruitless invasion in retaliation. When Olaf, Constantine's son-in-law, became king of Dublin, he joined forces with Constantine and the king of Dumbarton and invaded England in 937, only to suffer a crushing defeat at the battle of &#145;Brunanburh&#146;. This may have weakened Constantine's hold on the kingship itself, for some time between 940 and 945 he relinquished it to his cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17857/', "Malcolm I")</script>, the son of Donald II, and &#145;in his old age, being decrepit&#146;, retired to St Andrews, where he may have become abbot of the C&eacute;li D&eacute;. He died at St Andrews in 952 and was buried there. In addition to his son Indulf and his daughter who married Olaf Guthfrithson, Constantine had at least one other son who, unnamed, died at &#145;Brunanburh&#146;.<br>
