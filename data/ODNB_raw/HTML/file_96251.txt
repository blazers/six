<span class="headword">Bailey,  David Roy  Shackleton</span>  (1917&#150;2005), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 10 December 1917 at School House, Lancaster, the youngest of the four children (three sons and one daughter) of the Revd John Henry Shackleton Bailey (1875&#150;1956), mathematician and headmaster, and his wife, Rosamond Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Giles (<i>d</i>. 1949). The family was a very unhappy one, which may go some way to account for &#145;the intense shyness and self-protection that many mistook for a lack of humanity&#146;  (Thomas, <span class="italic">PBA</span>, 5). He was educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School, where his father was headmaster, and where he drilled himself to read privately every day a substantial quota of Greek and Latin. He then went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. After obtaining a first class in part one of the classical tripos and part two of the oriental studies tripos he left Cambridge in 1941 for wartime service in British intelligence at Bletchley Park. On his release from war service and return to Cambridge in 1944 he was elected a fellow of Gonville and Caius College, and in 1948 was appointed university lecturer in Tibetan, a post he held until he left Cambridge in 1968. In 1955 he moved to Jesus College, as fellow and director of studies in classics, returning to Caius in 1964, first as deputy bursar and then a year later as senior bursar. On 12 December 1967 he married Hilary Ann (1928&#150;2010), the former wife of Kingsley Amis, and daughter of Sidney Leonard Bardwell, a clerical officer in the Ministry of Agriculture. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1968 Shackleton Bailey left Cambridge to become professor of Latin at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where his wife kept a fish restaurant called Lucky Jim's. Their marriage was dissolved in 1974, and in 1975 Shackleton Bailey moved to Harvard as professor of Greek and Latin; from 1982 he was Pope professor of the Latin language and literature. His academic distinctions included an honorary LittD from Trinity College, Dublin (1984), and, in recognition of his work on Cicero's letters, the Kenyon medal of the British Academy (1985), to which he had been elected in 1958. On retirement from Harvard in 1988 he returned to Michigan, and in 1994 married Kristine Zvirbulis, continuing to teach as an adjunct professor until 2002.<br>
<br>Between 1948 and 1955 Shackleton Bailey had produced a number of articles and reviews on Sanskrit and Tibetan topics, and a critical edition of two Buddhist hymns, <span class="italic">The &#346;atapan&#772;c&#257;&#347;atka of M&#257;trceta</span> (1951). These texts called for the application of sophisticated editorial techniques, an experience that he turned to account in 1975 in an examination of the analogous problems confronting the editor of classical texts (&#145;Editing ancient texts&#146;, republished in <span class="italic">Selected Classical Papers</span>, 1997, 324&#150;5). As early as 1953 he had been seriously considered for election to the Kennedy professorship of Latin; and his move to Jesus College two years later signalled a return to his original classical allegiance, which was confirmed by the publication of <span class="italic">Propertiana</span> (1956), his first book on a classical subject. This was a collection of notes on passages of critical interest in the text of Propertius which, apart from its value to future editors, was a rich source of information on Latin poetic usage. Meanwhile he had begun to publish a series of notes and articles extending over the next forty years on textual and interpretative problems in Latin writers ranging in date from Lucilius to Nigel de Longchamp, and critical editions of Latin authors including Horace, Lucan, and Martial, culminating in eighteen volumes in the <span class="roman">Loeb Classical Library</span>, a total unequalled by any other editor in the series.<br>
<br>These bilingual editions were critically important and testified also to Shackleton Bailey's gifts as a translator. Nowhere were these displayed to more effect than in his seven-volume edition of Cicero's letters to Atticus (1965&#150;70), his <i>magnum opus</i>. Of these letters he wrote: &#145;Nothing comparable &hellip; has issued out of the classical world &hellip; In Cicero's letters we see a Roman Consular, on any reasonable estimate one of the most remarkable men of his eventful time, without his toga&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Classical Papers</span>, 364). It was Cicero as a human being, &#145;sometimes petty, sometimes heroic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cicero: Select Letters</span>, 1980, 11), who fascinated him and brought out the best in him as a commentator. There was the added attraction that they posed the sort of critical and historical problems that he was pre-eminently well qualified to solve.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Propertiana</span> had been dedicated to the memory of A. E. Housman, whose unpublished edition of Propertius had been destroyed at his death in accordance with his will. Housman himself he had seen only once, at the last lecture Housman gave, shortly before his death. It was his admiration for Housman's scholarship and his relentless emphasis on accuracy as a duty, not a virtue, that focused his own approach to establishing and interpreting the texts that he edited. In one crucial respect, however, he differed from his exemplar. Manilius's <span class="italic">Astronomica</span> had offered Housman a uniquely appropriate field for the exercise of his critical talents, and his commentary is in a class of its own as a source of information on Latin usage; but for the poet himself he felt nothing but contempt. Shackleton Bailey's work on Cicero was a labour of love. Even when he was critical of his authors he was rarely dismissive. Like Housman he despised &#145;literary gush&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Classical Papers</span>, 1997, 344) and what he termed &#145;no&ouml;rrhea&#146;, the uncontrolled flow of whatever enters the interpreter's head  (ibid., 359).<br>
<br>To those who did not know him well Shackleton Bailey could seem unapproachable, but close friends found in him &#145;a true but lovable eccentric&#146;  (Luck, 3) and a lover of good food and wine. His criticism was informed by a sensibility of which his responses to poetry and music were testimony. This trait was seen most appealingly in his love of cats. The first and most beloved of many was Donum (so called because given him by a friend), to whom he dedicated his <i>magnum opus</i>; and it was reputed that his move from Jesus back to Caius had been occasioned by the college's refusal to allow him to put a cat flap in the door to his rooms. &#145;Everybody who met Shack had Shack stories&#146;, according to one of his students  (<span class="italic">Michigan Daily</span>, 12 July 2005). In his final years he suffered from Alzheimer's disease, and he died in Ann Arbor on 28 November 2005. He was survived by his wife Kristine.<br>
