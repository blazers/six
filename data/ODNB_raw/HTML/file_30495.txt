<span class="headword">Atkinson,  John</span>, Baron Atkinson  (1844&#150;1932), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Drogheda, co. Louth, on 13 December 1844, the elder son of Edward Atkinson (1801&#150;1876), physician, of Glenwilliam Castle, co. Limerick, and Skea House, Enniskillen, and his first wife, Rosetta (1809&#150;1849), daughter of John Shaw McCulloch. From the Royal Belfast Academical Institution he entered Queen's College, Galway (a constituent college of the old Royal University of Ireland); there he gained scholarships in his first three years and two senior scholarships&#151;in mathematics in his fourth year and in natural philosophy in his fifth year. He graduated with first-class honours in 1861 and in 1862 he entered as a student both at King's Inns, Dublin, and at the Inner Temple in London.<br>
<br>In 1865 Atkinson was called to the Irish bar, and in the same year took the LLB degree with honours; he became a bencher of King's Inns in 1885. On 22 March 1874 he married Rowena Jane Chute (<i>d</i>. 1911) of Tralee, co. Kerry, at Christ Church, St Marylebone, London; they had four sons.<br>
<br>Atkinson was called to the English bar by the Inner Temple in 1890, and was elected a bencher in 1906. Meanwhile his practice on the Munster circuit in Ireland was increasing and became large. In 1880, at an exceptionally early age, he became queen's counsel, and after appointment in 1889 as solicitor-general for Ireland and in 1892 as attorney-general he was sworn of the Irish privy council, also in 1892, but resigned with the fall of Lord Salisbury's administration. It was not until 1895 that Atkinson entered the House of Commons as Conservative member for Londonderry North and was once more appointed attorney-general. He continued in that office until, in 1905, he was appointed a lord of appeal in ordinary with the title of Baron Atkinson of Glenwilliam, co. Limerick, and was sworn of the English privy council. His knowledge of land and social problems in Ireland meant that his advice was highly valued by the chief secretary for Ireland, Gerald Balfour (later second earl of Balfour) in the framing and passing of the <span class="roman">Irish Land Act</span> of 1896 and the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> of 1898.<br>
<br>Atkinson was the first Irish barrister to go straight from his legal practice to the House of Lords. His appointment called forth criticism for his reputation was that of a politician rather than a judge or great lawyer. However, his subsequent career as a judge dispelled any doubts about his competence. He would never have claimed to be a profound lawyer, but was known as a powerful advocate with a keen sense of humour. He took a prominent part in the Parnell commission and seemed unshaken by pressure put on him by the coalition government of the time to resign in order to satisfy the requirements of the party leaders. He resigned his seat as lord of appeal in 1928 and died at his London house, 39 Hyde Park Gate, on 13 March 1932, predeceased by his wife and their three eldest sons. An excellent portrait, by John St Helier Lander, was left to King's Inns, Dublin.<br>
