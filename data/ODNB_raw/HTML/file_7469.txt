<span class="headword">Demaus,  Robert</span>  (1829&#150;1874), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and biographer</span>, was educated at Edinburgh University, where he was signet medallist and graduated MA on 13 February 1850. He became master of the Breadalbane School at Aberfeldy in Perthshire, and in 1856 addressed a <span class="italic">Letter to the Right Hon. Earl Granville, Lord President of the Council</span> criticizing recent regulations enacted by the committee of council on education for improving the efficiency of teachers in government schools. In the same year he was appointed principal of the grammar school at Alnwick; in 1857 he became a fellow of the Educational Institute of Scotland, and in 1858 master at the West End Academy in Aberdeen. In 1860 he was ordained deacon by the bishop of Down and Connor, and in 1862 priest by the same prelate. From 1860 to 1865 he was chaplain to Thomas George Suther, bishop of Aberdeen, and in 1865 he became senior curate of St Luke's, Chelsea, where he remained until his death. In 1869 he was also appointed principal of Whitelands Training College, an institution founded by the National Society for training school mistresses for church schools.<br>
<br>The author of a considerable number of textbooks, including <span class="italic">A Class-Book of English Prose</span> (1859) and <span class="italic">The Young Scholar's Guide</span> (1860), Demaus is best remembered for his biographies of Latimer and Tyndale. His <span class="italic">Hugh Latimer</span> appeared in 1869, a new and revised edition being published in 1881. In 1871 he issued <span class="italic">William Tyndale: a Contribution to the Early History of the English Bible</span>; a new edition, slightly revised by Richard Lovett, appeared in 1886. His work for these biographies was careful and critical. He carried out extensive research among state papers and in archives in Brussels and other Belgian towns. The subsequent publication of the <span class="italic">Letters and Papers of Henry VIII</span> added little factually to Demaus's biography of Tyndale, which remained the standard work for many years, despite its unhelpful system of referencing; even after it was superseded it continued to be regarded as a real contribution to Tyndale scholarship. Demaus died, apparently of apoplexy, at 11 St Leonard's Terrace, Chelsea, on 15 March 1874. His wife, Jane, survived him.<br>
