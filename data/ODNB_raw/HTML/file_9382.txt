</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Field,  Edwin Wilkins</span>  (1804&#150;1871), <span class="occ">law reformer and promoter of art</span>, was born on 12 October 1804 at Leamington, Warwickshire, eldest son of the Unitarian minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9397/', "William Field (1768&#150;1851)")</script> of Warwick, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilkins (1784?&#150;1848). On his father's side he was a lineal descendant of Oliver Cromwell. He was educated at his father's school in Leamington, and on 19 March 1821 was articled to the firm of Taylor and Roscoe, solicitors, of King's Bench Walk, Temple. For some years after coming to London he lived with the family of the junior partner, Robert Roscoe, to the influence of whose fine tastes he attributed much of the pleasures of his subsequent life. Edgar Taylor, the senior partner, who was a highly literary man and a campaigner for the rights of nonconformists, was also an influence. At Michaelmas term 1826 Field was admitted attorney and solicitor. He considered beginning business in Warwick, but remained in London on the advice of the legal writer James Booth (1796&#150;1880), joining his fellow clerk William Sharpe (1804&#150;1870) to form the firm of Sharpe and Field in Bread Street, Cheapside. Henry Ellwood was their first clerk. In 1835 Taylor, who was then alone, took Sharpe and Field into partnership with him. The office of the firm was long in Bedford Row, afterwards in Lincoln's Inn Fields.<br>
<br>In 1830 Field married Mary, daughter of Sutton Sharpe and sister of Samuel Sharpe, Egyptologist and biblical translator, and Daniel Sharpe, geologist. She died at Leamington in 1831, soon after the birth of her son Rogers, named after his great-uncle, the poet Samuel Rogers. In 1833 he married his second wife, Letitia, daughter of Robert Kinder, with whom he had seven children; his sons Basil and Allen followed the legal profession; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33124/', "Walter Field")</script> was a painter.<br>
<br>In 1840 Field came forward as an advocate of chancery reform, publishing a work on that subject which attracted much attention. In 1841 two of his suggestions were carried out, namely the abolition of the court of exchequer as a court of equity, and the appointment of two additional vice-chancellors. The energy with which he continued to press his views had much to do with the passing of the act of 1842, by which the &#145;six clerks&#146; and &#145;sworn clerks&#146; were abolished, and the path was opened for further improvements in the efficiency and economy of chancery proceedings.<br>
<br>In 1844 Field was in communication with the Board of Trade on the subject of a winding-up act for joint-stock companies. The act of 1848 substantially embodied the proposals contained in a draft bill laid before the legal adviser of the Board of Trade on 27 April 1846 by Field and his friend Rigge, who had formerly been in his office. As early as 1846 Field took up the question of reform in the system of legal remuneration, advocating an <i>ad valorem</i> system, with the option of special contract. He had the support of Lord Langdale, then master of the rolls, and pressed the matter on various legal societies, giving evidence on the subject in July 1851 before a committee of the House of Lords. Lord Westbury's bill of 1865, on which Field was consulted, was not passed; but the act of 1870 gave effect to his views so far as regards the option of contract. In 1861 he was appointed on a royal commission to report on the accountant-general's department of the court of chancery. The acts of 1865 for the concentration of the lawcourts were largely promoted by his exertions. He was secretary to the royal commission appointed in that year to prepare a plan for the new courts, and declined any remuneration for his services.<br>
<br>As a Unitarian, Field was naturally interested in decisions such as that taken in the House of Lords in August 1842 concerning the Hewley Trust which invalidated the title of Unitarians to any trust property created before 1813, the date of their legal toleration. Field suggested the remedy of an act of parliament, and was the mainspring of the agitation which secured the passing of the <span class="roman">Dissenters' Chapels Act</span> in 1844, making the legal toleration of unitarian opinion retrospective, and, in the case of all dissenting trusts not in favour of specific doctrines, legalizing the usage of twenty-five years. His co-religionists raised a sum of &pound;530 in acknowledgement of Field's unpaid services; he put the money towards the rebuilding of his father's meeting-house at Kenilworth. A further memorial of the passing of the act was the building of University Hall, Gordon Square (opened on 16 October 1849), towards which Field himself collected much money. In 1847 he was consulted by Robert Hibbert about a trust which he was proposing to create, with the aim of securing a higher culture in the ministry of his denomination. The provisions of the trust deed (executed on 19 July) were mainly due to Field's suggestions. He induced Hibbert to modify his original plan in favour of what became practically an endowment for research and from 1878 produced an annual series of Hibbert lectures.<br>
<br>From 1857 Field exerted himself in procuring a measure for establishing artistic copyright. He worked hard for the act of 1862, though it did not do all he desired. In reply to the thanks of the Society of Arts, he wrote that no labour he could ever give would repay his obligations to art and artists.<br>
<br>Field was an enthusiastic artist, first inspired by a Warwickshire artist, William Ryder. Early in his professional life he introduced a drawing class at the Lancastrian school, Harp Alley, Farringdon Street, London, and taught it once a week. Recuperating in Ventnor from a broken leg, he spent a long vacation sketching. From this period art was the perpetual joy of his busy life. He taught it to working men; cultivated it in the &#145;conversation society&#146; founded at his residence, Squire's Mount, Hampstead; and pursued it in successive long vacations on the Thames, at Mill House, Cleve, near Goring, Oxfordshire. His original sketches fill many folios. He greatly assisted Henry Crabb Robinson in forming the Flaxman Gallery at University College, London. In 1862 he was a member of the committee of the fine art section of the International Exhibition. In 1868 he took a leading part in framing the scheme for the Slade School of Art (opened in 1871) in connection with University College. Few things gratified him more than the token of regard presented to him in 1863 by his artist friends of the Old Watercolour Society, in the shape of a portfolio of their original drawings.<br>
<br>Field's character impressed even casual acquaintances, and accounted for the warmth and range of his friendships. All his ideals were high; and his pace and force were tremendous. His convictions were strong; equally strong was his love of independence in others. &#145;Do you believe that heresy is the salt of the earth?&#146; was a characteristic question of his. A certain bluffness of manner expressed the rapidity of his mind, without veiling his robust goodness of heart.<br>
<br>Field's death was tragic. Following the capsize of a boat on 30 July 1871 he was drowned in the Thames at Cleve-on-Thames, with Henry Ellwood, his old clerk. Both were good swimmers, but their strength had been exhausted in supporting another clerk, who could not swim and was saved. Field was buried on 4 August at the Highgate cemetery, in a vault next to that of his friend Robinson.<br>
<br>Field's publications included a memoir of Edgar Taylor, works on the practice of a solicitor, and a volume of correspondence on Anglo-American relations.<br>
