<span class="headword">Abrahams,  Barnett</span>  (1831&#150;1863), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born in Warsaw, Poland, eldest child of Abraham Susman (<i>c</i>.1801&#150;1880), known as Abraham Abrahams, and his second wife, Esther Reisel. His father, a leading authority on Jewish religious slaughter, settled in England in 1839 and was joined by his wife and son two years later. Two further sons were born in 1843 and 1844.<br>
<br>Abrahams received his early rabbinical instruction from his father and later from the chief rabbi himself, Nathan Marcus Adler. In 1849 Abrahams was admitted to the Spanish and Portuguese congregation's theological college. The elders defrayed the cost of his education at the City of London School and University College, from which he graduated BA. Abrahams married on 7 June 1854 Jane (1834&#150;1895), daughter of Abraham Rodrigues Brandon. There were six children of this marriage. Two of his sons, Joseph and Moses, became Jewish ministers, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51111/', "Israel Abrahams")</script> became an author and teacher.<br>
<br>In 1851 Barnett was invited to preach at Bevis Marks, the main synagogue of the Spanish and Portuguese community, and made a favourable impression. He became assistant <i>dayan</i> in 1854, although there was no full <i>dayan</i> at that time, and in 1856 was elected chief of the ecclesiastical court. His duties included the position of acting head of the community. He was the youngest man to act as <i>dayan</i> in the London Jewish community and the first English Jewish minister to hold a British university degree. In 1858, on the resignation of Dr Loewe as headmaster of Jews' College, London, the Jewish theological seminary, Barnett was elected his successor and became principal of the college; he continued to carry out his religious duties.<br>
<br>Barnett's chief interest was the education of the young, and he was the founder, in 1860, of the Association for the Diffusion of Religious Knowledge, the precursor of the Jewish Religious Education Board. This society provided a free sabbath school for Jewish children and distributed pamphlets on religion and history. Its first tract, entitled <span class="italic">The Lamp, the Light, and the Way of Life</span> (n.d.), was written by him.<br>
<br>Barnett Abrahams died unexpectedly, at Finsbury Square, London, on Sunday 15 November 1863, of acute rheumatism after an illness of a few days, and was buried the next day at the cemetery of the Spanish and Portuguese congregation, Mile End. The mourners were led by the chief rabbi. A daughter was born posthumously to Abrahams and his widow survived until 1895. Immediately after his death a memorial fund was opened for the benefit of his widow and children; it closed in May 1864, after just over &pound;2000 had been raised. In December 1864 a tablet was erected in his memory by the Jewish infant school, Commercial Street, by the working classes of the Jewish faith.<br>
<br>On 21 November 1863 a discourse on their founder was delivered by G. J. Emanuel to the Association for the Diffusion of Religious Knowledge. In a special service held in his memory on 22 November 1863 by A. P. Mendes on behalf of the Spanish and Portuguese congregation, it was said that as a teacher of men Abrahams was remarkable for his burning zeal. As a teacher of youth, he was patient, kind, and gentle. However, in an article published in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society</span> in 1968, Barnett's granddaughter maintained that he suffered from a violent temper and that his wife kept crockery available for him to smash to relieve his feelings.<br>
