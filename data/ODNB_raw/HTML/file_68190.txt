<span class="headword">Amy, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1621), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was the sixth son of John Amye (<i>d</i>. 1589), yeoman, of Great Abington, Cambridgeshire, and Joan, daughter of Nicholas Smith of Walden, Essex. He matriculated at Clare College, Cambridge, as a pensioner in 1564 and received the degrees of BA in 1568, MA in 1571, and LLD in 1583. He was admitted as an advocate in the court of arches on 13 October 1585, and on 3 October 1590 he entered the college of civilians at Doctors' Commons in London. In that same year he was also made an honorary member of Gray's Inn. Amy became one of the most active civil lawyers of his generation, practising in all the London ecclesiastical and admiralty courts. In 1590 he joined seven of his fellow civilians in writing &#145;Of oaths in ecclesiastical courts&#146; (LPL, MS 2004, fol. 65). One of the most significant cases in which Amy participated was the process for proving the marriage of Richard Sackville and Anne Clifford in the court of arches in 1609. He also served as a master in chancery from 1597 until his death and in that capacity defended the right of clients to sue for legacies in the court of chancery rather than in the ecclesiastical courts. Between 1609 and 1619 he was appointed to various commissions for admiralty criminal causes and commissions for policies and assurances, and in 1620 he was made a member of the court of high commission. He served frequently as a commissioner on the high court of delegates. Between 1605 and 1621 he held the position of chancellor of Worcester diocese, and by virtue of that appointment he was named to the Worcestershire commission of the peace in 1608.<br>
<br>Amy's career illustrates the upward social mobility that the most active career civilians were capable of achieving at a time when many of his colleagues were complaining about the limited opportunities they had for making a living. Amy had begun his career with a patrimony of &pound;200, but he was successful enough to acquire a substantial income and increased social status. He was able to secure a grant of arms in 1593, eight years after he began to practise in the ecclesiastical courts. He was knighted in 1619. Consequently he leased lands in Great Abington, reinforcing his connection to this locality. Amy died at the beginning of June 1621 and was buried in St Gregory, London, on the 3rd. By the terms of his will, which was proved on 5 June 1621, he appointed his wife, Elizabeth, his executor and made bequests to their son Edward and their other children, including their daughter Elizabeth, to whom he had given a sufficient portion in marriage. He also left bequests to Clare College and Doctors' Commons.<br>
