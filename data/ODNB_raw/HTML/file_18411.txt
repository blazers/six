<span class="headword">Maxwell,  Robert</span>  (1695&#150;1765), <span class="occ">agricultural improver and writer</span>, was born at Arkland, Kirkpatrick-Durham, Kirkcudbrightshire, the eldest child of James Maxwell and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Robert Neilson of Barncaillie. The Maxwells had been landowners at Arkland since the beginning of the seventeenth century, and the Neilsons, descended from the house of Craigcaffie, Wigtown, had owned Barncaillie since 1537. After receiving an education &#145;becoming his rank&#146;, Maxwell engaged in agriculture, and about 1723 he leased a farm of 130 acres, all arable, at Cliftonhall, near Edinburgh, for a rent of &pound;50. In 1728 he married Margaret, daughter of Bailie Montgomery of Edinburgh; she predeceased him, leaving six daughters.<br>
<br>Maxwell devoted himself to the improvement of agriculture, and during the first half of the eighteenth century he probably did more than any other person in Scotland to encourage the practice of new methods. He was one of the earliest and most active members of the Society of Improvers in the Knowledge of Agriculture in Scotland, which was established at Edinburgh on 8 June 1723. In 1739 he proposed to the Scottish Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge a scheme for the application of funds in their possession to the education of boys in the new principles of agriculture. The society invited him to give a full account of the uses of the root crops which he proposed to grow, and the Society of Improvers encouraged him, but the scheme fell through. Meanwhile Maxwell had taken the main share of the work of the Society of Improvers and dealt with inquiries which were sent in from all parts of the country.<br>
<br>On his own farm, Maxwell paid more attention to experiments than to making a profit, and he supervised improvements on the estates of the great land proprietors. Among those who availed themselves of his advice and assistance was John, second earl of Stair. In 1743 he published at Edinburgh a book, <span class="italic">Select Transactions of the Society of Improvers</span>. A large portion of this work stemmed from Maxwell himself, and it contained many suggestions which were then new to Scotland, such as the efficacy and the mode of burning clay or subsoil, the method of cutting seed potatoes and of planting them, and the rotation of crops and root crops, in addition to information on the agriculture and manufactures of Scotland. On the dissolution of the Society of Improvers (because of the death of nearly all its founders) Maxwell transferred his energies to the Edinburgh Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Sciences, Manufactures, and Agriculture, which took its place.<br>
<br>In 1745 Maxwell succeeded his father in the estate of Arkland, but by this time he had exhausted his resources. Like many other improvers he was better at theory than practice. He had to surrender the lease of his farm at Cliftonhall, and in 1749 he became insolvent. At the instance of his creditors Arkland was sold on 9 January 1750, for &pound;10,304, to John Coltart of Areeming.<br>
<br>After this Maxwell earned his living by acting as land valuer and supervisor of improvements, while his wife probably became a shopkeeper &#145;betwixt James's and Wardrop's Courts in the north side of the Lawn Market at Edinburgh&#146;  (advertisement in the <span class="italic">Practical Beemaster</span>, 2nd edn, 1750). Maxwell continued his efforts for the improvement of agriculture. He had tried to obtain the establishment of a lectureship in agriculture at Edinburgh University, and Lord Stair and the Society of Improvers had supported the scheme. Failing in this design, Maxwell, without the patronage of any public body, gave public lectures on agriculture in Edinburgh in 1756. His lectures, probably the first of the kind delivered in Great Britain, were attended by many of the farmers and landowners in the district, and he was strongly urged to publish them. Two of them were printed in <span class="italic">The Practical Husbandman, being a Collection of Miscellaneous Papers on Husbandry</span> (1757), much of which was copied from his <span class="italic">Select Transactions</span>. He also published a number of other works on husbandry, including one on bee keeping, entitled <span class="italic">The Practical Beemaster</span> (1747), which went through a number of editions. Maxwell died at Renfrew, in the house of his son-in-law, James King, on 17 May 1765.<br>
