<span class="headword">Phillips <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Pope]</span>,  Judith</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Doll]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1595), <span class="occ">confidence trickster and thief</span>, was a celebrated rogue who preyed on the unwary in London and southern England in the late sixteenth century. Her parentage, place of birth, and death are not known. She was married to one Pope, &#145;an honest man of a good constitution and well beloved amongst his neighbours&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brideling</span>, 5), but grew dissatisfied with their poor condition and ran away to roam southern England &#145;in the company of divers persons naming themselves Egyptians&#146;, in other words, Gypsies  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 83). She was once sentenced to death in Salisbury for her cozenage, or confidence tricks, but was pardoned. Afterwards she married John Phillips, a gun maker, who made her promise to lead an honest life, but to no avail.<br>
<br>Phillips's most spectacular crime mixed mockery with larceny according to a true crime pamphlet of the day, <span class="italic">The Brideling, Sadling and Ryding, of a Rich Churle in Hampshire</span> (1595). Working in league with two male companions Phillips hoodwinked a Hampshire farmer and his wife in the village of Upsborne. The coney catchers made enquiries about the farmer and learned that he was involved in a lawsuit; Judith then buried some coins under a hollow tree on the couple's land. With the trap in place she appeared on their doorstep. Telling them that she had magical gifts and that they were luckier than they knew, she gave them details about their lawsuit and directed them to the tree, where they dug up the planted money. When they were convinced she had second sight, she told them that she was intimate with the fairy queen and that she could make them rich if they would place their complete trust in her. Hooked, they agreed.<br>
<br>Phillips told her marks to prepare for her royal highness the fairy queen by laying out their best plate and finest linen inside the house. Then she instructed the farmer to get down on all fours and allow her to put a bridle and reins on his head and a saddle on his back. This done, she mounted him and rode him three times around the garden, while the wife looked on. Directing both of them to lie flat on the ground with their eyes closed and not to stir, she robbed them and stole away. Finally realizing his foolishness the farmer rode to Winchester and raised a hue and cry. Judith was caught and imprisoned; she was brought before Lord Chief Justice Anderson at the assizes and confessed and &#145;received such deserved punishment as the law would permit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brideling</span>, 9). She soon returned to her old ways and fell into the company of two &#145;bad-minded men&#146; who were out to swindle wealthy widows into marriage  (<span class="italic">Brideling</span>, 9).<br>
<br>An account of Phillips's <i>modus operandi</i> exists among the papers of Sir Robert Cecil. On 9 January 1595 serjeant-at-law (later lord chief justice) Thomas Fleming examined Judith Phillips and her husband, John, in Newgate prison concerning the tricking of Mrs Mascall, the well-off widow of a tripe-seller who lived at the back of St Nicholas Shambles in London. John Phillips, who was then at Crown Alley, Bishopsgate Street, was cleared of charges, but his wife was convicted. Working with an accomplice named Peters, who was bent on marrying the widow for her money, Judith Phillips forged a letter of introduction and gained her confidence. Through various ruses Phillips convinced Mrs Mascall that she was a wise woman who could work magic and that she could best advise her whom to marry. She also offered to help her find gold hidden in her house if her new friend would bring together all the gold she owned, which would draw the hidden gold to it. Pulling a fast switch Phillips managed to abscond with the widow's valuables but was arrested when she returned to the house to try for more, Mrs Mascall having discovered the switch. Phillips was whipped through the city on Valentine's day 1595. Mrs Mascall quickly became the butt of at least one pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Quest of Enquirie, by Women to Know whether the Tripe-Wife were Trimmed by Doll, Yea or No</span> (1595), which retells the scandalous detail that Phillips had trimmed a lock of pubic hair from the widow to use in her staged fortune-telling.<br>
<br>A flurry of pamphlets, broadside ballads, jigs, and plays magnified Phillips's notoriety. Fifteen years later Ben Jonson appears to have drawn on her exploits to fashion Doll Common in <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span> (1610), which features the coney Dapper prostrate before a fake fairy queen played by Doll Common, in a scene with startling similarities to the tableau of humiliation created by Phillips. Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> (1597) likewise depicts a gulled Falstaff cowering on the ground, tormented by a false fairy queen played by Mistress Quickly.<br>
