<span class="headword">Ironside,  Isaac</span>  (1808&#150;1870), <span class="occ">Chartist</span>, was born at Pool Green, Masborough, near Rotherham, on 17 September 1808, the son of Samuel Ironside, clerk at an ironworks and lay preacher at Queen Street Congregational Church. After the family moved to Sheffield in 1809, Ironside was educated at Queen Street Sunday school and the Gibraltar Street Lancasterian school. At the age of twelve he was apprenticed as a stove-grate fitter, then worked at Longden and Walker's Phoenix foundry. He continued his education at John Eadon's night school and the Sheffield Mechanics' and Apprentices' Library, and won a mathematics prize awarded by the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>. In 1833 Ironside joined the accountancy and estate business firm that his father had founded the previous year. From the 1840s he was in complete control of the business and by the end of his life he had become a wealthy and successful accountant and sharebroker, with offices at 40 Queen Street.<br>
<br>Ironside began a long career in Sheffield politics in 1830, when he moved an amendment at a whig political meeting demanding universal suffrage, the ballot, and annual parliaments. The following year he joined the Sheffield Political Union and became the unpaid campaign secretary for the local radical candidate T. A. Ward. Despite the drift of his politics, Ironside collaborated closely with middle-class Liberals in establishing the Sheffield Mechanics' Institute in 1832. However, by September 1838, when he appeared at a Chartist meeting in Paradise Square, Ironside was demanding the franchise as a prelude to the disestablishment of the church, repeal of the corn laws, nationalization of the banks, the establishment of agrarian colonies, and national education.<br>
<br>Increasingly immersed in Chartism and socialism, at a Chartist meeting in September 1838 Ironside proposed the erection of agrarian communities and, on 17 March 1839, joined Robert Owen in opening the Hall of Science, Buckingham Street. In 1840 Ironside published <span class="italic">Brindley and his Lying Braggadocio</span>, a bitter attack on the acerbic Christian controversialist John Brindley; his increasing scepticism of orthodox religion had already ensured his dismissal as honorary secretary of the mechanics' institute library the previous year. Although soon disillusioned with orthodox Owenism, Ironside retained his interest in the Hall of Science, and launched the Workers' Educational Institute there in 1847; he continued his passion for education by helping raise the new mechanics' institution on Surrey Street in 1848. That year he took his <span class="italic">Address to the French Provisional Government</span> (a fusion of Chartist and Owenite aspirations) to Paris and, returning bearded, vowed never to shave until social justice had been achieved in Britain.<br>
<br>Ironside was one of two Chartists elected to the town council in 1846 and remained a councillor until 1868, first sitting for Ecclesall ward and latterly for Nether Hallam. He built up an ultra-radical grouping, calling itself the central democratic party, which numbered twenty-two by November 1849 and which forced several debates on the <span class="roman">Charter</span> and national education. On the practical side, Ironside established a health committee and, in 1848, gained council backing for the erection of a model workhouse farm at Hollow Meadows, near Sheffield, which by 1854 had seen 22 acres of wasteland reclaimed and farmed.<br>
<br>Inspired by the works of Toulmin Smith, Ironside successfully started experiments in anarchist political education. Central to the scheme was the creation of &#145;wardmotes&#146;, local parliaments attended by interested citizens. It was through the wardmotes' approval that Ironside, as chair of Sheffield's highway board in 1852&#150;4, caused the town's streets to be paved and the first deep sewers to be laid, signalling his continued Owenite belief in environmental influences on character formation.<br>
<br>Ironside helped found the <span class="italic">Sheffield Free Press</span> in 1851 and through its pages he led the support of the controversial Russophobe ex-diplomat David Urquhart. He also published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Question; is Mr Urquhart a Tory or a Radical?</span> (1856). This lost him much local popular support and prestige, as did the opposition to his unsuccessful attempt to get Toulmin Smith elected to parliament for Sheffield in 1852. He remained involved with the foreign affairs committee (established in 1855) until his death, pressing his Urquhartist agenda and publishing <span class="italic">The Part of France and Russia in the Surrender of the Right of Search</span> in 1866. His only other work, <span class="italic">Trades Unions: an Address</span>, a defence of union rights, appeared the following year.<br>
<br>Ironside died after a long illness on 20 August 1870 at his Sheffield home, Alma Grange, Carr Road, Walkley, and was buried in Sheffield general cemetery. With his wife, Elizabeth, who died in 1867, Ironside had four daughters (including Una, who lived on at Carr Road).<br>
