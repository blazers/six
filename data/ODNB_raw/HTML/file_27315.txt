<span class="headword">Thomson,  John</span>  (1805&#150;1841), <span class="occ">composer</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27292/', "Revd Andrew Mitchell Thomson (1779&#150;1831)")</script> and his wife, Jane Carmichael (<i>d</i>. 1840), was born at Sprouston, near Kelso in the Scottish borders on 28 October 1805. Although initially trained for the law, he was brought up in a household which valued music highly. His father, who was minister of St George's, Edinburgh, contributed a number of vocal works to R. A. Smith's <span class="italic">Sacred Harmony</span> (he also secured Smith's choral expertise for St George's). The family lived at 29 Melville Street, Edinburgh, where Thomson started composing at the age of fourteen. By his mid-twenties he had projected an Arabian opera to a text by C. B. Sillery (from which one or more numbers survive), composed music for <span class="italic">The House of Aspen</span> at the Edinburgh Royal and a <span class="italic">Benedictus and hosanna</span> for voices and orchestra, and had to his credit two piano trios, as well as a piano quartet, a fine rondo for solo piano, and a number of songs. It was probably the sunny C major trio of 1825, rather than the dark obsessive G minor trio of 1826, that impressed Mendelssohn as &#145;pretty&#146;. Following their meeting in Edinburgh in July 1829, and with Mendelssohn's warm recommendation, Thomson went to Berlin and Leipzig, where he met Schumann and Ignaz Moscheles. The trip also took in Paris, but he was back in Edinburgh by July 1830. In Leipzig he became a student of Schnyder von Wartensee, but Thomson's autograph scores (held in the Reid Music Library in Edinburgh) show only that he submitted some of his works to Moscheles for comment; and it was to Moscheles that he dedicated the impressive sonata for pianoforte and violin, completed in 1835.<br>
<br>Perhaps Thomson's most imposing large-scale work is the opera <span class="italic">Hermann, or, The Broken Spear</span>, first produced in London at the Lyceum in 1834. The simple and melodramatic plot is set in the southern Alps and features bandits, a fine drinking song, abduction, and repentance. Some of the numbers were popular for a time, and the powerfully dramatic overture has remained in the repertory. His other opera, <span class="italic">The Shadow on the Wall</span>, dates from 1835, in which year it was produced, again at the London Lyceum.<br>
<br>Other works include a five-part glee, &#145;When whispering winds&#146;, composed in 1836 for the association in aid of the Edinburgh Professional Society of Musicians. The piece is, in essence, an ode to music, of great beauty and skilfully scored for the voices. A flute quartet and an allegro maestoso for flute and orchestra are sufficiently showy to suggest that Thomson was a flautist. His only works available on sound recordings are the overture to <span class="italic">Hermann</span>; a flute concerto; a touching <span class="italic">Bagatelle</span> for solo piano; and the <span class="italic">Drei Lieder</span>, the first of which is a ravishing setting of Byron (in German) followed by striking settings of poems by Schiller and Uhland. The work was published in Frankfurt in 1838, and Thomson (apparently in Leipzig at the time) dedicated a copy to Mendelssohn which the latter retained in his library until his death. A choral work composed in 1829 to honour the memory of R. A. Smith remains to be discovered. Although his music betrays no Scottish influences, Thomson made many arrangements of Scottish songs for <span class="italic">The Vocal Melodies of Scotland</span>, a joint publication with Finlay Dun in 1836. In October 1839, with recommendations from Mendelssohn and M. W. Balfe, Thomson was elected first Reid professor of music at Edinburgh University, and therefore the first such professor in Scotland. He set about preparing lectures on the history of music and, at the inception of the annual Reid concerts, introduced programme notes (probably the earliest instance of such a practice); but he did not live long enough to establish the chair or, indeed, fully to realize his considerable compositional gifts.<br>
<br>Thomson married Jane Helen Lee, the daughter of the principal of Edinburgh University, on 8 December 1840. His portrait is in the Reid School of Music; from a letter to Catherine Jameson it would appear that he was short in height. He was remembered as a man of sweet disposition, and this is borne out by his surviving correspondence. At the time of his death (from dropsy), on 6 May 1841, he was living with his wife at 16 Howe Street, Edinburgh. His burial place is not known.<br>
