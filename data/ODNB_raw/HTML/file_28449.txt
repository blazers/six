<span class="headword">Waldron,  Francis Godolphin</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1743, <em>d.</em> 1818), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was probably the Francis Godolphin Wallderan baptized on 30 November 1743 at St Peter's, Liverpool, the son of George Wallderan. Nothing further is known about his family circumstances. An early nineteenth-century source suggests that he was apprenticed to the woodcarver Hayworth (the uncle of Samuel De Wilde, who later painted his portrait in character). He acted at Edinburgh in 1766 and 1769, when he also appeared in Richmond, Surrey. Garrick then engaged him for the 1769&#150;70 season at Drury Lane, where he stayed as a player of secondary roles, often in comedy, until 1796. On his London d&eacute;but, as Scrub in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>, the Drury Lane prompter William Hopkins commented on his &#145;mean figure&#146; and &#145;a small impediment in his speaking&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 15.202). Waldron's lisp seems to have limited his professional success, and his roles in some plays that are still revived are a fair indication of his status: Justice Shallow in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, Corin in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, the Second Grave Digger in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, and The Beggar in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>. The <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span> described him as &#145;an actor of very useful, rather than splendid talents&#146;.<br>
<br>Little is known about Waldron's actress wife, even her name. They were presumably married by 1770, when their son Francis Waldron was baptized on 18 September; a second son, George, was baptized on 18 August 1771 and became an actor. After 1788 Waldron was estranged from his wife and set up house with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12348/', "Sarah Harlowe (1765&#150;1852)")</script>, a much younger actress, with whom he had four children.<br>
<br>Despite his limitations as an actor, Waldron was usually well employed during the summer months: he returned to Edinburgh and Richmond in 1770, and was at Birmingham in 1774 (he was there again in 1797, 1799, and 1800). At Drury Lane in 1774 he was one of the committee that established the Drury Lane Theatrical Fund, a pension scheme for old and ill theatrical personnel. Waldron first tried to acquire the lease of the Richmond theatre in 1776 but failed to raise the total required, despite appealing to Garrick for help. He lost the considerable sum of &pound;722 that he had paid as a deposit, but was acting at Richmond again in 1777 and 1778, when he also appeared in Brighton (as he did in 1791). He did acquire the Richmond lease in 1778 and managed seasons there until 1783 (also taking the company to Windsor); he appeared at Richmond as late as 1790. Waldron also ran a company at Hammersmith in 1785 and 1786, when he played more substantial characters, wisely eschewing heroic roles for eccentric parts such as Old Hardcastle in Oliver Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>, Shylock, and Polonius.<br>
<br>In 1793 Waldron joined the Haymarket summer company, working mainly as prompter but playing a number of small parts such as Erpingham in <span class="italic">Henry V</span>, Tubal in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, and Lucianus in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. He stayed at the Haymarket until 1805 but also worked at Drury Lane again from 1800. In 1806 he claimed a pension from the Drury Lane fund that he had helped to establish, although he made a few appearances at the Haymarket and in Brighton in 1807.<br>
<br>Waldron developed a second, albeit undistinguished, string to his bow as a playwright from relatively early on in his career. His first comedy, <span class="italic">The Maid of Kent</span> (played for his benefit at Drury Lane, 17 May 1773; revised as <span class="italic">'Tis a Wise Child Knows its Father</span>, 1795), was based on a story in number 123 of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and was described by the <span class="italic">Covent Garden Magazine</span> (May 1773) as &#145;the hasty production of an unskilful writer&#146;. None of Waldron's theatrical works was particularly successful: <span class="italic">The Prodigal</span> (adapted from Aaron Hill's <span class="italic">The Fatal Extravagance</span>) achieved twelve performances at the Haymarket in 1793&#150;4, but <span class="italic">Heigho for a Husband</span> (also known as <span class="italic">The Imitation, or, The Female Fortune Hunters</span> and, originally, as <span class="italic">The Belle's Stratagem</span>) was his most performed play. A lively romantic comedy inspired by Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>, but substituting two young women for Aimwell and Archer, its general approach is faintly redolent of <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>, another play that acknowledges its intertextual debt to Farquhar. Stock characters and stock situations are handled deftly and the dialogue is well crafted.<br>
<br>Waldron's strong literary and antiquarian interests were manifested in his completion of Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">The Sad Shepherd</span> (1783) and in editions of John Downes's <span class="italic">Roscius Anglicanus</span> (1789), Chaucer's <span class="italic">Troilus and Criseyde</span> (1796), and Thomas Lodge's <span class="italic">Rosalynde</span> (1802). His <span class="italic">The Virgin Queen</span>, an unperformed sequel to <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, published in 1797, is generally regarded as one of the worst pieces of drama inspired by Shakespeare. However, according to the <span class="italic">Authentic Memoirs of the Green Room</span> it was intended as a contribution to the Ireland Shakespeare forgeries controversy, aiming &#145;to expose the vile and well-known forgeries practised on the public by the pretended discovery of certain manuscript plays&#146; by imitating Shakespeare's style and thereby demonstrating that &#145;the forgeries in question are not entitled, even on the plea of <i>ingenuity</i>, to the praise so inconsiderately bestowed upon them&#146;  (Roach). Waldron was also co-author, with Charles Dibdin, of <span class="italic">A Compendious History of the English Stage</span> (1802).<br>
<br>Waldron died in March 1818 at his home in Orange Street, Red Lion Square, London. He left all his property (in a will made in 1805) to Sarah Harlowe and their four children.<br>
