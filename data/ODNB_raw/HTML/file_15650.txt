<span class="headword">Kirk,  John</span>  (1760&#150;1851), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and antiquary</span>, was born at Acton Burnell, Shropshire, on 13 April 1760, the son of William Kirk and his wife, Mary Fielding, both of whom were Catholics. He was educated at Sedgley Park School from 1770 to 1773. On 5 June 1773 he was admitted to the English College, Rome, where he was the last scholar received there by the Jesuits before they were replaced by Italian secular clerics. Kirk's diary for the period 1773 to 1779, now in the college archives, is the main source for internal college politics in these years. The young Kirk, disliking the new administration (which he represented as harsh and oppressive), portrayed the Jesuit period as a golden age. However, since he spent only three months at the college before the new administration was established, his complaints must be treated with caution. Although the new authorities tightened up the discipline of the college, they did not introduce any regulations which were not common in Italian seminaries.<br>
<br>Kirk was ordained priest on 18 December 1784 and returned to England in August 1785. His first mission was at Aldenham Hall, Shropshire, the home of Sir Richard Acton, but he soon left to become chaplain at Sedgley Park, where he became vice-president in 1786 and president on 27 April 1793. Before this appointment he had served at the small mission of Pipe Hall, near Lichfield, where he was also in charge of the congregation of Tamworth. In July 1797 he left Sedgley Park to become chaplain and private secretary to Charles Berington, vicar apostolic of the Midland district. He lived with Berington at Longbirch, where he had charge of the mission. He assisted Berington's cousin, the controversial cisalpine historian Joseph Berington, with his <span class="italic">History of the Rise, Progress and Decline of the Papal Power</span>, and became one of the Staffordshire Squadron, a group of liberal clergy advocating a form of ecclesiastical democracy in opposition to Walmesley, the vicar apostolic of the western district. Charles Berington's sudden death in June 1798, in Kirk's arms, led to the disintegration of this liberal party. Kirk remained at Longbirch until Gregory Stapleton was appointed to succeed Berington in 1801, when he moved to Lichfield to serve three local congregations. His involvement with the Staffordshire Squadron may account for his subsequent lack of promotion.<br>
<br>At Lichfield he built a chapel which was opened on 11 November 1803. He enjoyed cordial relations with his protestant neighbours; on his arrival in Lichfield he met with a more than metaphorically warm reception from the cathedral dignitaries, who found him lodgings above a bakery. When he converted his chapel into the church of St Cross in 1834, members of the municipal corporation subscribed to his funds to mark their respect. Although he was hooted at during the 1826 general election, and an effigy of Wiseman was displayed outside his windows during the &#145;papal aggression&#146; crisis of 1850, he was influential in Lichfield society. He built chapels at Hopwas and Tamworth.<br>
<br>However, Kirk's main labours during the fifty years he spent in Lichfield lay in &#145;the cabinet rather than the field, in the study rather than the pulpit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tablet</span>, 52). As a young man he had read Charles Dodd's <span class="italic">Church History of England</span> (1737&#150;42), and had decided to write a continuation of the work, covering the history of eighteenth-century English Catholicism. His extensive collection of materials for this work was described in a <span class="italic">Letter to the Rev. Joseph Berington</span> (1826). The continuation of the <span class="italic">History</span>, however, remained unwritten, and Kirk handed over most of his materials to Mark Aloysius Tierney, who brought out a new, but incomplete, edition of Dodd between 1839 and 1843. The manuscripts subsequently passed to the Westminster Diocesan Archives, and in 1908 one of the manuscripts was edited by J. H. Pollen and E. Burton and published as <span class="italic">Biographies of English Catholics in the Eighteenth Century</span>. It remains an essential (if not always accurate) source for historians of eighteenth-century English Catholicism. Kirk helped to prepare for publication the papers of Sir Ralph Sadler, Elizabeth I's ambassador to Scotland, which appeared in 1809 with an introduction by Walter Scott. He also collaborated with the Coventry antiquary Thomas Sharp. To his contemporaries, however, he was best known for his work <span class="italic">The Faith of Catholics</span> (1813), which was written in collaboration with Joseph Berington. Later described as one of the nineteenth-century's most enduring controversial works, it was republished in 1830 and 1846, and a Latin translation was published in Bonn in 1844. It provoked replies from John Graham, who criticized it in a review included in his <span class="italic">Annals of Ireland</span> (1819), and from R. T. P. Pope in his <span class="italic">Roman Misquotation</span> (1840). Kirk also published an edition of a Roman Catholic tract of 1680, <span class="italic">Roman Catholic Principles in Reference to God and the King</span> (1815), with an introduction identifying the author as the Benedictine abbot of Lamspringe, James Corker.<br>
<br>In 1841 Pope Gregory XVI conferred a DD upon Kirk. Kirk died at Lichfield on 21 December 1851 and was buried at St Cross Church. In his obituary by Henry Weedall, president of Oscott College, he was described as &#145;a living chronicle of persons, places and facts &hellip; a perfect specimen of the olden times, a type of the fine old English Priest; methodical, dignified, devout&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Tablet</span>, 52).<br>
