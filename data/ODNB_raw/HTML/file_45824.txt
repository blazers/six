<span class="headword">Shirley,  Elizabeth</span>  (1564/5&#150;1641), <span class="occ">Augustinian nun and author</span>, was the daughter of Sir John Shirley of Shirley in Leicestershire. Sickly in childhood and adolescence she was raised a protestant until at the age of about twenty she went to live as housekeeper to her unmarried Catholic brother, Sir George Shirley of Staunton-Harrold in Leicestershire. Although initially resistant to his efforts to convert her Elizabeth was eventually persuaded by miraculous stories, Catholic literature, and an apparition of the Holy Ghost. Following the marriage of her brother the pressures of recusancy, her ill health, and a reluctance to marry convinced her to enter a convent. After some doubts regarding her vocation she finally joined the Flemish Augustinian cloister of St Ursula's in Louvain, where she made her religious profession on 10 September 1596. In 1608, when the English nuns there decided to establish a separate house, Elizabeth was appointed procuratrice, responsible for its finances, and temporary prioress of the proposed venture. She remained in charge from the nuns' arrival at the new convent on 10 February 1609 until the election of a permanent superior in November, after which she became the sub-prioress, a position she held until infirmity forced her to resign in 1637.<br>
<br>As a capable administrator Elizabeth was principally responsible for establishing the English Augustinian cloister of St Monica's in Louvain. Since the 1569 election of an English prioress, Margaret Clement, in the Flemish convent about twenty-eight women had crossed the channel and entered there. Upon Clement's retirement in 1606 the disputed election of a Flemish superior culminated in the move for a separate convent. The English feared that St Ursula's would no longer receive recusant novices in the face of competition from the recently founded Benedictine monastery in Brussels and a proposed Poor Clare house at St Omer. Elizabeth Shirley was eminently qualified to organize and execute the venture. Her experience in supervising a secular household, coupled with the financial generosity of her family, enabled her to solicit funds, negotiate renting a suitable house, secure as many household and religious furnishings as the Flemish sisters would donate, and facilitate the removal of the six founders and their belongings from St Ursula's to St Monica's. The first few months in the new house were marked by strong religious fervour, tempered by severe financial shortfalls. As procuratrice Elizabeth feared that the cloister would fail, but she managed to secure sufficient alms to avoid dissolution, even putting some money aside to purchase a permanent residence. Although her sisters ultimately elected Jane (Sister Mary) Wiseman as the first prioress, Elizabeth's appointment as sub-prioress affirmed their confidence in her continuing capacity to manage their temporal concerns. She is regarded as instrumental in the foundation of St Monica's in all accounts of the cloister's establishment.<br>
<br>However, Elizabeth Shirley is also known as an author. In 1626 she composed the biography of St Ursula's English prioress whose success in attracting English novices paved the way for St Monica's. Written fourteen years after Margaret Clement's death Elizabeth's hagiographical text offered not only the life of her former prioress and the early history of the English Augustinians in Louvain, but it also aspired to provide spiritual and practical guidance to her sisters and their superiors. Deprecating her skill and worthiness as the recorder of Clement's virtue Elizabeth defended her assumption of the task, declaring:<blockquote>I thought it my duty &amp; part to geve her some Littell mytt of my good will &hellip; beseeching allmighty god to geve me his grace that I may in som littell thing emmitate her &amp; allso to inspire all those that shall hereafter posses her place &amp; offis of government, that they may sett her as a true pattron &amp; example before them &amp; I assure my self they shall make a happy progres. (Shirley, fols. 62&#150;3)</blockquote>As a writer, therefore, Elizabeth cemented the economic and administrative foundations she had laid in 1608 by establishing herself as a custodian of the cloister's heritage and adviser to future generations of nuns.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Shirley died, aged seventy-six, on 1 September 1641 at St Monica's, where she was buried. Upon her death her sisters warmly acknowledged her contributions, noting that deafness in old age had deprived them of her much appreciated counsel. Although Elizabeth Shirley was destined to play second fiddle to other superiors in her long religious career of forty-six years, her achievements show how the cloister provided capable and well-connected women considerable scope for institutional governance in early modern society.<br>
