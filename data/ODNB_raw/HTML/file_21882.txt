<span class="headword">Penny,  Nicholas</span>  (1790&#150;1858), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was born in November 1790, fourth son of Robert Penny of Weymouth, Dorset, the descendant of a family long settled there. He was appointed to the Bengal army in 1806. He was gazetted ensign in the Bengal native infantry on 16 August 1807, and lieutenant on 19 December 1812, and, successively, brevet captain (5 March 1822), regimental captain (13 May 1825), brevet major (19 January 1826), regimental major (2 February 1842), brevet lieutenant-colonel (23 November 1841), regimental lieutenant-colonel (29 July 1848), brevet colonel (7 June 1849), regimental colonel (15 September 1851), and major-general (28 November 1854).<br>
<br>Penny served with distinction throughout the siege of Bharatpur, the First Anglo-Sikh War, and the Indian mutiny&#151;from 1825 to 1858&#151;and was repeatedly on active service. In November 1825 he accompanied the commander-in-chief, Lord Amherst, on service to Agra. He was present as deputy assistant quartermaster-general with the 2nd division of infantry at the siege of Bharatpur in December 1825 and January 1826, was thanked in divisional orders by Major-General Nicholls, and shared in the Bharatpur prize-money. He was brigade major on the establishment from 2 October 1826 to 19 May 1828. He was appointed to Mathura and Agra frontier on 4 October 1826, deputy assistant adjutant-general on the establishment on 19 May 1828, and assistant adjutant-general of a division on 9 July 1832. He married at Dinapore on 26 May 1830 Louisa Margaret, third and youngest daughter of John Gerrard.<br>
<br>Penny was granted the brevet rank of major for distinguished services in the field, and was appointed to command the Nusseree battalion (the first British Gurkha regiment) on 2 June 1841, and was reported as &#145;a most zealous officer&#146;. He was appointed to command the 12th brigade of the 5th division of infantry of the army of the Sutlej on 1 January 1846, and on the breaking up of this brigade was appointed to command the 2nd infantry brigade (16 February 1846). He served at the battle of Aliwal, and was commended in dispatches. At the battle of Sobraon, in the First Anglo-Sikh War, Penny was slightly wounded; his services were commended in dispatches and he was made a CB on 27 June 1846. He was posted to the 69th Bengal native infantry, and ordered to Lahore on 27 September 1848. He was appointed to command of the 7th brigade of the 3rd infantry division of the army of the Punjab, with the rank of brigadier (13 October 1848).<br>
<br>Penny had ceased to command the Nusseree battalion on promotion to lieutenant-colonel (7 October 1848). He was transferred from the 69th to the 70th Bengal native infantry on 12 January 1849, and was present at Chilianwala in command of the reserve, and also at Gujrat. He was mentioned in dispatches, and received the thanks of the governor-general, Lord Dalhousie. He was transferred to the 2nd European regiment on 31 March 1849, and was appointed aide-de-camp to the queen, and promoted brevet colonel for his services in the Punjab.<br>
<br>In 1850 Penny was transferred from the 2nd European regiment to the 40th Bengal native infantry, was appointed second-class brigadier, and was posted to the district of Rohilkhand (14 July 1851). He was transferred to the command of the Jullundur field force on 2 February 1852, and on 28 August he was appointed to command the Sirhind division, and subsequently he was again transferred to the command of the Sind-Saugor district (22 November 1853), and to the Sialkot command (19 January 1854). In May 1855 he was appointed to the temporary divisional staff, and posted to the Cawnpore division, and on 30 June 1857 was appointed to the divisional staff of the army as major-general, and posted to the Meerut division. When the mutiny was at its height he was appointed to command the Delhi field force, in conjunction with that of the Meerut division, from 30 September 1857. This was after the capture of Delhi, as Sir Archdale Wilson kept command until the city was taken. Penny was killed by rebels at Budaun, while in command of the Meerut division, on 4 May 1858. He was buried at Meerut.<br>
