<span class="headword">Pulter <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ley]</span>, Lady  Hester</span>  (1595/6&#150;1678), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born probably at Westbury, Wiltshire, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16619/', "James Ley (1550&#150;1629)")</script>, judge and politician, who was created first earl of Marlborough in 1626. Her mother was his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1613), daughter of John Pettie (or Pettey) of Stoke Talmage, Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>It is only relatively recently that Lady Hester has come to public attention, and until the emergence of a manuscript held by the Brotherton Collection at the University of Leeds, she was not the most famous of Ley's daughters. Notably, her father is the subject of a sonnet by John Milton which is addressed to her sister, Lady Margaret Ley  (Sonnet 10, &#145;Daughter to that good earl&#146;). In 1623 Lady Hester married Arthur Pulter (1603&#150;1689) of Broadfield (or Bradfield) in Hertfordshire. The couple had seven sons (Jacob, James, William, Arthur, Edward, Charles, and John) and eight daughters (Margaret, Mary, Jane, Hester, Penelope, Ann, Elizabeth, and Mary). The Pulter manuscript includes comments to the effect that she wrote during her periods of confinement. Her husband was born at Hadham Hall, Hertfordshire, in August 1603, the son of Lytton Pulter (1575&#150;1626) and Penelope Capel (1581&#150;1611). He was a justice of the peace, a captain in the militia, and, in 1641, high sheriff of Hertfordshire. He apparently withdrew from public life during the civil war period, dedicating himself to the building of a house at Broadfield, which no longer stands. Details of the Pulters are contained in Sir Henry Chauncy's <span class="italic">The Historical Antiquities of Hertfordshire</span> (1700), and clearly Chauncy was a family friend.<br>
<br>The Leeds manuscript contains about 120 poems under the title &#145;Poems Breathed Forth by the Noble Hadassas&#146; (Hadassas being a biblical synonym for Esther), and a prose romance, &#145;The Unfortunate Florinda&#146;, in two parts, the second of which is incomplete. From the dates given in the manuscript, this material appears to have been brought together between 1645 and 1665. Pulter's writings were produced by an educated and highly literate woman. The connection that her sister Margaret had to the London literary world through Milton might have been a route for Hester to keep in touch with the poetry of the period, and her connection to this milieu is marked in the subject matter of some of the poems. She also writes about and for members of her family, and there are many devotional poems in a meditative, metaphysical mode. The poetry reveals a strong involvement in public affairs, including a substantial number of polemical poems on the events of the civil war, all of which are characterized by her commitment to the royalist cause.<br>
<br>Pulter's work seems set to attain a prominent place within the canon of seventeenth-century women writers, and the volume and variety of her output makes her a figure of importance comparable only to Lady Mary Wroth. That she did not publish in her lifetime, and that her work does not appear to have circulated widely, is not an indication of the texts' quality. While it is inevitable that the standard is various, the best of her work will assure her continued presence in considerations of the literature of the period.<br>
<br>Pulter outlived all but two of her fifteen children, and the records of Cottered in Hertfordshire show that she was buried on 9 April 1678, at the age of eighty-two. Arthur Pulter died, having outlived his wife and all his children, on 27 January 1689. Their only grandson and sole heir was James Forester (1660&#150;1696).<br>
