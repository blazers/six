<span class="headword">Siddons,  Henry</span>  (1774&#150;1815), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, born in Wolverhampton on 23 October 1774, was the eldest child of the actor William Siddons (<i>d</i>. 11 March 1808) and the renowned actress <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25516/', "Sarah Siddons (1755&#150;1831)")</script>. His first appearance on stage was in 1783, when his mother brought him to London to play Child to her Isabella in David Garrick's <span class="italic">Isabella, or, The Fatal Marriage</span> at Drury Lane. He was sent first to Dr Barrow's academy in Soho Square and then for five years to Charterhouse, where he acquired a thorough knowledge of the classics. At the age of fifteen he wrote an interlude called <span class="italic">Modern Breakfast, or, All Asleep at Noon</span>, which was acted for the benefit of his aunt Elizabeth Kemble at the Haymarket in 1790.<br>
<br>After leaving school Siddons went with his father to France, and on his return joined the company of his uncle Stephen Kemble in Sheffield, appearing as Zanga in Edward Young's <span class="italic">The Revenge</span> in November 1792. He then performed at Lancaster, Liverpool, Bath, and other provincial theatres and also began to write more dramatic pieces of his own; among those produced were <span class="italic">Sicilian Romance, or, Apparition of the Cliffs</span> (1794), <span class="italic">Adventures of Tom Trip</span>, <span class="italic">What we have been and what we may be</span> (1796), and <span class="italic">Zelida, or, The Pirates</span> (1799). Siddons accompanied Kemble to Newcastle and Edinburgh, and showed such talent in playing the parts of the Stranger in <span class="italic">Douglas</span> and Rolla in <span class="italic">Pizarro</span> that his mother, who had originally intended him for the church, withdrew her earlier objections to his becoming an actor, and was induced to recommend him to Harris, the proprietor of the Covent Garden Theatre in London. She even acted Lady Randolph to his Douglas in Hannah More's <span class="italic">Percy</span> in May 1802, on the occasion of his benefit.<br>
<br>Siddons was engaged by Harris for three years, and in October 1801 made his first appearance at Covent Garden, as Herman in a play called <span class="italic">Integrity</span>. His future wife, the actress <a href="#cosubject_25514">Harriet Murray [<i>see below</i>]</a>, daughter of the actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19595/', "Charles Murray")</script>, played in the same piece. They were married on 22 June 1802. There were children of the marriage. Siddons remained a member of Covent Garden until the spring of 1805. In September 1805 he made his first appearance at Drury Lane, playing the Prince of Wales to Elliston's Hotspur in <span class="italic">Henry IV</span>. Next he appeared as Romeo and Sir G. Touchwood in <span class="italic">The Belle's Stratagem</span>. During his stay at Drury Lane he played a variety of leading roles, including Banquo in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span>, Jaffier in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, and Claudio in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>. He terminated his connection with the London stage at the close of the season of 1808&#150;9.<br>
<br>Largely through Sir Walter Scott's influence, Siddons secured the patent of the Edinburgh Theatre Royal. The theatre was then over forty years old and a change of management was definitely required; Henry Siddons, his wife, and his wife's brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19656/', "William Henry Murray")</script> were thought to be ideal for the job. Siddons left the old building, transferred the royal sanction to the Circus on Leith Walk, and opened the New Theatre Royal, Leith Walk, in November 1809 with John Tobin's <span class="italic">The Honeymoon</span>, in which he played the Duke and his wife played Juliana. This opening was eminently successful. To maintain the popularity and high standard of the theatre, the Siddonses engaged Sarah Siddons and Stephen Kemble for a season. Siddons and his wife regularly appeared together, as the Count de Valmont and the Unknown Female in <span class="italic">The Foundling of the Forest</span>, as Leonatus and Paulina in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span>, and so on. When, around September 1814, Drury Lane asked Harriet Siddons to play Juliet to Edmund Kean's Romeo, she declined without hesitation, preferring to remain with her husband. By then Siddons was fighting a losing battle, however. His play <span class="italic">Friend of the Family</span> was reproduced in December 1814 under the new name of <span class="italic">Policy, or, Thus Runs the World Away</span>, but played only twice. In February 1815 <span class="italic">The Comedy of Errors</span> was performed in Edinburgh for the first time in thirty years, with Murray and Samuel Russell as the two Dromios, but it could not turn the fortunes of the theatre. On 1 March 1815 Siddons appeared on stage for the last time, as Captain Downright in <span class="italic">The Wild Indian Girl</span> for his wife's benefit. On 12 April 1815 he died in Edinburgh, leaving his wife and the theatre in severe financial difficulties.<br>
<br>Siddons made a great effort to be an efficient and innovative manager and bring success to the theatre, but as an actor he was at the disadvantage of having to suffer constant comparison with his more talented relatives the Kembles, and as a result never received the acclaim that he perhaps deserved. His plays <span class="italic">Time's a Tell-Tale</span>, <span class="italic">The Russian Imposter</span>, and <span class="italic">Tale of Terror, or, Castle Without a Spectre</span>, produced at Covent Garden for Murray's benefit in 1803, as well as his other pieces, were not very successful either. He adapted from a work by Engel <span class="italic">Illustrations of Gesture and Action</span> (1807), and published three novels, <span class="italic">William Wallace</span>, <span class="italic">Leon, a Spartan Story</span>, and <span class="italic">Somerset</span>.<br>
<br>Siddons's wife, <a name="cosubject_25514"></a><span class="headword">Harriet Siddons</span>  (1783&#150;1844), <span class="occ">actress</span>, appeared as a child at Bath as Prince Arthur in <span class="italic">King John</span> for her father's benefit on 1 July 1793. Her London d&eacute;but was at Covent Garden, as Perdita in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> (May 1798). She remained at that theatre until the summer of 1805, playing with success a large range of parts, from the Shakespearian heroines Rosalind, Viola, Desdemona, Portia, and Beatrice, to Lucy Ashton in Calcraft's Waverley drama <span class="italic">The Bride of Lammermoor</span>, Lady Teazle in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, and Miss Hardcastle in Goldsmith's <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span>.<br>
<br>In 1805 Harriet joined the Drury Lane company together with her husband and had an immediate success playing Juliet to Elliston's Romeo. Her first appearance in Edinburgh was in 1808, at the Theatre Royal, where she played Belvidera in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> to the Jaffier of her husband and Ophelia to his Hamlet. She shared managerial duties with her husband from 1809 to 1815; even after his death, when the affairs of the theatre were in a bad state, she was determined to survive with her brother's help in management.<br>
<br>In January 1816 Mrs Siddons made her first appearance since her husband's death, playing Viola in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>. Murray played Sebastian, and the strong resemblance between brother and sister contributed to the success of the performance. They acted together again in <span class="italic">The Belle's Stratagem</span> in 1819, Harriet playing Letitia Hardy and Murray playing Flutter. Their wisest decision was to stage the various adaptations of Sir Walter Scott's novels, whose success really helped to raise the fortunes of the house. Daniel Terry's adaptation of <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span> was the first of the Waverley dramas performed at the Theatre Royal, in 1817, with Harriet as Meg Merrilees. She also played Jeanie Deans in <span class="italic">The Heart of Midlothian</span> (1820), Amy in Tom Dibdin's version of <span class="italic">Kenilworth, or, The Merry Days of Old England</span> (1822), and Diana Vernon in <span class="italic">Rob Roy</span>, which was produced on the occasion of the visit to Edinburgh by George IV in 1822. In May 1825 the production of a series of Waverley dramas commenced with <span class="italic">The Rose of Ettrick Vale</span>, Harriet Siddons playing the title role. Murray also took part in all these plays. Harriet took her farewell benefit on 29 March 1829, as Lady Townly in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span>. The address she delivered on this occasion was written by her great patron, Sir Walter Scott. This was not her last appearance, however, as during her brother's illness she helped out in a number of casts. She died in Edinburgh on 2 November 1844.<br>
