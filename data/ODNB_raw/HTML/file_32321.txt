<span class="headword">Casey,  William Francis</span>  (1884&#150;1957), <span class="occ">newspaper editor</span>, was born in Cape Town on 2 May 1884, the son of Patrick Joseph Casey, theatre proprietor, of Glenageary, co. Dublin. He was educated in Ireland at Castleknock College and Trinity College, Dublin, of which in later life he was made an honorary LLD. He spent two years reading medicine before changing his mind and turning to law. He was called to the Irish bar in 1909. But again he was undecided on his career. He described his period in the law as &#145;one year, one brief, one guinea&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of The Times</span>, 5.165). His thoughts had been drawn instead towards the theatre and, while reading for the bar, he became interested in the work of the Abbey Theatre when the directors included W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory. He worked for a time on the business side, and then in 1908 two of his plays, <span class="italic">The Suburban Groove</span> and <span class="italic">The Man who Missed the Tide</span>, were produced at the Abbey and with their success he decided to try his luck in London. He took with him a letter to Bruce Richmond, editor of the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>. Richmond saw the young writer's promise and it was agreed that Casey should review for the supplement. In 1914 he married Amy Gertrude Pearson-Gee, a widow, daughter of Henry Wilmott. They had no children.<br>
<br>Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, Casey was offered a post as a sub-editor in the sporting department of <span class="italic">The Times</span> and from then until his retirement he was a permanent member of that paper's staff. He then served as a foreign sub-editor, with his interest and skill leading to a posting to Washington in 1919, then to Paris in the following year. He returned to London in 1923 as chief foreign sub-editor, regarded as one of the most arduous and anxious positions on the paper. He held this post until 1928. He was part of the group of proprietors and editorial staff who attempted to produce the paper during the general strike of 1926. Afterwards a souvenir volume, <span class="italic">Strike Nights in Printing House Square</span>, was printed for private record. One of its pictures bore the caption &#145;Amateurs in the foundry&#146; and showed Casey and Captain Shaw, the chairman's secretary, hard at work on a mechanical process, as &#145;the champion pair of matrix moulders&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1928 Casey was promoted to the foreign leader-writing staff. He attended many of the Geneva sessions of the League of Nations. In the 1930s his concern grew as to German aspirations in Europe. He was known within the senior ranks as a francophile, but within <span class="italic">The Times</span> of that period he &#145;knew that his judgement on foreign matters carried little weight&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of The Times</span>, 4.929). He was part of the group of senior journalists who gathered in 1936 in the office of the paper's deputy editor, R. M. Barrington-Ward&#151;a strong supporter of appeasement with Hitler, as was the editor, Geoffrey Dawson&#151;to demand the paper take a stronger line to &#145;stand up to Hitler&#146;  (Heren, 36). They were ignored. But on the retirement of Dawson in 1941, the new editor, Barrington-Ward, appointed Casey his deputy; the selection was welcomed by the staff, partly because of his greatly more relaxed style. He was a member of many clubs and he would declare that, if he could squeeze in a game of billiards in his dinner break, work went much more easily on his return. Iverach McDonald described him as &#145;never over-eager to work&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of The Times</span>, 5.164).<br>
<br>Barrington-Ward's health was deteriorating and his death in 1948 threw the burden of the editorship on to Casey's shoulders sooner than he had expected: he himself had never wished to be editor. Only a few months before he had agreed with Barrington-Ward that he &#145;should very soon retire&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of The Times</span>, 5.164). Stephen Koss says it was &#145;clearly a stopgap appointment&#146;  (Koss, 643). John Pringle, on <span class="italic">The Times</span> staff, said of Casey's editorship that &#145;as time went on, he found it harder to face the detailed administrative work and constant decisions &hellip; [his deputy, Donald] Tyerman &hellip; often had to get the paper out for days on end without much guidance from the editor&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of The Times</span>, 5.199). Yet his willingness to listen to staff and the fact that, unusually for an editor, he &#145;seemed to have all the time in the world&#146;  (Heren, 90), made him a popular figure among the journalists under him. He retired as editor in 1952 and died in a nursing home at 10 Porchester Terrace, Paddington, London, on 20 April 1957. He was cremated at Golders Green on 26 April.<br>
