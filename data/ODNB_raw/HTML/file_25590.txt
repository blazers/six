<span class="headword">Simpson,  Richard</span>  (1820&#150;1876), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic writer and literary scholar</span>, was born at Beddington, Surrey, on 16 September 1820, the second son of the four children of William Simpson and his wife, Emily Cranmer, through whom the manor of Mitcham, Surrey, came into the Simpson family. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and at Oriel College, Oxford, where he graduated BA on 9 February 1843. In 1844 he became vicar of Mitcham, a family living, which he resigned shortly before his conversion to Roman Catholicism on 1 August 1846. Having married his cousin Elizabeth Mary Cranmer on 29 October 1844, he was unable to pursue his clerical vocation in his new communion. He travelled for more than a year on the continent, learning several languages. After settling at Clapham, Surrey, in 1847, with an inherited income of several hundred pounds, he devoted himself to literary pursuits, particularly archival research in sixteenth-century history. He was also a prolific musical composer.<br>
<br>In 1850 Simpson began to write for <span class="italic">The Rambler</span>, a Roman Catholic monthly founded by liberal converts, and in 1856 became its assistant editor; in 1858 he was made editor and a proprietor, Sir John Acton being the principal proprietor. From early on in his participation in <span class="italic">The Rambler</span>, Simpson came into conflict with members of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, who disapproved of a layman's writing on theology, of his fierce insistence on freedom of scholarship and of philosophic speculation, and of his frequent puckish irreverence towards authority. Simpson's deep faith centred on the dogmatic core of Roman Catholicism, leaving him free to apply his mind (and his sense of humour) to all other subjects. With these views, he joined Acton in making <span class="italic">The Rambler</span> the organ of the liberal Catholic movement in England, opposing the trend towards ultramontanism. The bishops forced his resignation as editor in 1859, replacing him briefly with John Henry Newman and then with Acton; but Simpson remained a proprietor of and major contributor to the magazine. He was an admirer of Newman, who sympathized with his views but disapproved of his tactics. In 1862 the magazine was transformed into the quarterly <span class="italic">Home and Foreign Review</span>, one of the most distinguished periodicals of its day, praised by Matthew Arnold (&#145;The function of criticism at the present time&#146;) for &#145;so much knowledge, so much play of mind&#146;. The review was denounced by Cardinal Wiseman and Bishop Ullathorne; Simpson replied with a spirited pamphlet, <span class="italic">Bishop Ullathorne and The Rambler</span> (1862). But the conflict between liberal Catholic principles and the positions taken by church authorities, and eventually by Pope Pius IX himself, forced its conductors to discontinue the review in 1864.<br>
<br>Simpson participated in other ventures of the Acton circle, <span class="italic">The Chronicle</span> newspaper in 1867&#150;8 and the <span class="italic">North British Review</span> in 1869&#150;71, both more Gladstonian Liberal than religious. The definition of papal infallibility in 1870 served as the final blow to liberal Catholicism, and Simpson had already diverted his energies elsewhere. He had published numerous studies of recusant history in <span class="italic">The Rambler</span>, leading to his principal work, <span class="italic">Edmund Campion: a Biography</span> (1867), long the standard work on the subject. His studies of the Elizabethan period led him to an interest in Shakespearian studies; he was one of the first to advance the theory that Shakespeare was a Roman Catholic. He was elected a member of the committee of the New Shakspere Society in 1874. His most original work in this field was <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Philosophy of Shakespeare's Sonnets</span> (1868). In 1872 he published the first of a series of editions of Elizabethan dramas with which it was believed that Shakespeare had been connected. After his death the whole appeared as <span class="italic">The School of Shakespeare</span> (2 vols., 1878).<br>
<br>Simpson was consulted on some minor points when W. E. Gladstone was preparing his tract <span class="italic">Vaticanism</span> late in 1874, but the statement in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> that Simpson &#145;was constantly at his side&#146; is wrong. Simpson had already made his own adjustment to a minimalist acceptance of the dogma of papal infallibility. Simpson died of cancer on 5 April 1876 at Villa Sciarra, Rome; he was buried in Rome.<br>
