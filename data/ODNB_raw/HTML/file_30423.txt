<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Anson, Sir  William Reynell</span>, third baronet  (1843&#150;1914), <span class="occ">politician and college head</span>, was born at Walberton, Sussex, on 14 November 1843, the eldest son of Sir John William Hamilton Anson, second baronet (1816&#150;1873), and his wife, Elizabeth Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1903), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21067/', "Major-General Sir Denis Pack")</script>. After three years at a private school at Brighton he went to Eton College, in 1857, becoming there after a time the pupil of Edmond Warre, later headmaster. In 1862 he matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, and after taking first classes in classical moderations and in the final classical school he was elected to a fellowship at All Souls College in 1867, an event which was to determine his subsequent career.<br>
<br>Anson was called to the bar at the Inner Temple, London, on 17 November 1869 (and became a bencher in 1900), and practised on the northern circuit. He succeeded to the baronetcy in 1873, when his father died in a railway accident, and in 1874 he was appointed Vinerian reader in English law at Oxford, the first of a notable series of appointments which led to a golden period for the Oxford law school. Anson at this time wrote <span class="italic">Principles of the Law of Agency in its Relation to Contract</span> (1879).<br>
<br>The Selborne royal commission of 1877 encouraged much thinking about the future of All Souls. Anson was one of the two college representatives who negotiated with the commissioners about new statutes for the college. Anson was a moderate liberal in politics and stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal for West Staffordshire in the 1880 general election. In the university he was also a moderate reformer and he protected the college from the more dramatic proposals for its future (including the idea of C. H. Robarts that there should be a fusion between the college and the Bodleian Library). Anson's recommendations were seen by many fellows as radical in their day, though some observers have seen them as a chance missed. The new statutes gave the opportunity to All Souls to become a place of research by reforming the system of prize fellowships by examination, creating more research fellowships; they also altered the tenure of fellowships and the disposal of college revenues (a critical matter with the onset of the agricultural depression). One of the statutes advantaged the Bodleian financially when the college could afford it. Anson's own approach may be seen from his comment on his colleague J. A. Doyle: he believed &#145;that there was room for a college of an exceptional type, devoting itself through its professoriate and its library to university purposes, encouraging advanced study by the endowment of research, securing through a system of prize fellowships the continued interest in academic life of men engaged in public work, and yet retaining its old character as a collegiate society&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 71).<br>
<br>In 1881 Anson was elected warden of the college, defeating Ernald Lane, the candidate of the college conservatives, who resented the new statutes. Anson was young, liberal, and the first lay head of the college. A lifelong bachelor, his sisters Elizabeth, Florence, and Gertrude lived with him in the warden's lodgings throughout his long tenure of office. His wardenship consolidated and extended the work he had already done through statute revision, and his guidance of the college's finances in developing its estates in north-west London protected it from the fall in agricultural rents and land values which severely affected many of the Oxford colleges. He was a careful and dedicated warden, secretly using his salary to benefit individuals (he personally paid the salaries of the research fellowships of S. R. Gardiner and C. H. Firth) and the Bodleian Library. His wardenship regained for All Souls a significant role both in Oxford and in British intellectual life. He promoted research among the fellows and attempted to make the college less self-regarding. Anson opened the college for university lectures and he encouraged the fellows to teach undergraduates, for many years personally tutoring Trinity College law students. From 1912 until his death he tutored the prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) on the constitution. Between 1874 and 1898 Anson was, in A. V. Dicey's view, &#145;the best teacher of English Law to be found in Oxford&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 86). He continued to write and was closely associated with the <span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span>. The first volume of his <span class="italic">Law and Custom of the Constitution</span> was published in 1886, with two further volumes in 1892 and 1908. Anson also edited the autobiography and correspondence of Augustus Henry Fitzroy, third duke of Grafton, in 1898, and he had privately printed as <span class="italic">Ballads &#145;en termes de la ley&#146;</span> (1894) some of the light verse&#151;often humorous&#151;which he wrote for the <span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span> (where it was signed XXX).<br>
<br>Anson became vice-chancellor for Oxford University in 1898, but he resigned after a year to become one of the two MPs for the university; he held his seat unopposed until his death. He continued to be a moderate reformer in the university, chairing in 1897 a committee on degrees for women, which proposed a diploma&#151;a half-way house which pleased neither side; Anson also without effect suggested a national women's university, to remove women from the existing universities. He organized Curzon's defeat of Lord Rosebery for the chancellorship in 1907 (Curzon and Charles Oman being the first prize fellows elected under Anson's wardenship; Curzon was subsequently a strongly reforming chancellor).<br>
<br>Like his colleague A. V. Dicey, Anson was a passionate opponent of home rule, the question which in 1886 was the occasion for his move away from the Liberal Party. He strongly opposed the <span class="roman">Finance Bill</span> in 1909 and the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span> in 1911, and in a letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> (31 March 1914) he was not far short of encouraging Ulster to armed resistance. But despite his authority as a constitutional expert he played little constructive role in the vigorous constitutional debates of the Edwardian period. He made something of a parliamentary name (though his weak voice made him an ineffective orator) supporting the <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> in 1902. Midway through its passing, in August 1902, he became parliamentary secretary to the Board of Education and took day-to-day charge of the bill. He was ill at ease in the violently partisan debates on the bill (for whose original drafting he had had no responsibility). In 1903 he saw the <span class="roman">London Education Bill</span> through the house and he was responsible for the implementation of the 1902 act, which provoked widespread civil disobedience by respectable nonconformists. He resigned with Balfour's government in 1905 and spoke for the Conservative opposition against subsequent Liberal educational measures. Although not partisan by character Anson, though continuing to be warden of All Souls, became a tory party spokesman in a period of exceptionally partisan politics. His loyal Conservatism was recognized, perhaps belatedly, by membership of the privy council in June 1911, in the coronation honours.<br>
<br>Anson's works both on contract and on the constitution gained an enduring place in English legal writing. <span class="italic">Law of Contract</span> was frequently revised, first by Anson himself, then by Maurice L. Gwyer and others, and latterly by A. G. Guest, under whose editorship the book in 1979 reached its twenty-fifth and centenary edition; it went on thereafter to a twenty-sixth edition. Anson himself revised <span class="italic">Law and Custom of the Constitution</span>; the second volume was updated by A. Berriedale Keith in 1935, and again by Maurice L. Gwyer in 1957, who had also earlier revised the first and third volumes. Anson's works are characterized by judicious practicality. Whereas Dicey worked from general principles and argued sweeping interpretations, Anson was more historicist and more cautious. He directly attacked John Austin, but he implicitly commented on Dicey. Anson set out to delineate the general principles of contract through the analysis of a working system and he &#145;endeavoured &hellip; to state the law relating to existing institutions, with so much history as is necessary to show how they have come to be what they are&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, <span class="italic">Law of the Constitution</span>, 1886, preface). His works were therefore in their day better guides than Dicey's, but they lack excitement for posterity. Anson was conscious of this point, remarking that Dicey &#145;has done the work of an artist. I have tried to do the work of a surveyor&#146;  (ibid.). Moreover, though historical in approach <span class="italic">Law of the Constitution</span> in particular was based on a rather limited range of sources, sufficient for the time but confirming rather than advancing contemporary understanding. However, by setting out so clearly and cogently the usage and habit of contract and of the constitution Anson performed a notable service for a country and an academic and legal community notoriously hostile to synthesis.<br>
<br>Anson was an active citizen, especially in institutions where state met church; he was chancellor of the diocese of Oxford from 1899 to 1912, a fellow of Eton College, and chairman of the council of Oxford House in Bethnal Green, London (he distrusted the Balliol initiative of Toynbee Hall); he was a trustee of the British Museum and of the National Portrait Gallery and was chairman of Oxfordshire quarter sessions from 1894 to 1914. A spry and always youthful-looking person, Anson suffered &#145;a severe personal loss&#146; by the death on 5 March 1912 of P. F. Willert, his contemporary at Balliol and law tutor at Exeter College, Anson's &#145;dear and intimate friend&#146;, which distressed him greatly: &#145;he was part of one's life and associated with it in so many ways&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 214). Anson died at Oxford on 4 June 1914 after a short illness and was buried locally in Holywell cemetery. A recumbent effigy by John Tweed was placed in All Souls Chapel in 1918. Anson was a substantial benefactor of All Souls and of the Bodleian Library.<br>
