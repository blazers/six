<span class="headword">Verney <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Calvert]</span>, Sir  Harry</span>, second baronet  (1801&#150;1894), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4422/', "General Sir Harry Calvert, first baronet (bap. 1763, d. 1826)")</script>, whose <span class="italic">Journals</span> he published in 1853, and his wife, Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1806), daughter of Thomas Hammersley. He was born on 8 September 1801 and educated at Harrow School; he then went to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he was one of the earliest cadets (1818&#150;19).<br>
<br>Calvert received his commission in the 31st foot, and was sent to Stuttgart at seventeen as attach&eacute; to Sir Brook Taylor's mission, with introductions to the old king's daughters, the queen of W&uuml;rttemberg and the electress of Hesse-Homburg, who entertained him kindly, as did King John of Saxony at Dresden. While abroad he perfected his French and German, and studied Italian. On his return in 1820 he joined the 7th fusiliers at Londonderry; he served also with the 72nd and 52nd regiments, and then entered the Grenadier Guards, where he became adjutant. He acted for a time as Sir Herbert Taylor's private secretary at the Horse Guards.<br>
<br>With the zeal to acquire knowledge which distinguished him throughout life, Calvert put himself to school again when he could obtain leave of absence from his military duties. In 1822 he studied with John Marriott (1780&#150;1825), curate in charge of Broadclyst, to whom he became deeply attached; and while in Devon he laid the foundation of a lifelong friendship with Sir Thomas Acland and his family.<br>
<br>In 1826, after the death of his father, Calvert succeeded to the title. On the death of his cousin Mrs Verney of Claydon House, Buckinghamshire, he assumed the surname Verney in place of Calvert, by royal licence dated 23 March 1827. He found himself owner of an estate heavily burdened and long neglected, at a period of agricultural distress and widespread discontent; giving up his hopes of distinction as a soldier, he prepared to learn the new duties he had assumed with the name of Verney. Before he could settle down as a country squire, however, his father's old friend, Lord William Cavendish Bentinck, was made governor-general of Bengal, and Verney accepted his offer to accompany him as military secretary; but, falling ill on the voyage out, he was left behind at Rio de Janeiro, and never rejoined his chief. He recovered his health by hunting with the Indians and riding wild horses on the pampas; he made a perilous journey across the snow-covered Andes, collected birds and insects, learned Spanish, and threw himself into the politics and wars of the small South American states, narrowly escaping death while helping to put down an insurrection at Santiago. At one time he took part in resisting some fresh claims of the papacy, which an Italian mission had been sent to assert. Years afterwards he was received at the Vatican by the once obscure young priest&#151;by that time the pope&#151;who had been employed in the mission, but Pius IX would allow no reference to the circumstances of their former meeting. After a year of romantic adventures, extending to Chile, Verney sailed round Cape Horn in the <i>Volage</i>, commanded by Michael Seymour, and returned to Claydon in 1829.<br>
<br>In 1835 Verney married Eliza, daughter of Sir George Hope, one of Nelson's captains at Trafalgar; they had four sons and three daughters. At Claydon he proved himself a model landlord. He drained and reclaimed the land, built and repaired cottages, founded schools, planted trees, and, by taking a much more active share in poor-law work and county business than was usual at that time among country squires, raised the tone of quarter sessions, and helped to give greater regularity and publicity to the proceedings. He knew George Stephenson, acquainted himself with the working of the new system of railroads, and, with more foresight than his neighbours, he welcomed railways on his estate when other landowners were ordering their gamekeepers to warn off the surveyors, or to put an end to their operations by force.<br>
<br>When cholera broke out among the duck breeders of Aylesbury in 1832 and panic spread through the town, Sir Harry rendered energetic and fearless service to the sick and dying; later in 1832 he was at Paris during a far more terrible outbreak of cholera, and visited the hospitals. After these experiences he worked arduously to collect funds for a county hospital, the establishment of which at Aylesbury he considered one of the happiest events of his life. During a part of these busy years (1831, 1832, and 1833) Verney was studying at Downing College, Cambridge; being older than the other undergraduates, he lived chiefly with the fellows and tutors, and enjoyed the friendship of Adam Sedgwick and William Whewell.<br>
<br>On 10 December 1832 Verney was elected for Buckingham, for which he sat (with two short interruptions) for fifty-two years. A Liberal in politics, he was an ardent supporter of the abolition of the slave trade, and the repeal of the corn laws; he voted for factory legislation, the amendment of the criminal law, and the abolition of university tests, of Jewish disabilities, and of the paper duties; in later years he supported the disestablishment of the Irish church, the <span class="roman">Elementary Education Act</span>, the abolition of army purchase, and the successive measures for the extension of the franchise. He promoted the social reforms of Lord Shaftesbury, his old schoolfellow at Harrow and close friend; he was an active member of the Bible Society, the Church Missionary Society, and the Evangelical Alliance, and was able to render good service to the foreign protestant churches and pastors whom he loved to visit. In religious opinion he was of the old evangelical school, but his sympathies were broad.<br>
<br>An early member of the Royal Geographical Society, Verney had a remarkable knowledge of geography and a keen interest in every fresh discovery; he attended the Brussels conference on Africa in 1876, when King Leopold gave him his portrait, and afterwards kept up the acquaintance by correspondence. Verney was one of the founders of the Royal Agricultural Society; he attended its jubilee in 1888, when he was welcomed by the prince of Wales as the &#145;father&#146; of the society. Verney's own political jubilee was celebrated at Buckingham in 1883 but the borough was disfranchised in 1885; he was then made a privy councillor.<br>
<br>Verney's first wife died in 1857. He at once married, in 1858, Frances Parthenope Nightingale (1819&#150;1890) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46562/', "Verney, Frances Parthenope")</script>], elder daughter of William Edward Nightingale and sister of Florence Nightingale. It was under Verney's roof at Claydon that Florence Nightingale spent many of her bedridden years. Verney, who remained an active horseman to the last, died at Claydon, aged ninety-two, on 12 February 1894.<br>
