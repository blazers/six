<span class="headword">Holland,  William</span>  (1711&#150;1761), <span class="occ">Moravian leader</span>, was born on 16 January 1711 in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, a son of Nicholas Holland. In March 1725 he was apprenticed to a relation in London, a house-painter. After completing his apprenticeship Holland returned to Wales to visit his relations, but when his former master died he moved back to London to take over the business, becoming a freeman of the City in July 1733.<br>
<br>Holland had joined one of the London religious societies in 1732. In 1736 he became a devotee of the devotional writer William Law, and it was when purchasing books by Law that he met James Hutton, the apprentice of the bookseller who sold them. He joined a new group formed by Hutton, and in April 1738 attended a meeting addressed by the Moravian Peter B&ouml;hler. Holland was out of town on 1 May, when B&ouml;hler formed a Moravian-style band which was to become the Fetter Lane Society. Later that month he showed Luther's <span class="italic">Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians</span> to Charles Wesley and had an experience of liberation as Wesley read the preface aloud. Holland now joined one of the new bands stemming from B&ouml;hler's. Holland has been identified with the &#145;one&#146; whose reading of Luther's <span class="italic">Preface to the Epistle to the Romans</span> occasioned John Wesley's &#145;heartwarming&#146; experience.<br>
<br>Holland remained in the Fetter Lane Society after John Wesley withdrew, and in March 1741 the Moravians assumed its leadership. On 31 March 1741 he married Elizabeth (1710&#150;1780), daughter of Peter and Elizabeth Delamotte and sister of the Moravian evangelist William Delamotte. Elizabeth had, in the previous year, refused a proposal of marriage from George Whitefield. She and Holland had six children, of whom four predeceased their father and only one daughter outlived their mother.<br>
<br>Elected one of two new society stewards in August 1741, Holland liquidated his large house-painting business in September to become a full-time &#145;labourer&#146;, moving from Basinghall Street to a room in the Moravians' headquarters in Little Wild Street. He was received into the Moravian church when its first English congregation was established in May 1742, and when the London congregation was founded in October 1742 Holland became its elder. In October 1743 he replaced the disaffected Richard Viney as warden of the Yorkshire congregation.<br>
<br>In 1744 Holland himself became dissatisfied, sympathizing with Viney, and from August 1744 another dispute arose, over a decision that the Moravians should register their places of worship as dissenting meeting-houses. Holland was a leading opponent of this, arguing that it was contrary to the assurance which he had secured in 1742 that Anglicans received into the Moravian church could remain members of the Church of England. Eventually he acquiesced in registration under the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span>, but he held out, ultimately alone, against acceptance of the term &#145;dissenter&#146;. In 1745 he was relieved of his office and summoned to Germany, leaving with his wife in September. In Germany he wrote an important account of the early years of the English revival to support his views.<br>
<br>After returning to England, Holland attended a Moravian general synod in the Netherlands in May 1746. He returned in August, and in November was sent on a mission to Wales. On his return in March 1747 he was re-admitted to the leadership's conference and sent temporarily to supervise work in Wiltshire. Back in London from July, Holland seems to have attempted to conform to the distinctive spirituality then prevailing in the Moravian church, but to no avail. In October 1747 he was told to cease preaching and resume his trade, and in December he withdrew from the Moravian church.<br>
<br>Holland now associated with, but did not join, the Wesleys. Instead he returned to the communion of the Church of England and mainly attended the preaching of evangelical clergy. His wife remained a Moravian, and her mother, Elizabeth Delamotte, who lived with the Hollands at the Rolls Buildings in Fetter Lane, became one. Holland supplied information to the anti-Moravian pamphleteer Henry Rimius in 1755, but he later became more friendly towards the Moravians, and in the later 1750s his eldest son was apprenticed to a leading Yorkshire Moravian. William Holland died suddenly of a stroke at his home in Fetter Lane on 23 February 1761.<br>
