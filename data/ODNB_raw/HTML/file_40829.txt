<span class="headword">Russell,  Thomas Baron</span>  (1865&#150;1931), <span class="occ">advertising consultant</span>, was born on 15 November 1865 at 12 Avenue Terrace, Avenue Road, Camberwell, London, the son of Thomas Russell, librarian of a circulating library, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Everett. Russell's father encouraged the boy's reading and he developed a love of literature which he intended to pursue at university, but was prevented by his father's serious illness. He was obliged to leave school and, after several jobs, in January 1882 obtained a post with John Morgan Richards Ltd, a firm of importing chemists.<br>
<br>Morgan Richards was an importer of American patent medicines and the firm's success depended on advertising. In his twenty-three years with the firm, Russell gained practical experience in this side of their business, both at home and on his business trips to the USA, Canada, India, and Australia. He created the memorable advertisements for Carter's Little Liver Pills. Aware of the influence of advertising magazines, he wrote regularly for the American <span class="italic">Printer's Ink</span>, under the editorship of his friend John Irving Romer, and from 1901 in the new <span class="italic">Advertising World</span> edited by William Ewert Berry. Russell disapproved of the way in which the advertising business was then organized, with agents receiving commission from the newspaper, the vendor of space, rather than from the advertiser. He urged that advertisers should pay a net rate, free of all discounts and commissions, and that the agents should receive an agreed fee.<br>
<br>In 1905 Russell was persuaded by Horace Hooper, the paper's new advertising director, to join <span class="italic">The Times</span> as its advertising manager. During his three years at the newspaper, Russell inaugurated the Times Book Club and increased the amount of illustrated display advertising. He was the originator of <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s &#145;gold brick&#146; advertisements, whose information, having been researched by <span class="italic">Times</span> staff, was held up as reliable. When Hooper bought the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> from Adam and Charles Black, Russell cultivated a new readership by selling it in instalments and by mail order. After he left <span class="italic">The Times</span> he organized the promotion of other books and encyclopaedias.<br>
<br>In 1910 Russell set himself up as an advertising consultant&#151;arguably the first such in Britain. In contrast to agents, who bought advertising space on behalf of their clients, the consultant was paid by fee or annual retainer to prepare the advertising material and generally advise on aspects of the business&#151;in Russell's words, &#145;functioning exactly as a consulting physician&#146;  (Nevett, 108). The Incorporated Society of Advertisement Consultants, which he founded in 1910 and presided over for twenty-one years, prescribed the codes of conduct and standards expected of its members. He was later involved with the Publicity Club, and was the first recipient of its cup, awarded for distinguished services to advertising.<br>
<br>Respected for his high standards and personal integrity, Russell was often hired to arbitrate on disputes in the advertising field. He was one of the first professionals to venture into the political arena: the Liberal Party hired him in 1910, and during the First World War he advised a government committee on recruiting campaigns and was also involved with advertising the War Loan of 1915. After the war he delivered the first lectures on advertising to be delivered as a university course at the London School of Economics. Ill health forced his retirement in 1931. He died at his home, Highwood, Batts Corner, Binsted Road, near Farnham, Surrey, on 31 December 1931. He was survived by his wife, Olga Hutteman, and by their three sons and three daughters.<br>
