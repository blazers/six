<span class="headword">Wigham,  John Richardson</span>  (1829&#150;1906), <span class="occ">engineer and inventor of gas lighting for lighthouses</span>, was born on 15 January 1829 at 5 South Gray Street, Edinburgh, the youngest of three sons (there were three daughters) of John Wigham (<i>c</i>.1784&#150;1864), shawl manufacturer, of Edinburgh and his wife, Jane Richardson (<i>d</i>. 1830); his father was a member of the Society of Friends. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55216/', "Eliza Wigham")</script>, the women's activist, was his sister. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55216/', "Eliza Wigham")</script> was his elder sister. Following meagre schooling at Edinburgh, he went in 1843 to Dublin, where he continued his studies privately while serving as apprentice to his brother-in-law, Joshua Edmundson, who ran a hardware and manufacturing business. The business subsequently traded as Joshua Edmundson &amp; Co. and then transferred to Wigham's control on the death of Edmundson.<br>
<br>With Wigham as chairman, Edmundson's Electricity Corporation grew rapidly; a branch was opened in London and taken over by a separate company. In Dublin the firm devoted itself largely to experiments in gas-lighting and Wigham was particularly successful in designing small gasworks suitable for private houses and public institutions. In addition to his private business he held various engineering posts, and as engineer to the Commercial Gas Company of Ireland he designed the gasworks at Kingstown (later D&uacute;n Laoghaire). Wigham also played a prominent part in the commercial life of Dublin. He was a director of the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company from 1866 until his death; director and vice-chairman of the Dublin United Tramways Company from 1881 to his death; and a member of council (1879), secretary (1881&#150;93), and eventually president (1894&#150;6) of the Dublin chamber of commerce. Wigham was married, on 4 August 1858, to Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52716/', "Jonathan Pim")</script> of Dublin, MP for Dublin City from 1865 to 1874; they had six sons and four daughters, of whom three sons and three daughters survived him.<br>
<br>Wigham is remembered mainly as the inventor of important applications of gas to lighthouse illumination. In 1863 he was granted a small sum for experiments by the commissioners of Irish lights, and in 1865 a system invented by him was installed at the Baily lighthouse on Howth Head near Dublin. The gas was manufactured on the spot and the system's main advantages were that it dispensed with the lamp glass essential to the four-wick Fresnel oil lamp of 240 candle-power, in use from 1835, and that the power of the light could readily be increased or decreased: a 28 jet flame, which gave sufficient light for clear weather, could be increased successively to a 48 jet, 68 jet, 88 jet, or 108 jet flame&#151;2923 candle-power&#151;on foggy nights. Although highly valued in Ireland, the system was condemned on trial by Thomas Stevenson, engineer to the Scottish northern lights board. It was made more effective, however, by Wigham's invention of a powerful composite burner in 1868, and in 1869 its further employment in Ireland was strongly advocated by John Tyndall in his capacity as scientific adviser to Trinity House and the Board of Trade. Wigham's ingenuity also acted as a powerful stimulant to rival patentees and led to various improvements in oil apparatus by Sir James Nicholas Douglass and others.<br>
<br>In 1871 Wigham invented the first of the many group-flashing arrangements which enabled mariners to distinguish between different lighthouses. His arrangement was adopted at Galley Head, Mew Head, and Tory Island off the Irish coast. In 1872 a triform light of his invention was installed experimentally at the High lighthouse, Happisburgh, Norfolk; but its further adoption in English lighthouses was discouraged by a committee of Trinity House in 1874. The Irish lights board, however, continued to favour Wigham's system, and in 1878 they installed at Galley Head a powerful quadriform light with four tiers of superposed lenses and a 68 jet burner in the focus of each tier. In 1883 the Board of Trade appointed a lighthouse illuminants committee to consider the relative merits of gas, oil, and electric light. For some years Tyndall had felt that Sir James Douglass had used his influence as engineer to Trinity House for the furtherance of his own patents, to the disadvantage of Wigham's system. He now protested that, as rival patentees, Douglass and Wigham ought both to be members of the lighthouse illuminants committee or ought both to be excluded. His objection was overruled, and consequently he resigned his position as scientific adviser to the Board of Trade in March 1883. A bitter controversy followed in the press between Tyndall and Joseph Chamberlain, president of the Board of Trade. On Tyndall's resignation the lighthouse illuminants committee collapsed. A new committee, of which Douglass was a member, was appointed by Trinity House and, after extensive experiments at South Foreland, it decided to recommend oil and electric light in preference to gas. Wigham protested against his lack of opportunity to demonstrate the advantages of his system, and claimed that his rival Douglass, who had condemned in official reports Wigham's invention of superposed lenses, afterwards employed them for the improvement of his own oil apparatus. Wigham eventually received &pound;2500 from the Board of Trade as compensation for the infringement of his patent. Among Wigham's other inventions were a device for fog signals; a gas-driven siren; a &#145;sky-flashing arrangement&#146; and a &#145;continuous pulsating light&#146; in connection with his system of gas illumination for lighthouses; and a lighted buoy or beacon in which, using oil as the illuminant, he obtained, by imparting motion to the wick, a continuous light needing attention only once in thirty days.<br>
<br>Wigham was a member of the Royal Dublin Society and of the Royal Irish Academy, an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and a fellow of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. He read papers on gas as a lighthouse illuminant and related subjects before the Society of Arts, the British Association, the Royal Dublin Society, and the Shipmasters' Society. In politics he was a unionist and a member of the Irish Unionist Alliance, and he spoke at public meetings against Gladstone's <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span>. He was also one of the leaders of the temperance movement in Dublin. As a member of the Society of Friends (the Quakers) he twice refused knighthood in 1887. He died on 16 November 1906 at his residence, Albany House, Monkstown, co. Dublin, after four years of ill health. He was buried on 19 November in the Quaker burial-ground, Temple Hill, Blackrock, co. Dublin. He was survived by his wife.<br>
