<span class="headword">Bathurst,  Charles</span>, first Viscount Bledisloe  (1867&#150;1958), <span class="occ">agriculturist and politician</span>, was born in London on 21 September 1867, the second but first surviving son of the barrister Charles Bathurst (1836&#150;1907), of Lydney Park, Gloucestershire, where he owned 4000 acres of land, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1885), only daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Pasley Hay. He was educated at Sherborne School, at Eton College, and at University College, Oxford, where he obtained third classes in classical honour moderations in 1888 and in jurisprudence in 1890. In 1892 he was called to the bar by the Inner Temple, and for a time practised in the Chancery Division as a conveyancing barrister. As heir to the family estate after the death of his elder brother in 1883 Bathurst attended the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, from 1893 to 1896 to equip himself for his inheritance and, as it turned out, for his career. At Cirencester he edited the college magazine, won the Ducie gold medal, and as one of the college's most famous old students was later chairman of its board of governors from 1919 to 1925; it became customary for estate management students to visit his Lydney estate to study its management and its farming. It is likely that while at Cirencester he formed the view that the one hope for the future of agriculture in Britain was for the landowners to become professional, businesslike, and efficient managers. This became his persistent message. On 17 December 1898 he married Bertha Susan (<i>d</i>. 1926), fifth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17009/', "Henry Charles Lopes, first Baron Ludlow")</script>, himself the third son of a Devonshire landed magnate and a prominent judge; this marriage reflected Bathurst's alignment with the professional wing of the landed class. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Rather unexpectedly the crushing defeat of the Unionists in the 1906 election created the opening for Bathurst to enter politics. Walter Long, the Unionists' leading country gentleman, decided that one way of containing the anti-landlord effects of that defeat was to mobilize the landowners in an effective organization, and in 1907 he took the lead in forming the Central Land Association (CLA); he seems to have been responsible for recruiting Bathurst as the first honorary secretary of the CLA. He was very successful in this post, and steered membership of the new association to over 1000 by 1909, when he resigned. It also provided him with close contacts with leading tories, which helped him become MP for the Wilton division of Wiltshire in the January 1910 election. He wished to make the CLA into a non-party pressure group representing landowners of every political colour, but was frustrated by its domination by tories and by the hysterical anti-Liberalism of the CLA's allies in the Land Union.<br>
<br>Enjoying the patronage of Milner and Steel-Maitland, Bathurst quickly established himself in alliance with Christopher Turnor as one of the Conservatives' leading agricultural reformers in the Commons and a key contributor to mounting a defence against Lloyd George's land campaign of 1912&#150;14. He and Turnor, together with B. Peto and C. Mills, formed a group of radical agricultural reformers, at times acting as a private inquiry committee and at times as an agricultural policy subcommittee of the Unionist Social Reform Committee. They attempted, with no great success, to formulate a Conservative counter to the land campaign, which was perceived as threatening to undermine the Conservatives' rural vote. Unable to agree on any convincing riposte to the Liberals' promise of a minimum wage for agricultural labourers, the reform group did strongly advocate a grant-aided scheme for assisting tenant farmers to become owners. Although this did not find favour with either the old guard of tory landed grandees who regarded it as a recipe for dismantling the great estates, or with the traditional gentry who denied that their workers were badly paid, it did lead Henry Chaplin to hail Bathurst as the &#145;most promising ally of the agricultural interest that we have had in Parliament now for some time&#146;  (Fforde, 64).<br>
<br>By 1914 Bathurst had achieved a high reputation, and some enemies, within the Conservative Party, but little in the way of agricultural advance. By 1915, as chairman of the central chamber of agriculture, he was recording his &#145;conviction that upon the well-being of Great Britain's oldest industry depend the ultimate economic welfare of her people, their physical and mental virility&#146;, and virtually welcoming the war, on the grounds that:<blockquote>the Great European War may&#151;and God grant that it will&#151;cause the nation at large to realise the wisdom, and the ultimate economy, if not the necessity, of making Britain more self-contained in the matter of food production for her teeming population. (A. H. H. Matthews, &#145;Preface&#146; to <span class="italic">Fifty Years of Agricultural Politics: the History of the Central Chamber of Agriculture</span>, 1915, vii, x)</blockquote>How far the war was good for British agriculture, as distinct from the incomes of British farmers, may be questionable, but it definitely helped Bathurst's career. In 1916 he became the spokesman in the Commons for the new Ministry of Food when he was appointed parliamentary secretary to the food controller, Lord Devenport, whom he succeeded as chairman of the royal commission on sugar supply in 1917, when he was also appointed KBE. He was director of sugar distribution from 1918 to 1919, and confirmed his position as a leading member alongside R. E. Prothero (Lord Ernle) of the official agricultural interest by serving from 1917 to 1920 as chairman of the federation of county war agricultural executive committees, the bodies which induced or cajoled farmers into applying agricultural policies at the farm level.<br>
<br>In October 1918 Bathurst was rewarded for his war services with a peerage and took the title of Baron Bledisloe from the hundred in which the family seat of Lydney lies. With his experience and public standing he seemed an excellent choice for a post-war president in 1921&#150;2 of the CLA (by then called the Central Landowners' Association), but raised hackles among the grandees by publicly calling, in 1922, for the larger landowners to renounce their passive and unenterprising attitudes of the previous sixty years, abandon their ineffective attachment to a property defence league which merely stimulated revolutionary propaganda, and place themselves at the head of the agricultural industry as professional managers of the resources of the land, co-operating with the farmers and farm workers. From the conventional landowner's point of view this was only slightly less subversive than the position of his friend and fellow landowner Turnor, who spoke at this time of sixty years of failure by government to grasp the importance of agriculture and of neglect by rich and complacent landowners who did not understand their own business. It was a precursor of Bledisloe's call in 1929 for permanent regulation of farm rents by compulsory valuation as the only alternative to land nationalization. He saw this as a way of removing the fundamental objection to all government aid to agriculture, that the benefits of such aid would ultimately go to the landlords who were not the wealth producers or employers. This radical outburst earned him a formal rebuke from the CLA. In politics also he steered an idiosyncratic and radical course. Initially, with his peerage, a Lloyd George adherent, he was reconciled to the Conservatives to the extent of becoming a member of the government's agricultural advisory committee in 1922, but did not fully rejoin the party until accepting office as parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture in Baldwin's second administration, 1924&#150;8. In 1927 he served as chairman of the royal commission on land drainage, which recommended drastic rationalization of the 365 separate drainage authorities then responsible for the management of rivers in England and Wales. In the interval it had not been implausible for Ramsay MacDonald to consider inviting him to become minister of agriculture in the first Labour government, although in the event the approach was not made.<br>
<br>In June 1929, however, Bledisloe accepted from MacDonald appointment as governor-general of New Zealand; he took up the post in March 1930 and &#145;proved to be perhaps the most popular representative of the Crown who has ever been appointed to the Dominion&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 4 July 1958, 12). Aristocratic affability, seriously knowledgeable enthusiasm for farming, and a keen interest in livestock&#151;and his purchase and restoration of the neglected site of the signing of the Waitangi treaty in 1840, which he subsequently gave to the nation&#151;combined to this end. His first wife having died in 1926, on 16 April 1928 Bledisloe married Alina Kate Elaine (<i>d</i>. 1956), younger daughter of John Jones Jenkins, the first Baron Glantawe, a south Wales tinplate manufacturer, and widow of Thomas Cooper Cooper-Smith. The charm of his second wife made an essential contribution to the success of his governorship. On its conclusion in June 1935 he received a step in the peerage, becoming Viscount Bledisloe. The concluding official activity of Bledisloe's career was to serve as chairman of the royal commission on the closer union of the two Rhodesias and Nyasaland, which reported in March 1939 in favour of a union. The report circumspectly added the qualification that, as the natives of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland had good reason to fear the application of the Southern Rhodesian pass laws, it was for the present impossible to contemplate 68,000 white people governing 4 million natives; the government which enacted the federation in 1953 was not so cautious. Bledisloe's sympathies, although he had gone out of his way to encourage Maori farmers during his time in New Zealand, were clearly with the white population, as he showed in his two goodwill tours in 1947 and 1948 of Australasia and of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, which he made on behalf of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, of which he had been president in 1946.<br>
<br>Bledisloe was also president or chairman of the British Dairy Farmers' Association, the Bath and West of England Agricultural Society, the Farmers' Club, and the Lawes Agricultural Trust, Rothamsted, but perhaps his strongest loyalty, after his attachment to the Lydney estate, was to the Forest of Dean, of which he was verderer from 1897 until his death on 3 July 1958, at Lydney Park; he was buried four days later at St Mary's, Lydney. He was succeeded by his elder son, Benjamin Ludlow (1899&#150;1979).<br>
