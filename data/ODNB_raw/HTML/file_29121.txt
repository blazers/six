<span class="headword">Weston, Sir  Francis</span>  (1511&#150;1536), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29124/', "Sir Richard Weston (c.1465&#150;1541)")</script> and his wife, Anne Sandys. He followed his father to court, where by 1526 he was a page. A contemporary French account attributes his rise to favour to his skill at games and his good graces and manners. Weston frequently appears in the privy purse accounts as receiving small sums of money from the king. In 1530 he won a total of sixteen angels by winning four times against Henry at tennis, and at other times the king also lost to him at dice, bowls, &#145;imperiall&#146;, and &#145;pope Julius's game&#146;. His closeness to the king was acknowledged in 1532 when he was made a gentleman of the privy chamber, while in 1533 he was appointed governor of Guernsey jointly with his father. In May 1533, during the festivities of Anne Boleyn's coronation, he was made a knight of the Bath.<br>
<br>Among the games at which Weston excelled were those associated with courtly love. In May 1530 he had married Anne, daughter and heir of Sir Christopher Pickering of Killington, Cumberland. It may be significant, however, that in the 1550s George Cavendish remembered him as one &#145;That wantonly lyved without feare and dreade &hellip; Followyng his fantzy and his wanton lust&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Wolsey</span>, 30). On 18 May 1535 Queen Anne took him to task for neglecting his wife, and for flirting with Margaret Shelton, possibly an old flame of the king's who was then being pursued by Henry Norris, the groom of the stool. Weston replied that Norris came to the queen's chamber more for Anne than for his intended bride, and capped this by saying that he himself loved someone in her household better than either his wife or Margaret. When the queen asked him who that was, he replied &#145;it ys your self, and then she defyed hym&#146;&#151;quelled his impudence  (ibid., 452). The role of the courtier who proposes to the great lady who rejects him with scorn was part of the courtly love convention, but in the sexually charged and suspicious atmosphere of Henry VIII's court it was a dangerous one for Weston to play.<br>
<br>How dangerous became clear the following year. On 1 May 1536 Queen Anne was arrested on a charge of adultery, and soon afterwards, in the hearing of Sir William Kingston, the constable of the Tower, she told of Weston's heavy-handed flirtation of the previous year. Consequently Weston was himself arrested, probably on the 5th, and taken to the Tower. He had links with opponents of Thomas Cromwell, who was probably glad of an excuse to strike at him. On 12 May he and three others were brought to trial in Westminster Hall, where it was claimed that Anne had given money to Weston and the others accused, as she had done to many of the commonly penurious young courtiers, gifts which were now interpreted as tokens of a treasonable contract. Weston pleaded not guilty both to treason and to charges of adultery with Anne at Whitehall and Greenwich in May and June 1534. But despite efforts to save him by his family and by the French ambassador, Jean de Dinteville, he was condemned to death. The sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering at Tyburn was commuted by royal mercy to beheading on Tower Hill.<br>
<br>Weston was executed on 17 May 1536. That he then failed to protest his innocence was conventional, for royal mercy could be withdrawn and friends and family might suffer. Instead he declared that his fate was a warning to others not to presume on life's continuance, &#145;for I had thought to have lived in abomination yet this twenty or thirty years and to have made amends&#146;  (Ives, 392). He had written a farewell letter to his parents, one which sums up the tragically curtailed life of a rather shallow young man caught out of his depth. He left debts totalling &pound;925 7<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>., which he asked his parents to pay&#151;his creditors included his draper, embroiderer, tailor, goldsmith, shoemaker, barber, and saddler. He was buried outside the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower. The poet Sir Thomas Wyatt, himself under arrest in the Tower, but released after Anne's execution thanks to Cromwell's protection, wrote a lament in prison over the dead, Weston among them:<blockquote>
<div>Ah! Weston, Weston, that pleasant was and young,<br>
</div>
<div>In active things who might with thee compare?<br>
</div>
<div>All words accept that thou diddest speak with tongue,<br>
</div>
<div>So well esteemed with each where thou diddest fare.<br>
</div>
<div>And we that now in court doth lead our life<br>
</div>
<div>Most part in mind doth thee lament and moan:<br>
</div>
<div>But that thy faults we daily hear so rife,<br>
</div>
<div>All we should weep that thou are dead and gone.<br>
</div> (Wyatt, 192)</blockquote>
