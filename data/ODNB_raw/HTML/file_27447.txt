<span class="headword">Tillinghast,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1604, <em>d.</em> 1655), <span class="occ">Fifth Monarchist</span>, was baptized on 25 September 1604 at Streat, Sussex, the son of John Tyllinghast (<i>d</i>. 1624), rector of Streat. After attending grammar school at Newport, Essex, Tillinghast entered Caius College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 24 March 1621. He graduated BA in 1625, and was ordained deacon and priest at Bristol on 2 April of the same year. He became rector of Tarring Neville, Sussex, on 30 July 1636, and then of Streat on 29 September 1637. In the sermon <span class="italic">Demetrius his Opposition to Reformation</span> (1642), dedicated to the countess of Holland, Lady Beaudesert, and his uncle, the future regicide <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27430/', "Robert Tichborne")</script>, Tillinghast stressed the need to continue the work of reformation and denounced illegal taxation, the subversion of the kingdom's fundamental laws, innovations in church and state, and Anabaptists, Familists, and other sectaries for endangering the Reformation. He also warned that dissension in the church normally led to divisions in the state. By late 1650 Tillinghast had become an Independent and joined the congregational church at Syleham, Suffolk. Called on 22 January 1651 by the Independent church at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, to assist William Bridge, he accepted on 4 February. The Independent churches at Fressingfield and Walpole, Suffolk, also sought his services. Tillinghast left Great Yarmouth in early 1652 to accept the rectorship of Trunch, Norfolk. Shortly thereafter, he began writing the first part of <span class="italic">Generation Work</span>, which he addressed to parliament on 8 July 1653, and also to the saints, urging them to unify in order not to obstruct the work of reformation. If parliament ignored its reforming duties, he warned, God would overthrow it.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Knowledge of the Times</span> (1654) and the second and third parts of <span class="italic">Generation Work</span> (both 1654) Tillinghast distinguished himself as the only Fifth Monarchist capable of systematically expounding the prophetic texts on which the group's millenarian tenets were based. He was influenced by John Owen, whose sermon to parliament on 24 October 1651, <span class="italic">The Advantage of the Kingdome of Christ in the Shaking of the Kingdoms of the World</span> (1652), he had read. In <span class="italic">Knowledge of the Times</span> Tillinghast laid out the chronology of the end times, averring that the papacy would collapse in 1656 and that the millennium would commence in 1701. In the second part of <span class="italic">Generation Work</span> he interpreted the seven vials of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 16 in a historical context, identifying the first with Luther's reforms; the second with the Long Parliament's repudiation of episcopacy; the third with the execution of Charles, the overthrow of the Long Parliament, the Fronde, and the mid-century conflict in the Netherlands; and the fourth with the Holy Roman empire's collapse. The fifth vial would bring the fall of the Catholic church, the sixth the demise of the Ottoman empire, and the seventh the battle of Armageddon preparatory to the Jews' conversion and Christ's return. At this point, he contended, the millennium would commence, the conclusion of which would bring the last judgment.<br>
<br>In a late sermon published posthumously, Tillinghast stressed that the second coming was imminent, for a key sign of the end times was &#145;the Defection and Apostacy of Eminent leading men in the Churches, from their first light and Principles&#146;  (J. Tillinghast, <span class="italic">Mr. Tillinghasts Eight Last Sermons</span>, 1655, 95). God's present work, he asserted, was the overthrow of &#145;lofty men&#146; as well as Antichrist  (ibid., 219). The attack on the government in these sermons marked a major change in Tillinghast's position, for he had dedicated the third part of <span class="italic">Generation Work</span>, with its explication of the two witnesses' prophecies in <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 11, to Cromwell, but by June 1655 he had turned sharply against the lord protector. He was probably influenced by the leading London Fifth Monarchist Christopher Feake, who was then imprisoned at Windsor, where Tillinghast visited him. Feake likened Tillinghast to Apollo because of his interest in prophecy. Thereafter Tillinghast went to London, where the Independent minister Nathaniel Brewster took him to see Cromwell. Tillinghast reproached Cromwell for his reputed abominations, prompting cries of &#145;shame&#146; from onlookers offended by his language. Cromwell reported the incident to Charles Fleetwood. Tillinghast had intended to visit other incarcerated saints, but he died in London by the end of June. Bridge's son-in-law, Richard Lawrence, succeeded Tillinghast at Trunch.<br>
<br>Tillinghast's wife, Mary Flight, had died before him. In his will, dated 6 June 1655 and proved on 27 November 1655, Tillinghast left his only surviving daughter, Mary, &pound;136 and his household goods. The will had been witnessed by his kinsman Benjamin Tillinghast and the radical bookseller Livewell Chapman, and the executors were the Suffolk Independents John Manning, rector of Sibton-cum-Peasenhall, and his brother Samuel Manning, rector of Cookley-cum-Walpole.<br>
<br>Feake moved quickly to publish <span class="italic">Mr. Tillinghasts Eight Last Sermons</span>, the epistle to which he dated 2 August 1655. Among the sermons were two on signs of the times, one on the fifth monarchy, and another on the period's evils. Reflecting the appeal of Tillinghast's works beyond the Fifth Monarchists, in December 1656 the Independent ministers Samuel Petto and John Manning finished editing Tillinghast's <span class="italic">Six Severall Treatises</span> (1657), a collection of sermons on such themes as Christ's promises, the life of faith, and Jesus' commandment to love one another. In 1658 Petto and the Congregationalist minister Samuel Habergham, a Fifth Monarchist, issued Tillinghast's <span class="italic">Elijah's Mantle</span>. Although Tillinghast's life was marked by his mid-career embrace of Independent polity and Fifth Monarchist tenets, two key threads provided unifying themes throughout his ministry: a strong commitment to further reform and an international perspective. Sensitive in <span class="italic">Demetrius</span> to the persecution of protestants throughout much of Europe, in his later works he urged missionary work as far afield as Turkey and India, and prophesied protestant military victories over the Catholic states, the papacy, and the Turks.<br>
