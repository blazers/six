<span class="headword">Aucher,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1619, <em>d.</em> 1701), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized at Bishopsbourne, Kent, on 28 October 1619, a younger son of Sir Anthony Aucher of Hautsborne in the same county, and his wife, Hester, daughter and coheir of Peter Collett of London. In 1634 Archbishop Laud nominated Aucher to a Canterbury scholarship at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he matriculated the following year. He graduated BA in 1640, took up a fellowship at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1640 and proceeded MA in 1641. His royalism led to his ejection from Peterhouse in 1645. In 1650 he weighed into the controversy over the engagement, the declaration of obedience to the new regime, when he published anonymously <span class="italic">Arguments and Reasons to Prove the Inconvenience and Unlawfulness of Taking the New Engagement</span>.<br>
<br>At the Restoration the masters of Peterhouse and its neighbour Queen's College wrote to the government in June 1660 arguing that Aucher, Isaac Barrow, John Barwick, and William Chamberlain were<blockquote>constant sufferers for their Conscience &amp; Loyalty ever since the beginning of the Warr, and particularly having been ejected &amp; excluded from the University of Cambridge &amp; hindered from taking their Degree of Doctors, of which they were capable by the Statutes &amp; orders of the University many years since, are now by us for their Conversation, Learning &amp; Services in the Church, thought every way meete &amp; worthy of such their degrees and of all favours &amp; dispensations whereby they may att this time bee admitted thereto. (TNA: PRO, SP 29/4/96)</blockquote>Aucher was created DD by royal mandate soon afterwards. In June 1660 he petitioned for a prebend in Canterbury Cathedral, and was appointed canon of the sixth prebend on 9 July, a position he held until his death. In 1661 he was restored to his fellowship at Peterhouse. In a letter to Secretary of State Sir Edward Nicholas, dated 19 October 1661, he styled himself &#145;Vice-Dean&#146; of Canterbury Cathedral  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/43/53). He was rector of Westbere in Kent between 1661 and 1681, and of All Hallows, Lombard Street, London, between 1663 and 1685.<br>
<br>In 1684 Aucher published <span class="italic">The Arraignment of Rebellion, or, The Irresistibility of Sovereign Powers</span>. Aucher claimed that this book had been written &#145;in the time of Oliver's Usurpation&#146; and that his &#145;honoured Friend and acquaintance&#146; Dr Henry Hammond had encouraged him to publish it. He then apparently went to London and approached two stationers, who declined it as &#145;too hot &hellip; too heavy; too dangerous&#146; to publish  (Aucher, <span class="italic">Arraignment</span>, sig. A3<i>v</i>). He returned home and apparently forgot about the manuscript until 30 January 1683 (the anniversary of the execution of Charles I), when, &#145;searching for a Paper I had formerly writ on the occasion of that sad day, These likewise fell into my hands&#146;  (ibid., sig. A4<i>r</i>). He then showed the manuscript to &#145;a Learned, and Judicious Neighbour&#146;  (ibid.) who told him &#145;that these times having likewise a strong tendency to Rebellion, nothing that had been said, or could be said, on that point, would be unfit, or unseasonable to obstruct against it&#146;  (ibid.). Aucher's book, which had originally been intended as an attack on the regicides, was, therefore, like Filmer's <span class="italic">Patriarchia</span>, published as part of the tory reaction against the whigs.<br>
<br>Aucher died in Canterbury on 12 March 1701 and was buried in the cathedral. He left &pound;80 a year &#145;for ever for the Maintenance of Clergymen's Widows&#146;  (Barwick, 283). A second edition of <span class="italic">The Arraignment of Rebellion</span> appeared in 1718.<br>
