<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walmesley,  Charles</span>  (1722&#150;1797), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic of the western district and mathematician</span>, born on 13 January 1722 at Wigan Lane House, Standish, Lancashire, was the seventh son of John Walmesley of Westwood House, and his wife, Mary, daughter of William Greaves. He was educated in the English Benedictine college of St Gregory at Douai, and in the English Benedictine monastery of St Edmund at Paris, where he was clothed in the habit on 28 September 1738 and made his profession as a monk of the Benedictine order on 29 September 1739. At the Sorbonne he took his master's degree in 1742, and his licentiate in theology in 1750 was followed by a DD. Such degrees allowed him to hold the benefice of St Marcel, near Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne. He held the office of prior from 1749 until 1753, founding a literary and scientific society for the community and its lay associates. He was criticized, however, for his undue preoccupation with his mathematical studies. In 1754 he went to Rome as the English Benedictine <i>procurator in curia</i>, his main task being the defence of the monks' privileges against the incursions of the secular clergy. It was during this time that he probably visited Mount Etna for purposes of scientific investigation.<br>
<br>Walmesley's election as coadjutor, to Bishop Laurence York, vicar apostolic of the western district of England, with the right to succeed, was made by the <i>propaganda fide</i> on 6 April 1756, and was approved by the pope on 2 May. He was consecrated at Rome with the title of bishop of Rama, <i>in partibus</i>, on 21 December 1756. He administered the vicariate from Bath after the retirement of Bishop York in 1763, and succeeded to the vicariate on the death of his predecessor in 1770.<br>
<br>While administering the vicariate Walmesley continued to be involved in directing Benedictine studies, and drew up a course of studies for junior monks which recommended the study of contemporary scientists and philosophers. His own passion for Newtonian science was reflected in his most popular work, <span class="italic">The General History of the Christian Church &hellip; by Sig. Pastorini</span> (1770), a commentary on the book of <span class="roman">Revelation</span> which secured his gloomy prophecies about the future on a foundation of Newtonian theory. His <span class="italic">Ezekiel's Vision Explained</span> (1778) contained a similar message. He believed his forebodings were confirmed in the destruction caused by the Gordon riots in 1780, when his property, papers, and the bulk of his library were destroyed at Bath. Among his possessions that were burned were his scientific papers. By 1747 he had become involved in the debate then being held among astronomers in Paris over &#145;the problem of the Three Bodies&#146;. In December 1748 he attempted to persuade Alexis-Claude Clairaut (1713&#150;1765), by means of Newtonian mathematics, about the source of the discrepancy in calculating the motion of the moon's apse. He followed this up with a book, <span class="italic">Th&eacute;orie du mouvement des apsides en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, et en particulier des apsides de l'orbite de la lune</span> (1749; English trans., 1754), based on Isaac Newton's propositions and a theorem of John Machin. Although he showed some skill in integrating these, the book also included some questionable assumptions. In 1749 he published his translation of the <span class="italic">Harmonia mensurarum</span> of Roger Cotes under the title <span class="italic">Analyse des mesures, des rapports et des angles</span>, the importance of which lay in transmitting to Europe a set of rules for carrying out numerical integrations, and hence was cited by the astronomer Roger Boscovich SJ. His work on Newton's theory of fluxions brought Walmesley some fame, and in 1750 he became a fellow of the Royal Society of Berlin and the Royal Society of London. It was at this time that he seems to have been involved in the discussions on the adoption of the Gregorian calendar. Between 1756 and 1761 he published a series of papers on astronomy in the Royal Society of London's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. During the 1750s he was also attempting to derive the precession of the equinoxes and the nutation through the use of Newtonian geometry. In 1758 his book <span class="italic">De inaequalitatibus motuum lunarium</span> was published in Florence, and he presented a copy in 1761 to Thomas Birch, secretary of the Royal Society. Walmesley is reputed to have turned his back on scientific investigation when he found himself one day tracing geometric diagrams with the paten during mass.<br>
<br>Following his cautious acceptance of the 1778 <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Act</span>, Walmesley signed his name to the &#145;protestation&#146; of the Catholic Committee, objecting to the term &#145;protesting Catholic dissenters&#146; found in the oath which followed on from the &#145;protestation&#146;. Henceforth, he became the principal episcopal champion of the party opposed to the Cisalpines, who sought further measures of relief from the English government in return for the loyalty of Catholics. He continued this struggle until his death at Bath on 25 November 1797. He was buried at St Joseph's Chapel, Trenchard Street, Bristol, where Charles Plowden inscribed an epitaph on his tomb. In 1906 his remains were transferred to Downside Abbey church, Bath, where a new monument carried a Latin epitaph by Bishop G. A. Burton, which translated runs: &#145;Proud Lancashire bore me, Rome consecrated me, and Bath, which I cared for, carried me off&#146;. Through his consecration of John Carroll in the Weld Chapel at Lulworth on 15 August 1790, Walmesley became the father of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in the United States.<br>
