<span class="headword">Claxton,  William</span>  (1530&#150;1597), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was the first son and heir of Ralph Claxton (<i>d</i>. 1549) of Wynyard, co. Durham, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Hebborne of Hardwick, near Sedgefield, in the same county. He succeeded his father at Wynyard on coming of age in 1551. He had married Margery, daughter of Robert Lambert of Owton, co. Durham, by 1549, and they had two sons (who predeceased him) and three daughters (one of whom predeceased him). In 1575 he verified the pedigree of his own and other branches of the Claxton family for the visitation by William Flower, Norroy king of arms, and Robert Glover, Somerset herald.<br>
<br>Claxton's father-in-law and more than one other relative had suffered loss of their lands for taking part in the northern uprising of 1569; a cousin, his namesake of Waterhouses, co. Durham, was later a convicted recusant; and his second daughter, Alice, married another, Sir William Blakiston. Claxton's own sentiments are no doubt indicated by the traditional heading &#145;Jesus&#146; on his letters to John Stow, the London antiquary, in 1582, 1585, and 1594. In the first of these, in which he refers to an earlier meeting with Stow in London, he mentions &#145;that simple pece of worke which you have of myne &hellip; upon the causes of Busshopbryck of Durham&#146;  (BL, MS Harley 374, fol. 10), but it is not known to survive. (He could however have supplied material for the portion of Camden's <span class="italic">Britannia</span>, first published in 1586, on co. Durham.) In that and the subsequent letters, besides giving various historical information, he discusses the loan of medieval manuscript books to and from Stow, some of the former borrowed from other owners, one identifiably from Durham Cathedral Library (MS C. IV. 15).<br>
<br>Claxton's verifiable signature occurs in one of two leading fourteenth-century collections of Durham monastic chronicles, which are each continued by several hands of the later sixteenth century. At least one of those hands was probably Claxton's own, and the others may have been those of members of his family and friends; they recur in other Durham historical manuscripts. Those continuations include medieval narrative which has been misattributed to William Chambre, but go as late as 1575. Evidence from some of the contents and the handwriting of the earliest dated copy, 1593, of &#145;The rites of Durham&#146;, suggest that Claxton may also have been the compiler of that evocative description of Durham Cathedral both before and after the suppression of the monastery, though much of it, as of the chronicle sequels, must have come from older sources, some perhaps orally, from one or more of the last monks and first canons, or lay officers, of the priory and chapter.<br>
<br>Claxton made his will on 19 November 1596, asking to be buried in Brancepeth church, co. Durham, under or near his ancestral tombstone. He must have died, probably at Wynyard, soon after a second codicil dated 5 May 1597, possibly before 14 May; his wife had died by 1596.<br>
