<span class="headword">Pritchard,  Andrew</span>  (1804&#150;1882), <span class="occ">microscopist</span>, eldest son of John Pritchard of Hackney, and his wife, Ann, daughter of John Fleetwood, was born in London on 14 December 1804. He was educated at St Saviour's Grammar School, Southwark, and was afterwards apprenticed to his cousin, Cornelius Varley, a patent agent and brother to the artist John Varley. On the expiration of his apprenticeship he started in business as an optician, from 1827 to 1835 at 18 Pickett Street, Strand (on the corner of 312 Strand), from 1836 to 1838 both there and at 263 Strand, and from 1839 to 1858 at 162 Fleet Street. Afterwards he had a business address at 49 Coleman Street in the City, shared with one of his sons, Andrew Goring Pritchard, a solicitor. On 16 July 1829 he married Caroline Isabella Straker.<br>
<br>Pritchard was brought up as an Independent. Later in life he associated with, though never actually became a member of, the sect known as Sandemanians, and it was in connection with that body he first made the acquaintance of Michael Faraday. Pritchard finally became a Unitarian, and in 1840 joined the congregation at Newington Green, a connection which lasted throughout his life. He was greatly interested in all the institutions of his religion, and was treasurer of the chapel from 1850 to 1872.<br>
<br>Pritchard early turned his attention to microscopy, and in 1824, while still with Varley, at the instigation of Dr C. R. Goring, he ground a single lens out of a diamond. He also fashioned simple lenses of sapphire, ruby, garnet, and spinel, but later sold rather old-fashioned microscopes. He is much better known for his microscope slides, which had their edges filled with red sealing wax. He mounted some of his specimens in a gum and isinglass mixture, a very early and innovative use of such a medium. His practical work on the microscope, however, was less important than his books on the applications of the instrument. His <span class="italic">List of 2000 Microscopic Objects</span> (1835) is very important in the history of microscopy, as it described the use of Canada balsam for mounting for the first time; his <span class="italic">History of the Infusoria</span> (1841) was long a standard work, and the impetus it gave to the study of biological science cannot be overestimated.<br>
<br>Pritchard wrote several other books on aspects of natural history as seen through the microscope, on optical instruments, and on patents. He also wrote four papers on microscopical optics between 1827 and 1833 in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of Science</span>, the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1873. He retired from business about 1852, and died at 87 St Paul's Road, Islington, on 24 November 1882. Profits from his writing contributed to the nearly &pound;40,000 left at his death.<br>

<a name="cosubject_22823"></a><span class="headword">Henry Baden Pritchard</span>  (1841&#150;1884), <span class="occ">chemist and writer</span>, the third son of Andrew Pritchard, was born in Canonbury on 30 November 1841, and sent to Eisenach and University College School, going afterwards to Switzerland to complete his education. In 1861 he obtained an appointment in the chemical department at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, and for some years before his death conducted the photographic department there. He was also proprietor and editor of the <span class="italic">Photographic News</span> from 1878 to 1884. On 25 March 1873 he married Mary, daughter of Matthew Evans of Shropshire.<br>
<br>A prolific author, Pritchard wrote travel books illustrated with his photographs and works of fiction. He died at Charlton, Kent, on 11 May 1884.<br>
