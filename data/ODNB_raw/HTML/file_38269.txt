<span class="headword">Sutton,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1708, <em>d.</em> 1788), <span class="occ">surgeon, apothecary, and smallpox inoculator</span>, was baptized in Kenton, Suffolk, on 12 February 1708, the son of Robert Sutton, gentleman. He was apprenticed in September 1726 to John Turner of Debenham, Suffolk, apothecary. In October 1731, shortly after completing his apprenticeship, he married Sarah Barker of Debenham. The first of their eight sons, Robert, was born in 1732 and in the same year Sutton returned to Kenton to start his own practice as surgeon and apothecary. There were also three daughters of the marriage.<br>
<br>Sutton then worked for many years as a country doctor, during which time his son Robert nearly died from smallpox inoculation performed by a &#145;surgeon of his acquaintance&#146;. This experience determined Sutton &#145;to dedicate his thoughts solely to the Small-pox; to &hellip; investigate a means whereby &hellip; that distemper might be lessened and danger, if possible, prevented by inoculation&#146;. Following a lengthy period of study he evolved a plan for inoculation. This he tested on a single patient in 1755. The results were favourable and there began a series of trials which &#145;convinced him that he had made some valuable discoveries&#146;.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1757 Sutton opened an inoculation house staffed by nurses where patients stayed for one month. So successful was this venture that two further houses were opened in September. A fourth house was opened in the summer of 1758. By the autumn of 1760 he had agents in sixteen towns and villages in Suffolk, south Norfolk, and north-east Essex. In 1761, probably as the result of competition from a rival inoculator, Sutton reduced his top fee from 7 to 5 guineas, with easier terms &#145;for the &hellip; lower Class of People&#146;.<br>
<br>By December 1761 the observations and modifications of several years' practical experience led Sutton to believe he had perfected his method. Earlier English inoculators had made deep cuts with the lancet and inserted large amounts of material from mature smallpox pustules, believing that protection was not obtainable unless the patient suffered a pronounced smallpox attack. As a later inoculator pointed out, &#145;little difference was perceived between the natural Smallpox, and that conveyed by inoculation&#146;. This was rejected by Sutton, who reverted to the original Graeco-Turkish technique of superficial scarification using small amounts of lymph. Even more important was his use of lymph taken from a smallpox pustule in its early stage of development, rather than from a mature pustule which was likely to be contaminated with a variety of organisms. The severity of symptoms in inoculees was thereby much reduced and the risk of a healthy patient's dying almost eliminated. In brief, the Suttonian method comprised treatment which was almost painless and relatively mild in its effects, while the greatly decreased number of pustules lessened disfigurement.<br>
<br>In the nine months from December 1761 to September 1762 Sutton performed a further 365 inoculations, all successfully. In the autumn of 1762 two inoculation houses were opened in Barrow, near Bury St Edmunds, under the control of his son Robert. About the same time his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38035/', "Daniel Sutton")</script>, who had been working as an assistant to an Essex doctor, joined the practice, which was then at its zenith. A disagreement over patients' preparation and post-operational recovery regime resulted in Daniel's leaving his father in 1763 to set up on his own at Ingatestone, Essex. Thereafter Sutton was overshadowed by his ambitious, avaricious, and energetic second son, who was to amass a fortune by publicizing and exploiting the Suttonian method of inoculation. Sutton died in 1788 and was buried on 13 April in Thetford, Norfolk.<br>
