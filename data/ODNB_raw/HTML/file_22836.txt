<span class="headword">Procter,  Richard Wright</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1816, <em>d.</em> 1881), <span class="occ">author</span>, son of Thomas Procter (<i>d</i>. 1823), of Paradise Vale, Salford, and his wife, Isabella Wright (<i>d</i>. 1825), was born at Paradise Vale and baptized in Salford on 19 December 1816. His parents were poor and his education sporadic. After his father's death in 1823 his mother made a vain attempt to gain him entrance to Chetham Hospital school. Shortly afterwards he was orphaned at the age of nine. He was apprenticed to a barber, David Dodd of Angel Meadow, and later set up in business as a barber at 133 Long Millgate, Manchester, where he was to remain for the rest of his life. In 1845 he purchased a circulating library which he ran from his shop. In 1840 he married Eliza Waddington; they had five sons.<br>
<br>During his youth Procter acquired a great hunger for literature and bought many books in spite of his poverty. His early attempts at poetry were published in the <span class="italic">Manchester and Salford Advertiser</span>. He adopted the <i>non de plume</i> of Sylvan. In 1842 he was associated with Samuel Bamford, J. C. Prince, J. B. Rogerson, and other local poets in meetings held at an inn, afterwards called the &#145;Poet's Corner&#146;; he contributed to a volume of verse entitled <span class="italic">The Festive Wreath</span>, which was based on these gatherings. Several of his poems were also published in <span class="italic">City Muse</span> (1853), edited by William Reid. His other contributions to poetry include a volume of poetical selections published in 1855, of which the first and last poems are by himself, and <span class="italic">Literary Reminiscences and Gleanings</span> (1860), devoted mainly to Lancashire poets. He published two works based on his own experiences at work, <span class="italic">The Barber's Shop</span> (1856) and <span class="italic">Our Turf, our Stage and our Ring</span> (1862), written from knowledge gained from his customers during his apprenticeship. His most important works were, however, historical in nature: <span class="italic">Memorials of Manchester Streets</span> (1874) and <span class="italic">Memorials of Bygone Manchester</span> (1880), which were originally published as serials in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>.<br>
<br>By nature a shy man, in later years Procter became a literary recluse, yet he was said, when his shyness was overcome, to be full of geniality, curious information, and gentle humour. He died at home at 133 Long Millgate, Manchester, on 11 September 1881, and was buried at St Luke's, Cheetham Hill.<br>
