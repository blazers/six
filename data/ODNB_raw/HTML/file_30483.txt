</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Asquith,  Herbert Henry</span>, first earl of Oxford and Asquith  (1852&#150;1928), <span class="occ">prime minister</span>, was born on 12 September 1852 at Croft House, Morley, Yorkshire. He was registered at birth as Herbert Asquith, and was known by that name until he was about forty, being called Bertie in the family; the name Henry seems to have been added at an early stage. He was the second son of the two sons and three daughters of Joseph Dixon Asquith (1825?&#150;1860), a minor employer in the woollen trade, and his wife, Emily (<i>d</i>. 1888), daughter of William Willans JP, a wool-stapler of Huddersfield. Two of his sisters died early, and his brother suffered a sports injury which stunted his growth; his father died when he was eight, from an intestine twisted while playing cricket. His mother was an invalid, with a heart condition and frequent bronchitis. The young Herbert Asquith soon of necessity developed the imperturbable, slightly withdrawn, self-sufficiency and good health which was his life's standby.<h2>
<a name="Youthandeducation"></a>Youth and education</h2>The Asquith family was thoroughgoingly Liberal in politics and strictly Congregationalist, attending the Rehoboth Chapel in Morley. Herbert was chiefly educated in his early years by his well-read mother. The family moved in 1858 to Mirfield, Yorkshire; on Joseph Asquith's death in 1860, William Willans, the grandfather, took responsibility for the family, sending the boys to Huddersfield College, their first school, and then in 1861 to the Moravian school in Fulneck, by Leeds. On William Willans's death in 1863, Emily Asquith moved to St Leonards, Sussex, but Herbert and his brother, William Willans Asquith, were billeted in various middle-class London households while they attended the City of London School as day boys. This made Asquith, he recalled, from that time &#145;to all intents and purposes a Londoner&#146;  (Asquith, <span class="italic">Memories</span>, 1.6). Even so, his chapel background remained more important to him than he perhaps later admitted to himself. It gave him a point of sturdy anti-establishmentarian reference, important to a man whose life in other respects was a long absorption into metropolitanism. Moreover, just after his eighteenth birthday, Asquith had fallen in love with Helen Kelsall Melland (<i>c</i>.1855&#150;1891), daughter of Frederick Melland, a physician in Manchester. She was the cousin of the Kelsalls, friends of the Asquiths who lived at St Leonards. His first love (and first marriage) was to emphasize his pre-London ties.<br>
<br>Under G. F. W. Mortimer and, from 1865, Edwin Abbott, the City of London School gained a reputation for good classical teaching and a strong Oxbridge entrance. Asquith flourished in this environment, also studying modern politics in the Guildhall Library. His personal circumstances and his mixture of classical and modern reading gave him a maturity and a <i>gravitas</i> of manner unusual for his years. In November 1869, in the proudest moment of his life, he won a classical scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, going into residence there in October 1870, just after Benjamin Jowett became master, and just as the college entered its most distinguished epoch. Asquith was to be a chief and very characteristic adornment of that period. Asquith recalled Plato and Kant as the two greatest &#145;thinkers and teachers&#146;  (Asquith, <span class="italic">Memories</span>, 1.19)&#151;he did not write &#145;influences&#146;, which is perhaps surprising, for in most respects he was a natural Aristotelian. T. H. Green was, with Jowett, the chief influence in Asquith's Balliol: &#145;the greatest personal force in the real life of Oxford&#146;. But, Asquith recalled, &#145;though I owe more than I can say to Green's gymnastics, both intellectual and moral, I never &#147;worshipped at the Temple's inner shrine&#148;&#146;  (ibid.). Even so, Asquith came to be, in practical politics, a chief exemplar of the semi-secular ethical progressivism which Green taught. Asquith blossomed at Balliol. He gained a first class in honours moderations in 1872 and was <i>proxime accessit</i> in the Hertford scholarship that year, being also <i>proxime</i> for the Ireland scholarship in 1873. In 1874 he was president of the Oxford Union (after several attempts), as a Liberal, and gained a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i>. He was, with A. C. Bradley, elected a probationary fellow of Balliol in 1874 (full from 1875), a post which he held until 1882 and which maintained his Oxford associations. Asquith's most famous phrase, the &#145;effortless superiority&#146; of Balliol men, was coined in a speech at a dinner given in his honour by Balliol men when he became prime minister in 1908  (J. Jones, <span class="italic">Balliol College: a History</span>, 2nd edn, 1997, 226). He left Balliol with a distinguished reputation and a coterie of friends which included many who would make a mark: Alfred Milner, A. C. Bradley, Herbert Warren, Charles Gore, Thomas Raleigh, W. P. Ker, and W. H. Mallock. He had many prospects, but no money.<h2>
<a name="Thebarandjournalism"></a>The bar and journalism</h2>Equipped by a fine education, Asquith had to make his way in the world. His early career showed less of an effortless rise to the top than his Balliol career had suggested. For a few months he tutored the earl of Portsmouth's children&#151;which gave him an enduring taste for great houses and country house parties&#151;and examined for the Oxford and Cambridge board. Asquith had begun eating the required dinners in Lincoln's Inn while an undergraduate, and in October 1875 he began to work in the chambers of Charles Bowen. He was called to the bar in June 1876, with chambers at 6 Fig Tree Court, but briefs did not abundantly follow.<br>
<br>Asquith's steadfast romance with Helen Melland, to whom he had become secretly engaged about the time of his final year at Oxford, and whose father rather reluctantly released her, resulted in marriage at Manchester on 23 August 1877. Helen brought with her a small annual income which supplemented the money from Asquith's Balliol fellowship. By the time of her early death, she had borne five children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41100/', "Raymond Asquith (1878&#150;1916)")</script>, Herbert (1881&#150;1947), Arthur Melland (1883&#150;1939), (Helen) Violet (1887&#150;1969) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31961/', "Carter, (Helen) Violet Bonham")</script>], and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30481/', "Cyril Asquith, Baron Asquith of Bishopstone (1890&#150;1954)")</script>.<br>
<br>Asquith's married life was happy but limited, almost at times suffocating. In a rare letter surviving from this period of his life, he wrote in 1892 (a year after Helen's death) to his confidante, Mrs Horner of Mells, whose daughter his son Raymond later married:<blockquote>I belonged to the very middle classes then &hellip; I was young and callow, and self-confident, and ambitious if possibly rather repellent. Women played very little part in my life. I was content with my early love, and never looked outside. So we settled down in a little suburban villa, and our children were born, and every day I went by train to the Temple, and sat and worked and dreamed in my chambers, and listened with feverish expectation for a knock on the door, hoping it might be a client with a brief. But years passed and he hardly ever came. &hellip; of all times the most hateful is to feel that you have the capacity for power and yet that you have no field to exercise it. That was for years my case, and no one who has not been through it can know the chilling, paralysing, deadening, depression of hope deferred and energy wasted and vitality run to seed. (letter of 17 Oct 1892, Matthew, &#145;Asquith's political journalism&#146;, 147)</blockquote>As Asquith waited for briefs, he found a further source of income from writing for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>: between 1876 and 1884 he wrote at least thirty-nine articles, usually in the summer when the editors, R. H. Hutton and Meredith Townsend, were on holiday. These articles&#151;the only source for his political opinions until he became an MP&#151;show his lifelong Liberalism early and clearly defined. They reflect a staunch radicalism tempered by realism (on condition that it worked from within the Liberal Party), a hostility to radical factionalists, and an admiration for &#145;party spirit &hellip; the product of a very complex sentiment, which is slow to grow and hard to sustain, and which thrives best where it can be nourished by historic memories&#146;&#151;a view stated in his first and very characteristic article, &#145;The English extreme left&#146;, an unusual use of the term &#145;left&#146; at that time  (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 12 Aug 1876). Asquith deplored the fair-trade movement of the early 1880s, but argued that the Liberals must seem &#145;responsible&#146; in their criticism of foreign policy and must not allow the tories to secure the patriotic vote. Asquith recorded later that it was because of home rule that he stopped writing for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, Hutton and Townsend being strongly unionist; but his articles on the Irish in the early 1880s reflected a strict legalism, a considerable caution as to alliance with the Parnellites. He argued that &#145;the severance of Ulster from the rest of Ireland is a geographical, and therefore, a political impossibility. &hellip; The Union is safe as long as Ulster is loyal&#146;  (&#145;The invasion of Ulster&#146;, <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 29 Sept 1883). Though Asquith played no other significant part in national or local politics between 1875 and 1884, his <span class="italic">Spectator</span> articles show him with already a clear political identity, tough-minded in its caution towards those on the &#145;left&#146;, but also staunchly anti-tory. Asquith's political journalism is easily recognizable&#151;in both style and content&#151;in terms of what later came to be described as &#145;Asquithian&#146;. In the same period (until 1885) he regularly wrote one of the two leading articles in <span class="italic">The Economist</span>.<br>
<br>Probably through the Eighty Club (founded to mark the Liberal victory in 1880), Asquith became acquainted with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33643/', "R. B. Haldane")</script>, the club's first secretary, who quickly became a close political and family friend. In 1883 Asquith moved to the chambers of R. S. Wright at 1 Roper Buildings, London. Through Wright, Asquith got work from Sir Henry James, Gladstone's attorney-general, and his legal career quickly picked up. His memorandum on the Bradlaugh case reached the prime minister. In 1884 the Liberal Central Association published his <span class="italic">Election Guide</span>, which especially dealt with the new <span class="roman">Corrupt Practices Act</span> and which led to much legal business after the 1885 general election. By the mid-1880s, therefore, Asquith was well known in London Liberal legal circles, and by 1886 he had sufficient briefs to be earning a fair income.<h2>
<a name="Earlypoliticalcareer"></a>Early political career</h2>In the political confusion following the defeat of the first <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Bill</span> and a snap dissolution in June 1886, Asquith, through the good offices of Haldane, became the Liberal candidate for East Fife. He defeated (by 2863 to 2489 votes) the previous Liberal MP, J. Boyd-Kinnear, who stood as a Liberal Unionist, having been disavowed by the East Fife Liberal Association. Irish home rule and the local Liberals' allegiance to Gladstonian principles were thus the causes of Asquith's acquisition of a seat which, while always needing nurturing, invariably until the First World War returned a Liberal. It remained his constituency until 1918. There was an element of risk for Asquith involved in becoming an MP, for his income from the bar was by no means assured. But the hiatus in the Liberal Party caused by the events of 1886 offered exceptional opportunities to young politicians who, in the usual course of Liberal politics, would normally have had to serve a generation as back-benchers before expecting office. Asquith grasped this opportunity with characteristic lack of fuss.<br>
<br>Speaking sparingly but always authoritatively in the Commons, Asquith quickly assumed a role as a custodian and formidable apologist for Liberalism. His maiden speech on 24 March 1887 led to a dinner invitation from Gladstone. Gladstone evidently anticipated Asquith's rise to the top, for Asquith recalled that he advised him (at an unspecified date): &#145;If ever you have to form a Government, you must steel your nerves and act the butcher&#146;  (Asquith, <span class="italic">Studies and Sketches</span>, 206). At the National Liberal Association meeting in Nottingham in October 1887, Asquith moved the resolution pledging the party to home rule. Round Asquith and Haldane a small group formed for political discussion dinners, which in 1889 became the Articles Club (there were thirty-nine well-connected members). Asquith's prominence was also aided by his role as junior counsel to Sir Charles Russell before the commission of 1888 on <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the supposed support of Parnell for the Phoenix Park murders. Asquith's cross-examination demolished the evidence of D. J. Macdonald, <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s manager. Asquith became QC in February 1890.<br>
<br>His career now well under way, Asquith's domestic life was disrupted by the unexpected death of Helen Asquith on 11 September 1891 while on the family's holiday on the Isle of Arran. She was thought to have caught her son's influenza, but in fact died of typhoid. Asquith began a peripatetic life, his children moving almost as often as he had himself been required to do in his youth. Before his wife's death he had met Margot Tennant [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30482/', "Asquith, Margaret Emma Alice (1864&#150;1945)")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36455/', "Sir Charles Tennant (1823&#150;1906)")</script> and his first wife, Emma (1821&#150;1895). In October 1892 he told Mrs Horner that &#145;about two years ago, Margot, whom I had met, but not often, took possession of me &hellip; there have been moments when we were almost more than lovers&#146;  (Asquith to Mrs Horner, 17 Oct 1892, Earl of Oxford MSS, Mells, Somerset). Even so, Margot, an energetic member of the Souls and thus a &#145;modern woman&#146;, was cautious about marriage.<h2>
<a name="Homesecretary18921895"></a>Home secretary, 1892&#150;1895</h2>When Gladstone formed his fourth and last administration in August 1892, he made Asquith, from 18 August (when he was also sworn of the privy council), his home secretary. In Gladstonian terms, this was a quite exceptional accolade, for he normally required years of executive experience before a promotion to secretary of state. It followed from Gladstone's selection of Asquith to move on 8 August the amendment to the address which caused the resignation of Salisbury's government, confirming in the Commons its defeat in the country at the general election. With Gladstone and John Morley absorbed in the second <span class="roman">Irish Home Rule Bill</span>, this left Asquith and his under-secretary, Herbert Gladstone, the prime minister's son, in charge of important aspects of the Liberals' programme of domestic reform. Asquith's position was difficult, for the Liberals in the Commons had only 272 MPs to the combined Unionist vote of 314, and thus relied on the Irish home-rulers for their majority. It soon became clear that the Unionists intended to use their own majority in the Lords not merely to stop home rule but to spoil whatever items of the Liberals' legislative programme they disliked: &#145;ploughing the sands&#146; was Asquith's famous phrase (borrowed from Juvenal) for the government's fate.<br>
<br>Asquith dealt firmly with the vexed question of public meetings in Trafalgar Square, laying down a code of procedure which lasted more than a century. He declined to distinguish between &#145;political&#146; and &#145;non-political&#146; offenders in cases involving Irish dynamiters. During the lock-out in the coalmining industry in 1893, he sent 400 members of the Metropolitan Police to Featherstone, in Yorkshire, to assist the local authorities with outbreaks of disorder; the local authorities also requested military help, and after the reading of the <span class="roman">Riot Act</span> the troops opened fire and killed two men. Asquith's close friend R. B. Haldane was a member of the commission of inquiry which vindicated the troops; &#145;Remember Featherstone&#146; was a cry at Asquith's political meetings for the next thirty years. With Haldane, he persuaded Gladstone to appoint Rosebery as (successful) arbitrator between the coal owners and the Miners' Federation, an important step towards governmental involvement in industrial disputes.<br>
<br>By origin a nonconformist, Asquith was faced with some difficulty in his ecclesiastical patronage responsibilities; he tried to avoid appointment as an ecclesiastical commissioner, but eventually agreed to serve. Welsh rather than Scottish disestablishment gained a high place in the Liberal programme and was Asquith's responsibility. He introduced a <span class="roman">Welsh Church Suspensory Bill</span> on 23 February 1893 as a preliminary, but after a promising vote on its first reading it was abandoned on 18 September. In the autumn of 1893 Asquith prepared a <span class="roman">Welsh Disestablishment and Disendowment Bill</span>, which made little progress in the last months of Gladstone's premiership. On 26 April 1894&#151;after Rosebery had succeeded Gladstone&#151;Asquith introduced the bill, the first government attempt at disestablishment on the British mainland; it foundered in 1894 but was reintroduced, slightly amended, by Asquith on 25 February 1895. His speech on its second reading &#145;must rank as among the finest of his career&#146;  (Morgan, <span class="italic">Wales</span>, 150); the bill passed its second reading but was scuppered in committee, partly by the intrigues of Lloyd George and other Welsh members intent on making it more of a home-rule measure, and the bill was lost when the government resigned.<br>
<br>Asquith was also responsible for the <span class="roman">Employers' Liability Bill</span> of 1893, which dealt with the question of factory accidents by removing the doctrine of common employment rather than by insuring the workforce. The Lords' amendments wrecked the bill and it was dropped. Asquith improved factory conditions by strengthening the factory inspection service (and introducing women inspectors) and through his <span class="roman">Factory Bill</span>, whose final stages he persuaded the incoming Unionist government to allow through in July 1895.<br>
<br>Asquith's legislative achievement as home secretary was thus thin, but his reputation as a balanced, sturdy, and reliable Liberal was confirmed. &#145;He will rise&#146; was Gladstone's encomium  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 28 Oct 1893). When Gladstone resigned in March 1894, Asquith supported Lord Rosebery, who was appointed prime minister.<h2>
<a name="Secondmarriage"></a>Second marriage</h2>On 10 May 1894 Asquith married Margot Tennant in a Church of England society wedding in St George's, Hanover Square, London, three prime ministers&#151;Gladstone, Rosebery, Balfour&#151;witnessing the signatures in the register. There were five children of the marriage, only two of whom survived infancy: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30479/', "Anthony Asquith (1902&#150;1968)")</script> and Elizabeth Charlotte Lucy, later Princess Bibesco (<i>d</i>. 1945). Charmed by Margot's eccentric enthusiasm, Asquith had made what was to prove a politically dangerous marriage, and an expensive one, for his wife's style was generously extravagant (though she brought with her about &pound;5000 per annum). In the early years of their marriage, she was often ill and was a chronic insomniac. With Margot, Asquith became Henry, rather than Herbert, and her usage soon became general. His love for Margot confirms the risky, raffish element in Asquith's outwardly staid personality. The Asquiths set up in 20 Cavendish Square, London, their family home until 1919. Breaking precedent, Asquith returned to the bar when the Liberal government went out of office, and began a decade of legal work, bringing in between &pound;5000 and &pound;10,000 per annum.<br>
<br>Asquith trod political water in the late 1890s. Neither of Gladstone's successors as leaders of the Liberal Party&#151;Rosebery and Harcourt&#151;lasted long; Asquith saw the performance of Rosebery as &#145;selfish&#146; and Harcourt was in Asquith's view &#145;undignified by even the slightest tincture of a sense of public duty&#146;  (Matthew, <span class="italic">Liberal Imperialists</span>, 22, 31). In terms of policy, Asquith was associated with R. B. Haldane and Sir Edward Grey, but lacked their enthusiasm for Lord Rosebery's leadership. Always irritated by radicals, he found himself differing from his party's leadership on questions such as the conquest of the Sudan, but never to the point of seriously endangering party unity: unlike his friends, he did not look to a Liberal split or purge on imperial questions. When Harcourt resigned as Liberal leader in December 1898, Asquith, despite encouragement from his friends, declined to be considered for the leadership and, with the rest of the party, supported Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. If he had become leader he would have had to cease practising at the bar, and he could not afford this. However, he seemed well placed in due course to succeed Campbell-Bannerman&#151;his senior by sixteen years.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in South Africa in September 1899, Asquith called for support for the government and &#145;an unbroken front&#146;. Initially associated publicly and privately with the strong line taken by Alfred Milner, the high commissioner in South Africa, Asquith was always cautious about association with the various Liberal Imperialist organizations within the Liberal Party during the war, though he was inferentially associated with several of them. He declined to preside over the Imperial Liberal Council and he worked to maintain contact between the Liberal Imperialists and Campbell-Bannerman, an approach which broke down with the latter's &#145;methods of barbarism&#146; speech in June 1901. Subsequently, Asquith led the Liberal Imperialists in order to contain them: he joined the Liberal Imperial League, he drafted the Liberal League's manifesto in 1902, and was one of the vice-presidents. Asquith found these manoeuvrings distasteful. Unlike his friends Grey and Haldane, he had no real interest in imperial questions and saw them chiefly as unwelcome disrupters of party unity. He consequently at once saw the advantage that Joseph Chamberlain's campaign for tariff reform gave to the Liberal Party and he took it energetically. Asquith's series of speeches answering Chamberlain in 1903 helped dignify tariff reform as the critical question in British politics, and Asquith's forensic skills quickly exposed deficiencies and self-contradictions in Chamberlain's arguments. They also ended the tentative movement away from strict free trade which some Liberal Imperialists sought. &#145;Wonderful speeches &hellip; How can these fellows ever have gone wrong&#146;, reflected Campbell-Bannerman  (Spender, <span class="italic">Campbell-Bannerman</span>, 2.120).<br>
<br>By 1904 a Liberal victory at the next election was likely, by 1905 all but certain. Complex manoeuvring for cabinet posts began. Asquith, Haldane, and Grey proposed in March 1905 that Campbell-Bannerman be prime minister, but in the Lords, with Asquith as chancellor of the exchequer (and heir apparent in the Commons) and Haldane as lord chancellor. Haldane tried to bind his friends into what became known as the Relugas compact of September 1905, by which Edward VII and the court would see to Campbell-Bannerman, and the trio of friends would stand firm together in their demands. In fact, when Balfour and the Unionist government resigned in December 1905, Asquith advised Campbell-Bannerman not to take office but to force the Unionists to dissolve parliament. Campbell-Bannerman ignored this advice, refused to go to the Lords, and offered the exchequer to Asquith, who immediately accepted it without discussion with his friends. The Liberal Imperialists were well placed in the new government, and better placed for influence on foreign and military affairs than they themselves had intended. But this was more due to Campbell-Bannerman than to plotting by Asquith or the &#145;Limps&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Chancelloroftheexchequer19051908"></a>Chancellor of the exchequer, 1905&#150;1908</h2>Asquith's chancellorship was short but important. He approached the office with characteristic self-confidence, later telling Philip Snowden that the post &#145;was the easiest one in the Government&#146;  (B. E. V. Sabine, <span class="italic">A History of Income Tax</span>, 1966, 144). His appointment seemed to imply a rather conservative tenure, with the safeguarding of free trade his chief objective. It was certainly the case that reduction of debt and a curbing of defence expenditure were expected by most of the Liberal Party. However, Asquith also used his chancellorship creatively, and prepared the way for Lloyd George's development of the Treasury as a positive rather than negative force in British government. Asquith hoped in 1906 to increase land taxes and to end a Gladstonian shibboleth by graduating the income tax and differentiating its payment between those on earned and unearned incomes, but Treasury officials persuaded him against this; he consequently appointed a select committee under Sir Charles Dilke to inquire into differentiation and graduation, thus indicating the direction of his thinking on revenue raising.<br>
<br>Asquith's first budget was on 30 April 1906. The confidence he had always shown in public speaking certainly did not elude him as he moved towards the very centre of power: he spoke, his permanent secretary noted, &#145;with such lucidity and fluency as if he had been making Budget speeches all his life&#146;  (Hamilton, 462&#150;3). With the government only four months in office, this first budget was bound, as Asquith said, to be &#145;provisional&#146;. It abolished the coal tax, reduced the tea tax, and announced a reduction of &pound;1.5 million in naval expenditure, with &#145;a return to more thrifty and economical administration the first and paramount duty of the Government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 4</span>, 156, 1906, col. 287). It was Asquith's intention both to reduce income tax and to avoid further tariffs.<br>
<br>Asquith's second budget, presented on 18 April 1907, differentiated the income tax (by abating the charge on earned incomes under &pound;2000), the chancellor feeling that the introduction of graduation in the same year would be beyond the tax administration. When prime minister he strongly supported Lloyd George's introduction of graduation and a super tax. In 1907 death duties were increased. Asquith's pronouncement that the chancellor should &#145;not drift along the stream and treat each year as if it were self-contained&#146; and should &#145;budget not for one year, but for several years&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 4</span>, 172, 1907, col. 1186) implied the possibility of financial planning of an innovatory kind.<br>
<br>Behind the 1907 budget&#151;less radical than many Liberals would have liked&#151;lay the question of social welfare. The large Liberal majority in the Commons did not mean easy passing of Liberal bills, for it soon became clear that the Unionists would use the Lords as a wrecking chamber as energetically as they had done in the 1890s. With Campbell-Bannerman often attending to his sick wife, Asquith, who was deputy leader of the house as well as chancellor, took a leading role in the Commons: &#145;send for the sledge-hammer&#146; was Campbell-Bannerman's solution to a difficulty  (Spender and Asquith, 1.181). Failure to pass bills such as the <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> of 1907 led to disappointment in the party and the country, and from the start of the government Campbell-Bannerman&#151;in no sense a &#145;new Liberal&#146;&#151;looked to Asquith to provide &#145;balance&#146;  (Gilbert, 203).<br>
<br>In December 1906 the Treasury produced an important cabinet paper on old-age pensions. In 1907 Asquith was reluctant to make a commitment to old-age pensions, but hoped in his budget speech of 18 April 1907 &#145;to lay the firm foundations of this reform&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 4</span>, 172, 1907, col. 1191). He told the house that he was &#145;not what is called a Socialist&#146;, but also that &#145;there is nothing that calls so loudly or so imperiously as the possibilities of social reform&#146;  (ibid., 172, 1907, col. 1189). On 1 April 1908 Asquith's cabinet paper set out the details of a plan for non-contributory pensions financed from national taxation. He made it public in his budget on 7 May 1908, in fact delivered after he had become prime minister, those over seventy receiving a weekly pension collected at the Post Office (Lloyd George subsequently somewhat amended the scheme and saw through the legislation, much to the advantage of his reputation). The justification for the state pension, Asquith declared, stood &#145;on precisely the same footing as the free education of children&#146;  (ibid., 188, 1908, col. 475). The principle of financing welfare centrally and nationally (like the navy), rather than indirectly or via local taxation, was novel and dramatic, and cut across centuries of habit. Asquith's role in manoeuvring the Treasury and the cabinet to accept this solution&#151;for the need for some form of public support for aged persons other than the poor law was generally recognized&#151;remains uncertain, but given the character of the Treasury must have been significant. Asquith underestimated the cost of old-age pensions, believing they could be paid for without significant extra taxation and through a reserve he had built up for the purpose: &#145;I have realised from the first that if it could not be proved that social reform (not Socialism) can be financed on a Free Trade line, a return to Protection is a moral certainty&#146;  (letter of 9 May 1908, Matthew, <span class="italic">Liberal Imperialists</span>, 257). It was left to Lloyd George to introduce the new taxes&#151;albeit taxes for which Asquith had prepared the way&#151;needed to finance welfare without recourse to tariffs. No British politician has brought more benefit more simply to ordinary people than Asquith did with old-age pensions.<br>
<br>During his chancellorship, Asquith and his growing family continued to live at 20 Cavendish Square (11 Downing Street being too small). In 1907 the Asquiths took over from Margot's brother, Frank, Archerfield House, situated between Gullane and North Berwick on the Firth of Forth, and adjacent to Muirfield and other golf courses. Sometimes playing with Arthur Balfour, who lived nearby, Asquith was an enthusiastic but no more than modestly competent golfer (and probably never had a handicap). He was an economical worker and always allowed himself time for relaxation. He enjoyed cards after dinner and conversation with women. He also enjoyed drink, and during this period his drinking habits began to be the subject of comment among his colleagues. This did not, however, affect his status as heir apparent to Campbell-Bannerman. Though in as broadly based a party as the Edwardian Liberals there was naturally talk of alternatives, Asquith's succession to the premiership was more certain than that of any Liberal politician in the history of the party. Such a status might be constraining, or liberating: in Asquith's case it was much more the latter than the former. In November 1907 Campbell-Bannerman suffered a heart attack, and another on 12 February 1908. Even so, he was reluctant to resign, eventually doing so on 1 April 1908. Edward VII summoned Asquith to Biarritz, where he was holidaying, an absence which led to some criticism. Asquith travelled across France incognito and alone, and on 8 April 1908 kissed hands as prime minister in the king's hotel room, having first resigned as chancellor (his original intention had been, like Gladstone in 1873&#150;4 and 1880&#150;82, to hold both offices). On his return, his leadership of the party was confirmed by a party meeting on 29 April; he was the first prime minister whose appointment was thus ratified. Asquith completed his duties as chancellor by introducing his third budget (with its provision for old-age pensions, discussed above) on 7 May.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsasprimeminister"></a>Early years as prime minister</h2>Asquith began his premiership in good shape. By promoting Lloyd George to the chancellorship and Winston Churchill to the Board of Trade and the cabinet, he reinforced the radical and activist side of Liberalism. Asquith and Lloyd George were to form one of the most effective combinations in British progressive politics, similar to that of Attlee and Bevan. Asquith's steady support saw Lloyd George through many a difficulty, including, and especially, the Marconi scandal of 1912&#150;13; in return Lloyd George gave the government a much sharper progressive profile. Asquith also stiffened the cabinet by making Lord Crewe colonial secretary and Liberal leader in the Lords and bringing forward Reginald McKenna to head the Admiralty. Through Crewe, he secured his small but important whiggish flank.<br>
<br>Asquith's government had a majority over the Unionists of over 350 in the Commons, but the Unionists had a majority over the Liberals of about 400 (or more) in the Lords. This was the context which was to dictate the agenda of much of his peacetime premiership. Asquith's intention and inclination as prime minister was to act as co-ordinator of a lively cabinet whose members would bring forward Liberal legislation. The effect of the intransigence of the Lords was, however, to bring forward the prime minister to the front rank of action and intervention. In 1908 the <span class="roman">Licensing Bill</span> (introduced by Asquith in February 1908 while still chancellor) was rejected by the Lords, and other important government measures were either rejected or mutilated: the <span class="roman">Education Bill</span>, the <span class="roman">Housing and Town Planning Bill</span>, the <span class="roman">Small Holders (Scotland) Bill</span>, and the <span class="roman">Land Values (Scotland) Bill</span>. It was, however, difficult to dissolve on any or all of these: they were important to sections of the community but were insufficient questions on which to risk or to carry a general election. On 11 December 1908 Asquith, speaking at the National Liberal Club, declared the question of the Lords the critical issue of the time, and associated it with the coming <span class="roman">Budget and Finance Bill</span>: &#145;The Budget of next year will stand at the very centre of our work&#146;  (Rowland, 1.169).<h2>
<a name="ThepeoplesbudgetandtheHouseofLords"></a>The &#145;people's budget&#146; and the House of Lords</h2>Lloyd George's budget of 1909 had Asquith's support. It developed the changes in direct taxation anticipated during Asquith's chancellorship, and it financed significant increases in defence and social welfare costs (including Asquith's underestimate of the cost of old-age pensions) without infringing free-trade principles. Its emphasis on various innovations in direct taxation (though indirect taxes were also increased) ensured that it would meet opposition from sections of the propertied classes and from tariff reformers who believed protective duties should meet the revenue gap. The unusual discussion in cabinet of the budget's proposals&#151;particularly super tax and the land taxes&#151;marked its exceptional political importance, for the budget was normally revealed to the cabinet only a few days before its statement in the Commons. Asquith supported his chancellor through fourteen cabinet meetings, with the result that the cabinet was clearly associated with the budget's proposals. Asquith saw them as a means of broadening the appeal of his government, which in 1908 had become over-associated with nonconformist causes.<br>
<br>The budget posed the Unionists a problem: their tariff reform wing was bitterly opposed to the budget, their anti-socialists saw it as a test case, their peers had become accustomed to using their hereditary power. Any government in 1909 would have needed to raise considerable extra revenue: the moment coincided with a clear division between the parties on the means of doing so, and gave Asquith a central question on which to rally the forces of free-trade progress.<br>
<br>As the <span class="roman">Finance Bill</span> made its slow progress through the Commons, Asquith supported it in the country, emphasizing both its financial and its constitutional importance. From July 1909 there were indications that the Unionist peers might vote against the <span class="roman">Finance Bill</span>. Lord Rosebery attacked the budget in September 1909, Asquith resigning in consequence as vice-president of the Liberal League. Also in September the cabinet considered the consequences of the Lords voting down the bill. With Asquith's encouragement, the king warned the Unionist leaders of the grave consequences of rejection. Asquith's cabinet in November considered a bill to provide finance should the main <span class="roman">Finance Bill</span> fail, but, on the advice of Courtenay Ilbert, supported by Lloyd George, he reversed this policy on the grounds that it would seem to concede that the Lords had the right to decide which financial measures the Commons could propose: the country would now rely on voluntary payment of taxes (as it turned out, a successful device). It was agreed that, should the Lords reject the bill, parliament would be dissolved and a general election held (barely four years into the seven-year parliament), the huge Liberal majority of 1906 being certain to be substantially reduced. On 28 November the king's secretary made it clear to Asquith that to be asked to create a large number of peers would practically be almost an impossibility, and if asked for would place the king in an awkward position  (Jenkins, <span class="italic">Asquith</span>, 202). On 30 November the Lords rejected the second reading of the <span class="roman">Finance Bill</span> by 370 votes to 75, and on 2 December Asquith carried by 349 votes to 134 a motion in the Commons declaring the Lords' action &#145;a breach of the constitution and a usurpation of the rights of the Commons&#146;.<br>
<br>Asquith opened the Liberals' election campaign at the Albert Hall on 10 December 1909, announcing that he and his colleagues would not resume office &#145;unless we can secure the safeguards which experience shows to be necessary for the legislative utility and honour of the party of progress&#146;  (Rowland, 1.243), a remark widely assumed to mean that Asquith had already secured the king's agreement to the creation of peers. On 15 December, by an exchange between their respective secretaries, the king warned Asquith explicitly that &#145;he [Edward VII] would not be justified in creating new peers (say 300) until after a second election&#146;  (Jenkins, <span class="italic">Asquith</span>, 202&#150;3). Following Liberal precedent, Asquith protected the king by not divulging his position on this central question, which would, in any case, have been damaging to the Liberal Party's case; Asquith's speeches during the election were thus necessarily circumspect.<br>
<br>The general election of January 1910, fought on a fresh register and producing an all-time record turnout of 92 per cent, resulted in the Liberals and the Unionists having 275 and 273 MPs respectively, the Liberals being conditionally sustained in office by most of the 82 Irish home-rulers and the 40 Labour MPs. It was in some respects a disappointing if not unanticipated result for Asquith, but it was the first time since 1885 (only the second time since 1865) that a government had been re-elected in peacetime, and the government's overall majority (of Liberals, Labour, and home-rulers) was second only to that of 1906 for Liberal governments since the first <span class="roman">Reform Act</span>.<br>
<br>Even so, both Asquith and his party were dispirited. In the early months of 1910, Asquith was tired and even lackadaisical. The endgame with the crown and the Lords was bound to be protracted and thankless; the government was formally without revenue; the question of Irish home rule, side-stepped during the majority years of 1906&#150;9, was again at the forefront of politics and promised to absorb years of government time; the relationship of the Liberals to their partners in the majority required detailed attention. Asquith retreated, as Gladstone had often done, to stay with Lord Rendel on the French riviera. On 21 February, when the new parliament met, Asquith dismayed his followers by telling them that on the question of the creation of peers by the king, &#145;I tell the house quite frankly that I have received no such guarantee, and that I have asked for no such guarantee&#146;  (Spender and Asquith, 1.273). It was in this dispiriting context that Asquith, in reply initially to Lord Helmsley on 3 March but later to three other questioners, used the phrase &#145;wait and see&#146;, a phrase which fairly described his position but which he may have come to regret  (instances quoted in Spender and Asquith, 1.275). After prolonged cabinet discussions, Asquith on 29 March 1910 moved three resolutions in the Commons or the Lords (on money bills, on other than money bills, and on the duration of parliament); these were carried. On 14 April he introduced the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span> with a rather opaque reference to the terms the government would request from the crown should a further general election on the Lords be necessary. On 20 April the <span class="roman">Finance Bill</span> was reintroduced and passed, and on 28 April the Lords passed without a division what they had splenetically rejected five months earlier. This seemed a good precedent for the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span>, though there was little expectation that it would prove a precedent which the Lords would follow.<br>
<br>The death of Edward VII on 6 May 1910, news of which was received by Asquith while holidaying off Portugal aboard the Admiralty yacht <i>Enchantress</i>, was thought to change this situation. Asquith was as reluctant to be seen harrying the new king, George V, as he had been cautious about forcing the pace with his father. With Edward VII, he could have taken some satisfaction in the extent to which he had avoided provoking the sort of crown&#150;aristocratic alliance which many Unionists felt natural. His tactic with Edward VII had been to allow him to conclude that Unionist behaviour was unacceptable, a tactic which took time. George V, though as associated with affairs of state as his father, when Prince of Wales, had been excluded, was, even so, a cautious man necessarily feeling his way. There was no self-assertion by the new king&#151;as there had been by Edward VII in 1901&#151;that he intended rapidly to change the course of royal behaviour. Asquith, with his cabinet's agreement, decided to promote a constitutional conference with the Unionist leaders, with the aim of achieving a solution to the question of the Lords by agreement (with the consequence that a second general election would be avoided). Twelve meetings were held between 17 June and the end of July, with further spasmodic meetings until 10 November, when the conference broke up, partly over Unionist insistence that Irish home rule be excluded from the proposed limitations on powers of the Lords. The conference was the nearest to a constitutional convention held in Britain in the twentieth century; but the minor parties were not included, and its purpose was to achieve a political arrangement satisfactory to the Liberals and the Unionists. Its immediate political import was further emphasized by Lloyd George's memorandum of 17 August, calling for a coalition government and circulated round the inner ring of front-bench politicians of both parties without Asquith's imprimatur.<br>
<br>On the breakup of the talks, Asquith on 10 November requested an immediate dissolution, and secured from a most reluctant George V on 16 November a secret agreement that if the government won the election he would, if necessary, use his prerogative to appoint peers. From a quick election campaign, with Asquith leading his party more rigorously and confidently than the previous January, the election confirmed the Asquith government position, the numbers of seats won being almost a replica of the January election. It was a very striking victory, despite the familiarity of issues under discussion: the only occasion since 1832 on which a party had won three consecutive general elections. That it was a party rather than a personal crusade of the Gladstonian sort was wholly in keeping with Asquith's view of his political role. In a long endgame he had checkmated the Unionists; it remained to be seen whether they acknowledged the rules of the game.<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span> took until 15 May to pass the Commons and entered the Lords. On 14 July Asquith presented a formal minute of the cabinet to the king preparing for the creation of peers, its content soon becoming known to the Unionist leaders. A list of 249 proposed ennoblements was drawn up&#151;it included Thomas Hardy, the novelist&#151;which would have been hereditary not life peerages. On 24 July Asquith stood his ground for half an hour at the dispatch box of the Commons only spasmodically audible against Unionist braying: his party might criticize him for his unwillingness to force the pace against the Lords, but this notorious occasion confirmed Asquith's approach, that the Unionists must be given time either to change or to display publicly their anti-democratic intentions.<br>
<br>On 10 August the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span> passed the Lords and there was enacted a modest but, in terms of the politics of the day, critical change in the British constitution. The episode was the zenith of Asquith's prime ministerial career. In the British Liberal tradition, he patched rather than reformulated the constitution. His objectives were throughout conservative, in the sense of making the existing constitution work, and the <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span> left the Lords with significant powers of obstruction, as was quickly to be seen. The question of the Lords ironically both encouraged the formulation of a wider programme of constitutional change and prevented its development and implementation.<h2>
<a name="Otherdomesticquestions"></a>Other domestic questions</h2>The Lords absorbed much of Asquith's time, but this by no means prevented his government action on a wide range of other fronts, for he saw his premiership as co-ordinating rather than initiating in the Gladstone style. Strong ministers&#151;Lloyd George at the exchequer, Winston Churchill at the Home Office from 1910, Sir Edward Grey at the Foreign Office, R. B. Haldane as secretary of state for war and then lord chancellor&#151;were left to advance policy in their departments. Asquith did not force the pace upon them; but no peacetime premier has been a more effective enabler. Labour exchanges, the introduction of unemployment and health insurance, the reform of the army, and the establishment of an Imperial General Staff reflected the reforms the government was able to achieve despite the problem of the Lords. Asquith was not himself a &#145;new Liberal&#146;, but he saw the need for a change in assumptions about the individual's relationship to the state, and he was fully aware of the political risk to the Liberals of a Labour Party on its left flank. Like many of his ministers, he was rather insulated from the party and from the Liberal intelligentsia, and he was never a man to spend time in the Commons' tea-room and bars.<br>
<br>On the question of votes for women, Asquith was, however, not merely unwilling to enable but was actively opposed, as he had been since at least the 1880s, and especially from 1892, when he spoke and campaigned against A. K. Rollit's bill, which R. B. Haldane sponsored. In this, he differed from his closest political friends, Sir Edward Grey and Haldane. Asquith dismissed arguments about political rights, brushing &#145;aside all these abstractions and metaphysical points&#146;  (speech of 6 May 1913, Asquith, <span class="italic">Speeches</span>, 176), and focused on two points: proponents of change must establish a clear demand that most women wanted the vote&#151;he believed from an early stage that women looked on the vote &#145;with languid and imperturbable indifference&#146;  (Fulford, 81), and they must establish that the absence of enfranchised women meant that parliament neglected &#145;the special interest and needs of the excluded class&#146;  (speech of 13 May 1913, Asquith, <span class="italic">Speeches</span>, 181). Asquith's intransigent attitude, if somewhat muted by cabinet office, made him the focus of attention. From 1906 Asquith was an especial target of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), which sometimes linked his opposition to the female franchise with his enduring unpopularity over the Featherstone incident. He was frequently hectored and sometimes hustled, notably on the golf course at Lympne and Lossiemouth; the windows of 10 Downing Street were broken on several occasions; and informal conventions of British political life, by which cabinet ministers behaved much like other male citizens walking unguarded in streets, hotels, and shops, were interrupted and often suspended. The method of the campaigns of the WSPU did not convince Asquith that most women wanted the vote. As Roger Fulford observed, &#145;The more the women marched, the less his reason marched with them. Therefore the work of the militants strengthened his opposition to the vote&#146;  (Jenkins, <span class="italic">Asquith</span>, 247). Asquith traded on cabinet differences, so that no government measure was proposed despite a majority in the Liberal Party that it should be. In March 1909 he voted in the minority in the Commons against Geoffrey Howard's bill, while recognizing that such a measure, to be enacted, would need government support. The &#145;<span class="roman">Conciliation Bill</span>&#146; of 1910, by a parliamentary committee during a suspension of militancy, was intended to gain such support, but its bias towards property as a suffrage qualification again lost it cabinet backing, Asquith speaking grudgingly on it. In 1911 Asquith told the king that a majority of the cabinet favoured assisting the passing of a bill; it was agreed that in 1912 some government time be allocated, but in that year the bill failed its second reading.<br>
<br>Asquith's difficulty was political as well as personal: a bill extending existing franchises to women was likely to advantage the tories. More general franchise reform&#151;there had been none since 1884&#151;was on the Liberal agenda, and Asquith announced in July 1912 that the fourth <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> would be open to a female franchise amendment. The cabinet agreed to treat it as an open question. However, the tactic misfired: in January 1913 the speaker, James Lowther, declared that such an amendment would so alter the bill as to require its withdrawal and reintroduction. The government abandoned the whole of its <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, and no franchise reform was passed by the outbreak of war, the government's <span class="roman">Plural Voting Bill</span> of 1913 passing the Commons but being rejected in the Lords. It is unlikely that Asquith anticipated Lowther's pronouncement, or that the process of 1911&#150;12 was an elaborate and deliberate red herring. Even so, the result was welcome enough: &#145;The Speaker's <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> has bowled over the Women for this Session&#151;a great relief&#146; Asquith wrote  (letter of 27 Jan 1913, <span class="italic">Letters to Venetia Stanley</span>, 27). By conflating the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> with the enfranchisement of women, Asquith risked what Gladstone had deliberately avoided in 1884: bringing down franchise reform for the sake of sexual equality. The difficulty of achieving substantial franchise reform for males only was of course far greater in 1913 than in 1884: none the less, the tactic of a private amendment to a government bill proved a self-defeating device. Faced with hunger strikes by increasingly frustrated militant members of the WSPU, the government passed the <span class="roman">&#145;Cat and Mouse Act&#146;</span> in 1913 permitting forcible feeding.<br>
<br>As leader of a government in part sustained by Labour MPs, Asquith's handling of industrial matters had to be especially astute. He did not find this easy. His legalistic language disconcerted trade unionists already very uneasy as a result of the Osborne judgment of 1909. Asquith's government took its time in reversing the consequences of the judgment. Asquith's attempts to prevent a rail strike in August 1911 failed, and Lloyd George's blandishments were required to encourage the men back to work. In 1912, as the government embarked in the king's speech of 14 February on a major legislative programme to take advantage of the <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span>, a national coal strike was threatened. Despite Asquith's leading a group of the cabinet in negotiation with the owners and the Miners' Federation, the strike began on 29 February. Asquith countered by passing in a week the <span class="roman">Coal Mines (Minimum Wage) Bill</span>, an important measure in which Asquith went to considerable lengths to end the strike, but without establishing a national minimum wage. His approach was successful in that the strike ended, although the Labour amendments to the bill had been defeated. This industrial crisis exhausted Asquith, far more than the protracted constitutional negotiations of the previous year or the Irish struggles of the next two. Austen Chamberlain noted that Asquith spoke &#145;under great emotion, his voice breaking and tears in his eyes if not actually running down his cheeks&#146;  (Rowland, 2.152).<br>
<br>Asquith stood by his colleagues Lloyd George, Rufus Isaacs, and the master of Elibank during the Marconi scandal and inquiry by select committee in 1912&#150;13, when political convenience might have led to their dismissal. It was characteristic of Asquith that he never made capital of this loyalty, though his support for Lloyd George cost him dear with the Unionists and their press, and the question remained surprisingly prominent even after the end of the war  (Searle, chaps. 8 and 14).<h2>
<a name="HomeruleforIrelandanddisestablishmentforWales"></a>Home rule for Ireland and disestablishment for Wales</h2>The king's speech of February 1912 included three major measures, unfinished business of the Gladstonian days: a <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Bill</span>, Welsh disestablishment, and a fourth <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. None of these measures was in operation when war was declared on 4 August 1914. The <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span> had cleared the road in an absolute sense, but traffic down it was still very slow. As is shown above, franchise reform failed when conflated with the question of female suffrage. Though an authority on Welsh disestablishment since the 1894 bill, Asquith was not involved in detail with the measure, which passed the Commons and was rejected by the Lords, the process repeated in 1913; in 1914 it passed the Commons, was subject to prevarication, but eventually passed (on 17 September 1914) in the Lords, its provisions being suspended until the end of the war.<br>
<br>Welsh disestablishment sprang from the heart of the Liberal Party. Irish home rule was a more ambivalent question for the Liberal Party. It would be wrong to see it simply as a price to be paid to the Irish home-rulers. The maintenance of Ireland within the Union&#151;the declared aim of all British political parties&#151;required that the home-rulers should have their turn once the political arithmetic permitted it. The <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span> was the essential prologue to what was certain to be an epic struggle: that the Unionist opposition was to threaten an epic battle was insufficiently anticipated (though pardonably) by Asquith.<br>
<br>Heavily involved in the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span>, Asquith (unlike Gladstone in 1886 and 1893) was not a member of the cabinet committee which in 1911 planned the third <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span>. Lord Loreburn, the lord chancellor, and Augustine Birrell, the Irish secretary, strongly opposed any special treatment for Ulster. Asquith later wrote: &#145;I always thought (and said) that, in the end, we should probably have to make some sort of bargain about Ulster as the price of Home Rule&#146;  (Asquith to Churchill, September 1913, Jalland, 67). Whether he should therefore from the start have tried for a &#145;home rule within home rule&#146; solution for Ulster has been much debated. Bonar Law, who succeeded Balfour as Unionist leader in 1911, warned Asquith at the start of the session of 1912, the latter recalled, that he would have to show himself &#145;very vicious&#146;  (Asquith, <span class="italic">Memories</span>, 1.202). Asquith probably underrated the extent to which Bonar Law would live down to his word, or to which the Unionists, having now lost their permanent Lords veto as well as three consecutive general elections, would &#145;play the Orange card&#146;.<br>
<br>Central to the Liberal case&#151;and here Asquith, whatever his earlier reluctance about the primacy of home rule in the Liberal programme, was in the mainstream of Liberal opinion&#151;was the idea of a constitutional settlement by constitutional means. Representative government presupposes that political questions can be solved within its terms. The prime minister could not proceed on the assumption that the opposition (which called itself the party of the constitution) would advocate armed resistance to correctly enacted legislation. Asquith always took a straightforwardly tough view of such matters, and Liberal oppositions had always been strictly constitutional in their approach to Conservative legislation. If Asquith was na&iuml;ve in his approach to Ulster, it was a na&iuml;vety publicly required of a prime minister in such a context, whatever his private view. Moreover, the extent to which Ulster was or was not part of Ireland for constitutional purposes was to an extent an issue for debate, and it was very generally held, not only by Liberals and home-rulers, that Ireland without Ulster was not a viable entity. Within Liberalism the Ulster question was seen as at most a minor element in a complex constitutional proposal, for the cabinet had its mind on &#145;Home Rule all round&#146;, with the problem of England at least as large as that of Ulster. The Liberal Party expected Asquith to lead as a Liberal, and not as leader of a quasi-coalition in which the Unionists called the tune. A further complication lay in assessing the objectives of the Unionists. Their stated aim was the defeat of the whole <span class="roman">Irish Home Rule Bill</span>, using Ulster as the jemmy to prise open the door. If that was really the objective, then there was no point in Liberal concession on Ulster. But if the Unionist objective was, in fact, the more limited one of Ulster exclusion from an Irish home-rule parliament, there was room for negotiation and perhaps settlement. Only time would require the Unionists to define their position.<br>
<br>Asquith introduced the third <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Bill</span> on 11 April 1912; it passed the Commons by majorities usually over ninety, an amendment by Agar-Robartes in June to exclude the four most protestant counties of Ulster being defeated by sixty-nine votes. As in 1886 and 1893, the financial provisions of the bill were among the most contentious of its details; on 11 November 1912 Sir Frederick Banbury, a Unionist MP, carried an amendment (limiting the payment to the Irish exchequer to &pound;2.5 million per annum). This led to an extended dispute, during which the Commons' sitting was suspended. On 1 January 1913 Sir Edward Carson, the leader of the Irish Unionists, moved that Ulster be excluded from the bill; the proposal was defeated by ninety-seven votes, but the initiative for a settlement had begun to pass to the opposition. The bill passed the Commons on 16 January 1913 and was rejected after a few days' debate in the Lords. On 9 June 1913 Asquith again moved the second reading in the Commons, as the bill began to earn its passage under the <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span>; it received its third reading on 7 July by 128 votes and was rejected by the Lords on 15 July, Lord Lansdowne, the Unionist leader, having carried a motion that, notwithstanding the procedures of the <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span>, the Lords would not consider the bill until it had been the subject of a general election.<br>
<br>The way was now clear for the enactment of the bill under the <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span>, once it had passed the Commons for the third time. In that sense, Asquith could congratulate himself: with very few exceptions his party and his government had remained united behind this major constitution proposal, which had received substantial majorities in the Commons. Alarmed, the Unionist leadership played the royal card&#151;their final constitutional fling&#151;requesting George V to veto the bill and/or to dissolve parliament or hold a referendum. Asquith received memoranda of 11 August and 22 September 1913 from the king putting what was, in effect, the Unionist case for a dissolution; he replied to them with dismissive equanimity, warning George V that he risked making the crown &#145;the football of contending factions&#146;. Asquith now hoped that the Unionist leaders would recognize the inevitability of the position, at least with respect to home rule for the majority of Ireland. Secret conversations with Bonar Law on 14 October and 6 November discussed this possibility, Bonar Law thinking the agreement more conclusive than Asquith intended. Asquith also discussed the situation with John Redmond, the home-rule leader, a difficult matter, for to press Redmond into accepting an Ireland of twenty-six counties only was to risk breaking Redmond's hold on Irish home-rule opinion. Despite this, the cabinets of November 1913 worked towards a compromise solution of temporary exclusion for Ulster from a home-rule settlement. These various horses proved, however, too complex to keep in harness, and the talks collapsed in January 1914. For Asquith this was serious, because the point was being reached after which an opening to a solution seemed unlikely.<h2>
<a name="Asquithin1914"></a>Asquith in 1914</h2>Asquith started the year of 1914 in good spirits. His emotional state, so low in the early months of 1912, had revived through his epistolary love affair with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41069/', "Venetia Stanley")</script>, which began in earnest in the spring of 1912 and was a source of genuine solace to him until May 1915. Asquith had always enjoyed the company of women, and since his first wife's death in 1891 had come to rely on intelligent women as props. His marriage with his second wife, Margot, continued, but in terms of the premiership she had become a burden rather than a solace. Though not much affected by its political views, Asquith enjoyed the company of the youthful Liberal intelligentsia which gathered round his son Raymond, and his correspondence with Venetia Stanley quickly adopted its argot, with constant use of nicknames and playful allusions of an intellectually teasing sort. Asquith has been much criticized for the time he lavished on Venetia, but the daily letters would not have taken his fluent pen more than a few minutes: far less time than if he had been visiting her as his mistress in a physical sense.<br>
<br>Venetia Stanley's place in history has peculiar significance, for the reticent Asquith unbuttoned his thoughts to her regularly with an openness lacking in his otherwise infrequent series of correspondence. In the fateful year of 1914 these letters have a beguiling if uncertain importance. Venetia Stanley was well informed about the world of affairs, but she was not a colleague, and Asquith was not writing a diary in the form of letters: he was conducting an emotional and intellectual love affair, and the letters are necessarily therefore slanted to Venetia's interests.<br>
<br>Asquith in 1914 turned sixty-two. He made something of a fetish of untidy dress, curious in one of so tidy a mind. Since 1905 concerned references are to be found in private correspondence about Asquith's drinking. By 1911 the question was a quasi-public one, as during one evening of the committee stage of the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span> he seemed at least tipsy, slumped on the Treasury bench. His friendship with Venetia Stanley seems for a time to have countered and even reversed what some have seen as a tendency towards alcoholism, and there is no evidence that it affected his general political capacity. After coming under fire on visiting the front in 1916, Asquith had a couple of large brandies when dining with Haig; Haig carefully noted the extent of Asquith's drinking, but later added: &#145;Mr. Asquith has such a clear and evenly balanced mind. Even in his cups he was never fuddled, but knew exactly what he had seen and said during the day and to whom he had spoken&#146;  (R. Blake, ed., <span class="italic">The Private Papers of Douglas Haig</span>, 1952, 166). When Lytton Strachey met Asquith just before the war, he noted that<blockquote>though his appearance on the whole was decidedly donnish&#151;small and sleek and not too well made in the details&#151;his hands were different. Small and plump they were too; but there was a masterfulness in them and a mobility which made them remarkable. (note of May 1918, M. Holroyd, <span class="italic">Lytton Strachey</span>, 2, 1968, 111)</blockquote>The Asquiths gave up Archerfield in 1911, and in July 1912 moved into The Wharf, Sutton Courtenay, on the Thames near Oxford; it was Asquith's rather modest country house for the rest of his life. He continued to spend part of the summer&#151;usually August&#151;in Scotland, playing golf, on duty at Balmoral, and visiting his constituency. When he went abroad for a holiday, it was usually to France, and usually to the French riviera. Asquith kept up quite well with the literature of his day, though he had no inclination&#151;unlike his Liberal predecessors Rosebery and Gladstone&#151;to pronounce on it publicly through articles and reviews. He enjoyed playing cards&#151;usually bridge&#151;after dinner; Lord Jowitt,  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 January 1956), and Lady Violet Bonham Carter both testified in the 1950s that Asquith never played bridge after lunch or before dinner. His circle comprised Margot's friends and his children's friends, and a few political figures&#151;Lord and Lady Crewe, the Churchills, the McKennas, and some younger members of his government such as Edwin Montagu and Harold Baker.<br>
<br>No prime minister can have found his work less burdensome. Asquith was not a worrier. He slept well and, once decided on a course of action, he was imperturbable if not openly urgent in its pursuit. Churchill wrote of Asquith that the latter's mind &#145;opened and shut smoothly and exactly, like the breech of a gun&#146;  (W. S. Churchill, &#145;H. H. Asquith&#146;, <span class="italic">Great Contemporaries</span>). Asquith was an optimist. Though he had lost the religious faith of his youth, he had not lost the mid-Victorian optimism of his early days: political processes, he appears to have believed, and his actions certainly suggested, would work for good because human beings were at bottom sensible creatures. There was a curious serenity about H. H. A., as he normally signed himself to friends.<h2>
<a name="Irelandin1914"></a>Ireland in 1914</h2>The political world prepared for the third round of the Commons versus the Lords on the <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Bill</span>, in which the legal winner, the Commons, was already known. The organization of the Ulster Volunteers and the attitude of the Unionist leaders showed, however, that a legal result would not in itself carry the day. On 22 January 1914 Asquith's cabinet decided to propose an Ulster veto on any legislation of the Dublin parliament affecting that province. The king on 5 February told Asquith the cabinet's proposal was insufficient and warned that the army's loyalty could not be taken for granted, a warning that proved correct. Negotiations began with Redmond to provide for a temporary Ulster opt-out. The army had been used often enough to coerce Catholics in the south and west of Ireland, but it had not previously faced the prospect of coercing the protestants of the north. On 20 March, about sixty cavalry officers stationed at the Curragh, near Dublin, were reported by Brigadier-General Hubert Gough to prefer dismissal to involvement in military operations against Ulster, an episode soon known as the Curragh mutiny. This followed a maladroit series of statements by John Seely, secretary for war, and questions put to the officers by Sir Arthur Paget, commander-in-chief in Ireland (&#145;Paget's tactless blundering and Seely's clumsy phrases&#146;, Asquith thought; Jenkins, <span class="italic">Asquith</span>, 310). Subsequently, two officers and Seely resigned, Asquith taking over as secretary for war on 31 March (at the consequent by-election, he was unopposed in his East Fife constituency).<br>
<br>On 24 April the Ulster Volunteers, led by Sir William Adair and Major McCalmont MP, illegally shipped in cargoes of guns and ammunition at Larne. The cabinet did not feel strong enough to arrest Adair and McCalmont, despite the urging of the Irish viceroy. On 12 May Asquith announced that the <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Bill</span> would be accompanied by an <span class="roman">Amending Bill</span> with special provision for Ulster, and on 25 May the <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Bill</span> received its third reading in the Commons (for the third time) and under the <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span> was ready for the royal assent (not in this instance a foregone conclusion) and enactment. The <span class="roman">Amending Bill</span> was reshaped by the Lords in June 1914 to the distress of Liberal and Irish home-rule MPs. At issue were timing and the definition of &#145;Ulster&#146;. Discussions with the Unionists led to an all-party conference chaired by George V, an unprecedented act by a monarch (at least since George III), which began on 21 July, the king attending only the opening session, and lasted until 24 July. The conference was amicable but inconclusive. On 24 July the cabinet decided to introduce an amended <span class="roman">Amending Bill</span>, conceding much of what the Unionists at the conference had demanded. Events then pushed even Ireland to the rear.<br>
<br>Did Asquith bring Ireland to the edge of civil war in July 1914, or had the process of politics worked, as he intended, towards a compromise solution? Asquith had made one large gain: by taking part in the king's conference, the Unionist leadership could no longer claim that the Ulster question was also a means of preventing home rule altogether. If the issue really was one of timing and definitions with respect to the northern protestants, then Asquith had gained the chief objective of the past three years: a <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Act</span>, albeit with a separate settlement for &#145;Ulster&#146; without a time limit (the detail agreed at the conference on 24 July). Whether the Unionists would have engaged in civil war over the definition of the boundaries of &#145;Ulster&#146; cannot, of course, be known.<h2>
<a name="Foreignpolicyandwar"></a>Foreign policy and war</h2>After the cabinet's discussion of Ireland on 24 July 1914, Sir Edward Grey, the foreign secretary, drew the cabinet's attention to Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. Asquith had on the whole been willing to leave foreign policy to his foreign secretary, one of his oldest political friends. His was the opposite of the approach of Salisbury (who had been his own foreign secretary) and Gladstone (who saw the premier's relationship with his foreign secretary as almost a marriage). While Asquith had a good grasp of the politics of the Foreign and Colonial offices, he did not see himself as pro-actively contributing to their development. In the many battles between those offices and the various radical organizations which flourished within the Liberal Party, Asquith saw himself more as a peacemaker than a protagonist. Remarkably, in view of later allegations that foreign policy was run by a Liberal Imperialist cabal, Asquith was apparently not involved in the decision in 1906 to hold Anglo-French military conversations and, moreover, did not learn of them until the rest of the cabinet was briefed by Grey in 1911. This shows the extent to which he did not discuss policy with Grey, for if he had, the conversations would have been bound to come to the fore. In November 1911 Asquith enunciated that any such conversations must be noncommittal and have cabinet approval, but this was to miss the point of the conversations, whose very existence had implications of commitment, however unexplicit. He wrote later of the conversations &#145;as one of the most curious examples in his memory of a concurrence of untoward events working to a conclusion which no one intended and no one could defend&#146;  (Koss, 143).<br>
<br>It was a considerable difficulty that the Liberal cabinet, which fairly reflected the party on this question, was so divided on questions of defence expenditure and, to a lesser degree, on foreign policy, that the prime minister's inevitable tactic was to keep such issues away from the cabinet except when necessary, in meeting a crisis or in agreeing the estimates. Details of policy were discussed in bodies such as the committee of imperial defence (CID), of which Asquith was chairman, but there was an absence of general coherence; during the early years of Asquith's premiership of the CID he &#145;all but abandoned regular meetings of the full Committee&#146;  (d'Ombrain, 17). In fact, the Foreign Office's policy of facing both ways was more generally congenial (to both political parties) than is sometimes allowed, for it not only allowed the various factions in the government to coalesce around it but it also wisely avoided a decision between the spectrum of conflicting priorities from the traditional &#145;blue water&#146; policy (by which the primary objective was naval security against invasion from Europe) to the new &#145;continental strategy&#146; (which anticipated military involvement in Europe). A definitive commitment to either of these would have had profound foreign policy implications, involving a high-risk strategy of either abstention from or clear commitment to continental war, and Asquith was surely wise to keep Britain's options open.<br>
<br>Asquith intervened on a number of occasions to enable compromises among cabinet members to be reached, notably in 1909, over the programme for building the dreadnoughts (his compromise was that four ships be laid down at once, with four more to follow by 1910), and in 1910&#150;11. In 1910 he appointed a cabinet committee on foreign affairs, partly to defuse cabinet differences. This was initially useful, but did not continue beyond the summer of 1911. It was defunct by the time of the Agadir crisis of that year, when Lloyd George's speech at the Mansion House, on 21 July 1911, marked a coming together of most of the cabinet behind a determined resistance to Germany's attempt to dictate the course of events. On 23 August 1911 Asquith chaired a meeting of the CID called to determine British military and naval strategy in the event of war. Soon after, however, he provided a compromise when an angry cabinet discussed the recently revealed Anglo-French conversations, by which the possibility of British military or naval intervention was excluded from the conversations; in fact, conversations continued, carefully stopping short of infringing the compromise. In 1911 he also made the important decision to move Winston Churchill to the Admiralty, a move which was a <i>sine qua non</i> of the advocacy of the Dardanelles campaign and of the political crisis of 1915. In 1912 Haldane was sent to Berlin (unsuccessfully) to encourage the Germans to reduce their naval spending. In October&#150;November 1912 the cabinet, under Asquith's guidance, agreed without significant dissent that consultation between British and French defence experts did not commit their governments. The attrition of events and Asquith's habitual patience had produced a greater coherence within the cabinet: &#145;it is probably true to say that the cabinet was more united on foreign policy in 1913 than it had been for many years past&#146;  (Robbins, 20).<br>
<br>The policy on which Asquith and his cabinet united remained ambivalent. Germany, step by step, appeared the danger to peace, but the British government did not seriously expect soon to be engaged in war. A fractious cabinet had been kept together. Despite disagreement over foreign and defence policy more extreme than in any other modern British cabinet, Asquith lost no one by resignation over foreign or defence policy until August 1914.<h2>
<a name="Thedeclarationofwar"></a>The declaration of war</h2>Asquith's decision for war with Germany was the most important taken by a British prime minister in the twentieth century, and was more important than any prime ministerial decision of the nineteenth century. It not only dictated the involvement of the United Kingdom in war but affected much of the pattern of imperial, foreign, and economic history for the rest of the century. It was Asquith's decision in the sense that the mood of the cabinet was such that the ultimatum to Germany of 4 August was by no means a necessary or even a probable development, unless the prime minister supported it. Asquith, of course, did not take the decision alone, nor was there a single moment of decision; even so, the cabinet bore the responsibility for the fact that Britain found herself at war with Germany and Austria.<br>
<br>It is clear that Asquith believed Britain's stated position: she was not committed by treaty, entente, or policy to the defence of France, but by the treaty of London (1839) and Gladstone's statement of 1870 she had an interest in Belgian neutrality, even if the Belgians were willing to surrender it. The western European elements of the crisis appear to have been those which chiefly affected Asquith. Though he was chairman of the CID and war secretary, as well as prime minister, he did not assert a view or&#151;as Churchill did at the Admiralty&#151;try to make the running. The last-minute attempt to revive the idea of the congress and hold a conference of the powers was Grey's, not Asquith's, and it was the foreign secretary not the prime minister who made the vital government statement to the Commons on 3 August, in effect announcing war. This was in character.<br>
<br>It was also in character that as events unfolded Asquith was led towards involvement in war, for he had never favoured the sort of extreme analysis either of the role of war or of the national interest which would have enabled him to have been resolute enough to have resisted involvement as events unfolded in early August 1914. In particular, for Asquith to have kept the empire out of the war as the public enthusiasm for it grew from 2 August onwards would have required a determination to disregard the Foreign Office which Asquith simply lacked. Initially, and at the time of Austria's ultimatum to Serbia on 23 July, Asquith thought war likely, but thought Britain's involvement in it unlikely. But by 2 August, when he listed six points for the cabinet, the king, the leaders of the opposition, and Venetia Stanley, four of the points pointed to British involvement and the other two were not opposed to it (though, importantly, he then thought the dispatch of the British expeditionary force &#145;to help France at this moment is out of the question&#146;, apparently thinking of naval intervention if necessary; <span class="italic">Letters to Venetia Stanley</span>, 146).<br>
<br>At 1.30 a.m. on Saturday 1 August Asquith raised the king from his bed to approve a direct appeal to the tsar. On 2 August he approved the mobilization of the fleet by Churchill, and early on the morning of 3 August he, as war secretary, mobilized the army, a critical action, as any further delay would have made the British expeditionary force too late to prevent the German breakthrough. Later that day he asked Kitchener to be ready to serve. At 2 p.m. on 4 August Sir Edward Grey telegraphed Sir Edward Goschen, ambassador at Berlin, that he should ask for his passports by midnight (11 p.m. Greenwich mean time) if Germany did not give an assurance of Belgian neutrality. Asquith told the Commons of the demand and then drove in his automobile for an hour to collect his thoughts. A decision had been taken, but taken by default. Grey emphasized the need to maintain honour; Asquith responded to the public mood. Wider strategic and economic considerations seem to have played little part with Asquith. &#145;Speaking for myself personally&#146;, he told the Commons just after war began, &#145;a crucial and almost governing consideration&#146; was &#145;the position of the small States&#146;  (speech of 7 Aug 1914, Asquith, <span class="italic">Speeches</span>, 194).<br>
<br>The cabinet that foregathered in 10 Downing Street to await Big Ben's chimes had lost only two members by resignation&#151;John Morley and John Burns&#151;a tribute, in part, to Asquith's skill of allowing process to be the agent of unity. He did not anticipate the part which Germany's discounting of Great Britain would play in her dash for victory, but he took full political advantage of it when it occurred, acting with characteristic decisiveness once Germany's intentions were apparent.<h2>
<a name="Wartimeprimeminister"></a>Wartime prime minister</h2>The political enthusiasm which developed from 2 August and continued through, at least, the early years of the war was of great advantage to the reticent Asquith: the war effort did not require encouragement or exhortation from the top. Asquith's measured and dignified speeches, spelling out in rather legalistic terms the case for the war and the case against Germany and Austria, were an appropriate antithesis to the bombast of Britain's opponents and to popular enthusiasm at home and abroad for war. Asquith's swift appointment of Kitchener in his place as war secretary fused the government with the popular mood and outflanked Unionist cautions about the Liberals' ability to wage a war, as did his judicious use of A. J. Balfour as an occasional unofficial member of cabinet.<br>
<br>Asquith was never one of those who expected the war to be &#145;over by Christmas&#146;. He spoke in the four capital cities as the United Kingdom's recruiting sergeant and warned from the first that the war would be &#145;a protracted struggle&#146;, similar to the twenty years' struggle waged against the French  (speech at the Mansion House, London, 27 Aug 1914, Asquith, <span class="italic">Speeches</span>, 212). The French wars had involved a balanced approach, comprising direct involvement of the army and the navy, the use of Britain's economic and financial strength through the provision of money and goods to her allies, and the maintenance of a tight blockade. Asquith was, therefore, not one of those who favoured a chief emphasis on the provision of men and munitions. He faced, however, a difficult dilemma which he was not fully successful in resolving. If the British were fighting for civilized standards of behaviour, national leaders should maintain those standards, which included maintaining something of the normal pattern of political and domestic life, an awkward balance to strike as the casualties rose. Asquith was to pay a heavy personal penalty for declining significantly to change his usual routine. On the other hand, a twentieth-century equivalent of the French wars must imply major changes in economic and political processes. Asquith's public warnings of what the nation should expect were only partly reflected in his actions at the strategic and executive level, and it may be that he did not fully accept the implications of his own dictum.<br>
<br>As chairman of the CID Asquith had not planned a structure to streamline decision making in the event of war. A <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span> was immediately passed, the railways were taken into government control, and other measures were instituted. In November 1914 Asquith set up a war council, originally of eight regular members  (Cassar, 54), with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33683/', "Maurice Hankey")</script> as secretary. Asquith's choice of Hankey as, in effect, his political chief of staff, was shrewd, but even so the war council did not become an efficient planning body; it existed uneasily alongside informal <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements and the traditional discussions of the cabinet. The latter continued to act as the main decision-making body, claiming authority over the whole range of the war. Remarkably, Asquith did not even match what had been Gladstone's peacetime level of agendas and minutes, and the cabinet's decisions were not minuted until Hankey became its secretary in Lloyd George's premiership.<br>
<br>Asquith expected military and naval commanders to command, but he overruled Sir John French on 31 August when the latter tried to withdraw the British expeditionary force for the time being. Popular enthusiasm had to be matched by results, and it was clear by November 1914 that these would be hard to achieve on the western front. Asquith's expectation was that the navy&#151;so painfully and controversially modernized by the Liberal government&#151;would be of active use, as well as deterring the German fleet from leaving port and thus securing the blockade. By the end of December 1914 several plans had come forward for finding a quicker means to victory than attrition and eventual breakthrough on the western front. At the cabinet of 13 January 1915 Asquith agreed to Churchill's plan for the navy to force the Dardanelles and thus make possible a much more effective allied effort on the eastern front. Asquith himself drafted the highly ambiguous minute of the decision, which subsequently caused many problems: &#145;the Admiralty should &hellip; prepare a naval expedition in February to bombard and take the Gallipoli peninsula with Constantinople as its objective&#146;. The absence of integrated planning now paid its price. The Dardanelles campaign, which began on 19 February 1915, was in effect imposed on the navy and the army by the politicians, Asquith's responsibility thus becoming the greater. When the naval bombardment failed to achieve results, it was at Asquith's insistence that Sir Ian Hamilton was appointed to command the expeditionary force, composed of British, Australian, and New Zealand troops. By late March 1915 it was clear that no rapid victory would be possible in the Dardanelles, but the expeditionary force landed on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April. The war at sea took a sharper form with the rejection of President Wilson's proposals for a general neutrality of the seas and Asquith's statement to the Commons on 1 March that &#145;there is no form of economic pressure to which we do not consider ourselves entitled to resort&#146;  (Hankey, 1.368).<br>
<br>At almost the same time a dispute within the government about the best structure to increase the supply of munitions became generally known in political circles, Asquith finding a temporary, though ineffective, compromise between Kitchener and Lloyd George in the munitions of war committee established on 8 April. Furthermore, problems of domestic supply and labour relations were becoming apparent. On 20 April Asquith spoke in Newcastle upon Tyne to munitions workers and employers. Mistranslating a statement about the next attack for one about recent attacks, he remarked of a statement that military operations were being crippled by a shortage of supply, &#145;I say there is not a word of truth in that statement&#146;  (Asquith, <span class="italic">Speeches</span>, 228), an unusual slip for a prime minister whose public utterances, almost always made from the briefest of notes, were usually so accurately phrased. It was an observation which seemed to contradict earlier remarks by Kitchener and Lloyd George (in the same speech Asquith pointedly observed that he had appointed a committee in September 1914 &#145;presided over by Lord Kitchener&#146; to oversee such matters).<h2>
<a name="Asquithscoalitiongovernment"></a>Asquith's coalition government</h2>By the spring of 1915 it was clear that Asquith's government, competently though in many respects it had met the challenge of war, was unlikely to be able to offer a victory other than that of attrition on the western front (the cost of that attrition was not yet apparent). This was consistent with Asquith's anticipation of a twenty-year conflict, but it was not what a democracy or the political class expected.<br>
<br>A bizarre dispute between Churchill and Lord Fisher led to the latter's resignation on 15 May 1915 and to Asquith ordering him to return to his post. This episode was the catalyst by which wider concerns linked up with the immediate ambitions of Lloyd George and the Unionist leadership to create the context within which a coalition was planned by Asquith and Bonar Law on 17 May.<br>
<br>Asquith acted quickly and with apparent brutality in this crisis, which, in general terms, he had probably anticipated for some time. He seemed to ignore his party, and he subordinated his ties to his oldest political associate, Lord Haldane, to the demands of the Northcliffe faction in the Unionist Party by dropping Haldane from his government&#151;though there is some indication that Asquith suggested relieving Haldane of the chancellorship at an early stage of the coalition discussions  (<span class="italic">Letters to Venetia Stanley</span>, 599). In general, however, Asquith's coalition associated the Unionists directly with the government while giving them only a minor role in it. The coalition of 1915 gave far less to the Unionists than did that of 1940 to the Labour Party. If there was to be a coalition, Asquith acted decisively to create it as much on his terms as possible. Those terms were perhaps too much to the advantage of the Liberals for Asquith's own long-term good. He underestimated the restraint the Unionist leadership had exercised&#151;in marked contrast to its earlier behaviour&#151;once war had begun. Asquith underestimated Bonar Law's capacity for constructive as well as vicious behaviour, and he underestimated the importance of enabling Bonar Law to maintain his grip on the tory party and press. When reading Bolingbroke's remark about Bishop Warburton&#151;&#145;Sir, I never wrestle with a chimney-sweep&#146;&#151;Asquith observed, &#145;A good saying, which I sometimes call to mind when I am confronting Bonar Law&#146;  (Jenkins, <span class="italic">Asquith</span>, 367).<br>
<br>Asquith's actions in May 1915 are the more remarkable, given his discovery on 12 May that Venetia Stanley had decided to marry Edwin Montagu. Asquith's letters to her in 1914 and 1915 had become fuller and more indiscreet, about both persons and policy. They remained primarily love letters, but also became a sort of diary. In Asquith's apologia, <span class="italic">The Genesis of the War</span> (1923), dedicated to Edward Grey, he chiefly used official papers, but in <span class="italic">Memories and Reflections</span> (1928) he quoted extensively from his letters to Miss Stanley and others, describing them as &#145;contemporary notes&#146;, and explaining that while he had not &#145;kept what is technically called a &#147;Diary&#148;&#146;, he had &#145;been in the habit of jotting down irregularly my impressions of noteworthy persons and incidents while they were still fresh in my memory&#146;  (Asquith, <span class="italic">Memories</span>, 2.2). Asquith found other women to write to, notably Sylvia Henley and Kathleen Scott, widow of the explorer, but none attracted quite the <i>frisson</i> of disclosure that constituted the distinctive feature of Asquith's letters to Miss Stanley.<h2>
<a name="Leadingthecoalition"></a>Leading the coalition</h2>The establishment of a coalition government was not accompanied by much fresh structural planning. Asquith replaced the war council with the Dardanelles committee, composed of six Liberals, six Unionists, and one non-politician (Kitchener), to consider policy for all theatres of war  (Cassar, 111). The committee did not significantly alter planning or policy making. Asquith's stiffness of manner with men and his endemic contempt for most Unionists made him an awkward leader of a coalition.<br>
<br>Asquith visited France in May&#150;June 1915, making speeches, patching up relations between Kitchener and Sir John French, and meeting French generals and politicians. The visit was a success, and its reporting built Asquith into something of a war leader. At a conference with the French on 5 July&#151;the first of the war&#151;Asquith gained sufficient respite for the British army on the western front for a further, and final, effort to be made at the Dardanelles. Apprehensive perhaps at the human cost of the use of Kitchener's &#145;New Armies&#146;, whose formation was nearing completion, Asquith placed high hopes on a breakout from the Anzac beachhead and a landing at Suvla Bay. Disappointed by failure in the Dardanelles, which the collapse of anti-German forces in the Balkans exacerbated, Asquith replaced Hamilton in October, but the gesture gained little. The offensives at the battle of Loos and Vimy Ridge on 25 September achieved little except the death of 65,000 British and 165,000 French troops, but they presaged the losses of 1916. On 19 October Asquith, whose health was normally so reliable as to be taken wholly for granted, became seriously unwell, apparently a physical reaction to mental strain, overwork, and lack of relaxation. &#145;I never got such a fright in my life&#146;, wrote Margot Asquith. &#145;I thought Henry was <i>absolutely done</i>. I think he thought so too&#146;  (Jenkins, <span class="italic">Asquith</span>, 376). After a fortnight he seemed restored to health, returning to an unimproved political and military situation. Though he suffered for the rest of his premiership from spasmodic bronchial trouble, he gave a general impression of well-being. Meeting him again in 1916, Lytton Strachey noted:<blockquote>I studied the Old Man with extreme vigour and really he is a corker. He seemed much larger than he did when I last saw him (just two years ago)&#151;a fleshy, sanguine, wine-bibbing, medieval Abbot of a personage &hellip; Cynical, yes, it's hardly possible to doubt it; or perhaps one should say just &#145;case-hardened&#146;. (note of May 1918, Holroyd, <span class="italic">Lytton Strachey</span>, 2.197)</blockquote>Kitchener's early pragmatic effectiveness lessened as the co-ordination of supply of materials and troops became ever more complex, and Asquith began to pay a political price for his unwillingness to provide a coherent structure for the planning of policy. Colleagues, especially Lloyd George, became restless. Asquith was reluctant to sacrifice Kitchener as his cabinet colleagues had come to desire, the field marshal being sent to the Mediterranean to report (a measure which further delayed the evacuation of Gallipoli). Asquith, as in 1914, was briefly war secretary as well as prime minister and, recovered from his illness, he used this joint office to reassert his authority to considerable effect. He might have done better if he had continued himself in this position (Churchill may have learned something from the episode, for in 1940 he made himself minister of defence). November and December 1915 were the months in which Asquith most directly affected the conduct of the war. On 11 November a war committee was established (its membership leading to the resignation of Winston Churchill). The absence of clarity about its role was not immediately apparent, but, in Hankey's view, it worked well for the first eight months of 1916  (Hankey, 2.543). The successful evacuation of Gallipoli was a behind-the-scenes political success for Asquith, but the public could not but see it as a failure. Asquith replaced Sir John French by Douglas Haig, and appointed Sir William Robertson (French's chief of staff) to be the chief of an enlarged and more powerful Imperial General Staff. These were the two decisive military appointments for the latter years of the war, for Haig and Robertson were wholly committed to the view that victory was achievable only by defeating or exhausting the Germans in the fields of Flanders. Despite Asquith's resolute action during his interim period as war secretary, 1915 ended with the government uneasy at best; the role of Kitchener, and of the army in politics, unresolved; and with the &#145;big push&#146; on the western front the allies' only serious plan.<br>
<br>Conscription, an issue within the coalition from the start, and certain to be a difficult question for the Liberal, Labour, and Irish parties, was becoming unavoidable. Asquith, characteristically, allowed its politics to evolve to the point, clarified by Lord Derby, whom Asquith appointed director-general of recruiting in October 1915, that it seemed inevitable. The cabinet approved the <span class="roman">Military Service Bill</span> on 31 December 1915 without resignation, save that of Sir John Simon. Asquith's speech to the Labour Party on 11 January 1916 enabled Henderson not to resign.<br>
<br>Despite these many difficulties and the military stalemate, Asquith's personal position was not directly challenged, though there was in the latter part of 1915 fairly sustained denigration of him in the right-wing press. Moreover, Lloyd George, Asquith's most likely challenger among the Liberals, was considerably discredited by his constant politicking, and his attention to his own department was questioned. Asquith's handling of the military and political changes of late 1915 showed why his leadership was both criticized and felt indispensable: the government seemed to act slowly and to follow rather than to lead. Yet this was just what the coalition government seemed to need if it was to hold together. The fact that the rest of the cabinet relied on Asquith to hold them together as a sort of paternal troubleshooter in itself prevented the development of maturer behaviour among its members; Asquith's chief contribution thus had, in this respect, a negative value.<h2>
<a name="Thewarin1916"></a>The war in 1916</h2>By the end of January 1916, Asquith's government had put in place the constituent elements of that year's war: a mobilized work and fighting force dedicated to defeating the Germans on the western front as the defensive war of attrition moved into its active phase. But political exigencies and uncertainty about public reaction to conscription meant that the system was initially partial. In March 1916 Asquith showed little interest in Colonel House's visit to London on behalf of President Wilson to suggest exploratory talks about peace. According to Hankey, Asquith &#145;affects to regard the whole thing as humbug, and a mere manoeuvre of American politics&#146;  (Hankey, 2.480). Even so, House's visit was followed by the establishment of a reconstruction committee by Asquith, which discussed the possibility of a &#145;peace book&#146; (on the analogy of the war book).<br>
<br>In late March and early April 1916 Asquith was on the continent, visiting Paris and Rome, where he made a number of successful public appearances and speeches. At the Paris conference (26&#150;8 March) he agreed to leave to the generals the timing of the allied offensive planned for 1916. Asquith reported to the war cabinet on 7 April 1916 that it was clear that French pressure made British involvement in a large offensive unavoidable  (French, 184&#150;5). The same day he re-established the cabinet committee on the co-ordination of military and financial effort. He returned to find a further crisis over conscription, engineered by those who wanted its general, rather than its partial, application. Asquith felt close to resignation and he told the Commons that the government was divided to the point of near disintegration. On 27 April Asquith had to hurry to the Commons where Long's bill extending conscription was in difficulties. The prime minister withdrew the bill and himself introduced a new measure for general conscription and saw it through the house. Hankey noted:<blockquote>He did not much like the job and was not at his best. The House was astonishingly cold. The fact was that the people who wanted compulsory service did not want Asquith, and those who wanted Asquith did not want compulsory service. Nevertheless Asquith faced the situation with his usual courage. (Hankey, 2.276)</blockquote>In the midst of the conscription crisis, the Easter rising occurred in Dublin; on hearing the news with Hankey, &#145;Asquith merely said &#147;Well, that's something&#148; and went off to bed&#146;  (Hankey, 2.475), an example of Asquith's sang-froid, not of a lack of interest in Ireland. Following Birrell's resignation as Irish secretary, Asquith, as he had twice done with the war secretaryship, took on the office himself, went to Dublin, investigated the position following the suppression of the rising, and began a process, continued by Lloyd George in the summer of 1916, of trying to rescue constitutionalism in Ireland from Sinn F&eacute;in. Even in the midst of war, some Unionists in the Lords played the Orange card and the plan collapsed. Asquith incurred much criticism for his handling of the consequences of the rising; in retrospect, it can be seen as the last chance for a constitutional solution within the Union. He thus had direct experience of the context in which <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32320/', "Roger Casement")</script> was convicted of treason. In July 1916 the cabinet discussed Casement's case on four occasions. Asquith, according to Jenkins, &#145;would have preferred a reprieve based on medical evidence&#146;  (Jenkins, <span class="italic">Asquith</span>, 404), but the cabinet he chaired decided on execution.<br>
<br>On 5 June 1916 the problem of Kitchener's position was resolved by his death at sea. Asquith again acted as war secretary while he pondered on the succession; he delayed too long to appoint Bonar Law, which would have put the Unionists on the spot as well as tying them more closely to the coalition, for Bonar Law, in a meeting with Lloyd George on 11 June, agreed to decline if asked. With some misgivings on 24 June Asquith appointed Lloyd George&#151;who had threatened resignation if not appointed&#151;to the secretaryship and to the vice-presidency of the war committee. He took the seals of office on 7 July  (Cassar, 188&#150;9). Asquith had saved Lloyd George's life by sending him to Ireland instead of, as planned, with Kitchener to Russia; it was by no means yet apparent that the same episode and its d&eacute;nouement were the prologue to Asquith's own political doom.<br>
<br>Unexpectedly, the Brusilov offensive of June 1916 by the Russians against the Austrians gave the allies their best gains of the war and, though the offensive was not fully capitalized upon, gave an optimistic tone to the battle of the Somme which began on 1 July. Such optimism was soon quashed, with 57,470 British casualties on the first day, but the Somme offensive continued. On 6 September Asquith visited the battle zone, coming within range of the howitzers. He and his party sheltered in a dugout during a German bombardment. Hankey observed: &#145;The Prime Minister was as usual quite composed, but I thought his hand was trembling rather, and no wonder&#146;  (Hankey, 2.513). Asquith and Hankey advised Haig not to fritter away the new tanks, which were unlikely to be able to cope with the terrain; their advice was ignored. On this day he met his son Raymond, who had ridden over from his regiment. Asquith thus saw at first hand something of the character of the battle of the Somme, and he experienced its consequences directly, for on 15 September Raymond was killed, the news reaching The Wharf on 17 September. Raymond's death, much more than Venetia Stanley's marriage, did impair the prime minister's effectiveness. He missed several cabinets and sometimes found concentration difficult. But, like Hankey, whose brother was killed at much the same time, Asquith found that a close relative's death stiffened his resolve to see through stated policies, and he was not one of those who felt the Somme offensive hard to defend. Even so, with three other sons still in the field, his enthusiasm for the war can hardly but have been dulled. Asquith's state of mind as he and his cabinet allowed Haig to continue the Somme offensive through the wet summer of 1916 can only be guessed at. By the end of November, there were 415,000 British casualties from the battles on the Somme.<h2>
<a name="ThefallofAsquithsgovernment"></a>The fall of Asquith's government</h2>The huge casualties of the Somme implied a further drain on manpower and further problems for an economy now struggling to meet the demands made of it. They also implied either a stalemate or another expensive offensive. The brief hope of Romanian support was quickly over. Shipping losses from the U-boats had begun to be significant. Press opinion overtly called for change, cartoons referred to &#145;Squiffy&#146; (the Unionists' nickname for the prime minister), and George Robey added an Asquithian verse into his hit music-hall song &#145;In other words&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Just stem this tide of ignorant conjecture,<br>
</div>
<div>Remain inert and dormant just like me,<br>
</div>
<div>And cultivate spontaneous quiescence,<br>
</div>
<div>In other words, Wait and See!!!<br>
</div> (McCallum, 121)</blockquote>It was a year since Asquith had asserted himself during his brief spell as war secretary in November&#150;December 1915. Early in November 1916 he called for all departments to write memoranda on how they saw the pattern of 1917, the prologue to a general reconsideration of the allies' position. On a visit to Paris on 4 November with Lloyd George, he seemed to Hankey restored to action and good spirits. Lloyd George, however, came to the view at the Paris conference that the present structure of command and direction of policy could not win the war and might well lose it. He agreed with Hankey that on their return to London he (Lloyd George) should raise with Bonar Law, before speaking to Asquith, the question of &#145;a small War Committee to handle the day to day conduct of the war, with full powers&#146;, independent of the cabinet, &#145;in close touch with the P.M.&#146;, but without his being a member of it. Lloyd George did raise this question and one of the most elaborate political quadrilles of British political history ensued, in which any one of Asquith, Lloyd George, Bonar Law, Balfour, or (even) Carson might have emerged at the head of the dance. On 2 December Asquith agreed to a version of the new structure, as refined by Hankey. On 4 December <span class="italic">The Times</span> published the plan, leaked by Carson but taken by Asquith to have been leaked by that inveterate leaker, Lloyd George; <span class="italic">The Times</span> combined this with a strong attack on Asquith. Later that day, the sands shifting beneath him, Asquith attempted to reconstruct his government without conceding the loss of power which the new structure implied. He was unsuccessful and on 5 December he resigned. The king called a conference of senior members of the Liberal and Unionist parties but it was fruitless. On 7 December the king summoned Lloyd George, who formed a second coalition government, the party balance of ministerial posts being the reverse of that of May 1915. Almost all the members of Asquith's cabinet had thought him indispensable, and so had he; once he was gone, they quickly learned to do without him.<br>
<br>Asquith took his fall with what seemed to be his characteristic equanimity; J. M. Keynes, Virginia Woolf reported, dined with the Asquiths &#145;two nights after their downfall; though Asquith himself was quite unmoved, Margot started to cry into the soup &hellip; Maynard has a great admiration for Asquith who had perpetually to stand buffer between [Lloyd] George and McKenna&#146;  (N. Nicolson, ed., <span class="italic">Letters of Virginia Woolf</span>, 2, 1994, 133). Even so, Asquith had not gone readily, and the circumstances of his leaving left him with a permanent sense of affront. He never again held office and was not willing, as Balfour was, to play the elder statesman's role in making the war machine work. He was not a great war leader, and he never attempted to portray himself as such. But he was not a bad one, either. Wartime to him was an aberration, not a fulfilment. In terms of the political style of Britain's conduct of the war, that was an important virtue, but it led Asquith to underestimate the extent to which twentieth-century warfare was an all-embracing experience, and his sometimes almost perverse personal reluctance to appear constantly busy and unceasingly active told against him in the political and press world generally. Bonar Law had advised Asquith in a letter that &#145;In war it is necessary not only to be active but to seem active&#146;  (Blake, 290). Asquith was as a wartime premier much more active than his reputation suggested; it was his determination to maintain something of the pattern of his normal private life which offended men such as Bonar Law (and even in 1955 Robert Blake's comments in his life of Bonar Law occasioned a public wrangle). In the Second World War Churchill drew the lesson, and his private life and necessary relaxation were much more discreetly pursued.<br>
<br>Asquith was in no sense unusual among his compatriots in seeing the war as something during which normal procedures would to a considerable extent continue. He had to lead a cabinet which expected to govern and a Commons which expected to sit, and debate, and perhaps even be dissolved for a general election. Asquith's rather humdrum, unfussy approach&#151;as personally unassertive and non-bombastic as was possible in the circumstances&#151;set a style that was to be a salutary example to Lloyd George and, in the Second World War, to Churchill, both politicians to whom war was something of a fulfilment. Hankey, who saw him more closely between 1914 and 1916 than any other person, gave him a remarkably high encomium, and believed the causes of Asquith's coalition's failure lay in &#145;an inherent political weakness rather than in the leadership&#146;  (Hankey, 2.570). Asquith, Hankey believed, &#145;never wavered in his unswerving determination to see it [the war] through to final victory&#146;; he built up<blockquote>a military machine &hellip; on which his successor in office was able to build so successfully as to achieve final victory within less than two years of Asquith's fall. &hellip; His powerful and sonorous eloquence enabled him to exercise a leadership which was at the time unsurpassed in any of the nations at war. (ibid., 2.569)</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="StillleaderoftheLiberalParty"></a>Still leader of the Liberal Party</h2>Asquith did not take a peerage and he declined the Garter. He remained in the Commons and leader of the Liberal Party, his position confirmed by a vote of the party on 8 December 1916. Welcome though this was to the Liberals, it was bound to place the former prime minister in an awkward position. He knew too much and could say almost nothing. Anything he did say was bound to be seen as the sour criticism of a disappointed man, and was likely to be exploited against him. Lloyd George's coalition, for all the talk of new beginnings, deviated little from the military approach decided upon in 1915&#150;16. Asquith in May 1917 declined the offer of the lord chancellorship. He accepted the recommendations of the speaker's conference for female suffrage and proportional representation and he developed his views, first adumbrated in his speech in Dublin on 25 September 1914, for a League of Nations. In December 1917 his son Arthur was badly wounded, for the second time, just after taking command of his brigade. In 1918 Asquith gave the Romanes lecture in Oxford, &#145;On the Victorian age&#146; (reprinted in <span class="italic">Studies and Sketches</span>, 1924).<br>
<br>Post-war politics began, though this was not apparent at the time, with the publication on 7 May 1918 of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34948/', "Sir Frederick Maurice's")</script> letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> stating that Lloyd George's remarks on the number of troops available to Haig for the Passchendaele offensive were incorrect, with the implication that Haig had been intentionally starved of troops. Asquith moved a motion for a select committee of inquiry (rather than the panel of judges suggested by the government). Since there had already been royal commissions on the Dardanelles and Mesopotamia (to the former of which Asquith had given evidence) the suggestion of an inquiry was not unreasonable, and the government did not initially contest the need for one. The Liberals mishandled the debate, taken aback by Lloyd George's impassioned reaction, and Asquith's motion was defeated in 108 votes to 295. The voting list was later used by Lloyd George as a test of loyalty as to which Liberals should be given the &#145;coupon&#146; of approval (Asquith coined the description) as a coalition candidate at the general election in 1918. At that election, Asquith&#151;though his tory opponent, Sir Alexander Sprott, was not given the coupon&#151;was quite heavily defeated in East Fife, having held the seat since 1886.<br>
<br>Asquith had hoped to serve on the British delegation to the Paris peace conference, but found himself instead chairing a royal commission on Oxford and Cambridge (the first on their structure and purpose since 1850&#150;52). Whereas the 1850&#150;52 commission, in the high noon of academic liberalism, adumbrated a new view of English higher education, Asquith's made the existing structures of Oxford and Cambridge more serviceable, providing some state funding and better provision for the sciences, while confirming the already strong position of the colleges.<br>
<br>Asquith surprisingly&#151;stung perhaps by a sense that Lloyd George had thrown the Liberal Party and, to an extent, liberalism to the wall&#151;held on to political life. His was a curious position, as he was seen as &#145;whiggish&#146; but was leader of the more radical part of the semi-severed Liberal Party. Staging his own Midlothian campaign, he was elected at a by-election for Paisley in February 1920 after a bold campaign in which his daughter Violet's speeches countered the impression which he still carried of hostility to women in politics. In 1921 he attempted to rally pre-war colleagues such as Grey, Crewe, Runciman, and other younger men to political action in support of a possible alternative government rather more widely based than the remnants of the Liberal Party. Little came of this, and the initiative turned instead to a plan by some Liberals to replace Asquith with Grey, hardly a step towards the future! At the election of 1922, called as a result of the disintegration of Lloyd George's coalition, Asquith held Paisley, but not easily. The election brought home to the Liberals that they had ceased to be a central force in British politics, losing on the right to a resurgent Conservatism, and on the left to a Labour Party liberated by the extended franchise. In the elections of 1923, in which Asquith revived his free-trade rhetoric against Baldwin's protectionism, Asquith's majority in Paisley increased, the opposition vote being split between three opponents.<h2>
<a name="Privatelifeafterthewar"></a>Private life after the war</h2>Money was a serious problem for the Asquiths; and they did not have enough to support the earldom which Asquith in due course accepted. The home at 20 Cavendish Square, to which they had initially moved back, had to be sold and the cheaper (though still substantial) 44 Bedford Square bought. Both Asquiths wrote for money. Margot's <span class="italic">Autobiography</span> (2 vols., 1920&#150;22) was something of a political embarrassment to her husband. In 1923 he published <span class="italic">The Genesis of the War</span>, which had none of the panache or indiscretion of Churchill's and Lloyd George's later war memoirs. Having in 1918 published <span class="italic">Occasional Addresses</span>, in 1924 he collected more of his literary addresses and some of his reviews in <span class="italic">Studies and Sketches</span>. Asquith's four volumes of recollections&#151;<span class="italic">Fifty Years of Parliament</span> (2 vols., 1926) and <span class="italic">Memories and Reflections, 1852&#150;1927</span> (2 vols., 1928, published posthumously)&#151;were characteristically reticent and unflamboyant, but contain much interesting comment if carefully read.<br>
<br>Asquith's family provided a relaxing context for their father (known by then in the family as Old Boy). Several of his children moved in the world of Bloomsbury and the creative arts; his youngest son, Anthony (Puffin), began making films in 1926, which his father enjoyed; his daughter-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30480/', "Cynthia Asquith")</script>, J. M. Barrie's secretary and heir, was a novelist, and her husband, Herbert (Beb), was a novelist and poet as well as a lawyer; his daughter Elizabeth, who married the Romanian diplomatist and friend of Proust, Prince Antoine Bibesco, in 1919, wrote short stories and poems; even Margot was in due course to write a novel. Much more conventionally political was Violet, who had married Maurice Bonham Carter, Asquith's principal private secretary, in 1915, and saw that her father never forgot the iniquities of Lloyd George. Her unflinching loyalty was to make her a slightly dangerous champion of his posthumous political reputation. Asquith greatly enjoyed the company and the circles his family provided, and in the 1920s he stayed at Garsington Manor and other haunts of the Bloomsburyites.<h2>
<a name="Retirementfrompoliticsillnessanddeath"></a>Retirement from politics, illness, and death</h2>In the last decisive act of his long political career, Asquith put the first Labour government into office by persuading the Liberal Party, in a speech to the parliamentary party on 18 December 1923, that this was the correct course of action, a view not altogether accepted within the party, some of whom felt Asquith should have made the case for a Liberal-led minority government. Asquith's successful motion for a select committee over the government's handling of a prosecution for sedition led to the dissolution of October 1924, the Labour government being ejected, and Asquith easily losing his Paisley seat in a straight fight with Labour. The Liberal Party in the Commons fell from 159 in 1923 to 40. Asquith was offered an earldom by the king and, after reflecting on it during a holiday in Egypt, accepted. Asquith asked and received royal approval that he take the name of Oxford as his title, but, after complaints from the Harley family (who had held the title in an earlier century), the title of Oxford and Asquith was gazetted (9 February 1925). In May 1925 he also accepted the Garter. His acceptance in the English establishment seemed confirmed, with the torrid denunciations by the tory press behind him. However, later in 1925 Asquith was nominated for the chancellorship of Oxford University, Curzon's death having caused the vacancy. His success depended on the tories not opposing him, for since 1865 the university had always voted down the Liberal candidate in parliamentary elections. Lord Cave, Baldwin's lord chancellor, also stood, as Asquith suspected he might, and Asquith, though receiving impressive support from university dignitaries across the political spectrum, was heavily defeated by 987 to 441 votes. It was a humiliating conclusion to his distinguished public career, and a graceless, rather vindictive, act by the tories and country clergy of the university (which, embarrassed, elected Edward Grey unopposed two years later).<br>
<br>Asquith remained leader of the Liberal Party and of the Liberals in the Lords; Lloyd George was leader of the parliamentary party. The arrangement worked uneasily at best, with an undercurrent of acrimony. Neither man was to hold office again; Asquith was clearly &#145;winding down the coil&#146; (as Gladstone put it with respect to his latter days), but Lloyd George did not appreciate that his extensive career, as well as Asquith's, was finished. The Lloyd George Fund gave its owner a bizarre independence within the party. Asquith tried and failed to balance it by the Million Fund Appeal, launched in January 1925. When Lloyd George failed to participate in the Liberal shadow cabinet's line against the general strike in May 1926, Asquith announced that he could no longer work with him. On 12 June Asquith suffered a slight stroke. On 15 October his resignation was announced. In 1927 he for a time was confined to a wheelchair. He was able to make a final speech at York on 19 October 1927, receiving the freedom of the city. On his return to The Wharf, he was confined to bed. He died there on 15 February 1928. He had let it be known that he did not wish a public funeral. He was buried in Sutton Courtenay churchyard on 20 February, a memorial service being later held in Westminster Abbey. He was succeeded as earl of Oxford and Asquith by his grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103465/', "Julian Edward George Asquith")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Though Asquith's career ended bathetically with a too long coda of failure, its high noon shed a longer beam of light than is often perceived. Whereas Gladstone led the party of progress from the front, and Lloyd George would have liked to have done the same, Asquith's role was more subtle: he was an enabler, a reticent but firm and very loyal chairman of cabinet, content to choose men of ability and then to let leading ministers lead. His firm determination for constitutional procedure and against vested interests set an important standard and example. The combination of Asquith as prime minister and Lloyd George as dynamic chancellor was a fine formula for progressive cabinet government. Clement Attlee was in this sense Asquith's obvious heir, Harold Wilson a more ambivalent one. Moreover, the constitutional development&#151;national and regional devolution, reform of the Lords and of the voting system&#151;which Asquith's government intended but which the war deferred provided a point of reference for the rest of the century, much of its business recurring in the Blair government at the end of it. The view that Asquith was &#145;the last of the Romans&#146; and his cautious policy views in the 1920s should not obscure the fact that in his heyday Asquith was a formidable, resolute, and resourceful radical politician.<br>
<br>Asquith's biography was competently written by J. A. Spender and Cyril Asquith in two volumes (1932). The eclipse of the Liberal Party and the excitement surrounding Lloyd George's <span class="italic">War Memoirs</span> somewhat sidelined Asquith. R. B. McCallum's short life (1936) maintained interest, which revived strikingly with Roy Jenkins's biography (1964), the latter using the letters to Venetia Stanley, and for the first time naming the recipient and commenting on the relationship. The letters were then splendidly edited with a commentary by Michael and Eleanor Brock (1982). Stephen Koss's short biography (1976) was an astringent radical critique. G. H. Cassar's study, <span class="italic">Asquith as War Leader</span> (1994), was an effective rehabilitation.<br>
<br>Asquith's benign features did not make him an easy subject for caricaturists, and portrait painters such as Orpen (1909) and Fiddes Watt (1912) captured his ordinariness rather than the disguised determination which conditioned his life. Kathleen Scott's bust (<i>c</i>.1913; Tate collection) caught Asquith at the height of his powers, its shining bronze reflecting something of his mental and physical toughness.<br>
