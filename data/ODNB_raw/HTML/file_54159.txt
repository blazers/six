<span class="headword">Crichton,  William, of that ilk</span>, first Lord Crichton  (<em>d.</em> 1453), <span class="occ">administrator and courtier</span>, was the eldest son of Sir John Crichton of that ilk and his spouse, thought to have been Christian Grimslaw (who survived her husband). The family's principal seat was at Crichton in Edinburghshire, and there were important estates in Dumfriesshire, as well as in Peeblesshire and Roxburghshire. William Crichton was knighted at the coronation of James I, in May 1424. In May 1426, described as a gentleman of the king's bedchamber, he was sent with two others to treat with Erik, king of Norway and Denmark, concerning the annual payment owed to Norway since 1266 for the Scottish Western Isles. Thereafter Crichton clearly profited from the favour of James I, who in the 1430s relied mainly on barons from Lothian to act as his daily council. In 1429 Crichton began to witness crown charters and by March 1432 he had been created master of the king's household, an office he retained until at least June 1437. He was also appointed sheriff of Edinburgh and captain of Edinburgh Castle (for which he received a sizeable annual pension) about 1433, holding both posts until his death. The influence of Archibald, fifth earl of Douglas, cannot be discounted as a factor behind Crichton's promotion, but the earl was seldom at court, which allowed Crichton to strengthen his position there.<br>
<br>After the murder of James I in 1437 Crichton was increasingly prominent in the administration which ruled Scotland in the name of the young James II, especially after the earl of Douglas, who was lieutenant-general, died in June 1439. In May of that year Crichton had become chancellor, and the seal tags of many engrossed charters bear his signature, suggesting that he carefully controlled the use of the great seal. In his capacity as chancellor he was the means whereby the king's council blocked the claim of Sir Robert Erskine to the earldom of Mar, a substantial prize which in 1457 was to be denied to Erskine's son Thomas by a verdict in the crown's favour. Crichton's main rival was an unlikely one, Sir Alexander Livingston of Callendar, who had not been a court regular, but who now benefited from having control of the young king, after imprisoning the queen mother in Stirling Castle in August 1439. However hostile to each other they may have been, Crichton and Livingston came to terms, and may have co-operated in the judicial murder of the sixth earl of Douglas on 24 November 1440. The seventh and eighth earls of Douglas were antipathetic to Crichton, but sympathetic to Livingston. About 1444 Crichton was forced from office, and indeed in June 1445 he was besieged in Edinburgh Castle by forces nominally led by the king himself, though in actuality controlled by Douglas, after a year in which both sides had ravaged the other's lands.<br>
<br>An accommodation was reached: Crichton returned to court and assumed (at the same time as the heads of various other major Scottish landed families) a peerage title, making the small but significant change from the style lord of Crichton, which he had used before, to that of Lord Crichton. But he held no office, as the Livingstons and their supporters were now dominant. However, following the death in 1447 of Bishop James Bruce, who had succeeded him as chancellor, Crichton resumed his former post, before November in the same year. In 1448 he travelled to Burgundy, one of the king's ambassadors sent to arrange James II's marriage to Mary, daughter of Arnold, duke of Gueldres. On his return to Scotland, after negotiations were concluded in the spring of 1449, Crichton founded a collegiate church at Crichton. It is also thought that he transformed the tower-house of Crichton Castle into an impressive courtyard castle.<br>
<br>In September 1449 the Livingstons were dramatically ousted. Their power had been based on office holding, and Crichton now sought similar rewards for his own family. He had never been slow to attend to their interests. In the late 1430s he seems to have encouraged Sir Alexander Seton of Tullibody, later first earl of Huntly, to marry his daughter Elizabeth Crichton, after Seton divorced his first wife; Crichton cannot have been displeased when Seton then entailed his lands on his and Elizabeth's first son, excluding from the succession the son of his first marriage, greatly to the latter's chagrin. An important beneficiary of Crichton's patronage in the 1450s was his cousin <a name="cosubject_54159"></a><span class="headword">George Crichton of Cairns</span>, earl of Caithness  (<em>d.</em> 1454). The elder son of Stephen Crichton of Cairns, Edinburghshire, and an unknown mother, George had before his father's death in 1434 built up an estate mostly (but not entirely) in south-west Scotland and Lothian; his territorial designation was sometimes &#145;of Blackness&#146;, Linlithgowshire, later his main estate, rather than Cairns. Knighted by 1438, George witnessed a few crown charters during William Crichton's first tenure of office as chancellor, and was ambassador to Brittany in 1441, to negotiate the marriage of James II's sister Elizabeth. By then he was admiral of Scotland (an office he held until his death) and had succeeded his father as sheriff of Linlithgow.<br>
<br>George Crichton was involved in the troubles affecting his cousin William in 1444&#150;5, and his activities are rarely recorded thereafter until 1450. But from February in that year he was a frequent witness of crown charters and was also present on the king's council in judicial matters and in parliament as an auditor of causes. Shortly after the fall of the Livingstons he became sheriff of Stirling and keeper of Stirling Castle, and by late 1452 he was justiciar south of Forth. In June that year he was created earl of Caithness. Particularly after his elevation to the peerage (and probably at the king's instigation) he began to entail his estates, to the effect that his son and heir, James Crichton, would not succeed to either title or lands after George's death. James resented this, and incarcerated his father in Blackness Castle, which the king had to besiege in person in order to relieve the earl. A settlement was reached whereby James received the Cairns estate and (from the king) some crown lands in Perthshire, but the rest of the earl's property, along with his title, fell to the crown on George's death, which took place at Edinburgh in August 1454. George married twice. James, who was often present in parliament under James III, was the son of George's first marriage, about 1425, to a daughter (name unknown) of Sir William Douglas of Strathbrock. About 1450 George married Janet, daughter of Sir William Borthwick of that ilk, widow of Sir James Douglas of Dalkeith and former wife of Sir Colin Campbell of Glenorchy; they had a daughter, Janet, who married Robert, Lord Maxwell.<br>
<br>The records of the exchequer show sundry other minor Crichtons obtaining fees or pensions while William Crichton was dominant in government. But the fountain dried up in 1453&#150;4, when William, his son and heir, James, and his cousin George all died. William witnessed his last crown charter on 16 September 1453 and probably died shortly afterwards. His wife, Agnes (surname unknown), is presumed to have been the mother of all his known children, a son, James, and two daughters: Elizabeth married Sir Alexander Seton, while Agnes married Alexander, second Lord Glamis. <a name="cosubject_54158"></a><span class="headword">James Crichton of that ilk</span>, earl of Moray and second Lord Crichton  (<em>d.</em> 1454)<span class="occ"></span>, was knighted in October 1430, on the occasion of the baptism of James II. Another beneficiary of his father's patronage, he was appointed chamberlain by March 1451, though he does not appear to have been active in that post. He was also captain of Kildrummy Castle from late 1450 until 1452 and in 1453&#150;4 keeper of Dunbar Castle. By 1445 he had married Janet, elder daughter and coheir of James Dunbar, fourth earl of Moray. Her sister Elizabeth married Archibald Douglas, third son of James Douglas, seventh earl of Douglas, who assumed the title earl of Moray until his forfeiture about 1452, while Crichton was styled Lord Frendraught by right of his spouse until he was created earl of Moray in the parliament of June 1452. While there has been doubt about the status of this grant, he is clearly styled earl on a number of occasions, though he certainly did not transmit his title to his son. Crichton died at Dunbar in August 1454. His spouse survived him and by 1459 married John Sutherland. Active in the land market until her death about 1500, she is unusual in being a medieval Scotswoman who demonstrated the ability to sign her name.<br>
<br>The eldest of James and Janet Crichton's three sons, <a name="cosubject_54160"></a><span class="headword">William Crichton of that ilk</span>, third Lord Crichton  (<em>d.</em> 1493), succeeded to the lordship in 1454. He witnessed a few charters of James III in 1469&#150;70 and 1476, and was normally present in parliament between 1467 and 1479; he was sheriff of Edinburgh in 1469&#150;71, and perhaps for a longer period. However, he became a follower of Alexander Stewart, duke of Albany, in the latter's intrigues against his brother, James III, and supported the coup of July 1482 against the king. Accordingly he suffered the consequences once King James regained control of government in the following spring. Under an indenture of 19 March 1483 between the king and Albany, Crichton was banished from Scotland for three years; then, as Albany continued to plot with England, Crichton and others were forfeited in the parliament of February 1484 (the sentence was given in his absence, as he may have been in sanctuary in Tain). James III may have had personal grounds for disliking Crichton. The sixteenth-century historian George Buchanan tells of the king seducing Crichton's wife, Janet Dunbar (actually his mother), though there is no contemporary evidence for this. But there seems to be no doubt that Crichton formed a relationship with James's younger sister, Margaret, which resulted in the birth of a daughter.<br>
<br>Crichton may have fled Scotland after his forfeiture. Nevertheless he was among the rebel forces which held Dumbarton and Duchal castles against James IV in the summer of 1489. In September 1489 he obtained a safe conduct from Henry VII to pass to England and elsewhere, but he was certainly in Scotland in September 1492. He had died by October 1493, possibly in Inverness, where he may have been buried. Before 1478 he married Marion, daughter of James, Lord Livingston, a union presumably intended to settle the previous rivalry between the families. They appear to have had one son, James. Crichton's forfeiture meant that the peerage title became extinct; and following a resignation of property in his favour in November 1493 by his grandmother, Janet Dunbar, James Crichton assumed the designation &#145;of Frendraught&#146;, which became the family style.<br>
