<span class="headword">Oliver,  David Thomas</span>  (1863&#150;1947), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born at Pontypridd on 8 February 1863, the fifth of twelve children of the Revd Henry Oliver, a Congregationalist minister, and his wife, Catharine, daughter of the Revd Joshua Thomas, Congregationalist minister, of Aberd&acirc;r. Educated at Caterham School, he first entered the civil service, from which he resigned after being called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1888. In the meantime he had served in Ireland and had graduated BA at the Royal University of Ireland, proceeding MA (1886), LLB (1888), and LLD (1898). In 1898 he also took the LLB degree of the University of London with first class honours. In 1900 he entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge, as an advanced student, taking the degrees of LLB in 1902 and LLM in 1908.<br>
<br>By this time Oliver had found that his heart was in academic work and he became lecturer in law in his own college and supervisor of legal studies for several other colleges, gradually relinquishing his practice in the Temple. In 1920 he became a fellow of Trinity Hall, a position which he retained until his death. His particular interest in Roman law led him to the study of Roman-Dutch law, in which subject he was appointed to the Monro lectureship which was founded for him by the master and fellows of Gonville and Caius College at the end of 1920 to provide for the needs of the students from South Africa who went to read law in Cambridge. This successful enterprise was eventually taken over by the university and thereafter Oliver carried on the course as university lecturer; and although he was compelled to retire officially from this post in 1928 on reaching the statutory age limit he continued to conduct the teaching of the subject for a number of years until a successor could be found.<br>
<br>Oliver's renown as a teacher was founded on an encyclopaedic knowledge of his field and great sympathy with those he taught. Although somewhat slow in speech, he had a penetrating mind. In 1891 he married Lavinia Mary Harrison, who died in 1917; there were no children of the marriage. In 1918 he married Alice Maud, daughter of George Kirby, of Watford. They had two sons, Humphrey and Peter, both of whom studied law at Trinity Hall; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/99182/', "Peter Oliver")</script> became a lord of appeal in ordinary, taking the title Baron Oliver of Aylmerton, in 1986.<br>
<br>Oliver's writings included reviews and articles on Roman law in the <span class="italic">Cambridge Law Journal</span>, and &#145;Roman law in modern cases in English courts&#146; in the volume <span class="italic">Cambridge Legal Essays</span> (1926) edited by P. H. Winfield and A. D. McNair. One of his earliest works, with W. A. Willis, was <span class="italic">The Roman Law Examination Test for Bar and University</span> (1897). He also published a translation, with commentary, of portions of books xii and xiii of Justinian's <span class="italic">Digest</span> (<span class="italic">De condictionibus</span>) (1937). He produced the seventh edition of L. A. Goodeve's <span class="italic">Modern Law of Personal Property</span> (1930), and was also responsible for three editions of B. R. Wise's <span class="italic">Outlines of Jurisprudence</span> (3rd edn, 1918; 4th edn, 1925; 5th edn, 1930). Oliver died at his home, Woodview, 18 Girton Road, Cambridge, on 18 January 1947. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
