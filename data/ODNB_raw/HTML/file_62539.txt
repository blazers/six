<span class="headword">Bennet,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1670&#150;1750), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, may have been a member of the family of that name settled at Hexworthy near Launceston, Cornwall, over many generations. He was admitted sizar at Queens' College, Cambridge, as &#145;of Cornwall&#146; on 7 September 1693, proceeding BA in 1697 and MA in 1726. He is said by Charles Wesley, who met him on 13 July 1744, to have claimed to be a contemporary of Wesley's father, but, since the latter must have been at least ten years older and was at Exeter College, Oxford, their acquaintance could not have been at university. Bennet was ordained deacon at Exeter on 19 September 1697 and priest on 16 March 1700, being licensed thereafter in 1705 to the perpetual curacy of North Tamerton, Cornwall, which he retained until his death and to which he added Tresmere in 1720 and Laneast in 1731.<br>
<br>For much of his life Bennet appears to have been an ordinary country parson of no particularly distinctive views, farming his glebe and associating with the local gentry, but late in 1742 he experienced an evangelical conversion after hearing George Thomson of St Gennys preach on salvation by faith. Subsequently he entertained Whitefield and Wesley on their preaching tours and, like them and Thomson, he peregrinated, and as a result he would incur the wrath of the Methodist-hating bishop of Exeter, George Lavington, who required him in a judgment given on 18 July 1749 to confine his preaching to his own parishes on pain of ecclesiastical censure. Bennet may have continued his itinerant work, but we do know that, whether he did so or not, with Thomson he continued to welcome Whitefield and John Wesley, the latter recording in his journal on 27 August 1750 that Bennet, though still ministering, was &#145;full of days and by swift steps removing into eternity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of &hellip; John Wesley</span>, 3.492). Bennet lived for less than two months after this, and was buried at North Tamerton on 13 October 1750.<br>
