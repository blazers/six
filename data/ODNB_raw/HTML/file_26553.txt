<span class="headword">Stogdon,  Hubert</span>  (1692&#150;1728), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and religious controversialist</span>, was born at Bodicote, Oxfordshire, on 9 January 1692, the eldest son of Robert Stogdon (<i>d</i>. 1697), Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Francis Hubert, or Hubbard (1627&#150;1676), ejected minister, who was disinherited by his father because of his nonconformity. Following his father's death in 1697, the five-year-old Stogdon moved to Devon, where he was looked after by relatives. He was first educated by the Presbyterian minister at Withycombe Raleigh, and afterwards at the free school at Exeter. He then attended Joseph Hallett's academy at Exeter, where he soon became highly regarded for his scholarship. He was successfully examined for public preaching at a meeting of the Exeter assembly on 4 May 1714 and for the next three years regularly attended assembly meetings as a candidate for ordination. For a short time he was chaplain to Sir John Davy, fourth baronet, at Creedy Park, near Crediton, and subsequently preached for two years at Thorverton, a village near Exeter.<br>
<br>In 1714 a fierce argument broke out in Exeter over the validity of non-episcopally ordained baptisms. Nationally, many high-churchmen had already been refusing to bury the infants of dissenters because they were &#145;unbaptized&#146;. Benjamin Read, a young local nonconformist designed for the ministry, became persuaded that his original baptism was invalid, and was rebaptized in the parish church of Heavitree. This was too much for John Withers, co-pastor at the Exeter Bow Meeting, who promptly published <span class="italic">A Caveat Against the New Sect of Anabaptists, Lately Sprung up at Exon</span> (1714). When Read responded in print, Withers entrusted Stogdon with the task of composing <span class="italic">A Defence of &#145;The Caveat&#146;</span> (1714). At this time Stogdon was strictly orthodox and &#145;declared himself most decidedly&#146; against the opinions of William Whiston and Samuel Clark regarding the Trinity, &#145;but his zeal was at all times tempered by charity, and a consciousness of his liability to err&#146;  (Murch, 162).<br>
<br>A small group of students at the Exeter academy, which included Stogdon and Joseph Hallett (1691&#150;1744), the son of his old tutor, none the less met with great caution to discuss this doctrinal controversy. Stogdon agonized greatly, but became &#145;pleased with a change of sentiment&#146; to the Clarkean viewpoint: &#145;he came into it by slow degrees, laborious and humble enquiries, with many prayers and tears, with much fear and trembling&#146;  (Billingsley, 20). However, he failed to keep secret the changed beliefs of his entourage. In November 1716 he expressed his opinions privately to John Lavington, the youngest and most orthodox of the four Exeter ministers, who published their conversation. Lavington was accused of maliciously spreading the story by his senior minister, James Peirce, who, in turn, was blamed for being the cause of Stogdon's lapse from orthodoxy by Lavington's father-in-law, John Ball of Honiton. Stogdon further exacerbated the controversy by speaking his mind at a student discussion meeting in 1717 &#145;with a great deal of freedom&#146;. He &#145;did not seem to be in the least on his guard&#146; and declared: &#145;I am an Arian, and glory in the name&#146;  (Brockett, 82).<br>
<br>Stogdon had been due to seek ordination at the next Exeter assembly, but Peirce now deemed it essential to remove him elsewhere in order to avoid a full-scale confrontation at the meeting with Lavington, Ball, and others, who clearly feared that the younger generation of ministers was falling away into heresy. Accordingly, he extracted a promise from Stogdon to apply himself wholly to practical religion &#145;without meddling with &hellip; points of speculation&#146;  (Brockett, 82). In return, Peirce, Joseph Hallett, and John Withers, the three senior ministers in the city, signed a certificate dated 15 July 1717. This carefully made no mention of Stogdon's opinions, but testified that he had been approved as a suitable candidate for the ministry and noted that &#145;his conversation ever since, as well as before his examination, has been &hellip; sober and Christian; and that his preaching in these parts has been met with good acceptance&#146;  (ibid., 82). Nicholas Billingsley now procured Stogdon a &#145;peaceable retreat, though in an obscure corner of the world&#146;  (Murch, 163), tending a small congregation at Wookey, Somerset. In August 1718 Stogdon was ordained at the Revd Matthew Toogood's meeting-house at Shepton Mallett, Somerset. Peirce's earlier protective action was promptly vindicated when this news reached the Exeter assembly. The orthodox party had already been advised by the London Presbyterian ministers that no one who maintained &#145;so great an error&#146;  (Brockett, 84) could be recommended for ordination, and an outraged John Ball protested violently to Toogood's brother, who was his near neighbour at Axminster, Devon. As the Exeter controversy continued to rage over the following years, Stogdon contributed two pamphlets: <span class="italic">The Character of a Primitive Preacher</span> (1718) and <span class="italic">Seasonal Advice Relating to the Present Disputes about the Holy Trinity Addressed to Both Contending Parties</span> (1719).<br>
<br>From 1717 until 1721 Stogdon resided in Billingsley's home at Ashwick, Somerset, preaching at nearby Coleford as well as at Wookey. Although his antagonists vilified his ordination, local supporters noted his solemn devotion to, and faithful discharge of, his ministry. In 1721 he married a gentlewoman of the neighbourhood, but her name is unknown and the marriage appears to have been childless. The couple remained at Wookey for a further three years. Towards the end of this period Stogdon, &#145;pursuing his course of free enquiry and acting upon his noble principles&#146;, &#145;became convinced &hellip; of the scriptural authority for adult baptism&#146; and was re-baptized by immersion at Barbican in London &#145;notwithstanding the remonstrances of his friends who thought it might prejudice his interest, which was always the last idea in his own mind&#146;  (Murch, 164). In spite of this, however, in 1724 he was called to Trowbridge in Wiltshire by a congregation of paedobaptists, &#145;where he happily and usefully spent the remainder of his days&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Stogdon died at Trowbridge on 20 January 1728 and was buried in the parish church the Friday following. His wife survived him. The following year Billingsley published <span class="italic">Poems and Letters of the Late Reverend Mr. Hubert Stogdon Collected from his Original Papers</span> (1729).<br>
