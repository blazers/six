<span class="headword">Weaver,  Thomas</span>  (1773&#150;1855), <span class="occ">geologist and mining consultant</span>, was born in King Street, Gloucester, the son of Thomas Weaver (<i>d</i>. 1805) and his wife, Mary. His father was an important pin manufacturer and, from 1772, a partner in Roe &amp; Co.'s copper company of Macclesfield and Neath Abbey. From 1779 he was also an alderman of Gloucester.<br>
<br>In 1790 the younger Thomas Weaver entered the Bergakademie at Freiberg, Saxony, where he studied mining and geognosy under Abraham Werner. His contemporaries there included Alexander von Humboldt (1769&#150;1859) and Leopold von Buch (1774&#150;1853). He returned to Gloucester in 1792, and it is likely he attended Thomas Beddoes's geological lectures at Oxford before taking up the management of the Cronbane and Tigrony copper mines in the Wicklow Mountains in 1793.<br>
<br>The mines were an important source of copper for the elder Thomas Weaver's pin-making&#151;he had been a proprietor of them since 1787. In September 1795 the discovery of alluvial gold at the foot of Croghan Mountain (south of the mines), caused a gold rush. From 1796 to 1803 Weaver was one of the superintendents of government operations there. (During interruption to mining caused by the uprising of 1798, he acted as a yeomanry officer.) While still manager of the Cronbane mine, in 1805 Weaver published the first English translation of Werner's <span class="italic">A Treatise on the External Characters of Fossils</span>. For this work, in 1811, he was elected a member of the Edinburgh-based Wernerian Society.<br>
<br>In 1812 Weaver's involvement at Cronbane ceased, and that year and in 1813 he applied unsuccessfully for positions in mining and mineralogy at the Royal Dublin Society. In 1817 the Gloucester pin-making firm (now run by his two younger brothers) went bankrupt but by then Weaver's work on the geology of Ireland had begun. In January 1816 he was reportedly &#145;engaged in a Geognostical map of a great part of Ireland&#146;. In May 1818 he read a paper to the Geological Society in London on the geology of the east of Ireland, which was accompanied by a geological map of the south-east of Ireland, and discussed his involvement in Irish metal mining.<br>
<br>Weaver moved to Tortworth, Gloucestershire, about 1819, the year in which his second paper, on the geology of part of Gloucestershire and Somerset, was read. It was one of the first studies of what were later recognized as Lower Palaeozoic rocks. Weaver was elected a member of the Geological Society in 1820, having earlier been elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy. Throughout the 1820s he acted as a consultant mining geologist, particularly in Ireland, preparing reports for mining companies on the metalliferous prospects of the Waterford coast (1824) and the Kenmare district (1825).<br>
<br>In 1825 Weaver read a paper recording the comparatively modern age of the Irish elk, for which he was elected FRS in 1826. This was followed in 1830 by the first of many papers which recorded his part in the controversy over the age of rocks in Devon (which ultimately led to the naming of the Devonian system). Publication of his main contribution to the debate, a paper on geological relations of the south of Ireland, was, however, twice suppressed because many other geologists did not believe his report of fossil plants found in the greywacke, and it appeared only in 1838. In 1831 Weaver went to Mexico where he was a mining consultant for three years, and in 1834 he went on to New York. On his return to Britain he remained active as an author, writing on American rocks in 1836 and 1837, and also on Irish gold workings. In 1836 he made a tour of Scotland.<br>
<br>By 1841 Weaver was in retirement in London where, a decade later and unmarried, he was living in lodgings in Pimlico. He died at Stafford Place, Pimlico, on 2 July 1855 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. Prior to his death he had given many fossils and minerals to the Geological Society and the Yorkshire Philosophical Society. What remained of his large collection was sold at auction that month; the unsold residue is reported to have formed the hard core for a urinal at Bewdley, Worcestershire.<br>
