<span class="headword">Serocold,  Claude  Pearce</span>  (1875&#150;1959), <span class="occ">stockbroker</span>, was born in Taplow, Buckinghamshire, on 5 July 1875, the fourth son of Charles Pearce-Serocold (1827&#150;1904) of Taplow, and his wife, Marie Emilie Grenfell, daughter of Colonel George St Leger Grenfell. His father was then the senior partner at Reid's brewery, which he had joined as a young man. Serocold was educated at Eton College, where he coxed the Eton crew for three successive years and was president of Pop. He went up to New College, Oxford, and coxed the winning boat race crew in 1895 but he spent only a year there, coming down without a degree. His father gave him &pound;10,000 to start his business career and he joined Rowe and Pitman, and became a member of the stock exchange in 1901. Two years later he moved to Cazenove and Akroyds.<br>
<br>Before the First World War, Serocold made little impact in the City of London. He was considered by his family to be something of a playboy, and a rather raffish one at that, because of his interests in music (he played the piano) and art and his love of France (particularly Cannes), and of the French language, which he spoke well. He nevertheless had a passion for the sea and was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. During the war he joined naval intelligence and, as one of Captain Reginald Hall's two personal assistants from 1915, was intimately involved in the code-breaking activities which contributed so much to the defeat of the Germans. After &#145;moving in a rare and mysterious world&#146;  (Beesly, 315) he returned to the firm a different man and soon became much more of a figure&#151;and a well-respected one&#151;in the City.<br>
<br>During the inter-war years Serocold and Charles Micklem&#151;in a partnership described by Lionel Fraser as the ideal one&#151;dominated Cazenove and Akroyds and made the firm a force in the City: &#145;One [Serocold] shrewd and charming, opened the door, and the other [Micklem] detailed and able, did the work&#146;  (Fraser, 207). Physically rather small, always neat and well-dressed, and generous and entertaining, Serocold was, however, more than just an opener of doors. A reliable confidant and a born diplomat, he re-established and cultivated the firm's link with Baring Brothers, and acted as personal broker to Lord Revelstoke in the 1920s. He developed useful connections with other merchant banks, including Schroders and Morgan Grenfell, and his family connections with the Smiths, a ubiquitous banking family, meant that he had cousins at Morgan Grenfell, Hambros, and other City institutions. His elder brother, Oswald Pearce-Serocold (1865&#150;1951), had joined their father in the brewing business, which by merger in 1898 became Watney, Combe, Reid &amp; Co., and in 1932 he became its chairman.<br>
<br>Serocold's social contacts brought new business to Cazenove and Akroyds, and he attracted significant clients such as Major M. E. W. Pope, a wealthy coalmine owner, and Sir Connop Guthrie, a Suffolk landowner. The firm could depend upon both Pope and Guthrie to invest if asked. His friends included the opera promoter and hotelier Richard D'Oyly Carte, and he often played bridge with the investment manager of the Prudential Insurance Company. From 1921 he served as a director of the Savoy Hotel, and he was also treasurer of King's College Hospital.<br>
<br>By the late 1930s, when he was in his early sixties, Serocold began to wind down his business life and spend less time on the firm's affairs, though he remained its senior partner until 1947. A great Francophile, he spent more and more time at his home in the south of France and thus found himself, in 1940, trapped in the German-occupied part of the country from where he was, with considerable drama, rescued. At the end of the Second World War he sold his London house in Hyde Park Gate to Winston Churchill, and in 1947, when he retired from the firm, he went to live in Monaco. He died there, in hospital, on 17 June 1959.<br>
