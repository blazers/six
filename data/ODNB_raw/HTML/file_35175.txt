<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Myers,  Charles Samuel</span>  (1873&#150;1946), <span class="occ">psychologist</span>, was born in London on 13 March 1873, the eldest son of Wolf Myers, merchant, and his wife, Esther Eugenie Moses. His father's family was principally interested in commerce. From his mother and her family came powerful social, musical, and philosophical influences. As a boy at the City of London School, Myers turned towards science, and later at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, he gained first-class honours in both parts of the natural sciences tripos (1893, 1895) and was Arnold Gerstenberg student in 1896. He proceeded MB at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, in 1898, but disinclined to medical practice, in that year he went with the Cambridge anthropological expedition to the Torres Strait. He joined W. H. R. Rivers and William McDougall in experimental studies of the sensory reactions of the inhabitants of that area, and he became profoundly interested in ethnic music.<br>
<br>In 1902 Myers returned to Cambridge to help Rivers teach the physiology of the special senses. In 1904 Myers married Edith Babette, youngest daughter of Isaac Seligman, merchant, of London; they had three daughters and two sons. Myers remained in Cambridge to become, in succession, demonstrator, lecturer, and, in 1921, reader in experimental psychology. From 1906 to 1909 he was also professor in experimental psychology at King's College, London. At about the time of the First World War he did much to develop scientific psychology in Britain, for example, by using his enthusiasm and ability to raise funds to establish the first English experimental laboratory especially designed for psychology at Cambridge in 1912.<br>
<br>In 1915 Myers was given a commission in the Royal Army Medical Corps and in 1916 he was appointed consultant psychologist to the British armies in France. Frustrated with opposition to his view that shell-shock was a treatable condition, after the war he returned to his Cambridge position. But here too he was deeply dissatisfied, wanting wider opportunities for the development of his more practical interests, and feeling that official and academic circles showed little genuine interest in psychology. In 1922 he left Cambridge for London, thereafter devoting himself to the development of the National Institute of Industrial Psychology which he had founded with Henry John Welch in 1921. He was also involved in what became the industrial health research board and was the first president of the British Psychological Society.<br>
<br>Myers's <span class="italic">Text-Book of Experimental Psychology</span> (1909) was for long the best work of its kind in any language. His <span class="italic">Introduction to Experimental Psychology</span> (1911) went through several editions. <span class="italic">Mind and Work</span> (1920), <span class="italic">Industrial Psychology in Great Britain</span> (1926), and <span class="italic">Ten Years of Industrial Psychology</span> (with H. J. Welch, 1932) all dealt with the later interests of his life. He also published two volumes of essays: <span class="italic">A Psychologist's Point of View</span> (1933) and <span class="italic">In the Realm of Mind</span> (1937). His many contributions in the field of ethnic music won him an international reputation in anthropology.<br>
<br>In 1915 Myers was elected FRS; he was appointed CBE in 1919, and received honorary degrees from the universities of Manchester (DSc, 1927), Calcutta (LLD), and Pennsylvania (DSc). He was a fellow (1919) and later an honorary fellow (1935) of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, a foreign associate of the French Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Psychologie, twice president of the psychology section of the British Association (1922, 1931), president of the International Congress of Psychology in 1923, and editor of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Psychology</span> (1911&#150;24).<br>
<br>Myers was rather above medium height, well built, and remembered for his smile. He made friends readily, but had a tendency to imagine enemies. He enjoyed mountain climbing and lawn tennis, and was a talented violinist. He combined freemasonry with philanthropic activity for the Jewish community. Students and visitors from every part of the world were always welcome at his home. Myers died at his home at Winsford Glebe, near Minehead, Somerset, on 12 October 1946. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Myers undertook more laboratory experimental work than his publications would suggest, but his greatest contributions to the emergent science of psychology in Britain were in establishing many of its pioneering institutions, and promoting it internationally.<br>
