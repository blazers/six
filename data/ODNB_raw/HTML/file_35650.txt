<span class="headword">Raikes,  Humphrey Rivaz</span>  (1891&#150;1955), <span class="occ">chemist and university administrator</span>, was born on 14 July 1891 at Ide Hill, Kent, the third son of Canon Walter Allan Raikes, vicar of Goudhurst, and his wife, Catherine Amelia, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20925/', "William Cotton Oswell (1818&#150;1893)")</script>, an explorer and elephant hunter in southern Africa in the 1840s. Raikes, who remained an Anglican throughout his life, was educated first at St Clare's School, Walmer, then at Tonbridge School, Dulwich College, and Balliol College, Oxford, where he was a Williams exhibitioner in 1910 and Abbott scholar in 1911. A student of Harold Hartley, he attained a first class in the final honour school of chemistry in 1914.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War Raikes served in France as a second lieutenant in the Buffs, and in April 1915 he was wounded in the shoulder. In November 1915 he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, and in January 1918 became chief experimental officer at the experimental station at Orford Ness with the rank of major. In June 1918 he was awarded the Air Force Cross, and joined the Royal Air Force mission to the United States to help train American personnel.<br>
<br>After the war Raikes returned to Oxford, and in June 1919 was elected to a tutorial fellowship at Exeter College. From 1920 to 1927 he again worked under Hartley, serving as demonstrator in physical chemistry at the Balliol and Trinity College laboratory, and from 1924 to 1927 he was sub-rector of Exeter College. He was a most stimulating teacher, his main interest being electrochemistry, and his colleagues in the growing school of physical chemistry owed much to his skilful administration of the Balliol and Trinity laboratory. On the formation of the Oxford University air squadron in 1925 Raikes was made chief instructor with the rank of wing commander.<br>
<br>In January 1928 Raikes succeeded Sir William Thomson to become the third principal of the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, then entering its seventh year as a full university. His appointment as principal was fortuitous. The university's London committee, visiting Exeter College to interview a favoured candidate and not finding him, happened upon Raikes, who so impressed them that they promptly nominated him for the post. Nevertheless, at first Raikes struggled to establish his position within the university. He had been appointed against the wishes of senate, which favoured an internal candidate (the philosopher R. F. A. Hoernl&eacute;), and often had difficulty in controlling senate meetings. Initially, the university council was not convinced that it had made the right appointment. A tall, gangling man, Raikes seemed shy, nervous, and lacking in drive. A narcoleptic, he also had the disconcerting habit of falling asleep during meetings. His position as principal was not confirmed until 1932, and it was not until 1948 that council appointed him to the largely ceremonial position of vice-chancellor. Although Raikes wished to identify himself with South Africa, he was long regarded by many as an alien transplant. This was compounded by his reticence and a natural reserve, which gave the impression of aloofness. In 1931 Raikes married Joan, daughter of Charles Mylne Mullaly of the Indian Civil Service; the marriage was soon annulled. In 1936 he returned to England to marry, on 8 December, Alice Joan (<i>d</i>. 1977), daughter of William Arthur Hardy, an accountant of Norwich; she became headmistress of Roedean School in Johannesburg. They had no children.<br>
<br>The Second World War enabled Raikes to come into his own, both within the university and in the wider community. He took the lead in involving the university in South Africa's war effort, including the formation of a university training corps, and in ensuring the provision by Wits, at the end of the war, of an accelerated programme for ex-volunteers. In August 1945 Raikes toured the South African forces in Italy and Egypt on a recruiting drive on behalf of all the country's universities; after the war twice as many ex-volunteers enrolled at Wits as in the other South African universities combined.<br>
<br>It was during Raikes's tenure that Wits developed, together with the University of Cape Town, as an &#145;open&#146; university in the South African context, by admitting black and white students to the same classes in defiance of the country's segregationist practices. In response to an external challenge, the university's council decided in 1934 to begin admitting black students, though this arrangement excluded them from clinical training in medicine and dentistry, leaving them with the option of going overseas for this; when the outbreak of war in 1939 rendered this impossible, Raikes played a central role in opening up the Wits medical school to the black students, on condition that their clinical training was confined to the non-European hospital. While Raikes strongly advocated the admission of all groups to Wits, he was reluctant to integrate the black students into formal social and sporting events&#151;the university's policy of &#145;academic non-segregation and social segregation&#146; encapsulated his own approach.<br>
<br>Following the accession of the National Party to power in 1948, Raikes found himself caught between a government committed to apartheid and a radicalized students' representative council pressing for an end to all forms of racial discrimination on campus. In March 1954 Raikes retired on the grounds of ill health, disheartened by the sheer complexity of the political pressures brought to bear on him after 1948 and frustrated by the financial constraints that had consistently obstructed his desire to develop Wits as a university of some international repute.<br>
<br>Raikes's style of leadership was unassertive and collegial. He lived on campus in the principal's lodgings, and took a personal interest in almost everything that happened at the university. It was a matter of regret to him that by the end of his tenure it was no longer possible for him to know all senior students by name, the student body having grown from 1476 in 1928 to 4277 by 1954.<br>
<br>Raikes was also active outside the university. He was president of the South African Chemical Institute in 1932&#150;3; chairman of the board responsible for the aptitude testing of recruits to the South African Air Force during the Second World War; president of the Associated Scientific and Technical Societies of South Africa in 1947; and a long-serving member of the Johannesburg Hospital Board. Between 1948 and 1955 he was awarded five honorary doctorates, by the universities of Bristol, Cambridge, Toronto, Cape Town, and Wits. In 1960 the university's new chemistry building was named after him. Troubled by ill health since contracting dysentery on his way back from Egypt, Raikes died on 13 April 1955 in the Johannesburg General Hospital, following an operation; he was cremated on 14 April at Braamfontein crematorium. He was survived by his wife, and on her death the couple's estate went equally to the University of Witwatersrand and Balliol College, Oxford.<br>
