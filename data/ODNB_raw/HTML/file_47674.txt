<span class="headword">Vidyasagar,  Iswarchandra</span>  (1820&#150;1891), <span class="occ">social reformer and Sanskrit scholar</span>, the eldest son of Thakurdas Bandyopadhyay and Bhagavati Devi, was born on 26 September 1820 in the village of Birsimha, Midnapore district, Bengal. The name Vidyasagar is actually an academic title, conferred on him in 1839 when he passed the examination in Hindu law from Sanskrit College, Calcutta.<br>
<br>His ancestors on both sides were Sanskrit scholars, but his father was penurious at the time of Iswarchandra's birth. Father and son walked to Calcutta in 1828. The latter was admitted to Sanskrit College in 1829, where he proved to be a student of extraordinary merit and mastered several branches of Sanskritic learning over a period of twelve years, during which time he married Dinamayi Bhattacharya. He left the college in 1841 and was appointed head pandit at Fort William College, Calcutta, in the same year. There he also studied English and Sanskrit. He was appointed assistant secretary of Sanskrit College in 1846, but resigned the following year when his proposals for reform were turned down. He accepted the chair of Sanskrit at the same college in 1851, and became its principal in the next year. As principal he carried out extensive reforms, especially in the curriculum, which now emphasized a knowledge of English as well as Western logic and mathematics. Convinced that the traditional Sanskritic systems of <i>darsana</i> (systems of thought and speculation described inaccurately as Indian philosophy) were erroneous, he wanted to create a body of scholars trained in Sanskritic as well as Western learning, who would interpret Western thought to the Indian literati.<br>
<br>Iswarchandra is counted among the creators of modern Bengali prose. As an educationist, he wrote a number of books in Bengali, including the Bengali primer, <span class="italic">Barnaparichay</span>, which is still used to introduce Bengali children to their mother tongue. His other works intended for children include <span class="italic">Bodhoday</span>, <span class="italic">Kathamala</span>, and <span class="italic">Charitabhali</span>. The last of these, based on Webster's <span class="italic">Biographies</span>, contains improving tales of high achievement drawn from the life stories of eminent Europeans. His prose works include several adaptations from the Sanskrit classics: <span class="italic">Betalpanchavimsati</span> (a collection of twenty-five tales), <span class="italic">Sakuntala</span>, and <span class="italic">Sitar banabas</span> (1874). While he drew extensively upon Sanskrit for his vocabulary, his style marked a distinct break with the older tradition of highly florid Sanskritic diction. In addition he edited a number of Sanskrit texts, including Kalidasa's <span class="italic">Raghuvamsam</span>, <span class="italic">Meghadutam</span>, and <span class="italic">Kumarasambhavam</span>, Bhavabhuti's <span class="italic">Uttararamacharita</span>, and the philosophical compendium <span class="italic">Sarvadarsanasamgraha</span>.<br>
<br>Iswarchandra played a courageous role, and one for which he is remembered, in the movement for social reform, especially the agitation in favour of permitting the remarriage of widows among caste Hindus. He published his first tract arguing that such remarriage was sanctioned by the Hindu scriptures in 1854, he impoverished himself by sponsoring such marriages, and he got his own son, Narayanchandra, to marry a widow, defying orthodox convention. He established the Hindu Family Annuity Fund to help Hindus in distress. His other attempt at social reform, demanding the prohibition of polygamy, was not successful. His tracts on the subject, written in a popular style, were among the finest satirical writings of the period.<br>
<br>He was also among the pioneers of women's education in Bengal, and, as a government-appointed special inspector of schools, he established twenty model schools in a period of six months, as well as a normal school for the training of teachers. By 1858 there were 1300 students in the girls' schools he had established. He also took over the Calcutta Training School in 1864: renamed Hindu Metropolitan Institution, the college was entirely run by Indian teachers and administrators.<br>
<br>Iswarchandra is best remembered in his own country as a man of unbending moral courage and for his fabled generosity. People who benefited from his secret charity were probably thousands in number. Among these beneficiaries was the wayward poet Michael Madhusudan Dutt. Embittered by the ingratitude of those he had helped and the hostility of the orthodox, Iswarchandra spent his latter years among the aboriginal Santals. He died in Calcutta on 29 July 1891.<br>
