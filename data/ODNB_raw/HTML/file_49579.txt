<span class="headword">Berki,  Robert Nandor</span>  (1936&#150;1991), <span class="occ">political scientist</span>, was born on 12 July 1936 in Budapest, the only child of Ferdinand Berki (1898&#150;1987), a bank clerk, and his wife, Anna (1904&#150;1977), a bank secretary. He went to the Catholic Piarista Convent School in Budapest in 1941 and stayed there until 1952. He then worked in the land redistribution department of the Hungarian government, and left it more than a year later to study music at a music academy in Budapest. During his two years there he concentrated initially on classical music and then on jazz, and learned to play timpani and drum. On leaving the academy he earned his living working as a petrol pump attendant during the day and as a drummer in jazz bands in the evening. When the revolution broke out in Hungary in 1956 he left the country after narrowly avoiding arrest. After a few weeks in a refugee camp in Vienna he arrived in Britain on 20 February 1957. He spent some time in a refugee centre outside London, and moved first to 7 Hereford Square, South Kensington, and then to 17 Rosenau Crescent in Battersea. During this period he worked as a dispatch clerk at Harrods and attended evening classes to improve his English and prepare for his O and A-level examinations. He cleared the latter with top grades and joined the London School of Economics in 1961 as a full-time student, securing an outstanding first in international relations three years later. He proceeded to Cambridge University the same year and completed his doctorate in 1967 on the thought of Hegel and Marx, under the supervision of E. H. Carr.<br>
<br>Berki was appointed lecturer in the department of politics at the University of Hull in 1967, becoming senior lecturer in 1975, reader in 1982, and professor of European political and social theory and director of the Institute of European Studies in 1984. As director, one of his great achievements was to set up a new four-year degree in transnational integrated European studies, under which Hull students spent some time at selected universities in four European countries and acquired a truly European education and orientation. He also organized regular symposia and colloquia, which brought together eminent European scholars and placed Hull on the academic map of Europe. He wrote six books, co-edited three, and wrote more than a dozen major articles. His books included <span class="italic">Socialism</span> (1975), <span class="italic">The History of Political Thought</span> (1977), <span class="italic">On Political Realism</span> (1981), <span class="italic">Insight and Vision: the Problem of Communism in Marx's Thought</span> (1983), <span class="italic">Security and Society</span> (1986), and <span class="italic">The Genesis of Marxism</span> (1988). He was a reflective and meditative rather than an analytical and argumentative thinker, taking little interest in conceptual analysis and academic debates beyond the minimum necessary for his work. From the start of his academic career until the end of his life he remained deeply interested in Hegel, Marx, socialism, the best ways to combine the pursuits of order and justice, and the interplay between moral idealism and political realism.<br>
<br>Berki rebelled against the sombre image and lifestyle of <i>homo academicus</i> and freely indulged his dominant passions for jazz and football. He set up with like-minded colleagues a Don Beat Jazz group which provided excellent entertainment at departmental events and gave him the opportunity to display and sharpen his drumming skills. When once asked how his drumming fitted in with his philosophical preoccupation with the dialectic, he took a drumstick and said, &#145;Listen, you will hear the dialectic at work&#146;  (personal knowledge). Football was his other great interest. As a boy he was a keen supporter of Ferencv&aacute;ros in Budapest and he regarded his visit to its home ground nearly thirty years later as one of the great pleasures of his life. On arriving in Britain he developed an affection for Everton Football Club and later for Hull City, of which he remained an enthusiastic supporter until his death. The hour and a half during which a soccer match was shown on television every Saturday evening was the most sacred for him, which no telephone call or colleague was allowed to disturb and which was invariably accompanied by cheese sandwiches and total domestic silence.<br>
<br>Berki married Etelka Taph (<i>b</i>. 1934), a fellow Hungarian whom he had first met at a jazz club in Stalintown, about 30 miles from Budapest, on 3 August 1962, when he was just under half way through his undergraduate education. He gave her the name Mic&agrave; (meaning a little pussy cat), and that is how she was known to their friends. They had two sons and a daughter, and a stepdaughter from Mic&agrave;'s first marriage to John H&ouml;ller, whom she had divorced in 1959.<br>
<br>Berki was a tall and well-built man with a long and receding forehead and deep reflective eyes that occasionally betrayed touches of sadness and insecurity. He led a highly ordered life in which everything had its assigned place and whose routine was rarely allowed to be disturbed. He once remarked that there was something of a German civil servant in him. He was a deeply religious man who rarely missed his Sunday mass, and counted the local priest among his close friends. He had a strong sense of what was due to him and to others, and both demanded the former and readily conceded the latter. He was just as easily upset when others were late for a meeting with him as when he was, and apologized when late for being &#145;immoral by a few minutes&#146;  (personal knowledge). He was a warm and kind man, with a strong sense of duty to his students, colleagues, and the university. He was complex, not easy to get to know, but capable of deep and generous friendship with those who broke through his reserve and respected the order and rhythm of his life.<br>
<br>Berki was a strong family man. Deeply devoted to his parents, he got his mother to join him in Britain in 1964 and his father in 1970, and looked after both until their deaths. He was very fond of his stepdaughter, who lived with him until her marriage and was a regular visitor thereafter. He adored and was highly protective of his wife, who did not settle down in Britain as easily as he had. Like many first-generation migrants he was keen that his three children should become an integral part of British society without losing their cultural roots and language. Berki died of a brain haemorrhage in Hull on 17 September 1991, and was survived by his wife, stepdaughter, and three children. He was buried at Chanterland's Avenue cemetery, Hull, on 19 September.<br>
