<span class="headword">Willing,  Victor James Arthur</span>  (1928&#150;1988), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was born on 15 January 1928 in Alexandria, Egypt, the only child of George Willing, professional soldier (a captain), and his wife, Irene Cynthia Tomkins. He spent the first four years of his life in Egypt and, briefly, in Malta. Although he never consciously introduced the landscape of his childhood into his art, the paintings which made his reputation are notable for their sense of windless heat, bright light, vacant horizons, and undecorated enclosures. Through most of the 1930s Willing went to schools in various parts of southern England, including the Isle of Wight, but he enjoyed a more settled education during the Second World War at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford (1940&#150;45), where he won the art prize. As a national serviceman (1946&#150;8) he gained a commission in the Royal Artillery and, during this time, was confirmed in his ambition to be an artist by the Victoria and Albert Museum's pioneer showing in England of an exhibition of work by Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse (1946). The force of Picasso's work, which he subsequently compared to being &#145;trapped in a stall with a stallion&#146;, particularly impressed him. On demobilization he was for a year at Guildford Art School before being accepted by the Slade School of Art, London University, where he spent four years (1949&#150;53).<br>
<br>Willing had a rebellious streak and was admired by his contemporaries at the Slade&#151;an outstanding intake, which included Michael Andrews and Euan Uglow&#151;for his talent and intellectual zest, even being singled out by the influential critic David Sylvester as &#145;the spokesman for his generation&#146;. He soon made friends in avant-garde circles, most influentially for his painting with (H. G.) Rodrigo Moynihan and Francis Bacon. In 1955 he had a well received first one-man show at Erica Brausen's Hanover Gallery, where Bacon exhibited.<br>
<br>This bright start as a painter was consolidated by Willing's reputation as an intellectual. It is typical that his first, unpublished, article was preoccupied with the romantic and existential notion of the artist as hero, dandy, and gambler. It proved a false dawn. In 1951 he had married a girlfriend since schooldays, Hazel, daughter of Harold Norman Whittington, a fellow of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. By the mid-1950s the marriage was failing and in December 1956 he left for Portugal to live with the painter Paula Rego, whom he had met at the Slade. She was the daughter of Jos&eacute; Figueira Rego, electrical engineer. They married in 1959, the year of Willing's divorce from Hazel Whittington. He continued to work but, by his own exacting standards, the results were not exhibitable and his loss to art seemed permanent when he took on the management of his father-in-law's business after the latter's death.<br>
<br>This coincided with the diagnosis that Willing was suffering from multiple sclerosis, and when the Portuguese revolution of 1974 left the family affairs in chaos he settled in London with his wife and their children&#151;Caroline (<i>b</i>. 1956), Victoria (<i>b</i>. 1959), and Nicholas (<i>b</i>. 1961). He took a room in a condemned school in Stepney for a peppercorn rent and began to paint with renewed intensity, stimulated by the knowledge that time was short. Because he could only stand with the aid of a stick, for long periods he merely sat and stared. In states of reverie pictures would appear on the wall facing him. They were so vivid he called them &#145;visions&#146;; and as soon as they were over he would draw them, later enlarging some into oil paintings. He exhibited the results in 1978 at the AIR (Artist Information Registry) Gallery.<br>
<br>The visions were the first pictures Willing felt &#145;exclusive to himself&#146; and met with immediate critical success. Even after they disappeared, their effect remained. His last decade was a professional triumph. In 1980 he received a Thorne scholarship and in 1982 was made university artist in residence at Cambridge. There followed public exhibitions at the Serpentine and Whitechapel galleries&#151;the latter a major retrospective in 1986; and his pictures entered several important collections, including those of the Arts Council and the Tate Gallery. Even when greatly paralysed he managed to complete a series of powerful imaginative portraits, entitled <span class="italic">Heads</span>, exhibited at the Karsten Schubert Gallery (1987).<br>
<br>All Willing's paintings came from his large legacy of drawings, which he showed independently at the Hobson Gallery (1983), Bernard Jacobson Gallery (1983, 1984, and 1985), and the Hayward Gallery Annual, sponsored by the Arts Council (1985). His most celebrated paintings are imaginative representations of empty rooms or deserted locations, pregnant with the presence of humans but never showing people. As in the work of Bacon, there is often a sense of existential anguish played out on a stage; but in Willing the drama is usually one of suspense and expectation. <span class="italic">Place with a Red Thing</span> (1980, Tate collection) is an explicit exception, a masterpiece of ambiguity because of its clarity. A strange red form dripping and burgeoning dominates a space. <span class="italic">Cythere</span> (1983, priv. coll.) is also exceptional in showing a violently coloured plant simultaneously blooming and dying in front of a formal arrangement of cubic forms, apparently artificially lit against an indigo sky or backdrop. In pencil and brush Willing's handling is always expressive. His colours combine to enforce a sense of unease just as his geometry always avoids the right angle. His interest in stacked formal structures was realized in some sculptures towards the end of his life and he had unfulfilled plans to turn his fascination with the idea of the &#145;aedicula&#146; or &#145;shelter&#146;, a place of refuge or retreat, into three dimensions.<br>
<br>Willing was slightly built, but with wide shoulders, sleek, handsome, and, unlike most artists, neatly dressed. He had an air of danger which made him a magnetic presence. He was given to quick, sudden movements and was a skilful and energetic dancer, with a sense of rhythm he brought to his painting. He died at home in Hampstead, London, of multiple sclerosis, on 1 June 1988. His wife survived him.<br>
