<span class="headword">Nunneley,  Thomas</span>  (1809&#150;1870), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, born at Market Harborough, Leicestershire, in March 1809, was the son of John Nunneley, a gentleman of property in Leicestershire, descended from a Shropshire family. He was educated privately, a spinal complaint necessitating a long course of treatment, and was apprenticed to a surgeon in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. He afterwards became a student at Guy's Hospital, London, where he met and later became a close friend of Sir Astley Paston Cooper, and served as surgical dresser to Charles Aston Key. He was admitted a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries on 12 July 1832, and became a member (1832) and one of the first honorary fellows (1843) of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. As soon as he had obtained his licence to practise, he travelled to Paris to increase his professional knowledge. On his return to England he applied unsuccessfully to be house surgeon to the Leeds General Infirmary, but as an opportunity for practice became available in that town, he settled there, and was soon afterwards appointed surgeon to the Eye and Ear Hospital, a post he successfully occupied for twenty years. In the Leeds school of medicine he lectured on anatomy and physiology, and later on surgery, until 1866. He was appointed surgeon to the Leeds General Infirmary in 1864. For three years he was a member of the Leeds town council, and for many years was an active member of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society.<br>
<br>Nunneley was one of the earliest surgeons outside London to specialize in ophthalmic surgery, and was among the first to attempt excision of the tongue. He was clear, vigorous, and logical as a writer, at times holding opinions obstinately. His energy and excessive determination were exhibited during his final illness, in performing one operation, then going aside to vomit, but returning to perform another operation. He was a decisive professional witness in favour of William Palmer (1825&#150;1856), who was convicted of poisoning J. P. Cook by strychnine in 1856, and against William Dove, who poisoned his wife with the same drug in the course of that same year.<br>
<br>Nunneley's chief work was <span class="italic">The Organs of Vision, their Anatomy and Physiology</span> (1858), which sold poorly after adverse criticism in professional journals, which appears to have been due to personal animosity. He also published works on erysipelas, anaesthetic agents, and the effects of hydrocyanic acid.<br>
<br>Nunneley continued to work until three weeks before his death from uraemia on 1 June 1870 in Leeds. He was buried at Woodhouse cemetery, Leeds. Nothing is known of his family life, except that he had a son, John Albert, also a surgeon.<br>
