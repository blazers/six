<span class="headword">Sutton,  William Richard</span>  (1835<span class="mult">x</span>7&#150;1900), <span class="occ">entrepreneur and housing philanthropist</span>, was born in Kennington, Lambeth, the youngest son of five children born to Frederick Wilson Sutton (1798&#150;1852) and his wife, Mary Head Matts (1811&#150;1866/7). His father was a partner in the stationery firm of Shepherd and Sutton, based in Foster Lane in the City of London. In 1851 Sutton was living with his family in Foster Lane, next door to the stationery firm. His grandmother headed the household and ran the adjacent Fountain inn, in which his father assisted as a barman. Sutton was educated at the City of London School between 1845 and 1850, when he left aged fourteen. After the death of his father in 1852, his eldest brother emigrated to New Zealand and Sutton moved with his sister Mary and their mother back to Mrs Sutton's birthplace in Merton, Surrey.<br>
<br>Sutton would seem to be an example of a self-made millionaire and according to an obituary showed signs of business ability early in his career  (<span class="italic">City Press</span>). In the mid-1850s he established the business of Sutton &amp; Co. Carriers from The Fountain inn, exploiting the inn's existing function as a receiving and distribution house for goods and parcels. The company expanded rapidly and the firm's head offices moved, first to Aldersgate Street and then in 1878 to purpose-built premises in Golden Lane. Sutton profited from using the railways to distribute large parcels at lower &#145;tonnage&#146; rates than would have been due if the parcels' smaller constituent packages had been sent individually. The expansion of this business during the 1860s brought Sutton into conflict with the South Eastern and Great Western railway companies which tried to recover some of their &#145;lost&#146; income through repeatedly imposing surcharges on Sutton's goods. After several years of litigation an appeal to the House of Lords ultimately settled the case in Sutton's favour in 1868. On the occasion of Sutton's legal success his employees presented him with a testimonial paying tribute to his &#145;energy, tact, forethought and straightforward dealing&#146;  (Butcher and Butcher, 9). A former employee recalled him as strict and honest, but rather humourless and sometimes hasty  (ibid.). Nevertheless, his employees pledged their &#145;earnest co-operation&#146; and by 1900 the carrying company possessed some 600 branches throughout the UK, the colonies, and elsewhere.<br>
<br>Important though Sutton &amp; Co. Carriers was as the foundation of Sutton's business success, it was not the only source of the multi-million pound fortune which he amassed. Sutton's many property investments included a &pound;200,000 scheme of office and factory development in the St Luke's area of the City of London and a variety of commercial and residential premises in London and Brighton. Other areas of investment included some eleven brewing, bottling, and distilling firms. Sutton was a founder, director, and major shareholder of two of these companies&#151;the gin, whisky, and brandy distillery, Sutton, Carden &amp; Co. based in Finsbury, and the New London Brewery which manufactured ale, port, and stout in its Kennington premises. Both firms were founded in the early 1880s and later diversified their operations to meet changes in demand by supplying wines, cordials, mineral waters, tea, coffee, and tobacco as well as acquiring hotels and inns.<br>
<br>Sutton married his first wife, Ann Eleanor (1836&times;8&#150;1891), daughter of Thomas Archdeacon Lewis, on 15 October 1864. By 1871 the couple had moved to their new house, Sunnydene, West Hill, near Crystal Palace in Sydenham. Sutton appreciated fine design in his surroundings and commissioned J. F. Bentley, the architect of Westminster Cathedral, to design both his head office in Golden Lane and his house. Sutton also sponsored his brother-in-law, the organ builder Thomas Christopher Lewis, who was a friend of Bentley's. Lewis lived with the Suttons at Sunnydene and worked from business premises provided by Sutton, but there is no other evidence of links between Sutton and the wider artistic circles of his day.<br>
<br>In 1891 Ann Sutton died and four years later Sutton married again, on 14 December 1895. His second wife was Eliza Anna Venus White (<i>d</i>. 1937), widowed daughter of William Dobson, surgeon. Sutton had no children of his own, although both of his wives brought children with them to their marriages. Ann had an adopted daughter, Kate, and Eliza a son and two daughters. After the death of his first wife, Sutton withdrew from his business affairs for a few years due to ill health. Although he retained his house in London, he took up residence with his second wife in Hove, Sussex. In 1899 Sutton resumed his business activities which he continued to pursue until a few days before his death. On 20 May 1900 Sutton died, from bronchitis and cardiac failure, at his Sussex home, 6 Adelaide Crescent, Hove. He was buried at Norwood cemetery, London, on 24 May.<br>
<br>Sutton's obituary in the <span class="italic">City Press</span> stressed his business prowess and noted that &#145;He took but little interest in public affairs&#146; as he &#145;confined his attention mainly to his business&#146;  (23 May 1900). At his death, however, Sutton left the bulk of his estate to establish a trust for the provision of dwellings for the poor in London and other populous places in England. After a limited number of additional bequests were paid to his brother Charles, certain business associates, and his second wife, who lived until 1937, the assets left to found the trust were valued at over &pound;2 million.<br>
<br>In 1913, when speaking of his brother's intentions, Charles Sutton said that he had had &#145;one great idea, and that was to crystallise the old proverb that prevention was better than cure. He believed that healthy homes and pure air and sanitation were better than all the hospitals that could be built&#146;  (<span class="italic">Liverpool Courier</span>, 24 Sept 1913). Despite having lived his life in a society which emphasized voluntary activity, there is no evidence of Sutton or his immediate family having been actively involved in philanthropy. He did, however, work in close proximity to well-known public figures and Sir Sydney Waterlow, lord mayor of London and founder of the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company, owned business premises adjacent to those of Sutton, Carden &amp; Co. in Finsbury.<br>
<br>The trustees nominated by Sutton to establish his housing trust were his elder brother Charles, his solicitor, Charles Edward Tranter Lamb, and Thomas Watson, manager and inheritor of Sutton &amp; Co. The task of realizing the estate and administering the trust was extremely onerous and difficult. The will was contested by some disinherited family members, while the prospect of so large a housing charity alarmed public authorities, the attorney-general, and other would-be administrators of the trust. They were concerned that so large a sum of money could have detrimental effects on existing labour and property markets if the provision of low-rented housing for the poor by the Sutton Dwellings Trust were not carefully controlled. Despite these administrative difficulties, however, the trust undertook its first building activities in 1907 and by 1919 had built 1783 dwellings on six estates in London, Bimingham, and Newcastle. It was not until 1927 that a scheme for the administration of the trust was finally agreed, by which time almost all of those directly associated with William Sutton and his trust had died. The trust had the largest endowment of all the philanthropic housing organizations and by 1939 had built nearly 8000 dwellings in fifteen towns and cities. The William Sutton Trust, as it is now known, still ranks among the largest housing associations in England.<br>
