<span class="headword">Weldon,  Anthony</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1610), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer</span>, was baptized at East Peckham, Kent, on 29 June 1610, the fourth son, of eight sons and four daughters, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28988/', "Sir Anthony Weldon (bap. 1583, d. 1648)")</script> of Swanscombe, Kent, and his wife, Helen (or Elinor) Wilmer (<i>bap</i>. 1588, <i>d</i>. 1622). His father, knighted in 1617, lost his place at court in 1623, emerging in the 1640s as the county boss who controlled Kent for parliament. Anthony's eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28992/', "Ralph Weldon")</script>, was also a parliamentarian army officer. <br>
<br>By his own account Weldon was a professional soldier from 1622 or 1623 onwards. In 1639 he met at Lyons the returning ambassador to Venice, Basil Feilding, earl of Denbigh, who persuaded him to come back to England and march in the king's army against the Scots. Weldon was colonel of a Northumberland regiment during the first bishops' war, but chose not to serve when the army reformed the following year &#145;as not being at all satisfied with the lawfulness of that Engagement, and for some other reasons which I expressed in a Letter to the earl of Northumberland the General of that Army&#146;  (Weldon, <span class="italic">To the Parliament</span>, 3). He went abroad and returned in time, he later claimed, to refuse to accompany the king in demanding the five members from parliament in January 1642. He went to fight in Ireland where, he later recalled with characteristic self-righteousness, while other less worthy men were given senior posts, he &#145;was forced (if I would go at all), to go with a single Company (which my zeal prompted me cheerfully to accept)&#146;  (ibid., 4). <br>
<br>Weldon was sent to the relief of Duncannon, co. Wexford, where he served as captain of the garrison until 1643. However, he quarrelled with the garrison commander, Laurence Esmonde, Lord Esmonde, whom he regarded as too much the friend of the king rather than of parliament and too easy-going in his relations with his Catholic neighbours whom he was holding the fort against. He returned to England and took a commission as major in the horse regiment of Theophilus Clinton, earl of Lincoln, part of the army of the eastern association. This posting proved no more congenial than the former, and Weldon was soon presenting parliament with charges against the Lincolnshire county committee. In 1644 he transferred as major to a Kentish horse regiment in Sir William Waller's army, commanded by Sir Michael Livesey. Livesey was not a success as a soldier. In May 1644 Weldon preferred articles against his commander, accusing him of dishonouring his regiment, exposing his major to grave personal danger for no better reason than his own timidity, then trying to rid himself of the embarrassment by putting Weldon and his troop under another command. He also referred to Livesey's desertion of his post at Cheriton Down in March. A committee was set up by the Commons to investigate. Sir William Waller accused Livesey of running away from the battle at Cropredy Bridge in June, and at the same time Weldon &#145;posted him [Livesey] for a mutineer and a coward&#146; in Westminster Hall  (Weldon, <span class="italic">True Declaration</span>, 14). <br>
<br>The Commons regarded Weldon's accusation as an act of disrespect to their authority, and referred the matter to the committee of examinations, who ruled Weldon's claims &#145;a false and scandalous Libell&#146; and sent him to Newgate until he should give Livesey satisfaction  (Weldon, <span class="italic">True Declaration</span>, 18). They no doubt meant an apology and possibly financial recompense; an unrepentant Weldon interpreted the word rather differently and compounded the offence: &#145;I challenged him [Livesey], told him I would Cudgell him, and publisht it, which satisfied me, for my private affronts I received by him&#146;  (ibid., 19). After ten months' imprisonment in Newgate, and several petitions for his release, he published his defiant <span class="italic">The True Declaration of Colonell Anthony Welden</span>. Gaoled without a hearing, and denied a trial, he charged parliament with arbitrary actions every bit as bad as those of Star Chamber or high commission:<blockquote>And since I suffer for accusing, and my accusation not heard, nor my witnesses accepted, I leave to the world to judge the measure I have received. And I hope this will satisfie all men I am not the least sufferer for the Publike but the greatest for this particular. (ibid.)</blockquote>Weldon was released in 1646, after the Lords pressed his case on the Commons in March. He left England and took service in the Spanish army in the Netherlands. However, he lost his command, and was imprisoned on account of yet another quarrel with a commanding officer, this time George Goring, Lord Goring. In 1648 Weldon returned to England and attempted to raise a regiment from royalist prisoners for service in the pay of the Venetian state. On 19 March 1649, having alerted the Rump Parliament to the recent publication of the <span class="roman">Koran</span>, Weldon was sent with a party of soldiers and a sergeant-at-arms to search out and seize the press responsible, and to bring the printer before the council of state, who seem to have regarded Weldon as an officious nuisance for his efforts. Obstructed in his Venetian scheme by his enemies in parliament, owed eight years' arrears, and denied the opportunity of service in England or Ireland, Weldon vented his frustrations in another pamphlet, <span class="italic">To the Parliament of England and Army</span>. He repeated his charge of parliamentary tyranny:<blockquote>It goes much against my heart and conscience, to see that arbitrary power continue in them, for which they plucked others down, and see so many poor oppressed cry at their doors daily for justice, without dispatch, hearing, redress or hope thereof. (Weldon, <span class="italic">To the Parliament</span>, 45)</blockquote>He now added the bitterness of the old soldier overtaken by younger men, of the gentleman displaced by the social upstarts of the New Model Army:<blockquote>'Tis high time for me to learn some mechanick Trade after twenty six yeers Service; and so come to be admitted a Colonel in the Army, as others are, who are not known by their birth, garb or merit. I am sorry to see Gentry so trodden down, as if they were lesse meritorious, or less faithfull than these new upstarts. (ibid., 41)</blockquote>On 20 April 1649 Weldon had a pass for himself, his wife (of whom nothing is yet known), and three servants to take ship overseas, to an unspecified destination. On 11 December 1650 a warrant went out from the council of state for his arrest, for reasons unstated. On 30 November 1654 the lord protector granted Weldon's personal request to go abroad once more. Nothing more is heard of him.<br>
