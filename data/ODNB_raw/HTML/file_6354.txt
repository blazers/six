<span class="headword">Corro,  Antonio  del</span>  (1527&#150;1591), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was born at Seville, the son of Antonio del Corro, doctor of law, and a prostitute. He entered the Observantine Hieronymite monastery of San Isidoro del Campo, near Seville, about 1547, and soon afterwards renounced the Roman Catholic faith. He ascribed this step to the influence of certain disclosures made to him by a member of the Spanish Inquisition, who also introduced him to the writings of Luther and Bullinger. He fled Spain about 1558 and spent the next nine years in Lausanne, where he studied at the university, and Flanders. Though not formally identifying himself with any protestant communion, he exercised ministerial functions for five years in Reformed communities in B&eacute;arn, Bergerac, and Montargis. Invited to Antwerp, he was chosen in 1566 pastor of the Walloon church, but the civil authorities, under Spanish influence, refused to confirm his settlement. In his defence he published <span class="italic">Lettre envoy&eacute;e &agrave; la majest&eacute; du roy des Espaignes</span> (1567; English edn, 1577), addressed to Philip II of Spain, in which he explained his evangelical views and pleaded for liberty of conscience. He also set out to combat Lutheran triumphalism at Antwerp with a &#145;godly admonition&#146;, <span class="italic">Epistre et amiable remonstrance</span> (1567; English edn, 1569), recommending a greater moderation in the matter of eucharistic doctrine, with a view to protestant unanimity, in accordance with the ideas of John &agrave; Lasco.<br>
<br>On the arrival of a Spanish garrison at Antwerp in April 1567 Corro went to London with his wife, Marie Lenaerts (whom he had married about 1560), their sons John and James, and two servants, took up residence in a house belonging to the duchess of Suffolk in Cripplegate ward, and attached himself to the Italian congregation of the Strangers' Church. Soon after, by favour of Sir William Cecil and Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, he became pastor of the Spanish congregation. As early as 1563 he had written from France, concerning the printing of a Spanish version of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, to Casiodoro de Reina (also a native of Seville), the first pastor of the Spanish congregation in London. But when the letter arrived Reina was no longer in London, having fled under a charge of sodomy, and the Spanish congregation had been divided between the French and Italian churches, until the arrival of Corro with other exiles gave occasion for reviving it. On 16 January 1568 he addressed a letter to Archbishop Parker, accompanied by his two publications in French, which he thought would be good reading for two children of the archbishop, who were then learning that language. Doubts about the orthodoxy of Corro's trinitarian views were raised by the French pastors in London, led by Jean Cousin. In seven letters Corro laid the case before Beza at Geneva, who did not like &#145;the hot, accusing spirit of this Spaniard&#146;, and left the matter in the hands of Grindal, in whom, as bishop of London, was vested the superintendence of the Strangers' Church  (<span class="italic">B&egrave;ze</span>, 10.47&#150;51). Grindal recognized Corro's learning but disapproved of the spirit in which he acted.<br>
<br>On 17 March 1569 Corro was suspended by Grindal for slander and obstinacy, but not for any doctrinal aberration. Doctrinal differences then arose between Corro and Gerolamo Ferliti, pastor of the Italian congregation, the main charge being that in his teaching, and in his <span class="italic">Tableau de l'&#339;uvre de Dieu</span> (1569), Corro showed Pelagian and universalist tendencies. Cecil continued to support his friend, and in May 1571 persuaded Edwin Sandys, Grindal's successor, to appoint Corro Latin reader in divinity at the Temple. He held this post for three years, but did not get on well with Richard Alvey, the master of the Temple, and was disliked for &#145;speaking not wisely on predestination and suspiciously uttering his judgement on Arianism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Matthew Parker</span>, 476). William Barlow, afterwards archdeacon of Salisbury, praised his eloquence and learning, but thought him wanting in respect for recognized authorities, and too great an admirer of Sebastian Castellio. On 5 March 1576 the earl of Leicester, chancellor of Oxford University, sent letters to the vice-chancellor and convocation asking that Corro might proceed DTh without fee. On 2 April convocation granted the request on condition &#145;that he purge himself of heretical opinions before the next act&#146;  (McFadden, 455, n. 1). Corro had already subscribed the Anglican articles before the privy council, but John Reynolds on 7 June wrote to Lawrence Humphrey, the vice-chancellor, reviving the charges against Corro and hinting that he was the source of the heresies of Francesco Pucci, an erratic Florentine who had given trouble to the university in the previous year. Corro's application was rejected on 13 June.<br>
<br>As Corro styles himself &#145;professor of sacred theology&#146; in a publication as early as 1574, he may have had a foreign or a Lambeth degree. In 1578 he published a commentary on <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span>, <span class="italic">Sapientissimi regis Salomonis concio</span> (English edn, 1586), which was widely admired and used. In the summer of that year the earl of Leicester supported him in an application for a post at Oxford. After severe examination he was admitted as a divinity reader in 1579. At Oxford, Corro lived as a student in Christ Church, and became reader of divinity to the students in Gloucester, St Mary, and Hart halls. He was <i>censor theologicus</i> at Christ Church (1578&#150;86), and matriculated as a member of Christ Church in 1586. In 1582 he obtained the prebend of Harlesden in St Paul's, London, and in 1585 was installed in Lichfield Cathedral as prebendary of Eccleshall. In 1586 he published a Spanish grammar, <span class="italic">Reglas gramaticales</span> (English edn, 1590), his only work in his native language, based on notes made about 1560 when he was tutor to the future Henri IV of France; most of its examples are drawn from scripture.<br>
<br>The charge of heresy was reiterated against Corro at Oxford in 1582, and has clung to his memory. Bonet-Maury places him among those who have rejected the doctrine of the Trinity, and McFadden asserts that one of his works, <span class="italic">Monas theologica</span> (unpublished in Corro's lifetime), &#145;is frankly unitarian&#146;, though he notes that Corro is essentially concerned with practical religion, not theological speculation  (McFadden, 692&#150;5). His published articles of faith (1574) are quite orthodox on that doctrine. Some of his London congregation may have been anti-trinitarian, but he does not seem to have been personally heterodox, except in the article of predestination and cognate doctrines, as held by Calvinists. He was a man of open mind, and a vigorous defender of toleration, not only among Christians but also toward Jews and Muslims; had his temper been less hot and his disposition more conciliatory, his career might have been brighter. Corro died in London on 30 March 1591, and was buried at St Andrew by the Wardrobe on 3 April. His wife and a daughter, Susan, survived him. In the eyes of posterity Corro has come to be perceived as &#145;a proto-Arminian &hellip; a pioneer of the intellectual reaction against John Calvin&#146;  (Collinson, 151), but this was also a perception current in his own lifetime. In the late 1570s Sir Henry Killigrew, Burghley's brother-in-law, was including regular reports on Corro's activities in his dispatches to William Davison, ambassador in the Netherlands, who shared his deep suspicions of Corro's theology, and when in 1585 Richard Hooker began preaching at the Temple, where Corro had briefly held sway, &#145;comparisons were at once drawn with the Spaniard&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
