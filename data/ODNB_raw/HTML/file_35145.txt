<span class="headword">Muirhead,  John Henry</span>  (1855&#150;1940), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was the third son of John William Muirhead (<i>d</i>. 1857), writer to the signet, of Glasgow, and his wife, Mary Burns (<i>d</i>. 1891), who claimed a connection with the novelist Susan Ferrier and her nephew the philosopher James Frederick Ferrier. He was born at Glasgow on 28 April 1855. He was educated at the Glasgow Academy (1866&#150;70), and proceeded to Glasgow University, where he was deeply influenced by the Hegelianism of Edward Caird, professor of moral philosophy. He graduated MA in 1875. The same year he won a Snell exhibition at Balliol College, Oxford, to which he went up in Trinity term 1875. His teachers included T. H. Green and R. L. Nettleship. Among his close friends and contemporaries were Henry Jones, J. S. Mackenzie, John MacCunn, D. G. Ritchie, A. C. Bradley, and W. P. Ker. After obtaining a first class in classical moderations (1877) he was, to the surprise of the college, placed in the second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1879. He was <i>proxime accessit</i> for the Gaisford prize for Greek prose and obtained the chancellor's Latin essay prize in 1881. After failing to obtain a fellowship, he became assistant in Latin to Professor George Gilbert Ramsay at Glasgow University from 1879 to 1885, when he left to study philosophy and theology at Manchester New College in London, and from then on philosophy was the subject to which he devoted himself.<br>
<br>In 1888 Muirhead was appointed lecturer in mental and moral science at the Royal Holloway College; he also lectured for Bedford College and the London Society for the Extension of University Teaching. In the same year he became editor of the <span class="roman">Library of Philosophy</span>, a position which he held until his death, and which he used to introduce to English readers many notable works by the prominent leaders of every school of thought, British, continental, and American. In 1886 he helped James Bonar and others to found the Ethical Society, and he also edited the <span class="roman">Ethical Library</span>. In 1892 he published his best-known textbook, <span class="italic">The Elements of Ethics</span>, which found a wide public. In 1897 he was appointed professor of philosophy and political economy in the Mason College at Birmingham. After the conversion of the college into the University of Birmingham (1900), political economy was, to Muirhead's relief, constituted as a separate chair, and he retained the chair of philosophy until his retirement in 1921.<br>
<br>Muirhead's mental and physical vigour continued unimpaired, and in two visits to the United States of America (1921&#150;2 and 1925&#150;8) he lectured extensively. He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1931. In retirement he devoted himself to initiating the <span class="roman">Contemporary British Philosophy</span> series, editing the <span class="roman">Library of Philosophy</span>, acting as chairman of the council of the newly founded British Institute of Philosophy, and maintaining an active interest in the modern developments of philosophy at home, on the continent, and in the United States. He was lecturing and writing to the very end.<br>
<br>Muirhead was far from being simply a stimulating teacher of philosophy. Always a social reformer in many spheres of civic endeavour, at Birmingham he played an important part in converting the Mason College into the first unitary civic university, and for twenty-six years was even more influential in the life of the city than in that of the classroom and senate. His interest in social questions was demonstrated by such publications as <span class="italic">By what Authority?</span> (1909), a collection of his newspaper articles on the poor-law commission, in which he sought to emphasize the points of agreement between the majority and minority reports. Here, as elsewhere, his simplicity of character, his concern to bring ethical principles to bear in practice, his sympathy with thinkers and systems opposed to his own views, and his determination to find a common denominator underlying apparent antagonisms, earned him respect and affection.<br>
<br>Philosophically, as a young man Muirhead had been deeply influenced by T. H. Green and R. L. Nettleship, as well as by Edward Caird, whose life he wrote in 1921 in collaboration with his friend Sir Henry Jones. Throughout his career he continued to regard Caird's philosophy as &#145;the true interpretation of the real Hegel&#146;  (Robertson and Ross, 382). Consequently, the innovations he sought to make in the more theoretical branches of philosophy were few. He preferred to concentrate, under Green's influence, on the application of idealist thought to moral, social, and political philosophy. Later influences included F. H. Bradley and Bernard Bosanquet, whom he knew well, so that, although his chief interest was ethics&#151;in which his main problem was to state the relations between the end or good and the rule or obligation for achieving it (in 1932 he published <span class="italic">Rule and End in Morals</span>)&#151;he continued to be throughout his career a prominent representative of the British school of idealists [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/98159', "British idealists")</script>]. This general attitude is maintained particularly in <span class="italic">Coleridge as Philosopher</span> (1930), which remains the best account of Coleridge's philosophy with emphasis on the Platonic elements in it. This emphasis links it with his <span class="italic">The Platonic Tradition in Anglo-Saxon Philosophy</span> (1931), which leads from the Platonists of the seventeenth century to Muirhead's own philosophical position, and represents nineteenth-century British idealism as the organic development of a native platonic tradition. It also contains a study of Bradley's metaphysics. Thanks to his wide professional contacts and open and sympathetic attitude towards divergent philosophies, his autobiographical <span class="italic">Reflections by a Journeyman in Philosophy</span> (1942) and his memorial and other accounts of his contemporaries constitute an informal but reliable history of much of the philosophical thought, including its connections with social thought, in Britain in his day. The open and receptive character of his idealism meant that he was well placed to carry the initial impulse of idealist thought through the currents of later philosophical developments, finding some common ground with pragmatism and the new realism.<br>
<br>Muirhead was twice married: first, on 29 July 1892, to Mary Talbot (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of the Revd Gilbert Innes Wallas and sister of Graham Wallas; second, in the spring of 1927, to Pauline, daughter of George Bailey, who survived him. There were no children from either marriage. He died at his home, Dyke End, Rotherfield, Sussex, on 24 May 1940, with mental powers unabated.<br>
