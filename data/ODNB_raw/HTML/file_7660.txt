<span class="headword">Dillon,  Peter</span>  (1788&#150;1847), <span class="occ">adventurer in the south seas</span>, was born on 15 June 1788 on Martinique, the son of an Irishman, Peter Dillon, probably a soldier stationed on the island. About 1806 Dillon appears to have sailed for Calcutta and he later traded sandalwood between the west Pacific islands and China. In 1809 he spent four months in Fiji, mixing with Fijians and learning their language. He lived on Bora-Bora, in the Society Islands, from 1810 to 1812 and claimed to have become the adopted son of Tapoa, a powerful chief; he took as his mistress a daughter of another chief.<br>
<br>In 1812 and 1813 Dillon was third mate on the <i>Hunter</i>. In September 1813 men from the <i>Hunter</i>, when on shore at Wailea, were attacked by Fijians, who killed twelve Europeans and about forty others, later eating many of them. Dillon's coolness and knowledge of the Fijians allowed him and two others to escape. Those who had fled the fighting were taken by Dillon on the <i>Hunter</i>'s sister ship <i>Elizabeth</i> to Tikopia (lat. 12&deg;10' S, long. 168&deg;50' E), where the Prussian Martin Buchert, his Fijian wife, and a Lascar known as Joe were landed. After his return to Sydney, Dillon achieved some fame by recounting the affair. In 1814 he was commissioned by the Church Missionary Society to take missionaries to New Zealand. On 22 September 1814 he married Mary Moore in Sydney and she and their children often accompanied him on his voyages. From 1819 to 1825 he shipped criminals, mail, and merchandise between India and Australia in his own ships, two of which he wrecked.<br>
<br>On a trip to South America, Dillon met the widow of M&aacute;ximo Rodr&iacute;guez, the Spanish explorer of Tahiti, whose diary she gave to Dillon and a summary of which he published in the Bengal <span class="italic">Government Gazette</span>. This fostered his interest in early Pacific exploration, an interest which gained impetus in May 1826, when, on a visit to Tikopia, Dillon obtained from Buchert and Joe a silver sword-guard and spoon, which he rightly guessed were relics of the lost expedition of J. F. G. de La P&eacute;rouse. The artefacts had come from Vanikoro, in the Santa Cruz Islands; Dillon made for the islands, but when his supplies ran short and the ship began to leak he was forced to return to Calcutta.<br>
<br>Keen to investigate the discovery further, the East India Company fitted out the <i>Research</i> which, under Dillon's command, sailed from Calcutta in January 1827. The voyage was marred by illness and a quarrel between Dillon and Robert Tytler, the ship's doctor. Dillon thought Tytler mutinous: Tytler thought Dillon mad. Although Tytler was the more reprehensible, it was Dillon who was tried and imprisoned in Hobart for assault and false imprisonment. Dillon's sentence was remitted and the <i>Research</i> sailed on, reaching New Zealand, where he learned that Dumont D'Urville was also looking for the remains of La P&eacute;rouse's expedition. In September Dillon reached Tikopia, where, through Buchert's influence, he bought further artefacts; he sailed on to Vanikoro, where he found the remains of La P&eacute;rouse's two wrecked ships, and numerous artefacts unquestionably from La P&eacute;rouse's expedition, which he carried off. D'Urville, hearing of Dillon's discovery, landed at Tikopia, gathered further relics and erected a memorial. On reaching Calcutta in April 1828, Dillon was warmly received by the governor, but found that the failure of his agents had left him penniless. He and his family sailed to England where, despite acclaim from the press, he got a mixed reaction from the East India Company. They left, after only three days, for Paris, where Dillon gave his finds to Charles X, who placed them in the Louvre; the king awarded Dillon the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, an annual pension of 4000 francs, and a grant towards his expenses. Through the <span class="italic">Narrative</span> (1829) of his voyage, Dillon tried to secure public acclaim, a scientific reputation, and financial security; its valuable descriptions of the peoples of the south seas won it some fame, and French and Dutch editions were published, but it is marred by diatribes against Tytler.<br>
<br>After this Dillon never found occupation which made use of his knowledge of the south seas or which relieved his poverty. His plans for French Roman Catholic missions in the Pacific, his employment in 1834 as a flax trader to New Zealand, and his repeated petitions to the British, French, and other governments for a pension in recognition of his services to exploration all came to nothing. After the death of his wife in 1840 Dillon went to Paris, where he died, at 23 rue des Postes, on 9 February 1847. Dillon was 6 feet 4 inches tall, heavily built with a mop of red hair. He was courageous, and understood and liked the peoples of the Pacific. He could be brutal to his wife and subordinates, but in general commanded the respect even of those who disliked him. His knowledge of the Pacific and its exploration was impressive in one who lacked formal education.<br>
