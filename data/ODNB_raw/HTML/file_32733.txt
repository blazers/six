</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Davidson,  Randall Thomas</span>, Baron Davidson of Lambeth  (1848&#150;1930), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was born at 15 Inverleith Place, Edinburgh, on 7 April 1848, of pure Scottish blood. He was the eldest son of Henry Davidson (1810&#150;1889), timber merchant of Leith, and his wife, Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1881), third daughter of John Swinton, formerly an army officer, who added the name of Campbell when he inherited estates at Kimmerghame, Berwickshire, from a maternal aunt. Henry's father, the Revd Thomas Randall, had changed his name to Davidson in 1794 as a condition of inheriting an estate at Muirhouse, near Edinburgh. Henry's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather were presbyterian ministers, the last being a chaplain to Queen Anne. Both Henry and his wife were devoutly religious, though this did not prevent Henry enjoying hunting and music, nor operating a modestly profitable business, which enabled him to leave &pound;4145.<h2>
<a name="Educationillhealthmarriage"></a>Education, ill health, marriage</h2>Henry had been educated at the high school in Edinburgh, and then the famous Edinburgh Academy, where a lifelong friendship had been forged with Archibald Campbell Tait, subsequently to be archbishop of Canterbury. It was the Tait, lowland Scots connection which was to be decisive for Henry's son. Randall Thomas Davidson was baptized at home on 18 May 1848 according to the presbyterian form. He was to be reminded of this in 1905 when Princess Victoria Eugenie's baptism at Balmoral was discounted by the Spanish Roman Catholic bishops. Young Randall enjoyed the lowland countryside, narrowly escaping drowning on one occasion. In 1862 he entered Harrow School, where he came under the influence of two Anglican clergy: Henry Montague Butler, and Brooke Foss Westcott, later to be bishop of Durham. He was confirmed into the Church of England at the age of fourteen by his father's old friend A. C. Tait, then bishop of London.<br>
<br>In the school holidays in 1866 Davidson narrowly escaped death while returning from an expedition to shoot rabbits. A friend accidentally pulled his trigger and blasted a hole the size of an orange in Davidson's lower back. A large portion of the pelvis and the muscles of his hips were damaged. For the rest of his life Davidson had to disguise his disabilities. The damage to the hip muscles meant that he was always liable to attacks of lumbago. More difficult to cope with was the need to wear a truss to hold a hernia on the right side. The rupture often came down when Davidson was preaching but he devised cunning coping strategies.<br>
<br>After school Davidson had a dismal three years at Trinity College, Oxford, where his poor physical condition culminated in a breakdown in 1871 in the middle of his final examinations. On the basis of the few papers he had done he was awarded a third class in law and modern history. Davidson had never been drawn to any other life work than the ordained ministry, and seems to have been totally unaffected by the intellectual and theological battles which were being passionately fought in Oxford. After more foreign travels he began his ministerial studies as one of the lodgers of Charles John Vaughan, master of the temple, who also directed his reading and criticized his sermons. Another breakdown in health led to a tour of Egypt and Palestine with three old Oxford friends, one of whom was Crauford Tait, the archbishop's son. Largely through Crauford's influence Davidson was accepted for ordination in the diocese of Canterbury, as curate of Dartford. The archbishop's only requirement seems to have been the removal of his heavy moustache, and he was ordained deacon in 1874 and priest in 1875. Davidson now aspired to succeed at the centre of the ecclesiastical and national life of England. The year after ordination he put his name down for the Athenaeum, and declined all offers of advancement which would take him away from the home counties. In 1877 he was invited, at Crauford's suggestion, to succeed him as private secretary and resident chaplain to the archbishop. The following year Crauford died and on 12 November Davidson married his sister, Edith Murdoch Tait (<i>b</i>. 1858), the nineteen-year-old second daughter of the archbishop. Mrs Davidson was a charming hostess and devoted clergy-wife. The marriage was described by his successor, Cosmo Gordon Lang, as a &#145;perfect union of mind and spirit&#146;; they had no children. For the next four years Davidson occupied an increasingly influential role at Lambeth Palace where the archbishop, reeling under the double blow of the deaths of both son and wife in six months, came to rely heavily on his judgement of men and situations. Tait now found the palace unbearably claustrophobic and took to drafting letters with his secretary as he paced round the gravel paths of Lambeth, once insisting on assessing diocesan statistics while they rode together on horseback along the Embankment on a breezy day. Gradually Davidson found himself suggesting courses of action and forms of words which he knew from experience reflected the mind of the archbishop, who came to place total confidence in his son-in-law. It was in this position that Davidson largely took over the correspondence generated by the ritualism controversy in 1881, and played a significant role in torpedoing Anglican overtures to the Salvation Army in 1882, which he thought concentrated too much power in the office of the general. When Tait died in 1882 it was to Davidson that Queen Victoria turned for an account of the deathbed scene. An invitation to Windsor followed; the queen was much impressed by the young Scot, confiding in her journal the belief that &#145;Mr. Davidson is a man who may be of great use to me&#146;  (Barker, 397). The 34-year-old chaplain quickly became the trusted confidant of the 63-year-old queen.<h2>
<a name="Advisertothearchbishopandthequeen"></a>Adviser to the archbishop and the queen</h2>Soon Davidson was steering the queen into the choice of Edward White Benson, bishop of Truro, as new archbishop, who, recognizing Davidson's competence and sound judgement of people, retained him as chaplain until he was in 1883, at the queen's request, appointed dean of Windsor, and her domestic chaplain. Queen Victoria soon turned to him for spiritual consolation, beginning in 1884 when her youngest son, Leopold, duke of Albany, died. Davidson, though attentive, was more than a tame chaplain&#150;courtier. He incurred the royal wrath in the same year when he counselled the queen against the publication of further <span class="italic">Leaves from a Highland Diary</span>, which would have contained revelations about her servant John Brown that were open to satire. That she trusted his judgement can be seen from her unfailing consultation with him between 1883 and 1901 about senior ecclesiastical appointments. Until Benson's death in 1896 Davidson had a unique influence in shaping the attitudes and decisions of both sovereign and primate. Benson wrote to him almost every day, and particularly depended on his advice in 1888&#150;90 during the trial of Edward King, high-church bishop of Lincoln, for alleged ritual illegalities. King was largely exonerated: Davidson's role was to shape church and public opinion through writing leading articles for <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and in liaising with Lord Halifax, the Anglo-Catholic lay leader.<br>
<br>Davidson's grasp of Anglican affairs and key personalities was consolidated by his work as assistant secretary of the Lambeth conference of 1881, attended by 100 bishops from the Anglican dioceses of the British empire, United States, and elsewhere. His <span class="italic">Life of Archbishop Tait</span> (1891), written with William Benham, showed a mastery of recent developments in the Church of England and a sure judgement in their interpretation.<h2>
<a name="BishopofRochesterthenWinchester"></a>Bishop of Rochester, then Winchester</h2>In 1891 the queen reluctantly consented to Davidson's appointment to the bishopric of Rochester, which then included south London. The muck-raking <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> described her choice as &#145;a royal job&#146;. About ten days after his consecration Davidson vomited blood and was confined to his house in Kennington for six months. He suffered three more spells of illness during his four years in south London. In 1893 he attended a meeting of leaders from all religious traditions called by the editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Chronicle</span> to discuss the coal strike, in which he urged the importance of a living wage. In 1894&#150;5 he largely drafted Archbishop Benson's rejection of the project hatched by Lord Halifax and the Abb&eacute; Portal to ask the pope to recognize the validity of Anglican orders.<br>
<br>In 1895 Davidson accepted translation to the diocese of Winchester, which involved less evening work, as well as renewing his access to the queen, who spent much time, and ultimately died, at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The country air restored his health. He was almost immediately drawn into controversy with Robert William Radcliffe Dolling, a fervent Anglo-Catholic priest in charge of Winchester College's mission at Landport. Dolling had a long history of provoking bishops, which came to a head with the dedication of the large, new St Agatha's church. Davidson, whose appointment had been publicly criticized by Dolling because of his health problems, discovered only three days before the opening that it contained a third altar to be used for masses for the dead. Davidson immediately saw Dolling and tried to reach a compromise which would bring his practices within Anglican rules. But compromise was impossible and Dolling resigned immediately and left the diocese. His supporters castigated Davidson, and the episode led one high-church journalist to conclude that it left its mark in forming his determination not to be the archbishop who drove the high-church party out of the Church of England.<br>
<br>When Archbishop Benson died in 1896 Davidson lost his influence at Lambeth Palace and had to endure the sarcasm of the new archbishop, Frederick Temple, who suspected him of having wanted the appointment himself. The queen vetoed the offer of the bishopric of London in 1897, on the grounds that his health would not stand it, and when Lord Salisbury offered it again in 1901, Davidson himself refused for the same reason. He now divided his time between the diocese, the House of Lords where he was a frequent speaker (especially on licensing and education), and national church policy. Between 1898 and 1901 Davidson was actively involved in seeking a way through the ritual controversy and corresponded at length with Sir William Harcourt, the elderly former Liberal politician, who was an Erastian in church matters and resented any deviations from the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. (Harcourt lived at Malwood which was in the Winchester diocese.) Davidson devoted his episcopal charge of 1899 to a comprehensive treatment of the whole subject. His grasp of the issues led in 1901 to his first meeting with the prime minister, A. J. Balfour, who recorded that &#145;the Bishop has the art of stating with great clearness and sympathy the gist of opinions from which he differs&#146;  (Bell, 3rd edn, 349). His advice on public primary education was sought and valued by Balfour in framing the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1902. Once the bill had been introduced Davidson was on hand to suggest tactics as well as to defend principles. To counter the vehement nonconformist opposition, led by the Baptist minister Dr John Clifford, he suggested to Balfour &#145;that it would be well to let Clifford publish his letters as a pamphlet and thus commit himself more deliberately to them before any attempt is made to show their falsity&#146;  (Bell, 3rd edn, 377). When Temple died Balfour nominated Davidson as his successor and he was enthroned at Canterbury on 12 February 1903.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofCanterbury"></a>Archbishop of Canterbury</h2>Davidson saw his task as holding the Church of England together, maintaining its historic position in the national life, and providing a Christian witness in moral, social, and political matters. Through his membership of the House of Lords, and of Grillions and &#145;the Club&#146;, Davidson gave time to making friendships with men of weight. He particularly cultivated the friendship of leading politicians with a Scottish background: Lord Rosebery, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and A. J. Balfour. His constant presence in the Lords, at official dinners, and in small gatherings of the governing &eacute;lite was a continuation of the policy of Archbishop Tait.<br>
<br>Within a month of his appointment Davidson was challenged by 100 Unionist members of parliament to take firm action against clergy who were ignoring the law and introducing Roman Catholic ceremonial practices. Davidson's reply was resolute. The actual number of flagrant lawbreakers was, he thought, small, but for them &#145;the sands [of time] have run out&#146;  (Bell, 3rd edn, 399). Feeling in the Commons was such that Balfour felt he would be obliged to appoint a select committee of the House of Commons. Davidson feared that such a step would infuriate even moderate high-churchmen by asserting the authority of the Commons over the church. Only someone steeped in parliamentary procedures would have realized the advantage of persuading Balfour instead to appoint a royal commission on ecclesiastical discipline, which met from 1904 to 1906. After amassing evidence the commissioners were unanimous in concluding that certain specific illegalities should be made to cease, but also that the law of public worship was &#145;too narrow for the religious life of the present generation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report of the Royal Commission on Ecclesiastical Discipline</span>, 1906, 75&#150;6). The commission thus opened the door for the revision of the prayer book which was to cause such controversy in 1927 and 1928.<br>
<br>In his first public utterances as archbishop on matters of national controversy Davidson was criticized by nonconformists and Liberals for appearing to provide Christian underpinning for his tory patron. In February 1904 he showed concern over the compounds set up in the Transvaal in which imported Chinese indentured labour was to be confined. But against opposition cries of &#145;Chinese slavery&#146; Davidson seemed to moderate his concerns when in a later speech he described imported labour as a &#145;regrettable necessity&#146;. This last phrase, plucked from its context, was used in speeches and newspaper cartoons to vilify the archbishop. In June 1905 further criticism came when Davidson, who disliked public demonstrations, refused to receive a delegation of unemployed working men who had marched to London from Leicester led by a Christian socialist clergyman, Lewis Donaldson. Even dutiful Anglican clergy bridled in the spring of 1906 when it was announced that the king's niece, Princess Victoria Eugenie, was to marry King Alfonso X of Spain. The public silence of the archbishop at the conversion of the eighteen-year-old granddaughter of Queen Victoria to the Roman Catholic faith, in order to marry into what to British popular protestant prejudice seemed a degenerate Spanish Catholic court, gave the impression of lamentable weakness. In fact Davidson was privately outraged by the insistence of the Spanish Catholic hierarchy that the princess should not only convert but also receive Catholic baptism. He was indefatigable in his advice to the royal family but unwilling publicly to oppose the evident wish of the young princess.<br>
<br>In 1907 Davidson maintained the traditional Anglican opposition to the <span class="roman">Deceased Wife's Sister Marriage Bill</span>. When it was carried he noted that for:<blockquote>the first time in the history of the Church of England, has the law of the State been brought on one specific point into direct open, overt contrast with, and contradiction of, the specific and divine law laid down in the authoritative regulations of the national church. (Bell, 3rd edn, 552)</blockquote>His advice to clergy was that such marriages should not be held in Anglican churches, but that those in such marriages should not, on that ground, be refused holy communion, or otherwise deprived of the church's ministrations.Davidson's leadership was severely tested by the new Liberal government's attempts to pass an education bill which would remove those features of the 1902 act considered unjust by nonconformists. The bill introduced by Augustine Birrell in 1906 seemed to Davidson to violate the deep-seated Anglican conviction that the Church of England had a God-given duty to provide a national system of church schools for the nation. Although unwell with gastric influenza he left his bed to attend three private meetings with Conservative leaders at Lord Lansdowne's house to consider tactics. Balfour wanted the peers to insert amendments which would be unacceptable to the Liberal majority in the Commons, but Davidson wrote from his bed to urge caution and compromise. Rumours that the archbishop was willing to make concessions enraged the National Society, the organization that provided and controlled Church of England schools. In December, Davidson voted with the Conservative peers to defeat the bill, but during the following year he worked hard for a settlement with Walter Runciman, who had taken over the government's attempts to get an agreed solution through parliament. This time Davidson could not deliver the agreement of his church. Though supported by the bishops, the Representative Church Council voted overwhelmingly to reject the measure, and it was abandoned by the government.<br>
<br>Davidson presided at the Lambeth conference of 242 Anglican bishops in 1908, and the unofficial Pan-Anglican Congress which immediately preceded it. Throughout the summer groups of overseas bishops and their wives were invited by the archbishop and Mrs Davidson to spend two nights at Lambeth Palace, where networks were forged and local knowledge transmitted. It was to Davidson at Lambeth that Anglican bishops invariably turned when confronted by difficulties. He had been the first archbishop of Canterbury to cross the Atlantic and pay an official visit to the United States of America and Canada in 1904.<br>
<br>In 1910 Davidson, after much hesitation, was persuaded to attend the World Missionary Conference at Edinburgh under the chairmanship of the American Methodist layman Dr John R. Mott. Though called to consider missionary difficulties, the conference has come to be regarded as the birthplace of the modern ecumenical movement. Mott had been determined that it should be as carefully balanced and, as far as possible, genuinely representative of all the Christian bodies in the world. The archbishop of Canterbury was an obvious adornment for such a gathering, but Mott knew that Davidson's natural caution was likely to prevent his acceptance of an invitation. Therefore Mott first secured the attendance of two high-church bishops, Gore and Talbot, whose judgement was known to be respected by Davidson. Once assured that he would be joining such company he agreed to attend, and was ultimately inspired by the occasion into delivering an uncharacteristically prophetic speech.<br>
<br>The debates over Lloyd George's &#145;people's budget&#146; and the <span class="roman">Parliament Act</span> exposed Davidson to more charges of political partisanship. When the <span class="roman">Finance Bill</span> was rejected by the House of Lords in November 1909 Davidson and most of the bishops abstained, thereby incurring the odium of supporters of both government and opposition. In that debate he expressed the belief that the bishops could, and should, speak with authority on religious, educational, social, and moral questions, but were wise to avoid more overtly party political issues. However the new archbishop of York, Cosmo Lang, and Bishop Gore had supported the government, and Bishop Browne of Bristol had voted with the Unionists. After the two general elections in 1910 Davidson played an important part in the consultations in August 1911 preceding the final division on the <span class="roman">Parliament Bill</span>, limiting the powers of the House of Lords. When it was announced that the new king George V had agreed to the creation of sufficient peers to secure the passing of the bill Davidson, after taking the advice of Sir William Anson, led most of the bishops in support of the bill, primarily to prevent the creation of 500 new Liberal peers, which might have resulted in a weakening of the prestige of the House of Lords as a platform for episcopal pronouncements. &#145;Beaten by the bishops and the rats&#146; was Unionist MP George Wyndham's comment  (<span class="italic">Life and Letters of George Wyndham</span>, ed. MacKarl and Wyndham, 1925, 2.699).<br>
<br>In the years before the First World War, Davidson had taken a restrained interest in the efforts of the Anglo-German friendship movement. He was, not surprisingly, jittery about the number of Lutheran pastors making a visit to London in 1908, which he feared might cause a high-church commotion if they were admitted to communion at Anglican altars. In 1909 he urged Bishop Boyd Carpenter to join the British delegation to Berlin because &#145;it would be disastrous were it to appear as if the Nonconformists were anxious for friendliness with Germany, while we Churchmen were only anxious to build more Dreadnoughts&#146;  (Bell, 3rd edn, 592). Another issue of the day was the disestablishment of the church in Wales, which was enacted in 1914, and operative from 1920. Davidson firmly resisted this both in and out of parliament.<br>
<br>Intercommunion between Anglicans and Christians belonging to other denominations became a contentious issue early in the twentieth century. The beginnings of the ecumenical movement both in Britain and overseas at a time when the Anglo-Catholic tradition was gaining in influence in the Church of England opened new possibilities for doctrinal conflict. Davidson's gifts for conciliation were stretched to the limit in the ecclesiastical implosions provoked by the Kikuyu controversy of 1913&#150;14. Two sets of questions about Christian belief and church order came together. Increasing scepticism about the plausibility of biblical miracles found some support in new developments in biblical criticism. This seemed to have implications for the foundations of Christian belief. Bishop Charles Gore of Oxford wanted the whole matter to be thrashed out in the public arena of the convocation of Canterbury, and he sought the repudiation of books by Anglican clergymen which denied or cast doubt on the virgin birth and physical resurrection of Jesus. The archbishop knew that biblical scholarship in the universities could not be restricted, and that attempts to pre-empt academic conclusions would show the church up as myopic, pedestrian, mindlessly dogmatic, and anti-intellectual. He took counsel with Bishop F. H. Chase of Ely and Bishop E. S. Talbot, who both supported the safer course of a discussion at a private meeting of bishops. Gore was dissatisfied with the refusal of the bishops to take his view, and in 1913 alarmed Davidson by talking of resignation.<br>
<br>A year later this theological debate was absorbed into a wider church conflagration. Ignited by a small gathering of missionaries from various denominations at Kikuyu in east Africa to plan a more effective deployment of missionary forces, and concluding with a service of holy communion, conducted by the bishop of Mombasa, the event came to be invested with symbolic significance by all discontented with the present state of the Church of England. The bishop of Zanzibar, Frank Weston, emerged as champion of Anglo-Catholic hardliners. He confronted the archbishop with a fierce denunciation of the participation of the bishops of Mombasa and Uganda in a communion service with free churchmen, raising the huge question of what the Church of England really stood for. Was it primarily a national church, offering its ministry to all the peoples of the British empire, or was it a eucharistic community, presided over by episcopally ordained priests and restricted exclusively to those baptized and confirmed?<br>
<br>Davidson had already set out his position in February 1912 when he delivered a visitation charge, which was published under the title of <span class="italic">The Character and Call of the Church of England</span>. Chapter 3 answered those who asked, &#145;What does our Church stand for?&#146; In reply, Davidson emphasized &#145;the historical continuity of the Church's corporate and organic life&#146; which he interpreted as &#145;a sacramental, governmental, ministerial, and even ritual system which, with adaptation to local requirements has come down to us from Apostolic days&#146;. The archbishop went on to legitimize <span class="roman">New Testament</span> scholarship by asserting that &#145;we stand for the unfettered study of Holy Scripture, for the liberty of private judgement&#146;.<br>
<br>The first stage of what became an increasingly acrimonious controversy revealed the immense gap between the clerical and lay mind and showed that the sacerdotal concept of ministry which had been gaining ground among the clergy was alien to the thinking of the laity. Anglo-Catholic realization of the situation produced a strategic switch from questions of church order to doctrine. In insisting on the historicity of the virgin birth and the physical resurrection of Jesus, high-churchmen and evangelicals could stand together, and many followed Bishop Gore in wanting to require Anglican clergymen to affirm unequivocally the historical statements in the creed about the virgin birth and physical resurrection of Jesus. But Davidson persuaded convocation in April 1914 instead to support a motion which declared only that &#145;the denial of any of the historical facts stated in the Creeds goes beyond the limits of legitimate interpretation&#146;. This resolution was amplified a few months later when Davidson expressed the opinion that the most recent speculations of the distinguished Oxford theologian William Sanday did not fall outside those limits. Three years later Davidson was forced to reconsider those limits by the indignation aroused by the appointment of Hensley Henson to the bishopric of Hereford.<h2>
<a name="ThechurchandtheFirstWorldWar"></a>The church and the First World War</h2>The outbreak of war with Germany in 1914 swept Kikuyu from the public mind. Davidson, who valued his contacts with German theologians such as the Berlin professor Adolf von Harnack and had always considered war between the two great protestant powers &#145;unthinkable&#146;, found it difficult at first wholly to remain detached from the unbalanced emotions of war. When the spy mania was at its height even the archbishop felt it his duty to pass on to the Metropolitan Police his suspicions that a tobacconist with a shop near Woolwich might be a German spy. Anxiety about the outcome of military engagements led in 1914 to hourly telephone calls from Mary Benson's house in Sussex, where illness turned a short break into a three-week stay. In 1915 Lord Bryce's report apparently authenticating German war crimes led Davidson to claim that &#145;we are at this moment fighting against what is veritably the work of the Devil&#146;. But while he shared the nation's patriotic concerns and did not hesitate to take the lead, when requested by the government, in the production of a response by British religious leaders to the manifesto of the German church leaders in support of the war, Davidson generally rose above the narrow chauvinism of many of his clerical colleagues. He rebuked a clergyman who insulted a royal princess for her German family ties, and held out against conscripting the clergy for combatant service until the final manpower shortage of 1918. He then told the government that the Church of England no longer opposed clerical conscription, but the clause was dropped following the refusal of the Irish Catholic hierarchy to allow their clergy (unlike priests in France) to become soldiers. Throughout the war years Davidson believed that it was the duty of the church to steady the nation and prevent any sudden swings of national mood or moral lurches. In July 1915 he set up a small group to assess the spiritual needs of the nation and suggest an appropriate way forward. This led to the National Mission of Repentance and Hope in 1916, but uncertainty about its aims and objectives and the subdued public mind produced a disappointing response. Davidson was anxious to prevent the deterioration of moral standards. He questioned the wisdom of the amount of money being given in separation allowances to soldiers' wives, and succeeded in preventing unmarried partners receiving the same amount as of right. In this matter Lloyd George considered his attitude &#145;a piece of blatant hypocrisy&#146;, though he was glad to have the archbishop's support for the even more hypocritical &#145;king's pledge&#146; to abstain from alcohol for the duration of the war. In 1918 Davidson raised with the War Office and in the House of Lords the toleration of brothels close to army camps.<br>
<br>Davidson was to protest every year of the war &#145;quietly but firmly&#146; (his chaplain George Bell's words) against the British government's methods of warfare. In February 1915 Asquith was, according to Davidson, &#145;taken aback by the bluntness&#146; of his criticism, in a conversation, of the false information put out to hide British military reverses. In May 1915 the use of poisoned gas was forthrightly condemned by the archbishop in a private letter to Asquith. The bombing of Freiburg in April 1917 in retaliation for the sinking of two hospital ships appalled tender consciences. Louise Creighton, a bishop's widow, and formidable leader of churchwomen, implored Davidson &#145;in the name of the Church&#146; to denounce &#145;these horrible and futile reprisals against Germany&#146;. But the archbishop's instinctive reaction was to shrink from publicly embarrassing the wartime government. &#145;It often happens that private pressure is more useful, although it does not appease our public sympathisers who prefer to say that we are doing nothing&#146;, he replied to her. &#145;I have been familiar with that difficulty through all my public life.&#146; Eventually he put down a question in the Lords. &#145;One must be very considerate for the Government,&#146; he wrote, &#145;remembering that they have to carry with them the Allies as well as to decide for themselves. Heroics on such a question, though very tempting, are not very practicable and not very fair to the Government.&#146; But even to question the policy of reprisals was interpreted as hampering the war effort, and the duke of Argyll was given much newspaper coverage for his injunction to the bishops to &#145;stick to their belfries&#146;  (Bell, 3rd edn, 832). Two months later Davidson responded to the ferocious public mood created by the bombing of London by a public exchange of letters with his doctor, Sir Thomas Barlow. The archbishop reminded him of a resolution earlier passed by the bishops objecting to &#145;a policy of reprisal which has, as a deliberate object, the killing and wounding of non-combatants&#146;  (Bell, 3rd edn, 833). By October Davidson could write: &#145;I am regarded apparently as the representative mouthpiece of those who object to reprisals undertaken with the deliberate object of injuring non-combatants&#146;  (ibid., 837). The hate mail flooded into Lambeth Palace.<br>
<br>The First World War exacerbated tensions within the church, particularly between Anglo-Catholics and liberal thinkers. The determination of Lloyd George in 1917 to nominate Dean Hensley Henson to the see of Hereford was against Davidson's advice and caused an angry agitation. Henson had a reputation as a provocative preacher. He had defended scholars such as J. M. Thompson, B. H. Streeter, and William Sanday, who had questioned the literal interpretation of the virgin birth and resurrection. Bishop Charles Gore called on the bishops to refuse to join in Henson's consecration, and yet again threatened his resignation. All the alarm bells in Davidson's mind were set ringing. He feared that this might be the moment of disruption which he had spent his life trying to avoid. He went behind the smears of the fearful and turned to Henson's published writings, which he found far less heterodox than expected. He then composed a short statement to reassure Gore, which Henson accepted but did not sign. An exchange of letters was then made public in which Henson confirmed that he could join wholeheartedly in the saying of the creed, and had no wish to alter it. Henson later considered that Davidson had been panicked by a report from his secretary that men on the London underground had been overheard making ribald remarks about &#145;some kind of an atheist&#146; being made a bishop. He considered that excessive moral pressure had been applied by Davidson to get him to sign, which he had done with much reluctance, and only with the addition of a statement that he stood by his published work. Gore now withdrew his protest and Henson became an outstanding bishop.<br>
<br>The war had shown up the gap between church and nation, and gave rise to demands for a more effective and imaginative effort for religious renewal. In 1916 Dick Sheppard gathered together a group of young enthusiasts under the banner of &#145;Life and liberty&#146; with William Temple at their head. The archbishop was wary of impetuous raw enthusiasm and in its early days distanced himself. Private correspondence with Temple reassured him, and with masterly skill Davidson arranged a partnership between the new movement and the highly respectable but half-baked Church Self-Government Association set up following a report prepared for the archbishops by a committee chaired by the earl of Selborne. By this means energies were diverted into campaigning for the establishment of a church assembly with limited devolved powers. Through undertaking to pilot the measure through parliament Davidson kept ultimate control of the movement and its outcome, which though disappointing to Sheppard, brought into being bureaucratic structures which took further the archbishop's goals for the more effective management of the church.<h2>
<a name="Postwarthegeneralstrikeprayerbookcontroversy"></a>Post war: the general strike, prayer book controversy</h2>In 1920 Davidson presided again over the Lambeth conference which made an &#145;Appeal to All Christian People&#146; and in the mood of post-war optimism invited dialogue between Christians of different traditions. As chief pastor of the nation which had won the war he had tremendous international prestige, which was recognized by his unopposed election as president of the World Alliance for the Promotion of International Friendship through the Churches. Church leaders in nations which had not done well out of war now looked to Davidson as a kind of protestant pope, who was thought to have significant influence on the British government. Appeals for support came from Christian minorities in eastern Europe, the Near East, and from the Orthodox in Soviet Russia. In 1922 the Greek Orthodox ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople, Melitios Metaxarchis, recognized Anglican orders, cynics said as part of a desperate bid to save St Sophia from the Turks. Anglo-Catholics, encouraged by their growing strength at home, expanded conversations between Viscount Halifax and the French Abb&eacute; Portal into an unofficial exchange of views between Anglican and Roman Catholic theologians led by the Belgian Cardinal Mercier at Mechelen (Malines). Archbishop Davidson agreed to take note of the conversations, after learning that Pope Pius XI was already doing so.<br>
<br>In 1923 Davidson thought seriously about resigning, because he did not feel comfortable &#145;with the modern social interpretation of Christianity&#146;. His offers to mediate in strikes on the railways in 1919 and the coalmines in 1921 had not been taken up. His immediate reaction to the general strike in 1926 was to follow Asquith's denunciation in the Lords, but to add that every effort should still be made to reach a settlement. This left open the possibility of conciliation, and the archbishop was besieged by concerned individuals as disparate as R. H. Tawney and Lord Londonderry, who saw him as possibly the last hope in breaking the deadlock. Prodded by Henry Carter, a Wesleyan leader, and Prebendary P. T. R. Kirk of the Industrial Christian Fellowship, Davidson worked with them and others on 6 May to produce an appeal for the resumption of negotiations, involving &#145;simultaneously and concurrently&#146; the cancellation of the strike; the government subsidy of the coal industry to be continued temporarily; the cancellation of the wage reductions. That afternoon Davidson had secured the agreement of Ramsay MacDonald for the Labour Party but the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, insisted that the strike must be called off before any talks could begin. Davidson's lame response was that he could not make any alterations without the approval of the parties who had agreed the statement, and that they could not be contacted in time. The BBC, on the advice of J. C. C. Davidson, deputy civil commissioner, refused to allow the archbishop to make a broadcast. &#145;This was the low-water mark of the power and influence of the BBC,&#146; commented its historian, Asa Briggs. The archbishop was criticized by those who feared appearing to give in to the unions, but he was cheered in the streets, and in many places workers marched to church for services of thanksgiving. In fact the appeal was important in overcoming the long-standing suspicion among many trades unionists that the Church of England was part of the establishment, but Davidson preferred to play down its significance: &#145;I think myself that the direct importance of the Appeal to which I gave expression has been somewhat exaggerated but its indirect importance has evidently been very great&#146;. A part echo of this episode can be seen in the actions of Davidson's old schoolmaster, B. F. Westcott, who in 1893, as their bishop, had given the Durham miners the opportunity to return to work with dignity.<br>
<br>Davidson's final years as archbishop were preoccupied with the unfinished business of the royal commission of 1904. Letters of business had been issued to the convocations in 1906 requiring them to report on the desirability of changes in the law relating to the conduct of worship. These proposals were brought before the crown and the newly created church assembly in 1920. Immense interest was generated by the variety of proposals put forward for consideration. In 1925 Davidson reported that he had received 800 memorials on the subject. In June 1927 the church assembly voted to authorize the permissive use of a revised prayer book, alongside the prayer book of 1662. Controversy centred on the reserved sacrament, which been introduced into many parishes during the war, and on the alternative order for holy communion. Critics of the revision were not convinced by Davidson's judgement that the changes were only differences of emphasis and not of doctrine. Nor did he reassure those feared that the revisions would not be enforced by the bishops as the only permissible alterations. On 15 December 1927 the House of Commons, swayed by the cry of &#145;No Popery&#146;, rejected the measure by thirty-three votes. Davidson commented that the arguments against were &#145;of the sort which are to be found in <span class="italic">Barnaby Rudge</span>&#146;  (Bell, 3rd edn, 1346).<br>
<br>The archbishop and bishops decided to reintroduce the measure with minor modifications to meet protestant objections. Reservation was now rigorously limited to times and places of special need, but the new measure carried even less support in both church and Commons, and on 14 June 1928 was once again defeated.<h2>
<a name="Retirement"></a>Retirement</h2>Davidson resigned on 12 November 1928, his golden wedding anniversary, and two days later he was created Baron Davidson of Lambeth. His resignation was not a consequence of the defeat of his policy on the prayer book, to which he had not been vitally committed, but to enable his successor to prepare for the Lambeth conference of 1930. He died at his home, 10 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, London, on 25 May 1930, and was buried on 30 May in the cloister of Canterbury Cathedral.<br>
<br>As archbishop of Canterbury for longer than anyone since the Reformation, Randall Davidson presided over the denominationalization of the Church of England. Dependent for his own advancement on the patronage of royalty and family friends, he pushed forward the professionalization of the clergy and transformed Lambeth Palace and Church House into the bureaucratic centres of a world communion. Archbishop William Temple, who regarded himself as a surrogate son, formed the view that he was &#145;not in the least mystical&#146; and was unlikely ever to have spent much time in private prayer, but he was regular, direct, and sincere in his religious observances. Temple also commented that Davidson's &#145;power of work was astonishing&#146;. Information was processed by him at amazing speed, and filed in the memory for recall at will. Temple always remembered watching him work through the report of a royal commission for a Lords debate. &#145;He turned over the pages with a steady, slow swing, giving to each about the time required for reading aloud two sentences of average length.&#146;<br>
<br>Davidson's achievement was to maintain the comprehensiveness of the Church of England and to ensure liberty of thought. He maintained a Christian vision in British society at a time when international and class conflict could have obliterated institutional religion. Yet in 1927, the year after his intervention in the general strike, the figures for Easter communion were higher than they have ever been, before or since. Before the First World War, Davidson was regularly invited to comment on national political matters by national leaders, but afterwards ecclesiastical business left little time, and the rise of the Labour Party gave him fewer opportunities. Davidson's great skill was as a chairman, where he usually managed to secure unanimity. He was a naturally cautious man, inclined to worry; it was once said of him that &#145;he saw the shadows of tigers behind all the bushes in the jungle&#146;. Again it was said that he elevated expediency into a principle. For nearly fifty years he exercised more influence in Anglican affairs than anyone else.<br>
