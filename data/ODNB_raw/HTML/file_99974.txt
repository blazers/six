<span class="headword">Kerr,  David Allan</span>  (1945&#150;2008), <span class="occ">theologian and scholar of Islam</span>, was born at Poplar Hospital, London, on 16 May 1945, the son of Wilfred Allan Kerr (1915&#150;1991), a Congregationalist minister who cultivated an interest in international development, and his wife, Agap&eacute; Jean, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maclachlan, who was from a Scottish missionary family with a history of service in China. The background of his parents combined with the cosmopolitan character of London where he grew up sparked Kerr's interest in the world beyond the British Isles just as immigration was diversifying Britain's demographics and the rise of America and the Soviet Union was reducing Britain's global influence.<br>
<br>Kerr attended Mill Hill School, a boarding institution that had historically catered to families with nonconformist backgrounds. At Mill Hill the suggestions of a teacher, augmented by his own curiosity and a touch of whim, led him to study Arabic at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. This decision would prove pivotal. At the School of Oriental and African Studies (from 1963 to 1966) reading as well as friendships with Muslim fellow students propelled him on a quest to comprehend the implications of Islam's existence for the Christian. One book in particular unsettled his confidence in both Christianity and &#145;Western&#146; culture, posing problems he would spend the rest of his life addressing: <span class="italic">Islam and the West</span> (1960), by Norman Daniel, a Roman Catholic scholar committed to exposing the medieval Christian origins of Europe's false image of Islam. Another book, <span class="italic">The Arab Awakening</span> (1938) by George Antonius, an Arab Christian, deflated Kerr's erstwhile pride in Britain's imperial history. These works left Kerr deeply troubled by the polemical strategies of past Christian outreach as well as the self-interested nature of imperial politics.<br>
<br>In the wake of this personal intellectual awakening, Kerr left London to read theology at Mansfield College, Oxford, with the aim of ordination but with burning questions in his mind about Christian&#150;Muslim relations. At Oxford (from 1966 to 1968) he came under the influence of two very different figures who would push him to broaden his inherited Calvinist outlook in different ways. From the revered Congregationalist biblical scholar G. B. Caird he learned to exercise caution against reading contemporary inter-faith concerns into the ancient historical world of the biblical text. Biblical exegesis alone, in the absence of serious theological and philosophical reflection, would not suffice. From the daunting and difficult Roman Catholic scholar of &#145;Eastern&#146; religions R. C. Zaehner, Kerr discovered the mystical traditions of Christianity and Islam and came to appreciate their common interest in transcendence. Zaehner's singular pedagogical style also provided him with ample practice in the art of holding one's liquor amid exhausting and occasionally disturbing intellectual debate&#151;a lesson Kerr was only too happy to forget.<br>
<br>While Kerr did not pursue formal theological or biblical studies any further after 1968, he did remain convinced that theological thinking was fundamental to every other intellectual pursuit. He took this conviction with him to St Antony's College, Oxford, where he had earned a scholarship to pursue research for a DPhil in oriental studies. At St Antony's he found an ideal supervisor in the person of Albert Hourani. Like Kerr, Hourani was an Old Millhillian who had grown up in a reformed, nonconformist household. Hourani also maintained a lively personal interest in both the theological and historical dimensions of Christian&#150;Muslim relations. Under Hourani's guidance, Kerr explored church&#150;state relations in twentieth-century Lebanon. The genuine interest in Arab Christianity Kerr cultivated during this period made him more sensitive than the majority of his peers to the important contributions &#145;non-Western&#146; Christians could make to their &#145;Western&#146; brethren on a number of issues, not least the challenge of Islam. In 1970 Kerr married Gun-Marianne Holmstrom, a Finnish nurse whom he had first met at his father's church in London. They had two children, Simeon and Anna.<br>
<br>After finishing his DPhil thesis Kerr worked briefly for the BBC World Service, focusing on Arab issues. During this time he encountered the theological reflections of the bishop of Mount Lebanon, George Khodr, whose view of the Trinity would prove foundational for Kerr's approach to Islam over the next thirty years. Since Kerr, like Khodr, came to believe that the Holy Spirit worked outside the historic Christian church in religions such as Islam, he was more open to acknowledging the efficacy of Muslim faith than those Christians who built their theology on a Christological rather than a pneumatological base.<br>
<br>In 1973 Kerr succeeded John B. Taylor as lecturer in Islamic studies at the Selly Oak Colleges in Birmingham. In 1976 he founded the Centre for the Study of Islam and Christian&#150;Muslim Relations there. The new centre, under Kerr's direction until 1988, distinguished itself early on for its unique emphasis on &#145;study-in-dialogue&#146; and its pioneering concern for the growing importance of Islam in Britain and Europe. Also in 1976 Kerr co-drafted the influential Chambesy statement on &#145;Christian mission and Islamic da'wah&#146;. This pattern of activities would mark the rest of his career as he became more an accomplished teacher, administrator, institution builder, and practitioner than a scholar.<br>
<br>With his success at Selly Oak, Kerr became a sought-after scholar&#150;administrator, enjoying productive stints from 1988 to 1996 at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut (as director of the Duncan Black Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian&#150;Muslim Relations and editor of the Hartford journal, <span class="italic">Muslim World</span>) and from 1996 to 2005 at the University of Edinburgh (where he was professor of world Christianity and director of the Centre for the Study of Christianity in the Non-Western World). His last appointment, a chair in missiology at Lund University in Sweden, recognized his unique grasp of the global dimensions of the Christian&#150;Muslim encounter and his contributions to the redefinition of Christian mission.<br>
<br>In the wake of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 Kerr remained a determined advocate of peaceful dialogue between Christianity and Islam and did not mince words when fellow Christians or the British government seemed to threaten this endeavour. While at Edinburgh he was invited to a meeting with the prime minister, Tony Blair, to advise on fostering inter-faith relations, but, according to his son, &#145;left convinced that the government's interest did not extend beyond PR&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 23 June 2008). Soon after arriving in Sweden, he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, which progressed rapidly. A person of extraordinary commitment, he supervised and mentored his PhD students into his last days. He died on 14 April 2008 and was survived by his wife, Gun-Marianne, and their two children.<br>
