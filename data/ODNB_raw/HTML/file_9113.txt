<span class="headword">Falconer,  Randle Wilbraham</span>  (1816&#150;1881), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the fourth son of the classical scholar the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9115/', "Revd Thomas Falconer MD (1771&#150;1839)")</script> and his wife, Frances, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Raitt, was for many years one of the leading physicians of Bath. His grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9118/', "William Falconer MD (1744&#150;1824)")</script> and his father had also practised there, the latter offering medical assistance to the poor while acting as a clergyman. Randle Wilbraham Falconer began to study medicine at Edinburgh University in 1835, and graduated MD in 1839. Initially he settled at Tenby in Wales, and in 1842 married Maria, daughter of John Wood of Carmarthenshire. She died in 1847, and the same year he moved to Bath, where he lived and practised until his death. In 1850 he married Sophia Harriet Frances, the younger daughter of Major-General Howard-Vyse, formerly MP for Beverley and Honiton.<br>
<br>In addition to his Edinburgh doctorate, Falconer became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1866, and held the honorary title of doctor from the Queen's University, Ireland, and that of fellow from the King and Queen's College, Dublin. He was also a fellow of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of London and president of the Bath and Bristol section of the British Medical Association in 1864&#150;5. He was physician to the Institute for Idiot Children, Bath, and physician to the Bath General or Mineral Water Hospital between 1856 and 1881. He investigated the curative virtues of the spa, and produced several works on this subject. In <span class="italic">The Baths and Mineral Waters of Bath</span>, which was first published in 1857 and which reached a fifth edition in 1871, he argued that although drinking from the springs could have unpleasant side effects, they could &#145;accelerate the pulse, increase temperature of the body, and excite the secretions&#146;&#151;frequently more rapidly and permanently &#145;than might at first be anticipated&#146;  (R. W. Falconer, <span class="italic">Baths and Mineral Waters of Bath</span>, 1857, 39). His study of patients with rheumatism, sciatica, gouts, and related conditions, which appeared in 1861, was praised by <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> for being &#145;free from the pretensions and quackery that too often disgrace the literature of mineral waters&#146;.<br>
<br>Falconer had a wide range of interests, and was fond of archaeology and botany. Much esteemed by his fellow citizens, he was also elected mayor of Bath on two occasions, served as a respected magistrate, and supported a number of civic initiatives including the successful Bath city lectures; other schemes, for a public abattoir and a public library, were less successful. After his death at his home, 22 Bennett Street, Bath, on 6 May 1881, he was celebrated by the local historian Jerom Murch as a man who, having made the world a better place, would not be quickly forgotten in Bath. Falconer was survived by his second wife.<br>
