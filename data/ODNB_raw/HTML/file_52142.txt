<span class="headword">Millington,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1636&#150;1703), <span class="occ">auctioneer and bookseller</span>, was born about 1636 (assuming that he was near the average age of completion at the end of his apprenticeship), the son of Edward Millington, a yeoman from Nottingham. His mother's name is unknown. Millington was apprenticed to John Sherly, a London haberdasher; he completed his apprenticeship and was granted the freedom of the Haberdashers' Company on 28 June 1661 and became a citizen of London not long thereafter. Although free of the Haberdashers' Company, Millington like many other haberdashers quickly took on the trade of bookselling, very likely to the chagrin of the established Stationers' Company. He set up his first print shop at the Pelican on Duck Lane in Little Britain, and published John Wagstaffe's <span class="italic">Question of Witchcraft Debated</span> (1669). Millington continued publishing and selling new books at least until 1679, although by then he had already embarked on his new-found career as an auction impresario.<br>
<br>The first auction that definitely involved Millington was the major sale of the library of the Dutch theologian Gijsbert Voet (1589&#150;1676) at the White Hart in St Bartholomew Close, Little Britain, on 25 November 1678, although he probably began his auctioning career well before this event. For the Voet sale, Millington collaborated with substantial London booksellers such as Moses Pitt and others to import scholarly works from the continent in order to offer them for sale in England. Millington seems to have learned about the practice of selling used books by auction from some friends who had seen similar auctions held in the Netherlands. His book auctions were so successful that he soon expanded his sales repertoire into both the art and the fashion markets, as he began to organize auctions of pictures as well as of cravats, neckcloths, and other fashionable dress. Although Millington came relatively late to auctioning artworks, not beginning to do so until his sale at Tunbridge Wells on 13 August 1689, he soon became the most energetic and renowned art auctioneer of his day. In January 1692 he set up regular art auctions at a salesroom he dubbed the &#145;Vendu&#146; in Covent Garden. Millington's Vendu was perhaps the first established auction house in England independent of the outroper, an officer under the crown who nominally held a monopoly on all public sales by auction.<br>
<br>Out of the eighty-four recorded auctions in which he took part, Millington conducted fifty sales of books, as opposed to twenty-eight sales of artworks, the remaining sales being auctions of various miscellaneous goods such as estate sales or, on one occasion, &#145;several lean grass horses and mares, fit for many purposes&#146;  (<span class="italic">LondG</span>, 4 May 1699). It is not clear where Millington obtained the goods he offered for sale by auction. His book auctions seem to have been primarily secondhand sales, while his art auctions may well have been supplied by the growing London artistic community along with previously owned works imported from abroad.<br>
<br>Millington's innovative sales techniques and his successful development of the auction market could prompt jealousy from his competitors as well as attempts to restrict his business. The Stationers' Company often complained about the harm to their trade done by the rise of secondhand book auctions. The outroper also resented Millington's incursion into his market. On 10 December 1689 the outroper made a formal complaint to the court of aldermen &#145;against Mr. Millington for making publick sales of bookes [and] pictures&#146;  (court of aldermen repertories, 95, fol. 82b). It seems that Millington never responded to this complaint, however, nor did it impede his sales efforts. As soon as 17 January 1690 he was once again presiding over a new auction of art at the Barbadoes Coffee House in Cornhill  (<span class="italic">LondG</span>, 16 Jan 1690).<br>
<br>Millington travelled extensively to promote his auction sales. Although most were held in London (where, from 1695 until his death, he was based at St Bartholomew Close) he also conducted auctions in Cambridge, Tunbridge Wells, Norwich, Bury St Edmunds, Kings Lynn, Bath, Oxford, and Gloucester. He was a master of the fine art of flattery, and the prefaces to his sales catalogues frequently commend the judicious taste and learned erudition of his buyers. Dunton said of Millington that &#145;he had a quick wit, and a wonderful fluency of speech&#146;, and that &#145;there was usually as much comedy in his &#147;once, twice, thrice,&#148; as can be met with in a modern play&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Errors</span>, 1.235). Thomas Hearne was more critical: although Millington was &#145;certainly the best Auctioneer in the World, being a man of Great Wit and Fluency of Speech, &amp; a thorough Master of his trade&#146;, he was<blockquote>at the same time very impudent and saucy, yet he was a rascal, &amp; could not at the end of Auctions be brought to give an Account to the Persons that employ'd him, so that by that means he allow'd w[ha]t he pleased, &amp; no more, &amp; kept a great Number of Books that were not sold to himself. (<span class="italic">Remarks and Collections</span>, 8.115&#150;116)</blockquote>Millington's religious and political views are for the most part unknown, although it may be significant that he was one among the many thousands who signed the London &#145;monster petition&#146; in which the king was importuned to reconvene the prorogued parliament in January 1680 so that investigations of suspected popish plots might proceed. This petition was particularly popular among London radicals and dissenters, although there is no other evidence that Millington was either. Millington died on 27 September 1703 in Cambridge. Probate was granted on 29 November 1703 to his daughter Maria, wife of Thomas Searle. It is not known who her mother was, or whether she and Millington were married. Millington had the dubious honour of being immortalized in verse, along with other less well known wits, by the Grub Street poet Thomas Brown, in an elegy which strives to capture Millington's performance as an auctioneer.<br>
