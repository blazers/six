<span class="headword">Gray,  Christopher</span>  (1694&#150;1764), <span class="occ">nurseryman</span>, was probably the second son of William Gray senior, and his wife, Sarah, of Fulham, Middlesex. William Gray junior, the older son, had a nursery garden in Fulham, at Parson's Lane, later Peterborough Road; but the better-known Fulham garden of the period was the one established before 1700 by the elder William Gray and later taken over by Christopher. It occupied nearly 30 acres between Hurlingham Road and the (New) King's Road, with some land on the other side of the King's Road added by the middle of the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Early in his career, soon after the death in 1713 of Henry Compton, bishop of London, Christopher Gray was one of the nurserymen who bought plants from the bishop's collections in the gardens of Fulham Palace. These included many plants from North America, and their introduction may have prompted Gray to specialize in them. Gray was also one of the twenty nurserymen in the Society of Gardeners, which was led by Philip Miller and which met frequently in an attempt to standardize the names of the plants they were growing. The first part of their <span class="italic">Catalogus plantarum</span>, the only section published, appeared in 1730 as a joint catalogue of trees and shrubs, many of them recent introductions and several from North America.<br>
<br>In the preface to his <span class="italic">Hortus Britanno-Americanus</span> (written in 1749 but not published until 1763) Mark Catesby, the pioneer naturalist of the south-eastern states of America, said that<blockquote>Mr Gray at Fulham has for many years made it his business to raise and cultivate the plants of America (from whence he has annually fresh supplies) in order to furnish the curious with what they want &hellip; Through his industry and skill, a greater variety of American forest-trees and shrubs may be seen in his gardens, than in any other place in England. (Willson, 19)</blockquote>About 1737 Gray published a broadsheet catalogue in French and English, its alphabetical list of &#145;American Trees and Shrubs that will endure the Climate of England&#146; framing a <i>Magnolia grandiflora</i> which also appeared in the second volume of Catesby's <span class="italic">The Natural History of Carolina</span> (2 vols., 1729&#150;47); the engraving was after a drawing by G. D. Ehret of a magnolia in flower in the garden of Sir Charles Wager in Parson's Green in 1737. The one in Gray's own garden, planted before 1719, survived until 1810. Several American oaks, maples, dogwoods, walnuts, the tulip tree, the tupelo, the amelanchier, and other trees now established in Europe were also in this catalogue, along with the occasional less welcome import, such as poison ivy.<br>
<br>A later catalogue of 1755 listed more of Gray's stock, &#145;a greater Variety of Trees, Shrubs, Plants and Flowers &hellip; than can perhaps be found in any other Garden, for Sale, not only in England, but also in any other part of Europe&#146;  (Harvey, 79). One of Gray's customers was Horace Walpole of Strawberry Hill, who described some of his purchases from &#145;the nurseryman at Fulham&#146; in a letter of 8 November 1755 to George Montagu:<blockquote>I mention cedars [of Lebanon] first, because they are the most beautiful of the evergreen race, and because they are the dearest; half a guinea apiece in baskets &hellip; Gray &hellip; sells cypresses in pots at half a crown apiece; you turn them out of the pot with all their mould, and they never fail. (ibid., 79)</blockquote>Gray was buried in Fulham on 15 November 1764. His wife, Hannah, lived on until 24 February 1778. Most of his property was left to her in a will containing no mention of any children. The nursery was taken over by William Burchell, whose family kept the land until it was sold for building in 1882.<br>
