<span class="headword">Brockman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bunce]</span>,  Ann</span>, Lady Brockman  (<em>d.</em> 1660), <span class="occ">writer on medicine</span>, was the daughter of Simon Bunce of Linstead and Dorothy, daughter of William Grimsdiche. Her date of birth is unknown, as are details of her early life. She married Sir William Brockman of Newington, Kent, on 28 May 1616, and they had seven children. Her first son, Henry, died &#145;aged four years and eight months&#146; on 13 September 1622 (according to his sepulchre in Newington church). One other child (Helen) died young, but five survived into adulthood: Martha, Anne, James, Helen, and Margery. The loss of their first child evidently affected the parents most deeply, since he was the only one given a sepulchre in the local church. Sir William Brockman was lord of the manor of Beachborough, owning Cheriton manor as well.<br>
<br>In 1638 Ann Brockman began &#145;A book of receits&#146;. She titled, dated, and signed the frontispiece, and the book was evidently used as her household and estate medicine book. The handwriting is a clear italic, with later additions in different inks. Included among the recipes are ones for &#145;a thin coff&#146;, &#145;the coff of the lungs&#146;, &#145;an excellent water for the stock&#146;, &#145;a tetter or ring worm&#146;, &#145;the payne in the head&#146;, and &#145;the payne in the back&#146;  (fol. 3). Her index shows the range and kinds of diseases she treated, and some of the methods: aching backs, ague, &#145;bath, for any smelling&#146;, sore breasts, bruises, burns, conception, convulsions, dropsy, eyes, headache, impostumes, itch, hypochondria, measles, melancholy, mouth sores, palsy, piles, plague (a late entry), purging, rupture, plasters, pox, running sores, salve, scalds, sleep, spleen, stones, sweating, syrup of vinegar, tobacco salve, toothache, sore throat, water, worms, wounds. The breadth of ailments, from simple aches and pains to more severe illnesses such as plague, suggests that she may have been treating a large household and its surrounding villagers. The recipes do not suggest the need for a physician&#151;although her recipe for a purgation is &#145;of Doctor Merton&#146;  (fol. 3)&#151;but they show that she provided traditional herbal recipes and treatment.<br>
<br>During the civil war Brockman's husband fought on the king's side, and was imprisoned twice: once in 1642, and again in 1648 after he was captured for his key role at the siege of Maidstone. On both occasions Ann Brockman petitioned for his release, personally writing the first petition on 7 February 1643 but merely signing that of 1648. In 1643 she says she is worried about &#145;the preservation of his health, which I fear may be in some danger through the multitude of prisoners committed lately to that place&#146;  (Brockman, &#145;The humble petition&#146;, fol. 4), while in 1648 the writer of the petition says that it is her health that is suffering. Active petitioning of committees for prisoners was commonly performed by wives of imprisoned cavaliers during the civil war, but Ann's words illustrate her personal love and concern for her husband and her sense of responsibility in his absence. Her husband's letters on taxation and the provision of militia during the civil war occasionally refer to her knowledge of their estate, suggesting her role as partner with him in managing it.<br>
<br>During her husband's lifetime Brockman had some personal control of land and money: a bond of &pound;100 to her is included in the Drake-Brockman papers in the British Library. After her husband's death in 1654, their son James inherited his lands and title. However, Ann continued to manage some lands and money as her dower, which James paid from the estate until her death in 1660. In the years between 1656 and 1660 she received about &pound;130 annually for &#145;her lady days rent&#146;, and a similar amount at Michaelmas, some from &#145;her 5 acres of meadow&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 45206, fol. 5). Ann Brockman died on 29 November 1660 and is buried at Newington church. Given that she married in 1616, she must have been at least sixty.<br>
