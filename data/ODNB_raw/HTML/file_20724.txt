<span class="headword">Oliver,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1552), <span class="occ">civil lawyer</span>, was sometimes called &#145;Oliver alias Smith&#146;. His birth date, family, and early education are unknown, but he took the Oxford degrees of BCL on 30 June 1516, BCnL on 23 June 1522, and DCL on 11 October 1522. He probably began his collection of ecclesiastical benefices with the prebend of Norton, Herefordshire, in 1512: some benefices were brief staging posts, but he was vicar of Ross in Herefordshire (1520&#150;49), rector of Pembridge in Herefordshire (1527&#150;51), vicar of Minster in Kent (1528&#150;46), and prebendary of Teynton Regis in Salisbury diocese from 1531 until his death. On 22 April 1533 he was appointed dean of King Henry VIII College in Oxford, but on 20 May 1545 he signed the surrender of the college prior to its refoundation as Christ Church, in return for a pension of &pound;70 per annum. He was sometimes referred to as a clerk or chaplain, but he seems never to have been ordained priest: from 1536 he was given a series of three-year dispensations to hold benefices in plurality without taking holy orders.<br>
<br>Oliver was a busy civil lawyer: a member of Doctors' Commons from 1522, master in chancery by February 1532, and a judge-delegate in the admiralty court by 1539. He was often employed on official business. He served as one of Wolsey's commissaries (1527&#150;9), as collector of the clerical subsidy for the province of York in 1531, and as one of Henry VIII's proctors in the Aragon divorce suit (1531&#150;3). In 1533&#150;5 he sat with other senior lawyers on an informal committee advising the king and Thomas Cromwell on the break with Rome and the relationship between canon and common law. He seems not to have been used on sensitive business between 1535 and 1540, which suggests that Cromwell may have disapproved of him. In 1540 he was involved in the annulment of the king's marriage to Anne of Cleves, and thereafter was commissioned to deal with a number of lesser marriage disputes; on 21 January 1543 he was elected prolocutor of the lower house of the Canterbury convocation, and in 1543 he took part in various heresy investigations relating to the prebendaries' plot against Archbishop Cranmer. As a master in chancery he was appointed to commissions to determine cases while the chancellor was ill or otherwise occupied in October 1544, February 1547, August 1548, October 1551, and January 1552.<br>
<br>Oliver seems to have been favoured by Richard, Lord Rich, chancellor from 1547 to 1551, and he sat on a number of major legal commissions: early in 1550 he was one of those who heard Bishop Bonner's appeal against deprivation, on 18 January 1551 he was appointed to a commission against heresy, and on 27 September 1551 he was named on the commission to hear the charges against bishops Day and Heath. On 12 December 1550 he was put on the commission which tried and deprived Bishop Gardiner; he was the most assiduous of the judges, missing only one out of twenty-two sessions and sitting alone on three occasions. On 20 May 1551 Oliver was appointed to serve with the marquess of Northampton on a special embassy to France to conclude an alliance and seek a royal wife for Edward VI; he brought back some gilt standing cups as souvenirs, and in his will bequeathed one of them to Lord Chancellor Goodrich.<br>
<br>Oliver died in London in 1552; he had made his will on 27 May, and it was proved on 3 July. It was the testament of a prosperous, bachelor lawyer with mildly conservative views. He made bequests to the inmates of all the London prisons and the Bedlam (Bethlem) Hospital, to the widows and orphans of the parishes where he had been incumbent longest, to his poor neighbours in Westminster, to his godchildren, to various servants and tradesmen, and to the politicians and lawyers with whom he had worked: three chancellors, the chief justice of common pleas, a justice of king's bench, and half a dozen civil lawyers. He charged his executors &#145;in the way of charity, to do for me therein as they would be done for themselves afore Almighty God in that behalf&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/35, fol. 129<i>v</i>), which probably means he expected them to seek prayers for his soul. Oliver was a minor agent of the Reformation in England, but it looks as if he did not like it.<br>
