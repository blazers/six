<span class="headword">O'Flaherty,  Roderic <span class="st"> [Roger; </span></span> <span class="st"> Ruaidhr&iacute; &Oacute;g &Oacute; Flaithbheartaigh]</span>  (1627<span class="mult">x</span>30&#150;1716<span class="mult">x</span>18), <span class="occ">historiographer</span>, was probably born at Moycullen Castle on the western shore of Lough Corrib, co. Galway, the only son among the five children of Aodh mac Ruaidhr&iacute;gh (<i>d</i>. 1631), chief of one of the principal O'Flaherty septs, and Elizabeth Darcy (<i>d</i>. 1636), an offspring of one of the &#145;tribes&#146; of Galway. When his mother died he was made a ward of the crown. Despite a good deal of (frequently confused) speculation on the subject, virtually nothing is known of his early years and education. Given his later friendship with them, however, it seems likely that O'Flaherty had close contact with Archdeacon John Lynch and Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh before those scholars left Galway as the city succumbed to the Cromwellian onslaught in the early 1650s.<br>
<br>O'Flaherty married a daughter of Colonel Murchadh na dTuagh O'Flaherty in 1652 and in the following year obtained a decree&#151;on the grounds of &#145;innocency&#146;&#151;from the Athlone and Loughrea commissioners of delinquency of &#145;a considerable portion&#146; of his hereditary estate, but the heavy contributions levied by the Cromwellian regime virtually nullified this partial reversal of the confiscation of his lands. Although in 1677 he obtained by legal proceedings a further small part of the estate of which he had been dispossessed (a mere 500 acres of poor land), he became increasingly impoverished throughout the remainder of his long life.<br>
<br>In September 1665 O'Flaherty wrote the learned &#145;Letter on the chronology of Irish history&#146; to the exiled John Lynch; his place of writing, &#145;Armorica Galviensi&#146;, indicates that he was already residing in Cois Fhairrge&#151;perhaps at Park, near Spiddal, where he was to end his days. The letter, which was published twenty years later, suggests that he and Lynch had been engaged in a lengthy correspondence on the subject of Irish chronology. The next extant item of his to which a definite date can be assigned was written in 1682; in this, a brief communication to one Robert Downing, he rebuts allegations by Dr Edmund Borlase about the number of protestant settlers said to have been massacred at the outbreak of the Ulster rising of 1641. One of O'Flaherty's most celebrated works is his &#145;Description of Iar Connacht&#146;, written early in 1684 when William Molyneux of Dublin was collecting materials relating to Ireland for a work entitled &#145;The English atlas&#146; being planned (though not ultimately effected) by the London bookseller Moses Pitt. In the event O'Flaherty's &#145;Description&#146; did not appear in print until James Hardiman issued an annotated edition in 1846.<br>
<br>The year 1685 saw the publication of O'Flaherty's <i>magnum opus</i>, a substantial book in Latin entitled <span class="italic">Ogygia, seu, Rerum Hibernicarum chronologia</span>, on which the author had clearly been working since the 1660s at least. Characterized as &#145;a learned treatise, compiled from manuscript sources &hellip; a substantial and significant book &hellip; patently the work of a learned man&#146; and &#145;the first scholarly presentation of Irish history to the English public&#146;, the work was dedicated to James, duke of York, who by the time the book appeared had succeeded to the throne as James II. Its publication drew a sharp retort from the Scottish controversialist Sir George Mackenzie and to this O'Flaherty penned a reply (in English); entitled <span class="italic">Ogygia Vindicated Against the Objections of Sir George Mackenzie</span>, this work did not appear in print until 1775. Another work, entitled &#145;Ogygia Christiana: annals of the Christian ages to the dissolution of the Irish monarchy&#146;, survived in manuscript into the nineteenth century but is now lost. O'Flaherty saw one other work of his in print during his lifetime. This was a Latin poem celebrating the birth in June 1688 of James II's son, later known as the Pretender.<br>
<br>O'Flaherty's contribution to William Molyneux's abortive project led to a lasting friendship, and a lengthy correspondence, between the two. Shortly after Molyneux's untimely death in 1698, O'Flaherty came into contact with the Welsh antiquary and collector of manuscripts Edward Lhuyd. Some thirty letters written by O'Flaherty to Lhuyd between 1702 and 1708 still survive. Lhuyd, in correspondence with others, alludes to the Irish scholar's impoverished state; already, in 1696&#150;7, he had spent time in Galway gaol, presumably for an undischarged debt. O'Flaherty refers poignantly to his situation as &#145;a banished man within the bounds of my native soil; a spectator of others enriched by my birth-right&#146;. A celebrated description of him by Samuel Molyneux (son of his old friend William), who visited him in 1709, states that he:<blockquote>lives very old, in a miserable condition at Park &hellip; his ill-fortune has stripped him of [his old Irish manuscripts] as well as his other goods, so that he has nothing now left but some few pieces of his own writing, and a few old rummish books of history, printed. (A. Smith, &#145;A journey to Connaught&#151;April, 1709&#146;, <span class="italic">Miscellany of the Irish Archaeological Society</span>, 1846, 171)</blockquote>O'Flaherty also left extensive, and often valuable, annotation in several Irish manuscripts which passed through his hands. Among the most notable of these are Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh's autograph copy of the <span class="roman">Chronicum Scotorum</span>, and one of the autograph volumes of the annals of the four masters (TCD).<br>
<br>In his declining years O'Flaherty was embarrassed by the activities of his son-in-law Edward Tyrrell, who gained notoriety as a priest-hunter and was executed in 1713 on a charge of bigamy. A tradition that his son, Michael, &#145;was a fool&#146; seems at odds with the fact that the latter engaged in a lengthy and ultimately successful lawsuit to recover some of his ancestral lands from Richard Martin, esquire, who had retained them following the proceedings of 1677 in which O'Flaherty had some of his estate restored. The younger O'Flaherty's &#145;plaint&#146; of February 1717, as part of the lawsuit, refers to himself as being the son and heir of &#145;Roger Flaherty, late of Parke&#146;&#151;which seems to suggest that his father was dead by that date. On the other hand, Walter Harris, writing in 1746, declared that O'Flaherty died on 8 April 1718, in his eighty-ninth year.<br>
<br>Roderic O'Flaherty features prominently in local west Galway folklore down to modern times. While some of the tales relating to him are rather far-fetched, one that was recorded more than a century and a half ago may contain more than a grain of truth. This is to the effect that his son, Michael, buried the venerable scholar under the floor of his own house at Park, as a means of strengthening his hold on the ancestral estate.<br>
