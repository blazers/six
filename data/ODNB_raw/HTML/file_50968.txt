<span class="headword">Witts,  Francis Edward</span>  (1783&#150;1854), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and diarist</span>, was born on 26 February 1783, at George Inn Yard, Cheltenham, the eldest son of Edward Witts (1746&#150;1816), gentleman and high sheriff of Oxfordshire, and Agnes Tracy Travell (1748&#150;1825). He attended Elmore School, near Gloucester, until 1795, when his parents moved to Edinburgh, where the boy attended the high school.<br>
<br>Between 1798 to 1800 the family spent their winters at the court of the grand duke of Saxe-Weimar, where Witts attended a school kept by M. Mounier for foreign students. Witts visited the theatre, where he enjoyed &#145;the noble dramas of Schiller&#146;  (Witts, diary, 28 June 1828), attended concerts&#151;mostly of music by Mozart&#151;and started his diary. After returning to England he matriculated in 1802 at Wadham College, Oxford, obtaining his BA in 1805 and his MA in 1809. Missing Weimar, he led a rather solitary life: he wrote in his diary on 31 October 1803, &#145;Kept aloof from the Herd and dined alone&#146;.<br>
<br>Destined for the church, Witts was groomed to succeed his uncle, the Revd Ferdinando Tracy Travell, rector of Upper Slaughter, Gloucestershire. He was ordained deacon in 1806 and priest in 1807, both at the Chapel Royal, St James's. From 1806 to 1808 he was curate of Urchfont and Stert, Wiltshire; he was rector of Upper Slaughter, Gloucestershire, from 1808 until his death, and was also vicar of Stanway, Gloucestershire, from 1814 to 1854. On 30 May 1808 he married Margaret Backhouse (1786&#150;1850)&#151;&#145;a virtuous, loving wife&#146;, he wrote sadly in his diary after her death in 1850  (Witts, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 174). Their only child, Edward Francis Witts (1813&#150;1886), succeeded Witts as rector of Upper Slaughter, and Edward's son, Broome Witts, in turn succeeded his father.<br>
<br>Witts was squire of Upper Slaughter as well as its parson. He became a long-serving justice of the peace, and in 1852 was appointed deputy lieutenant of Gloucestershire. &#145;Country squires, well qualified and permanently resident are few in this district&#146;, he noted dryly  (Witts, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 181). His diary exhibits his full participation in local social and cultural life. Witts enjoyed dining out, and travelled in all weathers and by every means of conveyance&#151;horse, phaeton, carriage, stagecoach, and steam train. He recorded new roads, buildings, and the spread of towns. Witts and his son both became keen botanists and conservationists, and he also helped organize the musical life of Cheltenham and Gloucester, attending many concerts. Quietly religious, Witts disapproved of hunting parsons and was generous to his parishioners. He records that he relied upon &#145;three checks to the frailty of our nature; self-examination, prayer and professional study&#146;  (Witts, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 13). At the end of the day he liked to read some Shakespeare and then write up his diary. Witts died on 18 August 1854, and was buried in St Peter's Church, Upper Slaughter, on 25 August.<br>
<br>A selection from his diary, edited by David Verey and published in 1978, shows &#145;a spectrum of Witts' social life&#146;, sketching the Cotswold parson who chronicled the changing landscape and steady expansion of Gloucester and Gloucestershire. The entire diary (there is a missing section, 1808&#150;20) gives a fuller picture of the rector, presenting his acute comments on life, politics, and people.<br>
