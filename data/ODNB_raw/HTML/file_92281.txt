<span class="headword">Worsley,  Jack Reginald</span>  (1923&#150;2003), <span class="occ">acupuncturist</span>, was born on 14 September 1923 at 45 Colchester Street, Coventry, the youngest of four children of Harry Worsley, a tool maker in the engineering trade, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hockton. His first foray into the healing arts began at the age of eleven when he joined the St John's Ambulance Corps and became certified in first aid. He left school at the age of fourteen to begin working at the Standard motor car factory in Coventry, using his earnings to help support his family. In late 1940 he spent his days building bombers for the Royal Air Force and his evenings at a first aid post assisting injured soldiers. As the Second World War progressed, he joined the British army, soon attaining the rank of sergeant, responsible for the training of new recruits. He later became a warrant officer and was transferred to the Royal Army Education Corps. At his discharge in 1947 he received a commendation for his work as education officer in charge of the northwest command. On 19 July 1945 he had married his 21-year-old sweetheart, Elsie Buckland, whom he had known since the age of sixteen. She was the daughter of Owen Buckland, showman, and at the time of their marriage was living in Kenilworth. They had a daughter, Hilary, and a son, John.<br>
<br>After demobilization Worsley returned to the Standard factory while using his evenings to pursue studies in physiotherapy and continue his study of naturopathy and osteopathic medicine. During the war he had met a man who had suffered from severe arthritis and had been completely cured as a result of receiving acupuncture in Hong Kong. Worsley was motivated to learn this art. At the time it was not possible to receive professional qualifications in Chinese acupuncture in England. Thus he began extensive travels to the Far East, serving as an apprentice to two masters, Hsui and Ono. In time they bestowed the rare and honoured title of &#145;master&#146; upon him.<br>
<br>During the mid- and late 1950s Worsley maintained a busy practice and also found time to treat and work with Coventry City Football Club. Continuing his studies in the East, he earned a doctorate in acupuncture from the College of Chinese Medicine in 1960. In the same year, he founded the College of Traditional Acupuncture (UK), the first school of acupuncture in England. In the late 1960s and early 1970s he continued to travel to the East to expand his knowledge of classical acupuncture, appeared on television, taught, and lectured extensively throughout Europe and the United States. In 1974 he founded and was president of the Traditional Acupuncture Institute, the first school of acupuncture in the United States. In 1978 Lord Hume dedicated the new premises of the College of Traditional Acupuncture at Leamington Spa.<br>
<br>In 1984, after nearly forty years together, Worsley's wife, Elsie, died. In the following years, he continued to travel extensively, teaching and consulting with patients of his students in both the UK and America. On his travels Judith Elaine (Judy) Becker (<i>b</i>. 1947), one of his first American students, accompanied him. She was the daughter of Melvin Louis Becker, oral surgeon. In 1988 Worsley and Becker jointly founded the Worsley Institute of Classical Acupuncture in Miami, Florida. On 3 August 1991 they married, and the following year they moved to Church Hill Farm, a sixteenth-century farmhouse in Burton Dassett, Warwickshire, which they remodelled extensively, and which Worsley adored. Worsley (known both professionally and to friends as J. R.) published extensively on acupuncture in books and journals, and received many honours and honorary professorships.<br>
<br>In 1996 Worsley suffered a massive heart attack, requiring major surgery. His recovery was both extraordinary and transformational. Though he was not expected to survive, he began painting, continued teaching, and, in his words, &#145;learned to live from the heart&#146;  (private information). He decided, after recuperating, to focus his teaching on a selected group of students who were truly committed to learning the system of medicine he brought to the Western world&#151;formal apprentices. Thus the first master apprentice programme was founded in 1997. Members of this first group founded the Worsley Institute of Classical Five-Element Acupuncture, a not-for-profit organization to protect the integrity of this lineage and to make Worsley's work available to all interested patients, practitioners, and schools. In 2002 popular demand from his students influenced Worsley to begin a second master apprentice class. In May 2003 Worsley was diagnosed with pneumonia and severe heart failure. Hospitalized in Miami, he continued to see patients from his hospital room and, with his beloved wife, Judy, and sustained by the love of family, friends, and his many grateful students, continued to oversee many Worsley Institute projects virtually until his death. He died in Miami in the early hours of 2 June 2003, and was survived by his wife and the two children of his first marriage, both of whom had trained and practised as acupuncturists. He was cremated on 26 June. After his death the master apprentice classes continued under the direction of his widow, his designated successor as &#145;master of the lineage&#146;.<br>
