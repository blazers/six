<span class="headword">Twyn,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1619, <em>d.</em> 1664), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was the eldest child of Robert Twyn, a yeoman of Kelshall, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Jane Warren. He was baptized at Kelshall on 14 March 1619. He was bound as an apprentice on 24 August 1633 to the London printer William Stansby and he took up his freedom in the trade on 7 September 1640. Little is known of Twyn's personal circumstances, except that he was by 1662 widowed and caring for his four small children. He was also a nonconformist of unknown hue, refusing the sacrament before he was executed as he was against the forms of the Church of England.<br>
<br>In 1647 Twyn became manager of the king's printing house in Edinburgh following its acquisition by the Stationers' Company. He was still resident in Scotland in 1650 but he had returned by 1658 to London, where he had premises in Cloth Fair. During his career he entered only one work in the Stationers' register, <span class="italic">The Three Books of Hermas</span> in 1661, although he was also involved in printing editions of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, Hooker's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Polity</span>, and John Chishull's <span class="italic">The Danger of being Almost a Christian</span>.<br>
<br>Twyn was briefly imprisoned and he had a press seized in the early years of the Restoration. In seeking his release he pledged never to print anything against the king, but early on 7 October 1663 his premises were entered by Roger L'Estrange, Charles II's recently appointed surveyor of the press, who discovered printed sheets of <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Execution of Justice</span>, which asserted the godly duty of the people to oust the &#145;Bloody and Oppressing&#146; house of Stuart  (<span class="italic">Treatise</span>, 15). Twyn's trial for high treason began at the Old Bailey on 20 February 1664, accompanied by the prosecution for seditious libel of bookseller Thomas Brewster, printer Simon Dover, and bookbinder Nathan Brooks for the <span class="italic">Speeches and Prayers</span> of the regicides and, in Brewster's case, for <span class="italic">A Phenix, or, The Solemn League and Covenant</span>: the three men tried for libel were pilloried and fined.<br>
<br>The trial judge, Sir Robert Hyde, said the <span class="italic">Treatise of the Execution of Justice</span> was &#145;as High a Treason as can be Committed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Exact Narrative</span>, 31). The trial evidence and surviving pages of the seized tract  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/88/76) indicate that Twyn's version was substantially similar although not identical to the 32-page edition which subsequently circulated. The <span class="italic">Treatise</span> used scriptural injunction and Biblical precedent to assert the right and duty of the people to resist a magistrate who contravened the law of God by oppressing the innocent. Charles I had &#145;made poor England Groan&#146; by episcopal tyranny and illegal taxes, leading to bloody war. But now the people's war against &#145;Antichrist&#146;, to throw off the &#145;Yoak of this present Tyrant&#146;, was close at hand (<span class="italic">Treatise</span>, 15, 25&#150;32; TNA: PRO, SP 29/88/76). Twyn denied having known the content of the book but admitted that he had agreed to print 1000 copies for the publisher Giles Calvert because he needed money. He was said to have received 40<i>s</i>. in part-payment, having dispatched printed sheets to Calvert's wife, Elizabeth. However, L'Estrange, supported by other witnesses, insisted that Twyn had read the book and had declared it &#145;mettlesome stuffe, the man was a hot fiery man that wrote it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Exact Narrative</span>, 13). It was alleged that the publication of the <span class="italic">Treatise</span> was to have been the signal for a rising by waiting rebels on 12 October. Twyn declined to reveal the author of the anonymous work. He was found guilty by a jury that included the printers Richard Royston and Thomas Roycroft and he was sentenced by Hyde to be hanged, disembowelled, and quartered. Twyn was executed at Tyburn on 24 February; his head was displayed over Ludgate and his quarters over other city gates.<br>
