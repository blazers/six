<span class="headword">Thomas <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Hyndman]</span>,  Ethel Nancy Miles</span>  (1876&#150;1944), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 4 October 1876 at 18 Hartham Road, Islington, London, the daughter of David Miles Thomas, a tutor originally from Carmarthen, and his wife, Mary Emily Davies. She received her early education at home and at Mayo High School, London. In 1897 she became a student at University College, London, where she was prominent as president of the women students' union (and where later she was made a fellow). She also attended botany lectures at Imperial College. She began her research apprenticeship early as assistant (1897&#150;1901) to botanist Ethel Sargant. This experience, and work with Arthur Tansley at University College, awakened her lifelong interest in seedling anatomy and plant evolution. Her first papers appeared in 1900, five years before she received her BSc. She was the first in Britain to publish on the phenomenon of double fertilization in angiosperms (1900). Her hypothesis of the double leaf-trace  (<span class="italic">New Phytologist</span>, 1907), a notable contribution to phylogenetic theory, was founded on investigations of vascular structures in a wide range of seedling types, angiospermous and gymnospermous. She continued to publish intermittently until the mid-1920s, bringing out some twelve reports in scientific periodicals as well as more general articles. Her later work was directed towards a broad interpretation of seedling anatomy, a goal never fully realized.<br>
<br>Assistant lecturer at Bedford College from 1907, Thomas became head of the botany department in 1908 when it was established as a separate unit. She designed the botany garden at the Regent's Park site to which the college moved in 1913 and initiated planning for a plant physiology laboratory. Vigorous and enthusiastic about everything she undertook, she could occasionally arouse considerable antagonism. Hers was a complex personality; although ambitious, courageous, and warm-hearted, she was also impulsively outspoken and sometimes inflexible. As a teacher she set high standards and believed in letting students find their own feet. Growing antipathy between her and Bedford's principal, Margaret Tuke, led to her dismissal in 1916. The move upset the botany department, since she was by then a well-established scientist: a council member of the Linnean Society in 1910&#150;15 (a fellow from 1908), she had taken her DSc in 1915 and had been appointed reader in the University of London in 1912 in recognition of her department development work. She was also an examiner for the University of London.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Thomas carried out research for the War Office and the Medical Research Committee, while also serving as a Women's Land Army inspector. After a year (1918&#150;19) as acting head of the botany department at University College of South Wales and subsequently two years as keeper of the botany department in the National Museum of Wales, she joined the staff of recently established University College, Leicester. There, almost alone, she developed a biological sciences programme; her botany laboratory was the college's first laboratory. She remained head of the biology department until she reluctantly accepted retirement in 1937 at the age of sixty.<br>
<br>Life member of the British Association (vice president, section K (botany) 1933), Thomas attended meetings in Australia (1914), Canada (1924), and southern Africa (1929). She sat on the executive committee of the Imperial Botanical Conference (1924). A strong supporter of the women's movement, she took a particular interest in matters affecting professional status and especially women's research opportunities. For a time she was president of the Leicester branch of the British Federation of University Women.<br>
<br>Handsome and vivacious with dark, lively eyes, Ethel Thomas stood out at social gatherings: a reporter at a British Association meeting, after identifying her as one of the country's leading women botanists, added, clearly impressed, &#145;she dances like a moonbeam&#146;  (<span class="italic">Leicester Evening Mail</span>, 26 May 1933). In September 1933 she married Hugh Hyndman, a barrister, whose sudden death in 1934 was a severe blow. After retiring she continued professional activities from a research room in Westfield College (London). By 1940 she was in poor health and suffering from severe memory loss, but still lived alone, declining help. She died of heart failure at Brookwood Hospital, Knaphill, Woking, Surrey, on 28 August 1944, and was cremated at Woking four days later.<br>
