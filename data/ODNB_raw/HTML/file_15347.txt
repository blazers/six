<span class="headword">Kendall,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1485), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, may have been the son of John Kendall of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. July 1447) and Elizabeth, his wife; and if so he was the eldest son and was of age in 1447. The younger John Kendall received legal training, possibly studying at Barnard's Inn, and is described as an attorney in 1479. He made his career as secretary to Richard, duke of Gloucester, being first recorded in that capacity in a document dated 22 December 1474. As secretary he gradually increased his power and influence, becoming in 1482 clerk of returns of the writs in the castle and county of York, and in 1483 keeper of the writs and rolls of the common bench.<br>
<br>Kendall's influence increased after his master became king as <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23500/', "Richard III")</script>. As secretary he received his livery of 6 yards of scarlet at the coronation in 1483, and he accompanied the post-coronation progress. His many grants included his appointment in 1483 as controller, changer, and assayer of the mints in the Tower of London and at Calais for life, and keeper of the prince's wardrobe in the city of London. After the rebellions of that year he was given lands worth &pound;80 per annum from forfeitures in Berkshire and Oxfordshire. In December 1484 he was on the commission of the peace for Middlesex as secretary (together with a namesake &#145;of Westminster&#146;), and possibly on the commissions in December 1483 and April 1485. He may also have been on the commissions of the peace in the East Riding of Yorkshire in June and December 1483 and September 1484. By February 1485, in a grant of the office of master forester in the king's park of Havering atte Bower, Essex, he was being described as king's councillor and secretary, and he also became steward of the abbey of Waltham Holy Cross. In July 1485 he accompanied Richard III to Nottingham, and on 1 August was one of the witnesses in the chapel of the castle when the great seal was handed over to Richard by Thomas Barowe, keeper of the rolls. Kendall undoubtedly fought with the king on 22 August 1485 at Bosworth, and was probably killed there. He was attainted afterwards and his lands confiscated. He was certainly married, but it is not known to whom, and he probably had a son.<br>
<br>Another <a name="cosubject_15347"></a><span class="headword">John Kendall</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1476&#150;1486) was a <span class="occ">vicar-choral</span> at Southwell Minster, admitted on 16 March 1476. His parentage is not known. His career was inglorious (something he shared with several of his colleagues) and included fighting and taking women of bad character to his chantry. He resigned on 16 August 1486. Nothing further is known of him.<br>
