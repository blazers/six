<span class="headword">Sullivan,  John</span>  (1749&#150;1839), <span class="occ">East India Company servant and politician</span>, was born on 7 April 1749 in Cork, co. Cork, the second of three sons of Benjamin Sullivan (1720&#150;1767), clerk of the crown for the counties of Cork and Waterford, and Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1802), daughter of the Revd Paul Limric DD, of Scull, co. Cork. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26778/', "Richard Joseph Sullivan")</script> achieved note as a writer. Though of ancient Irish stock, Sullivan's family were members of the established church and supporters of the dominant protestant ascendancy.<br>
<br>After an early education in Ireland and England, Sullivan joined the East India Company at Madras as a writer in 1765, at the age of sixteen. This and later appointments came through the patronage of his powerful kinsman Laurence Sulivan, who was then deputy chairman of the company. Sullivan's progress through the company's merchant ranks was rapid and profitable at a time when British interests in south India were threatened by French forces and the military rulers of Mysore, Haidar Ali and his son Tipu Sultan. In 1774, as a junior merchant on the council of Masulipatam, Sullivan produced a study of local revenue systems entitled &#145;Observations respecting the Circar of Mazulipatam&#146;  (BL OIOC, Home Miscellaneous series, file 335 (1)) which established his claim for political service with the court of directors in London. The claim was recognized in 1781 with his appointment as resident at the court of Tanjore with responsibility for all the southern provinces of the Madras presidency. Sullivan's ambitious plan to subvert the threat from Mysore by a secret treaty with the deposed Hindu dynasty was pre-empted by an armistice with the French in 1783. In addition to his official duties at Tanjore, he acted privately to accumulate substantial profits from supplying grain to the Madras army: when he returned to England on leave in 1785 he had a considerable fortune, with which he purchased a country estate, Richings Lodge, near Iver, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>The key to Sullivan's future political success lay in his marriage on 23 May 1789 to Henrietta Anne Barbara (<i>bap</i>. 1762, <i>d</i>. 1828), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13390/', "George Hobart (1731&#150;1804)")</script> of Nocton and Blyborough, Lincolnshire, who in 1793 succeeded his half-brother as third earl of Buckinghamshire; Henrietta's twin sister, Maria (<i>bap</i>. 1762, <i>d</i>. 1794), married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20308/', "George Augustus North, later third earl of Guilford")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20304/', "North, Frederick, second earl of Guilford")</script>]. The couple had one son, John, before they were married and three further sons and five daughters. Through his marriage Sullivan was now closely linked to the fortunes of the Hobart family, who had their own considerable aspirations for power in India. Now resident in England, his role was to provide support at home for his brother-in-law Robert, Lord Hobart (later fourth earl of Buckinghamshire), who became governor of Madras in 1793 and sought the position of governor-general in India. William Pitt, the prime minister, recommended Sullivan, as a &#145;nabob of good fortune&#146; and &#145;good character&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons, 1790&#150;1820</span>), to Lord Camelford for the parliamentary seat of Old Sarum in 1790, and he held it until standing down to become high sheriff of Buckinghamshire in 1797. About 1791 he spoke in the Commons in support of the former governor-general of Bengal, Warren Hastings, urging that Hastings's trial be stopped in view of the defendant's merits; Sullivan was one of twenty-two guests invited by Hastings to a celebration dinner following his acquittal in 1795. He argued his brother-in-law's case for compensation when Hobart was prematurely withdrawn from the governorship of Madras in 1798, and in 1795 published a volume entitled <span class="italic">Tracts upon India: Written in the Years 1779, 1780, and 1788 with Subsequent Observations</span>, which established his own political credentials as a specialist in Indian affairs. In January 1799 he persuaded Henry Dundas, the president of the Board of Control, to support Lord Wellesley's campaign against Tipu Sultan in Mysore.<br>
<br>Reward for supporting Hobart came with Sullivan's return to parliament as the member for Aldburgh, and his appointment as under-secretary for war and the colonies from May 1801 to 1804, when his brother-in-law was secretary of state. Sullivan became a privy councillor in 1805 and, after a brief period as commissioner on the Board of Control for Indian affairs (February 1806 to April 1807), rejoined the board in April 1812 to serve Hobart, now earl of Buckinghamshire, who was the president. There followed a marked deterioration in the relationship between the East India Company and the board, as Buckinghamshire, for the government, tried to impose his authority over the court of directors. Surprisingly, Sullivan survived as a commissioner when George Canning succeeded to the presidency after Buckinghamshire's death in a riding accident in 1816. Once again, Sullivan's experience and advocacy were decisive in persuading the board to accept the marquess of Hastings in his military action in 1818 against the dissident Maratha states and their associated bands of organized marauders, known as Pindaris. He also persuaded the board to support Sir Thomas Munro's individual and annual revenue assessment in the Madras presidency, known as ryotwar, in the debate over taxation (the company's principal source of income following the granting of a new charter in 1813).<br>
<br>Sullivan retired from the Board of Control in 1828, after seventeen years as a commissioner, just before his eightieth birthday. He died on 1 November 1839 at Richings Lodge and was survived by his son, John Augustus, principal-marshal of Jamaica.<br>
