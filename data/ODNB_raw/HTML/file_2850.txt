<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bonner,  Edmund</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1569), <span class="occ">bishop of London</span>, was probably born in Hanley, Worcestershire. He was the son of Elizabeth Frodsham, later the wife of Edmund Bonner, sawyer, but most contemporary records suggest that he was the natural son of George Savage, the rector of Davenham, Cheshire [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52794/', "Savage family (per. c.1369&#150;1528)")</script>]. Strype, however, suggests that the allegation of illegitimacy may be false, on the evidence of Sir Nicholas Lechmere, the great-grandson of a great friend of Bonner. If the allegations are indeed false, they may have stemmed from the kindnesses done to the youthful Bonner by John Savage, rector of Quatt in Shropshire, who was later rewarded with a licence to hold additional benefices after Bonner's appointment as bishop.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifestudyanddiplomacy"></a>Early life: study and diplomacy</h2>Bonner was admitted to Broadgates Hall in Oxford about 1512. For seven years he studied civil and canon law, and was admitted to the degrees of bachelor of civil law and canon law on consecutive days in July 1519. According to Wood he took orders around this time. In July 1526 he received his doctorate in civil law, and in October that year was admitted to the College of Advocates in London. His diplomatic career began in the following March, when he was sent on a mission to the Netherlands. By 1529 he was a chaplain to Cardinal Wolsey, and in August was sent on an embassy to the king of France. Wolsey's downfall in 1530 did not arrest Bonner's progress, and he became a loyal servant of Thomas Cromwell. He was often employed abroad, and during this period became well known for his anti-papal sentiments, expressed clearly in his preface to Stephen Gardiner's <span class="italic">De vera obedientia</span>. It was only after Cromwell's fall in 1540 that he became more clearly associated with the conservative elements of the Henrician reforms. In the meantime he amassed a number of benefices, which supported his work abroad on behalf of the state. He became archdeacon of Leicester in 1535, and two years later was appointed to a canonry at St Paul's in London, and prebend of Chiswick. Also in 1537 he became a chaplain to the king, receiving a licence to be non-resident and to hold benefices to the value of &pound;500.<br>
<br>In January 1532 Bonner was sent to Rome by the king to protest against his citation there by the pope. He returned to England for a briefing in February 1533, returning to Rome in March. After Henry had been excommunicated Bonner followed the pope on his way to meet Fran&ccedil;ois I at Marseilles, where he made known the king's intention to appeal to a general council. In 1536 he was sent to negotiate with the protestants of Denmark and northern Germany. Two years later he was again sent abroad to make contact with the emperor with regard to the calling of a general council. He was transferred from that mission to the court of Fran&ccedil;ois I in July 1538, where he remained as ambassador until February 1540. While in Paris he promoted the printing of the <span class="roman">Great Bible</span>. It was during this time that the bishopric of Hereford became vacant through the untimely death of Edward Fox, and it was little surprise to find Bonner nominated to that see on 5 October 1538; formal election followed on the 26th.<h2>
<a name="Conservativeprelate"></a>Conservative prelate</h2>Bonner spent much of his time as bishop of Hereford on diplomatic missions abroad, and as a result he had still not received episcopal consecration when, after the death of John Stokesley, he was promoted to be bishop of London. Elected on 20 October 1539, he received royal assent on 7 November and had his temporalities on the 18th. Having returned from his embassy in France in February, Bonner was consecrated bishop on 4 April 1540. Soon afterwards, in September, he ordered a general procession to be held weekly in the city of London, to pray for the ending of the pestilence caused by that year's hot, dry summer. Bonner's enthronement as bishop of London took place in his cathedral church of St Paul on 16 April 1541. His concern with the prevention of the spread of heresy first showed itself when in December 1541 he issued an injunction requiring Alexander Nowell and William Tolwin, rector of St Antholin, Watling Street, to make a public recantation at Paul's Cross of their erroneous opinions regarding free will and good works. Soon after this he was again sent on an embassy, this time to the emperor Charles V, from February 1542 to November 1543. On Whit Sunday 1546 (13 June) Bonner took part in the public celebration of thanksgiving for the peace with France. He presided at a solemn <span class="roman">Te Deum</span> after high mass in the cathedral, sitting next to the lord mayor of London, then carried the sacrament in procession, with all the parish churches of London taking part. On the Friday following (18 June) he sat in the Guildhall with Nicholas Heath in the trial of Anne Askew and others for heresy. While the three men before them were persuaded (by Bonner, Heath, and others) to recant on the following day, Askew refused and was sent to the Tower where she was racked in order to obtain a confession (and probably to induce her to implicate Queen Katherine Parr, a known sympathizer with the new religion).<br>
<br>Despite his diplomatic contacts with continental protestantism Bonner remained broadly conservative in doctrine. When matters of religion took a turn towards reform on the accession of Edward VI, Bonner soon found himself in difficulties for his opinions. He was present at the coronation of the new king on 13 February 1547, and two days later attended the funeral of Henry VIII; he was one of a number of bishops who met the corpse at Syon and Windsor on its way to burial. Bonner appears to have given some offence to members of the council, to the extent that on 1 March the bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, found it necessary to write on his behalf to Sir William Paget. He seems to have kept a low profile in the first year of the young king's reign, and appears at the very least to have failed to encourage the progress of the reform that the new regime was promoting so vigorously. This lack of progress led the king to write to the bishop on 2 August 1549, not long after the first <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> came into force, of the negligence of many in his diocese who neglected to attend church and the holy communion. This was put down to Bonner's &#145;evil example and slackness&#146;; although he used to preach frequently, and at least on all principal feasts, he now preached very rarely indeed. The king, as supreme head of the church, ordered Bonner to reform, and commanded him, in his next sermon at St Paul's, to preach strongly against rebellion and resistance to temporal authority, and in support of obedience in the use of the rites of the church as established by law. A week later the king sent further injunctions to the bishop (delivered to him on 10 August), requiring him to celebrate communion in St Paul's a week from the following Sunday, and to declare in his sermon that despite his youth the present king's authority was no less than that of any of his predecessors; he was also to preach God's displeasure at rebellion.<br>
<br>Instead of obeying these orders, however, Bonner preached in support of the doctrine of transubstantiation, and omitted to emphasize the authority of the king. His failure to observe the king's clear instructions was discussed by the council on 8 September, and a commission for his deprivation was appointed. He was committed to the Marshalsea, and after inquiry by two royal commissions was deprived of his bishopric on 1 October. He returned to prison where he was to remain at the king's pleasure. His removal was well received by many of the reforming party. In a letter to Heinrich Bullinger of 7 November 1549 John Hooper wrote of the confinement and deposition of &#145;the most bitter enemy of the gospel&#146;, with whom he had had a &#145;sharp and dangerous contest&#146; at Paul's Cross and in the council. Prophetically, he added &#145;Should he be again restored to his office and episcopal function, I shall, I doubt not, be restored to my country and my Father which is in heaven&#146;  (Robinson, 69&#150;70). The author of the grey friars' chronicle relates how on 8 January 1550 Bonner had his bed removed by the keeper of the prison, and for eight days had only straw and a coverlet to lie on, for refusing to pay his gaoler the sum of &pound;10. Bonner's appeal against his sentence was heard on 6 February 1550, when he was taken from the Marshalsea to the council, sitting in Star Chamber at Westminster. He was informed that his appeal had been considered and dismissed by eight privy councillors. His deprivation by the archbishop and other commissioners stood, and his sentence was confirmed. He remained confined in the Marshalsea, without allowance for food or clothing, for the remainder of Edward VI's reign.<h2>
<a name="Catholicrestoration"></a>Catholic restoration</h2>Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, and on Saturday 5 August a pardon was sent from Queen Mary to Bonner in the Marshalsea, under the great seal of England. Bonner was effectively immediately reinstated as bishop of London, and went straight to his house at St Paul's on that evening. He was greeted with great joy by the people, who rang the bells of the cathedral. There is evidence, however, that Bonner's release was not greeted with universal acclaim. On Sunday 13 August he was present at Paul's Cross for a sermon by the leading conservative preacher (later bishop of Bath and Wells) Gilbert Bourne, who included in his bidding prayer an intercession for the souls departed, and in his sermon declared that Bonner had been wrongfully imprisoned. A serious commotion ensued, and a dagger was thrown at Bourne, missing him but hitting the post of the pulpit. The mayor and aldermen dispersed the crowd only with some difficulty, and Bonner had to be led through St Paul's to safety.<br>
<br>Bonner was formally restored to his bishopric on 22 August. The altars of his cathedral had been torn down in the previous reign, and he immediately set about having them restored. He sang mass in St Paul's on 17 September, then on 7 October, at the beginning of the convocation held there, sang the mass of the Holy Ghost at the high altar in full pontificals, the first mass to be celebrated there after it had been set up again. Bonner enjoyed the royal favour from the outset, and in January 1554 he was sent as one of the queen's ambassadors to meet Philip of Spain at Portsmouth. On 13 March he was appointed one of the commissioners for the examination of those bishops who had contracted marriage in the previous reign, and two days later to the commission for the deprivation of several of them. To fill the vacancies thus created he assisted Stephen Gardiner in consecrating six new bishops on 1 April. There was, however, much resistance to the restoration of Catholicism of which these consecrations were an important part. On 8 April a cat, made to look like a priest saying mass, was found hanged in Cheapside. It was taken to Bonner, who had it displayed at Paul's Cross during sermon time. Despite the offer of a reward by the lord mayor, no one was ever brought to account for this action. On 25 July Bonner was present at the marriage of Philip and Mary in Winchester Cathedral. In the following month he was in St Paul's, with the lord mayor and nine other bishops, for high mass, <span class="roman">Te Deum</span>, and procession, to give thanks for the queen's (mistaken) pregnancy, and to pray for her safe delivery.<br>
<br>Bonner commenced a visitation of his diocese on 3 September, ending on 8 October 1555. Undertaken under his own authority as bishop, rather than by virtue of the royal supremacy as had been the case for the previous twenty years, Bonner's visitation was a model of thoroughness in its inquiries into the morals, beliefs, and practices of the people of his diocese. He visited in person, preaching everywhere he went, while his articles formed the basis for those of a number of later visitations by other bishops, including those of Cardinal Pole's metropolitical visitation of 1556. On 28 October he consecrated John Hopton as bishop of Norwich, then on 18 November consecrated Ralph Baynes to Coventry and Lichfield, and John Holyman to Bristol. He also conducted personally about a quarter of the ordination ceremonies held in the diocese throughout the reign of Mary, many of which seem to have included large numbers of candidates for minor orders, perhaps as a way of validating the orders of those who had been ordained using the Edwardine ordinals, then generally considered deficient. On Advent Sunday (2 December) he and the lord chancellor (Gardiner) received Cardinal Pole at St Paul's. In Christmas week Bonner ordered that the feast of St Thomas of Canterbury (29 December) be kept as a holy day throughout his diocese. In September the following year he undertook three more episcopal consecrations, and after the death of Gardiner on 13 November conducted his funeral rites.<br>
<br>On his release Bonner had returned to him the control of all the estates that he had held as bishop when he was first summoned to trial in 1549. The restored estates included manors at Braintree and Southminster and lands at Hackney which had been given away by Nicholas Ridley during his tenure of the London diocese. The manors had been intended for the endowment of the short-lived diocese of Westminster, and Bonner was also allowed to retain the lands that had been granted to Ridley in exchange for them. He found it difficult, however, to draw any revenue from these properties; no income from them is recorded in his accounts for 1557, while in 1558 he appealed to Pole for help in securing Southminster. Much of his concern for his lands stemmed from his desire to provide financial support for his relatives, members of the Mongey family, to whom he gave leases of diocesan estates for sixty or seventy years, and also his mother, sister, and niece.<h2>
<a name="TheattackonheresyBloodyBonner"></a>The attack on heresy: &#145;Bloody Bonner&#146;?</h2>It was during the Marian years that Bonner gained a reputation for fierceness in his prosecution of heresy, earning him the title Bloody Bonner. His diocese had a long history of Lollardy, and the capital tended also to draw to itself those most active in promoting new ideas, in religion as in anything else. It was not surprising that new ideas had taken root there more securely than elsewhere under Edward VI, and it was also the place where they would be most obvious to those in government who were concerned with the restoration of Catholic orthodoxy. However, in the early years of the reign Bonner was reluctant to proceed in this matter with much vigour. In 1555 he was warned by the council for his slackness, as two months had passed without any convictions. His image as a bloody persecutor of the godly derived from his later actions, after his earlier misgivings had been overcome by pressure from government and the goading of obstinate heretics. His active campaign began in earnest soon after this, when on 25 May he sat with the lord mayor in St Paul's, and condemned a number of individuals for their opinions against the sacrament of the altar. Of 282 burnings recorded in episcopal registers for the period, 232 took place in the dioceses of London, Canterbury, Norwich, and Chichester; half the burnings in these four dioceses took place in Bonner's see of London.<br>
<br>It was not only in the eradication of heretics that Bonner and the other bishops sought to restore Catholicism and eliminate heresy. In 1554 Queen Mary's articles had required of each diocesan bishop that the people should be compelled to attend church and to receive instruction. To enable this to happen the bishops were to set forth a uniform order by homilies or other means for the teaching of the people. Bonner's response to this was to publish in 1555 his treatise <span class="italic">A Profitable and Necessary Doctrine with Certain Homilies Adjoined Thereto</span>. The treatise was modelled on the <span class="roman">King's Book</span> of 1543, thus retaining both continuity with the recent past and a link with a work that had been a focus for traditionalists in the reign of Edward VI. He was sent to Oxford in February 1556, where he carried out with Thomas Thirlby the solemn degradation of Cranmer, after which the former archbishop, now reduced to the lay state, could be handed over to the civil powers for burning (though Foxe's account of the incident, contrasting Bonner's fierceness with the reluctance and gentleness of Cranmer's old friend Thirlby, may have been exaggerated). The execution took place on 21 March, and on the following day Cardinal Pole was consecrated as archbishop, Bonner being one of those who assisted in this rite. He was also one of the bishops who received Pole at Bow church in London for mass on the feast of the Annunciation (25 March). On 30 June he took part in a procession at St Paul's for the patronal feast, while in July he and other royal commissioners set out a new order for processions. On 29 December 1556 (the feast of St Thomas of Canterbury) the council appointed him to a commission to seek out heretical books and writings. When a commission to inquire concerning heresy was set up on 8 February 1557, Bonner was one of the two bishops appointed to it, along with Thomas Thirlby, then bishop of Ely. It was little surprise to find these two acting together, as both were trained in civil and canon law, and each had a diocese containing a number of major centres of heresy&#151;London in Bonner's case, and Cambridge in Thirlby's.<br>
<br>An important part of the Catholic restoration was the attempt to reverse the dissolution of the monasteries, both by refounding dissolved institutions and (more rarely) by setting up new foundations. As a part of this process on 1 August 1557 Bonner carried out the perpetual enclosure of a community of nuns of Syon. The late summer of 1557 found Bonner associated with the funeral rites of a number of important people, including those for Anne of Cleves, the duchess of Norfolk, and the countess of Arundel. On 21 November 1557 he consecrated John Christopherson as bishop of Chichester. His activity against heretics continued through the final year of Mary's reign, and on 21 March 1558 he examined three heretics from his diocese, who were condemned to death by him, and handed over to the civil arm to be burnt. A report of Nicholas Sander, dating from about 1561, on the change of religion in England which took place in 1558&#150;9 after the death of Queen Mary, includes both an evaluation of Bonner the man, and a rationale of his severe approach to the prosecution of heresy. Stressing Bonner's &#145;greatness of mind&#146;, Sander notes how even some Catholics considered he had been too zealous in his persecution, having condemned more heretics than all the other Marian bishops together. Bonner's usual reply to this charge was that one death, by which many lives would be saved, was full of mercy, and that in matters of state the individual was of less concern than the whole body of citizens.<h2>
<a name="Deprivationimprisonmentanddeath"></a>Deprivation, imprisonment, and death</h2>The reputation of Bonner as a persecutor of heretics was widespread in the reign of Elizabeth I, and he was said by a contemporary commentator to have been in danger of his life whenever he ventured out, and that if any of the Marian bishops were executed, he would be the first to lose his life. There is a story that when the bishops were presented to the new queen after her accession she declined to offer him her hand to be kissed on account of his actions in the previous reign. He continued to be used on diplomatic business to the end, and on 23 May 1559 he entertained the French ambassadors, who stayed with him in his palace until 28 May. He was offered the oath of supremacy on 30 May, which he refused, and he was deprived of his bishopric, though allowed to remain at liberty. On 20 April 1560 he was again imprisoned in the Marshalsea, though it would appear under less restraint than during his previous confinement ten years before. He was held there under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Winchester, Robert Horne, for the rest of his life. In April 1564 he was taken from the prison by Horne and offered the oath of supremacy. Bonner had already once refused the oath, and to refuse a second time was a capital offence. At this point Bonner's legal training and forty years in the service of the state came into their own. When Horne presented the certificate of Bonner's refusal to the court of queen's bench, Bonner argued that it was without legal force as it named Horne as bishop of Winchester, and that under English law Horne's consecration was invalid, having been carried out by Matthew Parker whose own consecration as archbishop of Canterbury in 1559 had not been performed in accordance with the law then in force. Rather than test this argument in court the government chose not to proceed with the case. An act retrospectively validating all consecrations carried out since the beginning of Elizabeth's reign was passed in 1567, but Bonner was not again troubled with the oath. He died, still a prisoner in the Marshalsea, on 5 September 1569, and was buried at midnight in the churchyard of St George's, Southwark, on the order of Bishop Grindal of London, who feared that the occasion might otherwise lead to serious disturbances. However, it would appear that his body was subsequently moved to Copford (an ancient manor of the bishop of London) near Colchester, and buried in the church there. It was rediscovered in 1810 when a grave was being dug for a recently deceased rector.<br>
<br>The image of Bonner as a cruel, even sadistic, man is drawn largely from Foxe's interpretation of his actions. While it is true that he could be short-tempered, insolent, and tactless (Cromwell had more than once to protect him from the consequences of his own actions), he was also an able lawyer, quick-witted in argument. He seems to have become more violent as he grew older, perhaps as a result of his harsh confinement in the early 1550s; even so, it is possible that some of his reported excesses of behaviour were intended to frighten heretics into recantation and so to save them from the flames. Although clearly a difficult personality, it is none the less unfortunate that his reputation for cruelty has come to overshadow many years of valued service to both church and state.<br>
