<span class="headword">Sisam,  Kenneth</span>  (1887&#150;1971), <span class="occ">Anglo-Saxon scholar and publisher</span>, was born in Opotiki, Bay of Plenty, North Island, New Zealand, on 2 September 1887, the youngest of eight children of Alfred John Sisam (1844&#150;1928) and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Knights (1846&#150;1895). The family name came from the village of Syresham in Northamptonshire; in 1863 his father had emigrated from Warwickshire to New Zealand where he became a police constable before, in 1896, being allotted land there which he farmed. Kenneth won a scholarship to Auckland grammar school in 1905, and another in 1906 to University College, Auckland, whence he graduated MA with first-class honours in English and Latin in 1910. In the same year he won a Rhodes scholarship, and matriculated at Merton College, Oxford. Here he produced as a BLitt thesis an edition of the <span class="roman">Salisbury Psalter</span> (Salisbury Cathedral MS 150), supervised by Arthur Napier, professor of English; the degree was awarded in 1915.<br>
<br>Work on the <span class="roman">Psalter</span> led Sisam to a wider study of Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, and to correspondence with Edmund Bishop, the leading liturgical scholar in England, and with the eminent patristic scholar Dom Andr&eacute; Wilmart. From 1912 he took over some of Napier's teaching, his pupils including J. R. R. Tolkien. On 12 January 1915 he married Naomi Irene Gibbons (1885/6&#150;1958), whom he had met when he boarded with her aunt in Auckland; she was the daughter of Robert Pearce Gibbons. Overwork and illness combined to restrict Sisam's access to employment, and barred him from military service, but in 1915 he took on part-time work for the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> to supplement teaching. In 1916 he published in the <span class="italic">Modern Language Review</span> a long article on the <span class="roman">Beowulf</span> MS, demonstrating for the first time how the various texts assembled in the <span class="roman">Beowulf</span> MS had been chosen by the compiler, and why they were combined.<br>
<br>In 1917, Sisam's health having greatly improved, he and his wife moved to London and he began work at the Ministry of Food, rising quickly to become director of bacon contracts in 1919. In his spare time Sisam wrote reports on books for Oxford University Press, which they found severe but constructive, and in 1922 he was appointed assistant to John Johnson, then assistant secretary to the delegates of the press. When Johnson became university printer in 1925 Sisam succeeded him as assistant secretary. The Sisams had a house, Yatsden, built for them on Boars Hill, where their neighbours included Arthur Evans, John Masefield, Gilbert Murray, and Robert Bridges, whose literary executor he was. Sisam spent most of his leisure time in a garden created from an old clay pit. Here the Sisams brought up their children, Hugh (1923&#150;1989) and Celia (<i>b</i>. 1926). Sisam had found time for scholarship after the war, and his <span class="italic">Fourteenth Century English Verse and Prose</span> was published by the press in 1921; it became a standard work, and by 1972 had sold 60,000 copies. In 1925 he narrowly failed to obtain the chair of Anglo-Saxon, in competition with Tolkien. It was rumoured that R. W. Chapman, secretary to the OUP delegates since 1920, urged the chairman of the appointing committee to choose Tolkien so that Sisam's services could be kept by the press. Sisam published three pioneering papers on the transmission of &AElig;lfric's <span class="italic">Catholic Homilies</span> (1931&#150;3); in 1932, in his Gollancz lecture to the British Academy on the poetry of Cynewulf, he established for the first time that Cynewulf's four signed poems were composed in Mercia in the early ninth century. He also published a series of articles on textual corruption in the four Old English poetic codices. These substantial contributions to scholarship were recognized in his election to the British Academy in 1941.<br>
<br>From 1922 until 1942, when Sisam succeeded him, his superior at the press was Chapman, secretary to the delegates. The two men were very different, but worked well together: &#145;they have been described as two men who never met &hellip; Sisam came to assume the role of senior civil servant, content to let Chapman play minister&#146;  (Sutcliffe, 198). He developed a daily office routine beginning with &#145;morning prayers&#146;: the sorting and discussion of incoming letters, often used to give advice to his juniors  (<span class="italic">The Record</span> [Oxford University Press], 1971). Sisam's time at the Ministry of Food had given him valuable administrative experience, but he was also responsible for several important initiatives. One became the development of reference publishing, including dictionaries, in the early 1930s. The lexicographical team built up for the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> was employed after the dictionary's completion in 1933 in further work on both English and Latin. Another was the expansion of OUP's largely humanities publishing into science, after Sisam visited Ralph Fowler and Peter Kapitza in Cambridge in 1928. The result was the <span class="roman">International Series of Monographs on Physics</span>, begun in 1930 with Paul Dirac's <span class="italic">Principles of Quantum Mechanics</span>. Yet another was the support for refugee scholars, mostly German Jews, for which Sisam secured financial backing from the Rockefeller Foundation from 1941. The scholars included Paul Jacobsthal, Rudolf Pfeiffer, Arnaldo Momigliano, and Paul Maas; Maas became a regular guest at tea at Yatsden.<br>
<br>When he became secretary to OUP in 1942 Sisam was made a professorial fellow of Merton College. At this point the press was suffering from shortages of both staff and paper, and most of its work was concerned with security printing for government and the armed services; Sisam was largely responsible for bringing the firm through the war and the continuing austerities of the post-war years. He retired in 1948 to the Isles of Scilly. He and his wife had long holidayed there, and a house, Middle Carn, had been built for them on the island of St Mary's in 1937. Sisam refused invitations to Oxford and Cambridge, but continued to be consulted on press matters, including a controversy over word-divisions in the press emblem <i>Dominus illuminatio mea</i> (<i>Dom-inus</i> or <i>Domi-nus?</i>); he had published on the subject in 1929 (Society for Pure English Tract 33). Visitors found him happily spending his days boating and fishing. New and previously published work was collected in <span class="italic">Studies in the History of Old English Literature</span> (1953). His daughter, Celia, by then a tutor at St Hilda's College, Oxford, spent much of her vacations with him, and they worked together on an edition of the <span class="roman">Salisbury Psalter</span>, published in 1959, and on the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of Medieval English Verse</span> (1970). He also produced a short book, <span class="italic">The Structure of Beowulf</span> (1965), &#145;characteristically terse and penetrating&#146;  (Davis, 1971). Middle Carn also provided an annual refuge from his hectic Oxford life for Dan Davin, who had become assistant secretary to OUP on Sisam's retirement. Davin was the last of a long line of New Zealanders who had been encouraged and helped in Oxford by Sisam; others included John Mulgan, Jack Bennett, and James Bertram.<br>
<br>After his wife's death in 1958 Sisam lived alone at Middle Carn. He became involved in the local community, collecting local stories, giving legal advice, and contributing to the local journal, <span class="italic">The Scillonian</span>. It was locally believed that he was a retired lawyer, and this occupation was entered on his death certificate after his death, at the Manor nursing home, Lelant, St Ives, Cornwall, on 26 August 1971. The medievalist Eugene Vinaver described him as &#145;a scholar whose example and inspiration have been unequalled in the field of medieval studies in this century. His was perhaps the most acute and penetrating philological mind that I have ever known&#146;  (Vinaver). To Sisam's colleagues at OUP, Vinaver wrote that &#145;Everyone knows what a terrible mistake Oxford made when they by-passed him for the Chair of Anglo-Saxon&#146;  (Sutcliffe, 270). He belonged to a remarkable tradition combining publishing with scholarship in Oxford which began in the 1900s with Charles Cannan and ended with Colin Roberts in the 1970s. Sisam's colleague Peter Spicer remembered him as &#145;a big man with an upright carriage. His skin was brown and shiny; his eyes, gray-blue. He had a bulbous nose &hellip; he wiped a hand across it from time to time with a horizontal motion of his flipper-like hand. In his Scillonian home, one was irresistibly reminded of a great grey seal&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Record</span> [Oxford University Press], 1971).<br>
