<span class="headword">Day,  Matthew</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1611, <em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and schoolmaster</span>, was baptized on 24 February 1611 at Windsor, the third son of Matthew Day (1574&#150;1661), mayor of Windsor, and his wife, Mary (1580/81&#150;1667), daughter of George Dowdeswell of Eton. A king's scholar at Eton College between 1624 and 1630, he was then a scholar (1630&#150;33) and fellow (1633&#150;43) at King's College, Cambridge; he graduated BA in 1634 and proceeded MA in 1637. On 9 September 1642 Day, presented by Eton, succeeded David Stokes as rector of Everdon, Northamptonshire; he married Stokes's daughter Elizabeth on 7 May 1645. When parliament's Northampton committee had sought, on 18 May 1644, a reason for his non-appearance before it, Day answered from his home in Windsor that he would not take the covenant. The living's sequestration, for his desertion to royal quarters, was confirmed despite Day's letter of 24 August 1644 explaining his movements (which, he claimed, had included only a day in Oxford). Subsequently his wife was granted a fifth of the revenue (13 April 1647). The committee for advance of money heard on 13 November 1649 that Day&#151;described on this occasion as late minister of Caversham, Oxfordshire, delinquent&#151;had &pound;500 in the keeping of his father and father-in-law.<br>
<br>Undeterred by Day's royalism, Abraham Colfe appointed him master of his Lewisham grammar school, which opened on 10 June 1652. That year Day's only book was published: <span class="italic"><i>Parekbolai</i>, sive, Excerpta in sex priores Homeri Iliados libros</span>, a selective short commentary for students, dedicated to Colfe. Day resigned his mastership, effective from Michaelmas 1660, after Charles II had made him vicar of Staines, Middlesex, and the bishop of London had collated him to St Paul's prebend of Neasden (17 and 25 August respectively). In 1661 he became DD at Cambridge by royal mandamus. Day's wife died on 31 December that year. He himself died in the autumn of 1663 and was buried at Windsor on 4 October, leaving his mother and father-in-law, the beneficiaries of his will dated 25 September, to care for his four children, Matthew, Mary, Thomas, and Elizabeth.<br>
