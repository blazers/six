</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Whiteside,  James</span>  (1804&#150;1876), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born on 12 August 1804 at Delgany, co. Wicklow, the second son of the Revd William Whiteside and Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Robinson. Shortly after Whiteside's birth his father moved to Rathmines, near Dublin, where he died in 1806. Mrs Whiteside was left in narrow circumstances, but she was devoted to her children, and James was indebted to her for much of his early education. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1822, and graduated BA; he proceeded MA in 1832. He had entered Gray's Inn in London in Hilary term 1828, but the following year he entered as a law student at the Inner Temple. He was called to the Irish bar in Easter term 1830. Whiteside spent his first year studying law in the chambers of Joseph Chitty, and on commencing legal practice he joined the north-east circuit. He married, in July 1833, Rosetta, daughter of William Napier of Belfast, and sister of Sir Joseph Napier, sometime lord chancellor of Ireland.<br>
<br>From 1831 Whiteside's progress at his profession was rapid, and he was made a queen's counsel in 1842. He rapidly gained a reputation for forensic advocacy, and his speech in defence of Daniel O'Connell (in the 1843 state trials of the principal members of the repeal movement) placed him in front of all his contemporaries at the Irish bar. Shortly after the O'Connell trials Whiteside's health obliged him temporarily to relinquish his profession. He visited Italy, and was later to publish a three-volume work, <span class="italic">Italy in the Nineteenth Century</span> (1848), as well as a translation of Luigi Canina's <span class="italic">Indicazione topografica di Roma antica</span> as <span class="italic">Vicissitudes of the Eternal City</span> (1849).<br>
<br>After returning to active work, Whiteside acted as leading counsel for the defence of the Young Ireland leader, William Smith O'Brien, and his fellow prisoners in the state trials at Clonmel in 1848, O'Brien having been arrested in the wake of a failed peasant uprising in Ballingarry. Three years later, in 1851, he entered parliament as Conservative member for Enniskillen. In 1859 he was chosen as one of the representatives of Dublin University, and held this position until his elevation to the bench. Whiteside's striking talent as a speaker made him a valuable accession to his party in the House of Commons, and it is said that when there was battle expected in the house, Lord Derby would say to him &#145;Now Whiteside, where's your shillelagh?&#146;  (Hogan and Osborough, 212). On the formation of Derby's first administration in 1852 he was appointed solicitor-general for Ireland, his brother-in-law Joseph Napier being attorney-general. He was in the same year elected a bencher of King's Inns. Whiteside himself was to fill the office of attorney-general from 1858 to 1859, in Derby's second government, and in 1858 he was sworn of the Irish privy council.<br>
<br>During the Liberal administration (1859&#150;66) Whiteside was in opposition; but, despite the claims of his profession, he was able to devote much of his time to his parliamentary duties and took an eminent part in the counsels of the Conservative opposition. He attained a high position in the House of Commons, where his eloquence, wit, and geniality made him popular with all parties. In 1861, on his return to London after the marvellous speech in the celebrated Yelverton case&#151;when he represented Maria Theresa Longworth, in the most famous of all his forensic efforts&#151;Whiteside received a remarkable compliment, being greeted with general cheers as he entered the House of Commons for the first time after the conclusion of the trial.<br>
<br>Having proceeded DL at Dublin University in 1859, Whiteside received from Oxford University the honorary degree of DCL in 1863.<br>
<br>On the return of Lord Derby to office in 1866 Whiteside was again appointed attorney-general. Shortly afterwards he accepted the office of chief justice of the queen's bench in Ireland, on the retirement of Thomas Langlois Lefroy, though it seems that he felt slighted at not having been offered the Irish lord chancellorship. The latter office was generally considered rightfully to be his, but his association with the extreme tory and protestant wing of the Conservative Party would not allow Derby thus to elevate him, since the prime minister wished to form a broad-based Irish executive. Whiteside served as lord chief justice for ten years, but the last of these were clouded by ill health. He died at Brighton on 25 November 1876 and was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin.<br>
<br>Whiteside's talents were rhetorical and forensic rather than judicial. Although he brought to his high position great personal dignity and the charm of a singularly attractive personality, he was not very successful as a judge because he was not strong in law. This deficit was countered by a strong reliance on Mr Justice James O'Brien, a quiet, unpresuming man, deeply learned in the law. Indeed, Whiteside was once heard saying to a colleague, &#145;Yours is, my dear friend, a most gentlemanly judgment, but O'Brien says it's not good law, and we can't risk it&#146;  (Ross).<br>
<br>Whiteside is thus best remembered for his advocacy, rather than for his judicial pronouncement. He was unapproached in point of eloquence by any of his contemporaries, and his powerful personality, at once winning and commanding, gave him an almost unexampled pre-eminence. His forensic style has been described as &#145;impetuously burying facts and law under a golden avalanche of discursive eloquence&#146;; and his parliamentary oratory was thus praised by Lord Lytton in his poem, &#145;St Stephen's&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>Still Whiteside's genius charms both foes and friends,<br>
</div>
<div>So headlong force with sparkling fancy blends,<br>
</div>
<div>As torrents flash the more their rush depends.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Whiteside was of course a most influential political figure, but his reputation was really forged through legal advocacy, and his remains one of the most brilliant names in the annals of the Irish bar.<br>
