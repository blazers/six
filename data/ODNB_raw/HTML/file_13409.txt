<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hobson,  Thomas</span>  (1545&#150;1631), <span class="occ">carrier</span>, was the elder son of Thomas Hobson and his wife, Elinor. His birthplace has been stated as Buntingford, Hertfordshire, on the strength of his father's having been born there, but a note on the back of a contemporary petition relating to Hobson states that he was born at Holbeach, Lincolnshire, near which (at Moulton, and elsewhere) Hobson owned land in 1630, and at which his brother resided.<br>
<br>His father, also a carrier, had settled in Cambridge by 1561, and was at the time of his death, in 1568, one of the treasurers of the corporation. He devised his copyhold lands in Grantchester to his son Thomas, to whom he bequeathed &#145;the teame wayre that he now goeth with that is to say the carte &amp; eighte horses &amp; all the harneyes and other things thereunto belonginge with the nagge&#146;  (Cooper, 231). After his father's death Thomas continued the business with great success. The business was conducted by carts, and later by wagons drawn by teams of six or seven horses; there is no evidence that Hobson ever used packhorses. Both goods and passengers were carried, as well as &#145;a certayne greate tunn or vessell&#146; containing live fish for the royal household. All the extant references show that the actual driving was done by servants, rather than by Hobson himself. Hobson was also active in hiring out horses, and his refusal to allow any horse to be taken except in its proper turn is said to have given rise to the saying, &#145;Hobson's choice&#146;, that is &#145;this or none&#146;. Hobson used to tell the Cambridge scholars that they would get to London early enough &#145;if they did not ride too fast&#146;  (Clarke, 111). His fame extended far beyond the university, as in 1617 a tract appeared entitled <span class="italic">Hobson's Horse Load of Letters, or, Precedents for Epistles of Business</span>.<br>
<br>Hobson married his first wife, Agnes Humbrestone, at Ware on 2 December 1577. They had three sons (none of whom survived him) and five daughters. His will refers to the large portions provided on the marriage of two of his daughters, one to a baronet and the other to a gentleman, &#145;whereby my estate is much lesse then heretofore it was&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/159, q. 17). Agnes died in 1615. His second wife was named Mary; she also predeceased him.<br>
<br>In 1626 Hobson presented a large <span class="roman">Bible</span> to the church of St Benedict, in which parish he resided. In 1627 he acquired the site of the priory of Anglesey, with the manor of Anglesey-cum-Bottisham, Cambridgeshire. He was also owner of the manors of Crowlands, Lisles, and Sames in Cottenham, and, as lessee of the crown, held the Denny Abbey estate, with the manors of Waterbeach and Denny. His will mentions other property in Cambridge, Chesterton, Tidd St Giles, and Moulton. On 30 July 1628 he conveyed to the university and town of Cambridge the ground on which was erected the structure commonly known as the Spinning House, but more correctly called &#145;Hobson's Workhouse&#146;. In spite of his advanced age he continued his journeys to London until 1630, when they were suspended on account of the plague. During this cessation of business he died at Cambridge on 1 January 1631. He was buried in the church of St Benedict on 12 January. Milton wrote two humorous epitaphs on Hobson.<br>
<br>A street in Cambridge is named after Hobson. In his will he provided for the maintenance of the existing conduit on Market Hill, and for making it &#145;halfe a yard higher or more (if with conveniencye it may be done)&#146;; on the strength of this it became known as Hobson's Conduit, and it still survives (in the late twentieth century) on a different site  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/159, q. 17).<br>
