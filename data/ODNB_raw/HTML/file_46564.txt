<span class="headword">Taylor,  Ida Alice Ashworth</span>  (1847&#150;1929), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was the eldest daughter and second child of the five children of Theodosia Alice Spring-Rice Taylor (1818&#150;1891) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27030/', "Sir Henry Taylor (1800&#150;1886)")</script>. She was born at East Sheen, Surrey, and spent her childhood there and at the family's seaside villa at Bournemouth. Her father's dual career as poet and Colonial Office administrator brought his children into contact with many of the leading political and literary figures of the Victorian age. &#145;Politicians, philosophers, theologians, priests of many and divers churches and poets of the world&#146; gathered at the Taylors' Bournemouth home, and included among Sir Henry's associates were Carlyle, Tennyson, J. S. Mill, Southey, and the poet Aubrey De Vere, who was a cousin of Mrs Taylor  (V. A. Taylor, 19). While there is no record of Ida's formal education, the intellectual and cultured atmosphere that pervaded the Taylor home no doubt influenced her thinking and stimulated her interest in a literary career.<br>
<br>After their mother's death in 1891, Ida and her younger sister Una left the Taylor home and took a small house in Montpelier Square, London, where they conducted a popular literary salon. Neither sister married, and they apparently supported themselves primarily through their writing. Ida Ashworth Taylor was a prolific biographer, whose works reflect the expanding historicism and pervasive interest in the past which characterized the Victorian period. Taylor contributed historical pieces regularly to <span class="italic">Longman's Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, and <span class="italic">Temple Bar</span>, and her works were frequently reprinted in <span class="italic">Littell's Living Age</span>. Although she wrote several novels (<span class="italic">Venus' Doves</span>, 1884; <span class="italic">Allegiance</span>, 1886) and biographies of divers historical figures (<span class="italic">Revolutionary Types</span>, 1904; <span class="italic">The Making of a King</span>, 1910), Taylor is most strongly identified with her studies of prominent women. <span class="italic">Queen Hortense and her Friends</span> (1907), <span class="italic">Lady Jane Grey and her Times</span> (1908), and <span class="italic">The Life of Madame Roland</span> (1911) are crammed with factual details, demonstrating a typical Victorian emphasis on historical accuracy and a strong dependence on the evidence of letters, journals, and diaries. Her works on women not only follow in the tradition of Agnes and Elizabeth Strickland's famous histories of female royalty, but reflect the growing movement, largely undertaken by women writers, to call attention to women's historical presence and contributions.<br>
<br>Taylor's works generally enjoyed both popular and critical favour and were often noted for their clear style and focused attention to narrative detail. But it appears that the Victorian fascination with &#145;great men&#146; led to her omission from the canon of Victorian biographers. With the general trend to study past lives she fully complied; however, the female subjects that she examined in many of her works were deemed insignificant by some critics, and hence unworthy of study. Though acknowledging that Taylor's work on Queen Hortense was &#145;the best complete account of her in any language&#146;, the <span class="italic">American Historical Review</span> (1907&#150;8) dismissed the queen as having &#145;slight importance&#146; and deserving &#145;scant mention&#146; in the history of the Napoleonic era . Commenting on <span class="italic">Christina of Sweden</span> (1909), another reviewer allowed that the biography was &#145;excellently written&#146;, but concluded that the book focused on a &#145;silly ass&#146;, whose life was scarcely worth mention  (<span class="italic">New York Times</span>). The devaluation of scholarship concerning women's historical significance was not uncommon in Taylor's time, with the <span class="italic">American Historical Review</span> often relegating narrative histories of women to the &#145;Minor notices&#146; section. In addition to such prejudice against her subject matter, the advancing specialization of biography writing in the late Victorian period served to undermine and eventually to edge out the &#145;amateur&#146; biographers, such as Taylor, who also wrote other types of works and who generally stood outside academic and professional circles.<br>
<br>The last member of her family, Ida Ashworth Taylor died on 13 October 1929 at her home at Wootton Wood, New Milton, Hampshire. Her obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span> stated that Taylor's biographies of women were &#145;most characteristic of the authoress&#146;, and that her work was marked by &#145;a sincere and womanly sympathy with its subject&#146;. Such a characterization indicates the contemporary categorization of women writers and their works which led to Taylor's subsequent obscurity.<br>
