<span class="headword">Spencer,  George Alfred</span>  (1873?&#150;1957), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born at Sutton in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, probably in 1873, the second son in a mining family which eventually numbered eighteen children. His parents, John Spencer and his wife, Eliza, moved around a lot when Spencer was a boy and this may explain why no record of his birth has been found. The family moved to Worksop and at the age of eight Spencer was working on local farms. His parents later kept a public house at South Normanton in Derbyshire and the eleven-year-old boy worked as a half-timer at a coal mine in Pleasley. The following year he began work underground at Blackwell colliery. Spencer was later to compensate for an intermittent early education by attending evening classes organized by the Workers' Educational Association. He also became a Wesleyan Methodist preacher.<br>
<br>In 1896 Spencer married Emma, daughter of Richard Carlin of Sutton in Ashfield. They had two children, one daughter and a son who later became a doctor. By this time Spencer was working at New Hucknall colliery where the miners elected him checkweighman. He soon became president of the local branch of the Nottinghamshire Miners' Association (NMA), a delegate, and then permanent official, and was of sufficient standing in the coalfield by 1910 to be nominated as an arbitrator when cutting machines were introduced at Eastwood collieries. He narrowly failed to be elected to the post of NMA assistant secretary in the same year but in 1912 became the union's president.<br>
<br>Spencer had also become active in labour politics and was voted onto the urban district council in Sutton in Ashfield, eventually becoming its chairman. His support for the war was reflected by his membership of the local military tribunal. In general he was not on the left of the Labour Party, although he opposed intervention in Russia after the revolution and called for the withdrawal of British troops from Ireland. In the general election of 1918 he won Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire for Labour and held the seat at the elections of 1922, 1923, and 1924. He resigned the Labour whip in 1927 and did not stand in 1929.<br>
<br>Like many miners' leaders Spencer believed strongly in the idea of the independence of the county associations. In 1915 he supported the attempt of J. G. Hancock MP to disaffiliate the NMA from the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB) and in 1918 he spoke strongly against a proposal for national wage negotiations. He was very conscious that Nottinghamshire was one of the most prosperous coalfields in contrast to the economic difficulties of most of the others. He was not always consistent, however, and at the annual conference of the MFGB in 1920 he seconded the resolution in favour of the nationalization of the mines. The turning-point in his career came with the general strike in 1926 and the long drawn out stoppage in the coal industry which followed.<br>
<br>The miners' unions had barely recovered from the strike of 1921. In Nottinghamshire, 6000 miners were in arrears with their subscriptions and 23,000 were not in the union. Spencer hoped that the report of the royal commission on the coal industry, chaired by Sir Herbert Samuel, would form the basis for an agreement on its future. A strike began in May 1926, however, and by August there was growing contact between groups of miners and local colliery companies, and a steady drift back to work began in Nottinghamshire. Spencer did not instigate this movement but intervened in its later stages in order to get the best possible terms for the men. As this was not the policy of the MFGB he was summoned before their national conference where he was called a coward and a blackleg and expelled. He was suspended by the NMA. His decision to lead a breakaway union quickly followed and on 20 November the Nottinghamshire Miners' Industrial Union (NMIU) reached an agreement with the local coal employers.<br>
<br>The Spencer union was anti-socialist. It was an industrial organization whose funds were not to be used for politics. Spencer characterized the miners' strike of 1926 as an &#145;experiment in elementary communism&#146;  (Waller, 111). The rules of the NMIU barred from membership communists or members of the Minority Movement. Nor was it a particularly democratic organization. The holding of branch meetings was at the discretion of the branch committee and difficult matters were often referred to the union's central office or to Spencer himself. The aim was to co-operate with the employers in a relatively prosperous coalfield. Spencer was especially concerned with the plight of the old miners and he persuaded the owners to subsidize a pension fund. He was well known for his handling of compensation cases and in 1930 alone won over &pound;10,000 for NMIU members. He was often called in by branches to talk personally to colliery managements. It was not a bosses' union. As Spencer said, &#145;in my view there can be no improvement in the lot of the worker unless and until there is co-operation between the two, but while I am co-operating with the owners, I shall see to it that the workers get their share of the wealth that their joint efforts create&#146;  (Griffin and Griffin, 152).<br>
<br>Outside Nottinghamshire, the non-political trade union movement had little success. Spencer became president of the Federation of Non-Political Unions but he was not a national leader, being much more concerned to do the best he could for Nottinghamshire miners. The national strength of the MFGB recovered with the economy in the second half of the 1930s, so much so that an attempt was made to re-form an NMA branch at Harworth colliery in 1936. The strike which followed provided the opportunity for the negotiations which led to the fusion of the Spencer union and the NMA as the Nottinghamshire Miners' Federated Union in 1937. The terms were largely dictated by Spencer. He became president of the new amalgamated organization as well as its representative on the MFGB. He was also able to insist that the existing district wages agreement should continue for five years and that there should be no strikes in that time. He retired in 1945.<br>
<br>Spencer rose to be a member of the Nottinghamshire &eacute;lite from the humblest of beginnings. He was deputy lieutenant of the county from 1941 and a member of the freemasons. He was interested in art and sport, and was president of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club in 1949&#150;50. He once scored eighty runs playing for the House of Commons at the Oval. He liked to dress in formal suits and had little time for the traditional cloth cap of the working man. He died in Nottingham City Hospital on 21 November 1957. He was survived by his wife.<br>
