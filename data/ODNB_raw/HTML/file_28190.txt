<span class="headword">Vennar <span class="st"> [Vennard]</span>,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1564, <em>d.</em> 1615), <span class="occ">author</span>, was baptized on 25 January 1564 at the church of St Edmund, Salisbury, the second son of John Vennard (<i>c</i>.1520&#150;1589), merchant (probably a mercer), and his wife, whose surname may have been Harris. Others called him Vennar and his name is so spelt in his autobiography, <span class="italic">An Apology</span> (1614). According to Vennar, Bishop Jewell baptized him in the presence of the earls of Bedford and Pembroke. He was educated by Adam Hill in Salisbury, then went to Balliol College, Oxford, as a fellow-commoner for two years, after which his father sent him with an Italian guide, a serving man, and a page to the courts of Henri III in Paris and Maximilian II in Vienna and home again through Germany. He &#145;forth-with&#146; admitted himself to Lincoln's Inn, where he maintained &#145;sixe men, with horses sutable&#146;  (Vennar, <span class="italic">Apology</span>, 5&#150;6). But since Henri set up his court in September 1574 and Maximilian died in October 1576, Vennar would have made his journey when he was ten to twelve years old, having already spent two years at Oxford. Moreover, he went to Barnard's Inn first, then on 10 June 1581 to Lincoln's Inn, where six years later he acquired special admission. He was there for twenty-six years without being called to the bar or practising law.<br>
<br>Vennar's father complained about his son's wasting money and gave him &pound;300 on condition that he demand no more. But when first his older brother died in 1588 and then his father in 1589, Vennar sued his brother's widow, Mary, in the Star Chamber for his father's estate. She soon married a lawyer in Lincoln's Inn, Richard Low, and they defeated Vennar, who in 1599 compounded for &pound;150, though he thought he should have had thousands. This lawsuit sent Vennar to prison at least twice, for allegedly stealing documents and for debt, and therefore, Vennar thought, destroyed his reputation and his life. He also went to prison for a fraud in 1590&#150;91, of which he was found innocent.<br>
<br>In 1600 Vennar made the first of three attempts to rehabilitate himself. He went to Scotland and found favour with James VI, but on his return was accused of disloyalty and spent more time in prison. He next tried unsuccessfully to be called to the bar and then took up a literary career. In 1601 and 1602 he produced a pious, protestant work in prose and verse, <span class="italic">The Right Way to Heaven</span>; a poem called <span class="italic">England's Joy</span>, on Lord Mountjoy's great victory at Kinsale; a much revised edition of <span class="italic">The Right Way</span>; and a play (now lost) also called <span class="italic">England's Joy</span>, which he said was to raise money for a return to Scotland. Later he wrote a (lost) broadside against papists and <span class="italic">The True Testimony of a Faithful Subject</span> (1605), a thanksgiving for the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot that includes part of <span class="italic">The Right Way</span>.<br>
<br>Vennar was and is mainly known for his attempt to mount his play. In a broadside, <span class="italic">Plot of the Play Called &#145;England's Joy&#146;</span> (1602), he announced its performance at the Swan Playhouse on 6 November 1602. It was to consist of nine spectacular scenes acted, as report had it, by gentlemen and gentlewomen. According to Vennar spectators paid 12<i>s</i>. each and the actors were &#145;men of good birth, Schollers by profession&#146;&#151;not, apparently, women. Vennar duly appeared on stage and delivered six lines of the prologue, but then bailiffs arrested him for debt and effectually &#145;spoke an Epilogue insteed&#146;. Although he pocketed &#145;much mony&#146;, the authorities did not indict him  (Vennar, <span class="italic">Apology</span>, 24&#150;7).<br>
<br>A rather different story was soon current and has remained so. John Chamberlain explained it to Dudley Carleton on 19 November: Vennar<blockquote>gave out bills of a famous play on satterday was sevenight on the Banckeside, to be acted only by certain gentlemen and gentlewomen of account, the price at comming in was two shillings or eighteen pence at least and when he had gotten most part of the money into his hands, he wold have shewed them a fayre payre of heeles, but he was not so nimble to get up on horsebacke, but that he was faine to forsake that course, and betake himself to the water, where he was pursued and taken and brought before the L: Cheife Justice [Sir John Popham], who wold make nothing of that but a iest and merriment, and bounde him over in five pound to appeare at the sessions: in the meane time the common people &hellip; revenged themselves upon the hangings curtaines chaires stooles walles and whatsoever came in theyre way very outragiously and made a great spoyle (TNA: PRO, SP 12/285, fol. 149<i>v</i>.)</blockquote>Thereafter Vennar himself was derisively called England's Joy. The play was finally mounted by William Fennor in the spring of 1615.<br>
<br>Vennar was imprisoned at least three more times: for wronging lawyers at the Inner Temple, of which he was found guiltless and recompensed; for fraud while trying to raise money in 1606 to finance a masque, of which he was also found guiltless but remained in prison because he could not raise sureties for good behaviour; and for debt in 1614. During this last imprisonment, which was in the Wood Street compter, he wrote his <span class="italic">Apology</span> and died. He was buried at St Michael, Wood Street, on 13 October 1615, aged fifty-one. According to Fennor in 1616, Vennar had objected to fees demanded in the compter and been thrown into the black hole, where &#145;lying without a bedde, hee caught such an extreame cold in his legges, that it was not long before he departed this life&#146;  (W. Fennor, <span class="italic">Compter's Commonwealth</span>, 1617, 62&#150;4).<br>
<br>In 1588 Vennar had a wife, Elizabeth (who apparently had recusant connections), and for two weeks in 1590 a son, Richard. He was estranged from his wife and &#145;children&#146; in 1596  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/256, fol. 134) and was single and childless in 1614. His actions and their results made his claims to social distinction ridiculous, but his verse, usually in the six-line stanza of <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span>, is respectable in the manner of Daniel and Drayton, if often overblown, and his prose in the <span class="italic">Apology</span> is lively.<br>
