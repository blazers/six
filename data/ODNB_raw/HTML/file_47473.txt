<span class="headword">Bell,  Aubrey FitzGerald</span>  (1881&#150;1950), <span class="occ">Portuguese and Spanish scholar</span>, was born on 20 August 1881 at the vicarage of Muncaster, Ravenglass, Cumberland, the son of the Revd Henry Bell (1838&#150;1919), rural dean of Gosforth and subsequently canon of Carlisle Cathedral, and his wife, Katherine, daughter of Sir Peter Fitz-Gerald, knight of Kerry. At the age of five he moved with his mother to St Jean-de-Luz where he was educated privately before going as a classical scholar to Keble College, Oxford, in 1900. He took a second in classical moderations (1902) and graduated with a third in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1904).<br>
<br>Between 1905 and 1908 Bell was assistant keeper of printed books at the British Museum. After leaving the British Museum he travelled in Spain and Portugal, settling eventually at Manique de Baixo, near Estoril, in 1911. He may have had his years of travel in mind when he wrote in a letter to Sir Idris Bell: &#145;I saw many beautiful &amp; interesting things but in hardships, noise &amp; general weariness I paid amply for every one of them&#146;  (28 Aug 1925, Idris Bell papers, fol. 69). His first book, a collection of poems entitled <span class="italic">Songs of Rest</span>, was published in 1911 under the pseudonym of A. F. Gerald. He used this pseudonym on three other occasions and once employed a Hispanicized version, &Aacute;lvaro Gir&aacute;ldez, though most of his work was published under his own name.<br>
<br>In Portugal Bell became correspondent for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> and wrote regularly for other journals, including <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, and the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, which became his principal source of income. Although he lived a retired and almost reclusive life he took a keen interest in contemporary events, as can be seen in works such as <span class="italic">Portugal of the Portuguese</span> (1915), where his comments on Portuguese politics were direct, incisive, and unflattering. The Avenida da Liberdade in Lisbon had never become popular, he wrote, because &#145;It seems to be too far from the centres of gossip: before you had walked [from one end to the other] a ministry might have fallen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portugal of the Portuguese</span>, 41&#150;2). His activities as newspaper correspondent more than once aroused the suspicion of the authorities in Spain as well as in Portugal and he served a term in a military prison in 1912.<br>
<br>While living in Portugal Bell wrote a succession of major scholarly works. <span class="italic">Portuguese Literature</span> appeared in 1922 and <span class="italic">The Oxford Book of Portuguese Verse</span> in 1925, both enthusiastically reviewed. In 1933, during a spell in the British Hospital in Lisbon, he met and subsequently married a nurse, Barbara Lindsay Wilkie from Edinburgh. They had two sons who, Aubrey wrote, would have to be brought up as &#145;illiterate peasants [as] there will be no money to educate either of them&#146;  (1 July 1936, Idris Bell papers, fol. 74). In August 1940, shortly after the outbreak of war, the family moved to Toronto. Before he left Portugal, the ministry of education awarded him the order of Santiago. Bell sold his library to the Instituto Espa&ntilde;ol in Lisbon, which eventually disposed of it to the University of Salamanca.<br>
<br>From Toronto the Bells moved to Victoria, British Columbia. There, in 1947, Aubrey completed his last major work, <span class="italic">Cervantes</span>. He died at Saanich, Victoria, British Columbia on 7 May 1950. His ashes were brought back to Ravenglass. His wife subsequently moved to California and resumed her career as a nurse.<br>
<br>Aubrey Bell never held any academic post, or indeed any salaried position at all, after he left the British Museum, and his scholarship was entirely self-taught and self-generated. He was a prolific writer and in all published thirty-five books on Spanish and Portuguese topics. Some of these were printed privately in very limited editions. He wrote important critical studies of the major classical Spanish and Portuguese authors as well as a number of more general works of travel, history, and bibliography. He was also a regular reviewer for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, the <span class="italic">Bulletin of Spanish Studies</span>, and the <span class="italic">Modern Language Review</span>. His work is characterized by a highly individual and original style of writing and by meticulous attention to bibliographical scholarship. He was also a translator of note, and included in his writings many of his own translations into English verse.<br>
<br>Aubrey Bell's particular distinction lay in his pioneering study of Portuguese literature. Before he wrote, the English-speaking world knew little about any Portuguese writers except Cam&otilde;es. Bell introduced English readers to Gil Vicente, many of whose plays he translated, to the historians Lopes, Correa, Barros, and Couto, and to the early Portuguese poets. In particular he drew attention to the medieval <span class="italic">Cantigos do amigo</span> and <span class="italic">Cantigos de amor</span>. He had a nostalgic admiration for early Portuguese literature and for the purity of language which he believed existed in the early Renaissance: &#145;The restoration of the Portuguese language to its original purity is an essential condition &hellip; since it is vain to hope to gather figs from thistles&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portugal of the Portuguese</span>, 151). His work was always carefully crafted so that even such slight historical works as his <span class="italic">Portuguese Portraits</span> (1917) can be read with pleasure. Among his other writings were <span class="italic">In Portugal</span> (1912), <span class="italic">The Magic of Spain</span> (1912), <span class="italic">Poems from the Portuguese</span> (1913), <span class="italic">Lyrics of Gil Vicente</span> (1914), <span class="italic">Portuguese Bibliography</span> (1922), <span class="italic">Spanish Galicia</span> (1922), <span class="italic">A Pilgrim in Spain</span> (1924), <span class="italic">Contemporary Spanish Literature</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">Castilian Literature</span> (1938).<br>
<br>Bell was a shy and reclusive person, though well known to the small circle of scholars of Portuguese and Spanish literature. He cultivated a lifestyle that verged on the eccentric&#151;rising regularly in the middle of the night to do his writing. As well as his studies of literature, Bell was a keen gardener, as his father had been, and wrote attractively about the gardens and flowers of Portugal.<br>
