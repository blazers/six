<span class="headword">Pope,  Mildred Katherine</span>  (1872&#150;1956), <span class="occ">French scholar</span>, was born on 28 January 1872 at the vicarage in Paddock Wood, Kent, daughter of the Revd Edwin Pope (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1830), vicar of Paddock Wood, and his wife, Emily Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Watson. After attending Edgbaston High School for Girls (1881&#150;8), she taught briefly at Maidstone School and then at Edgbaston high school, before proceeding to Somerville College, Oxford, as an exhibitioner in 1891. Her chosen field of modern languages was little catered for in Oxford at the time&#151;there was no honours teaching in French&#151;and her speciality of Old French philology not at all; so her apprenticeship in what was to become her life's work was undertaken by correspondence course with Dr Paget Toynbee of Cambridge University  (<span class="italic">Studies</span>, xi). The dedication and brilliance she showed as a student also extended to the games field&#151;she was a blue in hockey&#151;and the debating chamber: she was &#145;renowned for her pace on the wing &hellip; and her level-headedness in debate&#146;  (Farnell, 24). She achieved a first class in the Oxford University examination for women (1893) and spent the following year in Heidelberg studying philology with Neumann.<br>
<br>On her return, Pope was appointed as librarian at Somerville College and almost immediately as tutor, being granted leave in 1900 and 1902 to prepare her doctorate in Paris under Gaston Paris and Paul Meyer. Her thesis was published as <span class="italic">&Eacute;tude sur la langue de fr&egrave;re Angier, suivie d'un glossaire de ses po&egrave;mes</span> in 1903. She continued as tutor at Somerville until 1934, being &#145;the most beloved of all [the College's] tutors&#146;  (Adams, 53), renowned for her modesty and sheer enthusiasm for learning. When women were admitted as members of Oxford University in 1919 Pope was awarded her MA by decree and in 1920 appointed as Taylorian lecturer in French; she became fellow of her college (1921) and was the first woman to be appointed reader in Oxford (1928). The establishment and development of the teaching of medieval French at Oxford has been considered the almost single-handed achievement of Mildred Pope  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 19 Sept 1956). It was during her Oxford years that she produced her edition of <span class="italic">The Life of the Black Prince by the Herald of Sir John Chandos</span> (1910, with Eleanor Lodge), a dozen articles on Old French and Anglo-Norman prosody and language, and numerous book reviews. It would be fair to say that Pope effectively invented the discipline of Anglo-Norman studies.<br>
<br>Throughout her career Pope remained committed to social causes. During the First World War she spent the three vacations of 1915 working with the Friends' War Victims' Relief Expedition in northern France  (<span class="italic">Studies</span>, xii). An active feminist, she campaigned for women's suffrage, clashing in 1912 with college authorities over her recruitment of female dons to the cause  (Adams, 79). She later wrote in defence of the use of the term &#145;fellow&#146; in women's colleges, insisting on the importance of research-based fellowships for women in enhancing the intellectual life of their colleges  (Adams, 60).<br>
<br>In 1934 Pope became visiting professor at the University of Manchester, then professor of French language and Romance philology (1935), being elected simultaneously honorary fellow of Somerville. She held that post until 1939, in which year she was presented by colleagues, friends, and pupils with the volume <span class="italic">Studies in French Language and Mediaeval Literature</span>. Her major work, and the one for which she is generally remembered, <span class="italic">From Latin to Modern French, with Especial Consideration of Anglo-Norman</span> (1934) is a monumental study of the history of French phonology and morphology. The greatest achievement of her professional life, and her most enduring monument, was the founding of the Anglo-Norman Text Society (1937), to which she contributed editions of <span class="italic">La seinte resureccion</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">The Romance of Horn</span> (1955, completed by T. B. W. Reid, 1964), and of which she was honorary secretary (1937&#150;52). On her retirement she was made professor emeritus by Manchester, and received a doctorate, <i>honoris causa</i>, from the University of Bordeaux, the first woman so honoured by a French university.<br>
<br>Mildred Pope's most famous pupil, Dorothy L. Sayers, gave the address at a dinner in her honour when she left Somerville in 1934. She characterized her former tutor as having &#145;integrity of judgement &hellip; humility in the face of facts &hellip; the generosity of a great mind &hellip; that will not be contented with the second-hand or second-best&#146;  (Adams, 188). Sayers immortalized her as &#145;Miss Lydgate&#146; in <span class="italic">Gaudy Night</span>, in which her great philological study also figures as &#145;A history of English prosody&#146;, identifiable by its multiplicity of fonts and special alphabet, replete with &#145;pot hooks&#146;. Some who knew her say she was unhappy with this notoriety. In retirement Pope lived in Fant Cottage, Garford, Abingdon, Berkshire, and died of carcinoma of the stomach in the Acland Nursing Home, Oxford, on 16 September 1956.<br>
