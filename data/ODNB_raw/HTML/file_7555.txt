<span class="headword">Despenser,  Thomas</span>, second Lord Despenser  (1373&#150;1400), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the sole surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7550/', "Edward Despenser, first Lord Despenser (1336&#150;1375)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth Burghersh (<i>d</i>. 1409). Born on 22 September 1373 he was two years old when his father died in 1375, and he remained in royal wardship until 1394. His marriage was granted on 16 April 1378 to Richard II's uncle Edmund of Langley, earl of Cambridge 
    (afterwards duke of York; 1341&#150;1402)
  , whose only daughter, Constance [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57622/', "Despenser, Constance, Lady Despenser (c.1375&#150;1416)")</script>], Despenser married before he was seven years old. As a royal ward he became one of the young king's personal friends and gained influence at court. He also had links with two of Richard II's opponents; at the age of fifteen he was serving with Richard (III) Fitzalan, earl of Arundel (<i>d</i>. 1397), who was admiral of England, and in 1391 he joined the king's youngest uncle, Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester, on his unlucky crusade to Prussia, an expedition which got no further than the coast of Norway.<br>
<br>The political power enjoyed by the house of York in the later years of Richard II's reign was a consequence of the king's affection for his cousin, Edmund of Langley's elder son, Edward, earl of Rutland (<i>c</i>.1373&#150;1415). It was as Rutland's brother-in-law that Despenser joined the court party of young nobles whose support enabled Richard II to carry out his successful <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> in July 1397. When parliament met at Westminster on 21 September, Despenser was one of a group of eight courtier lords who appealed of treason the king's enemies, Gloucester, Arundel, and Warwick. Despenser's reward was the title of earl of Gloucester (29 September); his great-grandmother Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1337), who married Hugh Despenser the younger, was the eldest sister and coheiress of Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1314). He also received a large share of the forfeited estates of the vanquished. His spoils included Elmley Castle, six manors in Worcestershire, and the Welsh marcher lordship of Elfael, all formerly belonging to the earl of Warwick. He was granted for life the constableship of Gloucester Castle and the wardenship of the Forest of Dean. In the Shrewsbury parliament of January 1398, Despenser obtained the reversal of the judgements passed in 1321 and 1327 on his ancestors, the two Hugh Despensers.<br>
<br>Despenser's gains gave him reason to uphold Richard II's autocracy during the last two years of his reign. He was one of the king's chief lieutenants when his second expedition to Ireland took place early in the summer of 1399, and he commanded the rearguard of the royal army. He was sent to treat with the Irish king of Leinster, Art M&oacute;r mac Murchadha, but he failed to bring him to terms; their meeting in a glen in Wicklow is depicted in one of the well-known illustrations to the manuscript of Jean Creton's chronicle of the deposition of Richard II. The outbreak of the revolution in England, which followed Henry Bolingbroke's landing at Ravenspur in Yorkshire late in June, compelled the king to abandon his Irish campaign. According to Adam Usk, after Richard disembarked at Pembroke on 22 July he sent Despenser to rally the men of Glamorgan on the king's behalf, but the inhabitants refused to obey the summons of their marcher lord. When the fallen king met Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, at Conwy Castle, Despenser was one of the eight persons for whose safety Richard stipulated, but, like the rest of the king's former courtiers, he deserted once Richard's cause was lost. He was one of the seven commissioners appointed to pronounce the sentence of Richard II's deposition on 30 September 1399. In the first parliament of Henry IV's reign Despenser was one of five lords who had appealed the king's enemies of treason in 1397 now called upon to answer for their conduct two years earlier; Despenser denied that he had had any share in the responsibility for the death of the duke of Gloucester. He was punished by degradation from his earldom (3 November), the loss of the lands and offices granted to him in 1397, and a short spell of imprisonment in the Tower of London. He evidently contemplated withdrawing from English politics and going on a new crusading venture, either to Prussia or to Rhodes, and it would have been better for him if he had kept to that resolution.<br>
<br>Early in January 1400 Despenser joined the earls of Kent, Huntingdon, and Salisbury in a bid to restore the deposed Richard II to the throne. Popular support for Henry IV soon made the attempted rising a fiasco, and, having narrowly escaped capture at Cirencester, Despenser fled to Glamorgan, where he took ship at Cardiff, intending to seek refuge abroad. Instead the captain of the ship took him to Bristol, where he was seized and afterwards summarily executed on 13 January. He was buried at Tewkesbury Abbey. His unpopularity is reflected in the rumour that he had poisoned the late duke of Gloucester's young son, Humphrey, who had died in August 1399, shortly after Despenser's return from Richard II's Irish expedition.<br>
<br>Despenser had three children with his wife, Constance; his only son, Richard, born on 30 November 1396, married <i>c</i>.1408 Eleanor Neville (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1472), one of the four daughters of Ralph, first earl of Westmorland (<i>d</i>. 1425), and his second wife, Joan Beaufort. Richard Despenser died childless possibly on 7 October 1413 (and certainly by 16 April 1414) while still a minor in royal wardship, and with his death the male line of his family was extinguished. Thomas Despenser's eventual heir was his posthumous child, Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1439), born at Cardiff on 26 July 1400; she married first Richard Beauchamp (1396&#150;1422), who was created earl of Worcester in 1421, and second his cousin, Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (1382&#150;1439).<br>
