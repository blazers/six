<span class="headword">Thompson, Sir  John Sparrow David</span>  (1845&#150;1894), <span class="occ">lawyer and prime minister of Canada</span>, was born at 5 Argyle Street, Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 10 November 1845, the seventh and last child of John Sparrow Thompson and Charlotte Pottinger. His father was an Irish Methodist who went to Nova Scotia from Waterford in 1827 and became printer to the crown. He taught his shy, quiet son shorthand, and in the 1860s the two became reporters of the assembly debates. The younger Thompson attended the Royal Acadian School and then the Free Church Academy until 1860, and was admitted to the bar in 1865 and began law practice. His father died in 1867 and he became the sole support of his mother and an unmarried sister. On 5 July 1870 he married Annie Emma Affleck (1845&#150;1913), a Roman Catholic; but it was only when she was pregnant with their first child that Thompson was baptized a Roman Catholic. That baptism was the conclusion of his intense search for theological certainties.<br>
<br>In 1871 Thompson was elected alderman in Ward 5, the largest of Halifax's six wards, and remained on the city council until 1877, when he was elected to the provincial assembly for Antigonish, a Roman Catholic county, as a Conservative. With the victory of his party in the general election of 1878 he was made attorney-general. He was premier by 1882, when he resigned to become a judge on the supreme court of Nova Scotia, at thirty-six years of age the youngest on that bench and usually the youngest in the courtroom.<br>
<br>Thompson was a good judge, liking the m&eacute;tier, and his decisions were liberal; in criminal cases he was charitable where evidence was not clear, but firm, even unforgiving, when it was, especially in cases of cruelty to women or children. He loved justice as he hated iniquity; it was a fire that burnt inside him.<br>
<br>In 1885 the federal government of Sir John A. Macdonald desperately needed new strength. Too many ministers were sick or worn out. That ineffectiveness led to the north-west rebellion in March 1885. The Nova Scotia MPs urged Macdonald to appoint Thompson to the cabinet, but Thompson did not want to go; he liked his life as a legal monk. His wife, Annie, however, thought her young and talented husband needed sterner challenges than sitting with the &#145;sere old crows&#146;, as she called them, on the supreme court of Nova Scotia  (National Archives of Canada, J. S. D. Thompson MSS, vol. 283, Annie Thompson to Thompson, 5 Nov 1885). She pushed him out of the house on the long way to Ottawa. In 1885 he resigned his judgeship, was sworn in as minister of justice, and was elected, with some difficulty, as MP for Antigonish.<br>
<br>The main burden of the defence of the government after the crisis over the hanging of Louis Riel in November 1885 fell upon the new minister of justice. Thompson had not been involved in that decision, but he took on the responsibility for dealing with its political consequences in parliament. His maiden speech was the first ringing defence of the government that the party had heard in the whole anguished Riel debate. He did not seek to convince by sounding phrases but by force of argument, by sheer good sense, and by his transparent fairness. It was a splendid success. Within two years he had become indispensable to Macdonald. In deciding the difficult questions of Canadian copyright, North American fisheries, and Bering Sea sealing, all of which arose between 1885 and 1894, Thompson could be counted on to produce an elegant, comprehensive, and luminous state paper. Macdonald had never had a minister like him. Thompson's work in the 1887&#150;8 fisheries negotiations with the United States won him a KCMG.<br>
<br>By this time Thompson's family was established in Ottawa, greatly to his relief. He was a passionate family man: an uxorious husband, a solicitous, devoted father of the five of nine children who lived to maturity, he revelled in their company and that of his wife. Macdonald was quite wistful when he saw Thompson with his children.<br>
<br>After Macdonald's death on 6 June 1891 there was a cabinet crisis over his successor. A section of the Conservative Party from Ontario baulked at a Roman Catholic prime minister, and a compromise candidate, Senator J. J. C. Abbott, was selected, with the consequence that Thompson led in the House of Commons, Abbott in the senate.<br>
<br>The biggest problem facing the government in 1891 was the Langevin scandal, alleged corruption in Hector Louis Langevin's department of public works. The government had won the general election of 1891 only narrowly, with a 27-seat majority in a 215-seat house. The scandal was made to order for the Liberal opposition; fourteen defections from the government side would put them into power. With the Langevin scandal hot and ready to serve, the Liberals protested over fifty individual elections, aiming to unseat the government. It was a disaster for the Liberals. The result of Thompson's bringing facts into the open, and forcing the offending minister out, was to defeat that strategy. It gave the government in 1892 a new majority of something like sixty-five seats, a majority it had not enjoyed for a decade.<br>
<br>That big majority ensured passage of Thompson's new Canadian criminal code of 1892. It was based on Fitzjames Stephen's proposed criminal code of 1879, redrafted to suit Canadian conditions. The rest of Thompson's domestic agenda lay mainly in the difficult Manitoba school question. He counted on the courts to settle it, but the privy council unhinged that; it needed political solutions, and lay on his desk as he became prime minister on Abbott's resignation late in 1892.<br>
<br>In March 1893 Thompson went to Paris as one of two British judges in an international tribunal to settle the Canadian&#150;American dispute over sealing in the Bering Sea. The tribunal decided in favour of Canada. In June 1894 Thompson held in Ottawa the first intercolonial conference convened outside England. That autumn he went to London to be sworn in as member of the privy council, and to see doctors about his health. The doctors were optimistic. On Wednesday 12 December he went down to Windsor to be sworn in; the ceremony was brief, but at lunch he felt faint, then suddenly collapsed. He was dead of a massive heart attack, aged forty-nine. His body was sent back to Canada in HMS <i>Blenheim</i>, a mark of the British government's esteem; he was buried in Holy Cross cemetery, Halifax, in a state funeral on 3 January 1895.<br>
<br>Thompson was a considerable lawyer. If not widely read, he had an incisive, rapid, and systematic mind which grasped facts quickly; that was joined to a vast capacity for work. The result was an extraordinary intelligence. He wore it all quietly. His was a mind unclouded by prejudice; Canada lost a prime minister with rare gifts, most of all the &#145;onward look of that untrammelled mind&#146;  (St John, <span class="italic">Daily Sun</span>, 4 Jan 1895).<br>
