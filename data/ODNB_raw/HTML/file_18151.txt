<span class="headword">Marshall,  Thomas William</span>  (1818&#150;1877), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic controversialist</span>, was the son of John Marshall, government agent for emigration to New South Wales. After attending Archdeacon Burney's school in Greenwich, in October 1835 he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge; he migrated a year later to Trinity, from which he graduated BA in 1840. After ordination the same year he was appointed curate of Swallowcliffe and Anstey, Wiltshire, and on 8 July 1845 he married Harriet, the daughter of the Revd William Dansey, rector of Donhead St Andrew, Wiltshire.<br>
<br>Marshall and his wife were received into the Roman Catholic church at Wardour in November 1845. Poverty drove them abroad for a time, but in 1848 he was appointed an inspector of schools, with responsibility for Catholic schools in the southern counties of England and Wales. The ill feeling aroused by his pamphlet <span class="italic">Christianity in China</span> (1858), which subjected protestant missionary methods to ridicule, led to his resignation in 1860. His major work, <span class="italic">Christian Missions</span>, published in three volumes in 1862, though partisan, was thoroughly researched and widely acclaimed. Subsequently Marshall made several lecture tours in the United States, where his forceful and incisive style was much appreciated. In 1873 he received the honorary degree of LLD from Georgetown University. On his return from America he continued his career as a polemical writer and journalist, attacking the Church of England in abrasive style. He died at Surbiton, Surrey, on 14 December 1877, and was buried at Mortlake. He was survived by his wife, son, and daughter. His brothers Frederick and Arthur were also converts to Roman Catholicism.<br>
