<span class="headword">Campbell, Lord  Neil, of Ardmaddie</span>  (<em>c.</em>1630&#150;1692), <span class="occ">colonial speculator</span>, was the second of six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4472/', "Archibald Campbell, marquess of Argyll (1605x7&#150;1661)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Margaret (1610&#150;1678), second daughter of William Douglas, seventh earl of Morton; his parents lived mainly at Inveraray, Argyll. He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4473/', "Archibald Campbell, ninth earl of Argyll (d. 1685)")</script>. It is likely that Lord Neil's formal education began at home, but in 1645 he attended classes at the University of Glasgow. From 1647 to 1649, he and his elder brother made a grand tour of France and Italy. Notwithstanding their father's political ascendancy as covenanter leader during the civil wars of the 1640s, and his political accommodation with Cromwell during the interregnum, there is little extant documentation highlighting Lord Neil's political stance or activities during this period. When, after the restoration of Charles II in 1660, Argyll was indicted for high treason, Lord Neil travelled to London to deal with his father's affairs, but was unable to prevent his execution in May 1661. On 23 January 1668 Lord Neil married his cousin Lady Vere Ker (1649&#150;1674), third daughter of the third earl of Lothian. The couple had two sons, the younger of whom was the Scottish episcopal bishop <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4475/', "Archibald Campbell")</script>, and three daughters; it is likely that they spent most of their short married life at Ardmaddie Castle, Argyll.<br>
<br>During the following decade, Lord Neil assisted his brother in the ongoing feud between the Campbell and Gillean clans by leading two invasions on Maclean lands in Mull. As staunch presbyterians and covenanters, both Lord Neil and his brother opposed Charles II's enforced return to episcopacy. Events, centring on the earl's reservations in signing the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, conspired to precipitate Argyll's forfeiture and flight to Holland in 1681, and in consequence, to Lord Neil being constantly under suspicion. To provide himself with a transatlantic refuge if the political situation in Scotland became too dangerous, and to shore up his dwindling wealth, Lord Neil participated in colonial ventures in the Americas. First he became a leading undertaker of the little-known Carolina Company, a company set up in 1681 to break into the Anglo-American trade by establishing a colony at Port Royal on the Ashley River, South Carolina; and second, he became an active participator and fractioner in the infant colony of East New Jersey set up by Robert Barclay of Ury. Along with his business partner, Robert Blackwood, an Edinburgh merchant, Lord Neil invested &pound;1100 sterling in transporting servants and goods to East New Jersey, and in buying 8000 acres of land on the Rariton River and a 12-acre site and two plots by the sound in the colony's capital, Perth Amboy.<br>
<br>In 1685, possibly in March, Lord Neil married his second wife, Susan, eldest daughter of Sir Alexander Menzies of Weem; they had four children. On his brother's return from exile and rebellion against the Stuart monarchy in August 1685, Lord Neil was held under bond in Edinburgh, but was subsequently allowed to sail for East New Jersey. The following year he became the colony's third deputy governor. However, in 1687 he requested the council's permission to resign his position and return to Scotland, where he took up the post of governor of Dumbarton Castle, though he lived mainly at Nether Lorn, Argyll. Despite his colonial ventures and the income from his extensive estates in Lorne and Kintyre, Lord Neil was in considerable debt when he died in April 1692. He was buried on 11 April in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh. By a disposition, dated 8 July 1693, his eldest son and heir, Charles, made over all his inheritance to the earl of Breadalbane for &pound;20,000 Scots (&pound;1666 sterling) and relief of all debts and claims against Lord Neil.<br>
