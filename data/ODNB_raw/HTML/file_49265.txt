<span class="headword">Erik Bloodaxe</span> <span class="st"> [Eir&iacute;kr Bl&oacute;&eth;&ouml;x, Eir&iacute;kr Haraldsson]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 954), <span class="occ">viking leader and king of Northumbria</span>, was the son of Harald Haarfagre (&#145;Harald Fairhair&#146;), king of Norway (<i>fl</i>. 872?&#150;<i>c</i>.930). The identity of his father can be inferred from the report of version E of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, which describes him as &#145;Harold's son&#146; (<i>Haroldes sunu</i>, <span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 952, text E). Few facts about Erik are as reliably attested. Although the various extant versions of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> are the most contemporary and dependable written sources for Erik, they nevertheless differ in their narratives of his career in Britain. The faint image of Erik in the near contemporary evidence contrasts with the strongly drawn portrayal of a warrior king in the Icelandic sagas of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Although the saga writers' information is often demonstrably defective, it offers an attractive richness of detail that has led to attempts to vindicate some, at least, of their stories about Erik, in order to construct a coherent narrative of his life. The motivation for such attempts is, above all, the prominence that Erik has in the saga literature, in which his profile is uniquely high for a tenth-century Scandinavian king in the British Isles. Why he attained this status in Scandinavian culture, typified by the epithet Bloodaxe (Bl&oacute;&eth;&ouml;x), which was first coined by <span class="italic">Egils saga</span> of the late twelfth century, is an enduring puzzle.<br>
<br>Slotting together the annals in the two principal versions of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> for this period, texts D and E, produces a continuous narrative for Erik's career in Britain. His first appearance, in an annal for 948, records his selection as their king by the Northumbrians, meaning the inhabitants of the kingdom centred on York, formerly known as Deira. By this act the Northumbrians reneged on a pledge that they had made shortly before to King Eadred (<i>r</i>. 946&#150;55), whose response was to invade and ravage Northumbria, burning down St Wilfrid's minster at Ripon. As the English army returned southward, the army of York overtook its rearguard at Castleford, and &#145;made a great slaughter there&#146;. When an enraged Eadred threatened to return to Northumbria and &#145;destroy it utterly&#146;, however, the Northumbrians abandoned Erik and paid reparations to the English king  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 948, text D). If text E of the chronicle is correct, the Northumbrians' loyalty once again proved fickle, for its annal for 949 records the arrival in Northumbria, for the second time, of &Oacute;l&aacute;f Sihtricson. According to text E, in 952 &Oacute;l&aacute;f in turn was driven out, and the Northumbrians again received Erik as their king. Both versions agree that Erik was expelled for the final time in 954, &#145;and Eadred succeeded to the kingdom of the Northumbrians&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 954, texts D, E). A twelfth-century Durham tradition records that after his expulsion Erik was killed by a certain Maccus, son of &Oacute;l&aacute;f. The <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> of Roger of Wendover (<i>d</i>. 1236), which includes material drawn from an earlier lost set of northern annals, adds that Erik was betrayed, with his son Henricus (H&aelig;ric, Erik) and his brother Reginaldus (Ragnall), by Earl Oswulf of Bamburgh, and was treacherously killed by Maccus on Steinmor&#151;that is, Stainmore, across which runs the Roman road (the modern A66) from York to Cumbria. Oswulf then became earl of all Northumbria.<br>
<br>While this narrative is coherent as far as it goes, others are possible, for the chronology of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> for this period is extremely confused. In particular, version E's annals dated 949 and 952 may be as awry as that entered under 948, which records the death of Edmund and accession of Eadred, the true date of which is 946. The sixth section of the <span class="italic">Historia regum</span> attributed to Symeon of Durham (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1090&#150;<i>c</i>.1128), which preserves from an earlier northern source annals covering some of these events, often under different dates, only complicates matters further. The evidence of southern English charters suggests that Eadred did not claim to rule over the Northumbrians from 947/8 to 948/9 and from 950/51 to 951/2, leaving room for the sequence of short reigns at York that the standard narrative envisages, that is, Erik&#150;Eadred&#150;&Oacute;l&aacute;f&#150;Erik. Taking account of the severe dislocation of the annals' dates, however, suggests a different sequence, giving Erik only one reign at York. The two different coin types inscribed with Erik's name may correspond to his two supposed reigns, or may represent two issues in a single reign. The contemporary and near contemporary sources offer little certainty as to Erik's status in Northumbria: his influence appears to have been less important than that of Wulfstan, archbishop of York, whose attitude towards him remains frustratingly unclear. Such sources also record a Scottish raid as far as the Tees in 948 or 949, which may have been directed against, or mounted in favour of, Erik, though the protagonist could just as easily have been &Oacute;l&aacute;f Sihtricson. Similarly, it is not certain that, as sometimes suggested, Erik was the leader of the Scandinavian force that the Irish annals attest as defeating a combined army of Scots, Strathclyde Britons, and Bamburgh English in the battle that they date to 952.<br>
<br>Erik appears in a brighter light in the sagas written in Iceland in the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries, principally the sagas of H&aacute;kon the Good (<span class="italic">H&aacute;konar saga G&oacute;da</span>) and of Harald Finehair (<span class="italic">Haralds saga ins H&aacute;rfagra</span>) in <span class="italic">Heimskringla</span> by Snorri Sturluson (<i>d</i>. 1241), <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, <span class="italic">Egils saga</span>, and the longer saga of &Oacute;l&aacute;f Tryggvason (<span class="italic">&Oacute;l&aacute;fs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta</span>). These allege that Erik's mother was Ragnhild, the daughter of a Danish king. Erik is said to have begun his viking career at the age of twelve. On an expedition to the White Sea he discovered his wife, Gunnhild, the daughter either of one &Ouml;zurr T&oacute;ti, or of Gorm inn Gamli (Gorm the Old), king of Denmark. She is said to have practised witchcraft. Erik became king in Norway after the death of his father, Harald, and slew several of his brothers and rivals, before being ousted by his younger brother H&aacute;kon, who had been brought up at the court of King &AElig;thelstan (<i>d</i>. 939) in England. Erik made his way to Orkney, where he immediately commanded the loyalty of the joint earls, Arnkel and Erlend, sons of Einarr (<i>fl</i>. 900). He was then placed in charge of the Northumbrian kingdom by &AElig;thelstan, and fixed his residence at York. Having been displaced by &Oacute;l&aacute;f Sihtricson during Edmund's reign, he undertook plundering expeditions in the neighbouring lands, but was eventually killed in battle against &Oacute;l&aacute;f, along with the Orkney earls and five other princes. The sagas record the names of two of his children: Ragnhild, whom the thirteenth-century <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> portrays as a power-hungry schemer who married three earls of Orkney in succession, and Harald Gr&aacute;feld (Harald Greycloak) (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.970), who became king of Norway.<br>
<br>A funeral lay for Erik, <span class="italic">Eir&iacute;ksm&aacute;l</span>, reputedly written at Gunnhild's instigation soon after he was killed, is included in the saga <span class="italic">Fagrskinna</span>. Only the opening fragment, in which the god Odin welcomes Erik into Valhalla, survives. Erik also appears in <span class="italic">Egils saga</span>, as the enemy of the famous psychopath and poet Egill Skallagr&iacute;msson. When he came before Erik at York, Egill was allowed to redeem his head after he eulogized the king in the praise poem <span class="italic">H&ouml;fudlausn</span> (&#145;The head-saver&#146;). Notwithstanding this kingly act of clemency, the Icelandic texts generally give Erik a bad press, probably because of their antipathy towards centralized royal authority rather than through any reliance on genuine historical tradition. They are largely responsible for his enduring reputation for ferocious barbarism, cataloguing as they do a career of plunder and homicide remarkable even among tenth-century vikings. The contemporary evidence suggests that in fact Erik was no more violent than other kings and warlords of the time.<br>
<br>Lacking a historical basis, the saga's stories add no reliable information to Erik's biography, but there are hints that not all of them are entirely fictional. Although it receives no support from the annals, a link between Erik and the famous &AElig;thelstan became current relatively early. The life of St Catroe, written <i>c</i>.1000 by a monk who apparently knew the saint, recounts Catroe's journey, to be dated apparently to 939&#150;40, from his native Strathclyde to the continent, visiting on the way a King Erich in York and King Edmund in England. The dating indicates that King Erich could have been appointed by &AElig;thelstan, and his presence at York would fill a gap in the sources for Northumbria between the battle of &#145;Brunanburh&#146; in 937 and the advent of Olaf Guthfrithson in 940; there is, however, no explicit statement that this Erich is identical with Erik Bloodaxe. Tales of Erik's plundering Strathclyde, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland may be less fanciful, since it is likely, as the sagas report, that he did not dare to deprive the Northumbrians of their land in order to reward his followers, and had to turn to viking raids instead. It should be noted, however, that no Irish source reports raiders answering to the description of Erik and his men at this period.<br>
<br>Erik Bloodaxe embodies the contrasts that characterize the modern perception of the viking world, and it is in this that his true significance lies. He was a warrior chieftain in fact and, even more so, in fable. He was a viking leader from the Norwegian royal dynasty, apparently opposed equally to the Dublin&#150;York dynasty of Scandinavian rulers, represented by &Oacute;l&aacute;f Sihtricson, and to the West Saxon kings. The range of his activity, straddling the North Sea and the entire north British mainland, would only be enhanced if he can be identified with the &#145;&Eacute;iric, king of the Isles&#146; mentioned in the twelfth-century Irish saga <span class="italic">Caithr&eacute;im Chellach&aacute;in Chaisil</span>. Despite the decided heathenism of <span class="italic">Eir&iacute;ksm&aacute;l</span>, he was clearly not antipathetic towards Christianity: he is said to have given Catroe a favourable reception, and his name appears, as &#145;Eiric rex Danorum&#146; (&#145;Erik, king of the Danes&#146;)&#151;probably indicating the origin of many of his subjects&#151;in the contemporary commemoration book (<span class="italic">Liber vitae</span>) of the church of Durham. This is a surprising memorial for one whose funeral lay has Odin praise him &#145;because he has reddened his sword in many a land &hellip; and carried a bloodstained blade&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eir&iacute;ksm&aacute;l</span>, 97).<br>
