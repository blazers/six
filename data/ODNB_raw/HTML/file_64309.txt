<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Farley family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1698&#150;1775), <span class="occ">printers and publishers</span>, played an important role in the introduction and development of printing and newspaper publication in Exeter, Bristol, Salisbury, and Bath. A family prone to enter into personal and political confrontation, the latter largely in the tory if not the Jacobite cause, they were influential in developing a newspaper press that became highly politicized in the south-west compared with local newspapers published in most other regions of eighteenth-century England. There has been much dispute over the precise relationships of the members of this complex family, particularly in the first decades of the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_61030"></a><span class="headword">Samuel [i] Farley</span>  (<em>c.</em>1675&#150;1730), <span class="occ">printer</span>, the first member of the family to be active in the newspaper trade, was probably the son of Edward [i] Farley (or Farlow), yeoman, of Twining, Gloucestershire. He was apprenticed to the London printer Freeman Collins, citizen and stationer, on 6 May 1689 and became a freeman of the Stationers' Company on 4 September 1699. By 1698 he had moved to Exeter, where he became the partner of Samuel Darker, the city's first resident printer. He lived in the parishes of St Paul and, later, St Lawrence and had offices in the High Street and thereafter St Peter's Churchyard. After Darker's death, in London in 1700, Farley continued in business alone, among the first works that he saw through the press being John Prince's <span class="italic">Danmonii orientales illustres, or, The Worthies of Devon</span> (1701), a folio of 600 pages with woodcut coats of arms. He also printed several of the Latin works of the Exeter medical practitioner and antiquary William Musgrave. About 1704 Farley established the first known Exeter newspaper, <span class="italic">Sam. Farley's Exeter Post-Man</span>, of which only issue 556, for 10 August 1711, survives. From 1705 to 1707 he was the partner of the Exeter printer Joseph Bliss, who in 1709 began a rival newspaper. In 1713 Farley issued the first number of <span class="italic">Sam. Farley's Bristol Post-Man</span>, the first surviving issue of which (no. 24) is dated 15 July 1713, with stray issues surviving until 28 January 1716.<br>
<br>Farley seems to have maintained his Exeter office for two or three years, possibly with the assistance of the bookseller Philip Bishop, and on 24 September 1714 he started the <span class="italic">Exeter Mercury</span>. On 30 September 1715 he gave details in his Exeter paper of an agreement whereby he had contracted with Philip Bishop that henceforth he should print the news in Exeter. This was just three days after the first issue of the <span class="italic">Salisbury Post-Man</span> had appeared from his new office &#145;adjoyning to Mr. Robert Silcock's on the Ditch in Sarum&#146;. Farley overstretched himself in this venture, which seems to have been short-lived. He appears to have relinquished his Exeter office in 1715 but to have continued printing in Bristol from his premises in St Nicholas Street until at least 1721. In May 1723 he or his son, also named Samuel [ii], was in Exeter to establish <span class="italic">Farley's Exeter Journal</span>. By May 1726 this was being run by another son, Edward [ii], as Samuel [i] had now concentrated his activities in his premises in Wine Street, Bristol, where in April 1725, after the new <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>, he had started <span class="italic">Farley's Bristol Newspaper</span>. Samuel [i] died 18 August 1730 in Bristol, after which date the newspaper was continued by his son, <a name="cosubject_64309"></a><span class="headword">Samuel [ii] Farley</span>  (1699&#150;1753), <span class="occ">printer</span>. He was born probably in Exeter and moved with his father to Bristol. In 1718 he was involved, with his father, in a chancery grant infringement lawsuit brought by the Stationers' Company. In 1723 he appears to have returned to Exeter to establish <span class="italic">Farley's Exeter Journal</span> but this was handed over to his brother Edward [ii] by May 1726, probably because he himself had returned to Bristol to assist his father in publishing <span class="italic">Farley's Bristol Newspaper</span>. After his father's death he continued the newspaper, starting a new sequence of numbering that was maintained when the title was changed in March 1734 to <span class="italic">Sam. Farley's Bristol Newspaper</span>, probably because a second brother, Felix Farley, had now started business at a different address in Bristol. In 1731 Samuel [ii] caused controversy when he reprinted a letter taken from the <span class="italic">Craftsman</span> that revealed England's foreign policy to her continental rivals. By August 1741 the title had become <span class="italic">Farley's Bristol Journal</span>, probably to reflect the partnership between Samuel and Felix, now at the same premises, between 1737 and 1741. Between 1740 and 1742 the brothers ran a printing office in Pontypool that produced Welsh-language publications. In 1741 Samuel [ii] moved to Bath, returning to Bristol in 1746 to form an independent printing office. In January 1748 he rejoined Felix and for a short period they each published the newspaper on alternate weeks, with differing titles, until, from 30 January of that year, they settled on the simple title of the <span class="italic">Bristol Journal</span>. In March 1752 a quarrel led Felix to set up a rival newspaper. Samuel [ii] died in Bristol on 15 December 1753, after a long illness. His will was proved in the prerogative court of Canterbury on 9 February 1754. His printing business he left to his niece Sarah Farley (<i>d</i>. 1774), daughter of Edward [ii], who had run the newspaper during her uncle's long illness, provided that she carried on the paper and joined the Quakers. To his sister-in-law Elizabeth Farley, widow of Felix, and to her son Samuel [iii] he left only 1<i>s</i>. each, reflecting the animosity within the family. Samuel [ii] had printed Quaker publications since 1742 and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at Redcliffe, Bristol.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64310"></a><span class="headword">Edward [ii] Farley</span>  (<em>c.</em>1705&#150;1729), <span class="occ">printer</span>, brother of Samuel [ii], is recorded in Bath and Bristol as a defendant in a chancery grant infringement lawsuit brought by the Stationers' Company in 1718. He took over the publication of <span class="italic">Farley's Exeter Journal</span> from his father, Samuel [i], or from his elder brother, Samuel [ii], in or before May 1726 from premises at the sign of Shakespeare's Head, opposite the Guildhall, Exeter. His career proved to be short and disastrous. He soon incurred the hatred of Andrew Brice, the printer of <span class="italic">Brice's Weekly Journal</span>, and an acrimonious quarrel was conducted in their two newspapers. In August 1728 Brice challenged Farley to reprint the libel on George II, known as the &#145;Persian letter&#146;, which had appeared in the London newspaper <span class="italic">Mist's Weekly Journal</span> on 24 August. The hapless Farley took up this challenge all too promptly in the issue of his <span class="italic">Exeter Journal</span> dated 30 August. He was immediately arrested, put in irons, and cast into Exeter gaol. Brice triumphantly printed the presentments at the October quarter sessions in 18 October. For a time Farley was held in Newgate but was returned to Exeter in time for his trial, which opened on 31 March 1729. As only two witnesses for the crown were forthcoming, one a man of bad character and the other Farley's son-in-law, who would speak only on compulsion, the attorney-general recommended that the prosecution should not proceed, and an order was made for Farley's release. This came too late for Edward [ii], who had died in Exeter gaol in May 1729, thus earning a place as one of the first victims of a libel prosecution in the English provincial press.<br>
<br>Other members of the Farley family had continued the newspaper while Edward [ii] was in prison and an unnamed newspaper, printed by his son Edward [iii] throughout the 1730s, is recorded in the Courtenay family account books, although no copies appear to survive. Edward [iii] was imprisoned in 1742 on a charge of evading stamp duty. A notable publication of his, Ezra Cleaveland's <span class="italic">A Genealogical History of the Noble and Illustrious Family of Courtenay</span>, appeared in 1735. His address then was Shakespeare's Head, near Eastgate, Exeter. Sarah, daughter of Edward [ii], took over the Bristol newspaper of her uncle Samuel [ii] after his death in 1753 with the aid of Samuel's foreman, Samuel Bonner, and Richard Middleton, and ran it until her death in 1774, having been joined by Mark Farley, who was probably her brother, by 1762. She never married but was prominent in local literary circles, Hannah More being among her friends. She left the paper to her cousin Hester, daughter of Felix and Elizabeth Farley.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64312"></a><span class="headword">Mark Farley</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1766), <span class="occ">printer</span>, was probably the son of Edward [ii]. In partnership with other members of the family he printed in 1745 the first edition of the frequently reprinted work <span class="italic">The Life and Adventures of Bampfylde Moore Carew</span>. In 1754 he was sentenced to one year's imprisonment for printing a seditious song on the anniversary of the Pretender's birthday. By 1758 he was in Bristol, where he assisted Sarah Farley in the <span class="italic">Bristol Journal</span>. He died in Bristol in June 1766; his burial was recorded in the Society of Friends' register on 21 June.<br>
<br>Mark's uncle <a name="cosubject_64311"></a><span class="headword">Felix Farley</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1708, <em>d.</em> 1753), <span class="occ">printer</span>, son of Samuel [i], was baptized in St Lawrence's Church, Exeter, on 3 October 1708. He was printing in Bath at Shakespeare's Head, without Westgate, in 1732 and started business in Bristol at the same shop sign in 1734, in separate premises from his brother Samuel [ii]. Among the items printed in these years was an edition of <span class="italic">Bristol: the City Charters</span>, an anti-corporation publication issued in 1736. From 1737 to 1741 the two brothers were in partnership, publishing <span class="italic">Farley's Bristol Journal</span> from the same address. Felix revisited Exeter in 1741 to revive <span class="italic">Farley's Exeter Weekly Journal</span>, of which only issue 33, for 11 December 1741, survives, while in the same year Samuel left Bristol for Bath. In 1743, at premises in Castle Green, Bristol, Felix began to produce two separate newspapers with different numberings on alternate weeks, <span class="italic">Felix Farley's Bristol Journal</span> and <span class="italic">Farley's Bristol Advertiser</span>, the latter described as being printed by Farley and Company; this was a device to avoid stamp duty and was dropped by Farley in August 1746. From January 1748 Samuel [ii] was again in partnership with Felix; together they published the <span class="italic">Bristol Journal</span> until in April 1752, after their quarrel, Felix set up the rival <span class="italic">Felix Farley's Bristol Journal</span> in premises in Small Street, still at the sign of Shakespeare's Head. Felix died of consumption in April 1753, a few months before his brother Samuel [ii], to whom he left only 1 guinea, praying to God &#145;that his eyes may be opened that he may see the injury he has done me and my poor family&#146;. He had been a Wesleyan Methodist and left 1 guinea also to both John and Charles Wesley. In 1744 he had printed <span class="italic">Hymns and Sacred Poems</span>, collected by John Wesley, as well as many other Wesleyan publications; part of the family conflict may therefore have been religious, since Samuel [ii] had Quaker sympathies.<br>
<br>Felix's widow, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1779), continued the newspaper from premises in Small Street, Bristol, in partnership with her son Samuel [iii] (<i>d</i>. 1786?). Samuel [iii] left for Bath in 1756 to found the short-lived <span class="italic">Farley's Bath Journal</span> but was again in partnership with his mother from 1758 to 1760. He then left for America, where imprints are recorded in New York in 1772, and probably died in the Bahamas in 1786. Elizabeth was an active printer and was several times in dispute with the corporation. In 1767 she took as a partner Thomas Cocking, who began printing on his own account in 1771, and took over the newspaper completely in 1773. She died on 28 May 1779, aged sixty-five, and was buried in the Quaker burial-ground, Bristol. Hester, the daughter of Elizabeth and Felix, was born on 7 September 1750 and was left the <span class="italic">Bristol Journal</span> by her cousin Sarah, daughter of Edward [ii] Farley, on her death in 1774. After problems with the printers Bonner and Middleton, Hester sold the paper in 1775 to George and William Routh and Charles Nelson, who had earlier married her sister Elizabeth. Hester married Thomas Rutter, a Quaker, in 1780. When Nelson left the partnership the Rouths renamed the paper <span class="italic">Sarah Farley's Bristol Journal</span> and continued to publish it into the nineteenth century, although by that time there appears no longer to have been any connection with the Farley family.<br>
