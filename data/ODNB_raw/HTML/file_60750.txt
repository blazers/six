<span class="headword">Hopkinson,  Henry Lennox D'Aubign&eacute;</span>, first Baron Colyton  (1902&#150;1996), <span class="occ">diplomatist and politician</span>, was born on 3 January 1902 at 78 Holland Park, Kensington, London, the eldest of three sons of Sir Henry Lennox Hopkinson (1855&#150;1936), solicitor and later almoner of St Bartholomew's Hospital, and his wife, Marie Ruan (<i>d</i>. 1949), daughter of Francis Blake Du Bois, of St Croix, Virgin Islands, and New York. He was brought up at Duntisbourne House, near Cirencester, and educated at Eton College, where he was awarded the Royal Humane Society's award for saving an airman from drowning in the Thames, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read modern languages, being already bilingual in English and French. He entered the diplomatic service in October 1924 and was posted as third secretary and private secretary to the ambassador in Washington, Sir Esme Howard. There he met and on 10 November 1927 married his first wife, Alice Labouisse Eno (<i>d</i>. 1953), the daughter of Henry Lane Eno, a professor at Princeton University. She was an elegant hostess both in Washington and subsequently at their house in Belgravia after their return to London in 1929. They had one son, Nicholas Henry Eno (1932&#150;1991), and a daughter, Olivia, Nicholas's twin, who died when four days old. Hopkinson's next posting was to Stockholm and when he returned again to London in 1932 it was as assistant private secretary to the foreign secretary, Sir John Simon. Postings to Cairo (where he acquired a knowledge of Arabic) and to Athens (where he acted as charg&eacute; d'affaires in 1938 and 1939) were followed by yet another private secretarial appointment in London&#151;this time to the permanent under-secretary, Sir Alexander Cadogan.<br>
<br>At the age of thirty-seven in 1939 Hopkinson was thought to be too old for military service, but when he was selected to be assistant to Oliver Lyttelton, minister of state in the Middle East, Cadogan reluctantly conceded &#145;as a patriot, I must agree to the best man going&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 8 Jan 1996). His further wartime service was in Lisbon, where he was instrumental in securing the Azores air base for the allies and where he was made CMG, and as deputy British high commissioner in Italy after the collapse of Mussolini. The war years had established his reputation as a smooth and competent supporting diplomat.<br>
<br>When the war ended, however, Hopkinson accepted Anthony Eden's invitation to enter politics, first as a member of the Conservative parliamentary secretariat and research department (where he had an uneasy relationship with the liberal-minded Rab Butler) and then in February 1950 as MP for Taunton. Churchill recognized him as an unusually experienced new MP and promptly made him a member of his government in November 1951, initially as a junior minister at the Board of Trade and then from May 1952 (under his wartime chief Oliver Lyttelton again) at the Colonial Office. He was made a privy councillor in 1952. As minister of state in the Colonial Office, Hopkinson toured Africa in an attempt to garner support for the short-lived Central African Federation, which was aimed partly at prolonging white domination of Southern and Northern Rhodesia as well as Nyasaland after independence. But it was the Cyprus problem that was to be Hopkinson's undoing in the House of Commons. In a debate in 1954 he effectively stated that Cyprus would never be granted independence (six years before it in fact was), and this unfortunate mis-prediction was to dog him thereafter: &#145;Never say never&#146;, Churchill is said to have commented. In the government reshuffle of December 1955 Hopkinson was predictably dropped and, although Eden offered him various overseas diplomatic appointments, he preferred to go to the back benches until the following year when he was created Baron Colyton and began to play an active part in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>Freed from office, Colyton came out in his true colours as a traditional&#151;not to say reactionary&#151;tory. He criticized Ian Macleod's decolonizing policies and the imposition of sanctions against Ian Smith's unilateral declaration of independence regime in Rhodesia, and he supported the regime of Dr Salazar (by whom he was awarded the grand cross of the order of Prince Henry the Navigator) in Portugal and Portuguese Africa. These views fitted well with his chairmanship of Tanganyika Concessions, with its European mining interests in Africa, and his other capitalist ventures. He became increasingly a figure of the extreme right in politics and in international business.<br>
<br>Colyton's first wife died in 1953 and on 11 December 1956 he married Barbara Estella Addams, the former wife of Charles Samuel Addams, the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span> cartoonist, and daughter of Stephen Barb, of New York. There were no children from this second marriage. They continued to live in the Jacobean manor house in Devon&#151;Netherton Hall&#151;which Colyton had purchased with his first wife and to which he was greatly attached. In the last years of his life, however, he and his second wife moved to Monte Carlo where he died aged ninety-four on 6 January 1996. His son had predeceased him, and the barony passed to his elder grandson, Alisdair John Munro Hopkinson (<i>b</i>. 1958).<br>
<br>With his conventional good looks, impeccable manners, ultra right-wing views and privileged career, Colyton appeared to many as almost a caricature of a defunct breed of tory grandee. But beneath the glossy&#151;some said cardboard&#151;exterior there was a sensitive man who was more vulnerable than at first appeared, and more courageous than many apparently more robust public figures.<br>
