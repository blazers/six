<span class="headword">Ogden,  Peter Skene</span>  (1789/90&#150;1854), <span class="occ">fur trader and explorer in North America</span>, was baptized on 12 February 1790 at the cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Quebec. He was the youngest of the six children of Judge Isaac Ogden (1740&#150;1824) and his second wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hanson. In 1794 the family moved to Montreal, centre of the Canadian fur trade, and in 1809 the young Ogden joined the North West Company. This was a period of fierce competition in the fur trade between the North West Company and the London-based Hudson's Bay Company, and Ogden soon earned an unenviable reputation for violence. When in 1821 the two companies agreed to a coalition, Ogden was specifically excluded from future employment; the ban was lifted when the Hudson's Bay Company realized that he would be a dangerous rival. In 1815 or 1816 he married an unknown Cree Indian woman with whom he had at least one child; when this marriage dissolved in 1818, he married Julia Rivet, a Spokan Indian, in a second &#145;country marriage&#146;, which lasted until 1854. Seven children of this marriage survived him. In 1823 he was appointed chief trader with orders to lead a trapping expedition into the Snake River country.<br>
<br>On Ogden's six Snake country expeditions between 1824 and 1830 his combative temperament was given full rein. The region extended south of the Columbia River from the continental divide to the Pacific coast, and was one of natural hazards, unpredictable Indians, and rival American traders. Accompanied by &#145;brigades&#146; of men and horses, he travelled across present-day Oregon and Idaho, and much of California, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. He discovered the Humboldt River and sighted Great Salt Lake; on his last expedition in 1830 he may have reached the Lower Colorado River and the Gulf of California. He did much to determine the geography of a region with confusing watersheds and drainage areas, at a time when existing maps showed mysterious westward-flowing rivers and inland seas.<br>
<br>For the Hudson's Bay Company exploration took second place to trapping. In 1818 the British and American governments had agreed that until a permanent boundary was established the region should be open to nationals of both countries, and company policy was to trap it bare. It was, in effect, a &#145;scorched-earth&#146; policy to keep the Americans at bay. Ogden proved the ideal man for this task, and under him the Snake country yielded 100 per cent profits. They were profits made at a cost, for even by the tough standards of the fur trade the hardships of the region were exceptional. Men and horses fell sick, were killed by Indian attack, froze in winter, and suffered from heat, lack of water, and fever in the summer. Either to explore or to trap furs was difficult across such terrain; to combine the two as Ogden did was an impressive achievement.<br>
<br>The rest of Ogden's long career was less remarkable. Promoted chief factor in 1834, he supervised the company's operations in northern British Columbia before returning to Fort Vancouver on the Columbia in 1845. Under the Oregon treaty (1846) this territory became American, and although in 1847 Ogden earned widespread respect when he negotiated the release of forty-seven American settlers taken hostage by Indians after the Whitman massacre, his last years were frustrating ones. Settlers and prospectors replaced fur traders, and in August 1854, in ill health, Ogden left the Columbia for Oregon City, where he died of a brain disease on 27 September 1854 at the age of sixty-four, and was buried.<br>
