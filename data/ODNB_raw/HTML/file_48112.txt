<span class="headword">Gundeville,  Hugh  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1181?), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, appears to have come from Somerset or Gloucestershire. He is first recorded in 1147, when, styled constable, he witnessed a charter of Robert, earl of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1147); shortly afterwards, with the same designation, he was one of the hostages for the observance of the treaty between Robert's son, Earl William (<i>d</i>. 1183), and Roger, earl of Hereford (<i>d</i>. 1155). In 1166 he was said to hold two fees of William de Mohun, lord of Dunster in Somerset, and also to have been enfeoffed with land on Earl William's demesne. In 1153 or 1154 he attested a charter of Duke Henry for St Augustine's, Bristol, and became an important royal servant when the duke became king as Henry II. In 1155/6 he had the custody of lands at Langport and Curry Rivel in Somerset, and from 1157/8 he accounted for the royal manor of King's Somborne, Hampshire. Ten years later he had custody of the honour of Basing, also in Hampshire, accounting for the aid due from its knights towards the marriage in 1168 of the king's daughter Matilda (<i>d</i>. 1189).<br>
<br>Gundeville frequently witnessed charters of Henry II and undertook a variety of duties for him, including maintenance for the royal family, purchase of horses for the king's use, and works in Winchester. In 1164 he was one of the envoys sent to the pope to put Henry II's case against Thomas Becket. In 1170 he acted for the king on Becket's return to England, and was one of the &#145;tutors&#146; of Henry, the Young King, with whom those wishing to approach the latter on Becket's behalf had to negotiate. In the following year he accompanied Henry II to Ireland, and was one of the men to whom the king entrusted the custody of Waterford, but he had left Ireland by the end of 1172, and attended the king's Christmas court at Caen.<br>
<br>From Easter 1170 Gundeville had been sheriff of Hampshire, an office he held until Michaelmas 1179. He was also sheriff of Northamptonshire from Michaelmas 1174 to Easter 1177, and of Devon from Easter 1177 to Michaelmas 1179. In 1176 and 1177 he was a justice itinerant in the midlands, and sat in the exchequer afterwards to settle business arising from the eyre. He was rewarded with pardons of scutage in Gloucestershire, Sussex, Devon, Dorset, and Somerset. He held the honour of Arundel apparently through his wife, Agnes de Falaise, with whom he was a benefactor of Boxgrove Priory, Sussex. He also gave revenues in Winchester to Goring Priory, Oxfordshire. He probably died about Easter 1181, because he ceased to hold lands entrusted to him by the king half way through the financial year 1180&#150;81. He appears to have been disposing of his estates before his death, since at Michaelmas 1181 his nephews Hamelin and Robert de Gundeville were proffering to have seisin of lands at Ham in Somerset and Tarrant Gunville in Dorset, as they had had it before the death of their uncle Hugh.<br>
