<span class="headword">Namatjira,  Albert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Elea]</span>  (1902&#150;1959), <span class="occ">Aboriginal artist</span>, was born on 28 July 1902 at the Lutheran mission of Hermannsburg (later Ntaria), Northern Territory, Australia, the second of the three children of Namatjira (1880&#150;1956) and his wife, Ljukuta (1881&#150;1934), and given the name Elea. His parents, both Western Arrernte Aboriginal people, arrived at the mission in 1902 seeking refuge from the devastating impact of European colonization. In 1905 they were received into the church: Albert and his father (who took the name Jonathon) were baptized, and his mother was blessed and received the name Emilie.<br>
<br>Albert Namatjira attended the Hermannsburg mission school, living separately from his parents in a boys' dormitory in accordance with mission practice. At the age of thirteen he spent six months in the bush, during which time he underwent initiation. He left the mission again when he was eighteen to marry Ilkalita, a Kukatja woman. The family returned to Hermannsburg in 1923 and Ilkalita (1903&#150;1974) was baptized Rubina. Eight of their children survived infancy: three daughters, Maisie, Hazel, and Martha, and five sons, Enos, Oscar, Ewald, Keith, and Maurice&#151;all of whom became painters.<br>
<br>An enterprising and creative individual who took advantage of every available opportunity, Namatjira trained as a blacksmith and carpenter and worked as a stockman and cameleer at Hermannsburg and on nearby pastoral stations. From the late 1920s his finely crafted mulga wood plaques and boomerangs decorated in pokerwork, black ink, and paint sold in the mission shop. Among the many visitors to Hermannsburg were two artists from Victoria, Rex Battarbee and John Gardner. Fascinated by an exhibition of their work in the schoolroom at Hermannsburg in 1934, Namatjira expressed interest in learning to paint, announcing &#145;I can do that too&#146;  (Henson, 75). With tuition from Battarbee acquired during two month-long excursions in 1936, Namatjira began to paint&#151;as an expression of his Aboriginal identity and a means of achieving economic independence. In 1935 his watercolours were displayed at a Lutheran conference at Nuriootpa, South Australia, and in 1938 Namatjira held his first solo exhibition at the Fine Art Society Gallery in Melbourne. In the post-war period he exhibited regularly and with great success throughout Australia in solo exhibitions and with other members of the Hermannsburg school he founded. Through his pioneering efforts Namatjira forged a new, contemporary expression for Aboriginal art, while he himself became an important role model for a future generation of Aboriginal artists.<br>
<br>In the following decades Namatjira achieved national and international prominence. In 1944 he became the first Aboriginal person included in <span class="italic">Who's who in Australia</span> and the subject of the first monograph devoted to an Aboriginal artist. He subsequently starred in the film <span class="italic">Namatjira the Painter</span> (1947). During successive royal visits he was presented to the duke and duchess of Gloucester (1946) and Queen Elizabeth (1954). Honours accrued: Namatjira was awarded Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation Medal (1953) and elected an honorary member of the Royal Art Society of New South Wales (1955). William Dargie's striking portrait, which won the Archibald prize in 1956, conveys both Namatjira's powerful physical presence and his proud and dignified manner.<br>
<br>Namatjira's watercolour landscapes achieved widespread popularity among white Australians, for whom the landscape represented an important symbol of national identity, but they were overlooked or denigrated by art institutions. To many, his use of Western techniques and the pictorial conventions of the landscape genre appeared derivative and conservative. In effect his work was misinterpreted as a symbol of assimilation and a sign of colonial domination. More recently his reputation has undergone considerable revision: his watercolours are now generally viewed as reaffirming and reclaiming his ancestral connections to country. In the words of the Yirrkala elder and political leader Galarrwuy Yunupingu, Namatjira &#145;showed to the rest of the world the living title held by his people to the lands they had been on for thousands of years&#146;  (Yunupingu, 66). Redressing earlier neglect, Namatjira is now represented in the collection of the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra and in all state galleries.<br>
<br>Namatjira's achievements highlighted the gap between the reality and rhetoric of assimilation policies. Controversies surrounded his financial situation and attempts by the mission and government agencies to maintain control over the sale and marketing of his work and that of other members of the Hermannsburg school. In 1951 he was prevented from building a house on land he had purchased in Alice Springs. The citizenship granted to him in 1957 heightened growing tension and directly impacted on the tragic events surrounding his death. Exemption from the restrictions imposed on other &#145;full blood&#146; Aborigines gave Namatjira access to alcohol, which he shared with members of his family in accordance with customary law. In 1958 he was charged with supplying alcohol to the artist Henoch Raberaba and sentenced to six months' imprisonment with labour. A nationwide protest resulted in two appeals, which reduced his sentence to three months. Eventually Namatjira served two months in open detention at Papunya settlement from March to May 1959. Taken ill while living at Papunya, he died of heart failure at the Alice Springs Hospital on 8 August 1959. He was buried with a Lutheran service on 9 August at the Alice Springs cemetery. As a gesture of respect, in 1994 his granddaughter Elaine, working in collaboration with women from the Hermannsburg Potters, produced a terracotta mural for his gravestone.<br>
