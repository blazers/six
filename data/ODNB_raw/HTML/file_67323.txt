<span class="headword">Gillow family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1730&#150;<em>c.</em>1830), <span class="occ">cabinet-makers and upholsterers</span>, came to prominence with Richard [ii] Gillow (1733&#150;1811), the son of <a href="#cosubject_67319">Robert [i] Gillow (1702/3&#150;1772) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, the founder of the firm. Gillows's reputation as one of the leading British cabinet-making firms of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was established by contributions from some ten members of the family over three generations. The business was established about 1728; in 1813 probably for both economic and social reasons, the Gillow family sold the firm to three partners, Redmayne, Whiteside, and Ferguson, who retained the name Gillow &amp; Co. Succeeding partnerships such as Waring and Gillows Ltd (founded 1897), Waring and Gillow (1932) Ltd, and other concerns also incorporated the name until the end of the twentieth century. During the eighteenth century the Gillow firm established a reputation for producing quality furniture at moderate prices, made from the best woods, by competent workmen, in elegant but practical styles, which sometimes incorporated ingenious devices. Some of Gillows's designs were based on plates from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century pattern books, while others were provided by Wyatt. However, in some instances Gillows were using designs several years before they appeared in pattern books, for example, shield, on escutcheon back chairs. Gillows produced good, solid, well-made furniture, and were the only eighteenth-century cabinet-makers to establish and maintain a branch in both London (opened 1770) and the provinces. The Gillow Archives (now in the City of Westminster Archives Centre) comprise mainly the Lancaster branch's business records from about 1728 to 1932, and include estimate sketch and memorandum books from 1759 to 1905. Although incomplete, they are the longest and largest cabinet-makers' records to have survived in the world. The Lancaster branch also stamped their name on some of their furniture from about 1789, thereby enabling some of their output to be identified and dated via the firm's estimate sketch books.<br>
<br>Members of each generation became involved in the day-to-day running of the family business and from an early age represented the firm; waited on customers to take their orders; gained experience in the Oxford Street, London, shop; and became equal partners in the firm. The social status of members of the Gillow family changed with their wealth and influence, from that of successful artisan craftsman in the 1740s to established members of the squirearchy by the early nineteenth century. No clearer illustration of the Gillows' rise in status can be cited than that, whereas Robert [i] Gillow provided furniture for Lord and Lady Gerard from the 1740s, in 1801, his grandson Richard [iii] Gillow married an heiress, Elizabeth Stapleton, the cousin of another Lady Gerard.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_67319"></a><span class="headword">Robert [i] Gillow</span>  (1702/3&#150;1772)<span class="occ"></span>, the founder of the firm, was the son of Richard [i] Gillow (<i>d</i>. 22 Dec 1717), a yeoman of Great Singleton, Lancashire, and his wife, Alice Swarbrick (<i>d</i>. 1721). His father was, like former and subsequent generations of the family, a devout Roman Catholic, and he suffered imprisonment for his faith. Robert was apprenticed in March 1721 to John Robinson, a Lancaster joiner, and after completing his apprenticeship in 1727 or 1728 he became a freeman of Lancaster and set up a cabinet-making business. From about 1731 to 1735 he was in partnership with another Roman Catholic joiner, George Haresnape. He entered the West Indies trade as a merchant in 1741 and the Baltic trade in 1742. Robert [i] Gillow married Agnes Fell (1709&#150;1757), daughter of James Fell of Swarthmore, Ulverston, in 1731. Robert and Agnes Gillow had nine children, of whom only one daughter and three sons survived infancy. Alice, their first child, born in 1731, married Thomas Worswick (<i>c</i>.1730&#150;1804), a watchmaker, on 26 April 1756, at the priory church of St Mary, Lancaster. Worswick, who founded one of the first banks in Lancaster, supplied some clocks to fit Gillows cases, and Gillows supplied cases for his clocks. The Worswick family were also devout Roman Catholics from Singleton, and like the Gillows became merchants. Of Robert and Agnes Gillow's three sons two, <a href="#cosubject_47507">Richard [ii] Gillow</a> and <a href="#cosubject_67320">Robert [ii] Gillow [<i>see below</i>]</a>, became cabinet-makers. John [i] Gillow [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10752/', "Gillow, John (1753&#150;1828)")</script>], their youngest son, was sent to Douai in 1766 and became president of Ushaw College. In the 1740s Robert [i] Gillow began to make some furniture for the gentry, probably through the patronage of another Lancastrian, William Bradshaw (1700&#150;1775), an eminent London tapestry weaver and upholsterer. In January 1757, Robert [i] Gillow took his eldest son, Richard [ii] Gillow, into equal partnership; and in 1769 he retired leaving his share of the partnership to his second son, Robert [ii] Gillow. Robert [i] Gillow died at Church Street, Lancaster, and was buried at St Mary's Church, Lancaster, on 3 December 1772. He left property in the town to his sons, but his main legacy was a firm foundation for the business on which his sons, nephews, and grandsons subsequently built.<br>
<br>Robert [i] Gillow's son <a name="cosubject_47507"></a><span class="headword">Richard [ii] Gillow</span>  (1733&#150;1811)<span class="occ"></span> was born in Lancaster on 29 December 1733. He was apprenticed in London to a Mr Jones, an architect, during the 1750s, and in 1753 was sent by his father on a voyage to Barbados in the West Indies. In 1754 he subscribed to Thomas Chippendale's <span class="italic">Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director</span>. In 1754&#150;5 he became a freeman of Lancaster, and on 1 January 1757 he joined his father as an equal partner in Robert Gillow &amp; Son. From September 1758 all the firm's apprentices were bound in his name, and from the late 1750s he also prepared new furniture designs based on sketches supplied from London by his cousin <a href="#cosubject_72805">James Gillow (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1732) [<i>see below</i>]</a>. He married Sarah Haresnape (1734/5&#150;1783), said to be the daughter of Robert Haresnape of Thurnham, on 11 February 1761 at the priory church of St Mary, Lancaster. Richard and Sarah had eight children, five daughters and three sons; <a href="#cosubject_67324">Robert [iii] Gillow</a>; <a href="#cosubject_67322">George [ii] Gillow</a>; and <a href="#cosubject_67323">Richard [iii] Gillow [<i>see below</i>]</a>, all joined the family firm. When Richard [ii]'s father retired from business in 1769 and his brother Robert [ii] joined him as a partner, the brothers declared their intention: &#145;to equal (if not to surpass) the port of London, or any other in the export of furniture&#146;  (GA, 344/161, 26 Feb 1769). During Richard [ii] Gillow's long period with the firm, Gillows developed from thriving provincial cabinet-makers to one of the best London upholsterers. His main role was to run the Lancaster business, but he encouraged and advised his cousin <a href="#cosubject_72806">Thomas Gillow [<i>see below</i>]</a> when in 1769 he declared his intention to start a London cabinet-making business. Richard [ii] also informed customers of the latest London fashions, and counselled them wisely and tactfully on matters of taste and practicality in furniture and interior design. In 1807 Clarke recommended &#145;Mr Gillow's extensive ware-rooms&#146; in Lancaster &#145;stored with every article of useful and ornamental mahogany furniture&#146;, as &#145;well worth the attention of the stranger; as they are said to be the best stocked of any in this line, out of the metropolis&#146;  (Clarke, 64). Richard [ii] Gillow acquired a house in Margate and established the first Roman Catholic mission in the town, and a small chapel was erected by his generosity in 1801. He retired from the firm in 1800, and died at his Lancaster house in Thurnham Street &#145;of dropsy&#146; on 14 August 1811, aged seventy-seven. In his obituary he was described as &#145;formerly a cabinet-maker and upholsterer; a man who spent a long life of business with honour and integrity, and as a son, husband, and member of society, in the performance of every Christian duty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lancaster Gazette</span>, 17 Aug 1811). He was buried in St Mary's churchyard near the tomb of his brother Robert [ii] Gillow.<br>
<br>Richard [ii] Gillow's brother <a name="cosubject_67320"></a><span class="headword">Robert [ii] Gillow</span>  (1746/7&#150;1795)<span class="occ"></span> was born in Lancaster. He appears to have attended school in the Fylde area of Lancashire, like his younger brother John Gillow. In May 1762 his father paid a small sum to John Calvert for &#145;Bob's learning&#146;  (GA, 344/31, p. 197, 26-5-1762). He probably learned the cabinet-maker's trade from his father and brother. In 1766&#150;7 he became a freeman of Lancaster, and in January 1769 his father left him his equal share in the firm, which became known as Messrs Richard and Robert Gillow. He took equal responsibility for the Lancaster firm's apprentices from March 1770. Robert [ii] Gillow married Jane Shaw (<i>d</i>. 1783) by licence on 24 June 1771 at St Mary's Church, Lancaster, and they had a son, <a href="#cosubject_72808">Robert [iv] Gillow [<i>see below</i>]</a> and a daughter, Jane, in 1775. One of the partners in the London firm, Gillows and Taylor, William Taylor, died in 1775, and in January 1776 Robert [ii] Gillow left Lancaster to take charge of the business in London, assisted by his cousin Thomas Gillow, who had been Taylor's partner. Thomas Gillow also became ill in 1778, and died the following summer. Thus ten years after the London branch was established it was in the hands of the Lancaster brothers. Robert's wife, Jane, also died in London in June 1783. Two years later on 12 September 1785 Robert Gillow, widower, of Oxford Street, married again at Holy Trinity Church, Kendal. His second wife was Mary, widow of William Newby late of Horncop Hall, Kendal. In July 1791 Robert [ii] Gillow made a will in which he mentioned a son, Robert [iv] Gillow, then a minor. His daughter Jane had decided to become a nun in 1791, much to her father's dismay, as he considered she should enjoy the pleasures of life which, as a result of his successful industry, he could give her. Although Robert [ii] Gillow took charge of the London business, he returned to Lancaster regularly, calling on customers on his journey north. He sent orders from London customers to his brother Richard [ii] in Lancaster and obtained services and material unavailable in Lancaster, in addition to advising him about the latest fashions. Robert [ii] Gillow died in Lancaster on 22 September 1795 aged forty-eight. He was buried appropriately by his own firm in a grave in the churchyard of St Mary's, Lancaster, on 26 September. His sister, Sarah, was buried in the same grave in 1801. Their epitaph reads: &#145;they lived respected and beloved, may our end be like unto them&#146;  (Tombstone, St Mary's churchyard).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_72805"></a><span class="headword">James Gillow</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1732)<span class="occ"></span> was the second of six sons and one daughter of George [i] Gillow (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1759), a yeoman farmer of Great Singleton, near Kirkham, Lancashire, and his wife, Alice. He was apprenticed on 8 September 1746 to his uncle, Robert [i] Gillow, and after completing his apprenticeship he continued to work for Gillows as a journeyman in Lancaster; however, by January 1759 he was working in London. He lodged in St Martin's Lane, in the same area as eminent cabinet-makers such as Thomas Chippendale, William Vile &amp; Co., and John Cobb. James Gillow's employer is unknown, but letters from his cousin Richard [ii] Gillow show that he was used as an errand-boy for the Lancaster firm and procured materials unobtainable in Lancaster. He suffered from ill health and returned to Lancashire, where he had been offered &#145;light work&#146; by his cousins during the summer of 1759. On his return to London, Richard [ii] requested that James send him furniture designs and published design books such as &#145;Chippendale's additional number&#146;  (GA, 344/164, 5-7-1760). He was last mentioned in Gillow correspondence in November 1765, when he was newly married. He was almost certainly the Roman Catholic cabinet-maker of that name who was living in Marlborough, Wiltshire, with his wife, Hannah, in August 1767. After the death of his brother Thomas, he may have returned to London to help his cousin Robert [ii] Gillow run the Oxford Street shop, since between 1781 and 1785 the firm was listed in some directories as Robert, Richard, and James Gillow  (Beard and Gilbert, 341).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_72806"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Gillow</span>  (<em>c.</em>1736&#150;1779)<span class="occ"></span> was the third of the seven children of George [i] Gillow and his wife, Alice. By 1748 he was, like his brother James, also living with his uncle Robert [i] Gillow to whom he was apprenticed in November 1750. He worked as a journeyman for Robert [i] Gillow but by July 1760 he had moved to Liverpool. It may be no coincidence that by January 1766, shortly after his brother James moved from London to Marlborough, Thomas was working in the capital, and living in Marshall Street, Carnaby Market. Thomas played a similar role to his brother in supplying his cousins in Lancaster with materials. His neighbours were the celebrated cabinet-makers William Ince and John Mayhew, whose book <span class="italic">The Universal System of Household Furniture</span> was published in parts from 1759 to 1761. In April 1769 Richard Gillow wrote to Thomas that he &#145;was glad to find by what you hinted that you intend beginning for yourself in London&#146;  (GA, 344/166, 16-4-1769). He went into partnership with William Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1775), another Lancaster cabinet-maker, and they became the first London partners of the firm in Oxford Street known as Gillows and Taylor, and Richard and Robert Gillow entered into an agreement to supply them with cabinet wares, including billiard tables. In January 1771 Thomas married Ann Cannon, at St James, Westminster. Taylor died in the autumn of 1775, and Thomas's cousin Robert [ii] Gillow joined him to run the London shop in January 1776. Thomas Gillow, like his brother James, suffered from ill health; he made his will in April 1778, and it was proved in July 1779. He had no children and left his estate to his &#145;beloved wife Ann&#146;  (will).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_72807"></a><span class="headword">John [ii] Gillow</span>  (<em>b. </em>1756/7)<span class="occ"></span> was the son of Edward Gillow (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1702), a yeoman of Westby in the parish of Slaidburn, Yorkshire, and his wife, Ann (<i>b</i>. 1715). Edward Gillow was the brother of Robert [i] Gillow. John [ii] Gillow was apprenticed to his cousins Richard [ii] and Robert [ii] Gillow in Lancaster from 19 March 1770 for seven years, and worked as a journeyman for the firm before becoming a cabinet-maker in Liverpool from about 1784 to 1794.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_67324"></a><span class="headword">Robert [iii] Gillow</span>  (1764&#150;1838)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 9 October 1764, the eldest son of Richard [ii] Gillow (1733&#150;1811), and the brother of George [ii] and Richard [iii] Gillow who also became cabinet-makers. During the 1770s Robert [iii] Gillow and George [ii] were educated at Roman Catholic boarding-schools, by Mr Pennington of Robert Hall, near Hornby, then by Mr Peter Newby of Eccleston, who was probably a kinsman. In 1781 his father paid the expenses of sending Robert [iii] to London; by December 1786 Robert was acting as a commercial traveller for the firm, and the following year he became a freeman of Lancaster when he was described as an &#145;upholsterer&#146;  (Freemen rolls, 130). He married Anne Parker (1764&#150;1841), daughter and heir of Edward Parker, esquire, at Preston in 1797. Robert [iii] and Anne Gillow had four daughters, all coheirs who married into the gentry, his two eldest daughters in the private chapel at Clifton Hill, Forton, Lancashire. Robert [iii] Gillow and his family moved to the Clifton Hill estate after December 1817 and before October 1822, and he died there on 11 July 1838, aged seventy-five. He was a generous patron of the Roman Catholic church. He also amassed a library of about 700 volumes and was in possession of the residue of his late brother George's collection of paintings and drawings which had remained unsold after Christies auction of April 1824. In his will he mentioned his furniture, plate, linen, pictures, and books, which&#151;apart from specific items bequeathed to his wife and daughters&#151;were all to be auctioned on his wife's death.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_67322"></a><span class="headword">George [ii] Gillow</span>  (1765/6&#150;1822)<span class="occ"></span> was the second son of Richard [ii] Gillow. He was born in Lancaster and educated in Lancashire during the 1770s with his elder brother Robert [iii] Gillow, first by William Pennington of Robert Hall, a Roman Catholic institution near Hornby, then by Peter Newby of Eccleston, near Kirkham. Their education included social graces such as learning to dance. George [ii] Gillow became a freeman of Lancaster in 1782&#150;3, and joined his uncle Robert [ii] Gillow as a partner in the London shop restyled Robert and George Gillow &amp; Co. from March 1791. At about this date he married Judith Gildon (<i>d</i>. 1843), member of an ancient Dorset and Wiltshire Roman Catholic family. George and Judith had eight daughters. By January 1796 George [ii] Gillow had been joined in London by his younger brother, Richard [iii] Gillow, and their cousin, Robert [iv] Gillow. In 1813 the Gillow family retired from active participation in the cabinet-making business and sold the firm to Redmayne, Whiteside, and Ferguson. The agreement was that the new partners should purchase the firm in instalments, the final instalment being due in 1821, and that the proceeds were to be divided equally between the three remaining partners (the sons of Richard [ii] Gillow). George [ii] Gillow amused himself by forming a large collection of European paintings and drawings, &#145;at great expense&#146;, which included a &#145;grand gallery picture by P. Veronese&#146; and other works by Masaccio, Bellini, Caravaggio, and Leonardo da Vinci, described in Christies sale catalogue of April 1824. George [ii] Gillow would not have had long to enjoy his share, since he died at Hammersmith on 1 December 1822, aged fifty-six, leaving his eight daughters as his coheirs. Judith, his wife, died on 2 March 1843.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_67323"></a><span class="headword">Richard [iii] Gillow</span>  (1772&#150;1849)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 8 March 1772, the third and youngest son of Richard [ii] Gillow. He married Elizabeth Stapleton (1780&#150;1848) on 31 May 1801 at St Mary's Church, Marylebone, Middlesex. Elizabeth was the daughter and eventual heir of a Preston doctor, Charles Stapleton, younger son of Nicholas Stapleton of Carlton Hall, Yorkshire, heir to the barony of Beaumont, subsequently restored. Richard and Elizabeth had thirteen children, one of whose baptismal sponsors was Elizabeth's cousin Lady Gerard, whose forebears had patronized Richard [iii] Gillow's grandfather, Robert [i] Gillow, the founder of the firm during the 1740s. In three generations, therefore, the Gillow family had risen in status from serving the gentry as tradesmen to claiming kinship with them by marriage. Richard [iii] Gillow was described as a &#145;cabinetmaker and upholsterer&#146; in 1796&#150;7 when he became a Lancaster freeman  (Freemen rolls, 132). He was an active partner in the Oxford Street shop. In May 1800 Richard [iii] Gillow of London patented an expanding dining table which was a great success and large numbers were manufactured by the firm. He lived in London for many years at Little Holland House, Campden Hill, Kensington, where many of his children were born, while others were born at Ellel Grange, near Lancaster, a property owned by one of his Worswick cousins. In February 1822 Worswick's Bank was declared insolvent; and in December 1823 both Leighton Hall and Ellel Grange were offered for sale by order of the high court of chancery. Leighton Hall was purchased by Richard [iii] Gillow, and after some renovations in April 1824, the family moved their furniture from Ellel Grange to Leighton. From 1825 &#145;Richard Gillow Esq.&#146; purchased more furniture from the new partners in their old family firm  (GA 344/102, p. 3457, 25-11-1825). Elizabeth Stapleton died on 18 November 1848, and Richard [iii] Gillow died at Leighton on 16 December 1849; they were both interred in the family mausoleum at Leighton Hall. Richard Thomas Gillow (1806&#150;1905), eldest son of Richard and Elizabeth, is said to have been the last family member to be associated with the firm, but he, and his father, retired from trade in 1830.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_72808"></a><span class="headword">Robert [iv] Gillow</span>  (1771<span class="mult">x</span>4&#150;1798)<span class="occ"></span> was the son of Robert [ii] Gillow and his first wife, Jane Shaw. His date of birth is unknown but it must have been between 1771 and before 1775 when his sister Jane was born. By January 1796 (a few months after his father's death) he had joined his cousins George [ii] Gillow and Richard [iii] Gillow as a London partner. However, Robert [iv] Gillow died unexpectedly at the English College, Lisbon, Portugal, on 10 March 1798, having outlived his father by less than three years.<br>
<br>Gillow furniture originally graced a vast number of town and country houses owned by the artistocracy and gentry; some collections still remain in private ownership today, although most commissions have inevitably been dispersed over the centuries. The number of provenanced or marked Gillow examples to be seen in country houses open to the public today vary considerably from one or two, to over 150 pieces at Tatton Park, near Knutsford, Cheshire. Broughton Hall, near Skipton, Yorkshire, has probably the largest private collection, and Leighton Hall, near Carnforth, home of Richard [iii] Gillow, naturally has a good collection of furniture by the family firm. Many other houses and institutions in north-west England have mainly smaller but notable collections, or a few pieces by the firm including: Sizergh Castle, Cumbria; Abbot Hall Art Gallery, Kendal; Levens Hall, near Kendal; Dalemain, near Penrith; Mirehouse, near Kendal; the Judge's Lodgings Museum; Lancaster Castle; Lancaster City Museums; Lancaster Town Hall, Lancaster; Browesholme, Lancashire; and Tabley House, Cheshire. Houses outside the north-west region with some Gillow furniture in their collections include: Ardgowan, Renfrewshire, Scotland (open to special interest groups by arrangement); Berrington Hall, Hertfordshire; Dyrham Park, Gloucestershire; Raby Castle, near Darlington; Normanby Hall, near Scunthorpe; Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire; Stonor Park, near High Wycombe; Belton House, Lincolnshire; and Erddig Park, near Wrexham, north Wales. Over the three generations that Gillows were involved in the cabinet-making trade, they changed from artisan craftsmen to entrepreneurial manufacturing upholsterers and cabinet-makers employing a large workforce with prestigious showrooms in London and Lancaster. The firm were enabled to develop, expand, and probably to help finance their furniture making ventures, by becoming, from the 1740s, West Indies and European import and export merchants. Indeed their furniture rarely accounted for more than a small proportion of their exports, because it took up too much space on board ship in proportion to the profits to be made out of it. Therefore their furniture was also used as storage space for more profitable small British manufactured goods such as jewellery, brass and iron wares, textiles, shoes, and felt hats; and other perishable provisions for the colonies were also exported by the firm. Imports varied according to the state of the British markets but sugar, cotton, rum, and fine wines as well as mahogany and other timber were often included. Gillows promoted their furniture at every opportunity, and constantly sought new markets both at home and abroad. The Gillow family's contribution to furniture history remains to be fully evaluated. However, Gillows's designs were aimed at the gentry and growing upper middle classes; they occupied the middle ground between fashionable whimsy and boring conservatism. The firm adapted the latest London designs to suit their customers' taste, as well as creating some ingenious designs of their own, which they were anxious not to let other cabinet-makers copy. Research has also indicated that Gillows were making some furniture styles years before similar designs were published in design books by, for example, A. Heppelwhite &amp; Co. and Thomas Sheraton. In 1817 Gillows work was described as &#145;all the fashion in the houses of the first Nobility and Gentry in England&#146; and &#145;Mr. Gillow at Lancaster&#146; as &#145;the first Upholsterer in the Kingdom&#146;  (D. McInnis and R. A. Leath, pp. 137&#150;74, ref. p. 142). The success of the Gillow family firm was mainly due to sound business management and the manufacture of good quality practical furniture made from the best wood, by competent workmen, at the cheapest prices. It was, in essence, as the firm wrote to a customer in 1797, made to stand &#145;the test&#146; of time  (GA, 344/173, 20-9-1797).<br>
