<span class="headword">Graham,  Gerald Sandford</span>  (1903&#150;1988), <span class="occ">imperial and naval historian</span>, was born on 27 April 1903 in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, the son of Henry Sandford Graham (1868&#150;1951), Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Florence Marion, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chambers (1873&#150;1961). The father, though born in Monmouth, was of Scottish descent, and the mother was an Irish Protestant.<br>
<br>An outstanding student, Gerald Graham took his BA at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, in 1924, and his MA a year after, winning a scholarship to Harvard for his AM (1927), and another to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he completed his PhD in 1929, with the thesis which became his first book, <span class="italic">British Policy and Canada, 1774&#150;1791</span>, published in 1930 and still cited by scholars. A Rockefeller fellowship for 1929&#150;30 allowed him to spend the year in Germany before beginning his teaching career as an instructor at Harvard in 1930.<br>
<br>The 1930s were a formative period of Graham's life. At Harvard he made a number of lifelong friends, including T. S. Eliot. In 1936 Queen's University received him back, and rapidly promoted him to full professor. In Canada he became part of a circle of able historians, including A. L. Burt, Donald Creighton, George V. Ferguson, and Harold Innis, whom Graham revered as the most brilliant historian Canada had produced. He also began a close friendship with the philosopher George Grant, and was deeply influenced by his ideas.<br>
<br>The Second World War helped to shape Graham's future academic life. A Guggenheim fellowship in 1941 took him back to the USA, where his book <span class="italic">Sea Power and British North America, 1783&#150;1820</span> (1941) showed the shift of his interests to naval power and its relationship to empire. Late in 1941 he joined the Canadian army but was soon shifted to the Canadian navy's officer training school at Royal Roads in British Columbia as an instructor with the rank of lieutenant-commander. Anxious to experience the battle of the Atlantic at first hand, he wangled his way into service on Canadian destroyers during the college vacations, and spent some time on torpedo boats based in Dover. After D-day he was moved back into the historical section of the Canadian Army Overseas in London with the rank of major.<br>
<br>The move proved to be permanent. In 1946 Graham was appointed lecturer, and in 1947 reader in history at Birkbeck College, London. In 1949 he was appointed Rhodes professor of imperial history at the University of London, King's College, and began publishing a magisterial series of deeply researched books analysing the links between sea power and imperial policy in all the oceans, <span class="italic">Empire of the North Atlantic</span> (1950), <span class="italic">The Politics of Naval Supremacy</span> (1965), <span class="italic">Great Britain in the Indian Ocean</span> (1967), and, after his retirement, <span class="italic">The China Station: War and Diplomacy, 1830&#150;1860</span> (1978), as well as a steady yearly output of articles, chapters in joint works, documentary editions, and published lectures on themes from Canadian history, imperial finance and trade, and imperial constitutional history.<br>
<br>Graham's tenure of the Rhodes chair coincided with the explosions of Asian and African nationalism and the transfers of power to independent states in Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. His seminar at the Institute of Historical Research became an engine for the decolonization of imperial history, influencing the profession in every country of the Commonwealth. It was a miniature commonwealth in itself, attracting students from the old dominions and the USA, and increasingly from Africa and the Caribbean, many of whom laid the basis for &#145;national&#146; schools of historical research in their own countries. After his retirement a list of his former postgraduate students occupying university positions contained over two hundred names. They taught in every province of Canada, most states of Australia, in New Zealand, South Africa, Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as in Britain and the USA. Many of them rose to senior positions in their own countries, and as a group they played an important role in the foundation and development of the new post-war colonial universities which became the national universities of independent states.<br>
<br>Yet there was no &#145;Graham school&#146; of imperial history. Graham shared George Grant's pessimistic conservatism and the sense that mankind was losing its humanity in the face of technology and materialism. He did not share in the euphoria of most of his students, eager for the brave new world of colonial independence, but held the gloomy view that, in Africa especially, independence was premature, and would usher in decay and corruption. Yet he had a special kind of scholarly integrity which allowed him to act as midwife to major nationalist revisionism such as that of his students like Kenneth Dike, Jacob Ajayi, and West Indian scholars, by emphasizing their freedom to propound any thesis, provided it could work as an explanation of evidence and was written with clarity and elegance.<br>
<br>In 1929 Graham married Winifred Emily Ware (1907&#150;1990), with whom he had a son, John Ware Graham. The marriage was dissolved in 1950. In that year he married Constance Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Greey, with whom he had two daughters, Laura and Constance, and a son, James. Graham died at the Sussex Clinic, St Leonards, Sussex, on 5 July 1988 from bronchial pneumonia in the aftermath of major surgery. He was buried at St Leonard's Church, Beckley, Sussex, on the 9th.<br>
