<span class="headword">Waller,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1395&#150;<em>c.</em>1462), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was the son of John Waller of Groombridge, Kent, and Margaret Landsdale of Landsdale, Sussex. Groombridge had been purchased from William Clinton by Waller's grandfather Thomas, who came originally from Lamberhurst in Sussex. Richard Waller served in the French wars under Henry V, and was present at Agincourt in 1415, being said to have captured Charles, duke of Orl&eacute;ans. Waller was rewarded for his role in the battle with the custody of the duke, and from its profits was able to rebuild his Groombridge house. The custody also left its mark on the family's crest, through the addition of the duke's shield of arms hanging from a walnut tree. On 17 August 1424 Waller served under John, duke of Bedford, at the battle of Verneuil, but retired from military life in 1431, after holding numerous positions of command, and turned his attention to legal and political concerns. In 1433&#150;4 he was sheriff of the joint county of Surrey and Sussex, and in 1437&#150;8 sheriff of Kent. In 1437 Orl&eacute;ans's brother, the count of Angoul&ecirc;me, was also entrusted to Waller's keeping, after being held by the Beauforts since 1412.<br>
<br>Waller became a retainer of Cardinal Beaufort; by 1434 he was receiving from Beaufort an annuity worth &pound;20 from Farnham, Surrey, and was appointed steward of Downtown by the cardinal in 1435. By 1439 Waller had become master of Beaufort's household, and he accompanied the cardinal on his embassy to France in that year. Not long before his death Beaufort made Waller (who had also served Louis de Luxembourg as steward) steward for life of the bishopric's lands and temporalities, and in his will, dated 20 January 1446, appointed Waller one of his executors. Waller then became increasingly attached to the court. In March 1443 he served with Sir John Fastolf as treasurer of the expedition to Guyenne led by John Beaufort, duke of Somerset, and on 3 April he presented to the council a schedule of necessary purveyances for the army. He acted as receiver and treasurer of a subsidy in 1450, and was probably also joint chamberlain of the exchequer with Sir Thomas Tyrell. On 12 July of that year he was commissioned to arrest John Mortimer, alias Jack Cade, while in September he was sent on an errand to Richard of York, the purpose of which may have been to secure the duke's arrest. On 8 June 1456 he was summoned to attend an assize of oyer and terminer at Maidstone to punish rioters, and he was one of the commissioners appointed on 31 July 1458 to inquire into Warwick's attack on a fleet of L&uuml;beck merchantmen. He must have made his peace with the Yorkists after Edward IV's accession, since on 26 February 1461 he was made receiver of the king's castles, manors, and lands in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire.<br>
<br>Waller's eldest son, Richard (<i>d</i>. 21 Aug 1474), who had represented Hindon in the parliament of 1453, was made a commissioner of array for Kent on 10 May 1461. Waller presumably died soon afterwards, as his name appears in no further records. With his wife, Silvia Gulby, he had two sons, Richard and John, and a daughter, Alice, who married Sir John Guildford. The second son, John (<i>d</i>. 1517), was the ancestor both of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28556/', "Edmund Waller")</script> the poet, and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28561/', "Sir William Waller")</script>, the parliamentary general.<br>
