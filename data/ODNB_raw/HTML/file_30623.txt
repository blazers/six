<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Barry, Sir  Gerald Reid</span>  (1898&#150;1968), <span class="occ">journalist and Festival of Britain administrator</span>, was born at Fairfax, Berrylands Road, Surbiton, Surrey, on 20 November 1898, the fourth child of George Duncan Barry (1864&#150;1945), who was then curate of St Mark's, Surbiton, and his wife, Edith Geraldine Reid (1859&#150;1898). His mother died while giving birth to him and his father remarried. One of his elder siblings was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67071/', "Frank Russell Barry")</script>, who became bishop of Southwell. He was educated at Marlborough College, and in 1916 was elected to an exhibition at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he planned to study history. But from 1917 to 1919 he served in the Royal Flying Corps and RAF, being demobilized with the rank of captain.<br>
<br>After the war Barry became a journalist, writing for the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>. In 1921 he joined the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> as assistant editor, becoming its editor three years later at the age of twenty-six. The circumstances which led to his leaving that post in February 1930 caused a sensation and won him a great deal of sympathy and support. When its directors suddenly committed the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> to support Lord Beaverbrook's United Empire Party, without Barry's knowledge, he resigned, and his editorial staff went with him. The last issue of the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> edited by Barry strongly criticized the United Empire Party line; the next issue supported the Beaverbrook position. He and his editorial staff were applauded for their stand in defence of independent journalism.<br>
<br>Six days after his resignation the <span class="italic">Week-End Review</span> was created and Barry was announced as its editor. With his old editorial team, he produced the first number on 14 March 1930, which included messages of support from the prime minister, Baldwin, and public men from all parties. With a distinguished list of contributors, Barry made the <span class="italic">Week-End Review</span> a success, notably by running &#145;spreads&#146; on subjects of topical interest. In 1932 he edited <span class="italic">A Week-End Calendar</span> and in 1933 he published <span class="italic">This England</span>, extracts from a <span class="italic">Week-End Review</span> column compiled from readers' submissions of absurdities from the English press. By late in 1933 the <span class="italic">Week-End Review</span> had lost its financial backing and in January 1934 it was merged into Kingsley Martin's <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>. Barry joined the board of directors of the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> and the journal continued the famous &#145;This England&#146; column and some other features from the <span class="italic">Week-End Review</span>.<br>
<br>In 1934 Barry became features editor of the popular, left-leaning daily, the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>, and its managing editor in February 1936. He brought to the paper his light touch and made it more readable. As editor through the challenging days of the abdication and Munich, and then throughout the Second World War, he enjoyed wittily attacking in his newspaper the blackshirts in Britain, Franco in Spain, Mussolini in Ethiopia, and the Japanese in Manchuria. He was also the founder of the celebrated <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> schools competition. He resented the interference of the <span class="italic">New Chronicle's</span> chairman, Walter Layton, in editorial matters&#151;most notably on the eve of the Munich agreement, when Layton prevented him from publishing evidence of Hitler's plans for further annexations. While Layton was a war civil servant, from 1940 to 1944, Barry had a freer hand to push the paper in a leftward direction, as he successfully excluded the acting chairman, Laurence Cadbury, from editorial decisions. In 1947 he resigned as editor, but remained on the board.<br>
<br>Barry's next position was the one for which he is best remembered. On 10 March 1948 Herbert Morrison, lord president of the council, announced that Barry had accepted the job of director-general of the Festival of Britain, 1951. Barry was a founding member of the Labour think-tank PEP (Political and Economic Planning), along with Morrison's under-secretary, Max Nicholson, who helped Morrison select most of the festival committee. In addition, Barry had written an open letter to Stafford Cripps, as president of the Board of Trade, in the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> (14 September 1945) supporting the proposal of the Royal Society of Arts that the centenary of the 1851 exhibition should be marked by another international exhibition, focusing on trade and culture. In the end an international exhibition was deemed far too expensive and impractical in view of post-war shortages and the costs of reconstruction. In 1947 it was decided that a smaller, national exhibition should be funded by the government. Nicholson called Barry &#145;a great impresario&#146;, and Hugh Casson, who served as the 1951 South Bank site's chief architect, claimed that &#145;all architects knew him as a lover of architecture&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Nov 1968). Barry saw the 1951 festival as a great opportunity for patronizing the arts, including poetry, music, painting, sculpture, architecture, design, and engineering. To work on the festival he picked a young team, most of whom had gained their experience in the war and were enthusiastic to display their designs and buildings to the public. Casson wrote upon Barry's death that &#145;he was marvellously equipped by his endless curiosity, seriousness of purpose, enthusiastic receptivity to ideas, personal courage and his capacity&#151;amounting almost to genius&#151;for getting the best out of everybody who worked for him&#146;  (ibid.). Barry bore three years of financial crises, opposition, bad press, and worse weather, guiding the festival to its completion and ultimate success. There were eight official government-funded exhibitions in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales, twenty-two designated arts festivals, and a pleasure garden in Battersea. Eight and a half million people visited the London South Bank exhibition and the BBC aired 2700 festival-related broadcasts. On the local level, 2000 cities, towns, and villages across the UK organized and funded a festival event of some kind.<br>
<br>Barry, who famously described the festival as &#145;a tonic to the nation&#146; after the privations of the war years, was determined that it should be &#145;a manifestation of gaiety and ordered imagination in a world that he knew to be short of both&#146;. As well as restoring morale and raising aesthetic standards, he had a vision of the festival as &#145;a corporate act of national reassessment and of affirmation of our faith in the future&#146;, reflecting the national characteristics, ideals, and activities of an entire people  (Leventhal, 449). In the event, the ideal of putting on a people's show was realized only to a limited extent, for instead of being staged by the people, the festival was devised mainly by professionals for them. Some of the values behind the festival have been criticized by later generations: &#145;radical, deep-felt, middle-class, humorous, redolent to contemporary eyes of do-gooding and Hampstead, of petition-signing and Ealing films&#146;, as one of Barry's team recalled  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Nov 1968), but they were genuinely held. The organizers themselves were identified as typically &#145;the backbone of the BBC&#146;  (Frayn, 331). In 1951 Barry was knighted for his work on the festival and a plaque commemorating him was unveiled outside the Festival Hall in 1971.<br>
<br>Following his festival triumph and his wide-ranging interests, Barry served in a series of posts as consultant. These included working with the London county council on the redevelopment of the Crystal Palace site, advising the National Farmers' Union on public policy, and chairing the new Barbican committee. He also served on the government committee on the scope of town and country planning, the Cities Development Research Committee, and as deputy chairman of a committee on obscene libel laws. In 1959 Granada TV made him executive in charge of educational programming. He was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (1940) and a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In 1965 he edited, with J. Bronowski, James Fisher, and Julian Huxley, <span class="italic">Health and Wealth</span>.<br>
<br>Barry was married four times, and was three times divorced. In 1921 he married Gladwys Williams, daughter of G. Chishom Williams, a surgeon, and they had one son. In 1932 he married Mrs Helen Edith Selwyn Jepson, daughter of Richard Rigg, a barrister and former MP who later became mayor of the city of Westminster. His third marriage, in 1944, was to Mrs Vera Burton (1911&#150;1992), daughter of Vladimir Poliakoff, and they also had one son. In 1959 he married Mrs Diana Wooton Schlumberger. He died in London on 21 November 1968.<br>
