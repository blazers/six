<span class="headword">Perry, Sir  (Edwin) Cooper</span>  (1856&#150;1938), <span class="occ">physician and medical administrator</span>, was born at Castle Bromwich, Warwickshire, on 10 September 1856, the only son of Edwin Cresswell Perry (1828&#150;1899), who became vicar of Seighford, Staffordshire, in 1861, and his wife, Esther Cooper, daughter of Joseph Cockram, of Darlaston, Staffordshire. Perry's father, an all-round scholar and mathematician, was responsible for his entire education until he was thirteen. Then in 1870 Perry won a scholarship at Eton College, where he became head of school and was awarded the Newcastle scholarship in 1876. He left that year to become a scholar of King's College, Cambridge, where he gained the Bell university scholarship (1876), the Browne scholarship and medal (1878), and the Pitt scholarship (1879); he was senior classic in the tripos of 1880. While at Cambridge he was joint editor with A. H. Mann, the organist of King's, of the King's College anthem book, revised between 1879 and 1882.<br>
<br>In 1880, having been elected into a fellowship at his college, Perry set aside classics and the prospect of a career in the church to become a medical student. In 1883 he was appointed assistant lecturer in medical subjects at King's and assistant demonstrator of anatomy in the Cambridge medical school. In 1885 he entered the London Hospital; he qualified MRCS in October, and in 1886&#150;7 held the posts of house surgeon to Frederick Treves and house physician to Stephen Mackenzie. In 1887 his fellowship ran out and Perry was appointed an assistant physician, demonstrator of morbid anatomy, and physician to the dermatological department at Guy's Hospital, London. In the following year he became dean of the medical school. Now his formidable administrative energies came into play, and he reorganized the system of junior appointments and built a residential medical college for the students, of which he became the first warden. In conjunction with Frederick Newland-Pedley he was responsible for the establishment in 1889 of a dental school at Guy's. Even while primarily an administrator he retained his skill as a physician, and he acted as examiner on several subjects for the London, Cambridge, and the Conjoint boards.<br>
<br>Perry married in 1890 Caroline Matilda (<i>d</i>. 1935), second daughter of James MacManus, of Killeaden House, Kiltimagh, co. Mayo; they had one daughter. In 1892, on the death of John Charles Steele, he was appointed superintendent of Guy's Hospital, an office which he held until 1920; he was a governor of the hospital from 1920 to 1937. Perry went twice to Egypt, in 1897 and 1926, in order to assist in the reorganization of the teaching of medicine in the University of Cairo; on the second occasion he became director of the faculty of medicine, in his seventy-first year. Also in 1897 Perry was appointed one of the first visitors for the Prince of Wales's Hospital Fund (later King Edward's Hospital Fund); he served for many years as a member of its distribution committee and was its chairman from 1921 until his death. He was appointed GCVO in 1935 in recognition of his services to the fund.<br>
<br>Perry was elected in 1900 to the senate of the University of London as a representative of the faculty of medicine. He resigned in 1905 but was re-elected in 1915. From 1917 to 1919 he was vice-chancellor, and in 1920, on retiring from Guy's, he was appointed principal of the university; he held this post until 1926. In 1929 he became a member of the committee which redrafted the statutes of the university and he was a crown member of the court from 1930 until his death. In 1916 he was involved with the initiative that led to the formation of the College of Nursing. In accordance with the recommendations of the Athlone committee on postgraduate medical education in London, in 1921, he took a leading part in the foundation of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, instituted by royal charter in 1924, and for many years he was the chairman of the council.<br>
<br>After the South African War, Perry served on a commission appointed to reorganize the Army Medical Service. For his assistance in helping to found the Royal Army Medical College at Millbank he was knighted, in 1903. He received the honorary degree of LLD from the University of London and that of MD from the University of Egypt.<br>
<br>At the end of 1938 Perry suffered a complete right-sided paralysis and he died at his home, Seighford, 25 Mill Road, West Worthing, twelve days later, on 17 December. His body was cremated and his ashes were interred in the church of his old home at Seighford, Staffordshire.<br>
<br>Perry's life was full and many-sided. A classical scholar, a musician, a sound physician and morbid anatomist, and an administrator of unusual quality, he would have made an ideal civil servant. Weighty, wise, deliberate in judgement, knowing just when to wait and watch and when to take decisive action, he could draft a document that could be subtle without deceit, and uncompromising yet courteous. He was a master of concise and lucid English prose. When in doubt as to the clarity of a sentence he had a habit of translating it into the more compact confines of Latin and then retranslating it.<br>
<br>Perry was little known to the public, for he was shy and had few social gifts. He cared little who received the credit for any task as long as it was done, usually by himself. He published practically nothing; his life's work is embodied in minutes, memoranda, and charters. Those who worked behind the scenes knew his value, his intellect, and his constructive capacity. &#145;Bulky, even ungainly, in figure, he was possessed of the most dextrous fingers. No one who ever saw him perform an autopsy could doubt it&#146;  (Cameron, 302).<br>
