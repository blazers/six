<span class="headword">Hicks,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1630&#150;1682), <span class="occ">editor of miscellanies</span>, was generally known as Captain Hicks, and identified himself on title-pages as a native of Oxford. In 1671 he described himself as a resident of Shipton-on-Cherwell, &#145;some four short miles from Oxford&#146;  (W. Hicks, &#145;To the reader&#146;, <span class="italic">Oxford Drollery</span>, 1671). Though the titles <span class="italic">Oxford Drollery</span> and <span class="italic">Oxford Jests</span> may have led readers to assume &#145;that they were written by a scholastical wit&#146;, according to Wood he was born in St Thomas's parish, Oxford, &#145;of poor and dissolute parents&#146;, and was &#145;bred a tapster&#146;. In the 1640s he &#145;became a retainer to the family of Lucas in Colchester&#146; (presumably the household of Sir John Lucas, who became Lord Lucas in 1645) and later served as &#145;clerk to a woodmonger in Deptford&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.490). Evidently he had enough education to be able to make jokes about Latin grammar and vocabulary in <span class="italic">Grammatical Drollery</span> (1682). Hicks was awarded the title of captain at the time of the Restoration as reward for &#145;training the young men, and putting them in a posture of defense&#146;. Wood describes him as &#145;a sharking and indigent fellow while he lived in Oxon, and a great pretender to the art of dancing (which he forsooth would sometimes teach)&#146; and dismisses his writings as &#145;little trivial matters meerly to get bread, and make the pot walk&#146;  (ibid., 3.490).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Oxford Jests</span> was published in 1671 (Wood mentions a 1669 edition, not extant) and reprinted in &#145;refined and enlarged&#146; editions in 1684 and later; a second collection by Hicks, <span class="italic">Coffee-House Jests</span> (1677), was even more popular, with five editions by 1688. The second of Hicks's compilations to be published (&#145;I now appear a second time in Print&#146;, he says in the rhyming preface to the reader) was <span class="italic">Oxford Drollery; being new poems, and songs. The first part, composed by W. H. The second and third parts being, upon several occasions, made by the most eminent and ingenious wits of the said university</span> (1671). Hicks's own poems, described by the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> as &#145;often somewhat licentious&#146;, largely consist of comic songs to existing tunes, with titles such as &#145;The New Scolding Wife&#146;. Poets included in parts two and three include Richard Lovelace, John Suckling, and William Cartwright. <span class="italic">London Drollery, or, The wits academy, being a select collection of the newest songs, lampoons, and airs alamode</span> (1673), another miscellany edited by Hicks, includes an exchange of poems, &#145;On Captain Hicks his Curiosities of Nature: by a Young Lady&#146; and Hicks's &#145;Answer to Madam E. C. upon her Curious Art in Cutting Figures in Paper&#146;. A later collection of verse (this time mostly of Hicks's own composition) is an amusing Latin primer, <span class="italic">Grammatical Drollery, consisting of poems &amp; songs. Wherein the rules of the nouns &amp; verbs in the accedence are pleasantly made easie</span> (1682). &#145;The Battle of the Verbs&#146; is representative:<blockquote>
<div>
<i>Incipio</i> doth begin the battle &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>Poor <i>timeo</i> is afraid, and <i>fugio</i> shuns<br>
</div>
<div>The Battle, <i>sequor</i> follows, <i>curro</i> runs.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Several miscellaneous poems (&#145;A Mock-Song to Beauty&#146;, for example) are also included in the volume.<br>
