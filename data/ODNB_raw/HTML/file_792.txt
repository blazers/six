<span class="headword">Ashworth,  Caleb</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1775), <span class="occ">dissenting minister and tutor</span>, was born at Clough Fold, near Rawtenstall, Rossendale, Lancashire, one of three sons of Richard Ashworth (1667&#150;1751), a Particular Baptist lay preacher. His date of birth is uncertain: in his funeral address in 1775 Samuel Palmer states that Ashworth was &#145;but fifty-three years of age&#146; at his death, and the inscription on his tombstone in Daventry churchyard, recorded in George Baker's <span class="italic">History of the County of Northampton</span>, gives his age as fifty-four, but on the next page Baker gives the year of birth as 1709  (Baker, 1.332&#150;3). His brothers both entered the Baptist ministry: Thomas became a Particular Baptist minister at Heckmondwike, and John, a General Baptist minister, was a colleague of Dr James Foster, who preached his funeral sermon in 1742. Caleb, however, who was probably not in sympathy with his father's religious views, first became a carpenter, but later, in 1739, entered Dr Doddridge's academy at Northampton, where he was educated for the Independent ministry under Dr Philip Doddridge, the celebrated dissenting divine. In 1746 he was appointed assistant to James Floyd, the minister at Daventry, and later that year he became co-pastor of the congregation. A few years later Floyd retired, leaving him in sole charge.<br>
<br>Doddridge intended Ashworth to succeed him in Northampton, both as minister and principal of the academy, and nominated him as such in his will. When Doddridge died in 1751 Ashworth felt that he could not leave his Daventry congregation after so short a time, and so declined the transfer. He did, however, take on the academy, which he moved to new premises in Sheaf Street, Daventry, in 1752, where it remained until 1789.<br>
<br>The academy at Daventry was one of a number set up in the early eighteenth century by nonconformists who were barred from taking degrees at the English universities. Under Ashworth, Daventry Academy became a leading centre of learning for liberal Independents and Presbyterians. A list of his students, who included Joseph Priestley, may be found in the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> (1822). In his autobiography Priestley says that Ashworth took &#145;the orthodox side of every question&#146; in theology and philosophy; the sub-tutor, Samuel Clark, &#145;that of heresy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Correspondence</span>, 1.23). The Doddridge principle of referring to authors on all sides of every question, and of requiring the students to give an account of them, was faithfully followed by his successors, resulting in much independence of judgement. Another pupil, the Revd T. Thomas, said: &#145;Under Dr. Doddridge there was a more popular exterior; under Dr. Ashworth a more disciplined interior&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span>, 1st ser., 9, 1814, 79). A defect of the academy was the neglect of languages, biblical criticism, and ecclesiastical history; its staple was dogmatics and philosophy, including psychology (then called pneumatology), ethics, and physics. For his academy, Ashworth published a Hebrew grammar and a treatise on plane trigonometry; for his congregation, a book, <span class="italic">Tunes</span>. He also published funeral sermons for Isaac Watts (1749), James Floyd (1759), and Samuel Clark, his colleague (1770).<br>
<br>Ashworth was married to a Miss Hemings, with whom he had three sons and three daughters. Their son John entered the academy in 1760, but later became a grazier. On 13 November 1767 Ashworth was awarded the unsolicited honorary degree of DD by Marischal College, Aberdeen. After twenty-nine years of distinguished service to the ministry and academy in Daventry, Caleb Ashworth died in Sheaf Street, on 18 July 1775, of &#145;a dropsy in the chest&#146; (congestive heart failure) after, apparently, a long illness, for Job Orton, another dissenting minister, friend, and associate, wrote at the time: &#145;The death of Dr. Ashworth, though it has been long expected, has been a very painful event to me!&#146; He is buried in an altar tomb in Daventry churchyard with other members of his family.<br>
