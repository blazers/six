<span class="headword">Matheson,  Hilda</span>  (1888&#150;1940), <span class="occ">intelligence officer and director of radio talks</span>, was born on 7 June 1888 at 13 Dealtry Road, Putney, the elder of two children of Donald Matheson, Presbyterian minister, and his wife, Margaret Orr. Since both parents were Scottish the family spent most of their summer holidays in the Scottish highlands where Hilda became a skilled mountaineer. For four years she boarded at St Felix School in Southwold and her history teacher persuaded her to study history at Cambridge. But she had to leave school, aged eighteen, when her father suffered a breakdown and the family moved to the continent. Within three years Hilda became proficient in French, German, and Italian, having lived in France, Stuttgart, and Florence. The family returned to England in 1908 when her father was appointed chaplain to Oxford University's Presbyterian undergraduates, and she enrolled in the Society of Oxford Home Students, now known as St Anne's College, to read history. As a day student she experienced little of the social side of college life, although she participated in the dramatic society, playing a young king in <span class="italic">Eagerheart</span> and then Andromache in Gilbert Murray's version of <span class="italic">The Trojan Women</span>; she was also active in the Student Christian Movement.<br>
<br>Matheson's first employment, in 1911, was as part-time secretary to H. A. L. Fisher at New College, the husband of her economic history tutor, who had just been appointed editor of the <span class="roman">Home University Library</span>. She later worked in a similar capacity for David George Haworth, keeper of the Ashmolean Museum. On the outbreak of war in 1914 she joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment in Wandsworth, but in 1916 was assigned to military intelligence (MI5), and ended her war service working for the British military control office in Rome. Then she worked for Lord Lothian, who recommended her as political secretary to the first female member of parliament, Nancy, Lady Astor. Astor introduced her to the realms of politics, literature, and society. It was while representing Lady Astor that Matheson first met John Reith, who offered her a senior position in the fledgeling British Broadcasting Company. She accepted the appointment, at a salary of &pound;900 a year, with Lady Astor's blessing, as well as a large farewell cheque, in 1926.<br>
<br>Nominally employed to assist J. C. Stobart administer the BBC's education department, Matheson soon became the first director of talks and established the first news section when the company became the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1927. &#145;Always ready to try something different&#146;  (Woodruff, 81), she sought the advice of Lord Lothian and Nancy's husband, Viscount Astor, in helping to determine how the BBC could become a major provider of the news. They recommended that she employ Philip Macer-Wright, the assistant editor of the <span class="italic">Westminster Gazette</span>, and his eleven-page report, &#145;Suggestions for the improvement of the BBC news service&#146;, which he submitted in September 1928, was referred to constantly during the ensuing decades as the BBC refined and expanded its news presentation.<br>
<br>At a time when all broadcast talks had to be scripted, Matheson devoted much time to helping prospective broadcasters express themselves clearly by teaching them how to &#145;write for the ear&#146;. Genuinely interested in ideas as well as people, Matheson saw that BBC talks offered a unique opportunity to bring to the microphone the leading figures of the day, such as H. G. Wells, G. B. Shaw, Winston Churchill, and Harold Nicolson, who later portrayed her in his 1932 novel <span class="italic">Public Faces</span> as a &#145;woman of tact, gaiety and determination &hellip; [whose] office table was unencumbered [who] liked being a female [and] displayed this liking in every curve of her tiny body&#146;  (Nicolson, 1946, 24).<br>
<br>Matheson's colleague Lionel Fielden described her two great qualities as leadership and encouragement, and offers the following account of what it must have been like working during the early days of the BBC at Savoy Hill:<blockquote>The microphone was a gateway to great things; but in what form and to what audience? As the first Director of Talks you held in your hands (at one guinea per talk, then, and the rest persuasion) the most powerful instrument devised by man to mould public opinion for good or ill &hellip; [W]ork was the innumerable letters and interviews which you packed into six years, the reputations you built and fostered, the ceaseless struggle for wider horizons of toleration, the hours of rehearsal and experiment, the frequent &#145;crises&#146;, the everlasting search for ideas, and the whole queer business of discovering, by trial and error, the &#145;technique&#146; of the spoken word over the air. (Matheson)</blockquote>Harold Nicolson was one of those whom Matheson introduced to the new medium of broadcast talks, in 1928, as was his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35903/', "Vita Sackville-West (1892&#150;1962)")</script>, with whom she immediately became involved in an intense lesbian relationship. This did not end until 1931, which coincided with Matheson's resignation from the BBC. Hilda's love letters to Vita, of over 800 pages, remain in Nigel Nicolson's hands.<br>
<br>The primary reason for Matheson's resignation was a change in policy imposed by Reith. The regime of talks she had instituted, by &#145;left-wing liberals&#146;, evoked criticism in the &#145;right-wing&#146; daily press. To deal with these objections Reith imposed a regime of censorship, which even embargoed reviews of new novels, declaring that he wanted to instil a sense of &#145;responsibility to the older generation&#146; (explaining Fielden's remark about her departure as (&#145;the Blimps were on the warpath and you and your kind were doomed&#146;; Matheson, 36). For her part, Matheson believed it was &#145;equally part of our responsibility to provide for the intellectual needs of the intervening generations&#146; and stated that she &#145;could not loyally administer a policy which seemed to be turning into a reversal of what I had been instrumental in helping to build up&#146;  (Astor MS 1416/1/1/962).<br>
<br>Matheson's resignation was announced in December 1931 and caused a stir in the columns of Liberal and left-wing newspapers, and Lady Astor even tried to persuade the MP Walter Elliott to use his influence to have Matheson appointed to the BBC board of governors  (Astor MS 1416/1/1/962, 9 Dec 1931). But Matheson was already involved in new ventures, rejecting an offer from Leonard Woolf to administer the Hogarth Press  (Leonard Woolf archives, Sx MS 13) so that she could become the radio critic on the Astor-owned <span class="italic">Observer</span> and write a column in the <span class="italic">Week-End Review</span>. Matheson's revenge on Reith was sweet when her old friend H. A. L. Fisher commissioned her to write a book for the <span class="roman">Home University Library</span>, <span class="italic">Broadcasting</span>, which was published in 1933 and is still quoted. As soon as this was published Lord Lothian, at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, persuaded the Carnegie Trust to finance an important research study on British colonial policy, and Matheson was paid &pound;400 a year for working two days a week. Its director was Sir Malcolm (later Lord) Hailey, whose work on the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> prevented him from taking up his duties until 1935, and ill health during 1937&#150;8 meant that the burden of producing the <span class="italic">African Survey</span>, of over 2000 pages, published in 1938, devolved on Matheson, for which she was made OBE in 1939.<br>
<br>After leaving the BBC in January 1932 Matheson developed a stable relationship with the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36826/', "Dorothy Violet Wellesley, duchess of Wellington (1889&#150;1956)")</script>, and made her home on Wellesley's estate in Sussex. It was Dorothy who suggested a recuperative visit to the Riviera in December 1938, and there they met W. B. Yeats and his wife, George. In 1937 Dorothy had co-edited a series of the <span class="italic">Broadsheet</span> with W. B. Yeats, who regularly stayed at her country estate, Penn on the Rocks. In what was to be the last week of his life Yeats asked Hilda to compose a setting for one of Dorothy's poems, which she sang for him. A longtime member of the Bach Choir, Hilda counted Dame Ethel Smyth among her close friends, and also the Australian composer and writer W. J. Turner, who was a fellow guest at the soir&eacute;e with Yeats and later figured prominently in Matheson's last venture.<br>
<br>By the summer of 1939 Matheson was again involved in military intelligence, having turned down an offer of the principalship of her alma mater. She became founder director of the joint broadcasting committee on a salary of &pound;1000 per annum, responsible for arranging the broadcasting by foreign radio stations of British information and opinions, recording programmes in German and Italian, and scripting programmes for dispatch to neutral countries. Among others, her staff included Guy Burgess, W. J. Turner, Elspeth Huxley, and the former foreign director at the BBC, Isa Benzie. By February 1940 there were over thirty on her staff, out of a projected forty-five, and the committee's programmes were broadcast regularly in eight neutral European countries and three in Latin America. As well as setting this up, in competition to the BBC, Matheson was also responsible for initiating a publishing venture entitled <span class="roman">Britain in Pictures</span>, designed to counteract the publication in Germany of illustrated books glorifying the German empire and its soldiers, musicians, poets, cities, and mountains, distributed in neutral countries. Almost 140 volumes of <span class="roman">Britain in Pictures</span> were eventually published. Dorothy Wellesley was a director, alongside Hilda and W. J. Turner, and the first books were published from Rocks Farm, Withyham, in Sussex, which was Matheson's home on Dorothy's estate.<br>
<br>On 14 October 1940 Matheson wrote to Lady Astor soliciting her recommendation of an American publisher for this venture. But on 30 October she died of Graves' disease (a toxic goitre), following surgery for partial thyroidectomy, at Kettlewell Hill Nursing Home, Horsell, Surrey. Dorothy Wellesley erected a memorial to &#145;that wonderful friend [who] understood poetic genius&#146; at Penn on the Rocks, inscribed &#145;Amica amicorum&#146;. Michael Carney, Matheson's biographer, believed the <span class="italic">African Survey</span> was her most enduring work, which British colonial policy makers regularly consulted until the 1960s, and extensive comments on radio drama from her book <span class="italic">Broadcasting</span> figure in Tim Crook's <span class="italic">Radio Drama: Theory and Practice</span> (1999).<br>
