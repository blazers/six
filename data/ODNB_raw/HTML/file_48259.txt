<span class="headword">Hofmann,  August Wilhelm</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Georg Christian Wilhelm August Hofmann]</span>, Baron von Hofmann in the Prussian nobility  (1818&#150;1892), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born in Giessen (in the state of Hesse) on 8 April 1818, the youngest of the six children of Johann Philipp Hofmann (1776&#150;1843), a government architect, and (Friederike) Wilhelmine Badenius (1780&#150;1854). After attending local schools and studying while living with an uncle, in 1836 he matriculated at Giessen, but was uncertain whether to study law, philology, or architecture. The most celebrated member of the Giessen faculty at this time was the chemist Justus Liebig, whose revolutionary scientific work and innovative educational methods were making him world famous. Liebig's success was such that repeated expansions of his laboratory were necessary, the crucial one of 1839 having been designed and directed by Hofmann's father. Hofmann studied with Liebig, earned the doctorate in 1841, then continued in Giessen with his research. Hofmann's first scientific paper (1843) was the earliest competent investigation of coal tar; this work provided the foundation of much of his future career. Concentrating on the organic bases, Hofmann isolated and identified aniline (phenylamine, a centrally important aromatic substance), and took the first steps towards an understanding of its constitution and chemical relationships. In the same year Liebig made Hofmann his private assistant, and the young chemist began planning a scholarly career. Since a chemical professorship was unlikely to become available to him in Giessen, in the spring of 1845 Hofmann transferred to the University of Bonn. He was anxious to achieve the financial means to marry his intended, Helene Moldenhauer (1824&#150;1852), Liebig's niece.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in London, plans were being laid for a new private college of chemistry. The impetus for this development came from Liebig himself, who visited England in 1837 and again in 1842, effectively publicizing the usefulness of chemistry to technology. A group of technically knowledgeable investors in London sought the advice of Liebig and the help of the British government for this plan; Prince Albert played an instrumental role. Liebig recommended Hofmann to lead the new enterprise. Hofmann wanted assurance from the Prussian authorities that he could return to Bonn if the new school were to collapse. To ensure this, Prince Albert used his German connections to arrange that Hofmann be promoted to <i>extraordinarius</i> (associate professor) in order to be eligible for a two-year leave of absence from the university. Thus Hofmann became sole professor and director of the Royal College of Chemistry, established in October 1845 in rented rooms in a house on George Street, Hanover Square. Twenty-six students enrolled for the first session, among them several who later achieved recognition in the science, such as Warren De la Rue, Frederick Abel, and Edward Nicholson. The following summer a new building for the college was erected nearby, in Oxford Street, the cornerstone being laid by the prince consort. In the same year, on 12 August, Hofmann married Helene Moldenhauer.<br>
<br>The two guiding ideas behind the Royal College of Chemistry were the transplantation of the highly acclaimed Liebigian science pedagogy into Great Britain, and the establishment of an institution where students could be trained for practical careers in agriculture, pharmacy, and chemical industry. There was tension between these goals, for the former, strongly favoured by Hofmann, stressed the value of basic research, while the latter, preferred by the shareholders and members of the council, emphasized practical applications. The pecuniary arrangements with Hofmann were generous, but a shortage of student customers meant that the council had increasing difficulty meeting its contractual obligations. Consequently, the college gradually sank into insolvency.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Hofmann's boundless energy, captivating teaching talent, and scientific brilliance began to lay the foundation of his future fame. After a pause in his research while establishing the college, he continued his investigations of organic compounds containing nitrogen. Hofmann's phenomenal burst of creative work from 1848 to 1851 has few parallels in the history of chemistry. This is all the more remarkable when it is considered&#151;as all witnesses uniformly testify&#151;that he was unskilled in manual laboratory operations. However, he had an uncanny knack for selecting outstandingly talented experimentalists among his students and junior colleagues, and was always careful publicly to acknowledge their important assistance.<br>
<br>In compensation for his own lack of manual dexterity Hofmann held his laboratory to rigorous working standards, and he possessed superb scientific skills, including remarkable chemical intuition. If it was often the hands of students and junior colleagues doing the manipulating in Hofmann's lab, they were usually being guided by the ideas of their leader. This is not to suggest that Hofmann was a high theorist&#151;indeed, he was more inclined towards a conventionalist or instrumentalist stance toward scientific theories&#151;but he was exquisitely responsive to leading ideas in the science, and he developed a nearly unerring sense of fruitful directions to explore.<br>
<br>This was, indeed, a labile period in chemical theory. In the 1830s and 1840s the French chemists Auguste Laurent and Charles Gerhardt pointed to emergent weaknesses in the prevailing dualistic theory of organic compounds, in which molecules were depicted as held together by polar electrochemical forces. Laurent and Gerhardt sought to build a more holistic, non-electrochemical theory, based upon the substitutability of atoms and emphasizing the presumed arrangements of atoms within molecules. In the period of Hofmann's education and early career, these ideas were largely ignored by the leaders of French, English, and German chemistry&#151;including Hofmann's mentor, Liebig.<br>
<br>Hofmann's conversion to the ideas of Laurent and Gerhardt dates from 1848, when he encountered a chemical phenomenon that could be explained only by the French theory: the inability of aniline to form a nitrile (organic cyanide). Hofmann's new substitutionist viewpoint, together with the nearly simultaneous and similarly inspired work of his collegial friends Adolphe Wurtz (of the Paris Facult&eacute; de M&eacute;decine) and Alexander Williamson (of University College, London), provided the starting point for Hofmann's masterwork. The theories of Laurent and Gerhardt had been largely schematic; Hofmann's studies substantiated them through experimental evidence. In papers published in 1849, 1850, and 1851, Hofmann described the preparation and studied the properties of dozens of new substituted ammonias, including mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-methyl, ethyl, and amyl amines and anilines. Just as Williamson succeeded in outlining a new &#145;water type&#146; based on what soon would be referred to as the divalence of oxygen atoms, so Wurtz and especially Hofmann created the &#145;ammonia type&#146;, which was based on the ability of nitrogen atoms to create connections to three different atoms or groups. These developments utterly transformed the science of chemistry during the 1850s, leading to the formulation of the theory of atomic valence (with the participation of Edward Frankland and others) and the theory of chemical structure (proposed formally by August Kekul&eacute; and Archibald Couper in 1858).<br>
<br>Hofmann's novel nitrogenous aromatic compounds proved as momentous for industrial research as they had for theoretical chemistry. After Hofmann's young student William Henry Perkin dropped out of the college (against Hofmann's advice) and made a fortune on his newly discovered aniline purple (mauve), the first successful dye derived from coal tar, Hofmann himself became interested in similar substances. From 1862 he studied reactions connected with rosaniline (magenta), the second major synthetic organic dye; in 1863 he created two new hues in collaboration with his former student Nicholson, who like Perkin had become a chemical industrialist. These colours, called &#145;Hofmann violets&#146;, were the first commercially successful fine chemicals developed with the aid of specific knowledge derived from basic research, and their licensed production made both Nicholson and Hofmann a great deal of money. The age of synthetic chemicals, behind which lay Hofmann's pedagogy and research, had begun. However, although he ever after derived significant income from his work with coal-tar dyes, he never became an entrepreneur or an industrialist himself, always preferring the roles of the pure scientist and the consultant.<br>
<br>In his London years Hofmann became a central player in British chemistry, indeed in British science. His growing international fame led to several offers from German universities. In the early 1860s, Hofmann found himself negotiating simultaneously with two major universities, Berlin and Bonn; in their efforts to attract Hofmann both institutions built magnificent new chemical institutes. These were the first of a new generation of academic laboratory buildings, representing a quantum leap in scale and outfitting. It was Berlin that Hofmann chose, partly because of his attraction to the Prussian capital. Although he began teaching there in April 1865, his international prestige and negotiating power was such that he held exclusive options on all three positions (including London) from late 1863 until the end of 1866. England had lost Hofmann to his homeland, but his two decades in London had had a decisive impact on the teaching and practice of British laboratory science, as well as on British chemical technology.<br>
<br>Just as he had succeeded in transplanting effective Liebig-style group research to Great Britain, Hofmann's Berlin laboratory served as the rallying point for a rejuvenation of the chemical sciences in Prussia. The research productivity was enormous, indeed unprecedented in scope. Hofmann supervised more than 150 doctoral dissertations, and a total of about 900 papers emerged from the laboratory during his time there&#151;about 150 by Hofmann himself. In addition to these contributions, Hofmann wrote an elementary textbook, a number of occasional pieces, and over fifty important biographies of his colleagues. In April 1888 he was raised to the Prussian hereditary nobility; he was thereafter called von Hofmann.<br>
<br>Hofmann became the unofficial (but universally acknowledged) leader of German chemistry. His scientific success contrasts with his private misfortunes, for his first wife's early death in 1852 was followed by those of his second, Rosamund Wilson (1838&#150;1860), an Englishwoman, whom he married 13 December 1856, and third, Elise Moldenhauer (1845&#150;1871), whom he married on 19 May 1866, both of whom died before the age of thirty. His fourth wife, however, Bertha Tiemann (1854&#150;1922), whom he married on 11 August 1873, outlived him by thirty years. Possessed of outstanding health himself, Hofmann was hardly ill until suddenly struck down on 5 May 1892 with a heart attack. He was buried, amid great splendour, in the Dorotheenst&auml;dtischer cemetery in Berlin.<br>
