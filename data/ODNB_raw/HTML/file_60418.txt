<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Spain,  Nancy Brooker</span>  (1917&#150;1964), <span class="occ">journalist and broadcaster</span>, was born on 13 September 1917 at 1 Archbold Terrace, Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne, the second and youngest daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel George Redesdale Brooker Spain (1877&#150;1961), land agent and volunteer soldier, and his wife, Norah Elizabeth (1886&#150;1964), daughter of William Holmes Smiles of Belfast and his wife, Lucy. Her grandfather was the eminent Victorian writer and philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36125/', "Samuel Smiles (1812&#150;1904)")</script>, author of <span class="italic">Self-Help</span> (1859). She was the great-niece of Isabella Mary Beeton (1836&#150;1865), author of the classic <span class="italic">Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management</span> (1861); in 1948 she wrote a biography of her great-aunt's short but eventful life. From 1931 to 1935, she was educated at the world-famous girls' school Roedean in Sussex, a place she loathed.<br>
<br>After leaving school, Spain turned her hand to amateur sports on her native Tyneside, excelling in ladies' tennis, lacrosse, and cricket. This led her into journalism; she became a cub sports reporter for the <span class="italic">Newcastle Journal</span> and other north-country papers, and she combined this with regular performances in local radio drama productions. Her sporting activities introduced her to Winifrid (Bin) Sargeant (1912&#150;1939), a well-known Tyneside sportswoman with whom she had her first serious love affair. Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War she joined the Women's Royal Naval Service, serving as a driver, before becoming an officer and working for its press office in London. She was invalided out of the service in early 1945. Her early service days inspired her first book, the autobiographical <span class="italic">Thank you Nelson</span> (1945), which became a best-seller and paved the way for her subsequent light literary career as a self-styled &#145;trouser-wearing character called N. Spain&#146;  (Spain, <span class="italic">A Funny Thing Happened on the Way</span>, 45). She wrote a series of camp detective novels, including <span class="italic">Poison for Teacher</span> (1949), inspired by her Roedean days and set in an all-girls school called Radcliffe Hall.<br>
<br>In 1950, while editing the literary magazine <span class="italic">Books of Today</span>, Spain met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/60421/', "Joan Ann Werner Laurie (1920&#150;1964)")</script>, a book and magazine editor, who became her life partner and with whom she established an unorthodox household, consisting of Joan's son Nicholas; Thomas, passed off as Joan's youngest son, but in fact Nancy's son from a brief liaison with Philip Youngman Carter, the husband of the crime novelist Margery Allingham; and Sheila Van Damm, the racing driver.<br>
<br>After a spell at <span class="italic">Good Housekeeping</span> magazine, Spain joined the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> in 1952, becoming one of the brightest stars in Lord Beaverbrook's firmament of &#145;personality&#146; journalists, first as books editor and then as celebrity interviewer, peppering her articles with references to &#145;my friend Noel Coward&#146; and &#145;my friend Marlene Dietrich&#146; (with whom she had a brief romance). She cut a striking figure on Fleet Street, with her cropped hair, monogrammed men's shirts, baggy jumpers, and trousers. However, when more formal occasions required, she would borrow couturier dresses from her designer sister Liz Hulse or from her close friend and lover Ginette Spanier (1904&#150;1988), directrice of Balmain.<br>
<br>In 1956 Spain and her employers were successfully sued for libel by Evelyn Waugh, as she had claimed that his brother Alec outsold him. She survived this hiccup and continued with the paper until 1961, when she left to join the <span class="italic">News of the World</span> as a &#145;stunt/personality&#146; journalist. Throughout the fifties and early sixties she became one of the most popular and recognizable radio personalities; she was a regular and much-requested contributor to <span class="italic">Woman's Hour</span> and a panellist on the internationally famous literary quiz <span class="italic">My Word</span>, from 1954 to 1964, alongside Frank Muir and Denis Norden. Her unconventional appearance and mischievous personality also made her a hit on television panel games, most notably <span class="italic">What's my Line?</span> and <span class="italic">Juke Box Jury</span>. Her appearances with the irascible Gilbert Harding (1907&#150;1960) helped fuel the long-running and implausible rumour that the pair were to be married.<br>
<br>Spain was due to cover the Grand National on 21 March 1964 when the Piper Apache plane carrying her, Joan Werner Laurie, and two other passengers crashed outside Aintree racecourse, killing everyone on board. As she and Joan had interchangeable wills, this resulted in both estates passing to Joan's son Nicholas; Nancy's son Thomas inherited nothing. No&euml;l Coward wrote in his diaries: &#145;It is cruel that all that gaiety, intelligence and vitality should be snuffed out when so many bores and horrors are left living&#146;  (<span class="italic">Coward Diaries</span>, 560). Spain was cremated at Golders Green on 26 March, and her ashes were placed in the family grave in Horsley, Northumberland.<br>
