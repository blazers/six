<span class="headword">Tate,  George</span>  (1746&#150;1821), <span class="occ">naval officer in the Russian service</span>, was born on 14 June 1746 near London. He was the third son of George Tate (1700&#150;1794) and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1770). His father had served in the Russian fleet in the era of Peter the Great and later acted as a British Admiralty agent for securing mast timber, first in Russia and then in New England. Tate grew up on the Maine coast and pursued a career at sea. After the tragic accidental death of his mother in 1770 his father helped him gain a commission in the Russian navy.<br>
<br>In the <i>Count Orlov</i> Tate saw action in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768&#150;74 at the great battle of Chesma in the Mediterranean (1770). He remained in the Black Sea Fleet until the mid-1770s, when he was promoted captain. He then commanded ships based in Kronstadt and Archangel, before returning to the Black Sea for Catherine the Great's Russo-Turkish War of 1787&#150;92. Tate was wounded at the siege of Izmail and returned to the north again to take part in the war against Sweden (1788&#150;90) in the Baltic Sea battles of &Aring;land, H&ouml;gland, and Reval. After his capture of an enemy warship at Viborg he was presented with a miniature of the empress set in diamonds. A seasoned combat commander, Tate was promoted rear-admiral in 1793.<br>
<br>In 1798 he was made vice-admiral in the Baltic fleet and won the order of St Anne. During the War of the Second Coalition, Tate took part in the combined Anglo-Russian fleet operations off the Netherlands; but when Emperor Paul reversed his alliances and broke diplomatic relations with England, Tate, with other officers of British origin, was removed from his post and was obliged to spend the winter of 1800&#150;1 in Moscow.<br>
<br>In a letter to his brother Robert, Tate wrote that &#145;the death of the late Emperor put affairs on the old footing&#146;  (Holden, 36). Tsar Alexander re-established relations with England and in 1802 rewarded Tate with a promotion to admiral and an order of St George for his participation in eighteen naval campaigns. After the peace treaty of Tilsit in 1807 Tate was kept ashore again for over two years and wrote to his brother Samuel, &#145;&hellip; my income is greatly curtailed&#146;  (ibid., 36). Despite his advanced age Tate returned to service during the crisis of 1812. In the victory the admiral was accorded an honour seldom bestowed upon foreigners, an appointment to the Russian senate, and he was again showered with decorations, including the orders of Alexander Nevsky and St Vladimir.<br>
<br>Admiral Tate died in St Petersburg on 17 February 1821. He never married but had kept contact with his relatives in England and New England. Brothers Robert and Samuel, both merchant captains, did not survive him. His estate was divided among his brother William, who had settled in England, his nieces and nephews in Maine, and two godsons in Russia, Edward Simpson and James Booker.<br>
