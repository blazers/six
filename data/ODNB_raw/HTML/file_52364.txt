<span class="headword">Hume,  Hamilton</span>  (1797&#150;1873), <span class="occ">explorer in Australia</span>, was born at Toongabbie near Parramatta, New South Wales, on 19 June 1797, the son of Andrew Hamilton Hume (1762&#150;1849), superintendent of convicts, and Elizabeth More, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kennedy (1760&#150;1847), a clergyman's daughter from Kent who had emigrated in 1795 with her brother, a free settler, and had married in New South Wales on 29 September 1796. Hamilton Hume, the eldest of their five children, was educated at home by his mother. He made his first significant excursion at the age of seventeen from their home at Appin, about 40 miles south-west of Sydney. Such excursions put his services in demand for exploring parties. In March 1818 he accompanied the surveyor James Meehan (1774&#150;1826) to the south-west, when the upper portions of the Shoalhaven River, Lake Bathurst, and the Goulburn plains were discovered. In 1819, with John Oxley and Meehan, he explored Jervis Bay, and returned overland to Sydney with Meehan by way of Bong Bong. Two years later he discovered the Yass plains. In 1822, with Alexander Berry and Thomas Davison, he climbed on to Captain Cook's Pigeon House Mountain from the Clyde River. For his early exploratory work, Hume was granted 400 acres at Appin.<br>
<br>In 1824 Hume undertook the first overland journey from the central coast of New South Wales to the south coast of the continent at Port Phillip on Bass Strait. He was accompanied by <a name="cosubject_52364"></a><span class="headword">William Hilton Hovell</span>  (1786&#150;1875)<span class="occ"></span>, a former sailor, born at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on 26 April 1786. A seaman from the age of ten, he had been master of trading vessels since he was twenty-two. His first wife was Esther, the daughter of Thomas Arndell, a surgeon on the first fleet, and his wife, Esther Foscari; they had two children, a daughter and a son. Hovell and his family arrived at Sydney in 1813. He was granted 700 acres at Narellan, not far from Appin, though he did not settle there until December 1816, when he forsook the sea to become a merchant. His investigation of the Burragorang valley in 1823 led Governor Brisbane to persuade him to join Hume on the Port Phillip expedition.<br>
<br>The two men left Appin on 2 October 1824, accompanied by six convict assigned servants. They passed Yass plains and crossed the Murrumbidgee River on 19 October. Although they endeavoured to travel in a direct south-west line to Western Port, rugged mountain country forced them south, then at Tumbarumba they had no option but to turn west before weaving across the Murray and Mitta Mitta rivers. Near Tumbarumba, on 8 November, they became the first colonists to see the Australian Alps, clearly snow-clad, some 40 miles to the south. They then crossed the rivers Ovens, King, and Goulburn (3 December), naming the Murray and Goulburn rivers the Hume and Hovell respectively. Turned around by Mount Disappointment, they proceeded by a line further west and reached Corio Bay on the western side of Port Phillip Bay on 16 December, thinking it was Western Port. Hovell corrected this impression in February 1827 during his valuable exploratory probes around Western Port, when he accompanied the expedition which established a short-lived period settlement there. The faster return journey ended at Hume's station north of Lake George on 18 January 1825. Their diagonal trail through six degrees of longitude and four degrees of latitude had lifted the veil from what was to become one of the most vitally important portions of Australia. They each received a grant of 1200 acres, which they sold to defray expedition expenses. Hovell received a further 1280 acres for his later work at Western Port. He had kept a very good record of the route taken in 1824&#150;5, which formed the essential data for William Bland's 1831 book of that journey.<br>
<br>On 8 November 1825 Hume married Elizabeth Dight, the second daughter of John and Hannah Dight of Richmond, New South Wales. They had no children. Hume ably assisted Charles Sturt in the expedition from 7 December 1828 to 21 April 1829 which solved the mystery of the Macquarie marshes and discovered the great Darling River on 1 February 1829. For this and other exploratory work concerning routes over the Blue Mountains he received a further 3200 acres in grants, which he took near Yass. From 1839 he lived as a grazier there at Cooma Cottage, and eventually he held 18,000 acres in this vicinity. Resourceful, courageous, and a great bushman, Hume was jealous of sharing any of his laurels, and when Hovell was f&ecirc;ted in Melbourne in 1853 he produced a lengthy pamphlet, <span class="italic">A brief statement of facts in connection with an overland expedition from Lake George to Port Phillip in 1824</span> (1855), which was excessively unfair to Hovell. Hume became increasingly obsessed with what he believed to be a playing down of his importance, and a second edition followed in 1873. Hovell's published replies (1855 and 1874) had no effect on the tirade, which, with the publication of a third edition of Hume's pamphlet in 1874 and a fourth in 1897, sent influences well into the twentieth century. Hume was made a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1860, and was honoured by his countrymen. He died at Cooma Cottage on 19 April 1873 and was buried in Yass cemetery.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife, Hovell married Sophia Wilkinson (<i>d</i>. 1876) in 1848; they had no children. After his death, on 9 November 1875 at Sydney, she bequeathed &pound;6000 to the University of Sydney to fund the W. H. Hovell lectureship in geology and physical geography. Hovell was buried at Goulburn.<br>
