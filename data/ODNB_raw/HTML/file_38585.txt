<span class="headword">Allingham <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Paterson]</span>,  Helen Mary Elizabeth</span>  (1848&#150;1926), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was born on 26 September 1848 at Swadlincote, Derbyshire, the eldest of the seven children (three boys and four girls) of Alexander Henry Paterson (1825&#150;1862), medical practitioner and surgeon, and his wife, Mary Chance Herford (1824&#150;1894), daughter of John Herford, a Manchester wine merchant. Both her parents came from staunchly Unitarian families with Unitarian ministers on both sides, although she was not especially observant herself. On her mother's side, Helen Paterson was related to eminent Unitarians such as Joseph Priestley, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Bessie Parkes. She inherited artistic talent from this side of her family too: her grandmother, Sarah Smith Herford, gained limited recognition for her oil painting, and Helen's aunt, Laura Herford, was the first woman to gain admission to the Royal Academy Schools in 1860.<br>
<br>Within a year of Helen's birth the Paterson family moved to Altrincham, Cheshire, where the Herfords lived. She grew up in an enlightened middle-class family environment and received her early education at the Unitarian School for Girls in Altrincham founded by her grandmother. Of medium height and thin, with fairish hair, she became a rather reserved character, very close to her family and a small circle of friends. Following the death of Helen's father and youngest sister in a diphtheria epidemic in 1862, the family moved to Birmingham to live with her paternal grandmother and aunts. Financial difficulties experienced during these years had a profound effect on her, teaching her the importance of thrift; she became a hard-working and consistent supporter of her family for the rest of her life. From 1862 to 1866 she attended the Government School of Design in Birmingham where she was awarded prizes for her art. In 1866 she enrolled at the Female School of Art in Bloomsbury, prior to entry to the Royal Academy Schools in 1868: nominally she remained a student until 1872 but she rarely attended after 1870 as she became disillusioned with the lack of tuition. Only the academician Frederick Walker encouraged her desire to paint in watercolour. His influence can be seen in her choice of subjects during the 1870s, in which a large figure dominated the picture and landscape is of secondary importance.<br>
<br>From mid-1868 Helen Paterson also worked as a freelance illustrator for various children's magazines such as <span class="italic">Once a Week</span> and <span class="italic">Little Folks</span>. In January 1870 this led to a permanent position as illustrator on a new weekly periodical, <span class="italic">The Graphic</span>, whose visual content was innovative. She was the only woman on the staff. That same year she started exhibiting with two drawings at the Dudley Gallery in Piccadilly. In 1872 she attended evening classes at the Slade School alongside Kate Greenaway, a lifelong friend. Helen illustrated Thomas Hardy's novel <span class="italic">Far from the Madding Crowd</span> when it was first serialized in <span class="italic">Cornhill</span> magazine in 1872, and Annie Thackeray's novel <span class="italic">Miss Angel</span> for the same journal in 1875. Hardy admired her illustrations for his first truly successful novel and later asked her to illustrate <span class="italic">A Laodicean</span>, an offer that she declined. She exhibited two paintings at the Royal Academy in 1874 entitled <span class="italic">Wait for me</span> and <span class="italic">The Milkmaid</span>.<br>
<br>On 22 August 1874 Helen Paterson married the Irish poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/405/', "William Allingham (1824&#150;1889)")</script> at the Unitarian Chapel, Little Portland Place, London. There were three children of the marriage, Gerald Carlyle (<i>b</i>. 1875), Eva Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1877), and Henry William (<i>b</i>. 1882). After her marriage Helen Allingham relinquished her post on <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> and from 1874 concentrated on her painting. She moved into circles which included her husband's artistic friends such as Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris and literary figures including Thomas Carlyle and Alfred Lord Tennyson. She illustrated her husband's book of children's poetry <span class="italic">Rhymes for the Young Folk</span> (1885) using their children as models for the sketches. In 1875 her painting achieved recognition when she was elected associate of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours; she was the first woman to be granted full membership in 1890. She exhibited annually at the society from 1875 until 1925.<br>
<br>Although Allingham painted some seaside scenes in the late 1870s and early 1880s during family holidays in Kent and the Isle of Wight, it was rural life which really inspired her. In 1881 the family moved to Sandhills, near Witley, Surrey, where Birket Foster and Edmund Evans were already living. The surrounding cottages and countryside determined the work for which she is best known. From then on she rejected the use of bodycolour in favour of pure watercolour and followed Walker's lead in painting <i>en plein air</i> for most of the year. She depicted the cottages she saw around her in Sandhills with minute attention to detail such as the mortar round a chimney or moss on roof tiles. Children&#151;often her own&#151;appeared in her scenes, as did young women engaged in various gentle rural pursuits or just watching the world go by. During the 1880s her figures became smaller, taking their place in the landscape, while the cottages grew in significance. It was Helen Allingham's ability to paint a romantic view of rural life with exquisite precision that captured the public's imagination. Friendship with her Surrey neighbour Gertrude Jekyll introduced garden scenes into Helen's pictures with the flowers painted in similar detail. Her cottage paintings were so popular that the Fine Art Society invited her to hold her first one-woman exhibition of sixty-six pictures entitled &#145;Surrey cottages&#146; in 1886 and another six months later. Thereafter she generally exhibited twice a year at the Fine Art Society until 1913, as well as exhibiting elsewhere.<br>
<br>William Allingham's ill health brought the family back to London&#151;this time Hampstead&#151;in 1888 where Helen was left a widow a few months later at the height of her popularity but with little money and three children to support. She continued painting six days a week, travelling around Middlesex and Buckinghamshire and to the west country to paint the cottage scenes the public craved, though she herself was tiring of her subject matter. After 1900 when her popularity began to wane, Allingham searched for new subject matter. In 1901 and 1902 she visited Venice, but the sixty watercolours resulting from these tours have never been as popular as her English cottage scenes. She occasionally painted portraits of children and of her husband's friends including Thomas Carlyle and Alfred Lord Tennyson, but these were usually private commissions. Her paintings were used to illustrate books such as Marcus Huish's <span class="italic">Happy England</span> (1903), a description of her life and art; her brother Arthur Paterson's <span class="italic">Homes of Tennyson</span> (1905); and Stewart Dick's <span class="italic">Cottage Homes of England</span> (1909). She herself published editions of <span class="italic">William Allingham's Diaries</span> with Dollie Radford (1907) and <span class="italic">Letters to William Allingham</span> with Mrs E. Baumer Williams (1911).<br>
<br>After the First World War, Helen Allingham's scenes lost favour and were considered old-fashioned and sentimental, though she continued working as hard as ever producing cottage paintings. On 28 September 1926 she died of acute peritonitis while staying with a friend at Valewood House, Haslemere, Surrey, where she had gone to paint. She was cremated at Golders Green on 2 October 1926. A plaque commemorating her life was erected inside Rosslyn Hill Chapel, Hampstead, London. After her death, Allingham's works remained unfashionable until the 1980s. Viewed as overly sentimental and pretty, they were dismissed as the product of a woman artist. Allingham herself had no interest in the feminist movement (and her paintings showed country women enshrined in traditional domesticity), but her style and choice of subjects cannot be attributed entirely to a desire to remain within &#145;womanly&#146; bounds. Financial considerations were clearly her prime motivation, and when her cottage scenes lost their commercial appeal, she exhibited an ability to explore new subjects. While it may seem strange that a pupil of Frederick Walker and an illustrator for <span class="italic">The Graphic</span> was so unaffected by the social realism of fellow artists of the 1870s, her paintings deserve to be assessed on their own merits and recognized as among the best of their genre. In her choice of subject matter, Helen Allingham&#151;like the Pre-Raphaelites&#151;harked back to an idyllic past that never really existed. She played an important role in the late nineteenth-century idealization of the English countryside and the growth of a nostalgic movement for the preservation of rural life and crafts. Her cottage scenes remain the most popular, but her finest works are considered to be the few domestic interiors that she painted, often using her own children as models. Many of her paintings can be found in the Hampstead Museum, Burgh House; the Victoria and Albert Museum; and the British Museum, London.<br>
