<span class="headword">Holmes,  David</span>  (1843&#150;1906), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 16 November 1843 at Nelson Street, Manchester, the illegitimate son of Mary Holmes, a hand-loom weaver. His mother came from north-east Lancashire, and Holmes was weaving by the time he was eight. At the age of ten he absconded to live with an uncle in Padiham. Here, he turned to power-loom weaving, made up for his earlier lack of schooling by attending Sunday and evening classes at the Unitarian chapel, and in 1859 became involved in his first strike. He married in the early 1860s and removed to nearby Burnley, where he lived for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>The 1850s had seen both the final transition from outwork to factory production in cotton and the first attempts by weavers' unions in the different Lancashire towns to secure uniform lists of piece-rates for their industry. However, the cotton &#145;famine&#146; of the early 1860s seriously damaged the fledgeling unions, and when industrial expansion was resumed the task of devising a regular system of industrial relations had to begin all over again. Holmes played a leading part in setting up the Burnley Weavers' Association, and served as its president from 1871 until his death. During the union's early years, the peculiarly fragmented structure of the weaving industry around Burnley meant difficulties in persuading employers and weavers alike of the merits of collective bargaining. Holmes was blacklisted for his activities, and the union, too poor to pay a regular salary, set him up as a rag-and-bone man. A lengthy, violent, and unsuccessful county-wide strike to prevent wage reductions during the recession of 1878 demonstrated the need for more effective co-operation between the weavers of the different towns. How this might be achieved became apparent when the employers demanded a further cut at the end of 1883: the Burnley weavers were persuaded by Holmes to accept the reduction and remain at work in order to be able to subsidize the Blackburn weavers, who struck against it. This tactic convinced both the local unions and the leading employers of the advantages of uniform wage-rates agreed by formal negotiation and enforced by the threat of partial strike action. The Northern Counties Amalgamated Association of Weavers, set up under Holmes's presidency in 1884 to pursue these objectives, steadily increased its membership and built up an impressive strike fund. In 1892 collective bargaining finally produced a comprehensive uniform list of piece-rates for cotton weaving, and the industry remained free from further major strikes until after Holmes's death.<br>
<br>By the early 1890s the cotton industry was held up as a model of good labour relations and David Holmes was the acknowledged master of one of the country's largest, richest, and most effectively organized trade unions. At home in Burnley he had become a figure of considerable consequence: member of the school board, town councillor, JP, vice-president of the Liberal Association, and a man whose name was seriously discussed on several occasions as a possible parliamentary candidate. His impact on the national trade union movement was even more significant, thanks to his role on the parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress, on which he served almost continuously between 1892 and 1904 and which he chaired in 1894&#150;5. A zealous opponent of socialism and a hard-nosed critic of both the pretensions and the practices of the so-called &#145;new unions&#146; which had emerged in 1889&#150;90, Holmes was the key figure in the back-stage <i>coup</i> which forced the system of card-voting on the 1895 congress and thereby demonstrated the weakness of the new unions, compared with the real &#145;mass unions&#146; in coal and cotton. His stature within British trade unionism was reflected in the international conferences and delegations in which he was involved during the 1890s.<br>
<br>After 1900 Holmes gradually withdrew from many of his outside activities in favour of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, David Shackleton, and by the time he died he was regarded in the rapidly changing labour movement as a relic of an earlier age. He remained personally loyal to the Liberal Party, while insisting that political partisanship and state intervention had no place in the narrow world of industrial relations. Tough, pragmatic, and unimaginative, Holmes took most of the traditions and assumptions of the cotton trade as he found them. Because an exporting industry such as cotton had to remain internationally competitive, he opposed the statutory eight-hour working day and compulsory arbitration. At the same time, he accepted the industry's need for a largely female and juvenile labour force which, although protected from the worst forms of exploitation by the <span class="roman">Factory Acts</span>, was both over-worked and&#151;relative to men&#151;under-paid. Such a limited vision was increasingly criticized at a time when class war, public ownership, and women's rights were becoming prominent on the political agenda; the wave of labour unrest which struck the cotton industry just before the First World War marked the widespread rejection of the cautious and compromising tactics which Holmes and his generation had pursued.<br>
<br>David Holmes was taken ill while attending the Trades Union Congress at Hanley in September 1905, and died of cardiac disease and dropsy at his home, 11 Lawn Street, Burnley, on 14 January 1906. He left a widow and eleven surviving children out of a family of fourteen. His quasi-public funeral at Burnley cemetery made an appropriate end to a career which symbolized the growth of mass trade unionism and its gradual incorporation into the mainstream of British public life during the last thirty years of the nineteenth century.<br>
