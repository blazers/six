<span class="headword">Bowyer,  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1560&#150;1621), <span class="occ">parliamentary official and politician</span>, was the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69724/', "William Bowyer (d. 1569/70)")</script> of Wimbledon, Surrey, bailiff of Westminster and keeper of the records in the Tower, and his wife, Agnes, daughter of Sir John Harcourt of Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, and widow of John Knyvet of Ashwellthorpe, Norfolk. His only brother died young; his sister married Richard Highgate. Bowyer's father came from a well-known Sussex family, and left him a lease of Selsey prebend in his will of 15 April 1569.<br>
<br>Bowyer graduated BA at Oxford in March 1579, and went on to Clifford's Inn, and in 1580 to the Middle Temple. He attached himself to the Sussex magnate Thomas Sackville, then Lord Buckhurst and later lord treasurer and first earl of Dorset, who in 1594 recommended him to act as deputy to John Parker in a chancery post as &#145;of honest sort and behaviour, of such good knowledge and skill for the discharge of such a place, and withall having so good means and ability to live&#146;. He received the appointment, but Parker himself was never sworn into office. Even with Sackville's favour Bowyer failed to secure more than the reversion in 1597 to the clerkship of the parliaments, the successful candidate averring that he was unfit &#145;by reason of a great imperfection he hath in his speech&#146;. Sackville took him into his own service as secretary, and secured his return to the parliament of 1601 for the Sussex borough of Steyning. He left a distinctive mark of his presence, protesting on 12 December that a member had been &#145;pulled back&#146; from voting in a close division, and fainting six days later: &#145;It was said he had a spice of the falling sickness&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1604 Bowyer was appointed with a relative, Henry Elsynge, to his father's post of keeper of the Tower records. On 31 October 1605 he was chosen in a by-election as the member for Evesham, taking the place of a man who had been an exchequer colleague of one of his Bowyer cousins. He was more active as a member of the first Jacobean parliament, often called on in his official capacity to supply precedents, but he is best remembered for his diary of the parliament, which has been described as &#145;indispensable&#146;. On a more personal level he concerned himself with a land bill for William Essex, who had married a Harcourt, acting as a feoffee for his Berkshire estate. He was sworn clerk of the parliaments on 30 January 1610, relinquishing his seat in the House of Commons. He devoted the rest of his life to bringing order to the parliamentary records after what he called the &#145;negligence&#146; of his predecessors. Among his achievements was the recovery of the Lords' journal for 1536.<br>
<br>Bowyer died on 14 or 15 March 1621. He had never married, but his will shows that he regarded Elsynge, his successor in the clerkship, more or less as a son. He was particularly grateful to him for the &#145;extraordinary kindness&#146; he had shown his wife, Bowyer's niece Blanche Highgate, near whom he was buried in St Dunstan-in-the-West.<br>
