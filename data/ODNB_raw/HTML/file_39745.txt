<span class="headword">Chicken,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1698, <em>d.</em> 1745/6), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at White Cross in the parish of St John's in Newcastle upon Tyne, and baptized at St John's on 10 September 1698, the third of seven children of Edward Chicken, weaver, who died in 1707 leaving two surviving sons and a daughter. The mother, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Radcliffe, being of limited means, Edward and his brother Robert were educated at the parish charity school.<br>
<br>Chicken entered his father's trade, taking his freedom in the Company of Weavers in 1718, becoming elector of the company in 1720 and clerk in 1721. Also about this time he was elected parish clerk of St John's, an office he held until his death. He opened a school, and through these various sources of income became a substantial figure locally, and &#145;being a man of strong individuality of character, he became a sort of oracle and arbiter among his fellow-townsmen&#146;  (Welford , 1.547).<br>
<br>Chicken married Ann Jordan of Newcastle (<i>d</i>. 1768) on 6 February 1719. They had four children: Edward (<i>b</i>. 1721), who served as chaplain of the <i>Monmouth</i> (he was present at the notable single-ship action with the <i>Foudroyant</i> in 1758), later curate of Bridlington and Hornsea; Catherine (1723&#150;1759); George (1726, died in infancy); and Eleanor (1728&#150;1810); neither daughter married.<br>
<br>Two poems survive. The first was occasioned by the local election of 1741, hotly contested between Sir Walter Blackett and Matthew Ridley. Attributed to Chicken is a verse attack on Ridley entitled <span class="italic">No&#151;this is the Truth</span> as a riposte to an anti-Blackett polemic, <span class="italic">Is this the Truth?</span> He is far better known for <span class="italic">The Collier's Wedding</span>, a candid and uncensorious narrative of the riotous courtship, marriage, and revels of a collier lad and his Jenny, adorned with description of local custom of such detail as to be regarded by local historians as a valuable source: &#145;Chicken's poem is a classic in accuracy and record&#146;  (Colls, 58). The poem has real quality in its vigorous and sharply focused narrative, unvarnished yet affectionate, and clearly based on direct experience. No date has been proved for this poem. Cail claims to have seen a manuscript dated 1729; this has not been traced. Chicken was buried in St John's churchyard on 2 January 1746.<br>
