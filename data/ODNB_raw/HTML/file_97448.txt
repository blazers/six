<span class="headword">Barkworth,  Peter Wynn</span>  (1929&#150;2006), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born at 26 Madeira Road, Margate, Kent, on 14 January 1929, the son of Walter Wynn Barkworth, a sales manager in the motor trade, of 56A High Street, Margate, and his wife, Irene May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brown. When his father took up a post in Manchester the family moved to Bramhall, near Stockport, Cheshire, and Barkworth was educated at Stockport School. Gaining a love of performing, he perfected an impersonation of Winston Churchill reciting &#145;Mary had a little lamb&#146; as a party piece for friends, accompanied by his mother on the piano and father on the Swanee whistle. He also acted at school, once starring as Macbeth, and appeared at the Hippodrome Theatre, Stockport, in <span class="italic">For What We Are</span> (1942), aged thirteen.<br>
<br>On leaving school Barkworth won a scholarship to train as an actor at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) (1946&#150;8) and made his professional d&eacute;but as Jack Read in <span class="italic">The Guinea Pig</span> (1948) with Folkestone Repertory Theatre, where he performed with the Arthur Brough Players (1948&#150;9). After national service (1949&#150;50) he joined the Sheffield Repertory Company (1950&#150;51), then made his first appearance in London's West End, as Gaston Probert in <span class="italic">Letter from Paris</span> (Aldwych Theatre, 1952). He followed it with the roles of Gerald Arbuthnot in <span class="italic">A Woman of No Importance</span> (Savoy Theatre, 1953), Stefan in <span class="italic">The Dark is Light Enough</span> (Aldwych Theatre, 1954), Bernard Taggart-Stuart in <span class="italic">Roar Like a Dove</span> (Phoenix Theatre, 1957), Sir Benjamin Backbite in a revival of <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> (Haymarket Theatre, 1962), which he also played on Broadway (Majestic Theatre, 1963), and Edward VIII in Royce Ryton's play about the abdication crisis, <span class="italic">Crown Matrimonial</span> (Haymarket Theatre, 1972), a role he repeated in 1974 in a television adaptation, winning him a BAFTA best television actor award. Then came the roles of a government minister attending an old boys' reunion in <span class="italic">Donkeys' Years</span> (Globe Theatre, 1976) and a corporate architect in <span class="italic">Can You Hear Me at the Back?</span> (Piccadilly Theatre, 1979).<br>
<br>Barkworth made his television d&eacute;but in 1948, when he appeared in a live, twenty-minute BBC play while still studying at RADA. His first feature film was <span class="italic">You Know What Sailors Are!</span> (1953), starring Donald Sinden, in which he acted a naval lieutenant. He took a similar role in <span class="italic">A Touch of Larceny</span> (1959), alongside James Mason, and was in the political drama <span class="italic">No Love for Johnnie</span> (1961). Although he later appeared in the films <span class="italic">Where Eagles Dare</span> (1968), <span class="italic">Mr Smith</span> (1976), and <span class="italic">Escape from the Dark</span> (1976), and in <span class="italic">Champions</span> (1984), as the racehorse owner Nick Embiricos in a film about Bob Champion, the jockey who conquered cancer to win the Grand National, television became the medium in which Barkworth had most success, usually playing professional types.<br>
<br>After character parts in plays and episodes of popular series like <span class="italic">No Hiding Place</span> (1963) and <span class="italic">The Avengers</span> (1963), Barkworth became a household name in <span class="italic">The Power Game</span> (1965&#150;6, 1969), playing Kenneth Bligh, the son of the founder of a civil engineering company that was taken over by John Wilder (Patrick Wymark), whose success as an aerospace tycoon had been featured in a previous series, <span class="italic">The Plane Makers</span>. The executive that Barkworth acted was typical of the middle-class, besuited roles for which he would become best known on television. After playing the British agent Vincent in the thriller series <span class="italic">Manhunt</span> (1970), set in occupied France during the Second World War, and Tsar Nicholas II in Ronald Eyre's play <span class="italic">Rasputin</span> (1971), he took a rare comedy role as the grumpy television executive Eustace Morrow in the sitcom <span class="italic">The Good Girl</span> (1974), played Guy Foster in the three-part Francis Durbridge thriller <span class="italic">Melissa</span> (1974), and won both BAFTA and Royal Television Society awards for best actor for his performance as the philosophy professor Anderson in Tom Stoppard's play <span class="italic">Professional Foul</span> (1977).<br>
<br>Barkworth again won BAFTA's award for best television actor for his role as the stockbroker turned country restaurateur Richard Elkinson in <span class="italic">The Country Party</span> (1977). But his biggest screen success was as the international banker Mark Telford seeking a less stressful life by becoming a provincial bank manager in <span class="italic">Telford's Change</span> (1979). The BBC series was Barkworth's own idea, and had originally been rejected by ITV eleven years earlier. On television he also acted Stanley Baldwin in <span class="italic">Winston Churchill: the Wilderness Years</span> (1981) and Geoffrey Carr, a computer magnate raising the ransom for his kidnapped wife and stepchild, in the thriller series <span class="italic">The Price</span> (1985), which again was his own idea. His final screen role was as the prosecutor Charles Gill in <span class="italic">Wilde</span> (1997), a film about Oscar Wilde starring Stephen Fry. His last West End stage roles were in <span class="italic">Hidden Laughter</span> (Vaudeville Theatre, 1990) and <span class="italic">The Winslow Boy</span> (Globe Theatre, 1994).<br>
<br>Barkworth taught at RADA from 1955 to 1963, when his students included Anthony Hopkins, Diana Rigg, and Simon Ward, and served as a RADA council member from 1985 to 2001. He wrote the books <span class="italic">About Acting</span> (1980), <span class="italic">More About Acting</span> (1984), and <span class="italic">The Complete About Acting</span> (1991), based on insights gathered while he was teaching at RADA. He was also the author of <span class="italic">First Houses</span> (1983), a memoir of his early years as an actor, and <span class="italic">For All Occasions</span> (1997), collected poetry and prose for public speakers. For more than forty years he lived in an eighteenth-century house in Flask Walk, Hampstead, and he also had a seaside flat in Folkestone, Kent. He died of bronchopneumonia at the Royal Free Hospital, London, on 21 October 2006, ten days after suffering a stroke. He never married.<br>
