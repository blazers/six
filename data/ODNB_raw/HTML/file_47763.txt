<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Mujibur Rahman, Sheikh</span>  (1920&#150;1975), <span class="occ">president of Bangladesh</span>, was born in Tungipara, Faridpur district, Bengal, on 17 March 1920, the first of six children of Sheikh Lutfur Rahman, a middle-class landowner, and Sahera Begum. He had one brother and four sisters. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (usually referred to as Sheikh Mujib or simply Mujib) married a cousin, Begam Fazilat-un-Nisa. They had three sons and two daughters. Their eldest child, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, who was born on 28 September 1947, became the leader of the Awami League, with which her father was associated throughout most of his active political career.<br>
<br>Mujib studied politics and law at the universities of Calcutta and Dacca but did not receive a degree from either. He was heavily involved with student politics and active in the Muslim League in its campaign to gain the partition of India to create a separate homeland for the Muslims. In 1949 he was associated with Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, a former premier of Bengal and future prime minister of Pakistan, in the founding of the Awami (People's) Muslim League. This party soon changed its name to the Awami League as it decided to admit non-Muslims, who had been barred from membership in the Muslim League. When the Awami League allied with the Krishak Sramik (Farmers' and Workers') Party to defeat the Muslim League in the 1954 East Bengal provincial election, Mujib became minister of commerce, a posting that is generally judged to have been unsuccessful. His principal role, however, had been and would continue to be as a party organizer. When Suhrawardy died in 1963 Mujib became <i>de facto</i> leader of the East Pakistan Awami League.<br>
<br>General Muhammad Ayub Khan had taken control of Pakistan in 1958 and banned political parties. When parties were again legalized in 1962, Mujib and his party demanded greater autonomy for East Pakistan. In January 1966 he startled a meeting of opposition leaders in Lahore, West Pakistan, by putting forward his demands in the shape of the Six Points. These suggested a parliamentary system of government to replace the presidential system of Ayub, and a number of economic measures that would have given East Pakistan almost complete control over its assets and foreign exchange earnings. Mujib was arrested a number of times, most notably in 1968 when he and others were accused of conspiring with India to gain independence for East Pakistan. The trial was never completed and Mujib was freed to join negotiations between Ayub and the opposition. These failed, and the failure culminated in the resignation of Ayub in March 1969.<br>
<br>Ayub's successor, General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan, called for elections in December 1970. In East Pakistan Mujib and his Awami League won 160 of the 162 seats, thereby securing a majority of the 300 seats in the national assembly although winning no seats in West Pakistan. The party campaigned on the Six Points, but as negotiations among Mujib, Yahya, and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whose People's Party of Pakistan had won a majority of the seats in West Pakistan, failed to establish a common ground on which the national assembly could begin its deliberations on a new constitution, the stance of many of Mujib's party members, and perhaps of Mujib himself, became one of demanding independence rather than autonomy under the umbrella of a united Pakistan. Mujib delivered an important speech on 7 March 1971 during which he came just short of declaring independence, but then and in the next few days declared that Bangladeshis, as they were coming to be known, should no longer pay taxes or obey Pakistani laws. His almost Gandhian approach however failed, and violence broke out. On 25 March the Pakistan army, hastily reinforced from West Pakistan, cracked down on Bangladeshis, including a particularly forceful attack on Dacca University. Mujib was arrested and transported to prison in West Pakistan. Civil war had begun and would not end until 16 December 1971, when the Pakistan army in Bangladesh surrendered to the combined forces of the Indian army, which had entered the war in early December, and the Mukti Bahini, the liberation army of Bangladesh.<br>
<br>Mujib was to have been tried for treason but the trial was not completed and he was not sentenced. When Bhutto took over the presidency of Pakistan from Yahya Khan in December he declared that he would release Mujib unconditionally, but expressed his hope that the two wings of Pakistan could be reunited. Mujib was released on 7 January 1972 and returned to Dacca (renamed Dhaka) on 10 January after stopping in London and New Delhi. The welcome to the man who would become known as Bangabandhu (Friend of Bengal) was tumultuous. Mujib had been named president of Bangladesh by the government in exile, but chose instead to be prime minister of his proposed parliamentary system of government. A constitution was adopted in 1972 creating a parliamentary form and enshrining the four principles of Mujibbad (Mujibism): secularism, socialism, democracy, and nationalism.<br>
<br>It turned out, however, that leading a country to independence was less difficult than governing a newly independent state, especially one that had been devastated by the civil war. Mujib relied heavily on socialism, only to see both agricultural and industrial production fail to reach pre-independence levels. Corruption was widespread, notably in the distribution of relief supplies that came from many nations. Despite an overwhelming victory for the Awami League in an election in 1973, in which fraud was widely suspected, opposition to Mujib began to grow rapidly. Near famine conditions in 1974 added to the discontent. He also instituted a special military force, the Rakhi Bahini (defence force), which angered many in the regular army.<br>
<br>On 25 January 1975 Mujib pushed through an amendment to the constitution which created a presidential system with himself as president with nearly full powers. He followed this on 6 June 1975 with the establishment of a single-party state. The new party combined the names of the two major parties that had contested as part of the United Front in 1954: Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League. Neither of these steps quelled the growing opposition in the country at large and in the military.<br>
<br>On 15 August 1975 Mujib was assassinated along with his wife, their three sons, and several other members of his family by disgruntled army officers. The assassination of Mujib and his immediate family took place at his residence on Road 32 in the Dhanmondi residential area of Dhaka; he had not moved into the presidential palace. Two daughters who were out of the country survived: Hasina, later, as noted above, the leader of the Awami League and who became prime minister in 1996, and Rehana, who resided in Brunei. Mujib's residence was converted into a museum, but in the destruction accompanying the assassinations most of the papers and other property of Mujib was destroyed. He was buried in Tungipara.<br>
<br>The memory of Mujib as the liberator of Bangladesh is honoured; his alteration of a democratic system to an authoritarian one is not. This is perhaps best exemplified by the campaign run by the Awami League in the 1991 election, when it campaigned for a return to a parliamentary system as embodied in the unamended 1972 constitution, and avoided reference to the authoritarian actions taken in 1975. The Awami League won the parliamentary election in 1996.<br>
