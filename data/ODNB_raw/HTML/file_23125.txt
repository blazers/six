<span class="headword">Randolph,  William</span>  (1650&#150;1711), <span class="occ">colonist in America</span>, was born on 7 November 1650 at Morton Morell, Warwickshire, the second son of Richard Randolph (1620&#150;1671) and his wife, Elizabeth Ryland (1625&#150;1699). During the interregnum the family moved to Dublin, where Richard Randolph later died. William was educated at home, becoming proficient in Greek and Latin, and studied law privately, although he never practised as a lawyer and was never called to the bar. His father was the half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23123/', "Thomas Randolph")</script>, the noted poet, and the brother of Henry Randolph (1623&#150;1673), who emigrated to Virginia in 1642, marrying Judith Somes, daughter of the speaker of the house of burgesses. It was a visit from this successful relative that caused William himself to leave Britain, arriving in Virginia between 1669 and 1673.<br>
<br>Randolph may have spent the earliest part of his residency in Jamestown engaged in building houses and barns, but by 1674 he was sufficiently wealthy to bring over twelve indentured servants and purchase 500 acres on Swift Creek, Virginia. He took a great interest in horse-racing, and was a favourite of Governor William and Lady Berkeley, although his high spirits once caused him to be charged with public profanity. During the traumatic period of Bacon's rebellion in 1676 Randolph remained neutral, although his property was scavenged by Bacon's men, causing considerable damage, and he was close friends with William Byrd and Captain Henry Isham of Bermuda Hundred, both Baconites. Randolph, however, profited handsomely from Bacon's defeat by purchasing plantations forfeited by the rebels, Turkey Island in 1684, and two others in 1698.<br>
<br>Perhaps as early as 1675 Randolph married Mary (1652&#150;1735), heir of Captain Henry Isham and Katherine Banks, with whom he had nine surviving children, the first born in 1681. From his family seat at Turkey Island, he was now close to the new colonial capital at Williamsburg, which had replaced Jamestown, and became a local political figure, serving as county sheriff, coroner, justice of the peace, member of the house of burgesses, lieutenant-colonel of the militia, and escheator-general, a position which aided his accumulation of more than 10,000 acres of tobacco land. Randolph also inherited his uncle's position as court clerk of Henrico county, and served as speaker of the house of burgesses.<br>
<br>Randolph's estates soon made him a very wealthy man, with a large population of slaves who worked on his tobacco plantations, and his own ship, which took the produce of his lands to England to be sold through Micajah Perry, his agent in Britain. As was common among colonial planters, Randolph consistently owed enormous debts to Perry for the luxury goods with which he furnished his mansion and fitted out his family. Always keenly interested in education, especially for Native Americans, he was a major proponent of a university for Virginia, and was a generous donor when the College of William and Mary was finally established in 1693, serving as one of its trustees.<br>
<br>A particular friend of the Byrd family, Randolph kept watch at William Byrd's deathbed and acted as adviser to Byrd's sons when they served on the colonial council and ran the family estates. Randolph himself, however, was increasingly plagued by melancholia and gout, finally dying at his home on Turkey Island on 21 April 1711; he was buried in Turkey Island cemetery. He had established the Randolph family as an American dynasty that would be integral to the history of Virginia. One of his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68733/', "John Randolph")</script>, the colonial lawyer and legislator, was knighted during a visit to England in 1730. His wife died on 29 December 1735.<br>
