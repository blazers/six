</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Hagan,  Thomas</span>, first Baron O'Hagan  (1812&#150;1885), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Belfast on 29 May 1812, the only son of Edward O'Hagan, a Catholic trader, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Captain Thomas Bell. His early education was at the Belfast Academical Institution, where he was at the time the only Catholic pupil. A keen interest in public speaking led to his early prominence in the school's debating society. In 1831 he was admitted as a student of the King's Inns, Dublin, and three years later he became a student of Gray's Inn in London, as a pupil of Thomas Chitty. O'Hagan was called to the Irish bar in 1836, the year of his marriage (on 1 February) to Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27100/', "Charles Hamilton Teeling")</script> of Belfast [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27099/', "Teeling, Bartholomew")</script>]. They were to have one son (who died in infancy) and five daughters.<h2>
<a name="Earlylegalcareer"></a>Early legal career</h2>O'Hagan's early career at the bar was spent on the north-east circuit, principally as a criminal defence counsel. He combined legal practice with journalism, editing the <span class="italic">Newry Examiner</span>, a paper which supported Daniel O'Connell, from 1836 until 1840, when O'Hagan moved to Dublin. His association with O'Connell assisted his rise to prominence at the bar. O'Hagan's successful defence of Charles Gavan Duffy (then editor of the <span class="italic">Belfast Vindicator</span>) in a seditious libel case in 1842 enhanced his reputation as one of the leading barristers of his generation. Promotion in the profession followed. In 1847 O'Hagan became assistant barrister (or county court judge) for co. Longford, and two years later he became a QC. He became assistant barrister for co. Dublin in 1857. O'Hagan was appointed as third serjeant and elected a bencher of King's Inns in 1859.<br>
<br>O'Hagan's identification with his co-religionists is evident from a number of controversial cases where he appeared as counsel. In 1845 he was junior counsel in an appeal to the visitorial court of appeal of Trinity College, Dublin. The case concerned Denis Caulfied Heron, a Catholic student, who appealed against a decision of the provost and fellows of Trinity College which had refused him admission to a scholarship on the grounds that the scholarships were not tenable by Catholics. At the trial on 7 December 1855 of Father Petcherine, a redemptorist monk of Russian birth, on a charge of profanity for burning a copy of the Authorized Version of the scriptures, O'Hagan's address to the jury secured an acquittal. Outside the courts, O'Hagan helped to organize opposition to the <span class="roman">Ecclesiastical Titles Bill</span> and to proposed legislation on convents in 1852.<h2>
<a name="Politicalandreligiousbeliefs"></a>Political and religious beliefs</h2>In politics O'Hagan was strongly influenced by O'Connell, whom he described in 1875 in a centenary address as &#145;my great political benefactor, my deliverer and my friend&#146;. However, O'Hagan did not support the repeal of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>. Instead he was prepared to work within the Union to bring about fair and just laws which he believed would give Catholics greater rights and might lead ultimately to acceptance of English law. As a founder member of the Dublin Statistical Society in 1847, which became the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland in 1855, O'Hagan pioneered the study of statistical and economic science in Ireland. His later belief&#151;that Ireland's social and economic problems could be remedied through legislation&#151;was in keeping with the philosophy of the statistical movement. He collaborated with the leading Irish economist and statistician William Neilson Hancock in making law reform a major objective of the statistical movement in Ireland.<br>
<br>In 1858 O'Hagan was appointed a member of the board of national education for Ireland, for which he was criticized by Cardinal Cullen. Palmerston made him solicitor-general for Ireland in 1861, and a year later he became attorney-general for Ireland, which also brought him into conflict with the traditional and ultra-conservative side of Catholic nationalist opinion. He rejected the view that &#145;a Catholic Irishman, faithful to his Church and true to his country, is to ostracise himself and decline a position of dignity and power which he may have won by honest effort and fair capacity&#146;  (O'Hagan, 324&#150;5). For a short period, from May 1863 to January 1865, he sat as a Liberal MP for Tralee. O'Hagan had little private means and his search for a safe seat at first proved difficult. He had been unsuccessful at Kinsale, largely because he could not provide the necessary financial patronage to secure local support, but at Tralee Daniel O'Connell's son retired to make way for him. His career as an elected politician was short-lived. In January 1865 he was appointed to the bench as a judge of the court of common pleas in succession to Nicholas Ball. According to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, O'Hagan commanded widespread support as a fair-minded judge.<h2>
<a name="Irishlordchancellor"></a>Irish lord chancellor</h2>On the formation of Gladstone's first ministry in December 1868, O'Hagan became lord chancellor of Ireland, the first Catholic to hold the office since 1688. He was the first person to benefit from an act of parliament passed in 1867 (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. 75), by which the office of lord chancellor had been opened to all persons without regard to their religious beliefs. On 14 June 1870 O'Hagan was raised to the peerage as Baron O'Hagan of Tullahogue in co. Tyrone and took his seat in the Lords on 21 June 1870. Following the death of his first wife in October 1868, O'Hagan married on 2 August 1871 Alice Mary (<i>d</i>. 1921), daughter and coheir of Colonel Charles Towneley (<i>d</i>. 1870) of Towneley, Lancashire, a Catholic landowner and Liberal MP for Sligo in 1848 and 1852&#150;3, through whom he acquired 5200 acres in Lancashire and Yorkshire.<br>
<br>O'Hagan was aware of the semi-political nature of the office of lord chancellor and aware, too, that his position as Irish lord chancellor was a political gesture to secure Irish Catholic support for Gladstone's ministry. O'Hagan was known to have support from the Catholic bishops. F. E. Ball, in the second volume of his <span class="italic">Judges in Ireland, 1221&#150;1921</span> (1926), noted that the appointment was &#145;prompted by O'Hagan's representing more than any other Roman Catholic on the Bench national ideals&#146;. Throughout Gladstone's first ministry O'Hagan played a prominent role, though he had occasion to complain that he was not initially consulted by Gladstone or the then Irish chief secretary, Chichester Fortescue (Lord Carlingford), over the contents of the 1870 <span class="roman">Land Bill</span>. The reform of the Irish jury system was identified as one of the major areas for legislation. Jury packing and an unfair jury-selection process were identified as shortcomings in the existing jury legislation. In 1871 O'Hagan introduced a <span class="roman">Jury Bill</span>, subsequently enacted as the <span class="roman">Juries Act (Ireland)</span> 1871, which lowered the property qualification for jurors (replacing the freehold qualification) and endeavoured to prevent jury packing by replacing the sheriff's discretion over jury selection with a system of alphabetical selection by rotation. This 1871 act was the first attempt to broaden the jury qualification to allow Catholics to sit on the jury in both civil and criminal cases. O'Hagan also introduced reforms in the law of lunacy and in the system of juvenile justice during the period of Gladstone's first ministry.<br>
<br>In 1869 O'Hagan had become president of the Dublin Statistical Society. Many of the papers read at the society's meetings, which were strongly influenced by the utilitarian ideas of Bentham and his followers, identified areas of the law that required reform. O'Hagan believed in codification as an overriding philosophy for law reformers. In the case of Ireland he believed that codification would allow easier comparison and perhaps assimilation of the law in England and Ireland. He also had the vision to imagine both England and Ireland linked to a codified system of law throughout Europe. This European perspective is a recurrent theme of O'Hagan's opening address at the Belfast meeting of the Social Science Association in 1867, entitled &#145;The study of jurisprudence&#151;Roman, English and Celtic&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Judicialoffice"></a>Judicial office</h2>O'Hagan's decisions in the Irish court of chancery are reported in the <span class="italic">Irish Reports (Equity)</span>, volumes 4&#150;8. O'Hagan's work as a common-law advocate was not regarded by his fellow judges as the best qualification for work as a chancery judge, and his lasting legacy is not to be found in his contribution to judicial precedent. In his first period of office as lord chancellor he was embroiled in an embarrassing series of public and acrimonious controversies with his colleague in the chancery appeal court, Lord Justice Christian. Christian disliked the <span class="roman">Land Act</span> of 1870, which O'Hagan had supported. In a leading case on interpretation of tenant rights under the new act, <i>Re the Marquis of Waterford's Estates</i> (1871), Christian made strong objection to O'Hagan's judgment about the nature of the legal rights of tenants and attacked the act as &#145;shocking to all our ideas of property law&#146;. In the case of <i>Mulholland v. Killen</i> (1874), Christian was highly critical of O'Hagan's 1871 <span class="roman">Juries Act</span> and of the class of new jurors enfranchised by the legislation. Christian was also critical of O'Hagan for allegedly not spending sufficient time on his judicial functions.<br>
<br>O'Hagan responded to Christian's attacks with characteristic dignity, his reputation for tact and good humour and his fair-minded and honest intention remaining intact. This underlines what appears from reading his letters and speeches: O'Hagan's genial nature and general optimistic view of the world. Perhaps na&iuml;vely, this optimism may have left O'Hagan unwilling or unable to come to terms with his disappointments; his jury reforms in the 1870s required constant amendment, his passion for law reform through codification of Irish law remained unfulfilled, and the land legislation of 1870 required fundamental change in the 1880s.<h2>
<a name="Laterpublicactivities"></a>Later public activities</h2>In February 1874 O'Hagan resigned with the rest of Gladstone's ministry. During the following six years out of office, O'Hagan continued to take an active interest in public life. He supported reform of the Irish education system. He was one of the original members of the intermediate education board established in 1878 and later became its first vice-chairman. On the foundation of the Royal University of Ireland in 1880, O'Hagan was one of the university senators. In 1878 he delivered the Thomas Moore centenary address in Dublin, and in 1880 he made an address to Cardinal Newman at Edgbaston, Birmingham, on behalf of a deputation from the Catholics of Ireland. In 1881 he delivered the presidential address at the opening of the Social Science Congress in Dublin.<br>
<br>In May 1880, on the return of Gladstone to office, O'Hagan again became lord chancellor of Ireland and strongly supported another land bill in the House of Lords. Ill health forced him to resign in November 1881. O'Hagan was elected an honorary bencher of Gray's Inn in 1883 and he continued to attend the judicial sittings of the House of Lords after his retirement from the lord chancellorship. O'Hagan suffered a stroke on Christmas day 1884 and died on 1 February 1885 at his London home, Hereford House, Park Street. He was buried at Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin, on 6 February. He and his second wife, who survived him, had two sons and two daughters; his elder son, a protestant, who succeeded him as second baron, was killed on active service in the South African War.<br>
<br>O'Hagan's speeches and papers were published in <span class="italic">Occasional Papers and Addresses</span> (1884) and in <span class="italic">Selected Speeches and Arguments of Lord O'Hagan</span> (1885), edited by George Teeling. The published collections contain all of O'Hagan's major speeches, including the O'Connell centenary address published (though not delivered) by O'Hagan in Dublin in 1875. The statue of O'Hagan by Thomas Farrell, erected in 1887 in the Four Courts in Dublin, was destroyed along with the rest of the building in 1922.<br>
