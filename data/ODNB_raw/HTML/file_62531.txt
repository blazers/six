<span class="headword">Berkeley,  Norborne</span>, fourth Baron de Botetourt  (1717&#150;1770), <span class="occ">politician and colonial governor</span>, was born on 21 December 1717 in London, probably at the family's residence in Clifford Street. He was the only son of John Symes Berkeley (1663&#150;1736), head of a branch, based at Stoke Gifford in south Gloucestershire, of the Berkeleys at Berkeley Castle. His mother was Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Norborne (1678&#150;1742), of Calne, Wiltshire, who was the widow of Edward Devereux, eighth Viscount Hereford. After attending Westminster School in 1726 and a period of private tuition, Berkeley went on a grand tour, including stays at Angers, Rome, Florence, Turin, Venice, and Vienna. In Angers he lodged with Madame de la Haye and studied French under the Abb&eacute; Aubert; in Turin he attended the academy of Carlo Emanuele, which may have given him a taste for the life of a courtier. During the tour his father died and Berkeley inherited the Stoke Gifford estate, lands in Wiltshire and Norfolk, and mining rights in the Kingswood coalfield east of Bristol.<br>
<br>Having donated &pound;500 at a meeting called by Bristol's Stedfast Society to thwart the Spanish interception of the port's ships, Berkeley was elected to the society, a tory association, in 1739. In his preparation for election to parliament, he sought the backing of his kinsman, the third earl of Berkeley, who withdrew his promised support under pressure from the prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole. In May 1740 Berkeley's younger sister Elizabeth married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74104/', "Charles Noel Somerset")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26010/', "Henry Somerset, second duke of Beaufort")</script>], MP for Monmouth, and brother of the third duke of Beaufort. In 1741 Berkeley stood as a county tory with the support of the Beauforts (who were sympathetic to the Jacobite cause), and was elected a member for Gloucestershire. Kept out of public office by the Hanoverians' proscription of the tories, he undertook constituency duties and local charitable works, being involved with Gloucester infirmary and, as a trustee, with the charity school at Fishponds of which Hannah More's father was the master. He also undertook the improvement of his house and grounds at Stoke Gifford, in which he was assisted from about 1749 by the gentleman&#150;designer Thomas Wright, with whom he toured stately homes in England in 1750. Berkeley enveloped the Jacobean house with a crenellated gothic fa&ccedil;ade and introduced neo-classical features within. His innovative landscaping of the grounds&#151;with serpentine paths in woodland&#151;anticipated the more picturesque style of William Kent and William Shenstone; he also erected a number of neo-classical structures: a rotunda, a sarcophagus&#151;commemorating his brother-in-law, from 1745 the fourth duke of Beaufort&#151;an obelisk, and a replica of the so-called tomb of the Horatii and Curiatii at Albano, which Berkeley may have seen on his grand tour. In addition to his architectural pursuits, he subscribed to the King's Theatre, London; was steward and a patron of the Gloucester music meeting, a forerunner of the Three Choirs festival; and was patron of the organist and composer William Felton. An interest in the classics led to his early membership of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92790', "Society of Dilettanti")</script>, and of the committee which in 1764 sent Richard Chandler and Nicholas Revett to record antiquities in Asia Minor. Berkeley did not marry, but fathered at least four children: two, by a Mrs Thompson of Edinburgh, whom he openly acknowledged. Berkeley paid for naval training and a commission for his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27257/', "Charles Thompson")</script>, who sent specimens of exotic birds and plants to his father and mother. Having nearly killed a man in a brawl in Boston in 1764, Thompson fled to avoid a possible charge of murder, and sheltered in Berkeley's London house until the victim recovered and it was deemed safe to return to his ship.<br>
<br>Berkeley was active in the militia, of which he became a colonel in 1758. That year, to some disapproval because he was the guardian of his infant nephew, Henry, the future fifth duke, he joined the expedition to attack St Malo and Cherbourg. Politically Berkeley was a Hanoverian tory, not a Jacobite like his father and his in-laws: after the 'Forty-Five he signed the association pledging allegiance to George II. He appears not to have been harmed by receiving an honorary degree at the opening of the Radcliffe (Camera) Library at Oxford in 1749, when the ceremony was exploited by William King to mount a Jacobite demonstration. In the Commons Berkeley generally supported the government. He showed independence and principle, however, over issues such as Jewish naturalization in 1753, the cider excise in 1763, the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>, and the Townshend duties imposed on the American colonies, tending to vote with the government both for the enactment of the latter and their repeal.<br>
<br>In 1760, on the accession of George III, Berkeley acquired a place at court as a groom of the bedchamber. That year the doll he annually gave to his god-daughter, Lady Elizabeth Berkeley (later margravine of Brandenburg-Ansbach-Bayreuth), wore full court dress. In 1761 Berkeley was appointed to the House of Commons committee of privileges and in the following October he stood second to Lord Talbot who duelled with John Wilkes on Bagshot Heath. A suggestion that he become secretary-at-war was blocked. In 1762, having been appointed lord lieutenant of Gloucester, Gloucestershire, and Bristol, and colonel of the north Gloucestershire militia, Berkeley became constable of St Briavel's castle. From the following year he was warden of the Forest of Dean, which involved responsibilities for timber for ships for the navy. In 1764 Berkeley successfully renewed a claim to the abeyant Botetourt peerage, which his father had investigated to the point of obtaining a certificate of entitlement from the College of Heralds, but had not pursued. He entered the House of Lords as the fourth Baron de Botetourt. In 1766 he moved the fateful resolution in the Lords insisting that the Westminster parliament had the power and the right to legislate for Britain's colonies &#145;in all cases whatsoever&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 31, 11 March 1766).<br>
<br>From 1761 Berkeley had invested heavily in William Champion's zinc manufactory at Warmley, south Gloucestershire. However, his investment of about &pound;15,000 was lost when the enterprise collapsed&#151;this the result of a delay by Pitt the elder in executing a charter for the company's incorporation, and Champion's fraudulent withdrawal of capital. In 1768 Botetourt was saved from financial embarrassment when he was made governor of Virginia&#151;an appointment which displeased the author of the <span class="italic">Letters of Junius</span>  (letter 3, 7 Feb 1769, <span class="italic">The Letters of Junius</span>, ed. J. Cannon, 1978, 40). Botetourt's polite and courtly manner did much to maintain good relationships in the colony, notwithstanding the movement towards independence. In his brief period as governor he established the colony's western boundary and restrained white settlement beyond this demarcation at the expense of Native Americans to whom Britain had treaty obligations. He also regulated trade with Native Americans in the west and allocated land to colonists and investors. His governorship also witnessed agitation against the Townshend duties which, by 1768, had become a proxy for a range of grievances concerning self-government. When the Virginia assembly passed George Washington's resolutions in 1769, Botetourt dissolved the assembly, as his instructions required him to do, but he sympathized with the colonists' grievances, and privately deplored the hard line taken by the Grafton ministry. Impulsive and hot-tempered, Botetourt was also generous to a fault. He died of a fever at Williamsburg on 15 October 1770 and was buried in the chapel of the College of William and Mary. He was survived by his son, Charles, who rose to become admiral of the red and was second-in-command at the battle of Cape St Vincent (1797), for which he was made a baronet. Botetourt was held in high regard by Virginians and his sudden death was deeply mourned. He was commemorated by a marble statue (1772&#150;3) by the English sculptor Richard Hayward, which stood initially at the capitol building and, from 1801, before the Wren Building at the College of William and Mary. In 1958 the statue was moved to an indoor location for its preservation and was replaced by a bronze copy in the college yard in 1993.<br>
