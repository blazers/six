<span class="headword">Bawden, Sir  Frederick Charles</span>  (1908&#150;1972), <span class="occ">virologist and plant pathologist</span>, was born on 18 August 1908 in North Tawton, Devon, the younger son and youngest of the three children of George Bawden, relieving officer and registrar of births and deaths, and his wife, Ellen Balment. In 1911 his parents became master and matron of the Okehampton poor-law institution&#151;the workhouse. Early observation of poverty there probably helped to establish Bawden's sympathetic social outlook, while the large institutional garden, mainly devoted to potatoes, may have led to his subsequent interest in agriculture.<br>
<br>Bawden was educated at Okehampton grammar school and Queen Elizabeth School in Crediton. With help from a Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries scholarship he went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and studied botany, chemistry, and physiology. He obtained a first class in part one of the natural sciences tripos in 1928, and the diploma in agricultural science in 1930. In the latter year, having already worked for two years on cereal rusts, he started work at the Potato Virus Research Station (Cambridge) as assistant to R. N. Salaman. That apprenticeship led logically to his subsequent posts: virus physiologist at Rothamsted Experimental Station, Harpenden, in 1936, head of the department of plant pathology in 1940, its deputy director in 1950, and its director in 1958.<br>
<br>Bawden was known primarily as a virus worker; he isolated one of the first virus preparations for which reasonable claims of purity could be made, and wrote <span class="italic">Plant Viruses and Virus Diseases</span> (1939). However, although he did no research on fungus infections other than his early work on rusts, he had a lifelong interest in them. They occupied as much space as virus infections in his <span class="italic">Plant Diseases</span> (1948). He discussed them in several articles and condemned the tendency to segregate specialists on different infective agents into different departments or institutes. Bawden's approach to viruses was broad-minded. He published papers on their chemical, physical, and serological properties, and on their classification, multiplication, and physiological effects. He knew more chemistry than most plant pathologists, but recognized that much of what passed for knowledge in the 1930s about nucleic acids and proteins was baseless.<br>
<br>After the end of the Second World War many students from the less economically developed countries went to Rothamsted for training in plant pathology. Although Bawden welcomed them enthusiastically, he was critical that many were not given jobs in their speciality when they returned home. During frequent visits to India, the Caribbean, and some African countries he gained experience of tropical agriculture; he demonstrated that tropical crops were not as healthy as farmers and governments thought and that when a diseased state was recognized its cause was often wrongly attributed. He disliked formal visits or demonstrations of elaborate equipment: he preferred to get into the field to see crops and discuss them with farmers. He served, often as chairman, on several committees concerned with tropical agriculture.<br>
<br>Bawden was a pragmatist. He argued that researchers who understood that the primary object of farming was to produce food knew more about needs and possibilities than anyone else. He criticized aspects of British agricultural research policy&#151;especially the customer&#150;contractor principle which was introduced in the 1970s. He was delighted that projects which he supported in spite of criticism, such as freeing the King Edward potato clone from paracrinkle virus, and the synthesis of pyrethrin analogues, were ultimately extremely profitable. During his directorship Rothamsted grew beyond its previous bounds in size and staff. He realized, however, that getting research applied was often harder than doing it, and in this respect he contrasted agriculture unfavourably with medicine.<br>
<br>Bawden took a keen interest in the manner of the presentation of research. He had a sharp eye for ambiguity, prolixity, and illegitimately general statements. In spite of a humorous, cheerful, and friendly manner, he could be blunt. Apart from the routine of ensuring that there was a supply of test plants he made little use of assistance and insisted on doing all virus assays himself. As a rule that meant doing them out of normal working hours. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1949, served on many of its committees, and was treasurer from 1968 to 1972. He was knighted in 1967, had honorary degrees from Hull, Bath, Reading, and Brunel universities, and was a member of several foreign academies.<br>
<br>On 6 September 1934 Bawden married Marjorie Elizabeth, a childhood friend and also a botanist, the daughter of Alfred Alderman Cudmore, agricultural engineer. They had two sons. He died in Luton and Dunstable Hospital on 8 February 1972.<br>
