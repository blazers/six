<span class="headword">Booth,  Henry</span>  (1789&#150;1869), <span class="occ">railway projector and manager</span>, was born at 34 Rodney Street, Liverpool, on 4 April 1789, the son of Thomas Booth (1749&#150;1832), a corn merchant, and his wife, Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Noble (<i>d</i>. 1826), of Lancaster. He was privately educated at the Revd Shepherd's boarding-school, Gateacre, near Liverpool, and then employed in his father's office, before going into business on his own account as a corn merchant, but with no great success. On 27 August 1812 he married Ellen Crompton (1789&#150;1871), eldest daughter of Abraham Crompton of Chorley Hall; they had three daughters and one son. In 1822 a committee of Liverpool merchants was established to promote the construction of a railway between Liverpool and Manchester. Thomas Booth was a member of the committee, and Henry became an early supporter of the scheme, visiting the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1824, and organizing and writing in support of the Liverpool and Manchester line. His energy, his administrative abilities, and his gift for public relations were quickly recognized by the committee; he became a member and was appointed secretary after his father stood down in 1824. It was Henry Booth who wrote the Liverpool and Manchester Railway's lengthy and detailed prospectus, dated 29 October 1829, which was the company's first major public announcement. In early 1825 a bill for the construction of the railway came before parliament. It was thrown out after a costly struggle. In the following year a second bill was introduced, and was carried, and Booth was appointed company secretary and treasurer at &pound;500 a year, and as effective managing director of the railway, took an active part in the construction of the line, which was begun in June 1826 and finished in 1830.<br>
<br>Booth was a consistent supporter of George Stephenson as principal engineer of the line, and an enthusiastic promoter of the use of steam locomotive power on the railway, in opposition to those directors who favoured horse-drawn vehicles or stationary steam engines. When the board of directors announced the holding of a series of competitive trials at Rainhill to test the capabilities of different locomotives, Booth and Robert Stephenson jointly constructed and entered the successful <i>Rocket</i>. Booth certainly had a remarkable mechanical talent; he suggested the multitubular boiler, which gave a very large and effective heating surface, increasing the locomotive's efficiency; he also invented the first screw coupling, sprung buffers, and an artificial lubricant for carriage axles.<br>
<br>In August 1845 the Liverpool and Manchester was absorbed into the Grand Junction Railway, for which Booth served as secretary for a year, until it in turn became part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1846. Booth was appointed secretary for the northern section of the LNWR, and in October 1848 he became a director. He retired from office on 18 May 1859, after being presented with 5000 guineas by the company as a token of gratitude for valuable and faithful service. He spent the remainder of his life in his native town, where for some years he acted as a borough magistrate.<br>
<br>In religion Booth was a Unitarian, and in politics a moderate Liberal. Contemporary accounts of him give the impression of a grave, reserved, reticent man, utterly dependable and trustworthy, rigorously honest, and a thorough and indefatigable worker. He was a tireless writer and pamphleteer for much of his life, publishing books, papers, and articles on technical and scientific subjects, social questions, taxation, politics, and the economy. His <span class="italic">Account of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway</span> (1830) remains an indispensable starting point for serious study of the early history of that line. His works on politics, notably <span class="italic">A Reformed Parliament</span> (1833), reflect his moderate Liberalism, and his studies of economic questions, most importantly <span class="italic">Free Trade as it Affects the People</span> (1833), express his firm but pragmatic belief in <i>laissez-faire</i> principles. As a prominent railway manager later in life he was not a dogmatic opponent of government regulation of the railways&#151;in which his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2884/', "James Booth (1796/7&#150;1880)")</script> was involved&#151;but defended them against what he saw as unfair financial burdens, particularly in the case of the compensation payments they were required to make to the victims of railway accidents under <span class="roman">Lord Campbell's Act</span> of 1846; <span class="italic">A Letter to Lord Campbell on the 9th and 10th Vict., Cap. 93</span> (1854) is an important summary of the railway companies' position on this issue. He died at his residence, Eastbourne, Lodge Lane, Princes Park, Liverpool, on 28 March 1869, and was buried on 1 April at Toxteth Chapel.<br>
