<span class="headword">Owen,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1488&#150;1574), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the son of Rhys ab Owen (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1544), a freeholder, of Henllys, Nevern, near Newport, Pembrokeshire, and Jane, daughter of Phillip Elliot of Earwere, near Amroth, and his wife, Janet, daughter of Sir Thomas Perrot of Eastington; his mother had previously been married to Philip ap Gwilym of Stone Hall in the Pembrokeshire parish of St Lawrence. On 28 November 1514 he was admitted at the Middle Temple where he had such travail in copying Sir Anthony Fitzherbert's abridgement of the laws, <span class="italic">La graunde abridgement</span>, that when he produced his own abridgement of statutes he did this &#145;in soe small a volume as the price thereof was but 12d.&#146;  (Owen, <span class="italic">Description</span>, ed. Owen, 238) under the title <span class="italic">Le breggement de touz les estatutz &hellip; par Guillame Owein de Medill' Temple</span>. This was printed by Richard Pynson in London in 1521, and a second edition followed in 1528. His son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20999/', "George Owen")</script>, claimed that he &#145;also wrote other works&#146;; one of these was an unsigned edition of the <span class="italic">Natura brevium</span>.<br>
<br>William Owen was settled at Pembroke by 1521 and, in 1527, he was mayor of that town. In 1521 he married Margaret Swyllyngton of St Clement Danes. He was afterwards clerk of the court of Pembroke, and was controller of the ports of Pembroke, Haverfordwest, and Tenby. He shared in the duties of steward and receiver of the county of Pembroke with Sir Rhys ap Gruffydd until the latter was executed for treason. He was a member of the commission for the division of Wales into shire ground under the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span>, 1536, and held the office of escheator for the county of Pembroke from 1545 to 1560. In 1535 he acquired the estate of Maesgwenith in the county of Monmouth, conveniently situated between Pembrokeshire and London and Bristol, for the pursuit of his legal activities. Owen still had chambers in the Middle Temple in 1521, and was described as of the Temple in 1540 and in 1552, when Middle Temple sued him for dues.<br>
<br>Owen had no children with his first wife. However, he had already had nine natural children, five by his mistress, Jane Lee, and four by other mistresses, by the time he was married again, to Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1520&#150;1603) in 1551. She was the daughter of Sir George Herbert of Swansea and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Berkeley, and niece of the earl of Pembroke; they had a son, George, and a daughter, Katherine.<br>
<br>While he was in London Owen met John Touchet, Lord Audley, who had been restored to the barony of Cemais, in north Pembrokeshire, that had become forfeit to the crown on the attainder and execution of his father; and Audley appointed him clerk of the courts of Cemais. Being impoverished following the sequestration of his father's property, Audley obtained a loan of &pound;600 from Owen in November 1523 for which he made him &#145;a bargain and sale of the barony &hellip; with a condition of redemption upon payment of &pound;300&#146;  (Owen, <span class="italic">Description</span>, ed. Owen, viii, n. 1). Twenty years later, he conveyed the barony to Owen and commanded his tenantry to &#145;obbey the said William Owen as theire very lord and right owner of the barony.&#146; On 4 October 1571 Owen settled the barony, with the castle of Newport and the advowson of six churches on his son, George.<br>
<br>Although George Owen claimed that his father &#145;was accounted to have lyved 105 yeares&#146;, he could not have been more than eighty-six years when he died at his home, Henllys on 29 March 1574, and was buried the next day at St Brynach's Church, Nevern. A number of bards sang elegies at his passing.<br>
