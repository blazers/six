<span class="headword">Eyre,  Edmund John</span>  (1767&#150;1816), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 20 May 1767, the son of Ambrose Eyre (1739/40&#150;1796), rector of Leverington and Outwell, Cambridgeshire, and his wife, the sister of the Revd Mr Underwood, rector of East Barnet. Eyre was sent to the Merchant Taylors' School when he was ten years old, and in 1785 he was appointed exhibitioner&#151;first on Parkin's and afterwards on Stuart's foundation&#151;at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He left the university without graduating to join a theatrical company, and on 28 May 1791 his play <span class="italic">The Dreamer Awake</span> received its second (and last) performance at Covent Garden, with Eyre in the role of Standfast. This was to be his only London role until 1806, when he appeared at Drury Lane. The interim period was spent at theatres in Bath, Bristol, and Edinburgh, where Eyre gained considerable experience as a comedian, although he is said to have been a &#145;respectable rather than a great actor&#146;  (Baker).<br>
<br>Eyre's personal life was complicated and is shrouded in some mystery. He was married to Mrs Elizabeth Bolton on 22 January 1793 in Birmingham; she was an actress with the Bath company, and continued to act as Mrs Eyre up to the 1799&#150;1800 season. Eyre is said to have left her in 1804, when he eloped with another actress, a Miss Smith, whom he is reported to have married in July of that year at Stratford-le-Bow. Genest claims that &#145;he either gave his name or was married [to Miss Smith], upon the frivolous pretence of some irregularity with which his first marriage was attended&#146;  (Genest, <span class="italic">Eng. stage</span>, 8.202). Whether or not this second marriage was legal, she was presumably the Mrs Henrietta Eyre who performed in Edinburgh from the spring of 1805, and who acted there with Eyre until his death.<br>
<br>As a writer, Eyre was industrious and versatile. He was the author of two poems, &#145;A Friend to Old England&#146; (1793), and &#145;The Two Bills&#146; (1796), and of a volume entitled <span class="italic">Observations Made at Paris during the Peace</span> (1803), but his reputation rests on his dramatic pieces. These include a tragedy, <span class="italic">The Maid of Normandy</span> (1793); comedies such as <span class="italic">Consequences</span> (1794) and <span class="italic">High Life in the City</span> (1810); <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span> (1811), a dramatization of Sir Walter Scott's poem; and <span class="italic">The Tears of Britain, or, Funeral of Lord Nelson</span> (1805).<br>
<br>Eyre died in April 1816, leaving his second wife and their numerous children in some financial difficulty. A theatrical benefit held for his family was very successful, and Henrietta Eyre remained a member of the Theatre Royal company at Edinburgh until at least 1820.<br>
