<span class="headword">Kook,  Abraham Isaac</span>  (1865&#150;1935), <span class="occ">rabbi and Zionist</span>, was born on 6 September 1865 in the small town of Greiva in Latvia (then part of tsarist Russia), the son of Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Kook and his wife, Faigah Leah. Born into a strictly Orthodox Jewish family, Kook attended the famous Lithuanian Talmudic academies of Volozhin (1884&#150;6) and Ponovezh (1887&#150;8). Ordained while still a teenager, he was appointed rabbi of Zaumel, Lithuania, in 1888 and of Bausk, Lithuania, in 1895. He married Batsheva Rabinowicz-Teumim; and after her death in 1890 he married Raiza Rivka Rabinowicz-Teumim, with whom he had a son. In 1904 he rejected offers of even more illustrious communal positions in eastern Europe and emigrated to Palestine, then part of the Ottoman empire, becoming rabbi of Jaffa and of the Jewish colonies recently established in the surrounding region.<br>
<br>This move reflected the depth and uniqueness of Kook's religious commitment to Zionism, the modern Jewish national movement which had been formally inaugurated with the convention of the First Zionist Congress at Basel in 1897. The vast majority of contemporary rabbinical authorities opposed Zionism, considering it a sinful attempt by avowed secularists to bring Jewry's divinely ordained exile to a premature end. Kook, however, argued that the impulses underlying modern Jewish nationalism constituted authentic testimony to the presence of sacred properties within the Jewish soul. Moreover, he regarded Zionism, in its organized form, as an agency which would facilitate the advent of the Messiah. In Jaffa, Kook developed these themes, increasingly stressing the mystical dimensions of Jewry's attachment to the Holy Land. He also composed a series of erudite <i>responsa</i>, which supplied practical solutions within the framework of Orthodox Jewish law to the ritual dilemmas arising from the resumption of Jewish agricultural enterprise in Palestine. He thereby laid the intellectual foundations for a brand of religious Zionism which sought to harmonize the requirements of traditional practice with the realities of the Jewish national revival.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1914 Kook visited Europe with the purpose of generating wider support for his ideas, only to be stranded on the continent by the outbreak of the First World War. Unable to return to Jaffa, he set up home in Switzerland until accepting, in 1916, an invitation to serve in England as rabbi of the Spitalfields Great Synagogue (<i>Machzike Hadath</i>, &#145;upholders of the faith&#146;), an immigrant Orthodox community located in Brick Lane in the East End of London. This fortuitous circumstance placed Kook at the very focus of Zionist activity during the period of diplomatic negotiations which culminated in the publication on 2 November 1917 of the Balfour declaration (which expressed the British government's support for the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine). Convinced that he was living out the &#145;end of days&#146; foretold by the biblical prophets, Kook regarded British official approval of Zionism as a crucial step towards ultimate Jewish redemption. He invested considerable energy in advertising this view to Anglo-Jewry, appearing on numerous public platforms alongside proponents of alternative&#151;and sometimes competing&#151;brands of Jewish nationalism. The support of so illustrious a rabbinical figure was undoubtedly of some help to the Zionists in their struggle for local communal legitimacy. In practical terms, however, Kook was a more doubtful asset. As one Zionist leader wrote to another, his ideas were thought to be &#145;too full of <i>sancta simplicitas</i>&#146; to be of much utility  (Nahum Sokolow to Chaim Weizmann, 6 March 1917, Weizmann Archives, file 213).<br>
<br>At the end of the First World War, Kook called for renewed efforts to strengthen the spiritual aspects of the Jewish national revival in <span class="italic">Degel Yerushalayim</span> (&#145;The flag of Jerusalem&#146;), published in London, 1918. In the summer of 1919 he himself returned to Jaffa, and two years later was elected the Ashkenazi (occidental Jewish) head of the new rabbinic court of appeals established by the British mandatory government of Palestine. As such, he effectively functioned as the Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Palestine, a post which he held with distinction until his death in Jerusalem on 1 September 1935.<br>
<br>In office Kook demonstrated a rare ability to combine a deeply mystical outlook with an intense involvement in communal affairs. Thus he seriously prepared himself for future office as priest of a restored temple cult while also supporting the foundation of a secular Hebrew university. Unusually for a rabbi he composed poetry, but also established a traditional seminary of advanced Jewish learning in Jerusalem. Above all Kook, although himself always rigorous in the observance of traditional Jewish practices (and dress), sought tirelessly to promote religious&#150;secular understanding. He regarded all of the Jewish pioneers in mandatory Palestine, self-confessed heretics included, as unwitting instruments of the imminent redemption, and insisted that they be respected as such. The manifest love of the heavily bearded rabbi for all his fellow Jews, whatever their personal beliefs, was widely reciprocated, and his funeral in Jerusalem, on 1 September 1935, occasioned a rare demonstration of Jewish communal unity.<br>
<br>Never a systematic thinker, and prone to compose his thoughts in a rather esoteric Hebrew style, Kook's principal intellectual influence was posthumous. His subsequent renown as a Zionist theorist owed much to the efforts of his only son, Rabbi Zevi Yehudah Kook (1891&#150;1982), who succeeded him as head of the Central Kook Academy in Jerusalem. It was the younger Kook who saw many of his father's edited writings through the press, notably <span class="italic">Orot</span> (&#145;Lights&#146;), first published in Jerusalem in 1942, thereby making them accessible to wider groups of disciples. However, the full text of his manuscripts, entitled <span class="italic">Shemonah kevatzim</span> (&#145;Eight collections&#146;), was not published until 1999, and even then in only a limited edition. Aspects of Kook's school of thought, and especially those which stressed the immanent sanctity of the Holy Land, became influential in national religious circles in Israel after the Six Day War of 1967, when they were frequently cited by supporters of the Jewish settler movement.<br>
