<span class="headword">Speght <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Procter]</span>,  Rachel</span>  (<em>b. </em>1597?, <em>d.</em> in or before 1661?), <span class="occ">polemicist and poet</span>, was the daughter of James Speght (<i>d</i>. 1637), a Calvinist minister in London who was rector of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street (1592&#150;1637), and of St Clement Eastcheap (1611&#150;37); nothing is known of her mother. Her father was the author of religious tracts and had some associations with the Goldsmiths' guild and the City establishment. Rachel had three surviving siblings, Sara, Rebecca, and Samuel; two others died in infancy. Thomas Speght, editor of Chaucer (1598 and 1602), may have been a kinsman. One of Rachel's works, <span class="italic">Mortalities Memorandum</span>, was dedicated to her godmother Mary Moundford &#145;as a testimonie of my true thankefulnesse for your fruitfull love&#146;; Mary was the wife of Thomas Moundford, a renowned London physician who was six times president of the College of Physicians.<br>
<br>Speght was the first Englishwoman to identify herself, by name, as a polemicist and critic of contemporary gender ideology. Her tract defending women, <span class="italic">A Mouzell for Melastomus</span> (1617), is the first, and maybe the only, female contribution to the vigorous Jacobean pamphlet war over women's place and role. She also published, in 1621, a long poetic meditation on death, <span class="italic">Mortalities Memorandum</span>, together with an allegorical dream-vision poem, <span class="italic">The Dreame</span>, that is remarkable for its account of her rapturous encounter with learning and for its impassioned defence of women's humanistic education. Her writings indicate that she had acquired a classical education very rare for seventeenth-century women of any class; she knew Latin and had some training in logic and rhetoric, and had at least encountered a wide range of learned authorities. Her minister father may have conducted or supervised that education&#151;the fact that he left her in his will a copy of the collected works of the puritan theologian Richard Greenham indicates that he valued her intellectual interests&#151;or she may have attended one of the few schools for young gentlewomen at that period. In the preface to <span class="italic">Mortalities Memorandum</span> and <span class="italic">The Dreame</span> she offers her new book in part to reassert her authorial rights against those who (refusing to credit female achievement) attributed her tract to her father. As a member of the London bourgeoisie she seems not to have been much troubled by the anxieties about authorship and publication common among the upper classes in early modern England, and especially among women. She may indeed have hoped to earn money from writing as a quasi-professional author.<br>
<br>The immediate stimulus to Speght's writing was the publication in 1615 of an anonymous attack on women: the rambling, boisterous, tonally confused but lively <span class="italic">Araignment of Lewde, Idle, Froward, and Unconstant Women</span> by Joseph Swetnam. This tract inaugurated the rancorous Jacobean skirmish in the centuries-old <i>querelle des femmes</i>, or debate over the nature and worth of womankind. Two years later, in 1617, Speght's answer, <span class="italic">A Mouzell <span class="roman">[muzzle]</span> for Melastomus <span class="roman">[black mouth]</span></span>, was published by Swetnam's printer, Thomas Archer, who was apparently trying to capitalize on a popular controversy. Of the eight major contributors to the Swetnam and cross-dressing controversies of 1615&#150;20 only Speght (then nineteen) published under her own name and insisted on her authorial identity. Most of the tracts in these controversies recycled hoary arguments pro and con, and the male writers saw themselves as participants in an ongoing game of wit. Speght's tract breaks the mould of such rhetorical gamesmanship and, inserting herself into the male preserve of protestant biblical exegesis, reinterprets biblical texts&#151;especially the creation&#150;fall story from <span class="roman">Genesis</span>&#151;so as to make them yield a more expansive and equitable concept of gender.<br>
<br>Speght attacks Swetnam on particular points, as the genre and readership of such polemics required, but her sometimes trenchant invective against his logic and style is restricted to the prefatory matter and a few poems, and to an appended small tract, <span class="italic">Certaine Quaeres to the Bayter of Women</span>, with separate title-page, epistle, and preface. In the <span class="italic">Mouzell</span> proper she looks past Swetnam to engage ministers and other commentators who find in scripture some basis to devalue and wholly subjugate women. Her most radical claims are extrapolations from <span class="roman">Galatians</span> 3:28, that under the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> &#145;male and female are all one in Christ Jesus&#146;. On that authority she applies the parable of the talents to women, inferring that &#145;no power externall or internall ought woman to keep idle, but to imploy it in some service of God&#146;, while her own act of writing this tract makes the case that some talents ask employment beyond the domestic sphere. She concludes with a stern warning to men who invite God's certain revenge for reviling his best gift and excellent handywork&#151;&#145;women I meane, whom God hath made equall with themselves in dignity, both temporally and eternally&#146;. A copy of the <span class="italic">Mouzell for Melastomus</span> at the Beinecke Library, Yale University (1h Sp 617m), contains in the margins some eighty-seven harsh and derogatory manuscript annotations in a contemporary hand. These are probably Swetnam's notes, prepared with a view to answering Speght's tract, although no such answer was published.<br>
<br>Most of what is known about Speght's early life must be extrapolated from her allegorical dream-vision poem, <span class="italic">The Dreame</span>, which prefaces her long meditative poem, <span class="italic">Mortalities Memorandum</span> (1621). The latter offers itself as an example of a proper Christian meditation on death and indicates that her mother's death in June 1620 prompted it. <span class="italic">The Dreame</span> allegorizes in a romance mode the obstacles that Speght encountered and overcame in her pursuit of learning&#151;her own fears, the dissuasions of others, the distractions of domestic duties&#151;as well as the encouragement she apparently found from (perhaps) her father and mother, or the Moundfords. It is enlivened by the dialogue of the speaker with allegorical characters: Thought, Age, Experience, Truth, Dissuasion, Industry. Rachel the speaker has to overcome difficulties mounted by Dissuasion:<blockquote>
<div>As dulnesse, and my memories defect;<br>
</div>
<div>The difficultie of attaining lore,<br>
</div>
<div>My time, and sex, with many others more<br>
</div> (ll. 106&#150;8)</blockquote>Once entered into Erudition's garden, however, she delights in the &#145;taste of science&#146; and desires to &#145;reape this pleasure more and more&#146;. Truth delivers a paean to knowledge, forcefully countering the conventional arguments in contemporary tracts for limiting woman's education to what is of practical use in her life&#151;the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, religious treatises, grammar, handwriting, domestic skills (and, for aristocrats, music, dancing, and modern languages)&#151;with the progressive argument that the very nature of humankind makes all knowledge useful for all humans. At length some unspecified &#145;occasion&#146; forced her, regretfully, to end her studies, to return<blockquote>
<div>to that place &hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>From whence I came<br>
</div>
</blockquote>and to use her time &#145;other-ways&#146;  (ll. 238&#150;40), presumably in domestic offices. Soon afterwards she encountered a &#145;full fed Beast&#146; [Swetnam] attacking women and was prompted to muzzle him; and some time after that [1621] another devouring beast [Death] that depopulated countries and took her mother.<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">Mouzell</span> Speght does not attack patriarchy as a social arrangement but she does deny any essential basis for it in nature or in the spiritual order. She also represents the family in terms very different from conventional views of it as an analogue of monarchy in the state. <span class="italic">The Dreame</span> offers an uncompromising defence of woman's education on the same basis as man's education. Speght's serious effort to rethink the implications of the dominant biblical discourse in regard to women was provoked by Swetnam but <span class="italic">The Dreame</span> suggests that it was also provoked by her own situation as a learned young woman hedged about by restrictions. Both tract and poem strongly, cogently, and subversively argue her own and all good women's worth and substantial equality with men.<br>
<br>On 6 August 1621, at the age of twenty-four, Speght married William Procter (1593&#150;1661) of Somerset, also a Calvinist cleric (and the author of published sermons) at St Mary Woolchurch, London. In 1624 the Procters were living at Upminster in Essex, just outside London, where William was serving as a curate, and from 1627 in the parish of St Giles Cripplegate, where two children were baptized: Rachel (26 February 1627) and William (15 December 1630). In 1631 William Procter gained the living of Stradishall, a rural community in south-west Suffolk, and in 1634 Rachel gave birth to another child, Joseph. In 1644, after much controversy between puritan and establishment factions in his parish, Procter was ejected as &#145;scandalous&#146; and as a strong supporter of Laudian liturgies and ceremonies. As a condition of receiving the customary one-fifth income from the rectory as maintenance for herself and her children, Rachel Speght was ordered to move three miles out of town and refrain from &#145;fomentinge any faction&#146; against the cleric who succeeded her husband&#151;perhaps indicating that she had been actively involved in the parish controversies. Whether the ruling against Rachel was enforced is not known, but the family continued to live in Stradishall, where Procter owned several houses. William Procter evidently kept a school in his house after sequestration; he was restored to his living in 1661 but died between April and mid-July of that year. Rachel Speght published nothing after her marriage and there is no record of her death, though as William Procter's will makes no mention of her, she evidently predeceased him.<br>
