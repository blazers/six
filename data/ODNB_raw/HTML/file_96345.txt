<span class="headword">Miller,  William Alexander <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>  (1890&#150;1970), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was born William Ernest Miller at 10 East Street, East Stonehouse, Devon, on 15 July 1890, the son of John Alexander Miller and his wife, Sarah Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wall. His father was a sailor from Sierra Leone, and the port of neighbouring Plymouth, with both merchant and Royal Naval facilities, was a major harbour with marine industries and other employment opportunities. After education at local schools Miller went into the building trade, then served an apprenticeship as an electrician in the dockyard at Devonport, the Royal Navy's substantial base. On 11 May 1913, at Devonport, he married Marion Ruby Fowell (1887&#150;1933), daughter of John Fowell, carpenter. During the First World War he served in the Royal Flying Corps, rising to be a warrant officer.<br>
<br>On his return to Plymouth Miller continued to work as an electrician in the dockyard, and was active in the Electrical Trades Union. With Henry George Mason, a friend from school days, he was active in Labour Party politics in the town. He became the secretary of the party in Drake division, and an election agent for John (Jimmy) Moses in the general elections of 1923, 1924, and 1929. In the latter Moses won by two thousand votes and became Plymouth's first Labour member of parliament. Opponents claimed that Moses (and Miller) had used bribery and other corrupt practices, and petitions were raised. Miller was alleged to have allowed a hire car to be used in the campaign&#151;a breach of electoral law. Defended by Stafford Cripps, Moses was tried in October 1929. Miller was called to give evidence. The petition was dismissed. Moses, despite Miller's continuing help and guidance, lost the 1931 election by 12,000 votes.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Miller involved himself in civic activities, having first been elected a member of Plymouth council in 1925. He served on various committees including those relating to electricity, cemeteries, and tramways. Innovations under his leadership included free wiring, cremations, and showrooms to encourage the purchase of electrical products. The open-air swimming pool on Plymouth Hoe, opened in 1935, was known locally as Miller's Lido. His reputation as a person prepared to assist led to queues of people outside his home in East Street, Stonehouse, waiting to see &#145;the poor man's lawyer&#146;. All this activity meant his family&#151;on 6 October 1934 he married, secondly, in Willesden, Winifred Alberta Tavener (<i>b</i>. 1910/11), daughter of Herbert Tavener&#151;had a limited income.<br>
<br>Miller's vision of a future war&#151;influenced by his knowledge of flying&#151;led him to criticize the council's lack of preparation against bombers, despite Plymouth's massive naval dockyards making it a certain target. The city was half-destroyed by German raids during March and April 1941. Miller headed the air raid wardens in Stonehouse (and saw his home bombed), getting the army to provide street kitchens and the marines to assist in clearing the debris from streets. He also organized an unofficial evacuation of women and children, commandeering buses and trucks to take them to less dangerous areas. He was arrested and put on trial: he was reprimanded, but some days later the city copied his actions. He served as a member of the Plymouth reconstruction committee from 1944, and again as an election agent for the Drake constituency in the 1945 general election. All three of the city's constituencies saw Labour members take their seats (Bert Medland in Drake, Lucy Middleton in Sutton, and Michael Foot in Devonport).<br>
<br>In November 1945 the Labour Party became the dominant group on Plymouth council. Miller now chaired the housing committee. As well as the dream of new, hygienic accommodation to replace the bombed slums of dockyard families, there was an urgent need to find homes for returning soldiers and sailors. One thousand temporary homes were erected within one year. Miller and his colleagues started on new estates, despite grave shortages of materials. The wartime expansion of manufacturing facilities at the dockyards led Miller to obtain the navy's assistance, and drainpipes and other hard-to-come-by goods were made there. Miller's involvement in Plymouth's new housing led him to reject an offer to become lord mayor as that would have caused him to step down from being chair of the housing committee. Plymouth had by 1950 become the county borough with the third highest level of house building relative to population. Plymouth's housing estates were built in neighbourhoods centred on shops, schools, and churches.<br>
<br>Miller was awarded the British Empire Medal in 1946, and in 1947 was appointed OBE. He joined such national organizations as the National Housing Council and the housing committee of the Association of Municipal Corporations. He met Labour government ministers and worked with the future prime minister Harold Wilson on projects to educate and train building workers. After a spell in 1950&#150;51 off the council he again chaired the housing committee from 1953 to 1959. In 1959 he attended two world congresses organized by the National Housing and Town Planning Council, which he chaired. In 1962 he became deputy mayor, remaining a councillor until shortly before his death on 21 December 1970, at Freedom Fields Hospital, Plymouth, of uraemia, bronchopneumonia, and other causes. His son Claude Miller (<i>b</i>. 1915) followed his father, being active in the Labour cause from the 1930s; he served as a justice of the peace from 1968 to 1985, a member of Devon county council from 1981, a Plymouth councillor from 1997, and in 2004 lord mayor of Plymouth.<br>
