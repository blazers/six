<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Manby,  George William</span>  (1765&#150;1854), <span class="occ">inventor</span>, was born at Denver, near Downham Market, Norfolk, on 28 November 1765, the son of Matthew Pepper Manby, a captain in the Welch fusiliers. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17923/', "Thomas Manby (1769&#150;1834)")</script> was his younger brother. He attended a school at Downham, kept by Thomas Nooks and William Chatham. He then attended school at Bromley, Kent, studying under Reuben Burrow, then teacher of mathematics in the military drawing-room at the Tower. After a short time he entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, but because of a delay in obtaining a commission in the artillery he joined the Cambridgeshire militia, eventually attaining the rank of captain.<br>
<br>Manby married, in 1793, the only daughter of a Dr Preston, and went to live near Denver, but in 1801 domestic problems caused him to leave home and settle at Clifton, near Bristol. Here he devoted himself to literary pursuits and in 1801 he published <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of St David's</span>, followed by <span class="italic">Sketches of the History and Natural Beauties of Clifton</span> (1802) and <span class="italic">A Guide from Clifton to the Counties of Monmouth, Glamorgan &hellip;</span> (1802), all of which were illustrated by engravings from his own drawings. In 1803 Manby wrote a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">An Englishman's Reflexions on the Author of the Present Disturbances</span>, in which he dealt with the threatened invasion of England by Napoleon. This work attracted the notice of Charles Yorke, then secretary of war, and in August of the same year Manby was appointed barrack-master at Great Yarmouth.<br>
<br>Manby's attention was first drawn to the subject of saving life from shipwrecks when he witnessed a naval ship, the <i>Snipe</i>, off Great Yarmouth during a storm in February 1807, when sixty-seven persons perished within 60 yards of the shore, and 147 bodies were picked up along the coast. It occurred to him that the first thing, when effecting a means of rescue, was to establish communication with the shore. To this end he borrowed a mortar from the Board of Ordnance, and in August and September 1807 carried out some experiments before members of the Suffolk Humane Society. The apparatus, by which communication was established between land and sea, was used successfully on 12 February 1808 at the wreck of the brig <i>Elizabeth</i>. The invention had previously been submitted to the Board of Ordnance, who reported upon it in January 1808. It received rapid acceptance and the Navy Board began to supply it to various stations round the coast. In 1810 the apparatus was investigated by a committee of the House of Commons, and the report was published. Manby embodied the results of his work in a pamphlet published in 1812 entitled <span class="italic">An essay on the preservation of shipwrecked persons, with descriptive account of the apparatus and the manner of using it</span>, which was reprinted in many different forms. In 1823 the subject again came before the House of Commons on Manby's petition for a further reward (up to that time 229 lives had been saved by his apparatus), and the committee recommended payment to Manby of &pound;2000. The use of the apparatus gradually extended to other countries, and Manby received numerous medals to mark his achievement. After 1878, however, the mortars were superseded by rope-carrying rockets. Manby's claim was disputed by the supporters of Lieutenant Bell, who in 1807 presented a somewhat similar plan to the Society of Arts. Bell's idea was to throw a rope from the ship to the shore; Manby's plan simply reversed this order of procedure.<br>
<br>Manby also interested himself in the improvement of the lifeboat, and about 1811 he submitted his new boat to the Navy Board, who reported on the trial. The boat was tried again at Plymouth in 1826, but does not appear to have come into general use.<br>
<br>About 1813 Manby commenced experiments with a view to the prevention of accidents on ice, and on 19 January 1814 he read a paper before the Royal Humane Society. The paper embodying his experimental results contained numerous illustrations and was subsequently published. He also directed his attention to the extinction of fires, being the first to suggest an apparatus known as the extincteur, consisting of a portable vessel holding a fire extinguishing solution under pressure. This was exhibited before the barrack commissioners in March 1816, and also at Woolwich before a joint committee appointed by the Admiralty and the Board of Ordnance on 30 August 1816. Manby's first wife died in 1814, and in 1818 he married Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1843), daughter of Sir Thomas Gooch of Benacre Hall, Suffolk. In 1832 he published <span class="italic">A description of instruments, apparatus, and means for saving persons from drowning who break through the ice</span>. Among his other works were his <span class="italic">Reflections and Observations on the Practicability of Recovering Lost Greenland</span> (1829) and a book entitled <span class="italic">A Brief and Historic Sketch of the Life and Public Services of George William Manby</span> (1852). He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1831. Manby died at his house at Southtown, Great Yarmouth, on 18 November 1854.<br>
