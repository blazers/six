<span class="headword">Ravenscroft,  Edward</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1659&#150;1697), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was the sixth son of James Ravenscroft of High Holborn, and descended from the Ravenscrofts of Ravenscroft, Flintshire, where a kinsman was high sheriff  (dedication of <span class="italic">The Anatomist</span>). While there is no extant evidence of his early education, he was admitted to the Inner Temple on 28 November 1659, and to the Middle Temple on 2 April 1667. There is no record of his attending or not attending learning exercises, or of being called to the bar  (Hutchinson, 202). In 1671 he wrote his first play, having, according to its prologue, feigned two weeks of &#145;sickness&#146;. Two years later, on 30 May 1673, his chamber was seized for arrears in rent  (C. T. Martin, ed., <span class="italic">Middle Temple Records: Minutes of Parliament, 1501&#150;1703</span>, 1905, 3.1274).<br>
<br>The first known performance of Ravenscroft's <span class="italic">The Citizen Turned Gentleman</span>, sometimes performed as <span class="italic">Mamamouchi</span>, was produced on 4 July 1672 at Dorset Garden. It was published the same year with a dedication to Prince Rupert. The play was taken from Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Le bourgeois gentilhomme</span>, which was performed in 1670. The character of Sir Simon Softhead was borrowed from Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Monsieur de Pourceaugnac</span> (1669). <span class="italic">The Citizen</span> was a great success with an outstanding performance by the famous comedy actor James Nokes. It ran for nine consecutive days with full houses, was acted at least thirty times before 1675, and became a stock comedy for several decades. In the original prologue, Ravenscroft attacked John Dryden's sense of comedy, praising the audience for their discernment in disliking Dryden's <span class="italic">Assignation</span> (1672). The play ridiculed the pretensions of London's puritan &#145;cits&#146; (a parody on citizens) during the Third Anglo-Dutch War when theatres were more dependent on them for patronage.<br>
<br>Ravenscroft's next play, <span class="italic">Careless Lovers</span>, performed in Lent 1673 and printed that year, also premiered at Dorset Garden. A genteel comedy with satire and farcical intrigue, it was written to expose marital servitude, portraying women as intellectually equal or superior. Careless, an &#145;atheist in love&#146; who asks for everything and promises nothing, is eventually defeated by Hillaria, an attractive &#145;mad&#146; woman with no rules of propriety who brings him to marry her by beating him in the game of wits. Ravenscroft continued the attack on Dryden in its prologue, accusing him of plagiarism (the play itself borrows and reworks a plot from Dryden's <span class="italic">Secret Love</span>).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Wrangling Lovers, or, The Invisible Mistress</span>, was acted at Dorset Garden in 1676 (its first known performance was 25 July) and was published in the same year. It proved a popular comedy of intrigue, bordering on farce. Ravenscroft displayed his versatility in producing <span class="italic">Scaramouch a Philosopher</span> (1677) at the Theatre Royal in May 1677, using the old <i>commedia dell'arte</i> in a Gypsy plot. Presented as an Italian play, it was based on Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Le mariage forc&eacute;</span> (1664) and <span class="italic">Les fourberies de Scapin</span> (1671), and showed Ravenscroft's continued fascination with Moli&egrave;re's <span class="italic">Monsieur de Pourceaugnac</span>. According to the prologue the play was held up in production by actors who opposed French farce, which curtailed its success, although Thomas Otway's rival version of <span class="italic">Les fourberies</span>, <span class="italic">The Cheats of Scapin</span>, which reached the stage first (probably the previous November), might also have caused the delay.<br>
<br>Perhaps the problems with <span class="italic">Scaramouch</span> caused Ravenscroft to adopt a new mode later that year, when his historical tragicomedy <span class="italic">King Edgar and Alfreda</span> reached the stage (probably no later than October). (In the prologue Ravenscroft claimed that the play had been written &#145;at least Ten Years ago&#146;, but could not be staged until public tastes had changed; it is impossible to know whether this was the case.) Some critics complained that it had been plagiarized from William Shakespeare. His next play, staged at the end of 1677 and published in 1678, was <span class="italic">The English Lawyer</span>, an adaptation of George Ruggle's Latin comedy <span class="italic">Ignoramus</span> (1615).<br>
<br>Ravenscroft returned with a more contemporaneous play in the 1678&#150;9 season with <span class="italic">Titus Andronicus, or, The Rape of Lavinia</span>, acted at the Theatre Royal. Derived from Shakespeare's original, it adapted the concept of rape as an invasion of the right of princes to the duke of Monmouth's exile into Holland in September 1679. Again accused of plagiarism, by Gerald Langbaine and others, Ravenscroft claimed to be putting &#145;right&#146; Shakespeare's version. Where the play marked new ground, however, was in the rape scenes. Ravenscroft used the growing fashion for female actresses to display the human body in extreme forms.<br>
<br>The playwright built on shock values in his outrageous farce <span class="italic">The London Cuckolds</span>, first performed at Dorset Garden about November 1681, and published in the following year. The play focuses on three &#145;old puritan cheats&#146; called &#145;cits&#146; who brainwash their wives to stay home like pets or slaves in order to keep them out of trouble while the cits pursue their business in the city fearful of losing a deal. The husbands are mocked throughout the play as cuckolds, while some of their wives fall prey to young men's healthy appetites. All parts are one-dimensional, both sexes are ridiculed, and no morals are drawn. A romp replete with smutty dialogue and abundant consummations, it was so effective that <span class="italic">Cuckolds</span> became the stock comedy performed on lord mayor's day annually until 1752. There were twenty-five performances between 1685 and 1714, and eighty from 1714 to 1747. Revived in 1782 at its centenary, it was eventually banished.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The London Cuckolds</span> was followed in May 1683 with the comedy <span class="italic">Dame Dobson, or, The Cunning Woman</span> (published in 1684), which Ravenscroft called his &#145;Recantation&#146; play. Trying to reverse the wit and amorality of the former, he tried to placate the &#145;moral element&#146; in his audiences with a &#145;sympathetic comedy&#146; that highlighted civility  (Hume, 60&#150;63), as well as closing with an epilogue that attacked the whigs. The play failed. Ravenscroft produced no more plays for a decade. In September 1694 he brought to the Theatre Royal a comedy called <span class="italic">The Canterbury Guests, or, The Bargain Broken</span> (published in 1695), which was cobbled together with some scenes from earlier pieces of his own. It too &#145;met with only a very indifferent success&#146;  (Genest, <span class="italic">Eng. stage</span>, 2.517&#150;18).<br>
<br>Ravenscroft's last successful play was his comedy or farce <span class="italic">The Anatomist, or, The Sham Doctor</span>, which was performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in autumn 1696 and published the next year. Based on No&euml;l le Breton de Hauteroche's popular play <span class="italic">Crispin m&eacute;decin</span> (1680), it was a great success. The short farce was performed with Peter Motteux's musical extravaganza <span class="italic">The Loves of Mars and Venus</span>, with music by John Eccles and Gottfried Finger. Often given as an after piece, it had 131 performances between 1714 and 1747, and 165 between 1747 and 1779. While Ravenscroft regarded it as &#145;the most trivial&#146; of his plays, its story-line of witty servants helping young men keep young women away from old dotards, spiced with bawdy and lively music, enabled it to appeal to all ages. Revised in 1743, having been compressed first into two acts and then into a single act, it was reproduced repeatedly until performed apparently for the last time in 1801.<br>
<br>Ravenscroft's last play, <span class="italic">The Italian Husband</span>, was a tragedy performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in November 1697 and published in the next year. Based on Thomas Wright's <span class="italic">The Glory of God's Revenge Against Murther and Adultery</span> (1685), it was a defence of farce as a serious dramatic genre. The adultery plot did not work, and according to some contemporaries required too much compassion on the part of the audience  (Kewes, 220).<br>
<br>While Ravenscroft's career extended over more than a quarter of a century, he seems to have died comparatively young. He is not known to have produced any play after 1697. Most of his plays were written for the Duke's Company, managed by Thomas Killigrew and Sir William Davenant. He had few if any superiors among his contemporaries in farce, and as a writer had considerable cleverness in adaptation, skill in construction, and an unusual fluency and ease in dialogue. His quarrel with Dryden obtained for him a greater posthumous notoriety than he deserved. But since he borrowed so freely from others, the vituperations of Laingbaine, Dibdin, and other critics that his plays are &#145;a series of thefts from beginning to end&#146;  (Dibdin, 4.204) have given him a press that has held the field in the absence of any critical edition of his work.<br>
