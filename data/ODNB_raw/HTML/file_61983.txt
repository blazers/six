<span class="headword">Bruce,  Brenda Margaret</span>  (1919&#150;1996), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 7 July 1919 at 44 Richmond Avenue, Prestwich, Lancashire, the daughter of George Alexander Findlay Bruce, tobacco sales manager, and his wife, Ellen Isabella Dwerryhouse Vowles. Bruce was educated at the convent of the Holy Family of Nazareth and studied ballet dancing with Margaret Saul and, later, the Ballet Rambert. By the age of three she had informed her mother that she was going to become a fairy, and spent much of her childhood tottering up and down corridors in high-heeled shoes imagining she was Marlene Dietrich. By the time she had become a backbone member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in its formative years, she had acquired wide experience in revue, repertory theatre, and in the West End.<br>
<br>Bruce's first stage appearance was in 1934 at the Theatre Royal, Exeter, in a ballet of <span class="italic">The Babes in the Wood</span>. She made her London d&eacute;but in the following year as a chorus girl in <span class="italic">1066 and All That</span>. &#145;Irresistibly sweet and charming&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 22 Feb 1996), according to a contemporary, she was petite, bright-eyed, button-nosed, with a distinctive mop of shiny red hair that she kept in good order all her life. She joined Sir Barry Jackson's Birmingham repertory theatre for three years in 1936, playing such roles as Lydia Languish in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> and Anne in <span class="italic">The Bront&euml;s of Haworth Parsonage</span>. She toured in revue with the Entertainments National Service Association during the Second World War and in 1943 played one of her favourite roles, Vivie Warren, in Shaw's <span class="italic">Mrs Warren's Profession</span>. She had additional success with Shaw as Eliza Doolittle in <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span> at the Lyric, Hammersmith, in 1947.<br>
<br>Bruce married her first husband, Roy Rich (1911&#150;1970), on 18 January 1946. He later directed her in a season of one-act Shaw plays at the Aldwych. She was soon well-established in the West End, playing a series of leading roles at the Arts Theatre. Her range was exceptional, as she proved throughout the 1950s in plays by authors as diverse as Somerset Maugham, Jean Anouilh, and Sir John Mortimer&#151;and she played Peter Pan at the Scala in 1952. With Roy Rich, who was a television executive, she presented a television chat show, <span class="italic">Rich and Rich</span>, filmed in a studio replica of their Bloomsbury flat. In 1962 she was nominated television actress of the year after a series of starring performances. At the end of 1962 she played in the British premi&egrave;re of Samuel Beckett's <span class="italic">Happy Days</span> at the Royal Court, replacing Joan Plowright at short notice. As Beckett's heroine, Winnie, defying mortality while buried up to her waist, then her neck, in the scorched earth of some post-nuclear disaster area, she won critical acclaim for a performance of &#145;dogged valour&#146; and &#145;hypnotic power&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 22 Feb 1996).<br>
<br>This proved a turning point in her career. Having cut back on stage work to bring up her adopted twin daughters, she began a period of intense activity with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1964, moving to Wellesbourne, near Stratford upon Avon, where she and Rich ran the King's Head, an eleven-bedroom hostelry. She played Mistress Page in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span> on three different occasions for the Royal Shakespeare Company and excelled, too, as the Nurse in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> and as an unutterably moving Paulina in Trevor Nunn's all-white <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> in 1969.<br>
<br>Roy Rich died of cancer in 1970; later that year, on 24 December, she married fellow Royal Shakespeare Company actor Clement Schuyler McCallin (1913&#150;1977), who died of leukaemia in 1977. Her adopted son, Sam, died of asthma aged fourteen in 1975. She worked tirelessly and unostentatiously for both Asthma Research and Amnesty International.<br>
<br>Brenda Bruce was as intense as she was reliable as an actress, combining qualities of rough-edged humanity and emotional sparkle, and she was blessed with a voice of great sensuality, crackle, and bite. She always evinced a spirit of enthusiasm and joy rooted, no doubt, in her vast experience as well as in her ability to overcome tragedy in her personal life. She died as she lived, quickly and without fuss, on 19 February 1996, suffering heart failure after entering the Middlesex Hospital, Westminster, London, for tests. Cancer had been diagnosed one month before, though she never stopped working, filming D. H. Lawrence's <span class="italic">The Widowing of Mrs Holroyd</span> for the BBC in her final weeks.<br>
