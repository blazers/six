<span class="headword">Pepperrell, Sir  William</span>, first baronet  (1696&#150;1759), <span class="occ">army officer and merchant</span>, was born on 27 June 1696 at Kittery Point, Maine (then part of Massachusetts), the sixth of eight children of William Pepperrell (1648&#150;1734), merchant and shipowner, and his wife, Margery (1659&#150;1741), daughter of John Bray. The son of a prosperous citizen who had emigrated from Devon or from Wales as a penniless fisherman, Pepperrell grew up in comfortable circumstances. He received some formal education from his father and private tutors, mostly in practical matters such as geography, surveying, and navigation. Taking a personal share in operating his father's store, he grew up affable, robust, and hardy. He was accustomed to Indian warfare, and was trained in the use of arms. He joined the Maine militia when he was sixteen and was a colonel by 1722. After becoming a partner in his father's business he rapidly improved it, building ships, trading in fish, and importing goods for sale in Boston. He and his father invested the profits from these ventures in real estate, and soon they were almost sole proprietors of the townships of Saco and Scarboro, with large properties in Portsmouth, Hampton, and elsewhere. Pepperrell was shortly one of the foremost men in the colony. On 21 February 1723 he married Mary Hirst (<i>d</i>. 1789), granddaughter of Samuel Sewall, chief justice of Massachusetts; they had four children, two of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>In 1725 Pepperrell became a justice of the peace in York county. A year later he was elected to the Massachusetts general court and appointed commander of the Maine militia. He was elected to the Massachusetts council in 1727, and was thereafter annually re-elected until his death. He served for eighteen years as the council's president. Also in 1727 he attended his first Indian conference, afterwards becoming an expert in Indian affairs. He was appointed chief justice of the York county court of common pleas in 1730, and began studying law. When his father died in 1734 he inherited the bulk of the estate, thus becoming even richer and more powerful. Pepperrell underwent a religious conversion in 1734, was baptized, and subsequently evinced great and sincere piety. In 1744 his son Andrew joined him in business after graduation from Harvard College; Andrew died in 1751. Pepperrell's son-in-law, Nathaniel Sparhawk, who had married his daughter Elizabeth, also entered the business.<br>
<br>In 1745 Governor William Shirley of Massachusetts appointed Pepperrell to command an expedition against the French fortress of Louisbourg on Cape Breton Island. On 30 April Pepperrell landed an army of 4300 men near the fortress, and commenced a determined siege. He assaulted Louisbourg on 26 May, suffering huge casualties, and soon supplies ran short. His troops' morale flagged as half of them fell sick, but they were heartened in late May when the Americans captured a French frigate sent to resupply the fortress. On 16 June, one day before Pepperrell was to launch a second assault, the French garrison surrendered. Although he had not shown great martial skill, Pepperrell had held his forces together and retained the co-operation of the British fleet. For his services he was commissioned a colonel in the British army on 1 September 1745 and authorized to raise a regiment, which he did, the 51st regiment. Also, on 15 November 1746 he was created a baronet, the first such honour given a native-born American.<br>
<br>Pepperrell remained at Louisbourg until the spring of 1746, then returned home. In 1749, having retired from business, he visited London, where he was cordially received by George II and presented by the City with a service of plate. He helped negotiate a treaty with the Indians in 1753. On the renewal of war with France in 1755 he was commissioned a major-general and given command of the eastern frontier. He was acting governor of Massachusetts from March to August 1757. On 20 February 1759 he was promoted lieutenant-general, another first for an American-born Englishman. He died at his home at Kittery Point on 16 July 1759 after a &#145;lingering illness&#146;  (Fairchild, 195), leaving his vast estate to his grandson William Sparhawk, who took the surname Pepperrell.<br>
