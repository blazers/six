<span class="headword">Smallwood, Sir  Denis Graham</span>  (1918&#150;1997), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born on 13 August 1918 at 7 St Alban's Road, Moseley, Birmingham, the son of Frederick William Smallwood, rule manufacturer, and his wife, Irene May, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kentish. Smallwood was educated at King Edward VI School, Birmingham, and joined the RAF in 1938, becoming assistant adjutant and flying instructor in 605 (County of Warwick) squadron, an auxiliary unit flying Gladiator biplane fighters. For most of the Second World War, Splinters Smallwood was attached to Fighter Command, serving as a fighter pilot with 605, 87 and 247 Hurricane squadrons between 1939 and 1942, and leading a Spitfire wing from 1943 to 1944.<br>
<br>On 14 October 1940, at the church of St Agnes, Moseley, he had married Frances Jeanne (1920&#150;1992), daughter of Walter Needham, jeweller of Birmingham. They had a son and daughter.<br>
<br>At 87 United Services squadron Smallwood commanded the ground attacks which backed up the abortive Dieppe raid on 19 August 1942 in which 4000 of the 6000 British and Canadian troops were killed, wounded, or captured. Instead of drawing the entire Luftwaffe forces in northern France into an attritional battle over Dieppe, it was the RAF that suffered a defeat with the loss of 109 aircraft. For his bravery that day in leading his squadron into action against German gun emplacements, Smallwood was awarded the DFC (1942). Following a brief spell with 247 squadron, he was placed in charge of a Spitfire wing operating from bases in Cornwall from where he roved over occupied France, attacking targets of opportunity such as trains, vehicle convoys, and gun positions. After the allied landings in Normandy, he led 131 and 165 squadrons carrying out ground attacks in support of the allied advance inland, for which he was awarded the DSO (1944).<br>
<br>Between 1945 and 1946 Smallwood was directing staff at the RAF Staff College, Haifa. From there he went to headquarters British air forces of occupation Germany and in 1948 he received command of 33 squadron, a Tempest fighter squadron in Germany. Between 1948 and 1952 he was an Air Ministry planner and a member of the Joint Services Staff College. Placed in command of RAF Biggin Hill, he led a large force of jet aircraft on 2 June 1953 for the RAF salute at the queen's coronation.<br>
<br>During the Suez crisis in 1956 Smallwood planned the action of the air task force which neutralized the Egyptian air force. Although the operation was successful, Smallwood, with characteristic forthrightness, called the basis on which he and his fellow planners were expected to work, &#145;a monumental political cock-up&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 19 Aug 1987).<br>
<br>After Suez he commanded the Bloodhound surface to air missile wing at North Cotes in Lincolnshire and in 1961 became commandant of the college of air warfare at Manby. Two years later he was appointed assistant chief of staff (operations). Although a renowned fighter pilot, Smallwood built a new reputation as a bomber leader when appointed to 3 group, Bomber Command, in 1965, senior air staff officer at Bomber Command in 1967, and deputy commander-in-chief, Strike Command, the following year. From 1969 to 1970 he was air officer commanding the Near East air force and, at the same time, administrator of the sovereign base area in Cyprus. Smallwood returned to Britain where he became vice-chief of the air staff, and from 1974 to 1976, commander-in-chief Strike Command. From 1975 he commanded Nato's UK air forces.<br>
<br>Smallwood had the distinction of being knighted twice. Having been appointed MBE in 1951, CBE in 1961, and CB in 1966, he received a KCB in 1969 and GBE in 1975.<br>
<br>Following retirement from the RAF in 1976, Smallwood spent six years as a military adviser to British Aerospace, and in his later years indulged his interest in horses, becoming organizer of the Tythrop horse trials near Thame, Oxfordshire, and chairman of the RAF Equitation Society. Other interests included shooting and gundog training, and he played a major part in charitable fields, notably at Pace, a locally based charity to assist children with cerebral palsy. He was chairman of the Air League as well as being co-founder and president of the Friends of St Clement Dane, the RAF central church in the Strand, London.<br>
<br>Splinters Smallwood died from heart disease at his home, 27 Swinnerton House, Phyllis Court Drive, Henley-on-Thames, on 26 July 1997, survived by his son and daughter, his wife having died in 1992.<br>
