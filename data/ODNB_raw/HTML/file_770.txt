<span class="headword">Ashton,  Henry</span>  (1801&#150;1872), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in Marylebone, London, on 18 April 1801, and was baptized at Marylebone on 3 May 1801, the son of John Ashton (1776&#150;1821) and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Canburn. He was articled to Sir Robert Smirke, one of the leaders of the architectural profession, who had &#145;a large and well-organised office&#146;  (Colvin, <span class="italic">Archs</span>., 877). Ashton exhibited at the Royal Academy from an early age. Giving the address of 75 Hatton Garden, he sent in <span class="italic">A Design for a Monumental Building</span> in 1816, when he was only fifteen, and other designs for villas and a military chapel and mausoleum in the two following years. Then, from 6 Quebeck Street, he offered more designs as well as Italian views between 1820 and 1831, by which time he had entered the office of another successful architect, Sir Jeffry Wyatville. According to Ashton's obituary this took place when Wyatville was &#145;engaged on important work at Windsor Castle&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 879), which could mean any time from 1824 onwards, when Ashton would have been in his early twenties and have completed his articles with Smirke.<br>
<br>Presumably Ashton worked on the drawings for Windsor, and as Wyatville evidently had confidence in him, it is quite likely that he was largely responsible for the final design in 1839 for a royal stable and riding-house outside the castle walls. It is a large building, accommodating 100 stables, space for 40 carriages and a riding-house. Although Wyatville took an interest in the design and was the nominal architect, he was ill and shortly before his death he handed over the execution of the building to Ashton. It was completed in 1842. Ashton also provided designs for new kennels for Queen Victoria to the south-east of the castle. These were built in 1840&#150;41 and included a picturesque half-timbered brick cottage for the dog-keeper. Ashton's association with Windsor was also maintained by his taking over the editorship of the elephant folio <span class="italic">Illustrations of Windsor Castle</span>, a monumental work illustrated by thirty-seven full plates published in 1841, in which Ashton refers to his completion of Wyatville's various works after his death, including those &#145;for the Duke of Devonshire, the Duke of Buccleugh [<i>sic</i>] and several noblemen of the first distinction, both for taste and wealth&#146;  (Van der Wijck, 423). In 1838 he had been summoned to The Hague, probably on Wyatville's recommendation, by the prince of Orange (later William II), who was an admirer of the neo-Gothic style. Ashton drew out different versions of the prince's ideas for a country house at Zorgvliet, some of which were close to aspects of Windsor Castle; but nothing came of it.<br>
<br>Ashton was said to be &#145;an elegant and artistic draughtsman&#146; whose designs &#145;show evidence of considerable professional skill and fertility of invention&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 879). He submitted entries in the competitions for the Houses of Parliament, the Nelson monument, the National Gallery and the Great Exhibition, but he was among the many unsuccessful competitors. He still sent designs to the Royal Academy in the 1850s, from addresses in Westminster, where he erected buildings in Victoria Street for the Westminster improvement commission, which were &#145;amongst the first which offered to the inhabitants of this metropolis the advantages of extensive suites of apartments disposed &#147;<i>de plain pied</i>&#148;, like the Continental and Scotch flats&#146;  (ibid.). These probably included those in Ashley Place, of which he sent a design to the Royal Academy in 1854.<br>
<br>Ashton was said to have possessed &#145;the charm of a polished intellect, pungent wit, and a well-stored mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 879). On 7 July 1857 he married Julia (1821&#150;1878), daughter of William Elliott, professor of music. He died on 18 March 1872 at 23 Palace Gardens Terrace, London, &#145;after a long and trying confinement to his room from partial paralysis&#146;  (ibid.), and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
