</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Desaguliers,  John Theophilus</span>  (1683&#150;1744), <span class="occ">natural philosopher and engineer</span>, was born on 12 March 1683 at La Rochelle, France, the only surviving child of Jean Desaguliers (1644&#150;1699), minister and schoolmaster, and Marguerite Thomas la Chapelle (<i>c</i>.1640&#150;1722). His parents were French Huguenots who emigrated separately; Jean Desaguliers was exiled in 1682, ordained as an Anglican minister by Henry Compton, bishop of London, in November of that year, and sent to Guernsey. Following his son's birth and baptism&#151;as Jean Th&eacute;ophile, in the Protestant Temple of La Rochelle on 17 March 1683&#151;his wife escaped with their son to join him in Guernsey. The family moved to London in about 1690. Two years later Jean Desaguliers became an Anglican lecteur at the Swallow Street French Chapel, and opened a French school in Islington, Middlesex, in October 1696. Desaguliers was a pupil in this school until his father's death, and was then taught by William Saunders at Bishop Vesey's grammar school, Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1705. He graduated bachelor of arts in 1709 and lectured on natural philosophy at Hart Hall, Oxford, from 1710 to 1712, when he proceeded MA. In 1719 he received the Oxford degrees of bachelor and doctor of laws, and these were incorporated at Cambridge in 1726.<br>
<br>In 1712 Desaguliers moved back to London, where he lived for the rest of his life. On 14 October 1712 he married Joanna Pudsey (1690&times;95&#150;1753), daughter of William and Anne Pudsey of Kidlington, near Oxford. They had four sons and three daughters, for most of whom they acquired aristocratic godparents, but only two children survived beyond infancy: John Theophilus (1718&#150;1751) graduated from Oxford, became a clergyman, and died childless, while <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7540/', "Thomas Desaguliers (1721&#150;1780)")</script> led a distinguished scientific military career. From 1715 Desaguliers advertised lectures at his home in Channel Row, where the family lived until about 1739, when the construction of Westminster Bridge&#151;on which Desaguliers had advised&#151;resulted in the demolition of their house. Desaguliers then moved his home and his classes to Bedford Coffee House, Covent Garden, a popular venue for whig lecturers of natural philosophy.<h2>
<a name="Cultivatingpatronage"></a>Cultivating patronage</h2>Desaguliers took deacon's orders in Fulham in June 1710 and priest's orders at Ely House, Holborn, in December 1717. In 1716 he was appointed chaplain to James Brydges (later the first duke of Chandos) who became his most valuable patron and made him rector of Stanmore Parva, Middlesex, in 1719; between 1717 and 1738 Desaguliers acquired two further livings (running consecutively in Bridgeham, Norfolk, and Little Warley, Essex) from George I and George II, and two more chaplaincies (to Frederick, prince of Wales, and to a military regiment). These appointments testify less to Desaguliers's religious commitment than to his skill at acquiring sources of income. His major interests were scientific rather than theological, and his failure to fulfil his clerical duties exacerbated the decline in his profitable relationship with Chandos. Scanty evidence of his faith survives: a sermon he preached before the king in 1717 based on his own entrepreneurial misfortunes, and his physicotheological preface to <span class="italic">The Religious Philosopher</span> (1718&#150;19), John Chamberlayne's translation from the Dutch of Bernard Nieuwentyt or Nieuwentijt.<br>
<br>The prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Isaac Newton, Desaguliers rapidly became well known in &eacute;lite metropolitan circles and was adept at cultivating aristocratic patronage. One example of his diplomatic expertise is <span class="italic">The Newtonian System</span> of 1728, a long allegorical poem written for the accession of George II, which helped to ensure the continuation of his royal support. Flatteringly dedicating it to Queen Caroline, for whom he had already performed experiments, Desaguliers deftly wove together praise for Newton's genius, English liberty, and royal splendour by comparing Newtonian astronomical certitude with Hanoverian stability. In addition, Desaguliers's social mobility was greatly facilitated by his prominent role as an innovative freemason. He is remembered as one of the founders of modern freemasonry and was closely involved in establishing the grand lodge of England in 1717, and most probably assisted James Anderson in writing <span class="italic">The Constitutions of the Free-masons</span> (1723). Desaguliers belonged to several lodges including the influential and prestigious Lodge IV that initially met at the Rummer and Grapes inn close to his home in Channel Row. He became grand master in 1719, was deputy grand master three times, and remained involved in masonic activities for the rest of his life. Like other members of London society, many fellows of the Royal Society were masons during this period. Desaguliers and his peers doubtless arranged many valuable acquaintanceships during meetings: in 1737, for example, he presided over the ceremony in which Prince Frederick was initiated as a freemason.<br>
<br>Desaguliers had many foreign contacts, and often travelled on masonic and scientific business: for instance, in 1721, while on a visit to Edinburgh to repair the city's water supply, he was welcomed at a masonic lodge. In 1731 he visited several cities in the Netherlands and officiated at the initiation of Francis, duke of Lorraine, as a mason; and in 1735, on his only return to France, he attended the opening of a lodge in Paris. However, the significance of his masonic allegiances for the promulgation of scientific ideas or for religious and political subversion is debatable. William Hogarth, also a freemason, is judged to have portrayed Desaguliers three times: in the background of a conversation piece packed with Newtonian references showing John Conduitt's town house, and in two satirical caricatures with masonic implications (as a pedantic preacher and as an old woman riding a donkey). In Hogarth's unflattering representations, confirmed by more conventional portraits, Desaguliers appears stocky and myopic.<h2>
<a name="PromotingNewtonianism"></a>Promoting Newtonianism</h2>Through his lectures, books, and activities at the Royal Society, Desaguliers contributed to the international consolidation of Newtonian natural philosophy and its establishment as a vital component of English polite culture. Fluent in English, French, and Latin, he facilitated English familiarity with continental innovations through his translations, lectures, and books; conversely, by publishing in French, travelling to Europe, and maintaining international contacts, he helped to spread Newtonian ideas abroad. Enmeshed in a metropolitan network of instrument makers, natural philosophers, and experimental engineers, Desaguliers utilized his patronage relationships&#151;particularly with Chandos&#151;to gain financial backing for his technological innovations. Formerly appraised mainly for his role in developing and promoting Newton's ideas, Desaguliers is now also interpreted as a key figure in the rise of science as a public enterprise during the first half of the eighteenth century. By demonstrating the valuable contribution natural philosophy could make to England's material and commercial welfare, he helped to forge a mutually profitable alliance between Newtonian philosophy, public benefit, and private gain that facilitated the nation's future scientific, industrial, and economic transformation.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Desaguliers had attended John Keill's university course, on which his own lectures in Oxford and London were at first closely modelled. Soon after coming to London in 1712 he entered the competitive commercial world of popular lecturing. Benefiting from the death of Francis Hauksbee the elder in 1713, Desaguliers ran courses for Hauksbee's widow and&#151;perhaps with Keill's backing&#151;gradually took over Hauksbee's role as Newton's experimental assistant. Desaguliers was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1714, and from 1716 to 1743 filled Hauksbee's former post as curator of experiments. For several years he received Godfrey Copley's benefaction of &pound;100, and was later awarded the society's annual Copley medal three times (1734, 1736, and 1741). The fact that his salary ranged between &pound;30 and &pound;50 a year according to the number of experiments and lectures he produced is reflected in his prolific output of over fifty papers in the society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. These covered a huge variety of topics, most importantly optics, mechanics, and electricity, and relied on his great skill as an experimental demonstrator. This practical approach underpinned his theoretical work and his popular success, as well as his entrepreneurial engineering projects.<h2>
<a name="Practicalexperiments"></a>Practical experiments</h2>Before Newton's death in 1727, most of Desaguliers's activities at the Royal Society were dedicated to defending contested items of Newtonian doctrine in mechanics and optics. For example, he replicated older experiments and devised new ones to demonstrate the existence of a vacuum dispersed throughout apparently solid matter, a central tenet of Newtonian theory. His explanations of how he repeated some of Newton's optical experiments were designed specifically to refute French and Italian criticisms that Newton had left insufficient instructions to permit verification of his results. In 1727 he published four articles to counter important French claims that Newton had incorrectly described the shape of the earth. Other papers of this period described how he tested air resistance by dropping balls in St Paul's Cathedral, melted substances with a lens, and analysed perpetual motion machines.<br>
<br>Desaguliers was greatly influenced by Stephen Hales's <span class="italic">Vegetable Staticks</span> of 1727, a study of plant respiration informed by the lengthy suggestions Newton had articulated as queries in his <span class="italic">Opticks</span>. Having immediately welcomed this book in a laudatory review, in subsequent papers Desaguliers developed some of Hales's practical devices and explored the implications his conjectures raised about the repulsive and attractive properties of particles of matter. Spread over about fifteen years, Desaguliers's studies of elasticity (expansion and compression) and evaporation offered important contributions to the continuing eighteenth-century debate about whether repulsive phenomena were best accommodated within a Newtonian framework by corpuscles&#151;as Desaguliers tried unsuccessfully to show&#151;or by an aether, or subtle fluid, the solution favoured by English natural philosophers after about 1740.<br>
<br>Desaguliers's most radical conjecture about repulsive particles was to relate the elasticity of fluids and vapours to electricity. Although he had investigated electricity since at least 1716, when Stephen Gray came to live with him at Westminster for three years and assist at his lectures, Desaguliers started performing and describing experiments at the Royal Society only after Gray's death in 1736. Electricity was rapidly becoming the most exciting topic in natural philosophy, and Desaguliers studied and demonstrated phenomena such as conduction, discharge, and attraction and repulsion. Drawing on French research, he revised existing terminology and suggested that air consists of permanently electrified attractive and repulsive particles. His short <span class="italic">Dissertation Concerning Electricity</span> (1742), comprising accounts of twenty-nine experiments and his theoretical suggestions, won a prize offered by the Bordeaux Academy.<h2>
<a name="Lecturesanddemonstrations"></a>Lectures and demonstrations</h2>Outside the Royal Society, Desaguliers continued his commercial lecturing activities. These were extremely influential among the international community of natural philosophers as well as at a less scholarly level. Like that of other lecturers, his success owed much to his dramatic performances with instruments intended for demonstration rather than experimental research; many of these instruments he designed himself, including working models of engineering equipment he had invented and a planetarium, a mechanical device for displaying the movement of the planets round the sun, which he claimed was more accurate than elaborate orreries. In London men and women came to hear Desaguliers's frequent lectures at Channel Row, where his house must have been crammed with instruments, teaching materials, student boarders, and new inventions such as model engines and an 8 foot wide centrifugal bellows. Advertising his ability to lecture in three languages, Desaguliers went on lecturing tours to provincial cities like Bath and visited the Netherlands twice during the 1730s. In addition, he entertained members of the royal family with philosophical experiments at Hampton Court and at Kew, where Prince Frederick had a room full of Desaguliers's instruments. In 1734 he boasted that he was embarking on his 121st course, and that, of the dozen or so other experimental lecturers in the world, eight had been his students. These included William 'sGravesande, who subsequently became a prominent professor interpreting and teaching Newtonian natural philosophy at Leiden, and Stephen Demainbray, a popular international lecturer who later worked for George III.<h2>
<a name="Writingandpublishing"></a>Writing and publishing</h2>Desaguliers reached still wider audiences by publishing his lectures, some versions appearing in French as well as English. His earlier publications, such as his <span class="italic">Physico-Mechanical Lectures</span> (1717) and a couple of syllabuses of the 1720s, were abstracts designed primarily as advertising material. Paul Dawson compiled <span class="italic">Lectures on Experimental Philosophy</span> (1719) from notes, opportunistically placing Desaguliers's name on the title page, but Desaguliers ensured that a critical preface was included. The first volume of his own far more substantial <span class="italic">Course of Experimental Philosophy</span> did not appear until 1734; there was a further delay of ten years before the appearance of the second volume, reportedly because Desaguliers was grappling with the international <i>vis viva</i> debate between Leibnizians and Newtonians about the mathematical relationship between the force and velocity of a moving object. The two volumes contain twelve separate lectures, many of them on mechanical topics, and each carrying detailed annotations for further study. Aiming at a wide market, Desaguliers deliberately avoided mathematical explanations. In a characteristically chauvinistic assault on Ren&eacute; Descartes's &#145;philosophical Romance&#146;, he stressed that it was through Newton's experimental and observational approach that &#145;we owe the routing of this Army of Goths and Vandals in the Philosophical World&#146;  (preface, <span class="italic">Course of Experimental Philosophy</span>, 1734). With their fine illustrations these books&#151;particularly the second&#151;visually demonstrate the inseparability of Desaguliers's theoretical and experimental work at the Royal Society from the many schemes of practical engineering in which he was involved. As well as standard philosophical apparatus such as air-pumps, thermometers, and magnets, he built and described working models of technical inventions, including a watermill, steam engines, and carts. To explain physical principles he often used non-technical examples familiar to his popular audiences; for example, he showed labelled drawings of fairground performers displaying feats of strength.<br>
<br>In addition to his own writing and teaching, Desaguliers was involved in other publishing projects. For instance, he contributed pieces on topics such as the reflecting telescope and Hadley's quadrant. As a fluent linguist, in the early stages of his career he earned money through translations, though some arguments with publishers and authors did ensue. His choice of texts reflects his own interests, and sometimes he added Newtonian editorial notes. His translations from French included a detailed practical book on military fortification (1711), an instruction manual for building better chimneys (1715), a text on hydrostatics and water fountains (1718), and a short account of mechanical automata and wind instruments (1742). From Latin he co-translated, with George Sewell, Archibald Pitcairne's pro-Newtonian iatro-mechanical physiology (1715) and in 1720 translated 'sGravesande's <span class="italic">Physices elementa mathematica</span> as <span class="italic">Mathematical Elements of Natural Philosophy</span>, thus influentially importing Dutch versions of Newtonian ideas into England.<br>
<br>Desaguliers was obsessed with experimentation. When some of his spectacular water rockets unfortunately exploded underneath a passing barge and nearly sank it, he immediately converted this disastrous experience into underwater trials of gunpowder. Constantly spending beyond his means, he sought ways to supplement his income by using his skills in natural philosophy to solve practical problems. For example, in collaboration with the instrument maker William Vream, he focused on the ventilation and heating deficiencies plaguing buildings, ships, and mines, and redesigned chimneys, bellows, and air heaters. Relying on his international connections with other engineers, he built new types of water-wheels and steam engines that could more efficiently drain water from mines or supply ornamental fountains. He constructed improved versions of other devices, including a pyrometer, a barometer, a crane, and various pumps.<br>
<br>In the competitive and financially unstable environment of early eighteenth-century London, Desaguliers became involved in patent disputes, forged temporary alliances with other entrepreneurs, denounced fraudsters, and used his social connections to win profitable contracts. Most importantly, between 1716 and about 1740, he was embroiled in an increasingly stormy patronage relationship with Chandos, initially visiting the latter's Middlesex estate every week. In exchange for clerical sinecures, Chandos deployed Desaguliers's technological expertise to improve his own property and involved him in numerous financial ventures, such as soap manufacture, ore refinement, and mine development. Desaguliers reported many of the inventions he developed for Chandos in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. He showed the fellows experiments on working models to explain his innovations, and discussed the difficulties he had encountered in schemes to measure depth at sea, purify the air, or install piped water systems.<br>
<br>Desaguliers had long suffered from gout every winter, and died after several months of severe illness at his home in the Bedford Coffee House on 29 February 1744; he was buried on 6 March in the Savoy Chapel, London. Mainly on the basis of a satirical verse by James Cawthorn in his poem &#145;The Vanity of Human Enjoyments&#146;, some biographers have claimed that Desaguliers died impoverished, but this seems unlikely since he made a will in favour of his elder son shortly before his death.<br>
