<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pococke,  Edward</span>  (1604&#150;1691), <span class="occ">oriental scholar</span>, was born on 8 November 1604 at Oxford, the eldest child of Edward Pococke (<i>d</i>. 1636), a clergyman originally from Hampshire, and his wife, Hester Shepard, and baptized the same day at St Peter-in-the-East. He spent his infancy at Chieveley, Berkshire, where his father, a former fellow of Magdalen College, had recently been appointed vicar. At an early age he was sent to the free school at Thame, where he received a good grounding under the master Richard Boucher.<h2>
<a name="FormationatOxford"></a>Formation at Oxford</h2>On 4 June 1619 Pococke matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, where one of his contemporaries was Edward Leigh, with whom he maintained an acquaintance. Admitted scholar of Corpus Christi College on 11 December 1620, under his tutor there, Gamaliel Chase, he learned Hebrew as well as Greek, graduating BA on 28 November 1622 and proceeding MA on 28 March 1626. Later that year he attended Matthias Pasor's lectures on Arabic, which introduced him to what was to be the central interest of his life. Finding Pasor's instruction insufficient, he then applied to the foremost English Arabist of the time, William Bedwell, and was privately taught by him at his vicarage at Tottenham High Cross. It was probably there that Pococke first met John Selden, who was later to be his patron and protector.<br>
<br>Pococke was admitted probationer fellow of his college on 24 July 1628. By this time he had learned enough Syriac (perhaps from Pasor's lectures) to prepare an edition and translation of a manuscript of the epistles <span class="roman">2 Peter</span>, 2 and 3 <span class="roman">John</span>, and <span class="roman">Jude</span>, which he had discovered in the Bodleian Library, but which had been omitted from Widmanstetter's edition of the Syriac <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. In November 1629 the great Dutch scholar G. J. Vossius, who was visiting England to accept the grant of a canonry at Canterbury, noticed this manuscript while being shown round the Bodleian, was informed of Pococke's edition, and insisted on meeting the author. Their long talk ended with Vossius offering to have the edition published at Leiden, which had the printing facilities lacking in England at that date. Pococke agreed, and in 1630 the book was published, under the supervision of Louis de Dieu. In the meantime Pococke had been ordained by Richard Corbet, bishop of Oxford. He had also applied for the post of chaplain to the Levant Company at Aleppo. His purpose in so doing was to learn Arabic language and literature at the source, and it seems probable that the inspiration had come from his talk with Vossius, whose friend Jacobus Golius (professor of Arabic at Leiden) had recently returned from a long stay with the Dutch merchants at Aleppo, bringing back a magnificent collection of oriental manuscripts.<h2>
<a name="StudyatAleppo"></a>Study at Aleppo</h2>Pococke was appointed chaplain at the Levant Company's general court in London on 31 March 1630. It is possible that among his patrons were his father's Berkshire neighbours, the Fettiplaces: Charles Fettiplace was treasurer of the company at Aleppo while Pococke was there. Having left England with the company's ships in summer 1630, Pococke arrived at Aleppo on 17 October, bringing a recommendation from John Selden to the consul, John Wandesford, in whose house he lived for the five and a half years he spent in Syria. All the time that he could spare from his ministerial duties he devoted to studying the oriental languages (principally Arabic, both written and spoken, but also Hebrew, Syriac, and Ethiopic) and to collecting manuscripts. His friendships at Aleppo encompassed both Muslims and Christians of various persuasions. His Muslim teacher (&#145;shaykh&#146;), Fathallah, praised his pupil's skill and character long after. Pococke also employed the dervish Ahmad to teach him and to copy and buy manuscripts (services which he had previously performed for Golius). Letters written later by the dervish to Pococke at Oxford are extant. According to Edward Leigh, Pococke was so respected by the local inhabitants that they chose him as an umpire to settle their disputes. Christian friends included Michael Thaljah, a professional scribe, brother of the local Greek Orthodox bishop, and Golius's brother Petrus, a Catholic missionary known as Celestinus de Sancta Liduina.<br>
<br>In October 1631 the chancellor of Oxford, William Laud, who was already collecting manuscripts with a view to enriching the Bodleian Library, wrote to Pococke asking him to buy Greek coins and Greek and oriental manuscripts on his behalf. Pococke later supervised the dispatch of manuscripts from Aleppo in accordance with a royal ordinance procured by Laud (now archbishop of Canterbury) which required every returning ship of the Levant Company to deliver one Arabic or Persian manuscript to him. Laud had not as yet met Pococke, but obviously had good reports of him, for after he had determined to establish a professorship of Arabic at Oxford he wrote to Pococke ordering him to return home soon in order to be the first to hold the chair.<h2>
<a name="ProfessorofArabic"></a>Professor of Arabic</h2>Pococke accordingly left Aleppo (before April 1636), and arrived in Oxford in time to take his BD on 8 July. He was then formally appointed professor of Arabic, and delivered his inaugural lecture on 10 August. It is regrettable that only a small part of this is preserved (printed at the end of his <span class="italic">Carmen Tograi</span>, 1661), for it already displays Pococke's independence from the trite themes of contemporary Arabists: it deals with the love of the ancient Arabs for poetry. Laud's statute required the professor to lecture on Arabic grammar and literature every Wednesday in Lent and during vacations, and imposed attendance on all bachelors and all students in medicine, but it seems that this last requirement was a dead letter, and during the more than fifty years that Pococke lectured at Oxford he had only a few dedicated pupils.<br>
<br>Pococke had brought back from Aleppo, together with numerous manuscripts, an edition he had prepared of the proverbs of al-Maydani. This remained unpublished during his lifetime, for he had recently acquired a manuscript of a work which interested him far more. This was the &#145;History of the dynasties&#146; of Abu'l-Faraj (Bar Hebraeus), an account of Islamic history, which, although by a Christian author of late date, was far superior to anything available in print in Europe at that time. However, Pococke felt dissatisfied with his ability to produce an adequate translation, for lack of the requisite works on Islamic geography and history. The remedy was found by the brother of Thomas Greaves (his chamber fellow at Corpus), John Greaves, a fellow of Merton, who was anxious to travel to the east for his own astronomical researches, and proposed that the two should go together to Constantinople, where Pococke might find the resources he needed. Through the agency of Peter Turner, Laud's right-hand man at Oxford, Greaves obtained from the chancellor leave of absence for Pococke to travel to Constantinople, retaining his professorial salary. Pococke also had to spend more than &pound;500 of his own, which the recent death of his father had made possible. Laud appointed Thomas Greaves, whom Pococke had instructed in oriental languages, as deputy professor of Arabic during Pococke's absence. In return Greaves and Pococke promised to procure manuscripts for Laud.<h2>
<a name="Travelandmanuscriptcollection16371641"></a>Travel and manuscript collection, 1637&#150;1641</h2>The two friends embarked on a ship for Constantinople in early July 1637, but Greaves left the ship at Leghorn to pursue his own researches in Italy. Pococke continued alone to Constantinople, where he stayed for the next three years, living in the house at Galata of the English ambassador, first Sir Peter Wyche (for whom he acted as chaplain), later Sir Sackville Crowe. There he was joined before the end of the year by Greaves, who however left for further exploration in Rhodes and Egypt in August 1638. But in July 1639 Pococke encountered another oriental scholar, Christianus Ravius, a German (known in England as Christian Ravis) whose eastern travels were supported by Archbishop Ussher. He arrived with a letter of recommendation from Vossius to Pococke, who arranged for him too to live in the ambassador's household. Pococke was occupied in perfecting his knowledge of the languages and collecting manuscripts, with the help of old friends at Aleppo and new friends at Constantinople. These included several learned Jews, notably Jacob Roman, who introduced Pococke to the study of Judaeo-Arabic, and procured important Hebrew manuscripts for him. He also received help from Cyril Lucaris, patriarch of Constantinople, but this ceased with Cyril's execution by the Turks in June 1638. Pococke sent Laud a long account of this event, and later repeated it orally to Thomas Smith, who subsequently published it in his <span class="italic">Account of the Greek Church</span> (1680). He also made an Arabic translation of Hugo Grotius's famous eirenic treatise <span class="italic">De veritate religionis Christianae</span>, with the principal intention of healing the divisions which he had witnessed between the various Eastern Christian sects.<br>
<br>In August 1640, responding to the concerns of Charles Fettiplace and Laud about the worsening political situation in England, Pococke embarked on his return journey. He took a detour through Paris in order to visit Grotius and ask his permission to make changes in his translation of the part of his book dealing with Islam, by excising some puerile fables about Muhammad falsely attributed to the Muslims. Grotius agreed, and gave Pococke a message for Laud, who by this time had been impeached and was in custody. On his arrival in England (March 1641) Pococke visited Laud in the Tower and reported Grotius's advice, to use any means of escape abroad. Laud refused to give his accusers this satisfaction. He had in the meantime settled the Arabic professorship with a permanent endowment. Pococke returned to Oxford, where at the end of the year he was visited by Ravis, accompanied by his Arabophone amanuensis Nicolaus Petri, whose Arabic letters to Pococke reveal an admiration for his learning and a liking for him in strong contrast to his contempt and hatred for his master, Ravis.<h2>
<a name="Domesticandacademiclife16421655"></a>Domestic and academic life, 1642&#150;1655</h2>In 1642 Pococke was presented by his college to the rectory of Childrey in Berkshire, which was to be his residence for the next eighteen years except for the short stays in Oxford required for his lectures. Early in 1646 he married Mary, daughter of Thomas Burdet of West Worldham, Hampshire. Their eldest child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22431/', "Edward Pococke (bap. 1648, d. 1726)")</script>, was baptized in October 1648. Between then and January 1661 five more sons and three daughters were born to them: all except one lived to adulthood. Pococke was a conscientious pastor, but in the troubled years during and immediately after the civil war had trouble with parishioners disgruntled about tithes and his adherence to the prayer book. He was also harassed by quartering of soldiers from the victorious parliamentary army, until John Greaves procured him a protection signed in December 1647 by the commander Sir Thomas Fairfax.<br>
<br>After Laud's execution in 1645 parliament sequestered the estate designated to support the Arabic professorship, and for three years Pococke lost the income from that source, until it was restored by the efforts of Selden in London, and Gerard Langbaine, provost of Queen's College, in Oxford. When the visitors appointed by parliament in 1647 to reform Oxford began their activities, Pococke submitted to their authority (unlike Greaves and others, who were in due course expelled), but avoided taking the covenant and the &#145;negative oath&#146; abjuring all connection with the king, by the expedient of staying away from Oxford and the visitors. However, attention was drawn to him when, after the death on 27 March 1648 of the professor of Hebrew, John Morris, the king, then a prisoner on the Isle of Wight, nominated Pococke as successor. This post carried with it the considerable advantage of a canonry at Christ Church. Selden, who was a member of the parliamentary committee for regulating the universities, got that committee to confirm the appointment (12 April), but Pococke seems not to have occupied the canon's lodgings assigned to him. In the following year he refused to take the engagement promising loyalty to the republican regime, and was accordingly, despite the efforts of Greaves and Selden, deprived of his canonry, which was given to Peter French (Cromwell's son-in-law), on 24 October 1650. It seemed likely that Pococke would also lose the Hebrew and Arabic professorships, and the committee had actually so ordered, but were persuaded by a petition signed by leading members of the university in December 1650 to postpone implementing this order until a suitable replacement had been found. No replacement was forthcoming (Ravis, who had earlier coveted Pococke's Arabic post, had already departed for Sweden), and Pococke was not further disturbed at Oxford, where he stayed at Balliol College when performing his required lectures.<br>
<br>At Childrey, however, some malcontent parishioners cited Pococke before the commissioners appointed by Cromwell for ejecting &#145;ignorant, scandalous, insufficient and negligent ministers&#146;. In these proceedings, which dragged on for months in 1655, Pococke defended himself vigorously, and was supported by local notables, including the Fettiplaces. An appearance by a delegation from Oxford, headed by the then vice-chancellor, John Owen, who warned the commissioners of &#145;the infinite contempt&#146; which they would incur if &#145;they had turned out a man for insufficiency, whom all the learned, not of England only, but of all Europe, so justly admired for his vast knowledge, and extraordinary accomplishments&#146;  (Twells, 174), finally persuaded them to dismiss the charges.<h2>
<a name="1650spublications"></a>1650s publications</h2>Pococke by this time had indeed earned a reputation for learning throughout Europe, by the publication of <span class="italic">Specimen historiae Arabum</span> (1650). In 1648 Langbaine persuaded him to commit the outcome of his twelve years' study of Abu'l-Faraj's history to print. The resulting book consisted of a small excerpt from the history, in Arabic and Latin, accompanied by a lengthy commentary (printed first in 1648) illuminating Islamic history, geography, mythology, religion, and literature from a wealth of sources, mostly unpublished and previously unknown in Europe. It represents a revolution in Arabic studies, being Pococke's attempt to show that far from being a mere ancillary to biblical exegesis, Arabic literature (in the widest sense) was worthy of study in its own right in the same way that the classical cultures were. It is his greatest work, and of permanent scholarly value. It was also the first Oxford book printed with the Arabic types which Laud had acquired for the university.<br>
<br>Pococke was also responsible for the earliest work to be printed with Laud's Hebrew types. This too was a pioneering work, for it was in Judaeo-Arabic, hitherto virtually unknown to Christian scholars, except for Saadya Gaon's translation of the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> published at Constantinople in 1546. The book, called <span class="italic">Porta Mosis</span>, consisted of six prefatory sections of Maimonides' commentary on the <span class="roman">Mishna</span>, with translation and Pococke's extensive commentary, in which he emphasized the importance of the medieval Jewish works written in Arabic, then the lingua franca. Although Pococke embarked on this publication in 1652, it did not appear until 1655, because in the meantime he had received a request from Selden to produce an edition and translation of the <span class="italic">Annals</span> of Eutychius, a Christian Arabic writer for whom Selden bore an affection (he had himself published a controversial extract in 1642, for which Pococke had assisted him, but not enough to eliminate all Selden's blunders). The proposed edition was to be printed at Oxford at Selden's expense, and supervised by Pococke and Gerard Langbaine. Pococke, knowing that Eutychius was an unreliable historian, was reluctant to undertake the assignment, but felt that he owed Selden so much that he could not refuse. Selden died on 30 November 1654 before the work was completely printed, but he bequeathed the edition and the costs of finishing it to the two supervisors. Pococke completed it for publication in 1656, although he made clear in his preface his dissatisfaction with many aspects of the book.<br>
<br>Pococke was also concerned, between 1652 and 1657, with the publication of the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>. His printed contributions to this are small, but he loaned several important manuscripts, and performed the valuable service of reading the proof-sheets as they were issued and sending his suggestions to the supervisor, Brian Walton. His only other publication of this decade was a tiny pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Nature of the Drink Kauhi, or Coffe</span>, an extract in Arabic and English from a work of al-Antaki. This was a joke on Pococke's part; he had become addicted to coffee-drinking (then a novelty in England) while in the east, and a later palsy in his hand was ascribed to this. Among the pupils attracted to Pococke's Arabic lectures about this time were Edward Bernard, Robert Huntington, Narcissus Marsh, and Thomas Smith.<h2>
<a name="Latercareerandpublications"></a>Later career and publications</h2>At the Restoration, Pococke's canonry was restored (20 June 1660), and after settling a dispute about the assignment of the proper lodgings, he moved with his family on 27 July into the canon's quarters at Christ Church which he was to occupy for the rest of his life. As some compensation for his sufferings as a royalist he was advanced to the degree of DD by royal command on 20 September 1660. At Christ Church he participated fully in the duties associated with the cathedral and the college, and from 1662 was a delegate of Oxford University Press, where his influence may be seen in the choice for publication of such books as William Beveridge's edition of the Greek canons (1672), which included the Arabic version.<br>
<br>Immediately after returning to Oxford, Pococke had begun to prepare an edition and translation of the complete Abu'l-Faraj, and this, which remained the standard edition until the twentieth century, was published in 1663. Meanwhile he had produced a textbook for students of Arabic, an edition of the poem <span class="italic">Lamiyyat al-&#145;Ajam</span> of al-Tughra&#145;i (<span class="italic">Carmen Tograi</span>, Oxford, 1661), with a literal facing translation and extensive notes on elementary grammar and lexicography. It included a treatise by Pococke's favourite pupil, Samuel Clarke, on the metrics of Arabic poetry. The book represents the substance of one of Pococke's lecture courses, and is of interest for the introductory section giving a justification for learning Arabic greatly different from those common at the time. His Arabic translation of Grotius's <span class="italic">De veritate</span>, done long before, had also finally appeared in print (1660), thanks to financial support from Robert Boyle, who had become a friend and admirer of Pococke during his residence at Oxford in the previous decade. Copies of the book containing only the Arabic text, specially prepared for the lands of Islam, were distributed later by Robert Huntington, chaplain at Aleppo from 1670 onwards. Pococke's concern for the spiritual welfare of the Eastern Christians was also demonstrated by his publication, at his own expense, of his Arabic translation of the Anglican catechism (1671). He also produced an abbreviated Arabic version of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, published by the university press in 1674.<br>
<br>Pococke's most widely influential book, however, was a translation of the &#145;philosophical fable&#146; (&#145;Hayy ibn Yaqzan&#146;) of ibn Tufayl, published with the Arabic text under the title <span class="italic">Philosophus autodidactus</span> (1671). Although nominally the work of his eldest son, Edward, whom he was grooming to be his successor as Arabic professor, it was conceived, supervised, and partly written by the father. He had long before prepared an English translation, of which fragments survive among his notes, and was apparently about to publish it in 1660. However, that earlier project came to nothing, perhaps because of fears that the work might appear too controversial, since it can be read as exalting the power of human reason to attain knowledge of the divine without the aid of revealed religion (it has been condemned as such by both Muslims and Christians). The book engendered lively interest, particularly among deists and Quakers, and versions in English and the vernaculars of Europe were soon made from the younger Pococke's Latin.<br>
<br>Despite this success, the increasing scorn for Arabic studies in post-Restoration England and Oxford frustrated Pococke's further attempts to get Arabic texts published. These included his edition of al-Maydani's proverbs, the original version of Maimonides, <span class="italic">Guide of the Perplexed</span>, and a most interesting account of the wonders of Egypt by &#145;Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi. Part of an edition of the latter with a translation by the younger Pococke was actually printed about 1685, but then the edition was abandoned for obscure reasons. The elder Pococke therefore turned to the more acceptable medium of biblical commentary. He produced a series of commentaries on the minor prophets, beginning with <span class="roman">Micah</span> and <span class="roman">Malachi</span> in 1677, and ending with <span class="roman">Joel</span> in 1691, the year of his death. The commentaries were in English, but contain much oriental learning, with quotations in the original languages.<h2>
<a name="Reputationandlegacy"></a>Reputation and legacy</h2>Pococke was the finest European Arabist of his time (only Golius could compare with him), and among the greatest of all time. He possessed not only a breadth and depth of learning astonishing in an age when most Arabic literature still had to be read in manuscript, but also a sympathy and understanding for Islamic culture almost unique in an intellectual climate in which suspicion and hatred for other sects and religions were the norm. His published work was long influential, and is still instructive. He was also an accomplished Hebraist, well read in rabbinical writings.<br>
<br>As a teacher Pococke was less successful, and he failed to found a flourishing tradition of the study of Arabic. Of his most promising pupils Samuel Clarke and William Guise died young, Huntington failed to write anything, Marsh was distracted by his ecclesiastical career, Thomas Smith became disgusted with Muslims by his experiences at Constantinople, and Bernard frittered away his talents in one unfinished project after another. Pococke's son Edward was obviously unfitted for the academic career into which his father tried to push him. In the event his successor as Arabic professor was no pupil of his own, but Thomas Hyde, who was more interested in Persian than Arabic.<br>
<br>Pococke was greatly admired by his contemporaries in the republic of letters, and seems to have been almost universally liked by those with whom he came in contact. His amiability is confirmed by the otherwise unilluminating account of his character supplied, long after his death, by John Locke to his first biographer, Humfry Smith. His hatred of disputes, and tolerance of others' opinions, makes it difficult to discern his own views on controversial subjects. It is rare to find in his works an outburst like that to which he was goaded by his treatment before the commissioners for insufficient ministers, directed against those who think that knowledge of any language but the vernacular is a positive impediment to understanding scripture: &#145;Genus hominum plan&egrave; <i>atopon kai alogon</i>, atque huius saeculi lues&#146; (&#145;the plague of this age&#146;; <span class="italic">Porta Mosis</span>, Twells edn, vii). But his veneration of Grotius and his respect for such writers as Maimonides among Jews and al-Ghazali among Muslims are sufficient indications that he believed that religion should be based on reason. His friendships with Jews, Muslims, and Christians of many persuasions vouch for his tolerance, and his disgust with religious intolerance in his own time and place is easily inferred from his long and detailed account of the sects of Islam in the <span class="italic">Specimen</span>. These attitudes may help to answer a question posed by his contemporaries, why after the Restoration he received no ecclesiastical preferment beyond the restoration of his canonry and the DD, while others of smaller attainments and less unblemished records of loyalty were promoted to bishoprics. Pococke's well-attested modesty is a sufficient explanation, but it is possible that his aversion to religious disputation and dogmatism positively dissuaded him from attempting advancement in the church.<br>
<br>Although Pococke suffered a severe affliction for several years from 1663, which left him permanently lame, he continued in the performance of his duties and his studies to the end of his long life. He died, of old age, at Christ Church, on 10 September 1691, and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, where a monument was erected by his widow. He was also survived by five sons and two daughters. His great collection of 420 Arabic, Hebrew, and other oriental manuscripts, many of them choice, was bought from his widow for &pound;800 for the Bodleian, and preserved under his name. Pococke had carefully kept his scholarly correspondence, comprising hundreds of letters and drafts. This was the principal basis for Leonard Twells's life of Pococke prefixed to his edition of the <span class="italic">Theological Works</span> (1740), but has vanished without a trace since that date, leaving Twells's laborious but unimaginative and not always reliable biography as the primary source for the details of Pococke's life. Only some letters to Pococke in Arabic and Hebrew were kept by his son Edward  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Pococke 432). Several noble trees planted from seeds that Pococke brought back from the east commemorated him long after his death. A cedar in the rectory at Childrey was still flourishing in the nineteenth century. A great plane tree was at the end of the twentieth century in &#145;Pococke's garden&#146; at Christ Church, and a large fig tree (the &#145;arbor Pocockiana&#146; engraved by J. Storer in 1806) was producing fruit in the garden of the Hebrew professor in 1911.<br>
