<span class="headword">Morrison,  Sophia</span>  (1859&#150;1917), <span class="occ">cultural fieldworker in the Isle of Man and campaigner for the Manx language</span>, was born on 24 May 1859 at Peel, Isle of Man, the third of nine children of Charles Morrison (1824&#150;1880), merchant and ship owner, and Louisa Crellin (1830&#150;1901). Her father was a well-respected figure who owned a fleet of fishing boats operating from the western fishing port of Peel. His relative wealth provided sufficient means to fund training for the professions of doctor and chemist for two of her brothers. From a background where education was keenly encouraged Morrison developed an interest in languages, particularly those of the Romance and Goidelic Celtic groups. As well as Manx Gaelic she was fluent in French and possessed a working knowledge of Italian, Spanish, and Irish and Scottish Gaelic. Diary entries reveal that she was already well read in European literature as a teenager.<br>
<br>Despite being brought up in an English-speaking household Morrison became a fluent speaker of Manx Gaelic. She taught the language at evening classes in Peel, and in 1899 was among the founder members of Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh (YnCG; the Manx Language Society), of which she was appointed honorary secretary in 1901. She was editor and proprietor of the society's journal, <span class="italic">Mannin</span>, which appeared between 1913 and 1917, in nine volumes.<br>
<br>Morrison was in constant contact with Manx antiquarians, including A. W. Moore (1853&#150;1909), J. J. Kneen (1873&#150;1938), and W. H. Gill (1839&#150;1923), and held the post of vice-president of the Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society in 1912. She contributed an article on A. W. Moore to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> and to the <span class="italic">Celtic Review</span>. Influenced greatly by figures of the previous generation such as the poet T. E. Brown and the music collector Dr John Clague she was committed to collecting and promoting all aspects of Manx culture. Furthermore she acted as a facilitator, securing the publication of pioneering teaching aids such as Goodwin's <span class="italic">First Lessons in Manx</span> (1901). As a member of YnCG she was frequently part of the Manx delegation to the pan-Celtic movement, and her attitude was firmly that of the pan-Celticist rather than the narrowly nationalist. Her work as secretary to YnCG also brought her into regular contact with leading Celticists such as professors John Rh&#375;s (Oxford), Quiggin (Cambridge), and Watson (Edinburgh), as well as with Douglas Hyde (Dublin).<br>
<br>Morrison's collection of folklore was greatly influenced by her friendship with the German folklorist Charles Roeder (1848&#150;1911), who was based in Manchester; together with Roeder she published <span class="italic">Manx Proverbs and Sayings</span> (1905). She bridged the worlds of informant and collector, and of educator and educated. She was widely accepted as the island's authority on Manx fairy lore, having published research in <span class="italic">Folk Lore</span>, for example. She contributed the Manx sections in <span class="italic">Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries</span> by Evans-Wentz (1911), and her own publication <span class="italic">Manx Fairy Tales</span> appeared in 1911, with subsequent editions in 1929 and 1991.<br>
<br>In addition to her work for Manx Gaelic, Morrison was an important figure in developing &#145;Anglo-Manx&#146; dialect writing, working extensively with the local theatrical company the Peel Players, who performed on the island and in Liverpool. She staged many plays by Christopher Shimmin and Josephine Kermode (Cushag). Joseph Wright's <span class="italic">English Dialect Dictionary</span>, for which she was an invited reader, proved invaluable in preparing <span class="italic">A Vocabulary of the Anglo-Manx Dialect</span> (1924). The <span class="italic">Vocabulary</span> was instigated by A. W. Moore and completed by Morrison with the aid of her relative the linguist Edmund Goodwin (1844&#150;1924). It represents a series of snapshots of the Manx English linguistic situation of the late nineteenth century in particular, and draws on literary and oral sources.<br>
<br>Morrison, who did not marry and lived with her parents until their decease, suffered in later life from neuralgic headaches and severe problems with her eyes, and underwent several operations. She died, of cancer, on 14 January 1917 at her home, 15 Athol Street, Peel. Her funeral, in Peel on 17 January, was well attended, her coffin being carried by members of the Peel Players. She was buried in Peel cemetery. &#145;No heavier blow has ever befallen the cause of Manx nationality&#146;  (Caine, 499).<br>
<br>It is only Morrison's extreme sense of modesty that has concealed her contribution to the Manx revival. During a period of cultural and linguistic activity on the Isle of Man she was instrumental in introducing Manx Gaelic teaching in schools, and pioneered phonograph recordings of Manx Gaelic and Manx English speech and music. The all-encompassing nature of her contribution to Manx culture means that Sophia Morrison was the very locus for Manx revivalist, antiquarian, and folklore circles at the turn of the twentieth century.<br>
