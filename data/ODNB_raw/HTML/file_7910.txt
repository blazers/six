<span class="headword">Mackenzie,  Kenneth</span> <span class="st"> [<em>later </em>Sir Kenneth Douglas, first baronet]</span>  (1754&#150;1833), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Dundee, the son and heir of Kenneth Mackenzie of Kilcoy, Ross-shire, and his wife, Janet, daughter of Sir Robert Douglas, baronet, author of the <span class="italic">Scots Peerage</span>, and sister of Sir Alexander Douglas of Glenbervie, last baronet. On 26 August 1767, aged thirteen, Mackenzie joined the 33rd regiment as an ensign. Having been promoted lieutenant in 1775, he transferred to the 14th regiment in 1783, with which he served in the West Indies until 1791 and thereafter in the Netherlands campaign, during which, as a senior lieutenant, he commanded a company. He was wounded at the ill-fated siege of Dunkirk, but his prowess as an officer caught the attention of Thomas Graham of Balgowan (later General Lord Lynedoch), who, when raising the 90th regiment in 1794, asked for Mackenzie's services. The latter, appointed first captain and then major in the new unit, which was considered a light infantry battalion and drilled accordingly, accompanied it to the &Icirc;le Dieu, Gibraltar, and, in 1796, Portugal. Here, under Sir Charles Stuart, Mackenzie headed and instructed an improvised battalion comprising the light companies of the various regiments in Stuart's force. Accompanying Stuart's expedition to Minorca, he served as deputy adjutant-general and was made lieutenant-colonel when the island fell in October 1798.<br>
<br>Sir Ralph Abercromby superseded Stuart and, after landing in Egypt, defeated General Menou at Abu Qir on 20 March 1801. Mackenzie, with the 90th, saw heavy fighting, during which not only Abercromby but also Lieutenant-Colonel Ogilvie of the 44th was killed. Mackenzie took command of that unit in his stead, and remained with it in Egypt and Gibraltar until 1803, when he was recalled and attached to a training camp at Shorncliffe, Kent.<br>
<br>Shorncliffe was under the jurisdiction of General Sir John Moore, commander of the southern military district. Moore realized that because, over the preceding decades, afforestation, enclosure, and urbanization had transformed the south of England and numerous other areas of the European terrain, military tactics were in a state of flux; and light troops, once confined to a subordinate role on the periphery of armies, were now playing an ever greater part in set-piece battles, with the French fielding thousands of <i>tirailleurs</i>, <i>voltigeurs</i>, and <i>chasseurs</i>. Encouraged by the duke of York, the commander-in-chief, Moore wanted to transform some regiments of the line into permanent bodies of light infantry which, suitably equipped and trained, would be capable of fighting, not only in the customary close-order formations of the period but also as free-thinking, free-firing skirmishers. However militarily prudent this might seem, it was a somewhat controversial proposal at the time, since it involved liberating troops from both the physical and psychological constraints of orthodox linear tactics, and to encourage common soldiers to show initiative was regarded by many as potentially destabilizing.<br>
<br>The first regiment converted to light infantry was Moore's own, the 52nd, which was officially retitled on 18 January 1803. Mackenzie was appointed its lieutenant-colonel because of his particular talent for training skirmishers, and he played a pivotal role in the instruction of the new unit. An accomplished marksman whose principal pastime was shooting, he applied some of the practices of the hunt to the battlefield, educating his troops in fieldcraft and in the work of the scout. He also devised a new tactical drill and manual exercise, together with a more natural style of marching which enabled the soldiers to move more rapidly and with less fatigue. This was the famous &#145;Shorncliffe system&#146; of drill, of which Mackenzie was the principal architect. He also promoted a more relaxed form of discipline woven from strands of Enlightenment thinking: the common soldier was no longer treated like an automaton, to be flogged and drilled into obedience, but more like a member of a family in which his seniors were encouraged to take on a paternal role.<br>
<br>By July 1803 the 43rd foot had also been redesignated as a light regiment. Brigaded together with the 95th (rifles), they and the 52nd had plenty of time to hone their new skills while awaiting Napoleon's expected invasion of southern England. Mackenzie, however, was seriously injured&#151;suffering &#145;a very severe concussion of the brain&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 443)&#151;in a fall from his horse in November 1803. He had to take sick leave during the summer of 1804, but on 18 December at Hythe, Kent, he married Rachel, only child of Robert Andrews of Shorncliffe; they had six sons and a daughter. Promoted colonel on 25 April 1808, he accompanied Graham to Cadiz in 1810 and took command of a brigade. His health remained precarious, however, and he soon returned to Britain to recuperate. His convalescence continued until 1811, when, in June, he was promoted major-general and subsequently placed in charge of another light infantry training camp, at Brabourne Lees, east Kent.<br>
<br>During 1813 he accompanied Sir Thomas Graham to the Netherlands and had command of the 2nd division before being incapacitated by another fall from his horse. He was made governor of Antwerp in 1814 but, appointed to command and train new light troops in England, was recalled just before Waterloo. Thereafter he retired to Hythe, where he took a keen interest in local affairs and became a jurat. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 19 July 1821, made colonel of the 58th regiment on 1 March 1828, and created a baronet on 30 September 1831, assuming by royal licence in October 1831 the name and arms of Douglas of Glenbervie, the baronetcy of which was dormant since the death of his wife's brother, Alexander Douglas, seventh baronet (1738&#150;1812). He died at Holles Street, Cavendish Square, London, on 22 November 1833 and was buried at Hythe. He was succeeded as second baronet by his son Robert Andrews Douglas (1807&#150;1843), army officer.<br>
