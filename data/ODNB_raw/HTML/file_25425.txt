<span class="headword">Shirley,  Henry</span>  (1591<span class="mult">x</span>7&#150;1627), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was the second son of Sir Thomas Shirley the younger (<i>c</i>.1564&#150;1633) of Wiston, Sussex, traveller and member of parliament, and his first wife, Frances, daughter of Henry Vavasour of Coppenthorp, Yorkshire. His exact date of birth is unknown, but he must have been born between his parents' secret marriage in late 1591 and the baptism of his younger brother, Thomas, on 30 June 1597. His childhood was no doubt somewhat unsettled, for his father ran up many debts travelling to Portugal and Turkey and was imprisoned several times.<br>
<br>Shirley's one surviving play, <span class="italic">The Martyred Soldier</span>, is a Christian martyr play set among the medieval Vandals and Goths. It concerns the noble warrior Bellizarius and his wife, Victorina, converts to Christianity who endure much hardship for their beliefs. They are comforted by angels who sing a number of songs, one of which is preserved in a contemporary setting in a manuscript in the Bodleian Library (MS Don. c.57, fol. 24). Eventually the pair are martyred, but their daughter Bellina marries and converts Hubert, who becomes the first Christian king of the Vandals and Goths. The play was licensed in 1622&#150;3 for Lady Elizabeth's Men at the Cockpit and then for Palsgrave's Men at the Fortune, but it was not entered in the Stationers' register until 15 February 1638 and was published that year, with a title-page declaring that it had been &#145;acted at the Private house in Drury lane, and at other publicke Theaters. By the Queenes Majesties servants&#146;. The dedication to Sir Kenelm Digby was signed by John Kirke, an actor&#150;playwright long associated with the Red Bull theatre.<br>
<br>Shirley's only other surviving work is a set of verses in another manuscript in the Bodleian Library (MS Ashmole 38, fol. 75), entitled &#145;The Battaile the Combattantes, Sr Ambrose Vaux Knight; and Glascott the Bayley of Southwarke&#146;. John Davies of Hereford's <span class="italic">Scourge of Folly</span> (1611) has a poem addressed to &#145;Henry Sherley, Esquire&#146;, but this is probably too early to be the dramatist. Four plays were attributed to Shirley in a Stationers' register entry of 1653 but are now lost. These include &#145;The Duke of Guise&#146; and &#145;Giraldo, the Constant Lover&#146;, about which nothing more is known; &#145;The Dumb Bawd of Venice&#146;, which was performed by the King's Men at court in 1628; and &#145;The Spanish Duke of Lerma&#146;, which was owned by the King's Men in 1641 and adapted by Sir Robert Howard in 1668 as <span class="italic">The Great Favourite, or, The Duke of Lerma</span>.<br>
<br>In 1622 Shirley's grandmother Lady Anne Shirley left him &pound;40 per annum in her will, to be paid out annually by Sir Thomas Bishop. However, Shirley ran up debts and was chronically short of money. In October 1627 he went to the lodging of Sir Edward Bishop (Sir Thomas's son) in Chancery Lane, London, to demand his annuity, whereupon Sir Edward slew the unarmed Shirley with a sword. Bishop was originally sentenced to be burnt on the hand, but was pardoned on 21 October. The incident was gleefully recounted four years later by William Prynne in <span class="italic">Histriomastix</span>, and in two newsbooks of 1645. Shirley apparently never married, and died without children.<br>
