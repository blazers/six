<span class="headword">Arundell, Sir  John</span>  (1576&#150;1654<span class="mult">x</span>6), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was born on 22 November 1576, the eldest son and heir of John Arundell, esquire (<i>d</i>. 1580), of Trerice, Cornwall, and his wife, Gertrude Denys of Holcombe, Devon. Admitted to the Middle Temple on 8 May 1594, at an unknown date Arundell later married Mary, daughter of George Cary, esquire, of Clovelly, Devon. Arundell was returned MP for the family borough of Mitchell in 1597 and as knight of the shire for Cornwall in 1601. In 1620 he went to great lengths to regain the county seat. Placing <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4636/', "Richard Carew")</script> of Antony (his nephew) and John St Aubyn of Clowance (his brother-in-law) as MPs at Mitchell, he came to an arrangement about the county seats with Bevill Grenvile, apparently allowing the more experienced Grenvile to have the senior knight's place. Arundell then sent Nicholas Burton &#145;to sounde howe Will Currington [Coryton] woulde stande towards him&#146;. Coryton had already decided to stand:<blockquote>but finding his cosen Arrundell to have the same designe he woulde set downe, and throwe all his voyces upon his sayd kinsman: J[ohn] A[rundell] that woulde not be behinde in courtesie, the next daye made him the like offer, which he refused and theye both agreed that JA showld stand. (TNA: PRO, SP 16/117/55)</blockquote>In 1624 Arundell was returned for St Mawes; the following year he failed to regain a county seat for himself, but secured the return of his friend Charles Trevanion for Cornwall.<br>
<br>Arundell maintained his political association with Coryton, from 1626 working closely with him and Sir John Eliot against the duke of Buckingham. He joined Eliot and Coryton in refusing to pay the forced loan and, in April 1627, was named by Sir James Bagg (Buckingham's agent in Cornwall) as one of their &#145;faction&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/60/75). In March 1628 Arundell supported Eliot's and Coryton's candidature as knights of the shire for Cornwall (against Buckingham's candidates), heading the list of signatories on their election indenture. On election day Arundell, with his friends and political allies Grenvile and Trevanion, arrived at the election, each with 500 men &#145;at their heels&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/96/36). Eliot and Coryton were returned for the county and Arundell was elected for Tregony. During the 1630s Arundell continued his opposition to Charles I's arbitrary taxes. On 12 July 1633 he was summoned before the privy council for non-payment of his knighthood composition fine and, in April 1636, was one of the last Cornishmen to pay; in 1637 he was also named as a ship money refuser.<br>
<br>By May 1642 Arundell had changed his political stance and his name was near the head of 7000 signatures on a petition of loyalty from Cornwall to the king. On 29 June he was named to the Cornish commission of array; he was among those most active in promoting it, later &#145;engaging himself and all his 4 sonnes&#146; in the king's cause  (Cornwall RO, T1767). In July 1643, following the death in battle of Sir Nicholas Slanning, the king appointed Arundell as governor of Pendennis Castle, with his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/724/', "Richard Arundel")</script>, as his lieutenant. In July 1644 Arundell harboured Queen Henrietta Maria on her journey from Exeter to France and in February 1646 he sheltered the prince of Wales before his flight into exile. On 18 March 1646 Sir Thomas Fairfax summoned Arundell to surrender, but after &#145;less than two minutes resolution&#146; the governor replied that:<blockquote>I resolve that I will here bury myself before I deliver up this Castle to such as fight against his Majesty, and that nothing you can threaten is formidable to me in respect of the loss of loyalty and conscience. (Coate, 211)</blockquote>The garrison held out for five months, but was beaten by hunger and plague; it was the last castle in England to surrender to parliament. On 17 August the formal surrender took place and the garrison marched out with the full honours of war, &#145;Drums beating, Colours flying, Trumpets sounding&#146;. Arundell signed the treaty of surrender, but wrote at the foot, &#145;condescended unto by me John Arundell&#146;  (ibid., 219&#150;20).<br>
<br>Arundell was one of only eight Cornishmen who in 1641 enjoyed a landed income exceeding &pound;1000 per annum; at the Restoration his son claimed that his estate had been worth more than &pound;2000 a year in 1646. However, after the fall of Pendennis and the collapse of the royalist cause, Arundell's age &#145;required his abode in England where he was Plunder[e]d and sequestred of a very greate stock of quick and dead goods&#146; and of his estate &#145;for 7 yeares at least&#146;  (Cornwall RO, T1767). Arundell's estate was not discharged until 20 December 1654, when he was fined &pound;10,000. Of this, &pound;8000 was written off in view of the profits the sequestrators had already received from the estate. Cromwell was sympathetic to Arundell's petition for exemption from the remaining &pound;2000 but, upon receipt of a report from Cornwall that Arundell was considered &#145;one of the most irreconcilable amongst us&#146;, the council confirmed the fine and Arundell was made to pay it.<br>
<br>Arundell made his will on 14 June 1654, professing his belief in &#145;the doctrine, worshipp and disciplyne established and professed in [the] Church of England in the reine of Queene Elizabeth King James and the beginning of the rayne of the late King Charles&#146;, and directing that his body be buried near his late wife in the parish church of Newlyn in Pyder  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/254, fol. 298). His eldest son, John, had been killed in the civil war, so Arundell bequeathed all his lands in Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset to his second son, Richard, who was created a peer in 1664 in recognition of his own and his father's loyalty and suffering. The date of Arundell's death is uncertain, but took place between 14 June 1654 and 22 May 1656, when Richard proved his father's will.<br>
