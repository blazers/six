<span class="headword">Comrie,  Leslie John</span>  (1893&#150;1950), <span class="occ">astronomer and computational mathematician</span>, was born on 15 August 1893 at Pukekohe, near Auckland, New Zealand, the son of John Alexander Comrie and his wife, Helen Lois Smith. His father was a farmer, and both the Comrie and Smith families originally came from Scotland. Comrie never forgot the country of his birth; his hospitality to any New Zealander, particularly a serving member of the forces, was renowned. After attending Pukekohe East School (1900&#150;07) and Auckland grammar school Comrie entered Auckland University College in 1912, where he took his MA degree in 1916 with honours in chemistry. In spite of deafness, which became increasingly acute in later years, he served with the New Zealand expeditionary force in the First World War and was wounded, losing a leg. After the war he took up astronomy and computation, subjects in which he had become interested in Auckland. He went as a research student to St John's College, Cambridge, was elected to an Isaac Newton studentship in 1921, and was awarded his PhD degree in 1924 for a thesis on the occultation of stars by planets.<br>
<br>From Cambridge Comrie proceeded to the United States, where he taught astronomy and computing, first at Swarthmore College, Pennsylvania, and then at Northwestern University, Illinois. He returned to England in 1925 to enter the nautical almanac office, rising to become deputy superintendent in 1926 and superintendent in 1930. In 1920 he married Noeline Dagger, of New Zealand; the marriage was dissolved in 1933 and in the same year he married Phyllis Betty, daughter of H. D. Kitto, of Stroud, Gloucestershire. There was one surviving son of the first marriage and one of the second.<br>
<br>Within ten years Comrie revolutionized the work of the nautical almanac office: his greatest achievement was the complete revision, almost single-handed, of the <span class="italic">Nautical Almanac</span> for 1931&#151;it had been essentially unchanged since 1834. In a paper presented to the Royal Astronomical Society he proposed the use of a fixed frame of reference for the computation of orbits of comets and minor planets and later provided the necessary data in the office's publications; this may well be his most lasting contribution to astronomy. He introduced new methods, computing techniques, and calculating machines, and transformed the office into the most efficient computing organization of its time; he widened its international responsibilities, and laid the foundation for its expansion to fulfil them.<br>
<br>Comrie left the office in 1936 to found the Scientific Computing Service Ltd, a professional organization catering for large-scale numerical computation, particularly in scientific and mathematical fields. He rapidly built up a powerful team of experienced computers, whose resources were fully stretched by the demands of government departments during the Second World War. During and after the war he worked extremely long hours, and after a strenuous tour of Australia and New Zealand he suffered a stroke, which impaired his speech but left him with an active mind.<br>
<br>Comrie was the foremost computer and table maker of his day. He entered the field when the large majority of computing was done by the aid of logarithms and lived to see in operation the first of the automatic digital computing machines. Although he played no direct part in the design of these machines, his influence over a period of thirty years prepared the way for this advance. During this period he was the acknowledged leader in all aspects of computing and table making. His application of commercial mechanical calculating machines to scientific work enabled more rapid and accurate computation than was previously possible. He set new standards of precision, of numerical accuracy, and of presentation which are incorporated in a series of mathematical tables of unsurpassed merit. The greatest of these, in which Comrie compressed a lifetime's experience, is <span class="italic">Chambers's Six-Figure Mathematical Tables</span> (2 vols., 1948&#150;9). He also compiled <span class="italic">Hughes' Tables for Sea and Air Navigation</span> (1938), the finest navigational tables of their type ever produced, together with many other minor tables and descriptions of computational techniques. His work was recognized by his election in 1950 as FRS.<br>
<br>Proud, sensitive, and inclined to be intolerant and critical of others, Comrie could not understand, or forgive, lack of appreciation of his work by those not possessing his energy, precision, or thoroughness. This personality led to constant friction with administrative authority and his break with the Admiralty in 1936, and the same unduly critical attitude led to some difficult personal relationships. However, he was also extremely generous, particularly in giving his own time and energy to helping others, endured severe physical handicaps with patience, and gave his friendship wholeheartedly. After a second stroke Comrie died, on 11 December 1950, at his home, 131 Maze Hill, Greenwich.<br>
