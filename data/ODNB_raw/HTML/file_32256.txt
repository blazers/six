<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cameron, Sir  David Young</span>  (1865&#150;1945), <span class="occ">painter and etcher</span>, was born on 28 June 1865 at 1 Queen's Terrace, Glasgow, the fourth of the nine children and elder surviving son of the Revd Robert Cameron (1825&#150;1898), minister of Cambridge Street United Presbyterian Church in Glasgow, and his wife, Margaret Johnston (<i>bap</i>. 1839, <i>d</i>. 1924), elder daughter of Donald Robertson, a surgeon in Perth, and his wife, Jessie. Cameron inherited his artistic ability from his mother, who was a talented amateur watercolourist, as did his younger sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56491/', "Katharine Cameron (1874&#150;1965)")</script>, a watercolourist and etcher. From 1874 to 1881 he attended Glasgow Academy. In his final year he began classes at the Glasgow School of Art, which he continued when he began work as a clerk in a Glasgow iron foundry. After two years he left Glasgow for Perth, where he spent a further period working in the law office of his great-uncle David Hepburn. However, he loathed office work. In 1884 he finally decided to become a painter, despite his father's cool response to the idea, and enrolled at the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh, where he remained until 1887. His fellow students included William Miller Frazer, George Denholm Armour, Charles Mackie, James Pryde, and William Walls. In 1886 he exhibited for the first time at the Royal Scottish Academy and the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts. On 30 April 1896 he married Jeanie Ure (1871&#150;1931), the eldest of the three daughters of Robert Maclaurin, a partner in Archibald Orr Ewing &amp; Co., and his wife, Margaret Anderson. They had no children.<br>
<br>Cameron first came to prominence as an etcher. In 1887 George Stevenson, himself a talented amateur etcher and friend of the noted etcher Francis Seymour Haden, saw by chance some of Cameron's sketches, persuaded him to take up etching, and helped him to etch his first plates. Subsequently Cameron produced about 520 etchings and dry-points&#151;principally architectural subjects and landscapes&#151;in a career which spanned forty-five years, becoming with fellow Scots Muirhead Bone and James McBey one of the foremost British etchers of the etching revival of 1880&#150;1930. On the strength of his print <span class="italic">A Perthshire Village</span> (1888) he was elected an associate of the Society of Painter-Etchers in 1889 at the age of twenty-three, becoming a fellow six years later. He exhibited with the society each year until 1903, when he resigned along with William Strang in protest at its decision to admit reproductions to its exhibitions. Cameron held his first one-man show in the galleries of Van Baerle in Glasgow in 1891. Four years later he had his first exhibition in the United States, in the New York gallery of Frederick Keppel &amp; Co. He was awarded medals for etching at expositions in Chicago (1893), Brussels and Dresden (1897), Paris (1900), and Munich (1905). His achievement as one of the foremost etchers of his day was recognized in 1911, when he was made an associate engraver of the Royal Academy. Five years later he was elected an associate painter, the only person to have achieved this double distinction. His prints were issued in small editions, averaging fifty impressions, almost invariably printed by Cameron himself. This led collectors in Britain and the United States to vie with each other to acquire his later prints, and resulted in relatively high prices at auction during the &#145;etching mania&#146; of the 1920s. No plates were executed between 1918 and 1922, when he was busy completing his work as a war artist for the Canadian War Memorials Fund (1917&#150;19). In 1932 he executed his last plate, <span class="italic">The Broken Crucifix</span>, seen by many as a poignant reminder of his wife's suffering before her death from cancer on 17 November 1931. They were a devoted couple; although he survived her by nearly fourteen years, he never got over her death.<br>
<br>Cameron did not display the immediate brilliance which characterized the work of Bone and McBey. It took several years of steady development for him to reach a position of mastery in terms of technique and composition. His early etchings, which include the <span class="roman">Paisley Set</span> (1887) and the <span class="roman">Clyde Set</span> (1889), are little more than views, somewhat lacking in individuality of expression but occasionally displaying a hint of what was to come. 1892 marks a greater maturity, evidenced by several etchings in the <span class="roman">North Holland Set</span> and <span class="italic">A Rembrandt Farm</span>, which signals his lifelong admiration of the great Dutch master. Other early influences were Maxime Lalanne, Haden, Whistler, and the French etcher Charles Meryon.<br>
<br>From 1892, when he visited the Netherlands with the Glasgow photographer James Craig Annan, to the winter of 1908&#150;9, when he visited Egypt, Cameron travelled regularly on the continent. Often his travels were followed by the issue of a set of etchings. The <span class="roman">North Holland Set</span> (1892) was followed by the <span class="roman">North Italian Set</span> (1896), the <span class="roman">Paris Set</span> (1904), and the <span class="roman">Belgian Set</span> (1907). The <span class="roman">London Set</span> was issued in 1900, following a move to London in 1898. However, after a year the Camerons returned to Scotland, to Kippen, Stirlingshire, where they built a house, Dun Eaglais, in which they lived for the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>Cameron developed great skill in the depiction of architectural subjects, conveying not only the beauty of a building but also something of its history and &#145;soul&#146;. A master of detail and mood, of light and shadow, his notable plates include <span class="italic">Newgate</span> (1899), <span class="italic">Siena</span> (1900), <span class="italic">Place Plumereau, Tours</span> (1903), and <span class="italic">Thermae of Caracalla</span> (1923). He executed several atmospheric church interiors, such as <span class="italic">St Laumer, Blois</span> (1903) and <span class="italic">Notre Dame, Dinant</span> (1907) and culminating in <span class="italic">The Five Sisters, York Minster</span> (1907), arguably his finest print. He had an acute sense of design in terms of structure, tone, and balance, which is particularly evident in his landscapes. Fine early examples include <span class="italic">Landscape with Trees</span> (1892), <span class="italic">A Border Tower</span> (1894), and <span class="italic">The Meuse</span> (1907). From 1911 onward he produced a series of plates depicting the Scottish landscape, for which he is rightly renowned. They are noted for their simple design and wonderful quality of line, exemplified by prints such as the masterly <span class="italic">Ben Ledi</span> (1911), <span class="italic">Ben Lomond</span> (1923), and <span class="italic">Balquhidder</span> (1931).<br>
<br>In his painting in oil and watercolours Cameron executed mainly figure subjects and portraits until 1900. Stylistically they have an affinity with the later decorative phase of the Glasgow Boys or with Hague school painters such as Matthijs Maris. However, he was never entirely happy in his representation of the human form. Some of his figure paintings, such as his portrait <span class="italic">Dorothy Maude Kay</span> (1898, priv. coll.), and his busy harbour scenes, are successful, but others are less so. In 1899 the London dealer Colnaghi mounted an ambitious one-man exhibition, but it was not as successful as Cameron might have wished. Henceforth he concentrated on architectural subjects and landscapes.<br>
<br>During the first decade of the twentieth century Cameron's subjects were drawn from the landscapes and townscapes of the continent as well as from Scotland. <span class="italic">Early Spring in Tuscany</span> (<i>c</i>.1901), <span class="italic">Dark Angers</span> (1903, Manchester City Galleries), <span class="italic">Glencaple</span> (1905, National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), <span class="italic">Nightfall, Luxor</span> (1909, Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), <span class="italic">Craigievar</span> (1909, Aberdeen Art Gallery), <span class="italic">The Marble Quarry, Iona</span> (1909, Cartwright Hall, Bradford), and <span class="italic">Old Paris</span> (<i>c</i>.1910, priv. coll., London) are some fine examples. From 1910 to about 1916 he concentrated on Scottish landscape. By 1910 he had developed an individual landscape style, which was to change little over the next thirty-five years, though his palette went through a number of phases, ranging from sombre browns, greys, and black to unrestrained blue, plum, pink, gold, and red. He used a strong line to build up the structure of a landscape and accentuated mass and tonal relationships. He tended to eliminate everything trivial or inconsequential, which gave many of his landscapes an austere beauty. His intense love and feeling for Scotland and its scenery are immediately apparent in works such as <span class="italic">The Boddin, Angus</span> (<i>c</i>.1911, priv. coll., London), <span class="italic">Cir Mhor</span> (1912, Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum), <span class="italic">The Hill of the Winds</span> (<i>c</i>.1913, National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), and <span class="italic">Balquhidder</span> (<i>c</i>.1916, Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle upon Tyne). About 1916 Cameron began a series of architectural studies, including several powerful church interiors, exemplified by <span class="italic">Caf&eacute; Leroux</span> (1918, priv. coll.), <span class="italic">Durham</span> (1920, Royal Academy), and <span class="italic">The Baths of Caracalla</span> (1924, Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston). His work as a war artist includes <span class="italic">The Battlefield of Ypres</span> (1919, Imperial War Museum, London), <span class="italic">Bailleul</span> (<i>c</i>.1919, Central Museum and Art Gallery, Dundee), and <span class="italic">A Garment of War</span> (<i>c</i>.1926, City Art Centre, Edinburgh).<br>
<br>In the 1920s and 1930s D. Y., as Cameron preferred to be called, was one of the best-known painters in England as well as Scotland. His work received great critical acclaim and was acquired by many public galleries in Britain and abroad. He was an academician of both the Royal Scottish Academy (1918) and the Royal Academy (1920), a member of the Scottish (1906) and English (1915) watercolour societies and the International Society (1901), and a founder member of the Society of Twelve (1904).<br>
<br>Following a heart attack in August 1921, Cameron went to the south of France to recuperate. Influenced by the region's intensity of light, he produced on this and subsequent visits a body of work&#151;imbued with the most vibrant colour he had used thus far&#151;which must rank among his best. Typical examples are <span class="italic">La rue Annette</span> (<i>c</i>.1922, National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), <span class="italic">Barlou</span> (<i>c</i>.1922, priv. coll.), and <span class="italic">En Provence</span> (<i>c</i>.1926, National Gallery of Scotland). This use of rich colour was continued in his later Scottish landscapes, of which <span class="italic">Wilds of Assynt</span> (1936, Perth Museum and Art Gallery) is a fine example. At times he appears guilty of exaggeration, but, to those who know the Scottish highlands well, reality bears out his extraordinary vision of colour and setting.<br>
<br>In the latter part of his career Cameron's importance and influence in British art circles extended far beyond the boundaries of the studio. Between 1919 and 1945 he was associated with the British School at Rome, which he visited several times in the 1920s. In 1925 the speaker of the House of Commons asked him to choose and lead a group of eight painters for the decoration of St Stephen's Hall at Westminster. He played a similar role from 1927 to 1938 when the Bank of England was rebuilt. He served as a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission and was a trustee of the Tate Gallery (1920&#150;27) and the National Galleries of Scotland (1920&#150;45). He was knighted in 1924 and in 1933 was appointed the king's painter and limner in Scotland. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Glasgow (1911), Manchester (1923), Cambridge (1928), and St Andrews (1936).<br>
<br>Cameron was a squarish man of under medium height with blond hair and blue eyes. He did not look like an artist; his upbringing as a son of the manse was reflected in his preference for dark clothes. He was a man of firm convictions. The church was a very important element throughout his life and had a considerable influence on his art, especially in his later years. He was just as eloquent in his ardent appeals for a greater recognition of the arts by the Church of Scotland as he was in the interest of fine art. He gave advice to individual congregations on the redecoration of their churches and with Lady Cameron gave much time and many of their collected treasures and essential funding towards the renovation and decoration of their own church at Kippen. He also advised on the design of war memorials following the First World War. At the age of eighty, still carrying banners for art and for the church, he died of a heart attack on 16 September 1945, shortly after delivering a lecture, &#145;Beauty and worship&#146;, at St John's Kirk in Perth. Three days later he was buried beside Lady Cameron in the churchyard outside Kippen, overlooking his beloved Ben Ledi, which he painted many times.<br>
<br>Cameron was not a trailblazer, but neither was he an imitator. Allied to superb draughtsmanship and technique, he had an individual conception and style, to which he remained true throughout his life. Many of his oils are impressive in their power and drama. However, it is in his watercolours&#151;fresh and spontaneous, rarely mannered or laboured&#151;and in his etchings and dry-points that his true ability can be seen.<br>
