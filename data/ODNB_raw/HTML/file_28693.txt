<span class="headword">Ward,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Zion Ward]</span>  (1781&#150;1837), <span class="occ">founder of the Shilohites</span>, was born at the Cove of Cork in Ireland on 25 December 1781. Taken by his parents, who were strict Calvinists, to Bristol in July 1790, he was for three years apprenticed to a shipwright and fell into bad company. Following his father to London, where he learned shoemaking with his brother, he then entered the navy, serving as a shipwright on board the <i>Blanche</i>, a man-of-war, seeing action at the battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The sense of guilt and fear of death and judgment which he had known as a child now increased, and in 1803 he secured his discharge at Sheerness. He married a pious girl and worked as a shoemaker, the family moving to Carmarthen for three years, where he became disillusioned with Methodism and religion generally. On his return to London he chanced to hear Jeremiah Garrett in Southwark and became a Baptist, though on Garrett's death in 1806 he joined the Independents and later, in 1813, the Sandemanians, for whom he became a preacher.<br>
<br>In 1814 Ward was thrilled to discover what he considered to be an example of inspired prophecy, when he read <span class="italic">The Fifth Book of Wonders</span> by Joanna Southcott, who had just died, and for a while he rejoined and preached for the Methodists, but they rejected his enthusiasm for &#145;the pure Word of Joanna&#146;. He then, in turn, was associated with two claimants to Joanna's mantle, first George Turner (who died in 1821) and then in 1825 the illiterate Mary Boon of Staverton, Devon, becoming the reader of her letters to her London followers and later acting as her secretary. However, in 1826, the year from which his followers came to reckon their beginning of time, Ward started to see himself as a prophetic leader. A series of dreams and visions convinced him that he himself was Shiloh, the Promised One, he, indeed, was Jesus Christ, and the biblical prophecies referred to him. His mother's name being Mary and his birthday being on 25 December seemed to confirm this realization. When in 1828 he gave up his work as a shoemaker and began to proclaim his messiahship, his wife decided that he was mad and the local magistrate committed him to the Newington workhouse for six months.<br>
<br>In November 1828 Ward escaped and, with help from Charles William Twort of Walworth&#151;a loyal henchman from then until his death in 1878&#151;Ward began to gather a following, claiming to be &#145;a new man, having a new name&#146;. Sometimes he called himself Shiloh, the name which Joanna Southcott had given to her expected child, but more often he was now known as Zion. His first book, <span class="italic">The Vision of Judgment, or, The Return of Joanna from her Trance</span> (1829), was not well received by the Southcottians, but a series of visits to Nottingham, Chesterfield, Birmingham, Sheffield, and other northern towns produced an encouraging response. It is not clear at what stage he encountered the writings of the radical freethinker Richard Carlile, but when Ward taught that biblical events and characters were not historical but figurative, and that he (Ward) was not just Jesus Christ but also Satan and God as well, there are manifest echoes of some of Carlile's ideas. In addition to such daring suggestions Ward had also adopted a politically radical programme, ferociously castigating the government, landlords, and clergy. &#145;The Archbishop was &#147;His Grease&#148;, the Bishops &#147;canting tricksters&#148;, the clergy &#147;scurvy nincompoops&#148;&#146;  (Balleine, 99). In the context of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> disturbances, this sort of oratory was bound to polarize reactions to his addresses at Borough Chapel, Southwark, and at the Rotunda in Blackfriars Road during 1831. By and large his message appealed to the poorer classes, though he was supported financially by some wealthier patrons, such as the Birmingham manufacturers of tobacco and snuff, Bradley and Holinsworth.<br>
<br>In Derby, on 4 August 1832, Ward and Twort were found guilty of blasphemy (Twort being convicted also of assault) and they were imprisoned for eighteen months in Derby gaol. When, on 15 August, Henry Hunt presented a petition to the House of Commons asking for the release of Ward and Twort, he seized the occasion for a fierce attack on the government. The almost incoherent denunciation of the petition by Spencer Perceval (a pious son of the assassinated prime minister) was probably provoked, at least partially, by Ward having ostentatiously feasted on a leg of mutton on the day appointed by parliament for repentant fasting in the face of the cholera epidemic. Ward's sentence was not mitigated, but the conditions of confinement were comparatively mild.<br>
<br>Released on 3 February 1834, Ward returned briefly to London and then tried to revive the support which he had previously found in many midland and northern chapels, but with little success. The destructive and individualistic elements in his preaching, which had been so topical during the reform crisis, were hardly calculated to nurture or edify congregational life. In January 1835 he moved to Bristol where he gathered a following which included for a while J. P. Greaves and Sophia Chichester, but in October a stroke deprived him of the use of his hands. In spite of a second stroke he could still speak, and began another tour. Lifted onto the platform at meetings, he could still gather a crowd. &#145;The man in the street was impressed by the sight of a preacher, obviously earnest and religious, proclaiming that the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was a fiction, that prayer was useless, that clergymen were liars, and that God did not care whether men did good or evil&#146;  (Balleine, 104). In November 1836 Ward finally settled at Leeds, but suffered a third stroke and died at 91 Park Lane on 12 March 1837. His devoted follower C. B. Holinsworth perpetuated his master's memory in a collection of Ward's writings in seventeen volumes (1899&#150;1904).<br>
