<span class="headword">Howie,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1641<span class="mult">x</span>7), <span class="occ">theologian and college head</span>, was born in Aberdeen, the son of Thomas Howie, a merchant burgess. After early education at the grammar school of New Aberdeen he entered King's College, University of Aberdeen, from which he graduated MA, probably in 1584. Along with his fellow student John Johnston (<i>c</i>.1565&#150;1611) he matriculated at the University of Rostock, in what is now Germany, in August 1584. A year later Howie went to the newly founded <i>Hochschule</i>, or <i>Gymnasium Illustre</i>, in Herborn to study theology under the reformed theologian Caspar Olivian, and biblical languages and exegesis under Johannes Piscator. Both scholars made a profound impression on the young man, which was most evident in his adoption and subsequent exposition of covenant or federal theology. With the help of Johannes Pincier, professor of medicine, he also edited from the manuscript, which he had brought with him from Aberdeen, George Buchanan's unfinished <span class="italic">Sphaera</span>, published in Herborn in 1586 by Corvinus.<br>
<br>In May 1588 Howie matriculated at the University of Basel, where before the end of the month he was exhibiting his ability in theology by publicly defending theses set out by J. J. Grynaeus. In subsequent years he did so regularly. In addition, in 1590 he provided theses for disputations in which others were the respondents. In the following year he published a short but important tractate entitled <span class="italic">De reconciliatione hominis cum Deo</span>, his only printed theological work. Early in 1591 Howie, reunited with his friend Johnston, set out for Scotland. On 31 October Howie was appointed assistant to David Cunningham, the senior minister of Aberdeen, and in 1592 he became one of the ministers of the city. At this time Howie supported the officially recognized presbyterian form of church government set out in the act of parliament of June 1592. In 1593 he was the obvious local choice for the principalship of the newly founded Marischal College in New Aberdeen, and to him must be given much of the credit for the successful launching of this new academic venture, which mirrored so much that had happened in Germany and in protestant areas of France. Along with his teaching responsibilities in philosophy&#151;not theology, which he would have preferred&#151;he continued to exercise his pastoral ministry and to take his place in the courts of the church. Both his ministry and his diligence on behalf of the college won him popular public and civic recognition and in 1597 he was so highly thought of that he was invited to become one of the ministers of Edinburgh. He declined, but in 1598 accepted election by the general assembly as minister of Dundee.<br>
<br>By 1597, however, Howie had begun to change his views on church government, in particular on what he had previously branded, when writing of the Church of England to friends on the continent, as &#145;the tyranny of pseudo-bishops&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Johnston and Howie</span>, 310, l. 24). From 1598 to 1605 he aligned himself with the royal policy of extending episcopal power in the church. At the same time he began to take a leading part, if not, according to his opponents, the leading part, on behalf of the city's guilds, in an attempt to reform the civic administration of Dundee. His opponents declared him to be a man of a hot and vehement humour and of a contentious disposition who had put himself at the head of a faction. In 1604 he resisted attempts of the ecclesiastical provincial synod to discipline him for his political activity, or, as many supposed, to depose him from the ministry. Disregarding prohibitions from the privy council, he travelled widely, even to London, on behalf of the reform party among the citizens. Finally the privy council, maintaining him to be the author and fountain of the disordered state of the burgh, in July 1605 forbade him from performing any public function and excluded him from living in Dundee for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Howie was translated to the parish of Keith in Banffshire in 1606, and was appointed constant moderator of the local presbytery. Removal from Dundee did not, however, lead to his exclusion from ecclesiastical events: within a year he had recovered favour. In September 1606 he attended a meeting in Hampton Court summoned by the king to discuss the ecclesiastical affairs of Scotland. Howie was now unmistakably on the side of the bishops and had no hesitation in condemning those presbyterian ministers who had attempted to thwart royal policy. On 9 March 1607 the king chose Howie, &#145;a most meitt and sufficient person, both in respect of his lyf and literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Johnston and Howie</span>, 352, l. 13f.), as a permanent replacement for the ejected presbyterian leader Andrew Melville, as principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews. At first Howie refused to accept the office, concerned that the royal commissioners visiting the university had, contrary to the king's instructions, made the appointment dependent on the king's pleasure. The privy council peremptorily ordered him to accept, which he was obliged to do. However, he petitioned the king in August and craved full and formal confirmation. He claimed that he was devoted to the task set before him, but acknowledged that it was &#145;a wark full of difficultie and invy&#146; and that he had been committed to &#145;the hazard of most violent tempestis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Johnston and Howie</span>, 326f.).<br>
<br>Howie, inducted on 27 July 1607, could not have relished being made the successor to Andrew Melville in what had been one of the bulwarks of the presbyterian polity, nor could he have found much satisfaction in being placed over the head of his former close friend and student companion John Johnston, who since 1591 had been second master in the college and had expected to succeed Melville. However, Howie did not take the oath of office until 15 March 1611, by which time Johnston was terminally ill. Howie's open defence of the superiority of bishops over presbyteries was resented by many in St Andrews, but he was not deterred from supporting the royal ecclesiastical policy. In 1610 he was appointed to the court of high commission and was in that year a member of the general assembly held in Glasgow at which the presbyterian polity of the church was effectively curtailed and the episcopal office restored.<br>
<br>From 1610 to 1638 Howie regularly attended the courts of the church and was frequently made a member of commissions charged with carrying through a variety of matters furthering the royal policy. Such action displeased many. At the general assembly in Montrose in 1616 he was appointed one of the revisers, and has subsequently been regarded as one of the principal authors of a new confession of faith, which reflects the contemporary reformed orthodoxy and in its teaching on the sacrament of the Lord's supper is in line with Howie's manuscript work, &#145;Accuratus de coenae domini tractatus&#146;  (St Andrews University Library, MSS BV 8 24 H7).<br>
<br>Howie also took a prominent part in both the general administration of St Andrews University, for a time as rector, and in furthering a number of changes which the new chancellor, Archbishop George Gledstanes, pandering to the king, wished to bring about. One of the most significant of these was the creation of a common university library, another was the revival of formal graduation ceremonies, and in particular the awarding of doctorates in divinity &#145;to encourage our ignorant cleargie in learning&#146;  (Cant, 68f.). As dean of the faculty of divinity and principal of the theological college, Howie, along with the heads of the other two colleges, was made a DD at a ceremony held on 29 July 1616 directed by the king's emissary, John Young, dean of Winchester. The royal confidence in Howie was reflected in the king's plans to have St Andrews as &#145;the principall fountayne of religion and good letters in Scotland&#146;  (Cant, 70f.). On demitting office as rector he delivered an <i>oratio</i>, &#145;De fundatoribus academiae et collegiorum in universitate Andreapolitana&#146; (1617), which has to be seen as the earliest attempt to sketch the history and development of the university. For King James's visit to St Andrews in July of that year Howie's primary official duty was to act as the president at a theological disputation held in the king's honour, for which he provided theses setting out the royal power in matters ecclesiastical.<br>
<br>Howie's success as principal is reflected in steady matriculations and significant numbers of visiting students from the continent. His level of commitment, to St Mary's College in particular, is seen in the administrative documents in his own hand. To Howie must also be given full credit for gracefully remodelling the buildings of his college to which he added an &#145;attractively arcaded north building&#146;  (Cant, 77). Although this was removed in the nineteenth century there is built into the east frontage of the west building a fine carving of Howie's coat of arms, his monogram, and the date 1621, when the rebuilding took place.<br>
<br>In 1618 Howie was one of a royal commission appointed to carry out a visitation of the Aberdeen colleges, which led to the revitalization of university education there by Bishop Patrick Forbes. In 1624 provision for a chair of divinity at Marischal College was offered by Patrick Copland, one of Howie's former students there and a staunch upholder of reformed orthodoxy. Efforts were made at this time both by Copland and the town council to recall Howie to Aberdeen, but he decided to remain in St Andrews.<br>
<br>As Charles I's ecclesiastical policy in Scotland unfolded Howie's ardour for episcopacy began to cool, as did that of his three university colleagues. He went along with the decision of the general assembly in Glasgow in 1638 to rid the church of bishops and he himself signed the covenant and remained in his office as principal of St Mary's College, but following complaints in 1641 from Samuel Rutherford, then professor of divinity, over misappropriation of funds, Howie was forced to resign. When Howie's demission came before the general assembly for confirmation, Alexander Henderson, the prime architect of the national covenant and one of the leaders of the presbyterian cause, described as Howie's &#145;good friend&#146;, acted with commendable charity. He so guided the matter that &#145;with ane great deall of commendation to the old man, &hellip; it was voyced that his dismission should be rendered to him [and] that he should all his life tyme enjoy his full rent and honour, without any diminution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.361).<br>
<br>Howie died without leaving a will some time between 1641 and 1647. The disposal of his &#145;guids and geir&#146; was registered on 25 September 1652. He had married, probably while he was still in Aberdeen at Marischal College, Jean Skene, daughter of Andrew Skene of Anchorie, a burgess of Aberdeen in 1598, who predeceased him. He was survived by his eldest son, Robert, who had been made a burgess of Aberdeen on 11 August 1624, and a daughter, Margaret, who married Andrew Lamont, a former St Andrews student and subsequently minister at Markinch, Fife.<br>
