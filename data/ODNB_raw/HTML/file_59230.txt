<span class="headword">Grey <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Whitbread]</span>,  Mary</span>, Lady Grey  (1770&#150;1858), <span class="occ">promoter of seafarers' missions</span>, was born in December 1770, daughter of the famous brewer and Christian philanthropist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/39057/', "Samuel Whitbread (1720&#150;1796)")</script> of Bedwell Park, Hertfordshire, and his second wife, Lady Mary Cornwallis (<i>d</i>. 1770), sister of Lord Cornwallis of India. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29231/', "Samuel Whitbread (1764&#150;1815)")</script>, whig politician, was her half-brother. Following her mother's death in childbirth, she was carefully brought up by her fifty-year-old father in the spirit of practical piety which both parents had shared. On 18 June 1795 she married Captain George Grey RN (1767&#150;1828), of historic border stock from north Northumberland. In 1798, after three years of repeated farewells in the midst of naval warfare with France, she decided to sail out with her husband to his base at Gibraltar. Witnesses commented on her calmness and fortitude under enemy fire, qualities which would stand her in good stead during bouts of public criticism for religious activism in years to come. It was also here that she gave birth to her first son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11533/', "George Grey (1799&#150;1882)")</script>, the future statesman.<br>
<br>After serving with distinction during actions at sea for several years Captain Grey was, in 1806, appointed commissioner of the naval dockyard in Portsmouth. In 1814 he was made a baronet in recognition of his services to his country. He continued in his appointment in Portsmouth until his death.<br>
<br>Even before her own invaluable wartime sea experience, Lady Grey had, as a girl, been employed by her father in reading and copying materials collected by his friend the abolitionist Thomas Clarkson, documenting the abuse of both &#145;cargo&#146; and crew in the &#145;Torrid Trade&#146; with west Africa. In Portsmouth she showed constant concern for the welfare of dockyard workers and their families, sick sailors, and sailors' orphans. Beyond local needs, her husband's situation also gave her the opportunity to pursue a vision of global dimensions. The 22-year duration of Sir George Grey's dockyard duties, coinciding as it did with the transition of Britain's maritime focus from men-of-war to merchant shipping, fell at the beginning of the so-called seafarers' mission movement. Lady Grey, with the willing co-operation of her like-minded husband, was able to transform the commissioner's house in Portsmouth Dockyard into a centre for the incipient seafarers' mission.<br>
<br>Lady Grey launched, and for two decades maintained, a campaign of systematic circulation of immense quantities of the scriptures and Christian literature among virtually every category of seafarers&#151;naval personnel, merchant seafarers, fishers, embarking soldiers, and convicts. In this entirely new area of missionary endeavour the Naval and Military Bible Society, British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS), and Religious Tract Society all claimed her among their most valued collaborators. As Portsmouth correspondent of the BFBS alone, she is recorded as having distributed 28,201 scripture copies among maritime recipients between 1810 and 1815. Of her tenacity and zeal in this field, the many letters from her hand in the BFBS Home Correspondence files bear telling testimony.<br>
<br>Lady Grey had, in the words of one obituarist, mastered &#145;the art of laying under contribution the talents of others&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Record</span>, 26 May 1858). Thus, she made a special point of prevailing on officers leaving for sea &#145;to attend to the welfare of their own immortal souls, and to seek the spiritual good of their ship's company&#146;  (ibid.). One such officer could later report how one appreciative &#145;tar&#146; had told another, on hearing about &#145;the Commissioner's Lady&#146; as the source of &#145;all these pretty books&#146; they had received: &#145;God bless her, &hellip; if we don't go to heaven [after this] we ought to be ashamed of ourselves&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Sailor's Magazine</span>, 1828, 271&#150;2).<br>
<br>Perhaps the most striking example of Lady Grey's intuitive ability to select and support co-workers in the cause was her early contact with Revd George Charles Smith, internationally recognized as the founder of organized mission to seafarers. Bosun Smith, as he came to be called, began his pioneer role by initiating in 1809 a pastoral ministry among the scores of <span class="roman">Bible</span>-studying cell-groups then emerging on ships of the British wartime navy. The success of this so-called &#145;naval correspondence mission&#146; has since been identified as crucial to the subsequent proliferation of organizations for seafarers' mission worldwide. Smith himself recorded his indebtedness to Lady Grey for her unstinted support of this venture at its most critical juncture, providing both sorely needed funding and vital assistance in making contacts.<br>
<br>The death of Sir George Grey in 1828, and his wife's consequent removal from their Portsmouth residence, resulted in a reduction in her maritime-related activity, but not in overall missionary involvement, whether at home or abroad. Among her major concerns continued to be missions in Ireland, especially along the rugged coast of Connemara. Active close to the end of her long life, she died at her home, 14 Eaton Place, Pimlico, London, on 9 May 1858. She was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>Lady Mary Grey was not the founding figure in the seafarers' mission movement, but she is the earliest woman known to have made a major contribution in the field. Despite the cultural constraints with which women working in the public arena had to contend at that time, available evidence clearly shows that her effective strategies and unflagging zeal played a decisive role in the promotion of nascent seafarers' missions through the first quarter of the nineteenth century, during the movement's early evolution from distribution of literature to more comprehensive models. It would not be too much to say that Lady Mary Grey left no less a legacy in the cause of maritime mission than her equally indomitable predecessor, Selina Hastings, countess of Huntingdon, left in the cause of mission in general. In essence, Lady Grey was the Lady Huntingdon of seafarers' mission.<br>
