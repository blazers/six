<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Trease,  (Robert) Geoffrey</span>  (1909&#150;1998), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born in Nottingham on 11 August 1909, the third son and youngest child of George Albert Trease (1873&#150;1932), a wine merchant, and his wife, Florence Dale (1874&#150;1955), a doctor's daughter. He won a scholarship to Nottingham high school, where he edited magazines, wrote a play produced by the school dramatic society, and published at his own expense a slim book of poems which, by his own account, sold virtually no copies. He won a classics scholarship to Queen's College, Oxford, but after &#145;one year of Oxford at its dryest, unrelieved by one flash of inspiration, humour or understanding from any don concerned with me&#146;, went down without a degree  (Trease, <span class="italic">Whiff of Burnt Boats</span>, 101). After social work in the East End, from which he emerged with strong left-wing convictions, he scraped a living for two years from Grub Street literary work, falling back in the end on private school teaching. Here he met Marian Haselden Granger Boyer (1906&#150;1989), a fellow teacher, and they were married on 11 August 1933, his twenty-fourth birthday: a marriage which lasted until her death fifty-six years later. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>Without money or prospects, but still intent on a literary career, Trease struggled on, pouring out articles and short stories at a guinea or so a time. The turning point was when he came across a book translated from the Russian, <span class="italic">Moscow has a Plan</span>, in which a Soviet author dramatized the first five-year plan for the benefit of young readers. Trease had not thought of writing for children, but it now struck him that the boys' adventure stories of his day were still reflecting a vanished world of imperialism and unquestioned privilege. Why not a book for children with a proletarian hero and a left-wing message? The idea was put to a Marxist publisher, Martin Lawrence, who immediately offered him a contract; the result was <span class="italic">Bows Against the Barons</span> (1934), a Robin Hood story meant to show the seamy side of merrie England, with Robin as a champion of the poor.<br>
<br>Although Trease was to write over 100 more books, mostly historical novels for young readers, this was probably the most significant, not only in determining his future career but also in its effect on children's books. It stimulated a growing demand for down-to-earth realism, and its dialogue, in plain contemporary English, helped to do away with the &#145;gadzookery&#146; that had traditionally characterized historical fiction for the young.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Bows Against the Barons</span> sold in vast numbers in a Russian translation, and produced a sum in blocked roubles that enabled Trease and Marian to spend five months in the Soviet Union. It was followed by a second &#145;proletarian&#146; novel, <span class="italic">Comrades for the Charter</span> (1935), and, among much other writing, a play, <span class="italic">Colony</span>, performed at the left-wing Unity Theatre on the eve of the Second World War. None the less, Trease was gradually getting the propagandist urge out of his system, and there was little trace of it in <span class="italic">Cue for Treason</span> (1940), which was about a company of strolling players in Shakespeare's day and featured a plot against the first Queen Elizabeth. This was probably his most popular book and was to stay in print for many years.<br>
<br>After wartime service in the army education corps, Trease continued mainly to write historical fiction for children. He did not like to be thought of as only a children's writer, however, and produced a handful of adult novels, which had modest success, as well as plays for stage and radio. A study of children's books, <span class="italic">Tales out of School</span> (1949; revised in 1964), made a powerful impact. In it, besides pillorying some outdated attitudes, Trease insisted on the cultural importance of children's literature and urged authors, publishers, and the public to take it seriously. He believed, not unreasonably, that this book helped to bring about the rise in the quality and standing of children's literature which took place over succeeding decades. He himself continued steadily at work and gradually progressed from restless young pioneer to grand old man, becoming the unquestioned doyen of British children's writers. But as the years went by, commentators found newer and younger writers more exciting. Trease's imagination, though serviceable, did not soar. His stories were planted firmly on the ground. He never went in for fantasy, and his evocations of the past did not achieve the intensity of Rosemary Sutcliff or the brilliance of Leon Garfield. But he went on writing and his books continued to sell.<br>
<br>Trease worked indefatigably for his profession. He was the first chairman of the Society of Authors children's writers group, was prominent in the campaign to end outright payment for copyright, and was chairman of the society's management committee in 1972&#150;3. In 1979 he became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He was unfailingly helpful to aspiring writers, and at Colwall, in the Malvern Hills, where he and his wife lived for many years, he was a mainstay of the local writers' circle. He had a lasting interest in Russia and in the theatre, and one of his last novels, <span class="italic">Shadow under the Sea</span> (1990), was set in the Crimean coastal resort of Yalta in the brief period of Gorbachov's supremacy. Late in life, to be near his daughter, he moved to Yomede Park, Newbridge Road, Bath, where he died on 27 January 1998.<br>
