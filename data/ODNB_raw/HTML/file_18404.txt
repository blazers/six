<span class="headword">Maxwell,  John</span>, earl of Morton  (1553&#150;1593), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was born on 24 April 1553, the posthumous second son of Robert, sixth Lord Maxwell (<i>d</i>. 1552), and Beatrix (<i>d</i>. in or after 1583), second daughter of James Douglas, third earl of Morton. His father having died on the previous 13 September John Maxwell was raised by his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18403/', "Sir John Maxwell")</script> of Terregles, the future fourth Lord Herries.<h2>
<a name="SupporterofQueenMary"></a>Supporter of Queen Mary</h2>On the death of his elder brother, Robert, on 16 January 1555, Maxwell inherited the family properties of Maxwell and Caerlaverock, and the bailieries of Sweetheart, Dundrennan, Holywood, and Lincluden. His early devotion to Mary, queen of Scots, alarmed the English ambassador Thomas Randolph, who in a statement of May 1565 (which may in fact refer to Herries) observed that Maxwell &#145;weighs more his mistress's will than her danger&#146;, being &#145;loth to attempt against her mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1563&#150;9</i>, 169). After Mary's demission of the crown on 24 July 1568 in favour of her son, James, Maxwell joined twenty-four other disaffected nobles on the 30th in writing to the duke of Alva, the governor of the Netherlands, asking for money, thereby establishing his first contacts with Spain. In July 1569 he attended the Perth convention, voting in favour of Mary's divorce from Bothwell. Following Regent Moray's assassination on 21 January 1570, Elizabeth instructed her west march warden, Henry, Baron Scrope, to ravage Maxwell's lands in Dumfriesshire, on the grounds of his association with the English rebel Leonard Dacre. The real purpose of the sustained attacks was to prevent Maxwell and Herries from taking Edinburgh on Mary's behalf. After a pause Scrope renewed his raids and between 22 and 28 August 1570 he demolished Lord Maxwell's principal strongholds, including his castles at Dumfries.<br>
<br>Maxwell and Herries could not prevent Regent Lennox from occupying Paisley, in early 1571, but they allied themselves with Sir John Gordon of Lochinvar and marched on Edinburgh on 14 April. After taking the capital for the queen, Maxwell attended the queen's parliament of 12 June 1571. By 20 November his kinsmen had signed an unusual bond of manrent, pledging both their support for, and confidence in, their young leader. On 17 February 1572, however, Maxwell married Elizabeth Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1637), youngest sister of the eighth earl of Angus, and in so doing was thought &#145;to acknowledge the kingis auctoritie&#146;, indicating an apparent swing in loyalties  (Thomson, <span class="italic">Diurnal</span>, 259). They had seven children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18405/', "John Maxwell, later ninth Lord Maxwell")</script>; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67520/', "Robert Maxwell, created first earl of Nithsdale")</script> in 1620; James of Kirkconnel; Elizabeth, wife of John, sixth Lord Herries; Margaret, wife of John Wallace of Craigie; Jean; and Agnes, who married her brother John's supporter William Douglas of Greenlaw.<h2>
<a name="Wardenofthewestmarch"></a>Warden of the west march</h2>Maxwell proved outwardly amenable to the triumphant king's party under Morton, whom he personally helped to select in a special convention of earls and lords in November 1572. Having attended the king's parliament (of 30 April 1573), only weeks before the fall of Edinburgh Castle, Maxwell was confirmed in possession of Lochmaben Castle on 26 October and appointed warden of the west march. In that office he proved remarkably conscientious. He complained to the general assembly about the poor condition of the kirks of Annandale and Nithsdale in March 1574 and amazed Scrope with his judicious administration. In November 1576 Maxwell delivered forty-two bills at a single border truce day, leading the English warden to enthuse that &#145;the like example of justice done in one day has not been seen or heard of in these borders&#146;  (Fraser, 1.231). Even so, Maxwell found it difficult to secure the support of the lieges of Dumfries, and on 12 December that year Morton arranged to enforce an act of 1564 requiring all nobles and property holders to attend the warden at truce days. Relations between Maxwell and the regent had up to this time been cordial (Morton hosted Maxwell's wedding celebrations at Dalkeith Palace), even though Morton suspected that Maxwell would attempt to press a claim to the earldom of Morton derived from his mother. On 25 May 1577, however, a disagreement between them led to Maxwell's resignation as warden and his replacement by his brother-in-law, the eighth earl of Angus. Warded at Edinburgh in July, and removed to St Andrews in September, Maxwell finally obtained his release on the regent's resignation in early March 1578, and on the 25th he was reappointed warden. In June he attempted to block Morton's recovery of power by voting against his membership of the king's council, and, when that failed, questioned the legitimacy of the parliament held at Stirling in July. Raising a force of 7000 men with the earls of Argyll and Erroll, Maxwell engaged to free the king from Morton's &#145;captivity&#146;, but was prevented by the army of 5000 raised by Angus and the last-minute arbitration of the English ambassador Robert Bowes. On 23 January 1579 Herries replaced Maxwell as warden, leading to tension between the kinsmen and Maxwell's refusal to surrender Lochmaben Castle. With Morton now back in power, Maxwell found caution to ward himself in Dundee (on 13 July 1579) and Blackness (on 27 October); he was finally released in December. By this time he was regarded as a political firebrand, widely trusted neither by the Morton regime nor by the English.<br>
<br>Maxwell inherited a conflict with John Johnstone, laird of Johnstone, which was worsened by the latter's appointment as march warden on 24 August 1579. Their rivalry protracted a bloody struggle for regional dominance that had lasted since at least the 1520s and which had reduced Dumfriesshire to a well-nigh permanent state of war; latterly the feud between the two families had been intensified by the participation of client surnames such as the Irvines and Armstrongs. On 4 May 1580 Maxwell was forced to appear before the privy council for withholding vital bills and scrolls which Johnstone required in order to conduct truce days with Scrope. On 2 September each signed an assurance of responsibility for the continuing good behaviour of his family members and retainers. However, his developing friendship with the king's new favourite, Esm&eacute; Stewart, earl (later duke) of Lennox, led to Maxwell's nomination as an extraordinary gentleman of the king's chamber on 24 October. As early as December he and Herries undertook to pacify the west marches, an assertion of their family's power and also a direct insult to Morton's nominee Johnstone, who relinquished his wardenship to Maxwell in April 1581.<h2>
<a name="Catholicearl"></a>Catholic earl</h2>On 5 June 1581, only four days after sitting on the assize that condemned Morton for his alleged involvement in Darnley's assassination, Maxwell was granted the regent's forfeited estates as a free earldom and regality, though the lands of Aberdour, Dalkeith, and Caldercleir were reserved to his ally Lennox. On 29 October Maxwell was officially created earl of Morton and Lord Carlyle and Eskdaill. He secured his new properties by parliamentary ratification on 28&#150;9 November 1581. Controversy followed when he criticized Scrope's refusal to punish Englishmen who took part in burning Langholm Castle and abducting its captain Herbert Maxwell in September, and threatened &#145;to revenge yt with burninge in like maner in England&#146;  (Bain, 1.77). Following the Ruthven raid of August 1582, Lennox was removed from power and his friend Maxwell was again ousted as warden on 19 November, ostensibly for his inability to control his Armstrong and Graham adherents in Ettrick Forest; Maxwell was succeeded once more by Johnstone. His political influence suffered serious setbacks when he failed to capture Edinburgh and Holyrood castles with Lennox on 30 November, and when Herries, his mentor and chief adviser, died on 20 January 1583. Hopeful of gaining support from the continental Catholic powers, Maxwell left for France in late May. He was back in Scotland by 4 September, having landed at Pittenweem with a store of gold and correspondence, carefully observed by English authorities, who now considered him one of the &#145;chief countenancers&#146; of Border malefactors  (ibid., 111).<br>
<br>By 1585 Maxwell's Roman Catholic sympathies had become obvious. His formal conversion in that year probably owed something to the influence of his cousin William Maxwell, fifth Lord Herries, who had converted by 1584, as well as to his own travels in Europe. He may also have been moved by political considerations, since in January 1585 he broke with James Stewart, earl of Arran, who had been in control of government since the previous summer, in dispute over the Maxwell territories of Pollok and Maxwellhaugh. Arran subsequently (on 29 January 1586) revoked the attainder on the earldom of Morton with a view to bestowing it upon Angus, a move that seriously threatened the claim by Maxwell. The latter was himself outlawed for a series of minor offences against Warden Johnstone on 26 February, and was ordered to surrender the keys of his houses to the king on 10 March. In response to an earlier Johnstone raid, Maxwell's retainers Robert Maxwell of Castlemilk and David Maxwell led a troop of 120 men to destroy Johnstone's chief residence at Lochwood on 6 April 1585. These hostile measures against the absent warden precipitated Maxwell's enforced surrender of the earldom of Morton on 10 April. Undeterred, he continued his attack on Johnstone's interests in Dumfriesshire, invading Lockerbie on 27 April, seizing two fortified stone houses within the town on 7 May, and finally capturing Johnstone himself on 21 August. Although superficially reconciled with Arran, on 1 November Maxwell joined Angus and the banished earl of Mar and master of Glamis in expelling Arran from Stirling Castle, having assembled 1300 foot soldiers and 700 horse for the expedition. Maxwell's supporters were particularly exuberant in pillaging the burgh's public buildings, with a &#145;great reaf of horsse and guidis&#146; being seized by Kinmont Willie Armstrong and his sons  (Moysie, 54). The subsequent political revolution caused by Arran's defeat was a personal triumph for Maxwell on all fronts: on 18 November he was reappointed warden, and he sat in parliament at Linlithgow as earl of Morton in December, when he was also granted a retroactive indemnity excusing all acts committed since April 1569. But the fact that he was discovered celebrating Christmas mass at both Lincluden College and in his own lodgings at Dumfries suggests that Maxwell misjudged his new ascendancy. After freely accepting trial he was questioned by the king and warded in Edinburgh Castle; his imminent release was announced on 14 February 1586.<h2>
<a name="Exileandreturn"></a>Exile and return</h2>On 13 April 1586 Maxwell provided caution of &pound;1000 to appear before the general assembly and submit to an investigation of his religious life, promising on 14 May to remain within a 4 mile radius of Edinburgh. By 21 August he was once again serving as warden, though his relations with Scrope deteriorated when he demanded the return of a Captain Case who was then an English prisoner; Scrope in turn continued to gather intelligence on Maxwell's suspected papist activities. Yet neither Scrope nor even Sir Francis Walsingham's spy network managed to detect Maxwell's plot with the sixth earl of Huntly and Lord Claud Hamilton to oust James's protestant advisers with the help of troops subsidized by Spain. Maxwell refused to sign the reformed articles presented to him at Dumfries on 16 January 1587 and, owing also to his unequivocally hostile reaction to the execution of Queen Mary on 18 February, was banished by the king on 14 April with instructions not to return without royal warrant. In his absence the Morton earldom was transferred to the earl of Angus by act of parliament on 29 July 1587. On 9 June the west march was entrusted to his cousin, the politically reliable Lord Herries.<br>
<br>Maxwell spent the bulk of his exile in Portugal and Spain, negotiating personally with Philip II over the possibilities of Scotland's deep-water ports being used by the Armada. However, Philip refused to commit himself to overthrowing the Scottish government, wishing instead to destabilize Anglo-Scottish relations and thus distract England from interfering with his policy of reconquest in the United Provinces. In April 1588 a disillusioned Maxwell returned to Scotland without licence, in a bid to launch an insurrection in conjunction with his fellow Catholic nobles. In response the king personally led an expedition against Maxwell, who after a dramatic boat chase was apprehended by Sir William Stewart (the brother of Arran) on 5 May and warded in Blackness in August, before being returned to Stewart's care in September. Maxwell was still lodging &#145;in a burghers house&#146; at Edinburgh on 15 September 1589  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1589&#150;93</i>, 155). He was released in advance of the king's wedding voyage in October, and assigned to replace Sir John Carmichael as warden of the west march, but the appointment did not take effect. Maxwell's subsequent behaviour impressed Bowes, who nevertheless reported in August 1590 that the lord had &#145;retorned to his old papistrie far contrary to his former protestation&#146;, though not in such a way as threatened the king politically  (ibid., 841). Indeed, Maxwell had moderated his conduct, in that although he remained Catholic in faith he became in practice a <i>politique</i>, who never again betrayed the king's interest. He was rewarded by an alliance with Chancellor Maitland and by readmission to the privy council in January 1591. On 9 March Maxwell appeared with the ninth earl of Erroll to subscribe articles on faith before the kirk commissioners of Edinburgh, and he attended parliament at Edinburgh on 6 August. Despite English fears of his dominance on the frontier, he was again made warden of the west march on 28 July, though the king withdrew his &#145;unusually ample justiciary powers&#146; on 19 September 1592 in response to the concerns of the noblemen of Nithsdale and Galloway  (Fraser, 1.287).<h2>
<a name="Defeatanddeath"></a>Defeat and death</h2>Maxwell signed the confession of faith at Edinburgh on 26 January 1593, though this was followed on 2 February by a farcical skirmish with William Douglas over seating arrangements in an Edinburgh kirk: Douglas had succeeded his father as ninth earl of Angus, and also claimed to be earl of Morton. Maxwell had continued to style himself earl, and disputes over the title between rival earls of Morton continued until 1620, when Robert Maxwell was made earl of Nithsdale instead. However, John Maxwell's attention was soon turned elsewhere by his conflict with the Johnstones after the escape from Edinburgh Castle on 10 June 1593 of James Johnstone, who had succeeded his father in June 1587. Maxwell needed little persuading to join with the barons and lairds of the west march against Johnstone as &#145;he loved above all things to be followed&#146;  (Spottiswoode, 2.445&#150;6). He was granted a royal commission to apprehend Johnstone&#151;who had been charged with assisting the first earl of Bothwell in his recent raid on the king&#151;and in early December Maxwell marched on Annandale with 1500 men to engage Johnstone's force of 800. On the 6 December Maxwell himself crossed the River Annan with a detachment of troops, only to find Johnstone on the other side, placed atop a slope with an obvious strategic advantage. The Johnstones charged downhill into Maxwell's army, killing those who could not escape and forcing the remainder to retreat back across the river. Maxwell himself was killed in the rout on Dryfe Sands the following day, though traditions differ as to how and by whom: William Johnstone of Kirkhill, the wife of James Johnstone of Kirkton (who was said to have stabbed him with a set of tower keys), Gideon Murray of Elibank, and the laird of Johnstone himself are all reported as striking him down. One account stresses the savage nature of his death at the hand of the Johnstones, who apparently &#145;did cut af baith his hands, and careit the same with thayme on speir points, as a memorial of his perfidie, and for ostentatioun of ther awin glore&#146;  (Thomson, <span class="italic">James the Sext</span>, 299). Maxwell's body lay unburied until 16 February 1598, when the privy council ordered its interment within twenty days. He was then buried in Lincluden College church, as was his widow, who died in February 1637 after two further marriages.<br>
