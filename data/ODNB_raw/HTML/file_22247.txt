<span class="headword">Pigot,  Hugh</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1769, <em>d.</em> 1797), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was baptized in the parish church of Patshull in Staffordshire on 5 September 1769, the second of the five children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22246/', "Admiral Hugh Pigot (1722&#150;1792)")</script> and his second wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1811), daughter of Sir Richard Wrottesley of Tettenhall, Staffordshire. Pigot entered the navy in May 1782 in the <i>Jupiter</i> with his father, the newly appointed Admiralty commissioner and commander-in-chief of the West Indies, following him into the <i>Formidable</i>. From October 1783 to August 1785 he served in the <i>Assistance</i> on the North American station, with Sir Charles Douglas. He was afterwards in the <i>Trusty</i>, flagship of Sir John Laforey, on the Leeward Islands station, and the <i>Southampton</i>, passed his examination on 31 August 1789, and then returned home for leave.<br>
<br>On 21 September 1790 Pigot was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Colossus</i> (Captain Hugh Cloberry Christian) in the channel, and in 1793&#150;4 he was in the <i>London</i> with Captain Richard Goodwin Keats.<br>
<br>Pigot was made commander of the sloop <i>Swan</i> on the Jamaica station on 10 February 1794. In May she collided with the merchant ship <i>Canada</i>, an action which Pigot blamed on the latter's commander, accusing him of &#145;most insolent Provoking and Abusive Language&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/2310, 15 May 1794). In September 1794 he was posted to the frigate <i>Success</i>, and in July 1796 she was engaged in convoying merchant ships near Santo Domingo. When Pigot collided with the American merchant ship <i>Mercury</i>, he had the latter's rigging cut away, and her captain seized and flogged. The American captain, Jesup, protested to the American consul in Port-au-Prince, accounts from the <span class="italic">New York Diary</span> were sent to the Admiralty, and Robert Liston, British envoy in Philadelphia, complained to the secretary of state, Lord Grenville. In January 1797 an inquiry was held &#145;into the conduct of Captain Pigot of the Success &hellip; for Cruel treatment of an American master&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 50/65, 19 Jan 1797). Pigot blamed Jesup for the affair but apologized for his behaviour and was thereafter exonerated. According to Vice-Admiral Hyde Parker, &#145;however unjustifiable his conduct may have been, and which the Captain acknowledges with great contrition, it falls infinitely short of what has been alledged against him&#146;  (Parker to R. Liston, 9 April 1797, TNA: PRO, ADM 1/248).<br>
<br>The <i>Success</i> was due to return to England but Parker allowed Pigot to exchange with Captain Philip Wilkinson of the <i>Hermione</i> (32 guns). Pigot invited twenty-four of the <i>Success</i>'s crew to accompany him, saying: &#145;My Men I am going to Inform you of my leaveing this Ship but I should be Glad to go home as well as you but dare say you Know the Reason&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/5348, Redman's statement). On 10 February he and his former crew transferred to the <i>Hermione</i>. In March her boats successfully cut out sixteen vessels at Punta Jiguero, capturing a brig. However, her existing crew &#145;Seemed to be Charegrined or dissatisfyed by granting favours [including prize money and the grant of liberty at Port Royal] to them that Came with Captain Pigot&#146;; those who protested were meanwhile &#145;Confined and three he threatened to try by Court Martial at the Mold [Cape Nicolas Mole, modern day Cap Haitien]&#146;  (ibid.). In the following month Pigot, commanding the <i>Mermaid</i>, <i>Quebec</i>, <i>Drake</i>, and <i>Penelope</i>, took &#145;in the most complete manner&#146; fourteen American ships from French privateers at Juan Rabal near Cape Nicolas Mole, recovering nine prizes  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/248, 27 April 1797). In May the <i>Hermione</i> was cruising the South American coast between Caracas and Cura&ccedil;ao when a Lieutenant Harris prevented her from running aground, though the <i>Ceres</i>, also under Pigot's command, could not be saved. Pigot irrationally requested &#145;further enquiry&#146; into why the <i>Ceres</i> had run aground, and claimed that &#145;a great measure [was] to be imputed to his [Harris's] neglect&#146; for not keeping &#145;a proper lookout&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/248, 9 June 1797). However, Rear-Admiral Rodney Bligh acquitted and praised Harris, who left the <i>Hermione</i>.<br>
<br>In August 1797 the <i>Hermione</i>, <i>Renomm&eacute;</i>, and <i>Diligence</i> patrolled the Mona Passage between Santo Domingo and Puerto Rico, taking prizes. The <i>Renomm&eacute;</i> left after being struck by lightning on 11 September. During the cruise Pigot accused Midshipman Casey of contempt because one reefpoint had not been tied, had him flogged for not apologizing on his knees, and relieved him of duty. On the evening of 20 September Pigot's unpredictability and irrationality were again evident when he told the mizentopmen then reefing topsails that he would flog the last man down. In their hurry three fell on the quarterdeck and died, their bodies being thrown overboard on the orders of an unrepentant Pigot. The remaining mizentopmen who had ceased reefing were ordered to be started with rope ends and a dozen to be flogged next day. On the evening of 21 September, as the <i>Hermione</i> drew away from the <i>Diligent</i>, her crew, fortified by drink, attacked the officer of the watch. About 10.30 p.m. Pigot was killed in his cabin by repeated blows and knife-wounds; his body was in turn thrown into the sea. They called &#145;out from all parts of the Ship &#147;that the Ship was their own that Hughy was overboard&#148;&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/5348, Edward Southcott, 13 March 1799). Arguing &#145;they may as well be hung for a Sheep as a Lamb&#146;  (ibid.), the mutinous crew stabbed and threw overboard nine more officers, but the next day spared five warrant and petty officers. Having divided the officers' possessions, they changed their names and swore: &#145;in case of meeting with any part of the Ships Company in any part of the Globe we were not to know them or bring them to England&#146;  (ibid.). A week later the ship arrived at La Guaira, near Caracas, where the crew delivered her to the Spanish governor who fitted her out as a ship of war under the Spanish flag. Vice-Admiral Hyde Parker heard the news from the <i>Diligence</i> on 31 October. Similar plots were discovered on her, as well as the <i>Ceres</i> and <i>Renomm&eacute;</i>, where &#145;The intention was to perform the same Tragedy as that of the Hermione, by the Murdering all the Officers, and carrying the Ship into the Havannah&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/248, 19 March 1798).<br>
<br>The <i>Hermione</i> mutineers received 25 dollars apiece for food and clothing from the Spanish, followed with a choice between hard labour, refitting their ship, or joining the Spanish army. The officers were exchanged, arriving at Martinique in April 1798. &#145;Conceiving it impossible for the Perpetrators of that horrid Act to be at rest, and therefore most probably will ship themselves on board Neutral Vessels, to America and these Islands&#146;, Parker offered rewards for their capture and pardons for evidence  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/248, 15 Nov 1797). Key witnesses were kept in Port Royal and Portsmouth. Between March 1798 and October 1806 thirty-three mutineers were charged and tried with &#145;having murdered her officers, or been aiding and assisting therein, and for having aided and assisted in carrying the said ship to La Guira [<i>sic</i>], and delivering her up to the Enemy&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/5348, 13 March 1799). Twenty-four were hanged and gibbeted as an example (one within an hour of his trial), one transported, and eight acquitted or pardoned. In October 1799 Captain Edward Hamilton of the <i>Surprise</i> heroically cut out the <i>Hermione</i> which was subsequently renamed the <i>Retaliation</i> by Hyde Parker and later the <i>Retribution</i> by the Admiralty. In many ways Hamilton proved a far harder captain than his predecessor Pigot who amid his brutality was also known for acts of generosity. It was precisely this capriciousness and unpredictability, condoned by Hyde Parker, which had prompted the <i>Hermione</i>'s isolated crew to seek redress. Surrounded by enemy ships and ports, they chose mutiny to resolve their grievances, though to the Admiralty theirs were acts of &#145;Mutiny, Murder and Piracy&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 1/248, 2 March 1798).<br>
