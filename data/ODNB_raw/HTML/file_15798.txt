<span class="headword">Knyvet, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1381), <span class="occ">justice and administrator</span>, was the eldest son of Richard Knyvet of Southwick, Northamptonshire (<i>d</i>. 1353), the keeper of Rockingham Forest in that county, and Joanna, daughter and heir of Sir John Wurth. Knyvet was practising in the courts by 1347; in 1354 he became serjeant-at-law, and from 1356 to 1361 served as a king's serjeant. On 24 June 1361 he was appointed a justice of the court of common pleas and was knighted, and on 29 October 1365 he was raised to the office of chief justice of the king's bench. In the parliament of 1362 he served as a trier of petitions for Aquitaine and other lands overseas, and afterwards in each parliament until 1380, except while he was chancellor, was a trier of petitions for England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.<br>
<br>On 5 July 1372, after the death of Sir Robert Thorpe, Knyvet was appointed chancellor. His period of office may have seen significant developments in chancery's emerging function as a court of equity. Speeches which he made at the openings of parliament in 1372, 1373, and 1376 are recorded in the parliament rolls. However, in January 1377 Edward III's government reverted to the custom of appointing ecclesiastical chancellors, and Adam Houghton was appointed to succeed Knyvet on 11 January. But the former minister remained in high standing with the court, for on the day after his dismissal Knyvet was retained for life as a member of the king's council, with an annuity of &pound;200 payable from the hanaper of the chancery. Before he was replaced Knyvet was also appointed <i>ex officio</i> as one of Edward III's executors. He did not again hold judicial office, but was appointed to the first continual council of Richard II's minority government (July&#150;October 1377) and had his annuity confirmed by the new king on 27 February 1378.<br>
<br>Knyvet's principal residence probably remained Southwick, where the hall shows evidence of extensive rebuilding during his tenure. He held large estates in Northamptonshire and throughout East Anglia, and his local connections are reflected by his frequent appointment as justice of assize, gaol delivery, and oyer and terminer in the central and eastern counties. During the 1350s he was also regularly appointed as a justice of the peace in Northamptonshire, and more occasionally in Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk. He had close connections with the royal family, serving as steward of Queen Philippa's estates, counsellor of the Black Prince, and justice of the forest in Lancashire to John of Gaunt. He received fees from the abbot of Ramsey and was in the service of William de Bohun, earl of Northampton, becoming guardian to the latter's son Humphrey.<br>
<br>About 1358 Knyvet married Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1388), daughter and coheir of Ralph, Lord Basset of Weldon. They left five children: John, Robert, Richard, Henry, and Margery, and their descendants established themselves as a leading family in Norfolk. Knyvet died on 16 February 1381; a few months later the escheators' investigations of his lands were disrupted by the outbreak of the peasants' revolt.<br>
