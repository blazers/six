<span class="headword">Betty,  William Henry West</span>  (1791&#150;1874), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 13 September 1791 in the parish of St Chad, Shrewsbury, the son of William Henry Betty (<i>d</i>. 1811), a farmer, of Hopton Wafers, Shropshire, and later manager of a linen factory in Ballynahinch, co. Down, and his wife, a Miss Stanton of Worcestershire. Betty's first visit to a play was in 1801, when he saw Sarah Siddons perform the role of Elvira in <span class="italic">Pizarro</span> by Richard Sheridan at the Belfast theatre. He declared that &#145;he should die if he were not permitted to become a player&#146;  (<span class="italic">Georgian Era</span>, 455), and his father apprenticed him to William Hough, the Belfast prompter. The boy's first stage appearance was on 11 August 1803 at Belfast in the role of Osman in <span class="italic">Zara</span> by Aaron Hill; later in the season he attempted such roles as Young Norval (<span class="italic">Douglas</span> by John Home), Rolla (<span class="italic">Pizarro</span>), and Romeo. Tours to Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Glasgow, and Edinburgh followed. At the last city, box-office receipts for six nights amounted to &pound;844. Betty went on to Liverpool, Sheffield, and Chester.<br>
<br>Having been invited to the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, Betty made the first of twelve appearances at 50 guineas a night on 1 December 1804. Intervening nights were played at Drury Lane at a higher salary, until overwork took its toll. From 18 December until the new year Betty rested, then during 1805 and the first half of 1806 he acted at both theatres. His repertory was extended to include such roles as Achmet (<span class="italic">Barbarossa</span> by John Brown), his opening role in London, and Frederic (<span class="italic">Lovers' Vows</span> by Elizabeth Inchbald). Most of the parts he essayed were of mature and often tyrannical characters: Osmond (<span class="italic">The Castle Spectre</span> by Matthew Lewis), Zanga (<span class="italic">The Revenge</span> by Edward Young), Hamlet, Richard III, and Macbeth. He made an extensive tour during the summer of 1805 while the patent theatres were closed, when he took in his former haunts and, additionally, Berwick, Coventry, Durham, Newcastle upon Tyne, North and South Shields, Preston, Stourbridge, Sunderland, Whitehaven, Wolverhampton, Worcester, and York. &#145;Bettymania&#146; was beginning to wear thin by 1807, but the youth continued his provincial tours until 11 July 1808. He then made a temporary farewell at Stratford upon Avon and became a commoner of Christ's College, Cambridge, until his premature withdrawal in June 1811 on the death of his father, at Pym's Farm, Wem, Shropshire. Betty returned to Covent Garden from 5 November 1812 until 12 June 1813 to muted acclaim and thereafter restricted his appearances to the provinces. On 9 August 1824, after playing Sir Edward Mortimer (<span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span> by George Colman the younger), Betty took his final leave of the stage at the Southampton theatre.<br>
<br>As a child performer Betty was an attractive, agile boy, tall for his age (4 feet 6 inches) and with curly flaxen hair. His small features made him appear flat faced. His presence attracted attention, and something of his charisma is captured by John Opie in his portrait of Betty as Young Norval (1804). By the 1812 season, when Betty was in his early twenties, the stoutness that beset him throughout the rest of his life was already in evidence.<br>
<br>At the time of Betty's stage d&eacute;but the &#145;baby-bubble&#146; (Ann Mathews's term for the phenomenon of the juvenile performers) captivated audiences; Betty's father, together with Hough, used this in promoting the boy. Hough had schooled him to be a professional. After watching Betty's Achmet, James Boaden wrote: &#145;He turned himself, like a veteran, to his work&#151;his eye never wandered from the true mark, and though not dark, it was quick and meaning [<i>sic</i>]&#146;  (<span class="italic">Georgian Era</span>, 456). William Hazlitt was fascinated by his Norval: &#145;he seemed almost like some &#147;gay creature of the element&#148;, moving about gracefully, with all the flexibility of youth&#146;  (W. Hazlitt, <span class="italic">Works</span>, ed. P. P. Howe, 8.294). Adult roles, however, presented difficulties: a miniature tyrant screaming at towering adults left spectators unmoved. His principal weakness was his lack of vocal power and range, causing him to shriek if strength were required. He found difficulty with blank verse, ignoring its rhythm, which gave all of his speeches a &#145;tea-table familiarity&#146; (William Godwin's phrase). Some critics faulted the audiences: Leigh Hunt charged them with being &#145;unmanly&#146; and Thomas Campbell's declaration that the actor was no more than &#145;a hallucination in the public mind&#146;  (Russell, 364) veers towards a charge of mass hysteria. During the 1812 season it was evident the faults of the teenager had become exacerbated in the adult. His vocal limitations induced him to rant, blank verse was beyond him, his features remained flat, and with corpulence grace had deserted him. Watching Betty play Alexander the Great (<span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span> by Nathaniel Lee), Henry Crabb Robinson described him as a &#145;fat, fair, ranting, screaming fellow who might much better represent a Persian eunuch than a Macedonian conqueror&#146;  (E. Brown, 49).<br>
<br>One of Betty's difficulties was his complacent arrogance. By 1805 Hough had been dismissed, in spite of the general praise for his achievement in creating a boy wonder, and &#145;Peter Pangloss&#146; reported Betty speaking about help with technical matters: &#145;Oh, that's nothing &hellip; when I am on &hellip; I am sure to bring them down; I engross the whole attention of the audience&#146;  (Playfair, 130). John Bannister recognized in the actor a lack of application and consequently the impossibility of improvement. Those who early in his career had referred to Betty as the Young Roscius, an allusion to David Garrick, had done the child actor no service. Betty regretted his necessary departure from the London stage, and in 1825 <span class="italic">The Times</span> reported that he had attempted to commit suicide.<br>
<br>Before 1819 Betty had quietly married Susanna Crow, a Shropshire girl, and in September of that year their only child, Henry Thomas, was born. After his theatrical career had ended Betty lived in London, at Holborn, the Adelphi, and 37 Ampthill Square, Highgate, where he died on 24 August 1874. He was buried in a tomb of his own design in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>His son, <a name="cosubject_49655"></a><span class="headword">Henry Thomas Betty</span>  (1819&#150;1897), was born in London on 29 September 1819. He studied theology, but after two years abandoned this and, with his father's help, prepared to become an <span class="occ">actor</span>. He made his first stage appearance at the Hereford theatre on 28 August 1838, playing Achmet (his father's first London role) in <span class="italic">Barbarossa</span>. The theatre was managed by John Boles Watson III (possibly Watson IV), in whose company Betty continued to perform. He played in various provincial companies until 1843, when he appeared at Edinburgh and Glasgow and then London, making his d&eacute;but at Covent Garden on 28 December 1844. Other London theatres at which he performed were the Pavilion, Queen's, and Olympic, where in 1854 he made his farewell to the stage.<br>
<br>To some extent Betty traded on the family name, reviving the roles his father had played. Nevertheless he was a capable actor, wrote an obituarist in the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span> (27 February 1897), &#145;of the Old-world &#147;legitimate&#148; type&#146;. During his retirement he continued his theatrical connections as president of the Dramatic and Musical Benevolent Fund, and after his death left &pound;5000 to the General Theatrical Fund and a further sum of the same amount on the death of his widow; the bequest was to be known as Betty's Fund for Poor Actors and Actresses. Betty died at The Betony, Thurlow Park Road, West Dulwich, on 7 February 1897 and was buried at Highgate cemetery.<br>
