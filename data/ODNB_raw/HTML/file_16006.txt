<span class="headword">Langbaine,  Gerard</span>  (1608/9&#150;1658), <span class="occ">college head</span>, the son of William Langbaine, was born at Barton Kirk, Westmorland. After education at Blencow School, Cumberland, on 17 April 1625 he entered Queen's College, Oxford, from which he matriculated on 21 November 1628, aged nineteen. On 6 October 1627 he received a non-residential Dudley exhibition of Oriel College, and on 10 June 1630 a scholarship at Queen's. Having graduated BA the following 24 July, he became a tutor and grammar reader. He proceeded MA on 27 June 1633, when he had to sell his patrimony to pay debts, and was elected fellow the following 30 October. Ordained deacon in 1634 and priest in 1635, he held no ecclesiastical preferment other than the vicarage of Crosthwaite, near Kendal, Westmorland, obtained in early 1643.<br>
<br>The diarist Thomas Crosfield suggests that Langbaine was a lively presence at Queen's. In 1638 he and another fellow stocked the garden with lapwings and with a hare which died after two days from rough handling. Crosfield also noted, in 1633, Langbaine's books. These included Xenophon in Greek, dictionaries and religious, literary, political, and historical works in Italian and French, volumes on Hebrew antiquities, Sir Thomas Ridley's <span class="italic">A View of the Civile and Ecclesiastical Law</span>, and a work on the Council of Trent.<br>
<br>From early on Langbaine delved in Oxford libraries and their manuscript collections, and exhibited catholic interests in print. From 1625 he regularly contributed verses to celebratory academic volumes. He compiled a detailed index for John Gregory's second edition of Ridley's <span class="italic">View</span> in 1634, and two years later published a student edition of Dionysius Longinus's Greek study of the sublime including his own detailed commentary. In 1638, inspired by the dedicatee, Christopher Potter, provost of Queen's, his <span class="italic">A Review of the Councell of Trent</span> translated the work of the Gallican Guillaume Ranchin while disclaiming Catholic doctrinal content. Probably dating from his years as a tutor was a basic guide for students, <span class="italic">Philosophiae moralis compendium</span>, printed posthumously in 1698 with additional material by Thomas Barlow. According to Thomas Hearne, Langbaine was already in touch with continental scholars, sending in 1641 a transcript of Bodleian manuscripts of Ailred of Rievaulx's <span class="italic">De vinculo perfectionis</span> and <span class="italic">De vita inclusarum</span> to Jacobus Merlon Horstius of Cologne for an edition of St Bernard.<br>
<br>In 1641 Langbaine entered the political arena with his <span class="italic">Episcopall Inheritance</span>, defending the right of bishops to vote in the House of Lords (which provoked a response by Cornelius Burges), and a new edition, pointedly relevant, of Sir John Cheke's <span class="italic">Hurt of Sedition</span>, entitled <span class="italic">The True Subiect to the Rebell</span>, with a preface on Edward VI's reign and a life of the author. Registered as absent from college in the protestation returns of 1642, later that year Langbaine was prominent in a delegation dealing with Sir John Byron's royal troopers and was sent by the university to Nottingham, probably in connection with providing money for the king. In 1644 his antiquarian and legal skills made him the obvious successor to Brian Twyne as the university's keeper of the archives and defender of academic privileges. It was probably he who published in that year <span class="italic">A Review of the Covenant</span>, arguing that the solemn league and covenant was unlawful.<br>
<br>Langbaine was chosen Camden lecturer in ancient history in 1646 but did not take up the post. He succeeded Potter as provost of Queen's on 11 March and was created DD on 22 June. Soon afterwards he married his predecessor's widow, Elizabeth (1613&#150;1692), daughter of Charles Sunnybanke, canon of Windsor. Two sons, William and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16007/', "Gerard Langbaine (1656&#150;1692)")</script>, and at least one other child, were born to the couple.<br>
<br>As the university's custodian of its privileges Langbaine participated in negotiations for Oxford's surrender in 1646, and his successive drafts of articles to safeguard academic freedoms survive. Later he visited London to lobby parliament through the university's MP, John Selden, for payment of rents withheld, and strove, unsuccessfully, to have the Stationers' Company pay contracted dues. Langbaine was probably largely responsible for <span class="italic">The Privileges of the University of Oxford, in Point of Visitation</span>, issued in 1647. He contributed to <span class="italic">Reasons for the present judgment of the University of Oxford concerning the solemn league and covenant</span>, printed the same year, and then translated it into Latin for publication in 1648 with a view to reaching learned men abroad. Madan conjectures that amid such employments he also edited the autobiographical <span class="italic">Life of Sir Thomas Bodley</span> (1647).<br>
<br>It was almost certainly Langbaine who wrote <span class="italic">The answer of the chancellor, masters and scholars of the University of Oxford, to the petition, articles of grievance, and reasons of the city of Oxon.</span>, printed in 1649 and presented to the parliamentary committee for Oxford in response to an assault by the city on academic privileges. With unrivalled antiquarian knowledge and the assistance of the learned civil lawyer Richard Zouche, Langbaine easily saw off parliamentary projects to reform the university's Laudian statutes after 1649. He was involved in the reconstitution of the chancellor's court in July 1650. In 1651 he published <span class="italic">The Foundation of the Universitie of Oxford</span> and <span class="italic">The Foundation of the Universitie of Cambridge</span>, both, as Wood noted, drawing heavily on John Scot's work decades earlier. He produced, possibly for manuscript circulation, verses on three political questions aired at the formal vespers disputations of 1651, which were published in 1658 with Sir Henry Savile's <span class="italic">Oratio, coram Regina Elizabetha Oxoniae habita</span>. His concern at the decline of the civil law led him to collaborate on Arthur Duck's <span class="italic">De usu et authoritate juris civilis</span> (1653), and in late 1654 he organized a spirited defence of the languishing faculty in Oxford. The following year, with several intruded heads of house, he sought revision of dangerous new terms of parliamentary visitation, an effort resulting in tacit forbearance.<br>
<br>Langbaine also adroitly defended the interests of his college against parliamentary interference. He did not take the engagement, but still survived. Writing to his scholarly friend Selden, who smoothed his path, he accepted the earl of Pembroke as chancellor. On 9 October 1648 he wrote shrewdly enlisting the aid of another friend, Francis Mills MP, active with the parliamentary committee, on behalf of the fellows of Queen's: few were lost and few intruded. Diplomacy and outward moderation were rewarded when Queen's was allowed to elect its own officers again in April 1652. From 1651 Langbaine could count on the former Queen's man John Owen, now dean of Christ Church after a period as Cromwell's chaplain. The provost seems to have been no stickler for Church of England liturgy and formulas. His second son, Gerard, born on 15 July 1656, was &#145;baptized by Dr. Wallis after the new cutt, without godfathers&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 18/129, fol. 140<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Langbaine maintained a prudent freedom of thought and expression within Queen's, reputed in the 1650s as royalist as circumstances permitted and so attracting loyalists and young men of rank to a degree exceptional in Oxford. In 1654 Langbaine and others there contributed to support distressed bishops in exile. Remembering his own struggles with poverty Langbaine not only endowed a grammar school at Barton, his birthplace, and funded apprenticeships for two poor boys, but also sought unsuccessfully to convince selfish fellows to improve remuneration for poor scholars. On a recommendation from Richard Busby of Westminster School, he admitted in 1650 the talented young Joseph Williamson, whom he helped from his own pocket. Despite his best efforts, however, during his last years there were factional disputes, centred on Thomas Barlow, in the fellowship.<br>
<br>Langbaine continued his own scholarly and antiquarian work. In 1643 he began cataloguing Greek manuscripts in the Bodleian and in college libraries, becoming the indispensable expert. In 1652 he initiated the creation of a subject catalogue of the Bodleian and college libraries. This was never finished, although part of his own assignment survives. He produced a bibliographical survey of Platonic writers in Greek and Latin and the whereabouts of their work in Oxford, eventually printed by John Fell in his <span class="italic">Alcinoi in Platonicam philosophiam introductio</span> (1667). Between 1650 and 1652, at Selden's suggestion, Langbaine produced with the aid of young scholars transcriptions of musical manuscripts for Marcus Meibom of Holstein to include in his <span class="italic">Antiquae auctores septem, Graece et Latine</span> (Amsterdam, 1652). A letter of 1656 from Franciscus Junius to William Dugdale suggests that Langbaine was then working on Anglo-Saxon texts. Thomas Fuller believed he was preparing an expanded edition of Twyne's work on the antiquity of Oxford, although this was denied by Wood. Hearne says he was also working on a new edition of Francis Godwin's <span class="italic">De praesulibus Angliae</span> (1616) and that he contributed to William Dugdale's <span class="italic">A Short View of the Late Troubles in England</span>, printed only in 1681. When Archbishop Ussher died in 1656 he left his unfinished <span class="italic">Chronologia sacra</span> to Langbaine as the only man he could trust to prepare it for publication, and Wood says the provost &#145;drudged much&#146;  (Wood, 3.447) in this task.<br>
<br>Langbaine also laboured incessantly for the learned press in Oxford. Particularly active in this field from 1647, he formally became a delegate for the press in 1653. As keeper of the archives he looked after matrices and founts of type at his lodgings and bought Hebrew founts between 1655 and 1657 and a large fount of Anglo-Saxon in 1656.<br>
<br>Langbaine was a vital prop to numerous scholars: &#145;as his Brain was the Mother of some, so was it the Midwife to other, good Books which he procured to be published&#146;  (Fuller, 1.239). It was he who encouraged Selden to obtain the restoration of Edward Pococke's stipend as Laudian professor of Arabic, drawing up the university's protest at his treatment, and he encouraged Pococke to publish his <span class="italic">Specimen historiae Arabum</span> (1650), his 1655 edition of the <span class="italic">Porta Mosis</span> of Maimonides, and his 1654&#150;6 edition of Eutychius' <span class="italic">Annales</span>; Pococke acknowledged Langbaine as the spur to publication of his <span class="italic">Historia compendiosa dynastiarum, authore Gregorio Abul-Pharajio</span> (1663). Langbaine also supported John Greaves and Samuel Clarke in their Arabic and Hebrew scholarship, and Sir Henry Spelman and William Dugdale in their work on <span class="italic">The History and Fate of Sacrilege</span> and <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span> respectively. His friendship and correspondence with men like Ussher, Selden, Spelman, Dugdale, and Pococke attest to his pivotal position in English scholarship in these decades. He had also been a friend of the learned Ben Jonson.<br>
<br>Langbaine died on 10 February 1658 &#145;of an extream cold taken by sitting in the University-Library whole Winter days, and thence after his return home, continuing in his study whole Winter nights, without any food or fire&#146;  (Lloyd, 518), apparently working over-hard on the project left him by Ussher. He was buried in the college chapel on 13 February alongside his two predecessors. By his will, among modest bequests to his stepchildren and others, virtually everyone at Queen's, including servants, was given a small sum; the residue of his estate went to his wife. A portion of his books, his &#145;greatest earthly treasure&#146;, was bequeathed to the college, and another to the Bodleian Library, the curator of which was to have choice of others at fair price. In April and May 1658 Anthony Wood, who respected Langbaine highly, acquired some of his books and manuscripts.<br>
