</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Petty, Sir  William</span>  (1623&#150;1687), <span class="occ">natural philosopher and administrator in Ireland</span>, was born at Romsey, Hampshire, on 26 May 1623, the third child of Anthony Petty (1587&#150;1654), clothier, and his wife, Francesca (<i>d</i>. 1663). In later life Petty was keen to stress the obscurity of his origins in order to exaggerate his spectacular success.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>After a conventional education in Romsey, Petty did not follow his father's calling in the textile trade, but instead went to sea as a mariner. An accident on board ship led to his being abandoned in Normandy in 1637. This mishap was apparently put to good use when he enrolled in a Jesuit college at Caen. There he refined his mathematical proficiency and developed a voracious appetite for learning. On returning to London he continued his studies. However, once the civil war broke out he returned to the continent. His intention was to acquire medical qualifications. To this end he went to Amsterdam, Leiden, Utrecht, and Paris. In Paris he met and quizzed Thomas Hobbes, Gassendi, and Mersenne, and was put in touch with prime exponents of experimental science. He was back in England by 1646 and continued his education at Oxford. The victory of parliament and consequent purge of royalists and episcopalians from the university speeded Petty's advance. Happy enough to comply with the political and ecclesiastical principles of the new order he accepted a fellowship of Brasenose College, probably in 1648, and was created DM on 7 March 1650. In 1651 he served as vice-principal of the college, and was elected to the professorship of anatomy. He attended assiduously to the duties of the post. Some of his lecture notes&#151;in Latin&#151;have survived and reveal the methodical manner in which he approached his responsibilities.<br>
<br>As well as lecturing Petty conducted chemical experiments and built up a private medical practice. It was as a doctor that he first achieved wider fame. He resuscitated the corpse of Anne Greene, which had been cut down from the gallows and was intended for dissection. This wonder was soon publicized in pamphlets, and brought Petty's name before a larger public. He was admitted to a fellowship of the College of Physicians, and elected as one of the readers at Gresham's College in London.<h2>
<a name="SurveyorinIreland1650s"></a>Surveyor in Ireland, 1650s</h2>Petty's medical skills secured his next appointment, in September 1652, as physician to the army in Ireland. Contacts in Oxford, as well as the recent publicity over Anne Greene, probably secured the post. Paid &pound;1 daily it was financially attractive. It also brought additional fees through attending officers of the English army and administration. Petty's talents, which he never hid, were soon in demand in other spheres. In particular the complex task of surveying the lands forfeited by the defeated Irish insurgents and of allotting them to their new owners among the English soldiery and investors overstretched the resources of the administration. Petty derided the scheme of the surveyor-general, Worsley, and sketched a better of his own. In December 1654, a grateful government accepted his proposal for the &#145;down survey&#146;, as it became known. Its chief attraction was its lower cost. The circumstances in which Petty had ousted Worsley rankled. Not only had he impugned Worsley's technical abilities, but he differed from his competitor in religion and politics. Worsley had identified with the republicans and sectaries who thrived under the lax regime of Lord Deputy Charles Fleetwood. This group felt beleaguered when in the summer of 1655 Fleetwood was effectively superseded by his brother-in-law, Henry Cromwell. Petty, for his part, gravitated towards Henry Cromwell, becoming one of his secretaries and a confidant. As a result, he was regarded as a prime target by the aggrieved republicans and officers. These alignments help to explain why Petty's survey was fiercely criticized. Inevitable mistakes, especially when he had to rely on soldiers for much of the detailed surveying, led to the available lands being underestimated by 10 per cent. This deficiency embarrassed a government which intended that the confiscations surveyed by Petty should reward thousands of creditors. The latter, civilians in England and soldiers in Ireland, had expected more and better than they were now allocated. However, the undoubted shortcomings in the down survey pale beside its achievement. The mapping was based on the administrative unit of the barony, and combined other man-made features with the staples of the physical terrain. On the basis of Petty's work 8,400,000 acres were redistributed to new (and usually protestant) owners.<br>
<br>Any final distribution of the lands took time. The impatient and disappointed blamed Petty. Moreover their often meagre returns were contrasted with the evident plenty which Petty himself had secured. He conceded that he had made at least &pound;9000 from the undertaking. Soon allegations of chicanery as well as incompetence were voiced. In the parliament of 1659 a direct attack was launched when Sir Jerome Sankey, an MP from Ireland and sectarian supporter of Fleetwood, sought to have Petty impeached. More than the detail of the down survey was at stake. Strenuous efforts had been made to have Petty elected to this parliament, with the result that he was returned for both the Cornish constituency of West Looe and an Irish one. He chose to sit for the first. Petty had been selected for attack not just because he was the architect of the land settlement and could be blamed for its inadequacies. He personified the more conservative tenor of Henry Cromwell's government, and as such antagonized the supporters of &#145;the good old cause&#146;: in the Irish context, the regime of Fleetwood. The parliament was dissolved before Petty suffered any serious retribution. Belatedly, in 1660, he published his own riposte to Sankey.<br>
<br>The protracted dispute with Worsley was the more embarrassing because both he and Petty belonged to the circle of Samuel Hartlib, the refugee from Bohemia anxious to advance learning and protestantism. Petty embraced the empirical and utilitarian philosophy of the group, having been introduced to many of its principles while he was on the continent during the 1640s. He first showed his commitment publicly in 1648 when he addressed a printed manifesto on the advancement of learning to Hartlib. The same principles underpinned the down survey, and assorted practical and utopian schemes which Petty (and others) promoted in Cromwellian Ireland. His many talents, including a taste for controversy, endeared him to Henry Cromwell. The clerkship to the council, to which the latter had promoted him, added &pound;400 to Petty's annual income.<h2>
<a name="PoliticspublicofficeandIreland16601685"></a>Politics, public office, and Ireland, 1660&#150;1685</h2>The collapse of the protectorate at first presented the agnostic Petty with opportunities. He was in England during 1659, and frequented the Rota Club, a group of republican idealists. What soon followed, the restoration of Charles II, offered both challenges and chances. Petty, supple and opportunistic, seized the chances and met the challenges. He had not been concerned in the representative body, the general convention, which assembled in Dublin briefly in the spring of 1660. But he was returned to the Irish parliament of 1661 for the Wexford borough of Enniscorthy and the Kilkenny town of Inistioge. He opted for the second.<br>
<br>Petty's experience and his considerable stake in Ireland&#151;more than 18,000 acres in five counties&#151;gave him a continuing role there. His usefulness explained his being chosen as an MP. At the same time, closely involved in the Cromwellian regime, he was naturally suspected. Persistent doubts about his reliability meant that he was never again entrusted with the same responsibilities as in the 1650s. Relegated to the Irish council of trade Petty was unwearyingly inventive in the suggestions with which he bombarded the government in Dublin. But few of his schemes were adopted. Also, he felt victimized when his large holdings of Irish lands were subjected to heavy taxes. This was an issue with which Petty became obsessed. The estates were to serve as a showcase for his rational methods. By increasing their yield and value he would show others how best to proceed. Much of what he hoped to do still derived from the philosophy and designs of his and Hartlib's friends. The informal discussions and plans of the 1650s were systematized, notably in the Royal Society. Not only had Petty joined the groups of the 1650s, but was a founding member of the Royal Society when it was established in 1662 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/59221', "Founder members of the Royal Society")</script>]. Because he divided his time between Ireland and England, participation in the London society was erratic until the early 1670s, when he became (temporarily) a stalwart.<br>
<br>Petty exemplified the continuities between the earlier devotees of the Baconian method, the utilitarianism of Hartlib's followers, and the wider constituency of the fashionable and altruistic to which the infant Royal Society appealed. Reading, interpreting, and communicating &#145;the book of nature&#146; preoccupied him. His wit and asperity entertained the king. Petty was unabashed in seeking a profitable outlet for his manifold talents. He impressed and amused the important, including the king, by his verbal and intellectual dexterity. Unfortunately, he also irritated and bored them. Although knighted in 1661 he felt undervalued and underemployed. A peerage proffered in acknowledgement of his wealth&#151;estimated at more than &pound;6000 p.a., principally from Irish lands&#151;was spurned. Rationally enough he objected to the extra expenditure that such a rank would involve. He sought in vain a seat in the privy council.<br>
<br>Petty's claims to fresh public employment were seconded with a series of disquisitions. These built on his work in the 1650s. Maps which had first been drawn to assist the down survey were corrected and reworked until they could be issued in 1685 as the first atlas of Irish counties, <span class="italic">Hiberniae delineatio</span>. Before that Petty regarded the originals of the maps as his own property and charged those who wished to consult them. At the same time he composed apparently authoritative surveys of the topography, demography, and potential of Ireland. In these writings he returned many times to the obvious gap between the ideal and the real Ireland. If some of these tracts had arisen from his official role in the council of trade, others, such as <span class="italic">A Treatise of Taxes and Contributions</span> (1662) backed his unsuccessful bid to farm the Irish customs revenues. The majority remained in manuscript but circulated freely among those who governed Ireland and England. In addition to serving personal and topical purposes Petty was developing a mathematical approach to the problems confronting government. With access to official data about mortality, housing, imports, and exports, he collected and then analysed much. In particular, interest in matters relating to production and employment led him to elaborate a theory of economic surplus, through which human beings would be freed from the drudgery of constant labour. He was also consciously promoting the discipline of &#145;political arithmetic&#146;, entailing a more rigorously statistical approach to running the state.<br>
<br>Petty's interest in the problems and opportunities specific to Ireland was encouraged anew by his appointment in 1676 as judge and registrar of the admiralty court in Dublin. His authority derived from James, duke of York, who, although obliged by the <span class="roman">Test Act</span> of 1673 to relinquish the post of lord high admiral in England, evidently retained an Admiralty jurisdiction over Ireland. Petty went to work enthusiastically. He hoped through his court to assist poor mariners against arbitrary masters. However, he was obstructed both by common lawyers and landowners resentful of the Admiralty. Petty planned to rout these adversaries by investigating the origins and extent of the court's powers. This ambition, along with his aim that the Admiralty advance commerce and shipping, was not realized.<h2>
<a name="Politicalarithmeticandcommercialschemes"></a>Political arithmetic and commercial schemes</h2>The accession of James II, his erstwhile patron, revived Petty's hopes. After 1685 he deluged the new monarch with proposals. What Petty wrote, about both Ireland and England, blended exact statistical information with fanciful projections. True to his belief in the empirical method, learned on the continent early in the 1640s, he aimed to end idle speculation by expressing all in &#145;number, weight and measure&#146;. This statistical precision certainly added to the novelty and authority of <span class="italic">The Political Arithmetic</span> and <span class="italic">Anatomy of Ireland</span>. The precision owed much to his access to the cadastral data which had been collected under his own auspices during the down survey, and later when poll and hearth taxes were levied in Ireland and as bills of mortality enumerated and classified the dead both in London and Dublin. In addition he gathered information from his own estates, particularly those in co. Kerry, from which he then constructed his larger theories. These offered estimates of the proportions and absolute totals of those involved in different occupations and living in houses of different sizes. He also speculated about the mean sizes of households in Ireland, again distinguishing between the various social orders.<br>
<br>Petty did not confine his advice and reflections to Ireland. In England, he concerned himself with agriculture, industry, technology, population, architecture, and medicine. He also interested himself in the demography of London, now more clearly revealed in the weekly bills of mortality. In association with John Graunt he analysed this material and used it to predict future trends. During the 1680s these analytical techniques were applied to Dublin. Petty examined the wealth, potential and actual, of England. He saw labour as the key to increased national prosperity. Like other commentators he sought lessons from the evident successes of the United Provinces and France under Colbert. The novelty in Petty's approach was to quantify. Yet sometimes his willingness to give numbers invested his calculations with a spurious authority. Just as the down survey was found wanting as to its accuracy, so in his later endeavours too often he seemed to pluck numbers from the air, usually when solid figures were lacking. Nevertheless, by abstracting numbers and using these as the basis of calculation, whether of profit and loss in his own Irish ironworks or English trades and industries, he constructed the method known as political arithmetic which was widely copied in the later seventeenth century (and beyond). In addition, by isolating such issues as the velocity of circulation, the difference between the natural and market price of a commodity, and the theory of economic surplus, he established important themes and methods for classical economists.<br>
<br>Intimates venerated Petty. Sceptical and droll, when relaxed he delighted and charmed. On occasion he composed scabrous and indecent verses. Others merely encountered a combative and abrasive character. Detractors revelled in his discomfiture when certain of his highly advertised ventures foundered. Notable among these was the double-hulled ship&#151;a novel catamaran&#151;which turned turtle and sank in Dublin Bay. The wearisome struggle to overcome the impersonal and human obstacles to immediate improvement of his Irish estates disillusioned him and cautioned his contemporaries. Yet something of the respect in which he was held was shown in 1684 when he was chosen as first president of the Dublin Philosophical Society. This was appropriate as the institution sought to realize the objectives which Petty and his associates had espoused since the 1650s. Its rules insisted on a preference for experiment and observation rather than for tradition, the free communication of discoveries, and more intensive researches into the physical resources of Ireland.<h2>
<a name="Familylifeandlastyears"></a>Family life and last years</h2>After 1660 the bulk of Petty's income came from Ireland. He hoped to use it to finance an English career. To this end he investigated the purchase of an English country estate. In the event, he remained in London, where he owned a house and dabbled in the redevelopment after the fire of 1666. On Trinity Sunday 1667 he married Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1636&#150;1708/10), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28557/', "Sir Hardress Waller (c.1604&#150;1666)")</script>, the regicide, a prominent landowner in co. Limerick. She was the widow of another prosperous settler in Munster, Sir Maurice Fenton (<i>d</i>. 1664). Care of a young son gave her interests which were multiplied after her marriage to Petty. Her new husband deputed oversight and management of his scattered Irish concerns to her, especially during his absences in London. Together they attended to the upbringing of four children, John (<i>bap</i>. 1669, <i>d</i>. 1670), Charles (<i>c</i>.1653&#150;1696), Henry (1675&#150;1751), and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1737), who married Thomas Fitzmaurice, first earl of Kerry (1668?&#150;1742), and was grandmother of the prime minister, the second earl of Shelburne. The needs of his family and household prompted Petty to reflect more generally on education. True to his questioning approach he rejected as useless some parts of the traditional scholastic curriculum, and instead urged more practical and vocational studies, akin to those which he had had. At the same time he was sensitive to the compromises and conventions necessary to succeed in public life. His own failures cautioned him against too cavalier a dismissal of these requirements.<br>
<br>James II failed to adopt Petty's programme. It included constitutional union of England with Ireland and the enforced transfer of peoples from one island to the other. These proposals, redolent of what had been attempted in the interregnum, belonged to a tradition in which Ireland was treated simply as a colony akin to North America. On other occasions he accepted as axiomatic that Ireland was a kingdom with its own sophisticated institutions, albeit one which had been conquered and subordinated to England. Petty's stated indifference to questions of religious confession ought to have endeared him to the Catholic monarch eager to help his co-religionists. However, Petty's willingness to contemplate greater generosity to Catholics combined with a fierce and occasionally irreverent anti-clericalism. Clerical power, especially as exercised by the papacy and Catholic priesthood, conflicted with Petty's idea of a well-governed state in which the church was firmly subordinated to the secular authorities. Nor could Petty escape from the logic of a situation in which he, in common with other recent gainers of Irish lands, benefited directly from the expropriation of the Irish Catholics. He never proposed a wholesale reversal of the land transfers which his own work had facilitated and from which he had profited so handsomely. In addition, although many of his schemes rested on a belief that the indigenous Irish could be trained for a variety of crafts and tasks, he did not altogether shed the English sense of cultural superiority.<br>
<br>From 1685 Petty lived continuously in London. Easier access to the king and court did not in the end bring any greater influence over policies. His health deteriorated sharply, and on 16 December 1687 he died at his London residence in Piccadilly. He was buried at Romsey Abbey. His ample fortune, suspected by contemporaries, was fully disclosed in his will. It was further recognized when, in 1688, his widow was ennobled as Baroness Shelburne, and the barony of the same name conferred on his eldest surviving son, Charles. The scope of Petty's interests and scale of his achievements were enlarged after his death: first, with the publication of his <span class="italic">Political Arithmetic</span> in 1690 and <span class="italic">Political Anatomy</span> in 1691, and then of other papers. This process has still to be completed. The writings, if sometimes repetitive and frequently utopian, provide abundant detail of the physical and human geography of seventeenth-century Ireland and England. They also show Petty's formidable intellectual prowess, especially as the originator of statistical analysis under the name of political arithmetic.<br>
