<span class="headword">Burbury <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hicks]</span>,  Edwina Jane</span>  (1818/19&#150;1870), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was the daughter of Edward Raymond Hicks and his wife, Frances Pickering. Nothing is known of her early life, but she married Thomas Potter Burbury (<i>bap</i>. 1815, <i>d</i>. 1868), solicitor, on 9 August 1841; they had at least two children, Thomas Raymond in 1842 and Florence Elizabeth in 1843. Her husband appears to have fallen into financial difficulties early in their marriage. In 1848 she published her first work, <span class="italic">How to Spend a Week Happily</span>, a religious tale for young people, the success of which led her to write a sequel, <span class="italic">Mabel Trevor</span>, in 1853. She became a contributor to <span class="italic">Sharpe's London Magazine</span> at the beginning of 1849 &#145;for the support of herself and her young family&#146;. In 1849 the editor, Frank Smedley, aware of her friendship with G. P. R. James, published <span class="italic">Seven Tales by Seven Authors</span>&#151;a collection of short stories including one by James&#151;with the aim of donating all the proceeds to Edwina Burbury. Her pecuniary difficulties do not seem to have been immediately alleviated, however; Charles Dickens's accounts show him &#145;contributing a subscription of &pound;5 in favour of Mrs Burbury&#146; in 1855. Burbury's own tale in this collection was &#145;The Trust&#146;, described in the &#145;Preface&#146; as &#145;not actually &#147;founded on fact&#148;&#146; but &#145;suggested by some of the bitter experiences of her own eventful career&#146;; the story tells of the heroine's husband suffering severe financial losses and being imprisoned for bankruptcy, and of her children being taken into the care of her brother-in-law's family and one of them dying through neglect. How much of this is applicable to Burbury is, like so much of her life, a matter of conjecture. Of her contributions to periodicals and five works, she is most famous for her novel <span class="italic">Florence Sackville</span> (1853), which charts a woman's struggle for independence and love, and success in becoming an author, and was enjoyed by Charlotte Bront&euml;. All her fiction has a strongly Christian emphasis. Her husband died on 15 March 1868 in Bewdley, leaving his wife &#145;debts&#146; and his children his &#145;best love&#146;. The Royal Literary Fund archive reveals that since 1860 Burbury had supported herself and her children through her writing; her husband had previously eloped with Edwina's sister and was also dependent on her support. Edwina Burbury died in Wallingford on 17 February 1870 at the age of fifty-one, her occupation being listed merely as &#145;widow&#146;. She is frequently confused in reference works with Selina Bunbury.<br>
