<span class="headword">Corneliszoon,  Lucas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Lucas Corneliszoon de Cock]</span>  (<em>b. </em>1495, <em>d.</em> in or before 1552), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Leiden, the third son of the painter Cornelis Engelbrechtszoon and his wife, Elysabeth Pietersdochter. Corneliszoon was presumably trained by his father and was noted by the painter and biographer Karel van Mander as a painter in oil and watercolours. His family were of prosperous burgher class and so there is reason to question the assertion that &#145;he could barely maintain himself in his native town by means of the art of painting&#146;  (van Mander, 129) and was thus compelled to take up cooking. He probably went to England during the reign of Henry VIII, as did several other artists from the Low Countries, although the only work which may be autograph and date from this time is an oval portrait of Sir Thomas Wyat (priv. coll.), which is inscribed &#145;Lucas Cornelii&#146;. Van Mander, who mentions a number of his works still surviving in 1604, states that his paintings were much sought after by Englishmen who arrived in the Netherlands during the earl of Leicester's governorship (1585&#150;7) and this statement may be based on van Mander's personal observation. Corneliszoon was back in Leiden on 16 June 1542, but the length of this visit cannot be determined and it cannot therefore be assumed that he did not spend a considerable amount of time in England. Attempts have been made to ascribe a number of works in various media to him, but these attributions remain inconclusive, especially because his identity has been confused with Jan (Wellens?) de Cock. Corneliszoon died before 27 June 1552. It is not known whom he married, but according to van Mander he had seven or eight children, who were living abroad, conceivably in England, at the time of his death, which may also have taken place in England.<br>
