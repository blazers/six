<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Higgins,  Reynold Alleyne</span>  (1916&#150;1993), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 26 November 1916 in Weybridge, Surrey, the son of Charles Alleyne Higgins (1887&#150;1975), solicitor, and Margaret Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor (1882&#150;1978), singer. He was educated as a foundation scholar at Sherborne School, and as an exhibitioner at Pembroke College, Cambridge. In 1937 he obtained first-class honours in the classical tripos, with special merit in the archaeological papers. His initial urge to pursue an archaeological career was temporarily postponed, at his father's wish, by employment in the civil service (the Coal Commission, later the National Coal Board), and further delayed by the Second World War, in which he served in the King's Royal Rifle Corps. During the retreat from France in 1940 he became a prisoner of war and he remained in captivity for the rest of the war. He kept up his own spirits, and raised those of his fellow prisoners, by giving lively and popular lectures on ancient Greek history; in those conditions he developed a talent for speaking to lay audiences with wit, verve, and clarity, for which he was much admired in many different contexts during his later years.<br>
<br>In 1947 Higgins married Patricia Williams (<i>b</i>. 1925), a physiotherapist at St Thomas's Hospital; they were to enjoy forty-seven years of happy marriage, raising three sons and two daughters in whom they took great pride. In the same year Higgins was appointed assistant keeper in the British Museum's department of Greek and Roman antiquities. While taking a hand in preparing the temporary displays of the first post-war years under the leadership of the keeper, Bernard Ashmole, he also undertook the major task of producing an up-to-date catalogue of the museum's vast collection of miniature Greek sculptures in clay. He received international acclaim for his magisterial study of the terracottas, published in two volumes as <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Terracottas in the British Museum</span> (1954 and 1959), which eventually earned him a DLitt degree at Cambridge (1964). His volumes were praised especially for his illuminating comments on ancient Greek dress and other aspects of daily life, made in the light of the figurines.<br>
<br>During the 1950s Higgins also became deeply involved in what were to be his two other main fields of research. His early interest in the Aegean Bronze Age, fostered by the teaching of A. J. B. Wace at Cambridge, received a fresh stimulus from M. Ventris's decipherment (published in 1952) of the Minoan and Mycenaean texts in Linear B script as an early form of Greek. In his paper, <span class="italic">The Archaeological Background of the Furniture Tablets of Pylos</span> (1956), Higgins pioneered an archaeological approach to the consequences of the decipherment. The following year, turning his attention to the British Museum's Aegina treasure, a collection of prehistoric gold ornaments which had hitherto defied convincing attribution, he made an unanswerable case for their origin in Minoan Crete; his final view, for the general reader, was presented as <span class="italic">The Aegina Treasure: an Archaeological Mystery</span> (1979). Thereafter Higgins developed a broader commitment to the study of Greek and Roman jewellery from the early Bronze Age until late Roman times; his general book, <span class="italic">Greek and Roman Jewellery</span> (1961, revised 1980), was greeted as the first full coverage of the subject in English. In 1967 he also published succinct and illuminating handbooks on his two other fields of expertise: <span class="italic">Greek Terracottas</span>, and <span class="italic">Minoan and Mycenaean Art</span> (revised 1981). In recognition of wide-ranging scholarly achievement, the British Academy elected him a fellow in 1972.<br>
<br>Higgins was promoted deputy keeper in 1965, and became acting keeper of his department in 1967. In that year he negotiated a loan exhibition of Thracian gold from Bulgaria, the first occasion when ancient gold had been allowed to cross the Iron Curtain. In 1977 he was elected the first president of the newly constituted Society of Jewellery Historians, which in 1991 published a volume of papers in his honour. Outside the museum, his most abiding association was with the British School of Archaeology at Athens, which called in his expertise to publish important finds from its current excavations: Greek terracottas from the Sanctuary of Demeter at Knossos (1973), and early Greek gold jewellery from Lefkandi in Euboea (1980). From 1975 to 1979 he served as chairman of the school's managing committee.<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1977, Higgins's talent as a lively speaker continued to bring him numerous invitations to give lectures to specialist, student, and lay audiences. He delivered the prestigious series of Norton lectures in the USA and Canada in 1982&#150;3, and was a frequent lecturer on Swan Hellenic cruises until 1991. During his last years he resumed work in the British Museum on the final volume of his terracotta <span class="italic">Catalogue</span>, devoted to the Hellenistic period. Although it was still incomplete when he died, he had prepared the way for this volume in his last published book, <span class="italic">Tanagra and the Figurines</span> (1986), a charming and humane study of the best-known aspect of Hellenistic terracottas.<br>
<br>Higgins possessed a rare combination of qualities: an intense striving after accurate scholarship coupled with a lively gift for communicating his expertise with wit and charm. For him, the British Museum was never an ivory tower; indeed, few museum scholars have reached such a worldwide readership and audience. The last year of his life was plagued by ill health, but cancer was diagnosed only three weeks before his death, in Dunsfold, Surrey, on 18 April 1993. He was cremated on 21 April at Guildford, and was survived by his wife and children.<br>
