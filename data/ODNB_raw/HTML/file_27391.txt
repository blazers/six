<span class="headword">Throckmorton,  Job</span>  (1545&#150;1601), <span class="occ">politician and religious pamphleteer</span>, was the eldest of the seven sons (and brother of seven daughters) of Clement Throckmorton (<i>c</i>.1515&#150;1573) of Haseley, Warwickshire, third son of Sir George Throckmorton of Coughton, Warwickshire, and of his wife, Katherine Neville, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19930/', "Sir Edward Neville")</script>, courtier, and the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70831/', "Sir Henry Neville")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70825/', "Henry VIII, privy chamber of")</script>]. Haseley was acquired after the attainder of John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, when Michael Throckmorton, Clement's uncle and secretary to Cardinal Pole, secured the property from the crown and sold it to his nephew. The numerous Throckmortons were divided in religion. Sir George was a conservative opponent of Henry VIII, and his eldest son, Sir Robert, followed in that tradition, as did a younger brother John, father of Francis Throckmorton, the traitor executed in 1584. But the fourth of Sir George's sons, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, the diplomat, was a protestant, while the commitment of Job's father, Clement, to the evangelical cause was more pronounced. He was close to his Warwickshire cousin, the hot protestant courtier Edward Underhill, and a friend of the Essex gentleman, courtier, and Marian martyr Thomas Haukes. In 1567 Clement was one of the midland gentry who administered funds to maintain &#145;preachers of the Gospel&#146; in Warwickshire under the terms of a patent procured by the earl of Leicester. It was this tradition that Job Throckmorton inherited, and it must have been reinforced by Oxford, where he graduated BA in February 1566. His college is unknown, but two of his sons and two grandsons were at Queen's. Throckmorton may have proceeded to the inns of court, but of this there is no record, although two brothers and two sons were at the Middle Temple.<br>
<br>When Clement Throckmorton died on 13 December 1573, Job inherited a debt-burdened estate. He was never a county magnate, and but for the cause of religion would be a historical nonentity. He was returned to parliament for East Retford in 1572 (the earl of Rutland, a relative, would have seen to that), but there is no evidence that he spoke or sat on committees. January 1584 witnessed his only recorded intervention in local politics which concerned, significantly, Catholicism. Under an order from the privy council Throckmorton investigated the activities of William Skynner, a recusant supporter of Mary, queen of Scots, and &#145;a deadely enemye to the gospell&#146;. Throckmorton expressed his frustration at the reluctance of witnesses to testify: &#145;Our papistes heere are woondrous cunning&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/167/21). Yet, as is revealed by the diary kept by his cousin, Sir Nicholas's son Arthur Throckmorton, blood was thicker than religious bile when it came to social civilities within the confessionally divided Throckmorton clan.<br>
<br>In October 1586 parliament met at a moment of extraordinary interest to all earnest protestants. Its primary purpose was to decide the fate of Mary Stewart in the aftermath of the Babington plot. But England was now effectively at war with Spain in the Netherlands, which for hot protestants was a war of religion. And the organized puritan movement saw an opportunity to renew its agitation on behalf of the godly preaching ministry, and even to bring about a presbyterian revolution in the church. Job Throckmorton prepared speeches on all three topics. But first he had to find a parliamentary seat. The way in which this was contrived makes the most remarkable story in Elizabethan electoral history, for Throckmorton was returned for Warwick by means of what can only be called a conspiracy. Backed by powerful outside interests (which must have included the earl of Leicester, who had made Thomas Cartwright master of his hospital in the town), and threatening to exploit the popular franchise, which he treated at a &#145;solemn dinner&#146; for as many as eighty voters, this blatant carpet-bagger enforced his adoption as a burgess, even while it was well known that his motive in seeking election was not to serve the interests of the borough &#145;but for the parliament, where peradventure some friends of yours &hellip; may have some causes in handling&#146;  (Kemp, 390, 394).<br>
<br>Copies of Throckmorton's extraordinary parliamentary speeches are preserved in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. On 4 November 1586 he denounced Mary Stewart as &#145;the daughter of sedition, the mother of rebellion, the nurce of impietie&#146;. On 27 February he spoke on the presbyterian bill and book and echoed Peter Wentworth's speech of 1576 in a call for the widest possible definition of parliamentary free speech, offering a vigorous defence of what was called puritanism. &#145;I feare me we shall shortly to this, that to doe God and her Majestie good service shalbe coumpted puritanisme&#146;. But his greatest offence was offered four days earlier, when Throckmorton launched a gratuitous attack on England's &#145;popish&#146; neighbours, including the obnoxious &#145;litter&#146; and &#145;brood&#146; of Queen Catherine de' Medici, the &#145;idolatrous&#146; and &#145;lycentious&#146; king of Spain, and even &#145;the younge impe of Scotlande&#146;, his mother's son. &#145;No hope of Spayne, no trust in Fraunce, colde comforte in Scotlande&#146;  (Hartley, 229, 314, 280, 285). Lord Burghley had to apologize for this speech to James VI's London agent, and promised to clap Throckmorton in the Tower. But the offender made himself scarce, lying low in his sister's house in Hillingdon, whence he wrote a letter of grovelling submission to the lord treasurer.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1588 the radical puritan cause found a new voice in the rollicking, seditious satire of the Marprelate tracts. There is copious evidence that Throckmorton was up to his neck in this literary conspiracy. Most of the tracts were printed in Warwickshire, and Throckmorton was involved at every stage in their production. Comparison of the Marprelate tracts with his parliamentary speeches and with the only printed pamphlet to which he put his name (<span class="italic">The Defence of Job Throkmorton Against the Slaunders of Maister Sutcliffe</span>, 1594) has persuaded modern critical opinion that if these satires had a single author, that author was Throckmorton. The case is almost clinched by the attribution to Throckmorton of a tract called <span class="italic">Master Some Laid Open in his Coulers</span>, for whoever wrote that was surely Martin. Leland H. Carlson overstated the case by using somewhat shaky stylistic evidence to link Throckmorton with the authorship of as many as thirty anonymous puritan pamphlets, from 1572 onwards, which would make him almost a monopolist of radical puritan print. But Throckmorton may well have been responsible for a Martinesque &#145;Survey of the state of the ministry in Warwickshire&#146;, linked to the parliamentary campaign of 1586, with its characterization of the curate of Grafton, who may have married Shakespeare: &#145;His chiefest trade is to cure hawks that are hurt or diseased&#146;  (Peel, 2.167).<br>
<br>Although he stood trial in 1590 for his role in the Marprelate affair, and was widely suspected to be Martin, Throckmorton's social position and legal technicalities saved him from punishment, which for his co-conspirator, the Welsh pamphleteer John Penry, meant the gallows. Throckmorton's protestations &#145;I am not Martin, I knewe not Martin&#146;  (J. Throckmorton, <span class="italic">The Defence</span>, sig. Eii) were equivocations, for Martin did not exist.<br>
<br>Throckmorton's polemical pen remained active for a few more years, but he eventually reverted to an obscure and private life. The story that Throckmorton ended his days at Canons Ashby, Northamptonshire, undergoing treatment from the spiritual therapist John Dod, and that thirty-seven years of doubting his salvation culminated in an edifying deathbed performance, is apocryphal and arises from a confusion of identity. Throckmorton died suddenly, intestate, at Haseley in February 1601, survived by his wife, Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Vernon of Houndhill, Staffordshire. He was buried at Haseley on 23 February. His son Clement and grandson Clement were both in their times MP for Warwickshire.<br>
