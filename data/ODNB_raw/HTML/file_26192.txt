<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Squire,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1714, <em>d.</em> 1766), <span class="occ">bishop of St David's</span>, was baptized at Warminster, Wiltshire, early in 1714, the son of Thomas Squire (1687&#150;1761), apothecary in that town, and his wife, Susan (1686&#150;1758), the daughter of John Scott, rector of Bishopstrow. Squire was admitted pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, on 23 June 1730, promptly becoming Somerset scholar. In pursuing what his son later called a &#145;miscellaneous course of reading&#146;  (Squire, jun., handwritten biography in <span class="italic">Works</span>) Squire laid the foundations for the linguistic versatility of his mature years. Among the languages he studied, either formally or informally, were Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Icelandic, Old English, and Gothic. To defray some of the cost of his education he tutored other students, keeping careful tallies of his income and expenses in account books. Regarded by contemporaries as handsome in appearance and assiduous in his studies, Squire received his BA in 1734, won the Craven scholarship the same year, was elected a fellow of St John's in 1735, and completed his MA in 1737. He was created DD in 1749.<br>
<br>On leaving Cambridge, Squire determined upon a career in the church; but before assuming the responsibilities of a clerical appointment he took well over a year off for a tour&#151;not the grand tour of the continent so much in vogue in his day, but rather an exploration of Great Britain. In his later writings he displayed a dislike of things Scottish. Perhaps the prejudice arose during his hikes through&#151;the words come from 1747&#151;&#145;that land of mountains, barrenness &amp; rebellion&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 4318, fol. 266).<br>
<br>Squire launched his clerical career on Trinity Sunday 1739, when he was ordained deacon. His ordination as a priest came two years later, followed quickly by an appointment to the vicarage of Minting in Lincolnshire. He was now launched upon what one observer would later call his &#145;easy <i>track of preferment</i>&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 5831, fol. 164). In 1742 he left Cambridge for Wells, to serve as domestic chaplain to the bishop, Dr John Wynne. In 1743 he was appointed to the archdeaconry of Bath and the prebendal stall of Wanstraw in Wells Cathedral. In 1748 he became chaplain to the duke of Newcastle, and in 1749 he was appointed to the rectory of Topsfield in Essex; in 1750 he swapped Topsfield for St Anne's, Soho, and in 1751 he received the vicarage of Greenwich. In 1756 he was made clerk of the closet in the household of the prince of Wales, and in 1760 he was installed in the deanery of Bristol. Finally, on 24 May 1761, Squire reached the pinnacle of his ecclesiastical career when he was consecrated bishop of St David's. He openly assigned his promotion to the favour of the earl of Bute.<br>
<br>The chief reason why Squire's career carried him to the heights of the episcopal bench, however, was that he hitched his star to the court whigs in general and the duke of Newcastle in particular. The political realities of the Hanoverian age specified that a cleric ambitious for a successful ecclesiastical career should provide useful support for the whig cause. One important service Squire provided was political intelligence: from the late 1740s onwards he was the duke of Newcastle's chief source of information about political machinations at Cambridge University. But the most public of Squire's contributions to court whiggery were his five political essays, all products of the 1740s. In <span class="italic">Letter to a Young Gentleman of Distinction</span> (1740) he argued, against advocates of the militia, that only a standing army was sufficient for the protection of Britain in its quarrels with France and Spain. In <span class="italic">The Important Question Discussed</span> (1746) he skilfully defended the use of British troops on the European continent. In <span class="italic">A Letter to a Tory Friend</span> (1746), the most theoretical of his efforts, he affirmed the whig credentials of the Pelham ministry. The final two essays were directed against the conclusions of the Jacobite historian Thomas Carte. <span class="italic">Remarks upon Mr. Carte's Specimen</span> (1748) invoked natural law to undermine Carte's support for the house of Stuart; <span class="italic">A Letter to John Trot-Plaid</span> (1748) employed satire to mock Carte's tendency to interpret the past in terms of the present, a fault of which Squire, in his role as historian, may be adjudged equally guilty.<br>
<br>For in addition to careers as clergyman and pamphleteer Squire was a scholar of language and history. In 1741 he published <span class="italic">Inquiry into the Origin of the Greek Language</span>, arguing for the descent of Greek from Hebrew. He left in manuscript an incomplete grammar of the Saxon language. He lobbied for the study of Old English at Cambridge. He was also interested in the comparative study of ancient civilizations, publishing <span class="italic">Ancient History of the Hebrews Vindicated</span> (1741) as a defence of the historical accuracy of the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span> and translating and editing Plutarch's tract on Isis and Osiris (1744). Although a product of authentic enthusiasm, his scholarship may fairly be characterized as unoriginal.<br>
<br>In the mid-1740s Squire turned his attention to English constitutional history, publishing both <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Foundation of the English Constitution</span> (1745) and <span class="italic">Historical Essay upon the Balance of Civil Power in England</span> (1748). These explorations, drawing for their interpretive framework on an uneasy synthesis of the contract theory of John Locke, the republicanism of James Harrington, and the natural law teachings of Cicero, were detailed elaborations of the view of government he was simultaneously promoting in <span class="italic">A Letter to a Tory Friend</span>. Squire argued that the constitutional settlement after the revolution of 1688, which he characterized as &#145;perhaps the most perfect plan of civil empire, which can be invented&#146;  (Squire, 34), had recovered for England the spirit of the ancient Anglo-Saxon constitution: both basic frames, he believed, existed to defend liberty, property, and justice.<br>
<br>In the early 1750s Squire revisited the historical interpretations he had advanced in the 1740s and found their continuationism inconsistent with the growing weight of historical research into medieval England. Squire's effort to bring his whig vision of English history into closer co-ordination with this scholarship left him exposed to charges of internal inconsistency, and he abandoned historical writings for Christian apologetics, producing two works in his capacity as an instructor for the prince of Wales: <span class="italic">Indifference for Religion Inexcusable</span> (1758) and <span class="italic">The Principles of Religion Made Easy to Young Persons</span> (1763). Finally, also in 1763, he attached his memoir of Thomas Herring, archbishop of Canterbury, as an addendum to a book of sermons by the late prelate. Squire's standing as a scholar of language and history was twice recognized, first in 1746 when he was elected fellow of the Royal Society, and then in 1748 when he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.<br>
<br>On 13 May 1752, safely in possession of the living at Greenwich, Squire had married Charlotte, daughter of Thomas Ardesoif of Soho Square. The couple had four children. It was the youngest of them, born in 1764 and also named Samuel, who in 1817 authored the hand-written biography of his father that graced the edition of Squire's works now in the British Library. Samuel Squire the elder died in Harley Street, London, on 7 May 1766; his widow died on 12 April 1771. Three of his children survived him.<br>
<br>To many contemporaries Squire was a symbol of the avaricious climber, personifying pluralism with his startling accumulation of clerical offices. William Warburton drew on this reputation in his famous comparison of Squire with the political economist Josiah Tucker: &#145;One of them made Trade his Religion; the Other Religion his Trade&#146;  (Nichols, 2.55). But throughout his life Squire was known privately as a generous man, and by late in his career he was behaving in ways quite consistent with an ecclesiastical calling, even earning some grudging commendations for conscientiousness. It is perhaps fair to conjecture that historians, attending chiefly to his enemies when stressing his careerism, have judged Squire somewhat too harshly.<br>
