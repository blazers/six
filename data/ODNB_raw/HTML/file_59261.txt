<span class="headword">Artom,  Benjamin</span>  (1835&#150;1879), <span class="occ">rabbi</span>, was born in Asti, Piedmont, Italy, the son of Elia Artom, scion of a well-known and talented Jewish family which probably originated from Germany. Artom trained as a rabbi, and held a number of rabbinical posts in Italy; he was the first to hold the post of rabbi of Naples. In 1866 he accepted a call to become the spiritual leader, or <i>haham</i> (chief rabbi, literally &#145;wise man&#146;), of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews in London, a post he retained until his death. On 10 February 1875 in London Artom married a thirty-year-old widow, Henrietta Hababa David (<i>d</i>. 1921), the daughter of David Esekiel.<br>
<br>The community to which Artom moved was historically the oldest congregation of Jews in Britain, and worshipped in an imposing synagogue built at the beginning of the eighteenth century in Bevis Marks in the City of London. The community contained within it some of the most important Anglo-Jewish families, notably the Montefiores, also of Italian origin; Moses Montefiore bestrode Anglo-Jewry like a colossus, but his intolerance of religious &#145;reformers&#146;, though shared by other members of the congregation, had led to schism. Many families had left Bevis Marks to join the West London Synagogue established by reformers in 1842; others married out of the faith. The previous <i>haham</i>, Raphael Meldola (who was also Italian), had died in 1828. The failure of the community to replace him reflected its spiritual and demographic decline.<br>
<br>During the 1850s and 1860s, when the major Ashkenazi synagogues in London were contemplating amalgamation, the Bevis Marks congregation came under pressure to incorporate itself within this amalgamation, and to recognize the Ashkenazi chief rabbi, Nathan Marcus Adler, as its spiritual head. The appointment of Artom was in some measure the response of Bevis Marks to these overtures. Artom trod a difficult and delicate path. He needed to maintain the independent status of the community of which he was the head, revive its flagging fortunes, but at the same time remain on good terms with the Ashkenazi majority. He achieved all these ends.<br>
<br>On his arrival in London Artom knew no English, and he delivered his first sermon in French; later, however, his mastery of English was such that his sermons were published in book form (1873). Artom was also a talented musician, and introduced new melodies as well as new prayers into the liturgy of Bevis Marks. He extended the influence of the congregation beyond its own confines. In 1870 he agreed to consecrate a new synagogue erected by the community of Dutch Jews in the City of London (after Nathan Adler had refused to do so), and two years later gave his blessing to the establishment of the first Sephardi synagogue in Manchester. In 1877 he further demonstrated the independence of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews by agreeing to accept converts into Sephardi Judaism in England. Artom died suddenly on 6 January 1879 at 3 Marine Parade, Brighton, aged forty-four, and was buried that day.<br>
