<span class="headword">Dod,  Peirce</span>  (1683&#150;1754), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born probably at Hackney, Middlesex, the fourth of the five sons of John Dod, citizen and mercer of London, and of his wife, Mary, daughter of Richard Thorowgood, alderman of London  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl., 4, fol. 276; D. Lysons, <span class="italic">The Environs of London</span>, 4 vols., 1792&#150;6, 2.471). Dod matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford, on 19 March 1697, and graduated BA on 14 October 1701. He was elected a fellow of All Souls in 1703, and graduated MA on 6 June 1705, MB on 22 March 1710, and MD on 29 October 1714. He was admitted a candidate of the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1719, and a fellow on 30 September 1720; he was Goulstonian lecturer in 1720, Harveian orator in 1729 (his oration was published at London in the same year), and censor in 1724, 1732, 1736, and 1739. He was appointed physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital on 22 July 1725, and continued in that office until his death. He became a fellow of the Royal Society on 19 March 1730, and contributed two papers to the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>.<br>
<br>Dod and his wife, Elizabeth, had four children, Peirce (<i>d</i>. 1797), Jacky, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1802), and another daughter, who died in Dod's lifetime. The eldest son, Peirce, was vicar of Godmersham, Kent, from 1772 to 1778.<br>
<br>Dod was a steady opponent of smallpox inoculation, and sought to discredit the new practice in a little work entitled <span class="italic">Several cases in physick, and one in particular, giving an account of a person who was inoculated for the small-pox &hellip; and yet had it again</span> (1746). This pamphlet presents nine case histories, only one of which addresses inoculation. In that particular case, a boy of three was inoculated and two years later, at the age of five, he contracted natural smallpox. Dod concluded from this single incident that inoculation did not provide effective protection against smallpox. Dod did not witness this case personally; it was reported to him in a letter from a Dr Brodrepp, a name which came to be satirized in <span class="italic">A letter to the real and genuine Pierce Dod, MD, exposing the low absurdity of a late spurious pamphlet falsely ascrib'd to that learned physician: with a full answer to the mistaken case of a natural small-pox, after taking it by inoculation, by Dod Pierce, MS</span> (1746). According to Munk, the authors of this letter&#151;which is said to have done considerable damage to Dod's professional reputation and practice&#151;were Dr J. Kirkpatrick, author of <span class="italic">The Analysis of Inoculation</span>, Dr W. Barrowby, and Dr I. Schomberg. They dismissed Dod's narrative first by pointing out that occasionally an individual succumbed to natural smallpox twice, and by contending that the boy's illness at the age of five was probably not smallpox. They implied that Dod opposed inoculation because it cost him business, and described Dod as &#145;This delirious Scribbler &hellip; violently infected with the itch of Authorism&#146;  (Lawrence, 223).<br>
<br>Dod died at his house in Red Lion Square, London, on 6 August 1754 (Munk wrongly gives the date as 18 August). He was buried in the ground of St George the Martyr, Queen Square. In the church is an altar tomb to his memory.<br>
