<span class="headword">Norton,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1654, <em>d.</em> 1702), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was the second son of Sir George Norton (<i>d</i>. 1677) of Abbots Leigh, Somerset, and Ellen, daughter of Sir William Owen of Condover in Shropshire. Norton's father, the ward of Sir John Strangeways, remained neutral during the civil war but did conceal Prince Charles at his house during the battle of Worcester, for which he was rewarded with a knighthood following the Restoration. In the late 1670s and early 1680s Edward Norton was active in London whig circles. He joined the notorious <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script> and signed the May 1679 whig petition presented to the court of aldermen, which affirmed belief in the Popish Plot and called for a parliament to preserve the king and the protestant religion. He also stood for Westbury, Wiltshire, in 1679 on the interest of his brother-in-law, William Trenchard, unseating a court supporter on petition.<br>
<br>In September 1681 Norton was summoned before the privy council along with the whig barrister John Ayloffe on charges of suborning a government informer. In November 1681 he led a noisy demonstration in London celebrating the earl of Shaftesbury's acquittal by a Middlesex grand jury in which the mob shouted, &#145;no Popish successor, no York, a Monmouth, a Buckingham&#146; and &#145;God bless the earl of Shaftesbury&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 581). Norton was part of the lower circle of Rye House conspirators in 1682&#150;3 along with Nathaniel Wade, Robert West, Robert Ferguson, and John Rumsey. Secretary Jenkins believed that Norton had a &#145;very deep hand in that treason&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>Jan&#150;June 1683</i>, 353). Following the plot's discovery in June 1683 Norton hid in London, where he lay wounded from &#145;a Whig and Tory brawl&#146; and eventually escaped to the Netherlands  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July&#150;Sept 1683</i>, 11). On 26 June Secretary Jenkins issued a warrant for his arrest; his estate at Ashe, Dorset, was searched and some arms were discovered. Norton's estate was declared forfeit on 14 June 1684. While in exile Norton took the alias &#145;Mr Willoughby&#146; and associated with the various whigs and dissenters gathered around the duke of Monmouth and the earl of Argyll. At one point Norton was sent back to England to inform the earl of Macclesfield of Monmouth's coming and to tell his brother Sir George Norton to prepare in Cheshire. Fellow conspirator Elizabeth Gaunt was responsible for his safe travel to and from London.<br>
<br>Following the failure of Monmouth's rebellion (in which he did not participate), Norton was seen in the company of Robert Ferguson, Monmouth's army chaplain, and was supposedly lodging with him in Amsterdam. At one point Norton was joined by his brother Sir George, who had been in France. In 1686 Norton returned to England; he received a pardon on 10 June on the petition of his brother and on 12 November the outlawry against him was reversed. In November 1688 he readily joined the prince of Orange and received a commission in Captain Lord Mordaunt's regiment. Norton remained in the army from 1691 to 1699 as a major of marines. He was buried at Highgate in November or December 1702. He never married. In his will, dated 8 November 1702, he left 40<i>s</i>. to his sister Ellen. She had married William Trenchard of Cutteridge, and they eventually inherited the Norton family property. Their eldest son was John Trenchard, who co-authored <span class="italic">Cato's Letters</span> and the <span class="italic">Independent Whig</span>.<br>
