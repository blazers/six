<span class="headword">Lovetot, Sir  John  de</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1236, <em>d.</em> 1294), <span class="occ">administrator and justice</span>, was a younger son of the Richard de Lovetot (<i>d</i>. 1235), who was lord of one-third of the Huntingdonshire barony of Southoe, and his wife, Christine, who survived him. John cannot therefore have been born later than 1236. He was probably the John de Lovetot who acted as bailiff of the escheated honour of Peverel of Nottingham from 1258 to 1260 or 1261, while in 1263&#150;4 he was one of four men who administered the county of Yorkshire in opposition to its royalist sheriff. In the late 1260s he was an under-sheriff in Norfolk, and in the early 1270s successively steward of Norwich Cathedral priory and in the service of Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford, again possibly as his steward. By 1269 he had been knighted.<br>
<br>Lovetot may have owed his entry into royal service to Robert Tiptoft or Tibetot (<i>d</i>. 1298), whom he represented when Tiptoft went on crusade with the future Edward I in 1270. He had certainly entered Edward's service by 1274, when he was appointed joint custodian of the vacant see of Durham. Lovetot was appointed a justice of the common bench in Easter term 1275, and the formal records of the court show him serving as a justice continuously until the end of 1289. He is, however, known to have been sent abroad by the king on at least eight different occasions during these years, both on diplomatic missions and on commissions concerning the administration of Ponthieu, in northern France, and these overseas journeys caused him to miss part or all of several law terms. Lovetot was also active during the same period as an assize and gaol delivery justice, and managed to find time to fulfil duties as one of the trusted servants of Edward's wife, Queen Eleanor.<br>
<br>Lovetot was disgraced early in 1290 with his judicial colleagues, for failing to prevent the chief justice of the court, Thomas Weyland (<i>d</i>. 1298), from altering the record of a case heard in the court. Between June 1290 and October 1293 he paid the fine of &pound;1000 that had secured his release from the Tower of London. In 1293 he was committed to the Tower for a second time, perhaps for misconduct in the service of Queen Eleanor, and only released for a second fine of 1000 marks.<br>
<br>John de Lovetot's first wife, Margaret, was the daughter of Robert d'Eyville and his wife, Denise. They were certainly married by 1268 and she died in the late 1280s. His second wife, Joan, daughter of William of Standon, had previously been married to Bartholomew de Briaunzon. This marriage probably took place in 1290 or 1291. Lovetot had at least four sons and three daughters, probably all with his first wife. He died shortly before 5 November 1294. In 1301 his son and heir, also John, alleged that Lovetot had been murdered at the instigation of Walter Langton, bishop of Coventry (<i>d</i>. 1321). The younger John claimed that Langton had been conducting an adulterous relationship with his stepmother, Joan, who died about August 1302, but although proceedings continued until 1303, he was unable to prove his allegations.<br>
