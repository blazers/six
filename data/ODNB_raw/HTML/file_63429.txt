<span class="headword">Forbes,  James <span class="st"> [Jacob]</span></span>  (1580&#150;1656), <span class="occ">merchant and army officer in the Swedish service</span>, was the eldest son of Henry Forbes (<i>d</i>. 1605), a soldier, of Thainstone and Margaret Forbes, eldest daughter of William Forbes of Corse and Susanna Stauchan. James was born in Thainstone, Aberdeen and probably arrived in Sweden with his father and brother Peter (also known as Patrick) about 1600. Henry Forbes served in the Swedish army under Karl IX and was killed in September 1605 at the battle of Kirkholm in Livonia. Peter moved to Sch&ouml;newalds in Prussia where, in 1634, he served as the factor for the Swedish forces in Germany. James Forbes remained in Sweden after his father's death and went on to become a merchant for Gustav II Adolf. By August 1624 he received all the privileges of a burgess of Stockholm when he became a citizen there.<br>
<br>Perhaps surprisingly for a man of forty-six, James Forbes (who was known as Jacob in Sweden) decided to enter military service. The motivation behind the career change remains unclear. None the less he enlisted as a private in the Narke&#150;V&auml;rmlands regiment in 1626 and in the following year he was promoted lieutenant. This rapid rise in rank is suggestive of some earlier military experience although there is as yet no evidence for this. Forbes's progress through the ranks continued and by 1628 he became a captain for a company of V&auml;rmlanders before transferring to the S&ouml;dermanlands regiment in 1628 or 1629. During this period Forbes had occasion to undertake business with the Riksr&aring;d (the Swedish state council) in his capacity as a burgess of Stockholm. These matters, which showed that he maintained his civic and trading interests, included inquiries regarding shipping and complaints against the overvaluation of Swedish currency.<br>
<br>Forbes applied to Charles I for evidence of his noble origins which would allow him to become ennobled in Sweden. A letter from Charles I authenticating the nobility of &#145;Jacob and Patrick Forbes de Thainstone&#146; dated 1629 still survives in the library in the city of Lund. James's application for ennoblement in Sweden proved successful. In 1630 the Riksr&aring;d prepared an open letter on Forbes's behalf and the year 1631 saw him naturalized, ennobled and introduced into the Swedish nobility. Things progressed at a slower pace for Peter Forbes, who did not become naturalized as a Swedish nobleman until March 1651.<br>
<br>Despite his elevation in Swedish society there is some evidence to suggest that James Forbes found himself in conflict with Colonel Alexander Forbes, master of Forbes. A letter of recommendation for Alexander Forbes addressed to Queen Kristina in January 1636 contains reference to a dispute between Alexander and a James Forbes already in Swedish service. The details are not given, only that the dispute is a private matter which the master of Forbes hoped the queen could help resolve. No evidence has been found that there was any other James Forbes of sufficient status to warrant a request for royal intervention.<br>
<br>James Forbes remained active in the Swedish army despite his increasing years. In 1647 he served as a colonel for one of the few recruited Scottish regiments still in Swedish service, probably that of his kinsman William Forbes. The treaty of Westphalia in 1648 reduced the need for military commanders within Sweden. By the time of renewed hostilities against Poland in 1655 Forbes was well beyond his military prime. He died on 17 June 1656 in Lund after a distinguished civic and military career. A tomb decorated with his coat of arms was erected for his body in Funbo church in Lund. James married Lillieram Chesnecopherus although the date of their wedding has not been established. Their children included Peter, Olof, Jacob and Henrik (twins), Johan, Nils, and at least four daughters. They in turn had children, and the military muster rolls and university matriculation records of Sweden and Finland are replete with the names of the progeny of James Forbes of Thainstone.<br>
