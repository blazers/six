<span class="headword">Southgate,  Richard</span>  (1729&#150;1795), <span class="occ">numismatist</span>, was born at Alwalton, Huntingdonshire, on 16 March 1729, the eldest of ten children of William Southgate (<i>d</i>. 1771), farmer, and his wife, Hannah Wright (<i>d</i>. 1772), daughter of Robert Wright, canal engineer. He went to schools in Uppingham and Fotheringhay, where he began to display a retentive memory and taste for study, and to Peterborough grammar school. Thence in 1745 he went as an exhibitioner to St John's College, Cambridge, under Thomas Rutherforth, and graduated BA in 1749. Through great economy he was able to begin collecting books and coins, of the latter only specimens in the finest condition.<br>
<br>After taking holy orders in 1752, Southgate became curate of Weston, Lincolnshire. He was elected a member of the nearby Spalding Gentlemen's Society on 24 May 1753. From 1754 he held the rectory of Woolley, Huntingdonshire, during the minority of the patron, who was himself intended for the church. Southgate resigned in 1759, although under no obligation to do so. He then served the curacies successively of Upton and Leighton Bromswold, Wootton and Wykeham, Coveney and Maney, Godmanchester, Louth, Raithby, Tathwell and Calkwell, and Doddington and Newnham in Kent; but the want of books and persons of literature in country villages were insurmountable objects to improving his knowledge. In 1763, having been recommended to the rector of St James's, Westminster, he was appointed one of his subcurates, and, on Christmas day 1765, curate of St Giles-in-the-Fields, a post he held until his death.<br>
<br>As a parish priest Southgate was indefatigable in his attendance on the poor, in the cellars or the garrets of St Giles's, at any hour of the day or night. Occasionally he was imposed upon; but a contemporary observed that the poorest of his Irish parishioners, although Roman Catholics, treated him with good manners which they paid no one else  (Reid, 51&#150;2). He inherited an estate in Whitechapel worth &pound;100 p.a., and in addition to St Giles's he was presented by the duke of Ancaster in 1783 to the rectory of Little Steeping, which he exchanged in 1790 for the living of Warsop, worth &pound;1400 p.a. He was thus able to enlarge both his collecting and his charity, and to give away almost double what he received from St Giles's, including on one occasion his last shirt but one.<br>
<br>Southgate's main areas of collecting were Anglo-Saxon coins, English town pieces and tradesmen's tokens, of which he formed a collection superior to any in the kingdom, and dollars of the world, from which he acquired his knowledge of the history of Europe. On 3 November 1784 he was appointed assistant librarian at the British Museum, succeeding Andrew Gifford in responsibility for the coins and medals. He was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 6 June 1793, and was a member also of the Linnean Society.<br>
<br>Southgate advised William Hunter on Anglo-Saxon coins. He collected material for a treatise on the history of the Saxons and Danes in England, illustrated by their coins, but his progress in it was retarded by his diffidence  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 6.112). Among the contributions he did make was a plate of coins struck at Leicester, printed in J. Nichols's <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester</span>. The Revd Rogers Ruding stated that from Southgate's collection he first derived a practical knowledge of the English coinage, that his &#145;entertaining and instructive conversations&#146; led Ruding to study English coins historically, and that by Southgate's encouragement he was induced to prepare for publication his great <span class="italic">Annals of the Coinage</span>  (Ruding, 1.xix). Ruding illustrated about 200 Anglo-Saxon coins in Southgate's collection, the importance of which has been discussed by J. S. Martin and H. E. Pagan.<br>
<br>Southgate was 5 feet 10 inches tall, very upright, latterly corpulent, of a cheerful disposition, active in mind yet slow and inactive in body. He died apparently unmarried, of &#145;an asthmatical and dropsical complaint&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 171&#150;2) at his residence in the British Museum on 21 January 1795. He was buried on 3 February in St Giles-in-the-Fields, where a memorial tablet by John Hinchliffe the younger was placed on the south-east pillar. Southgate's <span class="italic">Sermons Preached to Parochial Congregations</span>, with a biographical preface by George Gaskin, was published in 1798. He left no will, and his property went to five surviving brothers. His &#145;elegant and valuable library&#146; was sold by Leigh and Sotheby from 27 April to 9 May 1795, for &pound;1,332 12<i>s.</i>, and his small collection of shells and other natural curiosities on 12&#150;13 May. The sale of his coins was planned for May, but the whole collection was purchased by Samuel Tyssen for 1800 guineas before the sale, with the resulting duplicates being auctioned in July. Southgate became thereby a source for the British Museum collection of coins, and the Anglo-Saxon coins from his collection have subsequently been identified by Martin.<br>
