<span class="headword">Barlow,  Hannah Bolton</span>  (1851&#150;1916), <span class="occ">ceramicist</span>, was born on 2 November 1851 at Church End House, Little Hadham, Hertfordshire, the seventh of nine children of Benjamin Irlam Barlow (1813&#150;1866), bank manager, and his Quaker wife, Hannah Bolton (1816&#150;1882). As she grew up in rural Hertfordshire and Essex, Hannah Barlow acquired a love of nature, particularly animals, which inspired her art. After attending Lambeth School of Art and Design in London in 1868, she was briefly employed at Minton's art pottery studio in Kensington Gore. In 1871 she joined the Doulton art pottery in Lambeth founded by the industrialist Sir Henry Doulton. Hannah's work in the sgraffito technique, incised drawing, either directly on to the clay body or through applied slip (liquid clay), was instrumental in the success of Doulton ware, relief-decorated saltglazed stoneware pottery. Her etched designs featured, more usually in a reserved frieze or panel, on vases, jugs, and bowls. Collaborators sometimes included her siblings also employed by Doulton: Arthur (1845&#150;1879), whose early death cut short a promising future, and her younger sisters, Florence, who specialized in <i>p&acirc;te-sur-p&acirc;te</i> painting of birds, and Lucy, a relief border decorator. While her sketchbooks (now in the Sir Henry Doulton Gallery, Stoke-on-Trent) include humorous anthropomorphic compositions, Hannah's ceramic subjects are naturalistic and unsentimental, mainly of domestic livestock and pets and occasionally wild animals. Human figures feature rarely. John Sparkes, the Lambeth School of Art's principal, wrote:<blockquote>She possesses a certain Japanese facility of representing the largest amount of fact in the fewest lines, all correct, and all embodying in a high degree the essential character of her subject. (Sparkes)</blockquote>Sometimes she painted on other Doulton ceramic wares: Faience, Crown Lambeth, and Carrara, and in <i>p&acirc;te-sur-p&acirc;te</i>. Occasionally she decorated plaques and tiles and more rarely modelled in high relief.<br>
<br>A prolific artist, whose style changed little during her long employment, Hannah Barlow produced an estimated 1000 unique pieces annually until her retirement as head of studio in 1913. From 1871&#150;2 her work was shown at major national and international exhibitions, winning many awards. Her watercolour paintings were included in &#145;Studio Notes&#146;, the Doulton art pottery's manuscript in-house magazine, during the 1880s, when the Royal Academy also exhibited a number of her high-relief terracotta animal sculptures. Hannah was famed for her unusual menagerie which included a tame fox, Simon, and a &#145;black mountain sheep answering to the euphonious name of Lady Gwen Morris&#146;  (&#145;Lady artists: Miss Hannah Bolton Barlow&#146;, 215). A terracotta panel of Sir Henry Doulton and his artists, modelled <i>c</i>.1876 by George Tinworth (1843&#150;1913) above the old Doulton art pottery on Lambeth High Street, includes Hannah and her pet cat.<br>
<br>Employment by Doulton &amp; Co. offered career possibilities for &#145;respectable&#146; middle-class women in Victorian times. As a successful artist and designer, signing her own work, Hannah Barlow represents one of the earliest female contributors to the British pottery industry. Her ceramic designs for Doulton exemplify the radical arts and crafts movement's advocacy of a return to individual craftsmanship in manufacture. Ruskin, on visiting the Lambeth pottery, selected a jug by Hannah &#145;with all the little piggies scurrying around under the handle&#146;  (Gosse, 85). Examples of her work are held in museum ceramic collections worldwide including the Sir Henry Doulton Gallery, Stoke-on-Trent; the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, Australia; National Museum of Tokyo, Japan; and the Smithsonian Institution, Washington.<br>
<br>Hannah Barlow died, unmarried, on 15 November 1916 at 46 Binfield Road, Clapham, London, and was buried in Norwood cemetery in south London on 20 November.<br>
