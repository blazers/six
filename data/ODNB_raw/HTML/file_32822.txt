<span class="headword">Dickson,  William Purdie</span>  (1823&#150;1901), <span class="occ">theologian and translator</span>, was the third son of George Dickson, Church of Scotland minister of Pettinain, and afterwards of Kilrenny, Fife, and his first wife, Mary Lockhart; he was born at Pettinain manse, Lanarkshire, on 22 October 1823. After attending Pettinain parish school and the grammar school at Lanark, he studied at St Andrews (1837&#150;44) for the ministry of the Church of Scotland. A high prizeman in Greek, at the Divinity Hall he gained in 1843 the Gray prize for an English essay. On 5 May 1845 he was licensed as a preacher by St Andrews presbytery, and he retained his first charge at Grangemouth, Stirlingshire, from 1846 to 1851. On 9 September 1851 Dickson was ordained minister of Cameron parish, St Andrews, where he remained until 1863. During this time Dickson lectured at the university, helped to reorganize the library, and was examiner for classics in 1861&#150;2. He was a lifelong friend of the principal John Tulloch. On 7 December 1853 Dickson married Tassie Wardlaw, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25734/', "John Small")</script>, the Edinburgh University librarian; they had two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>From 1863 to 1873 Dickson held the new chair of biblical criticism in Glasgow University, and from 1873 until his retirement in 1895 he was professor of divinity, having succeeded John Caird. His theology was unoriginal and he was critical of the new &#145;higher criticism&#146; influencing biblical scholarship. From 1866 to his death he was curator of Glasgow University Library, the post having been created for him; in this capacity he was responsible for the printing of a new catalogue, the rearrangement of the library according to subject, and the introduction of an alphabetic catalogue. He was president of the Library Association in 1888. From 1875 to 1888 he was the convener of the education committee of the Church of Scotland, but he twice declined nomination as moderator of the general assembly. He was made DD by both St Andrews (in 1864) and Glasgow University (in 1896) and honorary LLD by Edinburgh (in 1885). He was Church of Scotland Baird lecturer in 1883. While minister of Cameron, Dickson began the translation of Mommsen's <span class="italic">History of Rome</span> (1862&#150;6), with the author's permission. Mommsen reviewed the translation and added comments which are not in his original work. A second and revised edition appeared in 1895. Dickson's translation of Mommsen's <span class="italic">Provinces of the Roman Empire</span> followed in 1887. He also edited the translation of Meyer's <span class="italic">Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament</span> (10 vols., 1873&#150;80). In 1889 he published a pamphlet arguing against the proposals for universal free education, and he wrote other articles on the subjects of education and theology.<br>
<br>Dickson died at 16 Victoria Crescent, Glasgow, on 9 March 1901, and was buried in the Glasgow necropolis.<br>
