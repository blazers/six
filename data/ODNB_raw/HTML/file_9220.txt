<span class="headword">Fawcett,  John</span>  (1769&#150;1837), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, born in London on 29 August 1769, was the son of an actor, also <a name="cosubject_9220"></a><span class="headword">John Fawcett</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1793)<span class="occ"></span>, who came from High Wycombe. Fawcett senior was a pupil of Thomas Arne, and appeared at Drury Lane on 23 September 1760 as Filch in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>. He subsequently played minor parts at that theatre, at Covent Garden, and in Dublin, and died on 9 October 1793. He was described as being &#145;of more utility than note&#146;. When he was eight years old the younger Fawcett attracted the attention of Garrick, then on the point of quitting the stage, and conceived a hope of becoming an actor. To check this idea his father bound the boy, who had entered St Paul's School on 6 February 1776, as an apprentice to a linen draper in the City. When eighteen years of age Fawcett ran away to Margate, and under the name of Foote appeared as Courtall in Hannah Cowley's <span class="italic">The Belle's Stratagem</span>. From there he went under his own name to Tunbridge Wells. Recommended by Cumberland he joined Tate Wilkinson's company, and appeared at York as Young Norval on 24 May 1787. For some time he played Romeo, Oroonoko, and similar parts. Wilkinson, however, perceiving that tragedy was not his forte, with some difficulty induced him to attempt Jemmy Jumps in John O'Keeffe's musical farce <span class="italic">The Farmer</span>. Fawcett's success in this was so great that he elected subsequently to play in low comedy.<br>
<br>After the death of the comedian Mills in 1788, Fawcett married Mrs Mills, formerly a Miss More, an indifferent actress, who, under the name of Mrs Mills, had played Imogen at Drury Lane in 1783. Fawcett, who had risen in Yorkshire to the pinnacle of reputation, received an offer for himself and his wife from Thomas Harris of Covent Garden, who had just lost John Edwin. Thus, Fawcett's first performance in London was at Covent Garden, where he appeared on 21 September 1791, playing Caleb in <span class="italic">He would be a Soldier</span>. Ruttekin in <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span>, Jerry Sneak in Samuel Foote's <span class="italic">The Mayor of Garratt</span>, and other characters followed. In July 1794, as Young Pranks in John O'Keeffe's <span class="italic">The London Hermit</span>, he made his first appearance at the Haymarket, where he also played with success Edwin's great part of Lingo. He then renewed his engagement at Covent Garden. In conjunction with Joseph George Holman, Alexander Pope, and Charles Incledon, he gave at the Freemasons' Hall on the Wednesdays and Fridays of Lent 1795 an entertainment of reading and music. In March 1796, in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, he played, for Pope's benefit, Falstaff, in which he was held to eclipse all his contemporaries except George Frederick Cooke. Fawcett's wife died in August 1797, leaving a daughter. Between 1797 and 1802 Fawcett played at Covent Garden during the regular season, and for the summer months was at the Haymarket, of which house George Colman, in 1799, appointed him stage-manager. About this period Colman, with Fawcett in mind, began to write the pieces in which the actor's reputation was firmly established. The first of these was <span class="italic">The Heir-at-Law</span> (Haymarket, July 1797), in which, as Dr Pangloss, Fawcett carried away the town. Thereafter came <span class="italic">The Poor Gentleman</span> (Covent Garden, February 1801), in which he was Ollapod; <span class="italic">John Bull</span> (Covent Garden, March 1803), in which he played the part of Job Thornberry; and <span class="italic">Who Wants a Guinea?</span> (Covent Garden, April 1805), in which he was Solomon Gundy. He was also, at the Haymarket (July 1798), the original Caleb Quotem in <span class="italic">Throw Physic to the Dogs</span>, a character he repeated in September 1800, when Colman introduced it in <span class="italic">The Review, or, The Wags of Windsor</span>. In 1800 Fawcett took part with John Johnstone, Holman, Pope, Incledon, Joseph Munden, Thomas Knight, and H. E. Johnston in publishing a statement of the differences subsisting between the proprietors and performers of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. The case was referred to the lord chamberlain, who decided against the actors.<br>
<br>About this period, Fawcett became interested in pantomime and wrote <span class="italic">Obi, or, Three-Fingered Jack</span>, which was performed with great success at the Haymarket in July 1800, with Kemble as Obi and Emery Quashee; <span class="italic">Perouse, or, The Desolate Island</span> was derived from Kotzebue's play and performed at Covent Garden in February 1801. <span class="italic">The Brazen Mask, or, Alberto and Rosalie</span> was written with Charles Dibdin and performed at Covent Garden in 1802; it was followed by <span class="italic">The Fairies' Revels, or, Love in the Island</span>, acted by children at the Haymarket in the same year, and <span class="italic">The Enchanted Island</span>, a ballet based on <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, at the Haymarket in June 1804. <span class="italic">The Secret Mine</span>, written in conjunction with Thomas Dibdin, was a spectacular melodrama performed at Covent Garden in April 1812.<br>
<br>Fawcett left the Haymarket in 1802, only to reappear there from 1806 to 1808, when he left it finally. On 3 Cctober 1806 he married his second wife, Anne Gaudry, an actress who, after her marriage, retired from the stage and became a wardrobe-keeper at Covent Garden. With her he had two sons, one of whom became a clergyman, and a daughter. Fawcett's connection with Covent Garden lasted from his first appearance in 1791 to his retirement from the stage in 1830. Among his later creations, the part of Rolamo in Howard Payne's <span class="italic">Clari, the Maid of Milan</span> (May 1823) is noteworthy as revealing a serious aspect of his talents. He was also the original Bartholo to the Figaro of John Liston in Henry Bishop's version of <span class="italic">The Barber of Seville</span> (October 1818). In September 1829 Fawcett was superseded in the management of Covent Garden. Greatly chagrined he announced his intention of quitting the stage. A benefit was arranged for the actor, and on 30 May 1830, as Captain Copp, his original character, in Howard Payne's <span class="italic">Charles II</span>, he took, after speaking an address, his farewell of the public of the theatre in which he had been a main prop for thirty-nine years. With a salary of &pound;100 a year allowed him as treasurer and trustee of the Covent Garden Theatrical Fund he retired to a cottage at Botley, near Southampton. He was mainly instrumental there in bringing about the erection of a church in his immediate neighbourhood, of which he was churchwarden. He died of an inflammation caused by a hurt to his foot in walking on 12 March 1837, and was the first person to be buried in the church. Generally speaking, Fawcett was greatly respected. Leigh Hunt believed that no other actor could &#145;procure so much applause for characters and speeches intrinsically wretched&#146;, and Fawcett's Lord Ogleby, his Sir Peter Teazle, and his Touchstone ensured for him lasting fame even after his death.<br>
