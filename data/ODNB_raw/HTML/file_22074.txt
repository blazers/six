<span class="headword">Petyt <span class="st"> [Petit]</span>,  William</span>  (1640/41&#150;1707), <span class="occ">lawyer and political propagandist</span>, was born at Storiths, near Bolton Abbey, Skipton in Craven, Yorkshire, the son of William Petyt, a landowner and lawyer of Bolton Abbey and Barnard's Inn. He was educated at Skipton School and, according to the college's records, matriculated from Christ's College, Cambridge, in April 1660, aged nineteen. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 8 June 1660 and specially admitted to the Inner Temple on 25 November 1664 when he returned to London. Petyt was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in February 1671 and to the bench of the Inner Temple in 1689. Between 1701 and 1702 he was treasurer of the Inner Temple. His brother Silvester (<i>d</i>. 1719) also enjoyed a career in law, serving as principal of Barnard's Inn (1715).<br>
<br>Known throughout his adult life as an assiduous student of English historical records, Petyt learned at the feet of the high tory archivist and lawyer Fabian Philipps. But his own political inclinations ran in a different direction. By the late 1670s he had become an active proponent of excluding Charles II's brother, the Catholic James, duke of York, from the throne, and he counted among his close associates some of the most radical whigs of the period. Thus he was the friend, prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and legal adviser of Arthur Capel, earl of Essex, who committed suicide while imprisoned for alleged complicity in the Rye House Plot. This relationship gave him access to the group of people around Essex's friend the earl of Shaftesbury, including James Tyrrell and perhaps John Locke. Petyt's circle also included such like-minded whig lawyers as William Atwood, whom he tutored in the ways of the historical archives, and Sir George Treby and Sir Francis Pollexfen, whom he supplied with legal precedents in Charles II's <i>quo warranto</i> proceedings against the City of London. In addition, Petyt was in touch with Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, Henry Neville, William Post-Script Hunt, and Samuel Johnson&#151;all associated with spirited and sometimes violent opposition to the late Stuart kingship.<br>
<br>Petyt's reputation rested upon his polemical contributions to this opposition, and, in particular, his service to the radical ancient constitutionalist cause during the exclusion crisis and at the revolution of 1688. Indeed, his powerful briefs on its behalf made him one of the most highly valued&#151;and feared&#151;of whig writers. This particular ideology, which was based upon medieval chronicles and manufactured texts such as the so-called laws of St Edward the Confessor, the <span class="italic">Modus tenendi parliamentum</span>, and the <span class="italic">Mirror of Justices</span>, had grown out of the civil wars of the 1640s, where it served, along with theories of natural law, to justify rebellion, regicide, and the establishment of a republic. Ancient constitutionalist theorizing, to which Petyt fully subscribed, began with the assumption that the governmental arrangements of pre-Norman England were the same as those that existed in Stuart England.<br>
<br>Although modern scholarship has shown that this whiggish version of the past, based as it was on spurious texts such as St Edward's laws, the <span class="italic">Modus</span>, and the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>, was wrong, most sixteenth- and seventeenth-century writers found both its sources and its stories of institutional continuity credible. In the late 1670s and early 1680s, however, the ancient constitutionalist construction fell under serious attack, as tories scrambled to repair the damage it did to the principle of indefeasible hereditary succession. First came the publication of Sir Robert Filmer's <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span> (1679), which was soon followed by the republication of his <span class="italic">Freeholder's Grand Inquest</span> (1680). The <span class="italic">Freeholder's</span> proved particularly dangerous to the ancient constitutionalist cause because it presented a wide range of arguments against the antiquity of the House of Commons, including evidence that the earliest extant writ to the house dated from 1265. If this line of reasoning, which would soon be reinforced by the powerful polemics of the high-tory historian Dr Robert Brady, went unrefuted, the ancient constitution would lose its claim to antiquity and the Commons would forfeit its right to participate as an equal with the king and the House of Lords. Put differently, this particular tory version of English history seriously undermined the whig argument for excluding the future James II from the throne.<br>
<br>It was in this charged and risky ideological atmosphere that Petyt wrote his immensely influential <span class="italic">The Antient Right of the Commons of England Asserted</span> (1680). One of the most effective and powerful of the radical ancient constitutionalist tracts published in the late seventeenth century, the work was deemed sufficiently weighty to warrant extended response from Brady, and it was cited approvingly by whigs such as Atwood and Tyrrell throughout the rest of the Stuart period. In his tract Petyt turned to medieval chroniclers such as Matthew Paris, Roger Hoveden, and Henry Huntingdon, and, above all, to St Edward's laws, the <span class="italic">Modus</span>, and the <span class="italic">Mirror</span>, to make his case for a legally sovereign parliament that now possessed the power to alter the succession because it had anciently done so. Although there was nothing new in the story Petyt told, he presented his arguments for the ancient constitution in a particularly powerful and compelling manner. To the tory denial of the Commons' antiquity, Petyt responded that St Edward's laws told how St Edward collected and reformed &#145;the ancient Saxon laws and added new ones <i>a Rege, Baronibus, &amp; Populo</i>, that is, by king, barons, and people&#146;. Thus, concluded Petyt:<blockquote>it is apparent and past all contradiction that the Commons in those days were an essential part of the legislative power, in making and ordaining laws, by which themselves and their posterity were to be governed, and that the law was then the golden metwand and rule which measured out and allowed the prerogative of the prince and the liberty of the subject. (W. Petyt, <span class="italic">The Antient Right</span>, 1680, 11&#150;12)</blockquote>Nor was this arrangement changed in 1066 or its aftermath, for William I and his successors kept St Edward's laws alive through a series of confirmations made in the coronation oath and in <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. This historical evidence gave the lie to tory claims that a Norman conquest had obliterated Saxon laws and institutions. Indeed, what else could the repeated confirmations of Saxon laws mean other than:<blockquote>that in the British, Saxon, and Norman governments, the commons (as we now phrase them) had votes, and a share in the making and enacting of laws for the government of the kingdom, and that they were an essential part of the <i>Commune Concilium Regni</i>, WittenaGemot, or parliament, before and after the supposed conquest of William the First. (W. Petyt, <span class="italic">The Antient Right</span>, 1680, 73)</blockquote>Petyt also turned to the <span class="italic">Modus</span> and the <span class="italic">Mirror</span> to prove the high power of parliament and the king's subservience to the law made there. The <span class="italic">Mirror</span>'s message was particularly appropriate to his discussion of parliament's right to exclude the duke of York from the throne, for it told how &#145;parliaments were instituted <i>pur oyer &amp; terminer les plaintes de tort de la Roy, de la Roigne &amp; de lour Infans</i> &hellip; against whom the subject otherwise could not have common justice&#146;  (W. Petyt, <span class="italic">The Antient Right</span>, 1680, 40&#150;41). Since the reign of a Catholic king would surely wrong the people of England, parliament necessarily possessed the power to alter the succession. Moreover, this right was not merely theoretical. Indeed, Petyt wrote, it had been previously exercised on many occasions, as in, for example, the cases of William II, Henry I, and King John, who &#145;were elected kings of England having no hereditary right&#146;  (ibid., 46&#150;7).<br>
<br>Although Petyt wrote several other political tracts in which he argued the ancient constitutionalist position (<span class="italic">Miscellanea parliamentaria</span>, 1680; <span class="italic">The Pillars of Parliament Struck at by the Hands of a Cambridge Doctor</span>, 1681; <span class="italic">Jus parliamentum</span>, 1739), none came close to attaining the status of <span class="italic">The Antient Right</span>. Its persuasive power gave Petyt a presence at the revolution of 1688. He was called, along with the leading common lawyers and judges of the day, to give counsel about what had happened in 1688 and 1689. When queried by the Lords about the Commons' resolution concerning the original contract, most members of the long robe admitted that English law had little to say. Petyt was less reticent. Turning to the radical ancient constitutionalist version of history, he told the Lords that in Germanic and Saxon times kings, who were elected by people and parliament, swore an oath at their coronation to uphold the law. This practice continued after the Norman invasion and characterized their present governmental arrangements. Here in the oath, Petyt strongly implied, could be found the contract that bound kings to the law, a contract which James II had presumably broken.<br>
<br>Although the Convention Parliament eventually reached a compromise in which the <span class="roman">Bill of Rights</span> contained no mention of contract, the radical ancient constitutionalism that Petyt had so well articulated constituted a primary, though by no means the only, justification for the revolution settlement.<br>
<br>Petyt was duly rewarded for his service to the cause. On 25 July 1689 William III appointed him keeper of the Tower records, in which position he replaced Brady, the favourite historian of late Stuart kings. There Petyt &#145;reigned &hellip; as a respectable scholar until the end of his days&#146;  (Pocock, 229).<br>
<br>Petyt died, unmarried, on 3 October 1707 at Chelsea and was buried in the west part of the Temple Church. In his will he provided for the building of a library in the Inner Temple to house his enormous collection of manuscripts and tracts, but his brother Silvester removed about 2000 pieces to his Yorkshire home  (<span class="italic">A Catalogue of the Petyt Library at Skipton</span>, 1964). A monument to his memory and a portrait were placed in the Inner Temple.<br>
