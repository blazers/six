<span class="headword">Talbot,  Neville Stuart</span>  (1879&#150;1943), <span class="occ">military chaplain and bishop of Pretoria</span>, was born at Keble College, Oxford, on 21 August 1879, the second son and third child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36409/', "Edward Stuart Talbot (1844&#150;1934)")</script>, then warden of Keble College and later bishop of Winchester, and his wife, Lavinia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lyttelton (1849&#150;1939) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52031/', "Talbot, Lavinia")</script>], daughter of George William Lyttelton, fourth Baron Lyttelton. He was educated at Leeds grammar school from 1890 to 1892, and then from 1892 to 1899 at Haileybury College, where his uncle Edward Lyttelton was headmaster. In his teenage years he was strongly influenced by Henry Scott Holland, like Neville's father a contributor to <span class="italic">Lux mundi</span> (1889), the influential high-church essays which sought to reconcile traditional Christianity with science and philosophy.<br>
<br>On leaving school Talbot joined the rifle brigade and served as a lieutenant in South Africa during the South African War, taking part in the relief of Ladysmith. From 1902 to 1903 he was aide-de-camp to his uncle Sir Neville Lyttelton, commander-in-chief of the British forces in South Africa. In 1903 he went to Christ Church, Oxford, and read <i>literae humaniores</i>, taking a second-class degree in 1907. He became involved in the Student Christian Movement while at Oxford, and was an enthusiastic speaker at the Oxford Union, of which he was president in 1907.<br>
<br>After a year at Cuddesdon Theological College Talbot was made deacon at Ripon Cathedral on 14 June 1908, serving his title briefly as curate at Armley parish church, Leeds. Ordained priest in Lent 1909, he went to Balliol College, Oxford, as chaplain, fellow, and tutor. He contributed the introductory essay, &#145;The present situation&#146;, to <span class="italic">Foundations</span> (1912), edited by B. H. Streeter. Ronald Knox famously likened Talbot's theological optimism to an attempt to reconcile the antithetical views of Benjamin Jowett and Henry Manning.<br>
<br>Though Talbot was a popular college chaplain, the intellectual climate of Balliol did not wholly suit his robust, practical nature, and on the outbreak of war in August 1914 he volunteered for chaplaincy service in France, with his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72433/', "Edward Keble Talbot")</script>, later superior of the Community of the Resurrection, Mirfield. He was attached to the brigade field ambulance, and his frustration at not being allowed near the front led him to transfer to his old regiment, the rifle brigade. He is credited by some with forcing the army's eventual abandonment of the rule that forbade Anglican chaplains to accompany men on active operations. His younger brother, Gilbert, was killed in July 1915 at the battle of Hooge. He was wounded himself shortly afterwards and awarded the Military Cross in January 1916.<br>
<br>Based at Poperinghe in Belgium, Talbot co-founded Talbot House, named after his dead brother, with Philip (Tubby) Clayton, another army chaplain, in late 1915. Talbot House provided rest and recreation facilities for officers and men, and was the origin of Toc H, the international charity for peace and reconciliation. Talbot was appointed assistant chaplain-general to the Fifth Army in October 1916. He was a leading voice in the dissatisfaction of army chaplains with the ineffectiveness of the Church of England's ministry among the working men who composed the core of the British army in France.<br>
<br>On 13 April 1918 Talbot married his cousin Cecil Mary (1887&#150;1921), daughter of William Seymour Eastwood, barrister; a daughter, Elizabeth, was born in 1919 and a son, Gilbert, in 1921. At the end of the war he returned briefly to Balliol, but he was elected bishop of Pretoria in April 1920 and consecrated at St Paul's Cathedral on 24 June that year. Cecil died after giving birth to Gilbert, soon after their arrival in South Africa, and was buried in the cemetery of the convent of the Wantage Sisters at Irene. Talbot's episcopate was marked by controversy over the division of the diocese into two (creating the diocese of Johannesburg in 1922), and by his growing opposition to the discriminatory policies of the South African and provincial governments. When his health began to fail, he resigned his see in 1933 and returned to England to be vicar of St Mary's, Nottingham, and assistant bishop in the diocese of Southwell. He declined the bishopric of Croydon in 1942, and suffered a series of heart attacks in December that year. Convalescing at Backsettown, Henfield, Sussex, he died of heart failure on 3 April 1943. He was cremated in Brighton on 7 April, and his ashes buried in the churchyard of All Hallows Barking, London, the religious headquarters of Toc H.<br>
<br>Talbot was a huge, physical, and boisterous man&#151;6 foot 7 inches tall&#151;whose forceful personality and immense energy struck contemporaries. He was variously described as being physically magnificent, impetuous, unconstrained, and explosive in speech. These were valuable qualities in army chaplaincy and in South Africa. They were married to a rugged common sense. He could seem tactless, and was certainly fearless in his adoption of unpopular views. His chief legacy to the Church of England was his role in the founding of Talbot House at Poperinghe (where there is now a museum), and his influence among the small group of army chaplains whose sharp criticism of the failures of the pre-war church helped to shape the concern for social welfare that emerged under the leadership of William Temple between the two world wars.<br>
<br>Talbot's theology, and moderate Anglo-Catholicism, was characteristic of the socially committed incarnationalism of his father and Scott Holland and their friends, though he shared the ecumenical sensibilities of the early leaders of the Student Christian Movement. He wrote a number of small books, none of which was original in thought, but which were all clear and fresh expressions of his concern to relate Christian faith to the modern world. They include <span class="italic">The Mind of the Disciples</span> (1914), <span class="italic">Thoughts on Religion at the Front</span> (1917), <span class="italic">Thoughts on Unity</span> (1920), and <span class="italic">Great Issues: Studies in Reconciliation</span> (1936).<br>
