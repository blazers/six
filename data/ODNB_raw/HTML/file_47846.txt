<span class="headword">Lumley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fitzalan]</span>,  Jane</span>, Lady Lumley  (1537&#150;1578), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was the eldest child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9530/', "Henry Fitzalan, twelfth earl of Arundel (1512&#150;1580)")</script>, and his first wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1542), daughter of Thomas Grey, second marquess of Dorset, and his second wife, Margaret. She had two siblings: Henry, Lord Maltravers (1538&#150;1556), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47847/', "Mary Howard, duchess of Norfolk (1539/40&#150;1557)")</script>; and one stepbrother, John, son of her father's second wife, Mary, and her first husband, Robert Radcliffe, earl of Sussex. She married, as his first wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17179/', "John Lumley, first Baron Lumley (c.1533&#150;1609)")</script>, a university friend of her brother, probably by 1550 and certainly before 1553, when she attended Queen Mary's coronation as his wife. The couple then spent some time at Lumley's ancestral home, Lumley Castle in co. Durham, before joining Arundel's household at Nonsuch Palace in Surrey, where Jane nursed her father through considerable illness following the deaths of her brother in 1556, and both her sister and stepmother in 1557. Jane died at Arundel Place in London, predeceasing her father on 27 July 1578. Her funeral took place at St Clement Danes, the Strand, on 19 August. Her body was presumably reinterred by Lumley when he erected her tomb at Cheam in Surrey in 1596. Jane had two sons and one daughter, who all died in childhood.<br>
<br>Jane Lumley's considerable learning was made possible by her father's particular care to educate all of his children, allowing his daughters to continue their studies at home when, unlike their brother, they could not pursue them at university. Partly to this end, the twelfth earl of Arundel built up an impressive library and offered patronage to scholars and practitioners of the arts. His library, which passed to Jane's husband on Arundel's death and is therefore known as the Lumley Library, was the means by which Jane's work was preserved. As well as housing the books that she collected, it was the repository for her manuscript translations. When the library passed into royal ownership in 1609, Jane's work became part of what is now the British Library. BL, Royal MS 15 A. i and ii are Latin translations selected from the orations of Isocrates, as are folios 2&#150;62 of Royal MS 15 A. ix, with the exception of two Latin dedications to her father on folios 4 and 23. Most significant, however, are folios 63&#150;97, which contain <span class="italic">Iphigenia at Aulis</span>, her English translation from Euripides. This work has the distinction of being both the first translation of one of Euripides' plays into English, and also the earliest piece of extant English drama by a woman.<br>
