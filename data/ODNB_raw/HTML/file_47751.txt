<span class="headword">Savarkar, Vinayak Damodar</span>  (1883&#150;1966), <span class="occ">Hindu nationalist</span>, was born on 28 May 1883 in Bhagur village (near Nasik, then part of the Bombay presidency), the second of four children of Damodarpant and Radhabai. He had two brothers, Ganesh and Narayan, and a sister, Mainabai, and belonged to a Chitpavan Brahman family with some ancestral property and a reputation for Sanskrit learning. Savarkar was educated at Shivaji high school, Nasik, and Ferguson College, Poona, before going to London to study law in 1906, and married in 1901 Mai, daughter of a minister of the petty princely state of Jawhar near Nasik.<br>
<br>Savarkar grew to maturity in a high-caste Hindu milieu where traditions of Maratha Hindu valour under Shivaji and his Peshwa successors against Mughal rulers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were being constructed to provide sustenance for an emergent nationalism, within which anti-British and anti-Muslim strands commingled in varying proportions. Aged ten, after hearing about a Hindu&#150;Muslim riot in a distant part of India, Savarkar led schoolfriends in an attack upon a neighbouring mosque. He became well known, however, as a fervent anti-British patriot from about 1900 onwards, organizing the Mitra Mela revolutionary secret society in the Bombay presidency (it was renamed Abhinava Bharat&#151;Young India&#151;in 1905), and translating the works of the Italian nationalist Mazzini into Marathi. In England from 1906 to 1910, Savarkar tried to send bomb manuals to Indian revolutionaries from London, and celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the 1857 rebellion as a prime example of united struggle against British rule: it was the subject of his first book, <span class="italic">The First Indian War of Independence</span>, which was immediately banned. Extradited to India in 1910 for his alleged role in organizing the killing of a British official in Nasik (a case which also involved his elder brother, Ganesh Damodar), Savarkar attempted to escape at Marseilles, and the British intrusion onto French soil to recapture him became a celebrated case in international law.<br>
<br>The British transported Savarkar to the Andaman Islands (1911&#150;21), imprisoned him in Ratnagiri, Bombay presidency (1921&#150;4), and kept him interned in that district until 1937: these experiences confirmed his stature as Veer (heroic) Savarkar, the epithet by which he came to be generally known. Savarkar's <span class="italic">The Story of my Transportation for Life</span> (1927), however, indicates that prison life was decisive in his transition to a consistently anti-Muslim nationalism. He urged Hindu prisoners to give up caste prejudices in order to unite against alleged efforts at conversion by Muslim warders, made an abortive offer of co-operation with the British in 1914 in the context of Ottoman Turkey's alliance with Germany, and during the non-co-operation&#150;<i>khilafat</i> united anti-colonial upsurge under Gandhi (1919&#150;22) quarrelled with prisoners imbued with &#145;vitiated and eccentric &hellip; notions of &hellip; Hindu-Muslim unity&#146;  (Savarkar, <span class="italic">Transportation</span>, 544).<br>
<br>In Ratnagiri prison Savarkar wrote his immensely influential <span class="italic">Hindutva / Who is a Hindu?</span> (1923), in which a Hindu was defined as anyone, irrespective of specific religious beliefs or rituals, who acknowledged India as both fatherland and &#145;holyland that is the cradle-land of his religion&#146;  (pp. 74&#150;5). Nationalism was thus implicitly merged with a Hindutva (Hindu-ness) that soared over differences of caste or sect, but insisted on a common history and culture, grounded in an &#145;Aryan&#146; conquest of the subcontinent that had assimilated non-Aryan elements in a hierarchized unity. Simultaneously, Indian Muslims and Christians were declared incapable of full patriot status: with holy lands in Arabia and Palestine, &#145;their names and their outlook smack of foreign origin&#146;  (Savarkar, <span class="italic">Historic Statements</span>, 1).<br>
<br>Savarkar, who prided himself on his rationalist and &#145;modern&#146; views, won a reputation while interned as a social reformer who encouraged inter-dining among castes and the opening of schools and temples to untouchables&#151;but he condemned Ambedkar's call to the latter to convert to Buddhism. He also became a well-known writer of Marathi plays, novels, and anti-Muslim histories, who campaigned for Sanskritized Marathi and Hindi (as the &#145;national&#146; language) purged of &#145;Muslim&#146;, Urdu influences. After 1937 Savarkar tried to build up the Hindu Mahasabha (of which he was president, 1937&#150;42) as a political alternative to the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, around the central slogan: &#145;Hinduise all politics and militarise Hindudom.&#146; He urged Hindus to join the army, opposed the anti-British Quit India movement (1942), and denounced Gandhi for &#145;appeasing&#146; Muslims during the Hindu&#150;Muslim riots associated with the emergence of independent India and Pakistan in 1947. Anti-Brahman crowds attacked his house when Gandhi was murdered in January 1948 by Nathuram Godse, a disciple who in his trial (where Savarkar was a fellow accused) assumed sole responsibility for the crime but hailed Savarkar as the ideological alternative to Gandhian non-violence which &#145;would result in the emasculation of the Hindu Community&#146;. Savarkar was acquitted, and went on advocating virulently militaristic, anti-Muslim and anti-Christian policies (there was a &#145;menace of Christianistan&#146;, he declared in 1953, in missionary schools and hospitals). Savarkar's last statement before his death in Bombay on 26 February 1966 called on the Indian government to &#145;immediately &hellip; equip India with &hellip; nuclear weapons and missiles&#146;  (Savarkar, <span class="italic">Historic Statements</span>, 244). Organizationally marginalized in his last years (the Mahasabha was routed in every election after 1946), Savarkar, and particularly his <span class="italic">Hindutva</span> text, remained a principal ideological influence on the eventually more successful alternative Hindu-nationalist formation built up around the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of K. B. Hedgewar, which became embodied politically in the last decades of the twentieth century in the Bharatiya Janata Party.<br>
