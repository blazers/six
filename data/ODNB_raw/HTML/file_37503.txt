<span class="headword">Haldane,  Alexander</span>  (1800&#150;1882), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and barrister</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 15 October 1800, the second of three sons, one of whom died young, and the fifth of nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11895/', "James Alexander Haldane (1768&#150;1851)")</script>, pastor and religious writer, and his first wife, Mary (1771&#150;1819), daughter of Major Alexander Joass of Culleonard, Banffshire. His half-brother was the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11894/', "Daniel Rutherford Haldane")</script>. He was educated at Edinburgh high school and the University of Edinburgh before moving to London, where he entered the Inner Temple in 1820. In August 1822 he married Emma Corsbie (1800&#150;1867), youngest daughter of Joseph Hardcastle of Hatcham House, Surrey, a merchant and treasurer of the London Missionary Society; they had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50304/', "James Robert Alexander Chinnery-Haldane")</script>, later Episcopalian bishop of Argyll and the Isles, and five daughters.<br>
<br>Haldane's personal convictions and family connections caused him quickly to assume a prominent role on the more extreme wing of Anglican evangelicalism. He was associated with Edward Irving and Henry Drummond and participated in the early prophetic conferences at Albury, but later distanced himself from the movement that was to result in the formation of the Catholic Apostolic church. In 1828 he began to write for the fledgeling <span class="italic">Record</span> newspaper, and subsequently became its chief proprietor and the dominant influence on editorial policy for half a century. Under his leadership <span class="italic">The Record</span> was the major public voice of a new school of evangelicals that emerged about 1830. The Recordites, as they were called, followed Haldane in affirming the verbal inspiration of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, attacking liberal theology and Catholicism, maintaining a rigorous sabbatarianism, and staunchly defending the established church. Haldane further contributed to evangelical self-awareness by writing the lives of his father and of his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11896/', "Robert Haldane")</script>, and describing their careers as itinerant evangelists.<br>
<br>Although never an MP Haldane was keenly interested in politics and was an active force in a variety of parliamentary and ecclesiastical networks. He was a close friend and adviser of Anthony Ashley Cooper, seventh earl of Shaftesbury, and through him, between 1855 and 1865, influenced the church appointments made by the third Viscount Palmerston. A vigorous and intellectually acute controversialist, he worked with great energy to sustain the protestant character of the English church and nation, and hence contributed substantially to the entrenched conservatism of Victorian Anglican evangelicalism. Haldane died at 118 Westbourne Terrace, London, on 19 July 1882 and was buried at Paddington cemetery on 24 July.<br>
