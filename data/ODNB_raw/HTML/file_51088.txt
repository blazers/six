<span class="headword">Harris,  Reginald Hargreaves <span class="st"> [Reg]</span></span>  (1920&#150;1992), <span class="occ">cyclist</span>, was born Reginald Hargreaves at 7 Garden Street, Bury, Lancashire, on 1 March 1920, the son of Elsie Hargreaves, cotton weaver. He acquired the surname Harris following his mother's marriage to Joseph Harris, engineer and businessman. His first job was as an apprentice motor mechanic but he soon moved from the workshop to the showroom, which also sold cycles. He joined the Bury branch of the Cyclists' Touring Club and then the Lancashire Road Club, where his promise produced an invitation to train with the club star. He was soon cycling in every free moment, half-day closing afternoon, summer evenings, and Sundays. He began to enter competitions such as 100 mile reliability trials, and to win prizes at local events. His employers were obviously impressed because they gave him a new bike, but he soon moved to a slipper factory, where the pay was better and then to a paper mill where, with plenty of overtime, he calculated that he could earn enough during the winter to allow him to concentrate on his cycling in the summer. His first sprint races were on Lancashire grass tracks in 1936, and he began to compete successfully against men ten years older than himself. With the overtime and the sale of the prizes that he was beginning to collect he bought new and better machines, and in 1937 gave up his job in the paper mill to concentrate full-time on the cycling season.<br>
<br>In 1938 Harris joined the Bury athletics club and won half a dozen races in the north of England, including the Wells bequest trophy, the first time he had beaten some of the best of the opposition. In 1939 he changed clubs again, to the prestigious Manchester Wheelers, and although disappointed by his performance in the British championship he was still selected for the world championships to be held in September in Milan. The team was withdrawn on the outbreak of the Second World War.<br>
<br>Harris liked to say that he was one of the few people who came out of the army less fit than he went in. He drove a tank for the 10th hussars in north Africa but was wounded, invalided home, and transferred to the Royal Army Service Corps. He was then discharged from the army as medically unfit, but barely a year later he had won three titles at the national cycling championship in 1944: the 1000 yards, 5 miles, and quarter-mile. In 1945 he repeated the feat by winning the 1000 yards and quarter-mile on the track and the half-mile on grass. He was invited to race in Paris, where he excited the crowd and won several big races. It was after these successes that Claud Butler, the lightweight cycle manufacturer, agreed to provide him not only with all his equipment but also with a job. This was pushing up against the sports amateur&#150;professional boundaries in Britain. But it paid off for both of them when Harris won the world title in 1947 in Paris, the first British rider to do so since Harold Johnson in 1922.<br>
<br>Harris thought he might win three gold medals in the Olympic games in London in 1948, but three months before they were due to begin he fractured two vertebrae in his back in a car accident. Determined to get fit after several weeks in hospital he began training, racing, and winning, only to fracture an elbow after a fall in a 10 mile race at the Fallowfield track. Though still very sore, he continued to train with the elbow in a plaster cast and (perhaps to show his rivals and the selectors) rode a kilometre time-trial in the rain and equalled the British empire games record. But he had to be satisfied with Olympic silver medals in both the individual and tandem sprints.<br>
<br>The next step for Harris was to turn professional, even though he was already running a Mark IV Jaguar as an amateur. He signed up with the Raleigh Cycle Company for &pound;1000 a year, a &pound;100 bonus if he became world champion, &pound;50 for every grand prix victory, and &pound;25 every time he broke the British record. He probably earned &pound;12,000 a year from racing in the early 1950s. He won the world sprint title in 1949, the first Englishman to win a professional title and the first man ever to do it in his professional d&eacute;but season. He also won in 1950, 1951, and 1954. In 1952 the rules were changed to allow three finalists instead of two, and in the final of that year the Swiss rider Oskar Plattner blocked Harris so that &#145;the flying Dutchman&#146; Arie Van Vliet could win. At the end-of-season meeting of champions at Herne Hill, Harris destroyed Plattner in a revenge match before an ecstatic crowd. He retired in 1957 but returned in 1971 at fifty-one, and won the British title again in 1974, just to show what he thought of the younger generation of cycle racers.<br>
<br>All forms of sport reached new levels of popularity in the years immediately following the Second World War, but British cycling had no great competitive tradition until Harris established one more or less single-handed. His physique was phenomenal, his training routines ferocious, and his will to win formidable. He had an indomitable spirit, and returned as sharp as ever after accidents that would have daunted lesser men. His five world records set as a professional stood for many years. Two years running he was named sportsman of the year, a star whose name was as familiar to the British and European public as Stanley Matthews or Stirling Moss. His debonair good looks dominated Raleigh's advertising campaigns for a decade. His sporting achievements were recognized with an OBE in 1958. Nevertheless he had little patience with what he saw as the amateurish administrators of British cycling.<br>
<br>Harris married, first, on 7 April 1945, Florence Stage (<i>b</i>. 1923/4), the daughter of William Stage, licensed victualler, of Bury. The marriage ended in divorce, and on 29 March 1955 he married, second, Dorothy Hadfield (<i>b</i>. 1926/7), secretary, and the daughter of Henry Hadfield, master fruiterer. This marriage also ended in divorce, and on 25 September 1970 he married, third, Jennifer Anne Geary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brazendale (<i>b</i>. 1944/5), daughter of James George Brazendale, electrical engineer. Following his retirement from professional cycling he had a number of businesses, including running a garage and a cycle-building company, and becoming a director of a firm making plastic foam. His individualism made him a somewhat erratic businessman, with little taste for delegating or negotiating. He smoked a pipe and liked a glass of wine, but cycling was the most important thing in his life. Even at seventy-two, after an operation for a snapped ankle tendon, he was on his bike when he had a minor stroke. Two days later, on 22 June 1992, he died of another stroke, at Macclesfield District General Hospital. He was survived by his third wife, Jennifer.<br>
