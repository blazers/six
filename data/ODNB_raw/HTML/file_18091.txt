<span class="headword">Marriott, Sir  James</span>  (1730&#150;1803), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born on 29 October 1730, probably at Twinstead Hall, Essex, the son of Benjamin Marriott, a Hatton Garden attorney, and his wife, Esther (<i>d</i>. 1771), daughter of Abraham Chambers of Twinstead. He entered Trinity Hall, Cambridge, on 17 June 1746, was elected a scholar on 27 October 1747, and graduated LLB on 17 June 1751. In November 1755 he altered his intended profession from the church to the law &#145;for family reasons&#146;  (Marriott to the duke of Newcastle, BL, Add. MS 32860, fol. 465). His mother's second husband, Everard Sayer, had been a prominent civilian lawyer. Marriott took his LLD on 25 March 1757 and entered the College of Advocates on 3 November. He published two pamphlets on topical controversies over neutrals' rights but it was neither his legal talents nor the very slender literary accomplishments exemplified by his contributions to the university's verses on several public occasions that secured him advancement.<br>
<br>In 1754 Marriott was employed to arrange the library of the university's chancellor, Thomas Pelham-Holles, first duke of Newcastle, and proclaimed himself his &#145;most devoted dependant&#146;  (15 Feb 1755, BL, Add. MS 32852, fol. 495), zealously furthering his patron's interests in Cambridge, where he became a fellow of his college in 1756, and in Suffolk.<br>
<br>In 1760 Marriott wooed the nineteen-year-old Hester Salusbury (later Mrs Thrale) but found her indifferent and her father hostile. Devoted to his mother, he never married but was more persevering and promiscuous in his political pursuits. Marriott was an indefatigable, insatiable, and indiscriminate suitor for patronage and although he was made receiver of land tax for Suffolk, he was disappointed by Newcastle's tardiness in finding him a seat in the House of Commons and when George III became king he shamelessly sought the favour of the king's new ministers while trying unsuccessfully to avoid alienating the Pelhams. His election as master of Trinity Hall (June 1764) owed more to college politics than ministerial favour but on 9 October he was made king's advocate by John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, secretary of state, albeit only &#145;because it absolutely now goes a-begging&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jenkinson Papers</span>, 299). He served as vice-chancellor of the university in 1767, but was disappointed in his hopes of augmenting by public subscription a legacy of &pound;500 which Walter Titley had left at the vice-chancellor's disposal, in order to erect an amphitheatre for concerts and lectures to his own designs.<br>
<br>Still avid for preferment, Marriott put himself forward in 1768 for the vacant professorship of modern history but Thomas Gray was preferred and despite his importunities (which drove one prime minister, Augustus Fitzroy, third duke of Grafton, to distraction), he obtained nothing more until October 1778, when he was knighted (9 October) and appointed judge in Admiralty (12 October).<br>
<br>As king's advocate Marriott had shown himself capable of effective legal argument, but as a judge he did not enhance the standing of his court despite the opportunities presented by two wars. Described in his youth as &#145;gay and volatile&#146;  (Coote, 125), he never acquired the discretion needed for judicial office and his courtroom manner was said rather to resemble &#145;the jocular effusions of the president of a festive meeting&#146;  (ibid.) than a judge. He was also prone to intemperate outbursts, notably against the American colonists and eminent jurists. Roscoe's verdict that he did &#145;not leave a single judgment of historical value&#146;  (p. 37) is severe, but there is little reason to regret that the only collected reports of his court are those he himself began publishing in retirement. A more valuable undertaking was his compilation of the forms and practice of the court, <span class="italic">Formulare instrumentarum</span> (1802); freely drawn on by American writers, it was a major influence on American admiralty law.<br>
<br>In 1781 Marriott finally achieved his ambition of becoming MP for Sudbury in Suffolk, not far from Twinstead. He was initially a supporter of North's ministry and wrote a pamphlet in defence of British conduct towards the Americans, but he proved very maladroit and earned a footnote in history when, to the great merriment of the Commons, he solemnly rebutted the colonists' claim to &#145;no taxation without representation&#146; by arguing that they were &#145;represented by the members for Kent, since in the charters of the thirteen provinces they are declared to be &#147;part and parcel of the manor of Greenwich&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Parliamentary History of England from the Earliest Times to 1803</span>, vol. 22, col. 1184). In keeping with his past record he deserted North on the fall of his administration and attached himself to William Petty, second earl of Shelburne, voting for the peace and Fox's <span class="roman">India Bill</span>. He did not seek re-election in 1784 but was returned for Sudbury in 1796 in a rather questionable manner when, having initially supported the sitting member, John Coxe Hippisley, and argued against a contest, he allowed several influential citizens to persuade him to stand himself, Hippisley withdrawing in disgust. A silent supporter of William Pitt the younger, he hoped in 1801 to be able to resign his seat in favour of a relative of his friend Charles Jenkinson, first earl of Liverpool, but in the event retained it until the dissolution in 1802.<br>
<br>After quarrelling with the fellows, Marriott seldom visited his college, though he did present it with a bust of Lord Mansfield, whom he greatly admired. In 1786 he successfully evaded a second term as university vice-chancellor on the plea that judicial office exempted him. He was treasurer of Doctors' Commons in 1780 and in the 1790s he sat on the board of longitude. In 1793 he drafted a bill to remove some anomalies in prize law, but towards the end of the century his inability to cope with the court's heavy wartime workload led to memorials seeking his removal. When he resigned on 26 October 1798 with a pension of &pound;2000 p.a., the king wrote that his replacement by Sir William Scott was &#145;highly advantageous to the credit of the court of admiralty&#146;  (George III, <span class="italic">Later Corr.</span>, 3.147). Marriott made many alterations to Twinstead Hall, where he died peacefully on 21 March 1803, and rebuilt the church, where he was buried on 29 March.<br>
