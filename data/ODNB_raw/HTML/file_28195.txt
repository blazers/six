<span class="headword">Venning,  Walter</span>  (1781&#150;1821), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born at Totnes, Devon, on 15 November 1781, the youngest of three sons born to his father, Walter, a local merchant, and his wife, Mary Ann. He followed his two brothers to Totnes grammar school and thence to Jackson &amp; Co., a London banking house with interests in St Petersburg, Russia. In 1799 he joined his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28193/', "John Venning (1776&#150;1858)")</script> at the St Petersburg branch of the company and remained there until 1807, when he returned to London. In 1810 he experienced an evangelical conversion, the impact of which was deepened by his mother's death in 1811. On 6 September 1811 he joined the Independents. He never married.<br>
<br>In 1815 the Gurney, Hoare, and Fry evangelical Quaker banking interests coalesced to form the London-based Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline; Walter Venning became intensely involved with this society, which was established to implement the prison reformer John Howard's recommendations following his revelations of appalling conditions prevailing in prisons throughout Europe. He had argued that prisons should be rigorously supervised by the public authorities and administered according to proper health practices, with the provision of work, exercise, pastoral care, and aftercare, and appropriate classification of all prisoners.<br>
<br>Walter Venning returned to St Petersburg in 1817, where he influenced the conversion of his brother John. It was a propitious time for his mission: Tsar Alexander I was deeply committed to a mystical vision of vernacular scripture and Western-style philanthropy underpinning an ultra-conservative Christian society. This emphasis on the living word of God led him to support the British and Foreign Bible Society in its crusade to make the vernacular <span class="roman">Bible</span> available to every family in Russia. Indeed, at this time it was <i>de rigueur</i> for any aspiring Russian politician or aristocrat to be seen to be engaged in such work.<br>
<br>In 1817 Walter Venning was introduced by Revd John Paterson of the Bible Society to the Russian court and this led to a meeting with Prince Galitzin, one of Alexander's most influential ministers. Walter Venning was allowed to visit the prisons of St Petersburg and to report directly to Alexander. In 1818 he was invited to report on the prisons of Moscow; his report was translated into Russian by Princess Meshchersky. In this widely read document he depicted the prisons as grossly neglected and abusive environments: corruptly administered, full of dirt, violence, and drunkenness, they housed prisoners dying of preventable disease without any programmes of spiritual or moral reform or training for release. In the spring of 1819 the tsar agreed to the establishment of a Prison Discipline Society in St Petersburg, comprising Russians and British and other expatriates. On 5 May 1819 he visited the Venning brothers and showed much interest in the design of a model prison, based on John Howard's plans but adapted to the Russian climate. At the same time Walter Venning was working with Princess Meshchersky to introduce Ladies' Visiting Committees to women prisoners in St Petersburg, in imitation of Elizabeth Fry's work. Some success was achieved in transforming places of terror and abuse into sober and ordered establishments offering employment and religious instruction.<br>
<br>Venning was also concerned with the Russian Bible Society and the Lancaster schools movement, which was introducing the monitorial teaching system in Russia. In 1818 the Quakers William Allen and Stephen Grellet visited Alexander, whom they had met in England four years earlier, and they criticized Russian Lancaster schools for teaching French philosophical writings and other secular texts which they viewed as seditious. Venning played a major role in setting up two Lancaster schools for scriptural and moral education in St Petersburg, one for poor Russian boys and one for expatriates, to ensure a proper religious and moral basis to this kind of education.<br>
<br>Just before these schools opened Walter Venning died at his brother John's home in St Petersburg on 10 January 1821 of typhoid, probably contracted while visiting prisoners. He was buried at the city's English chapel and a bronze monument erected in his memory. He was remembered for his intense enthusiasm for evangelical Christianity and prison reform. He had committed his life to the belief that the rich and powerful would find the true Christ in stewardship of the dispossessed, the poor, and the lost; by their good works they would create a truly Christian society united in charity, obligation, gratitude, and obedience. His work was continued by his brother John.<br>
