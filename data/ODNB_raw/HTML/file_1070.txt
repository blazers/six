<span class="headword">Baillie,  William, of Provand</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1593), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of Alexander Baillie of Carfin, Lanarkshire. No siblings are definitely known, though in his testament a legacy was left to James, son of the late Thomas Baillie, the latter having possibly been William's brother. William Baillie married Elizabeth Durham (<i>d</i>. 1585) and they had a daughter, Elizabeth. There is also mention of a son, William, who may have predeceased his father, as well as of an illegitimate son, John.<br>
<br>As a canon of Glasgow Cathedral before the Reformation, Baillie had the rich prebendal lands of Provand, which brought him considerable income, some of which he used to become feuar of valuable lands in north Ayrshire from the dean and chapter of Glasgow. By 15 November 1550 he had become a lord of session. He is recorded as one of twelve judges who were to &#145;deliver the billis &amp; ressaif writingis in the utter tolbuyth&#146; according to a schedule beginning on 21 January 1555  (NA Scot., CS1/1, fol. 67), and he was nominated to a major commission in 1566 to revise the laws. In May that year he replaced John Sinclair, bishop of Brechin, as lord president of the court of session even though he was by now unqualified, no longer being an ecclesiastic as required by law. This ground of objection caused Baillie to be removed from the presidency when Sir James Balfour of Pittendreich exchanged the office of clerk register for that of lord president on 6 December 1567, but he was recognized as presiding lord during any absence by Balfour. In 1571, after Balfour was forfeited and had absented himself from court, Baillie resumed the presidency on a <i>de facto</i> basis, until his legal disqualification was removed in 1579; thereafter he acted <i>de jure</i>. In 1577 he was granted a pension of &pound;100. At his death, on 26 May 1593, he left an estate of &pound;5118 Scots, of which &pound;1300 was in ready money. Most of it went to his daughter, who had married Robert Hamilton of Newton.<br>
