</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paye,  Richard Morton</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1750, <em>d.</em> 1821), <span class="occ">artist</span>, was baptized on 14 June 1750 at Botley, Hampshire, the son of John Paye and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morton. Virtually nothing is known of Paye's early life, though he worked as a chaser from youth, perhaps a family occupation. In 1773 he first appeared in London at lodgings in Leicester Fields, from where he sent his first exhibits to the Royal Academy&#151;two oil paintings and four wax models. His small-scale models earned comparison with those of George Michael Moser, with Paye possessing more of the &#145;spirit of sculpture and less of the French flutter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Library of the Fine Arts</span>, 3, 1832, 96). Yet none of these works can be identified today. A two-year gap from 1775 to 1777 suggests some time away from the capital, but there is no record of travel to Italy, as one might expect of a young artist of this date. From <i>c</i>.1778 to 1783 Paye resided in London at 26 Swallow Street, then the main thoroughfare between Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Street.<br>
<br>Paye attracted the patronage of the younger son of the famous doctor Percival Pott, the Revd Joseph Holden Pott, who bought <span class="italic">A Girl Sewing</span> (possibly <span class="italic">A Fancy Head</span>; exh. RA, 1773). This early work exemplifies Paye's interest in &#145;fancy pictures&#146;, everyday scenes featuring children, treated in the manner of old masters such as Rembrandt and Murillo, much in fashion in the late eighteenth century. In 1783 in <span class="italic">An Engraver at Work</span> (exh. Society of Arts, 1783; Upton House, Warwickshire), Paye depicted himself engraving a portrait of Pott's father, after Nathaniel Dance. A candle-lit scene, it well illustrates his reputation as a painter of chiaroscuro effects in the manner of Joseph Wright of Derby. His greatest bid for critical attention came when he showed this painting and nine others at the Society of Arts in 1783. By 1784 Paye had moved to 37 Broad Street, Golden Square, London. It is not known when he married, but his wife's maiden name may have been Hayward and his expanding family acted as models for his child-focused subjects.<br>
<br>Another early patron was Dr John Wolcot, the satirist with the pen-name Peter Pindar, who, after falling out with John Opie in 1783, turned his attention to Paye. The two men associated for about a year, perhaps sharing lodgings and profits from picture sales, but the arrangement failed when Wolcot accused the artist of &#145;obstinacy, ingratitude [and] not following his advice in the pursuit of his studies&#146;  (D.). A complete break occurred when Paye exhibited <span class="italic">Portrait of a Sulky Boy</span> at the Royal Academy in 1785, arguably his masterpiece (Sothebys, 10 November 1982), but calculated to anger Wolcot as it was a public display of the writer's supposed illegitimate son.<br>
<br>Paye's skill and originality reputedly prompted Sir Joshua Reynolds to invite him to mix in Royal Academy circles, but his diffidence prevented him from doing so. It is hard to reconcile this shyness with the subtle irony and humour evident in the artist's chosen area of specialization, the behaviour of children engaged in a common activity. Paye's inventive compositions and subjects also often featured identifiable locations in London, as in <span class="italic">Boys Throwing Snowballs</span> (exh. RA, 1784; engraved 1785), set under the portico of St George's, Hanover Square, and <span class="italic">Boys Playing at Marbles</span> (engraved 1786) set in the environs of Westminster School. Most of Paye's child subjects were issued as engravings in pairs, tapping into the growing market for prints at home and in France.<br>
<br>Paye exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy and once at the Free Society in 1783 and at the Society for Promoting Art and Design in Liverpool in 1787, with later appearances at the Society of Arts and the British Institution, showing more than seventy-five paintings. Yet only a fraction are known, chiefly through engravings, and fewer still are located now. He also painted portraits (for example, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, exh. RA, 1789) and history paintings. Stylistically, Paye graduated from a tightly defined precision in early portraits (reminiscent of Henry Walton's works) to the dramatic lighting effects of <span class="italic">An Engraver at Work</span>, to a later broader style. As a stylistic chameleon, Paye produced works destined to be misattributed. In the 1820s one of his major paintings, <span class="italic">The Miraculous Increase of the Widow's Oil</span> (also known as <span class="italic">The Widow's Cruse</span>), appeared with an art dealer as a work of Vel&aacute;zquez, and it was acknowledged as such by leading painters of the day, until a friend of Paye recognized the artist's family as the models.<br>
<br>Critical favour eluded Paye, with the style of his works in the 1790s considered &#145;woolly&#146;, and &#145;his execution slovenly&#146;  (D.), as in <span class="italic">The Boy Exulting over his Golden Eggs</span> (exh. RA, 1795; engraved 1796). However, he intended these more quickly executed genre subjects primarily as designs for engravings, then his main source of income. Paye enjoyed close relations with many of the best engravers of the day, including J. R. Smith and John Young, his greatest friend and supporter. In 1795, his final bid for success at the Royal Academy resulted in a display of seven paintings, hurriedly finished, as reported by Joseph Farington  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2.327, 18 April 1795); later in the year he did not receive a single vote when seeking election as an associate member, at the age of forty-five. Paye's fortunes then declined, with only infrequent appearances in exhibitions. He produced a design for a competition for a monument to Lord Nelson in 1807 while suffering with rheumatic fever and later suffered a stroke. John Young appealed to the Royal Academy on behalf of Paye &#145;now labouring under a stroke of Palsey, and in very poor circumstances&#146;  (ibid., vol. 11, 26 Jan 1812), and with the support of the president, Benjamin West, Paye received 20 guineas as a charitable gift. He carried on as an artist until at least 1815 when, according the catalogue of the British Institution's annual exhibition, he showed <span class="italic">The Gout, or, A Lecture on Patience</span> which &#145;he painted with his left hand, after losing the use of the right by a paralytic fit&#146;.<br>
<br>Towards the end of his life Paye resided with his daughter, Elizabeth Anne Briane, a successful miniaturist, at Queen Anne Street, London. He never progressed as far in his career as his early talents promised due to a &#145;retired disposition&#146; and &#145;almost total exclusion from contemporary intercourse&#146;  (D.), and died in obscurity in December 1821.<br>
