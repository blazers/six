<span class="headword">Borland,  James</span>  (1774&#150;1863), <span class="occ">army physician</span>, was born at Ayr, Scotland, in April 1774. He joined the army medical department as a hospital assistant on 20 December 1790, becoming surgeon's mate in the Royal Highland regiment in 1792, and took part in the duke of York's disastrous campaign in Flanders in 1793&#150;5, during which general hospitals were established in addition to regimental hospitals. Borland emphasized the adverse effect of this development on regimental medical officers, who resented the appointment of civilian physicians and staff surgeons over their heads to run the general hospitals. He also rejected as &#145;fallacious and mischievous &hellip; the argument that civilian doctors were better educated&#146;  (Cantlie, 228). On 2 April 1794 he was appointed surgeon to the 23rd foot and sailed with the regiment to the West Indies, leaving it in September 1795 to act as staff surgeon on San Domingo until British troops withdrew in 1798. In 1799 he accompanied the expedition to The Helder in the Netherlands, and after its failure was sent by the duke of York to the headquarters of the French general Brune, with a flag of truce, to arrange for the exchange of the wounded. For this service he was promoted, on 5 December 1799, to the newly constituted rank of deputy inspector of army hospitals. He then became attached to Russian troops, who had co-operated with the British in the northern Netherlands and had been ordered to winter in the Channel Islands until the breaking up of the ice in the Baltic Sea allowed them to return home. His work was rendered more onerous by an outbreak of malignant fever in Guernsey, and, for his efforts, he received the thanks of the tsar. However, he declined an invitation to enter the imperial service.<br>
<br>Borland was chief medical officer of the army in the southern counties, under the command of Sir David Dundas, at the time of the threatened French invasion. He became inspector-general of hospitals on 22 January 1807 and served at headquarters in London at a time when many improvements in army hospital organization were planned. During the ill-fated expedition to the Scheldt in 1809, he volunteered for the duty of enquiring into the causes of the sicknesses and deaths at Walcheren, being associated with Dr Lempriere, one of the physicians to the army, and Sir Gilbert Blane, who had then left the navy and was in practice in London. The report of these commissioners, on whose recommendation the fever-ridden troops were finally withdrawn, was ordered by the House of Commons to be printed among <span class="italic">Accounts and Papers for 1810</span> as <span class="italic">Papers Relating to the Scheldt Expedition</span>  (fol. 2, no. 104).<br>
<br>From 1810 to 1816 Borland was principal medical officer in the Mediterranean, responsible for organizing the hospitals of the Anglo-Sicilian contingent, the efficiency and unprecedented economy of which prompted a special official minute on the disbandment of the force. His services during an outbreak of plague at Malta also received praise from Admiral Lord Exmouth. He accompanied the force sent to assist the Austrians to expel Joachim Murat from Naples, and the troops which held Marseilles and blockaded Toulon at the time of the Waterloo campaign. On 25 May 1816 he retired on half pay, was appointed honorary physician to the duke of Kent, and received the order of SS Maurizio e Lazzaro of Savoy. For many years he lived at Teddington, Middlesex, where his sterling character and many kindly deeds won general esteem. He died at Bridgeman House, Teddington, on 22 February 1863, aged eighty-eight. He was survived by his wife, Susannah Frances, and son, Robert Spencer Borland.<br>
