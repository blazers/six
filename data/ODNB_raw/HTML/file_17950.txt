<span class="headword">Manners,  Charles</span>, fourth duke of Rutland  (1754&#150;1787), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 15 March 1754, the second but first surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17958/', "John Manners, marquess of Granby (1721&#150;1770)")</script>, an army officer, and his wife, Lady Frances Seymour (1728&#150;1761), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25158/', "Charles Seymour, sixth duke of Somerset")</script>. He was styled Lord Roos from 1760, and marquess of Granby after his father's death, during the lifetime of his grandfather John, the third duke.<br>
<br>Like his father, Manners was educated at Eton College (1762&#150;71) and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was credited with pamphlets on the mortality of the soul and in defence of modern adultery. He obtained a nobleman's MA in 1774. That year, hastening back from France, and not yet of age, he was returned to parliament unopposed as member for his university. His family had electoral interests in Cambridge, town and county, as well as in Leicestershire, Nottingham, and Scarborough. While maintaining these, Manners began collecting books, furniture, porcelain, and pictures by old masters, including Rubens, Van Dyck, and Dou, as well as Poussin's <span class="italic">Sacraments</span>, to embellish Belvoir Castle. In this Sir Joshua Reynolds, from whom he commissioned family portraits, was also one of his agents; others were stationed in Rome and Brussels. Credited with honouring a pledge to redeem his father's substantial debts, he was snagged by his habitual gambling. His extravagance was not tempered by his marriage on 26 December 1775 to a celebrated beauty, Lady Mary Isabella Somerset (1756&#150;1831) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68363/', "Manners, Mary Isabella")</script>], the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74104/', "Charles Noel Somerset, fourth duke of Beaufort")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26010/', "Somerset, Henry, second duke of Beaufort")</script>], which had been arranged by her mother, Elizabeth Berkeley; it produced four sons and two daughters. Having previously seduced the daughter of one Smith, an Eton shopkeeper, he later indulged, according to Sir Nathaniel Wraxall, in an expensive fling with the singer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2397/', "Mrs Elizabeth Billington, n&#233;e Weichsel (1765&#150;1818)")</script>.<br>
<br>Before he entered parliament, Granby had already committed himself to the opposition to Lord North's ministry, adhering at first to the Rockingham whigs. On 5 April 1775, having acted only as an observer until he came of age, he spoke and voted against legislative restrictions on the trade of the southern American colonies. This maiden speech sparkled with defiance, particularly when Richard Rigby provoked him into arguing that rebellion was acceptable when justice was at stake; his speech praised Lord Chatham, who wrote to thank him. It also earned the admiration of Chatham's son William Pitt, whom he befriended, and who visited him at his then abode at Cheveley, near Newmarket. Horace Walpole maintained that Granby's parliamentary d&eacute;but was &#145;a great disappointment&#146; to the court. Lord Mansfield, whose wife was sister to the duchess of Somerset, Lord Granby's grandmother, had flattered himself he should govern Lord Granby, and &#145;had even answered for him to the Court&#146;  (<span class="italic">Last Journals</span>, 1.455). Granby could not overcome his diffidence when invited by Lord Rockingham to move the amendment to the address in November 1775. His refusal was probably reinforced by a wish not to commit himself exclusively to Rockingham.<br>
<br>Granby nevertheless seconded the amendment on 18 November 1776 and moved it on 18 November 1777 in a speech that echoed Chatham's in the Lords and urged reconciliation with America. His motion was lost by 243 votes to 86. He was subsequently regarded by North and others as a suitable intermediary for ministerial overtures to the concerted opposition, but George III discouraged any such negotiation. Granby and his squad again displayed opposition on the question of Admiral Keppel's conduct on 3 March 1779, but did not follow this through; his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17961/', "Lord Robert Manners (1758&#150;1782)")</script>, a naval officer, was later killed in action. No further speeches at Westminster are recorded, even after Granby succeeded to the dukedom on 29 May 1779. Having offered to raise a regiment for home defence against the French, he had become colonel of the Leicestershire militia, and on 9 July 1779 he was made lord lieutenant of Leicestershire at North's suggestion. The king thought it best to bestow this on him in person. Failing to procure William Pitt's succession to his university constituency, Rutland at once obtained another seat for him pro tem, promising to return him for one of his own boroughs in future, with complete freedom of action. Meanwhile he attended the Yorkshire reform meeting of 30 December 1779 and supported reform at a Cambridge election meeting in 1780, when he returned six members to parliament. Later that year he guaranteed financial security for Pitt.<br>
<br>The replacement of North's ministry, first by Rockingham's, then by Shelburne's ministry, brightened Rutland's political prospects. He was made a knight of the Garter on 30 October 1782 and was rumoured to be the intended viceroy of Ireland. Instead he became lord steward of the household and was sworn of the privy council on 17 February 1783, Shelburne thereby gratifying his wish for a cabinet seat. This appointment aroused the king's displeasure and was an unprecedented concession to a lord steward. It precipitated the duke of Grafton's resignation from the ministry, which soon collapsed. Rutland's real attachment was by now to Pitt, with whose young friends he consorted. After resigning in April 1783 with Shelburne, whose elevation to a marquessate he was to promote a year later, he opposed the Fox&#150;North coalition ministry. When Pitt became premier in December 1783 he at once appointed Rutland, upon Grafton's refusal, lord privy seal, in the cabinet, which at first met at his town house. Then on 11 February 1784 Pitt made him viceroy of Ireland, an appointment worth a basic &pound;20,000, which had been declined by Lord Cornwallis.<br>
<br>Rutland's acceptance of this post, while still under thirty, was perhaps a <i>faux pas</i>, but his admiration for Pitt's superior abilities, no less than Pitt's confidence in him, swamped any scruples. After making his will on 15 February, he took office in Dublin on the 24th. His correspondence with the premier reveals his initial enthusiasm for Pitt's Irish policy, which, he saw, logically entailed Anglo-Irish union within twenty years, but also his growing doubts about its implementation. Soon after his arrival his staff became embroiled in an affray with dissidents in Dublin, which he successfully suppressed, though he was threatened with tarring and feathering, as a contemporary caricature illustrates. He foresaw problems from Irish Foxite whigs with English connections, one of whom, Leinster, the only Irish duke, tended towards opposition, while another, Lord Bristol, bishop of Derry, advocated Catholic enfranchisement. Pitt's reformist views, Rutland feared, would panic the Irish establishment, and the Irish administration would exercise its borough patronage network to retain control of a Dublin parliament which had enjoyed a degree of independence since 1782. When Pitt proposed giving precedence to reform at Westminster, where Rutland had secured two additional nominees in 1784, Rutland was relieved, perhaps more so when reform was checked there in 1785.<br>
<br>As Rutland was recovering from a dangerous fever late in 1784, Pitt was advancing ambitious plans for a commercial entente with Ireland, involving significant concessions to Irish trade in exchange for a guaranteed contribution to the defence of the realm. The leaders of the Irish parliamentary opposition, Henry Grattan and Henry Flood, could not be reconciled to this guarantee unless it was conditional on the amount of the annual Irish revenue surplus from the crown's hereditary Irish funds; with this proviso conceded, the Irish parliament assented in February 1785. In England, however, the commercial opposition to concessions to Irish trade was taken up by the Foxite opposition in parliament, and the proposals were so much amended that Grattan secured their rejection in the Dublin parliament in August. Later Pitt's intentions were better appreciated in Ireland, and Rutland did not face such trying opposition again, or unrest, except for the desultory disturbances of the Whiteboys in Munster, which he countered with a tour of southern Ireland late in 1785. It had, however, demoralized his chief secretary, Thomas Orde, who had to be cajoled into staying put, and whose subsequent ill health was to dash hopes of legislation improving educational provision in Ireland.<br>
<br>Rutland's increasing popularity as viceroy was bought at a price, and not only in terms of the Irish and English patronage requirements which henceforward dominated his correspondence with Pitt, for evidence of his lavish conviviality abounds. Sir Jonah Barrington recalled &#145;The utmost magnificence signalled the entertainments of the viceregal court, and the duke and duchess were reckoned the handsomest couple in Ireland&#146;  (Barrington, <span class="italic">Historic Memoirs of Ireland</span>, 2 vols., 1833, 2.225). He was to be credited with a record for dining out unequalled by his viceregal successors. His last recorded scruple, of which he informed Pitt regretfully on 10 April 1787, was his inability, because of a pledge made in 1782, to rally his parliamentary henchmen to the ministry's problematic bid to settle the prince of Wales's debts. In the summer of 1787 he embarked on a strenuous tour of the midlands and north of Ireland. He left a brief journal of this, though he was allegedly seldom sober during it: his claret consumption was well established, and he was reported to have consumed six or seven turkey eggs at breakfast every day. These excesses were generally regarded as having hastened his death, of incurable liver disease, after a violent fever, at Phoenix Park Lodge, Dublin, on 24 October 1787. He was embalmed, and buried at Bottesford, Leicestershire, on 25 November. George Crabbe, his domestic chaplain at Belvoir since 1782, and his praise singer in verse, pronounced a funeral oration (also published), and his former Cambridge tutor Bishop Richard Watson eulogized him in the Lords on 27 November 1787. Pitt, to whom he left &pound;3000, was one of his trustees and the guardian of his children. Some of his acquisitions were lost in a fire at Belvoir in 1815.<br>
