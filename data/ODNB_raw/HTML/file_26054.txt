<span class="headword">Southey,  Caroline Anne Bowles</span>  (1786&#150;1854), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 6 December 1786 at Buckland Manor near Lymington, Hampshire, the daughter of Captain Charles Bowles (1737&#150;1801), who had retired from the East India Company, and Anne Burrard (1753&#150;1817), the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4098/', "Lieutenant-General Sir Harry Burrard (bap. 1755, d. 1813)")</script>. Some sources give Caroline Bowles's birth date as 1787, and she herself in later life claimed not to know which was correct; the confusion arose because she was not christened until January 1787 as the weather was too severe earlier to take an infant to church. The Burrard family were powerful local dignitaries, and had provided shire councillors and mayors for Lymington as early as the sixteenth century. Charles Bowles was initially backed by the Burrard family (he served as mayor three times), but proved ineffectual as a country squire and later subsided into melancholia, moving his family from the extensive manor farm to the much more modest Buckland Cottage while his daughter was very young. She grew up as an only child in a largely female household (her mother's mother and Jersey grandmother lived with them) in idyllic rural surroundings on the edge of the New Forest, with summers spent by the sea at her uncle Harry's home at Calshot Castle. She learned to read and write very early, and relished parental encouragement for her efforts at verse and also at drawing and painting, for which she also had a gift. This was developed through lessons she received from the local vicar at Boldre church, who happened to be the celebrated &#145;picturesque&#146; author and artist William Gilpin (1724&#150;1804). Some of her later paintings survive: they are held by the Wordsworth Trust and owned by Keswick School.<br>
<br>Devoted to her family, Caroline Bowles was devastated by her parents' deaths. Most of her Burrard boy cousins, too, were killed very young on active service. By 1817 she was left to live alone with only her faithful old nurse for company. Threatened with loss of her home in 1818, owing to mismanagement by a guardian, she sought advice about publication of her &#145;metrical verse tale&#146; first from the poet laureate Robert Southey, whose publisher John Murray admired it but feared it would not sell; next from the poet and editor James Montgomery. At this point one Colonel Bruce, a mysterious adopted son of her father's, made his appearance from India, coming to the rescue by settling on his &#145;sister&#146; an annuity of &pound;150. She went ahead with (anonymous) publication of her verse tale, and <span class="italic">Ellen Fitzarthur: a Poem in Five Cantos</span> went through two editions (1820, 1822) when eventually brought out by Longmans.<br>
<br>
<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26056/', "Robert Southey (1774&#150;1843)")</script> became Caroline Bowles's mentor and friend first by correspondence, later in person: they met in London in 1820, and she visited him at home with his family in the Lake District in 1823. Their correspondence and friendship continued, and finally, after his first wife died, he became her husband: they married on 4 June 1839 when she was fifty-two and he was sixty-five, thinking to spend their declining years working side by side. Before her marriage she had published five volumes of poetry, two of prose sketches, <span class="italic">Chapters on Churchyards</span> (2 vols., 1829), and one of mixed prose and verse, <span class="italic">Solitary Hours</span> (1826). Most of her work was published initially in <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>&#151;where she built a wide reputation as the author of the <span class="italic">Chapters</span> in particular&#151;followed by volume publication with the same firm. She felt a strong kinship with William Blackwood senior whose brand of old-fashioned toryism matched her own (her lively letters to Blackwood are preserved in the National Library of Scotland). Gradually she learned to assert herself as a professional writer, although, disliking publicity, she clung to anonymity until 1836 when she brought out over her own name her major work, an (unfinished) autobiography, <span class="italic">The Birth-Day</span>. Written in blank verse of suppleness, authority, and conversational ease (though with moments of diffidence), it brought her mixed censure and praise; John Wilson (Christopher North) being one of her major champions. It recounts the story of her solitary childhood among a loving family and a menagerie of animal friends, as well as (more mutedly) her frustration with an anti-intellectual environment and limited educational opportunities. The sombreness of the poet's viewpoint as a lonely and bereaved adult provides throughout a constant counterpoint to the often humorous narrative of the child's experiences.<br>
<br>Unlike many of her female contemporaries, Caroline Southey rarely made romantic love the subject of her writings: the beauties of the natural world seemed to hold more charm for her, although she disliked sentimentality. Her work varied in genre from prose fiction (more popular than her verse during her lifetime), through verse satire (<span class="italic">The Cat's Tail</span>, 1830), dramatic monologue (<span class="italic">Tales of the Factories</span>, 1833), and verse narrative (<span class="italic">Ellen Fitzarthur</span>, <span class="italic">The Birth-Day</span>) to lyric poetry. Although physically tiny and often plagued by ill health, she possessed great personal courage, ready to repel intruders with her father's pistols while living alone at Buckland during the threshing-machine riots of the early 1830s, and never hesitating to speak out against injustice. Her <span class="italic">Tales of the Factories</span> were among the earliest of that kind of protest poetry, preceding both Caroline Norton's and Elizabeth Barrett's works in the genre. Her surviving correspondence gives the salty flavour of her character, with her gift for expressing herself with down-to-earth immediacy and pungent turns of phrase: &#145;It is no use to stand shivering and <i>shilly shallying</i> under the shower Bath&#151;Best pull the string, and get the shock over &hellip;&#146; (this to her aunt, about her own forthcoming marriage; see Blain, 200). Her correspondence with Southey was published in 1881.<br>
<br>Possessing a fine ear equally for metre and for natural speech rhythms, Caroline Southey mastered the traditional difficulties of blank verse in <span class="italic">The Birth-Day</span> (more than 3000 lines long), as well as a variety of lyric forms in her shorter poems. Robert Southey recognized her genius long before he came to love her. However, she was never able to fulfil his dearest wish that they should jointly write an epic on Robin Hood: mainly because she could not abide the ungainly metre he insisted upon (the same as for his <span class="italic">Thalaba</span>, which Coleridge once described as a kind of dumb-bell exercise). &#145;Robin Hood&#146; remained unfinished at Southey's death, and in 1847 Caroline Southey published the fragment in a jointly authored volume of that name, the bulk of which however, consisted of her own work, including her fine, sad sonnets on the marriage. Invariably, however, the volume is catalogued as his.<br>
<br>&#145;The last three years have done on me the work of twenty&#146;, Caroline Southey wrote to Lydia Sigourney  (Sigourney, 39) shortly before her husband's death, and indeed she never fully recovered from the emotional trauma of finding soon after their marriage that Robert Southey's endearing absent-mindedness was but the first stage of a rapidly advancing senile dementia. She threw herself loyally into full-time caring for him, but her situation as second wife in the household at Greta Hall in Keswick was virtually untenable. Robert Southey's daughter Kate, who was his housekeeper, hugely resented her intrusion, and she fought so bitterly with his son Cuthbert, whom she felt to be neglectful of his father, that he all but obliterated her from his published account of his father's life. The tensions at Greta Hall became the subject of widespread gossip, harming Caroline Southey's literary as well as her personal reputation. Wordsworth, for example, initially an admirer, sided with the children against her. Many assumed incorrectly that Caroline Bowles had married for money&#151;in fact, she had forfeited Colonel Bruce's annuity on her marriage, and was forced to dip into her own savings to pay the household bills when her husband became very quickly incapacitated. She spent her days by his side in his study, although he could no longer write or even read much: his dependence was total. Her tactless possessiveness did not help the situation with his children, though she made firm friends with his eldest daughter Edith and her husband John Wood Warter, later editor of Southey's letters and of her own <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> (1867).<br>
<br>After Robert Southey's death from typhus in March 1843, Caroline Southey was obliged to leave Greta Hall immediately and return to Buckland, where she spent her remaining years in increasing ill health, writing no more. In 1852 she was awarded a civil-list pension of &pound;200. She died at Buckland Cottage, Lymington, on 20 July 1854, and was buried among Burrard family members in St Thomas's churchyard, Lymington.<br>
