<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Coleridge,  James Duke</span>  (1789&#150;1857), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 13 June 1789, the eldest son of James Coleridge of Heath's Court, Ottery St Mary, Devon, and Frances Duke Taylor, daughter of Bernard Frederick Taylor and one of the coheirs of Robert Duke of Otterton; he was the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5887/', "Sir John Taylor Coleridge")</script> and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5882/', "Henry Nelson Coleridge")</script>. He went to Balliol College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 21 May 1808. Initially he took no degree, and was improvident. On 9 June 1814 he married Sophia, daughter of Colonel Stanhope Badcock. It was intended that he should have a military career, but desiring to take orders, he gained a degree by taking a BCL on 27 January 1821 (he proceeded DCL on 5 March 1835).<br>
<br>Coleridge then began the life of a clergyman, his whole time as such being served in the diocese of Exeter. In 1817 he was curate of the small parish of Whimple, near Exeter, and a year or two later he was working energetically as curate in the city benefice of St Sidwell's, Exeter. William Carey, his diocesan bishop, promoted him in 1823 to the vicarage of the then united parishes of Kenwyn and Kea, Cornwall, where he worked until 1828. During this period the church of Chacewater, with seating for 1500 persons, and the smaller church of St John, Kenwyn, were built in the parish, and became the centres of separate work. One of Coleridge's published sermons was <span class="italic">On the Funeral of the Late Mr William Gill of Chacewater</span> (1827), Gill being his most active assistant in the building of that church. From 1826 to 1839 he held the rectory of Lawhitton, and from 1831 to 1841 he was vicar of Lewannick, both livings situated in Cornwall. In 1839 he was appointed vicar of Thorverton, Devon. He held the post of official to the archdeacon of Cornwall, and in August 1825 became a prebend of Exeter Cathedral.<br>
<br>Coleridge was an old-fashioned high-churchman, his views being quite similar to those of Henry Phillpotts, his diocesan bishop from 1830. He was an energetic propagandist, writing numerous sermons and pamphlets. He emphasized the importance of family religion in <span class="italic">Joshua's Choice</span> (1819), which was several times reprinted, wrote interestingly on sickness in several pamphlets (1825 and 1832), and warned his parishioners about errors of doctrine (1834) and regeneration (1836). His <span class="italic">Practical Advice to the Young Parish Priest</span> (1834) was a work of some substance. His <span class="italic">Companion to First Lessons</span> (1838) has a touching dedication to his brother, John Taylor Coleridge. Coleridge died at the vicarage, Thorverton, on 26 December 1857, survived by two daughters.<br>
