<span class="headword">Barnard,  Joseph Edwin</span>  (1868&#150;1949), <span class="occ">hatter and microscopist</span>, was born on 7 December 1868 at 321 Vauxhall Bridge Road, Pimlico, London, the son of Walter Barnard, hatter, and his wife, Elizabeth Phillips Jacob. He was educated at the City of London School, leaving at the age of sixteen as head boy. He entered his father's firm, with premises at 97 Jermyn Street, London, later becoming its proprietor. This business gave him the time and money to pursue his hobby of microscopy to a highly professional level.<br>
<br>In his own private laboratory Barnard worked with ultraviolet radiation at the ultimate resolution of the optical microscope. From 1899 he undertook photomicrographic work at the Jenner (later Lister) Institute of Preventive Medicine. He became honorary lecturer in microscopy at King's College, London, in 1909, a position he held for sixteen years. His book <span class="italic">Practical Photo-Micrography</span> (1911) remained the standard English textbook on the subject for over thirty years. In 1916 he was co-opted on to the trench fever committee of the War Office, and attempted to discover the causal organism of the fever. In 1920 he became honorary director of the department of applied optics, National Institute for Medical Research; he retired during the Second World War.<br>
<br>Barnard was elected a fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society in 1895, and served three times as its president (1918&#150;19, 1928&#150;9, and 1938&#150;45). He was awarded an honorary fellowship in 1948. In 1911 he was a founder member of the Photomicrographic Society, whose Barnard medal he endowed. He was elected a fellow of the Institute of Physics in 1923, and of the Royal Society in 1924. On 23 March 1894 he married Amelia Muir Cunningham Burge (1867/8&#150;1923), daughter of William Mark Burge, hatter; they had no children. On 18 August 1924 he married Daisy (<i>b</i>. 1892/3), daughter of Frederick William Russell Fisher, sheet metal worker. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Barnard's achievement was to develop the ultraviolet microscope (invented in Germany in 1903) for the study of viruses. In the course of twenty-five years of persistent pioneering work, he was responsible for novel design features, such as the duplex condenser (1924), objective changer (1926), and cone condenser (1930), the last allowing for the first time ultraviolet, dark-ground photographs of viruses. He collaborated with his friend Conrad Beck, the optical manufacturer, in applying these improvements to a production model, and the Beck&#150;Barnard instrument, the first really efficient ultraviolet microscope, was placed on the market in 1929. As a result of his work, a number of viruses causing disease in plants, animals (he worked on foot-and-mouth disease), and humans were first observed. In 1925 he received national press publicity for discoveries concerning malignant growths.<br>
<br>In addition to his business, and his devotion to microscopy, Barnard found time for other interests. He was musical, and had an organ in his house; he enjoyed travel, motoring over much of the continent; and he was a keen photographer. He died at 19 Grimwade Avenue, Addiscombe, Surrey, on 25 October 1949.<br>
