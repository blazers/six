<span class="headword">O'Quinn,  Jeremiah</span> <span class="st"> [Diarmaid &Oacute; Cuinn]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1657), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born at Templepatrick, co. Antrim, of parents whose names are unknown but who were Roman Catholic in faith. A native Irish speaker, he converted to protestantism about 1635 and was sent to university by Arthur Upton, the proprietor of Templepatrick, with a view to becoming a preacher to the Irish-speaking population. O'Quinn subsequently attended Glasgow University, where he studied arts and theology, and graduated MA in 1644. Shortly afterwards he was licensed by the army presbytery, the first presbytery in Ireland. With the Church of Ireland then in disarray and suffering a shortage of clergy, Presbyterian ministers could be inducted to parishes, and O'Quinn was ordained at Billy (near Bushmills), co. Antrim, in 1646. He was the first native Irishman to be ordained to the Presbyterian ministry in Ireland, as before the 1640s Presbyterian ministers were brought over from Scotland. <br>
<br>Although O'Quinn had the support of most of the Billy parish, there were a handful of dissidents who opposed his installation, in particular Daniel McNeill, the Church of Ireland vicar who had been ejected to make way for O'Quinn, and Archibald Stewart of Ballintoy. After a thorough examination of their evidence against O'Quinn their accusations of unsoundness of doctrine were rejected by the presbytery. O'Quinn had strength of character, was forthright in public, and had an appetite for debate which resulted in controversy with his own presbytery. In February 1649 he, along with the Revd James Ker of Ballymoney, opposed the presbytery's &#145;representation&#146;. This strongly condemned the execution of Charles I, putting the fledgeling Presbyterian church on the wrong side of the new military government. O'Quinn's refusal to read the &#145;representation&#146; in church and his subscription to the engagement of loyalty to the Commonwealth resulted in an order to suspend him from his office as minister. His refusal to recognize his suspension created strained relations with the presbytery. He continued to minister in Billy with the support of his congregation and also of the Cromwellian government, which before long had either imprisoned or forced most other Presbyterian clergy into hiding. However, O'Quinn eventually tired of his exclusion from the presbytery and, acting as mediator, succeeded through his moderating influence in effecting a reconciliation between the Presbyterians and the Cromwellian government in Ireland. Nevertheless, the personal cost to him was great, and he was looked on with suspicion by both sides. His own brethren refused to shake hands with him at the treaty interview in Antrim church, and in a letter dated 13 November 1651 to Colonel Robert Venables, the Cromwellian government commissioners said they had heard that O'Quinn &#145;is somewhat embittered against the interest of England and hath of late publicly expressed the same in prayers and other public exercises&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). They asked Venables to confirm this and suggested that, if true, O'Quinn might be sent away for a while to Dublin or other places where he could preach to those with no knowledge of the English language. By 1652, however, circumstances had changed and he was in harmony with both sides. <br>
<br>By 1654 O'Quinn was a Commonwealth minister receiving an annual income of &pound;100. On grounds of his fluency in Irish he was frequently sent on preaching missions throughout Ireland, for each of which he usually received the sum of &pound;20 for expenses, and some of the written invitations to him to preach survive. In 1654 he was sent to preach in the Irish-speaking west of Ireland, for which he received expenses of &pound;40 from the government. In June of the following year Colonel Thomas Herbert, clerk of the council, wrote a letter to O'Quinn and James Wallis of Manor-Cunningham, co. Donegal, requesting them to travel to Dublin and Connaught, where they were to preach the gospel in Irish. On O'Quinn's return he continued with his ministry at Billy, where he died on 31 January 1657 and was buried. The executor of his will, Teig O'Mooney, received a grant of &pound;25 from the government to pay for his funeral expenses. Part of this was spent on a fine Latin memorial. The present stone in the graveyard at Billy is a copy of the original and is still clearly legible. <br>
<br>Some fifty-three years after the death of O'Quinn his work among the Irish-speaking population was praised at meetings of the Presbyterian synod of Ulster. He and Gabriel Cornwall gained special mention because of their remarkable success in communicating with Irish speakers. Their good example, and the large number of Irish-speaking ministers, encouraged the synod in 1710 to undertake a programme of preaching to be supplemented by the use of bibles, confessions of faith, and catechisms, all then available in Irish.<br>
