<span class="headword">Skene,  Alexander, of Newtyle</span>  (1621?&#150;1694), <span class="occ">local politician and author</span>, was born or baptized in Aberdeen on 27 October 1621, the eldest son and second of five children born to Marjorie Forbes (<i>d</i>. 1650) and Robert Skene (<i>d</i>. 1643). His father was elected treasurer of the town council, a post reserved for the wealthy, in 1629 and 1633. Robert Skene also served on the town council of 1638&#150;9, a body dominated by covenanters, of which he was almost certainly one. In accordance with the family's wealth and status, Alexander Skene joined the Aberdeen merchant guild before the age of four in 1625. He enrolled at Marischal College, Aberdeen, in 1637. Since his father is known to have taken the sons of other prominent Aberdeen merchants with him on expeditions to the cloth-producing regions of Yorkshire and to London, it is likely that Alexander received similar instruction.<br>
<br>Few details concerning Alexander Skene's business affairs survive, but his career in public office and his writings attest to his involvement in commercial matters. His actions and whereabouts through the civil wars of the 1640s are unknown, but he was married at Kirkcaldy to Lilias Gillespie [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69911/', "Skene, Lilias (1626/&#150;1697)")</script>], daughter of John Gillespie, the minister there, on 26 August 1646. They had ten children. Their eldest surviving son, John Skene (<i>c</i>.1649&#150;1690), was active in Quaker circles in Aberdeen, emigrated to America in 1682 after his business failed, and was deputy governor of West Jersey (1685&#150;8).<br>
<br>Alexander Skene was first elected to the town council in 1648 (as treasurer, an unusually senior first appointment) in an election from which royalists and moderate covenanters were excluded. He was dean of guild in 1650. In 1651 the Aberdeen kirk session, also dominated by hard-line covenanters, elected him ruling elder. At the fractious general assembly of July 1651 he and Aberdeen's other lay and clerical representatives sided with the radical protester minority. After Aberdeen surrendered to the English army in September 1651 the local covenanting &eacute;lite splintered when Provost Alexander Jaffray of Kingswells and two of the town's three ministers formed a short-lived Independent congregation (Scotland's only such) on the English model. Skene was close to all those involved, but any defection on his part must have been fleeting, as he remained an elder of the kirk. In 1656 he was elected a magistrate (baillie) of the town. His energy and organizational skills were instrumental in the successful introduction of the justice of the peace court, Aberdeen's only major institutional innovation of the seventeenth century.<br>
<br>Skene's connections to the radical cause in church and state worked against him when moderates returned to public life after 1657. He purchased the estate of Newtyle (near Foveran, about 12 miles north of Aberdeen) that year, and was usually referred to thereafter as &#145;Newtyle&#146;. Though not yet forty he virtually retired from public life. In March 1670 he paid to rebuild Aberdeen's medicinal Well of Spa for the public good, and republished Dr William Barclay's 1615 treatise on the well, to which he appended (under the pseudonym Philopolis) some celebratory verse and an &#145;Epistle Dedicatory&#146; addressed to the town council. This public-spiritedness may have expedited his political comeback (and counteracted the effects of his wife's avowal of Quakerism the year before), because six months later he was again elected baillie and elder. His term ended in September 1671 and with it his career in public office, because shortly after he converted to Quakerism himself&#151;not long, he tells us, after suffering painful spasms upon saying of a prominent Quaker, &#145;It wer well to tak that Villain Georg Keith and hang him up at the [Market] Cross of Aberdeen&#146;  (&#145;Brieff historicall account&#146;, 31).<br>
<br>In 1672 Alexander Skene joined a tiny Quaker community around Aberdeen that already included such luminaries as Alexander Jaffray of Kingswells (whose son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14583/', "Andrew Jaffray")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14582/', "Jaffray, Alexander")</script>] Skene's daughter Christian married), George Keith, and Robert Barclay of Urie. Despite the outburst against Keith, Barclay described the converted Skene as &#145;a Man very modest, and very averse from giving offence to others&#146;  (R. Barclay, 401). Quaker meetings were held in the Skenes' townhouse on the Guestrow. When Quakers were persecuted in Aberdeen between 1676 and 1679 Skene, like every adult male Quaker in the region, spent long stretches in the Tolbooth prison. In 1676 the Scottish privy council assessed fines totalling half his valued rents; when he refused to pay his livestock were seized and auctioned at the Aberdeen market, though the citizenry registered its distaste for this action by refusing to bid. Nevertheless, financial pressures stemming from the years of persecution may account for the sale of Newtyle in 1680.<br>
<br>As soon as he joined the Aberdeen Quakers, Skene set about compiling their history. He was chiefly responsible for two lengthy and wonderfully detailed manuscripts on the subject completed in the early 1680s (&#145;A brieff historicall account&#146; and &#145;A brieff account of the most material passages&#146;). He is also said to have compiled a manuscript of the coats of arms of all the principal Scottish families. Alexander Skene published on behalf of Quakers on four occasions, beginning in 1675 and 1676 with two accounts, co-authored with his son John Skene and three others, of a celebrated public debate in Aberdeen in April 1675 (moderated on the Quaker side by Alexander Skene) between Barclay and Keith on the one hand, and four over-matched Marischal College divinity students on the other. These were followed by his preface to George Keith's <span class="italic">The Way Cast Up</span>, dated February 1677 &#145;from the Tolbooth of Aberdeen, where I am prisoner&#146;, in which he offers a comparatively measured response to Robert McWard's anti-Quaker tirade appended to the third edition of the letters of Samuel Rutherford. In 1681 he published a solo tract, <span class="italic">A Plain and Peaceable Advice to those called Presbyterians in Scotland</span>.<br>
<br>Alexander Skene's most important publications dealt not with Quakers but with civic government and urban history. In 1685 he published a remarkable handbook for prospective civic magistrates, <span class="italic">Memorialls for the Government of the Royall-Burghs in Scotland</span>, under the pseudonym &#145;Philopoliteius, or a lover of the Publick welfare&#146;. It was dedicated to the Edinburgh town council and bound with a shorter work, <span class="italic">A Succinct Survey of the Famous City of Aberdeen</span>, dedicated to the Aberdeen council. Attribution is confirmed by an Aberdeen council minute of 18 November 1685 referring to &#145;the little book latlie emitted be Mr. Alex<sup>r</sup> Skene late baillie, dedicated to the Mag<sup>rats</sup> and Counsell &hellip; to get tuentie thereof for the touns use&#146;  (Aberdeen town council register, vol. 57). The <span class="italic">Succinct Survey</span> is derivative of James Gordon's <span class="italic">A Description of both Touns of Aberdeen</span>, dating from the mid-seventeenth century, but is none the less a vital source for local historians. The <span class="italic">Memorialls</span> is a much more original work. It offers a systematic description of the workings of Scottish burghs from the unique perspective of a magistrate of deep experience and frustrated ambitions; it is open to question whether the book would have been written had Skene been able to continue his career in public office. Though laced with classical and biblical citations that establish the author's learning and piety, it is at heart a straightforwardly practical work that sets forth key legislation pertaining to Scottish burghs, explains the duties of each class of civic office-holder, and offers a wide range of advice on such matters as the planting of orchards in towns; the establishment of public libraries stocked with works on government, law, navigation, and commerce; the furthering of trade; the avoidance of faction; and the instilling of youth with virtue and civic-mindedness.<br>
<br>Alexander Skene died in Aberdeen in January 1694 and was buried, as was his wife three years later, in an unmarked grave in the Quaker burial-ground at Kingswells.<br>
