<span class="headword">Marshall,  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1680, <em>d.</em> 1730), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious writer</span>, the son of John Marshall (1660&#150;1730), rector of St George's, Bloomsbury Way, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Dudley Ryder, was born in London and baptized on 20 October 1680 at St Andrew's, Holborn. He was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on 8 July 1696 and was awarded the degrees of LLB, in 1702, and DD, by royal mandate, in 1717. On 2 March 1700 he married Margaret Wood at St Pancras parish church, Middlesex. They had eight children, the eldest of whom, John (<i>d</i>. 1731), became rector of St John the Evangelist, Bedford Row. Marshall was ordained on 3 June 1705 and his first clerical appointment was in 1706, as vicar of St Pancras, a position he held until 1716, when he became rector of the united parishes of St Vedast, Foster Lane, and St Michael-le-Querne. His other clerical appointments were rector of Finchley (1707&#150;30); lecturer at Aldermanbury church and curate of Kentish Town (1715&#150;30); canon of Windsor (1722&#150;30); and lecturer at St Lawrence Jewry and St Martin Pomeroy, Ironmonger Lane (1727&#150;30). William Whiston's intimation, in his <span class="italic">Life of Samuel Clarke</span>, that Marshall was inclined to Arianism was not widely subscribed to and appears unfounded.<br>
<br>Marshall was the author of several religious works, the first of which was <span class="italic">The Penitential Discipline of the Primitive Church</span> (1714), which was republished in 1844 as part of the <span class="roman">Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology</span>. In this work, described as an &#145;excellent and most serious book&#146;  (Whiston, 99), Marshall demonstrated an extensive knowledge and keen understanding of the history of the early Christian church, a level of scholarship that he maintained in his annotated translation, in 1717, of the works of St Cyrian, archbishop of Carthage, who died in AD 258. These studies earned him a reputation as an authority on Christian antiquity. A more controversial work was <span class="italic">A defence of our constitution in church and state, or, An answer to the charge of the non-jurors accusing us of heresy and schism, perjury and treason</span> (1717). This drew replies from some leading latitudinarians and nonjurors, including Arthur Ashley Sykes, Matthew Earbury, and Hikiah Bedford. Marshall was also the author of numerous occasional sermons on such subjects as the union of England and Scotland (1707), the death of Queen Anne (1714), and charity schools in London (1724), as well as funeral sermons for friends and colleagues, including those for the Revd John Rogers (1729) and the surgeon Richard Blundell (1718).<br>
<br>Marshall died on either 4 or 5 February 1730 and was buried at St Pancras. His collection of books and manuscripts was sold by auction in 1732. His widow published a collection of his sermons under the title <span class="italic">Sermons on Several Occasions</span> (3 vols., 1731), dedicated to Queen Caroline; a fourth volume was published in 1750.<br>
