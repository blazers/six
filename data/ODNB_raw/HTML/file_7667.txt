<span class="headword">Dillon,  Wentworth</span>, fourth earl of Roscommon  (1637&#150;1685), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Dublin, probably in St George's Lane, in October 1637. Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, then lord deputy, was his uncle, his father, James Dillon, third earl of Roscommon (<i>c</i>.1605&#150;1649), having married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Wentworth of Wentworth Woodhouse, Yorkshire, and sister to the earl of Strafford. He was educated in the protestant faith, as his father had been &#145;reclaimed from the superstition of the Romish church&#146; by James Ussher, primate of Ireland  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>: <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, 2.389). For his early years we have only the doubtfully reliable information of Elijah Fenton, who in his memoir of 1730 says that when Dillon was very young, Strafford sent him to study under a Dr Hall at his own seat in Yorkshire. Upon the impeachment of Strafford, Fenton goes on, he was by Archbishop Ussher's advice sent to the learned Samuel Bochart at Caen in Normandy, where there was a long-established protestant university. During his residence there his father died at Limerick in November 1649. Aubrey states that Dillon, possessed by an &#145;extravagant fit&#146;, exclaimed &#145;My father is dead!&#146; and that the news of the death arrived from Ireland a fortnight later  (Aubrey, 162).<br>
<br>After leaving Caen, Roscommon made a tour of France and Germany, accompanied by Lord Cavendish (afterwards duke of Devonshire), later a member of Roscommon's literary circle. This was in the late 1650s, when ardent royalists were unwelcome in England and Ireland. They also stayed a considerable time at Rome, and Roscommon was reputed to have learned the language so well as to be taken for an Italian. In Rome he also acquired great skill as a numismatist.<br>
<br>Soon after the Restoration Roscommon returned to England, and had a favourable reception at the court of Charles II. An act of parliament restoring to him all the honours, castles, lordships, lands, and property in the possession of his great-grandfather, grandfather, or father on 23 October 1641 was read a first time in the English House of Lords on 18 August 1660, and received the royal assent on 29 December. By virtue of this statute he became seised of several estates in co. Meath, co. Westmeath, King's county, and counties Mayo, Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, and Tipperary. He took his seat in the Irish parliament by proxy on 10 July 1661 and began to re-establish his position. On 16 October 1661 he had a grant of the first troop of horse that should become vacant, pursuant to privy seal dated 23 September. In the same year he addressed to the king a petition in which he said that his father and grandfather being protestants, and having from the beginning of the rebellion constantly adhered to the royal cause, lost at least &pound;50,000 or &pound;60,000 for their loyalty to Charles I. Partly owing to the good offices of the duke of Ormond, the king promptly ordered a part payment of arrears. In April 1662 Roscommon married Lady Frances, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3135/', "Richard Boyle, second earl of Cork (later also first earl of Burlington)")</script>, widow of Colonel Francis Courtenay, and niece to Roger Boyle, first earl of Orrery, the well-known statesman and dramatist and thereafter a loyal friend to Roscommon. Shortly after the Restoration Roscommon had made friends who led him into gambling, then popular at court. His gaming led to duels, and he became famous as a duellist though he used to say that he was more fearful of killing others than of losing his own life.<br>
<br>In 1662 Roscommon returned to Ireland, partly to pursue his land interests. To the ensuing years in Ireland belong the first substantial indications of his literary interests, though he had written accomplished verse in both English and Latin as a youth. Katherine Philips praised his early, as yet unpublished translations in a letter of 19 October 1662; Roscommon returned the compliment in more than one of his works and wrote the prologue for Philips's <span class="italic">Pompey</span> of 1663 (his first published poem). There is evidence of the existence of a Dublin literary circle including both these figures in the years 1662&#150;5.<br>
<br>By 1665 Roscommon had recovered all the Irish lands to which he had a title, though he had still received only a fraction of the money promised him by the king in 1661. Through the late 1660s his military duties continued. He received a formal commission for a troop of horse in 1666. He was also involved in local and national government matters, until eventually, in the early 1670s, there was talk of his becoming a lord treasurer of Ireland. Instead, he raised an infantry regiment in Ireland in 1671 to serve the French against the Dutch. He accompanied the regiment, but it was disbanded by the French in Lorraine in 1672. He then returned to Ireland, but became a widower in 1673 or 1674, at which date he seems to have &#145;determined to leave his native country and join himself to the English court&#146;  (Niemeyer, &#145;Life and works&#146;, 73). He soon married again, in London, where on 9 November 1674 he wed Isabella (<i>d</i>. 1721), youngest daughter and coheir of Sir Matthew Boynton of Barmston, Yorkshire.<br>
<br>In 1676 Roscommon became a captain of the band of gentlemen pensioners, a small troop with largely ceremonial duties paid directly by the king; by 1679 he was on the continent again. This may or may not have been on state business, but he was still concerned with political matters. He is recorded as a companion of James, duke of York, later in 1679, and travelled with him during the duke's &#145;exile&#146; to Scotland in 1679&#150;80. Two political poems doubtfully attributed to Roscommon can be dated to 1679&#150;81: &#145;Tom Ross's Ghost&#146; and &#145;The Ghost of the Late Parliament&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1679 (though the title page gives 1680) appeared one of Roscommon's two most substantial literary works, <span class="italic">Horace's Art of Poetry</span>, a translation of Horace's <span class="italic">Ars poetica</span>. The first English version of this famous poem to be published since Jonson's, its blank verse treatment of its original is freer and in several ways more attractive than its predecessors'. The following few years are Roscommon's most productive as a poet. Many of his productions have clear connections with the informal &#145;academy&#146; he established about 1682 in conjunction with George Savile, marquess of Halifax, Richard Maitland (later earl of Lauderdale), the earl of Dorset, Lord Cavendish (later duke of Devonshire), Sir Charles Scarborough, Heneage Finch, John Dryden, and others. These names, as well as the term &#145;academy&#146;, are supplied by Roscommon's friend Knightley Chetwood, whose memoir also shows the circle's interests to have been extensively literary, with a special emphasis on translation from the classics, and not narrowly lexicographical as suggested by Fenton and some other later writers. Hence the clear relationship between the &#145;academy&#146; and Roscommon's <span class="italic">Essay on Translated Verse</span>, published in 1684, in which specific allusion is made to works of verse translation from the Latin and Greek classics recently published by members of the circle. Three of Roscommon's own translations, from Virgil and Horace, appeared in Dryden's miscellany of 1684, and he contributed a commendatory poem to the 1683 issue of Dryden's <span class="italic">Religio laici</span> (Dryden responding with one on Roscommon's <span class="italic">Essay on Translated Verse</span>). The <span class="italic">Essay</span>, probably Roscommon's best-known poem and certainly his most distinguished, is in several ways his most unusual. It helped to usher in the great age of Augustan translation from the classics, drawing on the ideas of Dryden and influencing Pope, two of its greatest exponents. Yet it may also be said to be designed to promote the work of a small clique, Roscommon's translating &#145;academy&#146;. The second edition of 1685, &#145;corrected and enlarged&#146;, includes a new ending in praise of <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> which may well constitute the first printed commendation of the poem.<br>
<br>Of the twenty to twenty-five works attributed to Roscommon, the most extensive of those not yet mentioned is his translation into French of Bishop William Sherlock's treatise <span class="italic">The Case of Resistance of the Supreme Powers</span>. This was undertaken in 1684 at the request of Roscommon's friend the duke of Ormond, and its purpose was evidently to show the French that the Church of England would no longer tolerate such defiance of the notion of divine right as was reflected in recent English history. Its anti-republican stance conforms with Roscommon's own conservative sympathies.<br>
<br>During the 1680s Roscommon must have spent part of his time in Ireland. He was given a new troop of horse there in 1682, and sought the post of master of the ordnance in Ireland in 1684. But he had apparently also been master of the horse to the duchess of York for some years before his death; evidently he had duties in both London and Ireland. A few days before his death, which occurred at his home at St James's Park, St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 17 January 1685, he requested a friend, probably Chetwood, who recounts the story in his memoir of Roscommon, to preach a sermon to him at St James's Chapel. He went in spite of warnings, saying that, like Charles V, he would hear his own funeral oration. Returning home he wrote, Chetwood says  (Chetwood, fol. 44), &#145;an excellent divine poem&#146;, which, however, the physicians would not allow him to finish. Fenton's less plausible account, in which Roscommon's death is brought about suddenly by a quack remedy for gout, has the dying earl pronounce with fervour two lines of his own version of the &#145;Dies irae&#146;:<blockquote>
<div>My God, my Father, and my Friend,<br>
</div>
<div>Do not forsake me at my end.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>He was buried with great pomp in Westminster Abbey, &#145;neare the Shrine staires&#146;, on 21 January 1685  (Chester, 212).<br>
