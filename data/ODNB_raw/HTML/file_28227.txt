<span class="headword">Verneuil,  John</span>  (1582/3&#150;1647), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born in Bordeaux, France, the son of Arnauld Verneuilh (<i>d</i>. in or before 1585), a merchant, and Marguerite, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Forthon (<i>d</i>. before 1611), daughter of Bernard Forthon and Valerie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Peyronin. Both the Verneuilh and Forthon families were protestant. He was educated at the protestant academy at Montauban, receiving an MA before he left for England. On his arrival, he later explained, he had received a &#145;liberal maintenance&#146; from Sir Thomas Leigh (<i>d</i>. 1626) of Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, and had &#145;belonged&#146; to his grandson Thomas Leigh (1594/5&#150;1671), later second baronet  (<span class="italic">Tract of the Sovereign Judge of Controversies</span>, 1628, preface). Since Verneuil and the young Leigh matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, on the same day, 4 November 1608, when they were aged twenty-five and thirteen respectively, the probability is that Verneuil acted as under-tutor. He was admitted as a reader to the Bodleian Library on 31 January 1609.<br>
<br>According to Anthony Wood, once at Oxford Verneuil was assisted by, among others, the authorities of Magdalen College, but he does not appear in the college accounts. He may also have taught Henry Carey, later second earl of Monmouth, who was a fellow-commoner of Exeter College from 1611, and who graduated BA in 1613. In dedicating to Carey his French translation of Lewis Bayly's <span class="italic">Practise of Piety</span>, Verneuil speaks of &#145;un conte du temps que j'ai soustrait &amp; desrob&eacute; de votre service&#146; (&#145;an account of the time which I have taken and snatched from your service&#146;; <span class="italic">La pratique de pi&eacute;t&eacute;</span>). Verneuil married Elizabeth Hill on 20 December 1612, in the church of St Peter-in-the-East, Oxford, and the baptisms, burials, and marriages of a number of their children appear in the parish registers.<br>
<br>It is not clear when Verneuil became underkeeper of the Bodleian Library. A salary of &pound;10 a year was paid to an unnamed officer from the resignation of Philip Price in 1613, but Verneuil is not mentioned in the library accounts until the year 1618/19, when he was paid for going to London to buy books. He made a number of such visits until the year 1631/2. The library's purchases were, no doubt, from the Stationers' Company's Latin stock shop in the grounds of Stationers' Hall. Later his and the librarian's visits became less frequent as the assiduity and efficiency of booksellers such as Henry Featherstone and Robert Martin increased.<br>
<br>In addition to his tutorial and library duties, Verneuil published translations from and into French. In the first category are his <span class="italic">Sermon Preached before the King's Majesty the 15th of June 1615</span> (1620) and <span class="italic">A Tract of the Sovereign Judge of Controversies in Matters of Religion</span> (1628), translations respectively of works by Pierre du Moulin and John Cameron; in the second category is his <span class="italic">La pratique de pi&eacute;t&eacute;</span> (Geneva, 1625), Bayly's original having already run into fifteen editions in English, and <span class="italic">La descouverte de la cautelle du c&#339;ur de l'homme</span> (Geneva, 1634) from the work by Daniel Dyke. <span class="italic">La pratique de pi&eacute;t&eacute;</span> was extremely successful, running to sixteen editions by 1700 and making a significant contribution to the sustenance of a common protestant culture in western Europe. Verneuil also published several supplements to the printed catalogues of the Bodleian Library. He returned to Bordeaux in 1624 to transfer his share in his maternal grandparents' property to his brother Pierre Verneuilh. His MA from Montauban was incorporated at Oxford on 13 December 1625.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Verneuil died in 1634. Verneuil himself succumbed to illness in the winter of 1643&#150;4&#151;probably to plague in the overcrowded city of Oxford&#151;and the library accounts note that he was then too weak to climb the library stairs. He died at his house in the Eastgate in September 1647, and was buried in the church of St Peter-in-the-East on 30 September. No will survives, but an (undated) inventory reveals that his goods and chattels were worth approximately &pound;12  (Oxfordshire County Archives, 89/4/22). Wood's judgement was that by his death &#145;our public library lost an honest and useful servant, and his children a good father&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.222).<br>
