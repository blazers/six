<span class="headword">Carswell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Macfarlane]</span>,  Catherine Roxburgh</span>  (1879&#150;1946), <span class="occ">novelist and book reviewer</span>, was born on 27 March 1879 at 101 Hill Street, Garnethill, Glasgow, the second of the four children of George Gray Macfarlane (<i>d</i>. 1899), and his wife, Mary Anne Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1912), the daughter of George Lewis and his wife, Mary Anne. George Macfarlane was a commission agent who negotiated the shipping and sale of textiles. His erratic business career provided a middle-class lifestyle which was deeply religious. Both Catherine Macfarlane's grandfathers were ministers who left the Church of Scotland at the Disruption of 1843, and her parents were devout evangelicals, active in charitable works and mission: Mrs Macfarlane was especially linked with Jewish missions. This thoughtful life co-existed with Catherine's daring. Around her homes in 101 Hill Street and 172 Renfrew Street she played freely, and during family holidays at Mount Quharrie, near Abernethy, Perthshire, she swapped hanging onto the back rails of horse trams for climbing treetops.<br>
<br>Catherine Macfarlane was educated at Park School, Glasgow, and recalled becoming &#145;at fourteen a life long socialist (through reading Robert Blatchford)&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lying Awake</span>, 16). She rejected her father's Liberalism and his Christianity without dismissing the integrity of her parents' faith. Interests in music and painting were encouraged and she recorded her delight in seeing the first impressionist exhibition in Scotland. She was able to visit relatives in Italy before spending two years at the Schumann Conservatorium, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, studying the piano. She returned in 1901 to Glasgow, where she attended the Glasgow School of Art and met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33558/', "Maurice Greiffenhagen (1862&#150;1931)")</script>, a painter. She took classes in English literature at Glasgow University, where she met Walter Raleigh, professor of English literature, and Donald Carswell, a student contemporary, with whom she collaborated on the <span class="italic">Glasgow University Magazine</span>. From 1907 to 1915 she reviewed fiction and drama for the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>.<br>
<br>Catherine Macfarlane was introduced to Herbert Parry Malpas Jackson (<i>b</i>. 1867/8), Raleigh's brother-in-law, and after a brief courtship the couple married, on 8 October 1904. It soon became apparent that Jackson was mentally unstable, groundlessly accusing his wife of infidelities. Later, when she became pregnant, Jackson became convinced the baby was not his, and after a struggle, during which he had to be deprived of a pistol, he was admitted to a mental hospital suffering from progressive paranoia. A daughter, Diana, was born in October 1905. She died of pneumonia in 1913, aged eight.<br>
<br>Catherine Jackson and her daughter returned to Mrs Macfarlane. In Glasgow she embarked on an affair with Maurice Greiffenhagen. She loved him passionately but he would not leave his wife, and eventually the affair ended. At this time she raised a court action for an annulment of her marriage, on the grounds that Jackson could not have fully understood the marriage contract. In the face of opposition from Jackson's family, and in spite of the fact that the annulment would make Diana illegitimate, she won, and <i>Jackson v. Jackson</i> (1908) was a leading case in matrimonial law until the reforms of the 1930s.<br>
<br>In 1911 Catherine Jackson reviewed D. H. Lawrence's <span class="italic">The White Peacock</span>, recognizing early his significant talent. By 1912 she was in London. Her favourable review of Lawrence's <span class="italic">The Rainbow</span> in 1915 cost her her position with the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, but she quickly became assistant theatre critic to St John Ervine at <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. On 9 January 1915 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63044/', "Donald Carswell (1882&#150;1940)")</script>, who had come to London to work on <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Their marriage lasted until Donald's death in a car accident in the early days of the blackout in 1940. Donald held a variety of jobs and also wrote biography, but he never became the regular provider Catherine Carswell had hoped for&#151;their finances were always precarious. She valued their &#145;real and rich&#146; marriage, particularly their interest in each other's writing. Their son, John Patrick Carswell (<i>b</i>. 1918) remembers his mother as &#145;tall and well-made with brown hair and strong features&#146;  (introduction to <span class="italic">The Savage Pilgrimage</span>, 6).<br>
<br>Carswell first met D. H. Lawrence in 1914. The friendship, initiated by Ivy Low, soon became strong and lasting, and in 1916 they swapped manuscripts of <span class="italic">Open the Door!</span> and <span class="italic">Women in Love</span>. <span class="italic">Open the Door!</span>, a novel with autobiographical elements, follows the growth to maturity of its Glasgow heroine Joanna Bannerman; it is modernist in conception, values, and technique. An epistolary novel, <span class="italic">The Camomile</span>, followed in 1922. In order to write, it was Carswell's habit to hire a room of her own. She took rooms at 17 Keats Grove, Hampstead, eventually moving her family to this building; thereafter she took a room in Windmill Street. The Keats Grove house was given up for one at 35 Gloucester Crescent. She moved repeatedly within London, while also leasing a string of cottages in the home counties, maintaining the pattern of city and country homes that was a successful feature of her childhood.<br>
<br>Carswell achieved literary recognition through <span class="italic">The Life of Robert Burns</span> (1930). Offended by the sentimental mythologizing which surrounded Burns, she aimed to present him candidly and fairly. The work caused much offence to sentimental Burnsians: it was preached against in Glasgow Cathedral and Carswell once received a bullet by post. Owing to the biography's success she made contact with the Scots modernists and identified with their literary projects. She corresponded with Florence MacNeill, Helen Cruickshank, Edwin and Willa Muir, Hugh MacDiarmid, and Neil Gunn. After Lawrence's death in 1930 Carswell was sufficiently angered by Middleton Murry's biography of him, <span class="italic">Son of Woman</span> (1931), to write <span class="italic">The Savage Pilgrimage</span> (1932), an affectionate first-hand portrait. Murry issued a libel writ and the book was reissued in a modified form in 1933. As a result of this row Carswell began corresponding with Vita Sackville-West, though she was not otherwise close to the Bloomsbury group.<br>
<br>In later years Carswell continued to produce anthologies, biography, and theatre history. She became friendly with John Buchan and after his death helped his widow to edit his papers, <span class="italic">John Buchan by his Wife and Friends</span> (1947), which included her own striking memoir. Her last projects were an informal autobiography, <span class="italic">Lying Awake</span> (1950) and preliminary studies for a biography of John Calvin. After bouts of pneumonia and pleurisy in the winter of 1945&#150;6 Catherine Carswell died at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, on 18 February 1946. <span class="italic">The Savage Pilgrimage</span> was reprinted in 1981, and <span class="italic">Open the Door</span> in 1986, both with introductions by her son.<br>
