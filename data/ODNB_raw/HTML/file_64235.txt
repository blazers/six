<span class="headword">Brodzky,  Horace Asher</span>  (1885&#150;1969), <span class="occ">artist and writer</span>, was born on 30 January 1885 in Pakington Street, Kew, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia, the second of the seven children of Maurice Brodzky (1847&#150;1919), journalist and publisher, and Florence Leon (1860&#150;1958), daughter of Szymanski Leon and his wife, Selina Asher. His parents were both Jewish. The name Brodzky means &#145;of Brody&#146;, a small town in western Ukraine, though the nomadic wanderings of the family took them through much of Europe before, and after, reaching Australia. It was a peripatetic existence: in 1904 the Brodzkys sailed for the United States, and four years later they migrated to England.<br>
<br>Horace Brodzky showed artistic talent from an early age. His art education was haphazard and included two short spells in the drawing class at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne (1901 and 1904) and a brief period in London at the City and Guilds Art School (1911). He dated the real beginning of his artistic career to his arrival in Britain and the determination to learn all he could from others. He taught himself enough to be selected as one of the artists representing Britain at the Venice Biennale of 1912&#151;the first Australian to do so.<br>
<br>As a visual artist Brodzky worked chiefly in three media: painting, drawing, and printmaking. His early work in oils&#151;dramatic, strongly coloured, and structured&#151;reveals a number of influences, chief among them that of David Bomberg and Mark Gertler. Walter Sickert encouraged him, and it is possible that he looked at Frank Brangwyn's work. The one great source of inspiration which he himself always claimed was Piero della Francesca.<br>
<br>Brodzky's portraits of Jacob Epstein and Jacob Kramer (both 1915, priv. coll.) and Eugene O'Neill (<i>c</i>.1920) show that he was a good character draughtsman, but his nude studies are often uninspiring. He would have done well to concentrate his energies on the telling masses of the linocut, for it was in this medium that he excelled. He made forty-four in all, mostly between 1912 and 1919, all of which are bold powerful designs of stark black and white contrasts. As regards other kinds of prints, he made a handful of woodcuts in 1912 and again in 1921, and he produced some sixty-two etchings. Many examples of his prints are in the British Museum, London.<br>
<br>The biggest event in Brodzky's life was his friendship with the sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, whom he met in January 1912 and with whom he became close friends. His 1933 biography of Gaudier is by far the most substantial book he wrote. (His two others were short descriptive texts on Jules Pascin and on Gaudier's drawings, both published in 1946.) According to Brodzky, Ezra Pound in his book <span class="italic">Gaudier-Brzeska: a Memoir</span> (1916) misunderstood Gaudier's sculptural ideas. Brodzky always stressed Gaudier's emotional and human strengths, whereas Pound, he felt, encouraged a purely intellectual reading of the work which distorted its humanism and led to a form of spiritual decadence. Although Brodzky was no great stylist, his pen portrait is very readable, vigorously anecdotal, and entertaining. For a man who spent his life largely in the shadow of Gaudier, and whose subsequent reputation has similarly suffered, he was remarkably even-handed and generous in his judgements.<br>
<br>Brodzky was slight in build, but striking. He stooped, as if under the weight of his noble head. (When Gaudier did Brodzky's bust, the head was appropriately larger than life-size.) He had a love of music, and of good food and drink, though he could rarely afford to indulge himself. His was a life of chronic hardship and little success, with too much energy spent as a jobbing artist painting stage decorations or designing book jackets. While in New York for the second time (1915&#150;23) he married, in 1919, Bertha Greenfield (1899&#150;1982), a nanny. The couple had three sons, but the marriage broke down in 1934 after the family had moved to London. From 1948 until 1962 Brodzky was art editor of the <span class="italic">Antique Dealer and Collector's Guide</span>, a magazine founded by his brother Vivian. He lived long enough to see a modest revival of interest in his work and died on 11 February 1969 in London.<br>
