</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jeffreys,  William Rees</span>  (1871&#150;1954), <span class="occ">promoter of roads and road transport</span>, was born at 7 Warwick Place, Paddington, London, on 1 December 1871, the eldest of the four children of William George Jeffreys (1839/40&#150;1890), upholsterer, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Garratt (1843/4&#150;1919), sometime servant, toy dealer, and boarding-house keeper. Though included in <span class="italic">Who's Who in Wales</span> (1921) and sometimes identified as Welsh, Jeffreys never lived in Wales and his family links with it were tenuous, for his father was born in Bristol and his mother in Lincolnshire.<br>
<br>As a child Jeffreys was privately educated; in his late twenties he studied statistics under A. L. Bowley at the London School of Economics. In 1891 he joined the Board of Trade's commercial, labour, and statistical department. In twelve years as a civil servant he never rose above the rank of second division clerk. In 1893 he became the first chairman of the newly formed Association of Clerks of the Second Division, a forerunner of the Society of Civil Servants. In his youth he was a keen cyclist, and in 1902 acquired his first motor vehicle, a Werner motorcycle.<br>
<br>In 1901, while still at the Board of Trade, Jeffreys was appointed honorary secretary of the Roads Improvement Association (RIA), a body relaunched in 1898 to promote the formation of a highway network suitable for the motor car age, though in its early days he and it were closely associated with cycling organizations. Jeffreys had &#145;full authority &hellip; to organize political propaganda in favour of a central highway authority and a state grant for highways&#146;  (Jeffreys, 2). He later became a member of the RIA's council and, eventually, its chairman, a position he retained in the 1950s. He was associated with many other public and commercial bodies. These included the Cyclists' Touring Club, Commercial Motor Users' Association, Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, Town Planning Institute, British Motor Trading Corporation, Surrey Motors, Institution of Automobile Engineers, of which he was honorary treasurer from 1910 to 1933, and several insurance companies. For many years he was prominent in the International Road Congress movement, serving as honorary secretary of the London Congress of 1913.<br>
<br>Through the RIA Jeffreys met many of the pioneer figures of motoring, including John Scott Montagu and Claude Johnson, secretary of the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland (ACGBI, Royal Automobile Club or RAC from 1907). He joined the club in May 1902 and, following Johnson's resignation in 1903, he became its administrative secretary and, along with Basil Joy and Julian Orde, one of the trio in day-to-day control of club affairs. Among Jeffreys' first tasks were to assist in organizing the Gordon Bennett race in Ireland and to lobby MPs over the <span class="roman">Motor Car Bill</span> then before parliament. He also edited the club <span class="italic">Journal</span> and, most importantly, served as secretary of the recently established Motor Union of Great Britain and Ireland (MU), an organization set up within the ACGBI to advance the interests of all motorists, not just the social &eacute;lite who comprised the club.<br>
<br>In 1904, following criticism in <span class="italic">Autocar</span> about lack of leadership at the club, Orde was made its sole secretary. Jeffreys lost his ACGBI post but continued to run the MU. He was &#145;a born organizer&#146; and in some ways his time at the helm was successful  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 July 1910). The union acquired a large branch network, substantial capital reserves, and a membership of more than 14,000, which for a time made it far bigger than either the RAC or Automobile Association. Furthermore, on the union's behalf Jeffreys successfully opposed many attempts to establish local speed limits.<br>
<br>In other respects, Jeffreys left a trail of havoc. Although the union was &#145;a child&#146; of the ACGBI, he had little respect for the &#145;bumbling amateurs&#146; who ran the club. He thought they should stick to social and sporting matters while he led the MU in a direction of his choosing, even if it meant challenging the parent body  (Brendon, 88, 124, 126). His actions soon created difficulties. Under the terms of the <span class="roman">Motor Car Act</span>, 1903, car owners were obliged to pay &pound;1 to register their vehicles with a local authority of their choice. Jeffreys wrote to councils to ascertain their attitudes towards road improvements, speed limits, speed traps, and signposts. He planned to advise ACGBI and MU members to pay their fees only to authorities sympathetic to the motoring interest. But at least one county council officer judged that Jeffreys was, in effect, offering a bribe. When Jeffreys' letter became public knowledge he incurred public criticism and the wrath of senior club members. Montagu thought his attempt to dictate to local authorities &#145;worthy of the Tsar of all the Russias&#146; (Brendon, 100; Tritton, 101). Friction increased as Jeffreys, who has been termed the RAC's &#145;over-mighty subject&#146;, endeavoured to make the union's &#145;influence and authority greater than that of the R.A.C.&#146; (Brendon, 124; <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 20 Oct 1908).<br>
<br>In 1907 Jeffreys &#145;took on the Automobile Association&#146; by pirating its road programme, establishing a network of agents in direct competition with the AA's scouts, and plagiarizing its badge  (Brendon, 124). The AA's secretary, Stenson Cooke, was incensed and retaliated by inviting MU members to defect. Disinterested observers considered the association's grievances justified (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 18 Aug 1907; <span class="italic">The Times</span>, 29 Aug 1907). The <span class="italic">Automotor Journal</span> accused Jeffreys of &#145;Tammany Hall&#146; methods and of &#145;an overweening policy of militant self-aggrandisement&#146;. Montagu deplored his &#145;Napoleon tactics&#146; and capacity to generate ill feeling  (Brendon, 126). Publicly the RAC defended Jeffreys but he was reined in and required to negotiate a settlement with the AA which, for the union, amounted to capitulation. Soon after, the RAC broke with it and a large proportion of MU members opted to join the club's new associate section rather than stay with the union. Jeffreys remained secretary of a much depleted MU until 1910 when, soon after recovering from typhoid, he was appointed secretary of the newly established Road Board at a salary of &pound;1000 per annum. <span class="italic">The Observer</span>'s motoring correspondent judged him &#145;the best qualified&#146; person for the post &#145;for he is really an authority on roads&#146;  (26 June 1910).<br>
<br>The MU marked Jeffreys' departure with a dinner, an inscribed gold watch, and a cheque for &pound;500. Later that year the AA and MU amalgamated. For all his clashes with the RAC and the AA, Jeffreys maintained close links with both. From 1919 he served for many years on the motor legislation committee, a body he played a key part in establishing, which represented them both. He was briefly its deputy chairman. In the 1930s he was a member of the RAC committee.<br>
<br>Jeffreys observed that the Road Board was the first central roads authority in the British Isles since the Romans. It was set up under the terms of Lloyd George's 1909 budget to distribute earmarked moneys derived from motoring taxes (the Road Fund) for the construction and improvement of roads. It lasted from May 1910 to September 1919, when it was incorporated into the newly created Ministry of Transport. Jeffreys served as its secretary for all but its last nine months and soon won praise for his competence  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Dec 1911). However, in 1914 the royal commission on the civil service found &#145;the formal records of the Board's proceedings&#146;, for which Jeffreys was responsible, &#145;most imperfect&#146; (<span class="roman">Fourth Report</span>, 82; Plowden, 101). In later life Jeffreys himself noted that while the board got some things done, its achievements were limited. He attributed its shortcomings mainly to the wide-ranging opposition it encountered and the unsuitability of many of the otherwise distinguished individuals who served on it  (Jeffreys, chap. 4).<br>
<br>At the end of the First World War Jeffreys was &#145;someone whose authority in the world of motoring still counted for more than anyone else's&#146;  (Barty-King, 133). After leaving the Road Board he had more freedom to work as a propagandist for improved roads and highways administration and he did so with a vengeance for over thirty years. He travelled widely in Britain, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australasia, and North America to study his subject and disseminate his ideas. In the process, he became a great admirer of the road networks established in the United States and Germany.<br>
<br>At home Jeffreys was an indefatigable writer, broadcaster, lobbyist, and lecturer in the roads cause. His first letter to <span class="italic">The Times</span> appeared in 1902. Half a century and dozens of contributions later they were still appearing. He also wrote many journal articles and pamphlets. His only book, <span class="italic">The King's Highway</span> (1949), gave an account of the development of Britain's roads since the late nineteenth century, paying special attention to the author's role in the process. It recounted the mistakes and missed opportunities that Jeffreys believed had dogged roads policy and administration for decades.<br>
<br>Jeffreys was involved, as member or witness, in many government inquiries including: the departmental committee on highways administration (1903); royal commission on motor cars (1905); royal commission on London traffic (1905); departmental committee on the taxation and regulation of vehicles (1922); royal commission on cross river traffic (1926); royal commission on transport (1929&#150;30); and House of Lords committee on the prevention of road accidents (1939).<br>
<br>Decades into the age of the motor car Jeffreys believed Britain's unplanned and congested road network was inferior to that of &#145;any other civilised country&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 31 May 1929). He came up with many practical ideas for its improvement. He was the first to propose the construction of a great west road, the initial section of which George V opened in 1925, nearly a quarter of a century after Jeffreys' initial suggestion. He also advocated a road bridge over the River Severn near Chepstow, an orbital London by-pass, and &#145;special roads&#146; restricted to motor traffic alone with no stopping permitted and no pipes or cables laid beneath them. In addition, he favoured using the unemployed on road-building projects, opposed the introduction of driving tests, supported the construction of rest areas for motorists, deplored Churchill's 1926 &#145;raid&#146; on the Road Fund, and lacked enthusiasm for elevated roads as a means of relieving traffic congestion. Overseas he championed construction of an all-weather Cape to Cairo highway and a road linking India, Burma, and China. He believed his greatest professional achievement was to organize tar trials between 1902 and 1907 that led to the introduction of dustless &#145;blacktops&#146; in place of the dusty macadam roads of the past.<br>
<br>From the 1920s Jeffreys' passion was collecting modern art. For comparatively modest sums he acquired, sometimes direct from the artist, a collection that included works by Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Augustus John, Pierre Bonnard, Maurice Utrillo, Raoul Dufy, Jacob Epstein, and Walter Sickert. A contemporary recalled that his collecting principles were first to confine his purchases to the works of living artists (since purchases of the work of dead artists could not encourage further creation), and second to avoid acquiring more than one work from the same artist unless it was an example of a different period or style  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 Nov 1954).<br>
<br>As a young man the diminutive Jeffreys cut a striking figure with his shock of tousled hair and flamboyant moustache  (Barty-King, 44&#150;5, 73, 89). He was ambitious, self-confident, energetic, single-minded, and thick-skinned. Some have seen him as a mischievous, abrasive, and domineering troublemaker with an enthusiasm for road building that verged on the fanatical (Brendon, 88, 100, 124; Plowden, 19). He believed motorists were a beleaguered rather than a privileged minority. He achieved much, though many of his ideas were ignored or implemented only after his death. In his lifetime his knowledge and expertise about roads and their administration were widely recognized, not least by Lloyd George who in 1937 called him &#145;the greatest authority on roads in the United Kingdom and one of the greatest in the whole world&#146;  (Jeffreys, xvi).<br>
<br>Jeffreys never married. In the early twentieth century he, along with two adult siblings, lived in his widowed mother's boarding-house in Paddington. For much of his adult working life he lived at Brecon, Christchurch Park, Sutton, Surrey. He spent his last nineteen years at Wivelsfield Hall, Wivelsfield Green, Sussex, where he died of heart failure, bronchopneumonia, and auricular fibrillation on 18 August 1954. He was buried alongside his sister, Ethel, his lifelong companion, at Wivelsfield parish church on 21 August.<br>
<br>In his lifetime Jeffreys funded a studentship at the London School of Economics and a triennial lecture at the Town Planning Institute. After his death his art collection was auctioned at Christies in November 1954, when it was regarded as the most important collection of nineteenth- and twentieth-century art collected by a single owner to have appeared in the London auction rooms since 1945. The sale of the collection realized &pound;56,344, having been acquired at a cost of only &pound;3332. The sum raised supplied the basis for the Rees Jeffreys Trust; establishment of the trust allowed the funding of many university posts, bursaries, road improvement schemes, and other projects associated with roads and motor transport.<br>
