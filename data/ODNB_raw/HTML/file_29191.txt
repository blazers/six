<span class="headword">Wheelocke,  Abraham</span>  (<em>c.</em>1593&#150;1653), <span class="occ">linguist and librarian</span>, was born in the parish of Whitchurch in Shropshire. He was brought up at Loppington in the same county, and remained deeply attached to Shropshire throughout his life. Wheelocke was always ready to help students from Shropshire, and it appears to have been their common origins that account for his lasting friendship with one of his principal patrons, the merchant Thomas Adams. Wheelocke matriculated as a sizar at Trinity College, Cambridge, at Easter 1611, and graduated BA in 1615 and MA in 1618. In 1619 he was appointed Exeter fellow of Clare College, and in the following year he voted for Thomas Paske as master. He was ordained deacon in London on 19 December 1619 and priest at Peterborough on 22 September 1622. In the same year he was made vicar of the church of Holy Sepulchre in Cambridge, a living which he retained until 1642. In 1623 he was appointed one of the university preachers. In 1625 he proceeded BD but failed to succeed Andrew Downes as professor of Greek. In the following year he became rector of Passenham in Northamptonshire, and he relinquished his appointment in 1627. In 1629 he was nominated public librarian and amanuensis at Cambridge University Library.<h2>
<a name="ProfessorofArabic"></a>Professor of Arabic</h2>While he was at Clare College, Wheelocke, already a competent Hebraist, embarked on the study of Arabic. By 1624 he had made considerable progress. He studied with William Bedwell, and in 1631 Bedwell's wife told Thomas Adams he was &#145;as able as any in the kingdom&#146;  (Holt, 40). Wheelocke also learned Persian, Syriac, and Samaritan, and seems to have obtained at least a smattering of other Eastern languages.<br>
<br>Probably late in 1631 Wheelocke proposed to Thomas Adams that a chair of Arabic be set up at Cambridge, financed either by the City of London or by a merchant company. Adams replied that it would be easier to find an individual ready to subsidize the professorship. Soon after, when he was sure of the approval of the university and of Richard Holdsworth, then professor of divinity at Gresham College, Adams himself promised a salary of &pound;40 for a period of three years. By 23 March 1632 Wheelocke had been installed as the first professor of Arabic in England, with the obligation of lecturing twice a week. Adams continued to pay him for as long as he lived.<br>
<br>Wheelocke's motives for studying Arabic are connected with his piety and his interest in the English church. Like so many of his contemporaries he was drawn by Arabic on account of its use for biblical studies. When urging Adams to found a chair he dwelt on the value of the language for the propagation of Christianity in the East, and his work on the <span class="roman">Koran</span> was undoubtedly intended as an aid to missionaries. For this purpose he regarded the Arabic-speaking Christians as useful vehicles. But he was also attracted by the Christianity of the East as the source of a pristine Anglo-Saxon Christianity free of the Church of Rome. The investigation of such a tradition, in increasing fashion at the time, was an additional incentive for him to study Old English. Wheelocke justified what he called &#145;my two-fold imployment&#146;, his concern with both Arabic and Anglo-Saxon, in a letter to Sir Simonds D'Ewes in January 1640. He wished, he wrote:<blockquote>to compile a body of our Divinity, I say of our doctrine out of the Saxon, &amp; British writers: &amp; to present the papists with these, as a rule to leade them by, if they would be constant to the best Antiquities: most sure it is, that Antiquitie tels us we owe more to the Easterne Church then to Rome: and what of good from Rome, even that we have from the Easterne. (Ellis, 157&#150;9)</blockquote>Wheelocke was clearly fascinated by Arabic as a language&#151;from 1635 on he followed his signature in the registers of Holy Sepulchre with the Arabic &#145;hamdullah&#146; (&#145;thanks be to God&#146;)&#151;but he seems to have had little interest in Arab culture. In the 1640s he hoped to publish a translation of the <span class="roman">Koran</span> into Latin and Greek, together with a refutation, and he dispatched a specimen to Samuel Hartlib. In his letters he revealed a loathing for Islam which went far beyond the frequently rhetorical hostility of his contemporaries. &#145;Set aside some grosse idolatries of the church of Roome, &amp; their Tyrannicall government,&#146; he wrote, &#145;the onlie pressure on the bodie of the Church of Christ is Mahomets <span class="roman">Alcoran</span>&#146;  (Hartlib papers, 33/4/2). He described the <span class="roman">Koran</span> as &#145;full of hipocrisie, falshoode, savage crueltie against the world of mankinde, which it would subdue; &amp; against the sonne of God whom it pretends to advance&#146;  (ibid., 33/4/3).<br>
<br>Although such statements are in accordance with Wheelocke's orthodoxy&#151;in 1639 he expressed his horror to D'Ewes that the ideas of those he regarded as the great heretics of the sixteenth century, Castellio, Servetus, and Socinus, should be &#145;alive againe&#146;, and added &#145;I could wish theire very names were buried&#146;  (BL, Harley MS 374, fol. 133<i>v</i>)&#151;they are in contrast with the efforts of two fellow professors of Arabic, Jacobus Golius at Leiden and Edward Pococke at Oxford, to introduce a more objective approach to Islam by way of a deeper investigation of Muslim culture. Wheelocke's prejudices may also account for Hartlib's decision to reject his specimen, possibly prompted by the German Arabist Christian Ravius.<br>
<br>Wheelocke lectured regularly in Arabic. His few pupils included a number of students from King's College (where his son Abraham would study), such as Robert Austin, Richard Hunt, future Gresham professor of rhetoric, and, most distinguished of all, Thomas Hyde, future librarian of the Bodleian and successor to Edward Pococke as Laudian professor of Arabic at Oxford. To both Austin and Hyde, Wheelocke also taught Persian. In the late 1640s Wheelocke did his utmost to set up an oriental press at Cambridge, and tried to obtain a better set of Arabic types than had been bequeathed by William Bedwell.<h2>
<a name="ProfessorofAngloSaxon"></a>Professor of Anglo-Saxon</h2>Ever since the early 1620s Wheelocke had been particularly helpful to scholars from outside the university who were looking for manuscripts in Cambridge. With his appointment at the university library he had unlimited access to the main Cambridge collection and a limited access, of which he made good use, to the college libraries. He continued to assist his correspondents in locating manuscripts, copying them, or simply checking details. It was thus, in the mid-1630s, that he made the acquaintance of the historian and antiquary Sir Henry Spelman, engaged in his major work, the <span class="italic">Concilia</span>. Wheelocke served him in his quest for Anglo-Saxon manuscripts and, with Spelman's encouragement, turned to the study of Old English himself. In 1638 Spelman agreed to finance a chair for a lecturer and reader of the Old English language and the history of the early British church. In November he gave Wheelocke the vicarage of Middleton in Norfolk, the proceeds of which were to be regarded as part of his salary, even though it was not until 1640 that the lectureship was actually approved by the university.<br>
<br>With Wheelocke's appointment as professor of Anglo-Saxon the study of the subject shifted to Cambridge. It had previously been centred on the library of Robert Cotton in London, but the library had been closed by the king from 1629 to 1631, the year of Cotton's death, largely because of the political significance assumed by the examination of early texts in connection with legal and constitutional history. With his work on the church councils Spelman placed the study of early English documents in the strictly ecclesiastical sphere it had occupied in the sixteenth century, when the principal purpose of research had been to prove a tradition of independence from Rome, linking the reformed Church of England to its Anglo-Saxon predecessor.<br>
<br>Wheelocke's own contribution to Anglo-Saxon studies was immense. The object of the Cambridge lectureship was to publish Old English sources and to prepare an Old English grammar and dictionary. In 1643 Wheelocke published the <i>editio princeps</i> of the Old English translation of Bede's <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica</span> and the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>. He reissued these works a year later, together with an edition of William Lambarde's <span class="italic">Archaionomia</span> of 1568. He based his text of Bede on three manuscripts, one at Cambridge University Library, one at Corpus Christi College, and one in the Cotton Library. The <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> was taken almost entirely from the so-called Winchester text in a manuscript at the Cotton Library; Wheelocke completed it with another codex at Corpus Christi. Because he made no use of the other five surviving manuscripts Wheelocke was severely criticized by Edmund Gibson, who published a further edition of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> at Oxford in 1692, and Gibson's objections were taken up by many subsequent scholars. It has since been proved, however, that Wheelocke was fully aware of the existence of the other codices, but wished only to provide &#145;a consciously selective edition of the Winchester text&#146;  (Lutz, 63). That the original Cotton manuscript should have been almost completely destroyed by fire in the eighteenth century adds to the importance of Wheelocke's work for modern scholars. Objections to his edition as mutilated and incomplete are unfounded, but he is more open to criticism in his failure to identify Anglo-Saxon verse. Accustomed to prose, he knew nothing of the structure of Old English alliterative poetry, as his own attempts at writing it show. He dismissed those sections of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> written in verse as obsolete and coarse. At the time of his death he was also preparing an Old English dictionary and grammar.<h2>
<a name="Librarianandpoet"></a>Librarian and poet</h2>Wheelocke's other great achievements were as librarian of Cambridge University Library. When he was appointed in 1629 the library had barely 1000 volumes; when he died in 1653 it had about 12,000. Such an advance was not due to Wheelocke alone, but he took an active part in persuading donors to present their collections, and, above all, in ordering and describing what actually entered the library. He thus assisted the university in obtaining the collection of some eighty-six oriental manuscripts assembled by Thomas Erpenius, the professor of Arabic at Leiden. The collection had been purchased by the duke of Buckingham in 1625, the year after Erpenius's death, and was finally presented to Cambridge by the widowed duchess in June 1632. It contained a wide variety of Eastern manuscripts, mainly Arabic but also Turkish, Persian, Hebrew, Syriac, Coptic, and Javanese, and included five of the oldest Malay manuscripts in existence. The acquisition of the collection meant that Cambridge, which had previously only had a single Arabic manuscript, could briefly compete with Oxford. In 1648 parliament decided to buy and present to the university library the invaluable collection of 167 books and manuscripts imported from Italy by the London bookseller George Thomason. Although the works were mainly in Hebrew, they also included texts in Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, and Slavonic. Wheelocke described and listed them.<br>
<br>In 1632 Wheelocke renounced his fellowship at Clare College, moved to a house near Queen's College, and, against the advice of Adams, married Clemence Goad (<i>fl</i>. 1610&#150;1653), a widow. She already had a son, Christopher, and had five more children with Wheelocke: Abraham, Sarah, Clemence, Joan, and Ann. Wheelocke often advanced the necessity of supporting so large a family as a reason for his state of permanent financial distress. He seems, however, to have exaggerated his poverty. It has been estimated that for six years after his marriage he had an annual income of about &pound;60, and that this rose to about &pound;130 in 1638. Besides his fear of not having enough money, Wheelocke was haunted by the terror of losing the favour of his patrons (and consequently his salary). This too proved unfounded. Adams paid him throughout his life, and after Henry Spelman's death in 1641, Wheelocke continued to receive his wages, first from Spelman's son John, and then from his grandson Roger.<br>
<br>By nature Wheelocke was sedentary, retiring, and diffident. In the encomium he delivered at Wheelocke's funeral William Sclater, another student of King's who had known Wheelocke well at Cambridge, said &#145;that &hellip; which I observed remarkable, and worthy of universall imitation in him, was, under his many and exceeding abilities, his humble and exceeding modestie; so that others took more notice of him, than he did of himselfe&#146;  (Sclater, sig. E3<i>r</i>). Wheelocke's intellectual accomplishments were appreciated both in England and on the European continent (where his correspondents included Johannes de Laet). John Selden and James Ussher admired him, and John Lightfoot referred to &#145;the Al-learned Mr. Wheelocke, to whom nothing is too difficult or unattainable&#146;  (Lightfoot, sig. b3<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Wheelocke exhibited his versatility in various poems written on royal occasions: Latin verses lamenting the death of Anne of Denmark in 1619, and celebrating the marriage of the future Charles I to Princess Henrietta Maria of France in 1625; Latin and Greek poems on the births of the future Charles II and his sister Mary in 1631; Greek verses on Charles I's coronation in Scotland and the birth of the future James II in 1633 (and those contributed to James Duport's <span class="italic">Thrinothriambos</span> in 1637); and verses in Hebrew and Anglo-Saxon on Charles I's return from Scotland in 1641.<h2>
<a name="Lateryearsanddeath"></a>Later years and death</h2>By 1651 Wheelocke had started to prepare his edition and Latin translation of the gospels in Persian. He was assisted by his former student Robert Austin, then a fellow of King's. In order to conclude his work and see to its publication, Wheelocke took up temporary residence in what he described to Richard Minshull, the vice-chancellor of Cambridge, as &#145;an obscure and little cell&#146; in London  (Todd, 233). The Persian gospels were in fact edited (with Wheelocke's unfinished commentary) by John Pearson, the future bishop of Chester, and published posthumously at Adams's expense in 1657. This other <i>editio princeps</i>, however, was not entirely satisfactory. The Bodleian manuscript (MS Laud. Or.2) and the manuscript in Cambridge University Library (MS Gg.5.26), on which the text is mainly based, are of an inferior translation. At a late stage in his labours Wheelocke borrowed a codex belonging to Pococke (Bodl. Oxf., MS Pococke 241) which contained an earlier and better version translated from Syriac. Wheelocke acknowledged its superiority but was reluctant to ask Austin, already on the verge of a nervous breakdown, to start all over again. Wheelocke's edition was thus immediately surpassed by the version, based entirely on Pococke's manuscript, prepared by his pupil Thomas Hyde for the London polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span>, which also came out in 1657.<br>
<br>Wheelocke's combination of piety and interest in languages induced him to join James Ussher, Brian Walton, William Fuller, Herbert Thorndike, and Bruno Ryves in signing the first printed proposals for the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> on 1 March 1653. He assisted the editors with the Samaritan text, and is said to have intended to help Edmund Castell correct the Syriac and Arabic versions. In the end, however, Wheelocke's tasks were taken over by Hyde. Wheelocke's health had been declining for some time; he died in London, and was buried at St Botolph, Aldersgate, on 25 September 1653.<br>
