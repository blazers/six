<span class="headword">Robinson, Sir  John</span>  (1839&#150;1903), <span class="occ">politician in Natal and journalist</span>, son of George Eyre Robinson, was born at Hull, Yorkshire, on 17 March 1839, and went to Natal with his parents in 1850. The colony was only seven years old, with no secondary schools, so he had little chance of education, apart from the stimulus of &#145;cultured parents&#146;. In his youth Robinson was attracted to the life of a missionary, and then to the law; but he finally turned to journalism in the offices of the <span class="italic">Natal Mercury</span>, which his father had started. When his father's health failed Robinson was able, at the age of twenty-one, to take over management of the paper (31 March 1860). In September 1860 he entered into partnership with Richard Vause, later a prominent mayor of Durban; but Robinson remained editor.<br>
<br>In 1861 Robinson travelled to England by the east coast of Africa, Mauritius, and the Red Sea; he stayed some five months in the United Kingdom, where he studied the International Exhibition of 1862, and lectured on the colony of Natal. He also visited part of the continent before setting out again for Natal. In 1863, aged twenty-four and with considerable knowledge of politics and government gained from his work as a reporter, he was elected to the council for Durban, thus becoming one of the twelve elected members of the old legislative council. He supported union of the states and colonies of South Africa under the British flag. In 1865 he married Agnes, daughter of Dr Benjamin Blaine of Verulam, Natal; they had three sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Robinson continued his newspaper and literary work. The <span class="italic">Natal Mercury</span> grew from a weekly paper to three issues a week, and then became a daily paper. Robinson wrote for the Cape Town press and for British journals such as the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, where his first article, &#145;A South African watering place&#146;, appeared in 1868. He also wrote a novel, <span class="italic">George Linton</span> (1876). His work and reputation as a lecturer became increasingly focused on his political interests.<br>
<br>After some fifteen years' experience of administration of the colony by the crown, Robinson became a strong supporter of responsible government for Natal. He had been impressed by the troubles of the Langalibalele affair in 1873; he favoured a South African federation and was a delegate for Natal at the South African Conference in London in 1876, and faced the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879.<br>
<br>Robinson's friend Sir Harry Escombe opposed self-government for the colony. Robinson was defeated in the elections of May 1882, losing his seat for Durban, but was back in the council in 1884, and in 1887 was chosen as its representative at the Colonial Conference of that year in London. During this visit he was received by Queen Victoria and presented the colony's loyal address on the occasion of her jubilee. In 1888 he represented Natal in the South African Customs Conference which led to the formation of the customs union. He was created KCMG in 1889.<br>
<br>Robinson's determined support for a self-governed colony and for railway links with the interior, expressed in his writings and speeches, gradually convinced his opponents. In 1892 Escombe took up Robinson's cause. Robinson was one of the representatives who went to England in that year to press the colonists' views and present a draft constitution. His efforts succeeded, and on 4 July 1893, when the new regime began, he assumed office as the first prime minister of Natal, with the portfolios of colonial secretary and minister of education. Responsible administration was effected quietly, and while his term of office was uneventful, his government saw the completion of the railways from Durban to Johannesburg and from Natal to the Orange Free State. In March 1897 he resigned on account of failing health, hastening his retirement so that his successor might accept the invitation to Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee. Robinson went to England that summer in a private capacity, and then on to Rome, which he revisited in 1900. In 1899 he wrote <span class="italic">The Colonies and the Century</span> and, in 1900, <span class="italic">A Lifetime in South Africa</span>.<br>
<br>In 1898 the legislature voted Robinson a pension of &pound;500 a year. For the rest of his life he lived mainly in retirement at his home, The Gables, Bayside, Durban, where he died on 5 November 1903. He was buried at the Durban cemetery; the staff of the <span class="italic">Mercury</span> bore him to his grave. His wife survived him. Robinson was regarded as a man of probity, governed by high ideals, and his work as a journalist was lucid and temperate.<br>
