<div class="para">
<span class="headword">McAlpine family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1870&#150;1967), <span class="occ">civil engineering contractors</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_40244"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert McAlpine</span>, first baronet  (1847&#150;1934)<span class="occ"></span>. He was born on 13 February 1847 in Newarthill, Lanarkshire, the second of four children and elder son of Robert McAlpine (1816&#150;1853), a colliery manager, and Ann Paterson (1823&#150;<i>c</i>.1900), a weaver's daughter. Because of his father's early death Robert left the local parish school at the age of ten in order to contribute to the family income by working as a trapper in a local coalmine. In July 1858 his mother married Thomas Reid Malcolm; they had eight sons. By 1862 Robert was working at the coalface, but left two years later to become an apprentice bricklayer in Coltness. In 1868 he went into business as a jobbing brickbuilder, and on 12 June married Agnes Hepburn (<i>d</i>. 1888), the daughter of a master shoemaker from the Lanarkshire village of Forth. They had six sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Robert McAlpine worked on small building and repair jobs in Lanarkshire until 1872, when he won his first major contract, to build 100 miners' cottages at Stonefield near Hamilton. The profits from the contract enabled him to expand the business; by 1877 he regularly employed over one hundred men (including, for a brief period, the blacklisted Lanarkshire miner and later Labour politician, James Keir Hardie), and his annual turnover exceeded &pound;100,000. In 1875 he began to invest in property, building tenement houses and villas to let in Hamilton, Stonefield, and Motherwell. He leased three brickworks to provide him with the raw materials required for the business, but he also experimented with the use of concrete to make lintels and doorsteps, and by 1876 was building house walls of rubble concrete blocks. The use of concrete was rare in the Scottish building industry at this time, and Robert's activities earned him the nickname Concrete Bob.<br>
<br>Like most rising businessmen in central Lanarkshire, Robert's political sympathies lay with the Liberal Party. In 1878 he was elected to Hamilton town council to represent the Burnbank ward, in which he built most of his houses. He did not seek re-election in 1881, owing to a dramatic change in his personal fortunes. Robert's house-building ventures collapsed in 1880, in the midst of a severe economic recession. It became increasingly difficult to let his properties, and he was therefore unable to gather sufficient sums in rent to meet interest payments on loans and mortgages raised to acquire land and build houses, and which were secured on the property. With debts of about &pound;90,000, and assets which were almost all in the form of unwanted property, he was forced to petition for the sequestration of his estate.<br>
<br>In January 1880, with financial ruin looming, Robert took his cashier, William Richmond, into partnership in his contracting business. By the terms of the agreement, Richmond became sole partner when Robert became bankrupt. This manoeuvre prevented the business from falling into the hands of Robert's creditors, and he was able to continue to win contracts, albeit nominally as an employee of the firm, until he was discharged from bankruptcy in August 1881. In the summer of the following year the firm won a contract worth over &pound;300,000 to build what was believed to be the largest factory in Europe, for the Singer Manufacturing Company, at Kilbowie, Dunbartonshire. The successful progress of the contract enabled Robert, in January 1883, to dissolve the partnership with Richmond and regain sole ownership of his business.<br>
<br>In 1884 Robert won the contract to build the Barrhead to Ardrossan section of the Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway&#151;his first major public works contract. As on previous contracts, he employed his two brothers-in-law, his brother William, and five of his half-brothers, the Malcolms, as site managers and foremen. He also brought his eldest sons, Robert junior and William, into the business, which became known as Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons. <a name="cosubject_58867"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert McAlpine</span>, second baronet  (1868&#150;1934)<span class="occ"></span>, born at Forth, Lanarkshire, on 17 October 1868, studied mathematics and chemistry at the University of Glasgow in 1886&#150;7; he continued into 1888, studying civil engineering, but left before the end of the academic year. Robert proved to have an aptitude for engineering and site management. His brother <a name="cosubject_49338"></a><span class="headword">William Hepburn McAlpine</span>  (1871&#150;1950)<span class="occ"></span>, born on 31 October 1871 at Daffanbank, Merry Street, Motherwell, proved an efficient administrator in the firm's head office in Glasgow. In April 1893 Robert and William became their father's partners. Between 1884 and 1904, Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons built nearly 150 miles of railway in Scotland and Ireland, pioneering the use of mass concrete in railway works. The firm's most famous contract was for the construction of the 40 mile Mallaig extension to the West Highland Railway in 1897&#150;1901, which included the impressive 21 arch Glenfinnan Viaduct, and the Borrodale Viaduct, which featured the longest concrete bridge span (127 ft 6 in.) ever to have been built. McAlpine's third son, <a name="cosubject_40247"></a><span class="headword">Sir (Thomas) Malcolm McAlpine</span>  (1877&#150;1967)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 19 June 1877 at Hamilton, Lanarkshire, began work for the firm on the Mallaig contract, but in 1898 was struck by flying debris while supervising blasting operations. He was rushed to Glasgow and his injuries attended to by the famous surgeon, Sir William Macewen. His place on the contract was taken by his younger brother, <a name="cosubject_47882"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alfred David McAlpine</span>  (1881&#150;1944)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born at Bothwell Street, Hamilton, on 6 November 1881. Malcolm returned to work with the firm in 1899, and became a partner that year. Alfred became a partner in 1902. Granville McAlpine (1883&#150;1928), Robert's youngest surviving son by his first marriage, became a partner in 1905 but left in 1910; he worked only periodically for the firm thereafter, as a salaried agent and, after 1924, as a junior partner.<br>
<br>Agnes McAlpine died in childbirth in April 1888. On 21 August of the following year, Robert married Florence Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1910), the daughter of William Palmer, a doctor of Roxburgh, Newtonhamilton; they had three children. On 22 December 1896 Robert McAlpine junior married Lillias Cooper Bishop (1876&#150;1948), daughter of Thomas G. Bishop, the founder of Cooper &amp; Co. They had one son and two daughters. William McAlpine married Lillias's younger sister, Margaret Donnison Bishop (<i>d</i>. 1970) on 6 April 1898; they had three sons and two daughters. Malcolm McAlpine married Maud, daughter of James Gibson Dees of Whitehaven, on 2 September 1903; the couple had three sons. Alfred McAlpine married Ethel May (<i>d</i>. 1961), daughter of James Williams, in 1907; they had one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49881/', "Alfred James (Jimmie) McAlpine (1908&#150;1991)")</script>, and two daughters.<br>
<br>Robert McAlpine senior ceased to take charge of individual contracts after 1898, and after 1906 he delegated the task of making up tenders for major contracts to his sons and their staff. He continued to be involved in the firm, however, negotiating with clients and touring worksites. He became particularly interested in the concept of garden cities, and he ensured that many of the ideas of the movement were adopted in the development of the Holy City, a large tenement housing estate which the firm built during 1904&#150;10 in Radnor Park, near the Singer factory in Kilbowie. The estate was devastated during a German bombing raid in 1941, and was acquired from McAlpines by Clydebank burgh council after the war.<br>
<br>In 1900 McAlpines won its first contract in England, for the construction of a graving dock at Hebburn, on the Tyne. In 1905 Malcolm McAlpine set up the Victoria Agency in London as part of a plan to win contracts for the firm in England, and by 1914 McAlpines had worked successfully on a number of reservoir and railway contracts south of the border. The volume of work in England increased dramatically during the First World War, when the firm was engaged to build army camps, munitions factories, and aerodromes.<br>
<br>Malcolm McAlpine moved his family home to Northwood in 1909, and in 1917 bought Fairmile Court in Cobham, Surrey. His father moved to Hertfordshire in 1912, and then to Knott Park, in Oxshott, Surrey, in 1916. The head office was transferred to London in 1916, and Robert junior (in 1917), and finally William (in 1920), settled in England shortly afterwards. In 1918 Alfred, who had lived in Wales since 1911, settled at Marchwiel Hall, near Wrexham in Wales.<br>
<br>Robert McAlpine's political sympathies switched from the Liberals to the Conservative Party at some time in the early 1900s, but he had no objection when, in April 1918, his daughter Roberta (<i>b</i>. 1898) married Richard Lloyd George, eldest son of the prime minister. In June that year McAlpine was created a baronet. He celebrated the honour by donating &pound;15,000 to help set up the Institute of Agricultural Botany at Cambridge. In 1921 Malcolm McAlpine was made KBE for services rendered to the Ministry of Munitions&#151;largely for his role in ensuring completion of the controversial motor transport depot at Slough in 1919. Alfred, who was chairman of the Wrexham division of the Conservative Party in 1921&#150;8, became high sheriff of Denbighshire in 1923, and a life governor of Wrexham War Memorial Infirmary. He was knighted in 1932 in recognition of his public service.<br>
<br>During the 1920s McAlpines built many new council house estates, such as Bellingham for London county council and Wilbraham for Manchester corporation; won road contracts such as those for the construction of the Birmingham to Wolverhampton road and the reconstruction of a section of Watling Street; and was engaged by the crown agents for the colonies to build Takoradi harbour on the Gold Coast. The company's reputation as a pioneer of concrete construction techniques was instrumental in winning its most prestigious contract of the decade, for the construction of Wembley stadium and the British Empire Exhibition buildings. The chief architects, John Simpson and Maxwell Ayrton, and the consulting engineer Evan Owen Williams (1890&#150;1969), were determined to use ferroconcrete extensively in the work, because of its relative cheapness as a building material, and in order to dispel a common belief that concrete was an ugly material which should be hidden away behind facing bricks, stone cladding, or some other disguise. Wembley stadium was begun in 1922 and completed in time to host the Football Association cup final on 28 April 1923. The massive palaces of industry and engineering, and the other exhibition buildings, were completed at the end of the year. Sir Robert McAlpine senior believed that the exhibition buildings offered final proof that a British dislike and suspicion of concrete construction was finally being overcome, and he proclaimed to a reporter from the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> that &#145;we have now definitely entered the concrete age&#146;  (12 Nov 1923).<br>
<br>McAlpines followed up its success at Wembley by building the critically acclaimed Black Cat factory in Camden and the Firestone Tyre and Rubber Company's factory at Brentford. In 1929 the firm began work on the Dorchester Hotel in London's Park Lane, and the hotel opened in 1931. McAlpines, which was a member of the syndicate that financed the venture, bought out the sole remaining partner in 1937 and the Dorchester was run by the McAlpine family, through Dorchester Hotel Ltd, until 1976.<br>
<br>In 1925 the McAlpines became involved in the sugar-beet industry, building a factory at Wissington for British Sugar Manufacturers and subsequently building others at Peterborough, Selby, Bardney, and Brigg. William McAlpine was convinced by optimistic forecasts about the industry's future, and the firm accepted shares and debenture stock in British Sugar and the Central Sugar, Lincolnshire Beet Sugar, Second Lincolnshire Beet Sugar, and Yorkshire Sugar companies, after building factories in partnership with the Dyer Company of Cleveland, Ohio.<br>
<br>After the First World War, the semi-retired Sir Robert continued in his role of elder statesman of the firm, touring sites and offering advice to his sons and interviews to the press, when they were sought. Robert junior, too, took a back seat during the 1920s, leaving William in charge of central financial and administrative matters. Sir Malcolm and Alfred, with an army of trusted managers, remained in charge of important sites and project management, although William was sometimes called upon to return to site management&#151;most notably when he took charge of contracts, each worth over &pound;2 million, for the enlargement of Tilbury docks, 1926&#150;9, and Southampton docks, 1927&#150;35. The three brothers shared the responsibility for the strategic direction of the business.<br>
<br>Sir Robert McAlpine died at his home, Knott Park, Oxshott, on 3 November 1934. Robert junior inherited his title, but died just thirteen days later, on 16 November, during a sea voyage <i>en route</i> for Cape Town. His son, (Alfred) Robert, inherited the baronetcy from his father, but he took no part in the affairs of the firm, and William was made chairman of McAlpines. William died on 20 February 1950 at his home, Badgemore House, Badgemore, Henley-on-Thames, and was succeeded at the head of the company by Sir Malcolm.<br>
<br>During the late 1920s and early 1930s McAlpines created a number of limited companies to complete large contracts, or take responsibility for contracts undertaken in a geographical area&#151;Sir Robert McAlpine (London) Ltd, for example, was engaged on major dock construction and extension contracts in London during the late 1920s. McAlpine (Midland) was set up in 1930, and in 1934 the other partners agreed that the subsidiary should be run by Sir Alfred alone, as his own business. In 1940 Sir Alfred and his son Jimmie formed a new company, Sir Alfred McAlpine &amp; Son, to acquire the business of McAlpine (Midland), thus ending their formal ties with McAlpines.<br>
<br>The McAlpines were a family of keen sportsmen. Sir Robert and Robert junior were enthusiastic sailors, and the latter regularly participated in Cowes week in his schooner <i>Suzanne</i>. The four eldest sons owned racehorses, and Sir Malcolm (who set up his own stable with Pat Hartigan in 1913) achieved the greatest successes in 1921, when Shaun Spadah won the Grand National, and in 1952, when Zabara won the Thousand Guineas at Newmarket. Sir Alfred was active in promoting county cricket in north Wales, serving as president of the North Wales Cricket Association, and he was also an enthusiastic supporter of both Manchester City and Wrexham football clubs. Sir Alfred died at Marchwiel Hall on 25 May 1944.<br>
<br>Sir Malcolm, who had served as chairman of the home ores committee during the First World War, and as chairman and then vice-president of the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors during the 1930s, became chairman of the Committee of Engineers and Contractors and of the Opencast Coal Technical Advisory Organisation during the Second World War. He was most proud of his role in designing the concrete breakwaters built by McAlpines and other firms for the Mulberry harbours, deployed in France after D-day in 1944. McAlpines continued to rank as one of Britain's leading firms of contractors after 1945. William's and Sir Malcolm's sons, who had begun working for McAlpines in the 1920s and 1930s, played an increasingly active role in the firm's activities after the war, and ensured that it remained a family firm. Sir Malcolm died at North Foreland Hall, Cliff Road, Broadstairs, Kent, on 12 April 1967.<br>
<br>From the First World War, Sir Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons was recognized as one of Britain's leading public works contractors. Significantly, the most famous British folk-song celebrating the life of the itinerant construction site worker, or &#145;navvy&#146;, written during the early 1950s by Dominic Behan, was entitled &#145;McAlpine's Fusiliers&#146;. The company, trading in the early twenty-first century as Sir Robert McAlpine, remains a leading building and civil engineering contractor in the UK.<br>
