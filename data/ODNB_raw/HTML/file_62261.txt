<span class="headword">Evans,  (Emyr) Estyn</span>  (1905&#150;1989), <span class="occ">geographer</span>, was born on 29 May 1905 at 12 Havelock Terrace, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, the fourth of the five children of the Revd George Owen Evans (1865&#150;1920), and his wife, Elizabeth (1864&#150;1944), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones. His parents were both Welsh-speaking and the Revd Evans&#151;a Methodist&#151;later moved from Shrewsbury to a poorer parish across the Welsh border. Estyn Evans was educated at Welshpool county school (1915&#150;22) before going to the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, in 1922 to study geography and anthropology under the tutelage of H. J. Fleure. After graduating with a BA in 1925, Evans was prevented by tuberculosis from undertaking postgraduate study at Oxford and it was not until 1928&#151;albeit then aged only twenty-three&#151;that he was appointed to the first post in geography at Queen's University, Belfast. Two days after his successful interview, he met his future wife, Gwyneth Lyon Jones (1908&#150;2003); they married on 27 August 1931 and had four sons, David (<i>b</i>. 1934), Colin (<i>b</i>. 1939), Edwin (<i>b</i>. 1943), and Alun (<i>b</i>. 1944).<br>
<br>Evans struggled long and hard during the 1930s, and the straitened years of the Second World War, to establish his discipline and department in Queen's, encountering an often hostile academic environment in which geography was for long regarded as an adjunct to geology. Consequently, it was only in 1947 that geography was granted the status of a single-honours course, and not until 1955 that Evans was able to offer a first-year course in his own subject. He was appointed professor of geography in 1945, in which post he remained until resigning in 1968 to accept the university's invitation to become the first director of the newly established Institute of Irish Studies. What was by then a flourishing department of geography was by no means his only achievement. He was awarded the degrees of MA (1931) and DSc (1939) from Aberystwyth, together with five honorary degrees. Evans was also instrumental in originating departments of archaeology (1948) and social anthropology (1960) at Queen's, and played a leading role in the creation of the Ulster Folk Museum at Cultra, co. Down (established in 1958), which was designed to record a way of life then fast disappearing. In 1970, the same year in which Queen's appointed him emeritus professor in geography and Irish studies, he was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>Because Evans published largely in Ireland, his work was never as well known in Britain as it deserved. In contrast, however, he was widely recognized in the United States and is often compared to the influential Berkeley geographer Carl Sauer. Evans's geographical context was dominated by Ireland and its setting on the Atlantic margins of Europe. Fascinated by borders and frontiers, and the infinite variety of folk adaptations to a bewildering array of environments, he created an Ireland of regional diversity in which differences were as important as similarities. It was a moral world, too, for while Evans had long lost his father's faith, his geography is defined by a humanistic vision of the total inheritance of Irish heritage, irrespective of formal creeds. For Evans, Irishness was a complex fusion of processes operating at a variety of scales from the intimacy of locality to the wider embrace of the Atlantic world. This vision of a pluralistic place was&#151;and remains&#151;a powerful riposte to the simplifying certainties of traditional Irish nationalism.<br>
<br>Evans published numerous academic papers, archaeological surveys, excavation reports (especially that on Lyle's Hill, co. Antrim), and contributions to reviews, magazines, and newspapers, many posthumously collected in <span class="italic">Ireland and the Atlantic Heritage</span> (1996). His output is dominated, however, by seven books, of which the most enduring in popular terms is <span class="italic">Irish Folk Ways</span> (1957). In the contemporary context, however, the most important may be <span class="italic">Mourne Country</span> (1951), now widely recognized as a classic study of the interrelationships between place and identity, and <span class="italic">The Personality of Ireland</span> (1973). The latter is not an easy book, but it distils Evans's vision of Ireland as a complex and diverse place, a conceptualization which provides his work with an enduring relevance as subsequent generations seek to break down the malevolent legacy of ethnic conflict. Following his death in Belfast on 12 August 1989 after a long illness and his cremation on 15 August at the Roselawn crematorium, Belfast, it was entirely appropriate that Evans's life's work was marked by a memorial service held on 9 December 1989 at the Ulster Folk Museum, the institution which embodied his belief that regional diversity should be seen as a source of richness and integration rather than division.<br>
