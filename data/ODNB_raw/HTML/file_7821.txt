<span class="headword">Donne,  William Bodham</span>  (1807&#150;1882), <span class="occ">essayist and examiner of plays</span>, was born on 29 July 1807 at Mattishall, near East Dereham, Norfolk, the only child of Edward Charles Donne (1777&#150;1819), physician, and his cousin Anne Vertue Donne (1781&#150;1859). His grandfather William Donne was an eminent Norwich surgeon. The poet John Donne may have been his direct ancestor, and the poet William Cowper's mother was great-aunt to both of his parents. Donne was educated at the grammar school, Hingham, before going in 1819 to Edward VI Grammar School at Bury St Edmunds, where he became friends with schoolmates Edward FitzGerald (later translator of <span class="italic">The Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t of Omar Khayyam</span>) and John Mitchell Kemble, who became an Old English scholar. His lifelong friendship with the Kemble family stimulated his interest in the drama. After receiving tuition from the Revd Williams of Thornham, near Bury, in 1826 Donne entered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, but his objections to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> prevented him from taking his degree. While at Cambridge, Donne became a member of the exclusive Apostles club, which also included Kemble, Alfred Tennyson, and Arthur Hallam.<br>
<br>After leaving Cambridge, Donne retired to Mattishall, where, on 15 November 1830, he married his cousin Catharine (1798&#150;1843), daughter of Charles Hewitt (1771&#150;1847), and also a niece of Cowper's cousin and friend John Johnson. The couple had five children before Catharine's death: Charles Edward, who married J. M. Kemble's daughter Mildred; William Mowbry; Frederick Clench; Katherine Blanche; and Valentia. In 1846 Donne moved to Bury St Edmunds to educate his sons and there became friends with headmaster William Donaldson. Other friends included H. Crabb Robinson, Bernard Barton, Lamb's friend Manning, and George Borrow. A Liberal, Donne supported the repeal of the corn laws, but his scholarly nature prevented him from becoming a party man. In 1852 he declined the editorship of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> because he believed that &#145;his habits of life were too retired to keep him in the current of public opinion&#146;  (Johnson, 189). He did, however, accept the librarianship of the London Library that same year.<br>
<br>In 1857 Donne resigned that post to become the examiner of plays in the lord chamberlain's office. From 1849 to 1856 he had served as acting examiner for J. M. Kemble, who was consistently abroad. As both unofficial and official examiner, Donne exercised considerable influence over Victorian drama, as reflected in periodic caricatures in the illustrated papers, in which the artists emphasized his prominent nose, bushy eyebrows, and distinctive dundrearies. Best-known for his refusal to license <span class="italic">Camille</span> in 1853 and his efforts to continue the suppression of <span class="italic">Jack Sheppard</span> and <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span> in 1859, Donne censored content that he regarded as &#145;indecent or profane, or politically objectionable&#146;  (&#145;Select committee &hellip; theatres&#146;). Genuinely interested in the state of British drama and sometimes more liberal than the general public in matters of taste, Donne nevertheless bowed to middle-class views of appropriate dramatic content and thus effectively limited the ways in which playwrights could explore serious topics. He served as examiner until 1874, when he was succeeded by E. F. S. Pigott.<br>
<br>Donne contributed many essays to the <span class="italic">British and Foreign</span>, <span class="italic">Edinburgh</span>, <span class="italic">Quarterly</span>, <span class="italic">Saturday</span>, and <span class="italic">Westminster</span> reviews, as well as to <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, among others. He was complimented by contemporaries on his taste and delicate humour. Donne published <span class="italic">Old Roads and New Roads</span>, which drew on his knowledge of classical literature and modern history, in 1852, when he also edited <span class="italic">Magic and Witchcraft</span>. <span class="italic">Essays upon the Drama</span>, selected from Donne's periodical writings, was published in 1858 and reissued in 1863. In 1867 Donne edited <span class="italic">The Correspondence of King George the Third with Lord North</span> at Queen Victoria's request. Among his classical writings were the <span class="italic">Euripides</span> (1872) and <span class="italic">Tacitus</span> (1873) volumes of W. Lucas Collins's <span class="roman">Ancient Classics for English Readers</span>.<br>
<br>Donne died at his home in London at 25 Weymouth Street, Portland Place, on 20 June 1882 and was buried in Shooters Hill cemetery, Blackheath.<br>
