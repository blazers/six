<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Valence,  Aymer  de</span>, eleventh earl of Pembroke  (<em>d.</em> 1324), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29481/', "William de Valence (d. 1296)")</script>, the half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12950/', "Henry III")</script>, and therefore closely related to both the kings of England who ruled during his lifetime; through his mother, William de Valence's wife, Joan de Munchensi (<i>d</i>. 1307), he was descended from the Marshal earls of Pembroke.<h2>
<a name="Birthandfamily"></a>Birth and family</h2>The date and place of birth of Aymer de Valence are both unknown. The evidence of proofs of age suggests a date somewhere between 1270 and 1275, but his father's return to England in January 1273, after crusading with the Lord Edward, implies a date towards the end of this period. Since William de Valence spent a considerable part of 1273 and 1274 on royal business in the vicinity of Limoges, and in close proximity to his own French lands, there is at least a possibility that his wife accompanied him and that Aymer was born in France. Although Aymer took his family name either from Valence, a few kilometres south-east of Lusignan and on the outskirts of Couh&eacute; south of Poitiers, or from another Valence north of Angoul&ecirc;me and north-east of Montignac, there is no positive evidence to support either of them as his actual birthplace.<br>
<br>Aymer was his parents' third and only surviving son. His eldest brother, John, died in 1277 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to his sister Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1276). Until William de Valence the younger was killed in Wales in June 1282 Aymer had been destined for an ecclesiastical career, like his uncle and namesake in the reign of Henry III: a petition to the pope in May 1282 requesting that Aymer be provided with a plurality of benefices described him as &#145;a youth of good ability, recommended by his study of letters and his manners and merits&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SC1/13/204; <span class="italic">CClR, 1279&#150;1288</span>, 188).<h2>
<a name="Frenchinheritance"></a>French inheritance</h2>As the ultimate heir of both his parents, Aymer de Valence held lands in England, Wales, and Ireland, and would have occupied a leading place in English magnate society whatever the politics of the time. However he was also one of the last holders of an English earldom to be closely linked with France both by descent and by the tenure of land. He was the grandson of Hugues (X) de Lusignan, count of La Marche (<i>d</i>. 1249) and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14483/', "Isabella of Angoul&#234;me (c.1188&#150;1246)")</script> and widow of King John of England, who belonged to two of the great families of Poitou in central France. On the death of his father in May 1296 Valence inherited Rancon (held from the bishop of Limoges); Bellac and Champagnac (held from the abbess of La R&egrave;gle at Limoges), all to the north of Limoges and within the county of La Marche; and Montignac (held from the bishop of Angoul&ecirc;me) on the River Charente, a few kilometres to the north of Angoul&ecirc;me, of which county it formed part. When Guiard de Lusignan, the last count of La Marche and Angoul&ecirc;me, died in 1308, Valence's claims to succeed to these strategically placed territories were sufficiently strong for Philippe IV of France to buy them out in 1309 in return for 1000 livres tournois and Valence's liege homage. He visited France at least six times between 1296 and 1307, and on eleven occasions (mainly on official business) between 1307 and his death there in 1324. The magnificent Valence casket decorated with the arms of the families to whom Aymer was related, which was made for either William or Aymer and is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, shows very vividly the extent of his continental connections.<h2>
<a name="Marriagesandillegitimateson"></a>Marriages and illegitimate son</h2>Valence's ties with France were strengthened by his two marriages. The first was to Beatrice, daughter of Raoul de Clermont, lord of Nesle in Picardy and constable of France, and took place before 18 October 1295. A single surviving letter from Beatrice, calling herself &#145;la soune lyge compayne e amye&#146; to Valence in 1296  (TNA: PRO, SC1/18/183), suggests an affectionate relationship between the two, but otherwise little is known about her. Beatrice died in September 1320, and was buried in the church of the Benedictine priory at Stratford-le-Bow in Middlesex. On 5 July 1321 in Paris, Aymer married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53073/', "Mary de St Pol (c.1304&#150;1377)")</script>, daughter of Gui de Ch&acirc;tillon, count of St Pol and butler of France. She brought to the marriage lands at Tours-en-Vimeu, Thi&egrave;vre, Oreville, and Fr&eacute;acans, in the area of the Pas-de-Calais, which she retained until 1372.<br>
<br>There is no record of any children by either of Valence's marriages, but he had an illegitimate son, Henry de Valence, with an unknown partner. This relationship may be one source of the tradition, for which there is no evidence, that Valence married an unnamed daughter of the count of Bar. The fact that he was briefly held prisoner in Bar in 1317 may also have something to do with the story. Henry de Valence was a knight who served in his father's retinue between 1315 and 1319; in 1317&#150;18 he was a hostage for Aymer in Bar; he died in 1322, leaving a widow named Margery.<h2>
<a name="ServicetoEdwardI"></a>Service to Edward I</h2>Aymer de Valence's first recorded action was to accompany his father on a diplomatic mission to Cambrai early in 1296; at Westminster on 14 July 1297 he took the oath of fealty to Prince Edward as Edward I's successor; in the same year he was knighted and in 1297&#150;8 accompanied Edward I to Flanders. He was involved in diplomatic negotiations with France in 1297, in 1299 (the treaty for Edward I's remarriage), 1301, 1302, and 1303, and in 1304 was to have joined Prince Edward on his proposed visit to France to do homage for Aquitaine. He fought in Scotland, at Falkirk, in 1298, and again in 1299, 1300 (the siege of Caerlaverock), 1301, and 1302. In 1303 he commanded the English forces south of the Forth, and in April 1306 was appointed captain of the north after the killing of his brother-in-law John Comyn by Robert Bruce, whom he defeated at Methven in June. Although in May 1307 he was himself defeated by Bruce at Loudoun Hill, in August he was appointed by the new king, Edward II, as keeper of Scotland.<h2>
<a name="ThedisputeoverGaveston"></a>The dispute over Gaveston</h2>On 26 October 1307, following his mother's death, Aymer de Valence succeeded to the title and to the lands of the earldom of Pembroke in England, Wales, and Ireland (the lordship of Wexford). In November 1307 he went to France to complete arrangements for Edward II's marriage to Isabella, daughter of Philippe IV of France, and in mid-January 1308 he conducted Edward from Dover to Boulogne, where the king was married on 25 January. Although the new earl of Pembroke had witnessed the charter creating Gaveston earl of Cornwall on 6 August 1307, it is likely that by 1308 he was becoming concerned about the arrogance of Gaveston's behaviour. However Pembroke's involvement in the &#145;Boulogne declaration&#146; of 31 January 1308 was primarily caused by the need to end the financial and administrative abuses of royal government which had continued from the reign of Edward I. There is no indication of any personal hostility between Pembroke and the king. Pembroke helped to persuade Edward II to accept magnate demands for Gaveston's exile in May 1308, but in March 1309 went to Avignon on Edward's behalf in a successful attempt to persuade the pope to sanction Gaveston's return to England. Pembroke's political attitude soon changed, however, partly because of the king's failure to implement the reforms agreed at Stamford in August 1309, but also because of the behaviour of Gaveston, who bestowed one of his notorious nicknames on Pembroke, whom he allegedly described as Joseph the Jew &#145;because he was pale and tall&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historia Anglicana</span>, 1, 115).<br>
<br>In March 1310 Pembroke was elected as one of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50153/', "lords ordainer")</script> who were reluctantly authorized by the king to draw up a programme of reform. Despite several appeals from Edward II, Pembroke maintained his distance from the court, and in September 1310 refused to join Edward and Gaveston in a new campaign in Scotland, although he did send a token force to observe the letter of his military obligations. Pembroke played an active part in the drafting of the ordinances, whose publication he witnessed on 27 September 1311. In March 1312 Pembroke was appointed by an assembly of prelates and magnates to pursue and capture Gaveston, who had returned to England from his latest exile in late 1311 or early 1312. On 17 May Pembroke and the earl of Surrey besieged Gaveston in Scarborough Castle; and on 19 May Gaveston surrendered to Pembroke, who guaranteed his safety until 1 August. After a meeting with the king at York, Gaveston was placed in Pembroke's personal custody and taken south. On 9 June Pembroke and Gaveston reached Deddington in Oxfordshire, where Pembroke left him and a few retainers at the rector's house while he visited his wife at his manor of Bampton about 20 miles away. On the morning of 10 June the earl of Warwick seized Gaveston, took him to Warwick and, with the approval of the earl of Lancaster and other magnates, executed him nearby on 19 June.<br>
<br>This act removed any ambiguity in Pembroke's relations with the king. Pembroke probably continued to support the principles of reform as contained in the ordinances, but his support of his fellow ordainers was ended by this blow to his honour. Until the actions of the Despensers after 1318 again placed a strain upon his loyalty, Pembroke remained clearly on the king's side.<h2>
<a name="ServicetoEdwardII13121316"></a>Service to Edward II, 1312&#150;1316</h2>In August 1312 Pembroke visited Paris to enlist Philippe IV's aid in negotiating with the ordainers; on 20&#150;21 September, at great risk to his personal safety, he attempted to ensure the loyalty of the city of London to the king; and he took an active part in the negotiations which led to a peace treaty between Edward II and his opponents on 20 December 1312. In February and March 1313 he went to Paris to arrange for a personal meeting between Edward II and Philippe IV to resolve Anglo-French disputes in Aquitaine, and accompanied Edward and Isabella to Paris in June and July. He again accompanied Edward to France for a meeting with Philippe IV at Montreuil in December 1313.<br>
<br>In April 1314 Pembroke was appointed as the king's lieutenant in Scotland, in advance of the campaign to relieve Stirling which culminated in the disastrous English defeat at Bannockburn on 24 June. Pembroke was close to the king, and intervened to lead him away from the battle to safety at Dunbar and thence to Berwick.<br>
<br>On 2 January 1315 Pembroke attended Gaveston's reburial at Langley; in May and June he visited Paris on behalf of Edward II to obtain confirmation from the new French king, Louis X, of previous Anglo-French agreements; between July and October 1315 he organized the defence of the northern borders from Scottish attack. In February 1316 he deputized for the king at the opening of the Lincoln parliament, at which the earl of Lancaster was nominated as the king's chief councillor, and was a member of the committee appointed to consider reform of the realm and the royal household. In July he helped to end the resistance of Bristol to royal authority.<h2>
<a name="Captureandransom"></a>Capture and ransom</h2>In December 1316 Pembroke was appointed to lead an embassy to the newly elected pope, John XXII, to obtain support against the Scots, achieve financial concessions, and possibly to free Edward from his oath to uphold the ordinances. In early May 1317, as Pembroke was returning from Avignon, he was taken prisoner at &Eacute;tampes and taken to an unknown destination in the county of Bar on the borders between France and the empire where he was forced to agree to a ransom of &pound;10,400. His captor, Jean de Lamouilly, who came from Bar, had served in various Scottish garrisons between 1299 and 1312. Lamouilly's wages were apparently in arrears but it is also likely that Count &Eacute;douard of Bar used Pembroke's capture to punish Edward II for the treatment in England of his sister Joan, the estranged wife of the earl of Surrey. Pembroke was freed from captivity before the end of June 1317. The burden of paying his ransom and of redeeming the hostages he left behind in Bar left him with severe financial problems for the rest of his life.<h2>
<a name="Politicalmanoeuvrings13171320"></a>Political manoeuvrings, 1317&#150;1320</h2>The Avignon embassy has also traditionally, but incorrectly, been seen as the occasion on which Pembroke began the formation of a so-called &#145;middle party&#146;, designed to win control over the royal government at the expense of Thomas, earl of Lancaster. Even had he wished to do so, Pembroke's financial problems would have deprived him of the necessary freedom of action. In fact his main motivation in the critical period of English politics between 1316 and 1318 was to do whatever he could to avoid the outbreak of civil war between the king's supporters and those of the earl of Lancaster. On 1 November 1317 Pembroke contracted to serve the king for life in peace and war, while on 24 November he and Bartholomew Badlesmere made a contract with one of the current royal favourites, Roger Damory, with the intention of ensuring the latter's future good behaviour.<br>
<br>The possible dangers had been shown all too clearly on 1 October 1317, when Pembroke had barely succeeded in persuading the king not to attack Lancaster in his castle of Pontefract. Pembroke also played an important role, along with other magnates, the leading English clergy, and two papal envoys, in the tortuous negotiations which concluded in the treaty agreed between Edward II and Lancaster at Leake on 9 August 1318. Pembroke was a prominent member of the standing royal council of prelates and magnates which was established at the York parliament in October 1318. In March 1319 he sat at the chapter house of St Paul's Cathedral to hear the complaints of the citizens of London. In August 1319 Pembroke made his will (which is not extant) before taking part in September in the unsuccessful siege of Berwick; and in December he helped to negotiate a two-year truce with the Scots.<h2>
<a name="Thecivilwaranditsaftermath13201324"></a>The civil war and its aftermath, 1320&#150;1324</h2>In February 1320 Pembroke was appointed to be keeper of the realm during the king's proposed visit to France to do homage for Aquitaine, and was reappointed during June and July when the king made his delayed visit. However, real power was increasingly being exercised by the younger Hugh Despenser and his father. The death of Pembroke's wife in September, and his lack of a legitimate male heir, gave him a good excuse to go to France to arrange for a second marriage. Pembroke left England in late November 1320 and returned in late March 1321, shortly before the attack on the Despensers by Hereford and Mortimer. Pembroke again left England in late May to marry Mary de St Pol in Paris and returned to England in late July. He then played a crucial role in persuading Edward II to agree to the exile of the Despensers, after warning the king that even his loyalty might be in question if the king refused.<br>
<br>However, Pembroke was not trusted by the opponents of the Despensers, and this fact, as well as his own natural inclination, brought him back openly to the king's side in the civil war that followed. Pembroke was present at the siege of Leeds Castle in October, and in December consented to the return of the Despensers from exile. He was active in the campaign against the contrariants, and was one of the earls who judged the earl of Lancaster guilty of treason on 21 March 1322. Pembroke's reputation was however compromised by the events of 1321&#150;2. The king's enemies considered that he had betrayed them, while in May 1322 the king, under the influence of the Despensers, forced Pembroke to make a pledge of loyalty &#145;for certain reasons he was given to understand&#146;  (<span class="italic">CClR, 1318&#150;1323</span>, 563&#150;4).<br>
<br>Pembroke took part in the unsuccessful Scottish campaign in the late summer of 1322, and on 14 October was in the English army defeated by the Scots on Blackhowmoor, near Old Byland in Yorkshire. He negotiated the thirteen-year truce that was agreed with the Scots in May 1323. In June 1324 he was sent to France to settle the St Sardos dispute. He never reached Paris, dying suddenly on 23 June, probably near St Riquier in Picardy. Pembroke's body was returned to London on 31 July, and he was buried in Westminster Abbey near the high altar on 1 August. Although his death was almost certainly natural, writers hostile to him claimed that he was poisoned, and that his lack of a male heir was a divine punishment for his part in Lancaster's death, while his widow and coheirs suffered harassment in revenge for Pembroke's support of the Despensers' opponents in 1321. Long before his death Pembroke had been overtaken by events beyond his control.<br>
<br>Mary de St Pol outlived Pembroke by over fifty years, devoting herself to a life of piety; she died in England in March 1377 at the Franciscan priory of Denny near Cambridge, which she herself had founded in 1339, and where she was buried. In memory of her husband she commissioned the fine stone tomb in Westminster Abbey, and a chantry&#151;now part of the chapel of St John the Baptist; she installed a memorial window in the new church of the Greyfriars in London; and in 1347 founded Pembroke College in Cambridge. In 1363 one of the scholars of the college, Jakob Nielsen from Denmark (James Nicholas of Dacia), wrote an ingenious if rather tortuous poem in Aymer's honour.<h2>
<a name="Assessmentaconflictofloyalties"></a>Assessment: a conflict of loyalties</h2>While he possessed considerable talents as an administrator, diplomat, and military commander, in politics Pembroke was not a natural leader but was by birth and experience an upholder of tradition, whose usual inclination was to serve his royal cousins and the crown they represented to the best of his ability. Although he played a prominent and constructive part in the many crises of the reign of Edward II, his loyalty and integrity were severely tested by the influence exercised over Edward and his government by Piers Gaveston and by Hugh Despenser the younger. Had he lived beyond 1324 he would certainly have been forced to make a choice between serving Edward, transferring his allegiance to Isabella and Mortimer, or even in the last resort withdrawing to his French lands. Since England and France were then on the verge of open war, his death may also have saved him from another difficult choice between allegiances.<br>
<br>Pembroke's leading retainers included his nephew John Hastings, lord of Abergavenny and father of Laurence Hastings, Pembroke's eventual successor as earl in 1339. Another nephew, John Comyn, was the son of John Comyn of Badenoch who was killed by Robert Bruce in 1306, and was himself killed fighting Robert at Bannockburn in 1314. In 1297 Thomas Berkeley, senior, and his son Maurice made an indenture for military service with Pembroke. They, and other members of the Berkeley family, and other associates of the Berkeleys, remained as regular retainers of Pembroke until they quarrelled with him in 1317 and moved to the service of Roger Mortimer of Wigmore. One of the many ironies of Pembroke's career is that Thomas Berkeley, junior, Thomas Gurney, and John Maltravers, the custodians of the deposed Edward II at Berkeley Castle in 1327, were all former members of Pembroke's retinue. Another prominent Pembroke retainer was John Darcy, who made an indenture for life service in 1309 and served him until 1323, when he was appointed justiciar of Ireland. Darcy was later to serve as steward of the royal household from 1337 and was present at the battle of Cr&eacute;cy in 1346. Pembroke evidently inspired loyalty and affection among some at least of his retainers, since in 1323 Darcy regretted having to leave his good master and lord&#151;&#145;son bon maistre e seigneur&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SC8/239/11949).<br>
