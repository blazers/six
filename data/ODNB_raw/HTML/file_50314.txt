<span class="headword">Bolitho,  (Henry) Hector</span>  (1897&#150;1974), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born at Britannia Boarding-House, Vincent Street, Auckland, New Zealand, on 28 May 1897, the elder of the two sons (there were no daughters) of Henry Bolitho (1868&#150;1945), hairdresser, born in Ballarat, whose father emigrated from Cornwall to Australia during the gold rush, and his wife, Etheldred Frances Bushe (1875&#150;1958), the daughter of a New Zealand schoolmaster, Michael Francis (Frank) Bushe.<br>
<br>Hector Bolitho often told friends he believed himself to be of partly Maori descent. He wrote that his maternal grandmother Catherine Bushe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bregman, &#145;had been under fire when the Maoris stormed the Waiuku stockade and, in some earlier battle, she had seen the head of a white man impaled on a native spear&#146;. Later she became an interpreter between the English and native leaders. She spoke their language perfectly and translated the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> into Maori.<br>
<br>In 1898 Bolitho's father designed and printed the world's first airmail stamps, for a pigeon-carrier letter service operating between Auckland and the Great Barrier Island. As a sensitive boy of ten, on his great-uncle's farm at Waiau Pa, Hector Bolitho was horrified by the sight of a shepherd castrating lambs with his teeth. His autocratic Methodist mother wanted him to become a doctor, but at Seddon Memorial College, Auckland, his teacher, Ronald Algie, later New Zealand's minister of education, inspired in him a love of English literature. Without his parents' permission, he left school at fifteen to join the staff of the <span class="italic">New Zealand Herald</span>, moving in 1915 to the <span class="italic">Auckland Star</span> as shipping reporter. In 1916 he became a corporal in the New Zealand army, in which he served for the last two years of the First World War. When the war ended, he went to stay on a small island in Auckland's outer harbour which became the subject of his first book, <span class="italic">The Island of Kawau</span> (1919), which he sold to a New Zealand publisher for &pound;20. With the proceeds, he sailed to the south seas, where he wrote a book about Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga, <span class="italic">The Islands of Wonder</span> (1920), for which he received &pound;30. In April 1920 the prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, arrived in New Zealand on an official visit. Bolitho was invited to travel on the royal train to report the tour. This provided material for a third book, <span class="italic">With the Prince in New Zealand</span> (1920).<br>
<br>Homosexual, but obliged to conceal his true nature, Bolitho was never at ease in the then homophobic atmosphere of New Zealand society. In May 1920 his boyhood mentor Charles Ewing Mackay (1875&#150;1929), mayor of Wanganui, was arrested and imprisoned for seriously wounding a man to whom he had made homosexual advances. Shaken by this scandal, in 1921 Bolitho left New Zealand for Australia, where he became editor of the <span class="italic">Shakespearean Quarterly</span> and literary editor and drama critic of the Sydney <span class="italic">Evening News</span>.<br>
<br>In 1923 Bolitho arrived in London, where he began work as a freelance journalist, writing articles for <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, and the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>. In 1925 he went to Johannesburg to edit the <span class="italic">South African Pictorial</span>, but resigned after only seven months because of his refusal to accept South African racialism. After his return to England, he published two novels, <span class="italic">Solemn Boy</span> (1927) and <span class="italic">Judith Silver</span> (1929), both with manifestly autobiographical New Zealand backgrounds. His prose style was graceful, but neither book was commercially successful. With his third novel, <span class="italic">The Flame on Ethirdova</span> (1930), Bolitho &#145;went through the strange and unprofitable sensation of being &#147;remaindered&#148;&#146;.<br>
<br>Already in 1926, however, the course of Bolitho's career had been decisively influenced when the dean of Windsor, Albert Victor Baillie, invited him to go to live in the cloisters of Windsor Castle, where he remained for eight years, helping the dean to edit two volumes of <span class="italic">Letters of Lady Augusta Stanley</span> (1927&#150;9), Queen Victoria's lady-in-waiting. Bolitho was almost expelled from Windsor by George V for contracting German measles while the royal family was in residence.<br>
<br>Bolitho's unrestricted access to the Royal Archives, and his discovery, in Coburg, of unpublished letters written by Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria, led to his first international bestseller, <span class="italic">Albert the Good</span> (1932), widely regarded as the most important royal biography since (Giles) Lytton Strachey's <span class="italic">Queen Victoria</span>.<br>
<br>In 1934 Bolitho worked with Terence Rattigan on the play <span class="italic">Grey Farm</span>, but their collaboration ended in acrimony, and when it was staged in New York six years later, the play ran for only thirty-five performances. Bolitho's volume of sinister supernatural short stories, <span class="italic">The House in Half Moon Street</span> (1935), showed vivid stylistic flair. In 1936 he was chosen as the official biographer of Rudyard Kipling, but found the conditions imposed by Kipling's daughter unacceptable. Instead he wrote <span class="italic">King Edward VIII: his Life and Reign</span> (1937). Published three months after the abdication, it was severely critical of the former monarch and provoked scathing condemnation of the author by Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill and (Edward Montague) Compton Mackenzie.<br>
<br>In 1938 the British Broadcasting Corporation produced Bolitho's radio play <span class="italic">Victoria and Disraeli</span>, with the role of the queen-empress played by the celebrated actress Marie Tempest, whose tyrannical character Bolitho had amusingly portrayed in an unintentionally revealing biography, <span class="italic">Marie Tempest</span> (1936). Bolitho made a major contribution to historical scholarship as the editor of <span class="italic">Further Letters of Queen Victoria</span> (1938).<br>
<br>Bolitho became a life fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1937, and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1940. On the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as an intelligence officer with the rank of squadron leader, editing the <span class="italic">Royal Air Force Weekly Bulletin</span>, which in 1941 became the <span class="italic">Royal Air Force Journal</span>. In 1942 he was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Coastal Command Intelligence Review</span>.<br>
<br>In 1946 Bolitho wrote a second anthology of short stories, <span class="italic">No Humour in my Love</span>. His deep, resonant voice and commanding presence launched him on a highly successful tour of the United States in 1947, during which he delivered more than 130 lectures.<br>
<br>In 1949 Bolitho began the most important relationship of his life when he met a former public schoolboy and army officer, Captain Derek Wilmot Douglas Peel, born on 25 February 1924, who had been educated at Wellington College and wounded while serving in no. 9 commando. They collaborated on a book, <span class="italic">Without the City Wall</span> (1952), and lived together for the rest of Bolitho's life.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Jinnah, Creator of Pakistan</span> (1954), Bolitho's biography of Mohamed Ali Jinnah, provoked intense controversy in Pakistan over the propriety of the book's being written by a non-Muslim. Bolitho almost abandoned the project, but persevered. On publication the biography received international acclaim.<br>
<br>At the age of sixty-five Bolitho made an avuncular chairman to a panel of teenagers in the television series, <span class="italic">The Young Elizabethans</span> (1962), but was not at ease in the medium. He raised substantial sums of money for polio research as chairman of the Committee for Writing and Reading Aids for the Paralysed. His autobiography, <span class="italic">My Restless Years</span> (1962), revealed a not entirely happy personality. In 1963 he wrote to a friend:<blockquote>I am weary, weary, weary. Weary of the written word. I would not write another if it weren't that I like my good food and must pay for it. Like my escapes on long voyages, and must pay for them.</blockquote>In 1964 Bolitho's biography of Prince Albert was revised and reissued as <span class="italic">Albert, Prince Consort</span>, with interesting comparisons with the role, as consort, of Prince Philip, duke of Edinburgh. A member of the Athenaeum, Bolitho liked to sit in its drawing-room, looking at Charles Meryon's etchings of his native New Zealand. Though sixteen of his fifty-nine books were devoted to the subject of monarchy, Bolitho always considered himself &#145;left wing&#146; and a rebel at heart. He enjoyed debunking his somewhat portentous public image. In private, his favourite pastime was playing &#145;Home Sweet Home&#146; on the piano with his nose.<br>
<br>In 1965 Bolitho suffered the first of several strokes. His last book, <span class="italic">The Drummonds of Charing Cross</span> (1967), was completed in collaboration with Derek Peel, who did most of the research and writing. Through the onset of arteriosclerosis, Bolitho's health rapidly declined, and Peel wrote all the articles and book reviews that appeared under Bolitho's name in the <span class="italic">Washington Star</span> and other publications during the last years of his life. Hector Bolitho died on 12 September 1974 at Lee House Nursing Home, 61 Dyke Road, Brighton, the town in which he and Peel had lived since 1956. He was cremated on 18 September at Downs crematorium, Bear Road, Brighton, at a private service attended only by Derek Peel and their housekeeper. After Bolitho's death, Derek Peel succumbed to alcoholism and was found dead on 28 April 1979.<br>
