<span class="headword">Dawkins,  James</span>  (1722&#150;1757), <span class="occ">antiquary and Jacobite sympathizer</span>, was born in Jamaica, the eldest of four sons of Henry Dawkins (1698&#150;1744) of Clarendon, Jamaica, a wealthy sugar planter, and his wife, Elizabeth (1697?&#150;1757), third daughter of Edward Pennant of Clarendon, chief justice of the island, and his wife, Elizabeth. Educated at Abingdon School in Berkshire under the tory Thomas Woods, Dawkins matriculated at St John's College, Oxford, on 7 December 1739 and graduated DCL in 1749.<br>
<br>After university Dawkins travelled extensively on the continent, moving in Jacobite circles in Paris and Rome. It was in Rome in 1749 that he planned an expedition with an Oxford friend, John Bouverie, around the eastern Mediterranean to the sites of classical antiquity. Robert Wood, seasoned traveller and classical scholar, and Giovanni Borra, an architectural draughtsman, were invited to join them. The party sailed from Naples on 5 May 1750 in a specially equipped ship, the <i>Matilda</i>, and during the summer and autumn toured the Aegean and the coast of Asia Minor. Bouverie died at Guzel Hissar on 19 September. The party were in Egypt in November and spent Christmas in Nazareth. In March 1751 they were in Syria, where they visited the ruins of Palmyra and Baalbek (ancient Heliopolis). They arrived on the Greek mainland in May, by way of Tripoli and Cyprus, and embarked for Naples on 7 June 1751.<br>
<br>This was among the first expeditions of its type&#151;a serious journey of archaeological exploration, quite unlike the military, diplomatic, or trading missions which had previously provided the West with accounts of the Levant. &#145;The combination of wealth, classical scholarship, artistic and architectural talent in this party was truly remarkable&#146;  (Harris and Savage); according to Dawkins's nephew, the trip &#145;cost him no less a sum than &pound;50,000&#146;  (J. T. Smith, <span class="italic">Nollekens and his Times</span>, 1829, 338), much of it supplied by Dawkins himself, but the expedition's journal shows that he was also an active and dynamic organizer, an accomplished scholar, an observant naturalist, and, perhaps above all, a passionate and apparently tireless measurer and recorder of everything that he saw.<br>
<br>Robert Wood, aided and financially supported by Dawkins, published <span class="italic">The Ruins of Palmyra</span> (1753) and <span class="italic">The Ruins of Baalbec</span> (1757), containing detailed engravings of architectural remains previously almost unknown in western Europe. Their effect on classical taste in England and France, based until then on Vitruvian models, was immediate and explosive, scoring &#145;a triumph such as no architectural books had ever before achieved&#146;  (Harris and Savage). Dawkins's generosity also provided financial support for James Stuart and Nicholas Revett in their similar and ultimately more significant enterprise, <span class="italic">The Antiquities of Athens</span> (1762). In 1755 Dawkins, proposed by Stuart, was elected to the Society of Dilettanti. A collection of manuscripts in the Bodleian Library and of marbles in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford are the products of his travels.<br>
<br>Dawkins's early contacts with Jacobitism appear to have prompted his journey to Berlin in May 1753 to meet Frederick the Great. This was an attempt to get Prussian support for a Jacobite conspiracy involving William King of Oxford, the earl of Westmorland, and the Earl Marischal, Prussian ambassador in Paris. The meeting was inconclusive, but resulted in the British government issuing a warrant for Dawkins's arrest. This was not executed when, in the following year, 1754, Dawkins returned to England, bought an estate at Laverstoke, Hampshire, and was returned as MP for the open borough of Hindon, Wiltshire, which he held until his death. Dawkins is said to have made highly critical comments about the Pretender (James Stuart) in 1756, yet some contemporaries believed he died a Jacobite.<br>
<br>Dawkins is now thought to be the author of an anonymous 1756 pamphlet, <span class="italic">Reflections physical and moral upon the &hellip; numerous phenomena &hellip; which have happened from the earthquake at Lima</span>. This reveals him to have been a fierce opponent of the philosophy of Descartes and Newton. In addition to his Hampshire estate Dawkins owned 25,000 acres (1754) in Jamaica with his brother. It was here, Sutton's Plantation, that Dawkins died, unmarried, on 6 September 1757. He was buried at Old Plantation, Clarendon. In 1922, when the family estates were sold, his remains, together with those of his parents, were reinterred in St Paul's Church, Chapelton, Jamaica.<br>
