<span class="headword">Viner,  Charles</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1678, <em>d.</em> 1756), <span class="occ">legal writer and university benefactor</span>, was born in Salisbury and baptized there at St Mary's Church, on 3 November 1678, the son of Charles Viner (<i>fl</i>. 1660&#150;1711) and his wife, Mary. His father was a prosperous draper, and perhaps a kinsman of Sir Robert Vyner, goldsmith and lord mayor of London. He matriculated at Hart Hall, Oxford, in 1695, but left without taking a degree. In 1699 he married the fifteen-year-old Ralegh Weekes (1684&#150;1761) of Gloucester, a descendant of Sir Walter Ralegh. They lived together at Aldershot, Hampshire, until Viner's death.<br>
<br>Viner entered the Middle Temple in 1700, and although he was never called to the bar he kept chambers in King's Bench Walk, Temple, from where he gave occasional legal advice. His real interest, however, was more in the literature of the law than in its practice. He began to collect notes of recently decided cases in 1703, but devoted the greater part of his life to the exhaustive arrangement of existing legal materials under alphabetical headings, based on the works of his predecessors Robert Brooke and Henry Rolle. His <span class="italic">General abridgment of law and equity: alphabetically digested under proper titles, with notes and references to the whole</span> was published in 23 volumes between 1742 and 1757 (the final volume posthumously). This was printed, reputedly under Viner's direction at his own home, on paper watermarked with his monogram, published by him personally, and the earlier volumes sold from his chambers in the Temple. Though unwieldy to use, it was the most comprehensive attempt to render accessible the legal materials printed before his time, and it remains an invaluable key to these works. An <span class="italic">Alphabetical Index</span> to the work was published by Robert Kelham in 1758, and incorporated into the second edition of the <span class="italic">Abridgment</span> (1791&#150;4).<br>
<br>From the early 1740s Viner had it in mind to leave his estate to support the study of the common law in the University of Oxford, and he was encouraged in this by the university. He died at Aldershot on 5 June 1756; on his death Oxford received almost the whole of his estate, valued at &pound;12,000, to endow a professorship of the common law&#151;whose first holder was Sir William Blackstone&#151;together with fellowships and scholarships. The Vinerian foundation formed the bedrock of common law studies at Oxford. Viner's correspondence reveals him as an irritable, at times exasperating, man, with a marked antipathy towards lawyers, booksellers, and printers. He was the most generous academic benefactor of the University of Oxford in the eighteenth century.<br>
