<span class="headword">Barber <span class="st"> [Barbar]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1545, <em>d.</em> after 1603), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, hailed from Middlesex. Born to unknown parents, he matriculated as a pensioner of St John's College, Cambridge, on 8 November 1560, graduated BA in 1564, and was elected a fellow on 11 April 1565. Ordained deacon at Ely on 29 July 1565, he proceeded MA in 1567 and was one of the many who petitioned for Thomas Cartwright's restoration as Lady Margaret professor in 1570. He had moved to London by August 1574, for he was certainly the &#145;Barber&#146; listed as curate of St Sepulchre during Edwin Sandys's episcopal visitation that month. In October 1575 he was presented to the vicarage of Stoke Newington, Middlesex, by John Dudley, esquire, a kinsman of the earl of Leicester. In a survey drawn up in December 1576 by Thomas Watts, archdeacon of Middlesex, Barber was described as resident, married, an MA learned in Latin and the scriptures, but licensed to preach only in St Sepulchre.<br>
<br>Some time after reaching the capital Barber joined the London clerical conference established in 1570 by John Field and Thomas Wilcox in the hope that further reform of the 1559 settlement, possibly along fully presbyterian lines, could be introduced by parliamentary means. Barber was consistently involved with its proceedings until its demise in 1590.<br>
<br>It was an impossible dream, but meanwhile Barber soldiered on in London on behalf of the reformist cause. On 11 April 1576 the vestry of St Helen, Bishopsgate, appointed him their evening lecturer on Wednesdays and Fridays at an annual salary of 20 marks. Although he had yet to be troubled for nonconformity, he relinquished the post in 1578, and had resigned Stoke Newington by July 1580.<br>
<br>Barber seems to have spent the rest of his life in the parish of St Botolph without Bishopsgate. A daughter, Dorcas, was baptized there on 10 January 1580, and six other children followed: Thomas (1582), Nehemia (1584), Rachel (1587), Prudence (1589), Bartholomew (1591), and Martha (1593). Identification is proven by the fact that in the 1591 entry Barber is described as &#145;preacher&#146;.<br>
<br>By 1584, when he was lecturing both at St Mary Woolchurch and St Mary-le-Bow, Barber had become one of the London clergy whom John Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury, was disposed to silence. Whitgift finally suspended him in June for his refusal to subscribe the three articles which he had introduced in November 1583 as his yardstick of conformity. Barber was nevertheless chosen as a member of the &#145;national synod&#146; which Field convened to lobby sympathetic MPs during the parliament of 1584&#150;5. After petitions on his behalf Whitgift offered to restore him in December 1587, but Barber still refused to satisfy the archbishop as to his future conformity. He never preached officially in London again.<br>
<br>Barber was one of those at whose activities a ban on unlicensed preachers in March 1589 was specifically aimed, and he was closely involved in the death throes of the conference movement. A delegate to the &#145;presbytery&#146; at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1590 (as it was described by its opponents in the college, though defended as a routine clerical conference by those who attended it), he was also a member of the last general conference in London the same year. In September 1591 he was one of the nonconformist leaders who was interrogated in Star Chamber about the clandestine activities of the previous twenty years, and it is largely as a result of his evidence, and that of Thomas Edmunds, that so much is known about them. While Barber's part in unmasking his colleagues presumably distanced him from some of them, he was evidently not rejected by the godly community at large. The will of the London draper Thomas Eaton, in December 1599, mentions his &#145;good friends Thomas Barber and Stephen Egerton&#146;, who each received &pound;20.<br>
<br>Barber is credited with <span class="italic">The Apocalypse or Revelation of St John, with a Methodicall Exposition upon every Chapter</span> (1596), a translation from the French of Fran&ccedil;ois du Jon's recent work. No copy of his <span class="italic">Dialogue between the Penitent Sinner and Sathan</span>, mentioned by older authorities, is known to survive. His wife, Prudence, was buried at St Botolph on 15 December 1595. Barber remarried, for a daughter, Mary, was baptized at St Botolph in 1604. There are no further references to him or his family in the London records, and he seems to have died intestate.<br>
