<span class="headword">Finglas,  Patrick</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1537), <span class="occ">judge</span>, derived his patronymic from Finglas in north co. Dublin. In 1503 he entered Lincoln's Inn where, in 1506, he served as Christmas steward. On 20 January 1508 he was appointed the king's serjeant-at-law, and in 1509 he was styled as of Piercetown, Meath. In June 1516 he was promoted to the position of second justice of common pleas and he continued to hold this office until 1520 when he was appointed chief baron of the exchequer by the earl of Surrey. In that year he was commended to Henry VIII for his service by both Surrey and Sir John Stiles, and was dispatched to the court to arrange for a meeting of the Irish parliament. In 1524 he received a new patent as chief baron of the exchequer. He served as a justice of the assize in 1527.<br>
<br>Finglas first established contact with the king's secretary, Thomas Cromwell, in 1533. Following the death of Sir Bartholomew Dillon in 1533, Cromwell unsuccessfully endeavoured to have Finglas immediately appointed to replace Dillon as chief justice of the king's bench. The prospect of Finglas's promotion aroused the earl of Kildare's animosity on the grounds of Finglas's alleged attachment to the Butler faction. In spite of Kildare's protest, on 8 May 1534 Finglas was appointed to this office, being replaced as chief baron of the exchequer by Gerald Aylmer. Finglas was at court in May 1534 and in the second half of the month he and Thomas Cusack were dispatched to Ireland with instructions for the Irish council. Finglas retained his office as chief justice until 1535 when he was reappointed chief baron of the exchequer for life, with a salary of 40 pounds silver, and in 1537 he was paid an annual salary of &pound;100. He attended meetings of the Irish council until mid-July 1537 and he died that year, in early August.<br>
<br>In an undated treatise, thought to have been written in the summer of 1534, and entitled &#145;A breviat of the getting of Ireland, and of the decaie of the same&#146;, Finglas presented a set of proposals for the political reformation of Ireland  (LPL, MS 600, fol. 204, MS 621, fol. 92; TCD, MS 842, fols. 25&#150;36). He provided a skeletal outline of the history of English conquest in Ireland, the upshot of which was &#145;a general decay&#146; in the lordship. He specifically advocated reform of the province of Leinster, which could be effected through colonization of the pale maghery, and also suggested that abbeys in outlying areas should be entrusted to English lords and gentlemen. In addition he recommended that English captains be appointed to garrison strategic castles in border districts west of the pale.<br>
<br>No details of Finglas's marriage are known, but he had a son, Thomas, who was appointed protonotary and chirographer of common pleas in 1534.<br>
