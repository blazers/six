<span class="headword">Coleridge,  Herbert</span>  (1830&#150;1861), <span class="occ">philologist</span>, was born at Hampstead, Middlesex, on 7 October 1830, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5882/', "Henry Nelson Coleridge (1798&#150;1843)")</script> and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5889/', "Sara Coleridge (1802&#150;1852)")</script>. Having been educated at Eton College by his uncle, the Revd Edward Coleridge, he obtained the Newcastle medal and the Balliol scholarship in 1847, and in 1848 was declared Newcastle scholar. While at school he acquired an interest in Icelandic. His university career at Oxford, which began in 1848, led in 1852 to a double first-class in classics and mathematics, which gave &#145;high hopes of future eminence&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 706).<br>
<br>On 31 March 1853 Coleridge married Ellen Persehouse, daughter of T. M. Phillips, and on 17 November 1854 he was called to the bar, and began practising as a chancery barrister at his chambers in Lincoln's Inn, specializing in conveyancing. As his private means were adequate to his needs he was free to devote his leisure hours to philology&#151;Sanskrit, the northern tongues, and particularly the language and literature of Iceland. In February 1857 he was elected a member of the Philological Society (founded in 1842), and contributed two papers on diminutives in &#145;let&#146; and the Latin words &#145;ploro&#146; and &#145;exploro&#146;, which were read at their March and May meetings. The society was then engaged, following a paper by Chenevix Trench, &#145;On the deficiencies in our English dictionaries&#146;, on a proposal for supplementing the two standard dictionaries of Johnson and Richardson, but in late 1857 Trench made proposals for a complete new English dictionary. Coleridge threw himself into this project with his characteristic enthusiasm, became its chief workman, and was appointed honorary secretary of a special committee &#145;formed for the purpose of collecting words and idioms hitherto unregistered&#146;, a post for which he was well fitted by his learning, literary facility, and methodical habits. His new duties, amounting to a general editorship of the work, involved a large correspondence with the numerous volunteer helpers. The results of his researches are embodied in his <span class="italic">Glossarial Index to the Printed English Literature of the Thirteenth Century</span> (1859), which he describes as &#145;the foundation-stone&#146; of the proposed English dictionary. The scheme developed into the momentous <span class="italic">New English Dictionary</span> (later the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span>).<br>
<br>Coleridge's efforts were necessarily relaxed, though never entirely relinquished, in consequence of a decline in health, which ended in consumption. He had a bad haemorrhage in 1858 yet, in spite of increasing weakness, he continued to write papers on various philological topics, as well as reports of the progress of work; and during the last fortnight of his life, while confined to bed, he still sometimes dictated notes for the dictionary. An essay on King Arthur was printed by the Philological Society after his death, which took place on 23 April 1861 at his home, 10 Chester Place, Regent's Park, London.<br>
