<span class="headword">Benson,  Margaret</span>  (1865&#150;1916), <span class="occ">Egyptologist and religious philosopher</span>, was born on 16 June 1865 at Wellington College, Berkshire, the fourth of the six children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2139/', "Edward White Benson (1829&#150;1896)")</script>, archbishop of Canterbury (1882&#150;96), and his wife, Mary (1841&#150;1918), daughter of the Revd William Sidgwick, of Skipton, Yorkshire, and sister of the philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25517/', "Henry Sidgwick")</script>. Margaret's academic, if not her literary achievements, exceeded those of her more famous brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30712/', "Arthur Christopher Benson")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30713/', "Edward Frederic Benson")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30718/', "Robert Hugh Benson")</script>. Her mother was notable as a &#145;spiritual counsellor&#146; to younger women, and tended to romantic involvements with them. Her sister was the social worker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56097/', "Mary Eleanor Benson")</script>.<br>
<br>Benson was educated at Truro Girls' High School from its founding in 1879 to July 1883. That October she entered Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she read philosophy and political economy. She was extremely happy there. Her drawings, as well as her youth, delighted John Ruskin. Her supervisor, G. W. Gent, later described her intelligence as &#145;remorseless&#146;, observing that he had looked for, but could not discern, the &#145;feminine difference&#146;. In June 1886, in the women's examination, she tied for first place in England; after which she went to live at home, to help with dinner parties at Lambeth Palace. Here she met&#151;and quarrelled with&#151;some formidable contemporaries, including the composer Ethel Smyth. She produced two books during this time: <span class="italic">Capital, Labour, Trade and the Outlook</span> (1891) and a ladylike piece of anthropomorphism about her pets (1895).<br>
<br>In 1895, thwarted, restless, and increasingly frustrated by chronic low-grade illness, Benson found an outlet in Egyptology. She obtained permission to excavate the Temple of Mut, situated between Karnak and Luxor. With a companion, Janet Gourlay, she spent the winters of 1895 and 1896 there. In 1897 she wrote for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, discussing contemporary books on Egypt and describing her own excavation. By 1899 she and Janet Gourlay had produced a fine account of the latter, <span class="italic">The Temple of Mut in Asher</span>. In 1900 the archaeologist P. E. Newberry, who admired her crisp prose, asked her if she would collaborate on his monumental history of Egypt. She declined: it would be, she explained, a &#145;free choice&#146; not a call &#145;by God&#146;. Instead, between 1900 and 1904, she produced a witty and hostile polemic against Christian Science, opposed the rationalism of Robert Blatchford in <span class="italic">The Clarion</span>, a socialist weekly paper, edited a number of her father's works, and helped her brother to write their father's biography.<br>
<br>Margaret Benson involved herself in theology, particularly as it bore on the field of women's higher education. From 1902 to 1904 she was on the council of Lady Margaret Hall. In 1904 she organized the St Paul's Biblical Association as part of the Oxford and Cambridge vacation terms scheme. The association became a forum at which women met to give and discuss papers, and to hear leading theologians. This grew into the archbishop's diploma in theology, which still exists. In 1904 she used the association to set up an ambitious lecture series in biblical study from the women's branch of King's College at Kensington. The courses met a real need, finding 292 subscribers in their first year.<br>
<br>Benson's theological concerns dovetailed with her work on Hegel. She spent fifteen years writing a book, aimed at &#145;the average man&#146;, which used philosophical discursive tools to argue that it was reasonable to postulate the existence of a merciful God. The result, called <span class="italic">The Venture of Rational Faith</span>, appeared in 1908, a year after a mental breakdown, with attendant loss of faith, caused her to be confined, first in an asylum at St George's Convent, Wivelsfield, Sussex, and from November 1907 to 1912 at The Priory, Roehampton, Surrey. She suffered severe depression with occasional delusions, though generally remained quite lucid. From late 1912 she lived quietly under supervision in a private house, The Rowans, 27 Lingfield Road, Wimbledon. In 1913 she produced an extraordinary collection of semi-autobiographical prose-poems, <span class="italic">The Court of the King</span>, many of which have Egyptian settings. She died at The Rowans on 13 May 1916, and was buried on 16 May at Addington Park, Croydon. She never married.<br>
<br>Margaret Benson was fiercely handsome, with heavy-lidded eyes, whose shadows became very pronounced in later life. Absolute in temperament, she had a strong, lucid intelligence, and great thwarted organizational ability. She attempted a self-immolatory patience for which she was unsuited, and was arguably the casualty of her attempts at self-suppression.<br>
