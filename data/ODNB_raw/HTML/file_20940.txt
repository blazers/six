<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ottley, Sir  Francis</span>  (1600/01&#150;1649), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Ottley of Pitchford, Shropshire, and Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10652/', "Roger Gifford (d. 1597)")</script>, physician. He entered Shrewsbury School at the age of ten, matriculated from Lincoln College, Oxford, on 4 December 1618 aged seventeen (but took no degree), and in November 1619 entered the Inner Temple as a student. In 1621 he married Lucy, widow of Thomas Pope and daughter of Thomas Edwards, sheriff of Shropshire (1621).<br>
<br>Ottley was active in local affairs, and on the outbreak of the civil war became one of the leading royalists in Shropshire. He was a signatory of the loyal declaration of the grand jury sitting at the assizes at Shrewsbury on 8 August 1642 and was in touch with Sir Edward Hyde. On 10 September, the king wrote from Nottingham authorizing him to raise a force of 200 foot and to secure Shrewsbury for the royal interest; a few days later he was appointed captain of the troop. Ottley was knighted at Shrewsbury on 21 September 1642. He lobbied hard for the governorship of the town, and showed his loyalty on 2 January 1643 by issuing an order compelling the inhabitants to sign a declaration against parliament. But three days later, Hyde wrote that though the king had &#145;a very just sense of your merit&#146;, he:<blockquote>hath had of late ill luck in making governors of cities and towns: and though he hath always chosen loved and popular men for those places; yet private differences have so far grown, that he hath been in danger of losing the corporation. However, he resolves there shall be no other governor but you &hellip; (Owen and Blakeway, 1.432)</blockquote>Ottley was confirmed in the position before the end of the month.<br>
<br>On Ottley's initiative the manufacture of muskets commenced in the town, but he seems to have had a difficult time. In July local inhabitants were found to be plotting to betray Shrewsbury to the enemy. Ottley received a letter from Oxford informing him that:<blockquote>There is a complaint here, that your press is idle, and doth the king no service; that the Parliament diurnals and pamphlets are in every body's hands, but no country work on the king's side to antidote their poison. If it shall please you to have an eye on the press, and to see our diurnals reprinted there, you wuld do the king and his cause good service, and Secretary Nichols shall thank you. (Owen and Blakeway, 1.437&#150;8)</blockquote>On 25 January 1644 Prince Rupert wrote to Ottley criticizing his failure to place the suspected traitors on trial &#145;so that the punishment may go to some, the example and terror to all&#146;  (Webb, 381); he himself was planning to make the town his headquarters, and demanded immediate arrangements be made for the secure housing of troops and military equipment. Rupert was convinced that Ottley was loath to court unpopularity with parliamentarian sympathizers in Shrewsbury. Late in 1644 he was removed from his position of governor, succeeded by Sir Michael Ernley, and was named instead as sheriff (though the parliamentarians claimed legitimacy for their own appointment, Thomas Mytton).<br>
<br>Ottley was not in Shrewsbury when it was surprised on 22 February 1645 because he had been captured the previous day, at a meeting with other commissioners of array at Apley, home of Sir William Whitmore, near Bridgnorth. He was one of four signatories of the articles of capitulation at the surrender of Bridgnorth Castle on 26 April 1646. By the terms of surrender, the occupants (who included Lady Ottley and her children) were allowed to return to their homes with horses and arms, but were then to choose between exile and peace. Ottley chose peace. On 16 June 1646 he petitioned to compound for delinquency, and on 25 June 1649 the fine was fixed at &pound;1200. Ottley died in London a few weeks later, on 11 September 1649. He had carefully preserved the papers generated by his role in the civil war, and they are of great value in understanding the course of events in Shropshire and the neighbouring counties. His widow was granted administration of his estates. Their eldest son, Richard Ottley (1626&#150;1670), who had been a captain in the royalist army, was knighted on 21 June 1660, was a gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles II, and sat as MP for Shropshire from 1661 until his death on 10 August 1670.<br>
