<span class="headword">Catherwood,  Frederick</span>  (1799&#150;1854), <span class="occ">architect and traveller</span>, was born in Charles Square, Hoxton, London, on 27 February 1799, the son of John James Catherwood (1752&#150;1829), receiver of corn returns (<i>c</i>.1779&#150;1813) and partner with Henry Caslon from 1814 to 1821 in the Caslon type founding firm in Chiswell Street. His mother was Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rowe. He received an education in the classics at Haberdashers' School in Hoxton, and during this period developed an interest in architecture. In 1815 he began a five-year apprenticeship with the architect Michael Meredith. In 1820, encouraged by Joseph Severn, a friend of Keats, he took free classes at the Royal Academy, where he came under the influence of Sir John Soane and discovered Piranesi's sketches of Roman monuments. These two figures, along with J. M. W. Turner, who taught at the Royal Academy during this period, profoundly shaped Catherwood's aesthetic vision over the next few decades as he mastered both the faithful recording of monuments and the evocation of the affective experience of viewing them.<br>
<br>In September 1821 Catherwood travelled to Rome, where he joined Severn and a large group of English artists known as the Society of Englishmen, including Joseph Bonomi, Thomas Leverton Donaldson, and Henry Parke. He threw himself into the study of Roman art and architecture, &#145;lay[ing] a foundation that may direct nobly all through life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Severn: Letters and Memoirs</span>, 168). If Catherwood's head, as Severn wrote, was &#145;full of Rome&#146;  (ibid., 169), his heart, for a time at least, lay with Lady Westmorland, Jane Fane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Huck Saunders (1779/80&#150;1857), who lived apart from her husband, John Fane, the tenth earl of Westmorland, and was known for her generosity to artists. Severn's principal patron during his early years in Rome, she had invited him to accompany her to Egypt, but Severn instead suggested his friend Catherwood. Within four months of arriving in Rome, Catherwood had taken up residence at Lady Westmorland's Villa Negroni.<br>
<br>The brief affair having ended, Catherwood continued his artistic apprenticeship, sketching ruins in Sicily, where he painted <span class="italic">Mt. Etna from the Ruins of Tauramina</span>, and then Athens, where he travelled in 1822 and remained, amid the Greek revolt against the Turks, until 1823. Accompanied by his friends Parke and Joseph Scoles, and dressed in Arab garb, Catherwood ventured to Egypt, exploring yet another distant civilization and its monuments.<br>
<br>Catherwood returned to London with the intention of beginning a career as a commercial architect. Over the next few years he designed buildings and exhibited drawings of Egyptian ruins at the Royal Academy. In 1828 the antiquarian Robert Hay, whom he had met in Egypt, invited him to join a team of artists and architects&#151;including Edward William Lane, Sir Gardner Wilkinson, and Bonomi&#151;to survey and map ancient sites in the Nile valley, a grand project modelled in scope and ambition on Napoleon's <span class="italic">Description de l'Egypte</span>. Catherwood employed his talents as an architectural draughtsman to map and survey such sites as Giza, al-Amarna, Saqqara, Abydos, and Thebes; he erected scaffolding to produce scale drawings of the towering statues of Amenhotep III, each some eighteen metres high. He also wrote the only known account of the monument at Dugga, which was destroyed not long after his visit. Catherwood's article was published years later (1845) in the <span class="italic">Annals</span> of the American Ethnological Society, of which he was a founding member.<br>
<br>In 1833 Catherwood left the Hay expedition and continued his exploration of the Middle East, travelling with Bonomi and Francis Arundale, who published an account of the journey. He employed a camera lucida, a device invented in 1807 that enabled artists to represent the outlines of distant objects, generating by this means highly detailed renderings of Baalbek and sites around Jerusalem, both of which Robert Burford later employed as the basis for his large-scale panoramas, a wildly popular form of mass entertainment. Both he and Bonomi donned Middle Eastern disguises to enter and survey the Dome of the Rock  (Von Hagen, 34&#150;5), one of the holiest sites in Islam, and both claimed credit for the detailed drawings that appeared in James Fergusson's <span class="italic">Essay on the Ancient Topography of Jerusalem</span> (1847).<br>
<br>In 1834 Catherwood married Gertrude (1813/14&#150;1870), the daughter of Peter Abbott, British consul at Beirut, in a ceremony conducted at the consul's residence in Beirut and officiated over by an American missionary clergyman. They were to have three children, Frederick Abbott, Elizabeth, and Ann. After a brief honeymoon he returned with his new bride to London and attempted, unsuccessfully, to sell his Jerusalem sketches. In 1836 he met the American traveller John Lloyd Stephens, who was attending Burford's panorama of Jerusalem. Stephens had already explored Greece, Turkey, and eastern Europe and had travelled in Catherwood's footsteps in the Middle East. At Stephens' prompting Catherwood moved to New York, arriving in June with his first-born son and his pregnant wife and establishing an architectural practice, first as sole proprietor and later in partnership with Frederick Diaper, another English architect. Among other projects he built the Rotunda, a round theatre for displaying panoramas modelled after the one in Leicester Square. Here he displayed his panoramas of Jerusalem, Thebes, and Baalbek, as well as one of Niagara Falls, which increased the popularity of the panorama form in the United States.<br>
<br>Stephens and Catherwood developed plans to bring their travel and architectural expertise to bear on American antiquities. Rumours of cities lost in the Central American jungles had circulated since the 1820s, when the Spanish colonies won their independence and non-Hispanic European travellers visited the region in increasing numbers. A few tantalizing but incomplete accounts had been published. In September 1839 Catherwood signed a contract with Stephens to illustrate the ruins, with Stephens supplying the written narrative; that same month he sent his two children and his wife, pregnant with their third child, back to London to live in Charles Square while he carried out his explorations.<br>
<br>The next few years brought Catherwood fame but also personal difficulties. Having arrived in British Honduras in October 1839, he and Stephens at once set out for the ancient Mayan city of Copan, which lay in a remote valley near independent Honduras's northern boundary with Guatemala. They arrived in November and commenced the first large-scale survey of Mayan ruins, visiting such other Mayan sites as Quirigua in Guatemala and Palenque in southern Mexico. Catherwood cleared away the entangled vegetation covering the ruins to enable the use of his camera lucida. At Palenque, despite suffering from malaria contracted within a month of his arrival in Central America, he made maps and over fifty drawings. Catherwood's health, however, declined precipitously, and Stephens decided to suspend the expedition.<br>
<br>Catherwood and Stephens arrived in New York in July 1840. The next month, prompted by a letter from his brother James, Catherwood returned unannounced to London and confronted his wife, accusing her of having an affair. He sailed back to New York in late October and on 11 December filed a writ in the court of exchequer charging Henry Caslon (1793&#150;1873), Catherwood's second cousin and the son of his father's former business partner, with &#145;criminal conversation&#146; with Gertrude Catherwood. The case went to trial one year later; by this time Caslon and Catherwood's wife were openly living together. The defendant argued, however, that Catherwood's marriage was invalid because it had not been conducted by an Anglican priest, but the court ruled it was valid <i>de facto</i> if not <i>de jure</i>. A later ruling (1844) overturned this decision, but in the first trial the jury took only twenty minutes to decide in Catherwood's favour, awarding him damages of &pound;200.<br>
<br>In June 1841 Stephens published <span class="italic">Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan</span>, which instantly earned the authors great accolades on both sides of the Atlantic. According to the historian William H. Prescott, Catherwood's copious and compelling illustrations clinched the book's success. Shortly after the work was published these images engendered a transatlantic response, prompting officials at the British Museum (principally Henry Ellis and Philip Henry Stanhope) to secure the government's aid in carting off Mayan ruins for exhibition in the national repository. The scheme came to naught, but it occupied British officials in London and Central America for years.<br>
<br>Stephens and Catherwood soon recommenced their explorations, turning their attention now to the Yucatan peninsula. They arrived in October 1841 accompanied by Samuel Cabot, a physician from Boston, and bearing with them a daguerreotype machine, one of the first brought to Mexico. They began by taking daguerreotypes of the local people, whom they invited to sit for portraits. These pictures, shot by Catherwood, constitute the first use of the daguerreotype for anthropological research. He later tried to use the machine for limning the ruins, but found it unsuited to bringing out their carved reliefs, which he presciently understood were not simply decorative, but connected to a linguistic system, as were the hieroglyphs he had depicted in Egypt. In June 1842 Catherwood and Stephens returned to New York, taking the daguerreotypes with them, among the first archaeological photographs produced in Spanish America. Tragically all were lost in a fire on 31 July that consumed Catherwood's Rotunda; several priceless Mayan monuments removed by Stephens and Catherwood were also destroyed. The sketches made from the daguerreotypes, however, appeared in Stephens's <span class="italic">Incidents of Travel in Yucatan</span> (1843).<br>
<br>In July 1843 Catherwood was back in England working on his next project, a large folio volume of twenty-five lithographs complete with maps, introductions, and descriptions, printed by Owen Jones and limited to an edition of three hundred sets. The images from <span class="italic">Views of Ancient Monuments</span> (1844), along with those produced for the two Stephens volumes, immediately became among the most widely circulated representations of pre-Hispanic American monuments ever published, a status they continue to hold.<br>
<br>Catherwood's last decade saw him turn, with a few exceptions, from art to a variety of projects connected with railway building. After finishing his work on <span class="italic">Views</span> he returned to New York, where he exhibited fourteen drawings at the National Academy of Design. The next year he travelled back to England to train as a civil engineer, working for a time on the Sheffield&#150;Manchester Railway. In 1845 he was offered a contract by the directors of the Demerara Railway Company, and sailed for British Guiana, where he worked on surveying the line, the first in South America. The scheme, however, encountered many difficulties and by 1849 Catherwood's contract was terminated. He immediately accepted work on another railway project, the Panama Railroad, one of whose directors was Stephens. The railway, begun shortly after the California gold rush, was eventually completed in 1855, and became one of the most profitable ventures of the mid-century railway boom, but Catherwood became ill again with malaria, and left the railroad company for California in August 1850 to recover his health. Over the next two years, during the heyday of gold fever, he worked as a civil engineer on railways in California and undertook expeditions to the mines in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. In 1852 he sailed to England, issuing a new edition of <span class="italic">Incidents of Travel</span>, which included a brief biography of Stephens, who had recently died.<br>
<br>In December 1853 Gertrude Catherwood married Henry Caslon, and the following year Catherwood's brother James died. In consequence, Catherwood altered his will on 16 September 1854, naming his son Frederick as an executor. On 20 September 1854, having settled his affairs, Catherwood sailed again for America on the SS <i>Arctic</i>, intending to return to California. Seven days out at sea, on 27 September 1854, he died when the <i>Arctic</i> collided with another ship off the coast of Newfoundland and went down in the icy waters of the north Atlantic. After the New York papers omitted him from the published lists of the dead, a now famous correction appeared: &#145;Mr Catherwood, also, is missing.&#146; On 22 March 1855 Gertrude Caslon renounced the probate and execution of Catherwood's will on behalf of Frederick Abbott Catherwood, who at the age of twenty was still a legal minor. Catherwood's drawings, books, and other possessions were sold at auction in 1856.<br>
<br>A man of prodigious energy and unusually varied talents who published only a tiny fraction of his overall output, Catherwood was in the vanguard of many fields: Middle Eastern archaeological travel and surveying; panoramic exhibition; New World archaeology and photography; and South American railway building. Though he was reticent about himself&#151;unusually so even by his era's standards&#151;his work speaks eloquently of his achievements and imagination. His depictions of Mayan ruins have introduced generations of readers to the culture, first through printed sources and now through the internet, where they circulate more widely than ever. By capturing in these images the magnificence of a bygone world, and by arguing that the monuments were indigenous, contrary to the received opinion of the day, he revitalized Central American archaeology and can be credited, along with Stephens, with having launched it as a field of inquiry.<br>
