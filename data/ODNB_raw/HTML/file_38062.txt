<span class="headword">Thornton,  Abraham</span>  (<em>c.</em>1793&#150;1860), <span class="occ">bricklayer and accused murderer</span>, was the son of a builder of Castle Bromwich. He was accused of rape and murder after attending a dance where he became intimate with a gardener's daughter named Mary Ashford. They left the dance together and her body was found the next morning in a deep pool of water near a local footpath. Thornton was tried at the Warwick assizes on 8 August 1817. Since the marks on Mary's body were not necessarily inconsistent with Thornton's claim that she had consented to sexual intercourse, and since the times on the morning in question when Thornton was seen walking home to Bromwich suggested he could not have been with her when she met her death, the jury found him not guilty.<br>
<br>The case aroused much interest and reminded people of the similar murder of a local woman a year earlier. Many were convinced of Thornton's guilt and he was assailed in local and London newspapers. A group collecting around the Birmingham solicitor William Bedford invoked the old legal process of &#145;appeal of murder&#146;, by which a person acquitted of murder could be tried again for the same offence. This process was generally regarded as obsolete, though there had been several instances in the eighteenth century. More controversy arose when Thornton came before the court of the king's bench in November 1817 and demanded ordeal by battle, which was open to the subject of an appeal of murder but had not been claimed since Charles I's reign. After several hearings between November 1817 and April 1818 the court decided that the appellee did have this right. The appeal of murder was dropped. Appeals of murder were abolished in 1819 partly because of this case.<br>
<br>Thornton was corpulent, about 5 feet 7 inches tall, of &#145;forbidding&#146; and &#145;very lusty&#146; appearance, with powerful limbs, a short, thick neck, and a swollen, shining face. He had a local reputation as a sportsman and a strong man, and also as a womanizer. In all his court appearances he was noted for his calmness and composure. Opinion remained hostile towards Thornton; he had to be protected from the London crowds during the hearings there, and back in Bromwich he was hated. Unable to live a normal life, he emigrated to the USA in September 1818. He prospered, married, and died in Baltimore in 1860.<br>
