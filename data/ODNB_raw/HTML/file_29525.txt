<span class="headword">Williams,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Ab Ithel]</span>  (1811&#150;1862), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at T&#375; Nant, Llangynhafal, Denbighshire, the son of Roger Williams (son of William Bethell or Ab Ithel) and his wife, Elizabeth. He received his early education in Ruthin grammar school, and on 15 March 1832, at the age of twenty, matriculated at Oxford from Jesus College. He graduated BA in 1835 and was ordained deacon on 19 July that year and priest on 1 May 1836. On 11 July 1836 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Owen Lloyd Williams of Dolgellau. He was at the time a curate in the parish of Llanfor, with special charge of the new church of Holy Trinity, Rhosygwaliau, and when in 1839 a separate endowment was provided for this church, he became its first incumbent. In 1838 he proceeded MA. From 1843 to 1849 he was perpetual curate of Nerquis, near Mold; in the latter year he received the rectory of Llanymawddwy, where he remained until 1862.<br>
<br>From his youth Williams was keenly interested in Welsh historical studies, and the Welsh &#145;tract&#146;, afterwards translated into English, which he published at Bala in 1836 under the title <span class="italic">Eglwys Loegr yn anymddibynol ar eglwys Rufain</span> (&#145;The Church of England independent of the Church of Rome&#146;) was the first of a long succession of similar works. In 1841 he won a prize at Swansea eisteddfod for an essay, published in 1842, on the human sacrifices of the druids. These earlier efforts were embodied in 1844 in <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical Antiquities of the Cymry</span> (2nd edn 1854). Ab Ithel, as he had now begun to style himself, was an active opponent of the scheme for the union of the bishoprics of Bangor and St Asaph, and was thus brought into association with Harry Longueville Jones. The two issued in January 1846 the first number of <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span>, a quarterly journal devoted to Welsh antiquities, and before the end of the year succeeded in forming the Cambrian Archaeological Association, which took over the new journal and appointed Williams and Jones joint editors. Ab Ithel was a constant contributor to the early volumes, and many of his papers were separately issued, including the account of Valle Crucis (1846), the essay on druidic stones (1850), and the glossary of terms used for articles of British dress and armour (1851). In 1851 he became sole editor; this office he resigned, however, at the end of 1853, and in 1854 he established the Cambrian Institute and started the <span class="italic">Cambrian Journal</span>, which he edited until his death. The control of the older association had passed to men who had no sympathy with his uncritical methods and perfervid patriotism. In 1852 he published <span class="italic">Y Gododin</span>, an edition with a translation, introduction, and notes. Another Welsh association, the Welsh Manuscript Society, appointed him one of its editors, and under its auspices he published at Llandovery in 1856 <span class="italic">Dosparth edeyrn davod aur</span>, a medieval Welsh grammar. At the Llangollen eisteddfod of 1858, of which he was one of the chief organizers, he won a prize for the best essay on Welsh bardic lore; this was published by the Welsh Manuscript Society under the title of <span class="italic">Barddas</span> (1862), though in an incomplete form, the second volume not appearing until 1874. Ab Ithel was also the editor of the society's volume on the physicians of Myddfai (1861), though his part in this was small. Among his other works were <span class="italic">Crwydriadau yr hen wr</span> (1849), <span class="italic">Cloch y llan</span> (1854), <span class="italic">Brwydr yr alma</span> (1855), <span class="italic">Dafydd Llwyd</span> (1856), and <span class="italic">The Traditionary Annals of the Cymry</span> (1858). In 1854 he began a church monthly, <span class="italic">Baner y Groes</span>, and during 1859 and 1860 he edited the journal <span class="italic">Taliesin</span>; his activities also involved him with a group of clergymen, later known as <i>yr</i> <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95356', "hen bersoniaid llengar")</script> (&#145;the old literary clerics&#146;), who fostered Welsh literature in the first half of the nineteenth century.<br>
<br>For all his industry and enthusiasm Ab Ithel had no critical ability, and blindly accepted the bardic traditions popularized by Iolo Morganwg and William Owen Pughe. His defects as a scholar were brought out clearly in the editions of <span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span> and <span class="italic">Brut y tywysogion</span>, which he issued for the master of the rolls in 1860. All that was valuable in these was the work of Aneurin Owen, whose papers were at Ab Ithel's disposal, and were used without any acknowledgement  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span>, 1861). In 1862 the rectory of Llanenddwyn, with the perpetual curacy of Llanddwywe, near Barmouth, was given to him; but on 27 August of that year, very shortly after moving to his new home, he died. He was buried at Llanddwywe.<br>
