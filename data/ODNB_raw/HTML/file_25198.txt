<span class="headword">Shakespear,  John</span>  (1774&#150;1858), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, born at Lount, near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, in August 1774, was the son of a small farmer. He was educated at the parish school at Staunton Harold, and afterwards at a school kept by a clergyman, who brought him to the notice of Francis Rawdon Hastings, Lord Rawdon, the lord of the manor. Lord Rawdon, who was contemplating a mission to north Africa, sent Shakespear to learn Arabic in London. In 1793 Lord Rawdon obtained for him a post in the commissariat of a force under his command, which was sent in aid of the royalist insurgents in Brittany but which returned without having achieved anything.<br>
<br>About 1805 Shakespear was appointed to an oriental professorship at the Royal Military College, Marlow. When the East India Company opened its college at Addiscombe in 1809, he was appointed professor of Hindustani. While there he compiled a Hindustani grammar (1813) and dictionary (1817), and various textbooks. Of the first edition of his dictionary he said that it was little more than a revision of one published in Calcutta by William Hunter, but subsequent editions contained the results of his own scholarship. In 1829 he retired from the East India Company's service with a pension. Being frugal he put by a considerable part of his salary and, with the large sums from the sale of his books, he was able on his retirement to buy Langley Priory, near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, thereby fulfilling, it was said, the ambition of his boyhood.<br>
<br>In 1856 Shakespear gave &pound;2500 to the trustees of the fund for preserving William Shakespeare's house at Stratford upon Avon, prompted apparently by the idea that he might have been descended from a branch of the dramatist's family. In his will (which was proved at under &pound;18,000 in 1860) he bequeathed a further sum to the fund but the court of chancery pronounced the bequest invalid. He died at Langley Priory on 10 June 1858, unmarried, the estate passing to his nephew, Charles Bowles, who had followed his uncle and become professor of Hindustani at Addiscombe, and who took the surname of Shakespear.<br>
