<span class="headword">Coelson <span class="st"> [Colson]</span>,  Lancelot</span>  (1627&#150;1687?), <span class="occ">astrologer and medical practitioner</span>, was born on 25 March 1627 at Colchester. His astrological &#145;accidents&#146; record that he married in 1645 (at the age of eighteen), but his wife's name is unknown. He was wounded fighting in Cromwell's Scottish campaign in 1650. By the mid-1650s he had settled in London, close to the Tower, where he remained for the rest of his life; from 1671 to 1685 he was at the Royal Oak, Still Yard, on Great Tower Hill. On 23 March 1656 he visited a Fifth Monarchist conventicle in Swan Alley, Coleman Street, apparently out of curiosity, and was so alarmed by the bloodthirsty rhetoric urging Cromwell's assassination that he gave a full account to Sir John Barkstead, lieutenant of the Tower. It was a glimpse of the disaffection that was to lead to Venner's attempted rising in April 1657.<br>
<br>From about 1655 Coelson practised astrology and medicine, specializing in venereal disease, deafness, and scrofula. He received patients in the morning and visited the sick in the afternoon. In 1656 he published <span class="italic">The Poor-Mans Physician and Chyrurgian</span>, dedicated to Barkstead. Based on traditional galenical principles, it provided sensible guidelines and details of 300 medical recipes. By 1668, when he published his alchemical work <span class="italic">Philosophia maturata</span>, he had come to adopt Paracelsian principles; the tract described the preparation of <i>aurum potabile</i> (drinkable gold), and gave details of chemical medicines taken from <span class="italic">L'or potable</span> (1611) by the Italian physician Angelo Sala. He also published a series of almanacs for the years 1671&#150;87, passing them off as the products of a few weeks' recreation. They include copious historical notes on the 1640s and 1650s, which reveal some traces of his old parliamentary loyalties, and fiercely protestant comments on the Popish Plot. Several editions carry dedications to influential friends: Sir William Warren the shipowner, Sir John Friend MP, with whom Coelson served for twenty years in the Tower trained bands, Sir Richard Howe MP, sheriff of London and a major in the Surrey trained bands, William Coulson, gentleman, of Jesmond near Newcastle (possibly a kinsman), and Robert Seaman, surgeon and alderman of Harwich.<br>
<br>Coelson used the almanacs to advertise his medical services, cosmetic products, and proprietary medicines, which were supplied through several outlets in London and by a shopkeeper in Wiltshire. In his deposition in 1656 he described himself as &#145;gentleman&#146;, and the almanac dedications sought to convey a sense of respectability. In 1666, as &#145;Lan. Coleson M. D.&#146;, he signed a testimonial recommending another physician to be licensed by the bishop of London  (Guildhall Library London, MS10, 116/4), which underlines the position he had achieved. His friends included many of the leading astrologers of the day, including Lilly, Richard Saunders, Richard Edlin, John Gadbury, and Henry Coley. Despite his &#145;incomparable&#146; medicines Coelson suffered prolonged poor health. Noting serious recent illnesses in his almanacs for 1680, 1682, 1684, and 1685, he took the opportunity each time to correct reports that he was dead, reassuring readers that his professional services were still available. The almanac for 1687 was his last work, and he probably died in that year. It is possible that Coelson was related to John Colson the mathematician and Nathaniel Colson, who published a nautical almanac in 1675 which went through several editions.<br>
