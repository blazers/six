<span class="headword">Blayney,  Andrew Thomas</span>, eleventh Baron Blayney  (1770&#150;1834), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Castle Blayney, co. Monaghan, on 30 November 1770. His father, Cadwallader Blayney, ninth Baron Blayney of Monaghan in the peerage of Ireland (1720&#150;1775), a lieutenant-general in the army, was descended from an old Welsh family which had lived in Ireland since the reign of Elizabeth I. His mother was Elizabeth Tipping (<i>d</i>. 1775), daughter of Thomas Tipping of Beaulieu, co. Louth. Educated at military academies in France and Germany, Blayney succeeded his brother as eleventh Baron Blayney on 2 April 1784 and entered the army as an ensign in the 32nd regiment on 25 November 1789. He became lieutenant in an independent company in 1791, and captain in the 38th on 28 February 1792. Having raised part of the new regiment in Ireland, he was gazetted major in the 89th foot on 3 December 1793 and served with it during the campaign in Flanders in 1794&#150;5, gaining special mention after the action at Boxtel in September 1794. His regiment was then ordered to accompany Sir Ralph Abercromby to the West Indies; but the terrible storm, known as &#145;Christian's storm&#146; from the name of the admiral, drove the transports back. On 3 May 1796 he became brevet lieutenant-colonel, purchasing that substantive rank in the 89th on 1 March 1798. On 5 July 1796 he married Lady Mabella Alexander (1775&#150;1854), eldest daughter of James, first earl of Caledon. They had three children: Cadwallader Davis (<i>b</i>. 21 Feb 1803, <i>d</i>. 1874), Anne, and Charlotte Sophia.<br>
<br>In 1797&#150;8 Blayney was actively engaged in subduing unrest in Ireland, culminating in defeat of the rebels at Vinegar Hill. In January 1799 the 89th was ordered to form part of the garrison of Minorca, which had just been captured by Sir Charles Stuart. Following Rear-Admiral Lord Nelson's recommendation that Sicily be protected from French attack, Blayney went on to Messina in command of the 89th, arriving on 18 March 1799. The regiment then joined reinforcements, who landed in St Paul's Bay, Malta, on 9 December 1799, to tighten the siege of French troops in Valletta. With little action likely, Blayney left for northern Italy, where he witnessed the exploits of General Suvorov's army, about which he sent home an admirable account; but he returned to Malta in time to plant the English flag on the ramparts of Ricasoli, on 4 September 1800. The 89th then took part in Abercromby's expedition to Egypt, being present, though not engaged, at the battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801. The regiment advanced with the main body to capture Cairo and remain as part of its garrison until the British expeditionary force withdrew from the country. Blayney received the approbation of Lieutenant-General J. H. Hutchinson (commander after Abercromby's death) for his conduct during the campaign. The 89th landed at Cork on 28 January 1802. Following the peace of Amiens on 27 March, it was reduced to peacetime establishment and remained in Ireland for the next three years. When Lieutenant-Colonel William Stewart, his senior, left the regiment on 14 November 1802, Blayney formally obtained command.<br>
<br>Promoted colonel on 1 January 1805, Blayney sailed in November with the 89th (who became known as Blayney's Bloodhounds) to join Lord Cathcart's expedition to Hanover, arriving on the River Weser on 5 January 1806 to discover cancellation of the enterprise after Napoleon's victory at the battle of Austerlitz. <i>En route</i>, Blayney had left his troopship off the Thames to visit London, and he returned to find that it had resumed passage, which meant that he had to catch up in another vessel. After a short spell in England, on 14 September 1806 the 89th left Ramsgate for South America, but put into Portsmouth due to a serious outbreak of ophthalmia. It left again, on 29 February 1807, and arrived off Montevideo after Lieutenant-General John Whitelock had surrendered; it was, therefore, ordered to the Cape of Good Hope. Three ships became waterlogged and put into Saldanha Bay on the African coast, and Blayney had to march their troops 90 miles to Cape Town over arid wasteland in extreme heat. Survival of the bulk of the party was ascribed to Blayney's determined leadership. While he was away on active service Blayney, a strong Orangeman, was MP for Old Sarum (1806&#150;7), the notorious burgage borough which his brother-in-law, the second earl of Caledon, had bought in 1802.<br>
<br>Blayney soon found that there was no fighting to be expected at the Cape; he returned to England and was sent to Cadiz, then under siege, in July 1810. He rapidly moved on to Gibraltar, where he found the 2nd battalion 89th regiment, and was promoted major-general on 25 July. He inspected it and reported unfavourably on its discipline. General Campbell, governor of Gibraltar, soon sent him&#151;with a mixed force of 300 British (four companies of the 89th), 800 Spanish, and 500 German, Italian, and Polish deserters from the French army&#151;to make a descent on Malaga. Blayney disembarked near Fuengirola on 14 October 1810, and was joined by a few Andalusian guerrillas. His force of 1400 men now spoke five languages but had no artillery. Nevertheless, in vain, he summoned the garrison of Fuengirola to surrender, as he learned of an approaching relief column under General Sebastini. Instead of re-embarking, he decided to engage Fuengirola again and to land artillery from the accompanying gunboats under cover of darkness before Sebastini could intervene. Two batteries were brought ashore during the night and, despite heavy infantry casualties the previous day, Blayney once more opened fire on Fuengirola. A sortie by the garrison on his left dispersed Spanish troops, who abandoned their artillery. He gathered the 89th successfully to retake the guns, recording: &#145;In advancing to the charge my horse was wounded, and soon after killed by a second shot, so I was obliged to charge on foot&#146;  (Cunliffe, 133). Thus dismounted, he could not verify reports that a body of Spanish had been seen. Belatedly, he realized that Sebastini had, in fact, arrived, and he promptly charged the enemy, though still on foot. Many of his former French troops redeserted, and he and several British survivors were captured. He recorded that he was roughly treated by Polish infantry (&#145;they tore my cloaths, rifled my pockets, and attempted to pull off my epaulettes&#146;; ibid.) until a French officer appeared. His conduct of the whole affair, however, was later condemned as foolhardy and impetuous.<br>
<br>Lord Blayney's passage as a prisoner of war through Spain, and his imprisonment in France at Verdun, Bitche, and Gu&eacute;ret, provided him with a novel experience. In his two-volume <span class="italic">Narrative of a forced journey through Spain and France as a prisoner of war in the years 1810 to 1814</span> (1814) he shows great powers of observation, describing vividly how the Spanish people lived while under French occupation. During his captivity he was entrusted with funds for the relief of the poorer English prisoners. His health was now impaired, however, and he saw no further military service, though he was promoted lieutenant-general on 12 August 1819. Blayney died suddenly at Bilton's Hotel, Sackville Street, Dublin, on 8 April 1834 and was buried at Castle Blayney, co. Monaghan. He had left the estate neglected, and it was sold to Henry Thomas Hope, Disraeli's friend and patron. His son became the twelfth baron, but never married, and at his death, on 18 January 1874, the barony became extinct.<br>
