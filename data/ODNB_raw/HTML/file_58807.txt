<span class="headword">Hume,  Ferguson Wright <span class="st"> [Fergus]</span></span>  (1859&#150;1932), <span class="occ">author</span>, was born at Powick, Worcestershire, on 8 July 1859, the second son of James Collin Hume (1823&#150;1896), steward at the Worcestershire Pauper Lunatic Asylum, and his wife, Mary Ferguson (<i>d</i>. 1867). Both parents were natives of Glasgow. In 1863 the family emigrated to New Zealand; James Hume founded the first private mental hospital in that country and was also a founder of Dunedin College.<br>
<br>Fergus Hume was educated at the boys' high school in Dunedin before taking a law degree at Otago University. He then served his articles in the office of the attorney-general of New Zealand and was called to the New Zealand bar in 1885. In that year he moved to Melbourne, Victoria, where he took a job as a solicitor's clerk, but his aim was to become the author of plays for the stage. He thought the best way to attract the attention of theatre managers would be to write a successful book, so he:<blockquote>took advice of a leading Melbourne bookseller. I enquired what style of book he sold most of. He replied that the detective stories of [Emile] Gaboriau had a large sale &hellip; I determined to write a book of the same class, containing a mystery, a murder and a description of low life in Melbourne. (Knight)</blockquote>The resulting novel, <span class="italic">The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</span>, was rejected by George Robinson, the leading Melbourne publisher, so in 1886 Hume had it privately printed in Australia and claimed that he sold 5000 copies in three weeks. The novel was dedicated to the novelist James Payn, then editor of the <span class="italic">Cornhill Magazine</span>, &#145;in grateful acknowledgement of his kind encouragement to the author&#146;. Hume then sold, for &pound;50, the rights of the novel to a group of London-based entrepreneurs, headed by Frederick Trischler, who promptly established their Hansom Cab Publishing Company in Ludgate Hill. The first London printing (1887) of 25,000 copies was sold out in three days, and subsequent printings were purchased by an eager public across the world. Many editions followed, but Hume did not benefit financially. He was now, however, established as the author of an international best-seller: by the time of his death its sales had reached 500,000. With its &#145;complex and highly surprising ending&#146;  (Knight), it was the first international detective novel, the Australian edition predating Conan Doyle's <span class="italic">Study in Scarlet</span> (1887) by a year. Critics have questioned just why Hume's &#145;shoddy pot boiler &hellip; received vastly more contemporary attention than Doyle's <span class="italic">Study in Scarlet</span>&#146; and became, in the assessment of Willard Huntington Wright, &#145;the greatest commercial success in the annals of detective fiction&#146;  (Haycroft, 63). Such was the success of Hume's novel that a full-length parody, <span class="italic">The Mystery of a Wheelbarrow, or, Gaboriam Gaborooed</span>, by &#145;W. Humer Ferguson&#146;, was published in 1888. Hume had prudently retained for himself the dramatic rights of <span class="italic">The Mystery of the Hansom Cab</span> and as a result benefited from the stage versions by the Australian playwright George Darrell, which had long and successful runs in Australia and London.<br>
<br>In 1888 Hume sailed for England and, having settled in London, became a full-time writer. He still considered himself a New Zealand, and not an Australian, author. His best-seller, with its realistic expos&eacute; of Melbourne high and low society, was sometimes less well received in the Antipodes, where some criticized how their societies were portrayed by &#145;one who is representing us in the Old Country&#146;  (Robinson and others, 249). Afterwards he wrote 140 novels, half of them mystery and detective stories, but none came close to matching the success of <span class="italic">The Mystery of a Hansom Cab</span>, which was reprinted and published in new editions through the twentieth century. He tried writing romances, starting with his second novel, <span class="italic">Madame Midas</span> (1889), which again described Melbourne society and was one of his few books with Australian settings. This was reprinted in 1914 and 1985, but his romances were not particularly successful and, as he later complained, publishers would not hear of him writing anything but detective stories. His ambition to write for the stage continued, and he was the author of eight plays, including one for Sir Henry Irving, who died before the play could be presented.<br>
<br>Although he travelled in Switzerland, France, and Italy, Hume lived and worked for the rest of his life in the London area. The last of his novels appeared in 1926, yet he is invariably remembered as a one-book author. Following a serious operation for a glandular problem he seemed, to some, to lose his power of writing. After retiring to the Rayleigh area of Essex, he concentrated on lecturing to young people's clubs and debating societies. A deeply religious man, he died of cardiac failure at his home, Rosemary, Grove Road, Thundersley, Essex, on 11 July 1932.<br>
