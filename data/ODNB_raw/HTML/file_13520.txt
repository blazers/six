<span class="headword">Holland,  Guy</span>  (1585/6&#150;1660), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was a native of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge, matriculating at Easter 1602 and graduating BA in 1606. Soon afterwards he became a Roman Catholic. He entered the English College at Valladolid on 26 November 1608, aged twenty-two, under the name of Guido Holt. At Valladolid he was ordained priest in 1613, and in May sent to England. A member of the Society of Jesus from 1615, his movements for the next years are not known, but it is likely that he was engaged on missionary work in England.<br>
<br>Certainly from 1621 to 1632 Holland was a missioner of the House of Probation of St Ignatius in London. He appears in John Gee's <span class="italic">A Foot out of the Snare</span> as a Jesuit resident in the city in 1623. On 15 March 1628 the house, at Clerkenwell, was raided. Holland and four colleagues were discovered hidden in a small enclosure created by a newly built brick wall. On 27 March the privy council issued a warrant for his imprisonment. Nothing discouraged, on 14 July he was professed of the four vows. In 1634 and 1636 he was still attached to the London house. In 1633 and in 1638, however, he worked under the supervision of the residence of St George (Worcestershire and Warwickshire).<br>
<br>From 1639 Holland acted as a missioner of the residence of St Mary (Oxfordshire), serving as its superior in 1645&#150;6. A reply to the <span class="italic">Discourse of the Infallibility of the Church of Rome</span> by Lucius Cary (Lord Falkland) has been attributed to Holland, and <span class="italic">The Grand Prerogative of Human Nature</span> (1653), an attack on the belief that the soul dies with the body, is probably his work. Other writings remained unpublished because the censors considered &#145;that in one or two points he rather deviated from the common opinion of the doctors&#146;  (Foley, 7(1).365). He was attached to the Oxfordshire residence in 1655 and it seems likely that his last years were spent there. He died on 16 November 1660.<br>
