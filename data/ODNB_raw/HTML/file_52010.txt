<span class="headword">Blackburn <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wedderburn]</span>,  Jemima</span>  (1823&#150;1909), <span class="occ">painter and illustrator</span>, was born on 1 May 1823 at 31 Heriot Row, Edinburgh, the youngest of the six children of James Wedderburn (1782&#150;1822), solicitor-general for Scotland, and Isabella Clerk (1789&#150;1865). Her early childhood was overshadowed by the death of her father (before her birth) and beset by intermittent illness. She was encouraged to draw by her doctor, the distinguished John Abercrombie, and although she seems to have received no artistic training and little formal education, Jemima Wedderburn lived in vibrant intellectual surroundings which moulded her remarkable, enquiring mind. (As a child she used to skin mice so as to find out how their muscles worked.) Her cousin the physicist James Clerk Maxwell moved to 31 Heriot Row after the death of his mother and the close friendship that developed was vital and stimulating to both. The physician Henry Acland introduced her to John Ruskin who took a keen interest in her work, even thinking of her, according to a letter from Effie Ruskin, &#145;as the best artist he knows&#146;  (Lutyens, 113&#150;14). Sir Edwin Landseer claimed that in the drawing of animals he had nothing to teach her  (G. Du Maurier, <span class="italic">The Young George Du Maurier: a Selection of his Letters</span>, 1860&#150;67, appendix, 287). On 12 June 1849 Wedderburn married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59883/', "Hugh Blackburn (1823&#150;1909)")</script>, professor of mathematics at Glasgow University. Outside term they stayed at Ardmillan House in Ayrshire until, in 1853, they purchased the estate of Roshven lying on the remote north coast of Moidart in the west highlands. It was there that her best work was accomplished. She often painted ambitious compositions, such as the magnificent watercolour <span class="italic">Building a Haystack</span> (<i>c</i>.1857), and she has come to be regarded as one of Scotland's first major women artists of the modern period  (MacDonald, 113). Blackburn kept a visual journal (Christies, 1 December 1994, dispersed) from the age of twelve, describing the day's activities. Each entry contained at least one drawing or painting and described the circles in which she moved, her wide travels, and life on a Victorian west highland estate. Her work grew in popularity and she became much sought after as an illustrator of books and periodicals, <span class="italic">The History of Thomas Thumb</span> (1855) and <span class="italic">The Cat's Pilgrimage</span> (1870) being perhaps the most attractive. Blackburn had always held a keen interest in natural history and Charles Darwin acknowledged that it was she who first recorded how the young cuckoo ejects its rivals from the nest  (Darwin, <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span>, 6th edn, 1882). In 1862 she produced <span class="italic">Birds from Nature</span>, a volume of bird illustrations painted from life which immediately placed her in the first rank of Victorian ornithological illustrators. The book was reissued in 1868 in an enlarged edition, though only six copies were coloured, a fact which undoubtedly has led to her lack of recognition.<br>
<br>Blackburn travelled widely, visiting countries from Egypt to Iceland, the latter visited in a party which included Anthony Trollope with whom she produced an idiosyncratic account of their adventures: <span class="italic">How the Mastiffs Went to Iceland</span> (1878). With much taste and judgement, the Blackburns turned Roshven into one of the most beautiful estates on the west coast and for a time it became a summer destination for many of the most distinguished scientists and artists of the age, in particular Hugh Blackburn's closest friend, the physicist and mathematician William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, and the German physiologist and physicist Hermann von Helmholtz. Her artistic and intellectual powers diminished by senile dementia, Jemima Blackburn died on 9 August 1909. Her husband, who was two months and one day younger, survived her by exactly two months. They were buried in the private graveyard at Roshven. The National Portrait Gallery and British Museum, London, the National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh, and the Royal Library, Windsor, hold collections of her works.<br>
