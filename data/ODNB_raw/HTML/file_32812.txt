<span class="headword">Dicey,  Edward James Stephen</span>  (1832&#150;1911), <span class="occ">author and journalist</span>, born on 15 May 1832 at Claybrook Hall, Claybrook, near Lutterworth, Leicestershire, was the second son of Thomas Edward Dicey (<i>b</i>. 1789), of an old Leicestershire family, who was senior wrangler at Cambridge in 1811, was a pioneer of the Midland Railway, and owned the <span class="italic">Northampton Mercury</span>. Dicey's mother, Anne Mary, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26374/', "Sir James Stephen")</script>, was aunt of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26375/', "Sir James Fitzjames Stephen")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36271/', "Sir Leslie Stephen")</script>. His younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32811/', "Albert Venn Dicey")</script>.<br>
<br>Educated at home and, for about two years, at King's College, London, Dicey went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1850, was president of the Cambridge Union in 1853, and graduated BA in 1854 with a third class in the classical tripos and as a senior optime in mathematics. After leaving Cambridge he went for a short time into business without success, and then took to writing, following in the tradition of many of his relatives. From 1860 he was a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>. He travelled abroad and interested himself in foreign politics. In 1861 he published <span class="italic">Rome in 1860</span> and <span class="italic">Cavour: a Memoir</span>, thereby establishing his reputation as a political commentator. The following year Dicey visited America and wrote in <span class="italic">Macmillan's Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> on the American Civil War, in which he supported the Union. There followed in 1863 <span class="italic">Six Months in the Federal States</span>.<br>
<br>In 1861 Dicey became connected with the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>&#151;then a strongly Liberal paper&#151;and his style and knowledge of foreign questions led to his being made a permanent member of the staff in 1862. Among his colleagues were Sir Edwin Arnold (an old schoolfriend), F. C. Lawley, and G. A. Sala. He was a leader writer for the paper, and also acted as special correspondent in the Prussian-Danish War of 1864 and the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. He embodied these experiences in the volumes <span class="italic">The Schleswig-Holstein War</span> (1864) and <span class="italic">The Battle-Fields of 1866</span> (1866). He afterwards described other foreign excursions in <span class="italic">A Month in Russia during the Marriage of the Czarevitch</span> (1867) and in <span class="italic">The Morning Land, being Sketches of Turkey, the Holy Land, and Egypt</span> (1870), the result of a three-month tour in the Near East.<br>
<br>While in the Near East in 1869 Dicey accepted an offer of the editorship of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span>, and held this post for three months in 1870. On leaving it he at once became editor of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, and filled that office for nineteen years (1870&#150;89), continuing to write for the paper for some time after he ceased to edit it. Under his editorship the paper's tone was scholarly, albeit with a small circulation. Subsequently he was a constant contributor to the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, the <span class="italic">Empire Review</span>, and other periodicals. His interest in foreign politics remained keen, especially in the affairs of eastern Europe. He was a frequent visitor to Egypt, and formed at first hand well-defined views of England's position there, at one time advocating the annexation of the country by Great Britain. He recorded his views in <span class="italic">England and Egypt</span> (1881; collected articles), <span class="italic">The Story of the Khedivate</span> (1902), and <span class="italic">The Egypt of the Future</span> (1907). He also published <span class="italic">Victor Emmanuel</span> (1882) and an account of Bulgaria (1894). Dicey, like his better-known brother, was one of those Liberal intellectuals who made their way into Unionism. He strongly attacked Gladstone's Irish and Egyptian policies in the early 1880s and he was an ardent opponent of home rule; but he remained a free-trader. He was a strong supporter of friendly relations between Britain and Germany, and closely studied South African matters in later years.<br>
<br>On 14 August 1867 Dicey married Anne Greene Chapman (<i>d</i>. 1878) of Weymouth, Massachusetts, daughter of Henry Grafton Chapman; they had one son, who predeceased his father. During his later life Dicey made his home in chambers in Gray's Inn (he had been called to the bar in 1875, though he never practised). He became a bencher there in 1896 and treasurer in 1903&#150;4. He frequented the Athenaeum and Garrick clubs. C. P. Lucas wrote of him:<blockquote>Dicey was by nature a singularly good observer; he had a great store of knowledge, much dry humour, a cool judgment, and a sound and vivid style. Though in a sense reserved and indifferent to outward appearances, he associated easily and genially with men around him, especially with foreigners, while he possessed a rare capacity for easy and clear description of scenes and events which were passing before his eyes. Being neither didactic nor controversial, nor in the ordinary sense professional, he exercised by his writings alike in books and newspapers considerable influence on public opinion. (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>Dicey died of cirrhosis of the liver at his chambers, 2 Gray's Inn Square, London, on 7 July 1911 and, after a funeral service in the Inn's chapel, was buried in Brompton cemetery.<br>
