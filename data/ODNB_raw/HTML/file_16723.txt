<span class="headword">Line <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Hall]</span>,  Francis</span>  (1595&#150;1675), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and natural philosopher</span>, was born in London or Buckinghamshire, probably to a recusant family. It is not known where he received his boyhood education; he was already a young man when he arrived at the college of the English Jesuits at St Omer, in Flanders, where, in 1622, he was listed among the top six pupils in the senior class. The following year he entered the noviciate and transferred first to the English Jesuit college at Li&egrave;ge, then to nearby Watten. Having been ordained priest he was appointed professor of mathematics and of Hebrew at Li&egrave;ge by 1632.<br>
<br>The cosmology taught at Li&egrave;ge broadly followed Aristotle in describing a geocentric universe; this was at odds with the Copernican system, which put the sun at the centre, a system which gained more support with the publication of Galileo's observations. Line was among those who read Galileo's works. Although some Jesuit astronomers were sympathetic to the Copernican system, Galileo was condemned to house arrest in 1633. This event brought to light one of Line's inventions, which was thought by one of Galileo's friends to offer a possible support for the Copernican system. In a book published in 1634 a Jesuit visiting Li&egrave;ge had mentioned Line's water-clock, which consisted of a glass globe filled with water, within which rotated a metal globe, carrying round with it a small &#145;fish&#146; which pointed to the hours of the day marked on the outer globe. Such a device might, it was proposed, demonstrate the rotation of the earth on its own axis. Although Line never disclosed the secret of his clock, it was probably the same as those previously contrived elsewhere, the inner globe containing clockwork, rotating an arm and magnet to which the &#145;fish&#146; was attracted.<br>
<br>The various types of sundial for which Line later became famous show his ingenuity and mathematical competence. When the future Charles II visited Li&egrave;ge he was shown in the college garden a great pyramidal structure bearing several dials, which so impressed him that twenty years later he invited Line to construct a similar one at Whitehall. Line, meanwhile, joined with other famous mathematicians of the day in the debate on squaring the circle. Proponents were searching for an algebraic formula to yield the dimensions of a square which would have the equivalent area to a given circle; opponents, of whom Line was one, denied that such a formula could exist.<br>
<br>In late 1657 or early 1658 Line left Li&egrave;ge and crossed to England, possibly by the petition of a nobleman who could offer protection. It has been suggested that this was Henry Pierrepoint, marquess of Dorchester and earl of Kingston. Line's first ministry may have been at the College of the Immaculate Conception, Derbyshire. By 1659 he was in London, then, by 1665, in Lancashire. His <span class="italic">De pseudo-quadratura circuli Dom. Thomas Viti</span>, attacking the proposals of the English secular priest Thomas White, was published in London in 1659, followed the next year by its English translation, <span class="italic">Refutation of the Attempt to Square the Circle</span>. He soon became embroiled in other arguments, notably with Robert Boyle. Boyle published in 1660 his <span class="italic">New Experiments Physico-Mechanical Touching the Spring of Air</span>, which had led him to conclude that the void over the mercury in the closed end of a barometer tube was indeed a vacuum, and that the mercury column was supported by the spring of air&#151;in modern terms, atmospheric pressure&#151;bearing down on the open end. This idea was anathema to Line, who responded with <span class="italic">Tractatus de corporum inseparabilitate in quo experimenta de vacuo</span> (1661), in which he defended Aristotle's teaching. Irritated by what he saw as a confusion of theological and scientific ideas, Boyle issued his <span class="italic">Defence Against Franciscus Linus</span> as an appendix to the second edition of his <span class="italic">New Experiments</span>. In addressing &#145;the learned author, who ever he may be&#146;, Boyle may have known Line as Francis Hall, the alias he seems to have used in England. The <span class="italic">Defence</span> obliged Boyle to clarify his arguments and to expound the principle now known as Boyle's law; whether or not Line was convinced, he published nothing further on this matter.<br>
<br>The sundial which had been erected in the privy gardens of Whitehall Palace by the prince of Wales, later Charles I, having been defaced, Charles II decided to replace it and invited Line to design the new dial, a task he undertook &#145;at my lodging in the country&#146;  (F. Line, <span class="italic">Explication of the Diall Sett up in the King's Garden at London</span>, 1673, 1). Unveiled on 24 July 1669, Line's &#145;Grande pyramidical multiform diall&#146;  (Line, <span class="italic">Explication</span>) was a large and elaborate structure rising tree-like from its stone pedestal. Comprising altogether more than 250 units, there were six main pieces of the dial in the form of stacked circular tables and large globes supported by iron branches, decreasing in size as they approached the pinnacle, an orb surmounted by a cross. Round the tables were dials showing time according to various historical and foreign forms of reckoning, above them glass plates bearing portraits of the royal family. Three dials consisted of water-filled globes which focused the sun's rays in various ways. One of these was Line's sundial for blind people, an example of which had been installed at Li&egrave;ge in 1635, and was seen there by an English visitor in 1699. It consisted of a 3 inch glass globe filled with water inside a 6 inch sphere consisting of several iron rings representing the hour circles. The sun's rays were brought to a focus on the rings, where it could be felt by hand. Unfortunately no one thought to protect Line's grandiose structure from winter's frost, and it suffered considerable damage. Line wrote his <span class="italic">Explication of the Diall Sett up in the King's Garden at London</span>, but had returned to Li&egrave;ge before its publication there, in Latin and English versions, with an engraving, in 1673. The structure was still standing in 1674 when the earl of Rochester and his friends passed through the garden in a mood of drunken exuberance and smashed its glass spheres. By 1681 it seems to have been dismantled and taken out of the garden.<br>
<br>Back in his post as professor of mathematics, Line continued with his earlier experiments in optics, and unwisely took up an argument between the Jesuit Ignace Gaston Pardies and Isaac Newton over the theory of colours as demonstrated with prisms and lenses. Pardies had realized his misunderstanding of Newton's work when he died in 1674, but Line decided to commence battle afresh, which he did in a series of letters to Henry Oldenburg, secretary to the Royal Society. His letters were passed to Newton, and Newton's increasingly exasperated replies were modulated by Oldenburg and sent to Line. Both sides made their experiments again, and still could not agree on the shape of the spectrum displayed by light passing through a prism; it later transpired that the disparity of their results arose largely because they were using prisms of differing density. But amid the argument Line succumbed to an epidemic and died at Li&egrave;ge on 15 November 1675.<br>
