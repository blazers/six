<span class="headword">Winfield, Sir  Percy Henry</span>  (1878&#150;1953), <span class="occ">lawyer and jurist</span>, was born at Stoke Ferry, Norfolk, on 16 September 1878, the fifth child and youngest son of Frederick Charles Winfield, corn merchant, and his wife, Mary Flatt. He was educated at King's Lynn grammar school (later King Edward VII School) and at St John's College, Cambridge, where in his first year he took a first class in the college examinations in law (1897) and was elected an exhibitioner and proper sizar. In 1898 he was senior in part one of the law tripos and was elected a foundation scholar, and in part two (1899) was again at the head of the first class. In 1900 he was awarded a Whewell scholarship in international law and his college elected him to a McMahon scholarship founded for graduates intending to prepare themselves for the legal profession.<br>
<br>Called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1903, Winfield joined the south-eastern circuit; but he soon returned to Cambridge to teach, both privately and (from 1911) in lecture and problem classes recommended by the special board for law. He married in 1909 Helena Chapman (<i>d</i>. 1954), daughter of William Thomas Scruby, estate agent, of Cambridge. They had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>After the First World War, during which Winfield was commissioned in the Cambridgeshire regiment (1915), was approved in absence for the LLD degree, and was wounded in action (August 1918), he lectured (Roman law, torts, criminal law) under the auspices of two colleges, Trinity and St John's. St John's soon elected him into an official fellowship (1921). In 1926 he became a university lecturer and in 1928 he was elected to the new Rouse Ball professorship of English law.<br>
<br>Winfield's lectures were well attended and appreciated. One recalls the elegant handwriting upon the blackboard before his lecture-hour began, the lecturer's spare athletic figure and lean judicial face, his flashes of dry humour, and the problem classes in which all in turn must act as counsel. His success as author and scholar owed much to his habit of thoroughly investigating the history of a legal topic before tackling its subtleties in the modern law. Early in 1914 the <span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span> published the first of his many legal articles, &#145;Some bibliographical difficulties of English law&#146;, exposing the deficiencies which then handicapped that method of approach. Then followed two monographs, both published in 1921, <span class="italic">The History of Conspiracy and Abuse of Legal Procedure</span> and (the largely post-war work) <span class="italic">The Present Law of Abuse of Legal Procedure</span>, in which that method was employed. Next, in 1925, his admirable <span class="italic">Chief Sources of English Legal History</span> (based on a course of lectures he had delivered at Harvard) more than remedied the bibliographical deficiencies which his first legal article had deplored.<br>
<br>Winfield's writings then turned to the history and development of various aspects of the law of torts, which had become his chief concern, and in 1931 he published his <span class="italic">Province of the Law of Tort</span>, examining its shadowy boundaries, past and present, and those of its neighbours, such as quasi-contract. The book, originally his Tagore lectures in Calcutta (1930), did much to stimulate academic discussion&#151;asking, for example, is there a general law of tort?&#151;and enabled him to proceed to a detailed analysis of the modern law. This he did in his <span class="italic">Textbook of the Law of Tort</span> (1937). &#145;Intended primarily for students&#146;, the textbook rapidly attained an outstanding reputation both in the academic world and among practitioners and judges wherever English common law is known. A critical review of it  (<span class="italic">Law Quarterly Review</span>, January 1938) foresaw this, emphasizing its infectious enthusiasm, unusual charm of style, and brilliant analysis of the more difficult problems. Before Winfield died it had reached its fifth edition. It has been a formative influence in English law, going through at least fourteen editions.<br>
<br>Winfield's other publications included <span class="italic">Salmond and Winfield on Contracts</span> (1927), in which, punctiliously enclosing his own contributions within square brackets, he preserved and completed Sir John Salmond's unfinished work; three editions of <span class="italic">Pollock on Contracts</span> (1942&#150;50); and a little book on the <span class="italic">Foundations and Future of International Law</span> (1941), the fruit of wartime lectures to groups of army officers. His <span class="italic">Select Legal Essays</span> (1952) contained fifteen of his numerous legal articles, reprinted from the learned journals of this country and overseas, including some of his later work on that arduous topic quasi-contract (&#145;unjust enrichment&#146;) to which a chapter of his <span class="italic">Province</span> had already made notable contributions. He edited the <span class="italic">Cambridge Law Journal</span> for twenty years (1927&#150;47).<br>
<br>As reader in common law to the Council of Legal Education (1938&#150;49) Winfield lectured also at the inns of court. He was elected an honorary bencher of the Inner Temple in 1938, served on the lord chancellor's law revision and law reporting committees, was for many years a borough magistrate and at one time a deputy county court judge. He took silk in 1943, the year in which his tenure of the Rouse Ball chair expired. He was elected FBA in 1934, was an honorary LLD of Harvard (1929), Leeds (1944), and London (1949), and was president of the Society of Public Teachers of Law for 1929&#150;30, and a vice-president of the Selden Society from 1944 to 1946. He was knighted in 1949.<br>
<br>Winfield had a great capacity for friendship and hospitality, delighting in the company of old and young alike and ever ready to spend time and trouble on their problems. His chief recreation was lawn tennis, in which he had gained college and &#145;Grasshopper&#146; university colours and had captained the county (1912&#150;14). He was also a keen supporter, latterly president, of the rugby football clubs of his college and university. Winfield died at his home, 13 Cranmer Road, Cambridge, on 7 July 1953.<br>
