<span class="headword">Robinson, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1643&#150;1712), <span class="occ">engineer and architect</span>, was descended from an &#145;ancient&#146; (his word) but unidentified family in Yorkshire. Nothing is known about his youth and training. Without prior military rank he became engineer and surveyor-general of all fortifications and building in Ireland in 1671. Not long afterwards he obtained the position of clerk of the ordnance. Before 1675 he had executed building and repairs for the royal works at Chapelizod House, Phoenix House, and Dublin Castle.<br>
<br>Robinson returned to England in 1677 and may have visited France, but was back in Ireland in the same year. Although the duke of Ormond thought Robinson very knowing in engineering, it was not Robinson but engineers employed under him, with some from the English Ordnance (Paulus Storff, Sir Bernard de Gomme, and Thomas Phillips), who planned or carried out major works on Irish fortifications. In 1679 Robinson again visited England, where he showed plans (probably those of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham) to the king. This must have been one of the busiest years in his architectural career, for his largest projects, the fort at Rincurran and the Royal Hospital, coincided with smaller ones such as Lismore Cathedral, co. Waterford, and the erection of a presence chamber probably in Dublin Castle.<br>
<br>After the disastrous fire at Dublin Castle in 1684, Robinson played a pivotal role in the redesigning of the building. In the same year he surrendered his patent as surveyor-general, and was granted a new patent which he shared with the experimental philosopher William Molyneux (1656&#150;1698), who seems to have taken a less active role than Robinson in the royal works. After the accession of James II in 1685, Robinson retired to England. There warrants were issued to apprehend him, but he avoided imprisonment. At the outbreak of the Williamite wars he became the comptroller-general of the provisions for the forces and commissionary-general of pay and provisions (both of which, in 1689, he shared, with Israel Fielding and Bartholomew Vanhomrigh respectively) and served in Ireland. After the wars Robinson resumed his post as surveyor-general, but he resigned the position in 1700 on the grounds of infirmity. In that same year he was appointed trustee and overseer of the barracks in Ireland. As an architect Robinson played a major role in developing classicism in Ireland. In his designs for the Royal Hospital, and for the east window of St Mary's Church, Dublin, he introduced baroque features of a very high quality.<br>
<br>Robinson amassed a considerable number of positions. Before the Williamite wars he held the following appointments: keeper of the parliament house (1677), auditor and registrar (1684), attorney and agent (1686) and acting governor from 1697 to 1707 of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, receiver-general of the revenue (from <i>c</i>.1682), and first storekeeper of the port of Dublin (1683). After the Williamite wars he was rewarded with the positions of commissioner for the stating of the accounts of the army in Ireland (1690), commissioner for forfeited estates (1690), commissioner for the debt of the army (1691), held jointly with William Molyneux, and was made a freeman of the Company of the Royal Fishery of Ireland (1692). In 1701 or 1702 he was created a knight (not a baronet, as stated elsewhere). In the latter year he was sworn of the Irish privy council, and became a trustee for the development and preservation of linen manufacture in Ireland. He served as a commissioner for the Vaudois in Ireland. He represented Trinity College in the Irish parliament from 1703 to his death, having been MP for Knocktopher, co. Kilkenny, in 1692&#150;3 and for the borough of Wicklow in 1695&#150;9. Trinity College made him an LLD in 1703.<br>
<br>As deputy receiver he submitted to the Irish parliament in 1703 a national debt of over &pound;100,000, which was taken as a misrepresentation; a motion in the house to expel him was dismissed, but another declaring him unfit for any public employment &#145;in this Kingdom&#146; was accepted on 16 October 1703, and he was ordered to be imprisoned in Dublin Castle during the pleasure of the house. In just over one month the House of Commons ordered his release to allow him to go to England to prepare the account for the Treasury. After 1709 Robinson seems never to have returned to Ireland, although at some time he was reinstated as deputy vice-treasurer, a post which he lost in 1710 in return for a pension of &pound;600. In the same year he became a trustee of the duke of Ormond's estate.<br>
<br>Robinson married in London on 18 January 1677 Margery Tooke, eldest daughter of John Tooke of Hertfordshire, and Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Dacres. The Robinsons left no children. His wife was buried on 7 July 1708 in St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. He died in London on 27 October 1712 and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields four days later.<br>
<br>During his last years Robinson was plagued by individuals who tried to succeed to his estate. During his lifetime he made a total of five wills, dated 1686, 1689, 1701, 1709, and 1712. At his death he was reported to be worth more than &pound;50,000, but he left many legal tangles. His estate included Sherwood Park, co. Carlow, and he had also built a fairly large residence at Islandbridge, near Kilmainham; he was mentioned as having a house at Ormond Key, Dublin in 1702. In England he held the manor of Walton-on-Thames in Surrey, which he had purchased in 1698, and Fleetwood Hall in Lancashire. In London Robinson lived in a house between Albemarle Street and Old Bond Street, the site of which he had purchased in 1710.<br>
