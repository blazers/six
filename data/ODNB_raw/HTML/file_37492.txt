<span class="headword">Grosvenor, Sir  Richard</span>, first baronet  (1585&#150;1645), <span class="occ">magistrate and politician</span>, was born at Eaton Hall, near Chester, Cheshire, on 9 January 1585, the eldest surviving son and the third of seventeen children of Richard Grosvenor, esquire (1562&#150;1619), of Eaton, Cheshire, and his wife, Christian (<i>d</i>. 1610), daughter of Sir Richard Brooke of Norton, Cheshire. He was educated in the puritan household of John Bruen, esquire, of Stapleford in Cheshire, and at Queen's College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 26 October 1599 and graduated BA on 30 June 1602. Meanwhile, he had married in 1600 Lettice, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5345/', "Sir Hugh Cholmondeley")</script> of Cholmondeley, Cheshire. They had one son and three daughters before Lettice's death on 20 January 1612. Two years later, in 1614, he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Thomas Wilbraham of Woodhey, Cheshire, and after her death, he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1627), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28674/', "Sir Peter Warburton")</script> of Grafton, Cheshire. Grosvenor was knighted on 24 August 1617 and made a baronet on 23 February 1622.<br>
<br>Grosvenor made his principal mark in local affairs. He succeeded his father as a JP for Cheshire in 1619 and he served on the bench until his removal, as part of a purge by George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, on 26 October 1626. He was also sheriff of Cheshire in 1623&#150;4 and of Flintshire in 1624&#150;5. Although not one of the foremost Cheshire gentry in terms of wealth or landholdings, Grosvenor became the most influential local governor in the area of his main estate, immediately to the south of Chester. This was because of his industry and his abilities as a man of affairs, and also because of his reputation as a supporter of puritan ministers. William Hinde, who had probably been his tutor at Queen's College, described him as a paragon of the godly gentleman, and another leading Cheshire puritan preacher, Nathaniel Lancaster, hailed him in 1628 as &#145;a father of the country&#146;  (Lancaster, sig. A2).<br>
<br>Grosvenor represented Cheshire in the parliaments of 1621, 1626, and 1628&#150;9. He was not in the front rank of Commons spokesmen, but he was an effective, if rather long-winded, public speaker and a diligent attender of committees. Most of his interventions in parliament were concerned either with the welfare of his Cheshire constituents or with the defence of the Calvinist religion. In 1621 he spoke out against the patentee Sir Giles Mompesson, and the popish threat to the palatinate, and in 1629 he delivered a notable attack on the influence of the king's Arminian advisers. He was also a meticulous parliamentary diarist, providing the fullest known account of debates in 1626, 1628, and 1629.<br>
<br>Grosvenor's third and last wife died on 12 March 1627. Between 1629 and 1638 he was imprisoned in the Fleet, having become liable for the debts of his brother-in-law, Peter Daniel, esquire. Although he was not restored to the bench after his return to the county, he remained an influential figure in local politics. In May 1640 he arbitrated a dispute over the parliamentary election for Chester, and in July 1642 he played a leading role in organizing, and probably also drafting, the Cheshire remonstrance, a petition containing over 8000 signatures, which called on the king and parliament to settle their differences and avoid civil war. During the war Grosvenor remained neutral; he is not to be confused with his eldest son, Richard Grosvenor esq., who played a prominent part in the royalist defence of Chester.<br>
<br>Grosvenor's speeches and writings make it possible to reconstruct his political views in considerable detail. He was a firm believer in the divine right of kingship and in patriarchal authority, but at the same time he staunchly defended the liberties of the subject and of parliament's role as &#145;the representative of the people&#146;. Above all, he was concerned to root out the evil of popery and to overcome the influence of &#145;evil counsellors&#146; close to the king. In many respects he was the archetype of the &#145;patriots&#146; and &#145;public men&#146; who played a crucial political role as spokesmen for their localities and &#145;the country&#146; in the years preceding the civil war. Grosvenor died at Eaton Hall on 14 September 1645 and was buried in Eccleston church, Cheshire.<br>
