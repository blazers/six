<span class="headword">Morse, Sir  Arthur</span>  (1892&#150;1967), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 25 April 1892 in Bohercrowe, co. Tipperary, Ireland, one of the seven children of Digby Scott Morse, a cashier with the Bank of Ireland, and Lizzie Jane Holmes. Educated at Foyle College, Londonderry, Arthur Morse joined the London office of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1912.<br>
<br>Morse's early career was unexceptional. He went to the East with the Hongkong Bank in 1915 and served routinely in Hong Kong, Tientsin (Tianjin), and Shanghai, returning in 1929 to the Hong Kong head office. Morse married Margery May (1893/4&#150;1966), probably in 1923 or 1924; they had no children. From 1929 to 1940 Morse served under the irascible Sir Vandaleur Grayburn, who detected his potential. Indeed, Morse underwent an extraordinary physical and personality metamorphosis; early photographs show a slim, even emaciated figure, but, by the end of the 1930s, he had become a larger man in every sense. &#145;Latterly he used to roar like a bull&#146;, his hearty laugh marking &#145;the Arthur Morse we all knew so well&#146;  (King, <span class="italic">Hongkong Bank</span>, 4.36).<br>
<br>Grayburn determined that any further promotion for Morse in the East was unlikely and in 1940 sent him to London as a supernumerary manager. However, within months one manager died and the second retired. In consequence, just thirty-seven days before Pearl Harbor, Morse became manager and, <i>ex officio</i>, chairman of the bank's London consultative committee. Before Hong Kong surrendered on 25 December 1941, the bank had secured promise of an order in council making London the head office and the consultative committee the effective board of directors. Authorized to act on this promise, Morse was now in virtually total control.<br>
<br>Despite the loss of the East, the Hongkong Bank was in a surprisingly sound position. Morse was able to build on the bank's sterling reserves, even while meeting the extraordinary expenses of wartime. He had been treasurer of the University of Hong Kong, and he cared for escaped bank and Hong Kong University staff and for families with members in internment; he reconstituted the books with smuggled documents and kept contact with Free China through the establishment of the Chongqing office. For his management of the Far Eastern Relief Fund and related problems he was created a CBE in 1944.<br>
<br>As for the future, Morse acted on his conviction, not universally shared, that the Hongkong Bank's head office would return to a British Hong Kong. He promised that any rational request for finance for Hong Kong would be forthcoming; he guaranteed funds for heavy equipment, on occasion committing a company whose senior officials were interned. Such decisions placed the colony at the head of the queue during post-war shortages. Although impatient with officialdom, Morse put &pound;5 million at the disposal of the Hong Kong planning unit without government guarantee. Japan surrendered unexpectedly; consequently destruction was not as disastrous as anticipated, and Morse rushed his officers east to finance the reconstruction, while he himself remained in London; there were war-created problems to resolve, including the reception and rehabilitation of interned staff.<br>
<br>Morse returned to Hong Kong in 1946 and served on the colony's executive council. He was the leader in some twenty-two organizations covering a broad range of economic, sporting, and charitable affairs. Morse exuded confidence and was a &#145;presence&#146;; but he was also shrewd and secretive. He had the instincts of an accountant, the inspiration of a statesman. Tough negotiations relative to legislation designed to regularize his bank's &#145;duress note issue&#146;, that is, banknotes issued during the Japanese occupation without appropriate backing, for example, led the Treasury's Norman Young to insist the governor be &#145;peremptorily&#146; ordered to &#145;tell [Morse] where he got off&#146;  (King, <span class="italic">Hongkong Bank</span>, 4.240). In the event, cooler counsels prevailed. As a senior colleague noted, &#145;Morse knew little about technical banking, but banking is both an art and a science, and in the former he excelled&#146;  (ibid., 37).<br>
<br>Morse's knighthood in 1949 was interim recognition. His decisive actions had re-established his bank as the colony's <i>de facto</i> central bank and, through loans to established customers and innovative accounts and other payment devices, had facilitated the restoration of Hong Kong as a trading entrep&ocirc;t. Confidence would be restored following the conclusion of China's civil war, and by the end of 1952 the bank's total assets of HK $3.5 million were approximately three times the total at the end of 1940. In 1953 Morse retired triumphantly from the East.<br>
<br>In London, Morse became, as had a predecessor, Sir Thomas Jackson (1841&#150;1915), &#145;permanent&#146; chairman of a reorganized consultative committee. He maintained a correspondence with Sir Michael Turner, the new chief executive in Hong Kong, and was a key negotiator in the 1959&#150;60 acquisitions of the Mercantile Bank (of India) and of the British Bank of the Middle East, on whose boards he subsequently served until 1965. He was chairman of Bowmakers, 1954&#150;62, and in 1958 served as president of the Finance Houses Association. Concurrently, as the unsalaried chairman of the British Travel and Holiday Association, 1954&#150;60, Morse made two promotional tours of North America. Not only did he prove a successful advocate of Britain as a tourist destination, he was also active in encouraging the very necessary improvement of tourist facilities. He was created KBE in 1961.<br>
<br>With the change of the Hongkong Bank's chief executive in 1962 and the death in 1966 of his wife, who was acknowledged to have been a major supportive influence in his life, Morse's active career faded. He retired to his garden flat at 26 St James's Place, overlooking Green Park, London. Morse died there on 13 May 1967.<br>
<br>As chief executive and chairman of the Hongkong Bank from 1941 to 1953, Morse was one of the two principal architects (with the governor, Sir Alexander Grantham) of Hong Kong's post-war recovery. After his return to London in 1953 he was instrumental in effecting the rationalization of British overseas banking and the promotion of British tourism.<br>
