</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boydell,  John</span>  (1720&#150;1804), <span class="occ">engraver and printseller</span>, the eldest of the seven children of Josiah Boydell (1691&#150;1757?), surveyor and land steward, and his wife, Mary (1693/4&#150;1777), was born at Dorrington in Shropshire on 19 January 1720. Like other men of his day he was disinclined to lose a year of his life to the change in calendar, and so always gave the year of his birth in old style, as 1719.<h2>
<a name="Youthandtraining17201750"></a>Youth and training, 1720&#150;1750</h2>As a child Boydell spent much time with his grandfather John (<i>d</i>. 1731), who was vicar of Ashbourne and rector of Mapleton, Derbyshire, and who instilled in him by the age of eight an enduring respect for moral rectitude. When he was twelve he moved with his family to Hawarden, Flintshire, where his father was land steward to Sir John Glynne. In 1739 he went to London to work for a Mr Cradock, before a place was found for him as house steward to John Lawton, MP for Newcastle under Lyme. Lawton refused Boydell's demand for a wage of 12 guineas per annum, and Boydell considered emigrating to the East Indies, but instead he walked back to Wales and his sweetheart Elizabeth, the daughter of Edward Lloyd, of the Fords, near Oswestry. Suddenly, he discovered his vocation:<blockquote>A large Print of Hawarden Castle and the Country adjacent drawn by Mr. Badeslade and engraved by Wm. Harry Toms in London was just finished. I admired it to a great degree, finding it was an employment that many have got a livelihood by&#151;I thought I should like to Follow the art of Engraving. My Friends enquired of Mr. Badeslade relating to my wishes, wrote to Mr. Toms who offered to take me on trial. (&#145;Autobiography&#146;, 82&#150;3)</blockquote>In 1741, at the advanced age of twenty, Boydell was bound apprentice to Toms for a &pound;50 premium. Elizabeth promised to wait for him.<br>
<br>For the next six years Boydell lived with Toms in Union Court, Holborn. At first he copied prints after Claude and Poussin. He was advised to draw at the St Martin's Lane Academy and attended there five nights a week. His master was &#145;subject to be in Liquor, and very Outrageous and at such times striking his Servants and beating the wainscott with his fist&#146;  (&#145;Autobiography&#146;, 85). But, to Boydell, Toms was &#145;very civil&#146; and &#145;us'd to call me Mr Boydell&#151;althou' an Apprentice&#146;  (ibid.). Boydell had little time for his colleagues in Toms's studio. Louis-Philippe Boitard, he recalled, &#145;lost much time in taking snuff&#146;, while Jean Baptiste Chatelain, who was paid by the hour, &#145;would often come for half an hour receive sixpence go and spend it amongst bad women in Chick Lane and Black-boy Alley&#146;  (ibid., 83). Boydell himself would have made the perfect model for Hogarth's industrious apprentice. In 1746 he engraved a large plate of Penzance and paid Toms a further &pound;30 to release him from his final year's service. After two years as a journeyman, lodging with a stationer called Wroughton, he considered himself able to support a wife, and in 1748 he went back to Wales to marry Elizabeth Lloyd. He took with him four drawings by Gainsborough and four copperplates and, having engraved these, spent his honeymoon summer drawing views of Snowdonia, the Welsh castles, and the High Peak for later publication. Four views near Ipswich after Gainsborough and a view of Wrexham church were published in December 1748. His initial method of selling his prints was to:<blockquote>carry them in the Morning my self in a Portfolio to all the Print Shops in the City. In the afternoon to all in the West End of Town, brought what I received and always gave it to my Wife to take care of. (ibid., 86)</blockquote>He worked hard. During 1750 he published twenty-eight landscapes.<h2>
<a name="Foundationsofthebusiness17501770"></a>Foundations of the business, 1750&#150;1770</h2>By 1751, having amassed a total capital of &pound;150, Boydell took the bold decision to purchase the freedom of the City in the Stationers' Company and take a shop, with the sign of the Unicorn, at the corner of Queen Street in Cheapside. In old age he told Joseph Farington that &#145;his wife was alarmed at the boldness of this determination &amp; wept at the danger of incurring such expence&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1415). Within a year he took two apprentices: his brother Thomas paid no fee, but Richard Ford, son of an art auctioneer, brought both &pound;40 and, in his father, a valuable ally. Boydell realized quickly that the main demand both from collectors and for decoration was for foreign prints, so he determined to equip himself to deal internationally. He taught himself French, with a grammar, a dictionary, and <span class="italic">Les aventures de T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</span>, and by attending a foreign chapel at St James. By degrees he accustomed himself &#145;to speak and write the Language which enabled me to Correspond with Foreigners&#151;which was of great service to me&#146;  (&#145;Autobiography&#146;, 84). In particular he got to know the leading Parisian printseller Pierre-Fran&ccedil;ois Basan.<br>
<br>During the next few years Boydell's business strategy took shape. He was an active committee man, taking livery in the Stationers' Company on 2 April 1754 and becoming common councillor for the ward of Cheap in 1758. In January 1756 he was selected to retail prints published by the Society of Antiquaries for a 20 per cent commission. Meanwhile he expanded his stock of plates by buying others secondhand. Joseph Goupy's plates comprised one of his first major acquisitions, in 1755, and he bought Picart's <span class="italic">Impostures Innocentes</span> in 1756. It was only now that he began speculative publishing. Boydell joined the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce in 1760 and immediately undertook publication of the paintings that won its major prizes. He had commissioned a young landscape specialist, William Woollett, to engrave a Claude in 1760. Now he commissioned Woollett to engrave two paintings by Richard Wilson and two by the brothers Smith of Chichester; he also commissioned Fran&ccedil;ois Ravenet to engrave the prizewinning history painting. This venture proved highly profitable. Woollett's <span class="italic">Niobe</span>, in particular, drew great critical accolades and sold very well abroad, helping Boydell to pay for his imports in kind rather than in cash. Boydell then launched a major initiative billed as <span class="italic">A Collection of Prints, Engraved from the most Capital Paintings in England</span>. The original proposal was for seven numbers at a guinea per number. A subscription for 251 copies was headed by the king, the princess dowager, and the earl of Bute. Boydell himself engraved several prints for the collection, but he was wise enough to realize that he himself would never be more than a pedestrian engraver. His claim for this enterprise was that it would give talented young English engravers an opportunity to try their hand at engraving history pictures, and, although he gave some of the most important engravings to experienced expatriates such as Fran&ccedil;ois Ravenet, this major enterprise did help to establish several promising artists [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65008/', "Boydell, John, engravers")</script>]. The prints also sold very well abroad: even among subscribers almost a third were foreigners. Boydell presented the first complete volume to the king in 1769.<h2>
<a name="Thegreatmerchantprintseller17701790"></a>The great merchant printseller, 1770&#150;1790</h2>As Boydell's <span class="italic">Collection</span> took shape he moved to a larger house at 90 Cheapside. A second volume was completed in 1772. Into this some English paintings by William Hogarth, Benjamin West, and Nathaniel Dance were introduced. A third volume, compiled in 1773, consisted entirely of republished prints from celebrated plates that Boydell had acquired secondhand. He added two more volumes before 1786. The <span class="italic">Collection</span> was the backbone of Boydell's empire, but he substantiated his position as the publisher of the finest works of art in Britain with two further projects. In 1775 he announced plans to engrave the Walpole collection at Houghton Hall, Norfolk, before it was sold to Catherine the Great of Russia and to publish the duke of Devonshire's book of designs by Claude. In addition he published a number of fine mezzotints of paintings by Rembrandt.<br>
<br>When it came to publishing contemporary paintings Boydell was only one of several notable figures, but he was nevertheless responsible for the publication of some of the most impressive paintings of the period. He was the publisher of Joseph Wright of Derby's <span class="italic">Orrery</span> (1768), <span class="italic">Air Pump</span> (1769), <span class="italic">Blacksmith's Shop</span> (1771), and <span class="italic">Iron Forge</span> (1773), which are among the finest mezzotints ever engraved. He published Reynolds's celebrated history painting <span class="italic">Ugolino</span> (1774) and several paintings by the court favourites Dance, Johann Zoffany, and West. He cemented his place in royal favour with huge mezzotints of the king's paintings <span class="italic">Regulus's Return to Carthage</span> (1771) and <span class="italic">Hannibal Swearing Enmity to the Romans</span> (1773), by West. Boydell owned only a third share with Woollett and Ryland in West's <span class="italic">Death of Wolfe</span> (1775), but this proved to be an enormously successful plate, and after the untimely deaths of Ryland and Woollett he acquired the whole copyright. Now Boydell began to work on a munificent scale. In 1779 he bought from West <span class="italic">Alfred the Great Dividing his Loaf with the Pilgrim</span> and presented it to the Stationers' Company, turning his generosity to account through an engraving of it by Sharp. In 1784 Boydell paid Copley &pound;800 for <span class="italic">The Death of Major Peirson</span>. He acquired Hogarth's plates in 1786.<br>
<br>Boydell's shop, with its grand second-floor showroom (10 ft &times; 70 ft) lit from above, with pictures displayed on hinged screens, became a tourist attraction. In the inner gallery he displayed paintings that he had bought and published together with the portraits of artists who had painted and engraved them for him. Over the chimney was <span class="italic">The Death of Major Peirson</span>.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Boydell's career in public office continued. Apart from a brief interruption in 1771, he was common councillor for Cheap until 1782, in which year he became an alderman. He was commonly thereafter referred to as Alderman Boydell. He served as sheriff in 1785, as master of the Stationers' Company in 1783&#150;4, and as steward of the Marine Society in 1785. He was closely associated with the Royal Academy and a regular guest at their dinners, and he made not infrequent visits to court. Elizabeth Boydell died on 27 January 1781 and was buried at St Martin Pomeroy on 4 February 1781. Thereafter, Boydell's household was run by his niece Mary. He took her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3121/', "Josiah Boydell")</script> into partnership in 1786.<br>
<br>At a dinner at Josiah Boydell's house in West End, Hampstead, in November 1786 Boydell eagerly embraced a proposal that he might publish a series of prints illustrating the works of Shakespeare. The project rapidly took shape, and proposals dated 1 December 1786 were published in the press. The Boydells and the bookseller George Nicol proposed the works of Shakespeare edited by George Steevens, with typography by Bulmer and paper by Whatman. These would be embellished with one series of large and another series of small prints, all taken from specially commissioned paintings by artists led by Joshua Reynolds and Angelica Kaufmann and engravers led by Caroline Watson and Francesco Bartolozzi. The alliance between the Boydells and Nicol was cemented when Mary married the bookseller on 8 September 1787. A rejected suitor, an apothecary named Elliot, was so desperate that he attempted to shoot her from close range but, &#145;Providentially, though they were so close as to set fire to the lady's cloack, yet by the balls glancing on her stays, she received only a slight contusion under the shoulder&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Mercury</span>, 1787, 152). In September the newly-weds went with John Boydell to Paris, where they dined with Boydell's principal correspondent, Basan.<br>
<br>To house the Shakespeare paintings a new gallery was built in Pall Mall. Reynolds was given an advance of &pound;500 to secure his first contribution, but the Boydells immediately fell out with Gainsborough, who wanted equal pay, and soon after with Wright of Derby, whose <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> they then rejected. The fact was that they could not, or would not, afford to pay the best artists enough to secure their services. The problem was even more acute with engravers. To engrave large prints in line took a very long time, and the best engravers already had their hands full with work of their own. Josiah Boydell, who had the management of the project, chose to have most of the prints engraved in stipple&#151;chiefly, perhaps, for the sake of speed&#151;and many were given to inexperienced young artists, who nevertheless had to be paid 300 guineas a plate. The gallery opened in May 1789 with thirty-four paintings by eighteen artists on show: 20,000 people visited, 6600 catalogues were sold, and 100 names were added to the subscription. The last figure might have been disappointing but, with Boydell's more ambitious projects, success or failure rested on sales abroad. At home his triumph was complete. He was chosen as lord mayor for 1790&#150;91 and his niece Mary acted as his mayoress.<h2>
<a name="Declineanddeath17901804"></a>Decline and death, 1790&#150;1804</h2>When the first &#145;Shakspeare&#146; prints (Boydell used the contracted form of the name) came out in 1792 they were not well received. The grandiloquent claims that had been made for the project as a forum for British history painting now rebounded on the publishers. The painters blamed the engravers. West told Farington that &#145;He had looked over the Shakespere Prints and was sorry to see them of such inferior quality&#146;. He complained of a &#145;general defficiency in respect of drawing&#146; and &#145;did not wonder many subscribers had declined to continue their subscriptions&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2331). Others were more critical of the paintings, few of which showed much flair. The engraver William Byrne blamed the publishers, telling Farington that:<blockquote>J. Boydell had ruined publications by his manner of managing the Shakespeare work, which had been sacrificed to a narrow economy; That the subscriptions to it had fallen off near two thirds. Alderman Boydell is excused, the blame is imputed to J. Boydell. (ibid., 631)</blockquote>Well into his seventies, the alderman seemed undaunted by this set-back, though he admitted to Farington that these days:<blockquote>if He rises at 5 in the morning He is obliged to lay on a couch for an Hour in the course of the day.&#151;He said He had always been an early riser and a moderate eater. He said he drank milk in the morning, which agreed with him &amp; he thought did him more service than anything. (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 209)</blockquote>About 1794 he presented the corporation of London with twenty-four paintings, most of which had been commissioned for publication and had been hanging in 90 Cheapside. But perhaps even he was feeling the strain of his business difficulties. The problems with Shakespeare were dwarfed by the disastrous effect on the European trade in luxury goods of the French invasions of the Netherlands and the Rhineland. By 1797 it was clear that the Boydells were in trouble. By November 1803 they were in debt to the tune of &pound;41,000 and had to stop payments. Their bank had loaned &pound;12,000 with the houses in Pall Mall and Cheapside as security, but there were worries about bankruptcy. They had applied to parliament for leave to conduct a lottery to raise money by disposing of the Shakspeare Gallery and its contents. Josiah Boydell hoped the lottery would raise &pound;80,000 (and it did raise &pound;78,000), but before it could be drawn the great alderman was dead.<br>
<br>Josiah Boydell told Farington that his uncle had caught a cold by going to the Old Bailey to do his duty as an alderman on a damp, foggy day; he died, presumably at his house in Cheapside, on 12 December 1804. Farington noted that he was opened after his death and all the material parts were in so good a state that it was thought he might have lived ten years longer had this accidental complaint not attacked him. He was buried at St Olave Jewry on 19 December 1804. Some time later, his niece Mary Nicol bequeathed money to pay for a bust and memorial tablet to be placed in the church.<br>
<br>In his public pronouncements Boydell tended to suggest that he had created an export business in British prints single-handedly and that his Shakspeare Gallery provided the first opportunity for British history painters. This was a great exaggeration. John Landseer was not afraid to assert that fine engravers such as Strange, Ryland, and Woollett had done more for the reputation of British engraving than Boydell, and other publishers had helped to ensure that contemporary British art was widely respected long before the Shakspeare Gallery was projected. Nevertheless, Boydell was the most important single print publisher during the period in which British art rose to European prominence. Moreover, his shrewd selection of paintings for publication and of fine young engravers to interpret them produced, especially in the 1760s and 1770s, some of the most distinguished (and profitable) copperplates to be crafted in Britain. No print publisher before or since has ever exerted as much influence on the course of British art.<br>
