<span class="headword">Ware,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1420), <span class="occ">administrator and bishop of Chichester</span>, was from Wales, almost certainly from Glamorgan, where he had his earliest preferment (as a canon of Llandaff by May 1394 and as rector of Marcross by 1398) and other personal contacts. Even in his will he asked for an &#145;old bible&#146; to be returned to Margam Abbey, and left vestments to St Buruoc's, Barry. He referred there also to a brother and &#145;poor kinsfolk&#146;, and to his sister, Margaret, who married one John Hayward; the latter may be the man of that name who, like Ware, sought patronage from Lady Despenser, a leading influence in south Wales. Despite this apparent relative lack of advantage in life, Ware was an MA of Oxford by 1399, in fact necessarily some while before, because he was a licentiate in both laws by late 1401; he never took a doctorate.<br>
<br>Ware's career was twofold. He was a notary public by 30 July 1398 and still on 28 February 1402, when witnessing an <i>actum</i> by Archbishop Arundel at Lambeth. In June 1402 he received preferment from the archbishop, for whom he was evidently working by now, being identified as the scribe of his <i>acta</i> in 1405, and was soon sitting over legal disputes in the diocese on Arundel's behalf. By July 1408 he was official of the court of Canterbury, and announced on behalf of a committee of the Canterbury convocation that the English church would promote the ending of the papal schism more urgently. He was still official on 25 September 1413 when he was on the tribunal which would try the heretic Sir John Oldcastle, was retained during the vacancy in the see in 1414, and was still in office under Archbishop Chichele in November 1415 and February 1416. From 20 August 1414 Bishop Philip Repyndon appointed him to supervise probate of all wills in the Lincoln diocese and used him in a heresy case in May 1415 and to confirm a hospital election in August 1416.<br>
<br>Meanwhile he had been included in embassies to France as early as 2 February&#150;2 May 1400 and 11 July&#150;2 October 1401, but this sort of work did not continue. From 3 November 1407, however, he was appointed several times to hear appeals from the court of admiralty or military courts. On 1 July 1412 he was living in the parish of St James Garlickhythe in London, and on 20 December 1413 he was exempted from the king's order to Welsh people to go home. On 10 and 28 November 1414 he was appointed to the crucial, large-scale embassy to France, no doubt in some expert capacity, and served on this from 2 February to 2 May. From 11 July to 2 October 1414 he was in France again to develop aspects of these ultimately fruitless peace talks. On 24 July 1415 he was appointed an executor of Henry V's will.<br>
<br>On 11 September 1416 Ware became keeper of the privy seal, a prominent example of Henry V's use of Canterbury men to staff his embryonic parallel administrations in England and France. He was something of a surprise choice, his not being among the names that had been bandied around, but the author of the <span class="italic">Gesta Henrici quinti</span> thought the king had done well to identify &#145;a man held in high respect&#146; and &#145;of considerable repute&#146; in the court of Canterbury  (p. 159). Among all the many customary duties Ware received the oaths of John, duke of Burgundy, and his son, Philip, before their interview with Henry V on 2 October 1416; was a delegate from the council to the convocation of Canterbury to seek a subsidy on 18 November 1416; and was appointed to treat for peace with France on 12 March 1417 and for truces with Burgundy on 24 April and 23 July that year, proroguing this truce on 5 December. Some reversion to his original trade came with his service, unheard of by such a high officer of state, as vicar-general for Bishop Richard Clifford in the London diocese between 17 November 1417 and late April 1418; the administration had become badly unhorsed during the bishop's unpredictably delayed return from the continent and perhaps Ware, as the most experienced administrator in the southern province, felt obliged to seize the reins. Likewise he had found time to help arbitrate a dispute between the bishop and cathedral of Ely.<br>
<br>Ware had always been unusually underendowed with preferment and held no dignities at all. The crown had given him just the rectory of Tring, Hertfordshire, on 14 May 1414. On 28 February 1418 royal consent was given to his election to the see of Chichester, to which he was papally provided on 6 April. Even this was only moderate reward for a keeper of the privy seal. He secured the temporalities on 13 May, and was consecrated at Pont de l'Arche in Normandy on 17 July. His episcopal register has not survived, but it is known that John Blunham, precentor of the cathedral, was his vicar-general during his absences. The bishop had been preparing since 12 April 1418 to go abroad, being appointed to supervise the muster of various retinues on 16 April, a familiar role for any senior administrator treading the same path. Thus he joined the royal expedition in Normandy, being appointed to array retinues before Louviers on 9 June and to serve in the major embassy under Chichele and the earls of Warwick and Salisbury to treat with the dauphin on 26 October. He had resigned the privy seal on 21 September, presumably because he would be preoccupied in France. Ware was appointed to join in further important talks on 22 January (at Vienne) and 8 March 1419, and to muster the duke of Clarence's force on the 27th. He evidently returned to England shortly afterwards. He attended convocation in October, and he is known to have been in Chichester on 10 December 1419. However, apart from being appointed on 13 April 1420 to supervise the muster of the duke of Bedford's force before it left, he had undertaken no more formal business for either the crown or the Canterbury province since his return to England. It is likely that such an abrupt retirement at this time of intense royal administrative activity denotes a failure of health. He made his will on 7 July 1420 as a very sick man, and had died, probably in England, by the 23rd. He was buried, as requested, in the cathedral.<br>
