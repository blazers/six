<span class="headword">Herdman,  William Gawin</span>  (1805&#150;1882), <span class="occ">landscape painter and writer</span>, was born on 13 March 1805 at Liverpool (probably in Stanley Street), where his father was a corn merchant. He was active in the Liverpool Academy, being admitted as a student in 1824 and serving as secretary from 1845 to 1848, but in December 1857 he was expelled, nominally for protesting against the academy's award of its annual prize to J. E. Millais for his painting <span class="italic">The Blind Girl</span>. He continued to oppose Pre-Raphaelitism through letters to the press in Liverpool and London, and helped to start a rival establishment to the Liverpool Academy, the short-lived Liverpool Society of Fine Arts. In 1859 he was involved in setting up the country's first shilling art union in Liverpool, as an alternative to the more exclusive art unions with guinea subscriptions. He was an art teacher for many years in his native town.<br>
<br>Herdman exhibited several landscapes in London at the Royal Academy and the Suffolk Street Gallery between 1834 and 1861, and numerous works at the Liverpool Academy from 1822, chiefly landscapes and views of architectural subjects in various parts of the British Isles and northern Europe. Most of his known works are watercolours; his oils are relatively rare. His outstanding achievement was as a topographical artist, recording the changing streets of his native town and copying earlier pictures of its vanished buildings. He began producing such works at the age of about thirteen and published them in the form of lithographs as <span class="italic">Pictorial Relics of Ancient Liverpool</span> in 1843 and 1856; two further volumes appeared in 1878. Many of these watercolours are now in the Central Library, Liverpool, some having been transferred there from the Walker Art Gallery in the same city. He also published a selection of continental views under the title <span class="italic">Studies from the Folio of William Herdman</span> (1838), and <span class="italic">Views of Fleetwood-on-Wyre</span> (1838), and wrote on such diverse subjects as perspective, cosmology, and skating, as well as composing hymns and poetry.<br>
<br>Herdman was married to Elizabeth Darley Innes, and they had eleven sons and five daughters. Four sons&#151;William, W. Patrick, J. Innes, and Stanley&#151;worked as topographical artists and assisted their father with some of his publications. The younger William published a volume <span class="italic">Views of Modern Liverpool</span> in 1864. Herdman died at 41 St Domingo Vale, Everton, Liverpool, on 29 March 1882 and was buried on 3 April in Anfield cemetery, Liverpool.<br>
