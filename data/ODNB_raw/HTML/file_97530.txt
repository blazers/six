<span class="headword">Boston,  Richard</span>  (1938&#150;2006), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born on 29 December 1938 at Stonefield nursing home, Blackheath, London, the elder son of Frank Boston (<i>b</i>. 1903), a dairy farmer of Shernden, Edenbridge, Kent, then serving as an engineer officer in the RAF, and his wife, Janet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vessey (<i>b</i>. 1904). He was educated at Stowe School and spent a year studying art at the Regent Street Polytechnic in London before going to King's College, Cambridge, where he read English. He went to Sweden in 1963&#150;4, once running in a marathon there. He spent 1964&#150;5 in Paris, living in a garret high above the Gare du Nord. He taught English, wrote occasional feature articles, and appeared in Jacques Tati's film <span class="italic">Playtime</span>. After returning to Britain he moved into a flat in Covent Garden and worked for <span class="italic">Peace News</span>, later claiming that MI5 had compiled a file on him. He then worked at the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, where he was a sub-editor and took great pleasure in headlines such as one he wrote for a review of a book on Pearl Harbor, which read &#145;Nasty nip in the air&#146;. He became books editor of <span class="italic">New Society</span> magazine, and edited a critical volume on the British newspapers, <span class="italic">The Press We Deserve</span> (1970). On 27 January 1968, he married (Elizabeth) Anne Caulkin (<i>b</i>. 1945), then a secretary but later (as Anne Boston) a journalist and author, daughter of Lieutenant David Howard Caulkin, army officer. There were no children of the marriage, which was dissolved in 1976, though they remained close friends.<br>
<br>After returning from a convivial spell living in a former hunting lodge in the Sologne region of France Boston signed a contract in 1972 as a features writer for <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, a relationship that would last for nearly all the rest of his life and took a number of forms. He became celebrated for championing &#145;real ale&#146; and attacking the big brewers in a weekly column, &#145;Boston on beer&#146;, which he began in 1973, shortly after the founding of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA). Though he always said he preferred a pink gin to a pint of beer, the column became a great success with readers, and won a Glenfiddich award for food and drink writing as well as providing material for a book, <span class="italic">Beer and Skittles</span> (1976). When <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> launched its Saturday supplement Boston appeared on the cover of the first issue, naked in a deck chair and with a portable typewriter strategically placed in his lap, to illustrate an article about a nudist colony in the south of France. The article was entitled &#145;Starkness at noon&#146;, which later became the title of a collection of his pieces (1997). A similar pun had given him the title for another book bringing together his best articles, <span class="italic">Baldness be my Friend</span> (1977).<br>
<br>Though he listed procrastination as a recreation in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> (in another reference book he chose &#145;soothsaying, shelling peas and embroidery&#146;), Boston was always pursuing new avenues. In 1974 he published the first book he had written rather than edited, <span class="italic">An Anatomy of Laughter</span>, a fluent, characteristically wry, but also extremely erudite account of the subject ranging from the Marx brothers to Henri Bergson. He wrote or edited a dozen more books on subjects ranging from the first English translator of Rabelais, Sir Thomas Urquhart (<span class="italic">The Admirable Urquhart</span>, 1975) to a British Film Institute monograph on the classic French film <span class="italic">Boudu sauv&eacute; des eaux</span> (1994). His fondness for practical jokes led to a book recounting the tomfoolery of an invented character whom he named C. O. Jones (<i>cojones</i>), <span class="italic">The C. O. Jones Compendium of Practical Jokes</span> (1982, with illustrations by Posy Simmonds). When the book was published a BBC interviewer asked him on air if practical jokes were possible on radio. Boston replied by saying nothing and, after an interval, everybody in the studio began to giggle. Apart from his regular writing for <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> Boston contributed to a wide range of publications, mainly on literary or country matters, though he also did a spell as restaurant critic for the newspaper. Towards the end of his life he was working on a book about C&eacute;zanne and Zola.<br>
<br>In 1977 Boston founded the environmental magazine <span class="italic">Vole</span>, working out of a cramped basement room in his accountant's office beside Regent's Park. Though it was in constant financial straits and closed in 1980 the magazine was ahead of its time and was home to a fine collection of writers and illustrators. He also edited the literary journal <span class="italic">Quarto</span> from 1979 to 1982. He used his wit to full effect as a presenter of the television press review programme <span class="italic">What the Papers Say</span>, and as a panellist on such radio programmes as <span class="italic">The News Quiz</span>. He also maintained his artistic interests with sketches and watercolours, and on one occasion presented the newly appointed editor of <span class="italic">The Observer</span> with a tie he had decorated with vivid variants of the newspaper's masthead and a quiz question on the back.<br>
<br>After living in Islington during his first marriage Boston rented a cottage in the Berkshire village of Aldworth from the cartoonist and designer Osbert Lancaster, the subject of a biography he published in 1989 (<span class="italic">Osbert: a Portrait of Osbert Lancaster</span>). He then bought the converted village schoolhouse that was his home for the rest of his life, becoming an integral part of Aldworth life, often seen sitting outside the nearby pub on summer evenings, munching on pork scratchings and drinking something other than beer. In the European parliament election of 1994 he formed the Boston Tea Party and ran for the local constituency on the slogan &#145;It's a big trough and I want to get my nose in it&#146;. He received only 1018 votes, but wrote a high-spirited account of his campaign for <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>. His politics remained rooted in anarchism, usually coloured by his contrary spirit, which rebelled against any form of authority. His companion for the last twenty-three years of his life was Marie-Claude Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Chapuis, a tour guide thirteen years his junior, and daughter of Marcel Chapuis, commercial traveller. Together they spent winters at her family home outside Aix-en-Provence where Boston pursued his research into C&eacute;zanne. They married on 7 December 2004. Boston died in the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on 22 December 2006, of bronchopneumonia following a haemorrhagic stroke. He was survived by Marie-Claude, and by Anne Boston.<br>
