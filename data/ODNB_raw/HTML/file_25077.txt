<span class="headword">Sempill, Sir  William</span>  (1546&#150;1633), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was probably the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25074/', "Robert Sempill, third Lord Sempill (c.1505&#150;1573x6)")</script>, nobleman. He spent most of his adult life in exile in Spain. Much of the information about his career comes from memorials that he gave to the Spanish government which deliberately shrouded or exaggerated his activities. Even his relationship to the Sempill family is unclear. He was certainly the uncle of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25072/', "Hugh Sempill (1596&#150;1654)")</script>, the mathematician. Sempill may have been brought up in his father's native county, Renfrewshire.<br>
<br>Sempill began his career in the household of Mary, queen of Scots, and after her flight to England in 1568 offered his services to the Spanish government, apparently at her insistence. By 1573 he was well known in Spanish military circles but his petitions for military command probably met with rejection. He was an infantry captain fighting against Spain in the Low Countries by the early 1580s. On 25 March 1582 he took command of a Scottish company in Lier, a small but strategically important town between Antwerp and Brussels. He may have already decided to betray the Dutch when he took the commission. He was given a secret audience by Alexander Farnese, governor of the Low Countries, shortly before he did so. On the night of 1 August he joined Farnese's troops and led them into the town. With the element of surprise, it was quickly taken. Farnese rewarded Sempill with a grant of 1000 ducats and a gold chain. The capture of Lier was a small but significant step in the preparation for Farnese's brilliant successes in 1583&#150;5, since it drove a wedge between Antwerp and Brussels.<br>
<br>Sempill was sent to Spain by Farnese in 1582 with a strong recommendation to the government. In Madrid he busied himself as an adviser on British and Dutch affairs, beginning a torrent of memorials advising the government on how to conduct its wars in the north. In 1587 he argued against sending the Armada, urging Philip II to wage economic warfare rather than take the risks involved in sending his great fleet. The king would not change his mind but recognized the force of Sempill's personality and decided to send him to Scotland to secure the neutrality or support of James VI.<br>
<br>Philip sent Sempill to the redoubtable Bernardino de Mendoza, ambassador in Paris and formerly ambassador in London, describing him as one of &#145;my Scottish servants&#146; but warning that he needed to be closely supervised (Philip II to B. de Mendoza, 27 Nov 1587; <span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, 1587&#150;1603, no. 175, p. 171). Philip's senior adviser on foreign affairs, Juan de Idi&aacute;quez, confidently described Sempill as &#145;a man who may be trusted&#146;  (ibid., no. 194, p. 188). Sempill arrived in Paris at the beginning of December 1587 and impressed the ambassador with his &#145;zeal and steadfastness&#146;  (ibid., no. 259, p. 255). Mendoza sent him on to the Low Countries, where Farnese, now duke of Parma, recognized that Sempill could usefully serve a number of purposes. Most immediately he could provide an assessment of the numbers and strength of the Scottish Catholics. Parma hoped that, as a former servant of Mary, Sempill would be listened to when he urged the king to seek vengeance for his mother's blood. Parma also allowed himself to hope that Sempill would be able to raise a force of Catholic Scots to provide a diversion on the Anglo-Scottish frontier as he himself crossed the channel. Philip had the same expectation.<br>
<br>Sempill sailed from Dunkirk with Archibald Douglas, eighth earl of Angus and fifth earl of Morton, on 16 April 1588. They landed at Leith four days later. Sempill soon found that James was much more committed to the presbyterians than he had believed and that there was no hope of winning him to the Spanish side. His activities were watched carefully by both Scottish and English governments and he was arrested. He was released, apparently through the intercession of Catholic friends, but was almost immediately rearrested and placed under house arrest in Edinburgh. Parma received reports that he had been executed. Perhaps his presence was an embarrassment to James; at all events, Sempill once again escaped with suspicious ease. He made an attempt to meet the Armada as it sailed north&#151;the only man, apparently, who voluntarily tried to board it as it headed off on its dreadful journey round the British Isles. Unsuccessful, he made his way back to the Low Countries, where he informed Parma that he had been waiting with a force of 2000 men in a suitable port for the Armada to arrive. No confirmation of this claim exists and it was probably significant that Parma refused to give Sempill further funding for his Scottish adventures.<br>
<br>Parma once again dispatched Sempill to Spain, where he settled down on the south coast, advising government officers on how to uncover the contraband activities of northern seamen in Andalusian ports. In 1593 he married Mar&iacute;a (<i>d</i>. 1646), daughter of Juan de Ledesma and his wife. The Ledesmas were an important family in the Spanish administration. Juan de Ledesma worked in the secretarial offices of the council of inquisition. The family had a reputation for bending the rules where profit was to be made and Sempill's marriage gave him good access to governmental circles. In 1597 he travelled to Madrid, where he urged the government to investigate rigorously the English, Irish, and French protestant captains who were trading in Spain under the guise of being Catholics, recommending that a few death penalties would bring a rapid end to such activities. The council of state acknowledged the seriousness of the problem and issued the first licences to search all English ships in order to find protestants trading as Catholics. Sempill himself was given authority to search ships along the entire southern coast and was assigned a salary, although he does not seem to have been given a formal position. A number of arrests were made on his authority.<br>
<br>In 1598 Sempill's stock rose still further at court when his cousin Robert Sempill, fourth Lord Sempill, was appointed as James's ambassador in Madrid. The two men worked closely together. Sempill's work also brought him into contact with the agents of the duke of Lerma, favourite of Philip III from his accession in 1598, and the owner of lucrative trading concessions on the southern coast. Sempill had access now to the very highest circles of government. In deciding whom to investigate and whom to arrest, he also had the right to decide which captains should go free, and he seems to have discreetly helped some of his compatriots. Perhaps here he was seeking favour with James, who was now all but certain to become the next king of England. If so, Sempill was playing both sides, for in June 1601 he strongly urged Philip III and the council of state to prevent James from winning the English throne. This was advice that the belligerent young king wanted to hear. Encouraged, Sempill flooded the government with proposals; he advised marriage between the Stewarts and the house of Savoy; he urged Philip to wage economic warfare; and he argued that the Dutch should be stopped from trading with Spain. In 1602 he was commissioned to go to the Low Countries to find out what he could about the intrigues for the English succession; nothing came of it, perhaps because he was too well known, perhaps because memories of the promptness with which he had been apprehended in 1588 raised doubts about his effectiveness. In 1603 Lerma personally authorized payment of Sempill's expenses.<br>
<br>With the coming of peace with England in 1604 Sempill's influence waned. He lived well enough in Madrid. In 1613 Philip gave him a house in recognition of his services to the crown; Sempill used it to endow a college for Catholic missionaries who were to be trained to return to Britain. The fall of Lerma in 1618 and the death of Philip in 1621 marked the end of his influence at court. He continued to bombard the government with projects&#151;his last extant letter to the government dates from 1629&#151;but he was too closely associated with the Lerma regime to win favour under Gasparo de Guzman, count-duke of Olivares, and was ignored. He died on 1 March 1633. His wife survived him by thirteen years; it is not known whether they had any children.<br>
