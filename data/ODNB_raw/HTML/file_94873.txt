<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Green,  Vivian Hubert Howard</span>  (1915&#150;2005), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman, historian, and college head</span>, was born on 18 November 1915 at 101 Thurlby Road, Wembley, Middlesex, the only child of Hubert James Green, law stationer's clerk, and son of a Hampstead master tailor, and his wife, Edith Eleanor Playle, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Howard, daughter of a civil servant. His father had at one point had a confectioner's shop in Wembley but at some time in the late 1920s the family moved to Shanklin on the Isle of Wight, where Green's mother's family lived. They again moved a few years later to Minehead in Somerset. The family was not wholly untroubled. Green had little affection for his father. He was, however, deeply devoted to his mother and to his aunt, Gertrude, who accompanied the family to Minehead. As the owner of successive confectionery shops in seaside towns, Green's father prospered modestly, and Green's mother took on additional work to help send him to Bradfield College. From Bradfield he obtained a scholarship to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he obtained a first in both parts of the tripos. In 1937&#150;8 he was a Gladstone research student at St Deiniol's Library, Hawarden. He set himself the life of Bishop Reginald Pecock as an appropriate research subject. His essay on Pecock won the Thirlwall medal and prize in 1941.<br>
<br>Green had been ordained in 1940 and became chaplain at Exeter School and St Luke's Training College. He later vividly remembered his service as an air raid warden and the havoc that Baedeker raids inflicted on Exeter. (They incidentally destroyed his papers, delaying publication of his book on Pecock until 1945.) In 1942 he became chaplain and history master at Sherborne School, a post that suited him well. His pupils accorded him respect and liking, though they could not resist naming him Gumboil Green on account of the cyst that he bore on his cheek at that time. He travelled widely in Europe with his closest colleague, H. H. Brown, whose friendship he enjoyed for many years. Their regular trips to Switzerland resulted in a notable account, <span class="italic">The Swiss Alps</span> (1961). Green's historical works as a schoolmaster were necessarily based on secondary materials. His <span class="italic">The Hanoverians: 1714&#150;1915</span> (1948) sold well, but ignored the Namierite revolution that was transforming eighteenth-century history. On the other hand <span class="italic">Renaissance and Reformation</span> (1952) was widely appreciated as a balanced account of European history in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and remained a school textbook for many years.<br>
<br>In 1951 Green applied for the chaplaincy of Lincoln College, Oxford. He was placed <i>proxime accessit</i>. Fortunately for Green the successful candidate felt unable to give communion to the rector of the day, Keith Murray, a keen supporter of chapel but a Scottish Presbyterian. Green had no reservations on the subject and was duly appointed. In addition to the chaplaincy he taught medieval history, held various offices including the senior tutorship, and was sub-rector from 1970 to 1983. In that role he was esteemed by an expanding fellowship. He enjoyed reminding his colleagues that sub-rectors had once had a whip with which to keep order among them. He was entirely lacking in malice though he was not incapable of sending up humbug. His good nature and congeniality extended to all he knew and met. He was an unfailing source of good sense and judgement, though he never patronized his juniors. He was a conscientious but not a rigorous and demanding tutor. He was, however, exceptionally empathetic and supportive. He was never taken in, but neither did he betray a confidence.<br>
<br>Though he gave up his chaplaincy in 1969 Green did not lose his love of the liturgy, the poetry, and the music of traditional Anglicanism. In his later years he increasingly doubted its supernatural doctrines. If his latitudinarianism turned to agnosticism he avoided controversial debate. None the less, his wide-ranging book <span class="italic">A New History of Christianity</span> (1996) reflected his belief that the church was increasingly remote from modern life.<br>
<br>Green was perhaps at his best as the historian of an ancient, small, and beautiful Oxford college, preserved mainly because it was for long one of the poorest Oxford colleges. Immersed in its archives, he wrote a succession of books that reflected great scholarship, as well as deep affection for the collegiate tradition that Lincoln maintained. His instinctive tolerance always carried over into his historical world. <span class="italic">Oxford Common Room</span> (1957) was a delightful evocation of an intimate, sometimes factious little world of nineteenth-century fellows. <span class="italic">The Young Wesley</span> (1961) portrayed Wesley before his heart was &#145;strangely warmed&#146;, struggling with his own impulses and thoughts, relishing the wine, cards, and evening parties of early eighteenth-century Oxford, and not a little attracted by young women whom he encountered among the Cotswold families with which he became acquainted. Among other things Green identified the room that Wesley had occupied in his younger days, where the Holy Club met and Methodism had its origins, distinct from the so-called Wesley Room, restored by American Methodists in 1929. It seems likely that Wesley lived in the latter during his last years as a fellow. Green's magnum opus was <span class="italic">The Commonwealth of Lincoln College</span> (1979), a work of scholarship applied to five centuries of the college's history. His mastery of the college's records never obscured his appreciation of the human colour of its changing community. He always took a particular interest in Mark Pattison, for many years a formidable figure in Lincoln, a leading intellectual light in the university as a whole, and not least a likely model for George Eliot's Edward Casaubon. He never published the biography that he had worked on. He did, however, write up the story of Pattison's deep affection for a young woman of tender years in <span class="italic">Love in a Cool Climate</span> (1985), as well as editing his <span class="italic">Memoirs of an Oxford Don</span> (1988).<br>
<br>In 1983 Green became rector of Lincoln College in succession to Lord Trend, albeit for only four years since it was known that he would retire at seventy. In the event his tenure proved more than a sentimental gesture. He was a force for moderation and toleration, and showed astuteness in managing colleagues and students alike. He treasured the opportunity to lead the little <i>collegiolum</i> that Richard Fleming, bishop of Lincoln, had founded, somewhat precariously, in 1427. Green's portrait by Richard Foster was hung in college with that of Lord Trend, but more characteristic was the cover photograph on the student magazine of the day, <span class="italic">The Lincoln Imp</span>, which displayed him astride a motorbike, kitted out in black leather.<br>
<br>In later life Green was identified publicly as the partial original of John le Carr&eacute;'s inscrutable Smiley, a character rendered all the more plausible by Alec Guinness's television performance. le Carr&eacute; (David Cornwell) owed Green a considerable debt for his friendship and support both at Sherborne and Lincoln, a debt that he amply returned in later life. Green seemed an unlikely spy to other friends and colleagues, but in his construction of Smiley, le Carr&eacute; was aiming to convey that spies or &#145;spooks&#146; were not at all what most people supposed.<br>
<br>Green's retirement was a happy one. His friendship with William Scoular was a source of great strength to him. It began with Scoular's casting of Green as Canon Chasuble in his production of <span class="italic">The Importance of Being Earnest</span> at the Apollo Theatre in Oxford (1979). In 1988 they published jointly <span class="italic">A Question of Guilt: the Murder of Nancy Eaton</span>, an investigation of a Canadian crime that had uncomfortable implications. The case was subsequently made the subject of a film by Scoular in 2003. Green continued to write to the end. In his last days he edited the proofs of the second edition of his <span class="italic">The Madness of Kings</span>, a study of the psychiatric disorders of monarchs throughout history which he had first published in 1993. He died on 18 January 2005 at Old Prebendal House, a nursing home in Shipton-under-Wychwood, Oxfordshire, a few miles from his delightful if somewhat decaying residence, Calendars, in Burford, where he had over many years entertained students, colleagues, friends, and acquaintances with characteristic generosity, kindness, humour, and charm. He never married, and had no children.<br>
