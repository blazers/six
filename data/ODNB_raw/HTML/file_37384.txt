<span class="headword">Ecgfrith</span>  (645/6&#150;685), <span class="occ">king of Northumbria</span>, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20930/', "Oswiu (611/12&#150;670)")</script>, king in Northumbria, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8392/', "Eanfl&#230;d (b. 626, d. after 685)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8567/', "King Eadwine of Northumbria")</script>. Born in 645 or, less probably, in 646, he is first heard of in 655, at the time of the battle of the Winw&aelig;d between the Mercians and the Northumbrians, when he was a hostage with Queen Cynewise of Mercia. He became king after his father's death in February 670.<br>
<br>Ecgfrith's reign was marked by his generous endowment of the Northumbrian church, by his bitter quarrel with its most flamboyant leader, Wilfrid, bishop of York, and by a militancy towards neighbouring peoples, the Mercians, the Picts, and the Irish, which eventually brought him disaster. His reputation as &#145;a venerable and most pious king&#146;&#151;the words of Bede  (&#145;Historia abbatum&#146;, 364)&#151;rested chiefly on his friendship with Benedict Biscop, Oswiu's former thegn turned monk, and with the ascetic Cuthbert. His provision of 70 hides of land for Benedict's new foundation in Wearmouth in 674 and a further 40 hides for his parallel foundation in Jarrow in 681 associated him with the two houses, which were to become pre-eminent in Northumbrian monastic culture and scholarship. He was equally generous to Cuthbert, pressing him to accept the bishopric of Lindisfarne in 685 and granting him and his church land in Cartmel and Carlisle in the north-west and in Crayke in the Vale of York.<br>
<br>With Wilfrid, who had a sharper sense of his own worth than either Benedict or Cuthbert, Ecgfrith's relations were more difficult. Initially his friend and patron, and present when Wilfrid's splendid new church in Ripon was consecrated between 671 and 678, he later fell out with him, for two main reasons. The first concerned Ecgfrith's wife. He had married, probably in 660, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8906/', "&#198;thelthryth")</script>, daughter of Anna, king of the East Angles, and widow of Tondbehrt, <i>princeps</i> of the South Gyrwe. Despite her previous marriage, &AElig;thelthryth had always lived as a virgin and was determined to remain one, retiring altogether to live as a nun in Coldingham about 672. Wilfrid seems to have been her spiritual adviser: she had endowed his new monastery in Hexham, he had veiled her on her entry to religion, and Ecgfrith had reportedly offered Wilfrid land and wealth in order to get him to persuade the queen to live as his wife. Frustrated dynastically as well as sexually, Ecgfrith is likely to have blamed Wilfrid for &AElig;thelthryth's contumacy. Secondly, Wilfrid was excessively powerful. His huge diocese, covering not only Northumbria itself but also the tributary territories of the Picts and the Irish colonies in western Scotland, his riches, and the numbers of his monasteries and his followers, made him very much a prince bishop. In 678 Ecgfrith, urged on by his second wife, Iurminburg, expelled Wilfrid from his see and divided it in two, with a new bishop in Hexham as well as York. Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury confirmed these changes, which fell in neatly with his own plans to break up unmanageably large tribal dioceses. Wilfrid appealed to Rome and secured a papal judgment in his favour; but vainly. On his return in 680 he was deprived of his relics by Iurminburg, imprisoned for nine months by Ecgfrith, and then expelled for a second time from the kingdom.<br>
<br>It gave Stephen of Ripon, Wilfrid's biographer, some satisfaction to point out that Ecgfrith's partnership with Wilfrid coincided with the king's years of military success and that his failures followed from their differences. Before 675 he had defeated Wulfhere of Mercia, bringing the kingdom of Lindsey (the north of modern Lincolnshire) and possibly a larger part of Mercia under his direct rule: his presence at the Synod of Hertford in 672 may be a mark of this temporary overlordship. About the same time he defeated the Picts in battle. But in 679 he himself was defeated by &AElig;thelred of Mercia at the battle of the Trent, where Ecgfrith's brother &AElig;lfwine was killed. Lindsey was lost and the Humber restored as Northumbria's southern frontier. The main threat now came from the north and west: from the Picts and their allies the Irish, with whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/306/', "Aldfrith")</script>, Ecgfrith's half-brother, may also have been in alliance. Aldfrith's exile in Irish territory, and his relationship through his mother with the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, the most powerful of the Irish tribes, partly explains the successful attack by Ecgfrith on the U&iacute; N&eacute;ill lands in Ireland in 684. In the following year he invaded Pictish territory, where he was defeated and killed at Nechtansmere (now identified as Dunnichen Moss, near Forfar) on 20 May 685. The battle was a turning point in Northumbrian fortunes. The Picts and the Irish of western Scotland recovered their independence, the Forth was probably re-established as Northumbria's northern frontier, and the bishopric at Abercorn on its southern shore, established by Ecgfrith for the Picts, was abandoned.<br>
<br>Ecgfrith has suffered historically by comparison with Eadwine, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20916/', "Oswald")</script>, and Oswiu, his great Northumbrian predecessors, and by reason of his final failure in the north. Like his predecessors, he was both a barbarian warlord and (as Stephen of Ripon admitted) &#145;a most Christian king&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Bishop Wilfrid</span>, 37). Although he lacked the control over the southern kingdoms which might have put him on Bede's famous list of kings holding <i>imperium</i> in the south, he remained a formidable ruler, with the resources to endow the church lavishly and to raise the navy which must have been necessary for his invasion of Ireland. Deprived after Nechtansmere of the land and tribute from the Picts and Irish which probably underlay such power, Northumbria is likely to have been a poorer as well as a less dominant kingdom.<br>
