<span class="headword">Lysons, Sir  Daniel</span>  (1816&#150;1898), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 1 August 1816 at Rodmarton, near Tetbury, Gloucestershire, was second son of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17296/', "Revd Daniel Lysons (1762&#150;1834)")</script>, the topographer, and his second wife, Josepha Catherine Susanna (1780/81&#150;1868), daughter of John Gilbert Cooper of Thurgarton Priory, Nottinghamshire. He was educated at the Revd Harvey Marryat's school at Bath and at Shrewsbury School (1829&#150;32), where he twice saved boys from drowning. He spent two years (1832&#150;3) with M. Frossard at N&icirc;mes to learn French. On 26 December 1834 he obtained by purchase a commission as ensign in the 1st Royals, joined the regiment at Athlone in February 1835, and went with it to Canada in the following year.<br>
<br>Lysons became lieutenant on 23 August 1837, and, owing to his skill as a draughtsman, he was employed on the staff of the deputy quartermaster-general, Colonel Charles Gore, during the Canadian uprising. He was present at the action of St Denis (November 1837), was mentioned in dispatches, and was at the capture of St Eustache (December 1837). He was deputy assistant quartermaster-general from 1 December 1837 to 12 July 1841, and with the assistance of officers of the line he surveyed much of the frontier. A keen hunter, he portrayed his Canadian life, and especially moose hunting, in his <span class="italic">Early Reminiscences</span> (1896).<br>
<br>On 29 October 1843 the right wing of the Royals left Quebec for the West Indies in the transport <i>Premier</i>, which was wrecked six days afterwards in Chatte Bay, on the right bank of the St Lawrence. Lysons was active in saving those on board and, being sent back to Quebec for help, he made in four and a half days what was reckoned an eight days' journey of 300 miles. His exertions were praised in general orders, and he was rewarded by a company in the 3rd West India regiment on 29 December (captain by purchase). He went from England to the West Indies in spring 1844, and was given command of the troops in Tobago; but on 24 May he was transferred to the 23rd Welch fusiliers, then stationed in Barbados. He was brigade major there from 3 November 1845 to 15 March 1847, when he accompanied his regiment to Halifax, Nova Scotia.<br>
<br>Lysons returned with his regiment to England in the autumn of 1848. He was town major at Portsmouth from 18 June to 21 August in 1849, and drew up a system of camping and cooking there. Promoted major (by purchase) on 3 August, he rejoined his regiment at Winchester, and served with it during the next five years at Plymouth, Liverpool, Chester, and Parkhurst. In April 1854 he embarked with it for Turkey, and was the first man to land in the Crimea in September. The 23rd formed part of the 1st brigade of the light division. At the Alma it lost over 200 officers and men, including its commanding officer. Just before the battle Lysons joined the 2nd division as assistant adjutant-general, but succeeding to the lieutenant-colonelcy of his regiment on 21 September, he returned to take command of it. He was present at Inkerman, though suffering from fever.<br>
<br>In the assault of 18 June 1855 Lysons commanded the supports of the column furnished by his brigade. He was wounded in the knee, but brought the brigade out of action, and had command of it for a time. In the second assault, on 8 September, he led an attack on the right flank of the Redan, and was severely wounded in the thigh. On 25 October he was given command of the 2nd brigade of the light division, and retained it until the end of the war. He had been mentioned in dispatches, was made brevet colonel on 17 July 1855 and CB (5 July), and received the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (fourth class) and Mejidiye (third class).<br>
<br>Lysons returned to England in July 1856, and resumed command of the 23rd. On 16 January 1857 he exchanged to the 25th foot, and on 24 November went on half pay, having been appointed on 5 November assistant adjutant-general at headquarters. In this office he was employed on the revision of the infantry drill-book and its adaptation to the needs of the volunteers. He also prepared <span class="italic">Instructions for Mounted Rifle Volunteers</span> (1860). On 6 December 1861 he was sent to Canada in connection with the <i>Trent</i> crisis, and he was deputy quartermaster-general from 27 August 1862 until 30 September 1867. This gave him an opportunity of extending the frontier surveys on which he had worked as a subaltern. He was a member, representing imperial concerns, of the 1862 commission on Canadian defence, which reported (March 1862) in favour of the old sedentary militia system, from which an effective defensive force could be trained.<br>
<br>Promoted major-general on 27 December 1868, Lysons commanded brigades at Malta (July 1868 to March 1869) and Aldershot (April 1869 to June 1872), then commanded in the northern district (July 1872 to June 1874). A system of his devising was issued by authority in 1875 as <span class="italic">Infantry Piquets</span>. From 1 April 1876 to 30 June 1880 he was quartermaster-general at headquarters. He became lieutenant-general and was made KCB on 2 June 1877. On 25 August he became colonel of the Derbyshire regiment, and on 14 July 1879 a general. He was also honorary colonel of the 1st volunteer battalion, Royal Fusiliers. From 1 July 1880 to 1 August 1883 he commanded the Aldershot division, and he was then placed on the retired list, having reached the age of sixty-seven. On 29 May 1886 he received the GCB, and on 4 March 1890 he was made constable of the Tower.<br>
<br>In 1856 Lysons married Harriet Sophia, daughter of Charles Bridges of Court House, Overton. She died in 1864, and in 1865 he married Anna Sophia Biscoe, daughter of the Revd Robert Tritton of Morden, Surrey; she survived her husband. With his first wife he had four sons, of whom the second, Henry, won the Victoria Cross at Hlobane in the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, when a lieutenant in the Scottish Rifles and Colonel Evelyn Wood's orderly. Lysons died at his residence, 22 Warwick Square, Belgravia, London, on 29 January 1898, and was buried at Rodmarton. Vigorous to the last, he had been writing on army reform a month before (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 December 1897).<br>
