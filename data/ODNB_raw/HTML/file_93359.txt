<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Alexander,  Du Pre</span>, second earl of Caledon  (1777&#150;1839), <span class="occ">politician and colonial administrator</span>, was born on 14 December 1777, the only son of James Alexander (1730&#150;1802), first earl of Caledon, of Caledon Castle, co. Tyrone, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1777), daughter of James Crawford of Crawfordsburn, co. Down. His mother died a week after his birth. His father reaped the rewards for the years he had spent, from 1752 to 1772, as a merchant in India and an East India Company official when he acquired wealth that he estimated at over &pound;500,000. In 1774 he had become MP for Londonderry City, where his forebears had been merchants, and in 1775&#150;6 he purchased the 9000 acre Caledon estate on the borders of Tyrone and Armagh for &pound;89,000. By the time of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> (1800) James Alexander had been raised to an earldom, commanded two parliamentary seats for the borough of Newtownards, and was the head of a family interest that included one Irish bishop and two Irish MPs.<h2>
<a name="Irishrepresentativepeerandboroughowner"></a>Irish representative peer and borough owner</h2>Alexander, whose forename Du Pre was given to him in recognition of the services rendered to his father by his uncle Josias Du Pre, governor of Madras in 1770&#150;73, was educated at Eton (1791&#150;6) and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1799. He was the first member of his family to receive an education in England. Appointed a major in the Tyrone militia in 1799, he was returned by his father to represent Newtownards (29 January 1800) in the Irish parliament shortly before the decisive debates on the union. He supported the measure that led to the borough's disfranchisement at the end of the year. Following the union, Alexander was raised to lieutenant-colonel in the Tyrone militia and, having been appointed a sheriff of co. Armagh by the Irish administration, was ready to purchase a seat at Westminster. However, his succession to the earldom on his father's death on 22 March 1802 altered his plans.<br>
<br>In June 1802 Caledon (as he had now become) purchased from Lord Camelford, Pitt's cousin and the brother-in-law of Lord Grenville, the estate and notorious &#145;close&#146; borough of Old Sarum for &pound;43,000, deploying Du Pre's nephew Josias Du Pre Porcher (1761?&#150;1820) as an intermediary. At the general election a month later he returned his cousin Henry Alexander (1763?&#150;1818) for one of the seats and offered the other to Nicholas Vansittart, a nominee of the government. Caledon was now not only the head of the influential Alexander family but also possessed of considerable landed and personal wealth together with the means to provide parliamentary seats for both family and political chiefs. This led him to abandon his own plans to find a seat in the House of Commons and to seek instead a place in the House of Lords as one of the twenty-eight Irish representative peers. Thus when a vacancy occurred in 1804 he secured the support of Pitt's government and was elected following an extensive personal canvass.<h2>
<a name="GovernorofCapeColony"></a>Governor of Cape Colony</h2>Caledon's subsequent career falls into two parts. The first was dominated by his successful application in May 1806 to Lord Grenville, the prime minister, for the post of governor of Cape Colony on its becoming a British possession for the second time. He arrived in Cape Town as the first civil governor on 21 May 1807 and departed on 4 July 1811. The appointment of such a young man to administer an area nearly twice that of the United Kingdom created, it was said, a good deal of &#145;croakings and groanings&#146; on all sides at Westminster but was the result of personal and political factors  (Castilla, Countess Granville, ed., <span class="italic">Lord Granville Leveson Gower</span>, 2 vols., 1916, 2.201). Caledon once said that he had been &#145;educated&#146; to regard &#145;attachment to the King's government&#146; as his &#145;political principle&#146; and having supported the Addington and Pitt governments he offered the same support, save on the Catholic question, to Lord Grenville's once he was satisfied of the prime minister's ascendancy over Fox  (Caledon MSS, D.2431/5/8, pp. 63&#150;4). However, he liked to think of such support as his own choice rather than being a matter of obligation.<br>
<br>Grenville, for his part, although he was probably aware of Caledon's military experience in Ireland and would have known of him personally through his purchase of Old Sarum, was principally concerned with his electoral interest. The prime minister therefore asked him whether, if appointed to the Cape governorship, he could count on that interest in Ireland being given to supporters of the government. Caledon evidently replied that if this had not been the case, he would not have applied for the post. The deal was therefore settled&#151;his appointment as governor taking place on 2 July 1806&#151;and was accompanied by the appointment of his cousin Henry Alexander, MP for Old Sarum, as his secretary. Later he gave his proxy to Grenville on all matters other than the Catholic question, and when the administration resigned in March 1807 Caledon offered his own resignation to prove himself &#145;independent&#146;, an offer that was not taken up  (Caledon MSS, D.2433/C/9/30). Moreover, he offered to resign again in November 1808 when it was intimated that his official position required him to require his &#145;friends in parliament&#146; to support the Portland administration. He withdrew the offer, however, when he learned that ministers had made no such stipulation  (Caledon to Castlereagh, 21 Nov 1808 and 3 July 1809, Caledon MSS, D.2431/5/8).<br>
<br>During his relatively short tenure of the Cape Colony governorship Caledon operated under a number of disadvantages. Successive governments were principally concerned with the war in Europe and paid scant attention to the problems he confronted, starving him of funds on the argument that the colony should be self-supporting. Although he exercised supreme authority over civil matters, and governed the colony by proclamation, it was unclear whether his authority over military matters superseded that of the army commander, Lieutenant-General Henry George Grey (1766&#150;1845), the result being a conflict between the two men that precipitated Caledon's retirement. The energy and commitment to improvement that he brought to his governorship were nevertheless impressive.<br>
<br>In the case of the economy, Caledon reorganized the Lombard Bank, ordered that its outstanding loans were to be repaid, and arranged with the British government for an additional 1 million rix dollars to be issued. He also established investment and discount banks in 1808. This, it has been argued, &#145;left the Colony's financial position on a much sounder footing&#146;  (<span class="italic">DSAB</span>, 3.14). In addition he was committed to developing sheep farming and viticulture, and reforming the system of land ownership, but was unable to make much progress in the time available. He was more successful, however, in reforming the administrative and judicial systems, and in improving the health of the settlers. When he arrived the authority of the resident &#145;fiscal&#146; was extensive and the colony was divided into six districts that were far too large for efficient administration. He therefore reduced the fiscal's powers and sub-divided three of the districts, taking the opportunity to name two after himself (Caledon) and another Irish peer, Clanwilliam.<br>
<br>As for the law, Caledon made it possible for the governor to hear criminal as well as civil appeals and established a circuit court in order to lessen the inconvenience and expense of having all cases tried in Cape Town. He also applied a feature of the English and Irish system of administration and insisted that circuit court judges keep the government informed on the affairs of the localities. Finally he procured a vaccine against diseases such as smallpox that had an immediate beneficial effect shortly after his departure. These steps, it has been argued, &#145;improved administrative efficiency&#146; and &#145;strengthened the government's authority in the inland regions&#146;  (<span class="italic">DSAB</span>, 3.13).<br>
<br>Caledon's greatest difficulties, for which his Irish experience may have prepared him, lay in relations with the indigenous San (bushmen), Khoi, and black Africans. He authorized the raising of a militia or commando to respond to San attacks, and though he instructed it to seek to preserve the peace rather than act in a vengeful manner, the virtual genocide of the San continued. The Khoi presented a greater challenge, for legally they were independent, though their chiefs had lost their authority and most were farm labourers or itinerants in search of a living. Caledon's response was to issue a proclamation in 1809 which made all Khoi subject to the laws of the colony; to insist that they had fixed places of residence, officially regulated by passes; and to have contracts established setting out conditions of employment. These measures regularized relations between Khoi and their employers for the first time, and offered the Khoi some legal protection against ill-treatment, but effectively forced them into the position of farm labour for the colonists, and failed to provide the means for their economic improvement. Pressure exercised upon the London government by the London Missionary Society, following allegations by the missionaries James Read and Johannes Theodorus van der Kemp of violence and even murders committed against the Khoi by the colonists, contributed to Caledon's decision in 1811 to set up the circuit courts to ensure that the law was enforced in outlying areas.<br>
<br>Caledon's policy towards black Africans ultimately raised the issue that led to his resignation. Raids on farmers in the eastern borderland led to requests for a military response. In 1808 he sent Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Collins (1774?&#150;1813) to review the colony's eastern frontier, and received a recommendation that the Xhosa be expelled from the Zuurveld, and that the colony's frontier be enforced along the Great Fish River. Caledon, however, preferred a more conciliatory approach, partly because he thought it inadvisable to begin a border campaign during the course of the European war, when his garrison was depleted; and partly because of the uncertainty about his and General Grey's authority in the matter. When, in 1811, he eventually decided to authorize a military operation against the Xhosa, he withheld the order because of this uncertainty about his authority. The raids therefore continued and Caledon admitted to his successor Sir John Cradock that in this respect his governorship had been a failure.<br>
<br>Moreover, it was probably this disappointment that brought about the crucial dispute with Grey. In July 1810 he received a request from Lord Minto, the governor-general of India, for a force to assist in the capture of Mauritius. Caledon detached 2000 infantry in what turned out to be a successful operation but he found that Grey assumed that control of the force would be his. This, together with the government's repeated inattention to his requests, particularly on the question of his powers, led him to resign in June of the following year. His failure to tackle frontier problems and his differences with Grey cast a shadow over what was otherwise a constructive governorship.<h2>
<a name="WestminsterpoliticsandIrishlandowning18111839"></a>Westminster politics and Irish landowning, 1811&#150;1839</h2>Following his return to Ireland in the summer of 1811 Caledon married within a short period of time (on 16 October 1811) Catharine Freeman Yorke (1786&#150;1863), the second daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30248/', "Philip Yorke, third earl of Hardwicke")</script>. It is possible that they had met earlier when Hardwicke was lord lieutenant of Ireland, in 1801&#150;6, and they were both certainly well prepared for the marriage. He had had his house at Caledon remodelled by Nash during his time in the Cape and she brought land in Hertfordshire as a dowry, including Tittenhanger near St Albans, a house designed by Inigo Jones. Their first and only child, a son, was born on 27 July 1812.<br>
<br>Caledon's career thereafter consisted of being a representative peer and exercising his responsibilities as a major landowner in Ireland and England. In 1817 his Irish estate was valued at &pound;200,000 and that in Wiltshire at nearly &pound;74,000. It was at this time that he exchanged a portion of his Wiltshire estates at Stratford together with the return for Old Sarum with his nephew, James Alexander, for the latter's property at Bounds, near Tonbridge in Kent.<br>
<br>In the case of Westminster politics, Caledon continued to regard himself as an independent supporter of the administration. In March 1812 he declined to have Vansittart re-elected, following his prospective appointment as a minister in Perceval's government, on the grounds that it would commit him to support and tie him too closely to Lord Sidmouth's interest. The effect, he wrote, would be to &#145;neutralise, if not wholly annihilate my parliamentary consequence&#146;  (Caledon MSS, D.2433/C/11/8). On that occasion Vansittart declined office in deference to Caledon's wishes but during the formation of Lord Liverpool's government in May of that year he was offered the much greater prize of the chancellorship of the exchequer. Caledon, however, held the same line with Liverpool as he had with his predecessor, Vansittart being replaced at Old Sarum by James Alexander.<br>
<br>Later, in 1818 and 1820, Caledon was disappointed in his long-standing pursuit of a British peerage, the claim to which he felt justified by his services in the Cape, particularly by supporting the capture of Mauritius, but which he had undermined by surrendering the return for Old Sarum. His only further honour was therefore appointment as a KP in 1821. He was not, however, an active member of the Lords. He made only three recorded interventions in debate between 1804 and 1828 and these were short. On 10 July 1817 he opposed the government's bill to provide independent supervision of the charges (presentments) levied by Irish grand juries for public works, defending the honourable conduct of those in the northern counties. Six years later, on 19 June 1823, he castigated Lord Wellesley's Irish administration for disappointing all his &#145;expectations&#146;; and on 14 April 1826 he supported an opposition motion making bank notes payable where they were issued, a policy that would have created severe difficulties for the Bank of Ireland.<br>
<br>Caledon was slightly more active, however, during the turbulent years that followed. He supported the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span> of 1829 but opposed the English and Welsh <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> and intervened a number of times in debate, exhibiting once again an independent frame of mind. Made one of the lords lieutenant of Irish counties&#151;newly created posts&#151;in 1831 (for co. Tyrone) by the whigs, he declared that he was &#145;unconnected&#146; with the government in March the following year and suggested several amendments to its Irish <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in July. Later, in February 1835, he declined the Peel government's offer, strongly supported by William IV, that he conduct an inquiry into Canadian government as a special commissioner, stating he knew little of the colony.<br>
<br>In his capacity as lord lieutenant of co. Tyrone, Caledon made no secret of his readiness to defend the interests of protestants but believed that on an all-Ireland basis this was best done by removing outstanding grievances, and in Ulster by preventing sectarianism and acting fairly towards Catholics. At the national level he served as a member of the House of Lords select committee on tithes to the Church of Ireland and supported the committee's recommendation that they be abolished with compensation. As for co. Tyrone, he showed sensitivity to Catholic grievances and was particularly hostile to Orange actions likely to inflame them. In July 1832 he wrote to a local Orange leader:<blockquote>I look upon Protestants as being the main support of a British connection, as the most industrious and intelligent part of the community; but I consider the Orange system as tending to disunite us when our religion alone should be a sufficient bond of our union. (Caledon MSS, D.2433/C/12/1, pp. 47&#150;8)</blockquote>An understanding of the plight of others was also a feature of Caledon's conduct as a landowner. In 1829 he and his wife became patrons of the Mendicity Society of Caledon and in 1831 he became chairman of the London-based Irish Distress Committee formed to gather funds for the relief of severe food scarcity in the western counties. This was dissolved in 1835 and its funds handed to committees in co. Mayo. The Caledon estate records also show him to have been a benevolent and improving landlord. He died at Caledon House, co. Tyrone, on 8 April 1839, having made a significant contribution to the history of the Cape and to the causes of moderation and improvement in Ireland.<br>
