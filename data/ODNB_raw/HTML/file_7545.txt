<span class="headword">Des Granges,  David</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1611, <em>d.</em> in or before 1672?), <span class="occ">miniature painter</span>, was baptized on 24 March 1611 at the French church in Threadneedle Street, in the City of London, and again at the church of St Anne Blackfriars. He was the first of five children of Samson Des Granges (<i>d</i>. 1636) and his wife, Marie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bouvier, who had married, also at the French church, on 2 November 1609. Among the witnesses of David's baptism and the baptism of the second son, Francis (10 June 1613), were the maternal aunt Esther, a silkwoman to the queen, and George Heriot, the king's goldsmith and jeweller. The family continued to live in the parish of St Anne Blackfriars, close to the family of Isaac Oliver, Cornelius Jonson, and Anthony Van Dyck, until David's marriage at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, on 7 January 1636, to Judith Hoskins. Her family is not known but the name suggests a relationship with the household of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13839/', "John Hoskins")</script>, and hence with Samuel and Alexander Cooper, all miniaturists. David and Judith Des Granges had at least four children whose names are identifiable: David (<i>d</i>. 1648), John (1643&#150;1685/6), Mary (<i>b</i>. 1646), and Esther (<i>d</i>. 1690). The family lived on Elm Street, Long Acre, in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, where David is documented until 1672  (Edmond, &#145;Limners and picturemakers&#146;, 123&#150;4). In 1671 he petitioned the king for payment of money owed to him. In 1672, though three people with the name Degrange (John, Magdalen, and Katherine) were mentioned in Samuel Cooper's will, he himself was not, and was presumably dead.<br>
<br>Des Granges's earliest miniatures date from the later 1620s and show a strong consciousness of the style and technical practice of both Peter Oliver and John Hoskins. Like Alexander Cooper he may have been taught by Peter Oliver. During the 1630s he seems to have worked in some sort of association, possibly arising out of a family relationship with Hoskins, helping in particular with the multiplication of Hoskins's images, after Van Dyck, of the king and the future Charles II (versions are in the Buccleuch collection, Scotland, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London). This period culminates in the painting in 1640 of the so-called <span class="italic">Allegory of the Marchese del Vasto</span>, after the Titian then in the Royal Collection (now in the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre, Paris). Des Granges's miniature, which is in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum at Ham House in Surrey, would have been copied via an <i>editio princeps</i> by Peter Oliver of 1629 (Royal Collection), which was borrowed from the Royal Collection in that year to be copied also by Richard Gibson, &#145;My Ld Chamberleine's Page&#146; (the Gibson miniature is dated 1640 and is now at Welbeck Abbey in Nottinghamshire).<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the civil wars Des Granges seems to have followed the court out of London. During the interregnum he was with Charles II in Scotland, producing batches of a Charles II likeness after Adriaen Hanneman (versions in the National Portrait Gallery and at Ham House), on which Nathaniel Thach also worked (versions of the Thach copy are in the Mauritshuis in The Hague and on loan at the Victoria and Albert Museum). It was this work that gave rise to Des Granges's petition to the king in 1671 for payment due, in which he claims, perhaps plausibly but in the language usual in such petitions, to be &#145;old and infirm, and his sight and his labour failing him &hellip; forced to rely on the charity of well-disposed persons&#146;  (Goulding, 29). The schedule to the same document specifies the distribution of thirteen miniatures:<blockquote>one to a French Marquess who came to Your Majesty at St Johnston's in 1651 pretending raising a troop of horse for Your Majesty; one to Mr Oudart &hellip; one to Mr Seymour &hellip; one to Lady Balcarris &hellip; one for Lady Annandale &hellip; one for Major Boswel &hellip; which Your Majesty gave with your own hands; one to Mr Harding, attendant upon Your majesty, given the same night; three to Sir James Erskine &hellip; One to my Lord of Newburgh; one to my Lady Tullibardin, and one to Mr Rainsford employed in a message to Your majesty on the 6th of July 1651. (ibid.)</blockquote>The list shows how important the portrait miniature was in acquiring and maintaining the loyalty of those in the inner circle of the exiled king, at this time especially. A notice in the London periodical <span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span> (426, 22&#150;9 July 1658, 701) states that, after a period living outside England or in the country, Des Granges was resident in lodgings owned by an ironmonger, Palmer, near the Fountain tavern in the Strand.<br>
<br>After the Restoration there is some fine, sophisticated work by Des Granges showing that he responded to the influence of the new court portraitists such as Jacob Huysmans (<span class="italic">Catherine of Braganza as a Shepherdess</span>, formerly in the collection of Mrs Daphne Foskett) and some evidence (a so-called <span class="italic">Brian Duppa</span> in the Victoria and Albert Museum) that he experimented with the red-brown hatching style associated with Samuel Cooper. This stylistic variability, and the existence of some poor-quality work that bears the DDG monogram, has led to the use of Des Granges's name as a portmanteau attribution, especially in the salerooms. That in turn has inflated the apparent size of his <i>&#339;uvre</i> in miniature, which may well now distort our sense of the main field in which he was active. George Vertue saw an engraving by him: &#145;St. George on horseback&#151;after Raphael&#151;David des Granges Sculpsit 1628. I have before remarkt. this print. dedicated to Wm. Earl of Pembroke&#151;and afterwards done by L. Vorstermans, much like it&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 4.194). He is also reputed to have been a painter in oils: the well-known large oil painting <span class="italic">The Saltonstall Family</span> (Tate collection), a composition that defies the Renaissance science of perspective, is attributed to him. In 1658 William Sanderson, a court loyalist like Des Granges, citing the leading artists of the British school, referred to him alongside Robert Walker, Gilbert Soest, John Michael Wright, Sir Peter Lely, and John Hales (or Hayls) as &#145;rare Artizans&#146;  (<span class="italic">Graphice</span>, 1658, 20), but no substantial or certain <i>&#339;uvre</i> in oils survives on which to base any sense of his achievement in that medium. He was not mentioned by Sanderson among the miniaturists, nor as an engraver.<br>
