<span class="headword">Stanley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Dillon-Lee]</span>,  Henrietta Maria</span>, Lady Stanley of Alderley  (1807&#150;1895), <span class="occ">political hostess and campaigner for women's education</span>, was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 21 December 1807, the eldest child of the six sons and five daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7669/', "Henry Augustus Dillon-Lee, thirteenth Viscount Dillon (1777&#150;1832)")</script>, and his wife, Henrietta (1789&#150;1862), daughter of Dominick Geoffrey Browne, MP for Mayo.<br>
<br>The Dillon family's Roman Catholicism and Jacobite sympathies had taken them into exile in France in the early eighteenth century. The conversion to Anglicanism of the head of the family allowed them to resume control of their Irish estates and the thirteenth viscount raised troops to fight against Napoleon; but he and his family preferred to live abroad. In 1814 they settled in Florence. Lady Stanley's grandson, the philosopher Bertrand Russell, attached great importance to her non-English upbringing:<blockquote>my grandmother's outlook, throughout her life, was in some ways more Continental than English. She was always downright, free from prudery, and eighteenth-century rather than Victorian in her conversation. Her French and Italian were faultless, and she was passionately interested in Italian unity. (<span class="italic">Amberley Papers</span>, 1.17)</blockquote>In Florence, Henrietta Maria met, and married on 7 October 1826, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26267/', "Edward John Stanley")</script>, eldest son of Sir John Thomas Stanley, seventh baronet, created Baron Stanley of Alderley in May 1839. E. J. Stanley sat as a whig MP in 1833&#150;41 and again in 1846&#150;7, before going to the Lords in May 1848 as first Baron Eddisbury of Winnington; he succeeded his father as second Baron Stanley in October 1850. Nicknamed &#145;Benjamin Backbite&#146; or, more familiarly, Ben, he held a succession of minor offices before entering the cabinet as president of the Board of Trade in 1855; but during the 1830s he functioned as principal whig whip, or, as Palmerston put it, &#145;joint whip with Mrs Stanley&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>Mrs Stanley, who shared her husband's sharp tongue, presided over an intellectual as well as a political salon, numbering among her friends Thomas Carlyle, F. D. Maurice, and, from 1861, Benjamin Jowett. She was one of the original &#145;lady visitors&#146; of Maurice's foundation, Queen's College, Harley Street, in 1848 and from this moved to a more general involvement in schemes for women's education, to vindicate, as she later put it, &#145;the right of women to the highest culture hitherto reserved to men&#146;  (Stanley, 314). She supported the campaign to secure the admission of women to the university local examinations; in 1865 she was one of the signatories of the memorial to the Taunton commission asking for the inclusion of girls' schools in their inquiries. In 1867 she declined an invitation to join the committee planning a women's university college: &#145;it is not liked to see my name before the public&#146;  (Stephen, 162); but the death of her husband on 16 June 1869 enlarged her freedom of action. She was an energetic member of the National Union for the Improvement of Women's Education, founded in 1871, and of its offspring, the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94164', "Girls' Public Day School Company")</script> (1872); and from 1874 she campaigned for the Medical College for Women which eventually found a home at the Royal Free Hospital. She wrote of her campaigns in an article, &#145;Personal recollections of women's education&#146;, in <span class="italic">The Nineteenth Century</span>, August 1879.<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1872 the invitation to involve herself more formally in the affairs of what was to become Girton College had been renewed and Lady Stanley accepted, becoming a signatory of the Girton memorandum and articles of association on 15 May 1872 and joining the building subcommittee. For the remainder of her life she gave generously of her time and her money to Girton, taking a turn at standing in as mistress when Mrs Austin's health broke down while the college was still at Hitchin; taking gifts to the first students on the Girton site; donating &pound;1000 for the library which now bears her name, a chemical laboratory, a lodge for the head gardener, and many other smaller items. The students appreciated the warmth and wholehearted commitment which lay behind Lady Stanley's plain speech and no-nonsense manners; and she had the further advantage of an unassailable social position, so important to an enterprise thought by many people to be daring and by others to be downright scandalous. She herself put the qualities to be sought in a mistress of the college in the following order: &#145;social position, good sense and power of governing and conciliating&#146;  (Stephen, 271). She was one of the few members of the Girton executive committee able to stand up to the founder, Emily Davies; and from 1890 until her death in 1895 she blocked a further round of building schemes, including a chapel, to which she was deeply opposed. She campaigned instead for the improvement of staff salaries and equipment.<br>
<br>Lady Stanley retained her interest and involvement in politics, breaking with W. E. Gladstone over home rule and becoming a moving spirit in the Women's Liberal Unionist Association. Her four sons and six daughters included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36246/', "Henry Edward John Stanley, third Baron Stanley of Alderley")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36244/', "Edward Lyulph Stanley")</script> (her favourite), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45676/', "Maude Alethea Stanley")</script>, Blanche, countess of Airlie, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41338/', "Katharine (Kate) Russell, Viscountess Amberley")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34022/', "Rosalind Howard, countess of Carlisle")</script>; and they formed a close-knit but energetic and noisy family circle. Bertrand Russell, who feared his grandmother's biting tongue, retained an abiding memory of the arguments at the Sunday luncheon table over which his grandmother presided at 40 Dover Street in London: &#145;invariably they wrangled about some impersonal subject, such as Home Rule or the existence of Adam and Eve. The din used to alarm me, but they enjoyed it, and were the best of friends with each other&#146;  (<span class="italic">Amberley Papers</span>, 1.13). She died at 40 Dover Street on 16 February 1895.<br>
