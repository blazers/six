<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hetherington, Sir  Thomas Chalmers <span class="st"> [Tony]</span></span>  (1926&#150;2007), <span class="occ">lawyer and civil servant</span>, was born on 18 September 1926 at 4 Francis Street, Langholm, Dumfriesshire, the elder son and eldest of three children of William Maxwell Hetherington, medical practitioner, and his wife, Alice Mary Cooper, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Booth. After Rugby School he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery from 1945 to 1948. He enjoyed his army service and remained in the Territorial Army until 1967. In 1948 he entered Christ Church, Oxford, and graduated with a second-class degree in jurisprudence in 1951. He was called to the bar by the Inner Temple the following year. On 23 May 1953 he married June Margaret Ann Catliff, a secretary three years his junior, daughter of Frank Ivor Catliff, chartered surveyor. They had four daughters.<br>
<br>In 1953 Hetherington joined the legal department of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. Nine years later he moved to the law officers' department, as part of a small team assisting the attorney-general and solicitor-general in their wide-ranging remit. In 1966 he became legal secretary, that is head of that department. The department's work included significant involvement in criminal prosecutions, many of them of considerable public interest. The experience was to serve him well. In 1970 he was appointed CBE.<br>
<br>The Treasury solicitor is the most senior government lawyer. Hetherington was his deputy for two years from 1975, with an expectation of assuming the top post when it became vacant. In the event Sir Norman Skelhorn retired unexpectedly as director of public prosecutions in 1977 and Hetherington was appointed his successor. Criminal cases of particular importance or difficulty were reported to the director's department. It was seen as requiring reform to cope more expeditiously and reliably with its increasing caseload. Hetherington had established a reputation in government circles for administrative skills combined with sound legal judgement. On assuming office he took immediate steps to bring the workload under control. The prosecution of offences regulations, detailing the cases to be referred to his office, were rewritten. Greater flexibility was introduced into the reporting mechanism, allowing the submission of abbreviated reports in some cases. At Hetherington's request the home secretary appointed more assistant directors&#151;the level at which most prosecution decisions were taken. Only cases of the utmost public interest reached Hetherington personally. The prosecution of the Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe for attempted murder, eventually resulting in acquittal, was an early example. He concerned himself, too, in a succession of terrorist and espionage prosecutions and allegations of corruption in the police service.<br>
<br>At the outset of his tenure Hetherington announced that the invariable response of &#145;no comment&#146; to media inquiries must change; information that could be given would be given. He maintained the friendly relations with legal journalists formed in the law officers' department. In 1981 he allowed the BBC broad access to the department to prepare a <span class="italic">Panorama</span> programme. In 1983 he authorized a &#145;warts and all&#146; study of the department's workings by the Oxford Centre for Criminological Research. He, his staff, and departmental files were made freely available. The research was influential in the code for crown prosecutors, published in 1986 when the crown prosecution service came into existence. Hetherington's approach to openness, and much else in his style of management, permeated the service during the tenure of each of his several successors.<br>
<br>After Hetherington's early reforms there followed a several-year period of calm before the storm. He was appointed KCB in 1979. In 1981 the royal commission on criminal procedure, chaired by Sir Cyril Phillips, presented its report. Its most radical recommendation was that locally appointed, independent crown prosecutors should take over the conduct of most prosecutions from the police. A Home Office working party, including Hetherington, was established to advise on the government's response. The working party's report was annexed to a white paper published in October 1983. Instead of the locally based structure advocated by the royal commission the government accepted the working party's recommendation of a national service, with offices throughout England and Wales. The <span class="roman">Prosecution of Offences Act</span> 1985 laid the foundations of that service. Conveniently sized areas of England and Wales were each to be headed by a chief crown prosecutor reporting to the director of public prosecutions. The establishment of the crown prosecution service was Hetherington's major preoccupation for the remainder of his term of office.<br>
<br>There were concerns that a nationally structured service would create an unwieldy bureaucracy, with decisions of any moment concentrated at the service's headquarters in London. These concerns were comprehensively dispelled by the publication in December 1984, during the passage through parliament of the <span class="roman">Prosecution of Offences Bill</span>, of a white paper reflecting Hetherington's determination that the overwhelming bulk of casework, of all degrees of complexity and gravity, should be handled in local offices. He believed, then and in his earlier senior positions, that if people could demonstrate an appetite and aptitude for responsibility they should have it. Staff found this a motivating stance. Hetherington was a popular first head of the crown prosecution service, despite the burdens created by the initial acute shortages of funding and staff. Through the considerable personal loyalty thus engendered, a service with thirty-one area offices, about ninety branch offices, and several thousand staff could be launched in 1986, remarkably soon after the government announced its proposals three years earlier, and only one year after the enabling legislation was passed.<br>
<br>During his term as director of public prosecutions Hetherington was a member of the Criminal Law Revision Committee. The reports of the committee underlay various statutes of central importance in the criminal justice field. He wrote of his time as director in <span class="italic">Prosecution and the Public Interest</span> (1989). Meanwhile, shortly after his retirement in 1988, he and William Chalmers, his Scottish counterpart, were appointed to inquire into the feasibility of prosecuting persons then resident in the UK for German war crimes in the Second World War. Their report led to the highly contentious <span class="roman">War Crimes Act</span> 1991. The advanced ages and infirmity of potential defendants meant that only two prosecutions were practicable.<br>
<br>Tony Hetherington was a tall man of genial appearance, entirely consistent with his warm and wholly unstuffy personality. He had a lively sense of humour reflected in an infectious chuckle. A journalist said he &#145;made a well-cut suit look lived in&#146;. Whatever the cares of office, any mention of his four daughters brought a twinkle to his eyes. His private office had standing instructions that calls from his family must be put through immediately, whatever his commitments. He took a genuine interest in the families and concerns of his staff, irrespective of their seniority. He and his wife lived at Lingfield in Surrey throughout their married life. He was much involved in the development of a fine community centre there. In his latter years he suffered from a gradually more debilitating neurological illness. His wife, June, cared for him with total commitment until his death, following a stroke, at Tandridge Heights Memorial Care Home, Oxted, Surrey, on 28 March 2007.<br>
