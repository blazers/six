<span class="headword">Reynell family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1540&#150;1735), <span class="occ">gentry</span>, descended from Hugh of Malston who held the manor of East Ogwell, near Newton Abbott in the east of Devon, in the reign of Edward II. Three generations later Margaret, his great-granddaughter and the Malston heir married Walter [i] Reynell of Bradlingham in Cambridgeshire, a descendant of the Richard Reinell who served as sheriff of Devon in the late 1190s and held the custody of Launceston and Exeter castles. The direct descendant of this marriage was Walter [ii] (1475&#150;1540) who divided his estate between his two older sons. In 1511 he granted the use of the manor of East Ogwell to his heir, John (1488&#150;1547), and his wife, Margery, daughter of William Fortescue of Wood. Then about 1522 the younger son, Thomas [i], and his wife, Cecily, were granted the use of the manor of Malston, further south near Kingsbridge. So arose the two distinct branches of the Reynell family. John Reynell added lands in the parish of North Bovey to the East Ogwell estate. He died on 6 December 1547 and was succeeded briefly by his eldest son, Walter [iii], who was born in 1518 and died childless.<h2>
<a name="Fatherandeldestson"></a>Father and eldest son</h2>
<a name="cosubject_77110"></a><span class="headword">Richard [i] Reynell</span>  (1519&#150;1585)<span class="occ"></span> of East Ogwell, as the second son of John and Margery Reynell, pursued an adventurous early career of travel and military exploits. He journeyed to Hungary to fight the Turks and was present at the siege of Boulogne. He led a troop of horse in the western rebellion of 1549, was seriously wounded in the action to relieve Plymouth, and was rewarded with lands at Weston Peverell. His brother Walter [iii] was still alive about 1550 when Richard married Agnes, daughter of Thomas Southgate but had presumably died before Richard began to purchase more land in 1555, in particular West Ogwell. In April 1558 Reynell was appointed a captain to defend the county against the French. He sued for a pardon in January 1559 but was trusted enough to begin his long service as a JP later that year, and set a tradition of county service for his descendants. He was sheriff at the time of his death on 29 July 1585. He was survived by five sons, a distinguished generation of whom four were knighted, and two daughters.<br>
<br>The eldest son of Richard and Agnes Reynell, <a name="cosubject_77111"></a><span class="headword">Sir Thomas [ii] Reynell</span>  (1555&#150;1618)<span class="occ"></span>, entered the Middle Temple with his brother Josias on 13 May 1574. At this time he wrote letters and poems of a devotional nature to his father. He may have pursued a legal career as he refers to himself as &#145;at law at London&#146; in 1585  (Devon RO, 4652M/F5/1). He kept a slight diary which was continued by his descendants. A typed copy of the original exists and shows that his life centred round his house at West Ogwell which he began building in 1589. Two years later he planted a pear garden and set a row of elms before the house. He consolidated the family estate by buying back land in North Bovey left to his brothers and also purchased Morleigh. He was seldom out of the county: one exception was in July 1603 when he was knighted at Whitehall with his younger brother George [i].<br>
<br>Sir Thomas's public service revolved round his position on the bench from 1588. The quarter session records survive from 1592 and show him attending nearly every meeting. He was also active in taking recognizances and pursuing matters of local concern such as presenting highways in need of repair. The war with Spain made other demands on him. In July 1596 he passed on information gained from merchants to Secretary Robert Cecil. In 1599 he served as a regimental officer and as acting deputy lieutenant in place of his cousin Sir George Carey who was treasurer-at-war in Ireland. Reynell's band and Sir George's guarded Torbay against a possible Spanish invasion.<br>
<br>Sir Thomas married Frances, daughter of John Aylworth, esquire, of London and Polsloe on 3 March 1584. She died on 4 July 1605, survived by three sons and five daughters. On 9 February 1607 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Henry Killigrew and widow of Sir Jonathan Trelawny; they had one son. Sir Thomas died on 8 April 1618 and was buried in the chancel of East Ogwell next to his first wife. His widow returned to Cornwall and soon married for a third time.<h2>
<a name="Youngerbrothers"></a>Younger brothers</h2>Josias the second son of Richard and Agnes Reynell died unmarried (1556&#150;1614). Their third son and fourth child, <a name="cosubject_77112"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard [ii] Reynell</span>  (<em>c.</em>1558&#150;1634)<span class="occ"></span>, became a barrister and was the autumn reader of the Middle Temple in 1617. In 1593 he was a clerk in the office of the lord treasurer's remembrancer and ended his career there as a secondary. It was probably he, rather than Richard [iv] Reynell of Creedy, who was MP for Mitchell in 1593. His wife <a name="cosubject_77116"></a><span class="headword">Lucy Reynell</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1577, <em>d.</em> 1652)<span class="occ"></span>, whom he married in 1600, was the daughter of Robert Brandon, a London merchant. Richard [ii] was able to purchase and enlarge Forde House in the parish of Wolborough, where the life of his wife records that he collected a great library of works of scholarship, befitting a man notable for &#145;depth of learning and tongues&#146;. He was knighted at Theobalds on 25 July 1622, the year in which his only child, Jane, married Sir William Waller (later the parliamentary general) and &#145;had a very great marriage of her&#146;  (Devon RO, 4652M/F5/1). Sir Richard died in 1634 and was buried on 25 January at Wolborough. His lands were inherited by Margaret, only surviving child of Jane, who married Sir William Courtenay.<br>
<br>Lucy Reynell lived until 18 April 1652. Her character was extolled in the <span class="italic">Life and Death of the Religious and Virtuous Lady</span> by Edward Reynell. This book reveals her attitude to the religious changes of her times, she &#145;warily avoided Superstition on one side and Faction on the other&#146; and refused to make new friends by changing her old religion. She strictly observed the sabbath and all fasts and instructed the members of her household. She also managed a &#145;good spread table&#146; and entertained &#145;such persons of quality as resorted to her house&#146;&#151;her guests included the king and his household in 1625. When at leisure she worked on tapestry and made clothes for the poor. She built a home for four widows of ministers who were granted &pound;5 p.a. in perpetuity. A charity still exists in her name.<br>
<br>The two youngest sons of Richard and Agnes Reynell, George and Carew, cut their ties with Devon, selling the land inherited from their father to their brother Sir Thomas. George then embarked on three years of travel and Carew made his way at court. In 1597 George Reynell acquired the office of warden of the Fleet prison when he married Elizabeth, daughter of Valentine Browne of Lincolnshire and widow of Edward Tyrell, the previous warden. Later he became marshall of king's bench and was the object of several petitions against his conduct in this office, which he left to Carewe, his only son from his first marriage. Sir George (as he had become in 1603) made a second marriage to Ethelred, daughter of Sir Edward Peacock of Finchley, with whom he had three sons and one daughter. He died in July 1628.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_77113"></a><span class="headword">Sir Carew Reynell</span>  (<em>c.</em>1563&#150;1624)<span class="occ"></span> was a gentleman pensioner of Elizabeth and James. He enjoyed the patronage both of Sir Robert Cecil and of the second earl of Essex, with whom he sailed on the &#145;islands voyage&#146; of 1597. In 1599 he took a foot company to Ireland, where he was knighted by the earl and entrusted with the keeping of the castle and fort of Duncannon. His association with Essex caused his imprisonment early in 1601, but he was soon cleared of any implication in Essex's rebellion. He had been a member of the parliament of 1593 for Callington, but was returned for Lancaster in 1601 (when he made a speech in the Commons attacking sabbath-breakers) and later for Wallingford in 1614 and Cricklade in 1621. He also gained several profitable offices. He died on 7 September 1624 and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields. He had married Susanna, widow of Michael Erneley and daughter of Walter Hungerford of Farley Castle, Wiltshire. He left the earl of Essex a tablet jewel set with more than eighty diamonds, with a picture of the earl's father and &pound;30 in cash to prepare the jewel for the picture in &#145;Remembrance and full satisfaction of all the favour and benefits which I received from his most noble father&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/144, fols. 201<i>v</i>&#150;202<i>r</i>).<h2>
<a name="Thecivilwargeneration"></a>The civil war generation</h2>
<a name="cosubject_56084"></a><span class="headword">Sir Richard [iii] Reynell</span>  (1584&#150;1649)<span class="occ"></span>, eldest son of Sir Thomas [ii] Reynell, was born at East Ogwell. In 1596 he and his brother Thomas [iii] attended a school at Ashburton; he then went to Exeter College, Oxford, in 1602 and to the Middle Temple two years later. He married Mary, eldest daughter of Richard [iv] Reynell of Creedy, on 12 January 1617. His marriage added Holbeame to his family estates, and he was also rich enough to purchase Ogwell Petyven, part of the parish of East Ogwell. On 5 September 1625 Richard and Thomas were knighted by the king at Ford. The former had followed his father onto the commission of the peace and was almost as assiduous in his attendance. The Reynell presence was strong at quarter sessions; apart from his father-in-law's connection, his sister Francis married Charles Vaughan, clerk of the peace, while another sister, Lucy, married James Welsh, a JP between 1614 and 1647.<br>
<br>Sir Richard [iii] Reynell achieved the higher county position of deputy lieutenant in 1629 but was not a militia officer. He was on the commission of array of 1642 but took no part in the civil war because of illness and from November 1644 &#145;kept to his chamber&#146; suffering from a bladder complaint and thought it &#145;some mitigation of his affliction that it discharged him from being interested in public affairs&#146;. He was &#145;very adverse to blood and of a quiet and graceful disposition&#146;  (Devon RO, 4652M/F5/1). Sir Richard's first wife died in childbed on 5 July 1626. She had with him nine children, but only two sons and two daughters survived infancy. He married as his second wife in December 1636, Dorothy, the widow of Sir John Chudleigh. She died in March 1642 and was buried at East Ogwell, the first member of the family to be interred in the new vault that Sir Richard had built in the aisle of East Ogwell church in 1633, where he was also buried on 13 February 1649.<br>
<br>The younger sons of Sir Thomas [ii] Reynell and Francis Reynell followed careers at court and in the army. Thomas [iii] Reynell (1589&#150;1665) claimed in 1660 that he had served faithfully in the office of sewer in ordinary for fifty years and suffered much. He lost the grant he had held of the farm of wine licences in Devon, Cornwall, and Exeter and was fined &pound;630 for living in the king's quarters at Oxford. He had been the member for Morpeth in the parliaments of 1624&#150;9. He married Katherine, daughter of Sir Henry Spiller, and had houses in Weybridge and the Strand. His younger brother, Walter [iv], was born at West Ogwell on 10 March 1591. He served under Count Mansfeld and as a captain under Buckingham on the &Icirc;le de R&eacute;, where he was killed in 1627. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23400/', "Edward Reynell")</script>, only child of Sir Thomas's second marriage, was educated at Exeter College, Oxford, became rector of West Ogwell and published several religous works. He committed suicide in 1663, soon after the deaths of his son and daughter.<h2>
<a name="Connectionsandconclusion"></a>Connections and conclusion</h2>The one notable member of the Malston branch of the family was <a name="cosubject_77114"></a><span class="headword">Richard [iv] Reynell</span>  (<em>c.</em>1565&#150;1631)<span class="occ"></span> of Creedy, the fourth son of George [ii] Reynell and Joan, daughter of Lewis Fortescue, a baron of the exchequer. He was the grandson of Thomas [i] and Cecily Reynell. In 1593 he made a profitable marriage to Mary, daughter and coheir of John Periam, twice mayor of Exeter. He was called to the bar on 8 February 1594 and became a bencher and autumn reader in 1614. He was a JP from 1603, attended quarter sessions as regularly as his Ogwell relatives, and was more active in taking examinations and drawing up recognizances. He served as the first recorder of Bradninch until he moved to Creedywiger, just outside Crediton, when his wife inherited the estate in 1618, and spent over &pound;4000 consolidating it. He had a house in Exeter and sometimes acted on behalf of the city. Even though their estates were some distance apart, there were close contacts between the Ogwell and Creedy families which began before they were more intimately linked by the marriage of Richard of Creedy's eldest daughter Mary to Sir Richard [iii] of East Ogwell. Neither of Richard of Creedy's sons married, so a quarter of his estate passed to the Ogwell family by the right of Mary as a coheir. His memorial representing him and his wife kneeling in prayer, survives in Upton Hellions church.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_77115"></a><span class="headword">Thomas [iv] Reynell</span>  (1624&#150;1698)<span class="occ"></span> was the eldest surviving son of Sir Richard [iii] Reynell of East Ogwell and his wife, Mary. On 5 October 1640 he was admitted to Exeter College, Oxford, and stayed in the lodgings of the rector, John Prideaux, who had married his aunt Mary and may well have influenced his religious thinking. He went on to the Middle Temple and was called to the bar in 1649. On 30 June 1648 he married Mary Bennett, niece of Lady Croke, widow of Sir George Croke, judge of the king's bench. They lived with her until they moved to West Ogwell on 6 April 1650.<br>
<br>Thomas Reynell sat on the bench from 1647 through all the changes of government until 1676, when he was removed at the request of the earl of Bath, but even so was appointed sheriff in 1677. On 22 May 1685 he was arrested at his house at night &#145;to appear before Council to answer for treasonable practices&#146;  (Devon RO, 4652M/F5/1) but no grounds could be found for convicting him. He was restored to the bench in October 1687 and resumed the same conscientious attendance characteristic of his family. A later member of his family wrote in the diary that he was &#145;a hearty well wisher of Revolution&#146; and entertained at West Ogwell part of the company that &#145;attended our Deliverance&#146; in 1688. He was MP for Devon in 1654 and 1656 and for Ashburton, a borough with a considerable dissenting party, in 1659 and again in 1677, 1679, 1681, and 1689. His younger brother, Sir Richard [v], baronet (1625&#150;1699), who had been deprived of his judgeship of the Irish king's bench, held the seat in 1690.<br>
<br>Thomas Reynell's first wife had died in September 1671, survived by their two daughters. On 28 July 1673 he married Elizabeth, widow of William Vincent and daughter of James Gould of Exeter, merchant. Thomas Reynell died on 15 January 1698. His eldest son, Richard [iv] Reynell (1677&#150;1735), did not marry and was predeceased by his younger brother, so the Reynell estates passed to Rebecca Taylor, the daughter of his half-sister Mary.<br>
