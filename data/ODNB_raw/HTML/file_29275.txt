<div class="para">
<span class="headword">White,  Thomas</span>  (1628&#150;1698), <span class="occ">bishop of Peterborough and nonjuror</span>, was born at Allington, Kent, the son of Peter White, who died shortly after Thomas's birth. Records of his university career record the family as of &#145;plebeian&#146; rank; his mother may have been a kinswoman of a local gentry family, the Brockmans of Beachborough, and may have gone to live with them after her husband's death. White was educated for three years at Wye School under the mastership of Mr Surety-on-high (or Suretonhie) Nicholls. He was then admitted sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, at the age of fourteen, on 29 October 1642, graduating BA in 1647. His life during the interregnum remains obscure. Despite the confusion caused by so common a name, it is clear that he was neither the lecturer of St Andrew's, Holborn, who wrote an account of the conversion of a Muslim in 1658 (<i>d</i>. 1672), nor the rector of St Mary-at-Hill, London (<i>d</i>. 1682), who both shared his name. However, he appears for certain at the Restoration, when his successful petition of 6 July 1660 to the king for presentation to the vicarage of Newark-on-Trent, occupied by an &#145;intruder&#146;, won the support of no less a person than Gilbert Sheldon. He held the Newark living until 1666, when he assumed the rectorship of All-Hallows-at-Fenn, London, which he kept until 1679, when he took up the rectory of Bottesford in Leicestershire, which he held until 1685; he also became rector of Stepney in 1681.<br>
<br>The elevation of White's career profile from the parochial to the diocesan level was signalled with his promotion as archdeacon of Nottingham (1683&#150;5). In the year that he took up the archdeaconry, and typifying his closeness to the high tory reversionary interest around James, duke of York, he was created DD of Oxford on 4 June 1683&#151;even though he was primarily a preacher&#151;a &#145;very eloquent&#146; one, according to Evelyn  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 383)&#151;and a diocesan administrator rather than a scholar. However, White was chaplain to York's protestant daughter, the Lady Anne, and the conferment, fully supported by the tory grandee Ormond, took place amid a triumphalist tour of the York family to tory Oxford. White's next move upwards was made when the tory cast of ecclesiastical and episcopal appointments devised as a deliberate strategy during the tory reaction was continued and capped by his consecration as bishop of Peterborough on 25 October 1685. Typifying his energy and reformist drive, in 1686 he carried out for Archbishop Sancroft a metropolitical visitation of the Lincoln diocese belonging to the allegedly negligent Bishop Thomas Barlow, finding the clergy of that diocese immoral and negligent and the lay linchpins of the parochial system, the churchwardens, &#145;hardened in their foolish obstinacy&#146;  (Spurr, 193).<br>
<br>Dedicated churchman and committed tory royalist as he was, White was soon to be confronted with the fatal dilemma presented to such as him by James's adoption, markedly from 1687, of toleration: he &#145;could not but remember how vehemently the King had declared against toleration and said he would never by any counsel be tempted to suffer it&#146;  (Western, 186&#150;7); he took particular umbrage at the threat to the church from indulgence to the dissenters, for he saw little danger from &#145;popery&#146;  (ibid., 230) and had, indeed, taken part in the administration of the London diocese of Bishop Henry Compton, suspended in 1686 for his refusal to suppress Catholic preaching in the city. It was James II's second declaration of indulgence, offering civil and religious rights to non-Anglicans, but required to be read from the pulpits of the very Church of England whose specially protected status it endangered, that impelled White to lead other prominent Anglican malcontents&#151;and above all those of the high tory Yorkist grouping around Sancroft&#151;in resistance to the declaration, beginning with a meeting of leading clerics at the Temple in London on 12 May 1688. White's prominence in the campaign was flanked by the role of Bishop Francis Turner of Ely who, with White, was co-ordinating information between 12 and 18 May on the overwhelming clerical refusals of the reading order and also of rejection of it by nonconformist chiefs; he was also supported by the enthusiasm for the resistance of his dean at Peterborough, Simon Patrick, who, on 17 May, drew up a list of ministers who would not read the declaration, which schedule White took to Sancroft. The following day the recalcitrants drew up a final version of a petition to the king and, in the evening, the seven episcopal leaders of opposition took it to James, who was astonished at the disobedience of his commands by the Anglican clerics whose protestations of total obedience to royal authority he had taken at face value.<br>
<br>On 27 May in a summons to appear before the king in council the names of White and Turner, along with that of Sancroft, were highlighted among those of the other presenters of the offending petition. The examination was followed by imprisonment in the Tower on 8 June and trial on a charge of seditious libel on 29 June, leading to acquittal on the 30th.<br>
<br>On 24 September, in what was, no doubt, an attempt at a placatory strategy on James's part, White, with Sancroft and seven other bishops, was invited by the earl of Sunderland to confer with the king. Following Orange's landing he and William Lloyd (1627&#150;1717) of St Asaph were involved with the tory politicians Rochester and Clarendon in plans to petition the king for a parliament intended to prevent bloodshed, and on 17 November White signed such a petition; remaining at the central steerage of events, he was one of a small group who managed&#151;initially, at least&#151;to persuade Sancroft to join a meeting of peers held in London so as to manage the situation in December 1688, and in January of the new year he was at the archbishop's in discussion of &#145;the present state of the publique&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 896). He is said, somewhat improbably, to have authored&#151;but certainly did not take&#151;the new oath of allegiance to William and Mary, yet despite his refusal he continued to be allowed early in the new year to speak in committees of the Lords. In March his political campaign in defence of the interest of his church took a new tack when he promoted comprehension of protestants within a broad national establishment of religion. However, his status as a leading nonjuror resulted in his displacement from his episcopate, which Evelyn reported on 16 April 1691.<br>
<br>In the remainder of the 1690s White played a part in the attempted creation of a nonjuror Church of England, hosting a consecration of a new nonjuring bishop (nominated by the exiled James II) in February 1694 [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/47712', "Nonjuring bishops")</script>]. He was also rumoured to have composed a statement made by the Jacobite conspirator Fenwick protesting his loyalty to James along with his refusal to countenance violence against William. Following White's death in London on 29 May 1698 his funeral and burial at St Paul's on 4 June provided an opportunity for nonjuring Anglicans to commemorate a martyr both to divine right principles and to defence of the church against a king. He was a generous benefactor of Newark and of the poor of Peterborough.<br>
