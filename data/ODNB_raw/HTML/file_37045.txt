<span class="headword">Wrottesley, Sir  Frederic John</span>  (1880&#150;1948), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 20 March 1880 in Hampstead, London, the third son of the Revd Francis John Wrottesley (1848&#150;1922), then a curate in Hampstead and later vicar of Denstone, Staffordshire, a great-nephew of the first Baron Wrottesley, and his wife, Agnes Mabel Stilwell (<i>d</i>. 1917), daughter of Frederic John Freeland. He was a kinsman of George Wrottesley. Educated at Tonbridge School and at Lincoln College, Oxford, where he was a classical scholar, Wrottesley gave to both institutions a wholehearted devotion then and later. He obtained a second class in classical moderations in 1901 and a third in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1903, and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1907. He won rapid success in the charmed circle of the parliamentary bar, but his career was interrupted by the First World War when he was commissioned in the Royal Field Artillery, serving in France, attaining the rank of major, and being mentioned in dispatches. On 26 November 1915 he married Marion Cecil (<i>d</i>. 1955), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel William Patterson of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry; they had no children.<br>
<br>Wrottesley became a KC in 1926 and in 1930 was made recorder of Wolverhampton. In 1931 he was chairman of the gas legislation committee appointed by the Board of Trade to inquire into the working of the basic price system for gas companies, and in 1936 he conducted an inquiry into the marketing of sugar beet. His experience of the parliamentary bar familiarized him closely with many matters of local government. He was a good friend to the teachers of law and much interested in his subject from the academic angle, and he was no stranger to legal authorship: his works <span class="italic">The Examination of Witnesses in Court</span> (1910) and <span class="italic">Letters to a Young Barrister</span> (1930) won golden opinions from the profession.<br>
<br>It was on the bench that Wrottesley's career came to its full maturity. He was appointed a judge of the King's Bench Division and knighted in 1937. Despite his learning and common sense, some doubted whether one who had practised exclusively in the parliamentary bar would acquit himself well when confronted with problems of ordinary criminal and civil law. Such fears were groundless. At the very outset of his judicial career a supreme test awaited him in the shape of a case involving that very difficult piece of legislation, the <span class="roman">Truck Act</span> of 1831, and incidentally also a matter connected with the statute of limitation then in force. The case was <i>Pratt v. Cook</i> (1938). His judgment on the point of the operation of the <span class="roman">Truck Act</span> was reversed by a divided Court of Appeal which was, however, unanimous in approving his view on the period of limitation. Then in 1940 his entire judgment was restored by the House of Lords. This achievement set the seal on his judicial reputation, and he was ever afterwards regarded as a learned, careful, and just judge&#151;possessed of that undefinable quality, the true judicial temperament.<br>
<br>Wrottesley's success on the civil side inspired professional optimism about his success on the criminal side; nor was it disappointed. His lack of previous experience of crime and criminals seemed to constitute no bar to his understanding of the problems involved. He took the trouble to study criminology, together with the history and practice of the prison system, and to get acquainted with those concerned in the daily administration of the multiplicity of matters affecting punishment and probation. By characteristic efforts he acquired a profound knowledge of the ramifications of criminal law itself, and rapidly took his place in the foremost rank of criminal judges. Perhaps the most interesting of his decisions, from a legal point of view, was <i>R. v. Jarmain</i> (1946), where he applied what might be called the doctrine of &#145;follow through&#146;. It was in a sense an extension of the doctrine of constructive crime, whereby a person who causes the death of another person in the course of committing a crime involving violence is guilty of murder; for here the crime, theft, had been committed after the death. Wrottesley, delivering the judgment of the court of criminal appeal affirming Jarmain's conviction for murder, ruled that a person who uses violent measures in the commission of a crime does so at his own risk, and is guilty of murder even though the death of the victim were caused by inadvertence and were interposed, in point of time, between the attempt at the felony and its ultimate consummation.<br>
<br>In a leading case which he tried Wrottesley held that evidence of strikingly similar facts could be put before the jury provided that the evidence was more probative than prejudicial&#151;for example, a multiplicity or series of charges of strikingly similar criminal homosexual acts could be tried together. His ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeal (<i>R. v. Sims</i>, 1946).<br>
<br>In 1947 Wrottesley was raised to the Court of Appeal and sworn of the privy council, a promotion which gave rise to widespread satisfaction. But he was destined to enjoy only a short tenure for in 1948 growing ill health forced his resignation. He had, however, occupied it long enough to complete what many would regard as the crowning achievements of his career in the fields of equity and constitutional law, for he was a member of the court which prepared the elaborate judgment in <i>Re Diplock</i> (1948). Trustees of a will had, in obedience to its provisions, distributed the testator's property among charities. This action turned out to have been premature, since one of the next of kin succeeded in convincing the House of Lords that the will did not create a valid charitable bequest. The Court of Appeal in a long and learned judgment held that the next of kin were entitled to recover from the recipients the money thus wrongly paid away. In <i>R. v. Chancellor of St. Edmundsbury and Ipswich Diocese</i> (1948), Wrottesley read the judgment of the court, which laid down that while the King's Bench Division can issue an order for prohibition, it cannot issue an order for <i>certiorari</i> to an ecclesiastical court.<br>
<br>Wrottesley was a bencher of his inn, master of the Skinners' Company (1940&#150;41), and an honorary fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, which was always one of the main interests of his life, and which he was always more than ready to help with his wise advice. He was the most prudent of counsellors and the truest of friends. He died on 14 November 1948 at his home, Manor Farm, Newnham, near Basingstoke, Hampshire.<br>
