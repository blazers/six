<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hoadly,  Benjamin</span>  (1676&#150;1761), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, was born on 14 November 1676 at Westerham in Kent, the sixth of the nine children of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13378/', "Revd Samuel Hoadly (1643&#150;1705)")</script>, schoolmaster at Westerham, and his second wife, Martha (1639&#150;1703), the daughter of Benjamin Pickering. He came from a strongly puritan and clerical family. His paternal grandfather, John Hoadly, had emigrated to New England in Charles I's reign before returning to Scotland in the 1650s to become chaplain of Edinburgh Castle, while his maternal grandfather had been a member of the Westminster assembly. His uncle John was rector of Halsted, Kent, and his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13376/', "John Hoadly (1678&#150;1746)")</script> also pursued a clerical career, rising to become archbishop of Armagh. <h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>In 1678 the family moved to Tottenham High Cross, Middlesex, and thence in 1686 to Brook House school in Hackney. Benjamin was educated at home by his father and acquired a reputation as an excellent musician. On 18 February 1692 he entered St Catharine's College, Cambridge, as a pensioner. It was at this time, according to his son, that he contracted smallpox and the intervention of an unskilful surgeon left him crippled  (<span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, 99). For the rest of his life he used crutches to walk at home and sticks in public, kneeling on a stool in order to preach. He was indulged seven terms on account of his serious illness, before graduating BA in 1695 and MA in 1699. Hoadly was ordained deacon by Henry Compton, bishop of London, in December 1698 and priest on 22 December 1700, almost certainly on the title of the fellowship of St Catharine's, to which he had been elected in 1697. In 1699 he became tutor and praelector, but two years later he resigned his fellowship, probably on the occasion of his marriage, on 30 May 1701, to Sarah Curtis (1676?&#150;1743), a portrait painter of some reputation who had trained under Mary Beale [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13379/', "Hoadly, Sarah")</script>]. Together they had five sons: Samuel (<i>b</i>. 1703), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13374/', "Benjamin Hoadly (1706&#150;1757)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13377/', "John Hoadly (1711&#150;1776)")</script>, and two who were stillborn.<br>
<br>In 1701 Hoadly was appointed to the lectureship of St Mildred Poultry, serving at the same time as curate to William Hodges at St Swithin's. His first published work was a sermon preached at St Swithin's on 2 September 1702, the anniversary of the great fire, warning in conventional providential language that London was once again threatened by the wrath of God. In the following year Hoadly identified himself much more clearly with whig and low-church opinions. First, in a sermon delivered on 30 January, he not only omitted any direct reference to the execution of Charles I but also implied his support for the comprehension of moderate dissenters within the Church of England by yielding &#145;Things of little Importance &hellip; for the sake of a greater Union&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.661). Then, in November, he wrote a tract defending the bishops who had voted against the <span class="roman">Occasional Conformity Bill</span>, arguing again for a comprehension and defending the practice of occasional conformity as a support of protestant unity.<br>
<br>Between the publication of these two tracts Hoadly produced a far more substantial work, <span class="italic">The Reasonableness of Conformity to the Church of England</span> (1703), an answer to the defence of dissenting separation by the eminent Presbyterian Edmund Calamy in his <span class="italic">Abridgment</span> (1702) of Richard Baxter's <span class="italic">History of his Life</span>. The ensuing controversy lasted until 1707 and included four further tracts from Hoadly, most notably <span class="italic">A Persuasive to Lay-Conformity</span> (1704) and <span class="italic">A Brief Defense of Episcopal Ordination</span> (1707). At first sight this pamphlet might appear to sit uneasily alongside the rest of Hoadly's <i>&#339;uvre</i>; Archbishop Thomas Herring certainly found it hard to reconcile with his famous sermon on the kingdom of Christ. It condemned the dissenters' separation as leading unavoidably to &#145;Confusion and Disorder, Indecency in the Worship of God, Irregularity, Strife, and Emulation, Heat, and Passion, Ill-will, and Malice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.264). Its arguments were powerful enough to be instrumental in convincing the leading New England high-churchman Samuel Johnson to abandon Congregationalism.<br>
<br>In fact Hoadly's position was based on sound low-church principles. His tract was aimed at the moderate nonconformists, who supported the ideal of a national church, and he argued that it was &#145;unaccountable, and inconsistent, to <i>separate</i> from an <i>imperfect</i> Church, in order <i>to press a farther Reformation</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.262). He accepted that the constitution of the Church of England was imperfect and declared that he favoured some reform himself. Crucially, however, he provided a strong defence of the church on one of the major issues in dispute with the Presbyterians: the government of the church by bishops. He denied that episcopacy was <i>jure divino</i> and thus &#145;<i>essential</i> to a <i>Christian Church</i>&#146;. However, he did argue that the practice was of apostolical origin, that it was supported by tradition, and that it was binding on the church unless &#145;<i>Imitation</i> is unpracticable&#146;  (ibid., 477). Thus he refused to condemn the foreign reformed churches and, unlike most high-churchmen, he accepted the validity of Presbyterian ordination during the interregnum. <h2>
<a name="RectorofStPeterlePoer17041716"></a>Rector of St Peter-le-Poer, 1704&#150;1716</h2>In March 1704 Hoadly was appointed to the rectory of St Peter-le-Poer by the dean and chapter of St Paul's, apparently on the recommendation of the dean, William Sherlock, whose son Thomas had been Hoadly's contemporary at St Catharine's. In later life there was considerable rivalry between Hoadly and Thomas Sherlock, who were widely regarded as the leaders of rival parties in the church. At this time, however, there was no hint of any animosity, and William Sherlock had assisted Hoadly in the composition of his <span class="italic">Letter to the Reverend Mr Fleetwood, Occasioned by his Late Essay on Miracles</span> (1702). In this pamphlet Hoadly took issue with Fleetwood's claim that only God could work miracles, but at the same time he strongly defended their importance as one among a number of the evidences of true religion, concluding that it was clear that Christ was sent from God because of the &#145;<i>long uninterrupted Series of great Miracles</i>&#146; that he performed  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.14). Far from alienating Fleetwood, who was himself a rising star among whig low-churchmen, the <span class="italic">Letter</span> secured his admiration, and his recommendation also played a part in Hoadly's preferment.<br>
<br>As the new rector of St Peter-le-Poer one of Hoadly's first acts was to preach a sermon on 8 March, the anniversary of Queen Anne's accession. Published at the request of his parishioners, this was a rallying cry to the whigs directed against &#145;the Abuses of that Day&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.620). Praising the achievements of William III, he reminded his audience that Anne's title was dependent on the revolution settlement, as William's had been, and called on her subjects to &#145;pursue the Paths of Peace, and Union&#146; and &#145;to entertain &hellip; a true Christian <i>Moderation</i>&#146;  (ibid., 2.108). This sermon brought Hoadly to the attention of Sarah Churchill, duchess of Marlborough, who pressed the queen to give him a prebend at Canterbury. Her efforts were unsuccessful, foundering on the opposition of Archbishop John Sharp, Anne's ecclesiastical confidant, but the episode marked the beginning of a friendship that was to play a significant part in Hoadly's life. By the 1730s the two had fallen out and the duchess condemned Hoadly for ingratitude, but for many years he was an intimate in the Marlborough household, he was supported financially by the duchess, and he wrote an early version of her justification of her conduct during the reign of Queen Anne. Meanwhile he continued his defence of the revolution in a sermon preached before the lord mayor of London at St Lawrence Jewry on 29 September 1705. Selecting as his text <span class="roman">Romans</span> 13: 1, a passage often used by high-churchmen to expound the duties of non-resistance and passive obedience, Hoadly glossed it in whig fashion, developing a doctrine of conditional obedience. While admitting that government was &#145;ordained of God&#146;, he argued that it was ordained for &#145;the Good of the Public&#146;. Thus it would be &#145;the highest profaneness&#146; to treat rulers who abused their power as the &#145;Vice-gerents&#146; of God; &#145;a <i>Passive Non-Resistance</i>&#146; would be a greater sin than resistance  (ibid., 20&#150;21).<br>
<br>The appearance of this sermon pushed Hoadly to the forefront of political debate. As he noted in 1754, it brought down upon him &#145;a Torrent of <i>angry Zeal</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.621). The lower house of convocation complained that it contained &#145;positions contrary to the doctrine of the church&#146; and demanded synodical censure, and in the Lords Bishop Compton accused Hoadly of encouraging rebellion and resistance  (Cardwell, 2.723). Hoadly's major contribution to the ensuing controversy was <span class="italic">The Measures of Submission to the Civil Magistrate Considered</span> (1706), an extended defence of his sermon in which he argued that the doctrine of &#145;absolute <i>Passive-Obedience</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.93) was a recent innovation for which no justification could be found in scripture, the homilies, or the works of the most esteemed Anglican divines. While all high-churchmen were infuriated by these views the exchanges between Hoadly and Francis Atterbury developed into a more personal feud, spilling over into other issues. As the debate between the two continued through 1708, Hoadly seized on expressions dropped by Atterbury in a funeral sermon and a charity sermon to criticize his notions of virtue and morality, even accusing his adversary of arguing that vice was preferable to virtue.<br>
<br>It was, however, the related issues of obedience and allegiance that lay at the heart of Hoadly's polemical endeavours in this period. He further developed his ideas in two assize sermons preached at Hertford in 1708, in which he attacked the scriptural foundations of divine-right theories by arguing that strict lineal succession had not even prevailed among the Israelites and that the behaviour of St Paul supported his case that oppression could be lawfully resisted. Equally controversially he stated unequivocally the view, not universally shared even among fellow whigs, that the crown and the two houses of parliament shared a co-ordinate power. In the following year Hoadly took on another prominent tory, Offspring Blackall, who had recently been promoted to the bishopric of Exeter and had preached a sermon on the anniversary of the queen's accession advancing an unequivocally high-tory interpretation of &#145;the divine institution of magistracy&#146;. Hoadly attacked Blackall for abandoning his earlier, more moderate views, and in the course of two pamphlets he restated the twin argument that government was instituted for the good of the people and that civil authority was vested in the magistrate by their agreement. He concluded by pointing out that Blackall's doctrine of non-resistance led inevitably to Jacobitism.<br>
<br>One of Hoadly's most effective adversaries was Charles Leslie, whose journal, <span class="italic">The Rehearsal</span> (1704&#150;9), was a vehicle for attacking Locke, Hoadly, and other whigs and for expounding high-flying notions of patriarchalism, non-resistance, and passive obedience. In the eyes of the whigs Leslie was the more dangerous because, as a nonjuror, he was freed from the need to reconcile high-church principles with the events of 1688&#150;9. Consequently when he published <span class="italic">The Constitution, Laws and Government of England, Vindicated</span> (1709), itself a contribution to the controversy between Hoadly and Blackall, it was inevitable that it would provoke an answer from Hoadly. Thus when his <span class="italic">Original and Institution of Civil Government</span> appeared in December 1709 it was first and foremost a polemical response to Leslie. But, as Frederic Ward points out, it was also &#145;the most extensive political treatise published in this period&#146;  (Ward, 90), an important contribution to whig thought that was crucial in reintroducing Lockean political theory to the debates of the early eighteenth century. There were important differences between the <span class="italic">Original and Institution</span> and Locke's <span class="italic">Two Treatises</span>, if only because Hoadly was combating Leslie rather than Filmer. None the less Hoadly's contractarianism was deeply Lockean. The basic structure of the <span class="italic">Original and Institution</span> owed a great deal to Locke. Like the <span class="italic">Two Treatises</span> it was divided into two halves, the first examining patriarchalism and the second developing Hoadly's views. Like Locke, moreover, Hoadly adopted the pretence of defending Richard Hooker's views on civil government, even quoting the same passages as a way of legitimating their own more radical ideas.<br>
<br>Leslie Stephen may have been right to claim that Hoadly said nothing new  (Stephen, 2.153), but in the context of the political debates of the middle of Anne's reign it is difficult to overestimate the tract's significance. Appearing at a time when the attention of the public had been gripped by Henry Sacheverell's incendiary sermon <span class="italic">The Perils of False Brethren</span>, which was widely seen as an overt attack on revolution principles, the whigs seized gratefully on Hoadly's tract. On 13 December 1709, the same day that the whig majority in the Commons agreed to impeach Sacheverell, it also passed a resolution recommending Hoadly to the queen for preferment &#145;for having often strenuously justified the principles, on which her Majesty, and the Nation proceeded, in the late happy Revolution&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 16.242). Hoadly became a national figure, widely seen as the low-church counterpart to Sacheverell. With his high-flying antagonist he was one of the first clergy to be the subject of satirical prints; throughout 1710 he was portrayed as the representative of &#145;moderation&#146;, latitudinarianism, and heterodoxy, and he was depicted in one print with &#145;Asses Ears and two Horns, with a Couple of Wings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.20). In the tory celebrations following the Sacheverell trial and at the elections later in 1710 he was burned in effigy at Oxford, and his books were consigned to the flames in places such as Exeter, Hereford, and Sherborne.<br>
<br>The Commons' resolution in favour of Hoadly was a calculated criticism of the queen's religious policy; Blackall's sermon, against which Hoadly had written, had after all been preached before the queen and published at her request. Unsurprisingly the Commons' request was ignored, but on 13 February 1710 Elizabeth Howland, &#145;unasked, unapplied to&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.622), presented Hoadly to the rectory of Streatham, and at the same time her grandson the duke of Bedford made him a domestic chaplain, qualifying him to hold the living in plurality with St Peter-le-Poer. Hoadly then threw himself into the 1710 election campaign, writing a series of pamphlets in support of the whig cause. In the aftermath of defeat he attacked high-church attempts to use convocation to condemn the heterodox views of William Whiston but in general he was less active as a pamphleteer, contributing only the occasional sermon to the struggle against the principles of toryism in Anne's last years.<br>
<br>It is important, however, not to see Hoadly merely as a political clergyman. Little is known of his pastoral work within his parishes, although he admitted &#145;many Imperfections in the discharge of &hellip; my Office&#146; due to his disability. None the less he did preach a series of sermons at St Peter-le-Poer, <span class="italic">The Terms of Acceptance with God</span>, which in their published form were intended as a manual for piety to be &#145;read, either in the Family, or the Closet&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.495). Hoadly considered the duties of a Christian and how to achieve salvation. He emphasized the practical duties of Christianity&#151;the practice of virtue and the renunciation of sin&#151;but he explained those duties in strongly biblical language and stressed the role of Christ as redeemer. He argued against the errors both of &#145;relying upon Faith&#146; and of &#145;relying upon External Performances&#146;&#151;works were the fruit of true faith, yet without &#145;Holiness of Life&#146;  (ibid., 562) the performance of external duties was worthless. Like many low-churchmen Hoadly also emphasized that Christianity was, if not an &#145;easy&#146; religion, then one suited to man's condition. God did not expect &#145;absolute Perfection&#146; as a condition of salvation. Indeed &#145;absolute Perfection&#146; was unattainable; rather God demanded &#145;a daily Progress, and sincere Endeavour, after Perfection&#146;  (ibid., 536).<br>
<br>Hoadly's theology was therefore firmly grounded in both scripture and the English protestant anti-Calvinist tradition. He was no deist, despite the claims of some contemporaries and later commentators. In 1713 he preached a series of sermons, not printed until they appeared as <span class="italic">Four Sermons</span> in 1715, in which he answered &#145;the many writings &hellip; which seemed on the one hand to attack the <i>Christian religion</i> itself, and on the other to discourage a free <i>examination</i> of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, 102). Later that year his <span class="italic">Queries Recommended to the Authors of a Late Discourse of Free-Thinking</span> was one of a number of responses to Anthony Collins's manifesto. Hoadly again sought to defend free enquiry by Christians, relying on scripture and the reason given to them by God. But he vigorously condemned the methodology and epistemology of the deists, who latched onto trivial, man-made inconsistencies in the gospels and who used wit, ridicule, and banter rather than reason to undermine faith. <h2>
<a name="BishopofBangor17161721"></a>Bishop of Bangor, 1716&#150;1721</h2>It was to be expected that, as one of the leading whig clergymen and propagandists from Anne's reign, Hoadly would receive some reward on the Hanoverian succession. In fact it was some time before he was taken notice of by the new administration. As the royal chaplaincies were filled during 1715, Hoadly's name was conspicuously absent, perhaps because he did not frequent the court and perhaps because the princess of Wales suspected that he &#145;was not a Churchman&#146;  (Beinecke Library, Osborn MS f.c. 110, fol. 20). By the end of the year, however, his name was being canvassed at Whitehall. His friends believed that &#145;a good Deanry, or Residentiaryship of St Pauls&#146; would be most &#145;proper&#146; for him, but he preferred a bishopric and, having failed of Lincoln, was nominated to Bangor in December 1715  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Add. A. 269, p. 52). He was created DD by Archbishop William Wake on 26 January 1716 and only then was he appointed to a royal chaplaincy, on 14 February. In later years the duchess of Marlborough claimed the credit for Hoadly's promotion, and over the next few years he was one of the most prominent episcopal allies of the earl of Sunderland, the duchess's son-in-law. Another strong supporter was Charlotte Clayton, one of the ladies of the bedchamber to the princess of Wales, who persuaded Caroline to adopt a more favourable opinion of Hoadly. The acquiescence, at least, of Lord Townshend, the secretary of state, would have been essential, and he may well have played a more active role. According to one radical whig report Hoadly's appointment was &#145;a lay triumph&#146; pushed through in the face of the opposition of a united episcopal bench  (Surrey HC, Somers MSS, letter, 29 Dec 1715). It was certainly controversial: when he visited his diocese in 1718 he was attacked by a mob at Brecon.<br>
<br>William Whiston's claim that Hoadly never set foot in Bangor has long been demonstrated to be false. There is clear evidence that he was there in both 1718 and 1719, although the disappearance of the records for his episcopate makes any assessment of his pastoral work very difficult. His disability undoubtedly restricted him; Edmund Gibson was concerned that he might find regular attendance in the House of Lords difficult, noting that &#145;at first <i>Crutches</i> will look a little ungainly there!&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Add. A. 269, p. 52). But other bishops were willing to provide assistance, and Bishop John Wynne performed an ordination tour in the summer of 1720.<br>
<br>Hoadly's pastoral efforts, however, continued to be overshadowed by his controversial work. He preached against the Jacobite rising in 1715, and one of his first acts after his consecration in 1716 was to deliver the Restoration day sermon before the king. Both were strongly whig in tone, the latter arguing that the Restoration had only been made a &#145;blessing&#146; to the nation by the securing of the succession in the protestant line in 1688. But his most significant work during the early months of George I's reign appeared anonymously in May 1715: his <span class="italic">Dedication to Pope Clement XI</span>, prefixed to Richard Steele's <span class="italic">Account of the State of the Roman Catholic Religion</span>. In this tract he highlighted what he saw as the similarities between the Church of England and the Church of Rome, arguing that the former had inherited the intolerant and persecuting practices of the latter. Both asserted an infallible authority and both denied the individual the right to interpret the scriptures, though the Church of England claimed to do the opposite. The only difference between the two churches was &#145;That You <i>cannot</i> Err in any Thing You determine, and We never <i>do</i>: That is &hellip; You are Infallible, and We always in the Right&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.535). The Church of England indeed was becoming more and more like the Church of Rome. In time, Hoadly told the pope, &#145;no Man of Sense will be able to see any Difference between <i>Your Popery</i>, and <i>that</i> of many amongst <i>Us</i>, but that <i>Ours</i> is <i>Protestant Popery</i>, and <i>Yours</i> is <i>Popish Popery</i>&#146;  (ibid., 544).<br>
<br>This tract marked a change in tone in Hoadly's work. In common with many whigs and low-churchmen he was worried by the increasing stridency and extremism of the nonjurors both politically, in their support for Jacobitism, and theologically, in their adoption of more &#145;Catholic&#146; rites and practices. Even more worrying, at a time when the protestant succession appeared very precarious, was the creeping sacerdotalism of many high-flying clergy and their apparent sympathy for the nonjuring position. Hoadly's response was to focus, more explicitly than ever before, on the threat from within the Church of England. He highlighted the issue of authority and made the right of private judgement <i>the</i> distinguishing characteristic of protestantism. Over the next two years these themes were developed in two further pamphlets, <span class="italic">A Preservative Against the Principles and Practices of the Nonjurors</span> (1716) and <span class="italic">The Nature of the Kingdom or Church of Christ</span> (1717), provoking the most famous politico-religious controversy of the eighteenth century, the Bangorian controversy.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Preservative</span> was occasioned by the posthumous publication of <span class="italic">The Constitution of the Catholick Church</span> (1716), in which the leading nonjuror George Hickes argued that the Church of England was a schismatic church teaching a heretical doctrine of obedience, and that the state had no rights over the church, rendering the deprivation of nonjurors invalid. Hoadly sought first to defend the revolution settlement and the exclusion of all Catholics from the line of succession. He went on to demonstrate that the civil power was &#145;endowed with every <i>Power</i> necessary to its <i>Defense</i> as a <i>Civil Power</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.582) and thus had the right to deprive bishops who, in &#145;the Exercise of the <span class="italic">Episcopal Office</span>&#146;  (ibid., 581), were threatening the state with destruction. Finally he ridiculed the claim of the nonjurors to confine salvation to the &#145;Communion of your particular, little, <i>Body</i>, or <i>Church</i>&#146;  (ibid., 592), asserting instead that the essence of true religion lay in &#145;sincerity&#146;:<blockquote>Your <i>Title</i> to God's favour &hellip; cannot depend Simply upon your adhering to this Communion; because the very adhering to this <i>Communion</i>, if it were against your Conscience, would entitle you to His Anger: But must depend upon it, considered as a Conduct honestly entered into, by the Dictate of your Conscience. The favour of God &hellip; follows <i>Sincerity</i> &hellip; And consequently, equally follows every <i>Equal Degree</i> of <i>Sincerity</i>. (ibid., 593)</blockquote>This doctrine was an important development in latitudinarian theology and was recognized as such even by Hoadly's more conservative whig colleagues. Bishop Nicolson, for example, was content to endorse Hoadly's justification of the deprivation of the nonjurors and was reluctant to take issue with his denial of the apostolical succession, but he bridled at the idea that &#145;our people be taught that they are <i>not to expect any of God's Graces Benedictions or Absolutions, from any hands but his own</i>&#146;  (Christ Church, Oxford, Arch.W.Epist. 20, fols. 277&#150;8). He believed that Hoadly's doctrines deprived the clergy of the spiritual authority conferred on them at their ordination and were irreconcilable with those of the Church of England.<br>
<br>If the <span class="italic">Preservative</span> was, ostensibly at least, directed at the nonjurors, the doctrines advanced by Hoadly in his sermon <span class="italic">The Nature of the Kingdom, or Church, of Christ</span>, preached on 31 March 1717, were of more general application. Developing themes explored in the <span class="italic">Preservative</span>, Hoadly argued that Christ was the &#145;Sole <i>Law-giver</i> to his Subjects, and Sole <i>Judge</i>, in matters relating to Salvation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.409). Consequently:<blockquote>in the Affairs of <i>Eternal Conscience</i> and <i>Salvation</i> &hellip; He hath &hellip; left behind Him, no visible, humane <i>Authority</i>; no <i>Vicegerents</i>, who can be said properly to supply his Place; no <i>Interpreters</i>, upon whom his Subjects are absolutely to depend; no <i>Judges</i> over the Consciences or Religion of his People. (ibid., 404)</blockquote>From this he went on to demonstrate that the rewards and punishments of Christianity occurred in a future state, and that to apply temporal rewards and punishments was &#145;to act contrary to the Interests of True Religion&#146;  (ibid., 406&#150;7). It has been pointed out that Hoadly's words echoed those preached by Arthur Ashley Sykes in an archidiaconal sermon at Cambridge the previous December, but Sykes was at this time a relatively obscure country clergyman. Moreover Hoadly's sermon acquired far greater significance from its context. The bishop was close to the new Sunderland&#150;Stanhope ministry, which was formulating a more radical religious policy that included significant concessions to the dissenters, and he was known to be in high favour at court. The sermon indeed was delivered before the king and printed at his command. It was evident to many that it provided a timely ideological justification for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>&#151;the statute restricting civil office to members of the Church of England&#151;which was beginning to be canvassed by the administration.<br>
<br>The response was both immediate and prolonged, the exchange of pamphlets dragging on into 1720. Leslie Stephen comments that &#145;There is a bewildering variety of theological, ecclesiastical, political, historical, exegetical, and purely personal discussions&#146;  (Stephen, 2.156). Much of it was trivial, such as the exchange involving Hoadly, Bishop William Nicolson, and White Kennett over whether the sermon had been altered between preaching and publication. But major issues were at stake. In particular many churchmen believed that Hoadly's doctrines denied any authority to the visible church and thus undermined the position of the Church of England. This was made clear in the report of the committee of the lower house of convocation, which condemned Hoadly for having subverted &#145;all government and discipline in the Church of Christ&#146; and also for having impugned the king's &#145;supremacy in causes ecclesiastical, and the authority of the legislature to enforce obedience in matters of religion by civil sanctions&#146;  (Cardwell, 2.829). The committee also highlighted the doctrine of sincerity, which, it claimed in an argument developed by William Law, made the truth or falsehood of belief irrelevant and placed all religions on the same level with respect to salvation. The representation was received <i>nemine contradicente</i> by the lower house on 10 May 1717. On the same day the ministry, fearing synodical censure of its episcopal champion, ordered the prorogation of convocation to 8 November 1717. Apart from a brief session in 1741 it did not meet again to do business until 1852.<br>
<br>There is no denying that the Bangorian controversy was of enormous significance in the politico-religious history of the early eighteenth century. It is important to recognize that it not only reinforced divisions between high- and low-churchmen. Some of Hoadly's most prominent critics were indeed high-churchmen; Andrew Snape and Thomas Sherlock were particularly effective, while the <span class="italic">Three Letters</span>, written by the young nonjuror William Law, were much admired by nineteenth-century commentators. But the controversy also saw a fracturing of the low-church alliance that had been so powerful during the reign of Queen Anne. Leading whig churchmen like Archbishop Wake and Bishop Gibson, who had championed the low-church cause during the convocation controversy, were privately horrified by Hoadly's writings. Others, including John Potter, bishop of Oxford, and Francis Hare, a former chaplain to the duke of Marlborough, went into print, while Robert Cannon played a leading role in the deliberations in convocation. Hoadly had his supporters, but they formed only a section of whig low-church opinion.<br>
<br>What is much less clear is whether the controversy marked an important shift in Hoadly's own views. At the time it was commonly believed that his writings at the beginning of George I's reign represented an abandonment of the positions that he had advanced at the outset of his career, particularly in his pamphlets against nonconformity. One country clergyman commented of his sermon in 1717 that &#145;he gives up Episcopacy entirely&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 22560, fol. 48), a view echoed in the twentieth century by Norman Sykes. Part of the problem is that <span class="italic">The Nature of the Kingdom &hellip; of Christ</span> lacked clarity and could easily be interpreted, or misinterpreted, in many ways. But Hoadly did something to clarify his position in the twelve further pamphlets that he contributed to the Bangorian controversy and other later writings. By emphasizing that the right to judge men's consciences belonged to Christ alone, by asserting that the fundamentals of Christianity were simply the &#145;Practice of all the Duties we owe to Ourselves, and to our Neighbour&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.509), and by stressing the importance of sincerity, Hoadly certainly diminished the role of visible churches in the economy of salvation. By repeating the Lockean argument that the office of the civil magistrate was confined to the well-being of civil society and had no part in &#145;the Care of <i>True Religion</i>&#146;  (ibid., 536), he was striking at the justification for the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. But he stopped short of questioning the utility of the church establishment, making clear his belief that &#145;all <i>Visible Churches</i> ought to be <i>orderly Societies</i>&#146;  (ibid., 898). He also reiterated his adherence to the Church of England, acknowledging that it was not &#145;all perfection, and uncapable of Amendment&#146;, but insisting that he was convinced &#145;of its Excellency above any Other&#146; that he knew of  (ibid., 3.42). Significantly <span class="italic">The Reasonableness of Conformity</span> was reprinted in 1720; Hoadly may not have approved of excluding dissenters from state office but he still believed that they could not justify their separation from the Church of England. His writings in the period 1715&#150;20 are thus best seen in terms of a change of tone rather than substance, a response to what he saw as the growing threat to protestantism and to civil and religious liberty from within the church. <h2>
<a name="BishopofHerefordSalisburyandWinchester17211761"></a>Bishop of Hereford, Salisbury, and Winchester, 1721&#150;1761</h2>Having resigned the rectory of St Peter-le-Poer in 1720 Hoadly was nominated to the bishopric of Hereford on 21 September 1721 and confirmed on 7 November. Rumours circulated that this was a reward for his support of the ministry during the South Sea crisis yet in many ways it was an odd promotion. Hereford was worth little, if any, more than Bangor, and the suspicion must remain that the translation was a favour intended to relieve Hoadly of the pastoral care of the large, distant, and mountainous diocese of Bangor. In any event his tenure of the see was short, and on 29 October 1723 he was translated to the bishopric of Salisbury, whereupon he resigned the rectory of Streatham. This was a move to which Hoadly's seniority among the whig bishops entitled him, but he had further recommended himself to the favour of the ministry by his vigorous pamphleteering on its behalf. While Hoadly had been closely identified with the liberal religious programme of the Sunderland&#150;Stanhope administration, he remained a strong supporter of Walpole and Townshend. In September 1722 Walpole took over the leading opposition newspaper, the <span class="italic">London Journal</span>, and immediately Hoadly started contributing regular articles to it under the pseudonym Britannicus. In the collected edition of Hoadly's works his son included 110 letters for the period from 1722 until 9 January 1725, although not all of these are generally accepted to be by the bishop.<br>
<br>The Britannicus letters defended the revolution settlement on Lockean principles, much as <span class="italic">The Original and Institution of Civil Government</span> had done. But first and foremost they were pieces of journalism focusing on the issues of the moment, such as the plight of the German protestants being persecuted by Catholics in Thorn, or the ministry's case for an excise duty on tea, coffee, and cocoa. No issue of this period attracted more attention, however, than the trials of the bishop of Rochester and other conspirators in the Atterbury plot. Hoadly vigorously defended the sometimes dubious manipulations of the law by the administration from the suspension of habeas corpus onwards and devoted letter after letter to a meticulous dissection of Atterbury's defence of his conduct in the House of Lords. Even after he stopped writing for the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> Hoadly continued to support the government's policies and record. In 1727 he even turned to foreign affairs, publishing <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Causes of the Conduct of Great Britain</span>, which provided a detailed defence of whig foreign policy and the 1725 alliance of Hanover, emphasizing the crucial role of Britain in the defence of protestantism and liberty. It was followed two years later with <span class="italic">A Defence of the Enquiry</span>.<br>
<br>In 1729 the leading latitudinarian theologian Samuel Clarke died. He had been a close and long-standing friend of Hoadly, who wrote a life of him that was prefaced to his published sermons (1732) and works (1737), laying &#145;hold on <i>His</i> Fame, to prop and support <i>My own</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of Samuel Clarke</span>, 1.xiv). Clarke was widely viewed in the early eighteenth century as the leading advocate of an Arian doctrine of the Trinity, and Hoadly revealingly declined to offer an opinion on &#145;so difficult a Question&#146;  (ibid., vii). But however much Hoadly admired Clarke as a man and a Christian, and however much he may have sympathized with his desire to see parts of the church's doctrine and liturgy reformed, there were important differences between them. In his later career Clarke had been unwilling to accept any preferment that would require further subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span>. Hoadly, by contrast, felt no scruples about the terms of conformity imposed by the church and stressed that, while &#145;a parish-minister&#146;, he had always &#145;observed the rules prescribed; and, amongst other injunctions, that he had never omitted the Athanasian creed, when ordered to be read in the church&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 53.1029).<br>
<br>Hoadly was never an uncritical supporter of the Walpole administration or its predecessors. He confided to Lady Sundon, for example, his disapproval of attacks on the liberty of the press through the prosecution of printers. He had never been trusted by Walpole on ecclesiastical policy; the rise of Edmund Gibson, bishop of London, in the 1720s demonstrated the ministry's determination to reassure the clergy that Hoadleian principles would not be applied in the church. It may have been Gibson's influence that determined that the bishopric of Durham was given to Edward Chandler in October 1730&#151;a bitter disappointment for Hoadly, though by this time his friendship with Queen Caroline, the other important influence over the disposal of church preferments, also had cooled. Hoadly continued to be a loyal supporter of the ministry in the House of Lords, but the episode contributed to a tension between him and Walpole. Thus in 1732, when Walpole was seeking Hoadly's assistance in discouraging the dissenters from pressing for a repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span>, the approach was made through the queen. Hoadly agreed to intercede with his friends among the dissenters, advising them that the attempt was likely to fail and at the same time would damage the whig interest. But he could not resist reiterating his opposition to those laws on account of their &#145;unreasonableness &hellip; in a social light, and the profaneness of them theologically considered&#146;, and he declared that if the matter were to come before the House of Lords he would be obliged both to speak and to vote for repeal  (Hervey, 1.126&#150;7). He even wrote a tract, developing his views, in answer to Edmund Gibson's <span class="italic">The Dispute Adjusted</span>, although it was not published until 1736, and even then anonymously, by the Presbyterian Benjamin Avery under the title <span class="italic">The Objections Against the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts Considered</span>. It would be misleading, however, to see Hoadly's nomination to the bishopric of Winchester on 3 September 1734 as the reward of a grateful court. It was rather, if Lord Hervey's account is to be believed, the performance of a promise extracted from a reluctant Caroline and George II by Hoadly himself, supported by Hervey and Lady Sundon  (ibid., 2.395&#150;9).<br>
<br>The dissenting campaign for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Test and Corporation Acts</span> also provided the context for Hoadly's last major new publication, <span class="italic">A Plain Account of the Nature and End of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper</span>, which appeared anonymously in 1735. The political meaning was made explicit by his emphasis that the sacrament was a purely religious duty and that the only obligation to it derived from Christ's institution. More generally his intention was to remove all &#145;<i>Superstition</i>&#146;, or mystery, from the understanding of the sacrament, believing that the best defence of Christianity against &#145;<i>Unbelievers</i> &hellip; is to remove from it whatever hinders it from being seen as it really is in itself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.845). Adopting a resolutely scriptural approach, he attacked both the Catholic and protestant eucharistic doctrines, arguing that the bread and wine were merely symbols and that the rite was simply a remembrance of Christ's sacrifice. <span class="italic">A Plain Account</span> was widely condemned, many commentators, including Daniel Waterland, believing that it tended towards Socinianism. Waterland also accused Hoadly of &#145;<i>novelty</i>&#146;, but in this he was certainly mistaken  (<span class="italic">Works of the Rev. Daniel Waterland</span>, 4.465). As some twentieth-century historians have noted, Hoadly's eucharistic beliefs were based on the memorialism of the sixteenth-century Swiss reformer Huldreich Zwingli, although the bishop had probably become acquainted with them through John Hales's <span class="italic">Tract on the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper</span>, which had first appeared in 1635.<br>
<br>In pastoral terms Hoadly was not a model bishop and it is futile to attempt to portray him as such. However, he was far more conscientious than many commentators have been prepared to admit. It has been claimed that he never went to Hereford but, as at Bangor, this claim is untrue. He performed an ordination in the cathedral there on 1 July 1722 and then carried out a visitation of the diocese. While at Salisbury he visited the diocese twice, in 1726 and 1729, and he also conducted a personal visitation of Winchester in 1736. In both dioceses he also ordained regularly, conducting as many as eighty-one ordination services between 1743 and 1761, the only period for which his act book at Winchester survives, and there is evidence that he examined candidates rigorously. It is true that he could be a divisive presence in his dioceses&#151;at Hereford the predominantly tory country gentry refused to wait on him&#151;and he was widely distrusted by his clergy. On his translation to Winchester the chapter pointedly omitted from the return of the election the conventional formula that he had been chosen &#145;<i>by the Aid and immediate Direction of the Holy Ghost</i>&#146;  (Lewis Walpole Library, Clarke&#150;Sundon correspondence). Hoadly was well aware of their suspicions and assured them that he would never consent &#145;to any thing, that may hurt either [the church's] Establishment, or legal Revenues&#146;, adding that where his judgement differed from theirs he hoped that they would believe that &#145;I as truly &hellip; and as sincerely intend their Service, as any One of Themselves can do&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.492). But many of them were hardly likely to have been reassured by his patronage of advanced low-churchmen such as Arthur Ashley Sykes, Jonathan Shipley, and Edmund Pyle.<br>
<br>Hoadly's first wife, Sarah, died on 11 January 1743. Two years later, on 23 July 1745, at the age of sixty-eight, he married Mary Newey, the daughter of the dean of Chichester, at Farnham Castle. By this time he was becoming noticeably less active in the discharge of his episcopal functions. Despite his reputation as a political bishop he had never frequented the House of Lords regularly, and after the fall of Walpole in 1742, he gave up attendance in parliament altogether. By the end of the decade he was relying upon Bishop Matthias Mawson to undertake a confirmation tour for him in the Isle of Wight, and in the 1750s it became usual for him to turn to his colleagues to perform ordinations and confirmations. Hoadly's decline, however, was physical rather than mental. He oversaw the publication of two volumes of his collected sermons, in 1754 and 1755, and in 1757 he was even persuaded to take up his pen again to defend his reputation against the forgeries of Bernard Fournier. He died, after an illness of less than twenty-four hours, at Winchester House, Chelsea, in the evening of 17 April 1761, leaving an estate of &pound;17,000, barely enough, according to Edmund Pyle, to &#145;pay two annuities, &amp; one legacy, and his funeral charges, &amp; dilapidations of 3 vast houses&#146;  (Pyle, 357&#150;8). He was buried in Winchester Cathedral, where &#145;but a decent monument&#146; was erected, contrary to his own wishes, by his son John. <h2>
<a name="Reputation"></a>Reputation</h2>Hoadly was arguably the most famous churchman of his generation. As a young and relatively obscure London preacher in the early years of Anne's reign he was able to establish himself as one of the leading whig and low-church propagandists of the period, and as a junior bishop at the beginning of George I's reign he was at the centre of the most famous politico-religious controversy of the century. William Warburton was merely stating the obvious when in 1765 he identified Hoadly as the leader of the low-church party in the early Hanoverian church  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 4.7). Predictably a figure of such prominence attracted praise and condemnation in equal measure. High-churchmen and tories routinely denounced him as heterodox&#151;&#145;an infamous and Scandalous Advocate for Rebellion&#146;, according to Thomas Hearne  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 3.87), a &#145;true Jeroboam&#146; priest, according to Browne Willis  (NL Wales, Ottley correspondence, 1825). For many whigs and low-churchmen, on the other hand, he was &#145;an exemplary divine&#146;, as Henry Fielding described him  (Thomas, 75), a leading advocate of the principles of religious and political liberty. Some attempted more balanced assessments. Thus Daniel Waterland, who wrote against Hoadly's doctrine of the sacrament, was none the less prepared to recommend his sermons to undergraduates as &#145;exact and judicious&#146; models of the preacher's art. It was remarked after his death that he had &#145;lived to see the Nation become his converts&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.141), but in reality his reputation was contested as much in the second half of the eighteenth century as it had been in the first half. He continued to have his admirers, both Richard Price and William Paley invoking the authority of &#145;the excellent Hoadly&#146; (Thomas, 74; Gascoigne, 241), while detractors like Lewis Bagot and Samuel Horsley denounced his Socinianism and republicanism.<br>
<br>In the nineteenth century, however, under the impact of tractarianism and evangelicalism, attitudes became more uniformly critical. The tone of most nineteenth- and even twentieth-century portraits of Hoadly was set by S. H. Cassan in his biographies of the bishops of Winchester. Cassan admitted that Hoadly's private life was &#145;exemplary and praiseworthy&#146;, but he found fault with the &#145;low-Church principles&#146; of &#145;this anti-prelatical Prelate&#146;, marvelling at &#145;how so great a Dissenter could have retained, I will not say the episcopal, but even the priestly character&#146;  (Cassan, 2.403&#150;5). Like many churchmen Cassan found it particularly hard to forgive Hoadly his role in the destruction of convocation, which was attributed to his &#145;weakness and time-serving compliance&#146;  (ibid., 403). To these attacks on Hoadly's heterodoxy was added a new critique of his pastoral failings, his record, according to C. J. Abbey, being &#145;glaring even above others&#146; in a century characterized by &#145;disgraceful absenteeism&#146;  (Abbey, 2.2). Even more liberal churchmen, who might be supposed to have been more sympathetic to Hoadly's low-churchmanship, contributed to the tide of condemnation. Thus W. J. Conybeare lamented how the &#145;comprehensive Christianity of Tillotson and Burnet too soon degenerated into the worldliness of the Sadducean Hoadly&#146;  (Conybeare, 350). Leslie Stephen may have praised Hoadly's stand against &#145;bigotry&#146; but he also dismissed him as a &#145;bore&#146; who had nothing original to say and who was often &#145;evasive&#146;, refusing to recognize the deist implications of his arguments  (Stephen, 2.153, 155).<br>
<br>Remarkably, perhaps, Hoadly benefited little from the powerful assault launched against nineteenth-century orthodoxies by Norman Sykes. Sykes accepted much of Stephen's interpretation, talking of the &#145;essentially Deist basis of his thought&#146; and agreeing that a great deal of what Hoadly wrote &#145;may well be swept to the dustheaps&#146;  (Sykes, &#145;Benjamin Hoadly&#146;, 137, 150). Indeed for many historians he still remains the leading example of whig opportunism and &#145;blatant clerical&#146; careerism  (Young, 33). In the last decades of the twentieth century, however, a more positive assessment of Hoadly has emerged. While there has been a reappraisal of his pastoral work it is clear that he still fell some way short of the best standards of the eighteenth-century church. But he was a crucial figure in the propaganda wars of the post-revolutionary years, articulating a powerful rebuttal to the revival of patriarchalism and divine-right ideology during the reign of Queen Anne. In so doing he played a leading role in the transmission of Lockean contractarianism into the mainstream of eighteenth-century political thought in both England and North America. Moreover it is becoming increasingly clear that, despite the allegations of Socinianism and deism, Hoadly stood firmly in a protestant tradition that can be traced back through Hales, Chillingworth, and Hooker. Through his development of the concept of sincerity and through his &#145;memorialist&#146; eucharistic thought he contributed significantly to the development of an Anglican latitudinarian tradition that minimized the role of the priesthood in the church and of mystery in its doctrines. While not particularly innovative Hoadly none the less exercised a profound influence over political and religious thought in eighteenth-century England.<br>
