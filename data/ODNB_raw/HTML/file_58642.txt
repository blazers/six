<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dunnico, Sir  (James) Herbert</span>  (1875&#150;1953), <span class="occ">Baptist minister and politician</span>, was born in the Flintshire village of Cefn-y-bedd on 2 December 1875, the eldest of the nine children of James Dunnico (1853/4&#150;1913), a coalminer, and his wife, Mary Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Owens (1854/5&#150;1941). The family moved to Gresford while Herbert was still an infant before settling in Lancashire in 1885. He never lived in Wales again, but he retained a sense of his Welsh identity; he frequently returned to speak and preach there. He grew up in a political family. His father was a trade union activist, first in north Wales and later in Lancashire, where, despite his illiteracy, he was appointed an agent of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Association. Both parents were devotedly religious.<br>
<br>Dunnico started work in the Lancashire cotton industry as a half-timer at the age of ten. Two years later, he followed his father into the pit, but left the coal industry after a year and began work in a grocer's business. There he combined his clerical employment with private study. He took up a place at Nottingham University College in 1898 and then at Midland Baptist College.<br>
<br>Dunnico entered the Baptist ministry in 1902, taking up a position at Golborne Street Baptist Church, Warrington. Already evident was the broad-minded ecumenical attitude to which he adhered throughout his life. Having married <a href="#cosubject_100441">Harriet Rathbone [<i>see below</i>]</a> on 7 September 1903, he left Warrington in 1906, despondent at the &#145;narrow minds&#146; he encountered there  (<span class="italic">Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser</span>, 2 May 1906). He took up a post at Kensington Baptist Church, Liverpool, where he also encountered some hostility. His sermons were disrupted by opponents, on one occasion following his invitation to a Jesuit priest to deliver an address.<br>
<br>Dunnico inherited an early allegiance to the Liberal Party from his father and belonged to the executive of the Warrington Liberal Association. But he gravitated towards Labour. Socialism complemented his Christian beliefs, and in 1909 he became founder member and president of the Free Church Socialist League, which he claimed could &#145;take some part in the destruction of the present commercial and industrial system which is based upon greed, lust and unholy rivalry, and the creation of a better system based upon equality, brotherhood and co-operation&#146;  (Jones, 351). He was president of the Liverpool branches of the Independent Labour Party, Fabians, and Labour Representation Committee, and in 1915 joined the West Derby board of guardians as a Labour member.<br>
<br>As a minister of religion Dunnico was exempted from military service. In January 1916 he left Kensington Baptist Church to replace W. E. Darby as full-time secretary of the Peace Society. One of Dunnico's initiatives, in connection with members of the Peace Society's newer and more vibrant rival, the Union of Democratic Control, was the launch of the Peace Negotiations Committee in March 1916, which met regularly, organized meetings, and promoted a petition that attracted hundreds of thousands of signatures. Dunnico addressed hundreds of meetings in the final years of the war, and, following a speech at Aberdare in January 1918, was summoned under the <span class="roman">Defence of the Realm Act</span>, charged with attempting to cause disaffection among the civilian population, though the case was dropped. Dunnico remained secretary of the Peace Society (the International Peace Society after 1930) until his death. He also became involved in the International Peace Bureau, based in Geneva, acting at different times as director and a vice-president. He regularly added his signature to calls for the inauguration of a world peace day.<br>
<br>In 1917 Dunnico had briefly been Labour's parliamentary candidate for West Derby, but his anti-war activities created tensions with his Liverpool colleagues. At the general election of 1918 he stood instead for Ilford, Essex, where the family had moved in 1915. Although heavily defeated, Dunnico remained involved in local Ilford and Essex politics for the rest of his life. He sat on both the town and county councils, was appointed a JP for the Becontree division in 1920, and later became chief magistrate for Ilford.<br>
<br>Forced to look elsewhere for an entry into national politics, Dunnico was adopted as Labour candidate for Consett, co. Durham, where over half of all men employed in the constituency worked in the coal industry. He was elected Consett's first Labour MP in 1922, one of two nonconformist ministers in the House of Commons. Although instinctively wary of strikes, Dunnico threw his support behind the miners during the general strike and miners' lockout of 1926. His stance brought him into conflict with the conservative bishop of Durham, Herbert Hensley Henson, who was outspoken in his denunciation of the miners' actions. In October, Dunnico made a public apology to Henson and the dean of Durham Cathedral, J. E. C. Welldon, following his declaration at a miners' meeting that &#145;two greater representations of anti-Christ he could not imagine&#146;  (<span class="italic">Blaydon Courier</span>, 16 October 1926).<br>
<br>No blind follower of the party line, Dunnico became the first Labour MP to vote against a Labour government in February 1924, when he supported a Liberal motion for an adjournment to a debate over the construction of naval cruisers. He continued to contest the party line when Labour returned to opposition. Early in 1927, when the Labour Party opposed the government's dispatch of troops to defend British citizens and property in Shanghai, Dunnico praised the government's handling of the crisis.<br>
<br>Dunnico also demonstrated the strength of his convictions in the debates over the revision of the prayer book later in 1927. Although parliament's ecclesiastical committee, of which Dunnico was a member, recommended that a revised prayer book should be ratified, it was twice rejected by the House of Commons. The conflict has been characterized as &#145;a clash of ideologies&#146; between &#145;those inclined to understand nation and religion in broad, generous terms, and &hellip; those who believed a more narrowly defined Protestantism was vital&#146;  (Maiden, 155&#150;6). Most nonconformists opposed the revision, and the Baptists were particularly critical, but Dunnico supported it. Following his contribution to the debate in December 1927, he was sent a note of appreciation by his old enemy, Hensley Henson.<br>
<br>Dunnico was a fervent advocate of marriage and played a regular part in the Dunmow flitch trials, a medieval Essex custom which awarded a prize of bacon to a couple who could convince a jury that they had not quarrelled or regretted their marriage for a year and a day. In 1923 he was one of only twenty-six MPs to vote against the <span class="roman">Matrimonial Causes Act</span>, which equalized male and female access to divorce on the grounds of adultery. Convinced of the centrality of the wife and mother to the well-being of the family, he argued that<blockquote>no one who thinks seriously can for a moment suggest that the act of adultery on the part of a man is as serious in its consequences and as grave in its results as the act of adultery on the part of a woman. (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 8 June 1923)</blockquote>His views on marriage led to admiration for the Roman Catholic church, for standing &#145;firm in its witness for the purity of family life and the preservation of the sanctities of the home&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chelmsford Chronicle</span>, 11 Nov 1927). He was outspoken about betting and gambling, and convened a parliamentary committee against greyhound racing. He was less concerned with temperance and voted against the <span class="roman">Welsh Temperance Bill</span> in 1924, earning him the criticism of other nonconformist MPs.<br>
<br>In July 1929, upon the election of the second Labour government, Dunnico was appointed deputy speaker of the House of Commons. He was proud of parliament and its traditions and later wrote a guidebook to the Palace of Westminster in which he demonstrated his affection for the &#145;Mother of Parliaments&#146;. He became a founder member and then grand master of the New Welcome Lodge for freemasons in the Houses of Parliament, particularly Labour MPs. When the minority Labour government resigned office on 23 August 1931, and the prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, agreed to head a National Government, made up of Conservatives, various Liberals, and a handful of National Labour MPs, Dunnico remained loyal to the Labour Party. He hoped for a reconciliation with MacDonald but in September 1931 bowed to party pressure to resign as deputy speaker.<br>
<br>Dunnico lost his parliamentary seat in the Labour collapse that followed MacDonald's decision to call a general election in October 1931. He also moved away from the political ideas that had once motivated him. He became chairman of the 1932 Club, a grouping of moderate Labour and former Labour MPs, and became increasingly critical of the trade unions and the more extremist members of the Parliamentary Labour Party. By January 1935 he had decided to support MacDonald's National Government and was adopted as National Labour candidate for Wednesbury, but was defeated in November 1935. Knighted in the new year's honours 1938, &#145;for political and public services&#146;, he remained parliamentary candidate (sometimes now described in the press as &#145;Conservative candidate&#146;) for Wednesbury until 1940.<br>
<br>Dunnico never returned to parliament, but he continued to play an active part in political and social work, both local and national. From 1932 he was honorary warden of the Robert Browning Settlement in Southwark. In 1940 he became involved in the Entertainments National Service Association, an organization formed to provide entertainment for the armed forces and war workers. Though he denied any contradiction with his commitment to the peace movement, he was an active supporter of the &#145;Win the Peace&#146; movement during the Second World War, set up by Lord Vansittart to campaign for the imposition of punishing terms towards Germany following an allied victory.<br>
<br>Dunnico had been a good amateur footballer in his youth and became president of Ilford Football Club in the 1920s. He maintained a long association with the club, and he donated the gates to Ilford's Lynn Road site. After the Second World War he became president of Essex County Football Association. Dunnico saw in sport not only a model of discipline and team play but also a force for peace. He organized several European tours with Ilford Football Club during the inter-war years and particularly valued the contact forged with German teams. Having suffered from bouts of ill health throughout his life, he suffered a heart attack while watching Ilford, and died at his home, 2 Bathurst Road, Ilford, on 2 October 1953. He was buried alongside his wife in Ilford cemetery.<br>
<br>Often described as &#145;Pickwickian&#146; in the press, Dunnico was genial and well liked. Although his political beliefs shifted rightwards as he grew older, he remained consistent in his dislike of narrow sectarianism and in the openness of his ideology, whether in political or religious matters.<br>
<br>His wife, <a name="cosubject_100441"></a><span class="headword">Harriet Emma Dunnico</span>, Lady Dunnico  (1877&#150;1952), <span class="occ">voluntary worker</span>, was born at Forest Field, Witton, Cheshire, on 16 April 1877, the third of eight children of Robert Rathbone, a stonemason, and his wife, Kate, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Miller. Upon leaving elementary school she worked as a domestic servant, but returned to live at home before her marriage to Dunnico in September 1903. She was as active in the public service of Ilford and Essex as her husband, though she never assumed his national profile. Keenly interested in issues of maternity and child welfare, she attended an international congress on the topic soon after the First World War. She was a founder of the Ilford Maternity and Child Welfare Association and president of its largest centre. She was also, at various times, local secretary of the Essex Voluntary Association for the Care of Mentally Defectives, a governor of West Ham High School for Girls, a member of the Ilford District Nursing Committee, local secretary of the United Services Fund (British Legion), and a member of the council of the British Red Cross Society. She sat as a member of the Romford board of guardians for twelve years, until the boards were abolished by the <span class="roman">Local Government Act</span> of 1929. In that role, she was chairman of the ladies committee, charged with the care of unmarried mothers and their children, and with destitute women and girls. In 1930 she became Ilford's first female JP and was soon after appointed to the lord lieutenant's committee. She suffered a breakdown in 1948 and died at the Goodmayes Mental Hospital, Brookside, Barley Lane, Ilford, on 1 November 1952. Their only child, Herbert Rathbone Dunnico (1910&#150;1982), a Labour parliamentary candidate, succeeded his father as warden of the Robert Browning Settlement and secretary of the International Peace Society.<br>
