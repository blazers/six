<span class="headword">Field,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1554&#150;1606), <span class="occ">Jesuit</span>, was born into an Old English family in co. Dublin. He is recorded as attending the Jesuit college in Paris in 1579, and entered the Society of Jesus in 1584. In 1593 he was at the University of Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, and later at Fribourg and at Lucerne, before he was instructed to join the Irish mission in 1599. When his fellow Jesuit Christopher Holywood was captured in England, Field was appointed interim leader of the mission on 17 April 1599. He was chosen ahead of more impetuous colleagues who were already active in Ireland. The choice was motivated by the desire of the Jesuit general Claudio Acquaviva to exert greater control over the activities of his subjects and to steer them away from political controversy. Acquaviva urged the Irish Jesuits to inform Field of their activities and to obey his advice. On 1 September 1599 Field sent his first report from Dublin to Rome. This account makes clear the degree of autonomy enjoyed by individual missionaries. It also highlights real issues and tensions between colleagues. Field noted that Henry Fitzsimons worked tirelessly to promote religion but lacked discretion. Raising substantial sums of money through his sodality organization, he neglected to disclose the sources of the funds or to consult his nominal superior, preferring to consort with &#145;outsiders&#146;. Fitzsimons was as critical of Field. He felt that the superior was reserved and aloof, and was not well known in the community. Fitzsimons attributed this partly to the illness that dogged Field during his time in Ireland, and partly to his &#145;cold spirit&#146; and lack of zeal. Fitzsimons stopped short of openly criticizing the general's decision and conceded that Field was the best choice as an interim superior, but added that the Irish acted on example, not words, and that zealous spirited leadership was required. Within three months the zealous, spirited Fitzsimons was confined in Dublin Castle.<br>
<br>Field's insistence on regulation and procedure irritated more impetuous colleagues. His tenure as superior may have been brief, but it was at a critical juncture and helped to establish a formal, structured, and politically conservative identity for the Jesuit mission in Jacobean and Caroline Ireland. When Holywood finally arrived in Ireland on 16 March 1604, Field's temporary commission expired and Holywood resumed the role of superior. Field stepped back to a missionary role, staying in and around Dublin. He rallied the Dublin county gentry in the face of official persecution, exhorting them to be a protective wall before the house of God. Field himself preached on the theme &#145;Render unto Caesar&#146;, balancing the obligations of obedience to the state and to the church. The steadfast example of the priest and the gentry bolstered the resolve of the Dublin citizenry to resist the state's attempts to enforce religious conformity.<br>
<br>Holywood noted in June 1604 that the house where Field lodged was affected by plague. By the beginning of the following year, Field's health had deteriorated. It was thought that he had consumption and he spent almost four months confined to bed. His health did not improve during the summer of 1605 and he died the following spring on 21 February 1606.<br>
