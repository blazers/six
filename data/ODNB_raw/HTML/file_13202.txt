<span class="headword">Hickes,  Gaspar</span>  (1605&#150;1677), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, son of a Berkshire clergyman, matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, on 26 October 1621, aged sixteen, graduating BA in 1625 and proceeding MA in 1628. He was ordained priest at Bristol on 24 December 1626 and in 1628 appears to have been beneficed. Instituted vicar of Launceston on 23 September 1630, he was also vicar of Lavnells from 1630 to 1636, and, resigning Launceston, from 1632 vicar of Landrake: all of these livings were in Cornwall, and the last was in the home parish of Francis Rous, the godly former MP. At an unknown date Hickes married, but little is known about his wife, Julian. Probably through the influence of Sir John Maynard and of Rous, then MP for Truro, on 20 April 1642 Hickes was named to parliament as one of the two Cornish divines whose advice should be sought on ecclesiastical matters. As the royalists gained ascendancy in Cornwall, he retired to London; he was a member of the Westminster assembly of divines from July 1643, and in October 1644, as one of the &#145;plundered ministers&#146;, was placed in possession of the vicarage of Tottenham, which was worth less than &pound;50. Additionally a grant of &pound;100 per annum was assigned to him out of the revenues of St Paul's chapter in the parish.<br>
<br>While known for his preaching, Hickes went into print only when commanded and as a result only three of his sermons survive. In his fast sermon <span class="italic">Glory and Beauty of God's Portion</span> (1644) Hickes encouraged the Commons towards militant action, reminding them that &#145;the prophecies in the <span class="roman">Revelation</span> seem to foreshew that the ruine of Antichrist shall in a good part be brought to pass by the sword&#146;  (p. 42). Hickes used his funeral sermon of 26 June 1645 for William Strode as an opportunity to further encourage godly parliamentarians: <span class="italic">The Life and Death of David</span> (1645), dedicated to Sir Edward Barkham and Lady Barkham, emphasizes the need for action, saying, &#145;You that live, while ye have time and strength, work on&#146;  (p. 26). The following January he warned the House of Lords against growing secure amid success in a fast sermon, <span class="italic">The Advantage of Afflictions</span> (1646). Hickes later returned to Landrake, and as the leading presbyterian divine in the county was appointed in 1654 assistant to the commissioners for Cornwall for ejecting scandalous ministers and schoolmasters. In October 1658 he was a member of the Cornish Association. Dispossessed of his benefice in 1662, Hickes continued to minister in the area. At some point after 1670 he was prosecuted under the <span class="roman">Conventicle Act</span> for unlawful preaching. When the justice of his own district refused to convict he was taken further west, where he was convicted and fined &pound;40. He appealed, but without any result beyond increasing the substantial costs of the proceedings. He was granted a licence as a presbyterian in April 1672. In 1677 he died, and was buried in the porch of the parish church on 10 April, when many of the &#145;godly party&#146; attended. In his will dated 9 February 1674 Hickes left bequests to his brother Edward and &#145;the children of my brothers and sisters&#146;, and his estate first to his wife and then to Gaspar Geffrey. The suggestion that Gaspar Hickes (<i>d</i>. 1714), captain of a Yarmouth man-of-war, was a possible son  (Laughton, 141) is thus unlikely.<br>
