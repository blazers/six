<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wade, Sir  Thomas Francis</span>  (1818&#150;1895), <span class="occ">diplomatist and Sinologist</span>, was born on 25 August 1818 in London, the eldest son of Colonel Thomas Wade (<i>d</i>. 1846) and his wife, Anne, daughter of William Smythe. In his youth Wade accompanied his father on military postings to Mauritius and southern Africa, and in 1832 he was sent to Harrow School. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1837, but left after a year when his father bought him a commission in the 81st regiment of foot. In 1839 he exchanged into the 42nd highlanders, with whom he served in Ireland and Corfu. He was promoted lieutenant in 1841 and exchanged into the 98th regiment of foot, which was then bound for China to fight in the First Opium War. Always interested in languages and foreign cultures, Wade began to study Chinese on the long voyage to Hong Kong. After a short period of military action in China Wade fell ill with malaria and during his convalescence was made interpreter to the Hong Kong garrison (1843). After a period of sick leave in Britain, Wade was appointed interpreter in Cantonese to the supreme court of Hong Kong in 1845, and in 1846 he became assistant Chinese secretary to Sir John Davis, then superintendent of trade. Another bout of malaria returned him to Britain, after which he became vice-consul at Shanghai in 1852, and in 1855 was appointed Chinese secretary in Hong Kong, in which position he was responsible for the student interpreters' language studies. Apart from brief visits to Britain, Wade remained in China until his retirement in 1883. On one of his visits to England he married, on 28 July 1868, Amelia Herschel (<i>d</i>. 1926), daughter of the physicist and astronomer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13101/', "Sir John F. W. Herschel")</script>. It was a happy marriage, and produced four sons, one of whom died in the South African War.<br>
<br>Wade's diplomatic career was successful, if controversial. His rise in the service depended on his knowledge of the Chinese language, not diplomatic skills. As vice-consul in Shanghai in 1854 he assisted Sir Rutherford Alcock with the negotiations that led to the creation of the Maritime Customs Service, which collected customs duties for the Chinese government, then being besieged by the Taiping insurgents. Wade himself served as its first inspector, a role later taken over with great success by Sir Robert Hart. Lord Elgin also made use of Wade's linguistic abilities during the Second Opium War (1856&#150;60). Together with Horatio Nelson Lay, and under Elgin's supervision, Wade did the actual work of negotiating the treaty of Tientsin (Tianjin) (1858), which secured the right of residence of foreign diplomats in Peking (Beijing), opened the Yangtze (Yangzi) River to foreign trade, and obtained for foreigners the right of travel under passport throughout China. In 1861 he was on the staff of the first British legation in Peking, and was twice acting charg&eacute; d'affaires there (1864&#150;5 and 1869&#150;71). Wade was likewise involved in the negotiations undertaken by Alcock in 1867&#150;9. The Alcock convention was ratified in Peking, but ultimately was rejected in London, principally because of English merchants' opposition to acquiescence in the continued levying of <i>likin</i>, or transit dues, in China.<br>
<br>In 1871 Wade was appointed minister-plenipotentiary to Peking. In this role he strove to improve Sino-British relations, but ultimately could not prevent their deterioration; his own peppery temperament probably contributed to the situation. While in principle he was opposed to the use of force, and hoped to see China modernize and become an equal partner in diplomatic relations, he ended up threatening and bullying the Chinese negotiators. There were three significant incidents during his tenure of office: the audience question, the Formosa (Taiwan) crisis, and the Margary affair. Wade was insistent that the Guangxu emperor receive the diplomatic corps when he came of age in 1872. Chinese refusals were seen by Wade and others as attempts to maintain the old tribute system and as a refusal to meet on equal terms (the treaty of Tientsin had explicitly stated that foreign diplomats would no longer be obliged to perform the <i>kowtow</i> to the emperor; this would be the first time that they had to honour the treaty terms). During the negotiations that dragged on between 1871 and 1873, Wade lectured and hectored the Chinese at length. The eventual audience, which took place on 29 June 1873, was a cursory affair, which left all sides frustrated. Wade played a more positive role in the Formosa crisis of 1874. When the Japanese invaded Formosa in reprisal for injuries suffered by Japanese fishermen, Wade acted as mediator, resulting in the payment of an indemnity by the Chinese and the withdrawal of Japan from Formosa. While the settlement advertised China's weakness, the agreement averted a war at that time. In 1875 Wade seized upon the Margary affair to attempt a broad settlement of issues in Sino-British diplomatic relations. A British vice-consul, Augustus Raymond Margary, had been sent up the Yangtze River to meet an expedition led by Colonel Horace A. Browne which had set out to travel from Burma into Yunnan province in south-west China. Although the mission had been sanctioned by the Chinese government, Margary was murdered and the Browne expedition attacked by guerrillas in Yunnan. Wade was instructed to gain redress from the Chinese, but was quick to broaden his demands to involve questions of diplomatic protocol in Peking, trade, travel, and taxes, as well as an investigation of the murder and an indemnity for Margary's family. Taking his cue from Japanese conduct during the Formosa crisis and from Lord Elgin's style of operation, Wade threatened force, sounded uncompromising, and withdrew the legation to Shanghai. Despite appearances, H. B. Morse suggested that Wade's move was less the result of a desire to break off diplomatic relations in preparation for war than of a wish to be at the end of a telegraph line to London. Robert Hart, who as inspector of customs was officially in the service of China, but who was also a long-standing dining partner of Wade's, was sent to Shanghai to mollify Wade. Negotiations began in 1876 in Chefoo (Yantai) between Wade and Li Hongzhang, the Chinese plenipotentiary who was assisted by Hart. The Chefoo convention of September 1876 settled the Margary affair, obtaining Chinese approval for frontier trade between Burma and China, and arranging for a mission of apology to London, which was to become the first resident Chinese legation abroad. Agreement was also reached on protocol and diplomatic etiquette in Peking, and a number of legal issues in cases which involved both Chinese and foreigners were settled. The convention opened up five further ports for trade, and secured the simultaneous collection of import and <i>likin</i> taxes at the treaty ports. None the less, because Wade had agreed to the raising of taxes on opium and the continued imposition of <i>likin</i> taxes outside the treaty ports, the convention ran into opposition in London, and was finally ratified in modified form in 1885. During further negotiations in Peking, Wade angered diplomatic colleagues of other countries as well as Chinese interlocutors. He had also made enemies in the Foreign Office; in 1882 he was recalled to London and retired the following year. Elements of the Chefoo convention continued to be effective in Sino-British relations until the fall of the Ch'ing dynasty in 1912.<br>
<br>Wade's real love was not diplomacy, but the study of the Chinese language. The system of transliteration of Mandarin which he developed and which was modified by H. A. Giles (known as Wade&#150;Giles) was the standard for English speakers for more than a century until the development of pinyin. He periodically sought to retire from the diplomatic service in order to extend his scholarly studies, but failed to do so. He nevertheless produced a number of books on China and Chinese, including the first standard texts on Chinese language, <span class="italic">Wen-chien tzu-ehr Chi: a Series of Papers Selected as Specimens of Documentary Chinese</span> (1867) and <span class="italic">Yu-Yen tzu-ehr Chi: a Progressive Course of Colloquial Chinese</span> (1867). A charter member of the Asia Society in Hong Kong, he wrote important articles on the Chinese army and Chinese government. In 1888 he became the first professor of Chinese at Cambridge University, but published no more and had no students. An avid collector of Chinese books from his earliest days in China, he donated his library to Cambridge University Library. Containing most of the classic works of Chinese philosophy, history, geography, and literature, the Wade collection laid crucial foundations for the serious study of China in Britain.<br>
<br>Wade, who was made KCB in 1875 and GCMG in 1889, died on 31 July 1895 at his home, 5 Salisbury Villas, Station Road, Cambridge. Contemporary colleagues and observers such as Robert Hart and H. B. Morse describe Wade as an intelligent and hard-working man, whose tendency to throw tantrums made him his own worst enemy. Like Hart, he was a Victorian modernizer, hoping to instruct both Chinese and British officials in the ways of progress, and using his office for this end. Unlike Hart, however, his frequent offerings of advice and admonition were prone to cause offence. If he did want in some ways to conduct negotiations on a basis of equality, ultimately he did not resist the temptation to appeal to Britain's superior military power to implement his understanding of how China should develop, and how Sino-British relations should be structured. Yet Wade's interest in China was passionate, and he was firmly convinced that knowledge of the language and sensitivity to Chinese culture were essential to Sino-British relations.<br>
