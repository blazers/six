<span class="headword">Boys,  Edward</span>  (1599&#150;1667), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, born in Hoad Court, Blean, Kent, and baptized on 21 December 1599 in Canterbury Cathedral, was the fifth of ten children of Thomas Boys (<i>d</i>. 1625), of Hoad Court, gentleman, and his first wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1602), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23994/', "Richard Rogers")</script>, dean of Canterbury and suffragan bishop of Dover. Educated at Eton College, Boys matriculated as a pensioner from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in Easter term 1620. Subsequently elected a scholar, he graduated BA in 1624 and proceeded MA in 1627. With his election to a fellowship at Corpus in 1631 Boys embarked on an academic career: in 1634 he received the degree of BD and the same year held the appointment of university preacher.<br>
<br>In 1640, however, Boys was presented to the living of Mautby, a tiny village in Norfolk, by the antiquary and landowner William Paston, his contemporary at Corpus. Freed from the obligations of his college fellowship in 1641, on 22 March that year Boys married, by licence at Canterbury Cathedral, Mary Herne, a widow related through marriage to a Norfolk gentry family; there were no children. Thereafter he appears to have lived out the years of conflict and Commonwealth quietly in Mautby, in his time &#145;a Country Village consisting onely of four Farmers&#146;  (Boys, sig. a 2). His editor, Roger Flynt, another Corpus contemporary, maintained that Boys's retirement was the result of reticence and modesty. More likely Boys was outspoken in his support of Charles I and deemed it expedient to seek the seclusion of a country parish. The leanings of his friends suggested as much: Paston was knighted by Charles I in 1641, Flint was sequestered for delinquency before May 1645, and Joseph Hall, Boys's bishop at Norwich and an admirer of his preaching, was expelled from the diocese about 1647. On 22 May 1651 Boys's library of 2000 books, the parish register, and the parsonage house were all destroyed by fire.<br>
<br>Like many of his contemporaries Boys made obedience to the king a strong element in sermons preached after the restoration of 1660. Of the sixteen published posthumously by Flynt in 1672 four bore directly on this theme; the occasion of one of these (&#145;Carolus redux&#146;) can be precisely dated (7 July 1666). Boys died at Mautby on 10 March 1667 and was buried in the chancel of his church. In his will he left &pound;10 to his old college to add to gifts made during his lifetime: an edition of Binius's <span class="italic">Concilia generalia</span> presented in September 1641 and two volumes of holograph sermons by his uncle John Boys (1571&#150;1625), dean of Canterbury.<br>
