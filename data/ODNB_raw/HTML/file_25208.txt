<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sharp,  Granville</span>  (1735&#150;1813), <span class="occ">author and slavery abolitionist</span>, was born at Durham on 10 November 1735. He was the scion of a clerical family, the ninth and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25220/', "Thomas Sharp (1693&#150;1758)")</script>, archdeacon of Northumberland, and his wife, Judith Wheler (<i>d</i>. 1757). His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25213/', "John Sharp")</script>, archbishop of York; two of his brothers became Anglican clergymen. According to Prince Hoare, his first biographer, Granville:<blockquote>was at a very early age withdrawn from the public grammar-school at Durham, before he had gained more than the first rudiments of the learned languages, and was sent to a smaller school, to be instructed more particularly in writing and arithmetic. (Hoare, 27)</blockquote>His father's straitened financial circumstances led to his being apprenticed in May 1750 to a Quaker linen draper named Halsey, of Tower Hill, London. On Halsey's death in 1753 he continued to serve his family and, in his own words, &#145;was turned over to a Presbyterian, or rather, as he was more properly called, an Independent. I afterwards lived some time with an Irish Papist, and also with another person, who, I believe, had no religion at all&#146;  (ibid., 28). These contacts encouraged Sharp to engage in theological disputation, and he used his leisure to acquire that largely self-taught knowledge of Greek and Hebrew which formed an important basis for his career as a writer. In 1757 he completed his apprenticeship and became a freeman of the City of London as a member of the Fishmongers' Company; the following year the failure of a linen business in which he was employed led him to accept a clerkship in the Ordnance office at the Tower. In 1764 he received promotion to the minuting branch as a clerk-in-ordinary.<br>
<br>During this period Sharp's intellectual interests, particularly in the realms of biblical scholarship, linguistics, and antiquarianism, deepened. He researched into the claim of his former master, Henry Willoughby, to the barony of Willoughby of Parham; he published a reply to Benjamin Kennicott's <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Sacred Vessels Restored by Cyrus</span> (1765), wrote <span class="italic">A Short Treatise on the English Tongue</span> (1767), and completed a book on scriptural prophecies in 1768. Each of these works went into at least two editions, and it was largely on the strength of them that his maternal uncle Granville Wheler offered him a benefice at Great Leek, Nottinghamshire. Wheler was married to the sister of the ninth earl of Huntingdon, whose wife was the celebrated evangelical countess. The connection with evangelicalism remained with Sharp all his life. However, he declined both the offer and the suggestion that he take holy orders.<br>
<br>In the mid-1760s Sharp became seriously interested in the abolition of slavery. His concern seems to have been occasioned in 1765 by his fortuitous encounter at the house of his brother William with a slave, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/100415/', "Jonathan Strong")</script>. William Sharp had medical knowledge, and Strong was seeking treatment after sustaining injuries inflicted by his owner, David Lisle. Granville Sharp took up Strong's case, secured his release from prison when Lisle obtained his arrest as an escaped slave, and fought off a legal challenge which accused him of violating the owner's property rights. Thereafter Sharp, with characteristic devotion to research, applied himself to a detailed study of the legal status of slaves in Britain, as distinct from the colonies, and of the laws of civil liberty in Britain itself. An early result was <span class="italic">A Representation of the Injustice and Dangerous Tendency of Tolerating Slavery</span> (1769). He began to correspond and collaborate with the Quaker abolitionist Anthony Benezet and (from 1773) the Philadelphia abolitionist Benjamin Rush. Soon he took up the cases of other slaves in England, such as Thomas Lewis. His efforts reached a climax with Lord Mansfield's celebrated judgment in the case of James Somerset (1772), which, although much debated subsequently, was widely interpreted as stating that any slave setting foot in England immediately became free. At all events, it was a massive propaganda victory for abolitionists, and Sharp was set on what became the most notable feature of his career. In 1776 he published several anti-slavery works including <span class="italic">The Law of Liberty</span>.<br>
<br>During these years Sharp followed closely the deterioration in the relations between Britain and her North American colonies. Strongly sympathetic to the colonial grievances, he associated himself with traditional whig and Commonwealth libertarian ideas, as espoused by such as Richard Price and John Cartwright. In his <span class="italic">Declaration of the People's Natural Right to a Share in the Legislature</span> (1774) he argued for American representation in the Westminster parliament, claiming that such representation was consistent both with natural rights and with historic English liberties as enshrined in <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. But, since he was &#145;patriot as well as a radical&#146;  (Bonwick, 74), he also deplored the idea of rebellion or American separation, and believed that appropriate reforms, such as the abandonment of parliamentary taxation, could preserve the unity of the empire. In particular he urged that &#145;we should strictly maintain our <i>Loyalty</i> to the <i>Crown</i>, at the same time that we steadily assert our legal and constitutional Rights&#146;  (G. Sharp, <span class="italic">Declaration</span>, 1774, 42). He believed that those &#145;rights&#146; were best safeguarded by measures of constitutional reform, and he argued strongly in favour of annual parliaments.<br>
<br>In 1776 Sharp's opposition to the American War of Independence led him to resign from the Ordnance office. Thereafter he followed no formal profession and was supported by the generosity of his brothers William and James, together with the proceeds from his published works, of which sixty-one are listed in Hoare's biography. The onset of war gave Sharp a further cause to champion: opposition to the use of the press-gang for naval recruitment. In collaboration with James Oglethorpe, to whose <span class="italic">Sailor's Advocate</span> he contributed an introduction, Sharp drew on his libertarian ideology and legal researches to take up an issue which drew widespread support. He was a persistent critic of the colonial and domestic policies of Lord North's administration, which he condemned in his <span class="italic">Address to the People</span> (1778) as arbitrary and corrupt. He became one of the earliest members of the Society for Constitutional Information, founded in 1780; he corresponded with Christopher Wyvill, John Jebb, and other reformers; he wrote strongly against triennial parliaments as an insufficient measure; and he supported the legislative independence of the Irish parliament. In the belief that the ancient constitution represented people rather than property, and as an alternative to the universal suffrage for which he was not an enthusiast, Sharp advocated a revival of the Anglo-Saxon system of frankpledge. It would involve a system of administration from tithing courts to parliament, which would secure the involvement in government, and the preservation of the rights, of an active citizenry. He formulated these ideas in his <span class="italic">Account of the Constitutional Polity of Congregational Courts</span> (1786). Parliamentary reform sat easily with Sharp's anti-slavery convictions; the Society for Constitutional Information supported a Quaker petition against the slave trade in 1783 and reprinted anti-slavery tracts.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Sharp remained a member of the Church of England. Though he did not live in Clapham and was rather more radical than some members of the evangelical <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/42140', "Clapham Sect")</script>, he was none the less associated with it, shared many of its moral priorities, and has been seen by historians of anti-slavery as &#145;a member of the Evangelical core group&#146;  (Anstey, 158) of abolitionists. After the British recognition of American independence in 1783 Sharp's Anglican commitment led him to campaign for the restoration of the episcopalian church in the former colonies. So anxious was he that there be no doubt about the legitimacy of a &#145;true episcopal succession&#146; in America that he insisted, as he told Benjamin Rush, &#145;the first <i>American Bishops</i> should rather receive their consecration from the hands of 3 or 4 of our <i>English Bishops</i> than from the <i>Nonjurors</i> of Scotland&#146;  (Woods, 27), as had happened with Samuel Seabury. His efforts were rewarded with the consecration of the bishops of New York and Pennsylvania in 1787. The <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> is incorrect in stating that Sharp was aided in this process by Archbishop Thomas Secker; Secker died in 1768.<br>
<br>In common with many radicals Sharp compared the state of slavery to that of political reformers allegedly repressed by an unjust government in his own country. Like them, too, he was more concerned with constitutional issues than with the social grievances of the poor in Britain. The latter were not the legal property of others and, as he wrote to Bishop Porteus in 1795, &#145;the English labourer is protected at least from all personal ill usage and outrage by equal laws&#146;  (Anstey, 242&#150;3) and could seek parish relief. From 1776 Sharp began to publish tracts on slavery and corresponded energetically with many leading members, lay and clerical, of the political establishment. In 1783 he tried, unsuccessfully, to institute a private prosecution for murder after the infamous <i>Zong</i> incident (1781), when more than a hundred African slaves were thrown overboard from this slave ship in an effort to defraud the underwriters. When the anti-slavery movement began to organize nationwide petitioning campaigns Sharp was at the forefront. The Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was founded in 1787. When its London committee was set up on 22 May 1787 he was one of its twelve founding members&#151;and one of only three who were not Quakers. Sharp urged the movement to campaign for the immediate abolition of slavery itself as well as the trade, but was in a minority of one. He none the less gave his full endorsement to the motions for the abolition of the British slave trade introduced in the House of Commons by William Wilberforce. Sharp, together with Thomas Clarkson, provided much of the essential information for the abolitionist campaign. He met William Pitt to discuss the matter, and on the outbreak of the French Revolution he corresponded with several French sympathizers in the national assembly. With Clarkson and Wilberforce he helped to sponsor the establishment of a colony for freed slaves at Sierra Leone and published a <span class="italic">Short Sketch</span> for its government in 1786. Sharp was also one of the first directors of the St George's Company, which managed the settlement until it was ceded to the crown in 1808, and he became one of the first directors of the African Institution in 1807.<br>
<br>A combination of mobilization and a change in the religious and intellectual climate had brought much public support to abolitionism since 1788, the year of the first major petitioning movement. In 1792 the House of Commons passed a motion for gradual abolition which faded away in House of Lords committees. The rearguard resistance of the West Indian interest, and fear of the dangers of reform in an atmosphere of potential revolution, inhibited the cause in the later 1790s. Sharp continued to write on the subject, notably in his <span class="italic">Serious Reflections on the Slave Trade and Slavery Wrote in March 1797</span>, published in 1805. He also remained vigorous in the cause of parliamentary reform during that decade. In 1802 he was &#145;almost alone&#146; in protesting against the re-enslavement of free blacks in the conquered French Caribbean islands  (Drescher, 105).<br>
<br>The suggestion that Sharp was not a &#145;real evangelical&#146;  (Cooper, 435) is undermined by his missionary zeal, some of which found expression through his membership of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and his contribution to the foundation of the British and Foreign Bible Society, of which he became the first chairman in 1804. He shared some of the anti-Roman Catholicism espoused by many evangelicals, and in 1813 served as the first chairman of the Protestant Union, a body which existed to oppose Catholic emancipation. His defenders insisted that for all his anti-Catholicism, he &#145;lived in habits of friendship and intimacy&#146; with individual Catholics  (Hoare, 478). Sharp used his biblical researches to take part in a significant theological debate. His <span class="italic">Remarks on the Uses of the Definitive Article in the Greek Text of the New Testament</span> (1798; 3rd edn, 1803) argued strongly for the divinity of Christ and struck a blow against the Socinian position; Benjamin Rush credited the work with the conversion of a (previously) anti-Trinitarian clergyman near Philadelphia  (Woods, 36). As a memoirist in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> put it, Sharp:<blockquote>was sensible that the religion of the divine Saviour and Redeemer of the world requires something more than a cold and indolent assent of the understanding; that it imperiously calls for an entire change in the dispositions of the heart. (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 88, 1818, 491)</blockquote>Music was important in Sharp's social life. He himself played a harp of his own design, and his family formed an orchestra which delighted in musical trips by boat on the Thames, during which they entertained royalty and were charmingly portrayed by J. J. Zoffany. In 1767 Sharp found time to write <span class="italic">A Short Introduction to Vocal Music</span>; it went into a second edition ten years later. His other interests reflected his energy as well as his eccentricity. They included an idea for issuing bales of wool to protect British soldiers in the Peninsular War; a plan to extend London parish relief to all the poor, irrespective of their origin; an insistence that Napoleon was the &#145;little horn&#146; of the book of <span class="roman">Daniel</span>; and more than a passing interest in the sense of the imminence of the apocalypse, widespread in intellectual as well as popular circles at this time. He lived mainly in Garden Court, Temple, London, until the death of his brother William, when he resided with the latter's widow at Fulham. After a gradual physical and mental decline he died there, unmarried, on 6 July 1813 and was buried in All Saints' churchyard, Fulham on 13 July.<br>
<br>Although Sharp was never a popular or even accessible writer, his work was of immense importance to the anti-slavery movement in Britain. It was partly through his efforts that it gained public attention and sympathy and that it transformed itself from a benign climate of opinion to a highly organized campaign. Thomas Clarkson regarded him as a founder of the movement; according to the whig Francis Horner, he was one of those who had started it. He was predictably criticized in West Indian circles, which questioned his motivation; they accused him, for instance, of proposing to withhold charity from the black poor in London to force them to leave for Sierra Leone  (Drescher, 258, n. 74). None the less, he attracted remarkably few personal enemies. Sharp had an exceptionally wide circle of friends, and could win affection as well as respect. James Stephen credited him with &#145;the most inflexible of human wills united to the gentlest of human hearts&#146; and opined that his life was evidence that &#145;it was too soon to proclaim that the age of chivalry was gone&#146;  (Stephen, 2.314).<br>
