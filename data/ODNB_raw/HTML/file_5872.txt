<span class="headword">Coleman,  Thomas</span>  (1597/8&#150;1646), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in Oxford. On 28 April 1615, aged seventeen, he matriculated from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, from where he graduated BA on 10 June 1618 and proceeded MA on 6 July 1621. Appointed rector of Blyton, Lincolnshire, in 1623 by Sir John Wray, at an unknown date he married Elizabeth, whose surname was quite probably Burton and who almost certainly came from a local family. Nothing is known of Coleman's ministry there.<br>
<br>In 1642 Coleman left for London, claiming that he had been persecuted by royalists. On 7 March 1642 the House of Commons voted not to make him lecturer of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, though it named him to the Westminster assembly on 23 April and appointed him rector of St Peter Cornhill, after William Fairfax had been sequestrated in 1643. In August that year the committee for plundered ministers had explicitly requested that he be appointed to a living in London or Hertfordshire. His fast sermon to the House of Commons on 30 August was published as <span class="italic">The Christians Course and Complaint</span> (1643), with an epistle that urged MPs to maintain the purity of religion and denounced burdensome impositions, illegal monopolies, inordinate delays between parliaments, and infringements on liberty. He preached on 29 September at St Margaret's, Westminster, when those present took the covenant; published as <span class="italic">The Hearts Ingagement</span> (1643), his address responded to objections to the oath. After the royalists failed to capture Hull, Coleman described the siege in <span class="italic">Huls Pillar of Providence Erected</span> (1644), attributing the city's deliverance to divine providence. On 12 September 1644 he preached another fast sermon to both houses of parliament, encouraging them to persevere in the war despite the terrible things that God's corrective rod might inflict on them; the sermon was published as <span class="italic">Gods Unusuall Answer to a Solemne Fast</span> (1644).<br>
<br>Coleman ignited a controversy by his fast sermon <span class="italic">Hopes Deferred and Dashed</span> (1645) to the House of Commons on 30 July 1645 in which he called for unity in the church by establishing as few things as possible on a <i>jure divino</i> basis, requiring clear scriptural support for all precepts espoused as divine, limiting the burden of government on ministers to what Christ designated, and recognizing that a Christian magistrate is a governor in the church. Prelacy, in his judgement, was &#145;the Grand-causer&#146; of the civil war  (p. 33), and he favoured presbyterian polity, although of an Erastian rather than a Scottish form. Although his views of independency were mixed he opposed gathered churches because of their inability to provide adequate support to clergy and their willingness to permit the unlearned to become ministers. His assertion that Scottish commissioners and Independents hindered unity so offended the former that he had to apologize on 1 August. Unsatisfied, George Gillespie attacked him in an appendix to <span class="italic">A Sermon</span> (1645) in which he averred that Coleman's proposed cure for disunity was worse than the disease and struck at the root of ecclesiastical government. Other Scottish ministers joined Gillespie in defending the church's unimpeded power to excommunicate against Coleman's Erastian position, and Adoniram Byfield, another member of the assembly, charged Coleman with slighting that body and &#145;our Sister churches&#146; in <span class="italic">A Brief View of Mr. Coleman his New-Modell of Church Government</span> (1645).<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">A Brotherly Examination Re-Examined</span> (1646) Coleman responded to Gillespie, reiterating his preference for presbyterian polity but insisting on parliament's right to establish the church government it considers best. Replying in <span class="italic">Nihil respondes</span> (&#145;1645&#146;), Gillespie accused Coleman of propagating doctrine repugnant to the solemn league and covenant and treating parliament and the assembly derogatorily. Coleman defended himself against Gillespie and Byfield in <span class="italic">Male dicis maledicis</span> (1646), in part by insisting that his views essentially accorded with Byfield's. Gillespie retorted, accusing Coleman in <span class="italic">Male audis</span> (1646) of having wronged the Church of Scotland and opposed the word of God, the solemn league and covenant, and parliamentary ordinances.<br>
<br>Coleman was not without supporters. A skilled Hebraist, he was known as Rabbi Coleman. The most prominent Erastian pamphleteer, he enjoyed the respect of Thomas Case, Thomas Edwards, Thomas Fuller, Lewis du Moulin, and Richard Baxter despite their differences of opinion. On 2 October 1645 he preached a thanksgiving sermon to the House of Commons, later that year he was invited to become the minister at St Bride's, Fleet Street (though he declined), and in March 1646 Robert Baillie complained about his influence with attorneys in the House of Commons. At that time Coleman was translating the writings of Erastus on excommunication, but on 18 March he was stricken with a fever, and four or five days later, according to Baillie, Coleman died in London as a consequence of divine judgment; he was buried in the chancel at St Peter Cornhill on 30 March. His widow retired to Blyton, where, on 7 February 1652, she made a will leaving property to her nephews and nieces in the Burton family; it was proved on 26 September 1653.<br>
