<span class="headword">Oldham,  Henry</span>  (1815&#150;1902), <span class="occ">obstetric physician</span>, was born in Balham, Surrey, on 31 January 1815, the sixth son and ninth child of Adam Oldham (1781&#150;1839), solicitor, and his wife, Ann Lane Penny, daughter of William Stubbington Penny. His father's family claimed descent from Hugh Oldham, bishop of Exeter, the founder of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and of the Manchester grammar school, and another forebear, Francis Penny, was at one time the editor of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. One of Oldham's nephews, <a name="cosubject_35299"></a><span class="headword">Charles James Oldham</span>  (1843&#150;1907), son of James Oldham (1817&#150;1881), who, like his father, practised as a <span class="occ">surgeon</span> in Brighton, invented a refracting ophthalmoscope, and bequeathed &pound;50,000 to public institutions, including the Manchester grammar school, Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and the universities of both Oxford and Cambridge, for the foundation of Charles Oldham scholarships and prizes for classical and Shakespearian study. He died in Brighton on 24 January 1907.<br>
<br>After education at Mr Balaam's school at Clapham (1824&#150;31) and at London University, Henry Oldham entered Guy's Hospital medical school in 1834. In May 1837 he became MRCS and the following September a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries. In 1843 he took the LRCP and in 1857 he became FRCP; he graduated MD at St Andrews in 1858. In 1849, with Dr J. C. W. Lever, he was appointed physician accoucheur and lecturer on midwifery and diseases of women at Guy's Hospital; after twenty years' service he became consulting obstetric physician.<br>
<br>Oldham was an excellent teacher and an impressive lecturer. He was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Guy's Hospital Reports</span>, and published four papers in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Obstetrical Society of London</span>, of which he was one of the founders, an original trustee, and subsequently president (1863&#150;5). He invented the term &#145;missed labour&#146; to describe those cases where the child dies in the womb and labour fails to come on, though the specimen on which he had based his view was subsequently differently interpreted; he also advanced the hypothesis that menstruation was due to periodic excitation of the ovaries, and gave his name to an obstetric instrument, the Oldham perforator. Before his appointment to Guy's Hospital, Oldham had studied embryology in the developing chick by means of coloured injections and the microscope and he subsequently introduced the use of the microscope at Guy's, where he pursued his interest in morbid anatomy. He did not believe in the extensive use of drugs, placing greater emphasis on diet and hygiene as the means to restore health. He was a great walker, an extremely simple eater, and for the last fifteen years of his life he was a vegetarian.<br>
<br>In 1838 Oldham married Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1885), eldest daughter of James Smith of Peckham; they had four daughters and two sons, of whom one died in infancy and the other was Colonel Sir Henry Hugh Oldham CVO, lieutenant of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms. Oldham had an extensive and lucrative practice in the City of London, first at 13 Devonshire Square, Bishopsgate Street, and then at 25 Finsbury Square; about 1870 he moved to 4 Cavendish Place and in 1899 he retired to Bournemouth. Oldham died at Boscombe, Bournemouth, on 19 November 1902, of heart failure, and was buried in Bournemouth cemetery.<br>
