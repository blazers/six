<span class="headword">Dillon,  Arthur Richard</span>  (1721&#150;1806), <span class="occ">archbishop of Narbonne and &eacute;migr&eacute; leader</span>, was born on 1 September 1721 at St Germain-en-Laye, Paris, the fifth and youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7652/', "Arthur Dillon, Jacobite Earl Dillon (1670&#150;1733)")</script>, <i>mar&eacute;chal de camp</i> and head of the Dillon regiment in the French service, and Christiana (1684&#150;1757), daughter of Ralph Sheldon, first equerry to James II of England. Arthur Dillon was intended for the church, and from 1740 was educated at St Sulpice in Paris, the seminary invariably attended by young men destined for leadership positions in the Gallican church, taking his master's degree on 26 October 1743.<br>
<br>After ordination Dillon benefited from Louis XV's particular regard following his (fourth) brother Edward's death leading the Dillon regiment at the battle of Lauffelt in 1747. In the same year Dillon became vicar-general of Pontoise, a post which was usually a springboard to the episcopate. In 1753 he was appointed bishop of &Eacute;vreux; in 1758 he was translated to the archdiocese of Toulouse, and in 1763 became archbishop of Narbonne and primate of the Gauls, a valuable diocese with an income of 250,000 livres annually. In 1766 he additionally received the abbey of St Jean-des-Vignes (diocese of Soissons) <i>in commendam</i>. Dillon also held the titular headship of the abbey of St &Eacute;tienne de Caen (worth 110,000 livres), which he exchanged in 1787 for the equally lucrative religious house of Cigny in the diocese of Rheims. These revenues enhanced his existing fortune, albeit one burdened by his own debts, his efforts to relieve those incurred by other members of the Dillon family, and his personal charity. He spent large sums on his Paris town house and on his estate at Hautefontaine, near Soissons, where he maintained his own pack of staghounds.<br>
<br>An eloquent orator and capable administrator, Dillon was a man who combined intellectual capacity with style and physical presence which went to make up what his niece called &#145;an air of elegant assurance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Madame de la Tour du Pin</span>, 38). Before the revolution he served as president of the general assembly of the clergy of France in 1775 and 1785, and was a member of both the first and second Assemblies of Notables in 1787 and 1788. Though ready to abandon clerical fiscal privileges and to advocate the doubling of the third estate, Dillon defended the hierarchical principle in the Gallican church at the moment it was coming under intensive criticism from the lower clergy. As <i>pr&eacute;sident</i> of the Languedoc estates, the archbishop had a leading influence in the government of the province, and established a reputation as one of the leading <i>pr&eacute;lats administratifs</i> of the pre-revolutionary generation, one who also supported civil rights for members of the reformed faith. He visited the province annually and promoted the building of roads, bridges, canals, harbours, and other improvements in Languedoc, but paid less attention to the spiritual direction of his diocese beyond the immediate vicinity of Narbonne. Dillon was not popular with his neglected parish clergy, and his standing fell generally in 1788&#150;9 through his association with what was increasingly seen as the antiquated constitution of the Languedoc estates.<br>
<br>Dillon was unsympathetic to the changes brought about by the French Revolution, especially the reorganization of the Gallican church by the civil constitution of the clergy, passed by the national assembly in July 1790. Dillon refused to take the oath to the civil constitution and thereby forfeited his possession of the see of Narbonne, which was anyway one of those abolished under this legislation. Until September 1791 he remained on his estates at Hautefontaine, then emigrated to England via the &eacute;migr&eacute; centre of Koblenz, and Prussia. He had debts of 1,800,000 livres when he left France, and the loss of all his offices ensured they were never repaid. In London, Dillon lived modestly, supported by his nephew Viscount Dillon, but his house was still large enough for six other bishops to join him. As the most senior of the prelates exiled in London he resisted efforts by Louis XVIII in 1796&#150;7 to reduce episcopal independence in the interests of a more streamlined organization for the church. He subsequently refused to accept the concordat of 1801, and concerted the opposition of those in London to Pius VII's request for resignation of their sees without reference to a conciliar ruling on the question. Archbishop Dillon died in George Street, Portman Square, London, on 5 July 1806, and was buried in St Pancras old churchyard. Some of his speeches to the general assembly of the clergy were published, as was his uncompromising <span class="italic">Lettre de Monseigneur l'archev&ecirc;que de Narbonne au tr&egrave;s-saint p&egrave;re, en envoyant &agrave; sa saintet&eacute; la lettre des &eacute;v&ecirc;ques r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s &agrave; Londres</span> (1802).<br>
