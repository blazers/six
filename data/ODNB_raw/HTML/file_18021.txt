<span class="headword">Donald</span>, eighth earl of Mar  (1293&#150;1332), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Gartnait, seventh earl of Mar, who died <i>c</i>.1302, when his heir was still a child. Although it has been asserted that Donald's mother was Christian Bruce, sister of the future King Robert, it seems more likely that she was an elder Bruce sibling whose name is unknown. When Robert Bruce, still earl of Carrick, submitted to King Edward in 1302, the conditions of his submission included the granting to him of the wardship and marriage of a boy who was his nephew twice over, as son of his sister and of his wife's brother (Bruce had been married to Isabel, Gartnait's sister). It can be presumed, therefore, that the young Donald, who succeeded as eighth earl of Mar in 1305, had little choice but to attend his uncle's coronation in April 1306. The lad was captured by the English a few months later, most likely in Kildrummy Castle, the centre of his earldom, which fell to Edward I in early September of that year. It was ordered that he should be sent to Bristol Castle, where he was to be spared warding in irons because of his tender years, but in the end he remained in the royal household, serving as a page of the chamber to Edward II. He became closely attached to the English king.<br>
<br>In 1314, as a result of the English defeat at Bannockburn, Earl Donald, together with a number of other important Scottish prisoners, was set free. Having reached Newcastle, however, he changed his mind and elected to stay in the country of his upbringing, rather than return to that of his birth. This had potentially important implications for the long overdue settlement of the Scottish succession. The Bruces claimed the throne of Scotland by virtue of being nearest in degree to David, earl of Huntingdon (<i>d</i>. 1219), through their descent from his second daughter, Isobel. If Earl Donald was indeed descended from an elder sister of King Robert, then he had an interest in the succession which, though it would probably not have taken precedence over the claims of Robert's daughter Marjorie or his brother Edward, was nevertheless of some consequence. As it was, in the absence of his nephew, King Robert (who as yet had no male child) in 1315 settled the succession on Edward and his descendants, followed by the future children of Marjorie, who was soon to be married to Walter Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1326).<br>
<br>Having decided to stay in England, Earl Donald was exonerated from all suspicion of rebel sympathies and was clearly high in royal favour: he received a number of grants from Edward II and in 1320 went abroad with the king. In 1321 he declared his intention of going on pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. As a firm supporter of the English king Donald naturally fought on the royalist side at Boroughbridge in 1322, and was also present later that year when the Scots defeated an English force near Byland. His loyalty was rewarded with the constableship of Bristol Castle in 1326, but, with the deposition of Edward II later in the year, he finally went back to Scotland, primarily in order to lobby for an attempted restoration of the errant English king. King Robert took his nephew's return at face value, restoring his lands to him and even giving him command of one of the Scottish battalions which invaded England in 1327, after the murder of Edward II and the coronation of the young Edward III. Earl Donald was still in Scotland when King Robert died in 1329; his closeness to the throne of Scotland is further underlined by the fact that on 2 August 1332 he was chosen to succeed Thomas Randolph, earl of Moray, as guardian of Scotland on behalf of his cousin David II. Nevertheless there were suspicions that Mar had retained sympathies with England and with Edward Balliol, the son of King John, whom Edward II had invited to the English court from France in 1324, and who led an English-backed invasion of Scotland in the summer of 1332. These suspicions surfaced to disastrous effect when the Scottish forces faced the invaders on Dupplin Moor on 11 August. Robert Bruce of Liddesdale, King Robert's illegitimate son, chose this moment to accuse Mar of being in league with the enemy, whereupon Mar, by way of demonstrating his patriotism, announced that he would himself be the first to engage with the enemy. The result was a thoroughly disorganized attack, which ended in a total Scottish defeat; Mar himself was killed.<br>
<br>Earl Donald had married Isabel Stewart, supposedly the daughter of Sir Alexander Stewart of Bonkill. They had a son, <a name="cosubject_18022"></a><span class="headword">Thomas</span>, ninth earl of Mar  (<em>c.</em>1330&#150;1377)<span class="occ"></span>, who reached his majority in the 1350s, indicating that his parents married about 1328, after Donald's return to Scotland. On 15 January 1348 Edward III (presumably on the strength of his control of much of southern Scotland) assigned Thomas to the care of William Carsewell, Isabel's third husband, who had outlived her. But on 15 May 1350, having by now succeeded to the earldom, he witnessed a charter of David II at Dundee, and in June 1351 made an active entry into the Scottish political scene, being appointed as a commissioner for a peace treaty with England. In 1357 he became a hostage for the payment of David II's ransom, but he was back in Scotland, where he held the office of chamberlain, between 1358 and 1359. Even so he maintained close links with England and on 24 February 1360 entered Edward III's service, saving his allegiance to the king of Scots. This brought him an annual pension of 600 marks, with the additional proviso that he would receive &pound;600 if he lost any lands in Scotland. King David regarded this relationship as unacceptable and in 1361 besieged and took Kildrummy Castle, granting it to Sir Walter Moigne. It has also been suggested that Thomas was a tyrannical overlord and practised extortion on his people; either that, or he had fallen out with Sir William Keith, one of the king's favourites. As an incentive to mend his ways Mar was fined &pound;1000, payable in five years under pain of losing his castle altogether. Kildrummy was still in Moigne's hands as late as 1364, although Thomas was allowed to draw on the issues of his earldom. The castle was finally restored to him at some point before August 1368. In the same year he was granted a safe conduct to go on pilgrimage to St Jean d'Amiens. He continued to travel up and down to England until his death in early 1377, from which date his brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7924/', "William Douglas, earl of Douglas (d. 1384)")</script>, styled himself earl of Mar.<br>
<br>Thomas married twice. His first wife was Margaret, daughter of John Graham, earl of Menteith, whom he later divorced &#145;at the instigation of the devil&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>, 5.585). He subsequently married Margaret Stewart, eldest daughter and coheir of Thomas Stewart, earl of Angus; she outlived him. He had no surviving children of either marriage, and his heir was his sister Margaret, who married William, earl of Douglas.<br>
