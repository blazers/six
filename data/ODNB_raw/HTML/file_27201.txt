<span class="headword">Becket,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [St Thomas of Canterbury, Thomas of London]</span>  (1120?&#150;1170), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was a London merchant's son who rose to be royal chancellor then archbishop, only to be murdered in his cathedral church. His posthumous reputation as a saint and martyr, with enduring thaumaturgical powers, was considerable throughout western Christendom, and in England unrivalled.<h2>
<a name="Youthandschooling"></a>Youth and schooling</h2>Born in Cheapside, London, on St Thomas the Apostle's day (21 December), in 1120 according to the liturgical tradition, and baptized that evening in the tiny neighbouring church of St Mary Colechurch, Thomas was, apparently, the only surviving son of Gilbert Beket and his wife Matilda. Four daughters of the marriage also survived into adulthood, of whom Agnes was eventually Gilbert's heir; and descent continued through Theobald de Helles (of Hills-Court, Kent), her son or nephew. Both Thomas's parents were Normans. Gilbert's father was a farmer or rural knight from Thierville (Eure), in the lordship of Brionne, close to the abbey of Bec; and he was a neighbour and perhaps kinsman of Theobald, abbot of Bec and archbishop of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 1161). Gilbert seems to have become a trader, perhaps in textiles; and his wife, who may have had the pet name of Roheise, is said to have come from Caen. By 1120, however, Gilbert was a property owner in London, living on rents. He had bought for himself a fine house on the north side of Cheapside, in the block between Ironmonger Lane and Old Jewry, an area inhabited by important citizens. At the height of his prosperity he served a term as sheriff of the City (the office of mayor had yet to be created). But later, perhaps after Thomas had grown up, he suffered heavy losses when his properties were destroyed by fire.<br>
<br>Becket's cradle tongue must have been French, and this was, with Latin for official, ceremonial purposes, the language of all the societies in which he spent his life. But it may be assumed, and the early biographers possibly took it for granted, that as a Londoner he could understand and speak English. What the biographers, however, make clear is that his Latin was never first-rate, and that this was so because of the general insufficiency of his education. Moreover, in his youth he never progressed beyond the trivium and quadrivium, the basic curriculum. Law and theology he had to work up later. His schools were not to blame: they were the best that money could buy. At the age of ten he was sent to board at the Augustinian priory at Merton in Surrey, which had a good scholastic reputation. Later he was put into one of the London grammar schools, perhaps St Paul's. And finally, when he was twenty, he spent about a year in Paris.<br>
<br>Becket's schooling may, however, have been intermittent. Even the hagiographers thought that in his youth he was more interested in rural sports than in his books and that his way of life was frivolous. It must have been when living at home after Merton that he became attached to an important Norman baron, Richer de l'Aigle, who, possibly because of some former territorial connection, used to lodge with the Bekets when in the city. Richer, a great-grandson of a knight killed at the battle of Hastings, and himself a soldier of considerable experience, was lord of Hastings in Sussex, an honour granted to his father by Henry I. His mother was the sister of Rotrou (II), count of Perche and Mortagne, and two of his younger brothers had served in Henry I's military household, but were lost when the <i>White Ship</i> went down in 1120. Richer, an older man, used to take Becket on holidays into the country, presumably Sussex, where they hunted and hawked. On one of these expeditions Becket fell into a millstream, either because his horse slipped off a narrow bridge or because he plunged in to rescue his hawk; and he almost drowned. One of his biographers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11628/', "Edward Grim")</script>, thought that the citizen's son learned much from the baron. Indeed, courtly manners helped him greatly in his career. He retained for life an interest in horses and hawks; and he took up soldiering when the opportunity arose. How long his intimacy with Richer lasted is not known. They would meet again at Henry II's court, and Becket may have helped him to recover the lordship of Hastings which he had lost in Stephen's reign. Richer was one of those barons who in 1164 declared the ancient customs in the royal court at Clarendon, an event that launched Becket on the road to martyrdom.<br>
<br>Although as a scholar Becket would have been tonsured, there is no reason to think that his parents intended their only son for a career in the church or that he had a vocation for the priesthood and the cure of souls. While the family was rich, it was expected, no doubt, that Becket would consolidate its position in the urban aristocracy. When his father lost his money the son had to become a practising clerk. So Gilbert got him first into the banking house of his richer kinsman, Osbert Huitdeniers, one of the greatest London merchants, and then into the household of Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury.<h2>
<a name="Appearanceandcharacter"></a>Appearance and character</h2>Becket was endowed with, or acquired, most of the qualities that make for worldly success. He is described in the Icelandic sagas, which drew on <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23730/', "Robert of Cricklade's")</script> lost work, as tall and slender, with a fair skin and dark hair. His features were regular, though his nose was rather long and aquiline. His forehead was wide, his eyes were bright, and his expression was calm and happy. His elegance was enhanced by vivacity. Good-looking in youth, he was handsome when older. He had excellent manners and was a good talker. Clearly he had the ability and the will to please: he was a charmer. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14849/', "John of Salisbury")</script> says that he had very acute senses of smell and hearing and a good memory. Such endowments make a little education go a very long way. He was undoubtedly intelligent, alert, responsive. Once he realized that he had to make his own way he became extremely ambitious. But he could placate rivals as well as ingratiate himself with his masters. Until he became soured by his misfortunes as archbishop he was a very attractive man. But even his friends and champions were aware of some faults. John of Salisbury considered him something of a time-server, a rather harsh judgement on one who served a succession of very different masters with equal zeal. But all the early biographers thought that until he became archbishop (or a little later) he was guilty of frivolity, ostentation in dress, and pursuit of all the follies of the fashionable world.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, they all state unequivocally that Becket always lived a celibate life. This may simply be a feature of the hagiographical legend; but it cannot be disproved. It is clear from his physical activities and achievements that his constitution was basically robust. That he had strong passions can hardly be doubted. According to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9643/', "William fitz Stephen")</script>, he accepted penitential discipline of scourging on his bare back even when royal chancellor. But contemporaries thought that he had a congenitally &#145;cold&#146;, that is to say delicate, stomach, and this seems to have made him particularly liable to stress. There is good tradition that he had a slight stammer. After 1145 he was always an outsider, making his way by his wits; and his struggle to succeed could undoubtedly exert intolerable pressure on him. Enough bouts of what seem to have been psychosomatic illnesses are recorded to suggest that stress and repression were features of his life. It may be that among the emotions he repressed was the sexual. It does not seem, however, that he was attracted to women. He was brought up among them and was close to his mother. But, although he was free to marry until ordained deacon in 1154, there is no evidence at any time of women lovers, friends, or even disciples and confidantes. On the other hand, although some men, for instance Archbishop Theobald and Henry II, found him very attractive, there is no compelling evidence that he was homosexually inclined. It could be that he lacked warmth and disliked physical intimacy.<h2>
<a name="Clerkshipsandroyalchancellorship11451162"></a>Clerkships and royal chancellorship, 1145&#150;1162</h2>From early 1143 until some time in 1145 Becket kept the accounts of the London banker, Osbert Huitdeniers. He then managed to secure a place in the household of Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury&#151;a considerable move up into the purlieus of power. At first derided and intimidated by his much better educated and ecclesiastically orientated fellow clerks, he soon made friends and also gained the archbishop's favour. He was sent for a year to study law at Bologna and Auxerre and was even employed on missions to the papal curia. Thus he not only entered into the fellowship of men who were to be of importance in the English church but also was groomed to join them. In 1154, when Theobald secured the archbishopric of York for his archdeacon, Roger de Pont l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que (<i>d</i>. 1181), he gave the vacant archdeaconry to Becket. This formed the nucleus for a collection of benefices, including Bramfield in Hertfordshire, St Mary-le-Strand in London, Otford in Kent, prebends in London and Lincoln cathedrals, and the provostship of Beverley in Yorkshire&#151;mostly the gifts of promoted Canterbury clerks. Becket was becoming rich, and at the age of thirty-four was ready for greater things.<br>
<br>Within a year, although he retained the archdeaconry and benefices, Becket changed his master again. He had probably been involved in the negotiations, led by Theobald, which secured the succession of the Angevin, Henry FitzEmpress, to the English throne after Stephen's death; and shortly after Henry's coronation in his twenty-second year on 19 December 1154, Becket was witnessing royal charters as chancellor. It seems that the archbishop and bishops pushed him on Henry as their agent in the royal court and as one who might restrain a youthful ruler widely suspected of being headstrong and anti-clerical. The royal chancellorship was basically only another, even if more prestigious, clerkship. But Becket, by becoming Henry II's intimate friend, was to transform it into an important office. He soon became Henry's boon companion on the <i>iter</i> round the Angevin &#145;empire&#146;, mostly on the continent, sharing all his master's pastimes except, as sources affirm, the sexual. He certainly shared in the royal wealth, receiving valuable custodies and other bounties from his master. In 1164, when Henry, by then an enemy, called in his debts, he asked him to account for &pound;30,000. His identification with royal policies, consequent on his complete dependence on royal favour, inevitably disappointed his clerical backers. With hindsight, some of the memorialists considered that this was an aberrant interlude in the martyr's career, in which he dissimulated and did his best for the church. But to all appearances Becket revelled in this period of worldly grandeur, although once again he had to overcome the contempt and envy of established servants and courtiers. The high points in his career as a royal favourite were his magnificent legation to the French king in 1158, and his participation the next year in Henry's campaign to &#145;recover&#146; the county of Toulouse. In the latter he had 700 knights under his command and took an active part in the fighting. Although the archdeacon's grandeur and military exploits were not necessarily abhorrent to the English church, the &#145;scutage of Toulouse&#146;, the tax to pay for the war which fell heavily on the church, and for which Becket was held responsible, was never forgotten, even by his friends and apologists, such as John of Salisbury.<h2>
<a name="ArchbishopofCanterburytheearlyyears11621163"></a>Archbishop of Canterbury: the early years, 1162&#150;1163</h2>On 18 April 1161 Archbishop Theobald died, his last months saddened by the refusal of the king and Becket, both busy on the continent, to visit him. The archdeacon was still on campaign, this time in the Vexin, commanding troops in a border war against Henry's overlord, the French king Louis VII (<i>r</i>. 1137&#150;80), and, apparently, displaying outstanding courage and gallantry. Theobald, who, despite some disillusion, wanted Becket to succeed him at Canterbury, accused his prot&eacute;g&eacute; of ingratitude. At this juncture Becket too fell ill, and, in contrast, was visited by both kings, who had made a truce. Henry took his time over Theobald's replacement. He had quickly given Becket custody of the temporalities of the archbishopric; but secrecy and procrastination had been drilled into him by his mother, he had many other things on his mind, and to get Becket elected to the see would not be plain sailing in view of his obvious unfitness for the office. All archbishops of Canterbury since the conquest, but one, had been monks; and the monks of the cathedral see, Christ Church, claimed sole right of election. They had no reason to love Becket, for he had no love for them and had abetted Theobald's repression of the convent. Also, monastic bishops were available, primarily Gilbert Foliot, bishop of Hereford (<i>d</i>. 1187), who was later bishop of London, a pious theologian, who could be thought ideally suited. But Becket's promotion from archdeacon to archbishop would support some of Henry's ambitions. He wanted to secure his dynasty by having his eldest son, Henry, crowned king of England. He aimed at safeguarding his vast French fiefs, and even, perhaps, uniting England and France, by marrying the young Henry to Louis VII's heir, Margaret. And he would obtain Pope Alexander III's assistance for his schemes by supporting him against imperial antipopes. A capable and amenable archbishop of Canterbury could have an important role. He could crown the young Henry, act as his guardian, direct a subordinate government in England, and also put through some administrative reforms. Moreover, to have a chancellor archbishop would put Henry on a par with the great German emperor, Frederick Barbarossa (<i>r</i>. 1152&#150;90).<br>
<br>By the time the king had come to a decision, Becket himself had misgivings. He had enjoyed to the full his life at the royal court, the archbishopric would confer few worldly advantages, and he must have been conscious of some unsuitability for the office. But the papal legate overcame his reluctance; Becket conducted the young Henry to England; the royal will smothered all opposition among the electors and associated bishops; and on 23 May 1162 a royal council of bishops and notables at Westminster confirmed the election by the monks, and the young Henry, empowered by his father, duly gave the royal consent. Becket must have done homage and fealty to Henry II, presumably in April when taking leave of him in Normandy. A novelty, apparently demanded by Henry de Blois, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1171), at the Westminster council, was that Becket was given by those acting for the king some form of acquittance from all secular obligations, an attempt on the part of the uneasy church to get the slate wiped clean. On 2 June he was ordained priest at Canterbury and on the following day, in the presence of the young Henry, consecrated archbishop by Henry of Winchester, <i>vice</i> London, and the other fourteen suffragan bishops. A mission to the pope secured the pallium, and on 10 August the archbishop received this token of his papal vicariate barefooted and prostrate in the cathedral. The one part of the grand scheme left uncompleted was the coronation of the Young King, perhaps because of the rivalry between Canterbury and York, in the person of Roger de Pont l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que. It had to wait eight years.<br>
<br>In 1162 Becket was archbishop, archdeacon, royal chancellor, and the holder of a large number of ecclesiastical benefices and royal custodies&#151;an arch-pluralist of transient offices and properties. He was also separated from the king, who lingered on the continent. It is clear that the tyro priest had decided to play a completely new role, which he had to learn. It was not entirely unfamiliar; but his life for some eight years had been to all appearances that of a royal courtier and knight. It took him a little time to adjust. He retained, perhaps until after the Council of Clarendon (January 1164), his light-coloured clothes, which affronted the Christ Church monks, whose respect he never obtained before his death; and he recruited a staff of secular clerks on the model of Theobald's. He took over three or four clerks, including John of Salisbury (<i>d</i>. 1180), from his predecessor, and from the Chapel Royal went with him five or six, among whom were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13014/', "Herbert of Bosham")</script> and William fitz Stephen. These three wrote lives after his death. Some of the rest were recruited from the households of other bishops. He is said to have had fifty-two clerks as chancellor and to have attended the Council of Northampton in October 1164 with almost forty. Although they included those whom Herbert of Bosham called the <i>eruditi</i> (scholars), most were chosen for their legal and administrative competence. This large clerical contingent was paralleled in his household by the secular component of knights, noble boys, and servants; and the size of his <i>familia</i> was a feature of his grandeur. Indeed, as archbishop Becket improved on the magnificence he had displayed as chancellor. His hospitality was lavish, his alms-giving extravagant. He also, under the tuition of his chaplains and Herbert of Bosham, carried out his duties meticulously, spent time in private devotions, and studied theology. The new purpose in his life was not only to be a great archbishop but also to recover and, no doubt, extend the rights of the archbishops of Canterbury. His taking his predecessor, Anselm (1093&#150;1109), as his model, portended a stormy tenure of his see. His receipt of the pallium seems to have triggered his renunciation of his other offices, the royal chancellorship and the archdeaconry&#151;the former presumably because it was now beneath his dignity. Henry was offended; and it may be that it was he who forced Becket to surrender the archdeaconry to Geoffrey Ridel (<i>d</i>. 1189), keeper of the king's privy seal and hitherto Becket's deputy and workhorse at the chancery, who continued to perform as acting chancellor.<br>
<br>Becket's arrival at Canterbury after a thirteen months' vacancy upset many vested interests. He was thought to have obtained a royal writ authorizing him to recover lands wrongfully alienated by his predecessors or usurped by laymen. Consequently he revoked all existing leases of archiepiscopal demesne and reactivated claims to several estates and services presently in the hands of some important barons. One of those he disturbed was an important royal servant, John Marshal, and this affair was to play an important part in his downfall in 1164. The king returned to England in January 1163, but, although distressed by Becket's behaviour, concealed his feelings. At the end of April Becket left, with most of the English hierarchy, for Alexander III's general council at Tours, and seems to have repeated the glory of his embassy to Louis VII in the ecclesiastical sphere. He took the opportunity to petition for Anselm's canonization; but the process was crowded out, and subsequent events prevented its completion.<h2>
<a name="Thequarrelwiththeking11631164"></a>The quarrel with the king, 1163&#150;1164</h2>Becket returned from Tours apparently inspired to defend the liberties of the English church, especially those of Canterbury, against lay tyrants. And almost immediately, at the beginning of July, he clashed with Henry at Woodstock over the king's proposal that sheriff's aid, a traditional surcharge to the general land tax (geld), should be diverted from the sheriffs to the royal treasury. A measure which, as chancellor, he would probably have supported, he now vehemently opposed; and Henry, for the moment isolated, had to drop it. This was the point when a growing estrangement became an unbridgeable rift. Henry could not forgive the man he had raised from the dust and heaped with honours and riches for repaying him in this fashion. He aimed at Becket's humiliation and destruction. And the archbishop, a proud man and serving under a new banner, would not willingly back down. Principles were at stake.<br>
<br>The battlefield turned out to be the &#145;evil&#146; royal customs in the English church, particularly those concerning criminous clerks. Since the eleventh century ecclesiastical reformers in western Christendom had been attempting to free the church from improper lay control and those practices that were repugnant to canon law. In England, Archbishop Anselm had been active in the cause against William II and Henry I; and during Stephen's relatively weak reign the church had made gains that Henry II wanted to reverse. He thought that the laity was being harassed by archidiaconal and rural decanal courts, intent on punishing sins as a source of revenue. He was enraged at the church's protection of criminals in holy orders from the appropriate penalties under secular law (benefit of clergy). And he disliked the growing practice of litigants appealing from English church courts to the papal curia. None of these particular matters had caused much, if any, trouble in the past since all authorities had joined forces in the struggle against criminals and other dissidents. However, the increasing disentanglement of church and state (often symbolized as the two swords) and the renewed interest in jurisprudence sharpened the distinction between the several jurisdictions, especially royal and ecclesiastical, and made rivalry and collisions inevitable. Yet the basic common interest remained and usually prevented serious conflict.<br>
<br>Several cases where the archbishop had prevented a clerk, convicted in a lay court of a felony, from suffering the appropriate lay penalty of mutilation or death, were brought to Henry's notice. On 13 October 1163 he assembled an old-fashioned national church council at Westminster to honour the translation of the body of Edward the Confessor to a new tomb in the abbey, consequent on his canonization by Alexander III on 7 February 1161 as an appropriate reward to Henry for his allegiance. After the ceremony Henry, fortified by contact with his saintly predecessor, aired some of his grievances in the assembly. And when he elicited no support, he asked the bishops if they would observe the ancient customs of the realm. This was reminiscent of demands made by William II and Henry I on Anselm; and at Westminster Becket and his colleagues echoed Anselm's reply: they could only do so &#145;saving their order&#146;, that is to say, excepting anything that was contrary to canon law. Next morning Henry disgraced Becket by removing the young Henry from his tutorship and depriving him of all the custodies and honours he had granted him as chancellor. Although Becket still had the nominal support of the episcopate for his attitude towards &#145;evil&#146; royal customs, there was nowhere any stomach for a battle with the crown. Alexander III was of the same mind. He relied on Henry's assistance and regarded the conflict as unnecessary and inopportune. This view he was to hold until the end, yet would stand up for ecclesiastical rights when he could and never throw a principled archbishop to the wolves. As for Becket, he was to have ample time in which to produce a theological objection to the double punishment he perceived in the custom that Henry wished to confirm or revive, by which a man in holy orders, convicted in a lay court of a serious crime, was released to an ecclesiastical court to be stripped of his orders and then returned as a layman to the secular authorities to receive his punishment under secular law.<br>
<br>After Westminster both king and archbishop appealed to the pope, the one to get English customs allowed, the other to get them condemned. Henry also wanted privileges for the archbishop of York which would allow his use as an alternative primate in England. Alexander prevaricated, but in November sent Philip, abbot of Aum&ocirc;ne in Blois, to urge moderation, even dissimulation, on Becket. In the end, the archbishop, assured that Henry required only a verbal assent to the customs (like Anselm in similar circumstances in May 1095), promised Henry at Woodstock, without making any verbal reservations, that he would observe the customs of the realm. Whereupon Henry summoned a great council to meet at Woodstock towards the end of January 1164 in order to confirm and publicize his victory. Using the support of his barons and officials and taking advantage of divisions among the bishops, Henry browbeat Becket into declaring in the hearing of all that he would observe the laws and customs of the kingdom in good faith; and the rest of the bishops followed suit. The king then ordered that these customs be discovered and declared; and by the following morning a schedule of sixteen miscellaneous clauses was produced as a chirograph dated 29 January. But, although Becket and the bishops evaded sealing this document, it was accepted even by the hagiographers that Becket, and at his command all the bishops, had agreed unconditionally to observe the constitutions of Clarendon, including a clause that defined the customary method of treating criminous clerks. Becket also accepted that in so doing he had sinned. He suspended himself from priestly duties, imposed penance on himself and sent a report to the pope. But he agreed to write to Alexander asking him to confirm the English customs. The pope, typically, simply took no notice.<h2>
<a name="Disgraceandexile11641165"></a>Disgrace and exile, 1164&#150;1165</h2>Once Becket had incurred royal disgrace, his servants and friends began to abandon him and, fearing the worst, he began to negotiate with Louis VII of France for asylum, a correspondence which the royalists would have considered treasonable. After an unsuccessful attempt in the late summer to escape to France in order to consult the pope, then at Sens, he was summoned by the king to attend a council of the magnates to be held in Northampton Castle on 6 October, where he was to answer a charge made by John Marshal that he had denied him justice in his feudal court. When this charge fizzled out, Henry accused him of the embezzlement of royal revenues while serving as chancellor. And Becket knew, when the king refused an offer of 2000 marks, which Henry, bishop of Winchester, offered to find, in settlement of all claims, that he was in great peril, perhaps, he thought, of imprisonment or even death, although he probably mistook rumoured threats for serious intentions.<br>
<br>On Tuesday 13 October, before the bishops could declare the court's judgment on him, Becket made a preventative appeal to the pope. Whereupon Henry decided that they should make a counter-appeal and do their best to get Alexander to depose him. Judgment would be pronounced by the barons. It was also decided to add Becket's appeal, deemed to be in breach of the constitutions of Clarendon, which he had sworn to observe, to the list of his crimes. But when the chief justiciar approached, Becket refused to hear the judgment: he had been cited only in the case of John Marshal; besides, barons were incompetent to judge an archbishop. He marched out of the room, slipped out of the castle, and the next day, before dawn, in a downpour, found a way out of the walled town and with three companions rode hard for Lincoln. Then, in disguise, he made a slow and devious way to Eastry, a Canterbury manor near Sandwich. Finally, on 2 November, he crossed the channel in a small boat, landing that afternoon near Dunkirk in the county of Flanders.<br>
<br>Becket's first aim was to seek the protection of the king of France, who welcomed him at Soissons, and then secure the support of the pope, a fellow exile at Sens, despite Henry's efforts to keep these princes at least neutral. But Louis realized that he could use Becket against Henry and the pope started as he was to continue throughout Becket's exile, by avoiding the trap of having to pronounce a definitive sentence on any of the matters at issue. When Becket produced his copy of the constitutions of Clarendon and took Alexander through them clause by clause, his weary auditor eventually declared that none of the laws was good and some were directly contrary to canon law; but some others were tolerable. Since he seems not to have indicated which were which, and never put his views into writing, the matter remained satisfactorily in suspense. If Becket offered to resign his see because of his transgressions, it was refused. And it was decided that he should retire to the Cistercian abbey at Pontigny in the duchy of Burgundy, outside the French royal demesne, not too distant from Sens and the courier routes, but situated in a wilderness, out of sight.<br>
<br>Dependent on charity&#151;mainly Louis VII's, for Henry had confiscated all his possessions and taken the archbishopric into custody&#151;Becket could afford to assemble no more than a basic household at Pontigny from the large pool of his family, servants, and supporters whom the king had banished from England. Robert, canon of Merton, remained his chaplain. William de Capes, his marshal, was in charge of the lay servants, including Becket's valet, Brown, and all secular matters. Herbert of Bosham seems to have been at the head of the chancery and to have had the archbishop's ear. Other important clerks were Alexander-Llywelyn, Becket's Welsh cross-bearer, Lombardo di Piacenza, John Cantor (Planeta), Henry of Houghton, and Gunter of Winchester. John of Salisbury distanced himself by living at Rheims with his old friend, Pierre de Celle, abbot of St R&eacute;mi, but could always be called on for help. These clerks served Becket in three main ways. They produced the letters needed for the constant collection of intelligence and diplomacy on behalf of the archbishop's cause. They served as bearers of the letters and as diplomats, operating usually in pairs. And they formed an academy in which Becket improved his education, especially&#151;to John of Salisbury's regret&#151;in the field of law.<br>
<br>Once again Becket's life had taken a sharp turn. His disgrace and reclusion were a great shock to one so outgoing and in many ways so worldly. He gave himself to private devotions and despair and had to be coaxed back to some normality by Herbert. But, although living among devout monks, he never became a monk, even, it seems, <i>in petto</i>. He blamed his fall on the &#145;traitor&#146; bishops, particularly Gilbert Foliot of London, and other evil courtiers rather than directly on the king. And some vestiges of his love for Henry persisted until the end. The exile was a souring experience. Although dependent on Louis and Alexander, he could not completely trust either; and there was dissension in his household as in all &eacute;migr&eacute; societies. Becket had become a pawn in two intertwined power struggles, the rivalry of Henry and Louis and the contest between Alexander and the imperial antipope. And the great web of diplomacy he spun does not seem to have had much influence on what happened. He had to wait on events. <i>Expectavi</i> (I have been waiting) is a word which occurs often in the &#145;Becket correspondence&#146;; and the event most awaited was a death. Yet he was not passive. And his endurance, persistence and courage are remarkable. He stood at times <i>contra mundum</i>, and, after the first shock, could not be moved.<h2>
<a name="Attemptsatreconciliation11651169"></a>Attempts at reconciliation, 1165&#150;1169</h2>In August 1165, when Alexander was about to venture back into Italy, he imposed a truce on Becket to last at least until Easter 1166. He would not have Henry provoked at such a time. And while the king celebrated Easter at Angers he received some of the archbishop's clerks, including John of Salisbury and Herbert of Bosham, who wished to explore the possibility of returning to England, possibly because they feared what might happen when the truce expired. Neither was offered acceptable terms. And the worst was to happen. Alexander, back in Rome, at Becket's urgent entreaty, began to arm him against his enemies. Among a portfolio of privileges and measures dated April&#150;May was the grant of a papal legation in England, excluding only the diocese of York but not the person of the king. In anticipation of its receipt, Becket started to go on pilgrimages. In June he travelled south from Soissons to the Cluniac abbey of V&eacute;zelay, with the secret intention, hidden even from his clerks, who he feared might try to stop him, of using his legatine powers to strike against his enemies. On Whitsunday (12 June), at the invitation of the abbot, he celebrated the public mass, preached to the congregation on his wrongs and sufferings, and then launched his anathemas. He condemned the constitutions of Clarendon and those who supported and enforced them, quashed explicitly about half the clauses, and finally passed sentences of anathema and excommunication on all the royal servants who had been involved in the various measures against him, some of them by name, but not the king. In November the pope, rather grudgingly, confirmed his legate's actions.<br>
<br>Henry replied to these sentences by getting both the Norman and the English bishops to appeal to the pope against them and by pressing the Cistercian order to expel Becket from Pontigny. The archbishop's clerks, if not their master, had tired of their seclusion; and in November 1166 the exiles, at the invitation of Louis, moved to the ancient Benedictine abbey of St Columba outside the north wall of the royal and archiepiscopal city of Sens. There Becket remained for four years. Edward Grim, on the authority of Becket's chaplain, Robert of Merton, and Guernes, on the testimony of the servant Brown, describe the archbishop's secret austerities behind a fa&ccedil;ade of normality. Their master participated in the monastic horarium and celebrated mass each day. He drank the best wine that money could buy, but always diluted with water, and only so as to warm his congenitally cold stomach. He ate handfuls of ginger and cloves for the same purpose. His bedchamber was furnished with a leather-bound wooden bed covered with costly sheets of the finest and whitest linen and an embroidered quilt strewn with a little straw. But his shirt and breeches were of the roughest goat's-hair; engaged in private prayer, he was hardly ever in his bed; and at least three times a day he was scourged by his chaplain on his bare back until the blood flowed. With these and other mortifications he destroyed all carnal desires.<h2>
<a name="Papalattemptsatasettlement11671170"></a>Papal attempts at a settlement, 1167&#150;1170</h2>While Becket was at Sens it was the pope, always under threat from a rival, who was most anxious for a settlement of the quarrel, and he dispatched legates <i>a latere</i> to this end in 1167, 1168&#150;9, and 1170. But, since neither Henry nor Becket shifted substantially from their entrenched positions, and Alexander would not until 1170 authorize his legates to impose a solution on the parties, there was stalemate. Becket merely clarified his terms. He required the abrogation of all &#145;evil&#146; customs affecting the church in England, the restoration of himself and all his fellow sufferers in the cause to all their former offices and possessions, compensation for all their losses during their exile, and the punishment of all those who had injured them in any way. Henry, however, although he was determined to keep the rights he claimed to have inherited from his ancestor Henry I, did in 1169 offer a series of important concessions: he would abandon any bad customs introduced since 1154, or 1135, and would even have them all scrutinized by learned churchmen. Also, when negotiations for a settlement began seriously in that year, he abated some of the financial claims he had made against Becket at Northampton. In fact, many of Becket's less fanatical supporters believed that the king was offering terms on which the archbishop could honourably return to Canterbury and, with Henry's co-operation, settle outstanding details.<br>
<br>Becket, however, so distrusted the king that he regarded all these concessions as no more than baits to lure him into Henry's dominions where he would be arrested and the projected reforms abandoned. His fears were expressed in his reiterated demand for a kiss of peace from Henry as a pledge of his good faith. His attitude began to be regarded by many of his well-wishers as paranoid, and throughout 1169 there was growing irritation and despair at the wanton prolongation of this scandalous situation. It can be thought that the end shows how right Becket was. But his protraction of the dispute and its untidy resolution at Fr&eacute;teval in July 1170 contributed to the dreadful result. Between 1167 and 1170 Alexander kept Becket on a fairly tight rein. In 1167 the legates, impatient with his intransigence, allowed all those excommunicated at V&eacute;zelay to be absolved, if penitent; and many were. Becket regarded these absolutions as invalid. In the winter of 1167&#150;8 Alexander in effect suspended Becket's legation until he and the king were reconciled or, at the latest, 5 March 1169. When the deadline expired, Becket, at Clairvaux on Palm Sunday (13 April), excommunicated ten persons, including the bishops of London (Gilbert Foliot) and Salisbury 
    (Jocelin de Bohun, <i>d</i>. 1184)
  , whose offences he considered notorious, and announced that he would extend the list on Ascension day (29 May). All these sentences, at the pope's request suspended until Michaelmas (29 September), Becket reactivated on that day.<h2>
<a name="NegotiatingareturntoEngland11691170"></a>Negotiating a return to England, 1169&#150;1170</h2>What the principal intermediaries&#151;the legates <i>a latere</i> and Louis of France&#151;worked to achieve was a personal reconciliation of the parties on general terms, in the hope that shelved problems and disputes would disappear in time. Once Becket had recovered Canterbury, Henry and Louis could themselves make a permanent peace treaty and together set out on a crusade to the Holy Land. Becket and Henry did meet at Montmirail on 7 January 1169, only for the archbishop, to the dismay of all except Herbert of Bosham, to add a saving clause to the agreed words of his submission to the king. They then came very close to an agreement at Montmartre in Paris on 18 November, when Becket backed out because of Henry's prevarication over a kiss of peace. After this failure Becket reactivated all sentences imposed on his enemies, threatened that unless peace was made by 2 February 1170 he would impose a general interdict on England, and sent for a new portfolio of papal bulls against his opponents in the kingdom.<br>
<br>Alexander, too, had run out of patience. In letters dated 19 January 1170 he rehearsed what he believed to be an agreed &#145;form of peace&#146;. This was essentially the terms laid down by Becket, but slightly modified to make them less offensive to the king. And the pope commissioned Rotrou, archbishop of Rouen, and Bernard, bishop of Nevers, to get them formally accepted by the contestants. Moreover, if Henry would not complete the major requirements within forty days of being ordered so to do, the commissioners were to subject all his continental lands to an interdict, without hindrance of appeals. But before the ultimatum, delayed by the usual expedients, expired, the conflict ended unexpectedly and fortuitously. Henry wanted, for various reasons, to have his eldest son, the young Henry, immediately crowned king; and he still had some papal bulls, obtained in 1161 when Canterbury was vacant, which allowed the archbishop of York to perform the ceremony. Becket, alerted by rumours, secured papal prohibitions of such a grave breach of Canterbury's privileges; but it is doubtful whether, in view of Henry's security measures, these were published in England. The coronation was performed on 14 June in Westminster Abbey by Roger de Pont l'&Eacute;v&ecirc;que assisted by some ten English and Norman bishops; and then Henry returned to Normandy to face the music.<br>
<br>When Becket recovered from the shock, his anger was directed more at the bishops who had taken part in the ceremony than at the king. He also believed, erroneously, that the order of service had been revised, so that the young Henry, instead of swearing to protect the holy church of God, its liberties, and servants, was made to swear to observe the ancient customs of the kingdom (that is, the constitutions of Clarendon). He therefore sent to Alexander for bulls against all the guilty bishops and supporters of the constitutions and prepared to complete the peace negotiations with the king, so that he could wreak vengeance on his treacherous suffragans. The preliminaries were easily achieved. Henry, when presented on his arrival in Normandy about 24 June with Alexander's ultimatum, accepted from the commissioners the &#145;form of peace&#146;, with the only reservation of the kiss of peace, since he had sworn at Montmartre never to give it. The commissioners then persuaded Becket to attend a conference between Henry and Louis planned for 21 July near Fr&eacute;teval in Touraine.<h2>
<a name="Aninsubstantialreconciliationanditsbreakdown1170"></a>An insubstantial reconciliation and its breakdown, 1170</h2>The business went through with hardly a hitch. The one obstacle, the kiss of peace, was negotiated by Henry's oath, warranted by the archbishop of Sens, that by refusing it he was not laying a trap for the archbishop, and he also gave some assurance about giving the kiss freely at some later date. This was the only concession Becket made except for a temporary postponement of the receipt of damages. On 22 July, in a long private meeting, with both men on horseback, Becket rehearsed his grievances, and Henry gave soft answers and assurances which, inevitably, were recollected differently by the parties in the following months. But at the time Becket was satisfied. Both men were deeply moved by the meeting, and there was an emotional reconciliation. It was not, however, without reservation. Henry granted his peace and their possessions to all Becket's clerks and companions. But when Becket was asked to reciprocate in respect of the king's supporters, particularly Geoffrey Ridel, he refused. His useful excuse, to be repeated on later occasions, was that the sentences of excommunication were Alexander's and only he could remove them.<br>
<br>Becket, Henry of Bosham informed the pope, had won a glorious victory. But the archbishop, despite plenty of advice and warning from Alexander and many others, had not the mind to win the peace. From Fr&eacute;teval to the end, however much he disguised his motives by an appeal to principles, he was intent on revenge. Although Henry at Fr&eacute;teval urged him to rejoin the court and travel with him at the royal expense, the exile insisted on returning immediately to France and Sens to give thanks to all those who had helped him. He then refused to go to England until he was sure that the terms of the agreement, especially the return of his and the others' estates, were being implemented. He also needed money to pay off his creditors. Moreover, he was waiting for the arrival of papal sentences against the English bishops. Hence, after his one-day meeting with Henry in July, he did not see him again until the end of September in the Loire valley, when he complained about the slowness of the restoration of his estates, provoked a quarrel, and then made it up. He left Sens for England on 1 November.<br>
<br>The recovery of properties after six years' alienation was no easy matter, and the senior king's absence from England did not help. So Becket and his party, still short of money, lingered in France. Further delay was caused by the unsuitability of the papal letters that arrived towards the end of October in answer to Becket's complaints about the coronation. Alexander suspended all those bishops who had taken part in the ceremony and sworn to observe the constitutions of Clarendon, and he also decreed that the bishops of London and Salisbury had lapsed into excommunication. There were also references to the improper coronation service and to Henry's crimes against the church. Even Becket could see that in the post-war period these letters were needlessly provocative, and he sent immediately to the pope for a new set with the same penalties but without the offensive passages. These could not be expected much before February 1171. However, a confirmation of Becket's legatine powers, which reached him towards the end of November in a batch of letters dated 8&#150;13 October, after Alexander had heard of the peace, gave him the power to act, although, typically, the pope counselled mercy and magnanimity. And, about the same time, he was given cause to act, for he heard that the English bishops, together with the electors to all the sees that had fallen vacant during the exile, were preparing to cross the channel to join the king and not only take defence measures against the archbishop's threats but also, probably, elect some of those royal clerks who had been Henry's agents against their spiritual lord. Naturally Becket regarded all this as an intolerable injury to the church of Canterbury. He decided to return to England and act. He and a small party travelled to Wissant in the county of Boulogne. He sent ahead a servant in disguise to serve sentences against Roger of York, Gilbert of London, and Jocelin of Salisbury, and, probably on 30 November, crossed at night to Sandwich.<br>
<br>Becket knew that his return would be perilous. But he was a brave man, a fatalist who put his trust in God, and, despite the views of some of the hagiographers, it is clear that he did not seek martyrdom: his aim was to defeat his enemies. He dealt successfully with the royal officials who met his arrival; his reception by the Christ Church monks on 2 December was at least decorous, and he gave each of them a kiss of peace. To all who asked him to remit the sentences on the bishops, he gave his standard reply, that they were the pope's&#151;although his legation was not completely consistent with that. While Roger of York, Gilbert of London, and Jocelin of Salisbury went to Normandy to complain to the king, Becket started a visitation of his diocese, which alarmed many, and hoped to spend Christmas with the young king at Winchester. But since it was believed that the archbishop held his coronation invalid, and rumoured that he intended to dethrone the youth, the king's guardians and advisers refused the visit and ordered him to return to Canterbury and stay there. Becket, who had a warm regard for young Henry, probably intended only to insist on his recrowning in order to remove any possible defect, and he was disappointed by his failure. The enthusiastic welcome, however, that he received from the people wherever he went, although it alarmed the regency government, buoyed him up.<br>
<br>On his return to Canterbury, Becket began to discipline his monks, refusing to ordain all those, save one, who had been admitted since his departure in 1164&#151;a penalty he later revoked; and he was blockaded in the city by Ranulf de Broc, a royal servant who had had custody of the temporalities during the exile and had been stripping them before handing them back. On Christmas day Becket preached to the people in the cathedral and then from the pulpit excommunicated all violators of the rights of his church and the fomenters of discord in general, and named just a few. Next he announced the sentences which had been awarded to all those prelates involved in the illegal coronation. On the following day he dispatched some of his most trusted clerks, including Herbert of Bosham and Alexander of Wales, on missions to the pope, Louis of France, and other French notables to report that the terms of the peace promised by Henry at Fr&eacute;teval had not been carried out, and, presumably, to ask the pope to lay an interdict on the king's continental lands.<h2>
<a name="Murderinthecathedral29December1170"></a>Murder in the cathedral, 29 December 1170</h2>At Henry II's Christmas court at Bur-le-Roi, near Bayeux, the events were regarded very differently. The three visiting prelates probably voiced the general view that it was Becket who had violated the peace, particularly by suspending nearly the whole bench of bishops. It seems to have been decided that a party under William de Mandeville, earl of Essex, and the constable, Richard de Humet, should go to England, confront the archbishop with the various complaints and demands, and, in case of his defiance, arrest him. But, probably on Christmas day, Henry II in his exasperation uttered the fateful words, &#145;What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk!&#146;  (Robertson and Sheppard, 2.429). Four of his knights, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27652/', "William de Tracy")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9647/', "Reginald Fitzurse")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19379/', "Hugh de Morville")</script>, and Richard Brito (or le Bret)&#151;the first three barons of middling rank&#151;were stung to action and acted secretly within, or on the fringe of, the official mission. Bad weather in the channel, which dispersed the unit, also confused the operation. William de Mandeville did not reach Canterbury until after Becket was dead. The constable, on arrival in England, ordered the Young King's guardians to send, without informing their lord, a squadron of knights to Canterbury to arrest the archbishop. The four conspirators, however, reached by different routes their rendezvous at Saltwood Castle, held by Ranulf de Broc, at about the same time, the evening of 28 December. With Ranulf they planned to beset the cathedral complex on the following day, put direct pressure on Becket to absolve the bishops and give pledges of good behaviour, and perhaps arrest him. Local garrison troops were mobilized, and next morning the operation was mounted. Ranulf seized the gatehouse to the courtyard while the four barons, led by Reginald Fitzurse, with about a dozen knights and some other helpers, went on to corner their quarry.<br>
<br>Becket, after dining in the hall of his palace at two o'clock, had retired with some of his inner circle to his chamber when the arrival of messengers from the king overseas was announced. When the visitors were ushered in, although Becket knew at least the three seniors well, for they had been his vassals when chancellor, he did not break off his conversation with a monk or eventually rise to greet them. The apparently rambling and hostile interchanges that followed, with the stock charges and countercharges, ended when others of the archbishop's household crowded in and the barons retreated to summon reinforcements. Once the clerks realized how great the danger to Becket was, they hustled him, very much against his will, by an internal route to asylum in the church, which they entered from the south cloister. When Fitzurse rushed in, after Becket had ordered that the door should not be barred, the archbishop turned and stood by a pillar in the centre of the opening to the north transept. By this time he had been deserted by all his clerks, including John of Salisbury, and had in close attendance only his chaplain, Robert of Merton, a monk, William, who left after the first blow was struck, and a visitor, Edward Grim, who was to write one of the first lives. The monks, who had been celebrating vespers in the choir, and the others watched from a safe distance. Daylight was fading, and only the main outline of the subsequent events can be trusted.<br>
<br>Although Becket knew that he could hide from his assailants, he chose deliberately to face them. He trusted in God, the sanctity of the place, and his priestly order. Also he would not be browbeaten by social inferiors. When the four barons demanded that he release the bishops from their sentences, he refused. When Fitzurse tried to arrest him and hoist him onto William de Tracy's shoulders, he fought back fiercely. Insults also were traded. Finally, while Hugh de Morville kept the watchers at bay, Fitzurse and the others struck in turn. The first blow, partly deflected by Grim's protective arm, sliced off the top of the archbishop's head. Becket fell face downwards, with his head to the north and the altar of St Benedict to his right. Richard Brito delivered the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> and Hugh de Horsea, a subdeacon who had accompanied the soldiers, scattered his brains on the floor. Becket, as he collapsed, had commended his soul to God, the Blessed Mary, St Denis, and the patron saints of his church.<br>
<br>After the soldiers had retreated to Saltwood Castle, the terrified monks began to pay some attention to the corpse. In the morning a kinsman of Ranulf de Broc returned and ordered it to be buried immediately in some obscure place; and a marble sarcophagus, already prepared for another burial and sunk into the floor of the Trinity Chapel at the eastern end of the crypt, was chosen. The body was not washed or embalmed, as was the custom, nor was there, because of the pollution of the church, any religious service. It was probably just after Becket's fiftieth birthday, and at the time many men thought that a traitor to the king had met an end he well deserved.<h2>
<a name="Canonization"></a>Canonization</h2>Both English kings expressed their sorrow at Becket's death and protested their innocence. But they could do little against a great surge of popular horror at the murder and the demands for vengeance made by Becket's clerks to sympathizers in France and the papal court. On 25 January 1171 the archbishop of Sens, despite the objection of his fellow commissioner, the archbishop of Rouen, laid an interdict on all Henry's French fiefs. News of the death reached Alexander at Frascati in March, and on Maundy Thursday (25 March) he excommunicated generally the killers and all their supporters. Shortly afterwards he confirmed the interdict and all Becket's sentences against the English bishops, and placed a personal interdict on Henry II. But a process of reconciliation was soon in motion; and by 19 May 1172, when Henry submitted at Avranches to the papal legates Albert and Theodwin on agreed terms, almost all involved in the quarrels and murder had expressed penitence and been absolved.<br>
<br>Meanwhile a cult, associated with the belief in the curative power of Becket's blood, had started spontaneously at Canterbury, and soon spread widely. The first recorded miraculous cure was in the city on 4 January 1171, and by Whitsun the miracles were proliferating. The timorous monks, cowed by royal officials, were at first hostile, and fastidious theologians looked askance at the drinking of blood other than Christ's and despised these vulgar signs of sanctity. As St Augustine had remarked, in relation to the Donatists, it is not the penalty that makes true martyrs, but the cause. But the martyrdom had a cathartic effect and the cause was largely abandoned by adherents and opponents alike. Attention was concentrated on the cult. The cathedral was reopened to the public in Easter week 1171 and on Becket's secular birthday, 21 December, it was reconciled by papal permission by bishops Bartholomew of Exeter and Richard of Chester. The crowds of pilgrims and the cures created a great stir. John of Salisbury asked members of his circle, to whom he sent a letter describing the passion, whether it would be proper to honour the martyr as a saint before a formal canonization. And Pierre de Celle, abbot of St R&eacute;mi at Rheims, who had sheltered John during his exile, answered that it would. But both kept their heads. Celle reminded his old friend of how in the past they had often joked together about Becket and groaned at the impossibility of ever being able to find a shrine big enough to contain him. But now God had made a laughing-stock of them. For now everyone in both England and France was flocking to his shrine&#151;and he himself was intending to go. But he never did. Sceptics were simply amazed. At an assembly of the English magnates, Henry of Houghton, formerly one of Becket's clerks in exile, was approached by one of the grandees and asked a shrewd question. How was it that Becket, who, as chancellor, had been the most severe of them all against the church, now surpassed all the saints they knew in the number and magnitude of his miracles? The clerk answered that the archbishop had suffered exile and many injuries culminating in his cruel death. If St Peter and the thief on the cross could obtain God's pardon for their sins, surely Becket had more than atoned for his much less serious transgressions.<br>
<br>After Becket's enemies had been reconciled to the church in 1171&#150;2, there was, except among a few zealots, a general desire to regularize the situation. A basic measure would be the martyr's canonization. The pressure for this came from the French church and royal court, activated by Herbert of Bosham and John of Salisbury. And when the pope discovered that the chastened Henry had no strong objection and that the English hierarchy would at least acquiesce, he canonized Becket on Ash Wednesday (21 February) 1173 at Segni. On 12 July 1174 Henry II, beset by rebellions, made a pilgrimage to the tomb, humiliated himself and was scourged. In August 1179 Louis VII of France, Philippe, count of Flanders, Baudouin, count of Gu&icirc;nes, and Henri, duke of Louvain, crossed from Wissant to visit the shrine. Henry met them at Dover and conducted them to and from Canterbury. He was demonstrating that the saint was now his and that he had deprived Louis of this valuable asset.<br>
<br>Becket's shrine remained popular with pilgrims throughout the middle ages. It provided the monks of Christ Church with a considerable, and corrupting, revenue. Guardians of the shrine were soon appointed and records of the cures kept. A method of distributing the &#145;blood&#146; to pilgrims in phials cast from tin or lead was devised; and these were sold for a farthing and filled with &#145;the water of St Thomas&#146; from a jug. The recipients wore the phials suspended from the neck as a recognizable badge. The monks had quickly protected the sarcophagus with a stone box, pierced by four oval portholes through which pilgrims could peer and touch. When canonizing Becket, Alexander had, as was customary, ordered the monks to translate the body to a more honourable tomb. But because of various obstacles this was not done until 7 July 1220 by Archbishop Stephen Langton (<i>d</i>. 1228) to celebrate the martyr's jubilee.<br>
<br>Some of the immediate sources of the cult, such as admiration for a man who had withstood the mighty oppressors of the poor, anger at his treatment, and eagerness to participate in the gifts he bestowed after his death, soon dried up. What probably perpetuated the cult was the general acceptance of Thomas as the kingdom's patron saint. Louis VII and France had St Denis with his popular shrine outside Paris. England's St Edmund at Bury and St Edward the Confessor at Westminster were not in the same class, and St George had not yet caught on. The shrine at Canterbury met the needs of popular piety. Geoffrey Chaucer's <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span> illustrates the pilgrims' way in the fourteenth century. And there is no reason to think that the destruction of the shrine in September 1538 by order of Thomas Cromwell, acting as Henry VIII's vicar-general, and the proscription of the cult, were popular. Yet, with the growth of secularism, the popularity of St Thomas has waned. The play <span class="italic">Becket</span>, written by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, which in 1884 he dedicated to the subject's successor as lord chancellor, the earl of Selborne, opens dramatically with &#145;Henry and Becket at chess&#146;, but found no place on the English stage. T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">Murder in the Cathedral</span> (1935), which has had a considerable success, is a somewhat enigmatic pageant of the archbishop's last days at Canterbury, by no means entirely sympathetic to the martyr.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Although Thomas of Canterbury was revered for some four centuries in England and his tomb for a time rivalled that of St James of Compostela as a pilgrim shrine in western Christendom, in his lifetime and again after the Reformation he was a controversial figure. Most observers have considered that he was not a born saint. It would also seem that his brilliant, if chequered, career had a mostly harmful effect on all those connected with it. And in whatever way the causes for which he fought are regarded, the zeal with which he advanced them would appear excessive. But he must also be credited with important achievements. On the matter of the &#145;evil&#146; royal customs in the church, his murder forced Henry to make important concessions to the pope in 1172&#150;6. As regards the &#145;double punishment&#146; of clerical criminals, he almost single-handedly conquered both traditional practices and the hostility of the best legal opinion. His martyrdom converted the Bolognese masters, and eventually Alexander, to his views and created a wide and irrational &#145;benefit of clergy&#146; to the detriment of both church and state. Becket also reanimated the subversive element in Christianity which his predecessor and hero, Anselm, had exemplified. Stephen Langton, who displayed the martyrdom on his counterseal, Edmund Rich (<i>d</i>. 1240), and John Pecham (<i>d</i>. 1292) were archbishops of Canterbury in the thirteenth century who were not unmindful of the example of their awkward and determined predecessor. By defending the rights of the church against the lay powers they sometimes helped to protect the rights of those less protected against tyrannical rulers.<br>
<br>Becket's contemporaries provide the best spectrum of opinions on his life and work. For Gilbert Foliot, bishop of London, a pious, learned, and conservative Benedictine monk, he was an unsuitable and untrustworthy leader who brought the English church to ruin, only to flee in disguise at night, although no one went in pursuit. For his candid clerk, John of Salisbury, he was a flawed instrument of God, spoilt by his follies in the royal court when chancellor, who, although fighting for a just cause, failed because he had given too many hostages to fortune. For Herbert of Bosham he was in all things mighty&#151;great in the palace, great in hall, great in the church, great in exile, great in his return, and especially great at journey's end. Herbert, who was one of Becket's longest serving clerks and probably his closest friend, was conscious of an innate and constant grandeur.<br>
