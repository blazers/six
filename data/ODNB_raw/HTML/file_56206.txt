<span class="headword">Norris, Sir  Henry George</span>  (1865&#150;1934), <span class="occ">property developer and football promoter</span>, was born on 23 July 1865 at 23 Royal Terrace, Kennington, London, the son of John Henry Norris, warehouseman, and his wife, Georgiana Sarah Shaw. Educated privately, he was articled at the age of thirteen to a firm of solicitors.<br>
<br>Norris's great leap forward came in 1896 when he joined W. G. Allen in the firm of Allen and Norris, auctioneers and estate agents, builders, and joiners, of 298 Wandsworth Bridge Road (which was still extant in Fulham Palace Road in 1976). Under the auspices of this firm, he became a successful property developer in the London of the 1890s, building some 2000 flats and houses on what had been farmland and market gardens in Fulham. Many of the houses were divided into two flats with separate sculleries and a staircase leading from the upper flat to the back garden. They were designed for lower middle class and better-off working people. Norris also built larger houses of self-contained flats with bathrooms off the Fulham Palace Road. He later became a director of several companies including Kinnaird Park Estates and the Municipal Freehold Land Co. In 1901 he married Edith Anne <i>n&eacute;e</i> Featherstone; they had three daughters.<br>
<br>An energetic and ambitious man, Norris also played prominent roles in the worlds of politics and professional football. Having served for six years as a member of the Battersea vestry, in 1906 he was elected to the Fulham borough council for the Sands End ward. He was elected mayor in 1909, an office he retained until 1919. He was on the London county council from 1916 until 1919. The war provided an ideal opportunity to fuse energy and entrepreneurialism with patriotism. Norris had formerly held commissions in the 3rd Middlesex artillery volunteers and the 2nd Tower Hamlets volunteers. He was a member of the committee which raised the footballers' battalion of the Middlesex regiment and he personally raised three brigades of artillery from the Fulham area, where he was recruiting officer with the rank of colonel. A later wartime appointment was as director of recruiting for the south-eastern counties. In recognition of his role during the war he was knighted in 1917. The following year he was elected Conservative MP for East Fulham, but as a staunch free-trader retired in 1922 when the government adopted tariff reform. A leading freemason, he held high masonic office in the Kent and London mayors' lodges, and also in the grand lodge of England.<br>
<br>In addition Norris made a significant impact on professional football in London. He became a director in 1906, and later chairman, of his local club, Fulham, and helped it to reach the second division of the Football League in 1907&#150;8. However, when Woolwich Arsenal appeared on the brink of bankruptcy he took it over and tried to amalgamate it with Fulham, but the Football League rejected the plan. He subsequently retired from Fulham and became chairman of Arsenal. The Arsenal was the capital's oldest professional club and Norris realized that it had to move from Plumstead if it was to realize its potential, and in 1913 &pound;20,000 was spent on 6 acres of land belonging to St John's College of Divinity at Highbury in north London. There was opposition from local residents and from Clapton Orient and Tottenham Hotspurs who disliked the idea of a competitor only 4 miles away, but the Football League felt the market was far from glutted and Arsenal played the first match at Highbury on 6 September 1913.<br>
<br>English league football had been suspended in 1915 because of the war, with Arsenal in the second division, to which it had been relegated in 1912. However, in 1919 the Football League decided to expand the number of clubs in the first division from twenty to twenty-two. It was expected that the two teams who would have been relegated in 1915, Chelsea and Tottenham, would keep their places but Norris pulled off an audacious and ruthless coup, the full details of which remain unclear to this day. He persuaded the AGM of the Football League to keep Chelsea but to relegate Tottenham and further claimed that Arsenal should take its place on the dubious grounds of having been a member of the league for longer. Arsenal thus returned to the first division, not by virtue of performance on the field but as the result of apparently shady deals.<br>
<br>Norris was never again to be so influential in the corridors of Football League power, noticeably failing to persuade the league to place an upper limit on the amounts which could be paid in transfer fees when a player moved from one club to another. In 1927 he was suspended from all football and football management for making illegal payments to obtain players. Two years later he lost a libel action against the members of the FA commission which had convicted him. This was his third libel action in nine years, but the first he had lost.<br>
<br>A combative character, Norris was clearly a man used to exercising power and getting his own way. One Arsenal manager said that everyone in the club was frightened of him. Tall and thin, with pince-nez and white walrus moustache, he must have found it very frustrating to watch the success of Arsenal in the early 1930s under the management of Herbert Chapman, whom he had appointed in 1925. Norris died at his home, Sirron Lodge, Barnes Common, on 30 July 1934 and was buried in East Sheen cemetery on 2 August.<br>
