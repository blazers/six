<span class="headword">Melville,  Robert</span>, first Lord Melville  (1527/8&#150;1621), <span class="occ">administrator and judge</span>, was born in Fife, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18549/', "Sir John Melville of Raith (d. 1548)")</script>, and his second wife, Helen Napier of Merchiston (<i>d</i>. in or after 1584). Raised in the international tradition of noble service, he was not university trained but was entered into the service of Mary of Guise, queen dowager of Scotland, in his youth. His famous younger brother, the statesman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18548/', "Sir James Melville")</script> of Halhill, had an almost identical early career. Robert was afterwards at the French court in the service of Henri II, on whose death in 1559 he returned to Scotland. He was usually known as Melville of Murdocairny. Throwing in his lot with the lords of the congregation, who were then in conflict with Mary of Guise, Melville was sent by them, along with William Maitland of Lethington, to beg the assistance of Queen Elizabeth of England. He was admitted a privy councillor in 1562. Later he was employed in other diplomatic missions to England, one of which had for its object the marriage of Elizabeth to the third earl of Arran. Melville joined the opposition to Mary's marriage with Darnley in 1565, and in the autumn played a small part in the rebellion led by Moray known as the Chaseabout raid. For a time he took refuge in England, but Mary granted him an early pardon and sent him as her resident ambassador to the English court, whose projects he faithfully reported. He was instrumental in making peace between Mary and the earl of Moray, but the murder of Darnley (9 February 1567) disgusted him, and he withdrew from politics.<br>
<br>Mary, however, after marrying the fourth earl of Bothwell (15 May 1567), sent Melville back to Queen Elizabeth to make the most plausible representation of her actions. But Melville, who thoroughly disliked Bothwell, acted more in the interests of the Scottish nobles who were opposing Mary than in those of his queen. In 1567 she made him keeper of her palace of Linlithgow, and he held this office until 1587. When Melville returned to Scotland in July 1567 Mary was a captive in Lochleven Castle, but he was permitted to visit her there. Bishop Robert Keith records that he then delivered her a ring as a pledge of Elizabeth's protection&#151;a promise that Mary would later rue. Melville used all his persuasive energy to induce Mary to renounce Bothwell, and so save herself and the country. Mary was obdurate, and the nobles, resolving to force her to abdicate, selected Melville to intimate to her their intention. He declined the mission, but seeing their determination he visited Mary privately and advised her to acquiesce.<br>
<br>When Queen Mary effected her escape in 1568, Melville joined her at Hamilton, and he was present when she publicly revoked her deed of abdication. At the battle of Langside (13 May), Mary's last stand, he was taken prisoner by Regent Moray, but having been a non-combatant, and with many friends in the regent's party, he was speedily released and employed in further diplomatic negotiations with Elizabeth. While Mary was a prisoner in England, Melville, who maintained his attachment to her to the end and was trusted by her, laboured to bring about a reconciliation of all parties. His efforts failed, and when hostilities broke out between her supporters and the friends of the young James VI, Melville joined with Kirkcaldy of Grange in his attempt to re-establish the authority of the Scottish queen. He was prominent among the many Fife lairds, sometimes characterized as the &#145;loyal Melvilles&#146;, who maintained a remarkable personal loyalty to Mary despite many misfortunes  (Donaldson, 106). During the siege of Edinburgh Castle, Melville was declared a traitor and forfeited, and when the castle surrendered in April 1573 he fell into the hands of Regent Morton, who would have put him to death, as he did other prominent prisoners, had not Queen Elizabeth and Henry Killigrew, the English ambassador, interposed in his favour. After a year of captivity, spent partly in Holyrood and partly at Lethington, near Haddington, Melville was liberated. He lived in retirement during the remainder of Morton's government and was not fully restored to his estates until 1579.<br>
<br>In 1580 the influence of Esm&eacute; Stewart, soon to be duke of Lennox, became paramount at court, and Melville was recalled, his forfeiture rescinded. He was knighted on 20 October 1581, at the same time as Lord Ruthven was created earl of Gowrie. Gowrie was already treasurer of Scotland, and Melville was appointed his clerk and treasurer-depute in August 1582. Melville did not participate in the Ruthven raid that same month, but he assisted James in his escape from Gowrie. Melville was reappointed a privy councillor in 1583. When Queen Mary was lying under sentence of death, James sent Melville, along with the master of Gray, to entreat Elizabeth on 7 December 1586 to spare Mary's life. Melville discharged his mission so fearlessly that Elizabeth threatened his life and but for Gray would have deprived him of his liberty. After his return on 7 February 1587 Melville was commended, and as a reward received from James the gift of a wardship worth &pound;1000 Scots.<br>
<br>Two English lists of 1585 assessing the religious inclinations of Scottish nobles support the conclusion that Melville was a protestant. However, they also indicate that he was inclined toward a political alliance with France, and thus was not wholly friendly to English purposes. Melville was certainly supportive of a church subservient to the polity of the state and appears to have urged presbyterian conciliation in such affairs. James Melville records in his autobiography that Sir Robert came to St Andrews in 1583 to persuade the doctrinaire presbyterian minister Andrew Melville to make peace with the king. In July 1584 Sir Robert lobbied Patrick Galloway on behalf of the government to abandon certain policies being proposed at the general assembly. Yet he apparently enjoyed the confidence of some sections of the kirk, for in February 1588 the assembly adopted a resolution to draw up of a list of known Jesuits, which was to be delivered to him on the premise that he would issue summonses against the named individuals.<br>
<br>On the departure of King James for Scandinavia in October 1589 to bring home his bride, Princess Anne of Denmark, Melville was deputed to act as chancellor. He was afterwards sent to pacify disorderly districts in the north and on the borders. From the 1590s until his retirement, Melville was one of few men not trained in law who was regularly appointed one of the lords of the articles, important officials selected before each parliament to prepare its legislation. He purchased the lands and castle of Monimail, Fife, an old residence of Cardinal David Beaton, from Sir James Balfour in 1592. In 1593 he again went to England to negotiate with Elizabeth about the relations of the two kingdoms with Spain. On 11 June 1594 he was admitted a judge-extraordinary of the court of session, the highest civil court in Scotland, by the title of Lord Murdocairny, the name of his seat in Fife. The same year he accompanied King James to the north, opposing the sixth earl of Huntly, and remained there for some time with the second duke of Lennox to restore order. Melville remained treasurer-depute until 1596. After Gowrie's downfall his successors as treasurer (the third earl of Montrose, from 1584 to 1585; Thomas Lyon, master of Glamis, from 1585 to 1596) usually had only a nominal connection with their office. It was Melville who handled the money, submitted the accounts, and took responsibility for the growing deficit caused by the establishment of a royal court on inadequate revenues. On the appointment in 1596 of the Octavians, eight commissioners who undertook to manage the national finances, he ceased to be treasurer-depute, but before a year was past the Octavians petitioned for assistance, and Melville was among those directed to help them. When he quitted the office of treasurer-depute Melville was so much out of pocket (he was superexpended by &pound;35,656 Scots) that he could not meet his own creditors and had to be protected from them by a special act of parliament, while the court of session was forbidden to entertain any action at law against him. In 1605 he and his son were granted discharge for their lifetimes of feu-duties due to the crown for the lands of Murdocairny for his service &#145;albeit as yet dewlie recompansit&#146;  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, <i>1593&#150;1625</i>, 4.264, 455). The king did not repay him until well after 1610, and possibly not even then.<br>
<br>By 1600 old age was telling upon Melville, and in December that year he resigned both his offices of privy councillor and judge in favour of his son; from time to time he still attended the council meetings, notwithstanding a special dispensation from the king in February 1604, because of his age and infirmity. He accompanied James to London in 1603, and when steps were being taken in 1605 for uniting the kingdoms, the Scottish parliament appointed him one of their commissioners. A draft treaty of union was prepared, which Melville signed, but it was not then carried into effect.<br>
<br>Melville's long services were recognized on 1 April 1616 by his creation as a lord of parliament, with the title of Lord Melville of Monimail. He was thrice married, first to Katherine, daughter of William Adamson of Craigcrook, a burgess of Edinburgh; second, before 1593, to Lady Mary Leslie (<i>d</i>. 1605), daughter of Andrew, fifth earl of Rothes; and third to Lady Jean Stewart (<i>d</i>. after 1642), daughter of Robert, earl of Orkney (a natural son of King James V), and widow of Patrick Leslie, first Lord Lindores. Melville died in December 1621, aged ninety-four. His son Robert, who succeeded him as second Lord Melville, was the son of his father's first marriage. Melville also had a natural daughter, Christian, married to Thomas Oliphant, portioner of Hilcairny.<br>
