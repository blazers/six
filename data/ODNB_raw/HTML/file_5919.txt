<span class="headword">Collier,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Tim Bobbin]</span>  (1708&#150;1786), <span class="occ">satirist and caricaturist</span>, was born at Church Lane, Urmston, Lancashire, on 16 December 1708. He was the third of nine children of John Collier, Church of England clergyman (<i>c</i>.1676&#150;1739) and his wife, Mary Cook (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1726). John initially attended Urmston School, but plans for his education were abandoned when his father's sight failed. In 1722 he was apprenticed to a dutch-loom weaver at Newton Moor, near Mottram, where his father had family links. &#145;Hating slavery in all shapes&#146;, as he later put it  (Corry, iii), he left after a year and spent the next few years as an itinerant schoolmaster in the region of Manchester. In 1729 he became assistant schoolmaster to Robert Pearson, the decrepit curate of Milnrow, near Rochdale, formally taking over the post of schoolmaster in 1742 after Pearson's death. Richard Townley of Belfield, a local mercer and landowner, became his patron. Collier supplemented his meagre income by private teaching and by acting as hedge lawyer, composing letters, wills, indentures, and other documents. He acquired notoriety through squibs, satires, poetry, and practical jokes, on one occasion blasting the &#145;Prickshaw witch&#146; (a local conjuror) with fire and water.<br>
<br>On 1 April 1744 Collier married Mary Clay (<i>c</i>.1726&#150;1786), a young Huddersfield midwife with a family connection in Milnrow, brought up in London. Notwithstanding the early exhaustion of her fortune the marriage seems to have been a success and produced nine children, seven of whom survived into adulthood.<br>
<br>In 1746 there appeared under the name Tim Bobbin, Collier's first and most famous work, <span class="italic">A View of the Lancashire Dialect, or, Tummus and Mary</span>, the earliest significant piece of Lancashire dialect to be published. Subsequently expanded to include a glossary, illustrations, and other material, it went through seven editions in his own lifetime and was prolifically pirated both before and after his death. Running short of money Collier in 1750 reluctantly accepted an offer from an admirer, Richard Hill, of the well-paid post of clerk at his woollen clothworks at Kebroyd, near Halifax. Finding himself &#145;metamorphosed from a petty monarch, to a species of slave&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 214) he soon rebelled against the discipline of work and jubilantly returned to Milnrow at Christmas 1751 to take up his old post of schoolmaster, later declaring: &#145;Liberty in rags, is preferable to dependance in gorgeous trappings&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 247).<br>
<br>Collier now developed his trade as a painter, increasingly with the help of his sons, producing inn signs, painted panels, and grotesque caricatures which were widely distributed, reaching the American colonies via a Liverpool merchant. He promoted and distributed his own work, travelling all over northern England collecting and delivering orders and commissions for books and pictures and consuming the proceeds as he went. Publicans were among his best customers, and he theirs. In 1773 was published his <span class="italic">Human Passions Delineated</span>, an upmarket edition of his caricatures which acted as a catalogue, in which he described himself as the &#145;Lancashire Hogarth&#146;. His writings occasionally brought him into conflict with authority. His 1757 intervention in Manchester's food riots, <span class="italic">Truth in a Mask</span>, and his 1760 &#145;Remarks on the reign of George II&#146; both had to be printed clandestinely, bearing the imprint &#145;Amsterdam&#146;. During the American War of Independence he openly sided with the colonists and was reportedly indicted for producing a picture libellous on the king. His politics, however, were those of the court jester: when he signed himself &#145;reforming John&#146;, it was as a drunkard rather than as a radical  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 244). His targets were the standard butts of eighteenth-century satire: old wives, &#145;Oliverian dotards&#146;, Methodists, Scots, tax-eaters, fops, courtiers, lawyers, and swindling printers. He reserved his fiercest hostility for wealthy clergy and pluralists, thick on the ground thereabouts, best expressed in the epitaph:<blockquote>
<div>Full three feet deep beneath this stone<br>
</div>
<div>Lies our late vicar Forster<br>
</div>
<div>Who clipp'd his sheep to the very bone<br>
</div>
<div>But said no Pater Noster.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In his declining years Collier was conveyed around Milnrow in an armchair equipped with wheels, while his wife's was adapted as a sedan chair. He died there, unreformed and contented, on 14 July 1786, having lived heartily up to his own motto, &#145;Laugh and be fat&#146;. His wife had died the previous month, and they were buried close together in Rochdale churchyard. His three eldest sons were apprenticed to coachmakers and subsequently had notable careers, Charles as portrait painter, Thomas as persecuted radical, and John successively as artist, historian of Newcastle upon Tyne, and lunatic, his insanity recognizable as a bizarre caricature of his father.<br>
<br>Commentators in all ages have had trouble in allocating a cultural level to Tim Bobbin. Two local radicals, Robert Walker (writing as Tim Bobbin the Second in 1796) and James Butterworth (as Paul Bobbin in 1819), later attempted to appropriate his reputation to the radical cause. Walter Scott visited his grave in 1818, and he was revered by later generations of dialect writers. Metropolitan contemporaries were prone to view him with condescension as a na&iuml;ve rustic, a product of the culture he portrayed. The 1810 London edition of <span class="italic">Human Passions</span> systematically softened his caricatures, while an 1828 edition of the <span class="italic">Lancashire Dialect</span> was supplied with more conventionally crafted pictures by George Cruikshank. The Victorian antiquary W. E. Axon thought his pictures &#145;execrable &hellip; gross and cruel&#146;, while the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> found them &#145;grotesque&#146; and &#145;absolutely devoid of artistic merit&#146;. Collier himself referred to &#145;my old trade of boggart-painting&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 242). He drew, however, not only on traditions of inn sign and carriage painting but on the work of Hogarth and on Flemish low-life art, and encountered Flemish and London artists in Lancashire.<br>
<br>Similarly, while Corry regarded Collier's poetry as &#145;incorrect, coarse and vulgar&#146;  (Corry, xxvi), he was in fact well educated, familiar with Chaucer, the classics, and contemporary literature of all kinds, and pursued antiquarian interests. In 1771, &#145;having a natural antipathy to tyranny in writing, as well as politics&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 105), he launched a learned and devastating satirical assault on the Revd John Whitaker's overblown <span class="italic">History of Manchester</span>, claiming (for example) that a find identified by Whitaker as a Saxon lachrymatory was in fact a witch bottle, filled with piss, and comparing the whole to &#145;the towering smoke of Ossian&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 108). His <span class="italic">Lancashire Dialect</span> similarly was serious but not solemn, based on careful collection and glossing of the language he heard, and influential in defining the comic figure of the impoverished Lancastrian, downtrodden, ridiculous, and obtusely irrepressible. Samuel Bamford, author of a fine poem, &#145;Tim Bobbin's Grave&#146;, spoke the dialect but thought Collier's orthoepy betrayed his Mersey region origins and issued his own edition in 1850. Later scholars of dialect agreed that Collier's version of south-east Lancashire dialect was the closest surviving English relative of Anglo-Saxon. The unorthodox vigour of Collier's etchings, the informal directness of his prose, and the eloquent vulgarity of his verse appeal directly from the eighteenth century to the present.<br>
