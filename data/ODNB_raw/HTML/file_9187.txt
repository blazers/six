<span class="headword">Farrar,  John</span>  (1802&#150;1884), <span class="occ">Wesleyan Methodist minister and biblical scholar</span>, was the third and youngest son of John Farrar, Wesleyan minister, who died in 1837. He was born at Alnwick, Northumberland, on 29 July 1802. On the opening of Woodhouse Grove School, Yorkshire, for the education of the sons of ministers on 12 January 1812 he became one of the first pupils. On leaving school he was employed as a teacher in Mr Green's academy at Cottingham, near Hull. In August 1822 he entered the Wesleyan ministry, and spent his four years of probation as second master in Woodhouse Grove School. He married Sophie, youngest daughter of the Revd Miles Martindale, governor of the school, about 1823. He afterwards was resident minister successively at Sheffield, Huddersfield, Macclesfield, and London. In 1839 he was appointed tutor and governor of Abney House, Stoke Newington, a preparatory college for the training of ministers. In 1843 he became classical tutor at the newly built Wesleyan Theological Institution at Richmond, Surrey, where he spent fourteen years. He returned to Woodhouse Grove School in 1858 as governor and chaplain, becoming known there for his firm discipline. On the foundation of Headingley College, Leeds, in 1868, another college for the training of Methodist ministers, he became the first governor; failing health compelled his retirement in 1876. During his residence there the jubilee of his ministry occurred, when he was presented with an organ for the college.<br>
<br>Farrar served Wesleyan Methodism as an administrator, teacher, and writer. He was secretary of conference on fourteen occasions, and was elected its president for a second time in 1870. He was financial secretary and, for nearly twenty years, chairman of the Leeds district (1858&#150;76). He wrote two useful dictionaries which fostered a taste for biblical literature and the church history published in 1851 and 1853 respectively, as well as handbooks on the places and proper names of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. His thorough knowledge of Methodism, together with his judicious and dignified manner, earned him wide respect. Farrar died at 19 Bainbrigg Road, Headingley, Leeds, on 19 November 1884, and was buried in Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington, near his former home in Finsbury Park, on 25 November.<br>
