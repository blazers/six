<span class="headword">Boisil</span> <span class="st"> [St Boisil]</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>661), <span class="occ">prior of Melrose</span>, is reliably recorded only in the pages of Bede. He was celebrated among his contemporaries as a learned and holy priest and spiritual guide, and in 651 his reputation attracted Cuthbert to his community, in which Boisil held office under Abbot Eata, and he became the future saint's spiritual director. As well as teaching his pupil the scriptures, he inculcated in him by personal example the duty of going out to visit and preach to the inhabitants of neighbouring villages. When <i>c</i>.659 Eata and Cuthbert were summoned south by Aldfrith, son of King Oswiu of Northumbria, to establish a monastery at Ripon, Boisil remained at Melrose. He died of plague about 661. Cuthbert, who had by then returned from Ripon, attended him during the last week of his life, and according to Bede received prophecies about his future career and elevation to the episcopate. In later life Cuthbert spoke with great affection of Boisil, and reputedly, although reluctant, accepted episcopal office as the fulfilment of his dying master's words.<br>
<br>Boisil is known to have inspired a similar affection in, and to have exercised similar posthumous influence over, at least one other pupil, a companion in Ireland of the Northumbrian <i>peregrinus</i> and bishop, Ecgberht. When Ecgberht was planning a missionary visit to Germany <i>c</i>.716, Boisil appeared to this man in two visions to forbid the proposed expedition and command Ecgberht to go to Iona instead. His injunctions were obeyed and eventually resulted in the conversion of Iona to the generally observed method of calculating Easter.<br>
<br>Bede reports that Cuthbert spoke of Boisil as a saint. An eighth-century stone reliquary-coffin, fragments of which survive at Jedburgh and which perhaps originated at Melrose, may be his shrine, but the identification is far from certain. His remains were allegedly translated to Durham by Alfred Westou <i>c</i>.1120, together with those of other saints associated with Cuthbert, and placed next to Cuthbert's shrine. Boisil's cult is commemorated by the place name St Boswells, Roxburghshire, and in the dedication of the church at Tweedmouth. His cult spread in Scotland and England in the middle ages, and he is commemorated in calendars on 23 February, 7 July, and 9 September.<br>
