<span class="headword">Stein, Sir  Edward Adolphe Sinauer  de</span>  (1887&#150;1965), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born at 9 Palace Gate, London, on 16 June 1887, the eldest of three children of Clara Annie (<i>d</i>. 1927), daughter of Baron de Stein of Antwerp, and her husband, Sigmund Sinauer (<i>d</i>. 1911), merchant, who outside business adopted his wife's surname and was known as Sinauer de Stein. The elder of de Stein's sisters married Herward Ramsbotham, later first Viscount Soulbury, politician and governor-general of Ceylon. The younger sister, like de Stein, never married, and she kept house for him all their adult lives.<br>
<br>De Stein was educated at Eton College from 1901 where, though small in stature, he distinguished himself at sports. In 1905 he went to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was immensely popular and was noted for his wit and skill as a raconteur. He gained a second-class degree in history in 1910 and then read for the bar; he was called by the Inner Temple in 1912. He served throughout the First World War in the King's Royal Rifle Corps, emerging unscathed with the rank of major.<br>
<br>De Stein's early business career was influenced by that of his father, who had arrived in London about 1881 as a partner of H. Nathan &amp; Co. and who from 1902 chaired its successor, S. Hoffnung &amp; Co., Australian and American merchants. Sinauer de Stein was also chairman of New Darvel Bay (Borneo) Tobacco Plantations Ltd, and, following his sudden death in Milan in 1911, Edward succeeded him as chairman. He inherited a modest fortune from his father's net estate of &pound;45,000, and in 1927 he received a further sum from his mother's estate of &pound;27,000.<br>
<br>After the war de Stein worked briefly for Carters, general merchants in the City, where his brother-in-law was a partner, before joining Michael Herbert, quite possibly in the newly formed Constructive Finance and Investment Co., until Herbert's admission as a partner of Morgan Grenfell in 1924. De Stein then formed his own firm, Edward De Stein &amp; Co., in partnership with John Mulholland, son of the second Lord Dunleath and member of an influential Northern Ireland family. In 1936 David Bowes-Lyon, brother of Elizabeth, duchess of York, joined them. De Stein therefore instituted a partnership with considerable prestige and establishment influence; and all three men obtained directorships of major British companies.<br>
<br>De Stein's firm left no record of its activities, but knowledge of the financial markets and of the financing needs of business facilitated its development in two related directions. One was investment management in return for a regular fee income while the other, in return for windfall profit, was the specialist provision of corporate finance advice to companies intent on expansion by acquisition or through raising additional capital.<br>
<br>Edward De Stein &amp; Co. was one of several small houses formed at this time to meet an expanding demand for specialist advice, especially from small and medium-sized businesses, an activity avoided by established merchant banks until the 1930s. However, the care with which de Stein developed his business resulted in an undoubted City reputation. His shrewdness and transparent honesty enabled him to pick and choose with exacting care his clients, his associates, his partners, and the directors of the boards he chaired.<br>
<br>In investment management the list of de Stein's private and institutional clients was doubtless long, but the public manifestation of this work was through his management of investment trusts, not a new but certainly an expanding vehicle of popular investment. By 1930 he had established and managed Anglo Celtic Trust Ltd and British Combined Investors Trust Ltd, and he sat on the boards of others such as Industrial Selection Trust Ltd, Mid European Corporation Ltd, and Romney Trust Ltd, which were domiciled at his City offices.<br>
<br>De Stein's major financial operations appear to have been comparatively few, and he and his partners sat on the boards of several client companies. He himself was a director of the Columbia Graphophone Company from about 1920 and was involved with its merger in 1931 with the Gramophone Company (popularly known as His Master's Voice) to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (later EMI Ltd), on whose board he served until the late 1950s. He was chairman of the important tobacco manufacturers Gallaher Ltd of Belfast, following his organization of a syndicate to acquire the business from its founding family in 1928 and its subsequent offer for sale as a public company; he remained its chairman until the late 1950s. He was also chairman of the finance house Mercantile Credit from the early 1930s to the 1950s, at a time of its expansion into hire purchase; from 1951 he was president of the Finance Houses Association. These companies, and other clients such as Dunlops, were in dynamic sectors of the economy; de Stein appears to have stood clear of mature companies with different financing requirements.<br>
<br>In 1951 de Stein merged his business with the corporate finance arm of a smaller competitor, Dawnay Day, but in 1960, when he was seventy-three, his own firm merged into, and was effectively swallowed up by, Lazard Brothers, an acknowledgement that the growing complexity of corporate finance transactions had for the time being numbered the days of the smaller houses. De Stein felt distinctly out of place in this new era, ushered in during 1958 and 1959 by the &#145;aluminium war&#146;: he joined a syndicate of City houses to prevent, &#145;in the national interest&#146;, British Aluminium Ltd from falling into unsuitable foreign ownership, but its efforts were humiliatingly crushed by the aggressive take-over practices imported from Wall Street by S. G. Warburg &amp; Co.<br>
<br>De Stein was a vociferous opponent of nationalization and highlighted in letter columns of the press its critical shortcoming:<blockquote>in cases where, under state ownership, there is no competition whatsoever, on what basis are the prices of services and goods to be determined so that &hellip; the public may be able to judge whether there has been efficiency and economy in operation? (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 Jan 1948)</blockquote>Notwithstanding this opposition to a &#145;controlled&#146; economy, from 1949 to 1954 he was a director of the National Research Development Corporation, though his directorship of the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation was short-lived; this body, sponsored by the Bank of England, was formed in 1945 to provide equity finance for small business, but de Stein resigned in 1946 with a somewhat terse public statement referring to &#145;pressure of business&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 9 Nov 1946, 9).<br>
<br>De Stein was mercurial and impatient and he distrusted the judgement of theoreticians. His success lay in his ability to size up, mostly intuitively, the prospects of a company or industry and to find the right men to carry through his ideas. But he was bad at figures and here he relied on the help of others. During the Second World War, de Stein was director of finance, raw materials, for the Ministry of Supply (1941&#150;6), for which he was knighted in 1946. From 1949 until 1963 he was chairman of the finance committee of the British Red Cross. His philanthropic work included the support of Toc H and of boys' clubs in London's poorest districts; he established his own club at Shepherd's Bush, where he joined in sports and entertained on the piano. He established the Easton Trust to found hostels for boys from schools for the maladjusted.<br>
<br>De Stein's wit and quick mind showed themselves in the writing of verse and essays. In 1919 he published a collection of parodies entitled <span class="italic">Poets in Picardy</span> and he contributed to <span class="italic">Punch</span>. He was an accomplished pianist and in later life he took up watercolour painting, exhibiting at the Royal Society of Painters in Water-Colour. He was a keen sportsman, a fine fisherman, an excellent shot, an amateur landscape gardener, and a discriminating collector of ceramics and pictures; he was also skilled at tapestry work. His London home was filled with things of beauty. In 1944 he presented Lindisfarne Castle on Holy Island, along with its furniture, to the National Trust on the basis of its lease to his younger sister. De Stein died at his country home, Fulling Mills, Easton, Hampshire, on 3 November 1965, and was buried in Easton churchyard.<br>
