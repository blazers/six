<span class="headword">Pearce, Sir  Edward Lovett</span>  (1699?&#150;1733), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born probably in 1699 or a little earlier, the son of Major-General Edward Pearce, first cousin to Sir John Vanbrugh. His mother was Frances, daughter of Christopher Lovett, lord mayor of Dublin in 1676&#150;7, and his wife, Frances O'Moore, a descendant of Rory O'Moore of Laois. Almost nothing is known of his childhood, though a commission was purchased on his behalf in 1707. He is next heard of as a cornet in 1714 in the regiment of his father, and later, at the age of about sixteen or seventeen, in Morris's dragoons, a regiment with predominantly Irish connections which was disbanded in 1717. Both his father and his uncle General Thomas Pearce (later his father-in-law) were much involved in Irish affairs, and though the family had property at Witlingham, near Norwich, and perhaps elsewhere in England, Pearce probably spent some time in Ireland. Edward Pearce died in 1715, the year after his son's cornetcy. Direct evidence of his contact with his kinsman John Vanbrugh is still to seek. But the indirect evidence in the collection of architectural drawings formerly at Elton Hall, Huntingdonshire, is overwhelmingly strong, as are the Vanbrughian affinities in much of Pearce's own architectural work, in particular the use of corridors formed of chains of small domed compartments, chimney-stacks pierced by arches above the roof-line, and cylindrical corner-turrets.<br>
<br>In 1722&#150;3 Pearce made the grand tour, perhaps as a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the abortive New Junta for Architecture, a short-lived group associated with the third earl of Shaftesbury and comprising Robert, first Viscount Molesworth, and his son John, Sir George Markham, and the architects Thomas Hewitt and Alessandro Galilei. Like others, Pearce visited N&icirc;mes, Florence, Bologna, Turin, Venice, and perhaps Rome. He made copious notes, on the spot, in his copy of Palladio's <span class="italic">Quattro libri</span> of 1601 (now in the library of the Royal Institute of British Architects), was in contact with Alessandro Galilei (also a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the junta), and did commissions for William Conolly, the speaker of the Irish House of Commons. He returned to England, or perhaps Ireland in 1724. Two years later, on 26 March 1726, Vanbrugh died. Pearce himself is reported in 1726 as being &#145;at Death's door&#146; with an &#145;Inveterate Cholick&#146; but, by 1728, as having &#145;become a very healthy person&#146; thanks to a &#145;milk and vegetable diet&#146;  (Perceval MSS, BL, Add. MS 47030). Although he is referred to as &#145;Captain Pearce&#146;, it seems likely that his military character was totally occluded by ill health and by the practice of architecture.<br>
<br>Pearce married, probably some time in the mid-1720s, his cousin Anne Pearce (<i>d</i>. 1749), with whom he had four daughters. For the next eight years until his premature death, he had so many architectural works in hand, mostly in Ireland but a few in England, that many&#151;if not most&#151;of them must have been proceeding simultaneously. Few of them are securely dated, although the south front of Drumcondra House, Dublin, for Marmaduke Coghill, his earliest recorded work on a private house, belongs to 1727. Certainly attributable to Pearce are: Bellamont Forest, co. Cavan, for Charles Coote, a compact Palladian villa with four formal elevations; Cashel Palace, co. Tipperary, for Archbishop Theophilus Bolton, with a brick entrance front and a plainer garden front in ashlar stone; 9 Henrietta Street, Dublin, for Thomas Carter, the master of the rolls, a close transcript of Mountrath House, Great Burlington Street, London; 10 Henrietta Street, for Luke Gardiner; and Christchurch deanery, Dublin (dem.), an ingenious block of three separate dwellings expressed as one. So is Summerhill, co. Meath (burnt 1921; dem. <i>c</i>.1957), a vast house with a giant order, towered wings joined to the centre with two-storey links, and arcaded chimney-stacks in the Vanbrugh manner. Other highly probable attributions include: Woodlands, Santry, co. Dublin, a centrally planned square villa with central tower-lantern; Gloster, Shinrone, King's county; Cuba Court, Banagher, King's county (dem.); and the garden house at Kilmainham, co. Dublin. In a number of cases, the owners of the buildings were related to the architect. Some English concerns must be mentioned, notably a large scheme for a palace at Richmond for King George I, a long gallery at Ashley, Surrey, for Lord Shannon (now dispersed), and probably the saloon at 12 North Audley Street, London, for Colonel Ligonier.<br>
<br>Work had already begun on the great house of Castletown, co. Kildare, built for the speaker of the Irish House of Commons, William Conolly, when Pearce set out for Italy. There is reason to suppose that the elevations of the main house had been supplied by Galilei, and still better reason to credit the entrance-hall and the long gallery in its original form to Pearce, as well as the colonnades and wings. A drawing exists for the entrance-hall, while the colonnades show strong affinities with the parliament house and the style of the wings is subtly contrasted with that of the pre-existing fa&ccedil;ade of the main block. Purchased by Desmond Guinness in 1967, it became the headquarters of the Irish Georgian Society. This prior connection between Pearce and the speaker must surely account for the young architect's being chosen to design the new parliament house, over the head of Thomas Burgh, the sitting surveyor-general. Later, when Burgh died in December 1730, Pearce was appointed to succeed him in 1731; he was knighted in March 1732 and received the freedom of Dublin in April 1733. Pearce's design for the house was accepted in 1728 and the first stone was laid on 3 February 1729. Parliament sat in it in October 1731, and building was completed under Pearce's successor, Arthur Dobbs, before 1735. Before the building was finished, but when it was already in occupation, parliament paid public testimony on 13 December 1731 to the skill, diligence, and probity of the architect. Besides being the first building expressly designed for the housing of a bicameral legislature, it was a very original conception, embodying the most up-to-date architectural thought of the time. Though added to by James Gandon and others, it is externally intact and retains some notable interiors, especially Pearce's House of Lords chamber, and the domed corridors which surrounded the House of Commons.<br>
<br>Pearce was MP for Ratoath from 1727, and successfully promoted an act in 1729 to regulate the building industry and the size of bricks. A scheme to employ infantry to make a canal from Newry to Lough Neagh was instituted by him. A theatre which he designed was built in Aungier Street, Dublin, but was demolished soon afterwards. Pearce died on 16 November 1733, at his home at The Grove, a house on the estate of Lord and Lady Allen of Stillorgan, for whom he had prepared a grand scheme for the Palladianization of their house, and for the garden. The work on the house was not carried out, but that on the garden was, and the substantial grotto and other works survive, along with the large obelisk intended as a mausoleum for Lady Allen. He was buried in old Donnybrook graveyard, Dublin, on 10 December 1733.<br>
<br>Pearce was by far the most considerable architect to work in Ireland before the arrival of James Gandon: the parliament house alone would entitle him to this primacy. Richard Castle (or Cassels), whom he employed as his assistant and had perhaps also brought to Ireland, took over his practice after his death, especially with respect to country houses. The printing house in Trinity College, built by him in the year after Pearce's death, may well be Pearce's design. Through him a developed Palladian manner, with Vanbrughian overtones, was diffused throughout Ireland. His role in Ireland is closely analogous to that of the earl of Burlington in England, though there is little evidence of any direct connection.<br>
