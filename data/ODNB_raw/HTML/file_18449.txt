<span class="headword">Maynwaring,  Everard</span>  (<em>b. </em>1627/8), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born at Gravesend, Kent, was the son of Kenelm Maynwaring, rector of Gravesend, and was educated at Gravesend grammar school, his tutor being a Mr Chandler. On 21 June 1645 he was admitted a sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, at the age of seventeen, and graduated MB on 1 July 1652. In 1652 Maynwaring practised at Norton, near Sheffield, Yorkshire, and from 1653 until the end of the decade was practising in Chester, Cheshire. In the mid-1650s Maynwaring travelled to America, where he developed a lasting friendship with Christopher Lawrence MD of Dublin. On 17 August 1655 Maynwaring was created MD of the University of Dublin, &#145;after performing such exercises as the Statutes of the University required&#146;, as his diploma reads. By 1663 Maynwaring had moved to London, where he established himself next to the Blue Boar, on Ludgate Hill as a &#145;doctor in physic and hermetick phylosophy&#146;. An advocate of chemical medicine, Maynwaring dedicated his first works to two prominent patrons of Helmontian medicine: <span class="italic">Tutela sanitatis</span> (1663) to Prince Rupert, and <span class="italic">Solamen aegrorum, sive, Ternarius medicamentorum chymicorum</span> (1665) to George Villiers, duke of Buckingham.<br>
<br>In 1665 Maynwaring was entrusted with the care of the pest-house of the society for employing the poor in Middlesex. His treatment of patients seems to have been successful, as he claimed that out of the eighty patients in his care, fifty-six recovered. In the same year Maynwaring was among the proponents of the Society of Chymical Physicians, which was meant to challenge the authority of the College of Physicians. Maynwaring adopted Jean Baptiste van Helmont's medical theories, favourably quoted from the works of Helmontians such as George Thomson, and became acquainted with George Starkey. He accepted van Helmont's view that the <i>archeus</i> or vital spirit was responsible for the main functions in the human body, and endorsed the Helmontians' criticism of the doctrine of the chemical principles. He singled out Thomas Willis's version of this theory as his target. An anonymous pamphlet (possibly written in 1668&#150;9) attacked Maynwaring together with Robert Boyle and Christopher Merrett as enemies of learned medicine and of the College of Physicians. None the less Maynwaring never participated in the Helmontians' violent attacks on traditional medicine, and often censured unlearned chemists as well as empirics. In addition, unlike most of the Helmontians, he did not entirely rule out the use of phlebotomy. Like other advocates of chemical medicine Maynwaring defended the respectability of chemistry by arguing that it was part of the ancient learning which originated in Egypt with Hermes Trismegistus.<br>
<br>Maynwaring also engaged in a series of polemics against apothecaries, claiming that physicians should prepare their own medicines, and not have them made up by apothecaries. In the dispute between members of the College of Physicians and the Society of Apothecaries Maynwaring in his <span class="italic">Praxis medicorum</span> (1671) explicitly supported Christopher Merrett's attacks on apothecaries. Throughout his career, Maynwaring took an interest in the cure of scurvy, which he regarded as a disease endemic in northern countries. He made and sold his own remedies against scurvy and recommended oranges and lemons as antidotes against this disease. He condemned tobacco smoking as one of the causes of scurvy. In his late works Maynwaring advertised his pills and a &#145;catholic&#146; (that is, universal) medicine. As an answer to those who regarded him as an empiric, Maynwaring published a copy of his academic diplomas in his last work, <span class="italic">Ignota febris</span> (1698). There is no evidence that Maynwaring was married, and the date of his death is unknown.<br>
