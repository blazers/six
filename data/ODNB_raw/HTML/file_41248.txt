<span class="headword">Hancock,  William Neilson</span>  (1820&#150;1888), <span class="occ">lawyer and economist</span>, was born on 22 April 1820, at Lisburn, co. Antrim, the second son of William John Hancock, land agent and later a poor-law commissioner, and his wife, Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19872/', "Samuel Neilson")</script> of Belfast, who took part in the 1798 rebellion. He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution from 1830 to 1834 and at the Royal School, Dungannon, co. Tyrone, from 1834 to 1838. From there he entered the University of Dublin, Trinity College; he graduated BA in 1843 with a senior moderatorship and gold medal in mathematics. Called to the Irish bar in 1844, Hancock took the degrees of LLB in 1846 and LLD in 1849. In 1846 he entered for the quinquennial examination by which the Whately chair of political economy in the University of Dublin was then filled, and was the successful candidate. In some of his published lectures Hancock showed considerable potential as an economic theorist; but since the magnitude of the calamity which the potato blight had brought upon Ireland was becoming evident, Archbishop Whately suggested to him that he give first priority to considering the relevance of economic doctrine to the case of Ireland, and from that time onwards all Hancock's economic work was applied and policy-oriented.<br>
<br>In 1847 Hancock was the prime mover in founding the Dublin Statistical Society (later renamed the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland) and he went on to play a major role in the society's development. When the new Queen's College at Belfast opened in 1849, Hancock became its first professor of jurisprudence and political economy, and for the next two years he discharged the duties of both the Dublin and Belfast chairs. In 1851 he took up residence in Belfast, but in the same year he was appointed secretary to the royal commission inquiring into the affairs of Dublin University. He resigned from the Queen's College post in 1853 and thereafter used his economic and legal expertise in a series of public appointments while continuing his legal practice in Dublin.<br>
<br>Hancock once described himself as a &#145;liberal unionist&#146; and when Liberal governments were in power he was frequently asked for advice or reports on economic and social questions, as well as being appointed to a number of mainly legal offices. He acted as secretary to four other royal commissions between 1854 and 1867 and was clerk of the custody of papers in matters of idiots and lunatics in the court of chancery from 1855 until 1858, and again from 1859 to 1866. From 1863 until 1873 he was responsible for judicial, criminal, and local taxation statistics for Ireland and gained a high reputation for accuracy and fairness in collecting and compiling them. He became a QC in 1880, but gave up his practice at the bar in 1881 on being appointed keeper of the records of the Irish land commission; his last public appointment brought him back to the Irish court of chancery, as clerk of the crown and hanaper, from which office he resigned in 1885 because of ill health. In 1858 Hancock married Mary Anne (Nannie), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12612/', "James Haughton")</script> of Dublin. He died, as the result of a heart attack, at Craigpeatton Cove, the Dunbartonshire home of his brother-in-law James Thomson on 10 July 1888. Survived by his wife, he was buried a week later at Mount Jerome cemetery, Harold's Cross, Dublin.<br>
<br>Hancock was an energetic, compassionate, and fair-minded man, eager for economic and political reform, who strove to reconcile the principles of political economy as he knew them with the needs and problems of the Ireland of his time. His initial conviction was that &#145;the true business of government&#146; was to establish a framework of just laws within which private enterprise could, and would, ensure progress to prosperity. In later life, however, he came to recognize that more positive action by government was necessary and inevitable, particularly on the question of land tenure in Ireland; the advice on which Gladstone acted in framing his <span class="roman">Irish Land Bill</span> in 1869&#150;70, the first measure to recognize the tenants' right to compensation for improvements and damages for eviction, came largely from Hancock.<br>
