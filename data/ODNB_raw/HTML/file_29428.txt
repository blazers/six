</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  John</span>  (1728&#150;1808), <span class="occ">ironmaster and industrialist</span>, was born in Clifton, Cumberland, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47483/', "Isaac Wilkinson (bap. 1695, d. 1784)")</script>, ironmaster, and his wife, Mary Johnson (<i>d</i>. 1786); <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47484/', "William Wilkinson")</script> was his brother. In the 1720s Isaac Wilkinson was iron-founder at Clifton furnace; in the 1730s he moved to Backbarrow furnace and later to Lowwood in Furness, north Lancashire. John was sent to the dissenting academy at Kendal, run by Dr Caleb Rotherham. On leaving the academy at the age of seventeen, he was apprenticed to a Liverpool merchant for five years and then returned to enter into partnership with his father. When his father moved to Bersham furnace in north Wales in 1753 John remained behind in the north, living at Kirkby Lonsdale in Westmorland, perhaps to wind up their local business. There, on 12 June 1755, he married Ann Maudesley, the coheir to two manors. In the following year a daughter, Mary, was born at Kirkby Lonsdale. Ann died on 17 November 1756, shortly after the couple moved to Bersham to join Isaac Wilkinson.<h2>
<a name="Severnsideironworks"></a>Severnside ironworks</h2>From 1755 John Wilkinson is named as a partner in the Bersham concern, but he soon operated partly independently, becoming a managing partner in the New Willey Company of 1757 which took over the early coke-iron furnace at Willey, near Broseley in Shropshire. New furnaces and casting-houses produced a wide range of coke-pig castings, including cannon and shot, pipes, and cylinders; wagon-railways delivered raw materials to the works and carried finished goods to the Severn. While it is difficult to date, it was probably at the end of the 1750s that Wilkinson erected a furnace at Bradley, in Bilston parish, Staffordshire, but this was only of local importance until redeveloped in 1772. New Willey and Bradley were operated as coke furnaces, and Bersham for some time alternated between coke and charcoal iron but turned permanently to coke-pig after a difficult period during which Wilkinson developed his father's patented blowing engine successfully at all three works. He was operating New Willey with blowing-cylinders powered by a Newcomen engine before 1776, at which time a Watt engine was installed. Bersham in particular became an important producer of ordnance, Wilkinson selling through agents until 1770. Bersham and New Willey became producers of quality steam engine cylinders, making a price agreement for their sale with the original producers, the Darbys of Coalbrookdale, in 1762.<br>
<br>A key business change came from the bankruptcy of Edward Blakeway, partner in Bersham, New Willey, and Bradley, entailing the take-over of his shares by his sister-in-law, Mary Lee, who became the main shareholder. She married John Wilkinson in December 1763. In the depression following the end of the Seven Years' War there were disputes at Willey and also at Bersham, from where Isaac Wilkinson left to embark on foundry and furnace projects in Bristol and south Wales; but by 1766 John Wilkinson had emerged in control of both. Bersham became celebrated for high-quality casting and its guns sold well. Wilkinson developed a technique for boring iron guns from the solid, rotating the gun barrel rather than the boring-bar. Patented in 1774, this method produced guns less likely to explode and with a more accurate bore. While bronze cannon were already being bored from the solid, the boring of large naval iron cannon from the solid was a new method. The navy sought to overthrow the patent, though on the grounds that it was against the national interest and created a monopoly rather than on any technical invalidity. It was quashed in 1779, but this did not prevent Wilkinson remaining a major manufacturer of ordnance of high repute.<h2>
<a name="MakingcylindersforBoultonandWatt"></a>Making cylinders for Boulton and Watt</h2>In 1775 Wilkinson made his first steam engine cylinder for the firm of Boulton and Watt, which proved very satisfactory when other ironmasters had been unable to meet Watt's specifications. He built a Watt engine for his New Willey works, but quickly devised a new lathe, the cylinder lathe, for the more accurate casting of cylinders&#151;an invention of great importance which secured him a virtual monopoly, for Watt would not recommend other cylinder makers to those who wished to install his engines. For many years there were good personal and business relations between Wilkinson and the engine partners. Wilkinson continued to improve the cylinder lathe until 1779; he did not patent it, and it was copied by the Coalbrookdale Company and others. In 1774 Wilkinson had made his younger brother William a partner in Bersham, but during the visit of the Frenchman Marchant de la Houli&egrave;re to his Broseley works in 1775 he recommended William to him to go to France to set up ordnance works on his own pattern, which William did, at Indret, near Nantes. Subsequently, William was the technological adviser to the scheme to set up great coke-iron furnaces and associated plant at Le Creusot in Burgundy. It is clear that John acted as consultant to his brother in both projects. During the 1780s the works under John Wilkinson's control expanded and became more important. Bersham was less significant in furnace output but became outstanding for high-quality castings, ordnance, and calendered and other engineering goods, while its requirements in pig iron were satisfied from Wilkinson's other furnaces. These included one at Snedshill, Shropshire, in which he became a partner in 1777, and he soon added a second there; both furnaces were cylinder-blown by Boulton and Watt engines, and they were said to be very large for their time.<br>
<br>From 1772 the Bradley works was further extended and additional furnaces and rolling mills built. In the 1780s, first at Broseley, Wilkinson began to set up forges at his works to employ the Wright and Jesson &#145;stamping and potting&#146; process for the conversion of coke-pig to wrought iron, thus expanding the market, and in 1782 he set up forges for this process at Bradley, too, his forges being provided with steam-powered hammers worked by Boulton and Watt engines. The association with Boulton and Watt was very close from the late 1770s. It provided the engines for the Paris water company of which J.-C. Perier was the engineer and leading entrepreneur; Wilkinson made the cylinders for the engines and great quantities of iron water pipes. The engine parts were shipped to Paris with the collaboration of both governments, despite France joining in the American War of Independence; and the presence of Wilkinson's water pipes on British wharves gave rise to the belief that he supplied the French with cannon during the war. He was involved with Boulton and Watt, and even more the copper magnate Thomas Williams, in the intense negotiations over the future of the copper industry in the 1780s. At this period the main market for Boulton and Watt engines&#151;Wilkinson supplying the cylinders&#151;was the Cornish copper mines, and they, and Wilkinson, had invested in them. Wilkinson invested &pound;25,000 in the Cornish Metal Company of 1785 and he and Williams were decisive in the trade agreements of that year and their revision in 1787. Wilkinson became a shareholder in two of the subsidiaries of the Anglesey mines managed by Williams, and he was a partner in a Birmingham metal warehouse with him and Boulton and Watt.<h2>
<a name="Newfoundriesandnewtechniques"></a>New foundries and new techniques</h2>The important innovation of the 1780s in the iron industry was Henry Cort's puddling and rolling process for converting coke-pig to wrought iron. It had a period of difficult development under the patronage of Richard Crawshay. Wilkinson did not adapt it at once, though by 1789 he had himself produced improved rolls and dispensed with the old second, or chafery, stage of forging. He was experimenting with puddling itself by 1790. After nearly abandoning the experiment he began to succeed in the same year and was using it extensively by the mid-1790s. Bradley was further extended around 1790 with great use of steam power for furnace-blowing, boring, and turning, and for rolling mills and slitting mills.<br>
<br>In 1792 Wilkinson bought the Brymbo Hall estate in Denbighshire, where furnaces and other plant were installed. This great phase of expansion, well in place for the war demand after 1793, meant that he was producing in 1796 about one-eighth of the nation's iron (15,274 tons). Bersham alone was valued at over &pound;40,000 in 1789. Wilkinson was also important in the lead industry, being a major investor in Minera and other mines in north Wales, and he had several smelters, one of which was at Bersham. He had devised a process for producing lead pipe and had a works and depot for this at Rotherhithe, London.<br>
<br>In the 1790s Wilkinson was involved in two bitter disputes. One was with his brother William, and it related to William's shares in Bersham, which John had offered to let him increase, but only at a new and realistic valuation. William seems to have resented the expansion in other works, especially the nearby Brymbo, in which he did not have an interest, and the terms for renewed investment in Snedshill, in which he did. John may have been resentful at paying William his due share of the profits when he had long taken no part in management but had earned large sums from the French government by an arrangement secured for him by John. William believed that John's accounts for Bersham were drawn up in a way unfavourable to him, and that John had concealed profitable transactions with Thomas Williams and others. The quarrel went to chancery in 1794, and John put Bersham up for sale, which led to an action in king's bench. Eventually John bought out William's share in Bersham fairly cheaply, but arbitrators awarded William over &pound;8000 in dividends owed.<br>
<br>This suit tangled with a more celebrated one, between John Wilkinson and Boulton and Watt, and William moved into the latter's camp, recruiting key Bersham workers for its new engine-building works, Soho Foundry. It also acted as arbitrator in another quarrel between the brothers relating to lead mining in north Wales. Its own quarrel with John Wilkinson arose because he supplied a number of firms with &#145;pirate&#146; Boulton and Watt engines which he did not declare to the partnership, and the proprietors of these firms did not pay Boulton and Watt engine premiums (a fee for the use of their engines based on the fuel savings of Boulton and Watt engines in comparison with ordinary Newcomen engines). The partners probably knew of the piracies by 1795, but it was only in that year that Boulton was able to discharge a debt of &pound;5000 to Wilkinson. Some of the engines were owned by industrialists with low coal costs, certain to pay low premiums, and to such orders Boulton and Watt was believed to give low priority. Eventually Wilkinson had to compound with them for the payments on nineteen engines he had supplied to others and for some he had built for himself, but it was not until after 1798 that Boulton and Watt was able to dispense with his cylinders. While William and the Boulton and Watt circle tended to report with glee on John's business problems, John himself was building new furnaces in 1803&#150;4, and Bradley was certainly flourishing in the early years of the nineteenth century.<h2>
<a name="Diversification"></a>Diversification</h2>One of John Wilkinson's last inventions was the cupola furnace; originally thought of as a small smelter, it became popular for remelting pig for casting. He was a great advocate of the increased use of iron as a raw material, and while his more eccentric creations, such as his own coffin and memorial column, are often cited, he was an original subscriber to the world's first iron bridge of 1779&#151;that over the Severn at Ironbridge&#151;though he withdrew in favour of Abraham Darby III, its main advocate and constructor. He had two iron canal barges and a river barge built, the first iron cargo-carriers. Like many contemporary industrialists Wilkinson overcame the shortage of regal coin by issuing his own trade tokens, which were of high quality and displayed his own head and the inscription &#145;John Wilkinson Ironmaster&#146;. The first, of 1787, was struck by Thomas Williams, and later issues by Boulton and by Westwood. A silver version of the token was struck in small numbers. Wilkinson invested in two banks; one, a Shrewsbury bank, had been founded in 1792, Wilkinson entering it in 1795 when it was having difficulties. He joined a new Birmingham banking partnership in 1801. At his death he was still an investor in both banks.<br>
<br>Wilkinson was attracted to the profits to be made from canals. He was particularly involved in promoting the Flint Coal Canal, the Shropshire Canal, and the Shrewsbury Canal, and in the Glamorgan Canal primarily promoted by his friend Richard Crawshay. He was a leading shareholder in the less successful Chester and Ellesmere Canal. He was a committed agricultural improver, especially near his principal residences. In the late 1770s he bought Castlehead Hill near Grange-over-Sands, north Lancashire, building a mansion and improving 1000 acres of nearly worthless mossland surrounding it, typically developing new techniques to drain it so that it could produce crops. He seems to have been more interested in the achievement than in any economic return. At Brymbo he enhanced the value of the infertile land, largely by liming, so that it produced worthwhile yields. He employed a very early steam-powered threshing machine there by 1798. As well as Brymbo Hall and Castlehead, he had The Lawns (a much used house at Broseley), and a house at Bradley.<h2>
<a name="Personallifeandpersonality"></a>Personal life and personality</h2>While Wilkinson was sometimes referred to by other industrialists making representations to government, particularly on the iron trade, he tended to dislike any interruption to his iron making and generally wanted government to leave industry alone. His political attitudes surfaced rarely. He was very friendly with his brother-in-law, the scientist Joseph Priestley, who had married his sister Mary in 1762. When Priestley moved to take charge of the Unitarian New Meeting in Birmingham in 1780 Wilkinson bought him a house, and for a time he tried to train Priestley's son as a manager in the iron trade. Wilkinson seems to have shared Priestley's early enthusiasm for the French Revolution, and he gave him immediate and continuing financial aid after his house was burnt down in the Birmingham Church and King riots of 1791; he also made large investments in French <i>assignats</i>, mainly for Priestley's benefit. His own use of countersigned <i>assignats</i> as a form of token payment at Bersham was stopped by parliament in 1793.<br>
<br>Originally a Presbyterian, Wilkinson is thought to have moved to the Unitarianism of Priestley, and his early approval of the French Revolution is even taken as indicating deism or atheism. But while his burial memorial at Castlehead, an abbreviation of his own draft epitaph, dedicates his achievements to the glory of God, the full version also hoped for &#145;a Heavenly Mansion as promulgated by Jesus Christ, in whose gospel he was a firm believer&#146;&#151;seeming evidence that he was thus neither atheist nor deist. His sexual morals were easy-going. He and his second wife Mary had no children, she being about forty at the time of their marriage; however, he had a series of mistresses, some of whom were his servants. From 1800 he had a regular mistress, Ann Lewis, by whom he had three children when in his seventies. After his wife's death at Castlehead, probably in 1806, he legitimized these children and bequeathed his property in trust to them, but he left Castlehead to Ann. His nephew Thomas Jones, whom he had trained as a manager in the iron industry, was now only residuary legatee when he had expected to be sole heir.<br>
<br>After a short illness Wilkinson died at Bradley on 14 July 1808. He was buried at Castlehead, where an iron obelisk was erected in his memory. His nephew then contested the will in chancery, and with lawsuits continuing to 1823 and reaching the House of Lords at a time of depression and change within the iron industry, the works declined, the property was sold off, and Wilkinson's great industrial empire ingloriously disappeared. The only works that was bought was Brymbo, in 1842 by the railway engineer and investor William Robertson and others. It became once again an important works, and in the 1850s Robertson became a founder partner in Beyer Peacock, the well-known locomotive builders of Manchester. Wilkinson's son John, after attending Cambridge University and undergoing a spell in the army, was said to be profligate and to have emigrated to the United States. His daughters married well; the elder married William Legh, and their son became the first Lord Newton of Lyme.<br>
<br>Wilkinson is said to have been strongly built; he had a long, heavy face badly scarred by smallpox, and a strong deep voice. In the first great period of technology-driven expansion in the British iron industry&#151;even with contemporaries such as Abraham Darby III, Richard Crawshay, Richard Reynolds, and William Reynolds&#151;Wilkinson was the dominant figure, making a great impression on contemporaries at all levels and combining technological leadership and inventiveness with business ability. His confidence in his technical lead meant that his works were normally open to the inspection of foreigners. His imperious, almost despotic, attitude made him disliked by some contemporaries, but his excellent relations with Richard Crawshay, William Reynolds, and Thomas Williams are in contrast; too much weight, not unnaturally, has perhaps been put on the evidence of the Boulton and Watt correspondence. Though at times ruthless, he was generally considerate to good workmen, and alone among contemporary ironmasters he was a folk hero, celebrated in popular song, and the subject of myth, so that thousands are said to have gathered seven years after his death to await his prophesied reappearance.<br>
