<span class="headword">Nicholson, Sir  Charles Archibald</span>, second baronet  (1867&#150;1949), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at 26 Devonshire Place, London, on 27 April 1867, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35224/', "Sir Charles Nicholson, first baronet (1808&#150;1903)")</script>, educationist and politician, and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth Keightley (<i>d</i>. 1923). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35231/', "Sir Sydney Hugo Nicholson (1875&#150;1947)")</script>, the organist and church musician, was a younger brother. Charles was educated at Rugby School and at New College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1889 with a third class in modern history. He entered the architectural profession as a pupil in the office of J. D. Sedding, and to his training under this master of the Victorian Gothic style he owed much of his skill and enthusiasm for church design in structure as well as fittings and adornment. Subsequently he worked with Henry Wilson, another of Sedding's pupils, and in 1893 set up in practice for himself. In that year he won the Tite prize given for architectural design by the Royal Institute of British Architects, of which he was elected a fellow in 1905.<br>
<br>From 1895 until 1916 Nicholson was in partnership with Major Hubert Christian Corlette (<i>d</i>. 1956). In 1927, when the see of Portsmouth was founded, Thomas Johnson Rushton joined him in the adaptation and enlargement of the parish church of St Thomas &agrave; Becket, to form the new cathedral. This association continued until Nicholson's death. In the course of his career Nicholson was appointed consulting architect to seven cathedrals&#151;Lincoln, Wells, Lichfield, Llandaff, Sheffield, Portsmouth, and Belfast&#151;and diocesan architect to the sees of Wakefield, Winchester, Portsmouth, and Chelmsford.<br>
<br>Nicholson's skill and ingenuity were nowhere better shown than in the very large number of new parish churches which he designed and built. Besides these he refashioned, augmented, or furnished a much larger number of existing churches. The close of the Second World War brought him memorial work from many quarters, and one of the first memorial chapels was that built for his own school at Rugby. Another school chapel, at Clifton College, is much admired for its handling of the hexagonal lantern. Nicholson's Anglican cathedral work included the new east chapel at Norwich, the west front of Belfast (with memorial western porches, a new chapel of the Holy Spirit, and baptistery), various additions to Chelmsford, and the reconstruction of Portsmouth. Internal work and restoration were carried out at Brecon, Carlisle, Exeter, Leicester, Lichfield, Lincoln, Llandaff, Manchester, Salisbury, Wakefield, Wells, and Winchester. Nicholson used the English Gothic style with complete freedom, conceiving, in common with his contemporaries, that his work was not the less original in employing its idiom. Resourceful and creative, he delighted in the constructional problems which each task offered. Although practical and realistic, he was always an artist: a finished draughtsman, he had a delight in colour and used it frequently and with great effect in his decorative design. For secular buildings Nicholson could lay aside his Gothic style: Burton Manor, in the Wirral, is a distinguished classical house, and at Kingston, Jamaica, he produced a striking design for the government buildings in reinforced concrete, anticipating the later development of this material. Both these undertakings were carried out in partnership with Corlette.<br>
<br>Nicholson, who succeeded to the baronetcy in 1903, shunned publicity and found his chief recreation in travel. He was twice married: first, on 1 October 1895 to Evelyn Louise (<i>d</i>. 1927), daughter of the Revd Henry Arnold Olivier, and sister of Sydney Haldane Olivier (1859&#150;1943). They had one son, John Charles (<i>b</i>. 1904), who succeeded his father as third baronet, and two daughters. Nicholson married second, on 10 June 1931, Catherine Maud, daughter of Luckham Warren, of Winchfield, Hampshire. He died on 4 March 1949 at Headington, Oxford, and was buried at South Benfleet, Essex. His second wife survived him.<br>
