<span class="headword">Griffiths,  Philip Jones</span>  (1936&#150;2008), <span class="occ">photojournalist</span>, was born on 18 February 1936 at Monfa, Hylas Lane, Rhuddlan, Flintshire, the oldest of three sons of Joseph Griffiths (1903&#150;1962), a railway master fitter who worked at Llandudno Junction, and his wife, Lizzie (Catherine) Jones (<i>d</i>. 1973), a district nurse. His younger brothers were Penri Jones Griffiths (<i>b</i>. 1938) and Gareth Jones Griffiths (<i>b</i>. 1944). He spoke Welsh as his first language. He attended Rhuddlan county primary school until passing the eleven-plus examination and moving up the valley to St Asaph's Grammar School. For a short time his grandfather Henry Griffiths moved the village general store into the front room of the family home from where he traded until he was suddenly struck blind.<br>
<br>As a teenager Griffiths became a conscientious objector and a member of the Peace Pledge Union. His commitment to pacifism, together with his Welsh-bred partisan empathy for the underdog, became fixed ideals generating an emotive force visible in much of his work. While still at school he worked as a trainee pharmacist at Boots the chemists in Rhyl. The Rhyl Camera Club was situated upstairs, and it was there that he became exposed to the work of Henri Cartier-Bresson and nurtured his passion for photography. He began to explore north Wales on his motorbike, documenting the plight of Welsh villagers displaced by flooding. At home the back yard was turned into a chemistry laboratory and the bathroom was converted into a darkroom, complete with an enlarger that swung up on a sprung shelf. Prints, such as his portraits of the theatre director Sam Wanamaker, were dried on a line in the kitchen. He never lost his boyish fascination with the technical aspects of his craft: processing, printing, cameras, and optics. As a teenager he saved up for camera equipment by photographing group portraits of convalescing Derbyshire miners at Pengwern Hall, a short ride from Rhuddlan.<br>
<br>After moving to Liverpool to study pharmacy Griffiths photographed the nascent arts scene in the city, accompanying the poet Adrian Henri, an old school friend from St Asaph's, and photographing the Beatles' first concert at the Liverpool Empire. He completed his studies in Sunderland then moved to London, where he worked in the pharmacy at St Mary Abbot's Hospital, Kensington, and as the night manager of Boots in Piccadilly, often managing the needs of drug addicts. By day he photographed Soho life and bunked in a brothel near Leicester Square with his brother Penri. His support for pacifism led him to photograph the first and subsequent Aldermaston marches. His first break came when the influential editor of <span class="italic">Photography</span> magazine named the aspiring Welshman as one of the five best photographers of 1960. This led to a job with <span class="italic">The Observer</span> in 1961. A year later his reputation as an international photojournalist blossomed with his scoop on the <i>regroupement</i> programme during the Algerian War. When the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> colour magazines were launched in 1962 and 1964 he went on to freelance for them on assignments in Mongolia and Ethiopia.<br>
<br>In 1966 Griffiths joined Magnum Photos as an associate, and in the same year set out to report on the Vietnam War, a five-year odyssey that was to become the defining juncture of his career. He lambasted the stupidity of war, yet at the same time photographed with intimate tenderness its victims on both sides of the conflict, resulting in some of the finest war photographs of the twentieth century. <span class="italic">Vietnam Inc.</span>, a classic in the history of photojournalism, was finally published in 1971, with most of the printing, text, and design having been prepared with his partner, Heather Holden, in London and New York. <span class="italic">Vietnam Inc.</span>&#151;its moving photographs and accompanying polemic&#151;helped turn public opinion against the war in south-east Asia, although by 1971 there was already widespread disaffection. Following the critical success of the book Griffiths sought to build on the impact that it had made. During the 1970s he went on to photograph Cambodia, the Yom Kippur War, the conflict in Northern Ireland, and Rhodesia where, in the most frightening incident of his life, he had a hood placed over his head and was taken out to be shot.<br>
<br>In 1980 Griffiths was elected president of Magnum Photos for a five-year term during which, he claimed, he &#145;dragged Magnum kicking and screaming into the twentieth century&#146;  (private information). He moved to 36th Street in New York and in 1981 began a ten-year relationship with the photographer Donna Ferrato. His later books included <span class="italic">Dark Odyssey</span> (1996), <span class="italic">Agent Orange: Collateral Damage in Vietnam</span> (2004), <span class="italic">Vietnam at Peace</span> (2005), <span class="italic">Recollections</span> (2008), and a new edition of <span class="italic">Vietnam Inc.</span> (2006).<br>
<br>Griffiths was courageous, charismatic, disarmingly funny, and caring&#151;especially about the plight of the disempowered. He was also stubborn and unforgiving. He had entrenched opinions on a wide range of things he abhorred such as smoking, military power, and perceived disloyalty. He was &#145;the spirit of contradiction&#146; but at the same time gave to photojournalism its moral soul. He died at his home in 195A Goldhawk Road, Shepherd's Bush, London, on 19 March 2008 of colon cancer. He was survived by his two daughters, Katherine Holden and Fenella Ferrato (both born in 1982).<br>
