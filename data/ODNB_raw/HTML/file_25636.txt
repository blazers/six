<span class="headword">Sinclair,  William</span>  (1804&#150;1878), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25627/', "Sir John Sinclair, first baronet (1754&#150;1835)")</script>, of Ulbster, Caithness, and his second wife, Diana MacDonald (1769&#150;1845), daughter of Alexander, first Baron MacDonald of Sleat, was born in Edinburgh on 4 September 1804. He was a brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25612/', "Catherine Sinclair (1800&#150;1864)")</script>, author, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25617/', "Sir George Sinclair (1790&#150;1868)")</script>, and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25629/', "Archdeacon John Sinclair (1797&#150;1875)")</script>. On leaving Winchester College he obtained, at the age of sixteen, a commission as captain in the Madras cavalry, and distinguished himself by leading a forlorn hope at the siege of Kittur. After returning to England he matriculated from St Mary's Hall, Oxford, in 1832 and graduated BA with fourth-class honours in classics in 1835 and MA in 1837. At Oxford he became president of the union when its members included Archibald Tait, Roundell Palmer, Edward Cardwell, and Robert Lowe. Thomas Jackson, in his preface to the Oxford squib <span class="italic">Uniomachia: a Greek-Latin Macaronic Poem</span> (5th edn, 1877), states that while engaged on it he had a visit from Sinclair, his college friend, who, he says, &#145;entered heartily into the scheme, and composed many of the best lines and notes&#146;.<br>
<br>Sinclair married in 1837 Helen (<i>d</i>. October 1842), daughter of William Ellice and niece of Edward Ellice the elder. In the same year he was ordained, and he became vicar of St George's, Leeds, in 1839, where his liberal evangelical views are said to have brought him into conflict with W. F. Hook, vicar of Leeds. In 1846, following the death of his first wife, he married Sophia Mary Georgiana, daughter of the Revd James Tripp. Parochial work, such as serving on a committee to consider proposals for tackling the unchurched masses, undermined Sinclair's health, and in 1857 he accepted the rectory of Pulborough, Sussex, where he rebuilt the church and rectory, and started schools and chapels in different parts of the parish. In 1874 he was appointed by Dr Durnford to a prebendal stall in Chichester Cathedral. Sinclair published a manual of prayers and edited his brother's archidiaconal charges as well as books on a military theme. He died at Pulborough on 8 July 1878. There were two sons from his first marriage; the two daughters and three sons from his second marriage included William Macdonald Sinclair (1850&#150;1917), archdeacon of London from 1889 to 1911, and John Stewart Sinclair (1853&#150;1919), archdeacon of Cirencester from 1908 to 1919.<br>
