<span class="headword">Maude,  Francis Cornwallis</span>  (1828&#150;1900), <span class="occ">army officer and entrepreneur</span>, was born on 28 October 1828 at Sussex Place, Regent's Park, London, the eldest son of Francis Maude (1798&#150;1886), a captain in the Royal Navy and the youngest son of Cornwallis Maude, first Viscount Hawarden in the Irish peerage, and his first wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1832), second daughter of A. Holdsworth Brooking, collector of customs at St John's, Newfoundland. Maude was a cousin of General Sir Frederick Francis Maude (1821&#150;1897), who won the VC in September 1855 at Sevastopol, Crimea. After attending Blackheath proprietary school, an army crammer, and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1844&#150;7), he was commissioned second lieutenant, Royal Artillery, in October 1847 (lieutenant, June 1848), and served at Woolwich and in Ireland. In 1854, on sick leave, he travelled for ten months and visited India. Promoted second captain in December 1854, in 1855 he was sent in command of his battery to Trincomalee, Ceylon.<br>
<br>In June 1857 came the news of the Indian mutiny, and Maude's battery sailed to Calcutta. At Allahabad they joined Henry Havelock's force&#151;intended to relieve the British garrison besieged at Lucknow&#151;which left in early July. Maude's battery had 9-pounder smooth-bores, drawn by bullocks, and was repeatedly in action. Havelock's column defeated the rebels and on 17 July occupied Cawnpore. The artillery's role was largely counter-battery fire, engaging and silencing mutineer artillery. Ordered by Havelock, Maude once executed an alleged spy by blowing him from a gun.<br>
<br>On 25 September 1857 Havelock's force fought through into the Lucknow residency, suffering heavy casualties. Maude and his artillery were prominent in the attack. Reportedly Maude bore down the desperate opposition of the enemy, though with the loss of one third of his artillerymen, and but for his nerve and coolness the army could not have advanced. Havelock's force was too small to relieve the Lucknow garrison and the siege continued, with Maude commanding the artillery. Thrice recommended for the Victoria Cross&#151;when balloted his battery voted for him to receive it&#151;Maude was awarded it (gazetted June 1858) for his conduct on 25 September: one of eleven awarded for that day, with seven for the next day (182 VCs were awarded for the mutiny, the same number as for the Second World War). Following the arrival of Colin Campbell's relief force (17 November) the British withdrew from Lucknow (22&#150;3 November). Maude commanded a battery in James Outram's force in Oudh, then in March 1858 took part in Campbell's recapture of Lucknow. After the summer of 1858 Maude was sent north to Campbell's &#145;cold weather&#146; campaign, with a battery of long 18-pounder iron guns drawn by elephants.<br>
<br>During the mutiny Maude gained promotion to major (January 1858) and lieutenant colonel (July 1858) in the army (his regimental rank was still second captain); he was appointed CB in March 1858. However, the auditor-general disallowed payments made by Maude, who later complained that the Indian campaign had ruined him financially  (Maude and Sherer, <span class="italic">Memories of the Mutiny</span>, 2.480&#150;01).<br>
<br>At Colombo, Ceylon, on 24 January 1860 Maude married Paulina Susannah (<i>d</i>. 1916), only daughter of Paul Ivy Sterling, acting chief justice of Ceylon; they had one son and three daughters. Promoted full captain, Royal Artillery, in April 1860, Maude was appointed to a garrison artillery battery at Plymouth. From 1861 to 1864 he served on Corfu. He served two years on Malta and suffered from Malta fever (brucellosis). Promoted to colonel (20 July 1866) he retired in August 1866 on half pay, which he commuted in June 1870, presumably to raise capital to invest.<br>
<br>After leaving the army Maude was involved in various enterprises in Britain and overseas. He invested in patent ice-making machinery and became the proprietor of the Malta Ice Works. Back in England, in 1867 he founded and became honorary secretary of the Free Labour Registration Society. An anti-trade-union, &#145;blackleg&#146; organization, pledged to the &#145;total abolishment of Trades' Unions&#146;  (Curthoys, 81), its strike-breaking activities were particularly vigorous in Lancashire. Maude claimed to have fought twenty-six pitched battles with trade unions over a period of eighteen months. In December 1867 he was reported bankrupt. He was among the promoters of the Charity Organization Society (1869). In 1869 he started the Emigrant and Colonists' Aid Corporation. He was secretary, the duke of Manchester was chairman, peers and &#145;substantial City men&#146; were on the board, and the company secured land in New Zealand. Maude employed as a clerk at the company a mutiny veteran, Major &#145;Brown&#146; Holland, and had him wrongly imprisoned in March 1870 for allegedly misappropriating a cheque. Maude had to pay damages and costs, and the episode cost him &#145;a good deal over &pound;250&#146;  (Maude and Sherer, <span class="italic">Memories of the Mutiny</span>, 2.464). In 1870 Maude purchased some 600 acres of free grant land in Canada, where for three years he cleared forest and farmed. He farmed in southern England for another three years. He lived at Southsea and was chairman of the co-operative stores there. In 1875 and 1876 he lived in France. From 1876 to 1886 he was consul-general at Warsaw, and he also grew sugar beet in Poland. In March 1886 he retired from being consul-general on a pension, which he commuted that May.<br>
<br>In February 1888 Maude went to Madagascar for the Madagascar Timber Company, which was granted a monopoly timber-felling concession within north-east Madagascar. He negotiated with the prime minister over the company's concession, participated in its timber business, and on a small experimental plantation grew vanilla, coffee, and other crops. He wrote to the British press extolling Madagascar as a field for British emigration and enterprise, including coffee-growing, and offered to board visitors for a dollar a day. He was employed by the Malagasy government as a military and political adviser for nearly a year, but had difficulty in obtaining his arrears of salary. Shortly after resigning this post, in 1892 he founded, edited, and wrote his short-lived English-language paper <span class="italic">The Madagascar World</span>. He contributed articles on Madagascar to the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, from 1891 to 1895, and in 1895, following the French invasion of the island, published <span class="italic">Five Years in Madagascar: with Notes on the Military Situation</span>. He criticized the Malagasy government as &#145;a tyrannous and rapacious Oligarchy&#146;  (Maude, <span class="italic">Five Years</span>, 184), and favoured French control of Madagascar to &#145;throw open its resources&#146;  (ibid., 273).<br>
<br>Maude returned to England in February 1893, and published his <span class="italic">Memories of the Mutiny</span> (2 vols., 1894), which described his experiences, criticized British generalship, justified the executions of mutineers, and asserted the beneficence of British rule in India. <span class="italic">Memories</span> incorporated, with acknowledgement, the &#145;personal narrative&#146; of John Walter Sherer (1823&#150;1911) of the Indian Civil Service.<br>
<br>Troubled by financial difficulties during much of his later life, Maude was in 1895 appointed by Queen Victoria a military knight of Windsor, an establishment which was reserved for retired officers in needy circumstances and which brought with it quarters in Windsor Castle. A freemason (he had been initiated in an Irish lodge and joined Pythagoras Lodge, Corcyra, Corfu, in November 1861) and a Conservative, Maude was a &#145;Baconian&#146; who claimed Francis Bacon wrote Shakespeare's plays: in 1895 he published his shilling pamphlet <span class="italic">Bacon or Shakspere?</span>. Maude died suddenly of angina pectoris near the Garter House, Windsor Castle, on 19 October 1900, and was buried in Windsor cemetery four days later. His Royal Artillery battery, 76, celebrated Maude's day each 25 September, the anniversary of the deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.<br>
