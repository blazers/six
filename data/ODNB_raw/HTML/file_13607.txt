<span class="headword">Holroyd, Sir  George Sowley</span>  (1758&#150;1831), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 31 October 1758 in York, the eldest son of George Holroyd and Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sowley, of Appleby, Westmorland, and a distant relative of John Baker Holroyd, first earl of Sheffield. His comfortable expectations as a boy were shattered by his father's losses from speculation. Instead of going to university, in April 1774 he had to be removed from Harrow School and articled to a London attorney, Mr Borthwick. Having determined on a career at the bar he entered Gray's Inn in 1777 and two years later set himself up as a special pleader. In eighteenth-century common law, the drawing of pleadings was an ancillary but significant craft and Holroyd seems to have been well fitted to its recondite niceties. With Samuel Romilly, Edward Christian, and John Baynes, Holroyd formed a mooting group where each argued a problem case for one party or gave a reasoned judgment. This exercise in mutual training must have been particularly useful at a time when formal legal education scarcely existed.<br>
<br>By 1787 Holroyd was in a position both to be called to the bar and, on 10 September that year, to marry Sarah Chaplin (<i>bap</i>. 1768) at St Paul's Covent Garden. Baptized a Roman Catholic, she was the daughter of Amos Chaplin of Brydges Street, Covent Garden, and his wife, Maria Anna. They had fourteen children, six of whom lived to survive their father. His career prospered; according to Foss &#145;his fee-book shows the rapid increase in his practice, proving also the advance of his reputation by the number and importance of the cases submitted to his direction&#146;  (Foss, <span class="italic">Judges</span>). It was an advance built upon a quiet, judicious temperament, a fund of knowledge, and a natural ability for putting things in convincing perspective. Chief Justice Campbell would later proclaim Holroyd's &#145;genius for the law&#146;  (Campbell, 356) and Lord Brougham, for once in agreement, described him (on his memorial in Wargrave church) as &#145;one of the most able, most learned, and most virtuous men that ever &hellip; adorned the profession of the law&#146;.<br>
<br>A rather shy man, Holroyd did not seek appointment as king's counsel, but his skills were well enough appreciated, notably by Edward Law, first Baron Ellenborough, the domineering chief justice of king's bench. In 1812 the democrat Sir Francis Burdett published what the Commons decided was a libel upon it, and it ordered his arrest. Holroyd appeared for Burdett in a subsequent action against Speaker Charles Abbot for damages, and argued the case for the absence of such a power in the Commons alone by an exhaustive survey of precedent and practice from the thirteenth century onwards. Ellenborough, while clearly determined to uphold what had been done, treated the counter-arguments with great attention. Four years later, on 14 February 1816, he secured Holroyd's accession to his court.<br>
<br>Holroyd served as one of the three puisne judges of king's bench with, first, Ellenborough and then Charles Abbott, first Baron Tenterden, as his chiefs. Sitting with Sir John Bayley and Sir Joseph Littledale, both men of notable learning, the court enjoyed a decade of strong reputation. At this period king's bench continued to have a much greater flow of causes laid in it than either of its rivals, the courts of common pleas and of exchequer. This preference, which turned upon a number of factors, was certainly enhanced in those periods when the bar and attorneys placed their trust in the membership of the court.<br>
<br>Holroyd can be seen in typical form in the case of <i>Blundell v. Catterall</i> (1821); holding that a member of the public has no directly enforceable right to cross the foreshore in order to bathe in the sea, his display of legal learning is notable both for its depth and its analytic dissection. Many similar instances of decisions on matters of private right could be given. Occasionally Holroyd was also drawn back into political dramas. In <i>Redford v. Birley</i> (1822) he had to try a civil action for assault by one of the victims of the Peterloo riots against the yeomanry members who mowed him down. He directed the jury at York assizes with calm persistence and secured a verdict exonerating the defendants that clearly he thought justified. The full bench upheld his conduct of the proceedings, as to which nice questions arose about the admissibility of evidence, and the jury's verdict.<br>
<br>Holroyd remained in office until the age of seventy, when ill health forced his retirement, on 17 November 1828. He died at his home, Hare Hatch, Wargrave, Berkshire, on 21 December 1831, leaving his widow in less than comfortable circumstances, and was buried at Wargrave parish church.<br>
