<span class="headword">Waterston,  George</span>  (1911&#150;1980), <span class="occ">ornithologist and conservationist</span>, was born on 10 April 1911 in Edinburgh, the oldest of the seven children (four boys and three girls) of Robert Waterston (1878&#150;1969), director of George Waterston &amp; Sons, Edinburgh, stationers and printers (founded by Robert's great-great-grandfather), and his wife, Winifred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sandeman (1889&#150;1978). He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, where he gained colours for rugby football and cricket, later playing for the Academicals and captaining the second fifteen. On leaving school he joined his father's firm, remaining there until he became a full-time ornithologist in 1955. During the Second World War he served with the Royal Artillery and was captured in Crete.<br>
<br>Waterston's interest in birds was evident when he was a small child; while still at school he gave a lecture on bird-watching, during which he roundly denounced the hobby of egg collecting. He was a founder member of both the Inverleith Field Club and the Midlothian Ornithological Club, and in 1934 was the chief instigator of the Isle of May Bird Observatory, the first co-operative bird migration centre to be set up in Britain. In 1936 he became the primary force behind the formation of the Scottish Ornithologists' Club, and was elected its first honorary secretary in 1955.<br>
<br>Waterston had a deep interest in Fair Isle, an important resting site for migratory birds. He first visited the island in 1935; in 1943, having been repatriated from Germany because of kidney trouble, he was on board a hospital ship crossing the North Sea from Sweden when he sighted the Sheep Craig at Fair Isle&#151;his first glimpse of his homeland. These experiences bound him fervently to the island: he was one of the instrumental forces behind the foundation of the Fair Isle Bird Observatory. In 1955 Waterston not only took on the secretaryship of the Scottish Ornithologists' Club, but became Scottish officer for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). In time he so greatly developed this position that he was appointed full-time director (Scotland) of the RSPB, a post which he held for thirteen years. During his years in post he travelled all over Scotland and dealt with the full gamut of bird protection issues.<br>
<br>In 1947 Waterston married Nancy Ritchie (<i>b</i>. 1914). The couple had a son, William, who became a solicitor. However, the marriage was ultimately dissolved, and in 1958 he married Irene Kinnear (1914&#150;1984), who shared his interests and activities to the full, and whose deep interest in Arctic botany led to the establishment of the couple as a formidable research team in Arctic wildlife; they undertook several expeditions to Greenland and Ellesmere Island. Irene jointly with George organized the first Scottish bird islands study cruise, part of the International Ornithological Congress of 1966, when over 900 ornithologists from thirty-two countries visited a number of Scottish islands.<br>
<br>In 1948 Waterston was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1964 he was appointed OBE for his services to British ornithology: specifically for bird protection in Scotland. In 1974 he received an honorary degree (LLD) from the University of Dundee, and was elected president of the Arctic Club in 1978.<br>
<br>Waterston's active life in the field and as an organizer precluded the production of much published work, but he co-produced a long paper with James Fisher on the fulmar  (<span class="italic">Journal of Animal Ecology</span>, 10, 1941, 204&#150;72) and the chapter on the gannet in Bannerman's <span class="italic">The Birds of the British Isles</span> (1959). With Philip Brown he wrote <span class="italic">The Return of the Osprey</span> (1962), and with Roy Dennis, <span class="italic">The Osprey and Speyside Wildlife</span> (1969). His last book, <span class="italic">Fair Isle: a Photographic History</span> (1983), was completed after his death by Jean Jones.<br>
<br>On Waterston's retirement he and his wife moved to Keith Bridge, Humbie, East Lothian. In the early 1970s he began to suffer increasingly from kidney trouble; after a failed transplant attempt, he became dependent on a dialysis machine at home. Despite this logistic burden, he still managed to visit Fair Isle three times; the last time in June 1980. He died three months later, on 20 September 1980, at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, and was buried on 24 September in the churchyard of the old parish church at Humbie.<br>
<br>Waterston arguably did more than anyone else to establish ornithology in Scotland, despite his lack of formal training. He was, additionally, a gregarious and kind man, with friends in all walks of life, who much enjoyed his great sense of humour. He was a determined and organized operator, who would ardently pursue an end product with keen verbal proddings, or (when this was impossible) a continual stream of &#145;George's memos&#146;.<br>
