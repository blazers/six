<span class="headword">Boosey,  Leslie Arthur</span>  (1887&#150;1979), <span class="occ">music publisher</span>, was born in Bromley, Kent, on 26 July 1887, the eldest of five children (three sons and two daughters) of Arthur Boosey, music publisher, and his wife, Lucy Ashton. After some years at Malvern College he chose, instead of going to a university, to work for a time in the music publishing house of Durand in Paris, before joining the family business, a conservative and rather old-fashioned one largely associated at that time with the Boosey Ballad Concerts in the Albert Hall.<br>
<br>In 1908 Boosey joined the 22nd London regiment (the Queen's) as a territorial officer, and during the First World War served with it in France (1915&#150;18). Captured, as a major, in the March offensive of 1918, he was put up against a wall to be shot for refusing to give information to the enemy: at the last moment, however, the German officer changed his mind: &#145;All right&#146;, he said, &#145;you can go back; you're a gentleman&#146;. Boosey was recommended for appointment to the DSO, but the recommendation miscarried&#151;the first but not the last occasion on which deserved recognition, sponsored by responsible people, was not forthcoming. He was, however, appointed a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. On 28 April 1921 Boosey married Ethel Torfrida (<i>b</i>. 1898/9), daughter of Frank Marchant, paper maker; they had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>When he got back to the publishing business in 1920, Boosey had to adapt himself to conditions very different from those of 1914. Recording and radio transmission had created new problems and possibilities, and Boosey met the challenge by establishing firm friendships with many leading composers. A merger with the firm of Hawkes, completed in 1930, led to important developments in the manufacture of musical instruments and increased publishing activity, especially in the American market. The culmination of this vigorous expansion came with the acquisition in 1947 of the Koussevitsky catalogue, which added the names of Prokofiev, Rakhmaninov, and Stravinsky to a list that already included those of Strauss, Bart&oacute;k, Copland, and Britten. By this time the firm of Boosey and Hawkes, in its own field, was one of the most influential in the world.<br>
<br>Leslie Boosey was an adventurous and shrewd publisher, but he was also a very scrupulous one. His weakness, if weakness it was, lay in his readiness to trust everybody and to believe that people would not do to him the things he would never do to them: he lived to learn that this was over-optimistic. In the later years of his publishing career he began to find himself involved in circumstances that were distasteful; and in 1963, after some years of increasing discomfort, he severed his connection with the firm whose prosperity he had done so much to create and sustain.<br>
<br>Boosey retained until the end of his life a great influence in the Performing Right Society, which he had joined in 1926, and whose chairman he became in 1929. This office he held with distinction until 1954, when he gave up the post to Sir Arthur Bliss. During his period of office he attended all the great international conferences, where he was respected by publishers, authors, and composers alike. In 1976 he was awarded the International Society's gold medal. He was also honoured by the Royal Philharmonic Society of London, with which he was closely associated during most of his life.<br>
<br>Boosey should be remembered, if for nothing else, for the fact that in 1944, by his personal initiative, he saved the Royal Opera House from becoming a Mecca dance-hall. He had learnt that a lease was about to be signed which would produce that very result, and he acted quickly. With his partner Ralph Hawkes, having been to Washington to gain the support of Lord Keynes, he secured the lease for the firm of Boosey and Hawkes and the Covent Garden Opera Company. It was an achievement of great importance at the time and for the future.<br>
<br>A casual observer, meeting Leslie Boosey, might have taken him for a typically urbane and conventional businessman; it would have been a mistake, for beneath the polished surface there lay a different reality. Experience in the trenches, which included the death of a loved brother and many friends, had led him to examine and reject most of the comfortable beliefs learned at home and at school, and to search for more dependable convictions. His mind was naturally sceptical and critical; he read widely in philosophy, theology, history, and science, and wrote a great deal, though not for publication. He was always ready to submit his views to criticism and discussion. And these studies, continued until the onset of his last illness, were undertaken not as an intellectual pastime, but in order to discover a way of life. That he was successful in this endeavour is suggested by the fact that he was able to accept without bitterness the realization that a long and helpful career had passed without public recognition&#151;a source of surprise and regret to those who knew his work. His gaiety, his lively mind, and his amused observation of the world and its ways, made him a sought-after companion in the Savile Club and elsewhere. To those fortunate enough to know him better he was a great deal more than that.<br>
<br>Leslie Boosey died at his home, Meadowlands, Hambledon Road, Denmead, Hampshire, on 5 September 1979.<br>
