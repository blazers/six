</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stanfield,  Clarkson</span>  (1793&#150;1867), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born at 18 High Street East, Sunderland, co. Durham, on 3 December 1793, apparently the fifth and youngest child, and the younger son, of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26236/', "James Field Stanfield (1749&#150;1824)")</script>, actor and author, and his first wife, Mary Hoad, who died in January 1801. No baptismal records of James's first family are known&#151;possibly a consequence of his Catholicism&#151;but his son's given names were either Clarkson Frederick or Frederick Clarkson Field. Since his later signet bore the initials CFS the former is more likely; Clarkson, the only name that he used, was given to him for Thomas Clarkson, the abolitionist, whom his father knew in that cause. Adding to the uncertainty is his apparent Catholic rebaptism as Thomas Clarkson Stanfield, at St Mary's Chapel, Hampstead, on 3 October 1846, a week after his namesake's death. The name William Clarkson, a recurring error in the literature about him, may originate in a misreading of his monogram signature, or from confusion with his half-brother, William James Stanfield (1804&#150;1827), whom he trained as a scene painter in London and who worked briefly there and in Manchester before his early death. Stanfield's elder brother, James George Stanfield (1787?&#150;1853), became a seaman-gunner and appears to have died as a Birmingham hawker. An older sister, Mary, who may have become a Mrs Cuthbert, was an actress at the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh (1809&#150;22), and a personal prot&eacute;g&eacute;e there of its leading lady and joint manager, Harriet Murray (Mrs Henry Siddons) from late 1811. The names of two other full sisters may have been Jemima and Helen.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Stanfield's mother is said to have been artistic and to have taught painting; family report gives Clarkson's childhood ambition to be a &#145;parson or a painter&#146;. As a boy he occasionally appeared on stage before being apprenticed to a heraldic coach painter in Edinburgh in 1806. In 1808 he ran away because of the drunkenness of his master's wife, and went to sea in a collier, possibly the brig <i>Alexander</i>, of North Shields, in which he was serving when in July 1812 she was taken up as a transport in London. He was then pressed into the navy as an able seaman on the London receiving ship <i>Enterprise</i> under the alias Roderick Bland, although &#145;Patrick Bland&#146; is given, wrongly, in all naval musters after the first. For the next two years he was in the Sheerness guardship <i>Namur</i>, under Captain Charles Austen (brother of the novelist Jane Austen), where his talents were noticed in painting a toy coach for the captain's children and, reputedly, scenery for amateur theatricals in which the playwright and journalist Douglas Jerrold was involved as a naval boy volunteer. In 1814, while helping to decorate the port admiral's ballroom in Sheerness Dockyard, he was promised shore employment by the yard commissioner, William Lobb, but the latter's death in July forestalled this. Back afloat, Stanfield's health deteriorated (perhaps exacerbated by an injury to his left leg from a fall) and he was discharged ashore from the hospital ship <i>Ceres</i> on 9 December 1814, and rejoined his family in Scotland. Early in 1815, still listed as able seaman Patrick Bland, he joined the East Indiaman <i>Warley</i> in London, and in April sailed for Whampoa (Huangpu), in China, from where he returned with many sketches in May 1816. His next ship, the Indiaman <i>Hope</i>, did not sail for Madras, as expected; instead in August of that year he gained employment as a decorator and scene painter at the Royalty Theatre, Wellclose Square, London.<br>
<br>Stanfield married, first, Mary Hutchinson (1798/1799&#150;1821), an actress at the Royalty Theatre, at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, on 20 July 1818. They had a son, Clarkson William (1819&#150;1853), and a daughter, Mary (1821&#150;1854), following whose birth Mary Stanfield died. Probably early in 1825 Stanfield married Rebecca Adcock (1808&#150;1875), an actress from a northern theatrical family long acquainted with his own, and together they had eight sons and two daughters, born between February 1826 and 1845.<h2>
<a name="Theatrepainter"></a>Theatre painter</h2>Stanfield remained intermittently connected with the Royalty (also called the East London) until late 1822, when he was nominally &#145;scenic director&#146;, but when Joseph Glossop opened the new Coburg Theatre (now the Old Vic) in May 1818 he was engaged there under J. T. Serres. Glossop moved him to Astley's Amphitheatre when he and William Barrymore (whose real name was Blewitt, or Bluett) opened it for a winter season in 1819, and he was part of the Astley's company that Barrymore took to the Edinburgh Pantheon in autumn 1820. There, through his father, he met the painter David Roberts, a lifelong friend with whom he first worked at the Edinburgh Theatre Royal early in 1821. He had exhibited his first easel paintings at the Royal Academy and at the British Institution in 1820, and showed three at the Edinburgh Institution exhibition in 1821 before his return to Astley's in April of that year and to the Coburg from October. At the end of 1822 Glossop's Coburg regime collapsed, and Stanfield, Roberts, and Barrymore (as director of spectacle) were engaged by R. W. Elliston at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Stanfield's work, already well noticed at the minor theatres, made an immediate impression there in helping Barrymore to revitalize Elliston's failed Christmas pantomime <span class="italic">Gog and Magog</span> (with scenes by Roberts and their friend Alexander Nasmyth) as <span class="italic">The Golden Axe</span>. This secured him an initial three-year contract at &pound;8 a week from 14 January 1823, and at Drury Lane over the next twelve years he achieved a legendary reputation as a creator of romantic landscape scenery, supported and rivalled by Roberts in architectural subjects until 1826. He worked with great speed and facility, and their joint efforts successfully challenged the dominance of the Grieve family of scene painters at Covent Garden. Stanfield's work especially &#145;taught pit and gallery to admire landscape art and the boxes to become connoisseurs&#146;, according to his friend W. M. Thackeray  (Marvy, <span class="italic">Sketches after English Landscape Painters</span>). He was especially famed for his vast &#145;moving dioramas&#146;&#151;land and seascape panoramas, unrolling with complex lighting and mechanics as travelogue interludes, introduced mainly into Christmas pantomimes and Easter spectacles. Subjects included the building of Plymouth breakwater (1823, which he repainted at Birmingham in 1824); the <span class="italic">Adventures of a Ship of War</span> (1825); views on the Rhine and <span class="italic">Spithead to Gibraltar</span> (1828); <span class="italic">Windsor and its Vicinity</span> (1829); Napoleon's passage of the Simplon (1830); Venice (1831); and Niagara (1832). As Ottley later wrote:<blockquote>Only those who have seen these really stupendous works can form an idea of the inventive talent and artistic skill displayed, and the extent of travel developed in them &hellip; and whilst they established the fame of the author they led to a permanent advance and improvement in the scenic decoration of our theatres. (Ottley, 155)</blockquote>In 1826, when Elliston's management failed, the Drury Lane proprietors presented Stanfield with a silver testimonial to his efforts for the theatre, while the size of his name on the playbills in his later career itself indicated the star status of his work. At Christmas 1834 a confrontation with manager Alfred Bunn over the precedence between scenery and horses in the equestrian spectacle of <span class="italic">King Arthur</span> by Isaac Pocock led to Stanfield's resignation, which friends and the pressures of his easel work had already been urging. However, he willingly returned to help his friend W. C. Macready's management of both Covent Garden (1837&#150;9) and Drury Lane (1841&#150;3), supporting his dramatic reforms by contributing, at Covent Garden, a diorama, <span class="italic">Scenes at Home and Abroad</span>, to his Christmas pantomime of 1837 and dioramic illustrations to the chorus scenes in a seminal revival of <span class="italic">Henry V</span> in 1839, and the scenery of Macready's equally spectacular Drury Lane staging of Handel's <span class="italic">Acis and Galatea</span> (1842). His designs for the latter were reused for a revival at the Princess's Theatre in 1869, and most of them are among about eighty pieces that came to light in 1993 and are now in the Theatre Museum, London; no more than ten previously were known. In all Stanfield painted over 550 scenes in more than 170 productions in his scenic career.<br>
<br>Outside the theatre Stanfield painted the moving panoramas <span class="italic">Destruction of Algiers, 1816</span> (with Roberts, 1824) and <span class="italic">Battle of Navarino</span> (with his pupil Charles Tomkins, Roberts, and J. W. Allen, 1828). The first was seen in Liverpool, then in the Netherlands and Germany; the latter in those countries before returning to Hull. He also painted a &#145;Poecilorama&#146; of small dioramic views for the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly and <span class="italic">The Ruins of an Italian Abbey by Moonlight</span> at Vauxhall Gardens (both 1826), and, with Roberts and others, views for the British Diorama at the Royal Bazaar, Oxford Street (1828&#150;9), where in the latter year his <span class="italic">York with the Cathedral on Fire</span> (resulting from Jonathan Martin's arson) itself caught fire during a showing and destroyed the bazaar; he painted further views for it (in 1830 and 1834) after it had been rebuilt. His last professional stage works were act-drop designs for Her Majesty's Theatre in 1846 and for his friend Ben Webster's management of the new Adelphi in 1858. The only remaining fragment of his scenery (as opposed to his designs) is the centre of his Eddystone lighthouse act-drop for Wilkie Collins's <span class="italic">The Lighthouse</span> (1855; Dickens House Museum, London), one of the amateur productions that he later helped to decorate for Charles Dickens, whom he met through Macready in 1837 and of whom he became a close friend and companion for the rest of his life. He also painted scenes for Dickens's amateur productions of <span class="italic">Not so Bad as we Seem</span> (Bulwer-Lytton, 1851) and <span class="italic">The Frozen Deep</span> (Collins, 1857); his drawing of Dickens as Captain Bobadil in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Every Man in his Humour</span> (1845) is in the Garrick Club, London, of which he was a loyal member from its foundation in 1831. He provided illustrations for Dickens's &#145;Christmas Books&#146;&#151;<span class="italic">The Chimes</span> (1844), <span class="italic">The Cricket on the Hearth</span> (1845), <span class="italic">The Battle of Life</span> (1846), and <span class="italic">The Haunted Man</span> (1847)&#151;and for the popular edition of <span class="italic">American Notes</span> (1850); Dickens dedicated <span class="italic">Little Dorrit</span> to him on its completion in 1857. He also illustrated <span class="italic">The Pirate and the Three Cutters</span> (1836) and <span class="italic">Poor Jack</span> (1840) for Captain Marryat, another friend from about 1833; reports that they met in the navy are baseless. Other major literary editions for which he provided drawings were the works of George Crabbe (1834) and Boswell's <span class="italic">Life of Samuel Johnson</span> (1835, ed. J. W. Croker, rev. J. Wright), both published by John Murray, to whose production <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Life and Works of Lord Byron</span> (1833) he also contributed&#151;as he did, with others, to the Cadell &#145;Abbotsford&#146; edition of the <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels of Sir Walter Scott (12 vols., 1842&#150;7) and to his friend John Forster's <span class="italic">The Life and Adventures of Oliver Goldsmith</span> (1848).<h2>
<a name="Landscapepaintings"></a>Landscape paintings</h2>Stanfield's rise as a painter in oils and watercolours&#151;especially of works produced for topographical engraving&#151;developed in tandem with his reputation as a scene painter, despite some carping by reviewers about his theatre background and criticism of its influence on his easel style. In both areas he seems to have been largely self-taught, although he was advised by (and an admirer of) Alexander Nasmyth and John (&#145;Jock&#146;) Wilson, both also scene painters as well as being, respectively, landscape and marine painters. Ruskin, despite considering Stanfield too prosaic, called him &#145;the leader of the British Realists&#146; and, next to Turner, &#145;the noblest master of cloud forms of all our artists&#146;  (Ruskin, 1.119, 239). Although Thackeray praised his work as comprehensible, by contrast with Turner's &#145;mysticism and oracularity&#146;, Stanfield was a firm admirer of Turner and on good terms with him. Between 1820 and his last submission in 1867 he showed 135 paintings at the Royal Academy, his only absences being from 1822 to 1826, in 1828, and (owing to a tour) in 1839. However, his early success was associated more with the British Institution, whose &pound;50 premium he won for his large <span class="italic">Wreckers off Fort Rouge, Calais</span> in 1828 (engraved by J. P. Quilley, 1829), and the Society of British Artists, of which he was a foundation member from 1823, vice-president in 1828, and president in 1829; from 1820 to 1853 he showed twenty-two works at the former, and from 1824 to 1829 twenty-one at the latter. He resigned from the Society of British Artists in June 1830, when he failed to exhibit, and made a clear bid for membership of the Royal Academy by showing there instead his large view of St Michael's Mount, Cornwall (National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne). This impressed the new &#145;sailor king&#146;, William IV, who commissioned from Stanfield views of Portsmouth and Plymouth, the latter being changed to one of the royal opening of New London Bridge in 1831. Both (still in the Royal Collection) were exhibited in 1832, at the British Institution and the Royal Academy respectively. They ensured Stanfield's election as an associate of the Royal Academy in November 1832, after failure in the previous two years. He was elected Royal Academician in February 1835, six weeks after his stormy resignation from Drury Lane Theatre, and almost immediately served the first of four terms (1836&#150;7, 1844&#150;5, 1851&#150;2, 1860&#150;61) on the academy's council, on two occasions when others had declined to do so. In the first year of each term, and in 1852, he was also a member of the academy's hanging committee. In 1844, on the recommendation of Charles Eastlake, he was appointed the first curator of the Naval Gallery at Greenwich Hospital, to advise on acquisitions (all by gift) and the maintenance of the collection and the Painted Hall, at the honorarium of &pound;100 a year. He held the post until 1865 and, with Eastlake and Roberts, was on the <i>ad hoc</i> committee that chose 102 (out of 19,000) watercolours from their friend Turner's bequest for their first exhibition at Marlborough House, in February 1857. Stanfield also gave evidence, as a professional witness, to the parliamentary committees investigating art unions (1844) and the National Gallery &#145;cleaning controversy&#146; (1853).<h2>
<a name="BritishandEuropeantravels"></a>British and European travels</h2>While Stanfield's China voyage informed some of his stage designs it did not prompt any substantial easel work. From the 1820s onwards this was based on sketches from his travels in Britain and Europe and on his knowledge of the sea and ships, with results that Ruskin rather overpraised when he said that &#145;one work of Stanfield alone presents us with as much concentrated knowledge of sea and sky, as, diluted, would have lasted any one of the old masters his life&#146;  (Ruskin, 1.348). He may have briefly visited Calais in 1820 but his earliest tour, to the Low Countries and as far as Cologne, was in 1823. From July to September 1824 he accompanied the intrepid William Brockedon on the first of his journeys in the French, Swiss, and Italian Alps, a trip covered in Brockedon's <span class="italic">Journals of Excursions in the Alps</span> (1833), which was dedicated to Stanfield. In April 1825 he went up the Seine to Paris. In July 1828 he set out for the Netherlands and Germany, but became ill at Cassel, France, and recovered at Calais and Boulogne before going home in August. In the summer of 1829 he toured Devon and Cornwall. From late August to October 1830 he went, via the Netherlands, up the Rhine to Venice, returning through France, whose channel coast he revisited with his family in summer 1832. From mid-September to November 1837 he journeyed along the Meuse, the Moselle, and the Rhine, and from 28 August 1838 travelled through France and Switzerland to Milan, and thence, via Ancona, to Naples and its vicinity; he returned to England, on 17 March 1839, via Rome, Florence, and the Corniche. This time his companion was T. G. Fonnereau, an architectural enthusiast and former lawyer whom he may have met through John Murray. They got on well and Fonnereau dedicated his own small, privately printed volume of resulting sketches to Stanfield, who, having spent Christmas alone and delayed by storm on Ischia, was in Naples to witness an eruption of Vesuvius at new year 1839. Sketches of this survive (examples in the Tate collection, V&amp;A, and NL Scot.) but a painting commissioned in Rome by the duke of Buccleuch may not have materialized. The most notable picture from this tour is <span class="italic">Castello d' Ischia, from the Mole</span> (exh. RA, 1841; Sunderland Art Gallery), which was engraved for the Art Union. A pair of views, of Vietri and Amalfi, were purchased by Queen Victoria, who commissioned a third, of Ischia, in 1841 and a view of the royal yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i> off St Michael's Mount in 1846, the last two as gifts for Prince Albert (Royal Collection). In 1843 Stanfield was one of the artists commissioned to decorate the garden pavilion (dem. 1920) at Buckingham Palace with &#145;frescoes&#146; based on Milton's <span class="italic">Comus</span>.<br>
<br>Stanfield's first return to the north-east and Scotland was in autumn 1841; a west-country jaunt with Dickens, John Forster, and Daniel Maclise in autumn 1842 is well recorded in Dickens's letters. Later tours, of which few details survive, were to the Netherlands in 1843; Dorset (autumn 1844); south Wales (1848); and, with his wife and daughters, to the northern Pyrenees, via La Rochelle and Bordeaux, and along the Spanish coast to San Sebastian in the autumn of 1851. A visit to northern Ireland in 1856 was Stanfield's last tour out of England, although he and Roberts went to Edinburgh and its vicinity in 1858, where both were dined by the Royal Scottish Academy and Stanfield received his diploma as an honorary member (since 1830) and occasional exhibitor. In 1860, to mark their long association, Stanfield and Roberts jointly contributed the &pound;250 needed to build one of the houses for &#145;decayed actors&#146; in the new dramatic college at Maybury.<br>
<br>Stanfield's repertory mirrored his travels. Two impressive early works were <span class="italic">Market Boat on the Scheldt</span>, (exh. British Institution, 1826; V&amp;A) and <span class="italic">Cologne on the Rhine</span> (exh. Society of British Artists, 1826; Rheinisches Landesmuseum, Bonn). Thereafter French and Italian views dominate until <span class="italic">The Day after the Wreck</span> (exh. RA, 1844; Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield), showing a Dutch Indiaman aground in the Ooster Schelde, introduces the results of his tour of the Netherlands in 1843, following which further French, British, Spanish, and Irish subjects make up a balanced continuation of his exhibited work. Two of his most important early commissions were a group of ten Venetian and other Italian views for the former Adam dining-room at Bowood House, Wiltshire, for the third marquess of Lansdowne, which he delivered between 1833 and 1845, and another five for the duchess of Sutherland at Trentham, Staffordshire, begun in 1834. Both series were later dispersed, although <span class="italic">Venice from the Dogana</span> (exh. RA, 1833, where it was the reported focus of rivalry with Turner) is now again at Bowood, with other examples. The largest and one of the earliest of many marine set-pieces is the huge <span class="italic">Battle of Trafalgar</span> (exh. RA, 1836), commissioned by the United Services Club, Pall Mall, as a pendant to the earlier <span class="italic">Waterloo</span> by George Jones. Based in part on eyewitness accounts from club members, it is the best broadly realistic treatment of the subject. Though smaller, at 8 ft rather than 15 ft wide, <span class="italic">HMS &#145;The Victory&#146; Towed into Gibraltar &hellip; after the Battle of Trafalgar</span> (exh. RA, 1853; priv. coll.) is a more original variant on the Nelson theme, showing the dramatic composition, clarity, colour, and immediate surface effects that characterize Stanfield's best oil work and that appear to have made his stage scenery so impressive when viewed under gaslight. Ruskin admired the way that Stanfield could:<blockquote>carry a mighty wave up to the sky and &hellip; [make] its whole body dark against the distant light using &hellip; nothing more than chaste and unexaggerated colour to gain the relief. His surface is at once lustrous, transparent and accurate to a hair's breadth in every curve. (Ruskin, 1.348)</blockquote>Although it anticipates the picture the description is well applied to the small but fine <span class="italic">Dutch Dogger Carrying Away her Sprit</span>, known as &#145;On the Dogger bank&#146; (exh. RA, 1846; V&amp;A). An example of what Ruskin also called &#145;Stanfield's true salt, serviceable, unsentimental sea&#146;  (ibid., 1.120), this was one of three works that he sent in 1855 to the Universal Exhibition in Paris, where he was awarded a first-class gold medal. In 1862 he was also made a chevalier of the Belgian order of Leopold. His most original marine work, <span class="italic">The Abandoned</span> (exh. Universal Exhibition, Paris, 1855, and RA, 1856)&#151;a deserted hulk rolling on a frightening sea&#151;and one probably reflecting his religious anxieties and the recent deaths of his two eldest children, has been untraced since 1930 and is only directly known from a colotype taken when it was shown at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857.<br>
<br>Stanfield's dramatic mountain views were also impressive. <span class="italic">The Battle of Roveredo, 1796</span> (exh. RA, 1851), a scene in the Italian Alps, was one of several large works with a Napoleonic theme, while his <span class="italic">View of the Pic du Midi d'Ossau</span>, set in the Pyrenees (exh. RA, 1854) and painted, for 700 guineas, for Elhanan Bicknell&#151;one of his many mercantile or industrialist patrons&#151;is a vertiginously icy setting for the <i>contrabandistas</i> who populate its foreground (both now in the Royal Holloway collection, University of London).<br>
<br>Stanfield also had a large output of watercolours, many for topographical engraving, beginning with views for <span class="italic">London and its Vicinity</span> (1827), published by George Cooke, whose son Edward William Cooke helped Stanfield with sketches and became his principal follower as a marine painter. He illustrated Heath's <span class="italic">Picturesque Annual</span> for 1832 (scenes from Italy, the Tyrol, and the Rhine), 1833 (Belgium and the Netherlands), and 1834 (the channel coast of France), and in 1836 produced his own <span class="italic">Coast Scenery: Views in the British Channel</span> (published by Smith, Elder &amp; Co.), dedicated to William IV. His lithographed <span class="italic">Sketches on the Meuse, Rhine and Moselle</span> followed in 1838; he also contributed views that were lithographed in J. P. Lawson's <span class="italic">Scotland Delineated</span> (1847&#150;54) and to many other steel-engraved publications. His finished watercolours show the same picturesque qualities as his oils, but&#151;as Ruskin noted and criticized him for checking&#151;his rapid and less considered sketches, especially of sea and weather, often show &#145;powers and perceptions of a far higher order than &hellip; in his academy works&#146;  (Ruskin, 1.119). He was a regular visitor at several of the London <i>conversazioni</i>, and in March 1829, through his countryman G. F. Robson, was elected with C. R. Leslie to the convivial Sketching Society that from 1808 met weekly from October to May. Both of them, with Stanfield's son George and the Chalon brothers Alfred Edward and John James, were those present at its final meeting, in February 1851, after which it faded away, Stanfield having attended 446 times.<h2>
<a name="Lateryears"></a>Later years</h2>Stanfield's health worsened in the 1840s; his leg gave him recurrent pain, and in the later 1850s rheumatism or &#145;neuralgia&#146; sometimes kept him housebound and unable to paint or write. Having lived in Lambeth from 1819 to 1827 he moved into his friend William Etty's ground-floor rooms at 14 Buckingham Street, Strand, when Etty moved upstairs. From 1832 to 1839 he and his growing family took over George Cruikshank's former house&#151;36 Mornington Crescent, Camden Town&#151;and then moved to 48 Mornington Place until 1847. In 1840, under advice to seek cleaner air while illustrating <span class="italic">Poor Jack</span>, he rented Nyn Cottage, at Northaw, Hertfordshire, near Captain Marryat's brother Joseph (who was his banker). In 1846 he lodged at Hampstead for the same reason, and contemplated moving to Ramsgate, where he and Etty spent time with their Catholic friend A. W. N. Pugin. Instead he settled in a short, eighteenth-century terrace&#151;The Greenhill, Hampstead&#151;from 1847 to 1865. His house there (now Stanfield House and the sole survivor of the row) and 14 Buckingham Street bear plaques recording his residence. His last years were spent at 6 Belsize Park Road, where he died, after a week's illness, on 18 May 1867; he was buried on 27 May at Kensal Green Roman Catholic cemetery. Many obituaries reflected the esteem in which he was held, while granting that although his work was unpretentious, dramatic, skilled, and picturesque it was rarely of the highest aesthetic order. There was, however, general agreement on his achievement in raising theatre scene-painting standards, and thereby broad public taste in art, and a moving editorial tribute by Dickens in <span class="italic">All the Year Round</span> (1 June 1867) described him as &#145;the soul of frankness, generosity and simplicity. The most genial, the most affectionate &hellip; and the most lovable of men&#146;  (p. 537).<br>
<br>Though he became portly in middle life Stanfield in the 1820s was &#145;a tall and handsome young man of agreeable, if not of polished manners, liking and seeking company of an intellectual character&#146;  (Hall, 477). He was sociable, a listener rather than a speaker, and was widely liked for his straightforwardness and modesty, although friends learned to tread softly around his increasingly devout Catholicism. In this he was probably influenced by Etty (a high-churchman), certainly by Pugin, and by Abb&eacute; Morel, at Hampstead; he also knew, and was admired by, cardinals Wiseman and Manning, the latter a convert. Of recorded portraits of Stanfield the most notable are two by his friend John Simpson, of about 1829. One (exh. RA, 1829; engraved W. Say, 1834) is in the National Maritime Museum, the other still in the family's possession; a third, of about 1833 and attributed to Simpson, is in the National Portrait Gallery. A monumental bust by George Clarke of Birmingham (<i>c</i>.1829) is the most intriguing example of others now unlocated. Examples of Stanfield's paintings and drawings are held in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the Tate collection, London, Sunderland Museum and Art Gallery, and many other British public collections. Of his children with Rebecca Adcock the eldest, Henry James Field, died in 1838. The second, <a href="#cosubject_26235">George Clarkson [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was also a painter, as was a grandson, Joseph John Richard Bagshawe (1870&#150;1909; RBA, 1904), fifth son of Stanfield's elder daughter, Harriet (1837&#150;1911), and W. H. G. Bagshawe QC (1825&#150;1901), later a judge. Two other sons, Francis (1835&#150;1914) and Raymund (1841&#150;1918), became Catholic priests, the former being a notable hymnodist.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26235"></a><span class="headword">George Clarkson Stanfield</span>  (1828&#150;1878), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was the second son of Clarkson Stanfield and his second wife, Rebecca Adcock, and was born on 1 May 1828 at 14 Buckingham Street, Strand, London. He was largely trained by his father, to whom he was later a general assistant, and attended the Royal Academy Schools, though apparently not formally enrolled in them. He first exhibited at both the British Institution and the Royal Academy in 1844, when he was sixteen and his father was on the latter's hanging committee. He showed forty-nine works at the former until its closure, in 1867, and seventy-three at the academy up to 1876. As well as British subjects he painted landscapes based on visits to France, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, including river scenes and some coastal views. His style in oils is closely related to that of his father but characteristically more laboured, his bright landscapes often resembling coloured scale models. His success was limited, probably owing to changing taste after his father's death and to his derivative style, coupled with a suggestion of family improvidence and, finally, illness.<br>
<br>On 1 May 1854, at Leeds, Stanfield married his cousin Maria Field Blackburn, a daughter of his father's half-sister Maria (1802&#150;1858) and John William Blackburn, solicitor and coroner of Leeds. They lived at 42 Belsize Square, Hampstead, but it was in the house of his sister Harriet Bagshawe, 46 Belsize Square, that he died of liver disease at the age of forty-nine, on 22 March 1878. He was buried with his parents at Kensal Green. The probate value of his estate, left to his wife, was less than &pound;300. His five sons all emigrated in early adulthood, one to Canada and four to Australia; another had died as an infant in 1858; the couple also had two daughters. His wife died at Ramsgate, Kent, on 17 April 1884, aged fifty-one.<br>
