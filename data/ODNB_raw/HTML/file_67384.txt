<span class="headword">Row,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1666&#150;1702), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was admitted to the Merchant Venturers of Bristol on 15 October 1666 and became the city's sword-bearer in 1677, a position that gave him a prominent role in civic ceremony and access to influential people. Almost nothing is known of his background. In January 1680 the privy council issued a warrant for the arrest of Row and the Bristol clothier Joseph Tiley on charges of spreading seditious news in Bristol, but in the absence of witnesses they were released after posting bonds for good behaviour. In October 1680 Row accused the aldermen Sir Robert Canne and Sir Robert Yeamans (the former also one of Bristol's MPs) of denying the Popish Plot while insisting on a presbyterian conspiracy. Sir John Knight the elder, formerly mayor of Bristol (1663&#150;4), and the city's other MP, corroborated Row's charge in the House of Commons, where Row testified at the bar. Both men, Row insisted, were tools of the marquess of Worcester, a staunch royalist who had previously had Row hauled before the privy council for his remarks in Bristol. Canne was briefly imprisoned and expelled from the house, whereas Yeamans apologized and was fined. In May 1681 the Bristol council dismissed Row as sword-bearer on the grounds that he had reproached several persons of quality and had refused to return from London when summoned, but he regained his office by a writ of mandamus. The council again ousted him in January 1682, though he apparently recovered his office. His business dealings must have taken him to London rather frequently, for he was a member of both the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92786', "Green Ribbon Club")</script> in London and Bristol's Horseshoe (formerly the White Hart) Club, as were Tiley and Colonel John Rumsey.<br>
<br>By the autumn of 1682 Row had become involved in a plot to assassinate the king and was meeting with several of its principal architects, Robert West, Robert Ferguson, Richard Goodenough, and Rumsey. Tiley was also engaged. Rumsey had apparently recruited Row, to whom he gave money and clothing for two years, and with whom he dined regularly until Christmas 1682, though Rumsey would subsequently insist he first learned of the conspiracy from Row. West would later confess that in the autumn of 1682 Row boasted that he and his friends had 500 men prepared to ride into Bristol in an uprising, but Row was prone to exaggeration. Row subsequently claimed to have seen a letter in canting language from West or Nathaniel Wade discussing the assassination of Charles and James. With John Gibbons, Monmouth's footman, Row reconnoitred Covent Garden as a possible site for the assassination. Row would later claim Monmouth knew of the plot in the spring of 1683.<br>
<br>Following Josiah Keeling's disclosure of the plotting and Rumsey's arrest (24 June 1683), several conspirators wanted to drown Row to prevent him from confessing, or so he thought. Sir John Trenchard, with whom he had discussed the assassination scheme, insisted he flee to the continent, giving him &pound;50 and a horse on which to escape. Twice more he was threatened with death by his fellow conspirators: the first time by Sir Thomas Armstrong at Cleves and the second by Captain John Matthews, Trenchard's aide. When Row threatened to inform unless he received additional money, Wade, Ferguson, and Richard Nelthorp acquiesced. For a time Row stayed with Edmund Ludlow at Vevey, Switzerland. In the meantime the government, having three witnesses, indicted him on 12 July. The Merchant Venturers consequently disenfranchised him on 15 October 1683; for speaking derogatorily of royalists in Bristol, he had again been dismissed as sword-bearer on 31 May 1683. During the planning for the Monmouth invasion, Row, as he subsequently attested, claimed hundreds of Swiss officers and gentry were prepared to enlist and equip 10,000 Swiss soldiers if Ludlow would command them, but Ferguson, Wade, and others allegedly declined on the grounds that such help was unnecessary; Row was undoubtedly fabricating. The following year he and three others claimed they had &pound;12,000 to invest in the cloth manufactory sponsored by the exiles and the Dutch at Leeuwarden, but this too must have been a lie.<br>
<br>Row returned to England in November 1688, or so he asserted. His claim may be valid, for on 28 August 1689, following his petition eight days earlier, he was appointed king's waiter at the port of Bristol and given a salary of &pound;15 p.a. By December 1690 he had detected custom fraud involving tobacco importers who had cheated the government of &pound;5000&#150;6000 in the past year alone. He unsuccessfully petitioned for the surveyorship of the port of Bristol as his reward. The merchants settled for &pound;2772 the following May, of which Row received &pound;263 16<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for his role. On 18 April 1691 he had demanded the restoration of his membership in the Merchant Venturers, but his request was denied. So too was his attempt to regain his office of sword-bearer in Michaelmas term 1691; he sued and eventually received &pound;100 in compensation (1695). In July 1692 Row was suspended as king's waiter after his wife accepted a bribe of &pound;10 to persuade him not to inform against a merchant who had imported cocoa nuts in the guise of indigo. A penitent Row petitioned for restoration, which was granted on 1 March 1693. On 30 June 1702, one Maurice Houston was appointed queen's waiter in Row's place, but Houston's letters patent were superseded on 3 July. By this time Row was presumably too infirm to continue his duties or had died.<br>
