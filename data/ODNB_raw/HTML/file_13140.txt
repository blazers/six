<span class="headword">Heugh,  Hugh</span>  (1782&#150;1846), <span class="occ">United Secession church minister</span>, was born in Stirling on 12 August 1782, the ninth of ten children of John Heugh (1731&#150;1810) and his wife, Anne Ross (<i>d</i>. 1807), and grandson of John Heugh (1688&#150;1731), parish minister of Kingoldrum, Forfarshire. His father was minister of the Viewfield church in Stirling, an Anti-Burgher congregation. Heugh attended Stirling grammar school and Edinburgh University, before entering the Divinity Hall of the General Associate Synod at Whitburn in 1799. He spent the session of 1800&#150;01 at Anderson's Institution, Glasgow. He was licensed by the General Associate Presbytery of Stirling on 22 February 1804. Calls were received from congregations at Greenloaning, Perthshire, and Hawick, Roxburghshire, but the synod were disposed to accept that which took him to Stirling, where he was ordained as colleague to his aged father on 14 August 1806. He married, on 21 June 1809, Isabella Clarkson (<i>d</i>. 1877), the daughter of an Anti-Burgher minister, with whom he had five daughters and two sons.<br>
<br>Heugh became an influential figure in his church and was moderator of the General Associate Synod in 1819, the last before the two main bodies of seceders merged to form the United Secession church. In 1821 he was called, for the third time, to a congregation at Regent Place, Glasgow. He was loath to leave his native Stirling, and it was only by the narrowest majority that the synod preferred the call to Regent Place, to which he was inducted on 9 October 1821. In addition to an active pastoral ministry, Heugh engaged in many of the public questions and controversies of the day. He swiftly became involved in arguing the case against church establishments in the voluntary controversy, and when his own denomination became agitated over the question of the atonement he issued a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Irenicum</span> (1845), which sought to conciliate the warring factions. While his sympathies naturally lay with the church's professor, John Brown, who was his personal friend, his action was characteristic of a man who, while he did not shrink from controversy, deplored the personal rancour which accompanied it. Among his other publications were <span class="italic">The Importance of Early Piety</span> (1826), <span class="italic">Considerations on Civil Establishments of Religion</span> (1833), and <span class="italic">Notices on the State of Religion in Geneva and Belgium</span> (1844). Heugh was also a keen advocate of home and foreign missions, and he was awarded the degree of DD by the college of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1831.<br>
<br>From 1837 Heugh's health gave cause for concern, and a trip to Geneva in 1843 was one of a number of recuperative journeys he undertook. His health finally gave way, and he died at his home, 126 Montrose Street, Glasgow, on 10 June 1846, and was buried in Glasgow necropolis on 16 June.<br>
