<span class="headword">Ramsay <span class="st"> [Ramsey]</span>,  David</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1642), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was born in Scotland, one of the nine children of Robert Ramsay of Wyliecleuch, Berwickshire, known as Sir Robert Ramsay. David Ramsay was kinsman to the Ramsays, earls of Dalhousie, and to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23091/', "John Ramsay, Viscount Haddington and earl of Holdernesse (c.1580&#150;1626)")</script>. His brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23084/', "Sir James Ramsay (1589?&#150;1638/9)")</script>, groom of the bedchamber to Prince Henry and later a soldier in Swedish service, and George Ramsay, intruded by James I into a fellowship at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1612. David Ramsay was also a beneficiary of royal favour. On 19 June 1604 a warrant was issued for the payment to David Ramsay of &pound;26 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. for a livery as groom of the bedchamber to Prince Henry. He is probably the &#145;Ramsey&#146; reported by John Chamberlain to have been in the company of Prince Henry in March 1612. On 18 November 1613, following the death of the prince, he was awarded a pension of &pound;200 per annum for his service as a groom.<br>
<br>In 1631 Donald Mackay, first Lord Reay, charged privately that Ramsay, unhappy with recent religious developments in England, had that spring sought Swedish support for a scheme to alter the frame of government by means of an army entrusted for use in the Thirty Years' War to James Hamilton, marquess of Hamilton. When this allegation became known, Ramsay challenged Reay to a duel, but then appears to have withdrawn his challenge. A difficulty for Reay was that his charge involved admitting to involvement in the plot, but it seems there was some truth in his allegations. Certainly Ramsay, who was in the Netherlands at the time alleged, had been fishing in dangerous waters, and seems to have been completely lacking in diplomatic skills. After the trial, in August 1632, Hamilton received from a servant in the Netherlands some frank advice to the effect that:<blockquote>you will do yourself much right to provide some place for David Ramsay with the King of Sweden for he hath disobliged so many great men here and the King himself is so displeased with his behaviour that he is utterly lost in this place.</blockquote>On 20 November 1631 Sir Thomas Roe had written from London to Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, who had asked for information on the affair, that Ramsay had mentioned her name in connection with it, and was &#145;not a man on whose discretion to rely, being much transported by self-opinion&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>addenda</i>, <i>1625&#150;49</i>, 421).<br>
<br>Given the seriousness of the issues, and the implications for Hamilton, the matter could not be ignored, but it was decided to hear them not in Star Chamber but in the court of chivalry. The case opened on Monday 28 November 1631 at the Painted Chamber in Westminster, before Robert, earl of Lindsay, lord high constable, and in the presence of the earl of Pembroke, the earl of Arundel, the earl of Dorset, and others. The dramatic case had taken on the appearance of a public spectacle; on 5 December &#145;the fame of the cause brought thither such a crowd of people as was not imaginable&#146; and Ramsay appeared at each of the sessions in a new and expensive costume  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 3.489). Progress in the trial was hampered by procedural wrangling over whether the several facts at issue were matters of honour or of treason, and over the respective roles in the case of judicial combat and the court's determination of the facts. When the facts proved impossible to establish with certainty, the court set the duel for 12 April, and issued instructions for the type and dimensions of the weapons to be used. Sir William Calley's son rode to London especially to see the contest, to be held at Tothill Fields. But he, and many others, were disappointed.<br>
<br>On 10 April the contest was deferred by the king until 17 May; on 12 May Lindsay announced a verdict: &#145;they had not found David Ramsey guilty of treason &hellip; yet they found that he had seditiously committed many contempts against his majesty, the reformation of which his majesty reserved to himself&#146;. Ramsay and Reay were both committed to the Tower of London until they promised not to &#145;attempt any thing one against the other&#146;. The king's direct influence is clear. He had &#145;revoked his letters patents, given to the said lords for the trial of this cause, not willing to have it decided by duel&#146;, and the official verdict in respect of Ramsay reads very like Charles's own conclusion, sent to James Hamilton and dated 8 May, four days earlier:<blockquote>And for David Ramsey, though we must clear him of that treason in particular, yet not so far in the general, but that he might give occasion enough by his tongue of great accusation, if it had been rightly placed, as by his foolish presumptious carriage did appear;</blockquote>and Charles was determined:<blockquote>that you may know David Ramsey, that you may not have to do with such a pest as he is, suspecting he may seek to insinuate himself to you upon this occasion. Wherefore I must desire you, as you love me, to have nothing to do with him. (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 3.513&#150;14)</blockquote>Despite this devastating judgment upon his character, Ramsay remained a recipient of royal largess. He was still a groom of the privy chamber when in the late summer of 1633, in an effort to rehabilitate himself, he passed to the king information about Jesuits and other recusants then active in London, which was forwarded to the commissioners for recusants. It seems from a petition of 1643 on behalf of Fabian Phillips that Ramsay had been able to acquire an interest in the office of filazer, and that having &#145;had formerly a reversion of the same by letters patent&#146; he had farmed it to Phillips in January 1640  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1643</i>, 471). When he made his will on 13 May 1642 he was living in the fashionable new district of Covent Garden, and was able to dispose of considerable legacies, to his sister Agnes, his niece Barbara Forrett, his nephew David Forrett, and to Patrick Shawe, husband of his sister Barbara. Other beneficiaries included James Maxwell, usher of the black rod, and the patentee and army officer Sir John Meldrum, to whom he left &pound;100 apiece and who, along with his nephew, he appointed his executors, though only the last was able to appear to prove the will on 3 August 1642.<br>
