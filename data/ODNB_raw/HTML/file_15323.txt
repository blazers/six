<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kemble <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>De Camp]</span>,  Maria Theresa</span>  (1777&#150;1838), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born in Vienna on 17 January 1777, the eldest of the six children of George Lewis De Camp, a musician, and his wife, Jeanne Adrienne Dufour, a dancer. She was brought to England as a child, and at the age of eight appeared at the King's Theatre as Cupid in a ballet of Noverre. After playing in a theatre directed by M. Le Texier Z&eacute;lie in a translation of Madame de Genlis's <span class="italic">La Colombe</span>, she was engaged to dance for the Royal Circus. On the alleged recommendation of the prince of Wales she was subsequently engaged by Colman for the Haymarket, where she appeared in a ballet entitled <span class="italic">Jamie's Return</span>. She was then secured for Drury Lane, where, as Miss De Camp, on 24 October 1786, she played Julie in Burgoyne's <span class="italic">Richard Coeur de Lion</span>. She remained there for the following five seasons, performing in speciality dances and other small parts, though she also appeared at the Haymarket during the summers. Her father, who died in Germany in 1787, had taught her no English, and the few words she spoke were acquired by imitation. According to the <span class="italic">Biographia dramatica</span>, reading, writing, and arithmetic were taught her by Viscountess Perceval, and music and Italian by a Miss Buchanan.<br>
<br>Maria Theresa first attracted public attention on 15 August 1792 at the Haymarket, when, in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, she performed Macheath to John Bannister's Polly, in one of the experiments of changing the sex of the exponents then in vogue at that theatre. Biddy in <span class="italic">Miss in her Teens</span>, Adelaide in <span class="italic">The Count of Narbonne</span>, and Gillian in <span class="italic">The Quaker</span> were then assigned her; and she also played some original parts, including Lindamira in Cumberland's <span class="italic">Box Lobby Challenge</span>, Judith in <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span>, and Irene in <span class="italic">Blue Beard</span>. In singing parts she was allowed at times to replace Anna Storace and Anna Maria Crouch, and was considered a pleasing vocalist. She continued performing at Drury Lane in the winters, but did not appear at the Haymarket after 1800, travelling instead to theatres in Birmingham, York, Edinburgh, and other towns. In 1795 she received a public apology in the newspapers from her London manager, John Kemble, for his attempt to rape her behind the scenes. Rescued by her theatrical colleagues, De Camp was vindicated in the press and by Kemble himself, who acknowledged her character to be irreproachable.<br>
<br>For her benefit, on 3 May 1799, De Camp gave at Drury Lane her own unpublished play <span class="italic">First Faults</span>. In the same year William Earle jun. printed in octavo a poor piece called <span class="italic">Natural Faults</span>, and accused De Camp in the preface of having stolen his plot and characters. In a letter to the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, dated 10 June 1799, she positively denied the charge, and asserted that her play was copied by Earle from recitation. In <span class="italic">Some Account of the English Stage</span>, Genest observed that Earle's statement &#145;has the <i>appearance</i> of truth&#146;.<br>
<br>After a lengthy courtship, and some delay given the disapproval of his family, Maria Theresa De Camp married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15316/', "Charles Kemble (1775&#150;1854)")</script> on 2 July 1806 at St George's, Bloomsbury. She then accompanied him, and the rest of the Kemble clan, to Covent Garden, where she made her first appearance as Maria in <span class="italic">The Citizen</span>; she remained there for the rest of her acting career. During the years that followed, she wrote three additional comedies, and performed in them for either her own or her husband's benefits. Only <span class="italic">The Day after the Wedding, or, A Wife's First Lesson</span> and <span class="italic">Smiles and Tears, or, The Widow's Stratagem</span> were printed, but critical comment about these and her other works was gentle. Genest described the latter's comic scenes as good, but thought &#145;the serious scenes &hellip; rather disgusting than pleasing&#146;. Among the parts assigned to her were Ophelia, Violante in <span class="italic">The Wonder</span>, Beatrice in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>, and Mrs Ford in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>. An admirable actress of chambermaids, she was also excellent as Mrs Oakley and Lucy Lockit. She was good-looking, intelligent, and so industrious that she was said in her early life to have almost lived at Drury Lane. A writer for <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> (April 1832) spoke of her as &#145;a delightful dark-eyed, dark-haired girl, whose motion was itself music ere her voice was heard&#146;, and commented on her remarkable charm.<br>
<br>Mrs Kemble performed rarely after 1814&#150;15, but did not officially retire until she played Lady Julia in <span class="italic">Personation</span> (9 June 1819). A single reappearance was made at Covent Garden as Lady Capulet on the d&eacute;but of her daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15318/', "Fanny Kemble")</script> as Juliet, on 5 October 1829. Maria Theresa Kemble died at Addlestone, near Chertsey, Surrey, on 3 September 1838. She was survived by her husband and their four surviving children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15321/', "John Mitchell Kemble")</script>, Henry Vincent James Kemble (1812&#150;1857), Fanny, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15315/', "Adelaide Kemble")</script>.<br>
