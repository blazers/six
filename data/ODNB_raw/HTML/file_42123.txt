<span class="headword">Traill <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Strickland]</span>,  Catharine Parr</span>  (1802&#150;1899), <span class="occ">author, botanist, and settler in Canada</span>, the fifth of the eight surviving children of Thomas Strickland (1758&#150;1818) and his wife, Elizabeth Homer (1772&#150;1864), was born at Rotherhithe, London, on 9 January 1802. She was named after Henry VIII's sixth wife, with whom the family (wrongly) claimed a connection. Shortly after her birth the family moved to East Anglia, where Thomas Strickland began his own business, living in Norwich and then at Stowe Hall, near Bungay. In 1808 he bought Reydon Hall, near Southwold in Suffolk, where Catharine was largely brought up. Socially isolated and educated at home, the Stricklands were a close-knit and affectionate family. Catharine's education was a liberal one, covering subjects including history, geography, botany, the natural sciences, and several languages; she was encouraged to read widely and independently. Practically all the Stricklands had a literary turn&#151;her elder sisters <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26663/', "Agnes Strickland")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41157/', "Elizabeth Strickland")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26663/', "Strickland, Agnes (1796&#150;1874)")</script>] later became the well-known authors of <span class="italic">The Lives of the Queens of England</span> (1840&#150;48)&#151;but Catharine was the first of the siblings to have a manuscript published: <span class="italic">The Tell-Tale: an Original Collection of Moral and Amusing Stories</span> (1818). Over the next fourteen years she published some fifteen or more books for children, often works of didactic fiction, such as <span class="italic">Prejudice Reproved, or, The History of a Negro Toy-Seller</span> (1826), or reflecting her geographical or botanical interests, such as <span class="italic">The Young Emigrants, or, Pictures of Canada</span> (1826) and <span class="italic">Sketches from Nature, or, Hints to Juvenile Naturalists</span> (1830). She also contributed to annuals and periodicals.<br>
<br>About 1829 Catharine Parr Strickland became engaged to Francis Harral, the son of an editor of Suffolk newspapers. When the engagement was broken off in 1831 she went to London to recover: there she and her sister Susanna met their future husbands, both of whom were officers in the 21st Scottish fusiliers. She married Thomas Traill, an Orkney-born widower with two sons, on 13 May 1832 at Reydon; soon after, on 7 July 1832, she and her husband emigrated to Canada, sailing from Greenock. They settled on the River Otonabee, near Catharine's brother Samuel, who had emigrated in 1825, and in 1834 Catharine's sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19083/', "Susanna Moodie")</script> and her husband, who were also emigrants, came to live near them. Later the Traills lived at Ashburnham, near Peterborough, and on the south shore of Rice Lake, both in the same region of Upper Canada, always in some financial difficulty and dependent on help from family and friends.<br>
<br>The difficulties and discomforts of a settler's life, exacerbated by her husband's periodic fits of depression and commercial failure, made Mrs Traill's life a hard one: however, the struggle for subsistence, the birth of nine children in fourteen years, and the constant need to earn extra income by writing do not seem to have dimmed her innate optimism and ability to enjoy the small delights of everyday life. She wrote for English and Montreal journals, and in 1836 <span class="italic">The Backwoods of Canada</span> was published by the London publisher Charles Knight; it was a collection of her lively letters home to her family, detailing the journey to Canada, the seasons, sights, flora, and fauna of her new country, and the day-to-day activities of a newly arrived settler. In 1852 she published <span class="italic">Canadian Crusoes: a Tale of the Rice Lake Plains</span>, again with a London publisher. The tale of three children lost from home for three years, it was at once an adventure story, a piece of contemporary wisdom literature, and a practical survival guide for the Canadian backwoods. The more mundane accounts of how to dig a root-house and to harvest seasonal fruits were enlivened by such events as a forest fire, the adoption by the party of an outcast Indian girl, and the kidnap of one of their number by Indians. It was well reviewed and the 1852 American edition went through at least nine impressions; it was reprinted as late as 1923 as a commercial concern, and remains one of the founding works of Canadian children's literature.<br>
<br>In 1854 Mrs Traill published <span class="italic">The Female Emigrant's Guide, and Hints on Canadian Housekeeping</span>, republished as <span class="italic">The Canadian Settler's Guide</span> from 1855 on. This work was intended to offer advice to lower-class women (and, indeed, men) on a variety of topics, such as what to bring with them to Canada, how to build a log-house, and what to plant in a vegetable garden. Recipes for apple puddings and bread jostled with government statistics on numbers of settlers and the cost of fares for passages to Canada. In 1856 Mrs Traill published <span class="italic">Lady Mary and her Nurse, or, A Peep into the Canadian Forest</span> in London; in Canada it had already appeared in serial form.<br>
<br>On 26 August 1857 the Traills' home, Oaklands, on Rice Lake, was burnt down; the family lived with a friend, Frances Stewart, for the next two years. Catharine Parr Traill's notes on Canadian wild flowers were among the few items saved from the fire. She attempted to earn money by writing, needlework, and producing albums of pressed flowers and ferns, but her financial difficulties were increased by the death of her husband on 21 June 1859. A grant from the British government of &pound;100&#151;achieved through the influence of Lady Charlotte Greville, who was impressed by one of Mrs Traill's albums&#151;and the help of her family finally enabled her to buy Westove, in Lakefield, in 1860. There she lived for the rest of her life with her devoted daughter Kate.<br>
<br>Mrs Traill's later publications brought to fruition her lifelong interest in botany. In 1868 she published <span class="italic">Canadian Wild Flowers</span>, which was illustrated by her niece Agnes Dunbar Fitzgibbon, who also illustrated her <span class="italic">Studies in Plant Life in Canada</span>, which appeared in 1885. These publications were too late to earn Mrs Traill the place she deserved in the history of Canadian botany, which had evolved from the Paleyite perspective and emphasis on gathering and classifying species which characterized her botanical researches. But the charm and detailed observations of her essays in <span class="italic">Pearls and Pebbles, or, Notes of an Old Naturalist</span> (1894) show that she was no unworthy disciple of Gilbert White, whose <span class="italic">Natural History and Antiquities of Selbourne</span> (1789) had been her model for <span class="italic">Plant Life</span>. Mrs Traill's last publication was <span class="italic">Cot and Cradle Stories</span> (1895).<br>
<br>Catharine Parr Traill had an attractive personality, gentle and humorous, and formed many close friendships, particularly with other women, in her Canadian life. A visitor in 1853 described her appearance and manner: &#145;a pleasant enough woman, stout with a slightly blue tinge but very frank and made no secret of their having had a great struggle for the bare necessities&#146;  (<span class="italic">Selected Correspondence</span>, 24). In her later years Mrs Traill received several honours, including, at her own request, the grant of Polly Cow Island in the River Otonabee. A fern was named after her. She died at her home, Westove, on 29 August 1899, and was buried in the cemetery at Lakefield on 31 August.<br>
<br>Catharine Parr Traill's significant role in the development of a Canadian pioneer literature&#151;intent on exploration and discovery, naming and taming the New World&#151;has long been recognized, although her reputation has sometimes been overshadowed by that of her sister Susanna Moodie. The efforts of scholars such as Carl Ballstadt, Clara Thomas, and Michael A. Peterman have succeeded in rescuing Mrs Traill from Northrop Frye's characterization of her as a Wordsworthian sentimentalist. But the essential optimism and equanimity of her outlook on life and her surroundings still provoke criticism from those more impressed by Moodie's more dramatic and complicated reaction to the settler experience. Recent critics such as Marion Fowler and Gaile McGregor have argued that she tended to take refuge from the trials of her Canadian experience in an unconvincingly cheerful and ladylike domesticity. However, Mrs Traill's desire to cultivate a civilized way of life in the Canadian backwoods illustrates her adaptability and resourcefulness at least as much as her conventionality, and does not mean that she underrated either the difficulties or the unexpected pleasures of settlement life. Modern readers may find her proselytizing piety occasionally tiresome, but Catharine Parr Traill's clarity of style and openness to new experiences and natural phenomena ensure that her varied works will continue to retain their appeal and interest.<br>
