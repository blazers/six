<span class="headword">Davie,  Thomas Benjamin</span>  (1895&#150;1955), <span class="occ">pathologist and university principal</span>, was born on 23 November 1895 at Prieska, Cape Colony, the fifth of the six children of Thomas Benjamin Davie, law agent and auctioneer, and his first wife, Caroline Charlotte Halliday (<i>d</i>. 1900). With Scottish ancestry on both sides, Davie spoke English at home but, after attending Prieska junior school from about 1901 to 1906, had an Afrikaans education at Paarl Boys' High School and Victoria College, Stellenbosch, Cape of Good Hope. At Stellenbosch he attained a BA in chemistry (1914) and a teachers' certificate (with distinction, 1916). His subsequent career as a secondary school science teacher in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal was interrupted by two years' training in Britain as a Royal Flying Corps pilot during the First World War. As an army volunteer suppressing labour militancy in Johannesburg during the Rand Revolt of 1922, he sustained a serious injury and, during a long hospital bound recuperation, he decided to give up schoolteaching for medicine. The previous year he had married Vera Catherine Roper (1893&#150;1976), daughter of Thomas Roper, a Wesleyan minister; they had one daughter who died in infancy.<br>
<br>Like a number of young South Africans before him, Davie chose Liverpool University for his medical studies. Enrolling as a 28-year-old, his commitment, intellectual ability, and relative maturity soon won him many distinctions, as well as the ready confidence of patients. He graduated MB ChB (1928) and MD (1931). He received his MRCP in 1931, the same year that he became pathologist to the Walton Hospital, Liverpool. Thus did Davie begin his career in pathology, which culminated in chairs at Bristol University (1935&#150;8) and Liverpool University (the George Holt chair of pathology, 1938&#150;45, and the chair of applied pathology, 1945&#150;7). During this time he co-authored a standard pathology textbook with his mentor at Liverpool, Professor J. H. Dible, entitled <span class="italic">Pathology: an Introduction to Medicine and Surgery</span> (1939), and published a number of articles on the pathology of various diseases and on the storage of blood for transfusion. His view of pathology as the &#145;grammar of medicine and surgery&#146;, a process which was the subject of living, rather than morbid, anatomy, informed his emphasis on clinical training and research.<br>
<br>A gifted and popular teacher, Davie also showed particular aptitude for organization and administration at Bristol and Liverpool, where he reorganized the pathology departments and fostered greater contact between them and local hospitals. During the Second World War he worked tirelessly to improve blood transfusion and clinical pathology services for the Ministry of Health, notably establishing the first blood bank at Liverpool in 1939. He was elected FRCP in 1940. As the first full-time dean of the medical faculty at Liverpool (1945&#150;7), he worked on post-war reorganization and expansion within the faculty. His qualities as a tactful and outstanding administrator secured his appointment as principal and vice-chancellor at the University of Cape Town in March 1948. Acute rheumatoid arthritis and other medical problems, which began to manifest themselves shortly after his return to South Africa, hampered Davie's work. Nevertheless, he applied himself energetically to the development of the university, which had been hindered by the war. Davie fostered academic and commercial contacts, raising money to expand research and teaching, initiated a scheme whereby the medical school staff became part-time employees of provincial hospitals too, and encouraged the establishment of new, interdisciplinary departments. In a broader sphere, he was instrumental in creating the South African Committee of University Principals.<br>
<br>The issue which loomed largest in Davie's principalship was, however, an attempt by the newly elected National Party government to bar black students from the few &#145;open&#146; universities which admitted them. Davie opposed this, initially because he objected to state intervention in university policy per se and later from a broader philosophical position which defined true universities as necessarily open to all&#151;they had to make available &#145;the whole of knowledge to every one who can benefit by it&#146;. In doing this, Davie hoped that universities would encourage better relations between English, Afrikaans, and black South Africans by fostering &#145;that toleration to ideas which characterizes the really educated man&#146;. He led the opposition to university apartheid by the &#145;open&#146; universities, a campaign which was ultimately unsuccessful: the Nationalist government passed legislation in 1959 to bar black students from entering these universities.<br>
<br>By 1955, seriously ill yet determined as ever not to yield to adversity, Davie travelled to England to represent his university and receive honorary doctorates from Oxford and Liverpool universities. This opportunity did not arise, however, as he died in London on the night of 13/14 December 1955. His body was cremated at Golders Green crematorium, Middlesex. He was survived by his wife. Before path-breaking cortisone treatment for his illness swelled his features, he had been a tall, distinguished looking man who was dynamic, genial, and approachable. He inspired affection, loyalty, and admiration: as a contemporary observed, &#145;One always felt that life was good when one was in his company.&#146; Davie is remembered today chiefly for his role in defining and upholding the ideal of academic freedom, the freedom for institutions to decide &#145;who shall teach, what we teach, how we teach and whom we teach&#146;. This vital contribution has been commemorated in an annual T. B. Davie memorial lecture at the University of Cape Town since 1959 which reaffirms the university's commitment to the principle of academic freedom.<br>
