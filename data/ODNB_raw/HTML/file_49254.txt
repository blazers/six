<span class="headword">Kydd,  Samuel McGowan</span>  (1815&#150;1892), <span class="occ">Chartist and barrister</span>, was born on 22 February 1815 in Arbroath, Forfarshire, the second son of James Kydd, a currier. He first came to public attention in 1837 in York when he issued a pamphlet which contributed to a national debate about joint-stock banks; his arguments that such banks should issue paper money were an early indication of a deep interest in financial and economic matters. Kydd's circumstances had dramatically changed by the early 1840s when he featured in the Chartist press as a Glasgow shoemaker. He was soon in demand as a Chartist lecturer. Throughout the north of England in 1843&#150;4 he sought to refute the arguments of the Complete Suffrage Union and the Anti-Corn Law League. Having established himself as Chartism's most persuasive protectionist lecturer, Kydd relocated to London. As secretary of the Chartist executive in 1848&#150;9 he was at the centre of the movement's activities. Unlike other executive members he managed to escape arrest, and, without going to the official polls, was twice (in Greenwich in 1847 and the West Riding in 1848) a Chartist parliamentary candidate. During these years Kydd continued to undertake extensive lecture tours, especially in the north and in Scotland. On 18 February 1850 he married Mary Ann Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1898), daughter of Joseph Appleford.<br>
<br>Though greatly liked and respected by the Chartist rank and file, Kydd decided to realign himself. By 1850 he was a close associate of Richard Oastler and a fully fledged tory radical, arguing in his lectures and journal articles for factory reform and the reintroduction of tariffs. He became Oastler's secretary, and, using the memorabilia he now had access to, produced, under the pseudonym Alfred, a <span class="italic">History of the Factory Movement</span> (1857); it remains a valuable document for students of the subject. Kydd had long desired to enter the legal profession. In 1858 he was admitted to Gray's Inn, and in 1861 was called to the bar. Kydd lived during the second part of his life with his wife in Sutton, Surrey, and operated from chambers in the Middle Temple. Until the late 1880s he practised on the northern circuit and appeared at the York assizes. Shortly before his death he published <span class="italic">A Sketch of the Growth of Public Opinion</span> (1888). A man of outstanding ability, Samuel Kydd died at his home, Holly Cottage, Sutton, on 21 December 1892. He left no children.<br>
