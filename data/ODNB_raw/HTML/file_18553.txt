<span class="headword">Mendes,  Fernando Moses</span>  (1647&#150;1724), <span class="occ">physician and entrepreneur</span>, was born at Trancoso, Beira Alta, Portugal, into a wealthy family of New Christian merchants and officials. He was one of the ten children of Ant&oacute;nio Jacob Mendes da Costa (<i>d</i>. 1716), a merchant, and Joana, <i>n&eacute;e</i> da Silva, who fled to France in the 1650s or early 1660s for fear of the Inquisition, and settled temporarily in Rouen. Alvaro da Costa was Fernando's cousin. Fernando (originally Fern&atilde;o) studied medicine, registering at the University of Montpellier on 27 July 1666; he was awarded his doctorate on 11 January 1668. He specifically stated (incorrectly) that he was from Trancoso in &#145;Castille&#146;, to avoid admitting that he was Portuguese, a term which in the France of the day was virtually synonymous with &#145;Jew&#146;. No Jew could enter a French university. He was &#145;consiliarius&#146;, one of four senior students in medicine elected by the professors as heads of the student body. His thesis was published in Lyons later in 1668, prefaced by his portrait, that of a handsome gentleman in a periwig, with a thin moustache. It is dedicated to Dom Francisco de Mello, the poet and diplomat who accompanied Catherine of Braganza to England in 1662 and was later ambassador to the Netherlands, France, and England.<br>
<br>Mendes's family was by now in London, where he joined them on 25 October 1669. Publicly, at least, Mendes remained a Roman Catholic, although in 1675 he married a professing Jew, Isabel Rachel Marques (<i>d</i>. 1695) with whom he had six children. His elder daughter, Catherine Rachel (<i>c</i>.1678&#150;1756) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/72024/', "Costa, Catherine da")</script>], is said to have been the queen's god-daughter and was the first Anglo-Jewish portraitist. She married Alvaro's son, Anthony Moses da Costa. Mendes's sons were all wealthy merchants or stockbrokers. One, James Mendes, was the father of Moses Mendes, the dramatist. Mendes's wife was one of the heirs of her uncle, Abraham Rodrigues Marques, a rich merchant and devout Jew, who in his will of 1688 referred bitterly to Mendes's refusal to be circumcised and disinherited him and his sons if they were not circumcised within two years. Mendes proved obdurate and his Roman Catholicism injured him both professionally and financially.<br>
<br>Possibly through the influence of his family and of his patron, Dom Francisco, Mendes entered the household of Queen Catherine. On 25 March 1678 he was appointed one of her physicians, &#145;in consideration of good and faithful services&#146;, and sworn in on 10 September. His emoluments were &pound;100 a year for life, the customary 12<i>s</i>. a day board-wages, and one horse-livery a year. He attended Charles II during his last illness, and was physician to the queen until 1692, when the dowager returned to Portugal; he continued to receive his emoluments until her death in 1705, when with her other staff he received a legacy equal to one year's salary.<br>
<br>Mendes was admitted as fellow to the Royal College of Physicians on 12 April 1687, after a reform of the college charter, approved by James II, who wished religious minorities, especially Roman Catholics, to be admitted to closed institutions and offices. After James's flight in 1688, the House of Lords ordered the college to return the names of such of its members as were &#145;Papists, reputed Papists and criminals&#146;; the names were reluctantly provided on 1 July 1689 and included that of Mendes. He was duly struck off the rolls on 1 October 1689.<br>
<br>Mendes had become endenizened, together with his younger brother, John Joseph Mendes da Costa, a professing Jew, on 16 December 1687. Both brothers and their families shared Cromwell House, Highgate Hill, with its owner, their cousin Alvaro. Mendes also had apartments in Somerset House, Queen Catherine's palace, and probably had a house in the City. He was wealthy, perhaps partly through a business partnership with his cousin Alvaro. On 22 June 1694 he was able to invest &pound;1000 in Bank of England stock, which he held until his death. He was involved in the London manufacture of scientific instruments intended to encourage Portuguese cartography, and had close contacts not only with Portuguese diplomats in London but, even more unusually for a refugee <i>converso</i>, with the royal court at Lisbon. In 1706 he was consulted about the health of Pedro IV, which he would not have been had he been suspected of judaizing, and in 1723 he seconded the (fruitless) attempts of the Portuguese minister in London, Castello Branco, to purchase the fine library of the late Charles Spencer, third earl of Sunderland. He was appreciated in the highest Lisbon circles for his quinine-based elixir, &#145;Agua de Inglaterra&#146;, which was apparently exported to Lisbon by his four sons.<br>
<br>Mendes was a highly respected physician, who lived on the best of terms with his family and with the Sephardi community. His refusal to renounce Roman Catholicism may have been due to self-interest, possibly compounded by loyalty to his queen, and to religious cynicism. What his true beliefs were, if any, is unknown. However, in his will he left &pound;100 to the Sedaca (charity fund) of the synagogue; he asked to be buried next to his wife, who lay in the Jewish burial-ground at Mile End. Mendes died on 15 November 1724. Although his ties with the Jewish community seem mainly based on ethnic identity and family solidarity, he is considered one of the founding fathers of English Jewry, and his portrait, in full doctoral robes and painted by his daughter in 1721, was hung in the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue, Ashworth Road, London.<br>
