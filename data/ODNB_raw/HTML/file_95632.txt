<span class="headword">Lavis,  Henry James  Johnston-</span>  (1856&#150;1914), <span class="occ">vulcanologist and physician</span>, was born at 107 Bayham Street, Camden Town, London, on 19 July 1856, the son of Frances Lavis (1827&#150;1880), an artist, who was a daughter of John Lavis, a shoemaker in Cheriton Fitzpaine, Devon. His mother already had a daughter, Bertha Lavis, born in 1847. He was a descendant of the Huguenot de L&eacute;vis family, which had settled in Devon in the seventeenth century. His father, not named on the birth certificate, was Henry-James Johnston.<br>
<br>Johnston-Lavis was educated at the grammar school, Iver, Buckinghamshire, where his interest in geology was sparked by a fossil thrown at him by another boy. On leaving school, he began medical training in Marseilles, France, the location chosen for the benefit of his mother's health. In 1873 he transferred to University College, London, where he remained as a medical student until 1878, undertaking some of his studies at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. At University College he was inspired by the teaching of the influential geologist John Morris, and at the age of only nineteen was elected a fellow of the Geological Society. His first paper (1876) was on the Triassic strata at Sidmouth; some bones he had discovered there were found to be a new species of amphibian, and named <i>Labyrinthodon lavisi</i> in his honour. He qualified as MRCS, LRCP, and LSA in 1878.<br>
<br>Johnston-Lavis entered medical practice in Stalbridge, Dorset, and then moved to Plaistow, before gaining the degree of bachelor of science (Paris). In January 1879 he married Antonia Fran&ccedil;oise Bourdariat de Saint-Aupr&eacute; (1853&#150;1917), with whom he had six children. Towards the end of 1879 he moved to Naples, where he started a medical practice for English-speaking communities, acquiring the degree of doctor of medicine and surgery in Naples in 1884. He was also appointed chief medical officer to the works of Sir W. Armstrong, Mitchell and Co. Ltd at Pozzuoli in the Campi Flegrei district to the west of Naples. His dedication and selfless attitude was exemplified by his treatment of cholera patients.<br>
<br>In Italy Johnston-Lavis was able to pursue his geological interests. He published a monograph (1885) on the earthquakes that occurred at Ischia in 1881 and, more devastatingly, in 1883. He urged that investment be made in earthquake monitoring stations. On discovering that very little had been written about Monte Somma and Vesuvius, he devoted much of his spare time to their study, making detailed field observations and presenting a paper on the subject to the Geological Society in 1884. He continued these investigations on behalf of the British Association, submitting regular reports for the following eleven years, until 1895. Fieldwork occasionally involved considerable risks: during one eruption, he and a companion were cut off by a lava flow, only escaping through Johnston-Lavis's knowledge of the Monte Somma cliffs surrounding the central vent. On another occasion, in 1882, he discovered a lava tunnel, within which was a &#145;glistening forest of stalactites&#146; of various colours: &#145;bird's egg blue, acquamarine, salmon white, yellow and reddish brown&#146;. With his mouth and nose covered against the acidic gases, and linked to waiting colleagues by straps, he plunged into the tunnel to collect specimens, to be pulled out at the last minute into fresh air, coughing and spluttering, with his prizes  (<span class="italic">Nature</span>, 1882, 294&#150;5). His scientifically accurate geological map of Vesuvius, produced in 1891, was the culmination of 250 days of detailed survey work and represented the first detailed geological map of the area, and a valuable record of lava flows up to 1888. In 1892 he was appointed professor of vulcanology at the Royal University of Naples.<br>
<br>During the early 1890s Johnston-Lavis spent several summers working in the spa town of Harrogate, Yorkshire; his writings included <span class="italic">Prescriber's Guide to the Harrogate Mineral Waters</span>, published in 1892. In 1894 he moved to the south of France, qualifying in medicine again at the University of Lyons in 1895, with a thesis on the link between shellfish and gastric problems, a relationship he had recognized early in his career. After spending a season at Monte Carlo, he moved to the small community of Beaulieu-sur-Mer, near Nice. Beaulieu was gaining popularity as a resort, leading to the development of hotels and businesses. Using an inheritance from an Italian aristocrat, he was able to build the Hotel Empress in Beaulieu, and also his home, Villa Lavis. One of the founders of the Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital in Nice, which opened in 1906, he served as senior consulting physician there until his death. He also spent summers at Vittel in the Vosges, France, where he held the position of English consulting physician to the &Eacute;tablissement de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Eaux Min&eacute;rals de Vittel.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the First World War Johnston-Lavis was in Paris. As the railways could not be used, he left for the south of France by road, and was killed on 10 September 1914, when the car in which he was a passenger burst a tyre, crashing at Estivareilles, Alliers, near Bourges, Cher. He is buried in Beaulieu with his wife, mother-in-law, and son, Marcus Antonius Johnston de Lavis-Trafford (1880&#150;1960). His son was also a medical doctor at Nice, who shared his father's interest in archaeology, and was a pioneer of winter sports in the French Alps. His daughter Sylvia (1887&#150;1971) married the Belgian mineral prospector Fran&ccedil;ois Fournier (1857&#150;1935), who made a fortune from his discovery of a major gold deposit at Las Dos Estrellas in Mexico.<br>
<br>Johnston-Lavis published over 200 articles, mostly concerning southern Italian volcanoes. His detailed and accurate contemporary observations remain crucial to an understanding of earlier eruptions of Vesuvius, and remain of value in understanding the volcano's behaviour. His large-scale geological map of the volcano was not superseded until 2003. He acquired a magnificent collection of books, lithographs, gouaches, engravings, photographs (mainly albumen prints), and geological specimens, which he offered to the geology museum at University College, London, in 1913. The collection was finally moved in 1921, having been delayed by the war, and was first opened to the public in 1925. At the time it was described as &#145;probably the finest collection in existence (the Neapolitan Collections not excepted) of specimens, maps and literature relating to South Italian volcanic phenomena&#146;  (K. W. Earle in <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Geological Association</span>, 39, 1928, 96&#150;8), and was the subject of an exhibition at University College in 2005&#150;6. His specimen collections include 1524 rocks, many from Naples, and particularly illustrative of his geological map. Some, such as those of the 1906 Vesuvian eruption, were carefully collected in triplicate in order to offer some to the British Museum and the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC. Many of the 1600 minerals remaining are also from the Naples district, and include rare and unstable sublimates especially from the 1906 eruption of Vesuvius. These specimens and photographs are of importance as a record of areas which were submerged by the products of later eruptions.<br>
