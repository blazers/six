<span class="headword">Maguire,  Thomas</span>  (1792&#150;1847), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest, polemicist, and Irish patriot</span>, was born in the parish of Kinawley, co. Fermanagh, near Swanlinbar, the son of Thomas Maguire, farmer, and his wife, Judith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Maguire. His maternal uncle was Patrick Maguire, coadjutor-bishop of Kilmore. He attended a classical school in Ballyconnell, but was at least twenty when nominated to St Patrick's College, Maynooth, in 1813 by the bishop of Kilmore, Dr Fergal O'Reilly. He was ordained priest in September 1816 in the church at Kildoagh, co. Cavan, which his uncle had built as parish priest. He remained his uncle's curate until July 1818, when he was appointed parish priest at Drumreilly in co. Leitrim. In early 1825 he became parish priest of nearby Inishmagrath, where he ministered to a poor and largely Irish-speaking population. He moved to Oughteragh, Ballinamore, co. Leitrim, in August 1835, where he became dean of Kilmore.<br>
<br>Maguire rose to national prominence through his support for Daniel O'Connell's campaign for Catholic emancipation and his linked opposition to the &#145;Protestant crusade&#146; against Irish Catholicism launched in 1822 by the archbishop of Dublin, William Magee. Maguire's remarks at a political meeting at Carrick-on-Shannon on 22 April 1826 led to a debate with the Revd Richard T. P. Pope at the Dublin Institute in Sackville Street held between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. over six days (19&#150;25 April 1827), Daniel O'Connell serving as one of the Catholic chairmen, and Admiral Oliver and John Dillon for the protestants. Maguire's easy and passionate eloquence, with its &#145;flavour of the Leitrim bogs&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Devil is a Jackass</span>, 158), and the help of &#145;his father&#146;, the publisher Richard Coyne, in anticipating his opponent ensured that Maguire got the better of the argument: Coyne had discovered that Pope was cribbing from a work by Charles Leslie of 1713, and supplied Maguire with the Catholic Robert Manning's reply to it of 1716 (this reply was republished by Coyne in 1827, with a dedication to Maguire as &#145;the Bossuet of the British Churches&#146;).<br>
<br>O'Connell was said to have given Maguire a victory present of plate worth &pound;1000  (Bowen, 107), but Maguire had to pay &pound;50 in damages to Power le Poer Trench, the protestant archbishop of Tuam, when in 1827 the Dublin press reported Maguire as claiming that the archbishop had offered him &pound;1000 and a living worth &pound;800 a year to turn protestant. Later in 1827 he was defended by O'Connell when charged by a protestant innkeeper from Drumkeerin, co. Leitrim, Bartholomew McGarahan, with fathering his daughter's stillborn child, and Maguire had to pay 6<i>d</i>. in costs.<br>
<br>Maguire was now embarked on a career as one of the most popular orators of his age, and from 1829 until 1843 he addressed huge crowds and packed congregations in churches and at venues throughout England and Ireland. In 1829 he preached a series of Lenten sermons in St Teresa's Church in Dublin where, in 1835, his charity sermon helped pay for the three churches he built in his parish. His sermon at Waterford on 5 June 1842 attracted a collection of &pound;550. Between 29 May and 7 June 1838 he had another celebrated polemical exchange with the Revd Tresham (by nickname Thrash'em or Trashy) Dames Gregg, chaplain at the Swift's Alley church, Dublin, a learned eccentric who was at war with his own archbishop, Richard Whately, and ended up claiming to be immortal. Gregg afterwards published his own version of his exchange with Maguire to replace their agreed text of the controversy. Bishop Ullathorne recalled &#145;the wonderful amount of freshness and vigour which Father Tom, as [Maguire] was familiarly called, gave to old and familiar texts&#146;, and his habit when, after a lecture, soaked in perspiration, he would drink a glass of whisky hissing from a red hot poker, and then engage with his friends in &#145;a flow of wit and learning such as I never witnessed before or since&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Devil is a Jackass</span>, 158). Ullathorne was less admiring of Maguire's habit of pocketing half the entrance money.<br>
<br>Much of this speaking was political. At the County Clare election of 1828, which returned O'Connell:<blockquote>Fitzgerald's own (Catholic) tenants seemed to hang in the balance until &hellip; Maguire's stentorian appeal: &#145;You have heard the tones of the tempter and charmer, whose confederates have through all ages joined the descendants of the Dane, the Norman, and the Saxon, in burning your churches, in levelling your altars, in slaughtering your clergy, in stamping out your religion. Let every renegade to his God and his country follow Vesey FitzGerald, and every true Catholic Irishman follow me&#146;. (O. MacDonagh, <span class="italic">The Hereditary Bondsman</span>, 1988, 254)</blockquote>On 15 August 1833 Maguire convened a great meeting for the repeal of the union on Sheena Hill near Drumkeerin. At a meeting in Castlebar in 1843, in the presence of O'Connell and Archbishop MacHale, Maguire explained repeal as &#145;the consideration next in importance to eternity itself for the Irish people&#146;  (McGovern, 281).<br>
<br>Maguire suddenly dropped from public view in 1843, devoting himself to a legendary hospitality and to other country matters as, by his own boast, &#145;the best shot, the best courser, the best quoit-player, the best breeder of greyhounds, pointers, and spaniels, and the best brewer of &#147;scaltheen&#148; in the whole county of Leitrim&#146;, as his obituary in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> recalled. His translation of Moore's &#145;Nora Creina&#146; into Latin for the Dublin <span class="italic">University Magazine</span> won him free copies of the journal for life. He died on 2 December 1847 at Munroe Lodge, Ardrum, Ballinamore, allegedly of gout. His oration was preached by Dr James Browne, bishop of Kilmore, to &#145;the most numerously and respectably attended funeral ever witnessed in that part&#146;  (McGovern, 285), and parishioners dragged the funeral carriage 6 miles to Kilnavart cemetery in Templeport, where he was buried on 6 December. The sudden deaths of Maguire's brother- and sister-in-law, Terence and Anna, who had lived with him led to the exhumation of his body on 14 January 1848, and the discovery that, like his in-laws, he had been poisoned by arsenic. An inquest brought a charge of murder against his housekeeper Mary Reynolds and an accomplice, Hugh Quinn, but they were acquitted at the Leitrim assizes in 1848. Reynolds and John and Pete Reilly were tried for Terence's murder, and Reynolds was again acquitted, but the Reilly brothers were sentenced to hanging.<br>
<br>Ullathorne described Maguire as &#145;a tall man with a high, tapering forehead, broad jaws, florid features and a small mouth with tall teeth and, for his proportions, narrow shoulders&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Devil is a Jackass</span>, 158). His career as polemicist and politician embodies one aspect of the nineteenth-century Irish clergy, as a tribune for their people, but as a &#145;cheery, joyous, independent and &hellip; <i>rollicking</i> sort of priest&#146;  (&#145;Irish poetry&#146;, 66).<br>
