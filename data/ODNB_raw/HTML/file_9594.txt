<span class="headword">Fitzgibbon,  Gerald</span>  (1793&#150;1882), <span class="occ">barrister</span>, was born at Glin, co. Limerick, on 1 January 1793, the fourth son of Gerald Fitzgibbon, an Irish tenant farmer, and his wife, of whom little is known. He was educated at home and later obtained employment as a clerk in a mercantile house in Dublin, in 1814. His spare time was spent studying the classics, and on 12 October 1818 he entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in 1825, and MA in 1832. In 1830 he was called to the Irish bar. During his college course and preparation for the bar he had kept himself by teaching; by 1835 he evidently felt financially secure enough to marry Ellen Patterson, the daughter of John Patterson of Belfast. They had two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33153/', "Gerald Fitzgibbon (1837&#150;1909)")</script>, and Henry (<i>d</i>. 1912), who later became vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.<br>
<br>Fitzgibbon's rise at the bar was rapid, his mercantile experience standing him in good stead, and in 1841 he became queen's counsel. In 1844 he (unsuccessfully) defended Dr John Gray in the state trial of that year, through which Daniel O'Connell's influence with mass Irish opinion was said to have been destroyed. In the course of the trial Fitzgibbon used language concerning Cusack Smith, the Irish attorney-general, which was construed by the latter to be an imputation of dishonourable motives and drew from him a challenge. Fitzgibbon returned the cartel and, on the attorney-general declining to take it back, drew the attention of the court to the occurrence. The chief justice suspended the proceedings, in order to give the parties time for reflection, observing that the attorney-general was the last man in his profession who ought to have allowed himself to be betrayed into such an expression of feeling as had been stated to have taken place. The attorney-general then expressed his willingness to withdraw the note, in the hope that Fitzgibbon would withdraw the words which had elicited it. Fitzgibbon disclaimed any intention to impute unworthy conduct to the attorney-general, the matter was dropped, and the trial proceeded.<br>
<br>Fitzgibbon continued in practice until 1860, when he accepted the post of receiver-master in Chancery. In 1868 he published <span class="italic">Ireland in 1868, the battle field for English party strife; its grievances real and fictitious; remedies abortive or mischievous</span>, which dealt with educational, land, religious, and other questions of the time. The last chapter, &#145;The former and present condition of the Irish people&#146;, was published separately in the same year. Fitzgibbon was of the view that any Irish prosperity was due to the country's English connections. A second edition, including an additional chapter on the land question, was brought out also in 1868. This was followed up with a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">The Land Difficulty of Ireland, with an Effort to Solve it</span> (1869). Fitzgibbon's central idea for reform was that fixity of tenure should be granted only to farmers who implemented improvements to the satisfaction of a public official appointed to oversee standards. In 1871 he published <span class="italic">Roman Catholic Priests and National Schools</span> (2nd edn, 1872), which laid stress on the teaching of Catholic priests on the doctrines of hell and purgatory.<br>
<br>Having in 1871 been charged in the House of Commons with acting with inhumanity in the administration of certain landed property belonging to wards of the Irish court of chancery, Fitzgibbon published in pamphlet form a vindication of his conduct, entitled <span class="italic">Refutation of a Libel on Gerald Fitzgibbon, Esq., Master in Chancery in Ireland</span> (1871). A few years later he also brought out <span class="italic">A Banded Ministry and the Upas Tree</span> (1873).<br>
<br>Fitzgibbon resigned his post in 1878 and died on 27 September 1882. As an advocate he enjoyed a high reputation for patience and hard work. It would seem that a dislike for party politics prevented him from aspiring to judicial office.<br>
