<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Seilern und Aspang, Count  Antoine Edward</span>  (1901&#150;1978), <span class="occ">art historian and collector</span>, was born at Frensham Place, Farnham, Surrey, on 17 September 1901, the youngest of three sons of Count Carl Seilern und Aspang (1866&#150;1940) and his American-born wife, Antoinette, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Woerishoffer (1875&#150;1901), who died five days after his birth. Brought up by his adored grandmother Anna Woerishoffer (1850&#150;1931) in New York and Vienna, Seilern was educated at the third district Realgymnasium, Vienna (1912&#150;20), and at the Wiener Handelsakademie (1920&#150;21); he studied engineering at the Technische Hochschule (1922&#150;4). He later worked in the timber industry in Yugoslavia and at banking in Vienna. As a wealthy young nobleman, he was a keen horseman, racehorse owner and breeder, and became a qualified air pilot. He went big game hunting in Africa, Mongolia, Indo-China, and Yukon between 1930 and 1933, and made a world tour in 1930&#150;31.<br>
<br>At the suggestion of his father and his stepmother, Countess Ilse, he enrolled at Vienna University (1933&#150;9) to study principally art history; an art historian family friend, Count Karl Wilczek, recommended him to Johannes Wilde for private tuition, thus beginning a lifelong friendship. His university teachers were Karl Swoboda, Julius Schlosser, and Hans Sedelmayr; but his interest in collecting was prompted by Count Karl Lanckoronski, himself a noted collector. Seilern's doctoral thesis on the Venetian influences on Rubens's ceiling paintings was accepted on 9 June 1939. Like his father and brothers Seilern had dual Austrian and British nationality, but he renounced his Austrian citizenship after the First World War, and was thus able to remove his collection and library (and that of Wilde) from 6 Brahmsplatz, Vienna, to London, in the summer of 1939. Seilern enlisted in the British army, becoming a private in the Pioneer Corps before volunteering for the Russo-Finnish campaign in March&#150;April 1940. After escaping from occupied Norway to Sweden, Seilern joined the Royal Artillery and was eventually commissioned as an interpreter. During the war he acquired the lease of 56 Prince's Gate, South Kensington, London, a gloomy Victorian mansion which was to remain his London home for the rest of his life; he had bought a farm near Chesham, Buckinghamshire, in 1939.<br>
<br>On his grandmother's death in 1931 Seilern inherited his share of a large fortune made from railways and the liberal German-language newspaper <span class="italic">New Yorker Staats-Zeitung</span>. He had begun collecting in the late 1920s, his taste shaped by the collections of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, and by his growing interest in Rubens. Guided by Ludwig Burchard and Wilde, to whom he constantly turned for advice, Seilern had by 1939 built up a substantial collection of paintings and drawings: these included the Rubens <span class="italic">Landscape by Moonlight</span> (which Sir Joshua Reynolds once owned), Rubens's <i>modelli</i> for the wings of the Antwerp <span class="italic">Descent from the Cross</span>; and four <i>modelli</i> for the Jesuit church at Aranjuez by his other great love, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. He eventually owned thirty-two paintings and twenty-two drawings by Rubens, and twelve paintings and twenty-nine drawings by Tiepolo. Superb drawings by Giovanni Bellini, Brueghel, D&uuml;rer, Hugo van der Goes, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Watteau, Degas, Picasso, and C&eacute;zanne, as well as by contemporary Austrian artists, indicate the range of his taste, which also extended to Chinese bronzes. His greatest coup was the purchase, in 1942, of <span class="italic">The Entombment with Donor and the Resurrection</span> by the Master of Fl&eacute;malle, which had been wrongly auctioned as by Adriaen Isenbrandt; rivalling this in splendour is Bernardo Daddi's <span class="italic">Virgin and Child with Saints</span>, 1338, which he bought in 1956 from the Collalto family, the only major Florentine work in the collection. In 1950 he commissioned Oskar Kokoschka to paint the three <i>Prometheus</i> panels for the ceiling of the anteroom in his Prince's Gate house. Seilern was a very generous benefactor to the museums, notably the National Gallery, London, and the British Museum, but insisted his gifts remain anonymous. He shunned publicity and abhorred dealers, the exception being James Byam Shaw of Colnaghi's, whose scholarship, judgement, and integrity he trusted. Through his friendship with Wilde, by 1948 deputy director of the Courtauld Institute, Seilern decided to bequeath his magnificent collection of 127 paintings and some 300 drawings to the Courtauld, and in deference to his wishes that it was not to bear his name, it is now known as the Prince's Gate collection. Between 1955 and 1971 he privately published a catalogue of his collection in seven volumes.<br>
<br>Of medium height and square-built, Seilern could be, by turns, an ebullient Viennese aristocrat at ease in society and charming to women, or a reclusive, serious scholar, eager to discuss art with other students and scholars, to whom he was generous in showing his &#145;little collection&#146;, as he called it. He amassed his treasures with a keen eye for quality, but was also deeply aware of the historical significance of the works he acquired. He never married, and died of heart disease at 56 Prince's Gate on 6 July 1978. He was buried in Frensham churchyard on 13 July but later exhumed and removed to the family vault at Aspang, south of Vienna.<br>
