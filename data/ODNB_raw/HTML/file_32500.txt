<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Collings,  Jesse</span>  (1831&#150;1920), <span class="occ">politician</span>, youngest son of Thomas Collings, of Littleham, Exmouth, Devon, and his wife, Anne Palmer, was born at Littleham on 9 January 1831. His father was a bricklayer, afterwards proprietor of a small building business; but in later life Jesse Collings was fond of tracing his descent from the Palmers because they had, he believed, been yeoman farmers. He was educated at a dame-school &#145;for tradesmen's sons&#146;, and also spent a year at Church House School, Stoke, Plymouth, which was kept by a cousin. At the age of fifteen he became a shop assistant, later a clerk and commercial traveller in the ironmongery trade. In 1850 he entered, as a clerk, the firm of Booth &amp; Co. of Birmingham, which was renamed Collings and Wallis when he became a partner fourteen years later; he retired in 1879. He married, in 1858, Emily, daughter of Edward Oxenbould, a master at King Edward VI's Grammar School, Birmingham. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>While living at Exeter and representing his firm, Collings obtained much knowledge of rural conditions by his travels through the west of England. His first public work was done when he helped to establish the Devon and Exeter Boys' Industrial School in 1862. Influenced by study of American education, his interest in education developed when he went to live in Birmingham in 1864, and in 1868 he published <span class="italic">An Outline of the American School System</span>, which was the immediate cause of the formation of the National Education League for the advocacy of free and non-sectarian elementary education. He was elected a town councillor for the Edgbaston division of Birmingham in that year, and thereafter became prominently associated with the programme of municipal reform in the city carried out by Joseph Chamberlain, with whom he developed a close personal and political friendship. He was mayor from 1878 to 1880.<br>
<br>Outside municipal affairs Collings was becoming widely known as an advocate of free education and of land reform. In the latter connection he, with a number of other radicals, was closely associated with Joseph Arch and the National Agricultural Labourers' Union, and with the Highland Land Law Reform Association. In 1880 he was returned for Ipswich as a Liberal, and in 1882 he secured the passing of the <span class="roman">Allotments Extension Act</span>. In January 1886 his smallholdings' amendment to the queen's speech united Liberals and home-rulers and felled Salisbury's government. Gladstone made Collings parliamentary secretary to the Local Government Board, while controversially reducing his salary. Collings was unseated on petition in April 1886, thus missing the home-rule debates; but he followed his friend Chamberlain into Liberal Unionism. In July 1886 he was elected for Bordesley, Birmingham, as a Liberal Unionist, holding the seat until 1918. In the Salisbury administration of 1895 he was under-secretary to the Home department, retaining office until 1902. In 1892 he had been made a privy councillor. A loyal colleague and good party servant, his work in office was mainly administrative, and unconnected with his life interests. He died at Southfield, Church Road, Edgbaston (once Chamberlain's home), on 20 November 1920.<br>
<br>From the days when he appeared on the platforms of the National Agricultural Labourers' Union until he retired from public life, Collings was an enthusiastic advocate of land reform. It was he who, in 1885, began to use the phrase &#145;three acres and a cow&#146;, which for many years was the war-cry of the land-reformers. The home-rule controversy of 1886 scattered the group of radical land-reformers that had gathered round the agricultural labourers' movement. They were henceforth in opposing political camps. Arch and his associates adhered to the Gladstonian party, Collings and his associates became unionists, and the effectiveness of both groups was destroyed. In 1883 Collings had formed the Allotments Extension Association; and in 1888 he became its president, but was deposed, partly as a result of differences on the question of home rule. He then formed the Rural Labourers' League (afterwards known as the Rural League) with which he was connected until 1919. He supported the tariff-reform campaign on agricultural grounds. He continued his interest in rural affairs, including education, allotments, smallholdings, and the administration of charitable trusts.<br>
<br>In education Collings was the advocate of a vocational system of elementary education in rural areas, and in land reform the advocate of a system of peasant proprietorship. His views on education were never embodied in legislation, though to a small extent they were adopted in teaching practice and administration. His ideas on land reform were partly embodied in the ineffective <span class="roman">Small Holdings Act</span> of 1882, and again in the <span class="roman">Land Settlement Act</span> of 1919. He published <span class="italic">Land Reform</span> (1906), <span class="italic">The Colonization of Rural Britain</span> (1914), and <span class="italic">The Great War: its Lessons and Warnings</span> (1915).<br>
