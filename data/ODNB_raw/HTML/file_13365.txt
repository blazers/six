<span class="headword">Hirst,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1770?), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was the eldest son of William Hirst DD (<i>d</i>. 1760), master of Hertford Free School, vicar of Bengeo, and rector of Sacomb, Hertfordshire. He was educated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he obtained his BA in 1750&#150;51 as fifteenth junior optime and proceeded MA in 1754. He became a naval chaplain. In April 1754, being then resident at Hornsey, Middlesex, he sent the Royal Society an account of a fire-ball seen there, which led to his election as fellow on 20 February 1755. That year he sailed in the <i>Hampton Court</i> (64 guns) to Lisbon after the earthquake, and made a drawing of the city in its ruins. In 1759 he was chaplain of the <i>Lenox</i> (74 guns) and secretary to Rear-Admiral Samuel Cornish on the East India station, where he was present at the sieges of Pondicherry and Vellore. On 6 June 1761 he observed the transit of Venus across the sun at Government House, Madras, in company with the governor, afterwards Lord Pigot.<br>
<br>In March 1762, Hirst left the Royal Navy and joined the East India Company, to be appointed chaplain to the factory of Calcutta by the favour of Henry Vansittart, then governor of Bengal, and in November of that year he sent to the Royal Society an account of a severe earthquake in Bengal and of two eclipses of the sun and moon observed at Calcutta. His astronomical observations were used in the compilation of Dunn's map of Bengal. Among the surveys taken home by Vansittart was a &#145;map of the River Samelpore, laid down by Mr Hirst&#146;  (BL OIOC, Orme MSS, 134). In December 1764 Hirst returned to England with Vansittart in HMS <i>Medway</i>. On the voyage he took a view of the Cape of Good Hope, which was engraved in 1766 by Peter Charles Canot. At the invitation of the astronomer royal, Hirst observed the second transit of Venus on 3 June 1769 at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, with Vansittart recording the times for him.<br>
<br>Hirst then took chambers in Fig Tree Court, Inner Temple, London. Though in comfortable circumstances, his old friendship induced him to accompany Vansittart, sent out as one of three commissioners by the East India Company in 1769 to investigate alleged corruption in company affairs in India. Hirst was chaplain to the commission, and his friend William Falconer was purser of the <i>Aurora</i>, the frigate in which they sailed. A Latin ode, &#145;Ad amicum navigaturum&#146;, addressed to Hirst on the occasion by James Kirkpatrick MD, was printed in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (39, 1769, 550). The <i>Aurora</i> sailed for Bengal from the Cape of Good Hope on 27 December 1769, but was never heard of again. Some of Hirst's letters to John Duncombe and William Fazakerley were printed in Duncombe's <span class="italic">Letters by Several Eminent Persons Deceased</span>  (Duncombe, 3.84, 94, 142, 154, 159).<br>
