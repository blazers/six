<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wade,  George</span>  (1673&#150;1748), <span class="occ">army officer and road builder</span>, was the third son of Jerome Wade of Kilavally, co. Westmeath, whose father, William Wade, had served as a major under Cromwell. Wade's first commission, dated 26 December 1690, was as ensign in Captain Richard Trevanion's company of the earl of Bath's regiment. At that time the regiment was based in the Channel Islands, but in spring 1691 it transferred to Flanders as William III concentrated his troops to confront Louis XIV in the Low Countries. On 24 July / 3 August 1692 Wade's regiment participated in the bloody action at Steenkerke, and helped to cover the retreat of the Anglo-Dutch army; it subsequently joined the attack upon the Lines of Lys in July 1693. Wade rose rapidly within his regiment during this period of active service and heavy casualties: he was promoted lieutenant on 10 February 1693, captain-lieutenant in what was now Sir Bevil Granville's regiment on 19 April 1694, and on 13 June 1695 gained the captaincy of the &eacute;lite grenadier company.<h2>
<a name="WaroftheSpanishSuccession"></a>War of the Spanish Succession</h2>Wade returned to England after the treaty of Ryswick, but when a fresh war with France erupted in 1702, his corps revisited the familiar battlefields of Flanders. The regiment was once again heavily engaged, fighting at Nijmegen and during the sieges of Kaiserswerth, Venloo, and Ruremond. In the autumn of 1702 Captain Wade served at the siege of Li&egrave;ge where his grenadiers distinguished themselves by storming the citadel, reckoned to be one of the region's strongest fortifications. In March 1703 Wade was promoted major, and in August of the same year served at the siege and capture of Huy; that October he succeeded to the lieutenant-colonelcy of his regiment. Having established his reputation during a decade of fighting in Flanders, Wade now volunteered for service with the British contingent bound for Portugal under the earl of Galway. Galway's influence gained Wade the staff appointment of adjutant-general, with the brevet rank of colonel, on 27 August 1704. In the spring of 1705 Galway laid siege to the frontier town of Valencia d'Alcantara, which was captured by assault on 27 April / 8 May. Officers slain during the attack included Robert Duncanson, colonel of the regiment later numbered the 33rd foot, and the vacant colonelcy was bestowed on Wade. In April 1706 Wade was wounded at the siege of Alcantara but continued to serve on Galway's staff, accompanying the allied forces on their triumphal entry into Madrid on 16/27 June. After remaining at the capital for more than a month, Galway's army retreated to Valencia. Wade's combat leadership was once again apparent in the fighting withdrawal; with two infantry battalions he repulsed a superior force of cavalry at Vila Nova. When the allied army was defeated by Bourbon troops under the duke of Berwick at Almanza on 14/25 April 1707, Wade emerged from the disaster with an enhanced reputation: he commanded the 3rd brigade of British infantry which encountered fierce fighting and suffered accordingly. Wade none the less evaded capture to join Galway at Alcira, and was sent to England with dispatches. On 1 January 1708 Wade was promoted brigadier-general in the British army, and returned to Spain in the spring.<br>
<br>Wade's record as a competent and courageous officer led to his selection as second in command to General James Stanhope in the expedition to Minorca which sailed from Barcelona in September 1708. At the siege of Fort St Philip, the strongpoint guarding the harbour of Port Mahon, Wade led one of the storming parties, captured the outer defences, and subsequently negotiated the fort's capitulation. The entire island soon after submitted, to become a valuable British base in the Mediterranean. Wade was granted the honour of returning home with the news of Minorca's reduction; in 1709 he received a flattering letter from &#145;Charles III&#146;, the allies' candidate for the Spanish throne, and the rank of major-general while serving in Spain. Wade returned to Portugal, remaining there until 1710, when he rejoined Stanhope in Spain and was given the command of a brigade of infantry. On 9/20 August Wade participated in the overwhelming victory over the forces of Philip V at Saragossa; the battle avenged Almanza, but failed to stave off ultimate allied defeat in the dismal Peninsular campaign.<h2>
<a name="TheCommonsandtheFifteen"></a>The Commons and the &#145;'Fifteen&#146;</h2>Wade was sent home for reinforcements and in 1711 was serving in England on the subcommittee of the board of general officers. With the accession of George I, Wade's prospects improved dramatically. He was promoted major-general on 3 October 1714, and a month later was appointed commander of the forces in Ireland. It is unclear whether Wade actually took up his new post. A staunch whig, he was returned to parliament for Hindon, Wiltshire, on 25 January 1715. When rebellion broke out later that year, Wade was placed at the head of two regiments of dragoons and sent to overawe the potential Jacobite stronghold of Bath. The veteran Wade proved an effective enforcer for the Hanoverian regime; his efforts unearthed eleven chests of weapons and ammunition, four artillery pieces, and moulds to cast more&#151;an impressive haul which indicated that the west country Jacobites enjoyed the potential, if not the inclination, for insurrection. Wade soon consolidated his reputation for counter-insurgency work; two years later he was instrumental in foiling a Jacobite conspiracy to purchase military assistance from Sweden. The intrigue centred upon Charles XII's ambassador, Count Gyllenborg. It was Wade who led the troops responsible for arresting the count, searching his house, and securing incriminating papers. Wade's zeal did not go unrecognized: on 19 March 1717 George I gave him the colonelcy of the regiment that subsequently became the 3rd dragoon guards. When Spanish support for the Jacobite rising in Scotland prompted a British reprisal against Vigo in September 1719, Wade was appointed second in command to Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham. The expedition proved a complete success. Vigo surrendered, and in October Pontevedra was taken by Wade, who destroyed the arsenal after salvaging the most valuable armaments and munitions.<br>
<br>In 1722 Wade was elected MP for Bath and continued to represent the borough until his death. He established an impregnable political position in the city; indeed in 1734 he achieved the unequalled feat of polling all thirty votes. The general's dominance stemmed from several factors&#151;the personal prestige acquired during his anti-Jacobite investigations of 1715, a philanthropic concern for local causes, and his alliance with the city's powerful postmaster and quarry owner, Ralph Allen, &#145;the man of Bath&#146;; the frequently quoted story that Allen married Wade's illegitimate daughter appears to be a myth.<h2>
<a name="Themilitaryways"></a>The military ways</h2>Wade's record as a vigorous soldier with an aptitude for intelligence work may have influenced his appointment in 1724 to reconnoitre the Scottish highlands and observe their strength and resources. Wade found the district in &#145;a state of Anarchy and Confusion&#146;  (Allardyce, 1.137). Blood feuds, blackmail, and cattle rustling were rife; more worryingly for national security, efforts to disarm the highlands in the wake of the 'Fifteen had proved so ineffective that the pro-Jacobite clans were now better equipped for rebellion than ever before. Wade's report of 1724, and a scheme presented to George I in the following year, recommended a programme of reforms to redress the situation: these included establishing companies of loyal highlanders capable of policing the rugged region; improving communications; building new barracks; and repairing existing fortresses. These proposals gained Wade the post of commander of the forces in north Britain, an appointment he held until 1740. While <i>en route</i> to the highlands in the summer of 1725, he was obliged to quell disturbances in Glasgow, where attempts to enforce the malt tax had triggered serious rioting; he concentrated sufficient troops to arrest the ringleaders and restore order. In the highlands Wade's measures were implemented with considerable success: in a second report, made to George II in 1727, he described how the &#145;Disarming [of] the Highlands was happily Executed without Resistance or Bloodshed&#146;  (ibid., 159). The general's improvements included the construction of a road stretching 60 miles from Inverness to Fort William through the heart of the highlands; he believed that further &#145;military ways&#146; would provide crucial links with troops in the lowlands, so discouraging future uprisings. In the decade after 1725 Wade's &#145;highwaymen&#146;&#151;gangs of soldiers given double pay for their labours&#151;toiled to build more than 240 miles of road, and some thirty bridges, including the spectacular five-arch crossing of the Tay at Aberfeldy. Wade's road-making programme was a remarkable feat of civil engineering, yet its strategic role proved ambiguous: ironically the general's fine roads merely served to expedite the movements of the Jacobite forces in 1745&#150;6.<br>
<br>During his sojourn in Scotland Wade continued to accumulate honours. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 7 March 1727, and when three regiments of dragoons were raised that summer to reinforce the troops in Scotland Wade gained the colonelcy of one of them. In 1732 he was awarded the sinecure government of Berwick and Holy Island, followed in 1733 by appointment to the governorships of forts William, Augustus, and George. On 2 July 1739 Wade was promoted general of horse, and in 1742 was sworn of the privy council and became lieutenant-general of the ordnance.<h2>
<a name="FieldcommandandtheFortyFive"></a>Field command and the &#145;'Forty-Five&#146;</h2>These honours were crowned on 14 December 1743 when Wade received a field marshal's baton and command of the British forces in Flanders. The appointment followed the resignation of the earl of Stair; for Wade, who had never before commanded an army in the field, it was to prove a poisoned chalice. His return to Flanders yielded no victories to set beside those of his youth; indeed, in the opinion of one modern commentator the operations of 1744 proved &#145;one of the dingiest campaigns ever waged by British arms and nourished by British gold&#146;  (Whitworth, 84). Wade's contingent was required to co-operate with the Austrian and Dutch forces under the duc d'Aremberg and the prince of Nassau. Ranged against these uneasy allies was a powerful French army commanded by the most able general of the day, Maurice de Saxe. When the allies finally took the field in May 1744 they lacked both unified command and common objectives. Saxe reacted with decision: within weeks the French reduced Menin, Ypres, and Furnes. In July, when Prince Charles of Lorraine invaded Alsace, so obliging Louis XV to divert troops from Flanders, George II urged Wade to exploit the situation by mounting an offensive. An advance towards Lille was eventually organized, but subsequently stalled amid logistical problems and acrimonious councils of war. In October Wade made a successful application for leave to return to England. The field marshal had provided a convenient scapegoat for the allies' dismal showing: in fairness to Wade, who was now aged over seventy and in poor health, his performance had been hampered by obstructive colleagues and the unsettling interference of Lord Stair. Accepting Wade's resignation in March 1745, the secretary of state, Lord Harrington, assured him that George II expressed &#145;the most perfect Satisfaction&#146; in his services  (Parker, 114). The king demonstrated his continuing confidence in Wade by appointing him commander-in-chief in England.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Jacobite rising in Scotland Wade headed the military committee responsible for deciding the government's response to the crisis. It was agreed that Wade should march north with thirteen battalions of foot, including a large contingent of foreign troops. By the end of October 1745 Wade's force had arrived at Newcastle upon Tyne, which was considered the most likely objective for the army of Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender. Contrary to expectations, the Jacobites side-stepped Wade, opting for a western route to Carlisle, which they besieged. At Newcastle Wade faced problems controlling his heterogeneous command, half of which consisted of unenthusiastic Swiss and Dutch auxiliaries. When he finally began his march on 16 November it was already too late: his sickly and dispirited troops made slow progress over bad roads in appalling weather conditions. Encountering heavy snow, Wade's jaded men slogged on as far as Hexham, only to learn that Carlisle had already fallen. After a day of rest Wade and his army retraced their laborious steps, arriving back in Newcastle on 22 November. Wade had retired in the belief that the Jacobites would not risk a further advance into England; once again he was proved wrong as they proceeded unopposed into Lancashire. By the end of the month the duke of Cumberland had been ordered to counter the threat; he was to co-ordinate operations with Wade, but if the two armies met, the duke would assume command. Cumberland was alarmed by the field marshal's sluggish progress south and urged the duke of Newcastle to replace &#145;grandmother Wade&#146; with a more dynamic general  (McLynn, 123). Wade had failed to catch the swift-moving highland army on its southward march; more alarming was his inability to intercept the Jacobites on their subsequent retreat from Derby. Indeed, when Wade reached Wakefield on 10 December, he learned that the highlanders were at least three days ahead of him. Detaching his cavalry in the hope of blocking Prince Charles's route to Preston, Wade returned to Newcastle with the slow-moving infantry.<br>
<br>Cumberland was appointed commander-in-chief for the coming pursuit of the Jacobite army into Scotland; Wade, who had already registered a plea that his age rendered him unfit for further campaigning, now retired from active service. In 1746 he presided over the court martial that considered the actions of Sir John Cope during the operations that culminated in disaster at Prestonpans; the tribunal exonerated Cope of any blame. Wade's own conduct of his final campaign prompted fierce contemporary criticism, and modern scholars have been scarcely less damning in their verdicts. The most careful account of the campaign finds it &#145;incredible&#146; that Wade's &#145;extraordinarily lacklustre performance&#146; did not lead to <i>his</i> court martial  (McLynn, 197). However, in Lord George Murray, Wade found himself pitted against an exceptionally gifted opponent who also outmanoeuvred Cumberland; in addition Wade's inability to maintain the momentum of a harsh winter campaign says more about George II's misguided penchant for superannuated generals than the deficiencies of a sickly 72-year-old who should have been enjoying a well-earned retirement.<h2>
<a name="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h2>A competent brigadier, Wade lacked the ability to command an army in the field. In his prime he had none the less proved himself a brave soldier and diligent servant of the crown; these valuable qualities did not go unrecognized. Recording his death, one popular journal chose to forget his poor showing during 1744&#150;5, instead emphasizing the faithful service through which &#145;he rose under four succeeding princes to the highest honours of his profession&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 139). Wade died on 14 March 1748 at his house in Abbey Churchyard, Bath, aged seventy-five and &#145;worth above 100,000 l&#146;  (ibid.). As the numerous surviving portraits of Wade testify, he was keen to perpetuate his own memory; by his will, dated 1 June 1747, he left &pound;500 for a monument to himself in either Bath or Westminster Abbey. His memorial was erected at Westminster, where he was buried. The sculptor Roubiliac considered Wade's memorial to be &#145;his best work&#146;; he wept upon observing that it had been placed too high to be appreciated. Unmarried, Wade left most of his substantial estate to his three children, George, John, and Jane; he also provided generously for the widow and children of his brother William, canon of Windsor, and his great-nephew William, probably William Wade (1734/5&#150;1809), subsequently master of ceremonies at Bath.<br>
