<span class="headword">Ramsay,  John</span>, Lord Bothwell and Lord Balmain  (<em>c.</em>1464&#150;1513), <span class="occ">administrator and conspirator</span>, was reputedly the son of Sir John Ramsay of Corstoun and his wife, Janet Napier. Evidence for his early career is found only in late sixteenth-century chronicles, which describe him as a page of James III who survived the execution of the royal familiars at Lauder Bridge in July 1482 by leaping onto James's horse and clinging to the king. His life was spared at James's &#145;earnest sollicitatione, being bot a zouthe of 18 zeires of age, and a courte pimpe&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Works</span>, 206). The trustworthiness of the details of this episode cannot be taken for granted, but the unanimity of the sources makes it appear likely that Ramsay was indeed threatened with execution in 1482 and saved by the king's intercession. What is certain is that he became squire of the chamber, gaining the lands formerly held by Alexander Kennedy of Irwell on 6 September 1483, then the barony of Bothwell and a 40 merk annuity from Lord Monypenny's lands in February 1484. About 1484 Ramsay married a widow, Isabel Cant of Dunbar, and on 20 July they received a twenty-year lease on half the lands of the Two Kinkells in Strathearn, Perthshire, and part of a mill at Strathmiglo, Fife. Knighted at an unknown date, by May 1485 Ramsay had been raised to the peerage as Lord Bothwell, and his official duties increased: he was auditor of the exchequer (1484&#150;7), commissioner for leasing crown lands in Ettrick and Menteith (during 1486), master of the royal household (November 1486), custodian of Dunbar Castle (from June 1486), and royal justiciar south of Forth (from 1487). On 30 October 1485 Ramsay, with Bishop William Elphinstone and others, represented James III at Henry VII's coronation at Westminster, and he was closely involved in negotiations for an Anglo-Scottish truce in May&#150;July 1486 and November 1487.<br>
<br>As a royal familiar, however, Ramsay became the scapegoat for James III's politically unpopular policies and the focus of rebel propaganda, held responsible for the pro-English foreign policy, and even accused of having poisoned Queen Margaret (who had died in July 1486). Such accusations helped to give the rebels justification for the overthrow and murder of James III in June 1488. Seeking help against the rebels, Ramsay spent Easter 1488 at Windsor with Henry VII, from whom he received &pound;13 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. as a gift, and subsequently became one of several Scottish exiles at the English court. On 6 August 1488 he was among ten of James III's supporters summoned by James IV to answer the charge of treason; in their absence, on 8 August, they were forfeited by parliament. The barony of Bothwell was granted to Patrick, Lord Hailes (elevated to earl of Bothwell on 17 October).<br>
<br>Though the apparent nadir of Ramsay's career, the years 1488&#150;97 marked the most interesting phase of his life as client and agent of Henry VII; he had an annuity of 100 merks from Easter 1488 to Michaelmas 1496, in return for which Henry expected intelligence reports and loyal service. In April 1491 Henry entered into an agreement with James Stewart, earl of Buchan, and Sir Thomas Tod, with Ramsay acting as their guarantor, to try to capture James IV and his brother James, duke of Ross, one of a number of unsuccessful English schemes to preserve the Anglo-Scottish peace by undermining James IV. Ramsay's favour with Henry VII is evident from his joining the king's expedition to France in October&#150;November 1492.<br>
<br>Ramsay proved particularly useful to Henry VII when James IV sheltered Perkin Warbeck from November 1495 to July 1497. About March 1495 Ramsay accompanied Richard Fox, bishop of Durham, into northern England on a diplomatic&#150;intelligence mission, and the Scot returned home in late 1495 or early 1496, presumably as Henry's agent to uncover the details of the Warbeck plot. Despite being &#145;ondir respit and assurans within the realm of Scotland&#146;  (Ellis, 1.25), Ramsay was given considerable freedom to move around the country and travel to Berwick, and he received &pound;10 from Henry VII on 24 May and 15 July 1496. Two of Ramsay's letters to Henry in 1496 have survived, one written between 28 August and 2 September and the second dated 8 September; both allude to negotiations for an Anglo-Scottish treaty held at Berwick and involving Ramsay and Bishop Fox. The letters combine self-promotion, concerning Ramsay's plots to kidnap Warbeck and his efforts to persuade James to abandon the &#145;fenyt boy&#146; and make peace, with fairly accurate factual information on the Scottish military preparations (including the precise date of attack and James's shortages of money, supplies, and ordnance) and on Warbeck's treasonable dealings with various Englishmen, the French envoy, and Margaret of Burgundy's representative. The reports also contain more speculative and fanciful opinions on James IV's unpopularity with his subjects&#151;Ramsay asserts that an English military victory was assured if Henry took the offensive by land and sea. Perhaps the only remarkable aspect about the activities of Ramsay, who is vilified by Scottish historians for betraying James IV, is that he was so successful, managing to repay Henry VII's patronage while ingratiating himself with James IV. Any man who serves three kings and survives plots, rebellion, and exile has to possess some degree of tenacity, charisma, and an appearance of loyalty.<br>
<br>Ramsay accompanied James IV to Norham and Kintyre during 1497, being restored to royal favour by grant of remission and rehabilitation on 18 April. Between 27 April 1497 and 6 November 1500 he was rewarded for his good service with lands in Tealing and Polgavie in Angus, Terringzeane in Ayrshire, Kirkandrews, and Wigtown, and a house, garden, and other land in Cowgate, Edinburgh. In 1507 he inherited the ward, relief, and non-entries of the Corstoun lands by Janet Ramsay's death, while on 13 May 1510 James gave his knight of the body the barony of Balmain, and lands in Ely and Westir Strathe, &#145;for his good service and special favour&#146;. Ramsay was auditor of the exchequer in the early sixteenth century and a trusted privy councillor, and his knowledge of English affairs led to his appointment as envoy to Henry VIII on 24 January 1513. He was present on various occasions during Nicholas West's embassy to Scotland from March to April 1513. Given his earlier career, it is ironic that Ramsay died at Flodden on 9 September 1513; the exchequer rolls record the lease of land to William Ramsay, son of John Ramsay of Balmain, <i>qui obiit in bello</i>.<br>
