<span class="headword">Benn,  Margaret Eadie  Wedgwood</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Margaret Eadie Holmes]</span>, Viscountess Stansgate  (1897&#150;1991), <span class="occ">religious campaigner</span>, was born on 7 June 1897 in Paisley, the elder daughter of Daniel Turner Holmes (1863&#150;1955), the son of a tailor and steeplejack and himself a schoolmaster, lecturer, and Liberal MP for Govan (1911&#150;18), and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1953), daughter of Peter Eadie, sometime provost of Paisley. Religion and politics were the two themes running through her life. Rejecting her parents' agnosticism&#151;her father had left the Irvingites&#151;as a girl of six or seven she became an Episcopalian, attending church alone and finding religion a &#145;great comfort&#146;  (Stansgate, 22). Still unschooled and illiterate at the age of seven, she was belatedly educated at St Columba's School, Kilmalcolm, and, after her family moved to London following the 1911 election, at St Mary's, Lancaster Gate&#151;which she left because its high-church headmistress made the girls pray against disestablishment&#151;and at a school in Holland Park. She developed a passion for learning. She followed her father's Liberalism and by the age of twelve was a feminist. She and her mother were non-militant suffragist members of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. She rode in Hyde Park, &#145;came out&#146; shortly before the First World War, left school in 1915, took a secretarial course, worked in the new Ministry of Labour, and was confirmed an Anglican. After the war her parents refused her request to study for a theology diploma at St Hugh's College, Oxford, and she considered becoming a nun. Instead, on 17 November 1920 she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30705/', "William Wedgwood Benn (1877&#150;1960)")</script>. They had four sons, one of whom died at birth.<br>
<br>Following her marriage&#151;she wrote later that they were strongly mutually attracted but not in love&#151;Margaret Wedgwood Benn loyally supported her husband's political career and also, following his example, became teetotal. They sent their sons to public school so that they should be able to &#145;deal with the Tories&#146;  (Stansgate, 58). She later wrote in her autobiography, &#145;My main interest was, and is, theology&#146;  (ibid., 70), and while a young mother she studied the subject as an external non-examination student at King's College, London, learning Greek and Hebrew, and she met and formed a lasting friendship with the Congregationalist Elsie Dorothea Chamberlain. She long campaigned for the ordination of women, in 1922 clashing with Randall Davidson, archbishop of Canterbury, and in 1928 she was a founder of the interdenominational Society for the Ministry of Women. In 1927 with her husband she joined the Labour Party, and in the 1920s and 1930s they travelled extensively, visiting the USSR, the Near East, and the United States, where she met Henry Ford. During the Second World War she worked under the chaplain's department with servicewomen. She influenced her husband (created Viscount Stansgate in 1942), who was air secretary in the 1945 Labour government, to appoint in 1946 Elsie Chamberlain, who had become a Congregational minister, as the first female RAF chaplain. Long &#145;deeply ecumenical&#146;  (ibid., 50), Lady Stansgate in 1948 attended as an Anglican delegate the inaugural assembly of the World Council of Churches in Amsterdam. She protested against the limitation of the Anglican communion and Archbishop Fisher's refusal to allow Anglicans to participate in the conference communion, celebrated according to the reformed rite. This led her to join the Congregationalists, whose puritan principle of local church autonomy she continued to defend. She travelled with Stansgate, attending conferences of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, of which he was president, and met foreign leaders including Eisenhower, Ben Gurion, Ho Chi Minh, and Zhou Enlai.<br>
<br>After her husband's death in 1960 Lady Stansgate considered entering the ministry. With Elsie Chamberlain she refused to compromise and agree to the formation of the United Reformed church (Congregationalists and Presbyterians, 1972) and together they led the Nottingham-based &#145;rump&#146;, the Congregational Federation, of about 300 churches. Lady Stansgate was its first president. Like many keen Christians, she was fascinated by and sympathetic to Judaism and Jews, and was a Zionist. She was a vice-president of the Council of Christians and Jews. Her Hebrew studies reinforced her faith, and she was appreciated by Hebrew scholars. She helped raise funds in Britain for the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In 1975 the library at Mount Scopus was named after her, and in 1982 she was made an honorary fellow of the Hebrew University. She was formidable, kind, charming, and committed. Her sight failed, she suffered a series of strokes, and she died on 21 October 1991 at Goldsborough Nursing Home, 40&#150;42 Goldsborough Road, London. Her autobiography, <span class="italic">My Exit Visa</span>, was published posthumously with a postscript appreciation by her son the Labour politician Tony Benn.<br>
