<span class="headword">Colquhoun,  John Campbell</span>  (1785&#150;1854), <span class="occ">writer on animal magnetism</span>, was the third of five sons (there were four daughters) of Sir James Colquhoun of Luss, second baronet (1741&#150;1805), sheriff of Dumbarton and principal clerk of session, and his wife, Mary, daughter of James Falconer. He was born at Edinburgh on 31 January 1785 and was educated mainly at home. In 1804&#150;5 he attended law classes at Edinburgh University. He then studied Roman law at the University of G&ouml;ttingen, where he acquired a lasting interest in German literature and philosophy. He was called to the Scottish bar in 1806, and in 1815 was appointed sheriff-depute of Dunbartonshire, a post which he held until a few months before his death. An obituary in the <span class="italic">Dumbarton Herald</span> spoke of his &#145;accurate discrimination, and strict and undeviating impartiality&#146;.<br>
<br>Colquhoun's life, however, centred round Edinburgh, where he lived with his sister, Helen, at 10 Melville Street; he never married. His legal duties seem to have left him ample leisure for his literary and philosophical pursuits, and by 1820 he was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (he resigned about twenty years later). His particular interest was in animal magnetism (mesmerism), which, though little known in Britain, had been a topic of keen debate in Germany during his student days. Subsequently a medical friend, who wished him to take it up, from time to time sent him the latest French and German publications. After some experimentation and a great deal of reading, Colquhoun undertook a translation, published in 1833, of a report on the subject recently presented to the French Royal Academy of Medicine. To this he added a long introduction. In 1836 he expanded his introduction into a two-volume treatise, <span class="italic">Isis revelata</span>, which displayed a knowledge unparalleled in Britain both of the continental mesmeric literature, and of relevant classical and medical texts. He regarded mesmeric &#145;somnambulism&#146; as closely analogous to ordinary somnambulism. Colquhoun was particularly interested in cases of apparent clairvoyance, which he accepted somewhat uncritically and held to refute materialism.<br>
<br>The publication of <span class="italic">Isis</span> shortly preceded an upsurge of British interest in animal magnetism and Colquhoun was soon recognized as a leading authority. An enlarged second edition of <span class="italic">Isis</span> came out in 1844. Meanwhile he continued to pursue the subject. He vainly attempted to rouse medical interest, and in 1839 started a short-lived <span class="italic">Journal of Zoomagnetism</span>; in 1843 he wrote a pamphlet attacking &#145;phrenomesmerism&#146;; in 1845 he published a translation from the German of Arnold Wienholt's lectures on somnambulism, adding a long introduction discussing somnambulic clairvoyance; he had various controversies with James Braid, the pioneer of hypnotism, who disbelieved in a physical animal magnetism, and in 1851 he brought out a <span class="italic">History of Magic, Witchcraft and Animal Magnetism</span>, which treated the subject along lines foreshadowed in <span class="italic">Isis revelata</span>.<br>
<br>Though a man of great courtesy, Colquhoun was modest and rather reserved. But within his own intimate circle (which included Sir William Hamilton, the philosopher) he was regarded as an agreeable companion and a steady friend. He died at 10 Melville Street, in Edinburgh, on 21 August 1854 and was buried in Dean cemetery, Edinburgh.<br>
