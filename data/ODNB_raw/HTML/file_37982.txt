<span class="headword">Smith,  John Frederick</span>  (1806&#150;1890), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 12 March 1806 and baptized on 28 March 1806 at St Stephen's, Norwich, the son of James Smith, manager of the Norwich Theatre circuit, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1768), the widow of William Coatsworth (<i>d</i>. 1794). Elizabeth had had twin boys prior to her marriage to James Smith on 23 November 1801; these were always described as James Smith's sons, and in addition to these two brothers, John Frederick Smith had two sisters, one of whom died in infancy. Although the family was Anglican, Smith was educated at &#145;Mr Harvin's Presbyterian school&#146;, probably because of its liberal ethos and Unitarian leanings; it was favoured by many literati of Norwich. The early years of Smith's Bohemian adult life remain obscure, although it is known that he worked as an actor in England and travelled widely on the continent. Partly educated by a Jesuit, he spent some years in Rome, and rendered services to Pope Gregory XVI, but later he left the Roman Catholic church.<br>
<br>Smith had previously written some plays and two novels&#151;<span class="italic">The Jesuit</span> (1832) and <span class="italic">The Prelate</span> (1840)&#151;but his break came when he returned from a continental tour in 1849 to write for the <span class="italic">London Journal</span>. Smith raised the <span class="italic">Journal's</span> circulation to 100,000 copies that year, first with his short story &#145;Marianne, a Tale of the Temple&#146; and then with instalments of his most ambitious novel, <span class="italic">Stanfield Hall</span>. Subsequently published as a three-decker (1888&#150;9), the novel traces the fortunes of the Stanfield family from the middle ages to the Restoration, and combines historical romance, influenced by Sir Walter Scott, with anachronistic treatment of Victorian inventions. <span class="italic">Minnigrey</span> (1851&#150;2), illustrated by John Gilbert, is said to have increased sales of the <span class="italic">London Journal</span> to half a million copies, for which newsagents had to send special wagons to the station.<br>
<br>Other novels include <span class="italic">Amy Lawrence, the Freemason's Daughter</span> (1851), <span class="italic">Woman and her Master</span> (1854), <span class="italic">The City Banker</span> (1856), <span class="italic">Milly Mogue</span> (1859), <span class="italic">Warp and Weft</span> (1863), and <span class="italic">Sir Bernard Gaston</span> (1867). When Smith was enticed away to <span class="italic">Cassell's Illustrated Family Paper</span> in 1855 he ended his current story by blowing up all the main characters on a Mississippi steamboat. He returned to the <span class="italic">London Journal</span>, however, ten years later.<br>
<br>Smith's habit was to write in the printing office itself. He would closet himself with a bottle of port and a cigar or pipe, read the end of the previous instalment, and then write the next, drawing his fee when he handed over the text. He raised the tension from episode to episode until the mill girls of the north and midlands had to buy their own copies rather than wait to borrow one. But neither the formulaic quality of his fiction (virtue, for example, is always rewarded) nor the sensationalist action of the weekly instalments was suited to the form of the novel republished in volume format.<br>
<br>Although for a time earning the salary of a parliamentary under-secretary and writing thrilling romances of fashionable life, Smith lived quietly in a Bloomsbury lodging-house, cut off from society through his deafness. Later in life he moved to America, and there England's most popular novelist of the mid-nineteenth century died in obscurity and want, in March (before 4 March) 1890, in New York. He was unmarried.<br>
