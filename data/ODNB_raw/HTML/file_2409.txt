<span class="headword">Bingham,  John</span>  (1612/13&#150;1689), <span class="occ">ejected minister and classical and oriental scholar</span>, was born at Derby, the son of Henry Bingham. After attending Repton School from 1628, he was admitted sizar at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 10 June 1631, aged eighteen. Having moved to Magdalene College he graduated BA in 1636. When he was twenty-six a foot he had injured as a child had to be amputated and the trauma of this prematurely turned his hair white.<br>
<br>From 1640 to 1652 Bingham was master at the free school in Derby. He was an excellent classical and oriental scholar, fluent in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic. He published nothing under his own name, but assisted Brian Walton in the composition of the polyglot <span class="roman">Bible</span> (1657). For many years Bingham resisted pressure to take up pastoral responsibilities within the church, finally taking on a living only after considerable persuasion. Presented by William Cavendish, earl of Devonshire, to Marston upon Dove, Derbyshire, he was formally admitted on 28 October 1656. Over the next four years he &#145;constantly attended on the Classis of ministers that met at Derby&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.188). On 16 May 1661 he was married at Spondon to Elizabeth Bomford of Chaddesdon. They had one son who survived them, Thomas, a mercer at Derby.<br>
<br>Despite considerable enticement by Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon, a long-time acquaintance, Bingham felt unable to conform in 1662 and so was ejected from his living. The loss of such a scholar weighed heavily upon the church authorities. After the passing of the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> he moved to Bradley Hall, where for three years he &#145;taught several Gentlemen's sons, who Boarded with him&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.188), again a reflection of his considerable academic repute. He subsequently moved to Brailsford, where he was to remain for seven years. Here he and his family attended the parish church every Sunday morning but in the afternoon he preached at his own house &#145;to the numbers that was not prohibited by the <span class="roman">Act [of Uniformity]</span>&#146;. He subsequently incurred the wrath of the local incumbent, who proceeded to have him excommunicated. This sentence outraged parishioners and supporters and Bingham sought to defuse the situation by moving his household to Upper Thurvaston in the parish of Sutton, where he remained until his death. Edmund Calamy claimed he was licensed in 1672 to preach at Hollington, though his name is not included in the list of licences issued. When he was seventy Bingham broke his arm in a fall from his horse. His latter years were marked by frail and declining health, though he maintained his scholarly pursuits. He died on 3 February 1689, aged eighty-two according to Calamy, although his university record suggests this was an exaggeration. He was buried at Upper Thurvaston, with Mr Crompton preaching his funeral sermon.<br>
