<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Giles,  Ronald <span class="st"> [Carl]</span></span>  (1916&#150;1995), <span class="occ">cartoonist</span>, was born on 29 September 1916, at 413 City Road, near the Angel, Islington, London, the youngest son (there was a younger daughter) of Albert Edward Giles (<i>b</i>. 1881/2), tobacconist, &#145;a conscientious, decent and much-liked man&#146;  (Tory, <span class="italic">A Life</span>, 28), and his wife, Emma Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke (<i>b</i>. 1886/7), dressmaker. His paternal grandfather was Alfred Edmund &#145;Farmer&#146; Giles of Newmarket, Suffolk, a jockey who had ridden for Edward VII. His mother came from a Norfolk farming family. Giles's birth certificate registered him as Ronald. Known as Carl&#151;because his childhood haircut echoed that of the actor Boris Karloff&#151;the extrovert, already bespectacled Giles was educated at Barnsbury Park School, where his mischief was restrained by the sarcastic, skeletal Mr Chalk, a teacher who, as Chalky, later became one of his most enduring cartoon creations. On leaving school, aged about fourteen, Giles began work first as an office boy for 10<i>s</i>. a week and then as an animator at Superads in Charing Cross Road, London. Between 1930 and 1935 at Alexander Korda's studios in Elstree he was a principal animator, under the artist Anthony Gross, on <span class="italic">The Fox Hunt</span>, the first British animated colour cartoon with sound. He also helped to animate versions of Roland Davies's <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> strip &#145;Come on Steve&#146; (Steve was an amiable carthorse). Later, during the Second World War he helped to animate cartoons for the Ministry of Information.<br>
<br>In 1937, following the death of his brother Bert, Giles returned to London. There, at twenty-one, he joined the left-wing <span class="italic">Reynolds News</span>, for which, without any specific art training, he drew cartoons, illustrations and &#145;Young Ernie&#146;, a strip. The <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> editor John Gordon attempted to entice the reluctant artist&#151;&#145;I would be very unhappy if I changed&#146;  (Gordon)&#151;to his richer, then hugely successful, right-wing paper whose owner, Lord Beaverbrook, had recognized Giles's burgeoning genius. Eventually hooked, Giles was indeed briefly miserable, but when readers began expressing their enthusiasm for his work his confidence and enthusiasm returned.<br>
<br>On 14 March 1942, at St John's Church, East Finchley, Giles married (Sylvia) Joan Agnes Clarke (1918&#150;1994), his first cousin and childhood sweetheart. They had no children. She was a charming, practical woman of long but not unlimited patience. The couple moved from Islington to Edgware to Ipswich. Just after the war Giles bought Hillbrow Farm, a gloomy seventeenth-century farmhouse, soon to be brightly transformed, in the village of Witnesham, Suffolk. This was to be their permanent home.<br>
<br>Giles's first drawing for the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> was published on 3 October 1943. Later that month he became not only deputy cartoonist to Sidney Strube on the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> but also, perhaps surprisingly, the paper's war correspondent. Captain Giles, as he temporarily became, was an unmilitary figure, classified unfit for military service because of partial deafness caused some years before when, in a near fatal accident, his Panther 600 motorcycle had collided with an oncoming truck. Giles admired the First World War cartoons of Captain Bruce Bairnsfather, the creator of popular cartoons based on firsthand front-line experiences. With perky optimism Giles also drew on firsthand experience, a distillation which &#145;epitomised the spirit of the hour&#146;  (Tory, <span class="italic">The Ultimate Giles</span>, 64). In the aftermath of war Giles drew the grim interior of Fort Breendouk punishment camp, near Antwerp. The dark, uncharacteristic sketches are examples of unvarnished, visual reporting which at the artist's request were not published until 1994. In spite of editorial requests Giles could not bring himself to record the horrors of Belsen. He witnessed scenes which affected him profoundly for the rest of his life, and was brought to a deeper maturity. Although less meaningful to later generations, Giles's wartime cartoons were among his funniest, particularly his &#145;GI Joes&#146;, for whom in real life he had a strong (and reciprocated) affection.<br>
<br>Strube left the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> in 1948. Thereafter Giles, dealing with social subjects, alternated with the young right-wing political cartoonist Michael Cummings. During the fifties Giles's work grew in strength. Here was artist, architect, and jokester who drew, among many excellent things, landscapes&#151;particularly snow scenes&#151;of a high and, for his fellow cartoonists, enviable order. Panoramic settings filled with accurate detail of place, people, and atmosphere brought new qualities and a wider vision to British cartooning, influencing his contemporaries including Jak 
    (Raymond Jackson; 1927&#150;1997)
   and Mac 
    (Stanley McMurtry; <i>b</i>. 1936)
  . Giles fits comfortably into a tradition stretching from Rowlandson to Dicky Doyle. He was also influenced by Pont 
    (Graham Laidler; 1908&#150;1940)
  , whose famous series in <span class="italic">Punch</span>, &#145;The British character&#146;, was based on upper middle-class types, benignly but unerringly observed. In his short life Pont was always the amused spectator rather than angry satirist, an attitude Giles took to heart. The artist's most-loved creation, the Giles family, made its first appearance in the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> on 5 August 1945. The family's common humanity&#151;children's mischief, for example, is not limited by class&#151;had a wide social appeal. For four decades Mother, Father, young Ernie, daughter Ann and her terrible twins, bookworm George (Sartre and Orwell) and his sniffling, aspirin-riddled wife Vera and their son, George junior, Ann's younger sisters Bridget and Susan, their Airedale Butch (and a permanent visitor, young Stinker with his ever present camera and wet-mop haircut) were dominated by their granite-tough, invincible Grandma, who invariably wore ankle-length black bombazine and an alarming frown. She clutched a parrot-knobbed brolly and a padlocked handbag, both of which could be used as weapons if needed. Grandma, among other things, was irascible, pugnacious, fearless, bloody-minded, a &#145;small c&#146; conservative socialist, outrageous yet patriotic, anarchic and somehow endearing. Friends noted Giles's spiritual resemblance to his creation, a likeness later compounded in photographs taken in his later years revealing a facial resemblance both touching and quietly comic. The family remained unaltered for forty years: the kids did not grow up and Grandma and the others did not grow older. Instead, the world changed around them while they observed and reacted to it.<br>
<br>The making of three large cartoons a week, taking from eight to ten hours each, required a self-discipline not always manifest in Giles's life. They were drawn in a large studio suite in Ipswich and when finished were forwarded, often late, by train to London or by taxi if the trains were not running or by helicopter if the weather put both beyond reach. Deadlines were held in contempt, an attitude which did not endear Giles to the frantic newspaper staff trying to put the paper to bed.<br>
<br>Joan Giles once admitted that marriage to this complex, contradictory man was like having &#145;at least five husbands&#146;: the cartoonist, the engineer, the designer and builder, the pig-breeder, and the car enthusiast. She added, &#145;All my husbands have one thing in common&#151;fairly regular lapses into vagrancy&#146;  (J. Giles, 1955). With fame and a much-increased income he was able to indulge himself. For a time he motored, mostly around the UK, in a huge mobile studio-cum-caravan which he designed and built himself. He bought and raced a Jaguar XK120 at Silverstone in 1952; he owned a Bentley Mulsanne, a Range Rover, a Land Rover, and a much-loved Nicholson 38 yacht. Although shamelessly hedonistic&#151;a man's man, and apparently irresistible to women&#151;his warmth and humour were often overwhelmed by an abrasive grumpiness. &#145;A sometimes dark and snarling beast&#146;  (Tory, <span class="italic">A Life</span>, 36) seemed to lurk behind these sudden, surprising, often unwarranted outbursts of irascibility. He was severely critical of authority and authoritarian figures&#151;of anything or anyone who hampered him in his pursuits. Generous by nature, Giles nevertheless had difficulty in expressing the compassion which formed the bedrock of his nature and which came across so clearly in his cartoons. A genuinely modest man, Giles avoided talking about himself or his work, which he believed spoke for itself. He was a left-winger who bought expensive grown-up toys, smoked huge cigars, yet never abandoned his roots&#151;to which he returned often and noisily, travelling from pub to pub to do so. His friendships ranged from the many eccentrics, acquaintances, and drinking companions near home to Prince Philip, Prince Charles&#151;the royal family owns a large collection of Giles originals&#151;and Max Aitken (Lord Beaverbrook's son) away from it. He enjoyed the company of the famous and successful if they were honestly forthright in their views and could share his love of horses, cars, and sailing.<br>
<br>Giles drew more than 7000 cartoons for the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> and <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> and a Giles annual appeared every year from 1946. It was on the covers of his annuals, and in the ornate, coloured Christmas cards he drew for his favourite charity, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI)&#151;of which he was made president for life&#151;and for the Royal National Institute for the Blind that he was able to produce comic masterpieces in which he returned to the pleasures of drawing at a more leisurely pace than newspaper deadlines allowed him, with accurate detail and superbly composed crowd scenes. Of Giles's entire output it has been said: &#145;For the historian of the second half of the 20th century his work will be indispensable&#146;  (L. Lambourne, <span class="italic">Giles: Mirror of an Age</span>, 1993, exhibition catalogue).<br>
<br>During his last decade Giles suffered seriously from encroaching physical disabilities. Weakening eyesight, increasing deafness, and worsening blood circulation, the latter brought on by heavy smoking, inevitably affected his work, although Giles at his weakest was better than many cartoonists at their best. He was treated to typical Fleet Street insensitivity in his final months with the <span class="italic">Express</span>, and in 1989, after forty-seven years, he quit with a succinct: &#145;I just thought, sod this.&#146; In the following year further problems with his circulation resulted in both legs being amputated just below the knee.<br>
<br>Giles was appointed OBE in 1959. He was a founder member in 1966, and later president, of the British Cartoonists' Association (BCA); in 1990 he was awarded a senior fellowship of the Royal College of Art, and in 1993 a large retrospective exhibition was organized by the Cartoon Art Trust (CAT): collections of his work are held by the trust, and at the Cartoon Study Centre at the University of Kent. When guest of honour at a luncheon at London's Garrick Club on 24 March 1993, given by the BCA to honour his fifty years in the business, Giles, in his wheelchair&#151;attended always by his &#145;minder&#146; Big Louis&#151;chatted amiably throughout the meal. His afflictions were never mentioned, except once, when he gazed at his then less than flexible fingers and said, &#145;I hope I can begin to draw again&#146;. His words were spoken wistfully and without self-pity and were painful to hear. At the end of the meal the chairman rose to speak but Giles interrupted. &#145;Forget the speeches&#146;, he said. &#145;Let's go to the pub&#146;.<br>
<br>At seventy-eight Carl Giles&#151;who had given (and taken) so much pleasure in his lifetime, an active man living a physically diminished life&#151;was grief-stricken when his wife Joan died on Christmas day 1994. In spite of the consolation offered by his many friends Giles died eight months later at Ipswich Hospital on 27 August 1995. His funeral was held at Tuddenham church, Suffolk, and there was a memorial service in London at St Bride's, Fleet Street. A statue of Grandma, Vera, and Butch the dog was unveiled in Ipswich in 1993, while at Felixstowe the support and rescue boat <i>Grandma</i> was launched in May 1999.<br>
