<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Horsfall,  Thomas Coglan</span>  (1841&#150;1932), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born in Manchester on 23 May 1841, the only son among the four children of William Horsfall (1806&#150;1871), a Manchester cotton mill owner and latterly vice-chairman of the Manchester and County Bank, and his wife, Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coglan. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Coglan (<i>d</i>. 1841), a Unitarian and Liberal, was a native of Dublin who moved to Liverpool and established a prosperous stocks and share brokering business. His paternal grandfather, George Horsfall (<i>d</i>. 1846), a descendant of Yorkshire woollen industry cardmakers, ran Horsfall &amp; Son in Halifax.<br>
<br>In the 1840s and 1850s Horsfall's family moved from Moss Side and Chorlton upon Medlock, via Rusholme, to Dunham Massey near Altrincham, a trajectory that reflected their increasing wealth and rising status. Horsfall was educated at small private schools in Manchester and Bowdon, the last being that of the young John Meiklejohn, later a leading educationist, who became a lifelong friend and influence. Horsfall went into almost silent partnership in a patent card manufacturing business in the cotton industry with his brother-in-law, Spencer H. Bickham, and his father's former manager, James Naylor, first at Bridgewater Street and by 1873, with Bickham, at Wellington Mill, Pendleton. On 3 January 1878 he married Frances Emma (<i>d</i>. 1927), the daughter of Henry Reeves, formerly of the Indian Civil Service; they had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>A fluent reader (but not speaker) of French and German, Horsfall travelled extensively on the continent, a habit he had formed from his parents. In 1864 he sailed to Australia. He nurtured an early love of the Lake District through his association in later life with Hardwicke Rawnsley, one of the founders of the National Trust, and John Ruskin, the art and social critic, the most important intellectual influence on his life. The two met, and fruitfully corresponded, though Ruskin never shared Horsfall's faith in urban reform. Horsfall was the most prominent member of the first Ruskin society (Society of the Rose) established in Manchester in 1878.<br>
<br>Never enjoying robust health, Horsfall took a back seat in the business partnership and formally retired in 1886. Although he lived outside Manchester, at Alderley Edge in the 1880s and from 1889 for over thirty years in Swanscoe Hall, near Macclesfield, his main interests were focused on improving the civic life of Manchester. He was involved in almost every social reform movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, at different times collaborating with the Manchester civic activists Charles Rowley and T. R. Marr. He was honorary secretary of the Association of Working Men's Clubs in Manchester, he campaigned for smoke abatement through the Noxious Vapours Association, for improved dwellings for Manchester's workers, for open space, and for recreational Sundays, and he was an active member of the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association (founded in 1852).<br>
<br>An Anglican and a Liberal, and from 1886 a Liberal Unionist, Horsfall was a member of Manchester's Church Reform Union, and wrote pamphlets arguing, in an essentially Ruskinian spirit, that it was the Christian duty of the church to take the lead in providing for the poor. His unique contribution to Manchester life came in the shape of his Art Museum, founded in 1877, but permanently established in the impoverished East End district of Ancoats from 1886. A popular and educational art museum inspired by Ruskin's St George's Museum in Sheffield, its influence was extended by Horsfall to local schoolchildren. He obtained an amendment to the education code, after a meeting of the School Managers' Conference in 1894, that for the first time permitted schoolchildren to visit museums, art galleries, historic buildings, and botanical gardens in school hours as part of their education. His conviction was that through an exposure to, and the appreciation of, beauty in art working people could be saved from the dangers of the pub and the vulgarities of the music hall. The Art Museum's activities were extended to encompass evening classes, musical concerts, poetry recitals, and amateur dramatics. The Art Museum had close affinities with the work of Toynbee Hall in London's Whitechapel, whose founders, the Barnetts, were counted among Horsfall's personal friends. In 1896 Horsfall's museum was amalgamated with the Manchester University settlement, of which he served as president for over twenty years. His contribution to Manchester's civic life was recognized in 1902 when he was made an honorary MA of the Victoria University.<br>
<br>From the early twentieth century Horsfall, who had grown frustrated by the haphazard nature of voluntary schemes for improvement, became significant nationally as the leading British exponent of German approaches to town planning. His admiration of German culture stemmed from a close early attachment to his uncle by marriage Tobias Theodores (1808&#150;1886), a scholar of Prussian extraction who was professor of oriental and modern languages at Owens College and warden of the Reform synagogue at Manchester. Horsfall advanced the merits of mandatory municipal controls, physical discipline, compulsory military training, continuation classes, and the sharing of civic space by all classes. Increasingly linking urban division to the deteriorating health and character of the British poor, his promotion of German solutions to the achievement of the ideal city drew the attention of influential figures to the merits of town planning, among them Raymond Unwin. Horsfall wrote in <span class="italic">The Improvement of the Dwellings and Surroundings of the People</span> (1904):<blockquote>The German towns contain a much larger proportion of tall, well-developed men and women than do the English towns, and in no large German towns is it possible to find such masses of undersized, ill-developed and sickly-looking people as are to be found in the poorer districts of London, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham and all other large British towns. (p. 161)</blockquote>During the First World War, which claimed his son, (Henry) Frank, and a son-in-law, Horsfall became isolated from the German friends and ideas that had inspired him. By 1919 the level of his personal philanthropy had grown to include 187 donations and subscriptions to different charities and institutions, and he particularly advocated musical education. Old age, reduced circumstances, increasing deafness, and general debility brought about his retirement from public life and his settlement from 1921 or 1922 in Ridgeways, a recently built house in Wellingtonia Avenue, Finchampstead, Berkshire, where his wife died in 1927. Horsfall died on 31 January 1932 at Toutley Hall, Winnersh, Berkshire, the home of the eldest of his three daughters. He and his wife were buried at nearby St James's Church, Finchampstead, where their grave is marked by a mounted stone cross.<br>
<br>Horsfall felt frustrated in his final years that he had not achieved the extent of reform in civic life that he had sought, his advocacy of compulsion essentially going against the grain of British culture. Inspired partly by William Morris (whom he met and with whom he corresponded), but particularly by Ruskin, Horsfall pioneered a range of social improvements in Manchester, most of them centred on his Art Museum. More generally he helped to inspire and influence British educational reformers and the founding town planners of the twentieth century.<br>
