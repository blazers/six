<span class="headword">Furnese, Sir  Henry</span>, first baronet  (1658&#150;1712), <span class="occ">politician and financier</span>, was born at Sandwich, Kent, on 30 May 1658, the eldest son of Henry Furnese (<i>d</i>. 1672) of Sandwich and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1696), the daughter of Andrew Gosfright of Sandwich. Augustan satirists made much of Furnese's humble origins, but his father married the daughter of a former mayor of Sandwich, and tales of a penurious upbringing seem to rest on his father's bankruptcy. In the year of his father's death Furnese was apprenticed to one of his Gosfright uncles, a London hosier. Many of the Gosfright clan traded to Flanders and Italy, and Furnese followed in their footsteps. He had prospered sufficiently to marry, on 11 November 1684, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1695), the daughter of Robert Brough, a linen draper of St Lawrence Jewry. The marriage, which produced one son, <a href="#cosubject_63008">Robert Furnese [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was conducted by the prominent nonconformist divine Edmund Calamy sen., although it was recorded in the parish register of St Lawrence Jewry.<br>
<br>The outbreak of the Nine Years' War in 1689 increased Furnese's opportunities for making money: he clothed several regiments, lent money to the government, and even used his superior communications network on the continent to win several wagers on the progress of the war. He was knighted on 8 October 1691. He was appointed to the London lieutenancy in February 1694 and, having subscribed &pound;3000, was elected to the first directorate of the newly formed Bank of England. Furnese gradually increased his role in public finance, particularly as an agent for remitting funds to the army on the continent. Following the death of his wife in 1695, on 1 December 1697 he married Matilda (<i>d</i>. 1732), the daughter of Sir Thomas Vernon and the widow of Anthony Balam; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1698 Furnese was instrumental in ensuring that the new East India Company loan of &pound;2 million to the government was quickly subscribed. However, it was his East India connection which cut short his first attempt at a career in parliament. Having been elected for Bramber at the 1698 election, on 14 February 1699 he was unseated on the grounds that his role as a receiver and manager of the East India loan made him a placeman. He served as sheriff of London in 1700&#150;01 and secured election to the Commons for Sandwich in January 1701. Again his tenure of a seat in the Commons was short. On 19 February 1701 he was expelled for being a trustee for circulating exchequer bills. After resigning as a trustee he was re-elected for Sandwich in December 1701, and voted consistently with the whigs.<br>
<br>Following the succession of Anne and the renewal of the war with France, Furnese was regularly used as a remittancer of funds to the army. Indeed, in 1705 he negotiated a six-month contract granting him a monopoly of all remittances to the Netherlands, Germany, and Portugal. His commission was 11<i>s</i>. per &pound;100. A further reward for this service was a baronetcy, created on 27 June 1707. Such was his dominance of the remittancing business that in 1709 James Craggs the younger thought it &#145;not only a difficult, but a dangerous matter to oppose his schemes&#146;  (Craggs to J. Stanhope, 3 Aug 1709, Kent Archives Office, Stanhope MS U1590/0139/9/71/3).<br>
<br>The fall of the Godolphin administration in August 1710 placed Furnese in a quandary, as he came under whig pressure not to deal with the incoming tory ministry. But the new ministry had already begun to ease him out of the remittance business, and he signed his last contract in November 1710. Meanwhile he was re-elected to parliament, where he continued to vote with the whigs. As a prominent supporter of the previous ministry and a moneyed man to boot, Furnese was an obvious target for those tories intent on investigating the misdeeds of whig finance. However, he avoided any such attacks before his death, his accounts being passed by his son in 1718. Furnese died of a &#145;violent colic&#146;, at his seat at Waldershare, Kent, on 30 November 1712. His will instructed that he be buried at St Peter's, Sandwich, and that a monument be erected to &#145;God's great goodness to me in advancing me to a considerable estate from a very small beginning&#146;, and his son duly saw to it, commissioning a &#145;towering mass of marble, with its seated female figures, cherubs, and ammonite-like volutes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Archaeologia Cantiana</span>, 62, 1949, 69).<br>
<br>Furnese was succeeded as second baronet by his only son, <a name="cosubject_63008"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert Furnese</span>  (1687&#150;1733), <span class="occ">politician</span>, who was born on 1 August 1687. He was educated at Eton College and then travelled in Germany. He was licensed to marry his stepsister Anne (<i>d</i>. 1713), the daughter of Anthony Balam, on 1 October 1708; they had one daughter. Having been abroad during the 1708 election, Furnese secured a seat in the Commons at a by-election for Truro on 16 December 1708. He voted for the impeachment of Sacheverell in 1710. In the election that year he was returned for New Romney, and again voted with the whigs. The death of his father left Furnese a very rich man, and his second marriage (on 8 July 1714), to Arabella Watson (1693&#150;1727), the daughter of the third Baron Rockingham, reflected his increased status. The couple had a son (who eventually became the third baronet) and a daughter. Furnese was not much interested in trade or finance, being content to live off his extensive inheritance. He continued to support the whigs, but joined Robert Walpole in opposition in 1717. With Walpole in power he returned to the government fold, and in 1727 was elected knight of the shire for Kent. He was married for a third time on 15 May 1729. His new wife was Lady Anne Shirley (<i>d</i>. 1779), the daughter of Robert, first Earl Ferrers; they had two daughters, one of whom predeceased her father. Furnese died on 14 March 1733 of a cold, made worse by a bout of heavy drinking &#145;that he was not sober for ten days before he was taken ill&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 3.15). His monument paid tribute to his parliamentary service, as well as his &#145;affable behaviour and liberal spirit&#146;  (Parsons, 402&#150;3).<br>
