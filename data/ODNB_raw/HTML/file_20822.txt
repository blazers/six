<span class="headword">O'Reilly,  Hugh</span> <span class="st"> [Aodh &Oacute; Raghallaigh]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1581&#150;1653), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Armagh</span>, was born in co. Cavan in Ireland, the son of Maolm&oacute;rdha Mac Aodh &Oacute; Raghallaigh and his wife, M&oacute;r. He was sufficiently closely related to the principal family of the &Oacute; Raghallaigh or O'Reillys of east Breifne to have been eligible for election to the chieftainship under the Gaelic system of <i>deirbhfhine</i>. Until 1611 his father lived at Ballintemple in the barony of Clonmahon in central co. Cavan. These lands became part of the Ulster plantation, and the family was moved to 300 acres of poorer land in Tullyhaw in the west of the county. Aodh's early education was in co. Cavan, possibly under Franciscan auspices in the convent of St Mary in Cavan town. He was ordained a priest in Ireland and then went to continue his education on the continent. In 1618 he was studying philosophy at Rouen, and he later studied theology at Paris before going to Rome. Irish was his first language, and he knew Latin well. He probably learned English only as an adult.<br>
<br>O'Reilly's appointment as Roman Catholic bishop of his native diocese of Kilmore was provided for on 30 May 1625, and he was consecrated in July 1626 at the church of St Peter, Drogheda, by Thomas Fleming, archbishop of Dublin. He was transferred to the archiepiscopal see of Armagh on 11 August 1628. Even as primate, he continued to live in the Lough Uachtair district, close to Kilmore, in the neighbourhood in which he had spent his youth. The first resident primate of Ireland for almost two generations, he was well regarded by Rome and maintained cordial relations with both the hierarchy and the religious orders at home. He maintained a particularly close working relationship with prominent members of the Franciscan order. He was a supporter of the researches of the Irish Franciscans at Louvain into the lives of Irish saints, and in 1645 financed the publication of the first volume of John Colgan's <span class="italic">Acta sanctorum Hiberniae</span>. The work is dedicated to him.<br>
<br>O'Reilly was a reforming prelate anxious to implement the decrees of the Council of Trent. He has been judged a zealous churchman working in the interests of the Catholic church in Ireland. He presided at synods in his diocese in July 1632 and in 1637. After the outbreak of the uprising in 1641 he presided at the synod held at Kells in 1642 at which the foundations were laid for the Catholic confederation of Kilkenny. He spent time in Kilkenny, particularly in 1643, while serving on the supreme council of the confederation. He was among the influential members of the council until the first Ormond peace treaty of 1646, but was not politically active thereafter. At the time of his death on Trinity Island, co. Cavan, near his lifelong home, in February 1653 when he was said to be in his seventy-second year, O'Reilly was the only resident Roman Catholic bishop in Ireland.<br>
