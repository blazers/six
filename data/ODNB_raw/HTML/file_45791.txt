<span class="headword">Crawford,  Isabella Valancy</span>  (1850&#150;1887), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 25 December 1850 in Dublin, the sixth of the twelve children of Stephen Dennis Crawford (1807&#150;1875) and Sydney Scott. Isabella studied English, Latin, and French and began writing from a young age. Her childhood was one of financial insecurity and domestic upheaval, however, largely owing to her father's alcoholism and financial irresponsibility. The Crawford family endured poverty, hardship, and tragedy: only three children survived to adulthood&#151;Isabella Valancy, Emma Naomi, and Stephen Walter.<br>
<br>About 1857, in search of better prospects, Stephen Crawford moved his family to Paisley, Ontario, where, despite questionable qualifications, he became the village doctor. Following his conviction for embezzling public funds while township treasurer, in 1862 he moved his family to North Drouro (now Lakefield), Ontario, where Isabella became acquainted with the literary sisters Susannah Moodie and Catherine Parr Traill. The Crawfords moved once more in 1868, to Peterborough, Ontario, where Isabella's father and sister Emma died within six months of each other in 1875.<br>
<br>Before her father's death Crawford had begun writing commercially to augment the family income, and from 1872 her short stories, fairy tales, and romances were published in a variety of American and then Canadian magazines and newspapers, including <span class="italic">Fireside Weekly</span>, the <span class="italic">Toronto Globe</span>, and the <span class="italic">Toronto Evening Telegram</span>. Her current literary reputation is based primarily on her poetry, and particularly on the one book she published during her lifetime: <span class="italic">Old Spookes' Pass, Malcolm's Katie, and other Poems</span> (1884). This collection of narrative and lyric poems received critical but not commercial success&#151;published at Crawford's expense, it sold only fifty copies out of the 1000 that James Bain &amp; Son had commissioned. <span class="italic">Malcolm's Katie</span>&#151;arguably her best poem&#151;illustrates Crawford's fascination with native mythology and her use of anthropomorphic imagery by placing a conventional love story about two young sweethearts in the context of Indian legend. Other poems that demonstrate her empathy with the Canadian landscape and native culture include &#145;The Camp of Souls&#146; (published 1880), &#145;The Canoe&#146; (1884), &#145;The Dark Stag&#146; (1905), and &#145;Said the West Wind&#146; (1905). <span class="italic">Old Spookes' Pass</span>, a narrative poem written in cowboy dialect, describes a supernatural encounter that takes place during a midnight cattle stampede. &#145;Gisli the Chieftain&#146; makes use of myth&#151;this time Russian and Icelandic&#151;to tell a tale of love, betrayal, murder, and ultimate forgiveness, and again conveys Crawford's view of the universe as a place of destructive opposites that clash until reconciled by love. Good and evil, shadow and light, winter and summer, life and death: all these feature in her poetry as much as nature imagery and native legend.<br>
<br>Though Crawford is now recognized as one of Canada's most important nineteenth-century poets, she did not live to enjoy either financial or critical success, dying suddenly of a heart attack at her small flat at 57 John Street, Toronto, on 12 February 1887. An edition of Crawford's collected poems appeared in 1905 by John Garvin, who took liberties with her text; it was reprinted in 1972 with a new introduction by James Reaney. In 1923 Katherine Hale produced a selected anthology which reproduced some of the infelicities of Garvin's edition. <span class="italic">Hugh and Ion</span>, an unfinished narrative poem, was edited by Glenn Clever in 1977. Crawford's prose largely remains unpublished, with the exception of that reproduced in <span class="italic">Selected Stories</span> (1975) and <span class="italic">Fairy Tales</span> (1977), both edited by Penny Petrone, and <span class="italic">The Halton Boys: a Story for Boys</span> (1979), by Frank M. Tierney.<br>
