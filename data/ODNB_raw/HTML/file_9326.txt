<span class="headword">Ferguson,  Robert</span>  (1799&#150;1865), <span class="occ">physician and accoucheur</span>, was born in India on 15 November 1799, the son of Robert Ferguson of Glen Islay, Perthshire, of the Indian Civil Service, and great-nephew of the historian Adam Ferguson. He went to school in Croydon under Alexander Crombie (1762&#150;1840) and later began to study medicine as a pupil of George Ricketts Nuttall, with whom he lived in Dean Street, Soho. He attended lectures at the famous Hunterian School of Anatomy in Great Windmill Street, before spending some time studying in Heidelberg where among other things he gained a good knowledge of German. Returning to Edinburgh he joined the medical classes there and obtained his MD degree on 1 August 1823. While in Edinburgh, through his family connections, he became friendly with Sir Walter Scott. When Ferguson decided to settle in London as a medical practitioner Scott's son-in-law Dr John Gibson Lockhart gave him an introductory letter to the publisher John Murray, of Albemarle Street, through whom he became familiar with many in the London literary world.<br>
<br>Ferguson was next appointed as a resident medical officer at the Marylebone Infirmary before becoming physician to the Westminster Lying-In Hospital. He was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 22 December 1824 and concentrated on the practice of midwifery, aided by the patronage of Robert Gooch. In 1829 King's College, London, was founded by a royal charter under the patronage of George IV for the purpose of maintaining the connection between sound religion and useful learning. According to its original constitution, a department of medicine was to be included. Accordingly in 1831 the new department was established and, among the first professors appointed, Ferguson became professor of midwifery. He played an active role in the development of the new school and in 1836 gave the inaugural lecture at the beginning of the term entitled &#145;The method of induction and its results in medical science&#146;. The need for a hospital where students could obtain their clinical training and experience was obvious, and so in 1839 the first King's College Hospital was founded and established on the site of the old St Clement Danes workhouse in Portugal Street close to Lincoln's Inn Fields and adjacent to the Royal College of Surgeons. Ferguson became the first professor of midwifery and diseases of women and children. He attended regularly to teach students and to attend patients who came from one of the poorest areas of London.<br>
<br>Ferguson was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1837 and later councillor and censor. In 1840 he was appointed physician accoucheur to Queen Victoria. The queen's first child was born on 10 November 1840 and Ferguson acted as second in command to Charles Locock. The queen had expressed a wish that as few people as possible should be present in the room during her labour so that only Locock, Prince Albert, and Mrs Lilley were present. It was only when the baby was about to be born that a door opened and Ferguson, together with Sir James Clark and Dr Blagdon, was allowed in. It is recorded that for his services Ferguson received a fee of &pound;800. In the following year he resigned his appointment as professor of midwifery at King's and in 1844 he was appointed consultant physician.<br>
<br>In spite of developing an extensive obstetric practice and having contributed extensively to obstetric literature, in 1857 Ferguson took the bold step of becoming a general physician and resigned his position as physician accoucheur. His patients were to include many of the leaders in the politics and literature of his day. Many of them became his personal friends; apart from Sir Walter Scott, they included William Wordsworth, Henry Taylor, Washington Irving, Lord Palmerston, and Lord Derby. According to a contemporary Ferguson:<blockquote>was extremely fastidious and courtly in manner, and throughout life looked upon his own profession as one that was hardly good enough for him; his heart was with the army, and he deeply felt the annoyances to which a mere &#145;doctor&#146; was subjected to by exclusion from the higher ranks and dignities of the realm. (<span class="italic">Lancet</span>, 1865, 25)</blockquote>Earlier in his career Ferguson compiled two volumes in Murray's family library entitled <span class="italic">The Natural History of Insects</span> (1829&#150;35) and for the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span> he wrote ten articles from 1829 to 1854. Most of these were medical but one or two of a philosophico-religious kind. His first publication, in 1825, was a letter to Sir Henry Halford proposing a combination of the old inoculation of smallpox with vaccination. He founded the <span class="italic">London Medical Gazette</span> in 1827 and two of his most distinguished obstetric contributions were on diseases of the uterus and ovaria and puerperal fever. He wrote an introductory essay for the New Sydenham Society in 1859.<br>
<br>Ferguson was married twice, first in 1830 to a lady of the French family of Labalmondiere and second, on 15 May 1846, to Mary Lowther, daughter of Macleod of Dunvegan, with whom he had five children. On retirement from medical practice he lived in a cottage at Winkfield, Berkshire, where he died on 25 June 1865. He was survived by his wife. Ferguson's library was sold by Messrs Puttick and Simpson in March 1866.<br>
