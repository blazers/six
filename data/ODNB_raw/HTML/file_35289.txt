<span class="headword">O'Doherty,  Kevin Izod</span>  (1823&#150;1905), <span class="occ">politician and physician</span>, was born in Gloucester Street, Dublin, on 7 September 1823, the son of William Izod O'Doherty, solicitor, and his wife, Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> McEvoy, and was baptized at the Roman Catholic church of St Andrew. He was educated at Dr Wall's school, Hume Street, Dublin, and began medical training, first at the medical school, Cecilia Street, Dublin, from November 1842 until April 1843. He was an assistant in St Mark's Ophthalmic Hospital for diseases of the eyes and ears (December 1845 &#150; July 1847), and a clinical practising assistant in the Meath Hospital, Dublin (October 1847 &#150; May 1848). His subsequent life fell into four phases: Young Ireland and transportation to Australia; qualification, medical practice, and Queensland politics from the mid-1850s to 1885; a brief incursion into Ireland's political arena in the mid-1880s; and a relatively obscure resumption of private life in Brisbane after 1888.<br>
<br>In May 1843 O'Doherty became associated with the Young Ireland movement and contributed to its newspaper, <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, then under the stewardship of Charles Gavan Duffy; he was also a founder of the students' and polytechnic clubs, which opposed the policies of Daniel O'Connell. When John Mitchel seceded from <span class="italic">The Nation</span> and advocated revolution, O'Doherty, who although essentially a moderate had been radicalized by the experience of treating patients suffering from famine diseases, followed him to support the confederation and contributed to Mitchel's new journal, the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span>. When this was suppressed, O'Doherty co-founded a successor newspaper, <span class="italic">The Tribune</span>, which first appeared on 10 June 1848. Five weeks later the paper was seized and O'Doherty along with several colleagues was arrested on 8 or 9 July and charged with treason-felony. After three trials an all-protestant jury found him guilty on 3 October 1849 and O'Doherty was given the extended sentence of transportation for ten years to Van Diemen's Land. He arrived in Hobart Town on 31 October 1849.<br>
<br>Like other transported political prisoners, O'Doherty enjoyed comparative freedom: he was granted a ticket-of-leave and allowed to settle in the Oatlands district, where he continued his medical studies. In November 1850 O'Doherty was given permission to transfer to Hobart, where he worked with a local physician and became manager of the dispensary. During this period he regularly met his fellow exiles. One meeting discovered in December 1850 led to confinement for three weeks in January 1851 in a prison colony where he was obliged to &#145;split shingles&#146; alongside ordinary criminals. From August 1851 to September 1853 O'Doherty was acting surgeon at St Mary's Hospital, Hobart, and then in autumn that year he moved to Huon River, though he proved unable to develop a successful medical practice there.<br>
<br>In March 1855 it was announced that O'Doherty would be given a conditional pardon, which forbade residence in the United Kingdom. Before departing for Europe he and P. J. Smyth travelled to the Australian gold fields. In 1855 he went to Paris, where he studied surgery for a year at the Pitie hospital and then anatomy for a further six months. In 1855 he made a surreptitious trip to London to marry (on 23 August) the nationalist poet Mary Anne Kelly [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35290/', "O'Doherty, Mary Anne (1830&#150;1910)")</script>], &#145;Eva of <i>The Nation</i>&#146;, to whom he had become engaged in spring 1848, before his conviction. They went through another marriage ceremony in Paris on 30 November, to avoid the detection of his violation of the terms of his conditional pardon. Kelly had declined O'Doherty's offer to release her from the engagement following his sentence. He received a pardon the following year and returned to Ireland, where he became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and Physicians of Ireland in June 1857. O'Doherty practised in Dublin until emigrating in 1860 first to New South Wales, then to Ipswich, Queensland, for three years before settling in 1865 in Brisbane, where he became a leading physician. He was an early president of the Queensland Medical Society and carried out extensive honorary work at Catholic hospitals. Between 1867 and 1873 he was a member for Brisbane in the legislative assembly of Queensland, where he was responsible in 1872 for the first <span class="roman">Health Act</span>. From May 1877 to 1885 he was a member of the Queensland legislative council, where he sponsored the bill to stop the recruitment of Kanakas. In November 1882 he was made surgeon-major of the Queensland volunteer force. He remained active in Irish affairs: he established the Queensland Hibernian Society in 1871 and was president of the Irish Australian Convention in 1883.<br>
<br>On returning to Ireland in 1885 O'Doherty received a rapturous reception and was granted the freedom of Dublin. At the request of Charles Stewart Parnell he stood as nationalist parliamentary candidate for North Meath at the general election in 1885 and was returned unopposed on 27 November but did not stand again at the general election in July 1886.<br>
<br>Having been unable to establish a successful medical practice, O'Doherty returned to Brisbane in 1888 but failed to recover his position. In 1892 he was appointed surgeon to the central board of health and also was supervisor of the quarantine station, posts which brought him &pound;250 per annum. He suffered from advancing blindness during his final years, which were marred by straitened financial circumstances, and following his death on 15 July 1905 at his home in Torwood, Brisbane, his widow was supported by a fund raised for her relief. Of his eight children, only one daughter survived him. O'Doherty and his wife (who died on 21 May 1910) were interred in the Woowong cemetery, where a monument provided by the Queensland Irish Association stands over their graves.<br>
