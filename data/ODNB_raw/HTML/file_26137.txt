<span class="headword">Spencer,  Thomas</span>  (1791&#150;1811), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, second son of a worsted weaver, was born at Hertford on 21 January 1791. His mother died when he was five. He had to leave school, where he had acquired some Latin, at the age of thirteen &#145;to twist worsted every day with a heavy heart&#146;. For some months he was apprenticed to a firm of glovers in Poultry, London. Here he was introduced to Thomas Wilson, treasurer of the Hoxton Academy. To prepare him for entry to this ministerial training college he was sent for a year to study with William Hordle at Harwich: here he learnt Hebrew and abridged Parkhurst's <span class="italic">Hebrew Lexicon</span>. He entered Hoxton in January 1807 at the age of sixteen, and in June took his first service at Colliers End, near Hertford. He at once became a popular preacher and was in great demand throughout the home counties. On 10 January 1810 he addressed &#145;an immense congregation&#146; from Rowland Hill's pulpit in Surrey Chapel. He visited Liverpool in the summer of 1810, and on 26 September accepted an offer of the pastorate of Newington Congregational Church, much against his will, as he really wanted a southern church. His Liverpool ministry began in February 1811.<br>
<br>The &#145;boy preacher&#146; had a youthful appearance, with a sensitive face and deep-set eyes. His voice was melodious, his memory extraordinary, and his delivery fluent and powerful&#151;he reminded many of George Whitefield. There was, however, always some concern about his state of health. He at once attracted a vast congregation, far too large for the building. A new chapel was designed for him, to be erected in George Street; the foundation stone was laid on 15 April 1811, with no fewer than 8000 people in attendance. Spencer's promising career was brought to an abrupt end on 5 August 1811 when he was drowned while bathing in the Mersey off the Herculaneum Pottery. He was buried in Liverpool two days later. Thomas Raffles succeeded him in the pastorate of Great George Street. A collection of his sermons was published in 1829 and a volume of his tracts in 1853.<br>
