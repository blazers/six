<span class="headword">Armstrong,  Edward</span>  (1846&#150;1928), <span class="occ">historian and college administrator</span>, was born at Tidenham vicarage, Gloucestershire, on 3 March 1846, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/663/', "John Armstrong DD (1813&#150;1856)")</script> and his wife, Frances Whitmore (<i>d</i>. 1908). In 1853 his father was made the first bishop of Grahamstown, and the family moved with him to Cape Colony. The young Armstrong sometimes accompanied his father on his diocesan visitations among the indigenous population, and the novel sights of southern Africa left a deep impression all his life. His first school was St Andrew's College, Grahamstown. On his father's death in 1856, he returned to England and won a scholarship at Bradfield College, where he was an outstanding athlete. In 1865 he went to Exeter College, Oxford, as a scholar, and obtained first classes in classical honour moderations (1866) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1869). That same year he was awarded his degree and elected to a fellowship at Queen's College.<br>
<br>Except for two years as a classics master at Rugby School (1871&#150;3), Queen's College and Oxford were the centre of Armstrong's teaching and work for the rest of his life. A severe case of typhoid in 1872 brought an interval of enforced convalescence and the opportunity for extensive travel on the continent. Throughout his life travelling was his chief recreation. European travel enabled Armstrong to acquire a proficiency in modern languages that was rare among Oxford dons of his day. His own jocular claim, &#145;I can speak five fluently and mangle two&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) seems an accurate account of his attainments. His historical scholarship and numerous book reviews confirm his fine knowledge of French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Dutch, in addition to Latin and classical Greek. Over the years, his wanderings took him to distant parts of Europe where, in addition to visiting towns and libraries, he studied the countryside and its flowers and the ways of rural life. His vivid descriptions of historic sites and their associations often enlivened his lectures and informed his tutorials, to the delight of his listeners and pupils.<br>
<br>In 1878 Armstrong became senior bursar of Queen's College. The next year he married, on 2 October 1879, Mabel (<i>d</i>. 1920), the beautiful daughter of Joseph John William Watson, a scientific inventor and sometime vice-consul for Spain at Brighton. The couple, who had no children, settled in the Red House on Iffley Road, near the Queen's College, and a mile from the home in Iffley of his mother and artistic sister, Fanny. The appointment of his colleague G. W. Kitchin as dean of Winchester allowed Armstrong in 1883 to add to his work as bursar the teaching of modern history for his college. This proved to be the turning-point in his career. He became active in the newly formed history faculty board. The <span class="italic">Oxford Magazine</span> wrote in 1928 of him and his friend Arthur Johnson &#145;probably no two men did more to build up our Modern History school&#146;. He introduced &#145;Italy, 1492&#150;1513&#146; as a special subject in May 1884. Among the set texts were Guicciardini's <span class="italic">Storia fiorentina</span>, Machiavelli's <span class="italic">Il principe</span>, and Luigi da Porto's <span class="italic">Lettere storiche</span>, all of which were to figure prominently in Armstrong's teaching and scholarship. The special subject in Italian history proved immensely popular, especially with women students, until its suspension in 1913. At the same time Armstrong continued to lecture on fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Europe, succeeding C. E. Boase as university reader in European history in 1894. Armstrong was an early supporter of the education of women at Oxford, serving for several years as chairman of the council of St Hilda's College, and as tutor to many who took Italian Renaissance history as their special subject. But he was in many ways a conservative college don, wedded to the weekly essay and gruelling written examinations, who protested against the alternative of a short dissertation proposed in 1906 by T. F. Tout of Manchester University.<br>
<br>Armstrong's teaching, in university extension as well as college, often resulted in publication. His university extension lectures in summer 1892 were expanded into his first book, the survey <span class="italic">The French Wars of Religion</span>. His biographical study <span class="italic">Elizabeth Farnese: the Termagant of Spain</span> (1892) was based on original research in the archives of Naples as well as Spain. From his teaching in Italian history derived his popular life of <span class="italic">Lorenzo de' Medici</span>, published in Putnam's <span class="roman">Heroes of the Nations</span> series in 1896. Based on mastery of the published scholarship but no archival research, the biography is strong on political manoeuvrings, but weak on art and culture. Completely at home in the violent world of Medicean Florence, in his account of the Pazzi conspiracy he drops such chilling aphorisms as &#145;nothing is easier than to murder one man, few things more difficult than to murder two&#146;  (Hutton, 398). His lectures on the great days of the Spanish empire, Germany during the Reformation, and the Netherlands in the sixteenth century culminated in his <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">The Emperor Charles V</span> (2 vols., 1902). This work, based on standard collections of documents and specialized monographs, displayed Armstrong's concern for factual accuracy and detail at the expense of much lightness of touch.<br>
<br>More consistent with Armstrong's reputation as a great talker and entertaining after-dinner speaker are the papers on Renaissance themes which he presented to the Oxford Dante Society, the British Academy, and many learned periodicals. A selection of these was edited after his death by his pupil, C. M. Ady, as <span class="italic">Italian Studies</span> (1934). For four decades he frequently reviewed books for the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span>, bringing important works of continental scholarship to the attention of British scholars. He wrote lively and informative chapters on Savonarola for volume 1 and on Tuscany and Savoy for volume 3 of the <span class="italic">Cambridge Modern History</span> (1902, 1905). His most ambitious scheme of historical popularization was as editor of a series, <span class="roman">The States of Italy</span>, undertaken for Methuen in 1906. Armstrong recruited some of the top talent in Oxford for studies on the cities of north Italy and Naples, but in the event only two volumes were published: <span class="italic">Milan under the Sforza</span>, by Cecilia M. Ady (1907), and <span class="italic">A History of Verona</span>, by Alice Maud Allen (1910). He was among the several Oxford dons who signed a letter of post-war reconciliation to German and Austrian professors  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 Oct 1920, 8).<br>
<br>Administrative work, more than scholarship, occupied Armstrong's later years. From 1911 to 1927 he served as pro-provost of Queen's College. Effectively the head of the college for these years, Armstrong dealt with all sorts of people&#151;from college servants, undergraduates, and tenants, to soldiers, scholars, and diplomats. A loyal churchman, Armstrong set an example by his daily attendance at morning chapel at Queen's College. A member of the council of Bradfield College (1882&#150;1902), he served as its warden from 1910 to 1925. In Oxford he served as a curator of the Taylor Institution and the botanic garden. In 1905 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy, and in 1926 was awarded its Serena medal for distinguished work in Italian history. His election to the Athenaeum in 1905 was an honour appropriate to his social gifts. The death of his first wife was followed by a second marriage, when he was seventy-five, on 24 September 1921 to Geraldine Prynne, daughter of James Adolphus Harriss, vicar of St Andrew's, Oxford. The loving attention of his young bride, aged twenty-three, brought Armstrong great happiness in his declining years. Failing eyesight curtailed his research and writing, but only weeks before his death he was at work on two chapters for the <span class="italic">Cambridge Mediaeval History</span>, which were published posthumously. He died on 14 April 1928 at the Red House, Oxford, and was buried in Holywell cemetery.<br>
<br>Since his school-days, Armstrong had been in the habit of expressing his most intimate thoughts in verse. In his <span class="italic">Poems</span>, his widow gathered a selection written between 1861 and 1924, which were privately printed by Oxford University Press in 1929. Her touching introduction and the poems themselves convey the range of feeling and depth of character of this remarkable Oxford figure. Armstrong was not a great historian, but more than any don of his generation, he opened the history syllabus at Oxford to new fields, especially to Italy during the Renaissance, and acquainted British readers with contemporary European scholarship. A quiet rebel against the dominance of British history at his university, he introduced new areas of European history to generations of Oxford undergraduates who responded to his enthusiasm and interest with genuine admiration and affection.<br>
