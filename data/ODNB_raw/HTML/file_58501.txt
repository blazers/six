<span class="headword">Moloney, Sir  (Cornelius) Alfred</span>  (1848&#150;1913), <span class="occ">colonial administrator</span>, the eldest son of Captain Patrick Moloney, was born in 1848, probably in May, possibly in Ireland. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and entered the 1st West India regiment (in which his father also served). His first posting, in 1867, was to the Quiah district of Sierra Leone, as civil commandant. He then served as aide-de-camp to the governor of the Bahamas, returning to west Africa in 1873. He was promoted captain in 1874 and served in the Second Anglo-Asante War; he was mentioned in dispatches for his services for the abolition of slavery. He continued in the Gold Coast until 1884, serving as secretary to the governor, and later as administrator of Lagos, which was then part of the Gold Coast Colony.<br>
<br>On 28 December 1881 in the Roman Catholic chapel in the Vineyard, Richmond, Surrey, Moloney married Constance Thomson Knight (1860&#150;1891), daughter of William Clifford Knight, Russian consul in the Cape of Good Hope. When on leave from west Africa in the 1880s, and until 1891, he lived in Church Road, Richmond, and while there established contact with leading botanists at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. In 1882 he was made a CMG. From 1884 to 1886 he served as administrator of the Gambia settlement. In 1886 he returned to Lagos, this time as governor of the colony, which was then separated administratively from the Gold Coast; it extended some 300 miles from long. 2&deg; E to 6&deg; E and was linked by fine inland waterways. The colony did not reach far inland but Governor Moloney was much involved with efforts to settle ongoing quarrels between the Yoruba kingdoms. He had a real interest in the local people and their welfare; in 1889 he spoke to a meeting of the British Association about music in west Africa and in 1890 published a major paper about Lagos and the Yoruba people generally in the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the Royal Geographical Society. In 1887 he published an important book entitled <span class="italic">Sketch of the Forestry of West Africa</span>, which was much wider in scope than forestry in the modern sense. He was deeply concerned about local agriculture, including crops for export, and in conservation and the need for replanting; in 1887 he established a botanic garden and in 1889 a forestry department in Lagos. He collected many dried plant specimens, and some living ones, which he sent to Kew. Staff at Kew assisted in the preparation of his book, which also lists birds and other animals, in which he also took an interest. He was made a KCMG in January 1890.<br>
<br>Early in January 1891 Moloney left Lagos with the intention of spending three months' leave in Gran Canaria for the benefit of his health. In fact he never returned to west Africa as he was appointed governor of British Honduras. For health and other personal reasons he remained on leave in Richmond until 25 July and then travelled, via New York, to reach Belize on 17 August 1891 with his wife Constance, who died there from yellow fever on 1 September 1891. Moloney was devastated and sought permission to transfer to a more favourable climate, or to retire on pension. In fact he remained as governor of British Honduras until the end of 1896. In co-operation with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, he established in 1892 a botanical station in the grounds of Government House, Belize; its purpose was to promote the use and cultivation of indigenous and imported plants.<br>
<br>On 2 March 1897 Moloney married at Brompton Oratory, London, Frances Isabel Sophia Mary Owen-Lewis (<i>b</i>. 1873/4), daughter of Henry Owen-Lewis, and on 1 June 1897 he assumed duty as governor of the Windward Islands, based at St George's, Grenada. In 1898 he welcomed Daniel Morris, who came from Kew Gardens to be commissioner of agriculture in the West Indies. After his service in the Windward Islands Moloney was appointed governor of Trinidad and Tobago, based at Port of Spain. He served there from 4 December 1900 until his retirement in 1904. It was during this period that the water riots took place in Trinidad and, for various reasons, his active interest in agriculture and forestry diminished. He was, however, governor in Trinidad, and no doubt very supportive, when a programme to establish forest reserves was started. He died at Fiesole, near Florence, Italy, on 11 August 1913; his second wife survived him.<br>
