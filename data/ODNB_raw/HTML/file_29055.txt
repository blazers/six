<span class="headword">Wentworth,  Thomas</span>  (1567/8&#150;1628), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was the third son of the Elizabethan parliamentarian, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29051/', "Peter Wentworth (1524&#150;1597)")</script> of Lillingstone Lovell, Oxfordshire, and his second wife, Elizabeth Walsingham (<i>d</i>. 1596), sister of Sir Francis Walsingham, secretary of state. He married into a puritan family. His wife, Dorothy, mother of their eight children, was the daughter and coheir of Thomas Keble of Newbottle, Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>Wentworth matriculated at University College, Oxford, on 30 October 1584 and a year later entered Lincoln's Inn, where he was appointed Lent reader in 1612 and treasurer in 1621. His legal training is apparent in his parliamentary arguments from statute and precedent: he was called &#145;an honest lawyer&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1623&#150;5</i>, 197). His connection with Oxford was never broken and he represented the city in every early Stuart parliament before 1640. In September 1607 he was elected recorder of Oxford but his term of office was not without difficulty. Said to have behaved &#145;turbulently&#146;, he was described as &#145;a fomenter and author of divers troubles between the University and the city&#146; in their dispute over the night watch  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3rd edn, 2.414). The scholars called him &#145;Mr. Wantworth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of John Chamberlain</span>, 1.360). He was &#145;discommoned&#146; by the university in 1611 but reinstated two years later.<br>
<br>Parliament, puritanism, and the law were central themes throughout Wentworth's life. In these he followed in his father's footsteps, although Sir Henry Wotton when writing to Sir Edmund Bacon in 1614 said that Thomas had &#145;rather inherited his [father's] fortune than his understanding&#146;  (Smith, 2.37). In King James's first parliament Wentworth was on the committee to formulate the apology that presented the Commons' claim of privileges to the crown. Although it was never delivered, the apology stood throughout the early Stuart period as a confirmation of the rights of the lower house. He was often outspoken against crown policy: he opposed the proposed act of union with Scotland on ideological and practical grounds, saying that &#145;all changes in state are dangerous&#146;, and that the house was already full enough with as many members as &#145;one Speaker can moderate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Robert Bowyer</span>, 278); in 1610 he sat on the committee to prepare arguments against impositions; and he spoke ardently for a rule of law, saying in November that year that &#145;If the King have a power over the laws, we cannot have security, therefore we must see if the law can bind the King&#146;  (E. R. Foster, 2.393&#150;4). James would have punished Wentworth for his speeches, and went so far as to study Queen Elizabeth's arguments against Wentworth's father, searching for a precedent for imprisonment, but was dissuaded by members of the privy council.<br>
<br>In 1614 Wentworth again argued against impositions but this time was unable to escape the wrath of the crown. For a speech on 21 May regarding the assassination of Henri IV of France he was imprisoned in the Tower, the crown's justification being that he had offended the French ambassador. Throughout his parliamentary career he supported legislation professing the need to rid the kingdom of recusants and Jesuits. Noting in 1614 that &#145;The root of the powder treason [is] not dead&#146;  (Jansson, <span class="italic">Proceedings, 1614</span>, 60), he said in 1621 that &#145;these walls (methinks) do yet shake at it&#146;  (Notestein and others, 2.489).<br>
<br>In 1621 Wentworth spoke at length on religious grounds against a Spanish marriage, arguing that Catholicism would have its effect for &#145;wives take up a great part and room in the husband's heart&#146;  (Notestein and others, 2.491). A protestant queen would ensure a protestant succession, a subject familiar from his father's experience. Later, in 1626, he admitted that his father had been imprisoned in 1593 &#145;about the matter of succession because he and others had [had] secret conference to move it in parliament&#146;  (Bidwell and Jansson, <span class="italic">Proceedings, 1626</span>, 3.245&#150;6). In 1624 he was adamant against the Spanish marriage treaties on the same grounds regarding succession. In the following year he participated in the debate regarding Arminianism and Richard Mountague, canon of Windsor, reminding the Commons that King Alfred had read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> fourteen times over. Wentworth held numerous committee appointments and spoke often in 1626 addressing issues of church and state. In considering the evidence against George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, he drew on his legal expertise for offering an explanation of &#145;common fame&#146; and &#145;rumor&#146;  (ibid., 3.16, 46). Although he was returned for the parliament that convened in March 1628 it is unclear whether he went to London; there is no indication of his presence in the opening session. During his difficulties as recorder in Oxford he had moved to Henley, where he died in March or April 1628 and where he was buried. Martin Lister was one of his executors and may have been a relative by marriage. The authorship of multiple editions of <span class="italic">The Office and Duty of Executors</span> is assigned to Wentworth, whose name appears on the title-page of the third printing in 1641. Although it was believed earlier that the work was written by Sir John Doddridge there seems to be no proof to that effect.<br>
