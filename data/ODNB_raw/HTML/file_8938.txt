<span class="headword">FitzEustace,  Roland</span>, first baron of Portlester  (<em>d.</em> 1496), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Edward FitzEustace (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1454), head of a leading Kildare family of gentry with extensive possessions in the Kildare and Meath marches. The FitzEustaces were among the most prominent of Richard of York's Irish retainers. Edward was York's deputy lieutenant from 1452 and just before his father's death Roland was in 1454 appointed treasurer and apparently held office continuously until 1492. Roland married, first, Elizabeth, daughter of John Brune; second, in 1458, Joan Bellew, widow of Christopher Plunket, Lord Killeen; and third, Margaret Dartas (or Marguerite d'Artois), widow of John Dowdall and of Thomas Barnewall. In 1455 he built St Mary's Chapel in St Audoen's parish church, Dublin, and later erected there &#145;a goodly monument&#146; with recumbent effigies of himself and his wife Margaret, remains of which survive.<br>
<br>Edward IV's accession sparked a Lancastrian rising by the Butlers and Philip Bermingham in Meath in the winter of 1461&#150;2 and on FitzEustace's visit to court, Edward rewarded his good service by granting him Duke Richard's manor of Portlester and other Meath lands and raising him to the peerage as baron of Portlester. From June 1462 he served for ten months as the duke of Clarence's deputy lieutenant, with a retinue of 300 English archers, until replaced as governor by the earl of Desmond, the victor of the battle of Piltown which saw the final overthrow of the Lancastrian cause in Ireland. Throughout this period he was also closely associated with the earls of Desmond and of Kildare and frequently at loggerheads with the Meath gentry led by William Sherwood, bishop of Meath. These factional alignments lay behind various charges of treason against Portlester. Accused of urging Desmond to make himself king of Ireland, he was acquitted by parliament. In 1468 he was heavily involved in the troubles surrounding Desmond's attainder and execution by the earl of Worcester, releasing Kildare from prison and, with the earl, joining Desmond's brother in his revenge attack on Meath. Another charge of treason against him at Dublin in 1470 may relate to Henry VI's &#145;readeption&#146;.<br>
<br>From the 1470s Portlester was prominent in the Brotherhood of the Arms of St George which organized a standing defence force for the English pale. He undertook much building work, fortifying Kilcullen town and bridge and settling waste lands at Galmorestown near Baltinglass. In 1486 he established at Kilcullen a house of Franciscan Observants, known as the New Abbey, where he was later buried. He also served occasionally as lord chancellor&#151;jointly and &#145;for life&#146; with John Tapton, in 1472&#150;4, 1476&#150;8, and from 1487. In 1478 he supported the pretensions of his young son-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9554/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, eighth earl of Kildare (d. 1513)")</script>, to the governorship, denying Lord Deputy Grey access to the great seal and, as treasurer, assigning the king's revenues to deny him ready money. These disturbances stoked Portlester's feud with Bishop Sherwood, whose servant threatened him with decapitation, and in the settlement of 1479 Edward ordered Portlester to remit all ill will to Sherwood, now appointed chancellor, and Chief Justice Bermingham.<br>
<br>When Portlester's daughter, Alison, married Gerald Fitzgerald, the reversion of the manor of Portlester was thereby secured; and shortly before Sherwood's death Portlester had his son Oliver, reputedly disabled, appointed chief baron of the exchequer in 1482, acting by deputy. He played a leading role in the Simnel conspiracy in 1487, serving as chancellor for Kildare's brother, Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1487), who commanded the Irish contingent at Stoke, but was eventually pardoned. Portlester was dismissed from the treasurership in 1492 and during the Warbeck conspiracy he was ordered in 1493 to appear before the barons for audit of his accounts for the past forty years. He died on 19 December 1496, &#145;being very aged&#146;, and was succeeded by his son and heir, Richard Eustace of Harristown.<br>
