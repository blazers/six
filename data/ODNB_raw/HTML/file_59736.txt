<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lyster,  Thomas William</span>  (1855&#150;1922), <span class="occ">librarian and literary scholar</span>, was born on 17 December 1855 in Kilkenny, the elder son of Thomas Lyster of Rathdowney and Jane Smith of Roscrea. Lyster's father died early, leaving him as the main support of the family. Friends and colleagues were later to ascribe his strength of character and determination to this single event. He was educated at Wesleyan School, Dublin, and later at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated with MA senior moderatorship in English and German. He married Jane Robinson Campbell, daughter of James Campbell of Galway.<br>
<br>Early in his career Lyster acquired a reputation for scholarship, publishing books and articles on German and English literature. He translated Heinrich D&uuml;ntzer's life of Goethe (1883) and contributed many publications to the English Goethe Society. He also published many critical editions of Milton, wrote articles on Shakespeare and Jane Austen, and edited Hall's <span class="italic">History of English Literature</span>. He was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1913.<br>
<br>Lyster was appointed assistant librarian at the National Library of Ireland in 1878 at the relatively young age of twenty-three, and served there until his retirement some forty-two years later. He succeeded William Archer as librarian in 1895, remaining in that post for twenty-five years. In 1880 he was appointed as examiner in English under the intermediate education board, and in subsequent years he produced several textbooks which were adopted by the board, which ran to many editions.<br>
<br>It was as librarian of the National Library that Lyster truly left his mark. He embraced librarianship enthusiastically, and became an advocate of the radical modern movement, actively encouraging the application of the Dewey decimal classification system, supporting the formation of Cumann na Leabharlann (the Library Association of Ireland), emphasizing the importance of local newspapers and ephemera, and suggesting a subject index to periodicals. He was a tireless lecturer on library topics, promoting the development of the public library system in Ireland, defending the rights of ordinary citizens of access to books and information. He was elected vice-president of the Library Association (UK) in 1899, and in a paper to the annual conference of that association in 1902 entitled &#145;The idea of a great public library: an essay in the philosophy of libraries&#146; showed himself to be both a follower of Panizzi and an admirer of Newman. In the concluding pages of this paper, he argued against censorship:<blockquote>in a great library all things, good and evil, fall into their places, are seen in the just light, and proportion, and the <i>totality</i> of the record of human thought and feeling is a witness for what is wholesome, true and good.</blockquote>Despite this liberal and even-handed approach, Lyster found himself under attack on more than one occasion, and by different divides&#151;the nationalist newspaper <span class="italic">The Leader</span> attacking him, a non-Catholic, for daring to lecture to a Catholic body, while the <span class="italic">Irish Protestant</span> complained that the National Library failed to acquire some notable anti-Catholic polemic. His greatest legacy is having suggested a British index of periodicals in a paper to the Library Association in 1913. The first subject lists appeared in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> two years later, and signalled the way for the <span class="italic">Subject Index to Periodicals</span> which in turn was a forerunner of the <span class="italic">British Humanities Index</span>.<br>
<br>In his relations with the public and the staff of the library, Lyster was always fair and genial. More than any other librarian he generated a corpus of affectionate folklore. His sheer physical bulk and kindliness towards young students and readers made him a larger-than-life figure. Among the recorded lore is one memory from a long-serving staff member of Lyster walking around the bookstacks, keys in hand, calling &#145;I'm coming, I'm coming&#146;, to avoid surprising the unwary at something they should not have been doing. He is immortalized in Joyce's <span class="italic">Ulysses</span> in the famous library scene where, unnamed, he is referred to as the Quaker librarian.<br>
<br>Lyster retired in 1920. Two years later, on 12 December 1922, he died at his home, 10 Harcourt Terrace, Dublin. His wife survived him. Such was his impact that in 1926, four years after his death, a memorial plaque was erected in his memory&#151;the only such tribute to a librarian of the National Library of Ireland since its establishment in 1877. The list of subscribers who contributed to and organized the bronze and silver table reads like a who's who of Irish society of the day. The poet W. B. Yeats, a lifelong friend, who also delivered the oration, conducted the unveiling ceremony.<br>
