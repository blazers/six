<span class="headword">Thomas,  Ivor  Bulmer-</span>  (1905&#150;1993), <span class="occ">writer and politician</span>, was born Ivor Thomas on 30 November 1905 at Cwmbr&acirc;n, Monmouthshire, the third of four children of Alfred Ernest Thomas (1876&#150;1918), brick drawer, and his wife, Zipporah Jones (<i>d</i>. 1954), domestic servant. &#145;He trailed great clouds of intellectual glory. His academic performance was dazzling&#146;: thus in a memorial address Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of whose father, Arthur Jenkins MP, Ivor Thomas was. In 1918 he entered Jones's West Monmouth School, Pontypool, and in 1924 he won a scholarship to St John's College, Oxford. He attained a first in mathematical moderations in 1925 and a first in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1928. While studying divinity, a doctrinal dispute with the college's president led him to move to Magdalen College as a senior demy in theology (1929&#150;30). He represented Oxford against Cambridge at athletics and cross-country running, winning the 3 miles in 1927. In 1926 he was a member of the Welsh international cross-country team. But for an injury he would have been selected for the 800 metres in the 1928 Olympic games.<br>
<br>In 1930 Thomas wrote the first of his thirteen books, <span class="italic">Our Lord Birkenhead</span>, which resulted from its subject's keen interest in university athletics. It was full of 1920s Oxford wit and was dedicated to &#145;my creditors&#146;. His biography of Lord Gladstone of Hawarden, the prime minister's son, was published in 1936. It resulted from a year's study at St Deiniol's Library, Hawarden, in 1930. His <span class="italic">Top Sawyer</span>, a biography of the businessman and politician Lord Davies of Llandinam, followed in 1938. His first book dealing with current affairs, <span class="italic">Coal in the New Era</span>, appeared in 1930, when the trend was, as he put it, &#145;definitely away from coal to oil&#146;  (<span class="italic">Coal in the New Era</span>, 213). In that year he joined <span class="italic">The Times</span> as a sub-editor, contributing occasional leaders, articles on sporting and scientific subjects, and, later on, obituaries. In 1937 he moved to the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> as chief leader writer for two years. Fourteen years later he became for a year acting deputy editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. Over many years he wrote articles for numerous newspapers, and especially reviews for the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>.<br>
<br>On 5 April 1932, at the church of St Mary the Virgin, Pimlico, Thomas married Dilys (1910&#150;1938), daughter of Dr William Llewelyn Jones of Merthyr Tudful; they had one son. Many years after her death he published <span class="italic">Dilysia: a Threnody</span> (1987), the quality of whose verse was of a very high order. On 26 December 1940, at Hereford Cathedral, he married (Margaret) Joan, daughter of E. F. Bulmer of Adam's Hill, Hereford; they had a son and two daughters. He added Bulmer to his surname by deed poll in 1952.<br>
<br>Having joined the Territorials in 1938, Thomas served during the Second World War as a fusilier in the Royal Fusiliers, and in 1941 was promoted captain in the Royal Norfolk regiment. His command of Italian (one of the six languages he spoke and read fluently) led to a post in Hugh Dalton's Ministry of Economic Warfare, from where he fed propaganda into Mussolini's Italy. In 1942 he published <span class="italic">Warfare by Words</span>, which <span class="italic">The Times</span> called &#145;a direct, if guarded, attack on British propaganda&#146;. This was followed in 1946 by <span class="italic">The Problem of Italy</span>.<br>
<br>In 1935 Thomas contested Sir John Simon's Spen Valley seat in Yorkshire, as a Labour candidate, losing by only 600 votes. In 1942, under the wartime truce, he was elected unopposed at a by-election at Keighley. This seat he easily retained in the 1945 election. Attlee then appointed him parliamentary under-secretary at the Ministry of Civil Aviation. In 1946 he steered the controversial <span class="roman">Civil Aviation Bill</span> through the Commons. Typically, he obtained a pilot's licence so as to appreciate the difficulties facing civil airline pilots. Late in 1946 he was transferred, still as an under-secretary, to the Colonial Office, becoming a delegate to the general assembly of the United Nations and the first British member of the Trusteeship Council, but after a year of much globe-trotting he was summarily dropped from the government in a reshuffle. His disillusionment with socialism had already become apparent. During the debate on the king's speech in 1948 he resigned from the party. In a witty but heartfelt speech from the opposition benches, almost designed to elicit rage from his former colleagues, he excoriated &#145;the planners, who are trying to make a land fit for zeros&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 113). His <span class="italic">The Socialist Tragedy</span> was published in 1949. It is dedicated to &#145;all Social Democrats&#146;, hoping that they would choose democracy and eschew socialism. He joined the Social Democratic Party in 1981. He was soundly defeated as Conservative candidate for Newport, Monmouthshire, in 1950. Thus ended his political career, though in 1965 he published his two-volume <span class="italic">The Growth of the Party System</span>. Typically, on losing the election he drove with friends across the Sahara Desert in a jeep.<br>
<br>Brought up a strict Baptist, at Oxford he became a devout high-Anglican. He was chairman of the Faith Press and a vice-president of the Church Union. In 1950 he was elected to the house of laity of the church assembly (later the general synod), serving for thirty-five years. The force and pungency of his numerous interventions in debate were much admired but not always agreed with. In the second half of his life his overriding interest lay in the conservation of buildings of historical and architectural quality under threat, especially redundant churches. In 1952 he presented the archbishop of Canterbury with his seminal report, &#145;The preservation of <i>our</i> churches&#146;. This led to the creation of the grant-giving Historic Churches Preservation Trust, which he ran from its inception. In 1955 he piloted through the synod the inspection of churches measure, which made structural surveys compulsory quinquennially, thus largely eliminating &#145;repairs crises&#146;, which hitherto had carried off many fine churches.<br>
<br>In 1956 there occurred Bulmer-Thomas's tempestuous public row with Archbishop Fisher. This led to his resignation from the Historic Churches Preservation Trust. The essence of the quarrel was the trustees' insistence, backed by Fisher, that its funds be withheld from churches that were closed or facing closure, and allocated by diocese irrespective of architectural or historic merit. Bulmer-Thomas is said to have declared that Fisher had &#145;held a pistol to my face, while the Dean of Gloucester plunged his dagger into my back&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 Oct 1993). In time Bulmer-Thomas got his way when the report of the Bridges commission, set up by the two archbishops, appeared in 1960. This led to the 1968 pastoral measure which created the Redundant Churches Fund, of which Bulmer-Thomas was chairman until 1976. The measure established the principle of church and state sharing the cost of keeping redundant churches as monuments in the fund's possession. The Friends of Friendless Churches, which he founded in 1957, maintained those that fell through the net. From 1958 he was for thirty-five years first secretary and then chairman of the Ancient Monuments Society. When he was appointed CBE in 1984 for his conservationist efforts, he quipped that, in his case, CBE stood for &#145;Churches Before Evangelism&#146;.<br>
<br>Throughout his varied career Bulmer-Thomas pursued his interest in ancient and medieval mathematics. His two-volume <span class="italic">Selections Illustrating the History of Greek Mathematics</span> (1939&#150;41) remained in print for many years. His contributions, in various languages, to learned journals were numerous. He conversed with Einstein and knew Planck and Rutherford, but he regarded Newton as &#145;the supreme genius&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 13 Oct 1993). In 1979 Warwick University awarded him an honorary DSc degree at the instigation of the mathematics department.<br>
<br>Bulmer-Thomas was a strongly-built, soft-spoken man of exceptional mental and physical stamina, who needed at most five hours' sleep, reading Dante in the original nocturnally. He was a great fighter for what he believed to be right, attacking&#151;no holds barred&#151;big targets, never any that could not return fire. He had virtually total recall, never keeping an engagement diary. Without personal vanity, unpretentious, almost sloppily dressed, he was a workaholic. &#145;I <i>like</i> cold omelettes&#146;, he would reply to his wife's despairing call to a meal. He was working a few minutes before he died of a heart attack at his home, 12 Edwardes Square, Kensington, London, on 7 October 1993, having just written a letter to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> (printed on the same day as his obituary) and another to a friend declaring that he was &#145;refreshing his memory of the theory of relativity&#146;. He was survived by his second wife; his ashes were interred on 22 October.<br>
