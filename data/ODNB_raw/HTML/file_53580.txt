<span class="headword">Dare,  Zena</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Florence Harriette Zena Dones]</span>  (1886&#150;1975), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born at 18 Oakley Crescent, Chelsea, London, on 4 February 1886, the eldest daughter of Arthur Albert Dones, a barrister's clerk, and his wife, Harriette Amelia Wheeler. Educated at Maida Vale high school, she alternated schooling with pantomime from the age of twelve. Her first appearance was at the Coronet Theatre, understudying in <span class="italic">Babes in the Wood</span> (1899), after which she appeared in pantomimes in Edinburgh, Manchester, and Glasgow, and Seymour Hicks chose her for the title role in <span class="italic">An English Daisy</span> (1902). In 1903 she returned from learning French in Brussels to play Cinderella in Liverpool. Her performance in <span class="italic">Sergeant Brue</span> at the Strand&#151;&#145;Miss Zena Dare &hellip; as Mabel Widgett &hellip; combines refinement of style with dainty archness and quiet drollery&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 18 June 1904)&#151;set her firmly on her path in musical comedy.<br>
<br>Zena's dramatic style impressed critics: it was praised as &#145;distinctive and quite original&#146; by the <span class="italic">Play Pictorial</span> (1904). By casting her opposite himself in a large part Hicks recognized her quality. &#145;She was remarkably intelligent,&#146; he said; &#145;her performance &hellip; spelt her name in golden letters of success which she has made brighter each year by the whole-heartedness and sincerity of all she undertakes&#146;  (Hicks, 259). She created Angela in <span class="italic">The Catch of the Season</span>, by Seymour Hicks and Cosmo Hamilton, at the Vaudeville in 1904. <span class="italic">The Era</span> found this modern Cinderella &#145;positively bewitching, playing with a sweetness and delicacy that are beyond all praise &hellip; the gaiety of the young actress is irresistible&#146;  (17 Sept 1904). In 1905 she played the title role in <span class="italic">Lady Madcap</span>, by Paul Rubens and N. Newnham Davis, for George Edwardes. Until 1910 she played leading roles in major shows, including Owen Hall's <span class="italic">The Little Cherub</span> (1906), <span class="italic">The Beauty of Bath</span>, by S. Hicks and C. Hamilton (1906), and Hicks's <span class="italic">The Gay Gordons</span> (1907). On 23 January 1911 she married Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. Maurice Vyner Baliol Brett (1882&#150;1934), second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32055/', "Reginald Baliol Brett, second Viscount Esher")</script>, and a captain in the Coldstream Guards, and retired from the stage. They had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Edwardian musical comedy was insouciant and glamorous. Light-hearted to the point of being nonsensical, its ephemeral pleasures relied on the personality and superb technical accomplishments of its stars. When Zena returned to the theatre in 1926 in <span class="italic">The Last of Mrs. Cheyney</span>, by Frederick Lonsdale, this escapist world had vanished, but her distinguished career was not restricted to a single genre. She worked in London and toured with her own company to South Africa (1928&#150;9). There were musical comedies and reviews with Ivor Novello and No&euml;l Coward. John Gielgud cast her in <span class="italic">Spring Meeting</span>, by M. J. Farrell and J. Perry (1939), and in J. M. Barrie's <span class="italic">Dear Brutus</span> (1941). She toured in Lilian Hellman's <span class="italic">Watch on the Rhine</span> (1943) and played Julia Ward McKinlock in Samuel Taylor's <span class="italic">Sabrina Fair</span> (1954) and Isabel Sorodin in No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Nude with Violin</span> (1957). Her sophistication, warmth, and sincerity culminated in the creation of Mrs Higgins in Alan Jay Lerner's <span class="italic">My Fair Lady</span> (Drury Lane, 1958), a part that she played for over five years, subsequently touring with the company in 1964&#150;5. It seems unjust that when the play was filmed in 1964 her part was played by Gladys Cooper.<br>
<br>Her husband died on 18 August 1934. Zena Dare died on 11 March 1975 in Chelsea.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_53579"></a><span class="headword">Phyllis Dare</span>  (1890&#150;1975)<span class="occ"></span>, Zena's younger sister, was born Phyllis Constance Haddie Dones at 18 Landridge Road, Fulham, on 15 August 1890. She played the Brother in <span class="italic">Babes in the Wood</span> at nine years old. Martin Harvey engaged her to appear in <span class="italic">Ib and Little Christina</span>, by Basil Hood, in 1900 and she played Mab in <span class="italic">Bluebell in Fairyland</span> for Seymour Hicks in 1901. Seasons in pantomime, some with Zena, some playing Cinderella herself across the UK, alternated with formal education and the study of stage skills. Her d&eacute;but in musical comedy&#151;<span class="italic">The Catch of the Season</span>, by S. Hicks and C. Hamilton (1905)&#151;was a great success. In 1906 she went to the Ardennes to complete her education, returning almost immediately to take over the lead in <span class="italic">The Belle of Mayfair</span>, by C. H. Brookfield and C. Hamilton, with just four days to learn the script as she travelled home. &#145;Her delightful dancing and winsome manner won all hearts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Popular Favourites</span>, 2, 1922). Her instantaneous success led to a tour with <span class="italic">The Dairymaids</span>, by A. M. Thompson and R. Courtneidge, and a year's run in <span class="italic">The Arcadians</span>, by M. Ambient and A. M. Thompson (1909). By 1907, aged sixteen and a star, she was asked to write a short book about herself. In 1909 she played Gonda Van der Loo in <span class="italic">The Girl on the Train</span>, by V. Leon, and went on to create a series of &#145;girls&#146; including Prudence in <span class="italic">The Quaker Girl</span>, by J. J. Tanner (Ch&acirc;telet Theatre, Paris, 1911), Delia Dale in <span class="italic">The Sunshine Girl</span>, by Paul Rubens and Cecil Raleigh (1912), and Sally Hook in <span class="italic">Miss Hook of Holland</span> (1914), by Paul Alfred Rubens and Austen Hurgon.<br>
<br>A talented composer, Rubens (1875&#150;1917) adored Phyllis; only his ill health prevented their engagement from leading to marriage. Her contribution to the tango craze came from his <span class="italic">The Sunshine Girl</span> (she later filmed <span class="italic">The Argentine Tango and other Dances</span>, 1913). He wrote notes for his best ballad (&#145;I Love the Moon&#146;) for her on his dirty shirt-cuff while at dinner and then had to retrieve it from the laundry. During 1914 she sang his &#145;Your King and Country Want You&#146; in recruiting campaigns. Rubens died in 1917, leaving her a small fortune.<br>
<br>After the war Phyllis's talent matured. In Frederick Lonsdale's <span class="italic">The Lady of the Rose</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">Lido Lady</span>, by Ronald Jeans (1926), she was queen of the romantic musical play. James Agate reported wryly of Lonsdale's <span class="italic">The Street Singer</span> (1924) that &#145;she received an ovation never accorded to Bernhardt, Duse or Ellen Terry&#146;  (Trewin, 67). A new career might have opened with Edgar Wallace's dramatic <span class="italic">The Yellow Mask</span> (1928); unfortunately she was generally offered trivial comedies, with the exception of Stella Trent, in <span class="italic">Cheated</span> (1930), where she acted with &#145;a depth of feeling that was astonishingly impressive&#146;  (B. Oulton, <span class="italic">The Stage</span>, 8 May 1975). Her last appearance was with Zena in Ivor Novello's <span class="italic">King's Rhapsody</span> (1949).<br>
<br>The adventurous, compassionate child heroine of her children's book, <span class="italic">Kitty in Fairyland</span> (1914), reflected its author. Phyllis Dare died on 27 April 1975 at her home, 22 Pembroke Avenue, Hove, Sussex. The Dare sisters were caught up in the picture craze of the early 1900s, signing 300 postcards a week. In these cards one glimpses the casual grace and strong stage presence that they brought to their enthralled audiences.<br>
