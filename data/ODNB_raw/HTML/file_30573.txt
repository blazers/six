<span class="headword">Banks, Sir  John Thomas</span>  (1816&#150;1908), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 14 October 1816 in London, the second son of Percival Banks (1764&#150;1848), surgeon, of Ennis, co. Clare, Ireland, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Captain Thomas Ramsay. Percival Banks studied medicine at Rheims and Paris and he served in the navy and army before returning to Ennis where his father, also named Percival, was a doctor. Percival junior became surgeon to the county infirmary and physician to the fever hospital. John Banks was educated at Erasmus Smith's Grammar School in Ennis. He began his medical studies in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland as a pupil of Sir Henry Marsh, professor of the practice of medicine. He obtained the licence of the college in 1836. He also studied arts and medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, where he began his studies in 1833. Four years later he graduated BA and MB and in 1843 he proceeded MD. His older brother Percival Weldon Banks also studied at Trinity College before going on to become a barrister and writer. He was best-known for his contributions to <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> which were written under the pseudonym Morgan Rattler.<br>
<br>In 1840 Banks was appointed lecturer on materia medica at the Park Street school of medicine, Dublin. Two years later he was appointed lecturer on the practice of medicine at the Carmichael school of medicine and the following year he was appointed physician to the Richmond, Whitworth, and Hardwicke hospitals, where he was a colleague of Sir Dominic Corrigan and Robert Adams. He held this last position until his death. He was an excellent teacher and he was greatly admired as an accomplished physician. He became a fellow of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland in 1844. Banks was appointed king's professor of the practice of medicine in the school of physic at Trinity College in 1849 and this post was linked to an appointment as physician to Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital. He resigned these appointments in 1868 but he was subsequently appointed consulting physician to the hospital. In 1851 he became assistant physician and in 1854 physician to the Richmond Lunatic Asylum. In his later years he was also consulting physician to the Royal City of Dublin Hospital. In 1880 he was elected regius professor of medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, and he held the post for eighteen years. Banks was president of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland between 1869 and 1871 and he was president of the Dublin Pathological Society in 1861. When the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland was founded in 1882 he was unanimously chosen to be its first president. He was president of the British Medical Association when it met in Dublin in 1887.<br>
<br>Banks had a major interest in medical education and he represented at first the Queen's University and then the Royal University (as it became) on the General Medical Council from 1880 to 1898. He pleaded for a high standard of education before entry to medical school and he stressed the importance of psychological and psychiatric studies for medical students. At that time psychiatric disorders, although commonly encountered in general practice, were largely excluded from undergraduate medical studies and Banks played a role in bringing about the inclusion of mental illness as a subject in the medical curriculum. He also urged the lengthening of the medical curriculum from four to five years. Banks was a handsome and dignified man whose ethical behaviour and professional conduct were always above reproach. These attributes made him the natural leader of his profession and a dominant figure in the social life of Dublin for many years. He was a noted conversationalist and he was admired for his princely hospitality. His busy social life was almost certainly an explanation for his comparatively modest research output. He was not a prolific writer on medical subjects. One of his more interesting contributions was his note on the writ &#145;De lunatico inquirendo&#146; in relation to the mental stability of the ageing Jonathan Swift which was published in the <span class="italic">Dublin Journal of Medical Science</span> in 1868.<br>
<br>Banks married Alice (<i>d</i>. 1899), daughter of Captain Wood Wright of Golagh, co. Monaghan, in 1848. They had one daughter, Mary. In 1891 he served as high sheriff in Monaghan. He received an honorary LLD from the University of Glasgow and a DSc from the Royal University. He was physician-in-ordinary in Ireland to Queen Victoria and to Edward VII and in 1889 he was made KCB in recognition of his distinguished services to medicine. In 1906 he endowed a postgraduate scholarship in medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, which is still awarded by the university. A John Banks medal in bronze is also given to the successful candidate. Banks died on 16 July 1908 at his home, 45 Merrion Square, Dublin, and he was buried at Mount Jerome cemetery after a service in the chapel of Trinity College, Dublin.<br>
