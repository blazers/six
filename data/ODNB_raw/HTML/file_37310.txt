<span class="headword">Cons,  Emma</span>  (1838&#150;1912), <span class="occ">social reformer and theatre manager</span>, was born in London on 4 March 1838, the second daughter in the family of seven children of Frederick Cons (1810&#150;1870), piano-case maker for Broadwoods, and his wife, Esther Goodair (<i>d</i>. 1882), daughter of a Stockport mill owner. She attended a school run by the mother of the painter Henry Holliday, and then went to the art school in Gower Street, London. She continued her education at the school run by Caroline Southwood Hill, but when her father became too ill to work in 1852 she left school. She was employed by the Christian socialist, co-operative Ladies' Guild, which trained girls in glass painting until its closure in 1856.<br>
<br>Emma Cons had been drawn into social reform circles while at Mrs Hill's school, where she had met Octavia Hill (the schoolmistress's daughter), John Ruskin, Charles Kingsley, and F. D. Maurice. Through Octavia Hill she became involved in the management of working-class housing projects, as a volunteer. Ruskin, meanwhile, employed her in 1856 to work on the restoration of illuminated manuscripts. During a visit to Switzerland she noticed that the work of watch engraving was carried out by women, and, taking the view that this was ideal work for women, when she returned to England she apprenticed herself to a watch engraver, together with a group of female friends. After completing their training the women established a co-operative watch engraving business in Clerkenwell, but they encountered great hostility from male competitors, who intercepted the messenger who brought the women work and injured him so severely that the manufacturers became uneasy at supplying them with further orders. With insufficient work, the co-operative was eventually forced to close. Her next employment also brought Cons into conflict with established male employees. She was the first woman to be hired by the stained-glass manufacturers Powells of Whitefriars, and the men deliberately sabotaged her work until Arthur Powells's personal intervention ended the persecution. One of her most important commissions at Powells was to work on the restoration of the stained-glass windows in the chapel of Merton College, an assignment which kept her in Oxford for two years in the early 1860s.<br>
<br>Alongside her paid employment Emma Cons continued to work as a volunteer in Octavia Hill's housing projects, looking after properties in Drury Lane and Marylebone. In 1865 Hill had bought three tenements in Paradise Place with money provided by Ruskin, and the following year bought more properties in Freshwater Place. From the beginning Cons was an active worker in the enterprise. Although there were differences in their styles of management, Hill appreciated the qualities which Cons brought to the work; she gave an account of Emma Cons's activities at a housing project near Drury Lane: &#145;[she] enrols her own volunteer workers, founds her own classes, clubs, savings, banks, keeps her own accounts, supervises all the business and personal work, and reports to the owners of the courts direct&#146;  (Darley, 148). Housing management involved Emma Cons in every aspect of maintenance, including dealing with workmen. She thought nothing of instructing an obstreperous workman in the art of house construction, and her close friend Henrietta Barnett wrote:<blockquote>I can visualise her now: mounting ladders, mixing colours, ordering and laughing at the men, who when too inexperienced, backward, or perhaps indolent, would show resentment at, or disinclination for the job, were made ashamed and also encouraged by seeing Miss Cons seize the brush and give an excellent lesson on distempering, painting or washing down. (Barnett, 3)</blockquote>By 1870 she had become manager of the Central London Dwellings Improvement Company. In 1879 she initiated the South London Dwellings Company, which bought a property between the Lambeth and Kennington roads that Cons transformed into model dwellings, known as Surrey Lodge. She turned two of the cottages into one, and this became her own permanent office and home, which she shared with her sisters Ellen and Eliza.<br>
<br>Emma Cons also became an active member of the temperance movement, believing that the only way to discourage men and women from resorting to the gin palace was to provide an alcohol-free alternative. She opened her first &#145;coffee tavern&#146; in Drury Lane, providing all the social facilities of the public house with non-alcoholic refreshments; the scheme, which acquired the financial backing of several wealthy aristocrats, grew to encompass about fifty establishments throughout London. Cons was to apply the principles of the coffee tavern to the more general reform of working-class entertainment, which centred on drink and the music-hall. She was convinced that there was a close link between working-class recreation, alcohol, and domestic violence, of which she had seen a great deal in her work in housing management. She believed firmly that the only way to solve the problem was to provide &#145;purified&#146; entertainment, from which both indecency and alcohol had been eliminated. In 1879 she formed the Coffee Music Hall Company with the specific object of providing such entertainment, and in the next year the company leased the Victoria Theatre on the Waterloo Road (widely known as the Old Vic) as the venue for Cons's experiment with &#145;purified&#146; entertainment. Formerly an insalubrious music-hall, in an area surrounded by gin palaces, public houses, and criminal haunts (and, incidentally, close to Surrey Lodge), the Old Vic was transformed by a &pound;3000 refurbishment, renamed the Royal Victoria Coffee Music Hall, and opened for business on 27 December 1880, with an offering of wholesome entertainment and alcohol-free refreshments.<br>
<br>Inevitably, the venture ran into immediate financial difficulties, as Emma Cons had greatly overestimated the ability or willingness of the citizens of Lambeth to sit through a performance of elevating entertainment washed down with nothing stronger than tea or coffee. In May 1881 the theatre closed, but after an energetic fund-raising campaign Cons reopened it in October, with a programme of music-hall style entertainment, science lectures, ballad evenings, and temperance meetings. Another financial crisis ensued, and in 1884 the industrialist and Liberal MP Samuel Morley responded to Emma Cons's plea for assistance and bailed the theatre out. The Old Vic could not withstand a further crisis, and Cons and the board of governors launched an appeal to raise the &pound;17,000 necessary to buy the theatre's freehold. With the help of the charity commissioners and private sponsors, including the duke of Westminster, the appeal was successful, and the freehold was purchased in 1891.<br>
<br>Cons had wanted the Royal Victoria Coffee Music Hall to offer both entertainment and education, and the regular science lectures, given by many eminent scientists, had been a success. Following a request from three members of the audience for a series of evening classes to be set up, she founded the first part-time educational institution for working men and women in south London, which she named Morley College after her benefactor. The earliest classes were held in rooms running beneath the Old Vic's stage, and she officially opened the college on 28 September 1889. It remained under the aegis of the theatre until the 1920s, when it was moved to Westminster Bridge Road.<br>
<br>Although remembered chiefly for her work in providing &#145;rational recreation&#146;, Emma Cons was active in many other fields. She &#145;was one of the founders of the first Women's Horticultural College at Swanley in Kent &hellip; [and] she found time to travel to Armenia, to report on the Armenian atrocities&#146;; she established a silk factory for the Armenian refugees in Cyprus on her journey home  (Baylis and Hamilton, 281). She was a member of the London Society for Women's Suffrage, serving as vice-president in 1908&#150;11. A lifelong champion of women's rights, she was a constitutional suffragist. She was a member of the executive committee of the Women's Liberal Federation, and vice-president in 1892, and served on its temperance committee in 1894.<br>
<br>In 1889 Cons was appointed an alderman by the newly formed London county council, and as such was caught up in the acrimonious debates and legal cases over women's capacity to act as councillors, along with Jane Cobden-Unwin and Lady Margaret Sandhurst, who had both been elected to the council. Exploiting legal loopholes, Cons and Cobden-Unwin succeeded in holding on to their places on the council (although they both underwent a year of enforced inactivity to prevent their unseating), and in 1890 Cons resumed her place on six committees (asylums, housing, industrial schools, parks, sanitation, and theatre) and a number of subcommittees. She explained her commitment to the cause of women councillors thus:<blockquote>I believe that for such work as ours women are not only qualified but needful, and I desire to defend their franchise as far as lawfully I may &hellip; those duties are to me a trust, not only for women but for the whole community. (Hollis, 313)</blockquote>She remained on the council until its term was up, but, with all women, was disqualified for standing for re-election.By the end of the century Emma Cons's health was suffering from the range of her commitments, and in 1899 she invited her niece, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30648/', "Lilian Baylis")</script>, to take over the management of the Old Vic. She retained an active interest in the theatre for the rest of her life, but it was Baylis who transformed its repertoire. Emma Cons died at a friend's home, Chippens Bank, Hever, Kent, on 24 July 1912, and her ashes were scattered in the surrounding woods.<br>
