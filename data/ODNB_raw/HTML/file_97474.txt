<span class="headword">Sainsbury,  Simon David Davan</span>  (1930&#150;2006), <span class="occ">businessman and philanthropist</span>, was born on 1 March 1930 at 27 The Vale, Chelsea, London, the second of three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71184/', "Alan John Sainsbury, later Baron Sainsbury (1902&#150;1998)")</script>, grocer and businessman, and his first wife, Doreen Davan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Adams (1904&#150;1985), daughter of Leonard Adams. His early life was spent in Chelsea, and at Dorney, near Windsor, during the Second World War. He was educated at Eton College, where he became head of his house and president of Pop, the Eton society. He excelled at music and sport, scoring a century in the Eton&#150;Harrow match at Lord's in 1947. After national service with the Life Guards (where he was made sports officer), he took a degree in history at Trinity College, Cambridge, before qualifying as a chartered accountant in 1956. He joined the family food retailing firm, J. Sainsbury Ltd, later the same year. Initially he worked closely with his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74059/', "Robert Sainsbury (1906&#150;2000)")</script> on matters relating to personnel, finance, and general administration. He was appointed a director in April 1959.<br>
<br>Whereas previous generations of the Sainsbury family had largely been trained &#145;on the job&#146;, it was felt important, as the business grew in scale and complexity, that the fourth&#151;Alan's sons John (<i>b</i>. 1927), Simon, and Timothy (<i>b</i>. 1932), and Robert's son David (<i>b</i>. 1940)&#151;should be better equipped to manage different aspects of its strategy and direction. Thus while his elder brother John gradually assumed responsibility for trading and marketing and his younger brother, Timothy, became a chartered surveyor and subsequently director responsible for estates and store development (and also Conservative MP for Hove from 1973 to 1997, a government whip, and a junior minister), Simon Sainsbury built on his accountancy training and experience in administration to play a key role in updating the business's financial, administrative, and distributive infrastructure and in planning its future development. In particular he championed investment in the modernization of the company's antiquated distribution system and the introduction of an administrative structure that was reliant on professional managers. He was also responsible for the first application of computer technology to British food retailing.<br>
<br>In 1969 Simon Sainsbury succeeded his brother John as deputy chairman of Sainsbury's on John's appointment as chairman. Together with their younger brother Timothy, and subsequently also their cousin David, the brothers oversaw the company's growth from a medium-sized regional family firm to become Britain's most successful food retailer. A crucial aspect of this transformation was the company's flotation on the stock exchange. Simon Sainsbury, who took responsibility for this move, explained to readers of the company's house magazine that the timing of this decision was governed jointly by the Sainsbury family's desire to see the completion as a private company of the centenary in 1969 and by its decision to have &#145;largely completed&#146; the replacement of the pre-war store portfolio with self-service shops and the updating of its supporting distributive and administrative infrastructure before going public. It was to be the biggest and most oversubscribed public flotation to that date; it was also the first to be advertised on television. The share offer opened at 10 a.m. on 19 July 1973. When it closed one minute later it was oversubscribed thirty-four-fold. Priority in allocation of shares was given to small investors, and to members of Sainsbury's staff, for whom a million shares were set aside.<br>
<br>In 1975 Simon Sainsbury began a gradual handover of his responsibilities as deputy chairman to Roy Griffiths, whom he had brought into the business in 1968. Roy Griffiths had succeeded him as personnel director and now became joint deputy chairman. The transfer of responsibilities lasted until 1979, when Simon Sainsbury finally retired. Subsequently his involvement with the business was confined to supervision of its arts sponsorship committee, of which he was chairman from the programme's inception in 1981 until 1990. He was thus responsible for establishing the company's reputation as one of Britain's most enlightened corporate arts sponsors through projects that included a mixture of existing arts programmes and &#145;own brand&#146; events like the Sainsbury choir of the year competition.<br>
<br>At the same time Simon Sainsbury was conducting a much less publicized programme of private philanthropy, much of it anonymous. He possessed an exceptional eye for art and design, shared with his uncle Robert. In 1965 he set up the Monument Trust, which in its early days gave generous support to architectural charities, including the Georgian Society and the National Trust, funding the restoration for the nation of the interiors of a number of important country houses and enabling the trust to bid at auction for items that had been sold by their previous owners. His support included major donations to the British Museum, Royal Academy, the V&amp;A, the Council for the Protection of (later Campaign to Protect) Rural England, the Landmark Trust, and Christ Church, Spitalfields. With his support the original Addenbrooke's Children's Hospital building at Cambridge was saved from demolition and transformed into the Judge business school.<br>
<br>The Monument Trust provided essential finance for HIV and AIDS sufferers before statutory funding was made available. It also supported projects to make the lives of prisoners more hopeful, and the regeneration of Meadow Well estate, north Tyneside, after the riots of 1991. It was characteristic of Simon Sainsbury's style of patronage that beneficiaries of his philanthropy received much more than money: he took a keen interest in their progress, often over a period of many years. He was a trustee of the Wallace Collection from 1977 until 1997, serving as its chairman for the last five years of that period, and a trustee of the National Gallery from 1991 until 1998.<br>
<br>Simon Sainsbury preferred his patronage to remain undisclosed, but when the high-profile funding of the National Gallery's Sainsbury wing by the three Sainsbury brothers (John, Simon, and Timothy) made it impossible to maintain anonymity he relented. &#145;Now that my name is in letters a foot high in Trafalgar Square, there doesn't seem much point&#146;, he told Martin Drury, director-general of the National Trust  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 18 Oct 2006). Neil McGregor, the National Gallery's director, recalled that Simon Sainsbury's chairing of meetings with the gallery and the architects over an extended period provided &#145;master-classes in running a project&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 4 Oct 2006). After the gallery opened in 1991 it was Sainsbury who organized a party for the stonemasons and car-park attendants.<br>
<br>In his private life Simon Sainsbury was reticent almost to the point of reclusiveness. Friends reported his virtues correspondingly to be those of modesty: loyalty, persistence, understatement, and self-discipline, leavened with a dry sense of humour. Neil McGregor observed in his <span class="italic">Independent</span> obituary that Simon Sainsbury &#145;would &hellip; have hated to read this tribute&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 4 Oct 2006). It was characteristic that he declined to appear in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>, and was reported to have turned down public honours. His partner of over forty years was Stewart Grimshaw, restaurateur and bookseller, with whom he registered a civil partnership in January 2006; a fitting, very private, celebration for a couple who had campaigned over many years for disadvantaged same-sex couples (and had provided crucial funding for Stonewall, the group campaigning for lesbian and gay equality). His last years were marred by the progressive onset of Parkinson's disease. He died on 28 September 2006 at Southampton General Hospital following a fall, and was survived by his civil partner, Stewart Grimshaw. He left an estate valued at almost &pound;300 million, and bequeathed eighteen paintings from his collection to the National Gallery and Tate, including works by Monet, Degas, Francis Bacon, and Lucian Freud.<br>
