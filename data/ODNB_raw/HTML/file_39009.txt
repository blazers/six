<span class="headword">Hepworth,  Joseph</span>  (1834&#150;1911), <span class="occ">clothing manufacturer and retailer</span>, was born on 12 May 1834 at Lindley, Huddersfield, the son of George Hepworth, shoemaker. He left school and entered the textile trade at the age of ten, working at Joseph Walker's woollen mill in Lindley as a half-timer, converting to full-time work two years later. In 1850 he was engaged as a teasel setter in George Walker's Wellington mill, a job that disappeared in 1860 as the Walkers went out of business. He then acquired an overlooker's position in another local mill, before spending twelve arduous months as a travelling salesman for a woollen manufacturer. In 1855 he married Sarah Rhodes; they had three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Hepworth's career assumed a new and significant direction in 1864 as he and James Rhodes, his wife's brother, established a small woollen drapers' business in Briggate in central Leeds. The partners were also practical tailors, owning nine sewing machines, and their business included the making-up of garments for the wholesale clothing trade. Small though the enterprise was, it provided the basis on which after twelve months both men, separately, moved into wholesale clothing manufacture. They both achieved long term success, but Hepworth's progress was particularly impressive.<br>
<br>In 1865, in the context of the early period of expansion of the Leeds clothing industry, Hepworth's first sole tailoring enterprise, located in Bishopsgate Street, employed twelve people. Several changes of premises accompanied regular and sound expansion through the 1870s. By 1881 Hepworth's Wellington Street factory employed 500 and, as Joseph was joined by his son Norris, a strategic change was made to the business, which became a retail as well as a manufacturing enterprise. The Hepworths, wishing to distance themselves from the financial vagaries of those retailers with whom they conducted business, decided to sell their clothes direct to the public. While this was a significant departure from the normal practices of the Leeds trade, it was not only a striking and immediate success, but it became a practice developed by other clothing manufacturers in the town and elsewhere. Although Hepworth is typically credited with the idea, which is seen as his particular contribution to the Leeds industry, William Blackburn, also a prominent Leeds clothing manufacturer, simultaneously, and quite possibly independently, set up shops for the sale of his factory manufactured goods.<br>
<br>The 1880s saw the most expansive period in the history of the Leeds clothing industry, the largest proportion of which was assigned to the making of men's tailored garments, to which Hepworth made a significant contribution. It was common practice among Leeds wholesale clothiers for the factories to make trousers and vests while subcontracting to Jewish workshops the making of coats and jackets. Hepworth, however, deviated from this pattern and rarely engaged the services of Jewish subcontractors. The firm also depended more heavily than many Leeds clothing manufacturers on the export trade. By the end of the decade Joseph Hepworth &amp; Son employed 2000 operatives producing garments for the company's 107 retail outlets, and for the South African and Australian export markets where Hepworth's subsidiary plants were located. By this stage Hepworth was sufficiently wealthy to purchase the grand Headingley House, vacated by the Marshall family in 1888. The firm continued to add to productive and retailing capacity. The conversion to private company status in 1891, with a capital of &pound;360,000, coincided with the erection of a new factory in Claypit Lane. By 1907, when a further factory was added, and with 145 shops, Joseph Hepworth &amp; Son had become one of the largest concerns in the clothing industry. Ten years later with 160 retail outlets, it headed the list of British companies engaged in the sale of men's clothing and headwear.<br>
<br>Joseph Hepworth was a paternalistic employer, introducing paid holiday entitlement, an eight-hour day, and a clean working environment before these became standard. His political and religious activities, however, gradually overshadowed his work for the company. Hepworth became a Liberal councillor in 1888, and alderman and magistrate in 1892; and his work for party and community was rewarded by his appointment as lord mayor in 1906. During this year his nonconformist leanings and teetotalism influenced civic life, as he banned alcohol from all municipal functions. As a leading member of the Methodist New Connexion he provided financial support for the United Methodist church founded in 1907. The value he placed on technical education was reflected in his involvement in the Leeds Mechanics' Institute, the Yorkshire College, and as governor of Leeds University.<br>
<br>Joseph Hepworth died at Comber House, 19 Park Drive, Harrogate, on 17 October 1911, survived by his wife. The business was initially carried on by Norris who himself died in 1914, and thereafter by later generations of the family.<br>
