<span class="headword">Aitken,  William</span>  (1812?&#150;1869), <span class="occ">Chartist and factory reformer</span>, was born in a barrack room near Dunbar, possibly on 2 June 1812, the youngest but one of nine children of Scottish parents, natives of Duns. His father, originally a cordwainer, served thirty years in the army and rose to the rank of sergeant-major. After leaving the army Aitken's father decided to move the family to the Lancashire mill town of Ashton under Lyne. At eleven, William became a cotton piecer in a mill; a few years later he graduated to mule spinner. He received little formal education; however, he read widely in history, science, and literature and fell in love with poetry, a passion that lasted throughout his lifetime.<br>
<br>In the early 1830s Aitken took up the cause of the ten-hour working day in cotton factories; his activism led to conflict with his employer and eventually to his dismissal. Out of work, he decided to open in 1833 a school in Mill Lane at Ashton. A few years later he married Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hanley Taylor (<i>b</i>. 1801/2), a native of Ashton. Of their six children four died in infancy or in childhood; the survivors were Peter and William Wallace, who was born at their home in Park Street, Ashton, in 1841. In 1840 Aitken's school, where his wife also taught, enrolled 120 day and 40 evening students, mainly of the working classes, and yielded a weekly income of about 3 pounds.<br>
<br>In the late 1830s Aitken was active as a Chartist speaker and organizer in Ashton and Stalybridge. Although he avoided any direct involvement in the buying and selling of firearms and pikes, he upheld the right of the people to bear arms and supported the call for a general strike. In August 1839 he was arrested on the charges of seditious conspiracy and speeches and unlawful assembly. In 1840 he went to prison and served nine months at Kirkdale, near Liverpool, where he wrote poetry.<br>
<br>In the summer of 1842 Aitken and other members of the Chartist leadership spoke at a series of mass meetings to protest against a round of wage cuts in the Ashton and Stalybridge area; they came out in favour of a general strike for a fair day's wages and the Charter and later travelled to towns in the cotton district and West Riding to urge working men and women to join the strike. In September 1842, after the strike's collapse, Aitken left the country, in the company of Samuel Radcliffe and James Taylor, on the ship <i>Ebenpreble</i>. He spent about a year in the United States and returned to Ashton in late 1843. At the urging of friends he published a short account of his adventures, <span class="italic">A Journey up the Mississippi River: from its Mouth to Nauvoo, the City of the Latter Day Saints</span> (1845).<br>
<br>In 1848, during the Chartist movement's third (and final) national campaign, Aitken spoke at Chartist meetings and rented the lower floor of his school to the Chartists; it became a meeting place for the Chartist national guards. Well aware of the insurrectionary plotting of that summer, he took no part, however, in the August uprising in Ashton by the national guards. In the wake of these events the authorities arrested Aitken and charged him with conspiracy and sedition; in December 1848 these charges were dropped.<br>
<br>With the decline of Chartism, Aitken remained active in public life but directed his time and energies into other causes. In the early 1850s he used his skills as a speaker and writer on behalf of a local movement to enforce the ten-hour day; in 1854 Ashton factory workers presented him with a purse of 100 guineas in recognition of his labours. A well-known leader of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows, Aitken also served as an auditor and secretary for different local societies and devoted considerable effort and personal expense to the building of Oddfellows Hall, which opened in Ashton in 1856. Throughout these years he took a lively interest in municipal and parliamentary politics in Ashton and eventually came to align himself, in terms of electoral politics, with the Liberal party; in the late 1850s he also spoke at a number of reform meetings. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of his post-Chartist career was his outspoken support of the confederate cause during the American Civil War. Critical of the blockade of southern ports, which led to the &#145;cotton famine&#146; in Lancashire, he defended the confederacy's right to secede from the union. Confederate sympathizers apparently supplied Aitken with some of the funding for his pro-southern activities in the cotton district.<br>
<br>In the late 1860s ill health and depression led Aitken to withdraw from public life and to give up his school. Against this background of poor health and growing despair, he set out to tell the story of his life; in September 1869 his autobiography began to appear in instalments in the <span class="italic">Ashton News</span>. On 27 September 1869, at his home, 362 Katherine Street, Ashton under Lyne, Aitken took a razor and cut his throat. His age was given as 57. In a show of support and respect, thousands thronged the streets from his home to his funeral on 1 October at St Peter's Church, Ashton, where he was buried.<br>
