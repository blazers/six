<span class="headword">Henry,  John</span>  (1746?&#150;1794), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, is usually stated to have been born in Dublin in 1746, although this claim, like William Dunlap's that he was &#145;liberally educated&#146;  (Dunlap), has never been substantiated. His initial stage outings were most likely in 1761 in Belfast and Dublin. He apparently joined the Charles Storer theatrical family when they departed from Ireland in 1762 for Jamaica, where Henry married one of the Storer's seven daughters, Jane. Five years later, in August 1767, while travelling to join the American Company of Comedians in the colonies, Henry and the remaining Storer family were involved in a ship accident off the coast of Rhode Island that claimed Henry's wife and two young children.<br>
<br>Henry made his American d&eacute;but in Philadelphia on 5 October 1767 as Publius Horatius in William Whitehead's <span class="italic">The Roman Father</span> with the American Company, led by Lewis Hallam the younger and David Douglass. For his New York d&eacute;but, on 7 December 1767, he played Aimwell in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span> opposite Hallam's Archer. With the American Company he appeared in Philadelphia again, from 4 October 1768 to 6 January 1769; at New York from 9 January to 19 June; at Albany, New York, in July; and at Philadelphia, from 8 November to 24 May 1770. In March 1770 Ann Storer was listed as Mrs Henry, though there is no evidence of a legal marriage. After Philadelphia the American Company appeared in Annapolis, Maryland, and Williamsburg, Virginia; it then returned to Philadelphia in 1772&#150;3 and played in New York for the final season (April) until after the American War of Independence. They followed this with appearances in Charles Town, South Carolina, after which, in 1774, they departed for Jamaica in order to evade the prohibition of theatrical events during hostilities between the colonies and Britain.<br>
<br>In Jamaica Henry assumed the management of the American Company and led them at three locations, including a new venue in Kingston, from July 1775 until 10 May 1777, after which he apparently sailed for England, where he appeared during the summer at the small China Hall theatre in Rotherhithe. Henry's activities for the next two years are unverified, although it has been suggested that he was an officer in the British army during this period. It is known that on 16 October 1779 he made his London d&eacute;but at Drury Lane as Othello; on the same evening &#145;A Young Lady&#146; (very likely another Storer sister, Maria) made her d&eacute;but at Covent Garden. By 1788 Maria was known as Mrs Henry, her sister Ann having returned to Ireland rather than go to Jamaica with Henry in 1774. Records of this Henry&#150;Storer marriage have not been located, yet the union proved successful.<br>
<br>By June 1781 Henry, back in Jamaica, was joined by Hallam in the management of the American Company. On 25 August Henry's play <span class="italic">School for Soldiers, or, The Deserters</span> was presented. He later wrote and staged <span class="italic">The Convention, or, The Columbian Father</span>, performed in New York on 7 April 1787. During the 1780s Henry returned to the United States, where he helped to re-establish professional theatre, following the end of hostilities; he also spent time in Jamaica and London, and on 21 November 1785 rejoined efforts with Hallam in New York in what was now known as the Old American Company. Despite a volatile relationship they dominated American theatre for the next seven years. With the threat of competition from former company member Thomas Wignell, in 1792 Henry went to London to recruit actors, including John Hodgkinson, who, with the support of Hallam, drove Henry and his wife out of the company. At the end of the 1794 season Henry sold his shares to Hallam for $10,000.<br>
<br>Henry died at sea near Fisher's Island, off the New England coast, &#145;very suddenly of gout of the stomach&#146; on 16 October 1794  (<span class="italic">Columbian Centinel</span>, 1 Nov 1794); he was buried either at Bristol, Rhode Island, or, according to Dunlap, under the sand of an island in the sound. Maria, who reportedly had the body returned to her, died on 25 April 1795 at Philadelphia.<br>
<br>Tall and handsome and effective in Irish comic roles, Henry was also a respectable musician who sang musical roles and often played with the theatre orchestra when not needed on stage. His parsimonious behaviour and arrogant manners, however, made him many enemies throughout his career.<br>
