<span class="headword">Edmonds <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dickie]</span>,  Rosemary Lilian</span>  (1905&#150;1998), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was born on 20 October 1905 at Clifton, Coldfall Avenue, Muswell Hill, Middlesex, the daughter of Walter Herbert Dickie, a private secretary, and his wife, Lilian Worthington. After her schooling at St Paul's Girls' School, she spent some time at the Sorbonne in Paris studying French. In 1927 she married James Edmonds; their marriage was subsequently dissolved.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Rosemary Edmonds worked as multilingual translator to General de Gaulle at his Free French headquarters in London. She was appointed (in 1940) at the insistence of Winston Churchill and the British government on having a native English speaker as de Gaulle's official translator. De Gaulle, who had wanted an all-French staff, had been obliged to compromise, although during the time she spent working for him in London, Edmonds remained the only non-French person on his staff.<br>
<br>After the liberation, at de Gaulle's request, Edmonds returned to Paris with him, continuing to work as a translator on his staff. He personally paid for her to take Russian courses at the Sorbonne. She greatly admired de Gaulle and respected the way he had treated her; she recalled, for instance, how he had been careful to arrange for her to be compensated for the British taxes on her earnings, in order to ensure that she remained on an equivalent salary to her untaxed French colleagues. She was soon forced to resign her post, however, in order to retain her British citizenship.<br>
<br>Back in London, Edmonds was approached by E. V. Rieu, founder editor of the series <span class="roman">Penguin Classics</span>. Rieu set her to work on a translation of Tolstoy's <span class="italic">Anna Karenina</span> (which she preferred to call <span class="italic">Anna Karenin</span>) in 1950; this work, which took her three years, helped to establish her as one of the country's foremost translators of Russian literature. Rieu immediately followed this up with a commission for a translation of <span class="italic">War and Peace</span>, which appeared in 1957.<br>
<br>These were followed by several other translations of Tolstoy; this very prolific period produced <span class="italic">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</span>, <span class="italic">The Cossacks</span>, and <span class="italic">Happy Ever After</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Childhood, Boyhood, Youth</span> (1964), and <span class="italic">Resurrection</span> (1966), as well as several works by other Russian writers including Pushkin (<span class="italic">Queen of Spades, and other Stories</span>, 1962), Turgenev (<span class="italic">Fathers and Sons</span>, 1965), and Gogol (<span class="italic">Divine Liturgy</span>, 1960).<br>
<br>Tolstoy, whom she called both &#145;a prophet&#146; and &#145;a moralist&#146;, was, for Edmonds the greatest humanist: &#145;[His] subject is humanity&#146;, she wrote in her introduction to <span class="italic">War and Peace</span>; &#145;Tolstoy does not contrive: he records, recoiling from nothing&#146;. Her translations of Tolstoy are today considered among the most successful in English, and her work has made a substantial difference to how he has subsequently been read in the English-speaking world. At the time of her death her Tolstoy translations had sold over four million copies.<br>
<br>During her time in Paris, Rosemary Edmonds had met the Archimandrite Sophrony; it was this acquaintance which introduced her to Russian Orthodox spirituality, of which she remained a fascinated student until the end of her life&#151;she even, with Sophrony's help, became proficient in Old Church Slavonic. Her interest in the religion extended to helping Sophrony establish an Orthodox monastery community in England (near Maldon, Essex) in 1959. Both before and after her work for the <span class="roman">Penguin Classics</span>, Edmonds produced translations of Sophrony's writings about his mentor Father Silouan in <span class="italic">The Monk of Mount Athos</span> (1973) and <span class="italic">Wisdom from Mount Athos</span> (1974). She spent much of the later part of her life researching Old Church Slavonic texts, and brought together Old Church Slavonic service books with their corresponding Greek texts to produce a translation of the Orthodox Church liturgy, which was published by the Oxford University Press in 1982.<br>
<br>Throughout her life Rosemary Edmonds was an advocate for numerous charitable causes of all kinds. In 1979 she was awarded the freedom of the City of London, considering it a great honour, though she was essentially an intensely private person, with just a small circle of close friends. She reserved her devotion mainly for her work, which she continued almost full-time into the last years of her long life.<br>
<br>She died of Parkinson's disease on 26 July 1998 at a nursing home, Joan Bartlett House, 3 Beatrice Place, Marloes Road, in Kensington, London.<br>
