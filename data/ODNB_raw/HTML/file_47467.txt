<span class="headword">Hackett,  Maria</span>  (1783&#150;1874), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born in Birmingham on 14 November 1783, the only child of Joseph and Grace Hackett. Her father died when she was four months old, and in October 1787 Grace married Samuel Capper, the son of a Birmingham cloth merchant, and bore him two sons, John and Samuel James. Capper died in 1790, and about the turn of the century Grace and her children moved to London. Here they lived with Capper's unmarried brother George, a provision broker and agent in the City, who had a country home at Snaresbrook, Essex, and a town house at 8 Crosby Square where, by 1809, Maria Hackett was residing.<br>
<br>Maria Hackett, who never married, devoted her time and money (the latter of which was probably inherited from George Capper) to a campaign to improve the living and educational conditions of boy choristers in the cathedrals and other Anglican choral foundations. Her active interest in the welfare of choristers began in 1810, when she enrolled her seven-year-old orphaned cousin Henry Wintle as a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. The boys were not receiving proper housing, education, or supervision, and were routinely hired out, to the singing master's profit, to perform at public concerts and dinners with little thought for their safety or moral welfare. Maria Hackett undertook a study of documents in the muniment room at St Paul's and in the British Museum to determine the cathedral authorities' responsibilities towards the choristers. In January 1811 she sent the bishop of London a detailed account of her findings. His evasive reply prompted her to write to other cathedral dignitaries, but with no more success. In 1813 she, George Capper, and her half-brothers initiated legal proceedings that had to be abandoned prematurely because of expense. Nevertheless, a court order of August 1814 restored some of the funds that had been diverted from the choir to other purposes.<br>
<br>Maria Hackett continued her letter writing and research, and her efforts began to meet with some success. She published her <span class="italic">Correspondence and evidences respecting the ancient collegiate school attached to St Paul's Cathedral</span> (1811&#150;32). Meanwhile her attention was extended to all the choral foundations of England and Wales, resulting in the publication of a <span class="italic">Brief account of cathedral and collegiate schools with an abstract of their statutes and endowments</span> (1827).<br>
<br>Never an aloof benefactor, Maria Hackett took a personal interest in the choristers, richly deserving her informal title the Choristers' Friend. She often visited the choristers of St Paul's Cathedral, where she worshipped regularly, and brought them treats. For more than fifty years she made autumn visits to other choral foundations, calling on each at least once in three years, noting the names of the choristers in her diary and presenting to each boy a book, a purse, and a new shilling. Her lifelong efforts were crowned at the age of ninety, when she was shown the new St Paul's choir school in Carter Lane.<br>
<br>In 1831 Maria Hackett established the Gresham prize for cathedral composition. A patron of promising musicians, she funded John Stainer's organ studies after he left the St Paul's choir. She was a keen student of London history, publishing in 1816 <span class="italic">A Popular Account of St Paul's Cathedral</span>, which went through some twenty-one editions by 1833. The manuscript of her unpublished novel, &#145;Wharfdale, or, A Legend of St Nicholas&#146;, is in the Guildhall Library. In 1832 she, her half-brothers, and some friends formed a committee for the preservation and restoration of Crosby Hall, an imposing fifteenth-century structure adjoining her house. It became an important musical and educational venue.<br>
<br>At the time of her death, on 5 November 1874, Maria Hackett was living with her half-brother John and his family at 77 Amhurst Road, Hackney. A devout member of the Church of England, she expired during a communion service held at her bedside. She was buried at Highgate cemetery. In 1877 a cenotaph in her memory was placed in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral with funds raised by subscription from the nation's cathedral choristers.<br>
