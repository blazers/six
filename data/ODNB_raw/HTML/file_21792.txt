<span class="headword">Pelham,  Herbert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1600&#150;1674), <span class="occ">colonist in America</span>, was the son of Herbert Pelham (<i>d</i>. in or after 1629) of Boston, Lincolnshire, and his first wife, Penelope, daughter of Thomas West, second Baron De La Warr. Nothing is known of his early years or education but in 1626 he married, by licence dated 13 October, Jemima (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1639), daughter of Thomas Waldegrave of Bures-ad-montem, Essex. The couple had seven children, including a daughter, Penelope, who married Josiah Winslow, governor of Plymouth Colony; Pelham's sister Penelope married Richard Bellingham, governor of Massachusetts Bay.<br>
<br>Along with his father and other members of his family Pelham became deeply involved in the work of the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1629, and was one of those engaged to &#145;frame the form of the oath for the Governor &hellip; also for his Deputy, &amp; for the Counsell&#146;  (Shurtleff, 1.39). He had been preceded to New England by his younger brother William, who established himself at the new town of Sudbury and obtained grants of land there for his brother. When Herbert Pelham finally arrived in New England in late 1639 or early 1640, his first wife had recently died, and he married by 1640 Elizabeth Harlakenden, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bosville (<i>d</i>. in or before 1659), widow of Roger Harlakenden of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The couple settled in Cambridge and had seven children; Pelham probably never resided on his lands in Sudbury.<br>
<br>During his residence in New England Pelham held a number of important offices. He was elected an assistant in 1645 and 1646, and also in 1646 was appointed commissioner from Massachusetts Bay to the United Colonies of New England. He was also appointed treasurer of Harvard College in 1643. Late in 1646 he returned to England, but was clearly expected for some time to go back to New England, as he was elected, <i>in absentia</i>, assistant in 1647, 1648, and 1649. By 1648 he had settled in Bures, Essex, at the manor of Ferrers, which had come to him through his first wife. In 1654 he sat in parliament for Essex. He resided at Bures for the remainder of his life, and was buried there on 1 July 1674.<br>
