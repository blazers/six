<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baring,  Thomas George</span>, first earl of Northbrook  (1826&#150;1904), <span class="occ">politician and viceroy of India</span>, was born at 16 Cumberland Street, London, on 22 January 1826, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1383/', "Sir Francis Thornhill Baring, third baronet and later first Baron Northbrook (1796&#150;1866)")</script>, and his first wife, Jane (1804&#150;1838), daughter of Captain Sir George Grey RN, first baronet. She was a niece of Earl Grey of the <span class="roman">Great Reform Bill</span>, and sister of the second Sir George Grey, an influential figure in mid-nineteenth-century whig cabinets, revered by his nephew. Thomas George Baring, so called to distinguish him from his tory uncle Thomas, united in his person the political traditions of the Greys and the wealth of the Barings, one of the greatest of City families. He was always true to his reforming whig origins, after as before he joined the Unionist secession from the Liberal Party in 1886, and his banking forebears' devotion to sound finance was natural to him.<h2>
<a name="Astatesmaninthemaking18261872"></a>A statesman in the making, 1826&#150;1872</h2>The elder Baring, a Wykehamist, had no kind memories of his old school and some doubts about his son's strength of character. After a little time at what later would have been called a preparatory school, the boy was entrusted to private tutors. Well taught and well read, he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1843, taking a second in classics in 1846, a performance considered creditable to someone who gave the superficial impression of being typical of the scions of aristocracy at the House. His college friendships endured, and were the only close ones of his adult life. He was to sit in cabinet with two of those friends, Chichester Fortescue, later Lord Carlingford, and John Wodehouse, first earl of Kimberley&#151;cultured, serious-minded young men like himself behind a conventional exterior. Baring's father, a former and future cabinet minister, encouraged him to enter politics, and arranged for a thorough grounding in his chosen career as an unpaid private secretary to a succession of ministers, to all of whom he was related. Between 1846 and 1857 he worked for an uncle, Henry Labouchere, when he was chief secretary for Ireland and then president of the Board of Trade; for another uncle, Sir George Grey, at the Home Office; and for Sir Charles Wood, a cousin, at the India board and the Admiralty. In an interval during this lengthy apprenticeship, he married on 6 September 1848 Elizabeth Harriet (1827&#150;1867), the daughter of Henry Charles Sturt of Crichel, Dorset, and sister of two brothers in his Christ Church circle. They had three children. He read up political economy without much relish for its bleak imperatives and concluded that &#145;unfortunately free trade is true, and we must use all our efforts to give our manufacturers the power of underselling the world&#146;  (Mallet, 39).<br>
<br>At the invitation of two leading Quaker families with local influence, the Foxes and the Gurneys, Baring stood for Penryn and Falmouth at the general election of 1852, setting his face against the bribery for which the borough was well known, and lost. Returned in 1857, he was to look back nostalgically on the elections he fought there in the days of open voting: &#145;Strange taste, is it not?&#146;  (Mallet, 38). With his connections and experience he was at once given minor office, as civil lord of the Admiralty in the first Palmerston administration. In the second, following an interlude of tory government, he served as under-secretary in three departments: the India Office, 1859&#150;61 and 1861&#150;4, under Wood; the War Office, January to July 1861; and the Home Office, 1864&#150;6, under Grey. He was particularly interested in War Office business, to which he came with nearly twenty years' service in the Hampshire yeomanry; from 1864 he commanded and met the bills for the troop based at Winchester. The military machine, he decided, was in need of &#145;extensive but judicious changes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 93, 16 July 1868, 1243). When he went back to the War Office in December 1868 as a peer and Cardwell's under-secretary, he was wholly in sympathy with his minister's far-reaching reforms and ably supported them. In a phrase that stung his opponents, he described the purchase system in the army, abolished in 1871 after a bitter struggle, as &#145;a spider's web of vested interests&#146;  (ibid., 207, 13 July 1871, 1550). Never a good speaker, he stuck closely to his departmental brief; but his quiet competence and authentic liberalism commended him to the premier, who early in 1872 rated him the under-secretary in the Lords best qualified for promotion to the cabinet  (Gladstone to Argyll, 13 Feb 1872, Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 8.110).<br>
<br>Northbrook, as he became on his father's death (6 September 1866), thought his political career had ended when he left the Commons, and was reconciled to the life, which he found quite satisfying, of a country gentleman with varied interests. The deaths of his wife, whom he never ceased to mourn, and of his younger son, a midshipman lost at sea three years later, intensified a deeply religious outlook, rooted in an eirenical Christianity. Politics became, and remained, a question of duty, if it had ever been anything else. He wrestled with his conscience and self-doubt when Gladstone, urged on by Wood, now Lord Halifax, preferred him to Lord Dufferin as viceroy of India. &#145;Not a case of duty&#146;, he told himself; &#145;No ambition for [the] office or feeling that I could do good in it&#146;  (Mallet, 53). But after telling Halifax that he did not wish the offer to be made, he accepted, succeeding Lord Mayo, assassinated in February 1872.<h2>
<a name="ALiberalviceroy18721876"></a>A Liberal viceroy, 1872&#150;1876</h2>Northbrook's first months in India confirmed him in a severely realistic view of the British position in the subcontinent: &#145;We are tolerated as being a less [<i>sic</i>] evil than what would be likely to follow us&#146;  (Northbrook to Gladstone, 9 Sept 1872, BL, Add. MS 44266). Against that background he attached great importance to reducing taxation of every kind and keeping it down. Before he left Britain he had discussed with Halifax the abolition of the unpopular income tax reintroduced by his predecessor, and carried it over the objections of half his council in India. Earlier that year, citing the political risks, he had vetoed a municipalities bill for Bengal in the light of Indian protests at the higher taxes it entailed. He was especially concerned about the most productive of Indian taxes, the land revenue assessed upon the ryots, the peasants: under-assessment was always preferable to over-assessment resulting in &#145;a discontented, and possibly a dangerous class&#146;  (Moulton, 46&#150;7). In Bombay and Oudh the subordinate governments were induced to moderate their demands on the cultivator. He counted as one of his successes the battle with &#145;the Strachey School&#146;&#151;believers, like Sir John Strachey, a member of the viceroy's council and governor of the North-Western Provinces, in the economic virtues of forcing up the land revenue  (Northbrook to Ripon, 8 Aug 1884, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/4). In one of his first letters to a presidency governor, another appointment from home, Northbrook remarked how little many high-ranking British civil servants in India appeared to know of the people, and advised him to elicit the views of district officers, and those of Indians &#145;wherever we can get them to speak freely&#146;. He had come out fortified not only by the opinions of his enlightened whig circle, but by his time at the India Office, where the conservatism of Indian society and the dangers of exciting its fears were well understood after the rising of 1857: &#145;I shall therefore &hellip; legislate as little as possible&#146;, he decided from the outset  (Northbrook to Lord Hobart, 19 May 1872, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/13). The mutiny was still fresh in British minds. When, later on, the question of increasing the size of the Indian army arose, he asked his friends at home to be careful in discussing it; everything they said was the subject of comment by Indian journalists, whose ability impressed him: &#145;It would not mend matters to tell our native troops that we never can trust them thoroughly after what has happened&#146;  (Northbrook to Lord Bessborough, 25 Jan 1875, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/23).<br>
<br>These anxieties did not have the usual effect of making Northbrook afraid to contemplate some of the changes that Westernization must inevitably bring. As his private secretary he had been involved in the preparation of Wood's education dispatch of 1854, and now saw the central problem of the not very distant future in the emergence of &#145;able men &hellip; with feelings and interests adverse to British rule &hellip; [and] a real desire &hellip; to show their independence and use their English education&#146;  (Northbrook to Maurice Drummond, 13 June 1875, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/23). They were, through their newspapers, creating an Indian public opinion of which an alien regime was compelled by its own liberal values to take note. Northbrook regarded this element more sympathetically than did many of his officials&#151;&#145;the Baboos are not &hellip; devoid of fun&#146;&#151;and defended the freedom of the Indian press against those who would have liked to restrict it  (Northbrook to Argyll, 26 Sept 1872, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/9). A government with no representative institutions needed the newspaper criticisms even when they were &#145;more or less violent. &hellip; It is far more safe that these things should be said openly than that they should be said without the knowledge of government&#146;  (Moulton, 268&#150;9). His internal and external policies for India were complementary. The determination to reduce both expenditure and the deficit he had inherited strengthened his opposition to the suggestions, increasingly being heard, that Russian expansion in central Asia should be countered by a corresponding British movement to secure India's north-western approaches. In his view Russia's advance made her more vulnerable, with over-extended lines of communication open to attack by local guerrillas financed and directed from India, relatively inexpensively. By the beginning of 1874, when the Liberals left office in Britain, India was on the way to a budgetary surplus and able to absorb the cost of averting mass starvation in the Bengal famine of that year.<br>
<br>Northbrook and the outgoing secretary of state, the duke of Argyll, worked well together. Lord Salisbury, the future tory premier who took over at the India Office, had held the post before, in 1866&#150;7. He distrusted all bureaucracies&#151;India's rather more than most&#151;and was critical of the councils which the <span class="roman">India Act</span> of 1858 had given to the secretary of state in London and had continued for the viceroy in India. Salisbury reorganized the department, dominated his council, and sought by private correspondence with Northbrook to reverse a process by which the viceroy's councillors had acquired &#145;something of independent power&#146;  (Salisbury to Northbrook, 18 Dec 1874, Steele, 136). Northbrook, however, could not be persuaded to embrace the doctrine that a transient viceroy was alone deserving of the home government's full confidence. Through two years of argument on the point Northbrook insisted that his powers were properly exercised by the &#145;Governor-General <i>in Council</i>&#146;  (Northbrook to Salisbury, 3 March 1876, Salisbury MSS, HHM/3M/E12). This did not imply the viceroy's subjection to the council: he contrasted his control of its decisions with the independence that councillors had asserted under John Lawrence (1864&#150;9).<br>
<br>Northbrook and Salisbury differed, the former realized, on &#145;some of the first principles of Indian administration&#146;  (Northbrook to Halifax, 2 Oct 1874, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/22). One of Salisbury's first actions at the India Office was to instruct the government of India in March 1874 to send legislative proposals home for approval prior to their introduction into the viceroy's council, sitting with additional members, European and Indian, in its law-making capacity. He followed this up with the <span class="roman">India Councils Act</span> of the same year, adding a public works member to Northbrook's council against his wishes. Salisbury's later <span class="roman">Indian Legislation Bill</span>, enabling the secretary of state to veto part of an Indian measure instead of having to sanction or disallow the whole, had to be withdrawn for lack of parliamentary time, and also because it was known that Northbrook's political friends were going to fight it. The viceroy did not dispute the authority of the secretary of state, with the cabinet and the House of Commons behind him, but argued that it should not take the form of dictation to &#145;men of Indian experience &hellip; in a position to give &hellip; advice with complete independence&#146;, that is, to councillors enjoying security of tenure under the act of 1858  (Northbrook to Salisbury, 20 Aug 1874, Salisbury MSS, HHM/3M/E12). Happy to work with those advisers, Northbrook did not want greater powers for himself.<br>
<br>By the time he left India Northbrook felt that &#145;&#147;Any stick is good enough to beat a dog with&#148;, and &hellip; I have the honour of being the dog&#146;  (Northbrook to Salisbury, 16 Aug 1875, Salisbury MSS, HHM/3M/E12). A cause of steadily worsening disagreement with Salisbury was policy towards Afghanistan, the buffer state in the path of Russian expansion. Viceroy and secretary of state both thought it would be unwise to advance into a fiercely Muslim and xenophobic country. Salisbury was much less influenced than Northbrook suspected by Sir Henry Rawlinson and Sir Bartle Frere, members of his council in London, who contended for a &#145;forward policy&#146;. He believed it was enough that Britain and India should insist on a permanent diplomatic presence in Afghanistan&#151;something considered impossible since the massacre of the British mission at Kabul in 1842 and the destruction of its supporting garrison. Northbrook adhered to Lawrence's school in frontier policy: neither British prestige nor the Russian threat required a resident envoy. &#145;Why the government were determined to meddle beats my comprehension&#146;, he reflected  (Northbrook to Sir G. Clerk, 11 Feb 1876, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/23).<br>
<br>The same conviction that impelled Northbrook to resist &#145;a wrong thing&#146; led to open conflict with Salisbury over the Indian cotton duties  (Northbrook to Sir L. Mallet, 25 Feb 1876, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/23). For domestic and imperial reasons, Salisbury wished to end what Lancashire claimed was discrimination in favour of the infant Indian cotton industry. Northbrook and his council ignored Salisbury's statements to that effect and, more importantly, the directive of March 1874 when in August of the following year they passed new tariff legislation which preserved the duties with only minor changes and did so without first consulting the secretary of state. Salisbury did not disallow the legislation, as he was at first inclined to do. To have taken that step would have precipitated a crisis between the two governments and attracted parliamentary intervention. But he censured the government of India for its action. Northbrook represented that he had not been specifically ordered to begin doing away with the duties. While that was true, he had never seen any justification for relieving British exports of a light burden at the expense of Indian taxpayers. If Lancashire was really feeling the competition from Indian mills, over-trading with inferior goods was to blame  (Northbrook to Mallet, 2 Oct, 29 Oct 1874, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/23). To the extent that the duties were protective he defended them by recalling that before the industrial revolution and free trade Britain had discriminated against Indian textiles. The sacrifice of Indian interests to Lancashire risked alienation of &#145;the best and most loyally disposed of the educated natives&#146;  (Northbrook to Salisbury, 29 Jan, 25 Feb 1876, Salisbury MSS, HHM/3M/E 12). In the event, the abolition of the duties carried through largely by Northbrook's successor, Lytton, did not inhibit the growth of the Indian industry.<br>
<br>Their differences obscured the much wider area of agreement between Salisbury and Northbrook. With the mutiny in mind they looked on Islam in India as the most worrying of potential threats to British rule; Mayo's assassin was a Muslim. Where the princely states were concerned, Northbrook was rather more careful than Salisbury of the princes' feelings and their rights, as in the cases of Baroda and Hyderabad's claim to Berar. In defence of the nizam of Hyderabad, he quoted Charles James Fox on the pervasive influence of British constitutionalism in India, even on &#145;the most absolute despotism&#146;. Yet he persuaded Salisbury to excise the words &#145;the interests of the people&#146; from his dispatch on Berar: used to justify withholding the territory from the nizam, they might be employed against the British  (Northbrook to Salisbury, 30 Sept 1875, Steele, 132). That prudence was evident in his thinking on the delicate question of allowing a Westernized &eacute;lite to enter the covenanted civil service in more than token numbers. While he disagreed with Salisbury's decision to lower the age limit for the competitive examination, to the assumed disadvantage of Indians, he also held that a change in the regulations was as yet unnecessary. If too many Indians did pass into the service, they might simply be barred from the examination: &#145;at any rate nothing should be done to encourage native candidates to compete&#146;  (Northbrook to Salisbury, 30 Sept 1875, Salisbury MSS, HHM/3M/E12). Consistently with these private views, Northbrook did not reverse the tory Mayo's educational policy, although he modified its application by Sir George Campbell as lieutenant-governor of Bengal. Too little had been spent on the beginnings of elementary education, and too much on secondary and higher education, often of doubtful quality; Northbrook did not care for the growing &#145;half-educated class&#146; any more than Salisbury did. Like Salisbury again, he thought India's recent progress had been too rapid for comfort  (Northbrook to Salisbury, 26 Feb, 12 Sept 1875, Salisbury MSS, HHM/3M/E12).<br>
<br>With hindsight, Northbrook was satisfied that the peasant masses had benefited from his policies, intended &#145;&#147;to give the land rest&#148;, as some of the natives phrased it&#146;: the Western-educated handful were, after all, only &#145;the froth of Indian society&#146;  (Northbrook to Lord Dufferin, 8 Sept 1884, 14 March 1885, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/5). It is, at first sight, surprising that this conservative fell out with a tory secretary of state. Northbrook failed to heed a friendly warning from a member of Salisbury's council that the telegraph &#145;tends much to reduce the viceroy to a puppet&#146;  (Sir E. Perry to Northbrook, 9 July 1875, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/23). He resented as interference the insistence of an unusually able and interested minister on being involved in Indian decision making from an early stage. He disliked, too, the tone of Salisbury's dispatches with their &#145;strong flavour of <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span> smart writing&#146; (Northbrook to Lord Camperdown, 14 June 1875, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/5; Northbrook to Dufferin, 5 Aug 1885, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/5). The adviser closest to him and the moving spirit in his council's defiance of the secretary of state was not an Indian civilian but the law member, Arthur Hobhouse&#151;a partisan Liberal who incited the viceroy to think Salisbury's behaviour arbitrary and unconstitutional. When Northbrook cut short his five-year term in India, it was supposed, Hobhouse told him, that he had been &#145;worried and bullied out of office&#146; by Salisbury  (Steele, 137). That was at least partly true; although Northbrook pleaded family reasons, interpreted to mean anxiety to take his son and heir away from an unsuitable attachment formed in India. He had not been a masterful viceroy but a competent administrator with clear ideas about what was desirable and possible. Official India respected him: educated Indians, to whom the future belonged, believed he was their friend.<h2>
<a name="Homepoliticsthenavyandpublicopinion18761885"></a>Home politics, the navy, and public opinion, 1876&#150;1885</h2>If the earldom conferred (10 June 1876) by the tory government was in the nature of a routine promotion for a retiring viceroy, Northbrook's reputation stood high with his party when he returned home in May 1876. It rose higher when events justified his adherence to Lawrence's policy on the frontier. Under a new and weaker minister at the India Office, Lytton went further than Salisbury had envisaged: the disasters of 1879&#150;80 were the outcome. Northbrook privately allowed that, in the circumstances, Salisbury &#145;was more sinned against than sinning&#146;  (Mallet, 145). Gladstone made the former viceroy first lord of the Admiralty after the Liberals' election victory in 1880, with the understanding that the cabinet would also draw on his Indian expertise. He gave Lord Hartington at the India Office and Lord Ripon, as Lytton's replacement, the benefit of his advice. He was staunchly Gladstonian about withdrawing the troops sent into Afghanistan: &#145;To me the moral aspect of the question is the one to which I attach the greatest weight. What right have we to annex Afghanistan?&#146; He supported Ripon's resumption and extension of his own cautious liberalism in India, while counselling him &#145;not to forget &hellip; the lessons of the Mutiny&#146;  (Northbrook to Ripon, 22 Sept, 25 June 1880, BL, Add. MS 43570). When Ripon got into difficulties over the <span class="roman">Ilbert Bill</span>, Northbrook was equally mortified by the violent outcry from British expatriates at the prospect of having to appear before Indian magistrates. He championed the viceroy publicly, and in their correspondence suggested the compromise which saved &#145;the principle of &hellip; no race distinction in regard to &hellip; judges and magistrates &hellip; English or native&#146;, but narrowed its application  (Northbrook to Ripon, 12 Aug 1882, BL, Add. MS 43572). The pragmatism was evident, more controversially, in his response to the pressures on him at the Admiralty.<br>
<br>With his naval connections, Northbrook always believed in the classical Liberal doctrine of &#145;keeping up our naval strength rather than playing at being a great military power&#146;  (Northbrook to Mallet, 31 May 1874, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/22). Yet he and his Admiralty board were famously indicted by W. T. Stead in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> (September 1884) for their comparative neglect of the fleet. Writing half a century afterwards, the leading modern historian of the Victorian navy found Northbrook and his board guilty as charged of the gradual decline of the Royal Navy as a fighting force  (Marder, 120). France and Germany between them had more first-class ironclads than Britain; Russia and Italy were expanding their navies. Amid gathering international tensions, the public took fright. The reaction to Stead's articles compelled Northbrook to announce a dramatic increase in spending on construction and ordnance. Defending himself against the criticisms, he pleaded that it was impossible for any British government &#145;to undertake large expenditure in advance of the general feeling of the people&#146;. His estimates had been subject to Gladstone's political expectations of economy in the services (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 299, 14 July 1885, 624; Gladstone to Northbrook, 15 Dec 1880, Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 9.643). Moreover, the record showed that Northbrook and his professional advisers had hesitated over the admittedly difficult decisions that quickening technological change imposed. His standing never recovered, though he was able to demonstrate that within the limits set by domestic political considerations he had worked with the first naval lord, Admiral Cooper Key, to protect the navy from obsolescence.<h2>
<a name="TheEgyptianmission1884"></a>The Egyptian mission, 1884</h2>Northbrook approved of a temporary British occupation of Egypt in 1882 to secure the Suez Canal and keep the French out. Like Gladstone, he considered the defeated nationalist leader, Arabi Pasha, to be a &#145;mere military adventurer&#146;  (Northbrook to Ripon, 16 June 1882, BL, Add. MS 43577). Although privately critical of the premier's slowness to agree to the Gordon relief expedition, he supported the decision to abandon the Egyptian Sudan to the Mahdi and his followers. A Northbrook mission was first suggested in April 1884 before the breakdown of the London conference of creditor nations called to strike a balance between the claims of their bondholders, the interests of the Egyptian government and people, and those of the occupying power  (<span class="italic">Gladstone&#150;Granville Correspondence</span>, 2.180 n.1). The idea and the man were acceptable to Gladstone, who wanted to withdraw from Egypt with the minimum of delay, and to Hartington, who headed the more imperially minded wing of the cabinet. Their mutual choice stipulated that he should be accompanied by his cousin, Evelyn Baring, the British agent and consul-general in Cairo, then on home leave. Baring, Northbrook's influential private secretary in India, had become a central figure in Britain's relations with Egypt and her effective ruler. Northbrook said afterwards that he could not have carried out his hurried task (September&#150;October 1884) without the help of this &#145;Egyptian Whig&#146;, as Evelyn Baring described himself  (E. Baring to Sir A. C. Lyall, 6 Nov 1879, Lyall MSS, MS Eur. F. 132/3G). Opposed to annexation, and sharing Gladstone's conviction that it would be an &#145;unnatural proceeding&#146; to institute direct rule in what was, unlike India, a predominantly Muslim country, Northbrook had sided with the premier, and against Hartington, in preferring to see Egyptian neutrality secured by an international agreement that would permit the British to evacuate (Stanley, Derby diary, 7 May 1884, DER 920 (15); Northbrook to Ripon, 13 June 1884, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/4).<br>
<br>The most pressing problem in Egypt was financial: the London conference failed because France would not consent to a reduction in the interest paid to bondholders, the demand on which the British stood their ground. Northbrook was asked early in August to go out as a special commissioner and report urgently on the administration and finances. After their lengthy discussions before he left, Gladstone told him that he had accepted &#145;an impossible task and with the impossible no man can successfully contend&#146;. The premier could discern no escape from the financial impasse. On his side, it is clear, Northbrook did not allude to thoughts about a possible solution which he knew would be unpalatable to Gladstone. Nothing could be done &#145;without making some sacrifice ourselves&#146;, by way of a large British loan; he enjoined his friend Sir Reginald Welby of the Treasury to keep this &#145;<i>strictly and entirely</i> to yourself&#146; (Gladstone to Northbrook, 29 Aug 1884, Baring archive, Northbrook MSS, NP6/4/2/11; Northbrook to Welby, 30 Aug 1884, Baring archive, Northbrook MSS). The danger arising from French resentment of the British presence in Egypt, and Bismarck's encouragement of France, weighed heavily with him. In the plan which took shape soon after his arrival in the country the continental powers were to be placated by the assurance that their bondholders would be paid in full. As Gladstone objected, these proposals meant that the British taxpayers were to underwrite the bondholders; it was, in his eyes, an unwarrantable surrender to international pressure. &#145;I have recommended a pusillanimous policy for Egypt&#146;, Northbrook admitted, &#145;because I know we could not hold our own at sea if there was to be a war&#146;  (Northbrook to E. Baring, 7 Nov 1884, Baring archive, Northbrook MSS, NP 6/4/2/3(2)). To Gladstone the British loan was at the same time a &#145;Jingo policy&#146; that must strengthen the hands of those who wanted annexation, or at least an indefinite occupation  (<span class="italic">Gladstone&#150;Granville Correspondence</span>, 2.280). Northbrook reduced the figure for the loan from &pound;15 million to &pound;8 or &pound;9 million, but Gladstone was immovable. On the day he asked his colleague to go to Egypt, he had promised the Commons not to commit Britain to any financial obligations there without consulting the house  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 291, 2 Aug 1884, 1528&#150;9).<br>
<br>The disregard shown by the cabinet envoy for Gladstone's known position that &#145;Egypt &hellip; should &hellip; pay what and when she could&#146; infuriated the latter. In one of his rare lapses into profanity, the premier complained that Northbrook had &#145;&#147;bitched&#148; the whole concern from beginning to end&#146; (Gladstone to Granville, 24 Sept 1884, <span class="italic">Gladstone&#150;Granville Correspondence</span>, 2.266; Hamilton, 2.759). Gladstone had, it seems, conceived of the mission as a move in the campaign to get other creditor states to concede a reduction in the bondholders' interest. Northbrook's remaining proposals were overshadowed by the rejection of the loan and of a cut in the coupon. They included the substitution of British for Anglo-French administration of the railways and state lands, and more latitude for the Egyptian government in taxation. Coupled with a continuing British occupation for an unspecified period, they were designed to free Britain and Egypt from the legitimate intervention of the continental powers, and above all of France, based on Egyptian indebtedness. Their implementation would have made Evelyn Baring's indirect rule considerably easier and shortened his work of financial reconstruction. Gladstone simply refused to contemplate asking the Commons to sanction a guaranteed loan. With H. C. E. Childers, the chancellor of the exchequer, he set the Treasury to prepare an alternative solution and worked the press against Northbrook. Although all its peers favoured the Northbrook proposals, Hartington was the only member of the Commons in the cabinet to do so. &#145;I never had harder or more disheartening work in my life&#146;, wrote Northbrook just before he lost in December: &#145;Gladstone and Childers want to &#147;burke&#148; my recommendations altogether&#146; (Northbrook to E. Baring, 27 Nov 1884, Baring archive, Northbrook MSS, NP 6/4/2/3(2); &#145;Financial memorandum, 1884&#150;5&#146;, Baring archive, Northbrook MSS, NP 6/4/2/15). They succeeded: and his threatened resignation did not materialize. He had nothing to show for his efforts since August. Evelyn Baring's verdict stands: &#145;His mission was a failure&#146;  (Cromer, 2.371).<br>
<br>For the rest of the government's life Northbrook aligned himself with the cabinet critics of Gladstone's policy in Egypt and the Sudan, and was poised to resign more than once. The eventual solution to the problem of Egyptian finance, adopted by another London conference in March 1885, provided for an international guaranteed loan of &pound;9 million, with no reduction of existing interest payments beyond a small face-saving Egyptian tax on the coupon for two years. The bondholders and France had prevailed. Northbrook consoled himself with the thought that he had contributed to the slow amelioration of the fellahin's lot by his brief visit and two reports, one financial and the other on the country's prospects generally: &#145;If we can say we have got rid of the courbash and corv&eacute;e &hellip; we shall have done more for the people than all the dynasties&#146;  (memorandum, 29 Jan 1885, Baring archive, Northbrook MSS, NP 6/4/2/17).<h2>
<a name="Awhigtwilight18851904"></a>A whig twilight, 1885&#150;1904</h2>Northbrook had been a distinctly liberal whig, supporting Gladstone's Irish land bills of 1880&#150;82 with few of the misgivings that others felt. Nor does he appear to have had any serious qualms about Gladstone's handling of parliamentary reform in 1884. He made no secret, however, of his unhappiness with the way he had been treated over the Egyptian mission. Relieved to be out of office from June 1885, he declined Gladstone's offer of the viceroyalty of Ireland in the ministry formed in February 1886 to carry Irish home rule. He recognized the case for trying some form of home rule; he no longer had enough confidence in his party to join them in the experiment. From saying that he hoped the Liberals would be successful in a &#145;difficult and dangerous&#146; enterprise, he moved quickly to private and public denunciation of Gladstone, &#145;the ablest, &hellip; the most eloquent and, I am afraid, the most conscientiously unscrupulous leader &hellip; in the history of English politics&#146;, whose failures of policy, Northbrook now discovered, made him &#145;more than any other man&#146; responsible for the unrest in Ireland (Northbrook to Dufferin, 5 Feb, 30 July 1886, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/5; <span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 317, 6 July 1887, 902). Reflection had convinced him that there could only be one answer to &#145;the real question&#146;: was it right to hand Ireland over to &#145;Parnell &amp; Co.&#146;  (memorandum, 11 Oct 1887, J. Chamberlain MSS, JC/8/4/3/22)? Yet Northbrook was never really at home in the Unionist alliance; he had no hesitation in turning down an invitation to enter Salisbury's cabinet in January 1887 with G. J. Goschen. Shortly before his death in 1904 he was one of those who came out against Unionism's shift away from free trade.<br>
<br>Something of an innocent in politics, Northbrook was deficient in its basic skills. &#145;I did not feel myself at liberty to give information to the newspapers&#146;, he told Gladstone's private secretary when he learned that the press was being worked against his Egyptian proposals  (&#145;Financial memorandum, 1884&#150;5&#146;, Baring archive, Northbrook MSS, NP 6/4/2/15). While he had enjoyed electioneering in the past, and appeared regularly on Unionist platforms, he deplored the more heated atmosphere of the eighties: &#145;Oh, this constant extra-Parliamentary oratory, it is ruining us all&#146;, he lamented in 1885  (Mallet, 218). Northbrook was, perhaps, unfortunate in coming into conflict with two such formidable politicians as Salisbury and Gladstone. He was at his best in India, where the circumstances called for a period of consolidation. It has been unfairly said that he was &#145;frightened into inertia&#146;  (Gopal, 125). He understood better than some in his position the impact of Westernization and the nice judgements it demanded of liberal rulers. When he went to Egypt he secured the appointment to his staff of an Indian Muslim who could tell Egyptian notables of Northbrook's respect for the &#145;native raj&#146; in the princely states and of his solicitude for the peasantry  (Northbrook to Ripon, 8 Aug 1884, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/4). In his final report he strongly recommended lowering the land tax paid by the fellahin. His sympathy with a Westernized &eacute;lite and his political insight led him to establish, and largely maintain, a club for Indian students in London which bore his name. He urged Salisbury, who was known to have doubts about the small concession to Indian opinion involved, not to drop what eventually became the <span class="roman">Indian Councils Bill</span> of 1892, saying characteristically, &#145;the Congress agitation &hellip; not altogether a comfortable thing &hellip; is not now dangerous&#146;  (Northbrook to Salisbury, 10 June 1890, Baring archive, Northbrook MSS, NP 6/4/1/4).<br>
<br>A. O. Hume, the British administrator who founded the Indian National Congress and endorsed Northbrook's caution in the seventies, nevertheless described him as &#145;feeble&#146;, but rich in private and public virtues  (Gopal, 125). Physically strong, Northbrook filled much of his leisure with the traditional recreations of a wealthy countryman, besides yachting and continental travel, and was happiest fishing on the Itchen near his Hampshire home. Widely read, without being particularly intellectual, he sketched and painted in watercolours. He added to and cherished his impressive collection of old masters, mostly inherited from his uncle Thomas Baring on the latter's death in 1873, and was a generous patron and a friend of Edward Lear. In Lear's eyes, this reserved man was &#145;a luminous and amiable brick&#146;&#151;a glimpse of the humanity beneath a sometimes oppressive <i>gravitas</i>. A substantial share of his uncle's great fortune made him a much richer man. His income from urban landholdings on the southern edge of London and other non-agricultural investments enabled him to be a model landlord in town and country. In 1885 he was spending the gross rental of his 9000 acres in Hampshire on the upkeep of the estate  (<span class="italic">Carlingford's Journal</span>, 144). His standing in that county was acknowledged by his appointment as lord lieutenant in 1892, followed by the chairmanship of the county council from 1894 to his death.<br>
<br>An unostentatious piety underlay the sense of duty that offset a lifelong want of self-confidence. When his friend Lord Ripon, a convert to Catholicism, replaced Lytton in India, Northbrook sent him a copy of the prayer he had used himself as viceroy. &#145;I am but a little child&#146;, it ran in words taken from <span class="roman">1 Kings</span> 3: 7&#150;9; &#145;Thy servant is in the midst of a great people &hellip; give &hellip; an understanding heart to judge &hellip; that I may discern between good and bad&#146;  (Northbrook to Ripon, 17 Feb 1884, BL, Add. MS 43570). His beliefs were not as simple as this might suggest; he read and reread the sermons of John Henry Newman, among others. His ideal of a churchman was A. P. Stanley, someone with &#145;broad liberal views&#146; who did not &#145;push the dogmas of the Church of England to the detriment of the doctrines of Christianity&#146;  (Northbrook to Argyll, 21 March 1873, Northbrook MSS, MS Eur. C. 144/9). Christian divisions seemed insignificant to him beside the great religions of India. In his old age he compiled for the Indian mission field <span class="italic">The Teaching of Jesus Christ in his own Words</span> (1900); it had a huge circulation in English and in Indian languages. At home he used his chairmanship of the county council and of its education committee to select, personally, the Anglican, nonconformist, and Catholic members of a small <i>ad hoc</i> committee that devised an interdenominational syllabus for religious teaching subsequently taken up by several other counties as well.<br>
<br>Once the passions aroused by home rule in 1886 had begun to cool, Northbrook stepped easily into the part of elder statesman. He chaired a royal commission on the controversial question of mining royalties in 1890, and his views on Indian subjects were heard with respect. He died at his seat, Stratton Park, Hampshire, on 15 November 1904 and was buried four days later at Micheldever parish church, which he had restored. A privy councillor and GCSI (7 August 1869; 13 April 1876), FRS (8 January 1880), and the recipient of honorary doctorates from Oxford and Cambridge, he was succeeded by his elder and surviving son, Francis, Viscount Baring (<i>d</i>. 1929), a Liberal and then Unionist MP (1880&#150;85 and 1886&#150;92).<br>
