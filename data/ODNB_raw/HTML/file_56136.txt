<span class="headword">Voysey,  Charles</span>  (1828&#150;1912), <span class="occ">theistic preacher</span>, was born in London on 18 March 1828, the youngest son of <a name="cosubject_56136"></a><span class="headword">Annesley Voysey</span>  (<em>c.</em>1794&#150;1839)<span class="occ"></span> and his wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Green. His father, the son of Henry Voysey and Ann Maria Annesley, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ellison, was a direct descendant of John Wesley's sister, Susannah Ellison, and a noted architect. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53033/', "Henry Wesley Voysey")</script>, the geologist, was his brother. He was reputedly responsible for the first purpose-built office building in London, constructed <i>c</i>.1823 in Clement's Lane. He afterwards emigrated to Jamaica, where he died of fever on 5 August 1839. Charles Voysey passed from Stockwell grammar school to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1847 and graduated in 1851, when he was ordained and appointed to the curacy of Hessle, Hull. In 1852 he married Frances Maria, daughter of Robert Edlin, partner in the banking firm Herries, Farquhar &amp; Co. They had six daughters and four sons, the eldest being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36668/', "Charles Francis Annesley Voysey (1857&#150;1941)")</script>, the architect.<br>
<br>In 1858 Charles Voysey was appointed incumbent of St Andrew's, Craigton, Jamaica. After eighteen months he returned to England and, through A. P. Stanley's influence, obtained a curacy at Great Yarmouth, but six months later, in 1861, was appointed curate at St Mark's, Whitechapel. He was ejected from the curacy after preaching a sermon in which he denied the doctrine of eternal punishment. He was recommended in 1863 by the bishop of London, A. C. Tait, to the curacy of St Mark's, Victoria Docks, under Dr Henry Boyd, later of Hertford College, Oxford. Soon he became curate of Healaugh, near Tadcaster, and in 1864 became its vicar.<br>
<br>Voysey began his career as a religious reformer by the publication, in 1864, of a sermon <span class="italic">Is Every Statement in the Bible about our Heavenly Father Strictly True?</span>. It was withdrawn by Voysey after three editions when another clergyman involved in its production was censured. In 1865 he began the monthly publication of his sermons under the title <span class="italic">The Sling and the Stone</span>, which continued for six years. His sermons continued to be published after 1871, upwards of 1,250,000 copies being produced. His preaching and writing were denounced for unorthodoxy, and in 1869 he was required to appear before the chancellor's court of the diocese of York, where judgment was given against him. He appealed to the privy council and conducted his own defence, but the York chancellor's decision was upheld on 11 February 1871, and sentence of deprivation of his living was pronounced, to be rescinded if within a week Voysey expressly and unreservedly retracted the errors of which he had been convicted. This he refused to do. Before the judgment Voysey had begun to hold services in London at St George's Hall, Langham Place, to which he attracted a number of sympathizers, pledged to support the Voysey Establishment Fund. He thus started a movement which eventually took shape as an independent religious denomination under the name of the Theistic church. In 1885 he established for his followers a regular place of worship in Swallow Street, Piccadilly, where he continued to hold services for nearly thirty years. An observer of one of his services found it most remarkable for its similarity to the form of service of the Anglican church.<br>
<br>Voysey's ultimate theological position amounted to the rejection of the creeds, biblical inspiration, the sacramental system, and the divinity of Christ, and his teaching was the inculcation of a pure theism, without any miraculous element. He was an attractive preacher, courageous and sincere in challenging doctrines which he believed to be erroneous, and he undoubtedly had a profound influence in deepening the religious sense of his followers, among whom was Anne Besant. He was one of the founders of the Cremation Society of England, and for twenty-five years a member of the executive council of the Homes for Inebriates. In politics he was an ardent Unionist. He died at his home, Annesley Lodge, Platts Lane, Hampstead, on 20 July 1912. He was succeeded at Swallow Street by Walter Walsh, but within a short time two separate congregations were formed, one retaining the name of the Theistic church, the other adopting that of the Free Religious Movement. The Swallow Street building was closed in 1913 and shortly afterwards demolished.<br>
