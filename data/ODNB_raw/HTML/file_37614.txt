<span class="headword">Jones,  Mary</span>  (1707&#150;1778), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 8 March 1707 in Oxford, the second of four children of Oliver Jones, cooper, of St Aldates, and his second wife, one of the daughters (probably Mary) of Thomas Penn, a yeoman of South Newington near Banbury. Two younger brothers died in infancy; her elder brother, Oliver, became chanter and senior chaplain of Christ Church.<br>
<br>Jones learned French and Italian and was able to translate from Italian by the age of sixteen. She may have spent some years as a governess, since by 1730 she had formed friendships with an aristocratic circle including two women of Queen Caroline's household: Martha Lovelace, who in 1739 married Lord Henry Beauclerk and later became housekeeper at Windsor Castle, and Mrs Charlotte Clayton (&#145;Stella&#146; in Jones's verse), who became Lady Sundon in 1735. Jones regularly visited Martha at New Lodge, Windsor, and Charlotte at nearby Fern Hill. In contrast to these wealthy friends, she lived for most of her adult life modestly with her brother.<br>
<br>Information on Jones's life is mostly drawn from her <span class="italic">Miscellanies in Prose and Verse</span>. She began writing verses &#145;at a very early age&#146; with no view to publication. In April 1742 she found to her surprise that her ballad &#145;The Lass of the Hill&#146; was published in London, and about the same time her verses on the death of Lord Aubrey Beauclerk were printed, regardless of permission, by his widow. Jones comments: &#145;this &hellip; one gets by letting one's friends enjoy the pleasing secrets of one's writing.&#146;<br>
<br>About 1745 Jones published <span class="italic">A Letter to Dr Pitt</span>, a prose mock complaint to her neighbour at the condition of the boundary fence, with much play on the need of his medical skills to repair its &#145;paroxysms&#146; and &#145;epilepsies&#146;. She was now becoming reconciled to publication, and in 1748 was preparing a collection of her letters and poems. <span class="italic">Miscellanies in Prose and Verse</span> was published in 1750, with 1400 subscribers, &#145;for the sake of a relation, grown old and helpless &hellip; whom she had no other methods of effectually assisting&#146;. The volume was well received; extracts were published in the <span class="italic">London Magazine</span> throughout 1752. Sixteen poems appeared in <span class="italic">Poems by Eminent Ladies</span> in 1755.<br>
<br>Jones's literary acquaintance included Samuel Johnson, who called her &#145;the Chantress&#146;  (Boswell, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 1.322). Thomas Warton remembered her as &#145;a most sensible, agreeable and amiable woman&#146;  (ibid.). Her poetry is well crafted and witty, her subjects typically epitaphs, mild moral counsel, and light satire. She was much influenced by Pope: &#145;If Mr Pope could contrive to write without a Genius, I don't know anyone so likely to hit off my manner.&#146; Lonsdale  (p. 156) regards her as &#145;one of the most intelligent and amusing women writers of her period&#146;.<br>
<br>Jones lived in Oxford all her life, her final address being 16 Fish Street. At her death she was postmistress of Oxford. She died in Oxford on 10 February 1778, and was buried there four days later.<br>
