<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Amis, Sir  Kingsley William</span>  (1922&#150;1995), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 16 April 1922 at 102 South Side on the edge of Clapham Common in south London, the only child of William Robert Amis (1889&#150;1963), a senior clerk in the London office of J. J. Colman &amp; Co., the mustard manufacturer, and Rosa Annie (Peggy), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lucas (1891&#150;1957). The family milieu was suburban and lower-middle-class.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Amis was raised in Norbury, a ward of the borough of Croydon, and educated at St Hilda's primary school and Norbury College, and, in 1934, as a fee-paying pupil at the City of London School, located at Victoria Embankment, which his father and two uncles had attended before him (from 1935 he attended the school on scholarship). In August 1939 City of London was evacuated to Wiltshire, where it shared facilities with Marlborough College. Here Amis spent the final two years of his secondary education as a boarder. In 1940 the family moved to Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire within commuting distance of London (and outside the flight path of enemy bombers).<br>
<br>In April 1941 Amis went up to St John's College, Oxford, to read English as an exhibitioner (during the war the university allowed undergraduates to matriculate at the beginning of Hilary or Trinity terms). A week after his arrival in Oxford he met Philip Larkin, also reading English at St John's, and quickly formed a friendship which became the most important of both men's lives and a crucial shaping influence on post-war literature. At Oxford Amis was an open and active communist (he joined the party in June 1941), sang in the University Labour Club choir, and edited the club's <span class="italic">Bulletin</span> for a term. He also wrote poems for university periodicals and collaborated with Larkin on poems, stories, and parodies (often of writers on the Oxford syllabus). Amis's literary ambitions at Oxford were largely poetical. The most important contemporary influences on his early poetry, aside from Larkin, were W. H. Auden and William Empson; among living novelists, he and Larkin admired Christopher Isherwood, Graham Greene, Henry Green, and Julian Hall, author of <span class="italic">The Senior Commoner</span> (1933), &#145;a wonderful marsh-light of a novel whose influence in 1946 or so was to help to render unpublishable the predecessor of <span class="italic">Lucky Jim</span> [a novel entitled &#145;The Legacy&#146;]&#146;  (K. Amis, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 55).<br>
<br>Amis's undergraduate education was interrupted by the war. In July 1942 he joined the Royal Signals and in November 1943 was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Second Army headquarters signals, landing at Normandy in June 1944. He travelled with the Second Army through France, Belgium, and Germany, never once encountering enemy fire. During five months stationed at Sonnis in Belgium he attempted his first adult fiction, &#145;Who Else is Rank&#146;, an unfinished and unpublished 80,000-word novel jointly written with a fellow officer, E. Frank Coles, and closely based on the authors' wartime experiences (several stories in <span class="italic">My Enemy's Enemy</span>, 1962, his first collection of stories, were also inspired by the war). Amis was demobilized and returned to Oxford in October 1945.<br>
<br>Though Larkin had finished his studies at Oxford in June 1943 (he had been exempted from military service because of poor eyesight) the two friends kept in close touch by letter and through occasional visits, Larkin to Oxford and Amis to Leicester, where Larkin worked from 1946 to 1950 at the university library. Amis's first book of verse, <span class="italic">Bright November</span>, which drew on his wartime experience, was published in 1947. In December of that year he was awarded a first-class degree and began work on a BLitt thesis entitled &#145;English non-dramatic poetry 1840&#150;1900 and the Victorian reading public&#146;, first under Lord David Cecil, then under F. W. Bateson (the thesis was not completed until May 1950 and was failed in November, partly, Amis suspected, because of opposition from Cecil, one of its examiners). On 21 January 1948 Amis married Hilary Ann (Hilly) Bardwell (1928&#150;2010), a student at the Ruskin School of Art, Oxford (and daughter of Leonard Sidney Bardwell, a retired staff officer at the Ministry of Agriculture), whom he had first met in January 1946. Their first child, Philip, was born on 15 August 1948; their second son, the writer Martin Amis, was born on 25 August 1949; a daughter, Sally, was born in 1954.<h2>
<a name="LuckyJim"></a>Lucky Jim</h2>In October 1949, after several unsuccessful applications to universities in Britain and abroad, Amis was appointed an assistant lecturer in English at the University College of Swansea. Amis enjoyed teaching there and got on well with his colleagues, but the family had very little money. Amis had to supplement his income by outside examining and extramural teaching, while his wife took on part-time work as a cleaner. Despite his failure to find a publisher for his novel &#145;The Legacy&#146;, late in 1949 he embarked on a second novel, provisionally titled &#145;Dixon and Christine&#146;. With Larkin's help and encouragement, plus Hilly's timely inheritance of a small legacy (enabling the family to move into a bigger house, one with a room of his own for writing), a first draft was finished in November 1951. In April 1953 a much revised version of this draft, retitled <span class="italic">Lucky Jim</span>, was accepted by Victor Gollancz and its publication in January 1954 transformed Amis's life. <span class="italic">Lucky Jim</span> was soon a financial and critical success: 7500 copies were in print by mid-February, 12,000 by the end of the year, in sixteen Gollancz-style mini-impressions; the American rights were sold to Doubleday, and film rights were sold to the Boulting brothers.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Lucky Jim</span> has been described as the finest comic novel of its generation, the earliest and most influential of &#145;campus&#146; or &#145;redbrick&#146; novels, and a key text both of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93790', "Movement")</script>, the pre-eminent poetical grouping of the period, and of the &#145;angry young men&#146;. According to Amis, its success derived from traditional comic ingredients: &#145;a young man at odds with his surroundings, and trying to make his way, and suffering comic misfortunes, and getting the girl&#151;it can't fail, really&#146;  (McDermott, 54). Others saw it as heralding important social changes. To the novelist David Lodge, Amis <blockquote>articulated through his hero, Jim Dixon, the feelings of a much larger number of people in the next generation (my own) who were products of the 1944 <span class="roman">Education Act</span> and the Welfare State. Through the comedy of Jim's private fantasies and accidental breaches of social decorum, Amis gave us, as it were, permission not to be overawed by the social and cultural codes of the class to which we had been elevated by education. It was enormously liberating. (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>)</blockquote>Amis was not always comfortable with such readings. Though Jim is often at odds with polite or established codes and norms, he is no rebel, which is in part why Amis consistently deplored the novel's association with the angry young men. &#145;There was no anger&#146;, Amis has declared, &#145;unless a mild, usually amused and very intermittent irritation can be called anger&#146;  (McDermott, 21). As for the angry young man phenomenon itself, Amis called it &#145;a phantom creation of literary journalists&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Kingsley Amis</span>, 704). The novel's association with the Movement, in contrast, was more substantial. The term itself was coined in 1954 by J. D. Scott, literary editor of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, who applied it to Amis, John Wain, Elizabeth Jennings, Thom Gunn, John Holloway, Donald Davie, D. J. Enright, and Iris Murdoch (Larkin was a later addition). Movement writers, Scott claimed, were &#145;bored by the despair of the Forties, not much interested in suffering, and extremely impatient of poetic sensibility, especially poetic sensibility about &#147;the writer and society&#148;&#146;. The Movement was &#145;anti-phoney&#146;, &#145;anti-wet&#146;, its prevailing tone was &#145;sceptical, robust, ironic, prepared to be as comfortable as possible&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 1 Oct 1954, 399&#150;400). This description Amis characterized as &#145;useful up to a point&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Kingsley Amis</span>, 405), and though he often resisted the Movement label also helped to publicize it.<h2>
<a name="Fame"></a>Fame</h2>The success of <span class="italic">Lucky Jim</span> coincided with Amis's growing visibility as a poet. Both Amis and Larkin, as well as other poets soon to be associated with the Movement, were represented in <span class="italic">New Poems 1952</span>, a PEN publication. At a party to celebrate the book's launch, Amis met Robert Conquest, who became a lifelong friend and collaborator (notably as co-author of the 1965 novel <span class="italic">The Egyptologists</span>). John Wain, a former student and fellow at St John's, and lecturer in English at Reading, was the most energetic publicist both of Amis and of the Movement writers in general. Wain not only commissioned an extract from <span class="italic">Lucky Jim</span> to be broadcast on the first programme of the radio series <span class="italic">First Reading</span>, but helped to arrange for the publication at the end of the year of a second volume of Amis's poems, <span class="italic">A Frame of Mind</span>, as part of a series of limited editions of new poets. A third slim volume, <span class="italic">Kingsley Amis: No. 22, the Fantasy Poets</span>, was published in the same month as <span class="italic">Lucky Jim</span>. Despite Amis's association with the Movement, these early poems are often obscure, impersonal, &#145;difficult&#146;, unlike the more mature verse, which is closer in manner and subject matter to the fiction.<br>
<br>Amis's second novel, <span class="italic">That Uncertain Feeling</span> (1955), shared the provincial setting and subversive humour of <span class="italic">Lucky Jim</span>. It also contained a satirical portrait of a poet very much like Dylan Thomas, among the most prominent of Movement <i>b&ecirc;tes noires</i>. It was published several months after Amis's return from a summer in Portugal, a trip financed by a Somerset Maugham award for <span class="italic">Lucky Jim</span>. Though Amis professed to hate foreign travel, his experiences in Portugal provided him with the materials for a third novel, <span class="italic">I Like it Here</span> (1958). Between 1955 and 1958 Amis published a fourth volume of poems, <span class="italic">A Case of Samples: Poems 1946&#150;1956</span>, and appeared in two influential anthologies: D. J. Enright's <span class="italic">Poets of the 1950s</span>, considered something of a Movement manifesto, and Conquest's <span class="italic">New Lines</span>, both published in 1956. He also took on a number of literary and journalistic commissions: he published fiction reviews, essays, and short stories in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> and elsewhere (for the most part Amis's literary criticism, collected in <span class="italic">What became of Jane Austen? and other questions</span> (1970) and <span class="italic">The Amis Collection</span> (1990) appeared initially in non-academic periodicals); edited <span class="italic">Oscar Wilde: Poems and Essays</span> (1956); began reviewing jazz records for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> (from 1956 to 1958); wrote a BBC radio play, <span class="italic">Touch and Go</span> (1957), the first of several commissions for radio and television; and a pamphlet for the Fabian Society, <span class="italic">Socialism and the Intellectuals</span> (1957).<br>
<br>After his return from the war Amis had allowed his membership in the Communist Party to lapse. The Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 turned him into a firm and total anti-communist. Though in March 1956 he publicly protested against the Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of Egypt, he described himself in <span class="italic">Socialism and the Intellectuals</span> (1957) as anti-activist. Self-interest, he now declared, was &#145;the best and most trustworthy political motive&#146; (though he also lamented the absence of more respectable motives in the current political climate: &#145;no Spain, no fascism, no mass unemployment&#146;; pp. 13, 7). In the years to follow, Amis moved steadily to the right, in part out of principle, in part out of a congenital opposition to fashion, though he continued to vote Labour until the general election of 1966, when he voted for the anti-Common Market candidate.<br>
<br>Chief among the offshoots of Amis's growing fame in the late 1950s was an invitation from R. P. Blackmur to spend a year at Princeton University as a visiting fellow in creative writing and to deliver the Christian Gauss seminars in criticism, in the spring of 1959. Somewhat to his surprise, Amis enjoyed his year at Princeton; he even enjoyed teaching creative writing. At Blackmur's suggestion, he chose science fiction, a lifelong interest, as the topic of his Gauss seminars. These were eventually published in 1960 as <span class="italic">New Maps of Hell: a Survey of Science Fiction</span>, the first book-length study of the genre to be written by a critic from an academic background. Amis kept up his association with science fiction both by reviewing it for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> (from 1960 to 1965) and by a five-year stint co-editing <span class="italic">Spectrum: a Science Fiction Anthology</span> (1961&#150;5), with Robert Conquest. While at Princeton, Amis also lectured at a number of east coast universities, reviewed &#145;foreign&#146; films for <span class="italic">Esquire</span>, and frequented jazz clubs in Manhattan. Though sorely tempted to stay on in the United States, he and his family returned to Swansea in July 1959.<br>
<br>In 1960 Amis published <span class="italic">Take a Girl Like You</span>, his fourth and longest novel, and mostly told, unlike its predecessors, from the heroine's point of view. This story, derived in part from Richardson's <span class="italic">Clarissa</span>, is of the protracted seduction of Jenny Bunn, a sexually and socially innocent primary schoolteacher. Jenny's seducer, Patrick Standish, is as clever, witty, and subversive as previous Amis heroes, but much more predatory. Patrick inaugurates a line of deeply flawed male characters in Amis's writing of the 1960s and early 1970s, one that includes Dai Evans, the hero of <span class="italic">The Evans Country</span> (1962), a sequence of six poems (expanded to eleven when it appeared in a subsequent volume, <span class="italic">A Look Round the Estate: Poems 1957&#150;1967</span>); Roger Micheldene, in the novel <span class="italic">One Fat Englishman</span> (1963); Ronnie Appleyard, in <span class="italic">I Want it Now</span> (1968); and Sir Roy Vandervane, in <span class="italic">Girl, 20</span> (1971). Amis identified <span class="italic">Take a Girl Like You</span> as his favourite novel, but its cruelty, particularly that of its ending, in which a drunk Jenny is seduced by Patrick, shocked many readers, beginning with its American publisher (who sought to have the ending rewritten). The novel anticipates and dissects the new sexual morality of the 1960s, and may have been fuelled in part by tensions in Amis's private life. Amis's marriage had been stormy from the start, largely because of his compulsive philandering, but in the late 1950s and early 1960s it was especially troubled.<h2>
<a name="Anewlife"></a>A new life</h2>In April 1961 Amis was offered a fellowship in English at Peterhouse, Cambridge, making him the college's first fellow and director of studies in English. Though largely content at Swansea, he accepted the new post in the hope that it would afford him more time for his own writing. This hope proved unfounded, and the life of a Cambridge don was not to his taste. In December 1962 he resigned his fellowship, though he continued teaching at Peterhouse until the end of the academic year. At the same time the tensions in his marriage came to a head. In the previous October he had begun an affair with the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard (1923&#150;2014), a much more serious affair than its predecessors, and one which precipitated a split with his wife and family the following summer. In September, Amis moved to London to live with Jane Howard (her name to friends and family) and to pursue a full-time writing career. They married on 29 June 1965.<br>
<br>Amis's fifth novel, <span class="italic">One Fat Englishman</span> (1963), set on a college campus in the United States, draws on his experiences at Princeton. Its obnoxious hero, Roger Micheldene, is pathologically aggressive: &#145;Of the seven deadly sins, Roger considered himself qualified in gluttony, sloth and lust but distinguished in anger&#146;  (p. 10). This anger is manifested in a sneering attitude to all things American, an attitude Amis meant to discredit, in part because it was so common among educated Englishmen. Roger is a lapsed Catholic, and beneath his anger sounds a note of metaphysical or religious despair, one Amis would develop in subsequent novels, in particular <span class="italic">The Anti-Death League</span> (1966). Amis's own religious upbringing had been low-church, &#145;strong in morality, rudimentary and quite uninsistent in matters of doctrine&#146;, and though he claimed never to have attended, &#145;voluntarily or otherwise, any act of worship as such&#146;, or to have consulted the <span class="roman">Bible</span> or any other religious writing &#145;in the hope of spiritual comfort or ethical guidance&#146;  (McDermott, 9), he was well versed both in scripture and in Christian doctrine.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Anti-Death League</span> mounts a ferocious attack not only on those who would deny or refuse to contemplate the evils of the world, but on the Christian God. It also marks a formal as well as thematic departure for Amis. Though the most self-consciously serious of his novels, its plot draws on elements from popular or genre fiction, including espionage, fantasy, and science fiction. This interest in popular fiction, heralded by two &#145;studies&#146; of James Bond novels (<span class="italic">The James Bond Dossier</span> and <span class="italic">The Book of Bond, or, Every Man his Own 007</span>, both published in 1965), was developed in his own Bond thriller, <span class="italic">Colonel Sun</span> (1968), published under the pseudonym Robert Markham; in <span class="italic">The Green Man</span> (1969), a ghost story (as concerned with theological or religious questions as <span class="italic">The Anti-Death League</span>); in <span class="italic">The Riverside Villas Murder</span> (1973), a classic detective story; and in <span class="italic">The Alteration</span> (1976), an &#145;alternate world&#146; novel. Of these experiments with genre fiction the most important are <span class="italic">The Alteration</span> and <span class="italic">The Riverside Villas Murder</span>. <span class="italic">The Alteration</span>, an attempt to imagine what England would have been like in 1976 had the Reformation never occurred, is among the most intricate and inventive of Amis's novels; <span class="italic">The Riverside Villas Murder</span>, while strictly honouring the conventions of the murder story, is also a loving and meticulous reconstruction of suburban life in the 1930s, drawing on many details from his own childhood.<br>
<br>Amis's oppositional character, and increasing conservatism, brought him much into the public eye in this period. With Robert Conquest, he contributed several articles to Brian Cox and A. E. Dyson's anti-progressive &#145;Black papers on education&#146; (1969&#150;77), opposing university expansion, as well as other educational reforms and trends (he had already published an influential article in <span class="italic">Encounter</span> in 1960 deploring the expansion of higher education, partly on the grounds that &#145;More will mean worse&#146;, a phrase which gained wide currency). He also became involved in a long and acrimonious correspondence in the popular and periodical press over the Vietnam War, which he supported. His anti-communism took on a new intensity in these years, inspired in part by Robert Conquest's powerful exposure of Stalinist atrocities in <span class="italic">The Great Terror</span> (1968). He spearheaded a campaign in 1968 against Yevgeny Yevtushenko's candidacy for the chair of poetry at Oxford University, an elective post. He publicly condemned the left totalitarianism of Che Guevara, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. Yet he was also an outspoken opponent of racism and capital punishment. In 1967 Amis was invited to lecture for a term on modern British fiction at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where the racism he and Jane Howard encountered distressed them not only for its own sake, but because of its likely effect on conservative causes: &#145;It would take some strength of mind not to say, in effect, &#147;anybody who thinks like that about Negroes must be wrong about everything. Stop US murder in Vietnam!&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Kingsley Amis</span>, 689).<br>
<br>On their return from Tennessee (and a brief trip to Mexico) in March 1968, Amis and Howard purchased a large house in Barnet, Hertfordshire, the upkeep of which, both financial and physical, contributed to tensions in their marriage. These were the years when Amis's drinking became especially heavy. Amis was a lifelong drinker and connoisseur of drink, and though alcohol rarely interfered with his capacity to work, it could make him irascible and paranoid. It may also have impaired his sex drive. In the mid-1970s Amis and Howard consulted several sex therapists after what, in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (1991), he describes as &#145;various difficulties had arisen between us&#146;  (p. 117). These difficulties, and the therapy sessions themselves, are drawn on to comic effect in <span class="italic">Jake's Thing</span> (1978), a novel marked by a newly pointed animus to women. In July 1976 he and Jane Howard moved to Gardnor House, in Flask Walk, Hampstead, but the marriage continued to deteriorate; in September 1979 Amis announced to Larkin a &#145;total loss of sex-drive&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Kingsley Amis</span>, 876). Less than a year later, in November 1980, Jane Howard left him, refusing to return until he promised to give up drinking totally.<h2>
<a name="Laterlife"></a>Later life</h2>The breakup of Amis's second marriage occasioned the longest gap between novels in his career. Two years after <span class="italic">Jake's Thing</span>, Amis published <span class="italic">Russian Hide-and-Seek</span> (1980), the second and weaker of his &#145;alternate world&#146; novels (it is set in a twenty-first-century England ruled by the Soviets). Two years between novels was a standard interval for Amis. <span class="italic">Stanley and the Women</span> took him four years to complete, and, as his correspondence suggests, caused him uncharacteristic difficulty and self-doubt. During these years Amis busied himself with other projects: he campaigned in the press against arts subsidies, slovenly and incorrect language use, and a mentality labelled &#145;sod the public&#146; (&#145;the working slogan not only of government, the service industry and the retail trade, but also &hellip; of interior designers, providers of culture, playwrights, composers and many more&#146;; <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, 19 Oct 1985, reprinted in <span class="italic">The Amis Collection</span>, 229); he edited the anthology <span class="italic">The Golden Age of Science Fiction</span> (1981); started a column on drink in the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> (1982), which became <span class="italic">Every Day Drinking</span> (1983); and was appointed poetry editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, choosing and introducing a poem a day, Monday to Friday (both poems and introductions were reprinted in 1984 as <span class="italic">The Pleasures of Poetry</span>). Though he continued to write the occasional poem after the publication of <span class="italic">Collected Poems, 1944&#150;1979</span> (1979), he produced no further collections of verse.<br>
<br>The darkness and aggression of <span class="italic">Stanley and the Women</span> mark a nadir in Amis's life. Though the novel had its defenders (even among female reviewers), the harshness of its treatment of women was much deplored, and rumour had it that its initial failure to find an American publisher derived from opposition among feminist editors. Amis was an increasingly embattled and embittered figure in these years. Though slim and handsome in youth and early middle age, he began to put on weight and his face grew puffy and red. Though a gregarious and clubbable man, as funny in person as on paper, he developed a reputation for rudeness and impatience, an impression he partly cultivated. Amis was prone to neuroses and hypochondria throughout his life, but was especially anxious during these years. Always frightened of flying and unable to drive a car, he now feared travelling of any sort, and was terrified of being left on his own at night. His life was ruled by an increasingly rigid and narrow routine: writing in the morning, drinks and lunch at his club, the Garrick, writing again in the late afternoon, perhaps after a nap, then supper, television, more drink, and a sleeping pill.<br>
<br>After the breakup of his second marriage, Amis's sons devised a remarkable plan for his living arrangements. They suggested that he move in with his first wife, Hilly, her third husband, Lord Kilmarnock, and their son Jaime. Much to the amazement of all concerned, the arrangement lasted. Amis paid the bills and the Kilmarnocks did the housework and cooking. The result, Martin Amis has suggested, was a return to creative health  (M. Amis, 312&#150;13). Two years after the publication of <span class="italic">Stanley and the Women</span>, Amis published <span class="italic">The Old Devils</span>, a work every bit as darkly comic, caustic, and clear-sighted as its predecessors (including <span class="italic">Ending Up</span> (1974) an earlier novel of old age), but also suffused with regret and affection, both for Wales and for lost (and recovered) love. <span class="italic">The Old Devils</span> won the Booker prize and was followed in customary two-yearly intervals by four other novels: <span class="italic">Difficulties with Girls</span> (1988), a sequel to <span class="italic">Take a Girl Like You</span> (in which Jenny Bunn is again a wholly sympathetic heroine); <span class="italic">The Folks that Live on the Hill</span> (1990), published in the same year Amis was knighted (he had been appointed CBE in 1981); <span class="italic">The Russian Girl</span> (1992); and <span class="italic">You Can't Do Both</span> (1994), perhaps Amis's most autobiographical novel. Amis's final novel, <span class="italic">The Biographer's Moustache</span>, was published in 1995 (to poor reviews, unlike its immediate predecessors). During this period of late productivity Amis also edited <span class="italic">The Great British Songbook</span> (1986) with James Cochrane; reissued an expanded version of his <span class="italic">Collected Short Stories</span> (1987, originally published 1980); edited <span class="italic">The Amis Anthology</span> (1989), described in the introduction as &#145;a collection of my favourite poems&#146;; began several restaurant columns in magazines; published his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, <span class="italic">We are All Guilty</span>, a novel for young adults (both in 1991), and a final collection of short stories, <span class="italic">Mrs. Barrett's Secret and other Stories</span> (1993).<br>
<br>Late in August 1995, while on his annual summer holiday in Swansea, Amis had a fall and suspected stroke. He was hospitalized in London, his condition deteriorated, and on 22 October, after contracting pneumonia, he died in St Pancras Hospital. At the time of his death he was at work on a new novel, provisionally titled &#145;Black and White&#146;, and had all but completed the posthumously published <span class="italic">The King's English: a Guide to Modern Usage</span> (1997). His body was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 31 October and a funeral service was held at St Mark's Church, near the home he shared with the Kilmarnocks in Primrose Hill. A year later, at a packed memorial service in St Martin-in-the-Fields, he was hailed as the funniest and most gifted British novelist of his generation. A selection of his letters was published in 2000.<br>
