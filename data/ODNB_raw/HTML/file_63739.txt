<span class="headword">Smith,  Eric Edward Dorman  Dorman-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>later </em>Eric Edward Dorman O'Gowan]</span>  (1895&#150;1969), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 24 July 1895 at Bellamont Forest, Cootehill, co. Cavan, Ireland, the first of the three sons of Edward Dorman-Smith (1870&#150;1947), justice of the peace, and his wife, Amy (1874&#150;1961), daughter of Edith and William Patterson of Liverpool. Dorman-Smith was educated alone at home until he was twelve and then at Lambrook preparatory school, near Maidenhead, and Uppingham School. Distinguished by an unwavering sense of principle, a brilliant mind, and an oblique Anglo-Irish perception of the British establishment, he would at the height of his powers sum himself up, accurately, as a military scientist. His effect on the twentieth century, though, was to be twofold, from the opposite angles of military history and literature.<br>
<br>Sprung with nervous energy, tall, thin, immaculately dressed and as capable of charming as of antagonizing, Dorman-Smith was nicknamed Chink because of his resemblance to his regiment's mascot, a Chinkara antelope. As a real-life hero of the First World War, the embodiment of chivalry, he inspired his friend Ernest Hemingway's lasting preoccupation with the themes of war and honour. And as deputy chief of staff and principal adviser to Claude Auchinleck, commander-in-chief in the Middle East, his operational advice based on Ultra decrypts of enemy Enigma signals was instrumental in halting Rommel's Afrika Korps at the first battle of Alamein in July 1942, now acknowledged as a critical turning point for the allies in the Second World War.<br>
<br>Dorman-Smith passed out of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, after two terms in February 1914 and joined the Northumberland Fusiliers, with whom he travelled to France at the outbreak of the First World War; he was in battle at Mons within ten days. He was to be badly wounded three times, awarded one of the first MCs at Ypres in 1915, and mentioned three times in dispatches when, with the acting rank of major at the age of twenty-four, he fired Hemingway's imagination at their first meeting in Milan on armistice day 1918. In the twenties his army leaves were spent with Hemingway in Switzerland, Paris, and Pamplona, mingling with John Dos Passos, Gertrude Stein, Ford Maddox Ford, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, and Scott Fitzgerald, and he stood as godfather to Hemingway's first son.<br>
<br>In his parallel army life Dorman-Smith rose rapidly, from adjutant of his regiment (1919) to instructor at Sandhurst (1924), and at the Staff College, Camberley (1927&#150;9), he was awarded 1000 out of 1000 in the tactics entrance paper, a record that was never emulated. In 1931 he became brigade major to Archibald Wavell at 6th experimental brigade, and from 1934, as brevet lieutenant-colonel, he advanced mechanization development from the War Office. After a spell at the Staff College as an instructor he commanded his regiment in Egypt from 1937, before being appointed director of military training in India (1938&#150;40), Britain's greatest single military commitment.<br>
<br>Fuelled by anger at the losses witnessed in trench warfare, Dorman-Smith determined to right matters through intelligent tactics based on out-thinking the enemy and on speed of mechanization, which set him at odds with the cavalry and traditionalists. At the Staff College, where lasting impressions for future teamwork take shape, his open contempt for orthodoxy and for contemporaries who went &#145;by the book&#146; gained him a reputation for arrogance, and led some who would later gain high command to detest him. At the War Office he blithely ignored the directive forbidding contact with the military journalist Basil Liddell Hart, whose tactical &#145;Theory of the Indirect Approach&#146; matched his own conclusions. He took pride in not being a clubbable man, and the social skills of his popular first wife Estelle, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dawson (<i>b</i>. 1903), whom he had married in 1927 after her divorce from Sir Thomas Berney, bt, smoothed his path. But in 1940 he chafed at being in a &#145;schoolmaster's role&#146;, as commandant of the Haifa Staff College in Palestine.<br>
<br>Two successive commanders-in-chief, Middle East, however, made use of Dorman-Smith's skill at crucial junctures in the Second World War. Wavell brought him in to plan the initial moves of the small western desert force in October 1940 that resulted in the destruction of the Italian Tenth Army, which had been poised to take Egypt. And from 24 May 1942, when the Eighth Army's defeat at Gazala made the pivotal loss of Cairo and Alexandria appear inevitable, it was his unorthodox counsel that enabled Auchinleck to outmanoeuvre Rommel and plan the Eighth Army's subsequent strategy. But upon Churchill's preferment that August of Bernard Montgomery as general officer commanding, Eighth Army, whose tactical thinking Dorman-Smith scorned as &#145;taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut&#146;, disillusion and the inability to trim led to dismissal and reduction from acting major-general to his substantive rank of colonel; isolation was compounded by rumours of a love affair. Although given command of a brigade in Italy in 1944, he was again dismissed, this time under circumstances traceable to an old Staff College vendetta. <span class="italic">Across the River and into the Trees</span> (1950), a bleak novel about military disillusion, would be Hemingway's lament.<br>
<br>Dorman-Smith returned to Ireland, changed his name by deed poll to O'Gowan in 1949, and devoted himself to his young family&#151;a son (Christopher) and a daughter (Rionagh), both born to his second wife, Eve Nott, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Harben (<i>b</i>. 1913), whom he married on 17 May 1949&#151;as well as to correspondence, scholarship, and his classical Palladian home. His first marriage had ended in divorce in 1948. As memoirs of the Second World War emerged he fought the smear of Montgomery's supporters that Auchinleck had been intending to retreat at Alamein if Rommel attacked again. Libel proceedings against Churchill over <span class="italic">The History of the Second World War, <span class="roman">vol. 4</span>, The Hinge of Fate</span> (1951), were withdrawn only after Hartley Shawcross, who was advising Churchill, disclosed the prime minister's ill health. Having been implacably against partition since 1921, and having become increasingly bitter at the supremacy of the Montgomery version of wartime events, O'Gowan allowed his estate near the border to be used for IRA training camps in the mid-fifties. Opposing loyalties, however, were compartmentalized, with his knowledge of Ultra and his personal army contacts remaining confidential. As with the intermix of Hemingway escapades and formal regimental life thirty years before, he was adept at keeping two worlds apart. &#145;I know what I owe to you&#146;, Auchinleck wrote privately in the 1960s,<blockquote>and realise very clearly, as I have always done, that without your wise and indomitable thinking always at my side and in my head, we could never have saved Egypt &hellip; and all the rest &hellip; The &#145;voice&#146; was certainly yours, even if the &#145;hands&#146; were mine. (Auchinleck to O'Gowan, 5 July 1967, JRL)</blockquote>O'Gowan died from cancer at Lisdarne Hospital, co. Cavan, on 11 May 1969, and was buried at the church of St John the Evangelist, Dartry, co. Monaghan, Ireland.<br>
