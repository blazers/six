<span class="headword">Maynard,  Edward</span>  (1654&#150;1740), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 23 August 1654 at Daventry, Northamptonshire, the son of William Maynard of that town. He matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford, on 21 October 1670, aged fifteen, and became a demy of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1672. He graduated BA in 1674 and proceeded MA in 1677.<br>
<br>In 1678 Maynard became a fellow of Magdalen, and was college bursar in 1687&#150;8. He was inevitably involved in the conflict between the fellows and the crown which followed the death of the college president, Henry Clerke, on 24 March 1687. When the fellows chose John Hough as president in defiance of the king's nomination of the Catholic Anthony Farmer, Maynard stood as the second candidate required by the college's election process and formally presented the successful Hough to the college visitor. During the assault on the autonomy of the college which ensued Maynard took refuge at Coleshill, the Warwickshire seat of William Digby, fifth Baron Digby of Geashill. When in November 1687 most of the fellows refused to submit to the king's new choice, Samuel Parker, Maynard escaped expulsion because he had formal leave of absence to serve as Digby's chaplain. In August the following year Maynard and the handful of remaining Anglican fellows were expelled by Parker's Catholic successor Bonaventure Gifford on the formal grounds of non-residence but in reality because of their refusal to acknowledge him as their lawful president. Maynard was restored with his colleagues to his fellowship in October 1688, following the beleaguered James's reversal of policies. Maynard proceeded BD in 1688 and DD in 1691.<br>
<br>However, Maynard does not seem to have spent much time at his college following his restoration, continuing to spend much of his time at Digby's. In November 1691 he was appointed preacher at Lincoln's Inn, a position which required his attendance in London except during the four summer months of the long vacation. He finally resigned his fellowship in July 1694 following his marriage on 10 April to Barbara Harris (1661/2&#150;1704), daughter of Thomas Harris of Worcester, who had been a judge on the Welsh circuits. In 1696 Maynard was presented by the earl of Sunderland to the rectory of Boddington, Northamptonshire, a living which he held until his death forty-four years later. He continued to serve at Lincoln's Inn during term time until relinquishing the post in May 1699 for health reasons.<br>
<br>In 1738 Maynard looked back on his Northamptonshire pastorate in <span class="italic">Memoirs Concerning Parsons and the Parsonage of Bodington</span>, which combined an account of his predecessors with elements of autobiography and in particular of the tangible aspects of his four decades in the parish. He discussed, for instance, tithes, his repairs to the chancel of the church and to the rectory, and the causeway that he had built out of his own pocket because the village's roads were so dirty and broken &#145;that I could not see how they could safely bring up corpses to Church&#146;  (Maynard, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 13). He recalled how he decided against challenging the dubious claim of the parishioners of the lower part of the town that they only owed him 9<i>s</i>. a year for the tithe on milk. Considering both the legal advice of his friends at Lincoln's Inn and &#145;my great love to peace added to all, I was not long in concluding not to make my whole life uneasy and my ministry most unprofitable amongst them by engaging in an endless suit&#146;  (ibid., 19&#150;20).<br>
<br>From 1701 until his resignation in 1706 Maynard was also rector of Passenham, Northamptonshire. From 1700 until his death Maynard was canon and precentor of Lichfield Cathedral. There his first wife, who died on 25 March 1704, aged forty-two, was buried. By licence dated 10 April 1705 he married at Woodford, Northamptonshire, Elizabeth Archer, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hastings (1664/5&#150;1736), daughter of William Hastings of Hinton, in Woodford. From 1719 until his death Maynard was master of the hospital of St John, Lichfield, undertaking repairs and alterations to the then derelict buildings, which improvements remained for the next 240 years.<br>
<br>Maynard maintained his connection with the Digby family, and it was a meeting at Lord Digby's house which led Maynard to edit and publish a second edition of Sir William Dugdale's <span class="italic">History of St Paul's</span> in 1716. In the preface Maynard explained how Dugdale's grandson had shown him there the manuscript that Sir William had been preparing for a second edition at the time of his death. Maynard undertook to find a printer and to have some of the worn plates restored. In the preface Maynard prided himself on having &#145;done a service acceptable to the Publick, and obliged the Lovers of Antiquity&#146;. Maynard's edition included a continuation of the history of the cathedral down to 1685 and an addition concerning cathedrals and collegiate churches in the province of York. In 1722&#150;24 Maynard published some of the sermons that he had preached at Oxford and Lincoln's Inn many years before, including &#145;two discourses on natural and reveal'd religion&#146;. The latter, he claimed, were the first sermons he had preached at Oxford, heavily revised during his Warwickshire sojourn in 1687&#150;8 in the light of the &#145;Ancient Moralists&#146; he had then been studying so that they now read more like tracts than sermons  (Maynard, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, preface). He had developed a sermon which he had first delivered in Oxford in 1686 on the resurrection into four which he had preached at Lincoln's Inn in the 1690s, &#145;with a particular Eye to the Socinians&#146;  (ibid.)&#151;now published over a quarter of a century since the council of Lincoln's Inn had urged him to publish one of them.<br>
<br>Maynard died on 13 April 1740 at Boddington and was buried in Boddington church. With no surviving children his will mixed bequests to kin and friends, including portraits of the late Lord and Lady Sunderland and of St Peter left to Lord Digby, and to charitable purposes. He left his library and &pound;500 to Magdalen, &#145;the beloved place of my Education&#146;; those books not absorbed into its library were to be sold towards its rebuilding fund  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/703, fol. 123<i>v</i>). The Lincoln's Inn flagon given to Magdalen is not mentioned so must have been given during his lifetime. Any of his unpublished writings were to be destroyed&#151;except for the accounts. He left money to the poor of Boddington (&#145;choosing not so much those that are most wanting, but chiefly those that are and have been most deserving&#146;) and of Lichfield  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/703, fol. 124<i>r</i>). He gave shirts and money to the men of St John's and money to the women of a sister hospital. To Daventry he left &pound;300 to found a charity school and &pound;200 to augment the living, and he left a further &pound;200 to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. On hearing of the death his old friend John Hough, now bishop of Worcester, wrote that, &#145;He was a learned man, a sincere Christian, unblameable in the whole course of his life, who lived inoffensively and died quietly&#146;  (Maynard, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 21).<br>
