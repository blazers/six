<span class="headword">Kersley,  George Durant</span>  (1906&#150;1993), <span class="occ">physician and rheumatologist</span>, was born on 27 December 1906 at 3 Park Lane, Bath, and baptized in Bath Abbey, the elder of two sons of Henry George Kersley (1863&#150;1927), of independent means, and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Durant (1871&#150;1958). He was educated at Malvern School and in 1925 went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. From 1928 he studied medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school, qualifying MB, BCh (Cambridge) and MRCP, LRCS (London) in 1931. In 1934 he won a prize for his Cambridge MD thesis. He was elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1943. He married on 1 February 1933 Mary Ada Roper Yeomans (1910&#150;1992), nurse, and daughter of Robert Roper Yeomans, schoolmaster. They had a daughter, Gillian, and a son, Henry Jonathan. This marriage having ended in divorce, on 8 May 1948 Kersley married Lilian May (Mickie) Davis (<i>b</i>. 1920), the daughter of Richard Mark Vernon, motor mechanic, and former wife of Major Kenneth Davis. They had one daughter, Diana Alison Durant, and Kersley became stepfather to Christopher, Mickie's son by her previous marriage.<br>
<br>In 1934 Kersley took up the appointments in Bath as consultant physician (general medicine) at the Royal United Hospital and consultant in rheumatology at the Mineral Water Hospital (later renamed the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases). This hospital and the city of Bath became two of the dominant passions of his life. On moving to Bath he joined the Territorial Army in the North Somerset yeomanry as captain. In 1939 he was called up as medical specialist with rank of major, later colonel. He set up the army school of occupational therapy at Taunton and reorganized the army school of physiotherapy at Netley. As adviser in physical medicine to the army he was concerned with training schedules and the rehabilitation of military casualties. After the war he gave up his general medicine commitment in order to concentrate on the rheumatic diseases, running specialist clinics in Bath and Bristol. This was at a time when there was an apparent conflict between science-based academic rheumatology and physical medicine, the latter having strong links with physiotherapy departments and less science-minded army specialists who had been concerned with getting recruits back to active service after injury. As a founder member of the Empire Rheumatism Council (later the Arthritis Research Campaign) and of the British Association for Physical Medicine, Kersley had a foot in both camps. Throughout his life he worked to resolve the apparent antithesis.<br>
<br>The Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases had been badly damaged in the &#145;Baedeker&#146; air raids launched in response to the allied bombing of Dresden. Kersley raised money not only to fund repairs to the hospital but also to modernize the interior and add a new research floor. This was a critical time. When the patients were moved into temporary hutted accommodation elsewhere, Kersley found himself up against the regional medical board, the professor of medicine in Bristol, and five successive ministers of health, who all wanted to close the hospital and put the money to other uses. It was greatly to Kersley's credit that he fought off the predators and cynics, taking his case to the House of Lords. The repairs and upgrading were completed in 1965. Under Kersley's guidance, the annual reports of the hospital reflected the increasing volume and quality of research carried out and numbers of patients treated. Younger doctors came to Bath as trainees, many from abroad. Five of the country's professors of rheumatology at Kersley's death had part of their training in Bath. In 1983 he retired, but he continued to give full support to the hospital and the Bath Institute for Rheumatic Diseases, which took over its research and teaching functions and became part of the postgraduate medical school at Bath. In 1986 he saw the celebrations of the quarter-millennium of the hospital, the oldest specialist rheumatology hospital in the world.<br>
<br>Kersley lived and practised at 6 The Circus, Bath, leaving it temporarily to move nearer to the university. But his love for things Georgian took him back to 20 Royal Crescent, where he lived for the rest of his life. He became a city councillor in 1968 and mayor in 1979. He was active in local Conservative politics, a discerning collector of antique glass, and instigator and chairman of the Bath tattoo, which was held from 1954 to 1964 and for which he was appointed OBE. He wrote on the history of medicine in Bath. His practitioner's manual, <span class="italic">The Rheumatic Diseases</span> (1934), was four times updated; he also wrote <span class="italic">The three &#145;Rs&#146;: rheumatology, rehabilitation and research as viewed from Bath</span> (1981) and a number of research and historical papers. He made the first complete description of the disease <i>polymyalgia rheumatica</i>. His book <span class="italic">A Concise International History of Rheumatology and Rehabilitation</span> (1991, co-authored with John Glyn), was published by the Royal Society of Medicine, London. He was president of the Heberden Society (1961), vice-chairman of the International League against Rheumatism (1967), and president of the European League against Rheumatism (1969). He was also an honorary member of the American and most European rheumatological associations. In 1971 he was awarded an honorary DSc by the University of Bath. He also served as a deputy lieutenant of Somerset (later Avon), and as colonel (later honorary colonel) of the 19th Southern General Hospital (Territorial Army), which he helped to set up.<br>
<br>Kersley's sixty years of professional life saw signal changes in rheumatology. When his career began, rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease, and tuberculosis of bones and joints were rife. By the time he retired they had virtually disappeared, gout had become curable, and surgeons had devised ways to replace damaged joints. Research had switched to osteoporosis and back pain with promising results. The problems of preventing and curing rheumatoid arthritis and other auto-immune diseases of joints had not been solved, although with advances in treatment the outlook for sufferers had vastly improved. He died on 1 September 1993 at the Royal United Hospital, Bath. After cremation, his ashes were buried in the family grave at Bath Abbey cemetery on 29 April 1994. He was survived by his second wife, Mickie, his three children, and his stepson.<br>
