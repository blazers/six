<span class="headword">Walker,  James  Robertson-</span>  (1783&#150;1858), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 22 June 1783, the eldest son of James Robertson, deputy lieutenant of Ross-shire, and for many years collector of the customs at the port of Stornoway. His mother was Annabella, daughter of John Mackenzie of Ross. He probably served a few years in merchant ships; he entered the navy in April 1801 as able seaman on board the sloop <i>Inspector</i> at Leith, but was moved into the frigate <i>Princess Charlotte</i>, in which, as midshipman and master's mate, he served for two years on the Irish station. In May 1803 he joined the <i>Canopus</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral George Campbell off Toulon in 1804. From her in March 1805 he was moved to the <i>Victory</i>, in which he was present at Trafalgar. When she was paid off in January 1806, Robertson was sent, at the request of Captain Hardy, to the frigate <i>Thames</i>, in which he went to the West Indies; there in April 1807 he was moved to the <i>Northumberland</i>, flagship of Sir Alexander Inglis Cochrane, with whom in December he went to the <i>Belle Isle</i>. In April 1808 he was appointed acting lieutenant of the <i>Fawn</i>, in which, and afterwards in the sloop <i>Hazard</i>, he was repeatedly engaged in boat actions with the batteries round the coast of Guadeloupe. On 21 July 1809 his rank of lieutenant was confirmed. He continued in the <i>Hazard</i> until October 1812, and was repeatedly engaged with the enemy's batteries, either in the boats or in the ship herself. Several times he won the approval of the admiral, but it did not take the form of promotion; and in October 1812 he was appointed to the <i>Antelope</i>, flagship of Sir John Thomas Duckworth. In her in 1813 he was in the Baltic, and in November was moved to the <i>Vigo</i>, the flagship of Rear-Admiral Graham Moore. A few weeks later the <i>Vigo</i> was ordered to be paid off, and in February 1814 Robertson was sent out to North America for service on the lakes.<br>
<br>In September Robertson joined the <i>Confiance</i> (37 guns), a ship newly launched on Lake Champlain, and being fitted out by Captain George Downie. The British army of 11,000 men, under the command of Sir George Prevost (1767&#150;1816), had advanced against Plattsburg on the Saranac, then held by an American force estimated at 2000 men, but supported by a strong and heavily armed flotilla. Prevost sent repeated messages urging Downie to co-operate with him in the capture of this place, and in language which, coming from an officer of Prevost's rank, admitted of no delay. The <i>Confiance</i> was not ready for service, her guns not fitted, her men made up of drafts of bad characters from the fleet, and only just got together when she weighed anchor on 11 September and, in company with three smaller vessels and ten gunboats, crossed over to Plattsburg Bay. The American squadron was of nearly double the force; but Downie, relying on the promised co-operation of Prevost, closed with the enemy and engaged. But Prevost did not move; the gunboats shamefully ran away; one of the small vessels struck on a reef; Downie was killed; and Robertson, left in command, was obliged to surrender after the <i>Confiance</i> had lost 41 killed and 83 wounded, out of 270, and was sinking. Sir James Lucas Yeo, the naval commander-in-chief, preferred charges of gross misconduct against Prevost, who, however, died before he could be brought to trial. At the peace Robertson returned to England, was tried for the loss of the <i>Confiance</i>, and honourably acquitted. The next day, 29 August 1815, he was promoted commander. He had no further service; on 28 July 1851 he was promoted captain on the retired list.<br>
<br>On 24 June 1824 he married Ann, only daughter and heir of William Walker of Gilgarran, near Whitehaven, Cumberland, and thereupon assumed the additional surname of Walker. He married, secondly, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1892), daughter of John Mackenzie of Ross. He died at Gilgarran on 26 October 1858, leaving a widow but no children.<br>
