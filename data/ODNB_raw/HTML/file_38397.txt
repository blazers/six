<span class="headword">Wheatley,  Henry Benjamin</span>  (1838&#150;1917), <span class="occ">bibliographer and editor</span>, was born on 2 May 1838 in London, posthumous son of Benjamin Wheatley, an auctioneer, and his wife, Madalina Rosa Hibernia Burdett, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Abercromby. Soon orphaned, he was educated within the family, mainly by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29181/', "Benjamin Robert Wheatley (1819&#150;1884)")</script>, a bibliographer, who instructed him in booklore and library management. Although Wheatley contributed to his brother's compilations, his first sole work was the <span class="italic">Catalogue of the Board of Trade Library</span> (1866). From 1861 to 1879 he was clerk to the Royal Society and <i>de facto</i> librarian of that institution, preparing its first catalogue of manuscripts. Privately he had also been preparing an index of anonymous literature, the notes for which he passed to Samuel Halkett. From 1881 to 1884 he edited <span class="italic">The Bibliographer</span>, and after the journal folded, a series entitled the <span class="roman">Book-Lover's Library</span>, which included several works of his own on bibliographical subjects. With his brother he was involved in the foundation of the Library Association (later CILIP, the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals) in 1877; he was a council member in its early years, and wrote several works for the association on library management. He also acted as inspector of the Cambridge University Library from 1877 to about 1882.<br>
<br>Wheatley had a strong interest in language and literature; with F. J. Furnivall he was one of the founders and the first secretary of the Early English Text Society. He served as treasurer from 1872 to 1916, and edited several texts for the society. He also read papers to the Philological Society in the 1860s, and published <span class="italic">Anagrams</span> (1862) and an edition of Levins's <span class="italic">Manipulus vocabularum</span> (1867). His lexicographical expertise led to <span class="italic">Chronological Notices of the Dictionaries of the English Language</span> (1867). Active in the New Shakespere Society and chairman of the council of the Shakespeare Association (1914&#150;16), Wheatley edited several sixteenth-century plays. In addition to these pursuits, he was a keen antiquary and topographer: his early topographical works included <span class="italic">Round about Piccadilly and Pall Mall</span> (1870). Elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1875, he contributed heavily between 1880 and 1886 to <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span> on subjects as various as the Adelphi, Dr Johnson, Cornwall, and precious stones.<br>
<br>In 1879 a career change took Wheatley to the Society of Arts, where he was assistant secretary until his retirement in 1908. He edited the society's <span class="italic">Journal</span> and carried out much administrative work with Sir Henry Trueman Wood. The society's policy of keeping fingers in many pies, such as the London blue plaque scheme, was very much suited to Wheatley's own <i>modus operandi</i>. From the Society of Arts he co-ordinated the Pepys memorial appeal, which culminated in the monument to Samuel Pepys in St Olave, Hart Street. Pepys was the subject of his private scholarship as well as his public work: in 1880 he published <span class="italic">Samuel Pepys and the World he Lived in</span>, which was later followed in 1893&#150;9 by the fullest edition of the diary before the Latham one. He was also founder and president of the Samuel Pepys Club from 1903 to 1916. Other literary figures to engage his interest included Johnson and Dryden: he was prior of the Johnson Club in 1906&#150;7, and his Dryden collection is now in the Beinecke Library, USA. Wheatley's broad knowledge of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century literature is reflected in the three chapters which he wrote for the <span class="italic">Cambridge History of English Literature</span> (1912&#150;13).<br>
<br>Wheatley continued to pursue his topographical interests, publishing (among many works on his native city) <span class="italic">London Past and Present</span> (3 vols., 1891). Although not a member of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society, he gave talks to it, and was president of the Hampstead Antiquarian and Historical Society (1906&#150;16) and of London Landmarks; he also founded (in 1880) one component of the London Topographical Society, and served as vice-president from 1900 to 1916. In addition he developed an interest in artistic matters: he served as secretary of the applied arts section of the Society of Arts, edited a series of <span class="roman">Handbooks of Practical Art</span>, and probably wrote the obituary of William Morris for the <span class="italic">Journal</span>. Several of his publications were on bookbindings, of which he assembled an excellent collection, sold at auction in 1918. Portraits, bookplates, and maps were a further source of interest: in 1879 he edited <span class="italic">The Particular Description of England, 1588</span>, by William Smith.<br>
<br>Wheatley's bibliographical interests did not flag: he was a member of the bibliographical club the Sette of Odd Volumes and served as its president in 1909, and he was also the president of the Bibliographical Society from 1911 to 1916. In 1877 he founded the Index Society, which was plagued by financial problems. In 1891 it amalgamated with the British Record Society's index library, an institution with rather different aims, and it was not until 1957 that an organization embodying Wheatley's ideals came into existence. Few book indexes can be conclusively attributed to Wheatley, but he certainly wrote <span class="italic">What is an Index?</span> (1878) and <span class="italic">How to Make an Index</span> (1902), the latter of which has not been superseded; the essay on indexes in the ninth edition of the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> (1881) was also by him.<br>
<br>Handsome, with abundant dark hair and a moustache, Wheatley was an urbane clubman, cheerful and gregarious in manner. He was the friend of London literati such as Richard Garnett, of historians such as G. L. Gomme, and of bibliographers such as Henry Bradshaw and T. J. Wise. On 4 July 1872 he married Louisa Louise (1846/7&#150;1899), daughter of Dr George Robins; they had two sons and three daughters. Having lived at 53 Berners Street in central London in his younger years, Wheatley later resided at several addresses in Hampstead. He died there, at his home, 96 King Henry's Road, on 30 April 1917, and was buried in Highgate cemetery on 4 May. His library was sold on 8&#150;12 April 1918 by Sotheby, Wilkinson, and Hodge.<br>
<br>Any assessment of Wheatley must take account of his prodigious output, much of it anonymous: it included at least twenty-eight works, ninety-seven articles, and twenty-two editions over five decades of work. Despite his great productivity, his writing was not dashed off and his research was usually thorough. His London topographical work and his connection with Pepys ensured his posthumous reputation, but other commemorations also celebrate his life and work. Wheatley was honoured in his lifetime by a DCL from Durham University in 1913, and later in the naming of the Wheatley manuscript, a Middle English religious poem held by the British Library and edited by the Early English Text Society. In 1962 the Library Association, in conjunction with the Society of Indexers, instituted its annual Wheatley medal for a high-quality index.<br>
