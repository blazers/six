<span class="headword">Heylyn,  John</span>  (1684/5&#150;1759), <span class="occ">theologian</span>, was baptized on 2 August 1685 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, the eldest son of John Heylyn (<i>d</i>. 1736), saddler, and Susanna Sherman, sister of Thomas Sherman of St Andrew's, Holborn. His father is said to have acquired a large fortune by army contracts. He was educated at Westminster School, where he became a king's scholar in 1700. He was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 7 June 1705 and was elected a scholar on 12 April 1706. He graduated BA and MA in 1709, and DD in 1728. Ordained priest, in London on 18 December 1709, he was vicar of Haslingfield, Cambridgeshire, between 1714 and 1719; Edward Rud records that Heylyn &#145;preach'd a very fine sermon&#146; at the archidiaconal visitation of Dr Bentley in December 1716  (<span class="italic">Diary &hellip; of Edward Rud</span>, 19). He became the first rector of the modern St Mary-le-Strand on 1 January 1724 and held that living until his death. On 2 July 1729 he was chosen lecturer of All Hallows, Lombard Street. Heylyn was a chaplain in ordinary to George II (1733&#150;48) and was also rector of Sunbury, Middlesex (1742&#150;7). He was collated to prebendal stalls at St Paul's on 11 October 1736, and at Westminster on 21 March 1743.<br>
<br>From his indulgence in mysticism Heylyn was known as the Mystic Doctor. His principal work was <span class="italic">Theological lectures at Westminster Abbey, with an interpretation of the four gospels, to which are added some select discourses upon the principal points of revealed religion</span> (1749). A second part of this work, entitled &#145;An interpretation of the New Testament&#146;, was prepared by Heylyn for the press but was not published until 1761, after his death. He also published six single sermons, one of which was delivered by him at the consecration in 1738 of his friend Joseph Butler, bishop of Bristol.<br>
<br>Heylyn married twice; his second wife, Elizabeth Ebbutt of St Margaret's, Westminster, died on 9 June 1747, aged forty-nine. He himself died on 11 August 1759, aged seventy-four, and was buried six days later in the south transept of Westminster Abbey, where there is a monument to his memory. He bequeathed &pound;1000 to the lying-in hospital in Brownlow Street. He was survived by a son, John, who was a merchant in Bristol.<br>
