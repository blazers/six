<span class="headword">Morris,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1701?, <em>d.</em> 1768), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born to Robert Morris of Bishop's Castle and Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire, whose family was said to be of north Welsh stock, and Mary, the daughter of Richard Tristram of More Hall, Worcestershire. He was probably the Robert, son of Robert and Mary Morris, baptized at the parish church, Clunbury, on 22 June 1701. Little is known of his early years before he moved to south Wales, but he was married on 9 September 1725 at St John's Church in Swansea to Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1786), the daughter and heir of David Jenkins of Machynlleth, Montgomeryshire, and his wife, Bridget Parry. Through her mother she was related to some of the leading families of Cardiganshire, and as a descendant of Owain Gwynedd she belonged to one of the so-called fifteen tribes of north Wales, a fact of which the family was suitably proud.<br>
<br>Robert Morris had been drawn to the Swansea area about 1724 by the copper-smelting works (known as the Landore works) that had been operated at Llangyfelach from 1717 by Dr John Lane of Bristol. Lane became bankrupt in November 1726 and Morris took over the works as receiver until he eventually secured sufficient capital from, among others, Richard Lockwood, Edward Gibbon (a relation of the historian), and Robert Corker, to buy the works in 1727. He himself became a partner in 1728, so forming the company of Lockwood, Morris &amp; Co. which would play a large part in the history of Swansea over the next century and more. Morris was the most active partner, and his success lay in his realization that whereas copper ore could be easily imported from Cornwall, it was the availability of a local, and therefore inexpensive, supply of good coal that was vital for the operation. This awareness soon gave rise to a dispute with Thomas Popkins of Fforest, a local mine owner who failed to keep to his part of the covenant in the original lease to supply coal. Morris was able to gain advantage over Popkins and other competitors by winning the support of Gabriel Powell, the duke of Beaufort's steward in Gower, in the competition for leases. He was soon mining his own coal, and by 1735 he was the biggest exporter out of the port of Swansea. His long and profitable direct involvement in the town of Swansea was evident by 1733, when he was granted a lease near the River Tawe to build a dock for coal ships, and over the following years his efforts at improving facilities at the port included bringing in better horses to haul coal and an attempt to improve postal facilities. In 1748 the works at Llangyfelach ceased to operate and were moved further up the valley to Fforest.<br>
<br>The tensions between Morris and his rivals did not cease after the early years of the enterprise, however, but led to a series of mineral property disputes through the 1730s, 1740s, and 1750s which saw the Popkins of Fforest and the Prices of Penlle'r-gaer line up against Morris and Powell and the party of the dukes of Beaufort. Like Henry Somerset, third duke, and Charles Noel Somerset, fourth duke, Robert Morris was a high tory, and possibly a nonjuror. In this he conformed with most of the entrepreneurs who had a share in the industrial boom which Swansea experienced in the years 1720&#150;70. His interests in the lead mines of Cardiganshire, an area in which his wife had family ties, also brought him into contact with like-minded families such as the Powells of Nanteos. This probably aided the process by which he became largely accepted into the gentry circles of Glamorgan, becoming a justice of the peace by the 1760s and acting as high sheriff of the county in 1763. The building of the mansion of Clasemont in Llangyfelach, with which the family's name was later linked, and the innovative workers' residences known as Morris Castle have been attributed to Robert Morris, but it seems likely that they were built by his son John Morris soon after his father's death. It was through this son that Robert's surname was given to the industrial suburb of Morriston on the outskirts of Swansea.<br>
<br>Robert himself probably lived at the house of Tredegar in Llangyfelach, and was the owner of other small estates in the Swansea valley as well as a town house in High Street, Swansea. He and his wife had twelve children who were baptized at St Mary's Church, Swansea, but six of them died in childhood. Of the survivors, four girls, Bridget (<i>b</i>. 1729), Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1731), Mary (<i>b</i>. 1736), and Jane (<i>b</i>. 1739) were followed by two boys, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61902/', "Robert Morris (1743&#150;1793)")</script>, and John (1745&#150;1819). Robert, best-known for his political radicalism, played only a small role in the development of his family's business, although it was he who, in 1774, compiled the manuscript &#145;A history of the copper concern&#146; that is such a vital source for the early years of the business. It was the younger brother John (knighted in 1806) who took care of the business after their father's death. Robert Morris died between January and April 1768 at his London home in Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square, and was buried at St John's Church, Swansea. After his death, his son John spoke affectionately of his father that &#145;His amiable manner, his Countenance, his deportment, Language and voice, in fact every word and every action announced the good man, as well as the accomplished Englishman of his day&#146;  (Ross, 40).<br>
<br>Robert Morris is remembered as one of the foremost industrial pioneers in south Wales. He has been characterized both as an unusually successful example of a native Welsh entrepreneur and as a typical example of how the large profits from Welsh mineral resources went into English hands. His importance in the development of Swansea and its hinterland is not open to doubt, however, and the industrial dynasty which he founded played a foremost role in the development of the town at a time when it was arguably the most important in Wales.<br>
