<span class="headword">Piercy <span class="st"> [Percy]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1744, <em>d.</em> 1819), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and evangelist in the United States of America</span>, was probably born at Sow, near Coventry, Warwickshire (not Bedworth, as often stated, much less Bedford, as given on a contemporary memorial at Charles Town, South Carolina), where he was baptized on 15 September 1744, the eldest son of William Pearcy, or Piercy, gentleman, and his wife, Ann. &#145;Piercy&#146; was then a long-established Warwickshire surname. Piercy, however, came to believe that he was descended from the Percys of Northumberland, and in later life changed his surname accordingly.<br>
<br>Piercy matriculated a commoner from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 10 July 1767. His choice of St Edmund Hall suggested that he was already aligned with evangelicals, towards whom the principal, George Dixon, was more sympathetic than most heads of houses. Nevertheless, when in 1768 six of the hall's evangelical undergraduates were sent down by Vice-Chancellor David Durell, as visitor, Piercy was able to remain in residence. Although he apparently did not take a degree, he continued to reside, to some extent intermittently, until 1771, and kept his name on the books as a senior non-resident until 1775.<br>
<br>Piercy was made deacon at Eccleshall parish church, Staffordshire, by Frederick Cornwallis, bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, newly elected archbishop of Canterbury, on 18 September 1768. His first parish was Bickenhill, near Birmingham, where the vicar, John Howlette, was apparently non-resident, but he also served as curate of West Bromwich, Staffordshire, of which the rector was Edward Stillingfleet, a well-known evangelical. In spite of a further set of ordination papers (April 1769) relating to Piercy's prospective ordination as priest, Bishop John Egerton's ordination register for 1769&#150;71 does not include his name. He was ordained priest on letters dimissory of 1 May 1769, by the bishop of Worcester, James Johnson, following subscription to the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> on 21 April 1769. It has been said that Piercy locally and openly criticized Stillingfleet. On the other hand it was under Piercy's influence at West Bromwich that Matthew Wilkes, subsequently a leading nonconformist, was called to be a minister. In the autumn of 1770, Piercy passed on to London, where he assisted Martin Madan at the Lock Hospital chapel. He also preached in London pulpits associated with George Whitefield, whose Bethesda orphanage, near Savannah, Georgia, was inherited by another evangelical leader, Selina Hastings, countess of Huntingdon, a friend of Madan, following Whitefield's death in September 1770.<h2>
<a name="FirstperiodinNorthAmerica17721780"></a>First period in North America, 1772&#150;1780</h2>On 15 September 1772 Piercy became one of Lady Huntingdon's domestic chaplains, acting as minister of her new chapel at Woolwich. She then appointed him president of Bethesda, with a view to reviving it as a school as well as an orphanage, with John Crosse, a senior contemporary of Piercy at St Edmund Hall, as chaplain. Two sermons delivered in London by Piercy before the embarkation of this Georgia expedition and published in 1772, are apparently the only surviving examples of his gift for preaching. In order to continue their training, seven young men from Lady Huntingdon's college at Trefeca, Brecknockshire, sailed for Savannah late in 1772, followed by Piercy, with his brother Richard, who was to be manager of the estates with which Bethesda was endowed. After an auspicious beginning in Georgia, discouragement set in, particularly as in March 1773 Bethesda was partly destroyed by fire. Some rebuilding began, but Piercy and the young men&#151;who are said to have found their leader autocratic and unsympathetic (although he found them happy)&#151;had also been charged to move around the Georgia outback to preach the gospel to the Native Americans, a project which occupied much of their time. After two years the Trefeca ordinands had apparently returned to England.<br>
<br>It was on an evangelistic expedition to the Augusta area that in August 1773, Piercy met an evangelical layman, Colonel Barnard Elliott of Charles Town, South Carolina. Together with two young men they took the Christian gospel to the Creek Indians, outraging local clergy by their disregard of Anglican formalities. With the same evangelistic zeal, Piercy preached not only in Charles Town (in nonconformist pulpits, as others were not then open to him), but also in Philadelphia and New York. Theologically he was a moderate Calvinist, in accord with the Anglican article seventeen, as appears from his association with the <span class="italic">New Spiritual Magazine</span>, which published in 1775 an engraving of his portrait by John Russell.<br>
<br>On 18 May 1776 Piercy married&#151;at St Philip's, Charles Town&#151;Catherine (1748&#150;1818), sister of Colonel Elliott. They had six daughters and two sons. From 1777 to 1780 he officiated regularly at St Michael's, Charles Town, as one of three co-equal ministers. Piercy and his wife set up house in the remaining part of Bethesda, where their eldest child, a girl, was born, and where they lived and achieved what they could until civil unrest made their continued residence impossible. The Elliott family were decidedly opposed to the current forms of colonial rule. Moreover Piercy himself preached at Christ Church, Savannah (hitherto closed to him), at the opening of the Georgia Provincial Congress on 22 January 1776. Six months later he preached after the <span class="roman">Declaration of Independence</span> was first made public in Charles Town. When British forces captured Charles Town in 1780, Piercy found himself&#151;like other colonial clergy&#151;in a complicated situation, and he was banned from officiating by the British commanding officer. He was however allowed, on 5 October 1780, with his wife and two daughters, to board a transit vessel, <i>Mary and Charlotte</i>, to return to England. The ship foundered after a month at sea; but her passengers had already been taken on board <i>Hydra</i>, leading the convoy. Bad weather and lack of provisions compelled <i>Hydra</i> to put into Cork, on 4 December, where Catherine Piercy's poor health involved further delay.<h2>
<a name="England17801804"></a>England, 1780&#150;1804</h2>Piercy returned to an irate patron. Lady Huntingdon accused him of failing to keep in touch with her while he was at Bethesda and of failing to send accounts in connection with her Georgia property. Piercy had apparently given up a small but adequate private income to leave England, which Lady Huntingdon had agreed to make good. Nevertheless the countess became increasingly demanding, and distant. Piercy had in fact written fairly frequent letters to her from Bethesda, most of which survive, and he had kept accounts, though possibly less informative than expected by an absentee owner. Much of this material was already in Lady Huntingdon's hands. Her unlooked-for aversion to Piercy perhaps derived from the adverse attitude of other, more stolid supporters, who may not have appreciated the lively side of Piercy's character.<br>
<br>During 1781 the countess became satisfied by her former favourite's account of his American activities, and Piercy was ministering regularly at her Spa Fields Chapel, in Clerkenwell, next door to her London residence. He continued to do so into 1782, the year that Lady Huntingdon seceded from the established church. She asked Piercy to act as bishop for her ordinands and followers in general. On his refusal, she allegedly ceased to have personal dealings with him, but he was allowed to resume his ministry at her Woolwich chapel, although it was unlicensed. Here he ministered to an increasingly large congregation until 1796 when the rector of Woolwich, George Thomas, brought a case against him for officiating in an unlicensed chapel in his parish. Piercy preferred to hand over this chapel to his brother Joseph, already a nonconformist minister, and to seek a licensed pulpit elsewhere rather than leave the Church of England. Piercy then returned to the United States to claim again his arrears from the trustees of Bethesda. Once more he was unsuccessful.<br>
<br>From 1797 to 1799 Piercy ministered at the Westminster chapel in Princes Street, Westminster, where Henry Peckwell (a junior contemporary of his at St Edmund Hall) had preached from 1774 to 1787, still then popularly known as &#145;Dr Peckwell's&#146;. This was doubtless opportune, as by 1796 and 1798 his two sons, William (<i>b</i>. 1783) and Barnard (<i>b</i>. 1784), had been elected king's scholars at Westminster School. Greater proximity, in addition to more pews, may have influenced Piercy's move in 1799 to the larger Queen Square Chapel, Westminster, next to which he was able to buy a house, later 50 Queen Anne's Gate. William's alarming debts during his first year at Lincoln College, Oxford (1799&#150;1800), resulted in a speedy transfer to the Indian army. Barnard, however, also at Lincoln from 1801, reading law, became a distinguished London barrister, who subsequently took holy orders. Piercy still owned his Queen Square house when he made his will in 1818.<h2>
<a name="ReturntotheUnitedStates18041819"></a>Return to the United States, 1804&#150;1819</h2>In 1804 Percy (as he now called himself) returned once more to Charles Town (now renamed Charleston). In the following year he again sought belated compensation from the trustees of Bethesda. His claim (originally larger), was recognized in 1809, when he received &pound;500. Meanwhile, in 1805, Percy had been elected &#145;third minister&#146; of St Philip's and St Michael's, an arrangement which prevailed until 1809. Although his appointment at St Philip's had been made permanent, in 1809 the electors decided not to renew his appointment at St Michael's. This was due to prejudice against his evangelical teaching. In 1810 he was also passed over for the post of first minister at St Philip's. Nevertheless in 1805 he had been made one of the first honorary doctors (in his case of divinity) of the College of South Carolina.<br>
<br>It is perhaps surprising that in 1809 Percy should have been elected president of the standing committee of the diocese of South Carolina. Encouraged probably by this development, in 1810 Percy's friends began to work towards a new parish in Charleston, raising funds to build a church in the Radcliffeborough area of the city, where Percy Street still recalls his local associations. Meanwhile Percy's followers worshipped in a disused Huguenot chapel. His election as diocesan president had been preceded by publication of a substantial theological work, <span class="italic">The Clergyman's and People's Remembrancer</span>, followed by a second part in 1809. He also wrote <span class="italic">An Apology for the Episcopal Church</span>.<br>
<br>St Peter's Church&#151;a large building in colonial-classical style, with galleries, capable of holding 1250 people&#151;was not ready for consecration until 1816, when Percy was duly elected rector. At first communicants numbered about fifty; but before long there was a much larger congregation, including members of some of the leading families in Charleston. Percy continued to preach strongly evangelical sermons, which seem to have been the principal means of his influence. &#145;It is certain that he was the instrument of bringing many to Christ, &hellip; William Percy was one of the few Anglican evangelicals to preach and minister in these colonies for any length of time&#146;  (Williams, <span class="italic">Early Ministers at St Michael's</span>, 10).<br>
<br>In 1819, his wife having died in the previous year, Percy resigned and returned to England. A few days after his arrival in Seymour Street, London, a neighbouring building caught fire during the night. Without warm clothing, Percy went outside. He died shortly afterwards, on 13 July, and was interred on 20 July in a catacomb of the newly rebuilt parish church of St Marylebone. His two sons appear to have been childless, but his daughters left descendants. His legacy included St Peter's Church, which in 1963 became the episcopalian cathedral of the South Carolina diocese. In 1997 his remains were reinterred at Brookwood cemetery, Woking, Surrey.<br>
