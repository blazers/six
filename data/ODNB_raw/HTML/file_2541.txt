<span class="headword">Blackwell,  George</span>  (1547&#150;1612), <span class="occ">archpriest</span>, was born in Middlesex. According to Robert Charnock, his father was &#145;a pewterer by Newgate in London&#146;, perhaps the Thomas Blackwell (<i>d</i>. 1553) who was a warden of the Pewter Company in 1547&#150;8. On 27 May 1562 Blackwell was admitted scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, graduating BA in 1563. In 1565 he became probationer and in 1566 perpetual fellow of the college, and in 1567 he was instituted MA. In 1571 six fellows resigned or were ejected from Trinity due to their conservative religious views, among them Blackwell. He moved first to Gloucester Hall, then a refuge for Catholics, and in 1574 to the English College, Douai. It must have been about this time that he met Robert Bellarmine (then professor of theology in Louvain), who in 1607 mentioned having met Blackwell almost forty years before. In 1575 Blackwell was ordained and, on 20 October, graduated bachelor of sacred theology. On 2 November 1576 he left Douai to return to England as a missioner. Two months later it was reported in the English College that his erudition and piety were already having a favourable effect in England, but letters that reached Rheims on 1 December 1578 reported his capture. In 1602 Charnock wrote that &#145;About twenty years since &hellip; you were imprisoned in London; but your brother, being the bishop of London's register, procured your release&#146;. This would have been William Blackwell, perhaps the same who matriculated at Christ Church in 1554&#150;5 and graduated BCL in 1562.<br>
<br>The Council of Trent's condemnation in 1562 of attendance at Church of England services was not published until 1593, and in the meantime a number of Catholic opinions that allowed attendance in order to escape the rigour of the English laws were in circulation. In the winter of 1580&#150;81 Blackwell prepared the notes from which Robert Persons wrote <span class="italic">A Brief Discours Contayning Certayne Reasons why Catholiques Refuse to Goe to Church</span>, one of the most influential books persuading Catholics to recusancy. For seven or eight years Blackwell lodged in the house of a Mrs Meany in Westminster, in constant fear of capture. On one occasion, when he was concealed in a priest's hole, with guards posted in the house to starve him out, he was rescued by the intervention of the countess of Arundel and Surrey.<br>
<br>After the death of Cardinal Allen (1594) the English mission lacked authoritative leadership, and serious divisions arose between the Jesuits and those secular priests unfavourably disposed towards them. The tensions led to accusations of maladministration of funds against the Jesuit superior Henry Garnet, for whose propriety George Blackwell vouched. To put an end to such dissensions, the disciplinary and financial aspects of the Jesuit and secular missions were divided in 1598. Cardinal Cajetan, protector of the English nation, on 7 March 1598 issued letters appointing George Blackwell archpriest of the secular clergy of England and Scotland. Blackwell's instructions ordered him to work in close consultation with the Jesuit superiors. The English College in Rome was already under Jesuit direction, and in 1598 Thomas Worthington, known to be favourably disposed towards the society, became president of the English College in Douai. The institutions of the English secular clergy were thus controlled by Jesuits or by priests willing to work closely with them, and Blackwell's appointment became the focus of discontent. Feelings of personal slight also played a role: among the seculars there were a number of priests more prominent than him either for their birth or for their erudition, and who had experience in dealing with the questions of conscience arising in the spiritual direction of a substantial household, while Blackwell had long &#145;had charge onely of a widow gentlewoman&#146;  (Law, 1.90&#150;98).<br>
<br>A substantial minority of the secular priests signed a petition which was carried to Rome by William Bishop and Robert Charnock, appealing to the pope to overturn Cardinal Cajetan's arrangements and appoint a bishop. In March 1599 Blackwell suspended three priests for opposing his appointment. On 6 April Clement VIII issued a bull confirming Blackwell's appointment and powers, to which the appellants submitted. Blackwell then insisted that those who had publicly refused to recognize his authority were guilty of schism, and could not carry out their priestly duties until absolved. On 3 May 1600 the faculty of theology of the University of Paris delivered a judgment that the sin of schism had not been committed, but on 29 May Blackwell decreed that this judgment was prejudicial to the dignity of the Holy See and should not be published in England. A second appeal to Rome ensued, drawn up on 17 November. In the winter of 1600&#150;01 Blackwell suspended at least ten priests. On 17 August 1601 the pope issued a breve upholding Blackwell's appointment, criticizing his intransigence, and prohibiting all further controversy on the issue, but it was not promulgated in England until 26 January 1602. In the interval John Mush, Christopher Bagshaw, and Dr Bishop published works attacking Blackwell, and his friends wrote in his defence.<br>
<br>It was probably about this time that Blackwell requested general prayers for his own intention, which was later revealed to be the safe delivery of the Infanta Isabella, then rumoured to be with child. A report to Sir Robert Cecil dated 27 August 1601 gave a description of Blackwell's person and movements as:<blockquote>about 50 years of age, his head brownish, his beard more black, cut after the fashion of a spade, of stature indifferent, and somewhat thick, decently attired &hellip; Termly he is in London and at this instant as near to Framingham as he well may be (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 11.363&#150;5)</blockquote>while in October he was reported as being &#145;on the Borders&#146;. When in London he lived in the town house of Viscount Montague.<br>
<br>In September 1601 arrangements were made with the privy council that four imprisoned priests should be banished from the realm so that they could go to Rome to pursue the second appeal, the papal rejection of which was not yet known in England. Richard Bancroft was particularly eager for their success, arguing in letters to Cecil that &#145;all the Catholics almost that are in England&#146; accepted Blackwell's authority, and that &#145;To be subject to Blackwell is to be subject to Parsons, the vilest traitor that lives, and consequently to the King of Spain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 11.318, 12. 204). In response to this &#145;third&#146; appeal, Clement VIII on 5 October 1602 censured Blackwell's tactlessness and revoked the instruction that he act in consultation with the Jesuit superiors, instead ordering him to communicate no business to members of the society. This completed the institutional separation of the secular and Jesuit missions, and tempers very quickly cooled. In May 1603 Blackwell had a meeting with Mush and Colleton in which a spirit of reconciliation was evident. At James's accession Blackwell wrote a letter to the clergy commanding them &#145;to labour to give stay and restraint to all bad attempts&#146; against the new government, and in June, through the mediation of John Gage, he revealed the existence of the Bye plot to the authorities. In October he was dangerously ill, and the nuncio in Brussels wrote to the cardinal secretary of state about possible successors, but he soon recovered his health.<br>
<br>Throughout 1604 and 1605 Blackwell exercised his authority unimpeded by disputes. As soon as he became aware, on 7 November 1605, of the Gunpowder Plot he wrote a letter condemning the plot and ordering his priests to instruct all Catholics to behave themselves peaceably in civil matters; on the same day he wrote to Paul V requesting that the pope issue a letter to the same effect, which he did on 28 November. When a new oath of allegiance was formulated as part of the <span class="roman">Act for the Better Discovery and Repressing of Popish Recusants</span> (1606), Blackwell wrote and spoke to the clergy in favour of taking it, partly basing himself on the pope's call for civil obedience. He was, however, contradicted by Paul V, who condemned the oath. Bancroft, who drafted the oath with the advice of the former Jesuit Sir Christopher Perkins, had framed it in such words that divisions among Catholics were bound to arise. In particular, the requirement to &#145;abhor, detest and abjure as impious and heretical&#146; the position that the pope could depose the king and encourage his subjects to murder him, was a rejection of murder to which any Catholic could subscribe, but in phrases which might seem to give the king of England the authority to define heresy, and in such a way as to declare heretics several prominent Catholic theologians who maintained the papal deposing power (without the authority to order murder) as a probable opinion. The archpriest, and a number of other Catholic priests, persisted in defending the licitness of the oath despite the papal condemnation and the contrary opinion of many theologians.<br>
<br>On 24 June 1607 Blackwell, &#145;comming fromwarde the Charterhouse&#146;, where a Mr Leake rented rooms in which some of the archpriest's papers were stored, was apprehended by the pursuivant John Wragg. He was committed first to the Gatehouse in Westminster, then to the Clink in Southwark. Between 25 June and 4 July he was taken to Lambeth Palace seven times to be questioned on his opinion of the oath, and on 4 July he took the oath and wrote a letter to the English clergy exhorting them to do likewise. Cardinal Bellarmine on 18 September wrote a letter to Blackwell deploring his subscription to an oath &#145;so craftily composed, that no man can detest Treason against the King, and make profession of his Civill subjection, but he must be constrayned perfidiously to denie the Primacie of the Apostolike See&#146;  (James I, 39). Blackwell's reply to Bellarmine relied heavily on the distinctions between thesis (a general principle) and hypothesis (a particular application), and between <i>de fide, formaliter</i> (a formal issue of doctrine) and <i>de eo quod est fidei, materialiter</i> (a material issue arising in connection with doctrine), arguing in particular that the contested passage of the oath was not a rejection of the papal deposing power, but only of certain inferences which might be drawn from it, and of its application to England in current circumstances. He further maintained that he had &#145;not wavered &hellip; in the least point, which certainly and definitely may appertaine to the sublime Majestie, and supreme authoritie of the See Apostolicke &hellip; in defence of whose Supremacie in spirituall causes, he is readie to yeeld his life&#146; (<span class="italic">A Large Examination &hellip; of M. George Blakwell</span>, sig. e2<i>v</i>; p. 33).<br>
<br>The position of an Oxford logician was not the clear statement of adherence or rejection that the government and the papacy required. Paul V repeated his condemnation of the oath on 22 September 1607 and, despairing of Blackwell's retraction, on 1 February 1608 deposed him as archpriest and appointed George Birkhead in his stead. The terms in which Blackwell defended the oath appeared to the civil authorities so qualified that he was interrogated on the matter throughout February 1608, and was kept imprisoned until his death in the Clink on 25 January 1612  (Questier, 136). He maintained to the end that his understanding of the oath of allegiance accorded both with the meaning of the words enacted by parliament and with Catholic doctrine. His conduct towards the appellant clergy and over the oath led the Jesuit historian John Hungerford Pollen to characterize him, perhaps harshly, as &#145;A man who in easier circumstances might have borne the weight of ecclesiastical dignity creditably, but who was unequal to the strain of those arduous times&#146;  (Pollen, 99).<br>
