<span class="headword">Bunting,  John</span>  (1839&#150;1923), <span class="occ">sharebroker and cotton spinner</span>, was born on 28 December 1839 at Carrington Field, Stockport, the son of John Bunting (1806&#150;1853), a brick maker, and his wife, Kerenhappuch, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hill. He grew up in the new railway town of Crewe, attended a private school in the village of Bunbury, and began work at the age of eleven. After the sudden death of his father in 1853 he migrated to Oldham, his mother's former home. The staple trades of Oldham were cotton spinning and engineering, in which the town established its world leadership during the 1850s and 1860s. Bunting became a blacksmith and engineer, and acquired a large practical knowledge of machinery. He was twice married and had two sons and two daughters. He first married, on 10 February 1862, Mary (1839&#150;1865?), daughter of James Shaw, a cotton carder. After her death he married on 10 April 1871 Sarah (1844&#150;1928), a dressmaker, and the daughter of James Jackson, a cotton spinner.<br>
<br>During the joint-stock boom of 1873&#150;5 Bunting changed his trade from one of the oldest in the world to one of the newest. He became a sharebroker, and published his first advertisement for shares in 1875  (<span class="italic">Oldham Chronicle</span>, 14 Aug 1875, 4). He began his new career as one broker among many others in the town's new share market, but he succeeded in breaking out of the ruck, and became a mill owner in his own right. He began to compile a regular weekly survey of the share market, first for private circulation among his clients and then for public consumption in the local press, where it appeared for more than forty years (in the Saturday issues of the <span class="italic">Oldham Chronicle</span>, 13 December 1879&#150;31 July 1920). In 1877 he became a member of the Manchester Royal Exchange, &#145;the parliament house of the lords of cotton&#146;  (W. C. Taylor, <span class="italic">Notes of a Tour in the Manufacturing Districts of Lancashire</span>, 1842, 9), and in 1880 he was a founder member of the Lancashire Sharebrokers' Association, of which he later became vice-president. In 1882 he extended his operations from the passive dealing in shares to their active promotion by undertaking his first independent issue of stock on behalf of a new spinning company. He also extended prudent loans against mortgage to mills in financial straits. From 1884 he began a new career as a company promoter and company director, extending his interests outside Oldham to Rochdale in 1890 and to Middleton in 1898. By then he had become a director of eight companies. From 1904 he established his primacy as the leading mill magnate of Lancashire by paying higher than average dividends and by embarking upon the construction of new first-class mills&#151;the Bell Mill in 1904 and the Iris Mill in 1907. The latter was the first ring mill within his group and was built in the record time of four months, or one-third of the normal period, reputedly with a bricklayer working in every window-bottom of the multi-storeyed mill. In 1906 he decided to build Lancashire's largest mill, the Mammoth Mill (of 250,000 spindles, at a time when the newest mills averaged 100,000 spindles), at Hathershaw next to the Bell Mill, but he changed his mind about its location and instead built it (in 1907&#150;8) at Middleton, as the Times Mill no. 2, with 160,000 spindles (by comparison, Arkwright's first mill at Cromford in 1771 had housed only 1000 spindles). The Times Mill was the largest single-unit mill ever built, driven by engines generating 2750 hp, and the Times Mill Company became the industry's most financially successful firm.<br>
<br>From 1910 Bunting achieved new success as a &#145;company doctor&#146;, and undertook the rescue of enterprises in difficulty, especially contractors' companies floated by firms with a direct material interest in the building and equipping of new mills. He bought up such companies cheaply at auction and then restored them to financial health by the issue of preference shares, so extending the range of financial techniques available to the industry. From 1912 he increasingly favoured the technique of high-speed ring spinning over the traditional Lancashire mule. In 1915 he established the Neva Mills Ltd at Middleton and re-equipped them with 99,600 ring spindles, so transforming the company into one of the largest of ring spinners. Thus he completed the construction of one of the earliest groups of mills within the industry. Such groups followed the example set from 1881 by the pioneer James Heap (1828&#150;1892) of Rochdale and imitated by T. E. Gartside (1857&#150;1941) of Royton. They began the process of rationalizing the structure of the industry, paving the way for the formal amalgamation of individual firms into large multi-unit corporations. Bunting had become the biggest individual mill owner in Lancashire and controlled, through separate companies united by the person of the chairman, twenty of the finest and most profitable firms in the industry. In 1916 his companies mustered in the aggregate 1.8 million spindles, or 8 per cent of the spindleage of the Oldham, Middleton, and Rochdale districts, and employed an estimated 7000 hands: &#145;No man was better known in the Lancashire cotton trade and no man played a bigger part in it during the last forty years &hellip; Almost everything he touched changed to gold&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oldham Standard</span>, 24 Feb 1923).<br>
<br>The secret of Bunting's success was to maintain high productivity and to exploit to the full the potential advantages offered by the use of loan capital, upon which most Oldham limited companies relied. An active director and chairman, Bunting reinforced his technical and financial ability by energy, industry, pertinacity, and shrewdness. In a town created by working men, he was reputed to work harder than any other person. He kept capital costs low by using large-scale units of production, by buying existing mills (or &#145;turnover&#146; concerns), by re-equipping mills with the newest machinery, and by depreciating plant at the high annual rate of 6 per cent. By 1916 he employed more than double the proportion of ring spindleage than was customary in Oldham. He recruited good managers, employed the best operatives, paid the highest wages, and offered the best working conditions. He remained a stubborn opponent of employers' associations and a constant threat to their plans for united action. He always ran his mills full time so that he benefited by the competition of hands for employment and was rarely afflicted by strikes. He insisted that profits should be made only at the mill and avoided risky speculation in the raw cotton market. Above all, he became a master financier with a profound and permanent commitment to his client-investors, regarding himself simply as the steward or trustee of their capital. He sought to maximize the returns received by his shareholders while ensuring that loans retained a gilt-edged status, so that they might be serviced with a lower rate of interest than that paid by other companies. His fixed policy was never to accumulate large reserves for the benefit of posterity but always to pay out the maximum possible amount in dividends. Thus he won and maintained the confidence of both large capitalists and small loanholders. In particular he established close links with a clientele of wealthy investors, including a fellow Primitive Methodist, the jam manufacturer W. P. Hartley (1846&#150;1922) in Aintree, and Hartley's son-in-law, the Congregationalist J. S. Higham (1857&#150;1932), a cotton spinner and manufacturer in Accrington, who served with him as co-directors. From 1911 onwards Bunting perfected the financial management of his group; he no longer published balance sheets and used a very high ratio of loan to ordinary (or equity) capital in order to maximize the dividend paid on the ordinary shares. From 1912 his mills regularly paid out dividends which were almost double the Oldham average&#151;22 per cent compared to 12 per cent. One company, the Iris, paid an average annual dividend of 86 per cent for eight years (1912&#150;20). Another, the Bell, paid a dividend of 81 per cent for ten years (1910&#150;20). The secret of those enormous dividends lay in the small proportion of ordinary capital upon which they were paid. Thus before 1919 Bunting called up only 5 per cent of the ordinary capital of the Times and Neva, only 15 per cent of that of the Bell, and only 20 per cent of that of the Iris. The Bell's true rate of profit was 17.5 per cent, but it could pay dividends fivefold that proportion by the extensive use of loan capital earning only a low fixed interest  (<span class="italic">Oldham Chronicle</span>, 7 Aug 1920; 9 Oct 1920).<br>
<br>The post-war boom of 1919&#150;20 carried the Bunting group to the heights of its success and fame. Bunting invested &pound;150,000 in the &#145;victory loan&#146; of 1919 on behalf of his mills, but avoided participating in the contemporary mania for recapitalization. Indeed, he condemned mill sales and company reconstructions because such operations could do nothing to increase dividends. He did, however, declare generous bonuses, preserving the reputation of his mills as the most profitable within the industry. During the climactic year of 1920 an average dividend of 86 per cent was declared by fourteen of his mills. Some began to announce dividends of 100, 200, and 400 per cent, while the Times Mill declared one of 600 per cent and the Bell one of 666.66 per cent  (<span class="italic">Oldham Chronicle</span>, 7 Feb 1920, 14; 8 May 1920, 14; 7 Aug 1920, 14). Such dividends &#145;must make the mouths of the uninitiated water&#146;: inevitably they were misunderstood and provoked questions in the House of Commons  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 129, 1920, 13&#150;14; 138, 1921, 590). Such questions did not disconcert Bunting, whose group continued to declare spectacularly high dividends. His basic financial technique remained viable during his own lifetime and for three years thereafter, until 1926&#150;7, when the industry reached its climacteric and loan capital began to flow out of the coffers of the Oldham limited companies on a large scale.<br>
<br>A staunch Conservative and a devout Primitive Methodist, Bunting dedicated himself to the work of his church, holding that it &#145;existed to make character, not merely to gather money&#146;  (<span class="italic">Oldham Evening Chronicle</span>, 25 Nov 1909, 7). He remained a lifelong supporter of the cause of temperance. He led the most frugal of lives, and controlled a vast industrial empire from a small terraced house at 115 Union Street, Oldham. His career was most unusual, insofar as he was born outside the ranks of the cotton trade but nevertheless made a fortune within it. He died at his home at the age of eighty-three on 22 February 1923 after a fall in Manchester while running to catch a tramcar, and was buried at Chadderton cemetery, Oldham. He left an estate of &pound;658,190&#151;one of the largest fortunes ever left by an Oldham cotton magnate. On his death his widow, Sarah, became one of the richest women in Lancashire.<br>
