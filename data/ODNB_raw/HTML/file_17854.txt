<span class="headword">Malan,  Solomon Caesar <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>C&eacute;sar Jean Salomon]</span></span>  (1812&#150;1894), <span class="occ">orientalist and biblical scholar</span>, was born on 22 April 1812 in the rue Verdaine, Geneva, the eldest of the twelve children of C&eacute;sar Henri Abraham Malan (1787&#150;1864), a Reformed minister of Huguenot descent, and his wife, Salome Georgette Jeanne, daughter of Salomon Sch&ouml;nberger, a merchant established in Geneva. His early education was given by his father, under whom he not only gained a conversational knowledge of German, Spanish, Italian, and Latin, but also began English, Hebrew, Arabic, and Sanskrit. He was also instructed in natural science, drawing, and various handicrafts.<br>
<br>In 1830 Malan met an Englishwoman, Mary Marsh, only child of John Mortlock, who was visiting Geneva, and the two fell in love. Mortlock initially opposed the match, but eventually consented on condition that Malan passed through an English university. Malan came to Britain in 1831 as tutor to the family of the marquess of Tweeddale (which was when he changed his name to its later form), and in 1833 he matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. The marriage took place on 1 April 1834. In the same year he gained the Boden Sanskrit scholarship, and in 1837 he won the Pusey and Ellerton Hebrew scholarship, and second-class honours in <i>literae humaniores</i>, despite becoming blind in the left eye. After graduating, Malan accepted the post of senior classical professor at Bishop's College, Calcutta, which he reached in May 1838. He took Anglican deacon's orders in the same year. In 1839 he became secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and gained the friendship of the remarkable scholar Csoma K&ouml;r&ouml;si, from whom he learned Tibetan. Besides learning several Indian vernaculars, he also advanced in Chinese. Leaving India on account of failing health in January 1840, he travelled through the Sudan and Egypt to recuperate, until he learned that his wife, who had returned to England, had died of consumption on 5 April. He returned to England in September to make provision for their three sons, but then resumed his convalescent journeys via Scandinavia and Germany to the Middle East.<br>
<br>After returning to England late in 1842, Malan accepted the curacy of Alverstoke, near Gosport. In 1843 he proceeded MA and moved to Balliol College; he was also ordained priest, and on 24 October that year married his second wife, Caroline Selina, second daughter of Charles Milman Mount, a prebendary of Wells. They had three sons and two daughters; his wife survived him. After a year (1844&#150;5) as perpetual curate of Crowcombe, Somerset, Malan accepted the living of Broadwindsor, Dorset, in September 1845. On 4 November 1845 he was naturalized as a British subject by letters patent. While at Broadwindsor, he served as rural dean and diocesan inspector of schools (1846&#150;53). He held the prebend of Ruscombe-Southbury at Salisbury from 1870 to 1875. He was a frequent traveller, most notably to the Middle East again (1849&#150;50), where he visited the excavation of Nineveh, and to Georgia and the Caucasus (1872).<br>
<br>Malan was regarded as the greatest British orientalist of his day; he was conversant with about eighty languages and published over fifty books. His main concern, however, was not the languages as such but the support of Christianity, for which he was made a DD by Edinburgh University (1880). Most of his orientalist works are accounts of eastern churches or translations of their devotional literatures, notably <span class="italic">History of the Georgian Church</span> (1866), <span class="italic">The Life and Times of St Gregory the Illuminator</span> (1868), and <span class="italic">Original Documents of the Coptic Church</span> (5 vols., 1872&#150;5). Some deal with problems of the mission field, particularly <span class="italic">Who is God in China?</span> (1855), or with other topical controversies. In 1881 Malan joined in the attack made by John William Burgon on the Revised Version of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, contributing to his articles, and himself publishing a new version of <span class="roman">Matthew</span> 1&#150;4, with an appendix giving the Lord's prayer in seventy-one languages. His <i>magnum opus</i> was <span class="italic">Notes on the Proverbs</span> (3 vols., 1889&#150;93), illustrating the Biblical text with nearly 16,000 passages from some forty eastern languages.<br>
<br>Besides his academic work, and his pastoral duties, which he performed conscientiously, Malan managed to pursue many other interests. He was a keen natural historian, and his collection of birds' eggs, presented to Exeter Museum, was judged one of the finest in the country. He was admired for his skill at calligraphy and drawing, both of which are illustrated in the biography by his son. He drew the portrait of E. B. Pusey in <span class="roman">Tract 90</span> (1841), and the sketches of the excavation of Nineveh in 1850 which illustrate Sir Austen Henry Layard's <span class="italic">Nineveh and Babylon</span> (1853). His pictures of Palestine were exhibited at Burlington House in 1855 and the Crystal Palace in 1856. His other skills included bookbinding, carpentry, and repairing musical instruments.<br>
<br>Malan's health forced him to retire in May 1855. Before leaving Broadwindsor, he presented forty valuable Tibetan books and manuscripts, given him in India by Csoma K&ouml;r&ouml;si, to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. His main collection of 4017 volumes became the nucleus of the library of the Indian Institute, Oxford. He spent his retirement at Bournemouth, dying there at West Cliff Hall, Priory Road, on 25 November 1894; he was buried in Bournemouth cemetery.<br>
<br>Despite the remarkable range of his talents, Malan never attained real eminence in any one field. One reason may have been that his energies were too widely dispersed, but another was his strongly conservative temperament and distrust of many developments taken for granted by later generations, including the admission of women to university and transcription of oriental languages into the Roman alphabet. This is shown most clearly in his condemnation of the Revised Version, and of the new Greek text of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> published by Westcott and Hort (both 1881).<br>
