<span class="headword">Higgins,  Charles Longuet</span>  (1806&#150;1885), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was born at Turvey Abbey, Bedfordshire, on 30 November 1806. He was the eldest son of John Higgins (1768&#150;1846) of Turvey Abbey and Theresa (<i>d</i>. 1845), eldest daughter of Benjamin Longuet of Louth and Bath, a gentleman of Huguenot descent. The family had strong links with the evangelical movement, and the parish church at Turvey had evangelical links. He was taught at home and matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 14 November 1825.<br>
<br>At Cambridge Higgins was impressed by the piety of the Revd Charles Simeon, the evangelical revivalist, and developed a taste for natural history and music, though he was an undistinguished scholar. He graduated BA in 1830 and proceeded to an MA in 1834. Although he had hoped to become a clergyman he relinquished the idea in deference to his father's wishes, and was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn on 16 November 1830. He was not called to the bar, and from 1836 to 1838 studied medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Having qualified as a doctor, he carried on a general medical practice at Turvey.<br>
<br>When his father died in 1846, Higgins succeeded to the family property. The following year he built a village school, to which he added a museum in 1852. He also restored the church (1852&#150;4) and erected more than sixty comfortable cottages. On 26 June 1853 he married Helen Eliza, daughter of Thomas Burgon of the British Museum. They had no children. Although Higgins never formally renounced his evangelical background, his increasing interest in high-church Anglicanism can be felt in the hymn-book which he compiled for general use in the Church of England and his paper on hymnology, afterwards published, which he read to the church congress at Nottingham in 1871. He was a JP and deputy lieutenant of Bedfordshire, and he delivered lectures on natural history and other subjects. Higgins died at Turvey Abbey on 23 January 1885, survived by his wife.<br>
