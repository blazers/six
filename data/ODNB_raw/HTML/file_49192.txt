</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">L&uuml;ckes,  Eva Charlotte Ellis</span>  (1854&#150;1919), <span class="occ">nurse</span>, was born in Exeter, Devon, on 8 July 1854, the eldest of at least three daughters of Henry Richard L&uuml;ckes (1830/31&#150;1884), banker, of the National Provincial Bank, Exeter, and later a manager of the Gloucestershire Banking Company at Ross and Coleford, and his wife, Charlotte Mortimer, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ellis (1831/2&#150;1894). After schooling at Malvern and at Cheltenham Ladies' College she lived at home with her family at Riverdale, Newnham, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, where she assisted her mother with the management of the household. She also visited the sick in the parish, developing an early interest in nursing.<br>
<br>L&uuml;ckes began training as a nurse at the Middlesex Hospital, London, as a lady probationer in 1876, but poor health obliged her to leave after three months. She resumed nurse training at the Westminster Hospital, where the matron, Elizabeth Merryweather, had introduced a system of nursing that had proved successful when introduced (by Merryweather and her sister, Mary) at Liverpool Royal Infirmary. After she completed the Westminster training course in 1878 her first appointment was as night sister at the London Hospital. She then spent a short period as lady superintendent of the Manchester General Hospital for Sick Children, Pendlebury. According to her critics L&uuml;ckes's departure from Pendlebury resulted from her having clashed with the hospital's medical staff over her attempts to reform the standard of nurse training there and establish what was termed &#145;nursing despotism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nursing Record</span>, 9 March 1893). She returned to London, nursing at the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street.<h2>
<a name="MatronoftheLondonHospital"></a>Matron of the London Hospital</h2>On 27 July 1880 L&uuml;ckes was appointed matron of the London Hospital, which with 790 beds was the largest general hospital in England. Situated in Whitechapel in the East End of London, the hospital served a poor, ethnically diverse, and rapidly rising population. Aged only twenty-six, she was the youngest of the five candidates for the post, but she impressed the hospital's house committee by her clear vision of what she wanted to achieve.<br>
<br>The hospital had opened a nurse training school in 1873 and under her predecessor, Annie Swift, some improvements had been made. Committee members were eager to see nursing further improved, and having determined that the matron must herself be a trained nurse they forced the retirement of Swift, who was untrained. On taking up her position L&uuml;ckes informed the house committee that the nursing staff was inadequate both in number and in quality and began a campaign to improve nurses' living and working conditions. The committee agreed to increase the nursing staff to 150 and to engage ward maids, who relieved nurses of the burden of scrubbing tables and floors. Regular off-duty periods were introduced, together with recreation facilities, such as a nurses' library.<br>
<br>One of L&uuml;ckes's first recommendations was that lockers be installed in the children's wards so that each child could have a separate towel and flannel to reduce the risk of contagion. She also urged the improvement of the diet of nurses and took greater responsibility for their food. Accommodation was also inadequate: sisters still slept in rooms between the wards they managed, and night and day nurses often alternately used the same attic beds, while there was only one bath for the nursing staff. She persuaded the committee to build a new nurses' home, opened in 1887, with separate rooms for over 100 nurses and bathrooms on every floor.<h2>
<a name="Nursetraining"></a>Nurse training</h2>L&uuml;ckes was determined to recruit and train her own staff whenever possible. Such a course was likely to make her enemies. She also insisted on retraining those applicants for nursing posts at the London who had trained elsewhere. To facilitate recruitment the hospital's nursing committee had suggested a two-year nurse training programme, in place of the previous three years. She held to this arrangement; after 1900 probationer contracts stipulated that a further two years on the staff should be served before a training certificate was issued. When three-year hospital training courses became the norm in other hospitals this arrangement at the London was much criticized by L&uuml;ckes's opponents. Recruitment did not improve, and by 1884 she suggested recruiting &#145;paying probationers&#146;, not under contract, who would follow short training courses and would have to be offered better living conditions. These probationers paid the hospital for their training while working free of charge, thus providing valuable income for the charity as well as saving money on staff wages. Between 1884 and 1915 well over a thousand paying probationers worked at the hospital, several hundred of whom went on to become regular, non-paying probationers under contract.<br>
<br>L&uuml;ckes saw the importance of theoretical training and in 1881 she started giving lectures to the probationers, augmented by lectures by such members of the medical and surgical staff as Andrew Clark and Frederick Treves. The subjects taught included elementary physiology and anatomy and medical and surgical nursing. Examinations for probationers were introduced in 1882, prizes were awarded, and certificates of training presented by the hospital's president, the duke of Cambridge. By 1884 she had developed her lectures sufficiently to publish a collection of them entitled <span class="italic">Lectures on General Nursing</span>. Retitled <span class="italic">General Nursing</span> in 1898, the book went into many editions and was translated into French (1903) and German (1906). Acknowledging that it was not the first modern nursing textbook, she claimed in the preface to the first edition: &#145;my sole object has been to collect as much practical information as possible, and place it before those studying the matter as simply as I could&#146;. The book discouraged nurses from indulging in &#145;amateur doctoring&#146;, which recommended it to <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>, though the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> questioned whether the author's moral exhortations on matters of manner and conduct would be welcomed by all readers.<br>
<br>L&uuml;ckes also started giving two lectures each year to sisters. Her book <span class="italic">Hospital Sisters and their Duties</span> (1886) went into several editions up to 1912. One of the first books to be published on the subjects of nursing management and nursing education, it provided advice on the management of hospital wards, the ward manager's relationship with her nurse subordinates, patients, and visitors, and on probationer training. The emphasis was on the sisters' responsibility for the care of individual patients and their role as the public face of the nursing department. Some reviewers pointed to the book's utility as a guide for the heads of households while others noted&#151;as they had with her previous book&#151;the stress the author placed on strength of character. Surviving correspondence with her readers indicates that she enjoyed a wide and enthusiastic readership in many parts of the world.<h2>
<a name="Privatenursinginstitutionandpreliminarytrainingschool"></a>Private nursing institution and preliminary training school</h2>In 1886 L&uuml;ckes initiated a private nursing institution, attached to the London Hospital, to provide better-off patients with nursing in their own homes. It was one of the first such institutions attached to a teaching hospital. Initially it had a staff of forty nurses; by 1914 the private staff numbered 284, making this the largest such institution in Britain. As the reputation of the London's private staff grew, the demand for its nurses always exceeded supply: by 1914 the institution was refusing an average of sixty cases a week. In her early years as matron L&uuml;ckes took a personal role in the selection of private nurses to attend each case, and was eager to find women who could adapt to any kind of social situation to which they might be posted.<br>
<br>L&uuml;ckes's policy of allowing probationers in their second year of training to attend private cases was especially criticized by the <span class="italic">Nursing Record</span>, a radical nursing journal that supported the aims of the British Nurses' Association, of which the <span class="italic">Record</span>'s proprietor, Ethel Gordon Fenwick, was a founder. Although the nurses at the London Hospital had received a year of instruction on the wards, had attended lectures, and taken examinations, they were, it was claimed, still untrained as their certificate of training had not been awarded. Hospitals like St Bartholomew's, where Fenwick had been matron, were increasing their length of training to three years and some advocates of longer nurse training also promoted the institution of a state register of nurses. In response L&uuml;ckes circulated a paper, <span class="italic">What will trained nurses gain from joining the British Nurses' Association?</span> (1889), which prompted a series of vituperative editorials in the <span class="italic">Nursing Record</span>. In 1889 and 1890 there were also press allegations, citing the testimony of a former chaplain, Tristram Valentine, that the London Hospital overworked its nurses, which L&uuml;ckes refuted in her evidence over several days to a House of Lords select committee on metropolitan hospitals (1890). The select committee's report, issued in 1892, found the charges against her unsubstantiated or exaggerated. Persistent attacks on L&uuml;ckes's working record served to make her staff rally around her all the more and many of them remained fiercely loyal to her for the rest of her life, but she found the experience &#145;truly terrible&#146;  (transcript of letter to Florence Nightingale, 20 Dec 1890, L&uuml;ckes papers, Royal London Hospital archives, PP/LUC/1/24).<br>
<br>L&uuml;ckes described her methods in an article, &#145;Trained nursing at the London Hospital&#146;, in the <span class="italic">New Review</span> (October 1890). It attracted the attention of Florence Nightingale, who began a regular correspondence that lasted until at least 1898. To L&uuml;ckes nursing was an art, implying that one could be a born nurse, in the same way that one could be born with a gift for music or painting. It was important that the nurse acquire knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and pathology, but she must also be aware of the doctor's role in diagnosing and prescribing, and to confine herself to efficiently carrying out the doctor's orders. Her role was to observe, report on, and take care of the patient. Technical knowledge, while important, should not displace the humanitarian side of the work. In the preface to the second edition (1898) of <span class="italic">General Nursing</span> she wrote, &#145;There is a danger at the present day that the fact that nursing is an Art may be lost sight of, and work which affords some of the most beautiful qualities of which human nature is capable may thus be degraded into a mere &#147;Profession&#148;&#146;.<br>
<br>L&uuml;ckes became the first matron in England to open a preliminary training school, in an old house in Bow, given by Lord Tredegar, the school being renamed Tredegar House. The concept of a preliminary training school, where prospective probationer nurses could follow academic studies for a few weeks, in advance of going onto the hospital wards, had first been introduced at Glasgow Royal Infirmary in 1893. L&uuml;ckes, who was anxious to soften the ordeal of the first beginnings of hospital life, admitted the first twenty-five probationers to the preliminary training school in June 1895. Her scheme involved a seven-week intensive residential course as a pupil probationer prior to becoming a probationer. An early entrant to the preliminary training school (in 1896) had been Edith Cavell, who went to Belgium in 1907 to direct what became an international nurse training school. In June 1912 Queen Alexandra opened the new Tredegar House, a purpose-built preliminary training school on the site of the original house.<br>
<br>To coincide with the opening of the preliminary training school L&uuml;ckes designed a new nurse's uniform, in consultation with Frederick Treves, who had written on the dangers of the fashion for tight lacing and its effect on the internal organs. The new cotton uniform allowed comparative freedom of movement, constituted &#145;rational&#146; dress, could be laundered at high temperature, and had removable lower sleeves that allowed for bare arms when nursing on the ward (thereby helping to reduce infection). Trained staff henceforth wore a similar design to that worn by probationers, the only difference between ranks being dress colour and apron and cap design.<h2>
<a name="Thetwentiethcenturyexpansionandregistrationcontroversies"></a>The twentieth century: expansion and registration controversies</h2>In 1896 L&uuml;ckes acquired an important ally in Sydney Holland, later second Viscount Knutsford, whose energy and reforming zeal transformed the hospital over the next thirty-five years. Already chairman of the Poplar Hospital for Accidents, he sought her advice about taking up an important administrative post at a London teaching hospital, and she suggested that he seek the chairmanship of the London, to which he was elected. He perceived that the priority lay with raising the hospital's income and by the time of his death he had raised &pound;6 million to transform it into one of the best equipped of the time.<br>
<br>In 1899, during the South African War, L&uuml;ckes was asked by Alexandra, princess of Wales, to provide six sisters and nurses willing to go out to nurse some of the war casualties. These were sent and the next year a further twenty nurses volunteered. Ethel Hope Becher (1867&#150;1948) won the Royal Red Cross during the conflict and went on to help reorganize army nursing, together with another &#145;old Londoner&#146; who also went to South Africa, Maud McCarthy. At the turn of the century L&uuml;ckes also instituted regular &#145;at homes&#146; for past and present Londoner nurses. These were held on Tuesday evenings at her flat, between 7 and 9 p.m. New probationers would be constantly surprised that the matron knew particular details about their background, interests, and present duties. She achieved this through meticulous record keeping, as in a series of &#145;official ward books&#146; begun in 1901, in which she entered details reported to her by ward sisters about the progress, or otherwise, of probationers and patients. She created a remarkable series of records of her nurses and their work, often pithy and insightful, which were continued by her successors (two of whom she trained).<br>
<br>Following the passing of the <span class="roman">Midwives Act</span> in 1902 L&uuml;ckes opened (in 1905) a training school for midwives, having already instituted a training course in Swedish massage (a forerunner of physiotherapy) for nurses. Other nurses were involved in radiological and radio-therapeutic work in the hospital's new X-ray and Finsen light departments. Sickroom cookery was also taught, examinations set, and a diet kitchen&#151;under matron's control&#151;was opened at the hospital in 1901. In 1905, in recognition of her quarter-century of service as matron, the London Hospital named a large new nurses' home and training facility after her.<br>
<br>In April 1905 L&uuml;ckes gave evidence to the select committee on the registration of nurses. She was the only nurse whose evidence opposed registration, a position she shared with Sydney Holland, who was also a witness, and she was seen as aligning herself with the hospital administrators. Her position as an anti-registrationist was controversial at the time, and remains so. Her argument was that registration would sanction lower standards than those enforced at leading training schools like the London Hospital. Certification by the state would place undue weight upon theoretical technical knowledge, tested by written examination, at the expense of the range of abilities (and especially personal qualities) that nurses needed to possess, and that the training schools alone could identify. She feared that the excellence that the training at the London Hospital unquestionably represented would be reduced to the level of that provided in the schools of nursing attached to workhouse infirmaries, which had no operating theatres or casualty departments and offered minimal medical care. She followed Nightingale, who had warned that registration would &#145;stereotype mediocrity&#146;. Moreover, state registration would undermine the authority of the matron, who exercised control over the system of internal certification. On the other side of the argument Fenwick led those who regarded registration as the panacea that would raise the standard of nursing; and the select committee reported in favour of registration, but though several bills were introduced, none passed until December 1919, when a voluntary register came into being.<br>
<br>In 1915 the former Guy's Hospital matron Sarah Swift and the Conservative politician Arthur Stanley promoted the idea of a college of nursing, modelled on the royal colleges of the medical profession, to organize nurses and standardize training. They were concerned that the influx of Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) and other partially trained workers employed in nursing during the First World War would harm the interests of trained nurses. L&uuml;ckes acknowledged the desire of Stanley in particular to promote the welfare of nurses, but opposed the scheme he and Swift had circulated to hospital governors in December 1915. She wrote to Swift in January 1916 that wartime conditions made it an inopportune moment to open such controversial questions  (McGann, Crowther, and Dougall, 12). L&uuml;ckes believed that the VAD nurses' experiences would show them the wisdom of obtaining a proper training and that they would &#145;bring back a wholesome element into the nursing profession&#146; that would combat &#145;the growing spirit of trades unionism which is so unadapted to nurses and so much to be deplored&#146;  (L&uuml;ckes, &#145;Reasons&#146;). Despite L&uuml;ckes's opposition, the College of Nursing was founded in April 1916.<h2>
<a name="Deathandlegacy"></a>Death and legacy</h2>L&uuml;ckes was said to have lived for the London Hospital, maintaining a punishing routine of long days, starting at 7.30 a.m. and often going on until 11 or 12 at night. The war years were difficult for her, as her workload rose through her training of field ambulance men for the Royal Army Medical Corps. Hospital wards were occupied by wounded servicemen, and war service overseas deprived her of many of her best nurses. Her final years were interspersed with short breaks at Bexhill-on-Sea, Sussex, but even there she would have a shorthand writer or assistant to get through her daily pile of registration and correspondence. During her final years she suffered from arthritis, diabetes, and deteriorating eyesight. She was obliged to use a wheelchair, to spend long periods in bed, and to rely on dictation rather than conducting her correspondence in her own hand. She was nursed by the head of her private staff, Thyra Larsen, whom she named in her will as her residuary legatee.<br>
<br>L&uuml;ckes was awarded the Royal Red Cross and the CBE in 1917, and in 1913 became the first nurse after Florence Nightingale to be awarded the Lady of Grace Order of St John of Jerusalem. She died, in post, at the London Hospital, Whitechapel Road, London, on 16 February 1919. Her body was cremated at Golders Green crematorium and her ashes interred, behind a plaque made by Kathleen Bruce Scott, at St Philip's Church, Whitechapel (now a medical library and the museum of the hospital). The plaque carries the epitaph she chose herself, &#145;She loved much&#146;.<br>
<br>Already by 1892 L&uuml;ckes was regarded as an exemplar of nursing, and so described by her pupil Honnor Morten, who related how L&uuml;ckes had left a luxurious home to take up nursing in order to be useful in the world  (H. Morten, <span class="italic">How to Become a Nurse</span>, 1892, 147). Florence Nightingale described her as &#145;Matron of Matrons&#146;  (Nightingale to L&uuml;ckes, 22 Jan 1891, L&uuml;ckes papers, Royal London Hospital archives, PP/LUC/1/4), training women who instituted her methods of nursing and hospital management all over the world. Her &#145;Matron's annual letters&#146;, which she spent much of her leisure time compiling, list nurses occupying positions of responsibility on every continent. Her books were easy to understand, widely read, and influential. Many of the records she compiled are preserved in the Royal London Hospital archives and continue to provide valuable insights into nursing and medical history.<br>
<br>Ernest Morris, who as hospital house governor helped her achieve some of her personal aims, described her as &#145;true to her vision&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Hospital</span>, 22 Feb 1919). Her relentless critic Ethel Gordon Fenwick wrote of her &#145;foreign psychology&#146; not endearing her to her &#145;British subordinates&#146;  (<span class="italic">British Journal of Nursing</span>, 22 Feb 1919), a description calculated to stir up xenophobic feelings and to remind Fenwick's readers that L&uuml;ckes had ceased signing her surname with an umlaut during the First World War in an effort to make her name appear less Germanic. Nurse registration, which L&uuml;ckes had always opposed, was introduced soon after her death, and Fenwick's name was the first to appear on the state register, but it was not until the Second World War, by which time the <span class="roman">Poor Law</span> had been abolished in England and Wales, and the standard of nurse training in former workhouse infirmaries improved under local authority control, that state registration of nurses became compulsory.<br>
<br>Described as resembling Queen Victoria, both in stature and facial features, L&uuml;ckes is said to have shared the monarch's gift for remembering faces and people. In later years attired in black silk or satin dresses, lace cap, and (often elaborate) jewellery, her appearance was in marked contrast to her hygienically clad nurses. She devoted the greater part of her life to raising standards of the care of patients, not only at the London Hospital, but also nationally and internationally, through the influence of her writings and of those whom she trained.<br>
