<span class="headword">Banks, Sir  (William) Mitchell</span>  (1842&#150;1904), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 1 November 1842, the son of Peter Spalding Banks, solicitor, and his wife, Ann Williamson. He received his early education at the Edinburgh Academy and then entered Edinburgh University, where in 1864 he graduated MD with honours and won the gold medal for his thesis on the Wolffian bodies. At the university he acted as prosector to Professor John Goodsir and at the local infirmary he acted as dresser and as house surgeon to James Syme. After graduating he was demonstrator of anatomy for a short time to Professor Allen Thomson, at the University of Glasgow. Afterwards he went to Paraguay, where he acted as surgeon for the republican government.<br>
<br>In 1864 Banks settled at Liverpool, and in 1874 he married Elizabeth Rathbone, daughter of John Elliott, a merchant of Liverpool; they had two sons. He began his career at Liverpool by joining the staff of the school of medicine at the infirmary, where he was first first demonstrator and then lecturer on anatomy. This latter post he retained&#151;and he later became professor&#151;when the infirmary school was merged with University College, Liverpool. He resigned his chair in 1894, when he became emeritus professor of anatomy. In addition Banks was pathologist and curator of the museum, and he succeeded Reginald Harrison as assistant surgeon to the Royal Infirmary at Liverpool in 1875. He was full surgeon there from 1877 until November 1902, when he was appointed consulting surgeon.<br>
<br>Banks was admitted FRCS (England) on 9 December 1869 without having taken the membership examinations. He served as a member of the college council from 1890 to 1896, and he was also the first representative of Victoria University, Manchester, on the General Medical Council. In 1885 he was one of the founders of the Liverpool Biological Association and was elected its first president; in 1890 he was president of the Medical Institution. In 1892 he was made JP of Liverpool, and in 1899 he was knighted and awarded an honorary LLD from the University of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Banks deserves recognition both as a surgeon and as a great organizer. As a surgeon he was an early advocate of radical mastectomy in cases of breast cancer, and in the face of strenuous opposition he carried out extensive operations involving the removal of the axillary glands when most surgeons were content with the older practice of partial removal. He made this latter treatment the topic of his Lettsomian lectures at the Medical Society of London in 1900. As an organizer Banks was one of the team who built up the fortunes of the medical school at Liverpool. Having found it at a very low ebb he and his associates worked hard to raise its quality first to that of a top medical college and finally to that of a well-equipped medical faculty at a modern university. The plan involved the rebuilding of the infirmary, and Banks was a member of the medical deputation which visited many continental hospitals to study their design and equipment before the foundation stone of the Liverpool building was laid in 1887.<br>
<br>Banks died suddenly at the Karlsbad Hotel, Aachen, Germany, on 9 August 1904, while on his way home from Homburg, and was buried in the Smithdown Road cemetery, Liverpool. His wife survived him. The William Mitchell Banks lectureship at Liverpool University was founded and endowed by his fellow citizens in his memory in 1905.<br>
