<span class="headword">Ward,  Mary</span>  (1585&#150;1645), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic nun and founder of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary</span>, was born on 23 January 1585 at Mulwith Manor, near Ripon in Yorkshire. She was the eldest of the six children of Marmaduke Ward (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1552), gentleman and bailiff to Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland, and Ursula Wright (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1565), the widow of John Constable; both her parents belonged to close-knit families of minor east Yorkshire gentry. They and their relatives were Roman Catholics who persisted in their faith after the Elizabethan settlement, many of them experiencing a loss of wealth and periods of imprisonment as convicted recusants. From the age of five Mary Ward was cared for mostly in the households of relatives and, through close female relatives, gained practical knowledge of the vital part played by women in the preservation and practice of Catholicism in England. She was educated at home, learning Latin from an early age and later becoming proficient in the major European modern languages.<h2>
<a name="Becominganun"></a>Becoming a nun</h2>Between the ages of five and ten Mary Ward lived with her grandparents Robert and Ursula Wright on their estate, Ploughland, near Welwick in Holderness, returning to her parents when her grandfather died in 1594. But the following year Mulwith Manor was completely destroyed by fire and the rest of the family moved, in 1597, to the Percy estate at Alnwick in Northumberland. Mary Ward herself went first to live with her widowed relative Katherine Ardington at Harewell House near Ripon and then, from 1600 to 1606, with Sir Ralph and Lady Grace Bapthorpe of Osgodby and Babthorpe near York. In this highly religious household, with its Jesuit priest and daily regime of devotions and instruction, Mary Ward began to order her life around prayer and spiritual reading. According to her autobiographical notes, made largely in 1617 and 1627, she was about fifteen when she first expressed the hope of becoming a nun. Her family, however, wished her to marry and encouraged the three or four suitors who made offers of marriage. Contemporaries commented on her beauty and attractiveness of personality while the visual sources, in the form of contemporary and posthumous portraits along with the unusual fifty narrative paintings from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which comprise the painted life of Mary Ward, convey these same qualities.<br>
<br>By 1605 Mary Ward was sufficiently sure of her religious calling to refuse the hand of Edmund Neville, the Catholic claimant to the forfeited earldom of Westmorland, despite the views of her father and her confessor, Father Richard Holtby, that it was her duty to accept. In that same year her father was arrested as an alleged conspirator in the Gunpowder Plot. He was not charged and, according to Peters, was unlikely even to have known of the plans. But two of her uncles, Christopher and John Wright, and Thomas Percy, the husband of her aunt Martha Wright, were deeply involved and were killed in the courtyard of Holbeach House while resisting arrest. In May 1606, soon after this significant series of personal and political events, Mary Ward left England for St Omer in Flanders to seek admission to one of the enclosed contemplative orders.<br>
<br>Through her contacts, particularly with the Jesuits who had their English College in St Omer, Mary Ward was admitted as a novice external sister with the Walloon Poor Clares. Becoming convinced, however, that her call was to help found a Poor Clare convent for Englishwomen she left the Walloon community in April 1607 to undertake the necessary negotiations with the ecclesiastical and civil authorities. Although she was young and unknown her initiative succeeded and the new convent was established in Gravelines by the end of 1608 with an endowment from the governor and the transfer of professed English nuns from the St Omer Poor Clares. Attracting applicants immediately from England it grew rapidly and Mary Ward, who was one of the novices, recorded her total contentment there. However, according to these same autobiographical notes, in May 1609 she received the first of a series of visions that changed the course of her life and led her to play a significant part in a debate about the role of women religious in the Catholic church that continued beyond her lifetime.<h2>
<a name="Foundingtheinstitute"></a>Founding the institute</h2>These mystical illuminations, which she described as intellectual rather than visual or aural revelations, were central to Mary Ward's subsequent actions. From the first occasion in May 1609 she understood only that she was to leave the newly founded Poor Clares and undertake an unspecified work that would bring her opprobrium. She therefore left and returned to London, where she used her social networks to undertake domestic evangelization and religious instruction of former Catholics. While in London she experienced a second illumination (the gloria vision) in November, which made clear that her unspecified mission would be wholly good and for the glory of God. During this period she gathered a group of seven young women from similar backgrounds, several of them related to one another and to her, who were prepared to follow her leadership and to live together in St Omer. There, close to the Jesuit college, they set up a quasi-religious house in early 1610 and gave religious instruction and teaching, first to the adult English &eacute;migr&eacute;s living locally and then to their children and boarders sent from England. Known as the &#145;English Ladies&#146; this small community had ten members by 1611 and was supported by the Jesuits and Bishop Blaes of St Omer. In 1611 Mary Ward's third and crucial vision led her to understand that her community, which had a conventual style of life, a Jesuit confessor, and private vows but as yet no rule, habit, or perpetual vows, should &#145;take the same of the Society&#146;  (Peters, 114), adapted where necessary for women. Peters argues from documentary evidence that Mary Ward interpreted her vision to mean that the fledgeling institute should adopt the <span class="italic">Formula Instituti</span> of the Society of Jesus, a position confirmed and reinforced by the final illumination, known as the vision of the &#145;just soul&#146;, of November 1615  (Peters, 116). The vision also revealed that the Jesuits would never permit this, as indeed they could not, since Ignatius of Loyola had expressly forbidden the society to take on the work of directing orders of nuns. The constitution of Ward's institute became, therefore, the critical issue. Between the first vision of 1611 and the last in 1615 individual Jesuits (including her confessor, Father Roger Lee) and other ecclesiastical friends drew up rules for a teaching institute, Schola Beatae Mariae, which Mary Ward ultimately rejected as only approximating to a Jesuit way of life. Simultaneously her proposals and activities prompted controversy within the society and there began a hostile campaign against the institute involving Jesuits, secular clergy, and leading members of the English laity.<br>
<br>Mary Ward's attempts to realize her revelations through the establishment of a new canonical institute challenged the <i>status quo</i> in three ways: first, it required a recognition that women living under vows could undertake educational and other work, including missionary activity, outside the cloister; second, that an institute of women could be organized across diocesan and state boundaries and therefore needed to be accountable to Rome under the delegated authority of a female chief superior, rather than more locally under a bishop; and third, that in adopting the constitutions of the Society of Jesus women religious would be permitted to develop the same kind of liberty as Jesuits to determine, under obedience to the pope by their fourth vow, what ministries would best achieve the &#145;greater glory of God and, in any place further the propagation of our Holy Mother, the Catholic Church&#146;, even to the point of working individually rather than in community  (Byrne, 34). Hers was not the only initiative in this vein, but taken together these three proposals went beyond others and even beyond what the church would accept for women by the early twentieth century.<h2>
<a name="Expansion"></a>Expansion</h2>Not much is known about Mary Ward between 1609 to 1615, although what is certain is that she led the English Ladies in the development of two distinct ministries: missionary and catechetical work with adults, usually women, in England, and teaching girls in their own schools in St Omer. The first activity was necessarily clandestine, undertaken by a smaller number of highly trained women who worked individually and, like priests, were protected by Catholic families. The second was public, highly regarded by some clerics and involving at least thirty teachers by 1615. Valued though this was by her for its evangelical potential, because through it future wives and mothers would acquire the necessary education to sustain the faith of their households, Mary Ward nevertheless continued to attach considerable importance to the more hidden work in England as the institute expanded across Europe.<br>
<br>Between 1616 and 1628 the experience of Mary Ward's institute was characterized on the one hand by expansion, new foundations, and support from monarchs and churchmen and on the other by virulent hostility, poverty, and failure to achieve official approval. New houses and schools were opened across the continent: Li&egrave;ge (1616), Cologne and Trier (1620&#150;21), Rome (1622), Naples (1623), Perugia (1624), Munich (1627), Vienna (1627), and Pressburg (1628). Mary Ward travelled considerable distances throughout this time, raised financial resources, and organized the network of her senior and most trusted members to run the new houses. The schools flourished and received hundreds of pupils, impressing Maximilian I, duke of Bavaria, who became a major proponent of their educational work, and Pope Urban VIII, who admired Mary Ward as an individual. As important was her redrafting of the constitution and her attempt to gain papal approbation of the institute from Paul V, Gregory XV, and Urban VIII. She and several companions travelled thousands of miles on foot across Europe to present the document personally to Pope Gregory XV in Rome in 1621 and later to Pope Urban VIII. Mary Ward found the normal Vatican bureaucratic procedures and caution difficult to understand and, despite her optimism about approbation, she received none. Alongside letters of support for the institute the Roman authorities received highly critical documents and petitions from England and elsewhere calling the English Ladies &#145;Jesuitesses&#146;, &#145;galloping girls&#146;, &#145;chattering hussies&#146;  (Peters, 341), and accusing them of moral laxity, usurpation of priestly roles, and even heresy. The controversy became increasingly damaging to the institute. Action was taken by the Inquisition to warn and then to suppress houses of the institute from 1628 onwards, culminating in the promulgation of the papal bull <span class="italic">Pastoralis Romani pontificis</span> in January 1631. Described by one source as the &#145;harshest Bull ever to emanate from Rome&#146;, it suppressed the institute itself and denounced its members  (Littlehales, 213).<br>
<br>Mary Ward herself was imprisoned for nine weeks. Throughout these events she remained unswervingly loyal both to her own mission and to the church. In turn many members of the institute stayed loyal to her and she continued to be seen as an exceptional and holy woman by many she encountered personally. On her release she went directly to Rome for an audience with Pope Urban who cleared her of the charge of heresy and allowed her, in 1632, to establish a group of women and a school in Rome under protection of the Holy See. The pope himself paid her a pension and supplied medicines and wine. Former members, working as lay teachers, also reopened the school in Munich in 1635, under the protection of Maximilian of Bavaria.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandlegacy"></a>Final years and legacy</h2>These modest restorations of the institute's work were important for future developments, but her own life was now dominated by the ill health she had long experienced from a chronic gallstone condition. In 1637 she made her way slowly across Europe from Rome, visiting Paris and Li&egrave;ge before arriving in London in May 1639. There she remained until the civil war forced her to travel north home to Yorkshire in 1642. She died at Heworth Manor near York on 20 January 1645, attended by members of the institute, including two of her first companions, Mary Poyntz and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68089/', "Winefrid Wigmore")</script>, and she was buried in the parish church of St Thomas in the village of Osbaldwick just outside Heworth. Her simple gravestone reads &#145;To love the poore, persever in the same, live dy and rise with them was all the ayme of Mary Ward&#146;.<br>
<br>Mary Ward remained a controversial figure in the church long after her death. The institute survived and slowly expanded from the core that remained in Italy, England (York and Hammersmith), and Bavaria but the houses in different countries developed independently and did not sustain the unity across boundaries that had been integral to her vision. Moreover, the tradition of Mary Ward as founder became suppressed within them because the bull of 1631&#151;and a subsequent bull concerning women's religious institutes, <span class="italic">Quamvis justo</span>, issued by Benedict XIV in 1749, which repeated many of the earlier accusations&#151;had such force. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries much archival material on her life was destroyed or was, like the <span class="roman">Painted Life</span> series, hidden. Mary Ward's eventual rehabilitation was the work of individual nuns in the English houses, with support from a learned Jesuit writer, and formed part of a more general impulse among nineteenth-century Catholics in England to recover an English Catholic past and create a public identity with a history. As a result of their researches and efforts the different houses joined forces temporarily to petition for papal approbation, which was finally granted in 1877. Detailed research into Mary Ward's life, using archives across Europe, led to the publication of Catherine Chambers's two-volume life in 1882&#150;5. In the context of changing female roles Mary Ward became of interest and her ideas were no longer seen as dangerously radical. By 1909 Pope Pius X was ready to rehabilitate her as founder of the institute, now called Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, leading the way to the unification of all the branches in England, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Italy, and Canada in 1911. Interest in Mary Ward from a variety of quarters outside her own institute continued to develop during the twentieth century with Pope John Paul II choosing the first papal visit to Britain in 1982 to single her out as &#145;an extraordinary Yorkshire woman &hellip; a pioneer of the active unenclosed congregations for women&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Pope Teaches</span> (1982) pt5, 143).<br>
