<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Richmond, Sir  Bruce Lyttelton</span>  (1871&#150;1964), <span class="occ">journal editor</span>, was born at Stafford Terrace, Kensington, London, on 12 January 1871, the only child of Douglas Close Richmond, who became secretary of the Charity Commission and comptroller in the Exchequer and Audit Office (1900&#150;04) and his first wife, Margaret Cecilia, eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3732/', "Henry Austin Bruce, first Baron Aberdare")</script>. He went to Radcliffe's preparatory school in Fonthill, near East Grinstead, Sussex, and at the age of thirteen headed the scholarship roll at Winchester College, where he rose to become prefect of hall, a member of Lord's eleven, and winner of the prize for Greek prose. A scholar of New College, Oxford, he gained a first class in classical moderations in 1892. His second in Greats (1894) perhaps owed something to his having spent less effort on <i>literae humaniores</i> than on organizing chamber concerts and playing cricket for the university, though without achieving a blue. Called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1897, Richmond made a mark by devilling for the editor of a legal textbook which attracted the notice of George Earle Buckle, editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and led to Richmond's being engaged in 1899 as an assistant editor. In the autumn of 1902 he took over the editorship of the <span class="italic">Times Literary Supplement</span>, then only a few months old, from James Thursfield. Under his aegis in the next thirty-five years the <span class="italic">Lit. Sup.</span>&#151;he never became reconciled to its later sobriquet, the <span class="italic">TLS</span>&#151;achieved, in the words of George Gordon, a &#145;position of undisputed and ungrudged authority&#146;. His task was not made easier by the threat, under which he worked daily and loyally for some years, of the sudden, arbitrary extinction of the <span class="italic">Supplement</span> by Lord Northcliffe. In 1913 Richmond married Elena Elizabeth (1878&#150;1964), daughter of William Gair Rathbone, of the Liverpool merchant family, and his wife, Blanche Marie Luling of New York. They were childless.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Times</span>'s tradition of anonymity perfectly suited the confident but unassuming character of a man whose entry in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>, to the day of his death, did not so much as mention his editorship of the <span class="italic">Supplement</span>. Apart from an occasional &#145;letter to the editor&#146;, signed Templar, on some point of scholarship, he never himself wrote in the <span class="italic">Supplement</span> and he enjoined strict secrecy on his reviewers, as much in their interest as in its own. These reviewers included many men and women already distinguished as divines or dons, in the services, in politics, and in literature. But his particular flair was for discovering, and encouraging, new talent. He gave Virginia Woolf and T. S. Eliot their first opportunities for serious critical work. If they both confessed to having fretted in the strait-jacket of &#145;<span class="italic">The Times</span>'s style&#146;, Eliot was later to pay an impressive tribute to the mentor who had taught him &#145;the discipline of anonymity&#146;. The anonymous writer, Eliot recognized,<blockquote>must subdue himself to his editor&#151;but the editor must be a man to whom the writer can subdue himself and preserve his self-respect. &hellip; Good literary criticism requires good editors as well as good critics. And Bruce Richmond was a great editor. (<span class="italic">TLS</span>, 1961)</blockquote>In a period before the proliferation of academic literary journals the <span class="italic">Supplement</span> under Richmond also enjoyed pre-eminence as a forum for the discussion, in signed articles and letters, of problems of literary history and textual criticism. He was not averse from allowing unsolicited contributors to expose their weaknesses. John Dover Wilson wrote to another regular writer on Shakespearian topics: &#145;What I admire about the <span class="italic">Lit. Sup.</span> is its intense impartiality. People growl to me, Why does the <span class="italic">Lit. Sup.</span> print letters from that ass&#151;? But I think it is splendid of Richmond to do so, and <i>so</i> wise.&#146;<br>
<br>Richmond contributed to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> the notices of his editor, Buckle, and his friend John Fuller-Maitland, the music critic. His only separate publications were the brief anonymous guide to Bodiam Castle, in Sussex, and <span class="italic">The Pattern of Freedom</span> (1940), a prose and verse anthology inspired by the faith that a liberal spirit would outlast the war. Characteristically the anthology, which ranged from Homer, Ecclesiasticus, and Petronius to Henry James, Robert Bridges, and others of Richmond's <span class="italic">Supplement</span> contributor-friends, contained no editorial introduction or other overt justification of purpose.<br>
<br>In private life, besides authors, Richmond numbered among his friends many musicians, both professional and amateur. After literature, classical and modern, in both of which he was widely read, music was his chief abiding passion: he was a member of the executive committee of the Royal College of Music, as well as a vice-president of the Royal Literary Fund. He lived in simple elegance in South Kensington and also leased a small house outside Robertsbridge, in Sussex, where his male guests were inducted in all weathers, with a Henry Jamesian gesture of welcome, into the mystery of the earth closet some distance down the garden.<br>
<br>Richmond had a predilection, conservative almost to the point of prejudice, for Shakespearian acting as exemplified in Sir Henry Irving and Sir P. B. Ben Greet. Until after his ninetieth birthday he was still a familiar figure, with two sticks, and not always approving, at the theatre at Stratford upon Avon, where he seldom missed a new production of Shakespeare. He travelled little abroad until late in life, when his distaste for hotels was mitigated by the hospitality of friends, literary or diplomatic, in Italy, Greece, and Egypt.<br>
<br>Richmond received honorary doctorates of letters from the University of Leeds (1922) and from Oxford (1930). He was knighted in 1935, and on the last day of 1937 retired from <span class="italic">The Times</span> to live first in Netherhampton, in Wiltshire, and later at the Old Rectory, Islip, near Oxford, where he died on 1 October 1964. He was survived for only six days by his wife.<br>
