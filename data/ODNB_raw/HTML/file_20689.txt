<span class="headword">Oldham,  Nathaniel</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1728&#150;<em>c.</em>1747), <span class="occ">virtuoso</span>, was the son of a dissenting minister. Early in life he went to India, where he served in the army. He returned to England on inheriting a fortune estimated at &pound;100,000 from a near relation. From 1728 to 1735 he lived at Ealing House, Middlesex, the former residence of Sir James Montague (1666&#150;1723), baron of the exchequer. He also had a house at Witton, near Hounslow, Essex, and a third in Southampton Row, Bloomsbury, Middlesex. Oldham was a close friend of Sir Hans Sloane, Dr Richard Mead, and other celebrated collectors. He too began to collect natural and artificial curiosities, although apparently with little taste or discernment. Among his acquisitions was a &#145;choice collection of butterflies&#146;. He spent a great deal of time at Don Saltero's Coffee House at Chelsea in the company of Sloane and others, comparing shells, insects, and plants. Oldham, who collected paintings, was a good friend of the artist Joseph Highmore, from whom he commissioned a full-length portrait of himself, dressed in a green velvet hunting-coat. The painting, dating from about 1740 and untraced, was engraved by J. Faber. Highmore also painted for him a celebrated informal group portrait, <span class="italic">Mr Oldham and his Guests</span> (Tate collection), based upon a real-life incident when Oldham had returned home late for supper at his home in Ealing to find his friends already well wined and dined. He was also a devotee of horse-racing. His lavish spending, notably on his collections, eventually forced him to take refuge from his creditors within the sanctuary of the court of St James's. There he frequented the refreshment room on Duck Island, in St James's Park, attired in an eccentric costume and regaling friends with performances on a variety of musical instruments. Compelled to sell his collection, he put a sign over the door, &#145;Oldham's last shift&#146;. At the same time he was arrested by a creditor and sent to the king's bench prison, where he is supposed to have died. He was probably still alive when the <span class="italic">Entire collection of prints, books of prints and drawings of Nathaniel Oldham Esq., of Southampton Row, Bloomsbury</span> was sold at Cox's auction room on 25&#150;8 February 1747. Oldham was godfather to Nathaniel Smith, the printseller, whose son J. T. Smith was the author of <span class="italic">Nollekens and his Times</span> (1828) and keeper at the British Museum. Smith contributed an account of Oldham to James Caulfield's <span class="italic">Portraits, Memoirs, &amp;c., of Remarkable Persons</span> (2 vols., 1794&#150;5; 4 vols., 1819&#150;20).<br>
