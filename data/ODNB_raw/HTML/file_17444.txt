<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Macdonald, Sir  John Alexander</span>  (1815&#150;1891), <span class="occ">prime minister of Canada</span>, was born in Glasgow on 11 January 1815, one of the five children (and the only male to reach adulthood) of Hugh Macdonald (<i>d</i>. 1841), a merchant, and his wife, Helen Shaw.<h2>
<a name="Childhoodandfamilylife"></a>Childhood and family life</h2>Although the origins of both his parents were in the Scottish highlands and Macdonald always spoke with a slight Scottish accent, he spent little of his youth in his native land. When he was five his parents emigrated to Kingston, near the eastern edge of Upper Canada. His father, who had left Scotland because his business ventures had failed, eventually acquired a small milling business in Prince Edward county, but never achieved much financial success and for a few years before his death in 1841 was employed as a bank clerk. Macdonald attended local grammar schools, where he acquired the habit of reading widely, particularly British fiction and constitutional history, but his formal education came to an end when at the age of fifteen he was articled to George Mackenzie, a Kingston lawyer. Macdonald had a quick mind and a natural aptitude for the law, and when he was only seventeen he was placed in charge of a branch office in the nearby town of Napanee. In August 1835 he opened his own office in Kingston and on 6 February 1836 was called to the bar.<br>
<br>Macdonald came of age in exciting times. In December 1837 he served in the militia during the Upper Canadian uprising and took part in the attack on the rebels' headquarters in Montgomery's Tavern in York (later Toronto). Yet in 1838, when Upper Canada was threatened by raids from across the American border, he courageously, though unsuccessfully, acted as the defence counsel for the rebels involved in one of the raids.<br>
<br>During the 1840s Macdonald concentrated on building up his Kingston law firm, became a specialist in commercial law, and purchased real estate and mortgages in many parts of the province, sometimes acting as the agent for British speculators. He invested in banks and road and shipping companies, acquired directorships in a number of Canadian and at least two British companies, and in 1864 became president of the British-backed St Lawrence Warehouse, Dock, and Wharfage Company in Quebec. None the less, money&#151;or rather the lack of it&#151;was a recurring problem for the young Macdonald. He lived well, but he had no inherited wealth and his income was unstable. In 1842, apparently using substantial winnings from gambling, he went on a six months' holiday to Britain, during which he had a whirlwind courtship with a Scottish cousin, Isabella, the daughter of Alexander Clark of Dalnavert, Inverness-shire. They were married on 1 September 1843 and were a happy couple, but after 1845 Isabella became an invalid. Despite her illness she gave birth in August 1847, but John Alexander jun. died after thirteen months. In March 1850 Isabella gave birth to a second son. Hugh John survived, but Isabella was racked with pain, mitigated only by massive doses of opium, until her death in 1857. Hugh followed his father into law, becoming his partner, and into politics, serving as member of the Canadian House of Commons for Winnipeg in 1891, briefly as minister of the interior in 1896, and as premier of Manitoba for a year in 1900, but Macdonald spent little time with his son and their later relationship was frequently troubled. During the late 1850s, as Macdonald focused on his political career, he resided in the capital of the united province of Canada, which alternated between Toronto and Quebec City until permanently transferred in 1865 to Ottawa. Like many of his contemporaries, Macdonald was a heavy drinker. His wife's prolonged illness added to his financial difficulties and he seems frequently to have sought solace in the bottle. After her death his social life revolved increasingly around drinking bouts with his political cronies.<h2>
<a name="Politicsintheunitedprovince"></a>Politics in the united province</h2>Macdonald's first political office was as secretary of a district school board in 1834. He was active in a host of religious and ethnic organizations in Kingston, including the Orange lodge, the masons and the Celtic and St Andrew's societies, and he served as an alderman from 1843 to 1846. In 1841 Upper and Lower Canada were amalgamated into the united province of Canada and in October 1844 Macdonald was elected to the assembly from Kingston, which would return him to parliament in ten elections between 1844 and 1874. In 1844 he campaigned as a Conservative and a supporter of Governor-General Sir Charles Metcalfe, and in the legislature he opposed the introduction of responsible government, the abolition of primogeniture, and an extended franchise, and he defended state support for the established church and for denominational schools. But he also showed a willingness to compromise, and he gravitated into the camp of the moderate Conservatives, led by William Henry Draper. In 1846 he was made a queen's counsel and in May 1847 Draper brought him into the cabinet as receiver-general. Macdonald held the post for seven months and then served for three months as commissioner of crown lands until the Reformers came to power in March 1848.<br>
<br>The most controversial measure introduced by the Reform administration was the <span class="roman">Rebellion Losses Bill</span>, which became a test of responsible government. When Governor-General Lord Elgin signed the bill, his carriage was stoned and the parliament buildings in Montreal were burnt by Conservatives disgruntled by the bill and by the imperial parliament's decision to abolish the preferential tariff on Canadian timber and wheat. A number of Conservatives even signed a manifesto advocating annexation to the United States. Macdonald dissociated himself from the extremists by participating in the British North America League, which was committed to the imperial connection. Macdonald also sought to persuade the Conservatives to abandon some of their more unpopular policies, including their opposition to responsible government, and he applauded the decision of the Conservative leader, Sir Allan Napier MacNab, to enter into a new political alliance in 1854 with the French-Canadian Reformers, who formed the largest single bloc in the assembly. The English-Canadian Reformers saw responsible government not as an end in itself but as a step towards creating a more liberal society, a goal not shared by the increasingly conservative French-Canadian leadership. The new coalition, out of which emerged the Liberal Conservative Party, had a clear majority in the assembly, and in September 1854 Macdonald took office as attorney-general for Upper Canada, a position he held until 1862 and again from 1864 to 1867. In 1861&#150;2 and 1865&#150;7 he also served as minister of militia affairs.<br>
<br>As attorney-general Macdonald was responsible for steering through the legislature much of the government's contentious legislation, such as the bill abolishing the clergy reserves and the 1855 act which entrenched Catholic separate schools in Upper Canada. He also presided over the expansion of the provincial penitentiary system and was largely responsible for the creation of separate provincial institutions for juvenile offenders and the criminally insane. Macdonald's influence was not entirely positive, since he believed that prisons should be more concerned with punishment than rehabilitation. In fact, he was a competent but hardly an innovative or outstanding administrator. His real forte was in the nitty-gritty of politics. He was a master in the art of distributing patronage, a formidable public speaker both in the assembly and on the hustings, and a likeable and popular politician. Although the united province had been created as a legislative union, Upper Canada and Lower Canada retained their separate identities, and cabinets were effectively headed by two premiers, one drawn from each section. In 1856 Macdonald helped to push MacNab into retirement and assumed the leadership of the Conservatives in Upper Canada. He became joint premier of the united province of Canada with &Eacute;tienne-Paschal Tach&eacute;, who was himself replaced in 1857 by George-&Eacute;tienne Cartier. From 1857 until 1862, except for two days in 1858, Macdonald and Cartier remained joint premiers of the united province, and Macdonald again served as joint premier with Tach&eacute; briefly in 1864. Even the temporary loss of power in 1858 was an accident. Because the politicians were unable to agree on where to locate the capital, Cartier and Macdonald decided to refer the question to Queen Victoria, who chose Ottawa. When the decision was announced the government was forced to resign. Two days later Macdonald and Cartier were back in power when the Reformers proved unable to sustain the support of a majority in the assembly.<br>
<br>By the late 1850s the united province was increasingly divided along sectional and sectarian lines. The predominantly protestant and British Upper Canada was growing faster than the predominantly Catholic and French-Canadian Lower Canada. The Liberal&#150;Conservative alliance was based on an acceptance of equal representation of both Canadas within the united province and a protection of minority protestant rights in Lower Canada and minority Catholic rights in Upper Canada. But the evangelical protestants of Upper Canada, led by George Brown, were angry that they were prevented from abolishing state-supported Catholic separate schools by the votes of French-Canadian Catholics in Lower Canada. To end the supposed domination of the union by the French-Canadian minority, the Reformers of Upper Canada demanded that the principle of equal representation be replaced by representation on the basis of population. Partly to head off this threat, the Liberal&#150;Conservatives proposed the creation of a federal union of British North America when they came back into power in 1858, but neither the Colonial Office nor the maritime colonies showed any great enthusiasm for the measure. Nor did Macdonald. The Conservatives were the minority party in Upper Canada, and federation&#151;particularly a decentralized federation&#151;might permanently deprive them of power. Macdonald preferred the existing legislative union of the Canadas and opposed the introduction of representation by population.<h2>
<a name="Confederation"></a>Confederation</h2>Only when the demand for constitutional reform had become irresistible did Macdonald throw his weight behind confederation. His conversion was motivated by a careful evaluation of political realities, but he was also influenced by the American Civil War. As Anglo-American relations deteriorated, in May 1862 as minister of militia Macdonald introduced a bill increasing the size and costs of the militia. The bill was defeated and the Conservatives resigned, but the new government headed by John Sandfield Macdonald held power only precariously after the election of 1863. On 30 March 1864 the Conservatives returned to power, but on 14 June they too were defeated. A way out of this political crisis was suggested by a parliamentary committee chaired by George Brown, which recommended that the united province be replaced by a federal union, either of British North America or, if that proved impossible, of the two Canadas. Macdonald, a member of the committee, refused to sign the report, but on 30 June 1864 he reluctantly agreed to join in a coalition with Cartier and Brown. As Macdonald made clear to his Conservative followers, he joined the coalition not out of enthusiasm for constitutional change, but because he believed that he had no choice. Macdonald still preferred the <i>status quo</i>, but if change was inevitable he preferred confederation to the other options available. Like his contemporaries he was also frightened by the implications of the victory of the North in the American Civil War. As attorney-general in the coalition he established a small secret-service unit to gather information in the United States, and after August 1865, as minister of militia, he was responsible for making preparations to defend Canada against the Fenian raids in 1866.<br>
<br>Partly because of his political skill and partly because of his superior legal knowledge, Macdonald played a central role in the constitutional negotiations at the Charlottetown and Quebec conferences in 1864, and he chaired the meetings at the London conference in 1866&#150;7. Thomas D'Arcy McGee claimed that Macdonald was the author of fifty of the seventy-two <span class="roman">Quebec Resolutions</span> which formed the basis of the <span class="roman">British North America Act</span> of 1867 which created the dominion of Canada. This undoubtedly exaggerates Macdonald's personal influence, for he could impose his will upon neither his colleagues in the coalition nor the maritime delegates, and the <span class="roman">British North America Act</span> did not entirely embody his ideals. Macdonald would have preferred a legislative union similar to the union of England and Scotland, but he recognized that legislative union was unacceptable to the French Canadians and to many Canadians of British origin. He therefore sought to create a highly centralized federal union in which the provinces would be little more than municipal bodies. The division of powers between the federal government and the provinces reflected these intentions, as did the authority given to the federal government to appoint provincial lieutenant-governors and to disallow provincial legislation.<br>
<br>Whether these were desirable achievements is controversial. Macdonald was not trying to create a highly centralized modern state which could manage the economy and provide a wide variety of social services; he was a nineteenth-century Conservative, who believed in a very limited role for government. His commitment to centralism was derived from his intense Conservatism. Macdonald feared the movement towards democracy, and sought to contain it by creating large electoral units and a second chamber composed of members appointed by the federal government for life. Intensely anti-American, he was convinced that the American Civil War was a product of weaknesses in the American constitution which gave too much authority to the states and to the people, and he believed British parliamentary institutions were superior because they included barriers against uncontrolled democracy. Ironically the constitution which Macdonald played such a major part in designing never functioned as it was supposed to. As minister of justice from 1867 until 1873, Macdonald sought to impose his will on the provinces, frequently resorting to the use of the power of disallowance. He was minister of the interior (1878&#150;83), superintendent of Indian affairs (1878&#150;87), and minister of railways and canals (1889&#150;91), but he still kept a watchful eye on the provinces. His <i>b&ecirc;te noir</i> was Oliver Mowat, the premier of Ontario and his own former law student. Mowat challenged and eventually constrained Macdonald's partisan use of the power of disallowance, effectively turning it into a rarely used emergency power. Mowat also persuaded the judicial committee of the privy council to hand down a series of important decisions favouring provincial rights. Contrary to Macdonald's fears, decentralization did not lead to the collapse of the federal union.<h2>
<a name="Firstdominionprimeminister18671874"></a>First dominion prime minister, 1867&#150;1874</h2>Macdonald was more clearly successful in his political ambitions. He quickly established himself as the dominant partner in the &#145;Great Coalition&#146;, particularly after the resignation of George Brown in 1865, and he impressed the imperial authorities by his loyalty and constitutional knowledge. In 1865 he was awarded an honorary DCL by the University of Oxford, and on 1 July 1867 was appointed the first prime minister of Canada. He was created KCB, to the chagrin of colleagues given lesser honours. Macdonald was responsible for constructing the first federal cabinet and for turning the Liberal Conservative Party into the first national party and leading it to success in the first federal election in 1867.<br>
<br>In 1867 Macdonald's party swept to victory in the newly created provinces of Ontario and Quebec, but did less well in New Brunswick, and disastrously in Nova Scotia, where seventeen of the eighteen members elected were committed to repeal of the union. Macdonald sought to appease the leaders of the repeal movement, especially Joseph Howe, by offering better terms, and in 1869 Howe, having been rebuffed in London, agreed to the terms, and entered the cabinet. In 1869 the Macdonald government also made one of the largest land purchases in history when it bought out the Hudson's Bay Company's vast territorial claims in western Canada. The negotiations in London proceeded smoothly, but the government did little to prepare those already living in the west for the transition to Canadian rule. In particular the government ignored the existence of a substantial community of m&eacute;tis, the offspring of marriages between European fur traders and native women, settled along the Red River. The m&eacute;tis reacted by establishing a provisional government headed by Louis Riel, turned back the Canadian-appointed lieutenant-governor, took control of the Hudson's Bay Company fort, and arrested all those who supported the Canadian take-over, including a number of surveyors sent out by Ottawa. They even executed one of the surveyors, an Ontario Orangeman named Thomas Scott, for refusing to accept the authority of the provisional government. The m&eacute;tis wanted their land titles confirmed, and demanded that Manitoba should be given immediate provincial status with guarantees for the equality of the French and English languages and for Catholic separate schools. Although Macdonald felt the grant of provincial status was premature, he agreed to the m&eacute;tis' demands, which were embodied in the <span class="roman">Manitoba Act</span> of 1870. At the same time, faced with an angry outcry from Ontario against the execution of Scott, Macdonald dispatched a military force to Manitoba and refused to extend a full pardon to Louis Riel, who was forced into exile. The integration of the west into Canada enabled the federal government to open negotiations with British Columbia, which became Canada's sixth province in 1871, in return for the promise of a railway to the rest of Canada within a decade. In 1873 Macdonald also completed negotiations which culminated in Prince Edward Island's entry into Canada. Only Newfoundland proved unresponsive to Canada's siren call.<br>
<br>In 1871 Macdonald served as one of the five British commissioners sent to Washington to settle various Anglo-American disputes which had arisen out of the American Civil War. Eventually the negotiations resulted in the treaty of Washington, a treaty Macdonald signed with great reluctance, since it gave the Americans access to Canada's Atlantic fisheries and to the St Lawrence River. Macdonald had opposed these concessions unless Canada received adequate compensation, preferably in the form of a renewal of the reciprocity treaty which the Americans had abrogated in 1866, but he could not prevail, and in the end was forced to accept the treaty in the interests of Anglo-American harmony. This decision proved a considerable handicap in the election of 1872, when he was accused of betraying Canada's national interests. Although the Conservatives did win a majority, it began to disappear following the election, when it was revealed that Macdonald and several of his colleagues had accepted enormous campaign contributions from Sir Hugh Allan, the head of the syndicate to be given the contract for building the Canadian Pacific Railway to British Columbia. Although Macdonald denied that he had benefited personally from the contributions and that the railway contract had been awarded to Allan for his generosity, he could not convince his own followers, and he was forced to resign on 5 November 1873 because of defections. In the election of 1874 his party suffered a disastrous defeat because of the Canadian Pacific Railway scandal.<h2>
<a name="Theoppositionyears"></a>The opposition years</h2>Macdonald was partly the author of his own misfortune. In 1864 his legal partner had died and he had found himself deeply in debt. Overworked and worried, he had begun to drink even more heavily. In 1866 the Canadian delegates were forced to delay their departure to London until Macdonald recovered from a binge, and in London he was almost killed when (presumably drunk) he fell asleep in his hotel room with the candle burning. The trip was not entirely a personal disaster. While walking in Bond Street he ran into Susan Agnes Bernard (<i>d</i>. 1920), the sister of his private secretary. Born in Jamaica, the daughter of T. A. Bernard, an official in Jamaica, but brought up in Upper Canada, Agnes had moved to England in 1865. The two were married in Hanover Square on 16 February 1867. Two years later they had their only child, Margaret Mary Theodora. Mary was an invalid throughout her life and Macdonald was deeply attached to her. Agnes provided her husband with a secure and supportive home. Under her influence Macdonald, who was never a very devout Christian, abandoned the Presbyterian church and became a member of the Church of England.<br>
<br>In 1870 Macdonald fell seriously ill when passing a gallstone and almost died. During his illness it became apparent that he was virtually bankrupt, and his friends raised a fund, which eased his financial problems by providing him with $4000 per annum. None the less, he again began to drink heavily, so heavily that he had only a hazy memory of what he had really promised the railway contractor Allan. After his defeat in 1874 he went into an intense depression. He was forced to return to the practice of law. He had moved his legal firm to Toronto in 1871 and he moved his residence there in 1874. Increasingly he left the management of party affairs in the hands of Charles Tupper, who had not been tainted by the Pacific scandal. It was widely rumoured that Macdonald's retirement was imminent, but the rumours were premature. Macdonald's defeat coincided with hard times and, as the popularity of the Liberals waned, he gradually regained his confidence, brought his drinking under control, and re-established his authority as leader.<br>
<br>In 1876 Macdonald committed the Conservatives to a policy of raising tariffs to protect Canadian industries, mainly from competition from the United States, which had consistently declined all offers to renegotiate reciprocity. In 1878 the Conservatives swept back into power, promising a &#145;national policy&#146; of tariff protection. Ironically Macdonald was defeated in Kingston, but he was elected in two western seats and chose to sit for Victoria, British Columbia (even though he had never been there). In 1882 he became the member for Carleton, Ontario, but in 1887 and 1891 returned to representing Kingston.<h2>
<a name="Theoldchieftain"></a>The old chieftain</h2>In 1879 the Conservatives raised the Canadian tariff to new levels. There was a substantial growth in Canadian manufacturing after 1879, but during the 1880s the economy grew slowly, Canada held few of the immigrants it attracted and saw many of the native-born leave for the United States, and there was a growing demand for reciprocity with the United States. Equally controversial was the other national policy to which the Macdonald administration was committed&#151;the completion of a transcontinental railway. At first the government continued the policy of building the line themselves, but in 1880 Macdonald helped to negotiate a contract with the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (CPR), headed by George Stephen. The contract was a generous one, too generous in the minds of the opposition. Even so, the CPR returned in 1884 and 1885 to ask for large government loans to finish the project.<br>
<br>Macdonald was sympathetic to the CPR's requests, but he might not have been able to convince even his own followers to agree to the second loan had there not been another rebellion in the north-west. Once again the chief cause of the rebellion was the discontent of the m&eacute;tis, particularly the French-speaking m&eacute;tis who had settled along the South Saskatchewan River. In 1885 they invited Louis Riel to return from the United States and lead their protest movement. Although the federal government promised to examine the m&eacute;tis' grievances, Macdonald believed that the m&eacute;tis had been adequately compensated for their land claims after the first rebellion, and when the protest turned into a serious armed insurrection he responded not with efforts at conciliation but by sending west a substantial force of Canadian militia to suppress the rebellion. Since the force went west on the CPR, Macdonald was able to persuade the Canadian parliament to grant the additional loan requested by the company. In 1886 Macdonald made his first trip west, travelling to British Columbia on the recently completed line.<br>
<br>During 1885 the federal government also faced a series of scattered acts of native violence. In the case of the m&eacute;tis rebellion Macdonald's responsibility for the bloodshed was at least indirect, since he had handed over the ministry of the interior in 1883 to his old and increasingly inactive friend Sir David Macpherson. But Macdonald remained superintendent-general of Indian affairs. Although poorly advised by his subordinates, Macdonald ignored abundant evidence that the native peoples were facing starvation because of the disappearance of the buffalo. Macdonald's humanitarianism was always limited and he was completely unmoved by their appeals for assistance. He reacted with severity to the disorganized acts of violence that resulted from the native peoples' frustration, and all of those suspected of complicity received severe punishments. Macdonald was less vindictive towards the m&eacute;tis, but he did believe that Riel should be tried for treason. Riel's trial created enormous rancour between English Canada, which believed his actions merited the death penalty, and French Canada, which believed that there were sufficient mitigating circumstances, particularly Riel's mental instability, to merit a lesser sentence. Macdonald was at the centre of this controversy. His own lack of sympathy for Riel was clear, and he refused to yield to what he saw as political pressure from Quebec. Riel went to the gallows in 1885, but Macdonald was not forgiven by Quebec. He lost ground there in 1887 and after 1891 the Liberals dominated the province.<h2>
<a name="Macdonaldandtheempire"></a>Macdonald and the empire</h2>Quebec's alienation was probably inevitable. During the 1880s and 1890s imperial enthusiasm grew stronger in Canada. Macdonald believed imperial federation was impracticable and undesirable, but he was genuinely committed to preserving the imperial connection. He had grown up in a community composed of United Empire loyalists and British immigrants, and he sought to transfer as many British institutions as possible to his adopted homeland. Many of Macdonald's contemporaries retired to Britain (as did his wife, who, after his death, was raised to the peerage of the United Kingdom as Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe). Macdonald might also have returned to Britain, for he visited it whenever he could. He admired British politicians, particularly Benjamin Disraeli, to whom he bore a striking physical resemblance, and he eagerly sought imperial honours. In 1872 he was appointed to the British privy council and in 1884 was awarded a GCB. On the other hand he saw little to admire in the United States, which he rarely visited. In 1890 he even ordered that all official documents use British rather than American spellings. Confederation in 1867 he viewed not as the creation of a new nation but as a consolidation of several smaller colonies into a larger one. He would have called it the kingdom of Canada if he had not been overruled by the imperial authorities, who feared antagonizing the United States, but he assured Queen Victoria that Canada would remain under the British crown forever. Macdonald did not support Canadian participation in imperial wars in Africa and Asia, but he was not opposed to imperial expansion. In fact, he argued that in building the CPR and in opening up the vast territories in the west to British settlers, Canada was making an important contribution to the empire, and he showed little sympathy for those, like the m&eacute;tis and the native peoples, who stood in the way of expansion across the continent.<br>
<br>Macdonald's alliance with the French Canadians in the 1850s was born out of political necessity and was undoubtedly made easier by Cartier's own Anglophilia. After Cartier's death in 1873 none of Macdonald's French-Canadian colleagues possessed anything like Cartier's influence. Macdonald never learned to speak French. Although he was prepared to give French equal status in the federal parliament and courts and in Quebec, he only reluctantly consented to a bilingual Manitoba and he did nothing to assist the Acadian minority in New Brunswick in its struggles. During the discussions over allowing Quebec to acquire the territory in the north previously under Hudson's Bay Company jurisdiction, he expressed reservations about creating a barrier between the maritime provinces and Ontario. He refused to condone the activities of Dalton McCarthy's Equal Rights Association, and in 1890, when Manitoba stripped the Catholic minority of its state-funded separate schools, he promised to restore minority rights. But Macdonald was not enthusiastic about extending those rights where they had not existed before confederation, and he believed that Canada must be essentially a British nation and English the dominant language.<h2>
<a name="Macdonaldslasthurrahdeathandburial"></a>Macdonald's last hurrah, death, and burial</h2>By 1891 Macdonald's administration had lost much of its vitality and his health was rapidly deteriorating, but he was handed victory in the election of 1891 when the Liberals under Sir Wilfrid Laurier campaigned for unrestricted reciprocity with the United States. Appealing to Canadians to stand by &#145;the Old Man, the Old Flag, and the Old Policy&#146;, Macdonald used the loyalty cry to win a narrow victory at the polls. It was his last. Shortly after the election, on 6 June 1891, he died in Ottawa of heart failure. His body was transported in state by the CPR to Kingston, where he was buried beside his parents and first wife in Cataraqui cemetery. Seventeen months later a white marble bust was erected to his memory in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral, London, inscribed with the slogan he had used during the 1891 election: &#145;A British Subject I was born, a British Subject I will die&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Macdonaldinperspective"></a>Macdonald in perspective</h2>During his lifetime Macdonald aroused intense emotions. To his enemies (and they were many) &#145;Old Tomorrow&#146; was a procrastinator without principles who gained and held office by the unscrupulous use of power and patronage. This was not entirely an unfair portrait. Macdonald grew up in a political environment where there was no clear conception of conflict of interest. He used his political influence to promote legislation to advance his own financial interests and those of his friends. He had no objection to using liquor and money to help voters arrive at the right decision, and, while he preferred not to appoint incompetents to the civil service, he was not above doing so out of political necessity. In fact, there was very little that he was not prepared to do out of political necessity, as he showed during the Pacific scandal and in 1885 when he ruthlessly gerrymandered the electoral districts in Ontario. Many of the reforms for which he might claim paternity, such as removing the common-law restrictions on labour unions in 1872, were based purely on partisan considerations and not on lofty principles.<br>
<br>Macdonald's friends did not deny his weaknesses, but they defended him as a statesman who always kept in sight the greater good and who played a major part in the creation of Canada. Sir Joseph Pope, for many years Macdonald's private secretary, published the first important biographical defence of Macdonald as well as a selection from his voluminous private papers. The historian who did most to establish Macdonald's reputation was Donald Creighton, in an evocative two-volume biography in the 1950s, which portrayed Macdonald as a hero for the times, the man who defined the Canadian national identity by resisting the growth of provincial power and the imperial ambitions of the United States. While Creighton was perhaps the most influential historian in Canada in the 1950s and 1960s, his views were refined by a number of his students and admirers, including Donald Swainson and Peter B. Waite, both of whom published more popular biographies of Macdonald. Keith Johnson, who demonstrated the extent of Macdonald's personal ambition, did not deny his essential greatness, and he was co-author with Peter Waite of the sympathetic entry in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Canadian Biography</span> (1990). Even Macdonald's weaknesses&#151;his heavy drinking and his cynical approach to politics&#151;have come to be seen as positive virtues, signs of his basic humanity and willingness to compromise. Since he was the first prime minister of Canada and held the post for nearly two decades, it was probably inevitable that he became increasingly popular after his death. Yet his influence, while great, is easily exaggerated and was not entirely praiseworthy. Indeed, given his intense Conservatism, his cultural chauvinism, and his lifelong commitment to the promotion of British imperialism, he is in many ways a strange candidate to have become enshrined as the national hero of a country which has rejected so many of the ideals in which he believed.<br>
