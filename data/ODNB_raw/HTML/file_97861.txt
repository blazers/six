<span class="headword">Branford,  Victor Verasis</span>  (1863&#150;1930), <span class="occ">sociologist and businessman</span>, was born at 15 West Street, Oundle, Northamptonshire, on 25 September 1863, the eldest surviving son of William Catton Branford (1837&#150;1891), a veterinary surgeon, and Ann Kitchen (1826&#150;1871), the sister of his father's deceased first wife. His father spent two short periods as professor in the veterinary college in Edinburgh before working as colonial veterinary surgeon in the Cape of Good Hope. William Branford was a controversial man, but an eminent veterinarian who, after a chequered career, died bankrupt. His children learned early to be self-reliant&#151;their mother had died when Victor was eight years old&#151;and their late adolescence was marked by the repercussions of their father's disastrous financial ventures.<br>
<br>Victor Branford had four siblings who survived into adulthood: Mary, Lionel, John, and Benchara&#151;a brother died in infancy before Victor's birth. All were born in Oundle, but they were principally educated in Edinburgh. Victor Branford studied briefly at Oundle School and then at Daniel Stewart's College in Edinburgh. In 1881 he entered the arts faculty at Edinburgh University but transferred to natural science, coming under the influence of the polymath Patrick Geddes, then a university demonstrator. Branford graduated MA in 1886 and supported himself with some private coaching for the preliminary medical examinations, which also helped to pay off his father's debts. During the 1890s he worked as a journalist, most significantly on the <span class="italic">Dundee Advertiser</span> as successor to James Farquharson Stewart, whose widow he married in 1897. Matilda Elizabeth Stewart (1852&#150;1915), daughter of Isaac Smith, manager of Josiah Mason's pen works, was ten years Branford's senior, and had a daughter and two sons from her first marriage. The Branfords spent their early married life in Amersham, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Branford entered business through an accountancy partnership formed with a fellow student, John Ross. Much of their early work involved the chaotic financial affairs of Patrick Geddes, with whom they were associated in the Edinburgh summer schools, the university settlement, and the attempt to establish sociological research and teaching in the university system. The business and academic work soon shifted its focus from Edinburgh to London, where the Sociological Society was formed in 1903 as a vehicle for promoting the ideas of Geddes. Branford was a founder member of the society, and was its honorary secretary during its early years. The society published <span class="italic">Sociological Papers</span>, in three annual volumes, which were relaunched in 1908 as the <span class="italic">Sociological Review</span>. The Sociological Society brought the Geddes disciples together with social investigators, eugenicists, and social philosophers, and Branford actively sought out international connections for the society through correspondence with &Eacute;mile Durkheim, Marcel Mauss, Ferdinand T&ouml;nnies, and Albion Small. He was particularly active in promoting his sociological approach in the United States and in 1926 he was made an honorary member of the American Sociological Society.<br>
<br>Branford unsuccessfully applied for chairs in commerce and social science at Birmingham and Manchester universities, building his applications around papers aimed at constructing an intellectual basis for accountancy as an applied social science. His accountancy business, however, drew him away from London and from the affairs of the Sociological Society, and he spent a large amount of his time in Latin America and the United States. He nevertheless continued to undertake sociological work, often based on his observations made during business trips.<br>
<br>In 1905 Branford's work in promoting the finances of the development company at Scheveningen, The Hague, brought him into contact with a financial syndicate dealing in railway shares in Argentina and Paraguay. The intermediary in this railway business was the grain merchant, and later diplomat, Charles Mendl. By establishing his family business in Argentina Mendl had come into contact with Manuel Antonio Rodr&iacute;guez and Benito Villaneuva, who controlled the Argentine North Eastern Railway and were using it to acquire the Paraguay Central Railway. Branford was appointed as financial agent, liaising between the syndicate, the local railway management in Paraguay, and the debenture holders in London. Simultaneously Branford was drawn into the affairs of the London firm of Sperling and Co. in Mexico and Cuba. Sperlings had come under the control of the Canadian financier Mackay &#145;Mike&#146; Edgar (1876&#150;1934) and, working with the United Railways of Havana and a syndicate of Caribbean sugar estate owners headed by Roland Ray Conklin, Branford and Edgar reconstructed the finances and the London base of the Havana Telephone Company and, in 1915, sold it to Sosthenes Behn as the basis for International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT).<br>
<br>Between 1907 and 1914 Branford moved frequently between offices in London, Buenos Aires, and New York. In London he ran the affairs of the Paraguay Central Railway and the Havana Telephone Company from New Broad Street House. During 1911 Branford was drawn into the attempts of Percival Farquhar to build an extensive trans-American railway system. The Argentinian syndicate had been in negotiation with Farquhar for some time and control of the Paraguay Railway formally passed to him in 1912. The trade depression of 1913 and the drift towards war in Europe led to serious financial difficulties for Farquhar and the whole group collapsed towards the end of 1914. Branford, whose efforts in the reconstruction precipitated his physical breakdown in 1915&#150;16, suspected duplicity on the part of Rodr&iacute;guez, whose role in the affair has never properly come to light. Through the financial rescue Branford came into close contact with Bernhard Binder and Ralph Hamlyn, who had managed Farquhar's London office. Their work on the financial reconstruction led them to form the accounting partnership of Binder Hamlyn in 1918, and Branford joined as a founding partner.<br>
<br>Branford's marriage did not survive his frequent absences on business. In 1910, following four years' separation, Branford obtained a divorce in Goldfield, Nevada, citing his wife's persistent drunkenness. The veracity of this claim is uncertain&#151;drunkenness was frequently and rather conventionally cited as grounds for divorce in Nevada&#151;but Branford does seem to have remained on good terms with Elizabeth's daughter, Elsie, who married Sir William Allardyce.<br>
<br>By the time of his divorce Branford had already met <a name="cosubject_97275"></a><span class="headword">Sybella Catherine Nino Gurney</span>  (1870&#150;1926), <span class="occ">housing reformer</span>, to whom he was married in a private ceremony in Philadelphia in December 1910. She was born in Paris, the only daughter (there were four sons) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11760/', "Archer Thompson Gurney (1820&#150;1887)")</script>, chaplain to the British embassy and hymn writer, and his wife, Eliza Eleanor Hammet (<i>b</i>. 1833/4). After fleeing the siege of Paris the family settled in Oxford. Sybella studied at Royal Holloway College (1887&#150;92), from where, as an external candidate, she obtained a second class in the Oxford University classical moderations examination. At Oxford, where her widowed mother had settled, she worked under Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse and became involved in the co-operative movement through Charlotte Toynbee, widow of Arnold Toynbee. She was active in the Labour Co-Partnership Association and co-operative housing schemes, working closely with Henry Vivian on schemes in Oldham, Letchworth, Kettering, Leicester, and near her home in the New Forest. She had a particular interest in reviving community life in villages, and in promoting modern cottage building. Through this work she was involved with Henrietta Barnett in the planning of Hampstead Garden Suburb. Gurney Drive in the suburb was later named in her memory.<br>
<br>Between 1911 and 1913 the Branfords spent much of their time in the United States. Victor Branford had applied for naturalization in order to obtain his divorce, and when citizenship was granted in 1913 the Branfords seem to have considered remaining in the United States. The collapse of the Farquhar group required Branford to spend more time in London and he was formally readmitted to British citizenship in 1923. The couple lived initially in Hampstead Garden Suburb, where they adopted two boys who had been born to a woman married to an illegitimate relative of Sybella's who was unable to look after the children. In 1920 the family moved from Hampstead to Richmond, Surrey, taking a summer farmhouse at New Milton, Hampshire, where Victor Branford first met Lewis Mumford, who had come to Britain to work on the papers of Patrick Geddes. Their stay in Richmond was brief, and in 1921 they moved, for reasons of Victor's health, to Pinders, Clive Vale, Hastings.<br>
<br>The completion of Victor Branford's work on the Farquhar reconstruction allowed him to spend more time on his sociological work and he once again became more active in the Sociological Society and on the <span class="italic">Sociological Review</span>, which he edited from 1912 until his death. The journal had, as far as Branford was concerned, become too diverse in its content and he sought to focus it far more closely around the ideas of Geddes on regionalism and civic sociology. To this end the cities committee of the Sociological Society became an important vehicle for the discussion of these ideas and their political implications. The committee became a semi-independent organization within the society's headquarters at Le Play House in Pimlico.<br>
<br>Branford's sociological ideas were presented in summary form in his collection of lectures published in 1914 as <span class="italic">Interpretations and Forecasts</span>. Through the cities committee Branford set up in 1919 a series of books called <span class="roman">The Making of the Future</span>, in which he published, with Patrick Geddes, <span class="italic">The Coming Polity</span> and <span class="italic">Our Social Inheritance</span>. The series also included a volume on the idea of warfare by Geddes and Gilbert Slater and two books (by Herbert Fleure and Charles Fawcett) on human geography. In 1923&#150;4 Branford produced two related volumes, <span class="italic">Science and Sanctity: a Study in the Scientific Approach to Unity</span> and <span class="italic">Living Religions: a Plea for the Larger Modernism</span>, which he recast with his earlier works as parts of a comprehensive series, <span class="roman">Studies in Contemporary Civilization</span>.<br>
<br>The ideas set out in these works derived from the theoretical sociology of Auguste Comte and the empirical sociology of Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric le Play, as these had been combined in the mind and teaching of Patrick Geddes. These ideas concentrated on the relationship between temporal and spiritual power and the ways in which the institutions through which these forms of power are organized are themselves shaped by the natural environment within which particular forms of economic activity arise. Branford saw contemporary societies as marked by an undermining of spiritual power by financiers and an all-pervasive credit system, and he saw this disenchanted modern world drifting towards social conflict and social collapse.<br>
<br>Branford worked constantly in the shadow of Geddes, whom he regarded as his master and inspiration, though his later work began to show a greater degree of independence and he was the senior author in all that he wrote. His writing style and mode of presentation, however, were not designed to attract a wide readership, and his ideas appeared to many as both eccentric and na&iuml;ve. This is unfortunate, as the ideas behind the prose were powerful and important, deserving a wider discussion than they received at the time. His writing style undoubtedly contributed to the obscurity into which both Branford and his ideas rapidly fell after his death.<br>
<br>A similar fate befell the political project with which Branford identified himself. This project centred on co-operative principles as the basis of social solidarity. Victor and Sybella Branford shared an interest in co-operatives, Victor having been involved in the formation of the West Indies Co-operative Union in 1898. His aim had been to promote the building of credit facilities for sugar growers in the Caribbean, and he was a great admirer of the Irish Agricultural Organization Society of Sir Horace Plunkett. Patrick Geddes had inspired him in this through some theoretical papers on co-operation and the Ruskin ideal of small-scale crafts. Working together, the Branfords developed ideas about the mobilization of credit through co-operatives. These formed a central plank of their political strategy and were influential in the later development of the idea of social credit by Clifford Douglas. The political strategy, developing from 1914, was termed the &#145;third way&#146;&#151;Branford was the first to use this phrase in writing. Later renamed the &#145;third alternative&#146;, this was a self-conscious attempt to develop the political implications of the ideas on sociology and social reconstruction that Comte had derived from Henri Saint-Simon.<br>
<br>The third way, between capitalist and socialist collectivisms, was seen as a new departure in politics and echoed some of the concerns of guild socialists like George Douglas Howard Cole and &#145;distributists&#146; such as Hilaire Belloc. The common concern was for a pluralistic structure of politics within which small-scale economic activity could provide the basis for greater equality. The distinctive element added to this in the Branford political strategy was to see co-operatives as the basis of a pluralist political economy and to argue for a reconstruction of the system of capital mobilization in the form of national or social credit. Branford himself was not a political activist, but he was connected with youth movements and national discussion groups aimed at pursuing a new political agenda. These ideas were not firmly established within the mainstream of politics and it was only a shell of the corporatist principle that was eventually established, without any real influence from Branford's work, in systems of planning and co-ordination in the period after 1945.<br>
<br>Victor Branford died at 34 Wellington Square, Hastings, on 22 June 1930, having survived his wife by four years. Sybella Branford had died at Pinders, Clive Vale, Hastings, on 11 June 1926. Their complex and interlinked wills led to numerous problems. Their intention was to benefit the Sociological Society and to re-establish it as the Sybella Gurney Institute. The failure to realize the funds in full, because of the difficult financial situation in South America, meant that these instructions could not be wholly carried out. The executors had also been instructed to secure the publication of Victor Branford's unpublished papers and to republish his existing works as a single series. Lewis Mumford, appointed as literary trustee, felt that this task was unrealistic given the rambling and incomplete state of much of the unpublished work. Permission was sought from the court of chancery to release the executors from the requirements. The Sociological Society and Le Play House were eventually wound down and their archives transferred to Keele University.<br>
<br>Branford's siblings had diverse careers, though his brothers were all involved with him in the Sociological Society and its work. Lionel William Ernest Catton Somers-Cocks Branford (1866&#150;1947) and John Frederick Kytchen Branford (1869&#150;1946) both became Anglican clergymen and were, with Victor, founding members of the Sociological Society. The other brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97276/', "Benchara Bertrand Patrick Branford")</script>, mathematician and educationist, was also active in the Sociological Society and contributed to sociological debates <span class="italic">Janus and Vesta: a Study of the World Crisis and After</span> (1916) and the more eccentric <span class="italic">Eros and Psyche</span> (1919).<br>
<br>Victor Branford's sister Mary Anne Kitchen Branford (1860&#150;1907) became an actress and married the stage and film actor Joseph Frederick Powell, known professionally as Joynson Powell (he appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's <span class="italic">Murder</span> in 1930). Their son <a name="cosubject_97861"></a><span class="headword">Frederick Victor Rubens Branford</span>  (1892&#150;1941), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born at 10 Colville Road, Kensington, London, on 4 April 1892. Although his name was registered at birth as Powell, he never used that surname in later life. He was brought up at St Mary Bourne, near Andover, Hampshire, by his aunt Dorothy Branford until her separation from her husband, Lionel Branford, after which she and Frederick moved to Ardgay, Bonar Bridge, Ross-shire. He attended Crux Easton church school, Hampshire, Dumfries Academy, Tain Academy, and Edinburgh University, where he matriculated in 1910 and graduated MA in 1916. While serving as a captain in the Royal Naval Air Service during the First World War he was shot down over the Somme, and lived on a disability pension for the rest of his life. He was a war poet of repute, publishing under the name Frederick Victor Branford. His best-known poems are collected in <span class="italic">Titans and Gods</span> (1918), which contains the autobiographical &#145;To D. C. B&#146;, dedicated to his aunt, <span class="italic">Five Poems</span> (1922), and <span class="italic">The White Stallion</span> (1924). Hugh MacDiarmid was among the admirers of his work. He was married, first, to Martha Munro and, second, in 1937, to his cousin Margaret Ave Branford, playwright, daughter of John Branford. He died at Hillside, Monk Sherborne, Hampshire, on 12 December 1941.<br>
