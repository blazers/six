<span class="headword">Fenner,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1600&#150;<em>c.</em>1640), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer on theology</span>, matriculated from Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1612, graduating BA in 1616 and proceeding MA in 1619. He is listed as a fellow of the college from 1618 until 9 July 1622, when he was incorporated a member of Oxford University. After being ordained he is believed to have been chaplain to the earl of Warwick. In 1625 he was named as vicar of Harston, Cambridge, and the same year he was made vicar of Sedgley, Staffordshire. Prior to his arrival the parish was allegedly &#145;a very heathenish place&#146;, but by Fenner's &#145;holy life and faithful preaching &hellip; many persons were turned to righteousness&#146;  (Brook, 451). He was, however, forced to leave by 1627. In that year he proceeded BD and travelled about for some months preaching in various places. In 1629 he was presented to the living at Rochford, Essex, where he remained for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>While Fenner was most noted as a preacher and sought after as a casuist, after his death, which occurred about 1640 when he was about forty, he became known for his theological writings, many of which were published by Edmund Calamy, his successor at Rochford. Calamy wrote in his preface to Fenner's <span class="italic">Souls Looking-Glasse</span> (1643) that while generally there were a great &#145;many good books written, &hellip; there wanteth one book to make us put those good books into practice &hellip; this book &hellip; may have this happie effect&#146;  (sig. A2). Fenner's numerous writings enjoyed popularity for some time and two separate collected editions of his works appeared within two decades of his death. In perhaps his most famous treatise, <span class="italic">Christs Alarm to Drowsie Saints</span> (1650), Fenner uses <span class="roman">Revelation</span> 3:1 as the basis for an extended discussion of the nature, purposes, and effectiveness of the ministry. His other posthumous publications demonstrate his concern for a variety of themes including the fundamentals of a godly life, issues of conscience, eschatology, obedience, repentance, and the nature of belief and emotions.<br>
