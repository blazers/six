<span class="headword">Kent,  Frances</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1685), <span class="occ">midwife</span>, was probably born some time between 1615 and 1640. The details of her birth as well as her maiden name are unknown. Her husband was John Kent of Reading, a clothier and a Quaker, who survived her by two years. The Kents had at least four children. Their daughter Hannah died (unmarried) in 1676. Their daughters Sarah and Mary each married London merchants (John Harwood and Samuel Clay, respectively) that same year. Their son John and his wife Ann had five children between 1682 and 1690.<br>
<br>The exact date of Frances Kent's conversion to Quakerism is unknown. During the 1660s and 1670s she was an active participant in the Quakers' Reading and Warborough monthly meeting. Like other prominent Quakers, she attended local business meetings where she reviewed proposals of marriage by Quaker youth. She also signed Quaker marriage and birth certificates, including those of her own children and grandchildren. During these years, Frances Kent was also gaoled twice at Newgate (in 1663 and 1672) for attending Quaker conventicles.<br>
<br>Despite religious persecution by state officials, Frances Kent was highly sought after as a midwife by prominent non-Quaker families, including the Buckinghamshire and Leicestershire gentry. Only three years after her first imprisonment at Newgate, Edmund Verney, the eldest son of Sir Ralph Verney, invited Frances Kent to be his wife Mary's midwife at Middle Claydon, Buckinghamshire. According to contemporary accounts, Mary Verney was mentally ill. Her husband had engaged the services of local women healers and London gentlewomen to try to cure her. Verney was ambivalent about inviting a Quaker to be his wife's midwife, but the glowing references of local gentlewomen and female relatives convinced him to do so. As Verney commented in a letter to his father, Frances Kent was a midwife &#145;reputed by all the doctors of Oxford as the best in England&#146;  (Hess, <span class="italic">Community Case Studies</span>, 108). A female cousin (&#145;old lady Woodward&#146;) told Verney that &#145;she had never seen such a learned and adroit midwife, and that anyone would think themselves happy if they could have her, and that one gave her ordinarily &pound;20, &pound;10, and at the least &pound;5 for her pains&#146;. This cousin also reported to Verney that Frances Kent &#145;never meddled in speaking of her religion to her patients&#146;, that &#145;if she promised to come she is perfectly faithful to her word&#146;, and furthermore that &#145;if the Queen had continued pregnant she would have been her midwife&#146;  (ibid., 109). Frances Kent wrote to Verney to decline his offer (like many other Quakers she was fully literate), apologizing:<blockquote>friend I ame sor[ry], thee hath put thyself to soe much trobell and I not in a Condicion to serve thee for the Ladey davis had layen in in London &hellip; I canot in aney means disopoint her shee being in a weekley Condicion. (ibid., 110)</blockquote>Frances Kent promised that if Lady Davis delivered in time at London then she would &#145;macke all the hast&#146; she could to attend Mary Verney at Middle Claydon. Whether Frances Kent actually delivered the Verney baby is unknown  (ibid., 111).<br>
<br>In addition to being sought out by the royal family and the gentry of Restoration England, Frances Kent was also employed by prominent Quaker families who lived in Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, and London. Among them was the wife of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, as well as Sarah Meade, the daughter of Margaret (Fell) Fox and stepdaughter of George Fox, the founder of English Quakerism. Sarah Meade praised Frances Kent in a letter to her mother;<blockquote>Frances Kent stayed with me a week after I was laid. She is a fine woman; it was the Lord sent her to me. It was the Lord's mercy to me that I had her, who is a very skilfil and tender woman for that imployment. (ibid., 113)</blockquote>On 27 August 1685, the year after she delivered Sarah Meade's baby at London, Frances Kent died at Reading. She was buried by the Quakers on 1 September.<br>
