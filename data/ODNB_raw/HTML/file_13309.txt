<span class="headword">Hill,  Thomas</span>  (1760&#150;1840), <span class="occ">book-collector</span>, was born in Lancaster in May 1760 and went at an early age to London, where for many years he carried on an extensive business as a drysalter at Queenhithe. He patronized Robert Bloomfield (1766&#150;1823), whose <span class="italic">Farmer's Boy</span> he read in manuscript and recommended to a publisher. Hill was part proprietor of the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span>, and befriended Henry Kirke White when a contributor to that periodical. Robert Southey felt that Hill's was probably &#145;the best existing collection of English poetry&#146;  (Knight, 2.27).<br>
<br>Hill occupied a house in Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, London, and a cottage at Sydenham, Kent. There, in his celebrated &#145;Sydenham Sundays&#146;, he used to entertain &#145;literati, artists, wits and actors&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, 43), including John and Charles Kemble, Theodore Hook, Campbell, Edward Dubois, the Hunts, James and Horace Smith, and the comedian Charles Mathews. These hospitable parties are vividly recalled in a number of memoirs, including those of Mrs Mathews, who celebrates &#145;days of unmixed pleasure&#146;  (Mathews, 626).<br>
<br>A lifelike picture of Hill is rendered in Hook's novel <span class="italic">Gilbert Gurney</span>, where he figures as Hull. The scenes in which he appears were read over to him before publication. He was always thought to be the original of John Poole's comedy <span class="italic">Paul Pry</span>, immortalized at the Haymarket in 1825 by Liston, although Poole himself insisted that the character was never intended &#145;as the representative of any one individual&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, 31/1, 1831, 280). His familiar peculiarities are also represented in the person of Jack Hobbleday of Poole's <span class="italic">Little Pedlington</span>. Lockhart called him &#145;the most innocent and ignorant of all the bibliomaniacs&#146;. &#145;He had no literary tastes and acquirements; his manners were those of his business&#146;  (C. Redding, <span class="italic">Fifty Years' Recollections</span>, 1858, 2.212). But the &#145;jovial bachelor, plump and rosy as an abbot&#146;  (Hunt, 181), &#145;a fat florid, round little man like a retired elderly Cupid&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, 80/1, 45), with his famous &#145;Pooh! pooh! I happen to know&#146;, his ceaseless questionings in a harsh, guttural voice, his boastings, his insatiable curiosity, his extensive and distorted knowledge of all the gossip of the day, was spoken of by everyone as a very kind-hearted and hospitable man. Even at an advanced age he was unusually young-looking; hence the joke of Samuel Rogers, that he was one of the little Hills spoken of as skipping in the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, and the assertion of James Smith that the record of his birth had been destroyed in the fire of London.<br>
<br>About 1810, after losing heavily through an unsuccessful speculation in indigo, Hill retired to second-floor chambers at 2 James Street, Adelphi, London, where he lived until his death, varying his strict economy with occasional binges. Longmans gave between &pound;3000 and &pound;4000 for his books, which formed the basis for their <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Anglo-poetica</span> (1815). He caught a severe cold at Rouen in the autumn of 1840 and died in the Adelphi on 20 December in his eighty-first year, leaving to Edward Dubois most of his remaining fortune. His furniture and plate were sold by auction on 23 April 1841.<br>
