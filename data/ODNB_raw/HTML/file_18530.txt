<span class="headword">Mellish, Sir  George</span>  (1814&#150;1877), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 19 December 1814 at Tuddenham, Norfolk, the second son of Edward Mellish, rector of East Tuddenham (afterwards dean of Hereford), and his wife, Elizabeth Jane, daughter of a prior dean of Hereford, William Leigh of Rushall Hall, Staffordshire. His godfather was George Canning, who was his mother's first cousin. He was educated at Eton College, where he was in the middle division in 1829 and the sixth form in 1832, but did not distinguish himself either as a scholar or as an athlete, though he was a good sculler and took part in the school's debating society. In 1833 he entered as a commoner at University College, Oxford, but soon won an open scholarship on Sir Simon Bennet's foundation. He was a member of the undergraduate debating society, the Oxford Union, and took a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1836. He graduated BA on 26 January 1837, proceeding to an MA on 24 October 1839. He became an honorary fellow of University College in 1872, and received an honorary DCL degree on 17 June 1874.<br>
<br>On 6 November 1837 Mellish joined the Inner Temple where he read in the chambers of Spencer Walpole, John Unthank, and Crompton. For eight years he practised as a special pleader and on 9 June 1848 was called to the bar, joining the northern circuit. He rapidly built up a good commercial practice, became a queen's counsel in 1861, and left the lead of his circuit after a few years to concentrate on what had become a substantial leading practice in London.<br>
<br>Neither his mind nor his health suited Mellish for the strain of <i>nisi prius</i> work. His strength lay in arguments <i>in banco</i>, in chancery, and in the House of Lords. More than once he refused a High Court judgeship, but in 1870, on the death of Sir George Giffard, he was appointed a lord justice of appeal in chancery, was knighted, and sworn of the privy council. It was a bold move to appoint a mere common-law practitioner to such an important post in chancery, but it proved a success, and the court, which consisted of him and Lord Justice James, continued for some years to give judgments which were considered excellent, although Mellish was often criticized for interrupting the arguments of counsel. Mellish suffered from severe gout, and was often in severe pain in court and frequently unable to work. He died unmarried at his house, 33 Lowndes Square, London, on 15 June 1877.<br>
