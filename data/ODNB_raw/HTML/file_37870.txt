<span class="headword">Purney,  Thomas</span>  (1695&#150;1730?), <span class="occ">poet and prison chaplain</span>, was born on 1 August 1695. His parents have not been identified. Perhaps he was related to a family of Purneys in Buckinghamshire, but his poems hint that he spent his childhood in Kent. After two years at Merchant Taylors' School, London, he was admitted as a pensioner to Clare College, Cambridge, on 2 July 1711. He graduated BA in 1715&#150;16.<br>
<br>Purney's two volumes of <span class="italic">Pastorals</span> (November 1716 and February 1717) purport to be written &#145;after the simple manner of Theocritus&#146;, but their closer model is the anti-classical, faintly Spenserian eclogues of Ambrose Philips, featuring English rural scenery, folklore, and dialect. Purney's critical theory is developed in his prose <span class="italic">Full Enquiry into the True Nature of Pastoral</span> (1717), greatly indebted to the <span class="italic">Guardian</span> papers on pastoral by Thomas Tickell. A long anti-Jacobite mock-heroic poem, <span class="italic">The Chevalier de St. George</span> (published in October 1718), is attributed to Purney by Giles Jacob, who notes justly that it is written in an extraordinary style  (<span class="italic">Poetical Register</span>, 1723, 2.304). Outlandish diction is a feature of <span class="italic">The Last Day</span>, a long poem by a deceased college friend, John Bulkeley, which Purney prepared for the press in 1719. Purney advertised in 1717 a poem in fifteen books on Edward, the Black Prince, but it never appeared.<br>
<br>Purney was ordained priest (London diocese) on 24 May 1719 and in November of that year, as &#145;a young suckling divine of twenty-four years of age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orphan Reviv'd</span>), was appointed ordinary (full-time chaplain) of Newgate prison on the recommendation of the bishop of Peterborough. Purney's salary was &pound;35 p.a. but the great profit of his much sought-after post was in writing accounts of the behaviour, confessions, and dying words of hanged malefactors: his predecessor, Paul Lorrain (<i>d</i>. 1719), is said to have left &pound;5000 after twenty years as ordinary of Newgate. Purney's accounts were particularly colourful because he harried condemned men to confess to more crimes than they had committed. He also tried unsuccessfully to reduce disorder at religious services in prison.<br>
<br>Purney's health declined from 1724, perhaps owing to typhus, endemic in Newgate. He withdrew from most duties two years before he resigned as ordinary in November 1727. His last <span class="italic">Ordinary's Account</span> appeared in May 1725, when one of the malefactors hanged was Jonathan Wild. However, Fielding's satire of the Newgate ordinary in his <span class="italic">History</span> of Wild  (<span class="italic">Miscellanies</span>, vol. 3, 1743) is probably directed against Purney's successor James Guthrie  (cf. <span class="italic">Craftsman</span>, 460, 26 April 1735). Purney is portrayed sympathetically in Harrison Ainsworth's <span class="italic">Jack Sheppard</span> (1839). It is thought he died in Kent in 1730.<br>
