<span class="headword">Fisher,  David (II)</span>  (1788&#150;1858), <span class="occ">actor and musician</span>, was born on 29 December 1788 in St Giles's, Norwich, the eldest of the five surviving children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64338/', "David (I) Fisher (1760&#150;1832)")</script>, who was at that time a singer and actor at the Norwich Theatre Royal, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Burrell (1761/2&#150;1814), an actress. When in 1792 David (I) Fisher left Norwich to set up a travelling company with William Scraggs, one result was that his young sons received their early education at successive local schools on the circuit. The playwright Edward Fitzball, in <span class="italic">Thirty-Five Years of a Dramatic Author's Life</span>  (1859, 1.16), recalls them as schoolfellows at Newmarket. &#145;Didn't I envy them&#146;, he writes, &#145;the possession of the tin daggers they sometimes stealthily brought up their sleeves to astound the boys with!&#146; Later they were boarded at Dr Binfield's academy in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, where they received a classical education, supplemented by separate tuition in music, dancing, fencing, and French. Acting and other arts of the theatre were learned on the training ground of the circuit. The younger David turned out to be a gifted actor, an excellent musician, and a versatile painter. He was also a lively and personable young man. A former member of the company recollected him as &#145;remarkably good-looking&#151;curly hair, blue eyes, florid complexion &hellip; a graceful dancer and a charming singer&#146;  (Carver, 11). More than one young woman wrote to him proposing marriage. Growing up in the company with him were his three younger brothers, Charles, George, and Henry (who, however, died in 1815). An only sister, Elizabeth, had died in 1808, aged eighteen.<br>
<br>By his early twenties Fisher was a leading actor in the company, as well as its chief scene painter, and also carried out the interior decoration of the new theatres his father had begun to build. It was about this time that a love affair began between him and the Hon. Mary Wilson, young daughter of Baron Berners. Marriage across such a wide social gulf was unthinkable and was forbidden by both fathers; an attempted elopement was frustrated, and in September 1815, against his inclination, Fisher was married to Miss F. B. Bane (1788/9&#150;1818) of Pulham, Norfolk. A son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9492/', "David (III) Fisher")</script>, was born the following July, and later a daughter, Elizabeth.<br>
<br>In 1817 the committee of Drury Lane Theatre invited Fisher to play in place of Edmund Kean in several of the star's key roles during his indisposition. It was an invidious honour. On 3 December he played Macbeth; on the 5th and 6th, Richard III; on the 8th, Macbeth again; and Hamlet on the 10th&#151;on which day the playbills announced Kean's imminent return, in the role of Richard III. There was no second performance of Fisher's Hamlet, though it and his Macbeth and Richard had been well received by both audience and press, apart from a small faction intent on dismissing any young aspirant who might invite comparison with Kean. The situation was summed up by <span class="italic">The Sun</span> of 8 December 1817, when, after reviewing Fisher's second performance of Macbeth, it concluded:<blockquote>his errors were very few and very trifling, and sink to nothing in comparison with his general merits. He had evidently some enemies in the house, but their feeble and ill-directed hostility only served to draw forth a liberal and zealous support from the audience in general.</blockquote>In the event, he was offered a permanent engagement at Drury Lane alongside Kean, with whom he was said to have been on good terms. During the next season he was very successful in such parts as Jaffier in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, Bassanio in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, Lord Townly in <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span>, and Titus in Payne's new play <span class="italic">Brutus</span>. Then, on 26 December 1818, his wife died, leaving him with two small children; also, he was being sorely missed on the home circuit. In February 1819 he threw up his London engagement and rejoined the Norfolk and Suffolk Company, in which&#151;with occasional appearances elsewhere&#151;he performed for the next ten years, while also working with his father on successive new theatres. His theatre interior at North Walsham is recorded in two contemporary watercolour sketches in the Fisher theatre collection. He also painted landscapes and family portraits, which are still in the possession of descendants.<br>
<br>The outstanding musical ability of the family was widely recognized at the time. The three brothers were, for instance, leading members of the orchestra of the Norwich triennial music festivals from their inception in 1824. David was also for some time leader of the band of the Norwich choral society. In 1831 he gave up the stage in order to teach music and dancing. On 15 December 1824 he had married a second wife, Sarah Howard, an actress, who, however, died a few years later, leaving two young daughters, Sarah and Harriet.<br>
<br>David (I) Fisher died in 1832, the management of the company then devolving on the second son, Charles. After a few years it, like other theatre companies, was hit by recession, and business declined. David (II) Fisher, who had retired from teaching in 1841, returned to the company over the winter of 1841&#150;2 to lend support, but the odds were too great: by 1844 the circuit was closed, the theatres sold.<br>
<br>Fisher was now living in retirement in Woodbridge, a respected member of society and of the literary coterie surrounding his friend Edward Fitzgerald. Here, too, lived Mary Wilson. A provision of her father's will, disinheriting her should she wed Fisher, had prevented their ever marrying. She had paid for the education of Fisher's children and grandchildren, and now, in Woodbridge, she looked after him until he died there on 20 August 1858. Sixteen years later she was buried by his side in Woodbridge cemetery.<br>
<br>In its obituary notice of 29 August 1858, <span class="italic">The Era</span> wrote of Fisher's &#145;wonderful versatility&#146; and of the &#145;absolute success&#146; of his Drury Lane appearances, concluding:<blockquote>His talent as an actor was universal, and had the London audience had the same opportunity as others, of witnessing his less ambitious but more varied and genial performances, he would have been lamented by the London world as he will now by a circle of provincial friends. (<span class="italic">The Era</span>)</blockquote>
