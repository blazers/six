<span class="headword">Killen,  Thomas Young</span>  (1826&#150;1886), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland</span>, son of Edward Killen, a merchant in Ballymena, co. Antrim, was born at Ballymena on 30 October 1826. His boyhood was spent at Glenwherry, to which his father moved in 1832. He was educated initially by a private tutor, and in 1842 entered the Belfast Academical Institution, where he took several prizes. In 1846 he began his theological studies under the theological faculty of the Irish Presbyterian church. In 1847, during his studies, he spent his summer vacation as a missionary in Camlin, co. Roscommon, despite the prevalence of famine fever.<br>
<br>On 19 May 1848 Killen was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Carrickfergus, and returned to the west of Ireland until 25 September 1850, when he was ordained by the presbytery of Letterkenny as minister of Ramelton Third Presbyterian, co. Donegal, where his pastorate proved very successful. During his ministry there, in 1854 he married Elizabeth, daughter of William Wilson of Raphoe, whose brother, Charles, was MP for Donegal in 1876&#150;9. In 1857 Killen received a call from the congregation of Ballykelly, co. Londonderry, and was installed there on 31 March. He took a leading part in the Ulster revival of 1859. Among the new Presbyterian congregations formed in the wake of the revival was Duncairn in Belfast and Killen was called as its first minister in December 1861. It grew rapidly under his ministry and its church building was enlarged twice. He became one of the leading figures in the Irish general assembly, of which in 1882 he was elected moderator. In 1883 the degree of DD was conferred on him by the Presbyterian Theological Faculty, Ireland. He died suddenly of a heart attack on 21 October 1886, at the Duncairn manse, Belfast, leaving a widow and seven children. He was buried on 25 October in Balmoral cemetery, Belfast.<br>
<br>Killen was the author of <span class="italic">A Sacramental Catechism</span> (1874), which ran through several editions, and was republished in America. For four years (1869&#150;73), he edited a monthly magazine, the <span class="italic">Evangelical Witness</span>, and on the establishment of the <span class="italic">Witness</span> newspaper in Belfast in 1874 he wrote much in its columns. He also published several sermons and tracts.<br>
