</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chamberlain,  Joseph <span class="st"> [Joe]</span></span>  (1836&#150;1914), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born on 8 July 1836 at 3 Grove Hill Terrace, Camberwell, Surrey, the first of the nine children of Joseph Chamberlain (1796&#150;1874), cordwainer and metal manufacturer, and his wife, Caroline (1808&#150;1875), daughter of Henry Harben, brewer and provisions merchant. Joseph Chamberlain&#151;the third member of the family, after his father and his grandfather, to bear that name&#151;was the first industrialist to reach the highest tier of leadership in British politics. Though he never became prime minister, he was generally considered by the beginning of the twentieth century to be the first minister of the British empire. He was a Unitarian by conviction until the death of his second wife and remained so afterwards by proud allegiance. That allegiance accentuated his difference from the established &eacute;lite in politics, and especially from his eventual Conservative allies with their loyalty to the established church. But it was the background of his family and his own experience in manufacturing industry that more profoundly shaped his politics.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandeducation"></a>Family background and education</h2>There was an imperial element in that background. For four generations, from the mid-eighteenth century, the Chamberlains had earned their living near the Guildhall in London as cordwainers or makers of new shoes. Their industry prospered in wartime because all those foot soldiers had to be shod. Accordingly the Chamberlains differed from their most prominent fellow Unitarian, the minister Joseph Priestley, in supporting the war against revolutionary France. They appreciated the blessings of a belligerent state. Joseph Chamberlain's grandfather was a staunch supporter of the Honourable Artillery Company and early in the war became captain of its north-western division.<br>
<br>Though the Chamberlains prospered from their industry, they continued to live modestly over their shop until young Joseph was about to be born, when they moved to a terraced house in Camberwell. The Chamberlains were an austere lot who stuck to business. But from his mother's side his family derived a richer literary culture, enjoyment of good food and drink, delight in the plays they put on for themselves at high days and family festivals&#151;in which young Joseph shone&#151;and, in an earlier age, involvement on the fringes of the world of high politics. His great-grandfather had managed the parliamentary constituency interests of two whig dukes, first for the elder Pitt's colleague the duke of Newcastle and then for the duke of Richmond. Young Joseph was a high-spirited boy and pugnacious as well as serious. He received the best education on offer for those destined for business. After early instruction at a dame-school in Camberwell and at a further school conducted by a Church of England clergyman in Islington, he was sent to University College School in London, an institution held in high esteem among Unitarians. He carried away prizes in Latin and French as well as mathematics and science. Upon graduation he was apprenticed to his father's business, briefly, to begin with, in the actual making of shoes but soon in bookkeeping, where the business was controlled. His horizons were broadened during this apprenticeship by a holiday trip to Belgium and France as translator for his uncle, another cordwainer.<h2>
<a name="Industrialcareer"></a>Industrial career</h2>Although the family remained affluent, the business of cordwaining was flat in the comparatively pacific middle years of the nineteenth century. Joseph Chamberlain's father welcomed the opportunity to invest in a venture by his brother-in-law, J. S. Nettlefold, who manufactured wood screws in Birmingham. Nettlefold had been confronted at the 1851 exhibition in the Crystal Palace by machinery invented by an American for the automated manufacture of wood screws with an improved design. Whoever purchased British rights to the patent could dominate the domestic market. The cost of the patent, together with a supply of machines and construction of a factory to house them, was high. Nettlefold sought help from Joseph Chamberlain's father, who invested &pound;10,000 initially and more later. He sent young Joseph to Birmingham in 1854, shortly after his eighteenth birthday, to look after the investment. The new arrival and the industrious town took each other to heart.<br>
<br>In the course of the next fifteen years Joseph Chamberlain and his father, and J. S. Nettlefold and his son, yet another Joseph, turned themselves into the &#145;Screw Kings&#146;, as young Chamberlain called them. He began, as in his father's cordwaining business, on the accounting side. Moving up from that base, he assumed charge of marketing, leaving production to his cousin Joseph Nettlefold. The four men together made the decisions required to win monopoly control of the domestic market and carve out a commercial empire overseas. They extended their production vertically to include ironworks, the making of steel rods, and the drawing of the wire from which screws were made. On the accounting side Joseph Chamberlain scrutinized every category of cost, including the amount and kind of metal used, the steel cuttings from the nicks and threads of the screws which could be melted down with other steel to improve the quality of the mixture, and the processes involved, such as hot forging or the use of cold wire. He worked out percentages for the overhead costs at each mill as well as for packaging, warehousing, taxes, and the expenses of his sales organization. He took systematic note of the type of labour and the sex and age of the workers customarily employed to make each product. In this way he came to see that a shortened working day increased the productivity of labour. As a result he eventually introduced a nine-hour day, which earned the enduring gratitude of his employees and impressed the trade union movement nationally. He worked out a system of discounts, which prevailed throughout the industry into the next century, for cash payment or credit and for the sales organization, depending on the relationship of the sales agent to the firm and the nature of the competition in each particular market. He also paid attention to the idiosyncrasies of foreign markets, and produced an illustrated catalogue of the ever more varied wares of the firm.<br>
<br>To secure the co-operation he needed from other branches of commerce, Chamberlain joined the board of directors of the Midland Railway, and he helped turn the private banking firm of Lloyds in Birmingham into a public joint-stock company. Able in all these ways to reduce its intermediate costs and finance expansion, Nettlefold and Chamberlain, as the business was known, cut the price of its products in order to absorb or crush the domestic competition. Abroad Chamberlain marketed his goods so successfully that producers in the United States, though protected by a wall of tariffs, paid his firm a large annual sum to stay away&#151;an achievement which left him long convinced of the compatibility of imperialism and free trade. He agreed with one French firm to divide continental Europe into spheres of influence, Nettlefold and Chamberlain taking the markets washed by the sea, leaving landlocked countries to the French company. He took advantage of the Franco-Prussian War to take over the markets of another French competitor.<h2>
<a name="Transferintopubliclifeandmarriages"></a>Transfer into public life, and marriages</h2>The expansion of the firm, however, did not impress Chamberlain as much as its social impact in Birmingham. He was the first industrialist to recognize that large factory operations like his own, which were springing up around Birmingham, posed a threat to the comparative harmony between classes fostered by the prevalence hitherto of small workshops in which the distance between employer and employee was narrow. He explored some possibilities for restoring class co-operation within large business through company-sponsored education and recreational clubs for workers, and profit sharing with senior employees. But disappointed by or uneasy about these options, he turned, along with other concerned businessmen in Birmingham, to elementary education. In 1869 they founded the National Education League. Rapidly extended in alliance with the Central Nonconformist Committee across the English provinces, the Education League sought parliamentary legislation to create a national network of schools under civic control, fully funded by taxation, to instil into every child, unless educated elsewhere, basic literacy and numeracy and, if need be, non-denominational religious instruction. This initiative catapulted Chamberlain into national politics in 1870, though he did not enter parliament for another six years.<br>
<br>When the government of W. E. Gladstone met the demand with a measure which in effect retained the Church of England as the primary provider of elementary education, Chamberlain fomented a radical rebellion combining nonconformists and organized labour against the Liberal leadership. But the fruits of the rebellion indicated that he was as much out of touch with the Liberal rank and file as were the leaders of the party, and that divided from each other they would only incur defeat, which Disraeli duly inflicted in the general election of 1874. Standing for election at Sheffield, Chamberlain personally experienced the defeat to which he had contributed.<br>
<br>The major phases in Chamberlain's career were reinforced with happy marriages which, however, in the first two cases terminated tragically. In 1861 he married Harriet Kenrick (1838&#150;1863), daughter of Archibald Kenrick of Berrow Court, Edgbaston, a Birmingham businessman and fellow Unitarian, and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59298/', "William Kenrick (1831&#150;1919)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53590/', "Kenrick family (per. c.1785&#150;1926)")</script>]. This marriage introduced Chamberlain to the pleasures of life enjoyed by Birmingham's upper-middle class. He moved out of lodgings into a house on Harborne Road. There, from his father-in-law and in common with his younger partner, Joseph Nettlefold, he acquired a love of gardening which endured for the rest of his life. But two years after their marriage, having already borne a daughter (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101358/', "Beatrice Mary Chamberlain (1862&#150;1918)")</script>, later a prominent opponent of women's suffrage), Harriet died giving birth to her second child, (Joseph) Austen. Grief-stricken, Chamberlain fled from his home, eventually moving into the home of Harriet's parents, where her older sister could take care of the children. He threw himself frantically into his business and also into the educational activities which led him into public life. In 1868 he married Harriet's first cousin, Florence Kenrick (1847&#150;1875), the daughter of Timothy Kenrick of Birmingham. Serious of spirit though never physically sturdy, Florence was an advocate of the franchise for women. She furthered her own education while she bore Chamberlain four more children, (Arthur) Neville, Ida [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/105115">(Florence) Ida Chamberlain</a> <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/101358">Beatrice Chamberlain</a>], Hilda [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/105116">(Caroline) Hilda Chamberlain</a> <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/101358">Beatrice Chamberlain</a>], and Ethel. Florence edited the articles Chamberlain wrote for the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> to proclaim the first of his radical programmes. She promoted the transformation of Southbourne, the home they acquired, into the after-hours headquarters for the radical captains of Birmingham. She looked forward to the political life of London once he gained election to parliament. But before that happened, in 1875, she died giving birth to a stillborn son. Once again Chamberlain fled, this time to the Mediterranean, after which he plunged himself deeper in work, now as mayor of Birmingham, to which he was first elected in 1873. He entered the House of Commons in 1876, but he never found the secure radical footing in parliamentary politics that Florence had helped him to find in the civic politics of Birmingham.<h2>
<a name="Civicachievement"></a>Civic achievement</h2>The defeat of the Liberals in the general election of 1874 concentrated Chamberlain's energies on the civic arena in Birmingham and on his role as mayor. In June he retired from business. After arranging for the rest of his family, he was left with capital of &pound;100,000, enough to keep him affluent for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>Chamberlain devoted his talent for business to civic purposes. Taking over the local utilities, which were in private hands, first gas and then water, he consolidated and improved services, reduced costs, and at the same time broadened the town's revenue base. This remarkable financial accomplishment and its social benefits persuaded the town to extend its civic enterprise. Thus, early in his political career, Chamberlain constructed arguably his greatest and most enduring accomplishment, a model of &#145;gas-and-water&#146; or municipal socialism widely admired in the industrial world. At his ceaseless urging, Birmingham embarked on an improvement scheme to tear down its central slums and replace them with healthy housing and commercial thoroughfares, both to ventilate the town and to attract business. This scheme, however, strained the financial resources of the town and undermined the consensus in favour of reform.<h2>
<a name="RadicalLiberal"></a>Radical Liberal</h2>Before his civic policy revived the partisan division of the town, Birmingham elected Chamberlain to be one of its members of parliament at a by-election in June 1876. He was sorry to leave the civic arena where he had performed so well. He never abandoned the belief that more good could be done in local politics than at the parliamentary level. He was almost forty when he secured election to parliament, and he knew that if he waited longer he would arrive too late to make his mark. Even so, after three years in the environs of Westminster, where his prospects for advancement looked good, he reaffirmed his attachment to Birmingham by building himself a new home there, much grander than Southbourne, on a crest of land at the southern edge of the town overlooking a still-rural valley. He named his new home Highbury after the district in London where he had spent his youth. He continued to lavish money on the building and its furnishings, to extend the attached greenhouses, and to elaborate the gardens in the 18 acres of grounds. Highbury was the centre of his universe, large enough to accommodate visiting colleagues from Westminster but away from its demands; it was close to his most intimate associates in Birmingham, with facilities for him to indulge in his favourite recreation of breeding orchids, and with space outside for the enormous garden parties that kept him in touch with his constituents. Once he became a cabinet minister he rented and then purchased a house on Princes Gardens in Knightsbridge, but it never became his residence of choice.<br>
<br>In appearance alone Chamberlain impressed parliament from the outset. Belying expectations of what a provincial mayor would look like, he wore his monocle like a gentleman, as the fastidious Disraeli observed. The monocle and an orchid&#151;or three if they were small&#151;in his buttonhole became his trademarks in politics. He was shorter than many of his aristocratic contemporaries, but that rarely provoked comment. He was clean-shaven in a bearded age. More remarkably, he looked young&#151;as if he were in his twenties when he reached forty, in his forties when he passed sixty. Like his politics, he looked new.<br>
<br>Chamberlain's arrival in parliament coincided with a deepening downturn in the economy. It fortified the critics of his civic policy in Birmingham. Chamberlain did not have a ready political response either locally or nationally to what became known as the great depression. He understood industry's need for governmental action in the social sphere, but he remained confident that industry did not need assistance in the workshop or market place. His experience of overseas sales, particularly in the American market, left him contemptuous of tariffs. He did not see how to apply the principles of gas-and-water socialism at the national level. In any case, the issues with which the politicians and the public were preoccupied when he entered parliament were imperial and foreign rather than social or directly commercial.<br>
<br>Less interested in foreign affairs than in the set-back to radicals in common with all Liberals in the general election of 1874, Chamberlain sought to apply to the national party not the civic policy but the party organizational skills which he had helped to develop in Birmingham. The Birmingham Liberal Association mobilized its electoral support ward by ward through ascending levels of elective representation under the controlling leadership of Chamberlain and his lieutenants. He extended that model to industrial England with the establishment in 1877 of a National Federation of Liberal Associations. When Chamberlain presented the federation to Gladstone as a way to harness popular support for his agitation over the atrocities committed by the Ottoman empire in Bulgaria, the latter agreed to support the federation, and stayed with Chamberlain at his house, Southbourne, during the National Liberal Federation's inaugural meeting on 31 May 1877. Cautiously, Gladstone continued to defend the National Liberal Federation against its critics. For the next three years Gladstone and Chamberlain co-operated with each other, though always from a distance and with separate objectives, Gladstone reclaiming his leadership of the Liberal Party, Chamberlain climbing his way up towards its controlling echelons. There was little sign of the difference in imperial sentiment which would later divide them. Deterred by the cost of British imperial expansion in South Africa and south Asia, and delighted by the damage it did to Disraeli's government, for a while Chamberlain became a Little Englander.<br>
<br>The contribution the National Liberal Federation made to the Liberal victory in the general election of 1880 helped Chamberlain to push his way into the cabinet as president of the Board of Trade when Gladstone formed his second ministry. That ministry frustrated Chamberlain as it did each of its members, though in different ways. Like the rest of the cabinet, he entered office without a defined domestic agenda, and in any case they were all immediately distracted by upheavals in Ireland and Africa. His legislative accomplishments in his five years at the Board of Trade were for the most part measures already in the administrative pipeline of the board, in particular those on bankruptcy and patents. His chief initiative was intrinsically admirable, but he handled it with impetuous clumsiness and a disastrous lack of tact. He sought to prevent shipowners from insuring themselves against financial loss and occasionally even guaranteeing themselves a profit from the loss of life, sometimes heavy, among merchant seamen who were sent out in ill-equipped vessels. But his attack on shipowners for their negligence alienated conscientious owners as well as the callous; it frightened small investors as well as large, and failed to attract much support in the electorate, among whom merchant seamen were a negligible force.<br>
<br>The importance that affairs in Ireland and Africa acquired in the early 1880s might have diverted attention from Chamberlain, given his official responsibilities and known concerns for domestic matters. Yet from the outset of the ministry he assumed a prominent position on imperial issues. He responded with some sympathy to the agrarian unrest and accompanying nationalist agitation which erupted in Ireland. It gave him an opportunity to create a radical liaison between the cabinet and the Irish leader, C. S. Parnell, with whom he had sometimes co-operated in the previous parliament. But the intermediary upon whom in 1882 Chamberlain relied for this purpose, W. H. O'Shea, damaged Chamberlain's reputation and discredited the mediation. O'Shea wished to use his position as complaisant husband of Parnell's mistress to advance his personal ambitions in British politics, and his discretion was not equal to the demands of such an intrigue. These means nevertheless helped to release Parnell from gaol in 1882 and to give full effect to the previous year's transformation of Irish land law in the interest of the tenants.<br>
<br>Developments in Africa also had an ambivalent impact on Chamberlain. In common with most other radicals he was, on balance, repelled by Britain's deepening involvement in Egypt, with which he concerned himself only as a participant in cabinet discussion. But he was called upon to play a prominent role on South Africa, and the turn of events there ended his interlude as a Little Englander. R. W. Dale, his leading nonconformist lieutenant in Birmingham, had made him aware of the interest of British missionaries in southern Africa. From that time Chamberlain publicly endorsed the opposition which Gladstone proclaimed in the dying months of the Disraeli ministry to the annexation of the inland Boer republics by the British colonies along the southern coast. When the Liberals took office Gladstone asked Chamberlain to speak in the House of Commons for the government on South African issues, the colonial secretary being in the House of Lords. Gladstone then proved reluctant to cancel the annexation; but Chamberlain encouraged him to accept the Boer demand of internal autonomy for their republics, and he continued to press for this even after the humiliating defeat which the Boers inflicted on the British at Majuba Hill. He was accordingly among the most prominent advocates of the convention of Pretoria, in which Britain made the demanded concession. But the refusal of the Boers thereafter to confine themselves within the terms of the convention, and simultaneous encroachments upon the region by Bismarck's Germany, turned Chamberlain to defiance.<br>
<br>The prospect of a wide extension of the electorate in 1884 excited Chamberlain as promising a new chapter of domestic affairs in which his radicals could take charge. In the previous year, during a speech in Birmingham on 30 March, he had notoriously denounced the aristocracy as a class &#145;who toil not, neither do they spin&#146;  (J. Chamberlain, <span class="italic">Speeches of the Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain MP</span>, ed. H. W. Lucy, 1885, 41). When the House of Lords resisted the government's <span class="roman">Franchise Bill</span> he orchestrated the popular outcry, and in doing so marked himself out as Liberal leader for the future. At the beginning of 1885, after the <span class="roman">Franchise Bill</span> became law, he proclaimed the most famous of his radical programmes to meet the needs and desires of the new electorate. In substance the programme was restrained. But the rhetoric Chamberlain employed, particularly his choice of the word &#145;ransom&#146; to describe the social insurance which he wished the affluent to provide for the working class, raised fears among the propertied&#151;and the new electors still had to be householders. In the ensuing general election campaign he reduced his demands to what he considered minimal proportions. But they still included free education&#151;and that alarmed the supporters of Church of England schools, failed to satisfy the nonconformists who desired civic control of denominational schools, and repelled householders fearful of an increase in the rates. The results of the general election at the end of the year disappointed him. Although his proposals for small allotments of land, or &#145;three acres and a cow&#146;, attracted the new electors in the countryside, the Conservatives made headway in suburban constituencies and thus deprived the Liberals of their parliamentary majority outside of Ireland. The Irish nationalists under Parnell emerged with a much expanded Commons contingent, and thus gained decisive influence in the new house.<h2>
<a name="Thehomerulecrisis"></a>The home-rule crisis</h2>The ensuing parliamentary crisis distorted Chamberlain's partisan alignment and deprived the Liberal Party of power for twenty years, to say nothing of the impact on Anglo-Irish relations. Though the part Chamberlain played in the crisis was essentially self-defensive, it proved pivotal to the outcome in the kingdom.<br>
<br>At the beginning of 1885, giving his radical programme an Irish dimension, Chamberlain had offered Parnell a central board scheme framed to give Ireland an expanded version of the powers of local government that Birmingham had used to such good effect. But when, in the middle of the year, Conservatives indicated that they might be willing to make a more substantial bid for Irish nationalist support, Parnell turned Chamberlain down and, adding insult to injury, prevented him from receiving a civil reception in Ireland. Angered, Chamberlain dropped Ireland from his election programme.<br>
<br>Afterwards, in an attempt to minimize the significance of the losses which the Liberals sustained in the general election, Chamberlain advised the party to lie low and leave the Conservatives in office to be discredited by their tacit alliance with the Irish. But instead Gladstone returned to office in January 1886, and replaced Chamberlain's radical agenda with a proposal for internal self-government of Ireland on terms acceptable to Parnell. Before this reorientation of Liberal priorities became clear, Chamberlain, who bid for the Colonial Office, declined the Admiralty, and returned to office apprehensively as president of the Local Government Board, attempted to act on his own agenda by initiating an inquiry into the use of local public works to alleviate unemployment; this resulted in his circular of 15 March, which became a famous paper of governmental initiative. But at the same time he precipitated the disclosure of Gladstone's intentions on Ireland. Once their direction was clear, Chamberlain and G. O. Trevelyan resigned from the cabinet in a dramatic gesture on 26 March 1886: &#145;Trevelyan and myself again tendered our resignations and left the [Cabinet] room&#146;  (Chamberlain, <span class="italic">Political Memoir</span>, 199). Declining friendly advice to leave quietly, he threw himself into the fight against Gladstone's proposals, for a combination of reasons, imperial, domestic, and personal: because they threatened to weaken the central government of the United Kingdom, because they took precedence away from his radical programme, and because they undermined his own standing in the Liberal hierarchy. Still he hoped that Liberals would appreciate the conscientiousness of his opposition when it so obviously deprived him of office and that they would welcome him back when the Irish debate was resolved and Gladstone retired. The conflict, however, became bitterly personal. Most Liberals, including radicals and the National Liberal Federation, interpreted Chamberlain's behaviour as a blatant bid to supplant the Grand Old Man as leader of the party; and Gladstone, though already seventy-six, was destined to live for another decade.<br>
<br>Against Chamberlain's predilections and the grain of the major parties, he found himself allied not only with the Conservatives, led by the third marquess of Salisbury, whom he learned to respect, and Lord Randolph Churchill, whom he regarded as a kindred spirit, but also with whig defectors from the Liberal Party led by Lord Hartington, whom he disliked as a drag. This alliance of men who had denounced each other in vivid terms months earlier in the 1885 election was confirmed by the general election which Gladstone called in mid-1886 as soon as his <span class="roman">Government of Ireland Bill</span> was defeated in the House of Commons. The general election of 1886 hardened the split in the Liberal Party and necessitated an electoral compact between Liberal Unionists and Conservatives. The electoral survival of Hartington in Lancashire depended on support from Chamberlain as well as Conservatives, which both gave. Chamberlain had more independent strength in Birmingham. He turned the town into a bastion of radical Unionism, excluding Gladstonians from the parliamentary representation of the town and conceding only one of its seven seats to the Conservatives. He thus established himself as that rare phenomenon in English politics, a strong regional as well as national figure. He helped to preserve a substantial Liberal Unionist contingent in the new House of Commons, enough to keep the Conservatives from reaping all the fruits of the Unionist victory. Yet his place in the line-up of parties remained anomalous. Though Salisbury depended on Liberal Unionists for his majority in the Commons, he refused to form a ministry that included Chamberlain, nor would Chamberlain join a combined ministry led by Hartington. Chamberlain thus delayed the formation of a coalition for a decade.<h2>
<a name="RadicalUnionist"></a>Radical Unionist</h2>During that decade Chamberlain carved out a distinctive position for himself, innovative in both domestic and imperial affairs. The role he developed proved vital to the success of the Unionist cause and restored the prospect of his gaining high, though no longer the highest, office. He found the first year after the 1886 election discouraging. Churchill, the member of the Conservative ministry upon whom Chamberlain relied to make his wishes effective, resigned in December. Immediately Chamberlain proposed a round-table conference of leading Unionist and Gladstonian Liberals with a view to reunion. The conference was duly convened. But it exposed the impossibility of agreement so long as Gladstone insisted on, and Chamberlain refused to concede the prompt granting of, a generous measure of domestic autonomy for Ireland. The last real prospect of Liberal reunion thus vanished. Chamberlain looked to the alternative possibility of a centre party composed of Liberals who would settle for less Irish autonomy and Unionists who would do more than defend the <i>status quo</i>. But this alternative depended on Churchill, who petulantly went his own way, and on Hartington, who shied away from any constitutional change. Against all expectation, the one reliable relationship to develop among the Unionist leaders was between Chamberlain and Salisbury. Both strong-minded men, though one wished to arrest and the other to accelerate the pace of change, they learned to trust each other even when they disagreed. Still, the end of the summer of 1887 found Chamberlain near despair, afraid that Gladstonians and the Irish would sweep all before them.<br>
<br>Chamberlain welcomed an opportunity for escape. Salisbury offered him the leadership of a diplomatic mission to Washington to deal with a fisheries dispute between Canada and the United States. The mission (November 1887 &#150; March 1888) confirmed Chamberlain's Unionism. It also nourished his interest in imperial opportunities to strengthen Britain's international position, opportunities in pursuit of which he might also strengthen his personal position in British politics. He was gratified to discover that, belying Gladstonian reports, the leading men in American public life were closet Liberal Unionists. Though fear of the substantial and articulate Irish electorate in the United States made them unwilling to speak out, privately their memory of the hard fight to preserve the American Union inclined them to oppose the amount of autonomy Gladstone would give Ireland. When Chamberlain visited Canada he found that the governing Conservatives there shared his insistence on strong central government. He was still more impressed by the economic resources opened up by the Canadian Pacific Railway. At a banquet in Toronto, and then at Henry Adams's dinner table in Washington, Chamberlain began to preach an imperial mission for the English, unifying kindred races and &#145;working out &hellip; the great problem of federal government&#146;  (W. Maycock, <span class="italic">With Mr Chamberlain in the United States and Canada, 1887&#150;8</span>, 1914, 100 ff.).<br>
<br>Chamberlain secured two agreements in Washington: a <i>modus vivendi</i> with the American and Canadian governments to deal with the fisheries dispute, and an engagement to marry Mary Endicott (<i>d</i>. 1957), only daughter of William Crowninshield Endicott, secretary of the army in President Cleveland's cabinet. Less than half Chamberlain's age, Mary was a Massachusetts patrician who enjoyed the world of privilege and power. The wedding took place in November 1888, to the distress of Beatrice Potter, with whom he had had an association since 1883, though her passion for him was unrequited. When Mary joined Chamberlain in England she helped to settle him socially among the well-born Conservatives and whigs with whom he was now politically associated. The universality, none the less, with which he was known as Joe, not only on the streets of Birmingham but up to the royal family, reflected his sturdily popular associations. To the end of his life he refused any honour which would give him a title other than Mr.<br>
<br>On his return from the New World to the Old, Chamberlain made two lasting adjustments in his political course. He made himself indispensable to the Unionist cause through endlessly resourceful opposition to home rule; and he added policy initiatives on imperial issues to his programme while adapting and developing its social side to make the most of the Conservative interest in reform. Along the way he refined a lean and pointed style of speech, responsive to but never distracted by interjections, and in doing so established a new model of platform oratory. He also emerged, in the judgement of close observers, as the ablest debater in the House of Commons. His envenomed indictment of home rule provoked retaliatory personal attacks from English radicals and Irish nationalists, who could not forgive him for deserting them. But he earned the gratitude of Unionists as much as the hatred of the Irish for being the man who killed home rule. Sharp practice and scandal accompanied these controversies. Chamberlain made the most of what proved to be false charges in <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1887 against Parnell for condoning crime, and he encouraged O'Shea to pursue the suit for divorce that finally ruined the Irish leader.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Chamberlain equipped Unionists with a constructive programme to enhance their essentially negative <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of resistance to home rule. On the imperial side, he aimed to strengthen the central government of the empire and cultivate its economic resources. He turned his attention first to South Africa, where fabulous resources of gold had just been discovered and more seemed in store. In this case he was less concerned with these resources economically than with the political power which their development threatened to transfer from London to South Africa, and within South Africa to the Boer republics, particularly the Transvaal where the goldfields were situated. Suspicious of Cecil Rhodes, who used his enormous wealth from the diamond mines of Kimberley, and now the gold of the Rand, to promote his political ambitions at the Cape, Chamberlain wanted to limit the terms of the charter which Rhodes sought from Lord Salisbury's government for development to the north of the Transvaal. But the government gave way to Rhodes because it saw no other avenue for development which would avoid heavy imperial expenditure.<br>
<br>The economic developments Chamberlain wanted to promote lay elsewhere in the empire, and they usually involved the construction of railways. He was not in a position to make detailed proposals. But he drew the attention of working-class audiences, particularly after Gladstone's return to office in 1892, to the way in which markets and railway projects overseas could alleviate unemployment at home. Chamberlain himself invested heavily in a sisal plantation in the Bahamas. But his skill as an accountant had deteriorated with disuse. He made the initial investment against the advice of his brothers in business. When the returns proved disappointing, he deepened his investment; and he incurred further liabilities when he turned the business into a limited company, selling debentures. When the crop failed he lost so heavily that in the spring of 1895 he contemplated retiring from public life. Yet this personal experience did nothing to diminish his enthusiasm for public investment in the empire.<br>
<br>On the domestic side, Chamberlain claimed and received credit for the Conservative government's extension of elective local government to the counties in 1888 and for the elimination of fees in state-aided elementary schools in 1891. Conservatives had reasons of their own for passing both measures, but Chamberlain undoubtedly increased their appetite for domestic reform. He took care wherever possible to encourage suggestions for reform made by Conservatives. It was through Sir John Gorst, the maverick Conservative MP for Chatham, that Chamberlain learned of the German scheme for insuring workmen hurt in industrial accidents. He placed workmen's compensation promptly on his Unionist platform and used the German model to undercut alternative Liberal proposals that pitted trade unions against employers. He always looked for ways to bring labour and capital together. In 1897, at last back in office now under Salisbury, Chamberlain saw to the enactment of a <span class="roman">Workmen's Compensation Bill</span>. The crowning domestic achievement of the Unionists at the end of the century, this act served its social purpose at little cost to the Treasury. The compensation was paid for by insurance which employers were required to take out.<br>
<br>Nothing comparable was to come of Chamberlain's more spectacular initiative in proposing old-age pensions. He first made the suggestion in 1891 in support of a Conservative candidate during a closely watched by-election at Aston on the borders of Birmingham. He pursued the suggestion after the narrow Liberal victory in the general election of 1892. But in spite of repeated attempts during the remainder of the decade, he could not find a scheme that offered much for what he liked to call the &#145;veterans of industry&#146; without placing a heavier burden on the Treasury than Unionists were willing to impose. Once he launched his campaign for tariff reform a decade later, he suggested paying for old-age pensions from revenue raised through tariffs. But when the working class appeared to be more worried about raising the cost of living through a tariff on foodstuffs than they were attracted by benefits in old age, he dropped the suggestion, to the regret of some social reforming Conservatives.<br>
<br>In 1894, anticipating the fall of the beleaguered Liberal government, Chamberlain sought support from Lord Salisbury for his social programme by suggesting that parts of it be introduced through bills in the House of Lords. Salisbury evaded this proposal, as he did all other Liberal Unionist attempts to settle the terms for a coalition ministry with the Conservatives before the Liberals were removed from office. As a result Chamberlain's programme for Unionism remained unofficial, widely influential in some Conservative and Liberal Unionist circles but firmly opposed in others.<h2>
<a name="Colonialsecretary"></a>Colonial secretary</h2>Not until the Liberals fell from office in June 1895 did Salisbury call the duke of Devonshire (as Hartington had become) and Chamberlain into council to decide on the terms for and composition of a coalition Unionist ministry. The way in which Salisbury expressed himself on social policy, though vague, was flattering to Chamberlain, who did not ask for clarification. He disconcerted Salisbury, however, by choosing the post of secretary of state for the colonies for himself. Aside from gratifying Chamberlain's sense of imperial mission, the choice reduced the risks of confrontation with Conservatives on social and fiscal issues; but it encroached upon the responsibilities Salisbury chose for himself by becoming foreign secretary as well as prime minister.<br>
<br>That risk was averted for two years after the formation of the ministry and its triumphant confirmation at the polls by the basic agreement between Salisbury and Chamberlain on most imperial issues and by Chamberlain's distraction over the Jameson raid. Just after Christmas 1895 a lieutenant of Rhodes, Dr Starr Jameson, accompanied by a small force of men on horseback, invaded the Transvaal from a base under British control on its western border in an attempt to replace the Boer government of the republic with one sympathetic to Britain. The Boers crushed the raid without difficulty. Its defeat discredited the British inside the republic and out. It ruined Cecil Rhodes politically, though he preserved his economic might. It threatened to ruin Chamberlain, for he had given Rhodes's men possession of the strip of land from which Jameson launched his raid. Afterwards, for a year and a half, Chamberlain had to protect himself against the suspicion, which amounted among Rhodes's people to the knowledge, that he had known beforehand that the strip of land could be used for a raid&#151;though he could never have conceived of one as ill supported as Jameson's. Chamberlain was saved by Rhodes's knowledge that the continuation of the British charter for his interests north of the Transvaal depended on Chamberlain's retention of office, and also by the preoccupation among Liberal investigators in Britain with the extent of Rhodes's guilt. Chamberlain escaped without discredit except among the Boers and their sympathizers in South Africa.<br>
<br>Amid the difficulties of these eighteen months Chamberlain canvassed the possibility of augmenting the trade between Britain and its self-governing colonies through creation of an imperial <i>Zollverein</i>; but the suggestion elicited little sympathy either in the colonies, which relied on tariffs for revenue and for protection of their nascent industries, or in free-trading Britain. He had a little more success with the crown colonies governed by Britain. Before the Jameson raid he asked the governors of these colonies for information to help expand trade with the mother country. The former marketing manager asked for specifics on everything from prices and freight rates to patterns and packaging, and for samples of each colony's imports and exports. At the same time he attempted to use the dividends which Britain earned from its shares in the Suez Canal to fund the construction of railways and other infrastructural improvements in the crown colonies. Resistance from the Treasury, however, defeated this proposal and kept Chamberlain's subsequent achievement in &#145;cultivating the undeveloped estates&#146; of the empire to modest proportions.<br>
<br>Chamberlain made arguably his most substantial contribution to the crown colonies by promoting research and education in the field of tropical medicine. Concern for education permeated Chamberlain's career in public life from its beginnings with the National Education League to the establishment of the University of Birmingham at the turn of the century. As colonial secretary he looked to education to address a problem that crippled imperial administration especially in tropical west Africa, where most men sent out from England were stricken with malaria before they could complete their assignments. He appointed Dr Patrick Manson, the best-known of the few experts in tropical medicine, to be the Colonial Office medical adviser. Chamberlain raised private as well as public money to found the London School of Tropical Medicine. He fostered the appointment of committees of British researchers to go to the tropics not only for on-site investigation but to make and execute policy. From the sanitary reforms he made as mayor of Birmingham to the transformation he brought about in the sanitation of the camps into which Boer women and children were herded during the South African War, even his opponents recognized that he knew how to deal effectively with public health. Before he left office he had made service in the tropical colonies a more attractive profession. One way and another, Chamberlain's administrative efforts as colonial secretary marked him out as the most outstanding holder of that formerly secondary office, while the importance of imperial issues at the turn of the century and his personal importance in the party politics of the day lifted his position to an eminence second only to the prime minister. Even his rivals treated him as the first minister of the empire.<br>
<br>Once the inquiry into the Jameson raid came to an end, Chamberlain invaded Salisbury's sanctuary at the Foreign Office by challenging his handling of the French in west Africa and his reluctance generally to seek an alliance with one of the other imperial powers. Salisbury had been dealing with the French over the Niger River in conciliatory fashion; he was anxious to save his diplomatic capital for a confrontation with them on the Nile. But Chamberlain insisted that Britain could not afford to diminish any of its colonial resources. To the embarrassment of the Foreign Office and its emissaries, he also demonstrated that the French would give way in face of stiffened British demands. His intransigent diplomacy, followed by the military activities of Frederick Lugard, extended the boundaries of what came to be known as Nigeria.<br>
<br>At the same time Chamberlain sought official recognition, and thus international confirmation, of the informal sway held by the British in the commerce of China, the market potential of which he was inclined to exaggerate. To this end he looked for some sort of alliance with the other industrial powers he admired, the United States and Germany. This co-operation would, he hoped, strengthen Britain more broadly in the imperial competition which prevailed among the great powers at the turn of the century. President Cleveland had provoked Chamberlain on the eve of the Jameson raid by asserting the interest of the United States in a boundary dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana. But Chamberlain welcomed the subsequent empire-building of the United States in the West Indies and the Pacific. Though his talk of an alliance disconcerted the Americans, Republicans responded appreciatively to his expressions of sympathy and willingness to co-operate in the imperial arena. But Germany rebuffed his repeated, often clumsy, overtures over China, and drove him ultimately towards the French.<br>
<br>Chamberlain was distracted from these efforts by the onset of a war which he did not seek, but from which he did not recoil, to uphold British suzerainty over the Boer republics in South Africa. But at the end of 1898, with little idea that in less than a year he would lead Britain to war, he was preoccupied with founding and funding the University of Birmingham. In order to enhance the distinction of Birmingham and serve its industrial needs, he transformed Mason College into a university by adding an emphasis on the classics and humanities to its curriculum in the sciences, while applying higher education directly to business by adding a new faculty of commerce, Britain's first. He stimulated funding for the university by soliciting large grants from two expatriate Britons who had done well in North American business, Andrew Carnegie and Lord Strathcona. Manoeuvred by Chamberlain, the two men increased their offers and also made them contingent on matching funds, which he duly raised from the less wealthy business and professional &eacute;lite of Birmingham. Chamberlain secured land for the new university from Lord Calthorpe, landlord of Edgbaston, the inner suburb of Birmingham beloved by its upper-middle class.<br>
<br>The Jameson raid had left Chamberlain more circumspect yet still erratic in his handling of South Africa. He remained ready to do what he could by rough means as well as fair to strengthen the imperial power there and resist the quest of President Kruger of the Transvaal for autonomy. Chamberlain's uncertainty about the right tactics to employ diminished his ability to control the man he sent out as high commissioner to South Africa, Alfred Milner, especially since they shared the same objective, to make Britain supreme in the region. Milner soon despaired of a peaceful solution to the conflict with Kruger and resolved to work up to war. Former colonial secretaries had often found themselves unable to control their distant emissaries, but there was no comparable excuse for Chamberlain's failure to make adequate military provision for a war the severity of which he occasionally foresaw.<br>
<br>Once the war broke out Chamberlain shrank from the role of war minister which was otherwise his for the taking&#151;and the war demonstrated a crying need for better military management. The war nevertheless raised him to new heights of eminence in the government. It was Chamberlain who pulled the government out of the slump into which it fell after three British armies were defeated in South Africa within one week in December 1899. It was he who determined the timing of the general election (October 1900), which was called early once the British seemed assured of military victory. Almost alone among the members of the cabinet, he then strode into the electoral fray. Crudely identifying the partisan appeal of the Unionist coalition with the fortunes of the imperial war&#151;&#145;Every seat lost to the Government was a seat gained by the Boers&#146;&#151;he renewed the victory of 1895.<br>
<br>The fortunes of the government and of its most prominent member did not advance in step with his achievement. Lord Salisbury reconstructed the ministry in ancestral fashion, promoting the members of its leading families, including Chamberlain's son Austen, but adding little fresh blood to its tired forces. Meanwhile the eruption of guerrilla warfare in South Africa eroded the moral force of the electoral mandate. Still, the war seemed to validate Chamberlain's imperialism, just as the election seemed to prove its popularity. Nothing was more remarkable than the willingness, even eagerness, with which the self-governing colonies of Canada, Australia, and above all little New Zealand contributed contingent upon contingent of troops to fight for the imperial cause far away at the foot of Africa. Arthur Balfour, Salisbury's nephew and presumed political heir, heralded Chamberlain at a special presentation to him in the Guildhall towards the end of the war as &#145;the man who, above all others, has made the British Empire a reality&#146;. Next day <span class="italic">The Times</span> (14 February 1902) greeted him as &#145;the most popular and trusted man in England&#146;.<br>
<br>But the war and its rewards for Chamberlain ended together. The heroic fight put up by the Boer guerrillas and the &#145;methods of barbarism&#146; employed by the British army to force them to make peace discredited Chamberlain's brand of imperialism. The war was scarcely concluded, at the end of May 1902, when Milner ruptured his relationship with Chamberlain by calling publicly for suspension of Cape Colony's popular constitution in defiance of Chamberlain's injunctions. The obvious costs of the war in blood and treasure exceeded its apparent dividends, especially after the mine owners of the Rand indentured Chinese labour to meet their needs. The ending of the war allowed a backlog of domestic measures to the fore; and the most pressing of them, for improved funding and governance of elementary education, revived the denominational controversy that divided Chamberlain and nonconformist Unionists from their Anglican Conservative allies. The war also brought the government up against the limits of its fiscal resources. Finally, the termination of the war allowed Lord Salisbury to retire; and his retirement left the government under an uneasy dual leadership, with Balfour as prime minister and Chamberlain as first minister of the empire. The deterioration in Chamberlain's position as a result of these accumulating set-backs was not immediately apparent. But they were compounded as well as symbolized by the gash he sustained to his forehead a few weeks after the war from a falling pane of glass in a cab accident (7 July 1902). Though lean and vigorous, he had long been prone under stress to gout and neuralgia. He shunned exercise as a diversion from work, and he had been working under unremitting pressure for seven years. But he did not complain of fatigue until after this accident. It occurred just when Salisbury retired and when Balfour abandoned the one concession Chamberlain had secured in the terms of the <span class="roman">Education Bill</span>. Chamberlain forced himself back to work against doctors' orders before he had fully recovered.<br>
<br>The political situation from Chamberlain's standpoint continued to deteriorate. Still enthralled by his imperial assignment, he did not move to the exchequer which was his to take when Sir Michael Hicks Beach decided to accompany Salisbury into retirement; thus Chamberlain lost his best opportunity to determine the fiscal policy of the government, which was soon to be vital to him. Thereafter he had as little influence over Balfour's reconstruction of the ministry as over Salisbury's a year and a half earlier. The returns from by-elections turned sharply against the government, for which Chamberlain blamed the <span class="roman">Education Bill</span>. All that he could salvage from an unproductive conference with the premiers of the self-governing colonies (June 1902) was an informal agreement with the Canadians to lower their tariff against British goods if Britain amended its wartime corn tax to favour the Canadians; and Chamberlain was not sure that he could secure cabinet approval for this small step towards imperial preference. Balfour encouraged his proposal to visit South Africa as the first in a projected series of personal missions overseas to draw the empire together. But Chamberlain's departure towards the end of the year weakened him at home, while few of the agreements which he patched up between the recently warring factions in South Africa survived his return to England. On his way home he learned that the chancellor of the exchequer, C. T. Ritchie, would resign and precipitate a major governmental crisis unless Chamberlain abandoned the slight modification in the corn tax to which he had tentatively agreed with the Canadians. Once Chamberlain reached England (March 1903) he acquiesced but with evident irritation, as he did also when the cabinet, on grounds of expense, rejected his plan to station a division of the British army permanently in South Africa.<h2>
<a name="Tariffreform"></a>Tariff reform</h2>Frustration, not mature reflection, prompted the call that Chamberlain issued in Birmingham in May 1903 for &#145;a treaty of preference and reciprocity&#146; with the colonies and for retaliatory tariffs against countries that threatened British imperial interests. His message nevertheless reflected deep-seated anxieties: about Britain's deteriorating industrial performance in comparison with the United States and Germany; about Britain's insecurity in the increasingly competitive world of the great political as well as economic powers; and, still, about the concern that first led him into public life, the social security of British industry unless it benefited labour as well as capital. He saw an opportunity to meet these concerns by cultivating the seed of imperial preference that Canada had sown. He elaborated his message rapidly under contradictory pressures: resistance in cabinet, but eager response from industrial and other Unionist interests. Industrially his message shifted towards protectionism, without abandoning insistence on the primary importance of imperial preference. The importance to the colonies of agricultural production, and particularly to Canada of its wheat exports, forced Chamberlain to demand that Britain place a tariff on its imports of foodstuffs, to be lowered preferentially in favour of those colonies that offered a comparable preference to British exports. He thus offended the most deeply rooted popular sentiments attached to free trade. But industrially his proposals were conservative. He focused his offer of protection on Britain's increasingly uncompetitive staple exports in metals and textiles rather than on technologically more advanced infant industries such as chemicals. In the social sphere he raised but then dropped the possibility of funding old-age pensions through tariffs and dwelt instead on the ability of tariffs to guarantee remunerative employment.<br>
<br>At the same time Chamberlain created a formidable organization outside the regular channels of the government to promote his message. He worked from two bases. The avowedly non-partisan Tariff Reform League was set up in London, combining the talents of press magnates with the wealth of industrialists to flood the country with propaganda. The Tariff Reform Committee was set up in affiliation with the Liberal Unionist Association of Birmingham. Under close supervision by Chamberlain through his family and close friends it proceeded to capture control of the Unionist electoral machinery nationally. His most original organizational initiative came towards the end of the year when, in almost royal fashion, he appointed leading figures from industry and former governmental service to a tariff reform commission to make concrete proposals for a tariff after close industry-by-industry inquiry.<br>
<br>In September 1903, tired of the constraints of cabinet government and encouraged by the seeming sympathy of Balfour, Chamberlain resigned from the ministry to launch a nationwide campaign from the platform. His campaign teetered on the verge of success by the turn of the year. But thereafter it compounded the electoral woes of the government. Tariff reform fragmented the Unionist alliance, much as home rule had split the Liberals. For another two years Chamberlain and Balfour paralysed each other. Each was unwilling to do what the other wished yet unable to do without him. Each was strong where the other was weak. While Chamberlain captured the organization of both parties to the Unionist alliance, Balfour outmanoeuvred him in parliament. Balfour performed brilliantly in foreign and military affairs, but Chamberlain kept the initiative in colonial policy.<br>
<br>Chamberlain finally forced Balfour to resign in December 1905, thus precipitating a general election, which was held in January 1906 and brought in a Liberal government. The Unionists were overwhelmed by the allied forces of Liberals and Labour everywhere but in Birmingham, where Chamberlain and his men reversed the tide, increasing their already enormous majorities. The size of the majority the Liberals won in the new House of Commons destroyed Chamberlain's hopes of keeping their return to power brief. Still he fought back, struggling at least to commit the Unionist opposition to tariff reform.<br>
<br>To that end a protracted celebration of Chamberlain's seventieth birthday, which coincided with the thirtieth anniversary of his election to parliament, was conducted in Birmingham at the beginning of July. Over the past year Chamberlain had blacked out briefly two or three times under the strain of public speaking, and he sensed that the address he gave on this occasion could be his last. It was a true valediction. In contrast to the Manchester school, with its devotion to minimal government and free trade, he praised what he proclaimed as &#145;the Birmingham school&#146; for its readiness to use the powers of the state to promote the welfare of the country and to strengthen the empire. Tariff reform as he presented it served both these ends. It would &#145;secure for the masses of the industrial population in this country constant employment at fair wages&#146;, and it would advance the power and prosperity of industrial England. &#145;England without an empire&#146;, he said scornfully, &#145;would be a fifth-rate nation, existing on the sufferance of its more powerful neighbours&#146;  (<span class="italic">Birmingham Daily Post</span>, 10 July 1906).<br>
<br>Chamberlain hastened afterwards to London to pursue his campaign, and there he suffered a stroke. It paralysed his right side, including his writing hand, and it muffled his voice. His active political life was over, though his family tried to disguise the fact for nearly a year while Mary struggled to secure a recovery. He survived for a further seven years, intervening when he was able through dictated letters and awkward conversation to keep Unionists faithful to tariff reform and opposed to home rule. He remained influential because no one else on the Unionist side matched his strength of conviction and his remembered force of personality. But in 1913 Balfour's successor as party leader, Bonar Law, virtually abandoned the Unionist commitment to food taxes and, with them, to imperial preference.<br>
<br>A year later Chamberlain, who had been re-elected in the two general elections of 1910, announced his intention to retire from the House of Commons at the next election. In mid-June he bid farewell to his faithful constituents, who saw him for the first time since his stroke being pushed along the footpaths of Highbury in a bath chair. He left Birmingham afterwards and returned to London, where he died at his home, 40 Princes Gardens, on 2 July 1914. Word of his death was overshadowed by the news of the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand at Sarajevo.<br>
<br>Governed by Chamberlain's wishes, his family declined burial in Westminster Abbey. His funeral was conducted with stark simplicity in Birmingham. He was buried on 6 July in a civic cemetery, Key Hill, in the heart of his West Birmingham constituency, not far from the factory where he had made his fortune, in a ground vault with his first two wives, surrounded by the graves of the industrialists and civic leaders among whom he had been chief. He left an estate valued at just over &pound;125,000, reduced by his abandonment of business for politics but not out of line with the estates left by his brothers who had remained in business. He also left a political progeny: his only son by his first marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32351/', "(Joseph) Austen Chamberlain (1863&#150;1937)")</script>, foreign secretary; and his only son by his second marriage, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32347/', "(Arthur) Neville Chamberlain (1869&#150;1940)")</script>, prime minister.<br>
<br>By 1914 Unionists had already given up one cause Joseph Chamberlain held dear. By the end of the summer they gave up another when they conceded home rule for Ireland. Only Birmingham remained true to his prescriptions in civic and national affairs for another thirty years. But his vision of empire continued to inspire Unionists at large, and his administrative policies at the Colonial Office were pursued by Labour as well into the mid-twentieth century. His willingness to use the powers of the state for domestic economic and social purposes has won more admirers among his political opponents than within his own party.<br>
