<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Rothschild, Dame  Miriam Louisa</span>  (1908&#150;2005), <span class="occ">naturalist, entomologist, and conservationist</span>, was born on 5 August 1908 at Ashton Wold, Ashton, near Oundle, Northamptonshire, the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76005/', "(Nathaniel) Charles Rothschild (1877&#150;1923)")</script>, merchant, banker, and conservationist, and his wife, Rozsika (1870&#150;1940), third daughter of Colonel Alfred von Wertheimstein, a landowner and army officer from Nagyv&aacute;rad, Austria&#150;Hungary. Her three siblings included the zoologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40176/', "Victor Rothschild")</script> and the musical patron <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101125/', "Nica de Koenigswarter")</script>. Miriam was taught at home by her father (who disapproved of examinations), and by governesses. Her father was immensely keen on natural history, and from an early age she helped him with his butterfly collecting. He was among the first to realize how important it is to preserve the habitat if a species is to survive. He founded the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves in 1912, and, after contacting the secretaries of all known natural history societies in England and Wales, in 1915 issued a list of sites worthy of protection. He was an expert on fleas and travelled widely, collecting specimens. He was the first to describe <i>Xenopsylla cheopsis</i>, later found to be the vector for bubonic plague. After the First World War he contracted a type of influenza, encephalitis lethargica, which left him with frequent attacks of severe depression. In the midst of one of these, he committed suicide. Miriam was only fifteen at the time. His work on setting up nature reserves had been making good progress, but when he died the impetus went. Miriam Rothschild later, in 1946, wrote a leader article in <span class="italic">Nature</span>, pointing out that of her father's list of 174 sites worthy of protection in England, only 150 had been re-selected by the Nature Reserves Investigation Committee in 1945. Later still she published <span class="italic">Rothschild's Reserves</span> (1997), co-written with Peter Marren.<br>
<br>Another important influence was her uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35843/', "Lionel Walter Rothschild, second Baron Rothschild")</script>. The family frequently stayed at Tring Park, in Hertfordshire, where he had set up a natural history museum. He organized the collection worldwide of a range of animals. The museum had a vast collection of preserved animals. <span class="italic">Novitates Zoologicae</span>, the museum's journal, was published from 1894 to 1939. Miriam Rothschild was a co-editor for the last three years. She learnt a great deal from her uncle, and published <span class="italic">Dear Lord Rothschild</span> (1983) in his memory.<br>
<br>Rothschild initially thought of being a writer, and attended classes in literature at Bedford College, University of London. She soon decided, however, that she wanted to be a zoologist, and enrolled for evening classes in biology at Chelsea Polytechnic. At Whitsun 1931 her group went to the Marine Biological Association laboratories in Plymouth. When she was dissecting <i>Nucula</i>, a bivalve mollusc, she found the larval stage of a trematode flatworm that her tutor, Marie Lebour, had not seen before. As a consequence Rothschild decided to undertake research on trematodes. Her research centred on the parasites of <i>Hydrobia ulvae</i>, a gastropod snail abundant on tidal mud and salt marshes. From 1932 to 1935 she examined over 2700 specimens. Besides detailed observations of the behaviour and morphology of the parasites, she worked out their life cycles, partly by studying the local bird population. Her research was done mainly at Plymouth, but she also worked at the zoological station in Naples, where she was awarded a place at the London University research table.<br>
<br>In the late 1930s Miriam Rothschild worked with several organizations dedicated to helping Jewish children escape from Germany and Austria. Many of the children were given a safe refuge at Ashton Wold. When the Second World War broke out in September 1939 scientists were in reserved occupations so could continue with their research. In 1940 the Marine Laboratory in Plymouth was bombed and the main casualties were the aquarium and Rothschild's laboratory. Her jars of specimens, slides, and notebooks&#151;seven years' work&#151;were damaged or destroyed. She had already applied for a position with the War Office, so after three days she left Plymouth. She subsequently worked as a code-breaker at Bletchley, using her knowledge of German. Meanwhile her home in Ashton was used by the Red Cross as a convalescent hospital for military personnel. Among those billeted there was Captain George Lane, formerly Lanyi (1915&#150;2010), a Hungarian-born but naturalized British writer and journalist. When war was declared he joined the British army and won the MC for his bravery. He and Miriam Rothschild were married on 14 August 1943. They had two daughters, (Mary) Rozsika (1945&#150;2010) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/103123/', "Parker, (Mary) Rozsika")</script>], later an art historian, and Charlotte (<i>b</i>. 1951), and a son, Charles (<i>b</i>. 1948), and they also adopted at birth another daughter, Johanna (<i>b</i>. 1951). They separated in 1954 and were divorced in 1957. Miriam Rothschild also adopted the two children, Jane and Benjamin, of her friend Gay Fischer, following the latter's death in 1955.<br>
<br>After the war Rothschild managed the farm at Ashton. She was concerned for the welfare of the farmworkers and introduced tractors with cabs before this was a legal requirement. She was also concerned about the unnecessary suffering of farm animals. Many of her ideas for improving the wellbeing of animals were later accepted. She was increasingly interested in conservation and realized that there were relatively few different species of wildflowers. She decided to convert her lawns into wildflower meadows, and successfully managed some of her hay meadows so that they produced marketable quantities of wildflower seeds. One mixture she developed was called &#145;farmer's nightmare&#146;. She arranged for many roadside verges to be sown with wildflowers and gave packets of seeds to local schools. In 1952 the family moved to Elsfield Manor, near Oxford, for the sake of the children's education, though Miriam Rothschild was still responsible for the farm and the estate at Ashton Wold (and moved back there permanently in 1970). The move to Oxford enabled her to embark on her research on aposematic insects, especially butterflies and moths. These are insects with warning colourations or markings to repel or warn predators. She pioneered research in ecological biochemistry. She showed that several insects can sequestrate and store cardiac glycosides, such as digitalin, from their food plants. Ragwort, <i>Senecio jacobaea</i>, contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids which harm cattle. Caterpillars of the cinnabar moth, <i>Tyria jacobaeae</i>, feed on ragwort and sequestrate and store the alkaloids. Their conspicuous colouring warns predators. With a range of laboratory experiments and field observations, starting in 1958, Rothschild and her collaborators published numerous papers in the field of chemical ecology. J. B. Harborne, in his preface to <span class="italic">Introduction to Ecological Biochemistry</span> (4th edn, 1993), wrote that &#145;by her own pioneering experiments with aposematic insects and equally her encouragements of other scientists&#146; Rothschild had &#145;contributed more than anyone else to this new subject&#146;.<br>
<br>Rothschild retained her interest in fleas throughout her life. In the early 1950s she decided to catalogue the vast collection of fleas that her father had given to the Natural History Museum. Working with G. H. E. Hopkins she published, in six volumes, <span class="italic">An Illustrated Catalogue of the Rothschild Collection of Fleas (Siphonaptera) in the British Museum (Natural History)</span> (1953&#150;1983). With Theresa Clay she published <span class="italic">Fleas, Flukes, and Cuckoos: a Study of Bird Parasites</span> (1952), a volume in the <span class="roman">Collins New Naturalist</span> series. This was thoroughly researched and entertaining. In the early 1960s, when myxomatosis spread among the rabbit population in Britain, Rothschild thought that the disease was spread by fleas, rather than by mosquitoes as in Australia. She followed this up, and found that the reproductive cycle of the rabbit flea was linked to hormones from the newly born rabbits. This was the first example of the reproductive cycle of a parasitic insect being controlled by the reproductive cycle of the host. With her co-researchers she investigated the jumping mechanism of a flea, discovered the chemical involved in the flea's leap, and worked out the mechanism involved. She demonstrated this at the Royal Society on 10 May 1973. Later still, in collaboration with Yosef Schlein and Susumo Ho, she published <span class="italic">A Colour Atlas of Insect Tissues via the Flea</span> (1986). This included 200 of her photographs of flea tissues.<br>
<br>From her first publication in 1932 to her last in 2005 Rothschild had over 300 publications to her name, ranging from first-class scientific research to entertaining articles about her pets. She believed that art, literature, and natural history were linked, and <span class="italic">Butterfly Cooing Like a Dove</span> (1991) was a pioneering attempt to combine her observations and experience as a biologist with paintings and quotations from literature, mainly of butterflies and birds. She was always aware that she was part of the Rothschild dynasty and wrote about the family history, especially the women members, and about the Rothschild gardens. Latterly she wrote several introductions for books on subjects she was interested in.<br>
<br>Rothschild was the first woman to be a trustee of the British Museum (Natural History), a position she held from 1967 to 1974. She was visiting professor at the Royal Free Hospital, London, where she lectured to first-year medical students. She was the first woman to be president of the Royal Entomological Society and was one of the eight members of the Entomological Club, founded in 1826. She served on the councils, or as vice-president or patron, of several scientific societies, for example the British Dragonfly Society. In 1996 she opened on her estate the first dragonfly museum in Britain. In 1985 she was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Her brother Victor was already a fellow, making them the first brother and sister to be fellows. She was awarded eight honorary degrees, by Oxford, Cambridge, and the Open University among others. She was appointed CBE in 1982 and DBE in 2000. She received many other awards in the various fields in which she worked, including the Victoria medal of honour of the Royal Horticultural Society (1991) and the Wigglesworth gold medal of the Royal Entomological Society (1982). She often helped with unpopular causes, and set up the Schizophrenia Research Fund in 1962 as her sister Elizabeth had had the condition. She was also involved in 1963 with the Wolfenden report, which looked at the legal situation regarding homosexuality.<br>
<br>Miriam Rothschild, who was a vegetarian, had a very strong empathy with her pets and with the wild animals she befriended. (Princess Alice, duchess of Gloucester, when invited to lunch was startled to find a tame fox sitting on the chair next to her.) She was very hospitable and cared about her employees on the Ashton estate. She believed in thanking everyone who helped her, whether in a minor or major capacity, and was a great encourager. Even in her nineties she had an excellent memory and worked immensely hard. She died on 20 January 2005 at her home (and birthplace), Ashton Wold, Northamptonshire, from heart failure. A private funeral took place on 21 January. A memorial service was held on 7 April 2005 at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue, St John's Wood, London. She was survived by a son and three daughters, two children having predeceased her. With funding from the Lisbet Rausing Charitable Trust, a Miriam Rothschild chair of conservation biology was endowed at the University of Cambridge in 2006.<br>
