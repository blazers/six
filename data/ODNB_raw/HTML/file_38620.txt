<span class="headword">Weston,  Jessie Laidlay</span>  (1850&#150;1928), <span class="occ">Arthurian scholar</span>, was born on 28 December 1850 in New Park, Clapham, Surrey, the eldest of the three daughters of William Weston (<i>d</i>. 1887), tea broker and member of the Salters' Company, and his second wife, Sarah Burton (<i>d</i>. 1856). Following his second wife's death when his daughters were still young children, William Weston married Clara King with whom he had five children. Jessie Weston's early education was at a school in Brighton, the family's home town. Later she studied music in Germany at the Hildesheim conservatory, a setting which inspired her long narrative poem &#145;The Rose Tree of Hildesheim&#146; and provided the title for her first collection of verse (1896). She also took classes at the Crystal Palace School of Art in London. However, the most important intellectual influence of her youth was Gaston Paris, the French medieval scholar with whom she studied in Paris.<br>
<br>Despite having spent much of the initial forty years of her life being engaged in increasingly serious scholarship, Jessie Weston wrote nothing for publication until after her father's death in 1887. Her first book, a verse translation of Wolfram von Eschenbach's <span class="italic">Parzival</span>, was published in 1894 when she was forty-three. Like many of her contemporaries she had become an ardent Wagner enthusiast, having first encountered his music as a student in Hildesheim. Bayreuth was developing into a gathering-place, not only for Wagnerites but for medievalists from all over Europe. Weston was attracted to Wagner's music mainly because of his use of medieval heroic narratives. After having attended a performance of <span class="italic">Parsifal</span> at the 1892 Bayreuth festival with the publisher Alfred Nutt, she deplored the fact that the English public knew so little of the sources on which Wagner's operas were based. With Nutt's encouragement she embarked on a 2400-line annotated verse translation of <span class="italic">Parzival</span> which she dedicated to the memory of Wagner, &#145;whose genius has given fresh life to the creation of medieval romance&#146;  (Hyman, 509). This work opened the way to further retelling of stories from Wagner and to a collaboration with Nutt which lasted until his death by accidental drowning in 1910.<br>
<br>In the years before he began collaborating with Jessie Weston, Nutt had already been working as an independent scholar. He had been one of the founder members of the Folk-Lore Society in 1878 and became publisher of the society's journal, <span class="italic">Folk-Lore</span>, in 1890. European scholars had tended to regard the twelfth-century French poet Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes as the originator of Arthurian romance, but the comparative method involved in the study of folklore was leading Nutt to become interested in the Celtic origins of Arthurian material. Jessie Weston's studies of Arthurian texts led her to side with Nutt and other Celticists against the continental or inventionist school which saw Arthurian romance as deriving from the &#145;inventive genius&#146; of Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes. While Weston took issue with the German scholars of the inventionist school, she also diverged from Celticists such as Nutt who argued that the grail legends sprang from Irish sources. She argued for their Welsh provenance and postulated that they originated with a Welsh story-teller, Bleheris, cited by Giraldus Cambrensis, and who predated Chr&eacute;tien. Her early publications also attempted to reconfigure the existing hierarchy of Arthurian heroes. Her first publication in Nutt's <span class="roman">Grimm Library</span> series in 1897, <span class="italic">The Legend of Sir Gawain</span>, attempts to re-establish Gawain rather than Perceval as the pre-eminent Arthurian hero and to restore his reputation from the damage done by Sir Thomas Malory's treatment which had been reiterated to English nineteenth-century readers by Tennyson in his <span class="italic">Idylls of the King</span>.<br>
<br>Weston's participation in the controversies about the origins of Arthurian texts led her to a preoccupation with the significance of the grail legends. The interpretation of the grail as the central object of Christian ritual was irreconcilable with the argument that the legends surrounding it predated Christianity. Like many of her generation she was influenced by Sir James Frazer's <span class="italic">The Golden Bough</span> (1890), which explored the recurrence of themes of sacrifice, death, and rebirth throughout different religious practices and beliefs and traced these themes to ancient rituals. In her most popular work on the subject, <span class="italic">From Ritual to Romance</span> (1920), she expresses her indebtedness to Frazer for &#145;the initial inspiration&#146; which set her &#145;on the road to the Grail castle&#146;  (p. vii), appropriately acknowledging the extent of Frazer's influence. However, the notion of Arthur as the personification of a vegetation god had surfaced as early as 1842 in the German scholar Karl Simrock's book <span class="italic">Parzival und Titurel</span>. Weston first began to formulate her own theory in a paper, &#145;The grail and the rites of Adonis&#146;, which she had delivered to the Folk-Lore Society in 1906 and published the following year in <span class="italic">Folk-Lore</span>.<br>
<br>Weston's views increasingly led her into disputes with A. E. Waite, especially after the publication of <span class="italic">The Legend of Sir Perceval</span> in 1906 which emphasized her view of the grail story as deriving from pre-Christian Celtic ritual. Waite, an acknowledged authority on the cabbala, the tarot, and other forms of esoteric knowledge who had broken away both from theosophy and from the order of the Golden Dawn to form his own group based on Christian mysticism, ardently supported the view that the grail legends were Christian in origin. Waite also saw Galahad as the most significant hero of grail literature, whereas Weston believed that grail stories focusing on Galahad were very late developments in grail literature when the grail stories had been &#145;finally remodelled on the lines of Christian mysticism&#146;  (J. L. Weston, &#145;The quest of the Holy Grail&#146;, <span class="italic">The Quest</span>, 1, 1910, 526). Waite's intemperate and personal attacks on her became increasingly vehement after her death.<br>
<br>Weston's belief that the grail legends represented the written survival of ancient ritual which had later passed into occult practices&#151;&#145;the confused record of a ritual, once popular, later surviving under conditions of strict secrecy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ritual</span>, 1920, 4)&#151;found its most widely read expression in <span class="italic">From Ritual to Romance</span>. By 1920 other scholars such as Jane Harrison and Gilbert Murray, who had also been influenced by Frazer, had played a role in generating public interest in an anthropological approach to comparative religion, and English-speaking readers were also still fascinated with Arthurian lore through the many Victorian popularizations; an audience was ready for the book. While <span class="italic">From Ritual to Romance</span> can be seen as Weston's final word on grail legends, it differs from her other works in its lack of scholarly apparatus and its odd references to an unnamed informant who was supposedly an initiate of occult rituals. Despite these inconsistencies, it was widely known and influential, particularly after T. S. Eliot, in his notes to <span class="italic">The Waste Land</span> (1922), acknowledged his debt to her explication of grail legends and the role of the Fisher King.<br>
<br>Weston's belief that German Arthurian scholars were seriously mistaken became more confirmed as her career developed. By 1901 she felt able to declare in her book on Lancelot that German scholars were &#145;radically unsound&#146; and that her reading of their work had shaken her &#145;belief in the soundness and reliability of foreign criticism of the Arthurian cycle&#146;  (Hyman, 511). This rejection of German scholarship reflected a trend which was occurring in many other scholarly fields where previously unassailable German authority was now being challenged or dismissed. During the First World War her critique of German intellectuals took on political significance when she produced a pamphlet to combat what she saw as the &#145;undue value&#146; placed on German research findings and charging that German literature could make little claim to cultural uniqueness because so much of it derived from French models. Another pamphlet, <span class="italic">Germany's Crime Against France</span> (1915), more explicitly polemical, denounced German war atrocities.<br>
<br>For much of her life as an active scholar Weston lived in a fashionable district of Paris, travelling frequently to England to keep up her contacts with British folkloric circles and with such groups as the Quest Society. As did many intellectual and professional women of the period, she maintained a membership at the Lyceum, a club which she had helped found in 1904. In the last years of her life she began to find Paris less congenial and in 1923 returned to England to take up residence in a London flat at 85 Biddulph Mansions, Elgin Avenue, Maida Vale.<br>
<br>Despite failing health, Weston's enthusiasm for controversy remained undimmed in her final years. She wrote an article for publication in <span class="italic">The Quest</span> attacking the <span class="italic">Church Times</span> and deploring the way in which she saw the Church of England tending towards an alliance with Catholicism. The more Christocentric approach, with a focus on &#145;the great Drama of the Passion&#146; which cast Jews as the villain and a neglect of the <span class="roman">Old Testment</span>, inevitably led, she warned, to a chronic antisemitism. The editors of <span class="italic">The Quest</span> did not apparently agree or else found her attack on Anglo-Catholicism too controversial and the article remained unpublished.<br>
<br>Jessie Weston's career is a remarkable one for more than her appetite for controversy. Less than ten years after the publication of her first book she had succeeded in establishing herself as an authoritative translator and interpreter of medieval texts and was soon recognized as the leading English Arthurian scholar. Despite the fact that she published nothing until she was over forty, she was the author of more than twenty books and numerous articles as well as a volume of verse and one of short stories set in the medieval period. The standard reference works of her time, the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> and the <span class="italic">Cambridge Medieval History</span>, commissioned her to write articles on Arthurian material, thus lending weight to her sometimes disputatious views. Formal institutional recognition was bestowed somewhat more slowly. In 1920 the British Academy awarded her the Rose Mary Crawshay prize of &pound;100&#151;a sum which she invested in cataract surgery. In 1923 the University of Wales awarded her the honorary degree of doctor of letters. At the awarding ceremony Mary Williams, a professor of French literature whose own work had been influenced by Weston, described her mentor's research as being &#145;prosecuted with that patience, zeal and love of the truth which are characteristic of the great scholar&#146;  (Grayson, 43). Weston died, unmarried, on 29 September 1928 at Warrington Lodge, Warrington Crescent, Maida Vale, London.<br>
