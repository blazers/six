<span class="headword">Stanley, Sir  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1435&#150;1495), <span class="occ">administrator and landowner</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26278/', "Thomas Stanley, first Baron Stanley (1406&#150;1459)")</script>, and Joan, daughter of Sir Robert Goushill and his wife, Elizabeth Fitzalan, dowager duchess of Norfolk. He was probably born about 1435, that is, some two years after his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26279/', "Thomas Stanley, second Lord Stanley")</script>. He grew to manhood in the increasingly bitter factional politics of the 1450s, in which his father had balanced his early involvement with the Suffolk regime by collaboration with the duke of York and the Nevilles. In 1459 Richard Neville, earl of Salisbury, crossing from Yorkshire to join with York at Ludlow, sought support from the Stanleys against the Lancastrian regime. While his elder brother, Thomas, refused to commit his troops, William joined Salisbury's standard, took part in the action at Bloreheath (23 September), and probably fled overseas with the Yorkist leaders. In the Coventry parliament in November Thomas begged the king's pardon, but William was attainted as a traitor.<br>
<br>William Stanley's prospects were wholly transformed by the accession of Edward IV in 1461. On 1 May he was appointed chamberlain of Chester, constable of Flint Castle, and sheriff of Flintshire, offices that he was to hold for some thirty-five years. He was knighted in July, and through summer and autumn he was prominent in the establishment of Yorkist rule in north Wales. In the following years he assisted in the suppression of the Lancastrians in the north, participating in the siege of Alnwick (1462) with 400 archers. After the battle of Hexham (1464) he was rewarded with a grant of the lordship of Skipton, Yorkshire, and other lands forfeited by John, Lord Clifford (<i>d</i>. 1461). In 1465 he married Joan Beaumont, widow of John, Lord Lovell, securing the custody of the Lovell lordship of Longdendale in Cheshire. Despite his connections with the Neville clan, William Stanley did not follow the earl of Warwick when he turned against Edward IV and drove him from the kingdom in 1470&#150;71. On Edward's return from exile in 1471, he was among the first to declare himself for the house of York, meeting him at Nottingham with 300 men. Joan Stanley having died in August 1466, her husband's credit at court was presumably instrumental in securing, by the end of the year, Elizabeth Hopton, widow of John Tiptoft, earl of Worcester (<i>d</i>. 1470), as his second wife.<br>
<br>In the 1470s William Stanley was a pillar of the Yorkist regime. When Edward's eldest son became prince of Wales and earl of Chester, he was appointed steward of the prince's household. His position at court, the offices he held in Cheshire and Flintshire, and his activities as a patron and arbiter of disputes helped him to secure a powerful following among the gentry of the region. His ambition was to build up a territorial lordship which would extend the Stanley domination of Lancashire and Cheshire into north Wales. Local power and influence secured a foothold in the lordship of Bromfield and Yale, where he was acting in the capacity of steward from about 1467 and was probably already in residence at Holt Castle. He and his brother successfully resisted efforts by Richard, duke of Gloucester, to extend his power into Lancashire. Indeed, in 1475 William obtained from the duke the lordship of Chirk, immediately south of Bromfield and Yale, in exchange for that of Skipton. In the same year he led a retinue of two lances and twenty archers in Edward IV's expedition to France.<br>
<br>In 1483 the Stanleys reluctantly acquiesced in the usurpation of Richard III. At the time of the duke of Buckingham's rebellion in October of that year they were with the king in the north, and had little room for manoeuvre. In any event they joined in the suppression of the revolt, and shared in the spoils of victory. William Stanley succeeded Buckingham as chief justice of north Wales, and was granted his lordship of Thornbury in Gloucestershire. In 1484 he finally acquired from the crown the castle of Holt and the lordship of Bromfield and Yale, partly by purchase and partly in exchange for the surrender of Thornbury.<br>
<br>None the less the Stanleys played a pivotal role in the overthrow of Richard III and the accession of Henry Tudor in 1485. Lord Stanley was the stepfather of the Lancastrian pretender, but Sir William may well have been motivated primarily by loyalty to Henry Tudor's proposed bride, Elizabeth of York, eldest daughter and (assuming the deaths of the princes in the Tower) heir of Edward IV. While only the ballad tradition, especially <span class="italic">Bosworth Field</span> and the <span class="italic">Song of Lady Bessy</span>, offers detail, it seems clear that the Stanleys made undertakings to Henry Tudor before his invasion in 1485. After landing with a small force in south-west Wales, he headed north and then east, evidently relying on assistance from the Stanleys. According to the <span class="italic">Song of Lady Bessy</span>, Sir William was stationed at Holt Castle, waiting for the south-westerly wind that would signal the invasion.<br>
<br>On receipt of news of the rebels' advance through Wales William Stanley sent a message to the town of Shrewsbury ordering their admission, and, in co-ordination with Lord Stanley who was advancing in force from Lancashire, he set out at the head of a company about 3000 men strong, attired according to the ballads in red-and-white jackets bearing his insignia of the hart's head. While the Stanleys declined to declare themselves openly until the last moment, Sir William is presented in the ballads as actively assisting the rebels from the outset, meeting with Henry near Stone and at Lichfield, and covering his advance through Staffordshire. At the battle of Bosworth (22 August) it was Sir William who at a critical stage committed his forces against Richard III. Polydore Vergil has William Stanley saving Henry's life, the great chronicle of London has him crowning Henry VII on the battlefield, and an early tradition has him being granted the spoils of the field by the grateful victor.<br>
<br>On the accession of Henry VII Sir William Stanley was appointed chamberlain of the king's household. He was loyal to the regime during the Lambert Simnel conspiracy of 1487, and he raised a large company in 1489 to assist the king in the suppression of a rising in Yorkshire. He was well rewarded for his support, but seemed to Polydore Vergil &#145;more mindful of the favours he had given than of those he had received&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>, 77). He was reputedly the richest commoner in England. Common fame had it that he enjoyed a yearly income from land and office of &pound;3000, and had treasure worth 400,000 marks. He may indeed have been disappointed in not being raised to the peerage like his brother, who was rewarded in 1485 with the title of earl of Derby. None the less his arrest, trial, and execution for treason early in 1495, following the earlier arrest of other household men involved in treasonable correspondence with the pretender Perkin Warbeck, shocked contemporaries as a most spectacular fall from grace.<br>
<br>The charge was that on 14 March 1493 William Stanley discussed with Robert Clifford the claims of Perkin Warbeck to be Richard, younger son of Edward IV, and sent Clifford to Brabant to enter his service and give assurances of support. According to Vergil, Sir William had declared that if Warbeck was indeed the son of Edward IV &#145;he would never take arms against him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>, 75). The chief witness was Clifford himself, now turned king's evidence, and it is tempting to suspect that the charges were to some degree manufactured. Henry VII certainly enriched himself and restored discipline in his household by destroying the over-mighty chamberlain. None the less the charge has plausibility. Sir William had demonstrated conspicuous loyalty to Edward IV, and it is significant that the alleged mission to Warbeck followed on news of his reception as her nephew by Margaret of York, duchess of Burgundy. His correspondence with the pretender may have been prompted by considerations of honour as much as by calculation of advantage.<br>
<br>At his trial Stanley confessed the treason, but apparently bore himself very haughtily. He may well have believed that his treason was relatively minor, a past indiscretion rather than a current conspiracy. Polydore Vergil's view that Stanley's sentiments indicated &#145;lukewarmness to King Henry rather than treason&#146;  (<span class="italic">Anglica historia</span>, 75) may have been widely shared, but is somewhat na&iuml;ve. On 6&#150;7 February, in a trial at which his brother presided as constable of England, he was found guilty of treason and condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. It seems that the king relented to the degree that he was simply beheaded at Tower Hill on the 16th. His lands and goods were seized into the king's hands. Bromfield and Yale, and other lordships confiscated from Stanley, were worth 1000 marks per annum to the crown in 1500. An inventory drawn up at Holt Castle after his death records some &pound;9000 in money and jewels. He was buried at Syon Abbey, Middlesex, with the costs of the burial at the king's charge.<br>
