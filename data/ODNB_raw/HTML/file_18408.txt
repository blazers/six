<span class="headword">Maxwell, Sir  Murray</span>  (1775&#150;1831), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, the third son of James Maxwell (<i>b</i>. 1724), a captain in the 42nd regiment (himself the third son of Sir Alexander Maxwell of Monreith, Wigtownshire, second baronet) and his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of William Maxwell of Ardwell, was born in the parish of Penninghame, near Newton Stewart, Wigtownshire, Scotland, on 10 September 1775. On 10 September 1790 he entered the navy on the <i>Juno</i>, with Captain Samuel Hood, where he served until March 1794, when he followed Hood to the <i>Aigle</i>. In November 1794 he was moved to the <i>Nemesis</i>, and was still with her when she was captured at Smyrna on 9 December 1795. He afterwards joined the <i>Blenheim</i>, and a few months later the <i>Princess Royal</i>, on which he returned to England. On 10 October 1796 he was promoted lieutenant. He married on 9 September 1798 Grace Callander (<i>d</i>. 23 June 1857), the daughter of Colonel Waugh of the 57th regiment; they had one daughter and one son, John Balfour (1799&#150;1874), who died an admiral on the retired list.<br>
<br>On 15 December 1802 Maxwell was promoted commander of the sloop <i>Cyane</i> in the West Indies, with which he was present at the reduction of St Lucia. He was then appointed by Hood acting captain of the <i>Centaur</i> (74 guns), bearing his broad pennant. He had thus an important part in the capture of Tobago, Demerara, and Essequibo in July and September 1803, and of Berbice and Surinam in April 1804. His commission as captain was confirmed to 4 August 1803. In 1805 he commanded the <i>Galatea</i> in the West Indies, and in 1807 was appointed to the <i>Alceste</i>, a 38-gun frigate, with which from 1807 to 1810 he served with distinction in the Mediterranean, attacking coastal forts and convoys and, in April 1808, with two brigs, a flotilla of gunboats.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1811 Maxwell was in the Adriatic under the orders of Captain James Brisbane, and in the autumn had for some months a semi-independent command there. On 29 November, off Lissa, his force&#151;<i>Alceste</i>, <i>Unit&eacute;</i>, and <i>Active</i> [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11054/', "Gordon, Sir James Alexander")</script>]&#151;fought three French frigates, capturing two (one was the <i>Pomone</i>).<br>
<br>In 1812 Maxwell was appointed to the <i>Daedalus</i> (38 guns), with which he sailed for India in charge of a fleet of Indiamen. On 2 July 1813 the <i>Daedalus</i> was wrecked off the coast of Ceylon. Maxwell returned to England, and, being acquitted of blame, was made a CB in 1815.<br>
<br>In October 1813 Maxwell was again appointed to the <i>Alceste</i>, at the desire of Lord Amherst, going out as ambassador to the emperor of China. The <i>Alceste</i> sailed from Spithead on 9 February 1816 and anchored off the Peiho (Beihe) on 28 July. Lord Amherst landed on 9 August and directed the ship to meet him at Canton (Guangzhou), whither he proposed to travel overland from Peking (Beijing). Maxwell took the opportunity of exploring the Gulf of Pecheli (Beizhili), the west coast of Korea&#151;until then unknown except by hearsay, and drawn on the chart by imagination&#151; and the Loo-Choo Islands. The results were afterwards ably described by Captain Basil Hall of the brig <i>Lyra</i>, then in company with the <i>Alceste</i>, in his <span class="italic">Account of a Voyage of Discovery to the Western Coast of Corea and the Great Loo-Choo Island</span> (1818). The <i>Alceste</i> arrived off the mouth of the Canton River on 2 November, and Maxwell, unable to get any satisfactory answer to his application for a pass, determined to go up the river without one. As he approached the Bocca Tigris, a mandarin came on board and ordered him to anchor at once; if he attempted to go on, the batteries would sink the ship. Maxwell sent back an angry answer, and the <i>Alceste</i> passed on, scattering the war junks which attempted to stop her, and silencing the batteries for the time by a single well-directed broadside. Without further molestation she arrived at Whampoa (Huangpu), where Lord Amherst re-embarked on 21 January 1817. The <i>Lyra</i> was sent to Calcutta with dispatches for the governor-general, and the <i>Alceste</i>, continuing her voyage by herself, entered the Strait of Gaspar on the morning of 18 February.<br>
<br>These straits were then little more than explored, and the charts were very imperfect. About eight o'clock the ship struck on a rock about 3 miles from Pulo Leat and sustained fatal injuries. Everyone was landed on the island, together with such stores as time permitted, but on the third day the wreck was taken possession of by Malay pirates, who threatened the encampment on shore. On the morning of 19 February Lord Amherst and his staff had been sent on to Batavia in two boats under the command of Lieutenant Henry Parkyns Hoppner, a son of John Hoppner the artist. Some 200 men remained on this inhospitable island, without clothes, with little food, and beset by ferocious enemies. They were relieved on 3 March by the arrival of the East India Company's ship <i>Ternate</i>, sent by Amherst from Batavia. On his arrival in England in August 1817 Maxwell was tried by court martial, fully acquitted, and specially complimented for his conduct before and after the wreck. Lord Amherst appeared as a witness on his behalf. On 27 May 1818 Maxwell was knighted. He was elected FRS on 18 February 1819, and on 20 May 1819 was presented by the East India Company with &pound;1500 for his services to the embassy and in compensation for his losses in the wreck. In the July 1818 general election Maxwell was the last Admiralty (ministerial) candidate for the mass-electorate City of Westminster. He &#145;sustained severe personal injury from the vile rabble with which the hustings in Covent Garden is on such occasions surrounded&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 274) and was unsuccessful, defeated by Sir Samuel Romilly and Sir Francis Burdett. Also defeated was Henry Hunt.<br>
<br>In 1821&#150;2 Maxwell was captain of the <i>Bulwark</i> (74 guns), flagship of Sir Benjamin Hallowell (afterwards Carew) at Chatham, and in 1823 of the <i>Briton</i> on the South American station. In May 1831 he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Prince Edward Island, and was preparing for his departure when he died suddenly on 26 June 1831.<br>
<br>Of Maxwell's six brothers, three were in the army, two in the navy. Of these last, John, a captain of 1810, died in command of the frigate <i>Aurora</i> in 1826. Keith (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1774), a lieutenant of 1794, was specially promoted commander in 1801 for cutting out the French 20-gun corvette <i>Chevrette</i> from under the batteries of Camaret Bay on the night of 21&#150;2 July. He was promoted captain in 1804 and died in 1823.<br>
