<span class="headword">William fitz Aldelin</span> <span class="st"> [William Fitzaldhelm]</span>  (<em>d.</em> before 1198), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was of modest origins, being perhaps a younger son of Aldelin of Oldfield (near Ripon, Yorkshire). In the past he has been confused with William de Burgh, the brother of the thirteenth-century justiciar Hubert de Burgh, but this identification has long been discredited. William fitz Aldelin is first recorded some time before 1143, as a witness to a charter of Ilbert de Lacy, relating to Potterton in the West Riding. He is mentioned as a royal official on pipe rolls between 1159/60 (when he had charge of the king's son, Henry) and 1164/5. In September 1165, styled <i>marescallus</i>, he acted as a royal justice at Westminster. In 1166 lands in Hampshire which he held of the king by service as his marshal are listed as having been granted to him with his marriage (before 1162) to Juliana (<i>d</i>. 1186&times;9?), daughter of Robert Dorsnell, also called Doisnell; he is also recorded holding one knight's fee of Henry de Lacy, at Thorpe Audlin, Yorkshire. In October 1170 he was one of two royal representatives consulted by Becket's agents before their appearance before the young King Henry, son of Henry II, at Westminster and in December 1170 was named as one of the young king's three <i>tutores</i>. In July 1171 he witnessed a charter of Henry II in favour of Newstead Priory, Lincolnshire, at Bur-le-Roy in Normandy.<br>
<br>On 7 October 1171 William witnessed a charter of Henry's at Pembroke and crossed to Ireland in advance of the king, whom he met at Waterford on 18 October 1171. He witnessed Henry's grant of Dublin city to the men of Bristol, and also that of Meath to Hugh de Lacy at Wexford, in April 1172; the latter document contains the first reference to William as <i>dapifer</i> (steward), a new title corroborated by his being described in separate entries on the 1172/3 pipe roll as <i>marescallus</i> and <i>dapifer</i>. According to Gerald of Wales, he was sent by Henry, along with Hugh de Lacy, to negotiate with Ruaidri Ua Conchobair, king of Connacht and claimant to the high-kingship, whose submission he received at the River Shannon. It is possible that there was indeed a meeting, but Gerald's account of Ua Conchobair's submission is certainly inaccurate. Gerald also relates that before Henry II left Ireland he assigned custody of Wexford (which he had retained as royal demesne) to William fitz Aldelin, but this is not substantiated by the better-informed court chronicler, Roger of Howden, who names Robert fitz Bernard in that role. In 1172/3 William was pardoned a scutage payment due from two fees of new feoffment in the Curcy honour, which was in the king's hand and had been entrusted by the king to William, and in 1176 he was remitted 2 marks owed towards the aid to marry the king's daughter, due apparently from the same two fees in the Curcy honour.<br>
<br>About March 1173, when Henry II summoned Richard fitz Gilbert, lord of Striguil, known as Strongbow, and Hugh de Lacy to serve in Normandy, William fitz Aldelin was appointed as Henry's procurator in Ireland. With the style &#145;steward of the king of England&#146;  (Gilbert, 1.138), he conducted an inquisition into lands held by St Mary's Abbey, Dublin, before the confirmation charter issued by Henry II at Falaise in late 1174, which William witnessed. Gerald of Wales asserts that at some time between 1173 and 1175 the papal letter of Pope Adrian IV known as <span class="italic">Laudabiliter</span>, together with a privilege of Pope Alexander III, were proclaimed publicly at an episcopal synod at Waterford attended by William fitz Aldelin and Nicholas, prior of Wallingford. Assuming that Gerald's account may be relied upon, the occasion may have been the installation of Augustinus &Oacute; Selbaig as bishop of Waterford; the election was confirmed by Henry II at Windsor in 1175. Styled <i>senescallus</i>, William witnessed the treaty of Falaise between Henry II and the king of Scots in October 1174, and during 1175 and 1176 was regularly in attendance at court as steward and also acted as a justice hearing pleas in the <i>curia regis</i> in 1175/6.<br>
<br>Following the death of Strongbow on 20 April 1176, William fitz Aldelin was sent to Ireland to take custody of Strongbow's lands and castles. Early in 1177 he issued a charter in favour of St Thomas's Abbey, Dublin, on behalf of Henry II, in the presence of the papal legate, Cardinal Vivian, and of the archbishop of Dublin, Lorc&aacute;n Ua Tuathail. In February of that year John de Curcy is said to have left the Anglo-Norman garrison of Dublin without permission from William, who was his superior, before undertaking the conquest of Ulster. Gerald of Wales presents a very negative view of William, depicting him as impeding the ambitions of the chronicler's kinsmen in Ireland, but arguably this was a measure of his success as a royal agent in Ireland. Specifically, Gerald accuses him of taking the castle of Wicklow from the sons of Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1176), though he was ultimately compelled to give them Ferns in exchange; of depriving Raymond Fitzgerald le Gros (<i>d</i>. 1189&times;92) of lands which he held in the Vale of Dublin and adjacent to Wexford; and of depriving Robert fitz Stephen of a cantred in U&iacute; F&aacute;el&aacute;in. William's nephew, Walter Alemannus, who was <i>custos</i> of Wexford under him, was supposedly suborned by Muirchertach Mac Murchada, ruler of U&iacute; Chennselaig, to effect the destruction of Ferns at the expense of the sons of Maurice Fitzgerald. Although Gerald of Wales avers that William was recalled to England in May 1177 because of incompetence, it may have been tensions between him and the adventurer-settlers, as described by Gerald, which occasioned Henry's major council on Ireland held at Oxford in May 1177, at which William fitz Aldelin was present. On the evidence of Roger of Howden, he was then reappointed as the king's principal agent in Ireland, and also custodian of Strongbow's lands, including the town of Wexford.<br>
<br>Gerald of Wales cryptically asserts that under William fitz Aldelin &#145;Ireland and Wales together lamented their total destruction and ruin&#146;  (Giraldus Cambrensis, 239). William's association with Wales is obscure, but it may be that, when he assumed custody of Leinster in 1176, he also became responsible for the lordship of Striguil, and perhaps even Pembroke. His presence in England is unattested from 1177 until December 1181 when, still styled steward, he witnessed a charter of Henry II in favour of the monastery of Godstow. Roger of Howden records that a deputation from Ireland was received by Henry II at Windsor early in 1179, which complained of unjust and violent treatment at the hands of Henry's agents and that, as a result, William fitz Aldelin and Hugh de Lacy were removed from office; possibly representations were made by Lorc&aacute;n Ua Tuathail, archbishop of Dublin, and Cadla &Oacute; Dubhtaig, archbishop of Tuam, who visited the court about that time, seeking permission to attend the Third Lateran Council. William may have been recalled permanently from Ireland by 1179, but it is not until autumn 1181 that he is found witnessing royal charters in England as steward, and between 1182/3 and 1188/9 the pipe rolls record him as holding escheated lands in Hampshire at the pleasure of the king.<br>
<br>On 17 March 1187 William fitz Aldelin and his wife, Juliana, granted Little Maplestead, Essex, to the hospitallers, he styling himself the king's steward, and Juliana issued a separate charter. The latter was witnessed by one Ralph, calling himself &#145;the son of William my lord&#146; (which suggests that William had had at least one child with another woman), as well as by William's brother, also named Ralph  (Gervers, 59&#150;61). Some time before 1189 William and his wife gave Compton church, Hampshire, to Merton Priory. Between 1188 and 1197 he was sheriff of Cumberland, and he also acted intermittently as an itinerant justice in Cumberland and Yorkshire. At some point between 1181 and 1189 he witnessed a charter of Henry II at Anjou; and on 1 December 1189 he witnessed a charter of Richard I in favour of Canterbury. Between 1189 and 1194 he attested charters of Queen Eleanor, widow of Henry II. A charter of about 1190 refers to 10 marks given to him by his tenant, Durand son of Drew, &#145;for my journey to Jerusalem&#146;, indicating that he was preparing to go on crusade  (Farrer, <span class="italic">Early Yorkshire Charters</span>, 3.299). Following Juliana's death William married Eustachia de Curtenai, named as his wife in two charters which he issued in favour of St Bees in Cumberland. He was dead by 1198, when land in Teversham, Cambridgeshire, which he had held as the king's marshal, was recorded as having escheated to the crown. In 1199 William de Werbirton and Ingram de Munceaux made fine as her heirs to have the inheritance of Juliana, wife of William fitz Aldelin.<br>
