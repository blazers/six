<span class="headword">Farnaby,  Giles</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1640), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born probably in London, the son of Thomas Farnaby (<i>d</i>. 1595), &#145;Cittizen and Joyner of London&#146;, and his wife, &#145;Janakin alias Jane&#146; (<i>d</i>. 1605)  (Thomas Farnaby's will, commissary court of London, 1594/5, 41). According to Anthony Wood he &#145;was of the family of Farnaby of Truro in Cornwall, and near of kin to Tho[mas] Farnaby, the famous schoolmaster of Kent&#146;  (Wood, 257). Nothing else is known of his parental background, though his mother, buried on 27 September 1605 at Waltham St Lawrence, Berkshire  (Fellowes and Boston), was perhaps of Huguenot descent, judging from her foreign name and the bequests in her nuncupative will favouring the Dutch Reformed and French protestant churches in London  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/107, sig. 36).<br>
<br>Both composer and artisan, Farnaby began studying music about 1580 and graduated BMus at Christ Church, Oxford, on 7 July 1592. He was bound apprentice to the Joiners' Company in or before 1583, becoming a freeman by 1590, when he is listed as a feoffee. Like his cousin Nicholas (<i>d</i>. 1630), also a joiner, he may have specialized in making virginals.<br>
<br>Farnaby married Katheryne Roane at St Helen, Bishopsgate, on 28 May 1587. The 1589 &#145;parsons tythe&#146; (churchwardens' accounts) records that he subscribed the lowest amount (2<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>.) paid by any parishioner that year. In 1591 he was living in the neighbouring parish of St Peter Westcheap, and by 1599 he had moved to St Mary-le-Bow, Cheapside. Three children were born during this period: Philadelphia (1591); Richard, the composer (<i>c</i>.1593); and Joy (1599), referred to as &#145;musitian&#146; in 1636  (Fellowes and Boston).<br>
<br>About 1600 the family unexpectedly left London. By 1602 Farnaby was churchwarden of St Peter, Aisthorpe, a village just north of Lincoln. The bishop's transcripts, signed &#145;Egidius Farnaby&#146;, record the baptism of Philadelphia in that of 1602 (the previous daughter of that name had evidently died) and Edward in 1604. A diocesan commissioners' report on the parish in 1603 states that &#145;neither man nor woeman &hellip; is either &hellip; recusant or &hellip; doth not receive the Communion orderly&#146;  (Foster, 343). The Farnabys were still in Lincolnshire in 1608 according to an indenture of lease, dated 18 February that year, ratifying a twenty-year agreement between Sir Nicholas Saunderson of nearby Fillingham and &#145;Giles Farnabie &hellip; gent&#146;. Farnaby was to teach music to Sir Nicholas's children and Richard Farnaby was to be apprenticed to instruct them &#145;in skill of musick and plaieinge uppon instruments&#146;  (Lumley MSS, MTD/B17/9). &#145;Arrears in 1611 suggest that by then Giles may have left the district &hellip; The indenture is endorsed <i>vacat consensu</i>&#146;  (Owen, 153). In London Richard Farnaby married Elizabeth Sendye at St Peter Westcheap on 13 April 1614.<br>
<br>Remembered nowadays for his distinctive virginal works, Farnaby was better known to his contemporaries as a vocal composer. In 1592 he contributed eight settings to Thomas East's celebrated <span class="italic">Whole Booke of Psalmes</span>; some were reused in the metrical psalters published by William Barley (1599) and Thomas Ravenscroft (1621). He also compiled his own &#145;Psalmes of David, to fower parts, for viols and voyce, the first booke Doricke mottoes, the second, divine canzonets &hellip; with a prelud, before the psalmes, cromaticke&#146;. Dedicated some time between 1625 and 1639 to Dr Henry King, &#145;cheife prebend&#146; of St Paul's Cathedral, the manuscript cantus partbook alone survives (in the University of Pennsylvania Library).<br>
<br>Farnaby's only secular publication, <span class="italic">Canzonets to Fowre Voyces with a Song of Eight Parts</span>, appeared in 1598. Dedicated to Ferdinando Heyborne, groom of the privy chamber, the volume includes prefatory poems by Anthony Holborne, John Dowland, Richard Alison, and Hugh Holland. Concise and melodious, the twenty four-part canzonets, set to predominantly light-hearted texts, combine brief imitation with chordal textures. Most distinctive are the chromatic, sombre setting of &#145;Construe my meaning&#146; and the densely resonant concluding eight-part &#145;song&#146;, &#145;Witness ye heavens&#146;. Fragments of two other vocal compositions survive: &#145;Come Caron, come&#146;, a contrafactum of his canzonet &#145;Ay me, poor heart&#146;, lacking the altus and with only the triplex part texted  (Royal College of Music, MS 2049); and the altus of a contrapuntal five-part anthem, &#145;O my sonne Absolon&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 29427, fol. 32).<br>
<br>Farnaby's keyboard manuscripts circulated little. Of fifty-three attributed pieces, all but one appear (fifty-one uniquely) in the so-called Fitzwilliam virginal book, a vast anthology which may have been compiled by the wealthy Cornish recusant Francis Tregian during his confinement in the Fleet prison between 1609 and 1619. All genres are represented, except plainsong settings. At least four of the eleven fantasias are transcriptions of vocal pieces&#151;two by Farnaby himself. A few of the numerous dances, which include pavans, galliards, allemandes, and jigs, are also arrangements. The approximately dozen sets of variations best reveal his penchant for devising reprises rich in detailed idiomatic figuration. Noteworthy compositions include an &#145;Alman for Two Virginals&#146; and a suite of four &#145;character&#146; miniatures: &#145;Giles Farnabys Dreame&#146;, &#145;His Rest&#146;, &#145;Farnabyes Conceit&#146;, and &#145;His Humour&#146;. Such pieces illustrate an engaging spontaneity and tunefulness few of his contemporaries could rival. Tregian's keyboard collection also includes four pieces ascribed to Richard Farnaby.<br>
<br>The registers of St Giles Cripplegate for 1634 mention &#145;the house of Gyles Farnaby in Grub Street&#146;, a locality noted in a 1638 survey for its &#145;extreme poverty&#146;  (T. C. Dale, <span class="italic">The Inhabitants of London in 1638</span>, 1932, 239). They also record the burial of &#145;Gyles Farnaby musitian&#146; on 25 November 1640.<br>
