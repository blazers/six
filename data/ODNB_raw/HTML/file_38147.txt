<span class="headword">Wontner <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Smith]</span>,  Arthur</span>  (1875&#150;1960), <span class="occ">actor and theatre manager</span>, was born in London on 21 January 1875, the eldest in the family of four sons and one daughter of Thomas Arthur Smith (1848&#150;1920), partner in Wontner, Smith &amp; Co., stocktakers in the City of London, and his wife, Emily Mary (1848&#150;1923), daughter of Thomas Taylor Wontner, stocktaker. He was educated at the North London Collegiate School. His early life was regulated by strict discipline, his only contact with art being the family orchestra, to which each member contributed by playing a different instrument. His father intended him to follow his trade but, to his chagrin, his son chose to become an actor, supported by the odd pound from his mother. His father gave him nothing.<br>
<br>Giving up the family name (confirmed by deed poll in 1909), he called himself Arthur Wontner and started his career in the theatre in Ryde, Isle of Wight, on 18 April 1897, in <span class="italic">The Sorrows of Satan</span>. No manager or salary were recorded but he managed on his mother's contributions and joined Miss Sarah Thorne at the Theatre Royal, Margate, Kent, where he played thirty leading parts in eight months. He opened in London in 1898 in <span class="italic">The Three Musketeers</span>, and then toured for four years, adding fifty new parts to the first thirty. He was engaged by Herbert Beerbohm Tree to act in Australia, where he played in <span class="italic">The Eternal City</span> (1903&#150;5), and he returned to London with 100 parts ready for performance. The first was <span class="italic">Raffles</span> (1906). He moved away from mere professionalism towards the art of a leading man in plays that required first-rate acting, performing in plays by Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, H. G. Granville-Barker, Sir J. M. Barrie, and Ibsen. In 1929 Wontner went into management with Lady Mary Wyndham and then on his own. By his retirement in 1955 he had performed in over 200 plays. He also pursued a career in radio, television, and films, and he became famous in the role of Sherlock Holmes. His theatrical power emerges from the portrait by Alfred Cope at the Garrick Club of Wontner as Joseph Fouch&eacute; in the Italian play <span class="italic">Napoleon</span>.<br>
<br>Wontner was twice married. In 1903 he married Rosecleer Alice Amelia Blanche Kingwell from Totnes, Devon, whom he met on the voyage to Australia. Her stage name was Rose Pendennis and she was the daughter of Henry Alfred Kingwell, who had an export business in New Zealand. They had two sons and one daughter. Rose died in 1943, and in 1947 he married Florence Eileen (<i>d</i>. 1970), daughter of Thomas Lainchbury, businessman. Wontner died on 10 July 1960 at his home, 177 Holland Park Avenue, London.<br>
