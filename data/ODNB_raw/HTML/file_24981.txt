<span class="headword">Seager,  Charles</span>  (1808&#150;1878), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, was born in Evesbatch, Herefordshire, where he was baptized on 7 April 1808, the son of John Seager (1776&#150;1849), rector of Welsh Bicknor, Monmouthshire, from 1808 until his death on 27 May 1849, and his wife, Mary. John Seager was the translator of several works on Greek grammar and prosody, and published a supplement to Johnson's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> in 1819. Seager matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 30 November 1832 and in 1834 he was elected a scholar of Worcester College. In that year he published an ode in Hebrew to mark the inauguration of the duke of Wellington as chancellor of the university, and in 1836 he gained the Kennicott Hebrew scholarship. He graduated BA on 25 May 1836 (MA, 1839) and was ordained priest in May 1837. He married, in Huddersfield on 25 May 1837, Anna (1806/7&#150;1893), daughter of Walter Smith, curate of Almondbury.<br>
<br>From 1839 to 1843 Segar was an assistant lecturer in Hebrew, under E. B. Pusey. Closely associated with the Tractarian party he, along with Mark Pattison and J. B. Mozley, lived from 1838 at the house for young writers established in St Aldates, Oxford, by Pusey and J. H. Newman. He was one of the earliest Tractarian converts to the Roman Catholic church. In January 1842 Pusey wrote to Newman asking him to correct Seager's romanizing tendencies, but although Newman made the attempt, Seager was received into the Catholic church on 12 October 1843 at St Mary's College, Oscott. His secession caused Pusey much pain and embarrassment. His wife converted in 1844.<br>
<br>Having spent many years as an independent scholar, when the Catholic University College was established at Kensington by Cardinal Manning in 1875 Seager was appointed to the chair of Hebrew and comparative philology. His knowledge of oriental languages was extensive, but Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac were his specialities. During the latter part of his life, however, he turned his attention to the languages of Assyria and Egypt, and he regularly attended the classes instituted by the Society of Biblical Archaeology under A. H. Sayce and P. Le Page Renouf. He was an active member of the council of the society. Shortly before his death he was readmitted a member of the University of Oxford, from which he had been expelled on his secession to Catholicism. A decree was passed enabling him to replace his name on the books without payment of the usual fees. He died suddenly at the H&ocirc;tel de la Ville, Florence, while attending a congress of orientalists, on 18 September 1878, and was buried in Oxford. His widow died at Ramsgate on 27 March 1893. One of his sons, Ignatius, was ordained priest in 1869 and died in 1870. Another, Osmund (1843&#150;1920), educated at the Jesuit college at Metz and at Newman's University in Dublin, later became an assistant principal at the Admiralty. In addition to his contributions to the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, Seager published some eleven works on philology, liturgy, apologetics, and politics, as well as a book of travels in the Rhineland, <span class="italic">The Female Jesuit Abroad</span> (1853).<br>
