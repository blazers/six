<span class="headword">Yapp, Sir  Arthur Keysall</span>  (1869&#150;1936), <span class="occ">young people's welfare organizer</span>, was born at Orleton, near Leominster, on 12 March 1869, the son of Richard Keysall Yapp (1828/9&#150;1873), farmer, and his wife, Jane Gammidge. For many generations his forebears had farmed in Herefordshire, and his father lived there on his own land. All his life he retained the simplicity and instincts of a countryman. His mother, youngest child of Timothy Gammidge, a Congregational minister, exercised a great influence on the lives of her three children. The father died when his elder son, Arthur, was four years old, and the family moved to Leominster. Educated at home and at the Hereford County College, Yapp entered a local firm of agricultural engineers, devoting his spare time to temperance and mission work. It was not until he was twenty-one, however, that he was first attracted to the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) when the local branch invited him to become its honorary secretary. To this work he gave his leisure, and two years later (1892) came a call to service as a full-time general secretary of the Derby YMCA. In 1898 he left Derby in order to undertake the extension of the YMCA work in Lancashire, where he became a pioneer in developing YMCAs in volunteer camps (1901) and, later, initiated a programme with the Territorial Force. In 1901 he married Alice Maude, second daughter of Thomas Hesketh Higson, of Southport; they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Yapp's leadership extended throughout the north of England where in fields of widely different character he was gradually building up an experience that was to give him unique equipment for his later responsibilities. In 1907 he was invited by the Manchester YMCA to superintend its new building enterprise and to become its first general secretary. In 1912 Yapp went to London as secretary of the National Council of YMCAs, Incorporated. The movement had already gone some way towards freeing itself from its rather narrow early traditions, and at the outbreak of the First World War he inaugurated the war emergency service which was to spread throughout the world, bringing the association into a new phase of opportunity and responsibility. The red triangle sign, symbolizing spirit, mind, and body, was introduced in 1914 by Yapp. Through his inspiration, within ten days of the outbreak of war, 250 centres of rest and recreation were at the service of the forces, and before it had run its course there were more than 10,000 centres on the fighting fronts.<br>
<br>In 1917 Yapp was appointed KBE and was invited by Lloyd George to take charge as honorary director of the food economy campaign, and for six months a heavy programme of travel and public speaking was added to his work. In 1918 he visited the United States of America, and in the post-war years went twice to India and once round the world. After the war there was a steady development of new branches at home, and in the days of industrial depression he threw the weight of the national movement behind the work in distressed areas.<br>
<br>For not less than fifteen years Yapp worked eighteen hours a day and seven days a week. In 1929 he retired from active leadership owing to ill health, and became deputy president of the YMCA, which position he held until his death. He died suddenly at Chobham Road, Woking, on 5 November 1936 after visiting the YMCA there. He was buried at Orleton.<br>
<br>An evangelical churchman from early youth, Yapp preached in churches and chapels of all denominations, and was the first layman to speak from the pulpits of Canterbury and other cathedrals. He had a fine presence with an attractive personality and a keen sense of humour, and was a lifelong teetotaller and non-smoker. An eloquent speaker and an admirable organizer with unbounded energy and initiative, he gave his life to Christian service, with a devotion to youth in which he firmly believed.<br>
