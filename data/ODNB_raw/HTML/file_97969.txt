<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Don,  Kaye Ernest</span>  (1892&#150;1981), <span class="occ">motor racing driver and water speed record-holder</span>, was born in Dublin on 10 April 1892, the elder son in the family of two sons and one daughter of Charles Ferdinand Donajowski (1851&#150;1912), variously a shipping agent, publisher, and journalist, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bowry (1866&#150;1948), of New Malden, Surrey. His paternal grandfather, born in Prussia, came to London in the mid-nineteenth century as a teacher of German.<br>
<br>As Carl Don, the surname by which he was known throughout his life, he was admitted to Wolverhampton grammar school in 1899. From 1910 he was employed in the motor tyre trade, working for the Avon Rubber Company in Oxford Street, London, and after the death of his father he supported his mother and sister. He competed in motorcycle trials prior to the First World War. He joined the army in 1915, but was discharged on health grounds from the Royal Army Service Corps after nine months. In 1916 he joined the Royal Flying Corps, serving on the western front and at the general headquarters in France, and holding a commission in the RAF on its creation in 1918. After the war he served in Ireland. Demobilized in April 1919, he remained on the reserve list, relinquishing his RAF commission, with the rank of flying officer, in March 1927.<br>
<br>After the war, now known as Kaye Don, he returned to the motor business, taking part in motorcycle reliability trials as a works driver. By 1922 he had gravitated to the motor racing fraternity based at the Brooklands racetrack in Weybridge. Tall and fair-haired, he fitted in effortlessly alongside the most renowned Brooklands personalities. He drove a single-seater AC there in 1922, lapping at 100.61 m.p.h. and achieving an hour record of 90 m.p.h., before racing in cars powered by the Wolseley Viper engine, originally developed as an aero engine.<br>
<br>Don became mainly associated with Sunbeam cars as a works driver. Driving the rebuilt 2 litre Sunbeam car in which Dario Resta had been killed in a record attempt in 1924, he won a series of races at Brooklands, including victories over both Malcolm Campbell and John Cobb. His competitive appearances were mainly confined to Brooklands, where in May 1928 he beat Parry Thomas's lap record, his speed of 131.67 m.p.h. making him the first driver there to exceed a lap speed of 130 m.p.h. On 18 August 1928, in a Lea-Francis, he won the inaugural Ulster tourist trophy in Newtownards ahead of forty-three other competitors, completing the thirty laps (410 miles) in just under six hours at an average speed of 64.06 m.p.h. His peak year of track successes was 1929, when he held more British and international class records than any driver had previously achieved.<br>
<br>Don was proclaimed as the new potential rival to Henry Segrave, whose triumphs in America had intensified public interest in the world land and water speed records. By September 1929 Sunbeam's designer Louis Coatalen had begun constructing a bespoke vehicle for Don to make an attempt on the land speed record. The resulting 31 foot long <i>Silver Bullet</i> had an unsuccessful trial on Pendine Sands in January 1930, and Don followed Segrave's lead, opting to make his record attempt at Daytona Beach. After arriving in America in March he battled against poor weather and the technical limitations of <i>Silver Bullet</i>, considered by some not to possess adequate weight to counterbalance its central engines. On 15 March 1930 he was thrown around the vehicle's cockpit as he struggled to maintain an average speed of 180 m.p.h., well short of Segrave's 231.4 m.p.h. record.<br>
<br>Don enjoyed greater success with his pursuit of the world's water speed record. Segrave had been killed as his <i>Miss England II</i> crashed at Windermere in June. Lord Charles Wakefield's Castrol company, which had financed Segrave's water record attempts, identified Don as Segrave's successor and logical challenger to the American Gar Wood. Wood was the most successful powerboat racer in history, and in February 1931 set a new record of 102.1 m.p.h. The battle lines between the men were established when Don, piloting the salvaged <i>Miss England II</i>, attained a two-way average of 103.4 m.p.h. in April as part of the British Empire Trade Exhibition in Buenos Aires. In July 1931 Don raised the record to 110 m.p.h. at the Lake Garda regatta in Italy, and was received by Benito Mussolini in congratulation.<br>
<br>In September 1931, in Detroit, Don, Wood, and Wood's younger brother George competed for the Harmsworth trophy. The elder Wood had held the trophy for a decade, and was familiar with the Detroit River where the contest took place. In front of half a million spectators Don claimed the first heat with a course record. The competition descended into farce when Gar Wood's <i>Miss America IX</i> crossed the starting-line before the gun, with Don's <i>Miss England II</i> in swift pursuit. Both men were disqualified, and George Wood completed the heat uncontested. America thus retained the trophy, though Gar Wood was roundly criticized by the transatlantic press for his apparent subterfuge.<br>
<br>In 1932 the two men again tussled for the water speed record and Harmsworth trophy. In July, on Loch Lomond, Don set a new record in the newly built <i>Miss England III</i>, averaging 119.81 m.p.h. over the two runs, and having averaged 120.50 m.p.h. on the north run became the first man to travel two miles a minute on water. The Harmsworth contest again, however, proved anticlimactic, with Don's boat unable to mount a successful challenge owing to technical problems. Later that month Wood pushed the record up to 124.91 m.p.h. Don was unable to respond as Lord Wakefield abandoned his financing of powerboat racing, bringing an abrupt end to Don's period of success on water.<br>
<br>Don married in New York, on 16 September 1932, an American heiress, Eileen, daughter of Leonard F. Martin, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. He was back at Brooklands in 1933, driving a type 54 Bugatti, while his sister, Rita Christine Don (later Driver) (1901&#150;1955), drove Freddie Dixon's Riley.<br>
<br>In 1934 Don, now predominantly focused on his business interests, travelled to the Isle of Man for a light car road race in an MG Magnette. During a practice session on a public road on 28 May his vehicle collided with a saloon car, resulting in the death of his onboard MG mechanic, Francis Tayler of Cowley, Oxford. Don was seriously injured. After a coroner's inquest found by a majority verdict that Tayler's death was due to the &#145;culpable negligent driving&#146; of Don, he was tried for manslaughter before the Manx assizes in July 1934, found guilty, and sentenced to four months' imprisonment. His appeal at the end of September was dismissed, and he was imprisoned in Douglas gaol, but was released on 10 December before completing his full term.<br>
<br>While serving his sentence Don was the subject of a biography by the extreme right-wing sporting journalist James Wentworth Day, with an introduction by Malcolm Campbell, justifying speed record attempts both as advertisements for British manufacturing and as leading to important technical improvements in the cars driven by ordinary motorists.<br>
<br>After the Second World War, Don was chairman and managing director of the motorcycle manufacturers US Concessionaires, retiring in 1965. His first marriage was dissolved and he married, second, on 14 April 1954 (by then using the middle name Ernest), Valerie Evelyn Mary (<i>b</i>. 1921/2), daughter of Ronald Farquhar Chapman, civil engineer. Resident in Chobham, Surrey, he died at St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, on 29 August 1981.<br>
