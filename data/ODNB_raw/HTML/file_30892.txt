</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cameron,  (Mark) James Walter</span>  (1911&#150;1985), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born in Battersea, London, on 17 June 1911, the elder son (there were no daughters) of William Ernest Cameron, barrister and novelist, and his wife, Margaret Douglas Robertson. His Scottish links always remained unshaken. His grandfather was a highland divine, whose Gaelic ecclesiastical writings won him local renown, and his father was a lawyer turned author under the name Mark Allerton. He was educated, on his own testimony, &#145;erratically, at a variety of small schools, mostly in France&#146;, and then started real work, filling paste pots, at the age of sixteen for 15<i>s</i>. a week, in the offices of D. C. Thomson's <span class="italic">Red Star Weekly</span> in Dundee.<br>
<br>Escaping to the <span class="italic">Scottish Daily Express</span> in 1938, Cameron was able to afford to marry his first love, Eleanor (Elma) Mara Murray (<i>b</i>. 1913/14), an artist. She was the daughter of George John Murray, a surgeon of Dundee. It was an idyllic but cruelly brief affair, cut short by her death in childbirth in 1940. A daughter was born. Turned down for the armed forces because of &#145;organic cardiac disease&#146;, Cameron moved in 1939 to the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span> in Fleet Street, subbing other people's copy. He met Elizabeth O'Conor working in the art room of the newspaper, and they were married at the Chelsea register office, London, on 25 November 1943. She was the daughter of Stanley Punshon Marris, a retired clergyman, and the former wife of Denis Armor O'Conor, with whom she had a son. She was also to have a son with Cameron.<br>
<br>As the war ended, Cameron stumbled on his real trade. One assignment sent him to India at the moment of the independence negotiations; he started to comprehend the moral impetus behind the Asian and the worldwide revolt against imperialism. He had Jawaharlal Nehru and M. K. Gandhi for his tutors. Another assignment took him to Bikini when the American atomic bomb was exploded; his allegiance to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, launched much later, was born in that forgotten summer of 1946. A third assignment took him to expose the brutality and corruption of Syngman Rhee's regime in South Korea. And back at home he chose his own allies with some delicacy. When the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> engaged in what he justly believed to be a shameful slur against the Labour minister, E. John St Loe Strachey, in 1950, he resigned from the Beaverbrook newspapers altogether, and when Edward Hulton, the owner of <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>, fired its talented editor, H. T. Hopkinson, for daring to attempt to publish Cameron's Korean dispatches, he resigned again in sympathy (1951).<br>
<br>Soon thereafter Cameron's genius flowed in the truly great and truly Liberal <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> of those times. Many contributed to the triumph: Sir Gerald Barry, his editor; Tom Baistow, his foreign editor; and Vicky, the cartoonist, soon to become the closest friend of all. His passion and his wit and his readiness to fit every incident into the worldwide scene were all part of his charm. His matchless integrity was part of it too, and yet he could wear his armour without a hint of pride or piety. He could raise journalism to the highest level of literature, like a Swift or a Hazlitt.<br>
<br>But the Liberal hour did not last; the Liberal financiers killed off the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> in 1960. Other wars, requiring investigation, had broken out, and Cameron could turn to other instruments than his pen. To persuade the world that the North Vietnamese were made of flesh and blood, in 1965 he staked all the fortune he had not got, and all his precious time and energy, to get in and out of Hanoi with a camera crew. His film, <span class="italic">Western Eyewitness</span>, was shown on BBC television and was also bought by several overseas stations.<br>
<br>Most of Cameron's journalistic accomplishments were recited in what he called his &#145;experiment in biography&#146;, <span class="italic">Point of Departure</span>, published in 1967. Another title, <span class="italic">An Indian Summer</span>, which appeared in October 1974, offered even more enticing prospects. After the dissolution of his previous marriage in 1969, in January 1971 he married Moneesha Sarkar (1930&#150;2013), airline receptionist, the daughter of Kandrachanda Ayuppa Appachoo, coffee planter. She had a daughter and a son from a previous marriage. She took him on honeymoon to her native land, which ended in a car crash. A bundle of skin, bones, wood, and wire was somehow trans-shipped back to London and there stuck together by the National Health Service and Cameron's wife.<br>
<br>All such accidents, susceptibilities, memories, and broken hopes and dreams were woven together into a single thread in <span class="italic">An Indian Summer</span>. It is a book about ancient and modern India, brave, beautiful, astringent, withering, and, just occasionally, savage; an Anglo-Indian classic fit to take its place beside <span class="italic">A Passage to India</span> by E. M. Forster. Cameron was appointed CBE in 1979. In 1965 he won the Granada journalist of the year award. He had honorary degrees from the universities of Lancaster (DLitt, 1970), Bradford (LLD, 1977), and Essex (DUniv 1978). He died at his London home, 3 Eton College Road, Chalk Farm, on 26 January 1985.<br>
