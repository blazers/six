<span class="headword">Tate,  William</span>  (1748&#150;1806), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born in Liverpool in September 1748, and was the brother of the Liverpool merchant and amateur painter Richard Tate. He attended a school at Woolton, near Liverpool. The painter Joseph Wright lodged with Richard Tate in 1769 and shortly thereafter William became his pupil. He was in London <i>c</i>.1771&#150;2 and exhibited at the Society of Artists between 1771 and 1791; he was elected a fellow in 1773. Tate was in Manchester in 1773 but had returned to Liverpool by 1774, when he exhibited at the first art exhibition organized by the Society of Artists in Liverpool and where he showed two portraits and two studies in black chalk of Venus. He seems to have remained in Liverpool for the next couple of years, as he exhibited at the Royal Academy from Liverpool in 1776, but in the following year from 1 Red Lion Square, London.<br>
<br>On 31 March 1777 Tate entered the Royal Academy Schools, where he gave his age as twenty-eight last September. From 1778 until 1782 he gave his address as 11 Craven Street, Wright's London address when exhibiting. However, like Wright, Tate seems to have quarrelled with the academy, for in April 1787 Wright wrote to a mutual acquaintance:<blockquote>My ingenious &amp; very worthy friend Tate, whom you know, has not for several years past, owing to some ill treatment he met wth at The Academy exhibited any pictures, by wch omission he finds himself lost to the world and neglected. (Nicolson, 138)</blockquote>Although Tate exhibited only intermittently at the academy, he showed at both the Society of Artists and at the exhibitions held by the various Liverpool societies in Liverpool in 1784 and 1787.<br>
<br>Tate was evidently well regarded in Liverpool, to where he seems to have returned, as one of the seven portraits he showed in 1784 was hung in a prestigious position next to a portrait by Reynolds. He received commissions from prominent Liverpool families including Daniel Daulby, a member of a brewing family. Daulby sat to Tate, as did both his first and second wives, Elizabeth Knowles and Margaret, sister of the collector William Roscoe (all Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool). Tate evidently fared better in the north, possibly owing to his brother's connections, as by 1787 Wright was able to say of his friend's situation &#145;he is now advantagiously fixed at Manchester where he is encouraged &amp; respected equal to his wishes&#146;  (Nicolson, 138). Tate's relationship with Wright was both professional and personal. After Wright's death in 1797 Tate completed a number of his portraits that had been left unfinished; he also owned a number of oil paintings and watercolour studies by Wright, which he bequeathed to members of his family.<br>
<br>Tate moved to the fashionable spa resort of Bath in January 1804, where he died on 2 June 1806, leaving a widow Ann. The Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, has a number of his portraits.<br>
