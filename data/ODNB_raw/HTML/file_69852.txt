<span class="headword">Jones,  Geraint Iwan</span>  (1917&#150;1998), <span class="occ">organist and conductor</span>, was born on 16 May 1917 in Porth, Glamorgan, the elder son of Evan Jones, a professor of ancient languages at Cardiff University who became a minister in the Welsh Congregational church, and his wife Caroline Davies, formerly a hospital nurse. Evan Jones, a charismatic preacher with the <i>hwyl</i>, did not approve of his son's musical interests, but the boy received encouragement at Caterham School and at the age of sixteen won a scholarship to Cambridge; against his father's wishes he turned it down, and in 1935 became a student at the Royal Academy of Music. He studied the piano with Harry Isaacs and the organ with G. D. Cunningham (for whom he retained a lifelong admiration), was awarded the Sterndale Bennett scholarship in 1937, and graduated in 1939. On 24 June 1940 he married Margaret Audrie Kemp (1913/14&#150;2001), daughter of Allen Frederick Kemp, engineer, and a fellow student at the Royal Academy. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>Ineligible on medical grounds for military service Jones made his d&eacute;but as an organist in 1940, playing the six trio sonatas of J. S. Bach at the wartime National Gallery concerts organized by Myra Hess. During the same year he gave more than thirty solo organ recitals for the BBC and soon built a reputation as one of the most remarkable organists of his generation: while not excluding the virtuoso repertory of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, he concentrated on the baroque period, and during the London season of 1945&#150;6 gave the complete organ works of J. S. Bach in sixteen recitals. In 1948 he made the first of many tours in the USA and Canada. After a recital tour in Germany in 1949 he was engaged by the BBC to record performances on the 1687 Schnitger organ at Steinkirchen near Hamburg; these, and subsequent broadcasts and recordings on other European organs of historical importance, did much to swing public taste away from the grandiose instruments of the Victorian period and encourage an interest in the more intimate sound of the baroque organ&#151;in whose post-war revival he became a leading figure. His activities at this period also included work as a music producer for EMI. Meanwhile, his first marriage having ended in divorce, on 7 April 1949 he married the violinist Winifred Roberts, with whom he gave frequent recitals.<br>
<br>In 1951 the actor Bernard Miles invited Jones to conduct performances of Purcell's <span class="italic">Dido and Aeneas</span> at the Mermaid Theatre, a converted schoolroom in the garden of Miles's home in St John's Wood, London; the Wagnerian soprano Kirsten Flagstad, a friend of Miles's, sang the role of Dido, and the distinguished cast also included Maggie Teyte, Thomas Hemsley, Edith Coates, and Arda Mandikian. With characteristic regard for scholarly detail, Jones made his own edition of the score and directed from the harpsichord; though the casting of the principal female roles was distinctly unconventional, the performance bore the stamp of impeccable musicianship. It was recorded for the gramophone (Elisabeth Schwarzkopf replacing Maggie Teyte), repeated in the following year, and transferred to the Royal Exchange in 1953.<br>
<br>It was from the musicians who played in the <span class="italic">Dido</span> performances that Jones formed the Geraint Jones Singers and Orchestra, with whom he appeared as both conductor and soloist: their cycle of twelve Bach concerts at the Royal Festival Hall in 1955 marked the beginning of an annual series that lasted for over thirty years, and their many recordings included the Italian version of Gluck's <span class="italic">Alceste</span> (with Flagstad again in the title role) in 1956, and two awards of the grand prix du disque in 1959 and 1966. As well as conducting, Jones was still touring widely as a solo performer, travelling as often as possible in one of the succession of classic Rolls-Royces that he drove with such pleasure, but in 1960 he was thrown from his car in an accident and permanently damaged his back; as a result he found it increasingly difficult to maintain the posture needed to control the feet in organ playing, and in later life appeared comparatively rarely in public as an organist, though he continued to record for the BBC in Germany, Spain, and elsewhere and appeared frequently at the harpsichord (particularly in America, and often in joint recitals with his wife). He remained in demand as an organ consultant, designing instruments for the Royal Northern College of Music, the Royal Academy of Music (at Marylebone parish church), the University of St Andrews, the Tsin Sha Tsui concert hall, and the Academy for Performing Arts in Hong Kong. In 1985 he published translations of Fran&ccedil;ois-Henri Clicquot's <span class="italic">Th&eacute;orie pratique de la facture d'orgues</span> and Robert Davy's <span class="italic">Les grandes orgues de l'abbatiale de St. Etienne de Caen</span>.<br>
<br>In 1960 Jones launched the annual Lake District Festival, of which he remained musical director until 1978; he later became artistic director of the Salisbury Festival of the Arts (1972&#150;7) and the Manchester International Organ Festival (1977&#150;87). He was appointed a fellow of the Royal Academy of Music in 1957 and taught the harpsichord there from 1961 to 1987, but his interest in young musicians found its most practical expression in his work with the Kirckman Concert Society, founded in 1963 to provide a platform for outstanding young artists. Though he could be impatient with less gifted performers, he was a shrewd judge and generous encourager of genuine talent, and his role as the first musical director of the Kirckman Society was one that he valued highly and retained until his death.<br>
<br>In later life Jones was known mainly as a conductor and harpsichordist. Though widely recognized as a baroque specialist, he had little time for what he regarded as the &#145;authenticity craze&#146;, believing that imaginative musicianship was infinitely more important than historical dogma. As an organist he was, until his motor accident at least, a virtuoso of exceptional brilliance with a highly unconventional pedal technique; he stood quite outside the established tradition of the English cathedral organist and, apart from minor appointments in early life, never held a regular position as organist or choirmaster. His instinctive feeling for acoustics enabled him to develop a legato rare in organ playing, and he was one of the few performers capable of coaxing genuine musical expression from that notoriously intractable instrument. His love of the fine craftsmanship intrinsic to organ building extended in private life to Romanesque architecture and eighteenth-century furniture; he was a passionate traveller, a connoisseur of wine, and a convivial host with an impish sense of humour. He died, as the result of a stroke, at St Mary's Hospital, Praed Street, Westminster, on 3 May 1998, and was cremated at Marylebone crematorium. He was survived by his second wife, Winifred, and by the daughter of his first marriage.<br>
