<span class="headword">Whitbread,  James William</span>  (1847&#150;1916), <span class="occ">theatre manager and playwright</span>, was born in Portsmouth on 20 October 1847. Little is known of his early years or parentage, except that the family moved to Scarborough during Whitbread's infancy. His obituary in <span class="italic">Era</span> (21 June 1916) refers to his touring as a young actor &#145;with the companies of Joseph Eldred&#146; throughout the north of England and to Dublin, and he appears never to have risen above the rank of respected supporting actor. He married his wife, Rachel, on 8 October 1872. According to the obituary in the <span class="italic">Scarborough Evening News</span> (12 June 1916) Whitbread became manager for Joseph Elaria, then for Wybert Reeve first at the Royal Edinburgh Theatre and from July 1876 at the Theatre Royal, Scarborough. The first record of his involvement with the Queen's Theatre, Dublin, relates to his producing <span class="italic">Dick Wittington and his Immortal Thomas (the Cat)</span>, a Christmas pantomime, in 1882. Whitbread, as lessee, took on the management of that theatre in August 1884 and according to an interview published in the <span class="italic">Irish Times</span> (1 April 1893) &#145;by main energy, patience, wisdom and expenditure of money&#146; transformed a lacklustre, impoverished institution into a decent, popular venue. <br>
<br>From 1886 and the staging of his melodrama <span class="italic">Shoulder to Shoulder</span> Whitbread composed regularly for the Queen's, notably <span class="italic">The Nationalist</span> (1891), <span class="italic">The Irishman</span> (1892), and <span class="italic">The Spectre of the Past, or, Homeless in the Streets of Dublin</span> (1893). As the titles suggest, these early works owed a considerable debt of influence to Boucicault, but Whitbread found an original voice with <span class="italic">Lord Edward Fitzgerald</span> in 1894. While respecting melodramatic conventions, he foregrounded, as his subject allowed, a distinctly revolutionary politics. A series of patriotic, nationalist dramas followed, beginning with Whitbread's celebrated <span class="italic">Theobald Wolfe Tone</span> (1898), designed to coincide with the celebrations commemorating the uprisings of 1798. Other dramas focusing on the heroes and martyrs of that period included: <span class="italic">The Ulster Hero</span> (1902) about Henry Joy McCracken; <span class="italic">The Insurgent Chief</span> (1902) about Michael Dwyer; and <span class="italic">The Sham Squire</span> (1903) about Francis Higgins, who plotted Lord Edward Fitzgerald's destruction. Whitbread's detractors, including W. B. Yeats, often assumed that the playwright merely deployed popular myth about these historical figures but there is evidence that Whitbread did read sources carefully. The typescript of <span class="italic">Lord Edward Fitzgerald</span> submitted for licensing by the lord chamberlain (most of Whitbread's plays toured to English provincial theatres) carries a note on the title-page admitting that a crucial influence had been W. J. Fitzpatrick's <span class="italic">Secret Service under Pitt</span> (1892). Aspects of the play support the claim. With <span class="italic">Sarsfield, or, The Siege of Limerick</span> (1905) Whitbread turned to an earlier period of political unrest surrounding the collapse of the Stuart (Jacobite) cause in 1691, but again the play courted fervent nationalist sympathies in its audiences. The same is true of a number of less overtly political dramas that Whitbread penned: <span class="italic">Shadowed</span>, <span class="italic">Rory O'More</span>, <span class="italic">The Irish Dragoon</span>, <span class="italic">The French Hussar</span>, <span class="italic">The Soldier Priest</span>. <br>
<br>Joseph Holloway, an inveterate Dublin theatregoer, wrote in his diary that a performance of <span class="italic">Theobald Wolfe Tone</span> pleased him for its difference from conventional melodramatic fare, notably &#145;the entire absence of buffoonery in the comic interludes&#146;. There was no doubting Whitbread's seriousness of purpose in attempting to devise a drama that was &#145;a cut above the usual sensational play&#146;. The patriotic, revolutionary subject matter gave a freshness and energy to rhetorical displays in the dialogue, more conventionally deployed to expose an evil consciousness or to define romantic ardour. The plays include romantic interest but the greater love in the heroes is for Ireland and independence, to which private feeling must give way. Whitbread's agenda is both educational (to teach audiences about their inherited past, free of colonial English interpretation), and inspirational (to instil in them nationalist commitment). Even the climactic episodes have to be interpreted in the light of this intent and not as sensational. <span class="italic">Theobald Wolfe Tone</span>, for example, ends with stirring military bands accompanying the embarkation of the French troops at Brest rather than with the collapse of Tone's enterprise with his subsequent arrest in Loch Swilly. The dominant mood is exhilarating, not defeatist. Similarly where a play ends with the revolutionary hero's execution at the hands of the English forces, that death is portrayed through a series of tableaux, where the emphasis is not on the grimly morbid but on the disciplined stoicism which is to be interpreted as martyrdom for the nationalist cause. The irony in all this is that Whitbread was English. What motivated his ideological stance can only be conjectured. The <span class="italic">Era</span> obituary supposes that Whitbread &#145;took up the writing of Irish plays because they were the goods to suit his customers&#146;. But such a mercenary interpretation would most likely lead to shoddy hack work, whereas the plays are carefully finished, expertly paced and structured. Moreover they attracted many fine contemporary Irish performers, such as Tyrone Power and Frank Breen, to work consistently at the Queen's, which run-of-the-mill drama would not have done. As well as being performed successfully for Irish communities throughout Britain, America, and Australia, Whitbread's plays were maintained in the Queen's repertory significantly until 1923 and the creating of the Irish Free State, when their ideological strategies were rendered redundant by political circumstance. Their subsequent neglect is unfortunate, since Whitbread's work afforded a necessary development in the evolution of the Irish historical play, manipulating the devices of melodrama to show the past as shaped by conflicting political ideologies. The plays had an admitted influence on Sean O'Casey. <br>
<br>An illustrated &#145;Address of Appreciation&#146; from the company at the Queen's Theatre, Dublin, commemorating James and Rachel Whitbread's silver wedding anniversary carries cameo portraits of the manager, his wife, and two daughters (Florence and Isabel Louise). His image depicts a broad forehead, wavy hair, well-set eyes, and a flourishing moustache, suggesting a man who carried a handsome, youthful presence into middle age. Whitbread left the Queen's Theatre in 1907 when his lease expired, retiring to Scarborough, where he died of cirrhotic Bright's disease and a cerebral haemorrhage at his home at 38 Londesborough Road on 9 June 1916. He was buried three days later at All Saints' Church. He was survived by his wife; his younger daughter died on the day of the funeral.<br>
