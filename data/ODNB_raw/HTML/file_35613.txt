<span class="headword">Primrose, Sir  Henry William</span>  (1846&#150;1923), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 22 August 1846, the second of the six sons of the Hon. Bouverie Francis Primrose and his wife, Frederica Sophia, daughter of Thomas Anson, first Viscount Anson, and sister of Thomas William Anson, first earl of Lichfield. Primrose, whose father was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22795/', "Archibald John Primrose, fourth earl of Rosebery")</script>, was the cousin of Archibald Philip Primrose, fifth earl of Rosebery, the prime minister. Henry Primrose was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond, and Balliol College, Oxford. He obtained second classes in classical moderations (1867) and in the final honour school of law and modern history (1869). From Oxford he passed into the home civil service, entering the Treasury in 1869.<br>
<br>Primrose was one of W. E. Gladstone's secretaries from April to June 1880, but then went to India as secretary to Lord Ripon, the viceroy. In 1884 he returned to Gladstone's service, serving until the fall of the ministry in 1885. In Gladstone's government of 1886 he was head of the Downing Street secretariat. He was the least admiring of Gladstone's secretaries, and was a useful conduit of information to his cousin, Rosebery (then foreign secretary). In 1887 Primrose was appointed secretary to the office of works. In 1888 he married Helen Mary (<i>d</i>. 1919), eldest daughter of Gilbert McMicking of Miltonise, Wigtownshire, and formerly the wife of James Montgomery Walker; they had one son. In 1895 Primrose was appointed chairman of the board of customs, and in 1899 of the Board of Inland Revenue, which post he held until he retired from the civil service in 1907, aged sixty-one. As a financier Primrose was a strict Gladstonian at a time when Treasury attitudes were fast changing. His evidence to the select committee on income tax in 1906 vigorously defended Victorian precepts.<br>
<br>After retirement Primrose continued active in public life. He chaired the Pacific Cable company from 1907 until 1914. In 1911 he chaired a special committee on the financial clauses of the <span class="roman">Irish Home Rule Bill</span>, a subject with which he had had experience since 1886. He boldly proposed that an Irish government should have full control over its revenue, with the imperial government providing some additional funds to meet the deficit. His plan was thought to offer excessive financial autonomy and was not included in the <span class="roman">Home Rule Bill</span> of 1912, the financial clauses of which were drawn up by Herbert Samuel. In 1912 he was a member of the MacDonnell royal commission on the civil service and in 1913 of the Loreburn royal commission on railways. In 1914 Primrose became chairman of the Welsh church commission consequent on Welsh disestablishment. In the First World War he was chairman of the sugar commission and in 1918 he was a member of the Bradbury committee on staff retrenchment in government offices. Primrose was thus a distinguished and valuable public servant, especially known for the clarity of his minutes and reports. He was created KCB in 1899 and was sworn of the privy council in 1912, an unusual honour for a civil servant. Primrose was, like his cousin Lord Rosebery, a chronic insomniac, and suffered from depression as a result. On the morning of 17 June 1923 he was found to have shot himself in Kensington Gardens (he lived nearby at 44 Ennismore Gardens); he was taken to St George's Hospital, where he died almost immediately.<br>
