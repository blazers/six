<span class="headword">Ste Barbe <span class="st"> [Sancta Barbara]</span>,  William  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1080&#150;1152), <span class="occ">bishop of Durham</span>, had obscure antecedents. He was presumably a Norman from Ste Barbe-en-Auge in Calvados (<i>arrondissement</i> of Lisieux, canton of M&eacute;zidon). He occurs at York as clerk and canon during the 1120s in the entourage of Archbishop Thurstan (<i>d</i>. 1140); about 1135 he became dean of York, presiding as such in June 1141 when William Fitzherbert (<i>d</i>. 1154) was chosen to succeed Thurstan. The reforming monastic prelates in the province, convinced that royal interference had imposed an improper candidate, fiercely impugned Fitzherbert's election. In March 1143 Pope Innocent II (<i>r</i>. 1130&#150;43) decreed that its validity was to depend on Ste Barbe's swearing that it had been canonical; he had not made this oath by February 1146, when Eugenius III (<i>r</i>. 1145&#150;53) suspended Fitzherbert.<br>
<br>The political overtones to this imbroglio reflected the need of King Stephen to control the northern sees during the civil war, for David, king of Scots, the ally of the Empress Matilda, reinforcing his acquisitions in England north of Tyne, had in 1139 secured the earldom of Northumberland for his son Henry. When Bishop Geoffrey Rufus of Durham died on 6 May 1141, the Scots tried to intrude David's chancellor, William Cumin (<i>d</i>. 1160), as his successor, and Cumin immediately seized Durham Castle and the bishopric's temporal resources. But a pertinacious local opposition, headed by Prior Roger of Durham and Archdeacon Ranulf (the nephew of Bishop Ranulf Flambard) persuaded Innocent II to order a free election, and to enjoin David to stop supporting Cumin. Escaping to York, the Durham electors there chose William de Ste Barbe as bishop on 14 March 1143, while he was absent attending the legatine council in London that excommunicated Cumin. Ste Barbe was consecrated in Winchester Cathedral on 20 June, and in August made his way to his diocese. At first he was sheltered at Bishopton, north-east of Darlington, by Roger de Conyers, the constable of the bishopric, and then moved to St Giles's Church at Durham; but Cumin's men were too strong, and Ste Barbe withdrew, first to Bishopton, then to a fortress at Thornley, near Kelloe, a few miles south-east of Durham, and finally to Lindisfarne. His difficulties in his bishopric caused him to excuse himself from the consecration of Fitzherbert in late September. Only on 18 October 1144, after gradually winning over Earl Henry and the local lay barons, could Ste Barbe be enthroned in Durham by Fitzherbert; it had been a savage struggle, though lurid partisan denunciations of Cumin's atrocities are probably exaggerated.<br>
<br>Henceforward Ste Barbe depended on the sometimes exigent tolerance of the Scots, who still dominated the area politically. When it came to electing a successor to the deposed Archbishop Fitzherbert at Richmond in the North Riding on 24 July 1147, Bishop William opted for Henry Murdac (<i>d</i>. 1153), favourite of the Yorkshire reformers, against King Stephen's candidate, though his ability to involve himself in the York election dispute was limited by the depredations of Earl William of York (<i>d</i>. 1179). Ste Barbe's episcopacy was continuously troubled by local disorders, and he failed to attend the Council of Rheims, for which he was suspended by the pope. It was presumably Archbishop Murdac who released him from his suspension; grants to the Cistercians of Newminster and Augustinians of Guisborough, made &#145;at the intervention&#146; of Eugenius III, show Ste Barbe opening his diocese to the influence of reformed monasticism, apparently to the alarm of the monks of Durham. Seventeen <i>acta</i> survive from his episcopate, not all of them free from later tampering. Recording such acts as the settlement of a dispute over precedence between the prior and the archdeacon of Durham, a grant of land in Sherburn to the Durham hospital of St Mary Magdalen, and the dedication of the church of Finchale, they help to explain how, when he died on 13 November 1152, the bishop was in good repute for charity, learning, and prudence. However, a politically ineffective figure, Ste Barbe was less notable for those masterful qualities demanded by the circumstances of his exposed see.<br>
