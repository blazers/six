<span class="headword">Lonsdale,  William</span>  (1794&#150;1871), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, youngest son of William Lonsdale (1742&#150;1813), a silk mercer from Skipton, Yorkshire, and his wife, Mary Wagstaffe (1745?&#150;1832) of Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire, was born on 8 September 1794, probably in Bath, where he spent his early years. In February 1810 he was commissioned, without purchase, as ensign in the 4th (King's Own) regiment of foot. He served at Salamanca in 1812 and Waterloo in 1815, but soon afterwards, as a retired lieutenant on half pay, he returned to Bath.<br>
<br>By chance, Lonsdale became interested in Bath's geology, which William Smith (1769&#150;1839) had there made so popular. He began by working out the sequence of the strata and collecting, examining, and identifying their associated minerals and fossils. His appointment as the first honorary curator of the Bath Literary and Philosophical Institution in 1825, and his personal donation of over 1000 geological specimens to its museum collections, testify to his growing reputation for preparing, labelling, and cataloguing accessions. Described by his early acquaintance Roderick Impey Murchison, as a &#145;tall, grave man with a huge hammer on his shoulder&#146;  (A. Geikie, <span class="italic">Life of Sir Roderick I. Murchison</span>, 1875, 1.128), Lonsdale the fossil-hunter daily advanced his geological studies during the 6 mile return walk from his mother's Batheaston home to his work in Bath.<br>
<br>Lonsdale's 1827 report &#145;On the occurrence of galena in the Inferior Oolite&#146; [near Frome] (<span class="italic">Philosophical Magazine</span>, 2, 1827, 234&#150;5) resulted from his enquiries into the forces governing deposition of ore in Carboniferous Limestone as compared with other strata. He believed that the age formerly assigned to these metallic veins was &#145;too remote&#146; and with better knowledge of the unconformable superposition of rocks, similar finds could be expected in more recent secondary formations. He next earned high praise for his definitive geological colouring of areas of the midland counties on Ordnance Survey maps, and greater recognition, in February 1829, for his paper &#145;On the oolitic district of Bath&#146; (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Geological Society of London</span>, 3, 1835, 241&#150;75). This was the first comprehensive analysis of the classic Bath area, within a 70 mile radius of the city. Lonsdale described the sequence of the strata from the Lias to the Lower Chalk and their associated fossils, and complemented six geologically coloured sections with descriptive tables of organic remains featuring only those specimens which he had personally collected and identified.<br>
<br>Lonsdale was elected fellow of the Geological Society of London in June 1829 and, later that year, appointed as its curator, librarian, and indexer; in this capacity he found himself carrying out nearly all the work which had previously fallen on the honorary secretaries. In 1832 he was first awarded the society's Wollaston fund, to extend his investigation of the oolites to the southern boundaries of Warwickshire and Oxfordshire. He determined the Stonesfield Slate's position as in the lower part of the Great Oolite and defined the &#145;Cotteswold&#146; hills escarpment as a prolongation and much expanded layer of the Inferior Oolite. In March 1840, Lonsdale's &#145;Notes on the age of the limestones of south Devonshire&#146; (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Geological Society of London</span>, 2nd ser., 5, 1840, 721&#150;38) showed they had often been assigned to the transition series but that their similarity in character with the Old Red Sandstone had been noticed by various field workers. In December 1837, Lonsdale had proved that &#145;shells resembling or identical with mountain-limestone species &hellip; Silurian corals, the <i>Calceola sandalina</i>, and various distinct Testacea&#146; were all present in these beds. This showed that the south Devonshire limestones were &#145;of an intermediate age between the Carboniferous and Silurian systems, and consequently of the age of the Old Red Sandstone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Geological Society of London</span>, 2nd ser., 5, 1840, 727). Lonsdale thereby played a significant role in the introduction of the new Devonian system.<br>
<br>Lonsdale's advice was constantly sought both for identifying fossils and editing manuscripts and his role as mentor is exemplified by his relationship with Charles Darwin, whom he greatly assisted in the study of corals. Six species from the Palaeozoic formation of Van Diemen's Land were described by Lonsdale in an appendix to Darwin's book on volcanic islands, published in 1844. Problems caused by persistent ill health, however, forced Lonsdale into early retirement from the geological society in 1842, but the gift of more than &pound;600 from his friends at the society allowed him to continue his studies in the west country while looking for a healthy place to live. In 1844 he again received the Wollaston fund to aid his research, and in 1846 he was awarded the fund, and now the Wollaston medal, for his contributions to geological science in describing Silurian and Devonian corals and for his papers, &#145;Corals from the Tertiary formation of North America&#146; and &#145;Corals from the Palaeozoic formations of Russia&#146;. Finally rewarded with a fourth Wollaston fund in 1849, Lonsdale produced a memorandum respecting <i>Choristopetalum impar</i> and <i>Cyathophora? elegans</i> (<span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London</span>, 7, 1851, 113&#150;17), and a note on the genus <i>Lithostrotion</i> (<span class="italic">Annals of Natural History</span>, 8, 1851, 451&#150;77), both papers reflecting his concentration on physical and taxonomic differentiation between genera and species. Lonsdale's unpublished <i>magnum opus</i> featuring the Palaeozoic tabulate corals, &#145;<i>Alveolites</i>, <i>Favosites</i>, and <i>Heliolites</i>&#146;, reveals the facility with which he had interpreted the languages of science in conjunction with his own work, either to endorse or to challenge orthodox opinion. As an evolutionist and pioneer of microscopy, every aspect of geological determination was important to him. He was aware of the effects which &#145;permanent alteration in the inhabiting medium&#146;  (Lonsdale MSS, Bath RO) might have on the form and size of a shell or coral, and he knew that every factor which might affect the development of animal life had to be taken into account before the distribution of species could be properly judged. Stratigraphy, Lonsdale believed, should be based on evidence derived not only from fossils, but also from order of superposition, mineral composition, and lithological structure. His own work on stratigraphy, taxonomy, and corals constituted an outstanding and invaluable gift to geological science. Lonsdale, who never married, died of tuberculosis on 10 November 1871, at his home, 12 City Road, Bristol, and was buried four days later at Arnos Vale cemetery.<br>
