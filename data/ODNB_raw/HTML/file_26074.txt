<span class="headword">Sowerby,  James De Carle</span>  (1787&#150;1871), <span class="occ">naturalist and artist</span>, was born in London on 5 June 1787, the eldest of the nine children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26073/', "James Sowerby (1757&#150;1822)")</script>, botanical artist, and his wife, Anne de Carle (1764&#150;1815). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26070/', "George Brettingham Sowerby the first")</script> was his younger brother. He was educated at home by private tutors, but in science was largely self-taught with the help of his father's scientist contacts. He was attracted to chemistry and mineralogy and conducted his own analytical experiments encouraged by Faraday, Humphry Davy (under whom he studied with Faraday), and Wollaston, in whose house he was a welcome visitor. He is said independently to have proposed the classification of minerals according to their chemical composition and also to have supplied the analyses of many minerals described in his father's mineralogical works. Accompanying his father on field excursions around London, he also acquired a knowledge of natural history.<br>
<br>James De Carle Sowerby soon became involved in his family's publications. In his teens he was sent to organize and utilize the collections of other naturalists and to teach drawing and etching to their families. His earliest published illustrations appeared in Dawson Turner's <span class="italic">Muscologiae Hibernicae spicilegium</span> (1804), and he described many of the fossils illustrated in the <span class="italic">Mineral Conchology</span> (1812&#150;46). On 25 September 1813 he married Mary Edwards (1786&#150;1852); all their eight children were born while the family lived in Lambeth.<br>
<br>Writing to Dawson Turner, James De Carle Sowerby explained the progression of the family's publications:<blockquote>we go on in the old plodding way, the vegetables of our country being exhausted, we must live upon the rocks, with a few shells for a treat now and then, or any thing else that comes in our way. (J. de C. Sowerby to D. Turner, 23 Feb 1816, Dawson Turner MSS)</blockquote>James De Carle Sowerby inherited the family business with his brother Charles Edward on their father's death in 1822, and the two went into partnership. Although solely responsible for <span class="italic">Mineral Conchology</span>, Sowerby assisted Charles with the other periodicals until the partnership was dissolved in 1831. Even later he was to supply many plates and some text for the supplement to <span class="italic">English Botany</span> (1831&#150;49). However, the majority of Sowerby's time was soon devoted to describing and illustrating material for leading geologists, including Sedgwick, Murchison, Buckland, and Fitton, who employed him to deal with their fossils. Between the 1820s and the 1860s he also produced illustrations for monographs, books, and papers on many other subjects, ranging from anatomical plates in veterinary journals to the engravings of turtles in Bell's <span class="italic">Monograph of the Testudinata</span> (1836&#150;41). A few descriptive papers in the <span class="italic">Zoological Journal</span> and others, or notes in periodicals, were all that he published under his own name.<br>
<br>In 1838, with his cousin Phillip Barnes, James De Carle Sowerby founded the Royal Botanic Gardens at Regent's Park, becoming its first secretary, a post he held until retirement in 1869. However, the garden, intended to be a public establishment for the general study of the vegetable kingdom, became merely a stage for London's fashionable society and earned the name &#145;Royal Botanical Humbug&#146; from the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Gazette</span>. In 1846 Sowerby was appointed librarian and curator of the Geological Society, on &#145;partial duty&#146; to enable him to retain his post at Regent's Park. He resigned in 1848 when the salary was limited to &pound;50. He became a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1823 and was a founder member of the Zoological Society in 1826. The Geological Society awarded him the Wollaston fund in 1840.<br>
<br>A generous nature and financial needs led to James De Carle Sowerby's undertaking too many commitments. His work at the Botanical Society led to considerable delay to every publication with which he was involved. Lindley, Bell, and Darwin were among those who suffered, with the last complaining &#145;I did not know how dreadfully dilatory he was when I picked him out as most capable of doing the work&#146;  (Burkhardt and Smith, 367). Darwin eventually turned to his nephew G. B. Sowerby the second to complete the task. The irregularity of the Sowerbys' <span class="italic">Mineral Conchology</span> was a factor that led to the formation of the Palaeontographical Society in 1847, but such was Sowerby's expertise that the society often found itself employing him to illustrate and produce engravings for its monographs, in spite of his reputation.<br>
<br>In 1861 James De Carle Sowerby sold the Sowerby collection to the British Museum. He stopped working at the Royal Botanic Gardens in 1867 through ill health, declaring &#145;I feel the effects of age and am growing very feeble&#146;  (J. De C. Sowerby, letter, 27 Dec 1867, Sowerby archive, London, Natural History Museum). He retired officially in 1869 and died on 26 August 1871 at his home, 18 St George's Road, Kilburn.<br>
<br>James De Carle Sowerby was arguably the most prolific and accomplished member of the Sowerby family, and although responsible for the description of many taxa, his main contribution to natural history had been &#145;the portraits of natural objects he has left behind him &hellip; delineated faithfully from &hellip; acquaintance with their form and structure&#146;  (W. Sowerby, cited in Simpkins, 393), &#145;which no pencil or burin, but those of a scientific artist could possibly accomplish&#146;  (Buckland). An obituarist described him as: &#145;Gentle, earnest, conscientious, ever ready to help others out of his wealth of knowledge, Mr Sowerby's name will be remembered with affection and reverence by all who knew him. His was a truly blameless and useful life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>).<br>
