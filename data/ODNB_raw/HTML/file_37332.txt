<span class="headword">Cunliffe,  Walter</span>, first Baron Cunliffe  (1855&#150;1920), <span class="occ">merchant banker and governor of the Bank of England</span>, was born on 3 December 1855 at 29 Kensington Gate, London, the eldest of the four sons and second of the six children of Roger Cunliffe (<i>d</i>. 1895), of Tyrrell's Wood, Leatherhead, merchant banker, and his wife, Anne Edge. He was educated at Harrow School, where he was in the shooting eleven, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won the inter-university mile race in 1877&#151;he earned a half-blue for running&#151;and took a second-class ordinary degree in 1878. He then spent two years travelling widely and working as a stockman in Queensland, Australia, before returning to England and taking up a career in the City. In 1890 he and his two brothers Arthur and Leonard founded the merchant bank Cunliffe Brothers, with offices in Cornhill. On his father's death in 1895 he came into a substantial fortune and his estate in Surrey; indeed, the City believed him to be a millionaire. This fortune should have increased both his ability to do business and the stature of his house. Nevertheless, Cunliffe Bros. was never a front-rank firm, and on 1 January 1920&#151;five days before his death&#151;it was absorbed by the merchant bank Fr&uuml;hling and Goschen, which became the new house of Goschen and Cunliffe (which failed in December 1939).<br>
<br>Cunliffe's enduring reputation rests on his activities as governor of the Bank of England, on his chairmanship of the eponymous Cunliffe committee of 1918, and on his membership of the reparations commission of the British delegation to the Versailles peace conference in 1919. He became a director of the bank in 1895, deputy governor in 1911, and succeeded as governor in 1913. There were two decisive occasions during his period in office, one of which made his reputation and authority, the other of which badly damaged both. The first was after the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, when the clearing banks refused or rationed gold sovereigns to their customers; the stock exchange was in turmoil, and bankruptcy threatened the merchant banks because their acceptance credits could not be repaid. Cunliffe successfully argued against the suspension of gold payments; he agreed that the bank would discount all outstanding bills of exchange (with the government standing the financial risk), which calmed the money market; and he placed guards at the doors of enemy banks to prevent removal of foreign securities. Cunliffe thereby gained great authority as governor of the bank, and he was asked to stay on beyond the normal two-year term, to retire only in March 1918.<br>
<br>But this authority increased the autocratic and aggressive, even bullying, tendencies of Cunliffe's character, and hubris brought nemesis. The bank traditionally controlled policy on exchange rates, but the Treasury's greatly increased spending overseas had encouraged an increasing interest in maintaining the rate of the pound. The bank and the Treasury were agreed on this, but Cunliffe, who had great contempt for Treasury officials, grew suspicious of the means by which the Treasury was financing its overseas purchases. In July 1917, during a period of turmoil in British financing abroad, he cabled the Bank of Canada in Ottawa, where some of the British reserves were held, ignoring the instructions of the Treasury. The chancellor, Andrew Bonar Law, was incandescent, and Cunliffe's friendship with the prime minister, David Lloyd George, did not prevent his being forced to put his resignation into the chancellor's hands. His imminent retirement was announced in November 1917.<br>
<br>In 1918 Cunliffe nevertheless chaired the commission on currency and foreign exchanges, the first report of which dealt with the means whereby the gold standard could be maintained. His influence on the commission on the reparation of damage at the Versailles conference was irresponsible: he spoke of German payments of $120 billion, while J. M. Keynes of the Treasury put the German capacity to pay at $10 billion. Cunliffe knew little of Germany and admitted that his figure &#145;was little more than a shot in the dark as he had been pressed to arrive at it between a Saturday and a Monday&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He ultimately insisted on a lower but still astronomical figure (leading him and his British colleague on the commission, Lord Sumner, to be dubbed &#145;the heavenly twins&#146;). This was his final public service.<br>
<br>Cunliffe was twice married: first in 1890 to Mary Agnes (<i>d</i>. 1893), younger daughter of Robert Henderson, a merchant, of Randalls Park, Leatherhead; and second in 1896, to Edith Cunningham, fifth daughter of Colonel Robert Tod Boothby of St Andrews. There were three sons and three daughters of the second marriage. Cunliffe was created baron in 1914 and GBE in 1917, and he received several foreign orders.<br>
<br>&#145;Over six feet tall, of broad physique and rolling gait, with imposing features and a walrus moustache&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), Cunliffe could appear a rock when reassurance of strength was needed, as in July&#150;August 1914. His pleasures were traditional: he hunted and fished, shot game large and small, and farmed as a gentleman should; he was also a connoisseur of silver and antiques. No one called him clever: he frequently reacted by emotion and intuition rather than after thought and &#145;had the advantage of knowing his own mind, perhaps not a very difficult one to know&#146;  (Sayers, 66). Usually laconic, gruff with most, he could be jovial with friends. He was a director of the North-Eastern Railway from 1905 and of the P. &amp; O. Line from November 1919. Cunliffe died of septicaemia after ten days' illness at his home, Headley Court, Epsom, Surrey, on 6 January 1920. He was succeeded, as second baron, by his son Rolf (1899&#150;1963).<br>
