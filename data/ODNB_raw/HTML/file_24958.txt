<span class="headword">Scrope,  Henry</span>, first Baron Scrope of Masham  (1312?&#150;1392), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was born on 29 September, probably in 1312 (the inquisitions taken after his father's death give his age variously, between twenty-five and twenty-eight &#145;and more&#146;). He was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24955/', "Geoffrey Scrope")</script> and his first wife, Ivetta, most likely the daughter of William Roos. He was first armed in the Scottish campaign of 1333; he was knighted before Berwick, and fought at Halidon Hill. He served in Scotland again in 1335, and in 1340 took part in the sea battle at Sluys. His father died in that year, and he obtained livery of his inheritance in March 1341. In 1342 he was in Brittany, and was present at the sieges of Vannes and Morlaix. During the justiciarship of Ralph Ufford (1344&#150;6) he saw service in Ireland. He was in Flanders, with Edward III in 1345, and in 1346 (according to depositions at the <i>Scrope v. Grosvenor</i> trial in 1386) he fought as a banneret both at Cr&eacute;cy (26 August) and at Nevilles Cross (17 October). In 1347 he was at the siege of Calais; and in 1350 he fought in the great sea battle off Winchelsea, known as Espagnols-sur-mer.<br>
<br>In November 1350 Henry Scrope was for the first time summoned individually to parliament as Lord Scrope (the designation &#145;of Masham&#146; appears after 1371, when his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24963/', "Richard Scrope")</script> of Bolton was summoned, to distinguish the branches of the family). After this his position became more prominent. In 1354 he was one of the ambassadors to Innocent VI seeking to arbitrate between England and France. He served on Edward III's Picard expedition in 1355, and at the siege of Berwick in 1357; and in August 1357 he was a member of the commission to treat with the Scots for the liberation of David II, king of Scots, and for a truce. In 1359 he served under John of Gaunt in the great <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i> toward Rheims, and in 1361 he was appointed to the important post of warden of Calais and Gu&icirc;nes, which he seems to have held, officially, until 1370. He also served on a number of important diplomatic missions, including those which treated (unsuccessfully) for a marriage between Edmund of Langley, Edward III's fifth son, and Margaret, daughter of the count of Flanders (1362 and 1364). In 1369 he served, at the reopening of the war, under John of Gaunt in France; and in 1370&#150;71 he was for a year warden of the western march towards Scotland. From January to November 1371 he was also steward of the king's household. During the Good Parliament of 1376 he was one of the peers on the committee that the Commons requested to advise and &#145;intercommune&#146; with them  (<span class="italic">RotP</span>, 2.322). In October 1377 he was named in parliament as a member of the first &#145;continual&#146; council of Richard II's minority. He served at this period on a number of significant commissions in Yorkshire and Northumberland, the last important ones being those to preserve the peace and put down rebels in Yorkshire (14 December 1381 and 8 March 1382). His later years seem to have been spent in retirement on his estates; although Gilbert Talbot in his deposition in <i>Scrope v. Grosvenor</i> alleged that he served in Scotland in 1383 and 1385, this is unconfirmed, and probably arises from a confusion with his cousin Richard Scrope. He died on 31 July 1392.<br>
<br>Henry Scrope enjoyed a high reputation as a warrior, as a tourneyer, and later as a councillor and administrator. In his early years his principal connection seems to have been with William de Bohun, earl of Northampton, in whose retinue he served in 1333, 1340, 1342, 1346, 1347, and 1355. Later his most important connection seems to have been with John of Gaunt, under whom he served in 1359 and 1369, though he was less intimately associated with him than his contemporary and cousin Richard Scrope of Bolton. As arms he bore the famous family coat, azure a bend or, with a label of three points argent for a difference. He was married twice, first to Agnes and second to Joan; the surnames in both cases are uncertain. With Joan he had five sons; Geoffrey, who was killed on crusade in Prussia (1362); William, who fought against the Turks at Satalia (1361) and died in the East; Stephen, who likewise went on crusade and who ultimately succeeded him; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24964/', "Richard Scrope")</script>, who rose to be archbishop of York and was executed in 1405; and John. He had two daughters, Joan, who married Henry, Lord Fitzhugh, and Isabel, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59062/', "Sir Robert Plumpton (1341&#150;1407)")</script> of Plumpton [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52793/', "Plumpton family (per. c.1165&#150;c.1550)")</script>].<br>
