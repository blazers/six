<span class="headword">Pocock,  (Henry) Roger Ashwell</span>  (1865&#150;1941), <span class="occ">adventurer and writer</span>, was born on 9 November 1865 at 4 Belle Vue, Tenby, Pembrokeshire, the son of Captain Charles Ashwell Botelar Pocock (1829&#150;1899), naval officer and later Anglican deacon, and his wife, Sarah Margaret (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1887), fifth daughter of Captain James Agnes Stevens RN. She was proud of her seafaring family which included Captain Sir Christopher Cole (1770&#150;1837). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30476/', "Lena Margaret Pocock, known as Lena Ashwell, Lady Simson (1872&#150;1957)")</script>, actress and theatre manager, was Roger Pocock's sister, and Nicholas Pocock (1740&#150;1821), marine painter, was his great-uncle.<br>
<br>Roger Pocock's father had distinguished himself when a mate in the Second Anglo-Burmese War (1852&#150;3) but he had to retire from the Royal Navy because of his eyesight. For reasons of economy the family moved frequently until about 1872 Charles Pocock became captain of the <i>Wellesley</i>, a training ship for boys &#145;unconvicted of crime&#146;, at the mouth of the Tyne. About 1880 his health broke down, and he emigrated with his family to Canada, where he was ordained an Anglican deacon; he moved to Switzerland after his wife's death about 1887 and then to London.<h2>
<a name="CanadatheKlondikeandtheSouthAfricanWar"></a>Canada, the Klondike, and the South African War</h2>Roger Pocock's boyhood was spent partly on the <i>Wellesley</i>. He attended Ludlow grammar school, where he was bullied; he later wrote: &#145;I survived, but with broken nerve, a coward&#146;  (R. Pocock, <span class="italic">A Frontiersman</span>, 1). As &#145;the penniless son of a half-pay captain&#146;  (ibid., 2)&#151;his father left just &pound;305 on his death in 1899&#151;the professions were closed to him. He worked as a clerk at the Submarine Telegraph Company, London, but, aged fifteen, was dismissed as &#145;useless&#146;. He went with his family to Canada, where he attended agricultural college, worked as a life assurance clerk, then had various jobs&#151;according to his autobiography survey assistant, hotel &#145;boots&#146;, railway navvy, salesman&#151;and was destitute, at Port Arthur, Thunder Bay, and elsewhere. In November 1884 he enlisted at Winnipeg in the North-West Mounted Police, and in 1885 he served against the north-west uprising in Manitoba. His feet were frostbitten and right toes amputated, so in 1886 he was honourably discharged with a pension. He travelled in the Canadian wilds and worked as an Anglican missionary among the Gaetkshians in the Skeena Valley, British Columbia. Contrary to his autobiography, he was not invited to train for holy orders, as the church authorities were concerned that his interest in Indian women was more than pastoral. He left British Columbia in 1889, and again travelled and had a succession of jobs, mostly in Canada and the United States. He was back in London before the 1897 jubilee.<br>
<br>In January 1898 Pocock organized from his London rooms an expedition to the Klondike at the time of the gold rush, and advertised in <span class="italic">The Times</span> for participants. The expedition started from Ashcroft, British Columbia, and on 10 June 1898 was at the Mud River, when Sir Arthur Curtis, third baronet, of Gatcombe, offended by Pocock, left camp and disappeared. Searches failed to find him and he was subsequently presumed dead (allegedly his wife was involved with another man and he may have tried to stage a disappearance and start a new life, but got lost and died). Pocock, ill, returned to England. Rumour spread, and there were suggestions in the press that he had murdered Curtis for his money. This long tainted Pocock's reputation, though available evidence suggests that he probably was not guilty. He went back to writing books and &#145;sold a lot of rotten ideas for a lot of rotten money&#146;  (R. Pocock, <span class="italic">A Frontiersman</span>, 226). Determined to &#145;make a record in horsemanship&#146;  (ibid.) or die in the attempt, from June 1899 to January 1900 he rode 3600 miles from Canada to Mexico, meeting various outlaws.<br>
<br>In 1901, during the South African War, Pocock went by tramp steamer to South Africa, landing at Durban in December. He enlisted in an irregular unit which in his autobiography he called Sutler's scouts (in fact, Butler's scouts), and which he described as disreputable and rascally, &#145;the complete cynosure of every unsoldierly quality&#146;  (R. Pocock, <span class="italic">A Frontiersman</span>, 294), and served until it was paid off in December 1901. In January 1902 he joined the national scouts (Boers fighting on the British side) and served warily as a corporal, surviving enteric fever and a &#145;death trap&#146; military hospital, until the end of the war. He returned to London, and in 1904 visited Greenland. Later in that year he reported on Russia for the <span class="italic">Illustrated Mail</span>, a weekly companion paper to the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. He also obtained photographs of Russian warships and plans of the Libau naval base. This led to a positive relationship between him and Prince Louis of Battenberg, then director of naval intelligence.<h2>
<a name="TheLegionofFrontiersmen"></a>The Legion of Frontiersmen</h2>In December 1904, through a letter to leading newspapers, Pocock initiated the Legion of Frontiersmen, his greatest achievement. One of the varied responses to the South African War, the perceived German threat, and other anxieties about the British and imperial future, the legion was formally established in 1905 and was granted a grudging and limited form of official recognition by the war secretary, Lord Haldane, in February 1906. It was a patriotic, imperialist, apolitical, volunteer, part-time, armed, uniformed auxiliary force in Britain, the dominions, and elsewhere, &#145;a civilian, self-supporting, and self-governing Association &hellip; for the service of the State [of] men of good character, who have been trained in wild countries, at sea or in war &hellip; for home defence and &hellip; imperial defence&#146;  (R. Pocock, <span class="italic">Pocket-Book</span>, v), and, in the words of Pocock's 1904 letter, &#145;a unit for field intelligence in peace and war&#146;  (G. A. Pocock, 4). Its executive council was composed largely of establishment &#145;grandees&#146;&#151;the fifth earl of Lonsdale was president, and Pocock commissioner. He used his press contacts to gain favourable publicity. Supporters included Lord Meath and Conservative MPs, and members included H. A. Gwynne, Edgar Wallace, William Le Queux, and various colonial frontiersmen, suburban would-be frontiersmen, swashbucklers, and retired officers. By 1908 there were reportedly about 3500 members. The cost of uniform and equipment precluded working-class members. The uniform was a variant of the garb&#151;already redolent of adventure&#151;worn on the turbulent frontiers of white settlement from Texas to Rhodesia: stetson, neckerchief, loose shirt, breeches, boots, gunbelt, and revolver (anyone, even a child, could then legally buy and own a revolver and ammunition). The legion trained for war and also, apparently much influenced by Le Queux, hunted for German spies. Pocock and others in the legion intelligence branch, &#145;the Legion invisible&#146;  (R. Pocock, <span class="italic">Chorus</span>, 50), were convinced of the German spy threat and gathered information on alleged German airship construction and other activities in Britain, passing it to naval and military intelligence.<br>
<br>However, Pocock himself was controversial. He was not wealthy, he lacked social and military status, and to some he seemed of dubious character. The majority of the legion council&#151;with Sir William Serjeant, barrister and volunteer officer, prominent among them&#151;came to consider him unsuitable and wanted to exclude him, and they were backed by the more establishment and military members. Reportedly the War Office and some leading legion members considered him a German spy. The &#145;range men&#146; tended to support him. He believed the legion had been infiltrated by German spies who were conspiring to remove him, and he struggled to retain office. In 1908 he was replaced as chief executive officer by Major Patrick William Forbes, the &#145;conqueror of Rhodesia&#146;, and in July 1909, at an acrimonious general meeting, he was expelled from the legion. No secession followed, even close friends remaining, and the legion prospered, reportedly reaching 17,500 men in August 1914, despite War Office distrust and some press criticism. H. G. Wells, for example, alleged that they were equipped not for possible war in Europe but for Arizona in 1890.<br>
<br>Pocock apparently influenced Baden-Powell in the formation of the Boy Scouts. In <span class="italic">Scouting for Boys</span> Baden-Powell recommended Pocock's <span class="italic">Frontiersman's Pocket-Book</span>, and in 1908 Pocock contributed to the first issue of <span class="italic">The Scout</span>. Also in 1908 he helped to make a short cowboy film, <span class="italic">A Texas Elopement</span>, by the Thames at Shepperton. In 1913 he rode through the Rockies with Randle William Cecil, a grandson of the third marquess of Salisbury.<br>
<br>In the First World War the Legion of Frontiersmen formed in Britain the 25th Royal Fusiliers (Frontiersmen) and in Canada the 210th (Frontiersmen) battalion and fought with great distinction. Pocock was not with them. In 1914 he was eager to serve but over age, physically impaired, and short-sighted, and he was repeatedly rejected by army units. He finally managed to enlist, was promoted corporal, and served as orderly-room clerk. Through a legion contact he was appointed quartermaster-sergeant, then lieutenant (later acting captain), in Warwickshire Territorial Royal Horse Artillery batteries training in England. In 1917 he commanded the 178th labour company in Flanders; he later described his seven months at the Ypres salient as &#145;the greatest adventure in a varied life&#146;  (R. Pocock, <span class="italic">Chorus</span>, 177). He wrote for a bureau of press propaganda, and in 1918 served as an RAF administrative officer until the end of the war.<h2>
<a name="Laterlifeandwritings"></a>Later life and writings</h2>After the war, now calling himself Captain Pocock, he again mixed travel, journalism, and book-writing. He sailed on fishing vessels, failed in a business to manufacture fishskin leather, and went as cook on the 1921 Oxford University Spitsbergen expedition. With other legion men he sailed in 1923 on the steam yacht <i>Frontiersman</i> to support a planned world flight. There was insufficient financial backing and the vessel was impounded and sold in California. He stayed on there, proud to be made a member of the Adventurers' Club of Los Angeles. He worked as an actor and in partnership with a very small independent producer in Hollywood, &#145;that moral slum&#146;  (R. Pocock, <span class="italic">Chorus</span>, 293). He returned to England and co-operated with his sister Lena in writing plays. In 1928 he was admitted a pensioner at the Charterhouse, London. Back in the legion and honoured as its founder, in 1935 he made a world tour of Frontiersmen units.<br>
<br>From the 1880s to the 1930s Pocock published books including novels and non-fiction. He edited the legion's <span class="italic">Frontiersman's Pocket-Book</span> (1909), &#145;a brief summary of the art of pioneering and empire-building&#146;  (R. Pocock, <span class="italic">Pocket-Book</span>, vii). His loathing for aspects of &#145;civilization&#146; was expressed in his jeremiad <span class="italic">Rottenness: a Study of America and England</span> (1896), which especially condemned American corruption, crime, and brutality. His two books of autobiography, <span class="italic">A Frontiersman</span> (1903) and <span class="italic">Chorus to Adventurers</span> (1931), were not entirely accurate. Nor was his <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> entry, which claimed he had been a missionary in New Caledonia. Romantic, and arguably a romancer, he portrayed his &#145;life as a lone-wolf adventurer&#146;  (R. Pocock, <span class="italic">Chorus</span>, 2). <span class="italic">Chorus to Adventurers</span> has been considered &#145;the product of an over-heated imagination&#146;  (private information, A. J. A. Morris). His sisters believed him gullible, and he wrote that he was &#145;a fool in practical affairs&#146;  (R. Pocock, <span class="italic">Chorus</span>, 37) and that he and others in the legion counter-espionage &#145;groped in the dark, discovering mares' nests&#146;  (ibid., 50). However, the later allegation that &#145;Pocock inhabited a Walter Mitty world &hellip; full of <span class="italic">Boy's Own Paper</span> villains and heroes&#146;  (Andrew, 78) is arguably exaggerated. Pocock died, unmarried, of bronchopneumonia and chronic bronchitis on 12 November 1941 at Valetta Nursing Home, Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. The Legion of Frontiersmen still continues, but a mere shadow of its strength in its imperial heyday.<br>
