<span class="headword">Simmons,  Samuel</span>  (<em>c.</em>1777&#150;1819), <span class="occ">actor</span>, born in London, first appeared at the Haymarket on 21 September 1785, when, as Master Simmons, he played the Duke of York in Cibber's <span class="italic">Richard III</span> and showed promise. Next he appeared as Tom Thumb, and is said also to have played other juvenile characters at Covent Garden. His first adult role at Covent Garden was on 5 November 1796, when he was the original Momus in John O'Keeffe's <span class="italic">Olympus in an Uproar</span>. Endless in Prince Hoare's <span class="italic">No Song, No Supper</span> followed, and in April 1797 he was the original Premiss, a lawyer, in Hoare's <span class="italic">The Italian Villagers</span>. Simmons remained at Covent Garden until his death, playing such parts as Daniel in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Conscious Lovers</span>, Master Matthew in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Every Man in his Humour</span>, and many roles (chiefly small) in farces which did not survive their own era. He also took many minor parts in Shakespearian plays, such as Feeble in <span class="italic">2 Henry IV</span>, Pistol in <span class="italic">Henry V</span>, Shallow in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>, Lord Sands in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, Peter in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, Stephano in <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>, and Flute in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>. However, he created several original roles in contemporary plays. He was the first Jerry in William Drummond's <span class="italic">Seaside Story</span> (1801), the original Manikin and Squire Supplejack in Dibdin's <span class="italic">The Cabinet</span> and <span class="italic">Family Quarrels</span> respectively, and the original Jonathan Oldskirt and Stubby in Colman's <span class="italic">Who Wants a Guinea?</span> (1805) and <span class="italic">We Fly by Night</span> (1806). In the meantime, about 1803, Simmons married. His wife's name was Margaret. In March 1816 he was the first Bailie Mucklethrift in Daniel Terry's version of <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span>, and in April 1819 the first Saddletree in <span class="italic">The Heart of Midlothian</span>. On 8 September 1819 Simmons played his old part of Moses in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, and died suddenly of apoplexy three days later, on 11 September 1819.<br>
<br>Simmons was a useful, unostentatious actor, to whom very few challenging characters were assigned. His best parts were Mordecai in Charles Macklin's <span class="italic">Love &agrave; la Mode</span>, Master Matthew Fainwou'd in James Kenney's <span class="italic">Raising the Wind</span>, and Alibi in <span class="italic">The Sleep Walker</span>. His exclamation &#145;What do you think of that, eh?&#146; is said to have been a popular catchphrase. He was very natural in his style, which, however, had no great variety. He was a good comic singer, had great freedom of action, and was popular in pantomime. He was very useful in taking at short notice parts for which absent actors had been cast, and in comic waiters and old men showed much genuine and unforced humour with no trace of affectation or extravagance. Though his voice was powerful, Simmons was small in person, and was popularly called &#145;Little Simmons&#146;.<br>
