<span class="headword">Dixon,  William Henry</span>  (1783&#150;1854), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and antiquary</span>, was born at the vicarage house, Wadworth, Yorkshire, on 2 November 1783, son of the Revd Henry Dixon (1750&#150;1820), vicar of Wadworth, and his first wife, Ann, daughter of the Revd William Mason and half-sister to the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18293/', "William Mason")</script>. Dixon later inherited Mason's estates in the East Riding, together with various manuscripts by Mason and Thomas Gray. He attended the grammar schools of Worsborough and Houghton-le-Spring, and in 1801 matriculated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he studied music under Charles Hague. In January 1805 he graduated BA, proceeding MA in 1809, and in 1807 entered into orders. His first curacy was at Tickhill, Yorkshire. On 9 January 1809 he married Mary Ann (<i>d</i>. 1830), daughter of James Fenton of Loversall, Doncaster.<br>
<br>Dixon's first preferment was a canonry of Ripon, to which he was appointed in 1815 by the dean, Robert Waddilove. Thereafter he amassed Yorkshire benefices, mainly in the gift of the York chapter, including Mapleton (1821&#150;4), Wistow and Cawood (1821&#150;4), Topcliffe, and Sutton on the Forest, also holding the prebend of Weighton from 1825. In 1828 Edward Harcourt, archbishop of York, appointed him domestic chaplain, a position he also held under Harcourt's successor, Thomas Musgrave. He became a residentiary canon of York in 1831 and held the livings of Etton and Bishopthorpe, both in the gift of the archbishop, from 1837 until his death. He was considered an able steward of the church's temporalities, improving vicarage houses and rebuilding chancels, and was a supporter of public charities and church schools. As rural dean of York from 1842 he made a personal visitation of every church in his jurisdiction, and maintained good relations with dissenters. His role in the efforts to revive the convocation of York was controversial. Having attended the first such clergy meeting in November 1837, he was president of the next gathering in November 1847 as representative of the dean and chapter of York. In fulfilment of what he considered the wishes of the recently deceased Harcourt, who resisted a revival of convocation's powers, he prorogued the assembly, defending his actions in <span class="italic">Synodus Eboracensis</span> (1848), a reply to criticisms by Robert Wilberforce, archdeacon of the East Riding. Dixon's stand was said to have brought him into conflict with many of his friends.<br>
<br>Dixon was married a second time, on 2 February 1832, to Mary Anne, daughter of Rear-Admiral Hugh Robinson. An accomplished scholar, he devoted his leisure to antiquarian researches, mainly into church history. He was elected FSA in 1821. For several years he worked on extending James Torre's manuscript annals of the members of the cathedral of York. After Dixon's death it was proposed to publish these materials as a memorial to their collator and, after spending a further ten years working on the materials, James Raine (the younger) published a first volume of <span class="italic">Fasti Eboracenses</span> (1863), including the lives of the first forty-three primates of the northern province, ending with John de Thoresby (1373). Dixon died at Minster Yard, York, on 17 February 1854, and was buried in the public cemetery at York, which he had helped to found.<br>
