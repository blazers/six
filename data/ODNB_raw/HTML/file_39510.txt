<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chamberlain <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Garrington]</span>,  Elsie Dorothea</span>  (1910&#150;1991), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and radio broadcaster</span>, was born on 3 March 1910 at 30 Canonbury Park North, Islington, London, the third child of James Arthur Chamberlain (<i>d</i>. 1956), Post Office technician and clerk, and his wife, Annie Maria Hayward (<i>d</i>. 1975), clerk. Her father worked for the Post Office all his life and attended the local Anglican church while his wife, Annie, attended the nearby Congregational chapel in Islington. From her childhood, Elsie Chamberlain was immersed in two divergent ecclesial traditions. After four years at Dame Alice Owen School (1916&#150;20), at ten she attended the Channing School for Girls, a fee-paying Unitarian foundation in Highgate. On leaving school in 1927 she took to dress design and maintained a full life in her local Congregational church. Chamberlain began to learn Hebrew and her minister inspired her to a clerical, nonconformist vocation.<br>
<br>With a view to becoming a Congregational minister, Chamberlain undertook a degree in theology at the (predominantly Anglican) King's College, London (<i>c</i>.1936&#150;1939). During that time Dr Nathaniel Micklem, principal of Mansfield College, Oxford, assured her of a place to undertake two years of pastoral training. A fellow student at King's College was John Leslie St Clair Garrington (1912&#150;1978), soon to be ordained in the Church of England. He was from sound Anglican stock, and in order to marry they had to endure a decade of struggle with church authorities. Her determination to become a minister complicated this relationship. In 1939, instead of going to Oxford University, Chamberlain accepted an offer to assist the Revd Muriel Paulden with her ministry in a rundown part of Liverpool. Then in 1941 she herself was called to be the minister at Christ Church, Friern Barnet, Middlesex. She was soon to be heard at Hyde Park Corner standing her ground with the best of soapbox speakers.<br>
<br>Elsie Chamberlain's friendship, while a theological student at King's College, with Margaret, Lady Stansgate, led to her appointment in 1946 as the first woman chaplain in the RAF. This was much to the irritation of Geoffrey Fisher, archbishop of Canterbury, who warned Viscount Stansgate, secretary of state at the Air Ministry, that &#145;under no conditions&#146; should Church of England personnel &#145;either intentionally or by inadvertence attend Services at which she administers the sacraments&#146;  (Williams, 30). However, very soon severe arthritis struck and Chamberlain left the RAF.<br>
<br>Chamberlain's RAF appointment, while controversial in itself, arose from her impending marriage to John Garrington, then an Anglican curate in Kensington. The bishop of London, William Wand, unfortunately insisted that Garrington was unlikely to secure an incumbency so long as Chamberlain remained as a minister in a &#145;Free Church Pastorate&#146;  (Williams, 41). It was a conflict involving ecumenical relations and the place of women in the church: it was still felt that an Anglican clergyman's wife must devote her life to his ministry. It was also implied that Elsie Chamberlain could not serve two ecclesial masters.<br>
<br>Garrington described their marriage very neatly: &#145;we did it in the teeth of authority&#146;  (Williams, 48). They finally married amid huge publicity on 19 July 1947, Garrington having been appointed vicar of Hampton through the good offices of their supporter and friend Viscount Stansgate. Elsie Chamberlain undertook her role as &#145;vicar's wife&#146; with gusto and enthusiasm. In November 1947 she became part-time minister of a Richmond congregation, combining both tasks: wife and minister across a deep confessional divide. They adopted a daughter, Janette, who later wrote an account of her mother's life.<br>
<br>In 1950 Chamberlain joined the BBC through which she was to become almost a household name. <span class="italic">Lift up your Hearts</span> was a daily morning radio talks programme (later renamed <span class="italic">Thought for the Day</span>) for which she was responsible as producer. Her aim was to &#145;win the ear of the people on the fringes of the Church to whom religion was only a word and not a very interesting word at that!&#146;  (Williams, 62). This was subsequently to be the leitmotif of her missionary endeavour. She was the first ordained woman to lead the <span class="italic">Daily Service</span>, which raised controversial issues for the BBC. However, Elsie Chamberlain resigned from the corporation in 1967. She felt increasingly out of sympathy with the BBC's religious policy, as it shifted away from her &#145;missionary&#146; aims towards analysis rather than advocacy.<br>
<br>While still with the BBC, Chamberlain served in 1956&#150;7 as chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, and was the first woman to hold that post. After leaving the BBC she was on the staff of the City Temple in London (1968&#150;70) with the Revd Kenneth Slack. He was in favour of, but Chamberlain was implacably opposed to, the union of the Congregational church with the English Presbyterians. This eventually took place in 1972 with the creation of the United Reformed church. Although she was subsequently involved with the ecumenical movement Chamberlain nevertheless defended those who wished to continue the ideals of congregationalism. It was therefore fitting that she helped lead the Nottingham-based splinter group, the Congregational Federation, that comprised about 300 independent Congregational churches.<br>
<br>Chamberlain's husband died in 1978 and in 1980 she moved to the west country to take charge of two federation churches, North Street Church in Taunton and the Congregational church in Chumleigh, north Devon. She later settled in Nottingham as warden of the revamped Castle Gate Congregational Church where her energies were directed to &#145;the least of my brethren&#146; in the inner city. She supported women's causes, Amnesty International, and many other humanitarian projects. Her vigour seemed boundless but she fell ill and subsequently died on 10 April 1991 at the University Hospital, Nottingham.<br>
