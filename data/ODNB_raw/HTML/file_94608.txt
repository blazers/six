<span class="headword">Pereira, Sir  (Herbert) Charles</span>  (1913&#150;2004), <span class="occ">hydrologist and agronomist</span>, was born on 12 May 1913 at the City of London Lying-in Hospital, Holborn, London, the only child of Herbert John Pereira (<i>d</i>. 1952), schoolteacher, and his wife, Maud Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Machin. His early education took place at Prince Albert College, Saskatchewan, Canada, on a Cree Indian reservation, where his father ran a small school and a church. It was there that he first experienced living with disadvantaged communities, an experience that influenced the rest of his life and career. At the age of fifteen he returned to London. He completed his education at St Albans School&#151;where he enjoyed science, rugby, and boxing&#151;and thereafter at Imperial College, London, from where he graduated in mathematics and physics. After graduation he was attached to Rothamsted Experimental Station in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, where he studied for a London University PhD, awarded in 1941. He funded his postgraduate studies by part-time teaching and managing the estate of a new school in Chertsey, Surrey. In the school grounds he set up field experiments on the cultivation of potatoes, and diverted water from the school's ornamental lakes to control the water table in his experimental plots. This was probably his first venture into hydrology, the discipline that occupied most of his subsequent professional career.<br>
<br>On 17 July 1941 Pereira married Irene Beatrice (Rene) Sloan, a 26-year-old hospital nurse and daughter of David and May Sloan from Belfast; the couple later had three sons and a daughter. Though happy with the name Charles, to his friends, family, and colleagues Pereira was affectionately known as Perry. From 1941 to 1946 he served in the Royal Engineers. The news that he had been awarded his doctorate arrived just as he was leaving for service in the Middle East. There his hydrology expertise enabled him to find water in the desert for the troops. This&#151;together with his skill in building bridges to enable troop movements in the Italian campaign&#151;earned him the rank of major, and a mention in dispatches. During this period Rene served as an army nursing sister.<br>
<br>After the end of hostilities Pereira joined the colonial service, and went with his wife to Kenya with the remit of building a new coffee research station at Ruiru, near Nairobi. This was a difficult time in east Africa. The British empire was in decline and political and social changes led to Mau Mau terrorism prior to the country's independence. Pereira's scientific research was conducted against this background, but he persevered and also became involved as a leader of the local branch of the Kenya police reserve. His innovative research&#151;ahead of its time and well before the launch of UNESCO's international hydrological decade (1965&#150;74)&#151;led to his appointment as deputy director of the new East African Agriculture and Forestry Research Organisation from 1952 to 1961, and then as director of the Agricultural Research Council of Rhodesia and Nyasaland from 1961 to 1963, a post which terminated when the federation broke up. His research into the hydrological impact of the planting of subsistence crops on hillsides in Tanganyika, of the restoration of over-grazed thorn scrub in northern Uganda, and of tea estates, rain forests, and pine plantations, required the development of new techniques of catchment research and measurement instruments. These pioneering studies of subsistence and commercial crops focused on understanding their water requirements and reflected Pereira's driving ambition to improve food production in the face of growing populations and when starvation and under-nourishment were commonplace. His work was financed with limited resources and he developed the ability to improvise, persevere, and achieve his objectives under conditions which required courage and persistence. Between 1963 and 1967 he was director of the Agricultural Research Council of Central Africa (Rhodesia, Zambia, and Malawi) and in 1966 his work was recognized with the award of the Haile Selassie prize for research in Africa. Following Rhodesia's unilateral declaration of independence in 1965 Pereira was for a short period director of the Malawi Agricultural Research Council with the responsibility of establishing it as a national entity. He then went on a six-month world tour as chairman of the United Nations Land Use Commission of the international hydrological decade.<br>
<br>After twenty-three years in Africa, Pereira returned to England in 1967. During a sabbatical year at Cambridge he wrote <span class="italic">Land Use and Water Resources</span> (published in 1973). His other major publications were <span class="italic">Hydrological Effects of Land Use Changes in East Africa</span> (1962) and <span class="italic">Policy and Practice in the Management of Tropical Watersheds</span> (1969), together with many papers in research journals. His methods of conducting hydrological research on the scale of whole catchment areas were still valid and in use in the early twenty-first century. In 1969 he was appointed director of the Agricultural Research Council's East Malling research station in Kent, an institution renowned throughout the world for its work on fruit crops. Pereira retired from that post in 1972 to become chief scientist and deputy secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food, a position he held for five years. At this time a revolution in science funding was underway, and Pereira's task was to implement Lord Rothschild's &#145;customer&#150;contractor relationship&#146; to draw scientists closer to the users of research. Pereira's scientific acumen and administrative skills were in great demand in this period. He held several key appointments, becoming a member of the Natural Environment Research Council from 1971 to 1977, a member of the Agricultural Research Council (1973&#150;7), chairman of the scientific panel of the Commonwealth Development Corporation (1978&#150;91), president of the Tropical Agricultural Association (1990&#150;2002), and a member of the board of trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (1983&#150;6). As president of the Tropical Agriculture Association he maintained an active network of members whose experience spanned the developing world. He retired from the ministry in 1977 and was knighted in the same year. His work had previously been recognized with election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1969&#151;which, in his own words, gave him &#145;a feeling of incredulous euphoria&#146;&#151;and as a fellow of the Institute of Biology, and of the Royal Agricultural Society of England (both in 1977); he also received an honorary doctorate from Cranfield University in the year of his departure from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food. His other achievements and interests included learning to fly a Cessna 172 aircraft to carry out aerial surveys, learning the Kiswahili language (which he did during his first outward sea journey to Africa), and mountaineering (he was elected president of the Mountain Club of Kenya).<br>
<br>On leaving his post as chief scientist at the ministry Pereira spent much of the next fifteen years undertaking a series of demanding overseas consultancies. He also enjoyed solving problems, energetic sports, ballroom dancing, and landscape sketching. He had a lifelong concern with the rapidly expanding human population and its effects on the environment and its ability to provide the food needed to feed the world. In this regard his conviction that population must be controlled encouraged him to become a trustee of the Marie Stopes Foundation from 1991 to his death. He lived latterly at Peartrees, 6 Nestor Court, Teston, Maidstone, Kent, where he died from pneumonia and prostate cancer on 19 December 2004. He was survived by his wife and four children.<br>
