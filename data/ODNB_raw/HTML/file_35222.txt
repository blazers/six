<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Newton,  Ernest</span>  (1856&#150;1922), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in London on 12 September 1856, the fourth son of Henry Newton, then resident agent for the Sturt property in Hoxton, and his wife, Mary Lockyer. Educated at Uppingham School, Rutland, under Edward Thring, he entered the office of Richard Norman Shaw in June 1873, and after three years as an assistant began to work independently in 1879. In Shaw's office he came into contact with E. S. Prior, Mervyn Macartney, G. C. Horsley, and, later, W. R. Lethaby. The early meetings of this group for discussion of architectural matters ultimately developed into the Art-Workers' Guild, the most important and enduring of the groups and guilds of the arts and crafts movement. To Shaw himself, and particularly to Philip Webb, Newton owed a conception of architecture as art, as a mode of personal expression rather than an exercise in archaeology or a professional occupation. That his mature work was marked by a serenity and a simplicity is due to his own interpretation of the work of Webb and Lethaby rather than to the somewhat dramatic vigour of his master's work.<br>
<br>Like other pupils of Shaw, Newton passed into private practice with the help of a major piece of work in the House of Retreat, Lloyd Square, Clerkenwell (1880&#150;83), and possibly also a small development at Grove Park in south-east London for the earl of Northbrook (1879), now mostly demolished. Both were in the Shaw manner. For the first ten years of his career he was working mainly on small suburban houses, particularly in the Chislehurst and Bickley areas of Kent, showing how orderliness of plan and unity of materials could give an effect of breadth to minor works&#151;a lesson not lost upon the next generation of architects. Like many architects starting out on their careers he published his work in two books, <span class="italic">A Book of Houses</span> (1890) and <span class="italic">A Book of Country Houses</span> (1903), thereby illustrating a number of his earlier houses for a wider public. He married in 1881 Antoinette Johanna, the eldest daughter of William Hoyack, merchant of Rotterdam; they had three sons.<br>
<br>Bullers Wood, Chislehurst, Kent (1888&#150;9), was Newton's first large work (later altered). Here an earlier stuccoed house was encased and enlarged to form what was in effect a new house, carefully combining liveliness of elevation with a quiet dignity which was to be his hallmark. It is thought of in terms of wall and window, roof and chimney, while other architects were still thinking in terms of style and period. This is important, because it throws light on all Newton's subsequent work. Lethaby, the former colleague who was one of his oldest friends and who took over charge of works at the church of St Swithun, Hither Green (<i>c</i>.1890&#150;1895), during an illness, wrote that Newton was &#145;aiming rather at sound and expressive building than at style imitations&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 122, 3 Feb 1922, 19). He was using traditional elements and materials but not designing in a way which copied any specific style. It could be said that, although he fully agreed with Webb's and Lethaby's more philosophical approach to design in architecture, his contribution was to make of it a domestic architecture for every day.<br>
<br>The houses of the two decades either side of 1900 were Newton's main achievement. He was extraordinarily stable in his method of designing, and usually produced variations on single themes, such as the very similar pair, one in a free neo-Georgian&#151;Luckley, Wokingham, Berkshire (1906)&#151;the other much more vernacular&#151;Ludwick Corner, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire (1907). Such houses could be built at the scale of a country house, as at Flint House, Goring, Oxfordshire (1913). He also favoured a more compact type of house, often, however, quite large and usually in a free neo-Georgian style, from Redcourt, Haslemere, Surrey (1894), and Steep Hill, Jersey (1899), to Dawn House, Winchester, Hampshire (1907), Feathercombe, Hambledon, Surrey (1910), Lukyns, Ewhurst, Surrey, (1911), and Norsbury House, Sutton Scotney, Hampshire (1919). Like many arts and crafts architects he also carried out works to older buildings, restoring and extending houses such as Upton Grey Manor House, Hampshire (1907; with a Gertrude Jekyll garden), The Greenway, Shurdington, Gloucestershire (1910), and, one of his major works, Oldcastle, Dallington, Sussex (1912), where he extended a medieval house of the Sussex Weald.<br>
<br>Newton's work outside the domestic field was limited, but he designed the church of St Swithun at Hither Green, Kent (<i>c</i>.1890&#150;1895), and added the tower to the church of St George, Bickley, Kent (1904&#150;5), as well as the little Roman Catholic chapel of Sts Gregory and Augustine, Oxford (1911), and, executed by his son W. G. Newton, also an architect, the memorial shrine and hall at Uppingham School, Rutland (1921), the elevation of the latter of which is based on the hall of the Elizabethan Kirby Hall in Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>Ernest Newton was elected president of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1914. In 1916 he voluntarily undertook onerous public work in connection with the issue of building licences, to the detriment of his health. In 1918 he was awarded the royal gold medal of the RIBA on the recommendation of its council. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1911 and Royal Academician in 1919, and created CBE in 1920. He died at his home, 17 Blomfield Road, Maida Hill, London, on 25 January 1922.<br>
<br>As a man Newton had a facility for making friends in every walk of life and at various time keenly pursued the study of the Dutch language, the violin, acting, French conversation and literature, and the technique of watercolour. He had a notably candid mind and an unusually frank admiration for attainments which he lacked himself. He had a very great facility for taking pains, and a candid dislike of pedantry and fanaticism, all of which were reflected in his architecture.<br>
