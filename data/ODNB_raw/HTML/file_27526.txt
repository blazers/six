<span class="headword">Tomlinson,  Nicholas</span>  (1764&#150;1847), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, third son of Captain Robert Tomlinson RN, was from March 1772 on the books of the <i>Resolution</i>, guardship at Chatham, of which his father was first lieutenant. In 1776 he transferred to the <i>Thetis</i>, in which he made two voyages to St Helena and served on the North American station. In March 1779 he joined the <i>Charon</i>, with Captain John Luttrell, third earl of Carhampton, a friend of his father; he served as Luttrell's aide-de-camp in the capture of Omoa. Continuing in the <i>Charon</i> with Captain Thomas Symonds, he was present at the capture of the French privateer <i>Comte d'Artois</i> and the defence and surrender of Yorktown.<br>
<br>Tomlinson returned to England through an exchange of prisoners in December 1781, and on 23 March 1782 was made lieutenant in the <i>Bristol</i>, which went with convoy to the East Indies. In April 1783, a few days after the <i>Bristol</i>'s arrival in Madras Roads, Tomlinson volunteered to go to the help of the Indiaman <i>Duke of Athol</i> and was on her when she was blown up with the death of nearly two hundred men. Tomlinson escaped with his life, but was severely injured. In the <i>Bristol</i> he was at the fifth action between Suffren and Sir Edward Hughes off Cuddalore; in September 1784 he was appointed to the <i>Juno</i> and in her returned to England in 1785.<br>
<br>From 1786 to 1790 Tomlinson served in the sloop <i>Savage</i> on the coast of Scotland. He then, with a recommendation from Lord Hawke, joined the Russian navy and had command of a Russian ship of the line, which he resigned on the imminence of the war between England and France in the beginning of 1793. In July he was appointed to the British <i>Regulus</i> (44 guns), which ill health compelled him to leave after a few months, but in July 1794 he was appointed to command the gunboat <i>Pelter</i>, in which he performed a variety of enterprising actions along the French coast, for one of which&#151;the cover of the retreat of a party of French royalists after the failure of the expedition at Quiberon&#151;he was publicly thanked by Sir John Borlase Warren on the quarterdeck of the <i>Pomone</i> in July 1795. He married, in 1794, Elizabeth, second daughter and coheir of Ralph Ward of Forburrows, near Colchester, and had a large family.<br>
<br>On 30 November 1795 after brief appointments to the <i>Glory</i> (98 guns) and the gun-vessel <i>Vesure</i> Tomlinson was promoted to the command of the sloop <i>Suffisante</i>, in which, in the following May, he captured the French brig <i>Revanche</i>; and through the summer he took or destroyed several privateers, armed vessels, storeships, and traders, for which the Committee for Encouraging the Capture of French Privateers voted him a piece of plate valued at &pound;50, as did the court of directors of the Royal Exchange Assurance; and on 12 December 1796 he was advanced to post rank. In the following year, being unable to get employment from the Admiralty, he fitted out a privateer in which he made several rich prizes; but being reported to the Admiralty as having used the private signals to avoid being overhauled by warships, his name was struck off the list of post captains on 20 November 1798. After a determined effort to obtain reinstatement he was permitted in 1801 to serve as a volunteer in the fleet going to the Baltic with Sir Hyde Parker, and being favourably reported on by him was restored to his rank in the navy, with seniority, on 22 September 1801.<br>
<br>From July 1803 to June 1809 Tomlinson commanded the sea fencibles on the coast of Essex; in the summer of 1809 he fitted out and commanded a division of fireships for operations in the Scheldt. On returning to England he resumed the command of the fencibles until they were broken up early in 1810. In that year he successfully fought a legal case brought against him by the Navy Board for conniving at uttering a false receipt connected with the repair of the <i>Pelter</i> in 1795. He had no further employment, but was put on the retired list of rear-admirals on 22 July 1830; he was transferred to the active list on 17 August 1840 and was promoted vice-admiral on 23 November 1841. He died at his house near Lewes on 6 March 1847. Two of his brothers also served in the navy and retired with the rank of commander after the war. Philip died in 1839, Robert at the age of eighty-five in 1844.<br>
