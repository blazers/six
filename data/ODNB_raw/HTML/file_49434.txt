<span class="headword">Blake,  Charles Henry</span>  (1794&#150;1872), <span class="occ">property speculator</span>, was born in Calcutta, the son of Benjamin Blake, a sea captain who had been plying the route to India since 1775. Soon after 1794 his father left the sea and became an indigo planter in Bengal, and Blake followed his father into this business. In the 1820s he left India for England, but returned to India about 1830. Later he became a rum and sugar manufacturer, an occupation he continued to pursue until he left India for good in 1842 or 1843, the profits from which, no doubt, provided the basis for his speculations in Notting Hill and Notting Dale in North Kensington.<br>
<br>Blake's twenty-year career as an active speculator began in 1850 when he bought 25 acres of undeveloped land on the Ladbroke estate and began to grant building leases. Only two years later, however, he sold this still isolated land (probably at a loss) and bought a smaller but more advantageously situated estate at the top of Lansdowne Hill. Here, in Stanley Crescent, Stanley Gardens, and the north side of Kensington Park Gardens, he built some sixty large, stucco-fronted houses, designed in the Italianate manner by Blake's architect, Thomas Allom, and grouped around the communal gardens which were a distinguishing feature of the layout of the Ladbroke estate. Forty of these houses were built by a direct contract for some &pound;64,000 between Blake and a builder, D. A. Ramsay, and the rest under the usual procedure of building leases granted by Blake.<br>
<br>In 1854, however, the housing boom in North Kensington collapsed, Ramsay was declared bankrupt, and Blake was left with forty unfinished houses on his hands. In 1858 he too was on the verge of insolvency and had to sell his own fine house at 24 Kensington Park Gardens, but he was saved by a revival of the housing market in 1859&#150;60 and soon he was developing other land further north on the west side of Ladbroke Grove.<br>
<br>In the second phase of Blake's career as a building speculator he made full use of the housing boom of the 1860s and of the impending construction of the Hammersmith and City railway line, which traversed Notting Dale to a junction with the Great Western Railway near Paddington, and of which Blake was the principal promoter and a director. In 1862 he had contracted to buy, for about &pound;838 per acre, some 130 acres of the Portobello estate, part of which would be needed for the line; he and the chairman of the railway company (who also had a share in the deal) demanded &pound;10,000 per acre for the ground needed by the railway. Ultimately the price to be paid by the company was settled at &pound;2105 per acre, but both Blake and the chairman resigned as directors, with heavily tarnished reputations. The railway, opened in 1864, proved an instant commercial success and Blake had no difficulty in developing all of the land on either side of Ladbroke Grove between the railway and Kensal Green. In that area he acted as both ground landlord and speculator, granting building leases, making loans to builders, buying and selling improved ground rents, and also selling vacant land, usually at about double the price which he had himself paid. Many of the houses were of the three-storey terraced variety with basements, the plots being usually only 20 feet wide and 60 feet deep. Some of the streets developed by these means achieved nationwide notoriety in the mid-twentieth century as the scene of some of the worst housing conditions in all London.<br>
<br>After 1868 Blake lived in semi-retirement at Bournemouth, where he died at his home, 15 Westover Villas, on 22 March 1872. A monument to him (which no longer exists) was erected in St Peter's Church there. He was survived by his wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1876), and, subject to her life interest, bequeathed his estate to his two sons and two daughters; the elder son (also named Charles Henry), a barrister, continued to manage the estate for some years. At the time of Blake senior's death his principal property consisted of twenty-four freehold houses on Lansdowne Hill and freehold land and ground rents on the Portobello estate. There were also a number of outstanding mortgages and family charges, and the surplus of assets over liabilities amounted to some &pound;120,000, which yielded a gross income of &pound;3905 per annum. This represented a return of only about 3.25 per cent on the capital invested&#151;not a very high rate for Blake's twenty-two years' assiduous labours, the imminence of ruin in 1859, and a blemished reputation acquired in 1862&#150;4.<br>
