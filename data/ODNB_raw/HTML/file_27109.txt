<span class="headword">Osborne,  Dorothy</span> <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Dorothy Temple, Lady Temple]</span>  (1627&#150;1695), <span class="occ">letter writer</span>, was the youngest daughter and tenth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20881/', "Sir Peter Osborne (1584/5&#150;1653)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20880/', "Osborne, Peter (1521&#150;1592)")</script>], royalist lieutenant-governor of Guernsey, and Dorothy, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Danvers (1590&#150;1650/51) of Dauntsey, Wiltshire. With the outbreak of the civil war Dorothy's mother took the children from the family home of Chicksands Abbey, Bedfordshire, to stay in Chelsea, perhaps with her brother, the parliamentarian (and future regicide) Sir John Danvers. From there, about 1642 or early 1643, the family travelled to St Malo, France, to be near to their father, and Lady Osborne got into debt sending provisions to her besieged husband in Castle Cornet, Guernsey. In 1644, when Dorothy was seventeen, they finally returned to Chelsea (Chicksands had been sequestrated). Two of Dorothy's brothers were killed during the civil war: Henry at Naseby (1645); Charles at Hartland, Devon (1646).<br>
<br>Sir Peter held Castle Cornet until August 1646, when he was forced into retreat and exile in St Malo. Dorothy and a brother (probably Robin) set out to meet their father there. <i>En route</i> they met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27122/', "Sir William Temple (1628&#150;1699)")</script> who was just embarking on a tour of the continent. They set off for St Malo together and their lengthy courtship began. There were oppositions on both sides. In part Dorothy's father objected to her marrying the son of Sir John Temple, master of the rolls in Ireland, seen by some as willing to serve irrespective of the politics of the administration. But her father had also hoped for a more lucrative match for Dorothy to restore the family finances which had been much depleted after the heavy fines imposed by the parliamentary government. Dorothy's brother Henry (1618&#150;1675), who was one of the small group of peers who escorted Charles II back to England, also strongly objected to the match, and kept a diary, partly in code, detailing his opposition to Temple.<br>
<br>Temple left for Paris about summer 1648 and was abroad for most of the following five years. He and Dorothy met briefly in London in winter 1650&#150;51, before she was taken back to Chicksands. In December 1652 Dorothy received a letter from Temple announcing his return from the Netherlands and asking whether he owed her the &pound;10 that he had once promised to pay her on her marriage. Their famous correspondence began with her reply: &#145;But for the ten pounde hee [Temple] Claimes it is not yett due, and I think you may doe well &hellip; to putt it in the Number of his desperate debts, for 'tis a very uncertaine one&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, ed. Moore Smith, 3).<br>
<br>Osborne's letters to Temple record her family's opposition to their engagement, and their careful surveillance of her, mostly on Henry's part. At Chicksands she was introduced to suitor after suitor; the letters provide an itemized assessment of their shortcomings, and describe how each new one was sent on his way. The letters were smuggled out of Chicksands to Temple, who kept them in a cabinet that is still on display at Moor Park, Surrey. Only one of his letters to her survived from their courtship, the rest were destroyed as soon as she had read them.<br>
<br>In November 1654 Osborne suffered from a severe attack of smallpox which nearly killed her, and left her permanently scarred. One month later, on Christmas day, Dorothy and William were married before a justice of the peace according to the vows promulgated in the previous year by Barebone's Parliament. The details are recorded in the marriage register in St Giles-in-the-Fields, London. The marriage did not end her problems with her family, and in February she and Temple brought a suit against her brother in chancery for refusing to pay her portion. The dispute was settled that June.<br>
<br>Initially Dorothy and her husband lived with his maternal uncle, Robert Hammond, in Reading, where their first son, John, was born, on 18 December 1655. In May 1656 they moved to Ireland where they had eight or possibly nine children, six of whom died in infancy. (In 1679 their fourteen-year-old daughter Diana died of smallpox, and their son John drowned himself in April 1689.) They returned to London in 1663. From the relative penury of the early years of their marriage they found themselves in much grander surroundings when Temple was made ambassador in the Netherlands in June 1665. He was recalled in 1670, and Dorothy returned in September 1671. With her husband she later played a part in arranging the marriage of William of Orange and Mary, daughter of James, duke of York, acting as go-between, and remained her confidante until Mary's death a few months before her own. She and Temple retired to Moor Park, near Farnham, Surrey, an estate bought by Temple in 1680.<br>
<br>Dorothy died at Moor Park on 7 February 1695 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, the place marked by a plaque on the wall of the south aisle, and stone set in the floor. Her fame was secured by the publication of her letters&#151;first in extracts in Courtenay's biography of her husband in 1836, and then in various editions through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. While Temple's biographers have tended to pay tribute to her as a helpmeet, recent rereadings of the letters (held in the British Library, Add. MS 33975) emphasize Osborne's wider range. In her letters she comments on political events (the ejection of Algernon Sidney from the Commons; or the plot against Cromwell); on religious controversies (on the sermons of Stephen Marshall and William Erbury, for example; or declaring herself a &#145;devote&#146; of Jeremy Taylor); and on the art of writing, as well as on her own wide range of reading (from the French romances she read in the original, to her dismissal of Margaret Cavendish's writing). Nevertheless, it is for the elegance and wit of the letters that Osborne will be remembered, and for the sparkling personality that shines through her writing.<br>
