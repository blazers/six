<span class="headword">Peel,  Jonathan</span>  (1799&#150;1879), <span class="occ">politician, soldier, and patron of the turf</span>, the fifth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21763/', "Sir Robert Peel, first baronet (1750&#150;1830)")</script>, cotton manufacturer, and his first wife, Ellen Yates (1766&#150;1803), and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21764/', "Sir Robert Peel, second baronet")</script>, the politician, was born at Chamber Hall, near Bury, Lancashire, on 12 October 1799. He was sent to Rugby School in 1811, and on 15 June 1815, three days before the battle of Waterloo, he received a commission as a second lieutenant in the rifle brigade. The peace that followed prevented him from seeing service, and his subsequent steps were obtained by purchase. From 3 December 1818 to 13 December 1821 he served as a captain in the 71st highlanders, and from 7 November 1822 to 19 May 1825 as a major in the Grenadier Guards. He was a major of the 69th foot from 3 October 1826 to 7 June 1827, and a lieutenant-colonel of the 53rd foot from 7 June 1827 until he was placed on half pay on 9 August 1827. He became a brevet-colonel on 23 November 1841, a major-general on 20 June 1854, and a lieutenant-general on 7 December 1859, and sold out of the army on 4 August 1863. In 1854 he applied to Lord Panmure, the secretary for war, for permission to join the siege of Sevastopol in the Crimea; he was then a healthy man of fifty-five, but his application was refused on the grounds that he was too old.<br>
<br>On 19 March 1824 Peel married Lady Alicia Jane (<i>d</i>. 1887), the youngest daughter of Archibald Kennedy, first marquess of Ailsa, with whom he had five sons and three daughters. At the 1826 general election he entered parliament as a tory as one of the members for Norwich. He exchanged in 1831 for the more secure borough of Huntingdon, which he continued to represent until his retirement from parliamentary life at the dissolution of 1868. During his brother's second administration, in 1841&#150;6, Peel held the post of surveyor-general of the ordnance. He was not given office in Lord Derby's first administration in 1852; but when Derby again became premier in 1858, he appointed Peel as secretary for war and a member of the cabinet&#151;a significant gesture towards the name of Sir Robert Peel, his former colleague and rival. Peel soon made his mark in official life, and became very popular. None knew better than he the wants of the army or more thoroughly mastered the details of the estimates. His letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on military expenditure showed a thorough grasp of the statistics of the subject. He again held the post of secretary of state for war in Derby's third administration during 1866&#150;7, but he resigned office on 2 March 1867 with lords Carnarvon and Salisbury rather than support Disraeli's scheme of reform. Throughout his political career Peel preserved an irreproachable reputation, and, although a strong Conservative, showed himself when in office a strenuous supporter of inquiries into abuses in all matters of military organization.<br>
<br>Peel was noted for his devotion to horse racing and his deep knowledge of all things connected with the turf. His racing career began in 1821, when he was part owner of some horses with the duke of Richmond and Lord Stradbrooke. In 1824 his mare Phantom ran second for the Oaks to Lord Jersey's Cobweb. It was not until 1830 that Peel's name first appeared in the <span class="italic">Racing Calendar</span> when he raced in confederacy with his relative General Jonathan Yates. Two years later he enjoyed success when his horse Archibald won the Two Thousand Guineas, and his good fortune culminated with the triumph of his Orlando in the Derby of 1844. In that race, Ionian, another of his horses, came second. This was one of the most sensational races on record, and will always be associated with the exposure of a particularly serious fraud. A horse entered as Running Rein came in first but, after Peel's appeal, was disqualified as being a four-year-old, and the race was awarded to Orlando. Mr A. Wood, the owner of Running Rein, then brought an action against Peel, as a member of the Jockey Club, for recovery of the stakes. The case was heard before Baron Alderson on 1&#150;2 July 1844, when, Wood not producing Running Rein, a verdict was returned for the defendant. On 18 August 1851 Peel sold his stud for 12,000 guineas; but on the death of the earl of Glasgow in 1869, having been left some horses, he resumed his connection with the turf. His favourite jockeys were Arthur Pavis and Nat Flatman. In the Newmarket second October meeting of 1878 Peel's purple jacket and orange cap, familiar on English racecourses for nearly sixty years, were borne to victory for the last time by a colt called Peter&#151;so named after a nickname given to Lord Glasgow by his closest friends. At the time of his death, Peel's nominations for coming races numbered about fifty.<br>
<br>Peel died at his seat, Marble Hill, Twickenham, Middlesex, on 13 February 1879 and was buried in Twickenham new cemetery on the 19th.<br>
