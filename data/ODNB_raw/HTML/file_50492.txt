<span class="headword">Villiers,  Charles Amherst</span>  (1900&#150;1991), <span class="occ">engineer and portrait painter</span>, was born in London on 9 December 1900, the second child and elder son in the family of two sons and two daughters of Ernest Amherst Villiers (1863&#150;1923), Liberal MP for Brighton from 1906 to 1910, and his wife, the Hon. Elaine Augusta Guest, third daughter of Ivor Bertie Guest, first Baron Wimborne. His father, who was descended from Thomas Villiers, first earl of Clarendon (of the second creation), was the nephew of William Amhurst Tyssen-Amherst, first Baron Amherst of Hackney. His mother was a cousin of Winston Churchill. His formal education began at Oundle School, where he first developed a passion for engineering, particularly propulsion systems for motor cars and aircraft. During the First World War, with the help of his headmaster at Oundle, H. W. Sanderson, he was apprenticed to the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough. He was on the point of being commissioned into the Royal Flying Corps when armistice was declared in November 1918. In 1919 he entered Cambridge, where he read physics.<br>
<br>Villiers's first appointment after Cambridge was with the Armstrong-Whitworth Development Company in Coventry, where he stayed until 1922 before joining Raymond Mays, founder of ERA cars and later of BRM, whom he had met at university. Villiers successfully modified the camshafts of two 1.5 litre Brescia Bugatti cars which Mays had acquired, enabling them to out-perform larger-engined vehicles. This attracted the attention of Ettore Bugatti, who invited Villiers to spend six months at his works at Molsheim in eastern France. This was an important period in the enhancement of Villiers's reputation, since a number of his ideas were incorporated into Bugatti cars to enable them to achieve higher r.p.m. During the 1920s Villiers established himself as a leading authority on superchargers and was much in demand as a consulting engineer of high reputation. Commissions by Raymond Mays and others enabled him to supercharge some of the leading motor cars of the day, from the 1.5 litre AC to the 7.7 litre Rolls-Royce. He also worked on Malcolm Campbell's Bluebird car, powered by a 24 litre Napier Lion aero-engine, which Campbell used in his successful attempt on the land speed record at Daytona Beach. Perhaps one of Villiers's most notable successes was his work on the supercharger of the four-cylinder Bentley engine. Although it never won a race, the &#145;Blower Bentley&#146; achieved outstanding performances at Brooklands and Le Mans and was driven to second place by Sir Henry Birkin in the French grand prix of 1930. The flamboyant reputation of the famous &#145;Bentley Boys&#146; of this period owed much to Villiers's engineering skill. On 30 July 1932 he married Marietta Strakosch, also known as Maya de Lisle (<i>b</i>. 1893/4), widow of George Strakosch, and daughter of Georges Mungovich, financier. There were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>Villiers's interest in flying was evident as early as 1918 when the armistice ended his plans to join the Royal Flying Corps. He founded his own aero-engine company in the 1920s but this failed to grow as he concentrated on motor vehicle development. In 1935, however, he joined the newly formed Straight Corporation where, among other things, he designed and built an advanced light aero-engine (named the Maya de Lisle, after his wife), which he tested himself in a company monoplane. During the Second World War he delivered bomber and fighter aircraft from the factories to their RAF squadrons, as a member of the RAF transport auxiliary. In his spare time he designed a heavy bomber capable of flying non-stop round the world, but this aeroplane was never built.<br>
<br>In 1943 Villiers was recruited by the Canadian Car and Foundry Company, which manufactured Hurricanes in Montreal, to lead its research division. After the war he moved to the United States. He remained there for the next twenty years, becoming an American citizen. His first marriage having ended in divorce, in 1946 he married Juanita Lorraine (Nita) Brown (<i>d</i>. 1968), daughter of Charles Brown, of Minneapolis. They had a son, Charles, and a daughter, Jane. In 1948 Villiers became president of the Rocket Society. His many projects during this period included rocket-powered spacecraft and satellite communications for the United States Aircraft Corporation, Boeing, and Douglas Aircraft at Santa Monica. This latter work was followed by six years of research with Bendix-Aviation-Eclipse and at the University of California.<br>
<br>Villiers returned to England in 1965 to resume his work on the technical enhancement of motor car engines, working with Peter Berthon on the 1.5 litre BRM engine, and with Graham Hill on the Cosworth. However, his engineering work soon lapsed as he became passionately devoted to portrait painting. His subjects included Graham Hill, Cardinal Spellman, and Pope John Paul II. A portrait of Ian Fleming was used on a <span class="italic">James Bond</span> cover.<br>
<br>Some of Villiers's projects, including a Mars landing, never came to fruition, while the efficacy of others was questioned. Nevertheless, he was an engineer and inventor of truly outstanding range and talent. He was said to hold deep religious convictions and in later life tended towards the mystical. He died of cancer at his home, 46a Holland Street, Kensington, London, on 12 December 1991. He was survived by the son and daughter of his second marriage.<br>
