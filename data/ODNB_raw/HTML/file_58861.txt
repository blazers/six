<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Moneyers</span>  (<em>act. </em><em>c.</em>1180&#150;<em>c.</em>1500) <span class="occ"></span>served in a profession that included a wide range of different types of people employed, chiefly in London, in the production of currency.<h2>
<a name="Themintanditsstaff"></a>The mint and its staff</h2>At its most comprehensive the mint could employ both illiterate labourers at the bottom of the scale, and figures of the stature of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23688/', "Peter de Rivallis (d. 1262)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24016/', "Gregory of Ruxley (d. 1291)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24611/', "John Sandale (d. 1319)")</script> at the top. These distinguished men all served as wardens of the mint and exchange, but theirs was essentially a civil service, supervisory post, which could be exercised by deputy, and which monitored the work of mint staff and accounted for the king's seigniorage (the fee received by the crown for every pound of coin struck). Thus <a name="cosubject_58857"></a><span class="headword">William Hardel</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1248)<span class="occ"></span>, deputy to Peter de Rivallis, who ran the mints and exchanges of London and Canterbury from 1234 until his death, was an important royal clerk who also served as controller of the wardrobe. But it was the master of the mint who directed day-to-day production, and whose developing combination of financial experience and practical metallurgical knowledge made him the chief mint worker during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.<h2>
<a name="Therecoinageof1180anditsaftermath"></a>The recoinage of 1180 and its aftermath</h2>Although William I had retained most of the Anglo-Saxon moneyers who had served his predecessors, the Plantagenets often looked abroad for their senior mint staff. The central part played by <a name="cosubject_45747"></a><span class="headword">Philippe Aimer</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1180&#150;1181)<span class="occ"></span> in the recoinage of 1180 conformed to this practice, but also marks a significant stage in the evolution of the office of master. Aimer was brought from Tours by Richard of Ilchester, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1188), and between August 1180 and May 1181 he was paid 16<i>d</i>. a day&#151;double the rate paid to other senior moneyers. His son Aimer was paid 4<i>d</i>. a day. Although Philippe Aimer's employment was terminated rather suddenly, on 2 May 1181, his reputation throughout the Angevin empire, his overall direction of the recoinage&#151;Ralph de Diceto suggests that he bore some general responsibility for the moneyers' shortcomings, and that he was sent home to France unpunished only thanks to the indulgence of the king&#151;and his exalted salary all mark him out from ordinary moneyers.<br>
<br>After the recoinage of 1180 for many years the production of coin was left increasingly in the hands of moneyers, with no master formally appointed over them. Their number at London, the largest mint, fluctuated according to the pressure of work, from a dozen or more at a time of recoinage, to less than half that number at other times. Some scores of labourers were in turn employed by the senior moneyers for most of the less technical manual work. And keepers of the dies and assayers were appointed as a check on the moneyers. In fact moneyers, assayers, and die-keepers came from very similar kinds of social background, and sometimes men moved from one grade to another when vacancies arose. Thus <a name="cosubject_58858"></a><span class="headword">Henry  of Frowick</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1286?)<span class="occ"></span>, a leading citizen of London, was made assayer at the London mint in 1247, and promoted moneyer in 1248. Henry owned property in various parts of the city, and rose to the rank of alderman and sheriff. He married Isabel, daughter of Thomas of Durham, another alderman and sheriff, with whom he had six sons and three daughters.<h2>
<a name="Thirteenthcenturydevelopments"></a>Thirteenth-century developments</h2>There were strong family and professional links binding all these mint workers together. Ralph of Frowick had been moneyer at London from 1218 until after 1222, and <a name="cosubject_58859"></a><span class="headword">Roger Frowick</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1292&#150;1327), <span class="occ">goldsmith and moneyer</span>, was active from 1292. Exchanger at the London mint from 1297 to 1327, Roger was involved in city politics as alderman of Langbourn ward from 1312 to 1324, served as assessor of the fifteenth in 1313, and is known to have mixed socially, as well as professionally, with John Sandale. John Hardel, appointed keeper of dies in 1247, was no doubt related to William Hardel, warden of the mint and exchange at that time.<br>
<br>Not surprisingly, many moneyers were goldsmiths. <a name="cosubject_58860"></a><span class="headword">Adam  of Bentley</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1230&#150;1246)<span class="occ"></span>, sheriff of London in 1246, is a case in point. Appointed moneyer in 1230, he and his wife, Maud, had an interest in a house in Friday Street, which appears in the wills of several Bentley goldsmiths into the fourteenth century. <a name="cosubject_58861"></a><span class="headword">Richard Bachelor</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1235)<span class="occ"></span>, another goldsmith, paid 100<i>s</i>. to have the die of Richard of Necton in 1235, but it is not clear whether he received it. Bachelor owned property in the parish of St Andrew, Holborn, later released by his widow, Isabella, and son, Thomas.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_45748"></a><span class="headword">Nicholas  of St Albans</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1253)<span class="occ"></span>, who acquired a controlling interest in the mints of London and Canterbury from about 1237 until his death, was another goldsmith. Nicholas's father, John, described by Matthew Paris as <i>aurifaber incomparabilis</i>, made the exterior of the shrine at St Albans before taking employment under the king of Denmark. Nicholas succeeded him, and ran the Danish mint for many years before returning to England to take up a similar position for Henry III. He seems to have bought out several other moneyers, and been almostly solely responsible for the London and Canterbury mints in the early 1240s when activity continued at a very high level. A will in the name of Nicholas of St Albans, goldsmith, was enrolled on 25 July 1258, and mentioned a wife, Joan, and sons, Richard and Michael, though the moneyer&#150;goldsmith is known to have died by 1253.<h2>
<a name="WilliamofGloucesterandhiscircle"></a>William of Gloucester and his circle</h2>
<a name="cosubject_45751"></a><span class="headword">William  of Gloucester</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1269)<span class="occ"></span>, a Londoner who became a king's serjeant, seems also to have achieved a remarkable concentration of power within the mint and exchange. The great seal in use from 1259 until 1272 was his work, and he carried out a number of royal commissions at Westminster Abbey, including a golden shrine for St Edward. He married Joan, daughter of Michael de St Helen, and with her had a daughter, Joan, and two sons&#151;John, who became a draper, and Henry, who was a goldsmith. William owned a goldsmithery in the parish of St Vedast. In May 1255 he received the London die formerly held by Nicholas of St Albans, and in 1256 was apparently a leading figure in the consortium of moneyers that took on all the London dies. Then in 1257 he also acquired the Canterbury die of the moneyer Robert, launched the gold penny of Henry III (the first English gold coin since before the conquest), and became warden of the exchanges of London and Canterbury, simultaneously with his moneyer role.<br>
<br>Other members of the London consortium included John Hardel and Henry of Frowick, already mentioned, and Walter of Brussels, who held property in Pentecostlane, in St Nicholas Shambles, and was still living there in 1281. <a name="cosubject_58862"></a><span class="headword">David  of Enfield</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1260)<span class="occ"></span>, a citizen and goldsmith, was also one of the consortium. He had a son and two daughters, and is most often recorded in the property transactions of his children, which reveal his ownership of half a shop in Cheap, in the parish of St Peter, and a tenement in St Sepulchre, probably consisting of three houses and a shop. He also owned a stone house in Wodestrete in the parish of St Michael, Wood Street. <a name="cosubject_58863"></a><span class="headword">Richard Bonaventure</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1250&#150;1260)<span class="occ"></span> was a citizen and goldsmith, married to Hawise, with whom he had two known sons and a daughter. He witnessed a deed giving land in Aldersgate for a dowry on the occasion of a marriage involving a goldbeater, and the other witnesses included William of Gloucester, Henry of Frowick, and David of Enfield. In 1253 Bonaventure was holding property fronting on Cheapside in the parish of St Vedast, which was a centre for goldsmiths and the location for the London mint before its establishment in the Tower. He also bought a shop further east in Cheapside, and rented accommodation in Gutter Lane, known also as Guthrens Lane, a centre for the purest assays of silver in England. Indeed the property records of the consortium indicate that they all occupied property within a quarter mile of Old Change, which lay east of St Paul's running north into West Cheap.<h2>
<a name="Reformandreorganizationinthelaterthirteenthcentury"></a>Reform and reorganization in the later thirteenth century</h2>This group of moneyers seems to have operated successfully until June 1260, when a judicial inquiry was set up under Hugh Bigod (<i>d</i>. 1266), justiciar of England, and John Mansel (<i>d</i>. 1265), Henry III's principal adviser. They were to hear moneyers' pleas and to amend errors in the mint. Apparently there were many errors and defects in the exchange of London, with contention among the moneyers and possible damage to the king. The upshot was that William of Gloucester was replaced as warden in January 1262, and thereafter the wardens' accounts begin to concern themselves with the profits of the foundry for the first time. It then becomes apparent that there was a significant margin of about 3<i>d</i>. in the pound between the sums charged to the merchant for mintage and the actual costs of the operation. This margin&#151;the profits of the foundry&#151;was after 1262 claimed by the crown, but before this date had fallen to the moneyers, and made them very rich.<br>
<br>William surrendered the wardenship, but he continued to hold office as royal goldsmith, and as keeper of the works of the shrine of St Edward, a mark of royal favour which even survived his involvement, with much of the city, on the side of the barons and Simon de Montfort. After the battle of Evesham in 1265 he was imprisoned at Windsor, but was soon restored to royal favour, and to his work at Westminster. His privileged position was confirmed in 1267. In 1268 he and Henry of Frowick were executors of a colleague's will, and in the same year he was sent to France on urgent royal business. He died in 1269.<br>
<br>Perhaps as a result of the excesses of Gloucester's moneyer consortium, there followed a general tightening up. Under Edward I the old distinction between the exchange and mint was reactivated with the warden of the exchange collecting the royal seigniorage, supervising the purchase of bullion and issue of new coin, and checking up on the master moneyer, who took charge of all aspects of minting according to a detailed written indenture. The earliest surviving indenture for a master of the mint, dated 1279, is that of <a name="cosubject_45752"></a><span class="headword">William  de Turnemire</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1279&#150;1284)<span class="occ"></span>. William and his brother Peter (who fled abroad in 1286) were from Marseilles, and formed part of a team of continental mint-masters brought in to supervise Edward I's recoinage of 1279. The senior master was initially Hubert Alion d'Asti, who was paid &pound;200 per annum for his services, twice the sum William and Peter received. However, Hubert soon left England, and by 1283 he was working in the Namur mint for the count of Flanders. On Hubert's departure William took charge in England. As well as the master's indenture, details of work at the mint survive from a <span class="italic">Treatise on the New Money</span> written about this time. This treatise was formerly attributed to William but is now known to have been written in 1286 or 1287, after he had resigned on 28 January 1284 to take charge of the Anglo-Gascon mint at Bordeaux. The treatise describes the division of responsibilities between the master and the warden, and the types of quality control in use at the mint. It also contains authoritative information on assaying, and on the calculation of the correct alloy and appropriate mint charges.<h2>
<a name="ItalianmoneyersinEngland"></a>Italian moneyers in England</h2>The employment of foreign experts who ran the mints at particularly busy times but soon moved on, either to avoid prosecution or to take up minting opportunities elsewhere, was common. Occasionally, however, men stayed in England for life. One such was <a name="cosubject_58864"></a><span class="headword">Lapinus Roger</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1292&#150;1331)<span class="occ"></span>, a Florentine, who succeeded to his uncle's post as assayer and exchanger at Canterbury in 1292, and subsequently also worked at London when his brother Philip was dismissed for faulty record keeping. In due course he was to hold the senior post of master of the mint at both London and Canterbury. In addition to, or perhaps as a consequence of, his professional services he also acquired some 300 acres of marsh in Kent. It is not clear if this land was a deliberate investment of the profits of commerce, or security for an unpaid debt, but in either case it illustrates both his great prosperity and his attachment to Kent. He married a Kentish woman and was admitted a freeman of Canterbury, where he worked for Edward I, Edward II, and Edward III. Roger's conduct seems to have been exemplary, and although he quarrelled with the influential treasurer, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16046/', "Walter Langton (d. 1321)")</script>, over wages, no charges of misconduct were ever suggested. Though occasionally deprived of office as a consequence of political changes during this period, he was consistently reinstated, and in addition was frequently called on to resolve crises at the London mint. In 1331 he was put in charge of an exchange at Dover. His son Robert also subsequently became a moneyer at Canterbury, the third generation of this family employed at the mint there.<br>
<br>Another long-serving foreigner was <a name="cosubject_45753"></a><span class="headword">Walter Barde</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1360&#150;1390)<span class="occ"></span>, son of Filippo de Barde. Walter held the mastership at London from the 1360s to the 1390s. He also ran the exchange of the city of London, despite oft repeated injunctions against such dual appointments, and managed the Calais mint by deputy. Since he was also one of the most frequent sellers of bullion to the exchange, he was simultaneously one of the chief customers of the mint, and the controller of both bullion purchase and coin production. Like Lapinus Roger, Walter held office at a time of considerable political unrest, and despite serious parliamentary interest in the workings of the mint, his expertise seems to have made him indispensable. It has been suggested that Walter may have owed his survival to the importance of the society of the Bardi to crown finances, but it has also been argued that he tried to dissociate himself from the family to build a truly English career. The society, for its part, was anxious not to incur any liability for Walter's mint dealings.<h2>
<a name="Englishmastermoneyersofthefifteenthcentury"></a>English master moneyers of the fifteenth century</h2>English master moneyers sometimes competed with the Italians for the mints in the fourteenth century, but they became dominant in the fifteenth. The best example is <a name="cosubject_45754"></a><span class="headword">Bartholomew Goldbeter <span class="st"> [Seman]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1430/31)<span class="occ"></span>, the name Goldbeter deriving from his trade. From his earliest indenture of 1422, until his death in 1430 or 1431, Goldbeter dominated the mints of London and Calais. He also ran a mint at York in 1423&#150;4, but never took up his option to coin in Bristol. He may have found the work involved in the provincial mints unattractive compared with the very large sums he was coining at London and Calais. He certainly seems to have driven a hard bargain, both with the crown about the terms on which he ran the mints and exchanges, and with individual merchants who brought bullion to the mints. A Commons inquiry of 1423 into Goldbeter's handling of the mints reveals the unusually favourable terms on which he worked, but he managed to hold on to office until his death. He was buried in the London church of St John Zachary. Goldbeter was one of a number of London goldsmiths, such as Louis John (1413), William Rus (1431), and John Paddesley (1434), who were appointed to run the mint at this time. But from the middle of the century a new trend developed, as rather more exalted crown servants were entrusted with the mint. The most famous was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12588/', "Sir William (later first Baron) Hastings (d. 1483)")</script>, an especial confidant of Edward IV.<br>
<br>In summary a typical medieval moneyer was often a goldsmith with knowledge of precious metals; he was frequently a property owner of some standing; he might be English or continental, but in either case he had to be able to enjoy the confidence of the international bankers and merchants as well as that of the crown and the local community. It was a technically demanding profession, which offered great rewards to the successful.<br>
