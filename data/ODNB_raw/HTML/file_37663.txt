<span class="headword">Leftwich,  William</span>  (1770&#150;1843), <span class="occ">confectioner and ice merchant</span>, was born in Aldford, near Chester, in 1770, the son of William Leftwich (1743/4&#150;1809) and his wife, Martha Barns (1732/3&#150;1818). He was descended from an old family of local landowners, the Leftwich family of Leftwich Hall, Cheshire.<br>
<br>Leftwich moved to London and set himself up as a wholesale confectioner, with outlets in Fleet Street and Kingston upon Thames. He became increasingly frustrated by his inability to preserve food, especially dairy products, during hot summer months. In the early nineteenth century ice was used for this purpose only in a most limited way, on a few country estates and in the area around Barking, where it was collected from the marshes most winters. Leftwich seems to have been among the first to realize that the widespread use of ice for preserving food would be both highly beneficial and immensely profitable. Accordingly, he chartered a vessel to go from Great Yarmouth to Norway early in 1822, returning in May of that year with a cargo of 300 tons of ice. Confirmation that importing ice was not then regular practice comes from the uncertainty of customs officers in London as to what import duties to levy; they delayed so long in coming to a conclusion that Leftwich feared his cargo might melt. When it was eventually landed and sold at auction there was widespread interest in this novelty, as well as sufficient demand from fishmongers and pastry-cooks for Leftwich apparently to realize a considerable profit.<br>
<br>In this action Leftwich was well ahead of his time, as Norwegian ice later became widely used for refrigeration. In particular, the advent of the railways ensured that fresh fish, meat, and dairy produce could be speedily transported to urban centres. Previously most food had become unfit for human consumption after forty-eight hours: henceforth the use of ice extended its &#145;shelf life&#146;, and undoubtedly contributed to contemporary improvements in diet and food hygiene.<br>
<br>It was probably similar concerns which led to Leftwich's interest in adequate water supplies. In 1825 he used an artesian tube to sink what was then the largest well known in the country, 80 feet deep and 30 feet wide. Other wells followed, and Leftwich seems to have prospered. He died on 17 November 1843, at his home at 43 Cumberland Market, Regent's Park, London. He was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. Almost nothing is known of his family life, but there were fourteen people with the name Leftwich buried in three graves in Kensal Green cemetery between 1841 and 1904, seven of them, including William, in the same grave between 1841 and 1851. His son Thomas registered his death.<br>
