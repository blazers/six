<span class="headword">Kendall,  (Thomas) Henry</span> <span class="st"> [<em>later </em>Henry Clarence Kendall]</span>  (1839&#150;1882), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Kirmington, near Milton, in the Ulladulla district of New South Wales, Australia, on 18 April 1839, one of the twin sons of Basil Kendall (<i>d</i>. 1852) and his wife, Melinda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> M'Nally. His father, who had been an officer in the Chilean navy, a flour factor, a farmer, and a shepherd, was the son of Thomas Kendall, a missionary to Australia under Samuel Marsden. After Basil Kendall died, while running a school at Grafton, New South Wales, his widow and children moved to her father's home at Wollongong, south of Sydney.<br>
<br>Henry Kendall received little formal education. He went to sea on the whaling vessel <i>Waterwitch</i> in September 1855, and upon his return to Australia in March 1857 set up a house for his mother, twin brother, and sisters at Newtown, in Sydney. In 1859 he began to contribute poetry to <span class="italic">The Month</span>, whose editor consequently introduced him to literary men such as James Lionel Michael, a lawyer who in 1860 employed Kendall as a clerk and allowed him to use his extensive library.<br>
<br>In 1862 Kendall sent a parcel of manuscript verses to <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> in London, whose editor sufficiently appreciated their promise to publish three poems dealing with the scenery of the Australian bush, noting that although Kendall had &#145;much to learn&#146;, his poems possessed a &#145;wild, dark &hellip; power of landscape-painting&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 27 Sept 1862, 394). Encouraged by this recognition Kendall had a volume, <span class="italic">Poems and Songs</span>, printed in Sydney in 1862; but he suppressed it in 1865 on grounds of its immaturity and issued, without date, another volume, <span class="italic">At Long Bay: Euroclydon: Poems</span>. At the same time Henry Parkes encouraged him to contribute verse to <span class="italic">The Empire</span>, his newspaper.<br>
<br>Kendall entered the public service of New South Wales in 1863 as clerk in the lands department, with a salary of &pound;150, and in 1866 was transferred to the colonial secretary's office, where he earned a salary of &pound;200 a year. In March 1868 he married Charlotte, the eighteen-year-old daughter of John Yates Rutter, a medical officer of Woolloomooloo, Sydney. About this time he added &#145;Clarence&#146; to his name, after the Clarence River, but continued to sign letters and publish poetry as Henry Kendall. His domestic circumstances were strained, however, as he was often in debt to friends and moneylenders, largely because of his sisters' extravagance and his brother's fiscal dishonesty. His second volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Leaves from an Australian Forest</span> (1869), was well received but was not a financial success. The combined pressure of this commercial failure, the debts incurred by his mother and siblings, and the death of his one-year-old daughter Araluen in 1870 worsened an existing problem with alcohol. Fearing bankruptcy and dismissal, on 31 March 1869 he resigned from the civil service, and attempted to make a living in Melbourne as a journalist. Things became worse, however, and in December 1870 he was charged with forging and uttering a cheque, a charge of which he was found not guilty by reason of insanity. His wife returned to her mother and Kendall became a derelict, finally being committed to the Gladesville Hospital for the Insane in Sydney from April to July 1873.<br>
<br>Later in 1873, however, Kendall was befriended by William and Joseph Fagan, who allowed him to live with their family at Gosford, New South Wales, as he recovered his health, and in 1875 gave him a job in their timber business. In May 1876 his wife and children rejoined him, and he began to rebuild his family life, slowly supplementing his income with occasional publications. They moved to Camden Haven, and in 1879 he wrote the words for a cantata and hymn of praise sung at the Sydney International Exhibition, and he also won the <span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span>'s prize of 100 guineas for a poem on the exhibition.<br>
<br>Kendall's third volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Songs from the Mountains</span>, was published in December 1880 to critical acclaim and popular success. In 1881 the post of inspector of forests was offered to him by Sir Henry Parkes, a former patron whom he had previously offended on several occasions, even as late as 1879, with his satiric poem &#145;The Gagging Bill&#146;. He was grateful for the job, but his health made him unable to cope with its requisite long rides in all kinds of weather, and he collapsed in June 1882 at Wagga Wagga. He was taken to William Fagan's house in Bourke Street, Surry Hills, Sydney, and died there of phthisis on 1 August 1882. His wife survived him, as did three sons, Frederick (<i>b</i>. 1870), a second son (<i>b</i>. 1873), and &AElig;thelstan (<i>b</i>. 1877), and two daughters, Evelyn Persia (<i>b</i>. 1878) and Roma (<i>b</i>. 1879). He was buried in the Waverley cemetery near Sydney, and in 1886 a monument was erected to his memory. After his death &pound;1200 was raised by public subscription for the support of his wife and family.<br>
<br>The twentieth-century critic T. Inglis Moore has noted that &#145;as a poet, Kendall was over-praised in his own day, then suffered an undue depreciation&#146;. Although he lacked discipline and economy and tended at times towards an excess of sentiment, he had a &#145;gift of song&#146; and &#145;a rich variety of verse forms, subjects and moods&#146; and was an &#145;accomplished painter&#146; of Australian scenes  (Moore, ix&#150;x). He was one of the first Australian-born writers to gain a significant reputation outside his own country.<br>
