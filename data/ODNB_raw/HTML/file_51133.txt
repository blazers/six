<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robertson,  Walford Graham</span>  (1866&#150;1948), <span class="occ">painter and theatre designer</span>, was born on 8 July 1866 in London, the only child of Graham Moore Robertson (1813&#150;1884), a wealthy shipbuilder, and his wife, Marion Greatorex (<i>d</i>. 1907). Baptized Graham Walford, he reversed his names as a schoolboy, but was always known as Graham. He was educated at Slough (<i>c</i>.1875&#150;<i>c</i>.1879) and at Eton College (1880&#150;<i>c</i>.1881), but gained more valuable instruction in the studios of prominent artists. Walter Crane, Thomas Armstrong, and Edward Burne-Jones were among those who befriended the boy and occasionally used him as a model. After studying with the painter Albert Moore (in 1879&#150;80 and in 1885&#150;7), and at the National Art Training School, South Kensington (1881&#150;4), Robertson exhibited his first paintings at the New Gallery in 1889. He became a member of the New English Art Club in 1891 and of the Royal Society of British Artists in 1896. He specialized in imaginative depictions of beautiful women (inspired by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, whom he idolized but never met), as well as landscapes and portraits betraying the influence of his friend James McNeill Whistler. His one-man exhibition at the Carfax Gallery in 1906 (followed by election to the Royal Institute of Oil Painters in 1910) helped secure his reputation as a rising talent, but he ultimately failed to achieve distinction as a painter.<br>
<br>The large fortune Robertson inherited at the age of eighteen had minimal impact on his spartan way of life. Money did, however, free him to pursue myriad artistic interests (which ultimately proved quite lucrative) and to purchase works of art from his friends. He acquired important examples of contemporary painting such as Whistler's <span class="italic">Arrangement in Brown and Black: Portrait of Miss Rosa Corder</span> (Frick Collection, New York) and Rossetti's <span class="italic">Proserpine</span> (Tate collection). Many of these were sold at Christies on 22 July 1949. He also assembled an outstanding group of drawings, paintings, and prints by William Blake. A shrewd rather than extravagant collector, Robertson pursued Blake at a time when his art was undervalued, and he made pioneering contributions to Blake scholarship. His Carfax exhibition of 1906 included a series of colour prints undertaken as &#145;experiments in search of the lost method of William Blake&#146;. In 1907 he edited a new illustrated edition of Alexander Gilchrist's biography of Blake (1863), and in 1952 his notes on his own Blake collection were published posthumously. By gift or bequest, Robertson transferred most of his Blake holdings to art institutions in Britain, including the Tate Gallery, the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, and the British Museum.<br>
<br>Although Robertson never married, he relished the company of older, glamorous women, and was particularly devoted to his mother. His enthusiasm for the stage engendered friendships with celebrated actresses, most notably Ellen Terry, whom he met in 1887. In 1892 Ada Rehan introduced him to the New York theatre manager Augustin Daly, who hired him to design costumes for <span class="italic">The Foresters</span> (1893), <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> (1893), <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> (1894), <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span> (1894), <span class="italic">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</span> (1895), and <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (1895). Robertson's detailed letters and drawings for these productions (Folger Shakespeare Library, Washington, DC) attest to his concern with balancing historical accuracy with pictorial beauty. Daly's cavalier alteration of his designs irritated him, and he preferred collaborating with his friend the actor and theatre manager Sir George Alexander. In 1896 he made designs for Alexander's <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> (Library of Congress, Washington, DC) and in 1898 he worked on <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> in partnership with the Scottish painter Arthur Melville, Robertson's mentor and studio-mate from 1896 to 1904. In 1898 Sarah Bernhardt recruited Robertson to design scenery and costumes for her production of their friend Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">Salom&eacute;</span> (ultimately banned by the censor), for which Robertson envisioned the players in yellow against a deep violet sky. He went on to design costumes for Mrs Patrick Campbell in <span class="italic">Undine</span> (1903) and <span class="italic">Pelleas and Melisande</span> (1904).<br>
<br>Having gravitated towards older companions in his youth, Robertson devoted his later years to the young. Inspired by the infant daughter of his deceased friend Melville, he wrote and illustrated <span class="italic">A Masque of May Morning</span> (1904), <span class="italic">A Year of Songs for a Baby in a Garden</span> (1906), and <span class="italic">Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh</span> (1907). These were followed by other highly popular children's stories, books of verse, and plays. His Christmas play <span class="italic">Pinkie and the Fairies</span> enjoyed phenomenal success when Herbert Tree produced it in 1908 with an all-star cast led by Ellen Terry. Robertson reinforced his growing reputation as an illustrator through his amusing embellishments to texts by Alfred Ollivant, G. K. Chesterton, Kenneth Grahame, and others. During the 1920s he composed and supervised local productions of his plays, pageants, and adaptations of eighteenth-century dramas. His plays manifest the fantastic turn of his mind. In <span class="italic">The Slippers of Cinderella</span> (1919) the title character journeys in her glass coach to an economics lecture, and in the comic opera <span class="italic">The Fountain of Youth</span> (produced by Nigel Playfair at the Lyric, Hammersmith, in 1931) a dog's miraculous rejuvenation as a puppy triggers a health craze.<br>
<br>Robertson's enduring notoriety owes much to John Singer Sargent's masterful portrait of 1894 (Tate collection), which represents him in a long overcoat calculated to exaggerate his slender silhouette, with a jade-handled walking-stick and his poodle Mouton&#151;the first of several cherished canine companions, the rest English bobtail sheepdogs. Robertson's wry wit and whimsical ways provided the model for Jeffrey Panton in Alfred Sutro's comedy <span class="italic">The Two Virtues</span> (1913). He became a cult figure among rising stage stars of the 1930s and 1940s. Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh, No&euml;l Coward, and Lynn Fontanne were among those who made the pilgrimage to Sandhills, his house near Witley in Surrey, where no electricity, running water, or talk of war marred the nostalgic atmosphere. Robertson cheerfully acknowledged that he lived in the past, and his acclaimed autobiography, <span class="italic">Time Was</span> (1931), is a treasure trove of anecdotes concerning the late Victorian celebrities whom he had counted as friends. Robertson died at Sandhills on 4 September 1948 of cerebral thrombosis and arteriosclerosis. By his request, his body was cremated and there was no funeral.<br>
