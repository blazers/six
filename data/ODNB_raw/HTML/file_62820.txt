<span class="headword">Ionides, Alexander Constantine</span>  (1810&#150;1890), <span class="occ">art collector and patron</span>, was born on 1 September 1810 in Constantinople, the fourth of eleven children of Constantine Ipliktzis (1775&#150;1852) and his wife, Mariora Sendoukaki (1784&#150;1857). Constantine had established a branch of his trading firm in London about 1815 and Alexander came to England at the age of sixteen, in 1827, completing his education at Mr Hine's school, Brixton. In 1832 he married Euterpe, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sgouta (1816&#150;1892), in Constantinople and settled in Cheetham Hill, Manchester; the couple had three sons and two daughters. He founded the firm of Ionides &amp; Co., trading in textiles and wheat with the Balkans and the Near East, changing his name to Ionides at about the same time. The family moved to London in 1834, living first at 9 Finsbury Circus, and from 1838 or 1839 at Tulse Hill. He was naturalized in 1837, was Greek consul-general in 1854&#150;66, became a director of the Crystal Palace in 1855, and had several directorships in banks.<br>
<br>Ionides, who joined in several of his father's charitable endowments, including the university at Athens, began his patronage of artists about 1829&#150;30 when he acquired a set of engravings by his friend Edward Calvert, and in 1837 he commissioned the young G. F. Watts to copy a portrait of his father. He remained a patron and personal friend of Watts. In 1860 he was introduced by his son Alexander 
    (Aleco; 1840&#150;1898)
   to several artists who had befriended him in Paris, including Whistler, Edward Poynter, Thomas Armstrong, and George Du Maurier. At this time his house in Tulse Hill was a regular meeting place for artists, musicians, and writers who took part in the family's musical and theatrical entertainments. Rossetti was introduced to the circle in 1862 and he, in turn, introduced Edward Burne-Jones.<br>
<br>Philip Webb remodelled the interior of 1 Holland Park, to which the Ionides family had moved in 1864, and in 1870 Thomas Jeckyll was commissioned to decorate several rooms, notably the billiard room which was in the Japanese style with inset Japanese paintings. After 1875 the refurbishment was continued by Aleco, who commissioned William Morris and Walter Crane to undertake extensive decoration, and by 1890 the house had become a showpiece of the aesthetic movement. With Aleco also, Ionides built up a collection of Greek vases and tanagra figures. Of his other children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14441/', "Constantine Alexander Ionides (1833&#150;1900)")</script>, Aglaia Coronio (1834&#150;1906), confidante of Morris and friend of Rossetti, and Luke Ionides (1837&#150;1924), a lifelong friend of Whistler, were also art patrons and collectors.<br>
<br>Ionides bought mainly from his artist friends. About 1870 he was asked by the dealer Murray Marks to help finance an agency to deal in works by Watts, Burne-Jones, Rossetti, and Whistler. The partnership came to nothing, but Ionides acquired sixteen plates of Whistler's <span class="italic">Thames</span> set, from which he had 100 sets printed. His will lists eighty-six paintings and drawings, several by the artists mentioned and also, among others, by Fantin-Latour and Albert Moore. He is immortalized in Du Maurier's <span class="italic">Trilby</span>, in which the character of Sir Lewis Cornelys is based on both Alexander Ionides and Arthur Lewis. Ionides moved to Hastings in 1875, and died there at his home, Windycroft, on 10 November 1890.<br>
