<span class="headword">Nathan,  Harry Louis</span>, first Baron Nathan  (1889&#150;1963), <span class="occ">lawyer and public servant</span>, was born at 36 Bassett Road, North Kensington, London, on 2 February 1889, the elder son of Michael Henry Nathan (<i>b</i>. 1852) and his wife, Constance (<i>d</i>. 1949), daughter of Louis Beaver, jeweller and silversmith, of Manchester. For reasons of health his father retired from his business as a fine art publisher when he was about fifty but continued his activities as a justice of the peace and as a keen Liberal in politics.<br>
<br>Nathan was educated at St Paul's School, London, where he was a cadet lieutenant in the corps, of which the future Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery of Alamein was a member, and vice-president and treasurer of the Union Debating Society. It was perhaps due to his numerous extra-curricular activities that he failed to obtain a scholarship at Balliol, and he decided not to go up to Oxford as a commoner, a decision he often regretted later. Instead, he became an articled clerk, was admitted a solicitor in 1913, and became junior partner to Herbert Oppenheimer, a brilliant lawyer with a good commercial practice.<br>
<br>As an original territorial officer Nathan reported for duty with the Royal Fusiliers when war broke out in August 1914. He served in Malta and then in Gallipoli, and was promoted captain, then major, and as lieutenant-colonel commanded his battalion, a unit of the 29th division, during the evacuations at both Suvla Bay and Helles. Subsequently the battalion was sent to France in time for the first battle of the Somme in July 1916. Shot through the back of the head by a sniper, Nathan was in hospital for eighteen months but made a remarkable recovery, although the after-effects lasted for many years.<br>
<br>After returning to his firm Nathan was introduced to Sir Alfred Mond, who became a client. This opened up a new field of interest as Mond was an enthusiastic supporter of the Zionist movement. Nathan became legal adviser to the Zionist Organization, to the economic board of Palestine, and later to Pinhas Rutenberg who founded the Palestine Electric Company and to Moses Novomeyski who formed the Palestine Potash Company in 1930 to extract potash from the Dead Sea. During the Second World War it supplied half the potash needed by Great Britain.<br>
<br>As a power in the Liberal Party, Mond was helpful to Nathan in his political career also. Unsuccessful as the Liberal candidate for Whitechapel and St George's in 1924, Nathan won North-East Bethnal Green in 1929. In his maiden speech he attacked the government proposal to authorize the Treasury to guarantee loans of &pound;25 million without stating the precise nature of the public utility schemes to be aided. He was soon recognized by the house as an expert on economic and financial matters.<br>
<br>When Ramsay MacDonald formed his National Government in the summer of 1931 Nathan followed Sir Herbert Samuel, the leader of what was left of the Liberal Party, in supporting the new government on the ground that its immediate function was to put the national finances on a proper basis. After the general election in October in which the Conservatives gained an overwhelming majority, Nathan was disappointed by the course taken by the new government, stating that it was a fraud under a false alias. He crossed the floor of the house in February 1933 and sat as an independent Liberal for eighteen months before joining the Labour Party. He was bitterly attacked for betraying the Liberal Party but his action was a courageous one, both from the political standpoint and from that of his private interest, because a Labour solicitor might not be popular with the business people who were his clients.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1935 Nathan fought South Cardiff in the Labour interest, but did no more than reduce his opponent's majority&#151;a failure due in part to a libel published by the <span class="italic">Western Mail</span> on the morning of the election for which the newspaper subsequently made a public apology to Nathan in court and paid a substantial sum by way of agreed damages. In April 1937 at a by-election Nathan was returned to the house as Labour member for Central Wandsworth. He became chairman of a committee known first as the territorial army public interest committee and later as the national defence public interest committee, formed to encourage recruiting first for the territorials, then also for the Auxiliary Air Force, and finally also for civil defence. Before war broke out Nathan had realized that soldiers would need help with their home problems and with the agreement of the authorities the Army Welfare Service was built up in the early days of the war. Nathan became command welfare officer of eastern command and of London district, relinquishing the former in 1941. When in 1943 the Army Council put welfare in London under an assistant adjutant-general it thanked him for his &#145;outstanding part in welfare work&#146;, of which he was the pioneer.<br>
<br>While Neville Chamberlain was still prime minister Attlee asked him to recommend Nathan for a peerage so as to strengthen Labour representation in the Lords. Before this could be done Churchill had succeeded Chamberlain. Nathan was created a baron in June 1940 and Ernest Bevin was elected member of parliament for Central Wandsworth. The suggestion that Nathan's peerage was used to make a place for Bevin was not correct. Nathan chose as his motto in his heraldic arms the words <i>Labor nobilitat</i>.<br>
<br>When Attlee became prime minister in 1945 Nathan went to the War Office as under-secretary of state and therefore vice-president of the Army Council. In October 1946 he was promoted to be minister of civil aviation and sworn of the privy council. This was an entirely new field: he had many problems to tackle, notably the development of the state corporations set up under the <span class="roman">Civil Aviation Act</span> of 1946.<br>
<br>In May 1948 Nathan was obliged to resign from the government owing to the advanced age of his senior partner. He continued active in public affairs and in 1950 became chairman of the charitable trusts committee whose report in 1952 on necessary changes in the law became the foundation of the <span class="roman">Charities Act</span> of 1960. In 1957, in collaboration with A. R. Barrowclough, he published <span class="italic">Medical Negligence</span>. He had served as crown representative on the British Medical Council, was for many years chairman of the governors of the Westminster Hospital group, and chairman of the executive of the British Empire Cancer Campaign. He was also chairman of the Wolfson Foundation, president of the Royal Geographical Society, and chairman of the Royal Society of Arts.<br>
<br>As a young man Nathan had been one of the managers of the Brady Street Club in Whitechapel, the oldest of the London Jewish boys' clubs. Throughout his life he continued his interest in training for the young, such as the Maccabian associations which stressed the importance of rendering Jewish youth capable of self-defence. In 1950 he was president of the European organizing committee when the third Maccabiah games were held at Tel Aviv. It was then that he inspected the Israeli defence forces, noting that they were &#145;the most formidable, the best trained and the most resolute in the Middle East&#146;.<br>
<br>Nathan's especial qualities have been summed up as loyalty, warm-hearted humanity, and creative imagination. To these might be added enthusiasm and capacity for hard work in regard to anything he undertook to do.<br>
<br>Nathan married on 27 March 1919 Eleanor Joan Clara (1892&#150;1972), daughter of Carl Stettauer, leather merchant. She was of notable assistance to her husband in his political life. A Cambridge graduate and a governor of Girton College, she was for many years a member of the London county council and in 1947&#150;8 its second woman chairman. They had one daughter, who married Bernard Waley-Cohen, and one son, Roger Carol Michael (<i>b</i>. 1922), who also became a solicitor and who succeeded to the title when his father died in Westminster Hospital, London, on 23 October 1963.<br>
