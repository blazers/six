<span class="headword">Duncombe, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1622, <em>d.</em> 1687), <span class="occ">politician and government official</span>, was baptized on 20 July 1622 in Battlesden, Bedfordshire, the second but eldest surviving son of William Duncombe (<i>d</i>. 1655) of Battlesden, landowner, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Poyntz of South Ockenden, Essex. Educated at Eton College, from about 1634 to 1638, he was briefly enrolled at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1638, but between 1641 and 1646 was abroad, registering at Leiden University in 1643. On his return he faced a conflict of loyalties. His father actively supported the parliamentarian cause in the English civil war but John Duncombe's sympathies were royalist and his marriage, on 12 July 1646, to Elizabeth, daughter of a former chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18420/', "Sir Humphrey May")</script>, allied him to one of the Stuarts' most loyal families of servants. In 1648 a knighthood was conferred upon Duncombe and in 1655, upon his father's death, he succeeded to his Bedfordshire estates. <br>
<br>Duncombe entered parliament in 1660 as member for Bury St Edmunds, which he represented until 1678. Active in committees and a frequent speaker he was given office as a commissioner of the Ordnance office in May 1664. The appointment, held until 1670, associated him with an energetic department and Duncombe here acquired a modest reputation for administrative skills. However, in May 1667 the political world was surprised by Duncombe's selection as member of a powerful Treasury commission and elevation to the privy council. Eclipsed by more dynamic colleagues, such as Anthony Ashley Cooper (first Baron Ashley and later first earl of Shaftesbury), Sir Thomas Clifford (later first Baron Clifford of Chudleigh), and Sir William Coventry, Duncombe was nevertheless recognized by Samuel Pepys as a painstaking, if pompous, public servant of the kind he could respect. His personal weaknesses and his deference to Sir William Coventry were satirized by George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham, in a play, <span class="italic">The Country Gentleman</span> (1669), but unlike Coventry he survived the humiliation and continued to serve Charles II as a ministerial spokesman on financial legislation. <br>
<br>In November 1672 Duncombe succeeded Lord Ashley as chancellor of the exchequer. This was still a minor office with little independent authority, and Duncombe continued to play second fiddle to the successive lords treasurer with whom he served. It was a role to which he seemed well suited, for he displayed little originality of mind and almost no strong convictions&#151;except in defence of the Church of England. On the key religious policies of this first age of half tolerated dissent Duncombe took a consistently conservative stance, sharing Anglican prejudices against nonconformists and Roman Catholics alike. He helped to frame much of the persecuting legislation of the reign, such as the <span class="roman">Conventicle Acts</span> of 1664 and 1670. However, it was on financial policies that he chose to oppose his senior colleague, the lord treasurer, Thomas Osborne, first earl of Danby, and in May 1676 he was dismissed, losing his pension in 1678 and his place in the council in 1679. He died in Battlesden on 4 March 1687 and was succeeded in his estates by his son William (<i>c</i>.1647&#150;1704) whose undistinguished career in parliament and administration was a paler shadow of his own. There were six other children.<br>
