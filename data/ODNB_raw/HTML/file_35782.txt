<span class="headword">Robertson,  James Patrick Bannerman</span>, Baron Robertson of Forteviot  (1845&#150;1909), <span class="occ">politician and judge</span>, born at the manse of Forteviot on 10 August 1845, was the second son of Robert John Robertson (1791&#150;1856), parish minister of Forteviot, Perthshire, and his second wife, Helen Saunders Bannerman (1804&#150;1877), daughter of James Bannerman, parish minister of Cargill, Perthshire. Following his father's death Robertson was brought up by his mother in Edinburgh and from 1857 to 1860 attended the Royal High School, of which he was Latin dux in his final year. At Edinburgh University he distinguished himself as a political speaker in college debates, and graduated MA in 1864. Between 1864 and 1867 Robertson took law classes at Edinburgh. He also spent time in a writer's (solicitor's) office, but was said to have left after quarrelling with a partner. He became a member of the Juridical Society in 1866 (he was also librarian in 1868&#150;9 and president in 1869&#150;70), and passed to the Scottish bar on 16 July 1867.<br>
<br>Robertson made slow progress at first, but he gradually acquired a large practice and a reputation for a sharp and biting wit. He had lost sympathy with his Presbyterian background early in life. At the Disruption of the Scottish church in 1843 his father had remained in the establishment, while his mother had joined the Free Church of Scotland. Robertson himself, on attaining adulthood, joined the Scottish episcopal communion. On 10 April 1872 he married Philadelphia Mary Lucy Fraser (1847&#150;1907), daughter of William Nathaniel Fraser of Tornaveen, Aberdeenshire, and his wife, Philadelphia Lambe Veitch. They had two sons (one of whom died in the South African War) and one daughter.<br>
<br>Robertson's professional interests lay more in politics than in law. An ardent admirer of Disraeli, he did much to promote a Conservative revival in Scotland, and at the general election of 1880 he unsuccessfully contested Linlithgowshire against Peter Maclagan, the sitting member. He became QC when he was appointed solicitor-general for Scotland in the short-lived Salisbury government of 1885, and was returned for Bute at the general election of that year; but he lost office when the Liberals came in, in February 1886. On the defeat of Gladstone on home rule in June 1886 and the consequent dissolution of parliament, Robertson was re-elected for Bute. In Salisbury's second administration he became again solicitor-general for Scotland.<br>
<br>Robertson quickly made his mark in the House of Commons. On 13 April 1887 he spoke with effect in support of the <span class="roman">Criminal Law Amendment (Ireland) Bill</span>. His speech, a defence of the bill on the analogy of Scottish criminal law, was published under the title of <span class="italic">Scotland and the Crimes Bill</span>. On 24 October 1888 he was appointed lord advocate, and he was sworn of the privy council. As lord advocate he carried the <span class="roman">Local Government (Scotland) Act</span> of 1889, by which free elementary education was established in Scotland. In 1890 he received the honorary degree of LLD from Edinburgh University, of which three years later he became lord rector. His rectorial address of 1895, &#145;The duty of educated intellect to the state&#146;, was published in the same year.<br>
<br>On 21 September 1891 Robertson succeeded John Inglis as lord president of the Court of Session. Contemporaries believed that a desire for financial security underlay his abandonment of a political career. Embittered by the absence of political advancement, he wrote to a friend on his appointment: &#145;My life is done&#146;. His tenure of the presidency was undistinguished except on the administrative side. In 1899, on the death of William Watson, Baron Watson, he became a life peer, as Baron Robertson of Forteviot, with a seat on the judicial committees of the privy council and the House of Lords. In the privy council he was often charged with the duty of delivering the judgment of the board, especially in appeals from those parts of the empire where Roman-Dutch law prevailed. In the House of Lords, on the appeal <i>Walter v. Lane</i> on 6 August 1900, he dissented from the majority and held that <span class="italic">The Times</span> had no copyright in Lord Rosebery's speeches published by Lane in book form from <span class="italic">The Times</span> reports. His best-known judgment was in 1904, in the appeal by the minority of the Free Church of Scotland against the decision of the Court of Session in the litigation which followed the union (in 1900) of the Free Church of Scotland and the United Presbyterians. He favoured reversing the decision and giving the property of the Free Church to the objecting minority.<br>
<br>Robertson was chairman of the Irish University commission and author of its 1904 report which, while recognizing that the ideal system for Ireland would combine all creeds, recommended a virtually Catholic university as the only practicable solution to the problem. He remained a keen politician to the last, but dissented vigorously from the Conservative tariff policy. He died suddenly at the Cap Martin Hotel, Menton, France, on 2 February 1909, and was buried at Elmstead, Kent, later in the same month.<br>
