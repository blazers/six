<span class="headword">Thomas, Sir  Dalby</span>  (<em>c.</em>1650&#150;1711), <span class="occ">merchant and writer</span>, was the eldest son of William Thomas (<i>c</i>.1599&#150;1668), a sea captain and merchant, and his second wife, Susanna (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1629), the daughter of John Dalby of Stepney, Middlesex. His father was a prominent figure in Stepney, and left him a very respectable estate, including property both there and in Berkshire. Thomas was able to advance himself further by marrying, on 9 May 1673, Dorothy (<i>c</i>.1656&#150;1722), the daughter of John Chettle of Blandford St Mary, Dorset, a match which produced at least two offspring, a son, Dalby, and a daughter, Susanna.<br>
<br>Thomas soon established himself as a colonial merchant, taking particular interest in the West Indies. In March 1688 he was granted permission to recover wrecks off the coast of Hispaniola, and the following month he was ordered to investigate the activities of treasure hunters in that area. He was also prominent as a lobbyist at court, and attempted to obtain the repeal of a new duty on sugar which threatened the livelihoods of his colleagues in the plantation trade. Failure to achieve this objective led to the publication of his first major work, <span class="italic">A Historical Account of the Rise and Growth of the West Indian Colonies</span> (1690), which displayed a thorough knowledge of both planting and shipping. The tract championed the establishment of a common factory and credit bank to encourage the development of West Indian commerce, and also called for the creation of a council of trade composed of experienced merchants, rather than the peers and gentry who dominated the lords of trade.<br>
<br>Having displayed great energy in the cause of the colonists, Thomas found further opportunities for expounding his views on mercantile affairs. Alongside Hugh Chamberlain, he put forward one of the many schemes for the revival of the English fishing industry, which, it was later claimed, received the approval of a Commons select committee appointed in January 1692 to review the matter. In December 1693 they made another attempt to impress parliament, publishing <span class="italic">A Proposal &hellip; for the Erecting and Managing of a Trade by a General Fishery</span>, as well as <span class="italic">A Supplement</span>. Thomas again argued for the creation of a bank to encourage commercial development, although on this occasion his scheme was to be founded on landed securities. However, the scheme was not adopted.<br>
<br>Thomas found greater success in the pursuit of personal advancement. In March 1694 he gained appointment as a commissioner for the <span class="roman">Million Act</span> lottery, in which capacity his name appeared twice more in print the following year with advertisements concerning the exchange of blank tickets. It has also been suggested that he may have been the author of another publication of 1695, <span class="italic">Some Thoughts Concerning the Better Security of our Trade and Navigation</span>  (Appleby, 177). In that year he was given co-responsibility for the collection of the glass duties, and his familiarity with government revenue probably encouraged him to draft the <span class="italic">Propositions for General Land Banks</span>, in which he betrayed a deep antipathy to the &#145;monied directors&#146; at the recently created Bank of England. Not surprisingly, he was one of the commissioners appointed in 1696 to receive subscriptions for the new land bank, but the experiment failed through lack of investment. He met with further disappointment in 1697 when his bid to administer the leather duties was rebuffed, but he was chosen to manage the <span class="roman">Malt Act</span> lottery, and to oversee the collection of the stamp taxes.<br>
<br>In June 1698 Thomas was again at the forefront of national debate on trade when he appeared at Westminster on behalf of the Royal African Company. The following year he was appointed an assistant of that company, his experience of the West Indian slave trade an obvious recommendation for that post. Although prominent in the City, he soon found himself humbled before the Commons, who questioned him on 25 February 1699 concerning rumours that bribes had been paid to MPs to obstruct the passage of a bill to ban the distilling of spirits from corn. After prevaricating under interrogation before the house, he was found guilty of complicity in the scandal and placed in the custody of the serjeant-at-arms, presumably for the rest of the session. He was no stranger to controversy, having been arraigned on charges of manslaughter several years before. Disgrace before parliament was doubtless a factor behind the subsequent curtailment of his career in government finance, and his reputation was further tarnished by allegations that he embezzled public funds. In early 1700 he was preoccupied with setting his estate in order and obtaining the passage of a private act to sell off the Islington lands which he had settled on his marriage. Such a move may have reflected temporary financial difficulties, perhaps linked to his decision to take up residence in Low Leyton, Essex. He was undoubtedly most eager for favour at the court of Queen Anne, and petitioned in June 1702 to become a commissioner of prizes. However, despite a reminder to the new ministry that he was &#145;long conversant in business&#146;, he did not secure the post, and such failure may have led him to accept the potentially hazardous office of agent-general of the African Company on the Gold Coast  (Shaw, 17.40). Whether he was motivated by greed (the post carried an annual salary of &pound;1000) or pride, the appointment brought him the recognition of the queen, who knighted him on 1 August 1703, shortly before his departure for Africa.<br>
<br>Even for a businessman of Thomas's experience and qualities, the Gold Coast proved too great a challenge. The company's position was already undermined by interloping English traders, while foreign competition and native unrest conspired to render his task impossible. His correspondence back to England demonstrated the obduracy with which he met these difficulties, but he was forced to trade with the English free merchants, such was the weakness of the company's settlements. He was bitterly criticized for this, and for other aspects of his governance, but some of his initiatives were astute, most notably his alliance with the Asante. One of his last letters back to England, written in September 1710, was later published to alert parliament to the desperate plight of the company, but Thomas did not live to see any improvement in its affairs. He died at his post in 1711, and by his will, proved in May 1711, left the bulk of his estate to his wife. His son, Dalby, who served as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, did not long survive him, but his widow lived until 1722, and his daughter, Susanna, until 1731. Both women were buried at Hampton, Middlesex, where Susanna had displayed her piety by erecting a new vicarage.<br>
