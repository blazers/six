<span class="headword">Broad,  Mary Aylett</span>  (1860&#150;1942), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 13 December 1860 at Brunswick Lodge, Wandsworth Road, Kennington, London, the eldest of twelve children, seven of whom survived (three boys and four girls), of Arthur Broad, a mercantile clerk, and his wife, Sarah Ann West. The family had a strong tradition of religious and philanthropic work, Mary's paternal grandfather having given up his prosperous London business to become a Baptist minister. Unusually for the period her father believed that all his daughters should have a boarding-school education, and at the age of eleven Mary was sent to Carlton House, a boarding-school in Melbourn in Cambridgeshire. In 1876 she became a pupil at the newly founded Wandsworth high school and in 1878 passed the Oxford local examination. From September that year she taught at a private school in Gipsy Hill, and then in two other small schools.<br>
<br>But Mary Broad was ambitious to have a school of her own that would teach a curriculum such as the new high schools were offering, and on 29 October 1885 set out with her friend Miss Thresher to &#145;&#147;a very nice little place near Christchurch&#148; called Bournemouth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jubilee Book</span>, 19) to search for a suitable school to buy. They found one in Bradburne Road where the proprietor was about to be married, and in January 1886 it opened under its new ownership with thirty girls. Early pupils remembered Mary Broad's enthusiasm and high spirits, and how she joined the fourth form for Latin and maths&#151;subjects which she had never studied in her own schooldays. In 1889 Miss Thresher, who had been responsible for the organization and finance, left to get married, and the school became Mary Broad's sole responsibility.<br>
<br>Mary Broad had always admired North London Collegiate School which Frances Buss had founded in 1850, and hoped that her own private venture could become a public school like it. But Miss Buss warned her not to put her school under the control of a body of governors until she had herself built the sort of buildings she wanted, otherwise &#145;you will wait many years for them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jubilee Book</span>, 28). But by 1898 the strain was too much for her and she handed over the school&#151;which then became Bournemouth high school&#151;to the Winchester diocesan trustees. (Though brought up a nonconformist she had joined the Church of England soon after she came to Bournemouth.) The original trustees persuaded her to accept the guarantee of a pension when she retired, but as this meant the school would have to forgo an increased grant from the Board of Education, she renounced the pension in 1902. Eventually she agreed to accept an annuity in exchange for the freehold of one of the houses that then made up the school.<br>
<br>Mary Broad's generosity was always unstinted; her favourite maxim was: &#145;The glory of life is to love, not to be loved; to give, not to get; to serve, not to be served&#146;  (<span class="italic">Jubilee Book</span>, 73). And she was light-hearted; unlike North London Collegiate in Miss Buss's time, Bournemouth high school was run with a lot of laughter and only two rules: &#145;No talking on the stairs&#146; and &#145;Keep to the right&#146;  (ibid., 41). She was an excellent mimic with a keen sense of humour, who gloried in jokes about herself. When she saw a caricature of herself, very broad in the beam and clad in her shapeless old cardigan, she ordered that prints should be sold for the building fund. Many of the best-known girls' boarding-schools grew from tiny beginnings out of the vision of a dedicated founder. The big day schools, however, were usually born out of corporate effort, so that Mary Broad's achievement must be reckoned to approach that of Frances Buss.<br>
<br>Mary Broad had aged early and in 1924 retired, first to a house in Bournemouth and latterly to Wallington, Surrey, where she had once taught. Here she interested herself in the Girl Guides and in the local schools. Miss Buss's prophecy had been correct; the school did not have its own purpose-built premises until ten years after Mary Broad left. She laid the foundation-stone of what was later to be known as Talbot Heath in December 1933, and was present when it was formally opened by William Temple, archbishop of Canterbury, in 1935. Characteristically she refused to buy any new clothes for this occasion. Though she came down to Bournemouth at the outbreak of war, Mary soon returned to Wallington, where she died at her home, 34 Grosvenor Road, on 13 July 1942. She was buried in Wallington.<br>
