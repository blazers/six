<span class="headword">Mannock,  Edward <span class="st"> [Mick]</span></span>  (1887&#150;1918), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born in Brighton, Sussex, on 24 May 1887, the third of four children of Corporal Edward Mannock, Royal Scots Greys, and of his wife, Julia O'Sullivan of Ballincollig, co. Cork. The elder Edward Mannock, son of a Fleet Street editor, was at the time serving under his mother's maiden name of Corringhame, though in 1893, after a period of civilian unemployment, he re-enlisted as Trooper Edward Mannock, 5th dragoon guards. His regiment was shortly afterwards posted to India, and there his family joined him in May, at Meerut.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the South African War the 5th dragoon guards were posted to South Africa, and Mannock's family, remaining in India, did not rejoin him until 1901, at Shorncliffe in Kent. Shortly afterwards, in Canterbury, he was discharged at the expiry of his service, and within weeks he deserted the family, taking with him their meagre savings. None of them saw him again.<br>
<br>The desertion of Mannock's father left his family in great poverty, and it was necessary for Edward to earn a living, which he did as a greengrocer's (and then a barber's) assistant, before joining his elder brother Patrick in working for the National Telephone Company. Three years' office work were followed, more congenially, in the spring of 1911 by a transfer to a line gang. This entailed a move from Canterbury to Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, where Mannock widened his circle of friends and articulated the social and political opinions that he was to hold until his death&#151;a passionate combination of socialism and patriotism.<br>
<br>His horizons broadened and his ambitions enlarged, in February 1914 Mannock left the National Telephone Company and travelled to Turkey, where in Istanbul he found employment with the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Ottomane des T&eacute;l&eacute;phones. When Turkey entered the war on the side of the central powers Mannock, like many others, was interned. Several attempts to escape were followed by imprisonment under conditions so harsh that, sick and emaciated, in April 1915 he was repatriated as medically unfit for military service.<br>
<br>Before leaving Canterbury Mannock had joined the home counties (territorial) company of the Royal Army Medical Corps, and on his return, his health restored, he rejoined his company at Ashford, Kent. Promoted sergeant, he chafed at his unit's inactivity and transferred to the Royal Engineers, where he was commissioned as second lieutenant. A chance meeting with an old friend suggested a way out of yet more frustration, and on 1 April 1916 he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps. On gaining his pilot's brevet he was posted for advanced training at Joyce Green, Kent, before, on 6 April 1917, joining 40 squadron at Treizennes, near Aire, in Artois, France.<br>
<br>Mannock was fortunate in that at the beginning of what became known (because of heavy losses) as &#145;bloody April&#146; he was joining a squadron equipped with what was probably the best fighter in Royal Flying Corps service: the Nieuport 17. Even so, his operational career began inauspiciously. He was lucky to survive a crash landing when a lower wing broke away from the Nieuport that he was flying. He also got offside with many in the officers' mess when, as a fellow officer recalled, he &#145;offered ideas about everything; how the war was going, how it should be fought, the role of scout pilots, what was wrong or right with our machines&#146;  (Smith, 64). But the most serious cloud over Mannock during his first weeks on the squadron was the suspicion that he lacked fighting spirit. Eventually questioned about this he candidly admitted to fear, adding that, having conquered it, he was ready to conquer the enemy. It was to prove no empty boast.<br>
<br>Like many aces Mannock was a slow starter. His first victory, on 7 May 1917, was followed by a second a month later, with the third and fourth coming on successive days, 12 and 13 July. With success (and the award, on 22 July, of the Military Cross) came both growing confidence and acceptance, though a handful of his fellow pilots remained unconvinced that he was an appropriate choice as flight commander, to which he was appointed later that month on promotion to captain. August, however, brought accelerating success, with four victories in six days in mid-month, one of them, on 12 August, taking place almost over Treizennes, and resulting in the capture of the aircraft and its pilot, Joachim von Bertrab, a German ace.<br>
<br>By the end of August 1917 Mannock was credited with nine victories, and September brought six more, earning him on 14 October a bar to his MC. In October 40 squadron converted to the S.E. 5a, one of the finest fighters of the First World War, but the autumn and early winter was a fallow period, both for Mannock and the squadron, and he did not score again until new year's day 1918. The next day he left for home establishment, where he soon became restless at being away from combat. A period of intense frustration, serving with the Wireless Experimental Establishment at Biggin Hill, ended when on 11 February he was posted to 74 training squadron at London Colney, as flight commander.<br>
<br>It was at London Colney, where 74 squadron was working up on the S.E. 5a, that Mannock came fully into his own as a charismatic teacher and leader. His first biographer, Ira (Taffy) Jones, whom he trained, has given a vivid account of Mannock's inculcation of the principles of air fighting in a series of lectures that began: &#145;Gentlemen, always above; seldom on the same level; never underneath&#146;  (Jones, 161). &#145;He had the ability&#146;, Jones writes, &#145;to convince the poorest and most inoffensive pilots that they could knock Hell out of the best Hun&#146;  (ibid., 160).<br>
<br>On 30 March 1918 74 squadron flew to France, and by 11 April was settled at its base at Clairmarais, near St Omer. Its first victory, the following day, went to Mannock, and by the end of the month he had raised his total to twenty-one, while B flight, which he led, had proved conspicuously successful. May 1918 proved even more so, with Mannock himself scoring a remarkable twenty victories, including four in one day (21 May). A DSO, awarded on 24 May (with a bar on 30 May), followed. In June he continued to score at a high rate, adding eleven further victories before going on leave on the 18th (and being awarded a third bar to his DSO).<br>
<br>While on leave Mannock was promoted major, as commanding officer of 85 squadron at St Omer. He took up his appointment on 5 July and set about restoring morale in a squadron that under his predecessor, the controversial Canadian ace Major W. A. (Billy) Bishop, had lacked cohesion and a sense of identity. Within days the squadron was transformed, Mannock's tactical skill, combined with his ability to foster team spirit and raise morale, moulding a group of individuals into an efficient fighting unit. He himself continued to score steadily, with seven victories prior to his final sortie, at dawn on 26 July 1918, when he went up with a young pilot who had yet to score a victory. They shot down a German reconnaissance aircraft over the German lines, with Mannock (as he often did to give new pilots confidence) ensuring that his companion completed the &#145;kill&#146;. Immediately afterwards, however, his aircraft was hit by ground fire, and it crashed in flames near Pacaut Wood. He was buried by the Germans at a point 300 m north-east of La Pierre-au-Beurre, although his grave could not be identified after the war. Dudgeon, however, makes a compelling case  (pp. 174&#150;6) that after the war Mannock was exhumed and reinterred as the &#145;unknown British aviator&#146; in grave 12, row F, plot 3 of the military cemetery at Laventie, some 4 km to the east of the crash site.<br>
<br>Where James McCudden and Albert Ball became legends in their lifetime, Mannock was for some reason little known by the general public until after the war, though intensely admired in the RAF. Agitation for further recognition of his achievements eventually met with success, however, and on 11 July 1919 the award of the Victoria Cross was gazetted. Tall and thin, Mannock had a shock of unruly hair, deep-set, piercing blue eyes, and walked with a stiff, slightly awkward gait. Sensitive and somewhat shy, he was at first handicapped by an awareness of his humble origins and limited education but as he gained confidence he became a charismatic figure, inspiring something approaching devotion in those who served under him. He had a keen sense of fun, often expressed in morale-raising practical jokes, but also a melancholy streak that intensified over the sixteen months of his combat career. On his last leave he was clearly exhausted and under severe emotional strain  (Dudgeon, 154&#150;5), though he concealed it well on his return to France. It was perhaps this strain that led him to break his own cardinal rule in flying low over the trenches after shooting down his last victim.<br>
<br>Two frequent claims concerning Mannock need dispelling. One is that he was a fervent &#145;Hun hater&#146;. That he urged those under his command to extirpate their opponents is clear, as is evidence that he fought for a time with fierce vengefulness after the death of close friends. But it is not entirely clear whether his &#145;hatred&#146; was a deeply felt personal one or a means of boosting morale and ensuring a single-minded application to the job in hand&#151;winning the war. His diary, covering his first months with 40 squadron, suggests, by implication, the latter. For instance, of his first certain victory, on 7 June 1917, he wrote: &#145;I saw him go spinning and slipping down from fourteen thousand. Rough luck, but it's war, and they're Huns&#146;  (<span class="italic">Personal Diary</span>, 105). And, after viewing the wreckage of a two-seater he had brought down and seeing the corpse of the pilot, he wrote: &#145;I felt exactly like a murderer&#146;  (ibid., 119). Undoubtedly he became hardened to killing but it may perhaps be fairer to conclude that Mannock was more a hater of &#145;hunnishness&#146; than of individual Germans.<br>
<br>If the claim that Mannock was a &#145;Hun hater&#146; cannot be settled either way, the second claim, that Mannock was blind in one eye  (McScotch, 139&#150;40), can without doubt be discounted. He certainly suffered a serious eye infection when a child in India, and his sight was for a time impaired, but there is no reliable evidence of permanent damage, and Mannock family sources categorically deny this, while several who flew with him testify to his excellent vision. Neither Mannock's human qualities, which made him loved and admired by those who served under him, nor his standing as perhaps the greatest tactician and teacher of fighting tactics and one of the greatest aces of the First World War (his sixty-one victories, verifiable to a remarkable degree, being second in British service only to the highly questionable and often unverifiable seventy-two of Bishop), needs a fiction of this kind to sustain or enhance it.<br>
