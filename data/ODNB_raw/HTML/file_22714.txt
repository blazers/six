<span class="headword">Prendergast,  John Patrick</span>  (1808&#150;1893), <span class="occ">historian and barrister</span>, was born on 7 March 1808 at 37 Dawson Street, Dublin. His parents were Francis Prendergast (1768&#150;1846), registrar of the court of chancery, Ireland, and Esther (1773/4&#150;1846), eldest daughter of John Patrick of 27 Palace Row, Dublin. He had two younger brothers, Francis and William, who were also lawyers, and three sisters about whom little is known except that on their parents' death they moved to Plymouth, where they lived for a time in reduced circumstances. He had also a half-brother, Jeffrey (<i>d</i>. 1879), from his father's first marriage to Maria Reynolds, a sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23442/', "Thomas Reynolds")</script> the informer (of 1798). The Prendergasts traced their roots to Maurice de Prendergast, a companion of Richard de Clare, known as Strongbow, under Robert Fitzstephen; but the more immediate origins of the family's rise may be attributed to Thomas Prendergast, John Patrick's grandfather, who conformed to the established church in the eighteenth century and who had subsequently prospered in the legal profession.<br>
<br>Prendergast was educated in Reading, England, under Dr Valpy (his mother had an antipathy towards Irish education) from about 1817 to 1821; he passed on to Trinity College, Dublin, graduated in 1825, and was called to the Irish bar in 1830. He spent many enjoyable years on the Leinster circuit, learning to overcome a natural shyness and becoming an effective public speaker. In later life he would regale his guests with amusing and sometimes scurrilous tales of the barristers and judges he had known. In 1836 he succeeded his father and grandfather in the agency of Lord Clifden's estates, which he administered for many years. The knowledge and experience gained in this practical work made him a firm advocate of tenant rights and a sympathizer with the schemes of the early land reformers in Ireland. He was particularly incensed by the notorious Derryveagh and Glenveagh evictions in co. Donegal in 1861, and he travelled there to hear the story at first hand.<br>
<br>In 1840 Prendergast was commissioned to undertake some genealogical researches in the county of Tipperary and this led to a study of the settlement of Ireland at the restoration of Charles II, and also of the Cromwellian settlement. His researches culminated in the publication of <span class="italic">The History of the Cromwellian Settlement of Ireland</span> in 1863 (2nd edn, 1875; reprint edn, 1996). This work was based on extensive original research in London and Dublin, and while its tone was undoubtedly polemical, it was a pioneering venture into the law of Irish real property, and remains a valuable contribution to the history of the Irish land question.<br>
<br>In 1864 Prendergast was appointed by Lord Romilly, a historical manuscripts commissioner, to select official papers relating to Ireland for transcription from the voluminous Carte manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Fearing allegations of partiality, Romilly&#151;to Prendergast's chagrin&#151;brought in as co-editor the Revd Dr Russell, president of the Catholic seminary St Patrick's College, Maynooth, co. Kildare. The relationship between Prendergast and Russell was never cordial: the former, convivial and outgoing, was repelled by what he regarded as the latter's primness; none the less, their collaboration proved a success. For five summers in the 1860s Prendergast travelled with his wife, Caroline, to the Bodleian Library where he selected the documents and she transcribed them. At the same time Dr Russell made his selection, and the report of the commissioners was published in 1871. Russell and Prendergast continued to calendar these state papers until 1877, when Russell died. Prendergast worked on at the task, though without realistic prospect of publication, until 1880. Meanwhile he had brought out for private circulation <span class="italic">The Tory War in Ulster</span> (2 pts); and in 1881 he wrote some account of the life of his close friend Charles Halliday, the antiquary and book collector, which served as an introduction to the latter's <span class="italic">Scandinavian Kingdom of Dublin</span>. In 1887 Prendergast published <span class="italic">Ireland from the Restoration to the Revolution</span>.<br>
<br>Although Prendergast's chief historical work was concerned with the seventeenth century he was also an authority on Irish genealogy and archaeology, and contributed numerous papers to the journal of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society. In addition he published a series of anonymous articles in the Dublin press (1884&#150;90) concerning the old houses of Dublin.<br>
<br>In politics Prendergast was a Liberal but with a strong tinge of O'Connellite nationalism. He contributed to <span class="italic">The Nation</span> newspaper and in 1872&#150;4 wrote a series of devastating reviews of the work on Irish history by J. A. Froude. So successful was he at combating Froude's anti-Irish and anti-Catholic slurs that a ballad (&#145;to the air of the White Cockade&#146;) was published in his honour. Entitled &#145;Froude's Lies Refuted&#146;, it concluded:<blockquote>
<div>So here's to John P. Prendergast<br>
</div>
<div>Who strikes for Ireland hard and fast<br>
</div>
<div>Come friend as with trumpet blast<br>
</div>
<div>Hurrah for John P. Prendergast.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>His attack on Froude and his earlier work on the Cromwellian settlement had gained Prendergast, like his friend W. E. H. Lecky, whom he had assisted in his researches, the reputation of being a strong nationalist. But like Lecky he was never a home ruler, and from 1878 on he was a violent opponent of Parnell's general policy. An Irish parliament, he argued, would be fatal for both England and Ireland; he was a passionate defender of the Irish viceroyalty; and, curiously, he advocated the formation of a regiment of Irish guards, clad in &#145;rebel green&#146;, as a way of binding the two countries together. His letters (collected in six manuscript volumes) written to his friend Philip Henry Bagenal, in the last twenty years of his life, reflect his increasing and ultimately crushing disillusion with Irish and English politics.<br>
<br>Prendergast was a brilliant talker, full of anecdote and reminiscence. His racy&#151;and unpublished&#151;autobiography gives a very full account of his experiences of the Irish bar. The flavour may be gained from such remarks of Prendergast as that &#145;I look upon every woman and first think what kind of bedfellow she would make. I then in imagination strip her naked&#146;, and by his reference to the Irish jurist Chief Justice Whiteside as &#145;Chief Justice Backside &hellip; for he was a bare-arsed foundling picked up by an old watchman from the gutters of St James Street&#146;. However, his account of his life has also considerable historical interest, as he was an eyewitness to the Young Ireland rising of 1848 and he has much to say about the influx of Catholic barristers into the profession after Catholic emancipation in 1829.<br>
<br>Prendergast married on 1 September 1838 Caroline (<i>d</i>. 1875), second daughter of George Ensor of Ardress, Loughgall, co. Armagh. His bride was of Presbyterian stock and they had known one another from youth. Prendergast held off asking for her hand as &#145;I got a kind of fear of not making a wife happy&#146;: when he did get round to asking her to marry him she reproached him with &#145;Why didn't you marry me sooner?&#146; She died on 5 February 1875. They had one son, Francis (1841&#150;1897), who after completing an engineering degree at Trinity College, Dublin, emigrated to the United States, where he pursued a very successful career as a railroad engineer. He married Mary M. Childs in 1873 and they had seven children.<br>
<br>After his wife's death Prendergast lived contentedly at 127 Strand Road, Sandymount, Dublin, where he enjoyed a wide circle of friends. Standish O'Grady arranged a meeting in the mid-1870s between Prendergast and Philip Henry Bagenal, who shared Prendergast's interests in tenant rights and Irish history, and there ensued a rich friendship which, despite the disparity in age&#151;Bagenal was many years his junior&#151;endured until Prendergast's death. It was at Bagenal's urging that Prendergast got his papers in order, and he compiled his autobiography &#145;for the purpose of enabling you [Bagenal] when I was gone to write a notice of me&#146;. Following a fall down the steps of the King's Inn Library in 1892, Prendergast died at his home on 6 February 1893, and was buried beside his wife in Mount Jerome cemetery, Dublin; his son was also later buried there. Bagenal wrote his obituary for <span class="italic">The Times</span> (8 February 1894), acted as his literary executor, and sought to have Prendergast's &#145;life and times&#146; published. In 1926 Bagenal learned from Blackwoods, the Edinburgh publishing house, that they would not &#145;with regret&#146; be undertaking this project, and shortly afterwards Prendergast's papers and books were, in accordance with his instructions, given in to the King's Inn Library, where they remain a century later.<br>
