<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pommer,  Erich <span class="st"> [Eric]</span></span>  (1889&#150;1966), <span class="occ">film producer</span>, was born in Hildesheim, Germany, on 20 July 1889, the sixth of seven children born to Gustav Pommer (1852&#150;1937), a textile merchant, and his wife, Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jacobsohn (1853&#150;1912). After nine years in G&ouml;ttingen, the family moved in 1905 to Berlin, where Pommer worked as a clothing store apprentice. Already enthusiastic about cinema, he joined the Berlin office of the French company Gaumont in 1907, before becoming director of its Vienna branch three years later. In 1912 he filled the same post at Gaumont's rival &Eacute;clair, where he initiated the construction of film studios and began his career as a producer. Pommer married Gertrud Levy (1886&#150;1960), a book-keeper, in Berlin on 27 December 1913. Eight months later he began fighting the French on the western front; wounded in action, he was awarded the Iron Cross, but continued his war work supervising film newsreels and propaganda shorts.<br>
<br>In 1915 Pommer co-founded Decla-Film-Gesellschaft Holz and Co., based in Berlin, later merged with Meinert-Film (1919) and Bioskop (1920). At first the company's films featured popular genre material for the home market. Later, Pommer eyed the wider world, by facilitating ambitious product such as the expressionist classic <span class="italic">Das Kabinet des Dr. Caligari</span> (1920) and the early films of Fritz Lang. His budgets and artistic success grew once Decla-Bioskop became absorbed in 1921 into Germany's major film conglomerate, Universum Film AG (Ufa). Pommer joined the company's executive board, established a gifted creative team, and began promoting prestige projects aimed at international distribution. In Britain, he first made his mark as the producer of Lang's crime epic <span class="italic">Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler</span> (1922), and shared the applause along with Lang at its London industry premi&egrave;re in March 1923. Other films that spread his fame included F. W. Murnau's powerful chamber drama <span class="italic">Der letzte Mann</span> (1924), featuring Emil Jannings, E. A. Dupont's <span class="italic">Variet&eacute;</span> (1925), and Lang's <span class="italic">Die Nibelungen</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">Metropolis</span> (1927)&#151;the last costly enough to lose Pommer his contract and temporarily imperil Ufa's existence.<br>
<br>After moving briefly to Hollywood, Pommer was invited back to Ufa late in 1927, where he applied Hollywood's streamlined studio methods to more solidly commercial product&#151;still Pommer's concern five years later when he crystallized the goals of any film as &#145;entertainment, recreation, oblivion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Picturegoer Xmas Album 1932</span>, 62). Keen to foster pan-European cinema, he met the challenges of sound head on, promoting the brief fashion for multilingual production and achieving Germany's first international talkie success with the bilingual <span class="italic">The Blue Angel</span> (1930). Operating his own unit with a regular creative team, Pommer found particular success in the new genre of sound film operetta, reaching a peak with the trilingual <span class="italic">Der Kongress tanzt</span> (1931), featuring his most popular star, the English-born Lilian Harvey. His British reputation, cemented with regular visits to London, continued to expand; in 1931 the film critic C. A. Lejeune judged him &#145;probably the supreme artist of the German cinema&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 24 May 1931, 10).<br>
<br>Though he was known as a spokesman for an international cinema, at the heart of Pommer's thinking lay a dichotomy. An international film, Pommer wrote in 1928, required a story with universal appeal; at the same time he believed that a film would lose its truthfulness and &#145;solid foundation&#146; if not &#145;deeply rooted in its national soil&#146;  (<span class="italic">Kinematograph Weekly</span>, 8 Nov 1928, 41). But as Pommer's career continued, buffeted by economics, politics, and another world war, an appropriate balance between the international and the domestic became increasingly difficult to strike. Immediately following <span class="italic">Der Kongress tanzt</span>, in 1932 he struck a co-production deal with an eager Gaumont-British Picture Corporation to make four English-language adaptations of his present production portfolio, mostly fanciful musical comedies. &#145;Too much German and not enough Anglo&#146;, complained one film critic, faced with the unsuccessful <span class="italic">Happy Ever After</span>  (<span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span>, 18 Nov 1932, 16). Only the futuristic spectacle <span class="italic">F.P.1</span> (1933) made any impression at the box-office. The Gaumont-British producer Michael Balcon, more sceptical than his bosses, reluctantly oversaw the British participation, though Pommer's method of unit production was a probable influence on Balcon's later regime at Ealing studios.<br>
<br>Pommer's German career was abruptly curtailed in 1933 when Hitler's racial policies forced him, being Jewish, to work elsewhere, initially in France, then America. In 1935 he accepted an offer to make films in Britain for Alexander Korda. Pendennis Productions, formed with Korda, strode into life with the nationalistic <span class="italic">Fire over England</span> (1936), based on A. E. W. Mason's novel set in the period of the Spanish Armada, but laced the film with a contemporary message about Britain's need to prepare for war. Strikingly designed, with notable performances from Flora Robson (Elizabeth I) and Raymond Massey (Philip II of Spain), the film received a warm home reception, though its faulty dramatic thrust and lack of what the trade newspaper <span class="italic">Variety</span> termed &#145;Main Street appeal&#146; led to weaker fortunes in America. <span class="italic">Farewell Again</span> (1937) also waved the British flag, conjuring easy drama and tears from the officers and crew of a British troopship summoned back into service shortly after its first journey home in five years. Critical reaction was positive, but <span class="italic">Variety</span> underlined the absence of American &#145;marquee values&#146; in a film dominated by British stalwarts of cinema and stage. Both films, ironically, were directed by Americans.<br>
<br>Possibly scenting Korda's financial ills, Pommer established a new outfit in February 1937 with the actor Charles Laughton, supported financially by John Maxwell's Associated British Picture Corporation. The company's name, Mayflower Pictures, was picked partially in the hope of increasing the films' standing in America, though subjects remained resolutely British, sourced from established middle-brow writers. Rashly perhaps, Pommer relished Laughton as an English equivalent of Germany's Emil Jannings, another actor with an onerous temperament and a physical presence challenging to bring under control. Mayflower's debut film <span class="italic">Vessel of Wrath</span> (1938), based on a slim story by W. Somerset Maugham, offered a flawed but lively bundle of comedy, sentiment, and drama, dominated by Laughton's unbuttoned performance as a drink-loving beachcomber in the Dutch East Indies. When the planned director, the American scriptwriter Bartlett Cormack, proved unequal to the task, Pommer himself stepped into the breach; he survived modestly well, though it was not an experiment he repeated. Laughton's virtuoso but grandstanding skills also dominated <span class="italic">St Martin's Lane</span> (1938), a trivial drama about London street entertainers, most notable for the picturesque realism of its settings and the emerging star lustre of Vivien Leigh, cast as the one entertainer who progresses from rags to riches. Pommer and Laughton moved further away from the freshness of <span class="italic">Vessel of Wrath</span> with <span class="italic">Jamaica Inn</span> (1939), a lowering adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's melodramatic novel about Cornish cut-throats and a degenerate Regency squire, enlivened by Maureen O'Hara's participation, but directed by Alfred Hitchcock with a heavy hand.<br>
<br>The declining success of Mayflower's films, the team's growing artistic conflicts, and Maxwell's withdrawal of financial support combined to hasten the company's demise. Laughton and O'Hara relocated to RKO in Hollywood, moving straight into <span class="italic">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</span> (1939). Pommer himself berthed at RKO for a frustrating two years, after his German passport made it inadvisable for him to return to England from a New York trip following the onset of war. Two productions emerged in 1940, one featuring Laughton (<span class="italic">They Knew What They Wanted</span>), another O'Hara (<span class="italic">Dance, Girl, Dance</span>), before Pommer's contract was terminated in 1941 on the convenient grounds of ill health.<br>
<br>Pommer's career thereafter was fitful and always buffeted, as before, by the volatile world situation. An American citizen since 1944, he returned to Europe in 1946 to work for the American military government for Germany, charged with supervising studio reconstruction and the issue of production licences in the zone under America's control. Viewed with suspicion by many in Germany's industry, he resigned his position in 1949. After an unsuccessful attempt at independent operation in America, he started producing through Intercontinental-Film in Munich in 1951. Bureaucratic problems and mounting physical ailments, the legacies of diabetes, colon cancer, and heart trouble, brought his career to a close after the production of <span class="italic">Kinder, M&uuml;tter und ein General</span> (1955), an anti-war drama that found official German disapproval, critical success, and limited home distribution. Following a leg amputation in America, Pommer remained in the country, winding down his film interests and settling in California. His wife, Gertrud, died on 29 July 1960; Pommer himself died on 8 May 1966 at the Motion Picture Hospital, Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. Their son, Hans-Eckhardt Hermann (John) Pommer (<i>b</i>. 1916), worked in the American film and television industry as an assistant director, production manager, and production executive from 1934 to 1979.<br>
<br>Compared to his lustrous work in Germany between 1919 and 1933, the later stages of Erich Pommer's producing career must be counted a disappointment, though his failures were never all of his own making. From his beginnings in Germany, working for Gaumont and &Eacute;clair, he energetically and tenaciously championed cinema as an international force, and it was his misfortune to ply his trade and prowess in a world so fiercely disrupted by war and its aftermath. Though the artistic strength of Pommer's British films gradually declined, the years with Korda and Laughton remained his most productive since leaving Germany in 1933. It was just bad luck that Mayflower Pictures sailed at the wrong time in history, and perhaps with an inappropriate crew.<br>
