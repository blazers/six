<span class="headword">Kendall,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1611, <em>d.</em> 1663), <span class="occ">clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was the eldest son of George Kendall of Cofton, Dawlish, Devon, collector of customs for Exeter and Dartmouth, and Katharine Moor. He was baptized in Exeter Cathedral on 16 April 1611. He was educated at Exeter grammar school and Exeter College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 18 February 1627. He proceeded BA in 1630, MA in 1633, BD in 1642, and DD on 31 May 1654. He was a fellow of Exeter College from 1630 to 1647, and was ordained priest in Exeter Cathedral on 4 January 1637. It is said that Charles I wished him to succeed John Prideaux as rector of Exeter College in 1642, but he was not elected.<br>
<br>On 24 August 1643 Kendall was instituted as rector of St Nicholas, Abingdon, the king being the patron. He never seems to have taken up residence and in 1655 the churchwardens presented him at the Berkshire sessions: &#145;hath not been amongst us these 10 or 11 years&#146;. Meanwhile two ministers had in turn been intruded into the cure  (<span class="italic">Calamy rev.</span>, 304). In any case he was presented in 1643 by the crown to the rectory of Blisland, Cornwall, despite his strong presbyterian sympathies. He became a prebendary of Exeter Cathedral in February 1645, and in 1648 he was appointed to the sequestered living of Bodmin. Since Bodmin is only 5 miles from Blisland and he continued to ascribe his books from the latter, it is probable that he held the two parishes in plurality.<br>
<br>In 1653 Kendall moved to be rector of St Benet Gracechurch, London, seemingly to be able the more effectively to oppose the anti-Calvinist preaching and writing of John Goodwin at the neighbouring St Stephen, Coleman Street. He was admitted a member of the fourth London classis on 21 November 1653 and immediately elected a delegate to the provincial assembly; he took a leading part in the work of the classis in 1654, presiding, for instance, over nine meetings for an ordination in May. His last appearance at the classis was in 1655 and he may thereafter have returned to Devon as he was one of the moderators at the first meeting of the Devon association of ministers in October 1655. During these years he was engaged in controversy with John Goodwin, whose <span class="italic">Redemption Redeemed</span> appeared in 1651, and to a lesser extent with Richard Baxter. Kendall's <span class="italic">Vindication of the Doctrines Commonly Received in the Reformed Churches</span> was dated from Blisland 14 September 1652. <span class="italic">Sancti sanciti</span>, which appeared in 1654, was effectively a continuation of the <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, since it, too, was a detailed reply to Goodwin's book. Goodwin was espousing the familiar &#145;Arminian&#146; position that Christ died for all men &#145;sufficiently&#146;, but only &#145;efficaciously&#146; for those who responded in faith. For Kendall, Christ died only for those who were elect from all eternity: &#145;we deny &hellip; that he intended to purchase eternal salvation for them all&#146;  (G. Kendall, <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 1652, 2nd pagination, 93). To preach &#145;universality&#146; is to &#145;befriend the devil&#146;  (ibid., 3rd pagination, 30). In defence of this position Kendall comes near to a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>: &#145;To provide for the salvation of all men would have been no grace&#146;  (ibid., 3rd pagination, 73). To the question does our doctrine raise &#145;jealousies and, hard thoughts&#146; about God  (ibid., 3rd pagination, 52), Kendall has one invariable reply: man can neither understand nor question the dispositions of God; man is &#145;no competent judge of what makes for God's honour&#146;  (ibid., 2nd pagination, 25). Goodwin, in a long digression, had attacked the Calvinist doctrine of the perseverance of the saints as leading to antinomianism, charging that &#145;our doctrine asserts the saints are in no possibility of falling away finally or totally, continue they never so loose and exhorbitant&#146;  (G. Kendall, <span class="italic">Sancti sanciti</span>, 1654, xxiv). To Kendall &#145;this doctrine of perseverance lieth very near the fundamental article of the reformed religion&#146;  (ibid., 3rd pagination, 132). He believes that it was essential for the saints' assurance of salvation and, far from leading to antinomianism, inspired such love in the believer's heart that he advanced in sanctity. He allows that there are &#145;stumblings&#146; and &#145;ebbs and floods&#146;, but asserts that the Christian learns from them. If the seeming Christian falls finally from grace this is &#145;apostasy&#146;, and shows he has never been a true believer. Goodwin had attacked the doctrine of personal election and claimed that the scriptural passages on perseverance and election applied to the church at large rather than to individual Christians; this arouses Kendall to especial wrath: &#145;I have resolved not to be angry; else I should fall foul on you for throwing this dirt so shamelessly in our faces&#146;  (ibid., 1st pagination, 60). In each of the books Kendall turns aside to tangle with a more doughty opponent, Richard Baxter, &#145;a man whom I very much respect &hellip; but the truth is he stands so full in my way that I cannot pass on without a friendly scuffle with him&#146;  (ibid., xxxx).<br>
<br>In his <span class="italic">Aphorismes of Justification</span> (1649) Baxter had sought to find a middle way between antinomianism, the result of which he had seen in the civil war, and Arminianism, a cause which he hesitated fully to embrace. For Kendall, Baxter's apostasy in the <span class="italic">Aphorismes</span> centres in his belief that new &#145;immanent acts of God&#146; are possible: election is an immanent act decreed by God from eternity, and Baxter's teaching is an attack on divine providence. For Baxter this belief, found in the teaching of William Twisse, led to &#145;that error and pillar of antinomianism, viz. justification from Eternity&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Aphorismes</span>, 173). Kendall replies  (G. Kendall, <span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 1652, 1st pagination, 133) that any new immanent act must be in God's will or understanding and in either case God would be shown to be fallible. This analysis he argues against Baxter's position that &#145;this (new act) doth make no change in God&#146;. God can make &#145;a moral change in our relation&#146; to himself without that being a new immanent act; &#145;the proper effect of the immanent act (in eternity) is to lay the foundation from which the (new) relation (of justification) can arise&#146;  (Baxter, <span class="italic">Aphorismes</span>, 175). There can in any case be a delay between an original act and its fulfilment, just as there is between the drawing up of a deed of gift and its implementation. But as to the small print Baxter says &#145;I dare not be too confident in so dark a point&#146;&#151;an admission which from his entrenched position Kendall could not make  (ibid., 176). Baxter accepted the distinction between sufficient grace for all men and efficient grace for salvation and attempted to hold the two in balance. For instance he maintained that common grace enables men to live in society, but is not sufficient for salvation. To Kendall this is anathema: &#145;surely the schools of Pelagius owe you a doctorate the next commencement&#146;  (G. Kendall, <span class="italic">Sancti sanciti</span>, 1654, 2nd pagination, 105). Baxter replied to the <span class="italic">Vindication</span> in 1654 with <span class="italic">The Reduction of a Digressor</span>, covering much the same ground as the <span class="italic">Aphorismes</span>. The controversy between the two men features frequently in Baxter's <span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, with his friends writing to commiserate with him. The hatchet was finally buried thanks to Archbishop Ussher's intervention. Kendall was appointed to the vacant vicarage of Kenton in Devon in 1656. From there he produced in the following year his third major book. This was <span class="italic">Fur pro tribunali</span>, a collection of works, all in Latin. Most important was his defence of the doctrine of predestination, written in the form of a dialogue, against an anonymous work, <span class="italic">Fur praedestinatus</span>. There were also an exegesis of the 1595 Lambeth articles, an oration against neo-pelagianism, and finally a life of his hero and mentor, William Twisse.<br>
<br>In October 1662 Kendall was ejected both from his vicarage at Kenton and his prebend in Exeter Cathedral. He retired to Cofton and died there on 19 August 1663, being buried in a chapel adjoining his house. His wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1676), daughter of Periam Pole of Tallaton, Devon, licensed the house as a meeting-place in 1672. One of Baxter's correspondents, Henry Bartlett, advised Baxter that to answer Kendall in full would be &#145;too voluminous and too tedious&#146; and recommended only a brief reply without &#145;particular repeating and answering&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Richard Baxter</span> 1.141, letter 184); he had clearly recognized the obsessive streak in Kendall's character. Baxter himself, who believed that Kendall &#145;thought to get an advantage for his reputation by a triumph over John Goodwin and me&#146;, was somewhat more generous: &#145;he was a little quick-spirited man, of great ostentation and a considerable orator and scholar&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.110).<br>
