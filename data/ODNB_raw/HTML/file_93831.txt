<span class="headword">Birks,  Peter Brian Herrenden</span>  (1941&#150;2004), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was born on 3 October 1941 at Green Hedges, Westmeston, Lewes, Sussex, the eldest son of Peter Herrenden Birks, a medical practitioner and captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps, and his wife, (Maud) Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Morgan. The family moved to Assam in India after the war, though Birks himself was sent back at the age of seven to attend an English preparatory school. In India his father became convinced that tea was the cure of many ills, and would often experiment on himself in attempts to prove it. He almost bankrupted the family in the process and they were forced to return to England in the mid-1950s. Birks was taken out of school for a whole year, being forced to live with his father in a series of guest houses. In 1956 he became a pupil at Chislehurst and Sidcup grammar school, where he excelled in both academic and sporting fields. He then spent a year teaching Latin at his old prep school before going to Trinity College, Oxford, in 1961 to read law on a state scholarship. On 15 September of the following year he married Sarah Anne Hanson, the 19-year-old daughter of Christopher Wharton Hanson, a scientific librarian; the couple had one daughter. After graduating in 1964 with a first-class degree, he spent a year as a Bigelow teaching fellow at the Northwestern law school in Chicago. Birks was now set on an academic career with his main area of interest being Roman law. The advice from his college tutor was that he should study and teach outside Oxford before entertaining any thoughts of returning, and that he should go to University College, London, to study with another Romanist, Tony Thomas. Birks was duly appointed an assistant lecturer at University College and enrolled for a part-time University of London LLM, which he achieved with distinction.<br>
<br>Birks stayed at University College until 1971, when he was appointed to a fellowship at Brasenose College, Oxford. By this time he had separated from his first wife and on 26 May 1972 he married Gwendolen Tilley, a 23-year-old law student, and daughter of Ronald Tilley, bank manager, with whom he had a son and a daughter. Although he loved his time at Brasenose and was devoted to the college, deteriorating relations with his second wife led to him putting his name forward for the chair of civil law in Edinburgh when invited to apply; he was elected in 1981. He was, however, still based in Oxford, having by now met his third wife, Jacqueline Susan (Jackie) Berrington (<i>b</i>. 1946), a statistician and the daughter of John Gilbert Stimpson; they married on 29 October 1984. With the subsequent birth of their son, Birks decided to relocate to England and in 1987 took a chair at the University of Southampton. However, within eighteen months the regius chair of civil law in Oxford became vacant. Birks was the obvious candidate and was appointed in 1989, whereupon he also took up a fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford.<br>
<br>For common lawyers, Birks's fame rests on his work on the law of restitution, a subject he first encountered in the London LLM. Restitution is essentially the law of gain-based rather than loss-based awards, the giving up of enrichments rather than the payment of compensation. It includes the recovery of mistaken payments and the value of improvements to another's land or goods, and the disgorgement of the profits of wrongdoing. When Birks studied the subject at University College, London, it was obscured under such fictitious headings as &#145;quasi-contract&#146;, &#145;waiver of tort&#146;, and &#145;constructive trusts&#146;. Moreover, it did not even have its own textbook, something only put right after Birks had completed his studies with the publication by Robert Goff and Gareth Jones of <span class="italic">The Law of Restitution</span> (1966). This was a great step forward in that the case law and statutory material for this subject was now collected together in one source rather than being dispersed to the four corners of the law library. What the book lacked, however, was a coherent, analytical structure, and it was this which Birks set out to supply.<br>
<br>Common lawyers have never been much interested in issues of taxonomy and structure, as witness the fact that the principal reference work for practitioners, <span class="italic">Halsbury's Laws of England</span>, is still organized around the alphabet. Bringing his knowledge of Roman law to bear on restitution, especially the attempts made by Gaius in the second century and Justinian in the sixth to organize that formulary system, Birks sought to &#145;find the scheme on which the law in [the] cases can be most elegantly and efficiently arranged&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Introduction to the Law of Restitution</span>, 1985, vii). In a series of articles in the 1970s, and culminating in the publication of <span class="italic">An Introduction to the Law of Restitution</span> in 1985, Birks established a number of taxonomic norms for the subject. The first was that the word &#145;restitution&#146; had to be reserved for gain-based awards: the problem was that in common parlance it was often used to cover both claims for losses and gains. Second, a fundamental divide had to be drawn between those gain-based responses triggered by wrongdoing (restitution for wrongdoing) and those, such as the recovery of a mistaken payment, involving no wrongdoing on the part of the defendant (autonomous unjust enrichment). Third, within autonomous unjust enrichment there could be identified a number of &#145;unjust factors&#146;, the reasons for restitution. These in turn could be subdivided between those in which the claimant's intent to make the transfer of value was vitiated, where it was qualified, and where, for other reasons, such as an insistence on the legality of governmental action, the law said that the gain had to be given up. Fourth, and again within &#145;autonomous unjust enrichment&#146;, a differentiation was to be made between the various constituent parts of a restitutionary cause of action, those which went to the determination whether the defendant had been enriched, whether that enrichment was at the claimant's expense, whether there was an unjust factor, and finally, whether there were any defences to the claim. A final distinction was to be made between the type of right, personal or proprietary, awarded by the court.<br>
<br>The Birksian scheme, with its clear language and its rejection of fictions, was immediately embraced by the judiciary and academics, at least those with an interest in rationalizing the law. Indeed it soon became the standard language in English cases up to and including the level of the House of Lords. Further thinking about his scheme, however, led Birks to realize in 1998 that the title &#145;restitution&#146; was a misnomer, and that it was better to split apart entirely autonomous unjust enrichment and restitution for wrongs, leaving the latter to be dealt with in books on wrongs. But this was not the most radical view expressed in his book <span class="italic">Unjust Enrichment</span> (2003). Much the most important, and far more contentious, was his abandonment of &#145;unjust factors&#146;, the specific reasons for restitution (for example, mistake, duress, undue influence, and so on) to be replaced by a model that asked, in modern civil-law fashion, whether or not there was a &#145;legal ground&#146; for the transfer of value, and stated that in the &#145;absence&#146; of such ground restitution should, subject to defences, follow. Ironically, Birks had earlier dismissed such an approach on the basis that the law needed to be explicable to the common man, and while mistake and duress as grounds of recovery could be so understood, absence of legal ground was both technical and abstract and gave no normative reason in itself for recovery. Birks's untimely death meant that he did not have the opportunity to defend and refine a thesis that had yet to be accepted by the courts and the academic community. It was, however, characteristic that he was prepared to overthrow all his previous work (&#145;Almost everything of mine now needs calling back for burning&#146;, he wrote  (<span class="italic">Unjust Enrichment</span>, 2003, xiv)) in his search for the truth.<br>
<br>But though restitution was his prime concern, Birks never stopped work in Roman law, especially on the Roman law of delict or civil wrongs, though his ambition to write a comprehensive account of this area, for which he had been collecting materials all his life, was thwarted by the onset of cancer. He did, however, produce in 1987 (with Grant McLeod) an excellent translation, <span class="italic">Justinian's Institutes</span>, which contained a valuable introduction to the institutional scheme, and particularly its relationship to the modern law. Indeed it was one of the themes of Birks's work that the study of Roman law was incredibly important to common lawyers, not only to equip them to communicate better with their civil-law colleagues, but also to understand and improve their own system. It was for that reason that Birks was a passionate supporter of the compulsory study of Roman law by first-year law students in Oxford.<br>
<br>Birks was also heavily involved in the politics of legal education, most notably through being for many years the secretary of the Society of Public Teachers of Law, which he almost single-handed turned into a vibrant and scholarly institution, and of which he was president in 2002&#150;3. He took great interest in trying to produce a rational structure of the law syllabus the professions expected the universities to teach, which in turn led him to attempt to produce in 2000, with a team of specialist writers, a <span class="italic">Justinian's Institutes</span> for English law&#151;<span class="italic">English Private Law</span>&#151;swiftly followed by <span class="italic">English Public Law</span> (2004) under the editorship of David Feldman. Part of his motivation was his love of the common law and the fear that its incomprehensibility to civil lawyers might lead to the dominance of their laws through the European Union. Like Thomas Wood three centuries earlier, he aimed to &#145;put in some order &hellip; this heap of good learning&#146;  (T. Wood, <span class="italic">An Institute of the Laws of England</span>, 1722, i).<br>
<br>In 1989 Birks was elected a fellow of the British Academy; he was made an honorary QC in 1995 and became an honorary fellow of Trinity College in the same year. His contribution to legal scholarship was also recognized with honorary degrees from a number of universities in Britain and overseas and a fellowship of University College, London. Though a brilliant academic, he was one of the least stuffy persons imaginable. He was interested in academic gossip, and had plenty of his own to impart. He was always willing to share his knowledge with others, most especially the army of doctoral students he supervised and who willingly took some of his more embryonic ideas and turned them into full-blown theses. He was a great supporter of his junior colleagues, spending many hours painstakingly reading their work in draft, sometimes improving it beyond all recognition. His generosity was also evidenced in the administrative burdens he willingly shouldered for the Oxford law faculty. He had a very strong sense of duty, both to his subject and to the institutions to which he belonged.<br>
<br>Birks's third marriage was extremely happy and his most productive period undoubtedly followed his meeting with Jackie. He died of cancer of the oesophagus on 6 July 2004 at his home, Oak Trees, Sandy Lane, Boars Hill, Oxford. He was survived by his wife and four children.<br>
