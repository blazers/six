<span class="headword">Abbo of Fleury</span> <span class="st"> [St Abbo of Fleury]</span>  (945<span class="mult">x</span>50&#150;1004), <span class="occ">abbot of St Beno&icirc;t-sur-Loire</span>, was a French monk influential, by both his presence in England and his writings, in the monastic revival of the late tenth century. He was born in the region of Orl&eacute;ans between 945 and 950. As a child he was put into the monastery of St Beno&icirc;t-sur-Loire at Fleury, which claimed to possess the bones of St Benedict. Although he became a professed monk, he was educated not only at Fleury but also at the schools in Paris, Rheims (where his teachers included the mathematician Gerbert d'Aurillac, later Pope Sylvester II), and Orl&eacute;ans. After returning to Fleury, Abbo was put in charge of teaching and continued his studies, especially in the field of computistics. Probably his first work was a commentary on the <span class="italic">Calculus</span> of Victorius, which is noteworthy because of its attitude to the liberal arts and the light it sheds on the great library at Fleury, as well as for its scientific interest. At the abbey he would have met Englishmen who either visited or spent periods of time there as monks; notable in the latter category are Oswald (in 961 to become bishop of Worcester, and one of the prime movers of the monastic revival) and, somewhat later, Germanus, who after unsatisfactory stays at Oswald's foundations at Westbury, Ramsey, and Winchcombe, was driven into exile at Fleury from 975 to about 978, when he returned to Ramsey in Cambridgeshire.<br>
<br>These connections help to explain Abbo's sojourn in England from 985 to 987. Possibly to get away after failing to be elected abbot at Fleury, he accepted an invitation from Oswald to head the school at Ramsey. There a prominent pupil was Byrhtferth, a notable figure in the history of science and in particular of computation. Byrhtferth's celebrated <span class="italic">Manual</span> (or <span class="italic">Enchiridion</span>) owes a good deal to Abbo, and the splendid early twelfth-century copy of this  (Oxford, St John's College MS 17) includes a computus heavily dependent on Abbo's works and four short treatises attributed to him.<br>
<br>While in England Abbo also came into contact with Dunstan, whose final three years as archbishop of Canterbury coincided with Abbo's stay at Ramsey. A notable outcome of their friendship was one of the key documents of English medieval hagiography, a <i>passio</i> for St Edmund, king of East Anglia, killed by invading Danes in 869. This was composed by Abbo, at the request of the monks of Ramsey, after he had heard Dunstan tell the story of Edmund's death, ostensibly passed on from the martyr's aged armour-bearer. Although the putative facts are English (and less heavily embroidered than the legend was later to become), the literary echoes are strongly classical, especially Virgilian. A few years later &AElig;lfric turned Abbo's <i>passio</i> into English prose, referring to its author as a &#145;highly learned monk&#146;. Abbo also addressed to Dunstan three poems (including a triple acrostic called by Stubbs &#145;A curious specimen of misdirected ingenuity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials of St Dunstan</span>, 410)) and about the year 1000 was sent, by the abbot of St Augustine's, Canterbury, the first prose life of Dunstan with a request that he versify it; this, however, was never accomplished.<br>
<br>An indication of the value Abbo placed on his time at Ramsey is the dedication to its monks of his <span class="italic">Quaestiones grammaticales</span>, the first work he wrote after returning to Fleury and in 988 being elected its abbot. This rather extensive treatise sheds valuable light on questions of tenth-century pronunciation as well as on Latin grammar; to what extent it represents problems posed by the monks of Ramsey is not clear.<br>
<br>From his lofty position as abbot of Fleury, Abbo took an active role both in efforts to intensify monastic reform along lines generally called Cluniac (Fleury, though not technically subject to the Burgundian monastery of Cluny, had close ties with that great house) and in struggles over the relative power of papal and royal authority, the latter being that of the new Capetian dynasty. He became involved with the bishop of Orl&eacute;ans in a heated battle over monastic exemption from episcopal control, and in the context of justifying his position articulated views which seem to point towards the well-known division of medieval society into those who worked, those who prayed, and those who fought. Attempting to intervene in a squabble between the monks of a small abbey dependent on Fleury (at La R&eacute;ole in Gascony) and the local townspeople, he was fatally injured&#151;having thus some grounds to be considered a martyr&#151;and died there on 13 November 1004. He was buried at Fleury.<br>
<br>The literary efforts of Abbo's later years reflect largely the preoccupations of his abbatial office. Several letters survive, as do an apology (concerned mainly with his positions on church reform), a collection of canons which was to be influential on the more definitive collections of the next century, and an epitome of lives of the popes (perhaps drawn from the <span class="italic">Liber pontificalis</span>). There are also an important early work on logic, now known as <span class="italic">Syllogismorum categoricorum et hypotheticorum enodatio</span>, and a few further scientific works, mostly brief treatises on computistic and astronomical subjects. Some of these were known in England also, as witness the appearance of three of them in a New Minster, Winchester, manuscript of <i>c</i>.1025, interspersed among works by earlier writers on computistics  (Cambridge, Trinity College, MS R.15.32/945).<br>
<br>One of the most versatile thinkers and writers of his time, Abbo put his mark on several areas of medieval life and thought, but none more so than in transmitting much that was valuable from the tradition of reformed French monasticism to the nascent monastic culture of late tenth-century England.<br>
