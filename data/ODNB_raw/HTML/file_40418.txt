<span class="headword">Harrison,  Edmund</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1591, <em>d.</em> 1667), <span class="occ">embroiderer</span>, was born in London, the son of Christopher Harrison (<i>d</i>. 1611), merchant taylor, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Cook of Wakefield. He was baptized at St Margaret's, Westminster, on 23 May 1591. From 1599 to 1604 he was a pupil at Merchant Taylors' School. Nothing is known of his apprenticeship as an embroiderer, but the intimate association of his name with those of William Broderick (<i>d</i>. 1620), king's embroiderer to James I, and his son-in-law, John Shepley or Shipley (<i>d</i>. 1631), embroiderer to Charles I as prince of Wales, suggests he was trained by one of them. He must have been working for James I in 1618, when he is referred to as king's embroiderer in the diary of his friend, Thomas Godfrey (1586&#150;1664) of Sellinge, Kent, but he only bore the title officially from 1621, sharing it with Shepley until about 1626, when it became his alone. From 1623 he often served as churchwarden at St Benet Paul's Wharf, the church closely associated with the Broderers' Company, and in 1628 he became warden of the company for the first time, presenting a parcel gilt cup on that occasion.<br>
<br>On 13 September 1630 Harrison married Jane (1615&#150;1688), eldest daughter of Thomas Godfrey and his second wife, Sarah Iles of Hammersmith. In 1622 he had stood godfather to one of her younger brothers, later the magistrate Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey. By 1630 he had moved from Grub Street in the parish of St Giles Cripplegate, to Knightrider Street in that of St Benet Paul's Wharf, which was nearer to the great wardrobe. According to his own reckoning, twenty children were born to him and his wife, but only three sons and two daughters were living at his death.<br>
<br>The civil war temporarily ended Harrison's career as king's embroiderer. By 1651 he had moved to Hartshorne Lane (now Northumberland Avenue), where he engaged in the coal trade from an adjacent wharf. That year he also acted for one of the syndicates of the king's creditors, buying numerous paintings and other items at the sales of the king's goods. These included royal portraits and important works such as Rubens's <span class="italic">Peace and War</span> (now in the National Gallery, London) and pictures by Mantegna (in the Brera Gallery, Milan) and Titian (in the Prado, Madrid). He also acquired Henry VIII's richly embroidered table carpet from the paradise chamber at Hampton Court, and the cloth of state with the arms of James I, which he himself had embroidered for the banqueting hall at Whitehall in 1638. His production of these at the Restoration in 1660, and a certificate from the Broderers' Company testifying to his skill as &#145;the ablest worker living&#146;, helped to get him reinstated as king's embroiderer. He retained the position until his death.<br>
<br>None of Harrison's official work remains, but the accounts of the great wardrobe and master of the robes detail numerous suits, masque costumes, horse trappings, cloths of state, heralds' tabards, liveries, <span class="roman">Bible</span> and prayer book covers, banners and armorials embroidered by him. Elias Ashmole's book of 1672 on the Order of the Garter describes and illustrates two examples: the seal bag and the cover of the red book of the order. For Charles I he also executed rich figure embroidery on altar cloths and hangings. This is closest to his surviving work, a set of embroidered pictures of the life of the Virgin, of which five are now known (preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, and Royal Museums of Scotland, Edinburgh). Unique of their kind in Britain, in being worked entirely in the technique of gold embroidery known as <i>or nu&eacute;</i>, these were commissioned either by Lady Alethea Talbot (<i>d</i>. 1654), wife of Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel (1586&#150;1646), or their third son William Howard, Lord Stafford (1611&#150;1680). Also attributed to Harrison are an embroidered altar frontal with the last supper in the same technique, and an associated pulpit hanging of 1633 with the arms of Sandys of the Vyne.<br>
<br>Edmund Harrison died of a stroke on 9 January 1667. He was buried at St Giles Cripplegate, where a monument (now lost) was erected to him at the behest of his eldest son Godfrey (1635&#150;1677).<br>
