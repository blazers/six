<span class="headword">Ranulf <span class="st"> [Ralph]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 1123), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was a man of uncertain background, whom Henry I appointed his chancellor in 1107. The chancellor was the king's principal domestic servant, a clerk in charge of the court's secretarial and religious services and in receipt of the top pay and allowances. There were also pickings. Some time after 1106 Ranulf was granted by the king custody of the escheated honour of Berkhamsted. But, possibly because of poor health, lack of a suitable vacancy, or simply choice, he did not, like his predecessor and successor, retire to a bishopric. He attested over 160 royal acts, and probably accompanied Henry I for at least part of all the king's visits to Normandy during the years of his chancellorship. But he was also sometimes involved in the government of England during the king's absences, serving as a member of the regency council that assisted Queen Matilda and Prince William, and being recorded as a justice in the exchequer in 1119. According to Henry, archdeacon of Huntingdon, the chancellor also employed his lively intelligence, shrewdness, and cunning to the disinheritance and impoverishment of the unworldly. And as his health declined&#151;he suffered from some unspecified illness for twenty years&#151;so his cupidity and deceit increased.<br>
<br>The moralist had found a good subject, and would not have given Ranulf credit for the good education he gave to his sons. Ranulf sent them to school at Laon under the patronage of his predecessor, Waldric, in 1107 elected bishop of that city, and employed as their tutor William de Corbeil, later archbishop of Canterbury, who was attending the lectures of the great Master Anselm. The archdeacon regarded Ranulf's death, of which he may have been an eyewitness, as suitably ignoble. In January 1123, after spending Christmas with the king at Dunstable, the two set off for Berkhamsted, where Ranulf was to entertain his master. When they reached the top of the hill from which his castle came into view, Ranulf was so jubilant that he fell from his horse and was ridden over by a monk&#151;at St Albans remembered as one of theirs. A few days later Ranulf died of his injuries. Clearly a trusted servant, even perhaps a friend, of the king, he could have shared not only Henry I's wealth but also some of his virtues and vices.<br>
