<span class="headword">Clifford, Sir  Lewis</span>  (<em>c.</em>1330&#150;1404), <span class="occ">soldier and suspected heretic</span>, &#145;far from being of the north-country baronial family was a cadet of the Cliffords of Devonshire, such small fry that their pedigree is difficult to trace&#146;  (McFarlane, 162). He was probably born in the early 1330s. His military career began inauspiciously as one of the Calais garrison captured at the battle of St Georges in June 1351. He had entered the service of Edward, the Black Prince, by 1360, first as a yeoman, but was an esquire by 1364. He was knighted in 1368, whereafter he received an annuity of 100 marks from the prince and by 1378 (when that was confirmed) a further &pound;100 p.a. for life as keeper of Cardigan Castle, as well as gifts indicating a personal friendship. After the prince's death, on 8 June 1376, Clifford became a trusted servant of his widow, Joan of Kent (<i>d</i>. 1385), mother of Richard II. In spring 1377 she employed him to reconcile John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1399), with the Londoners, who disliked the latter's support of John Wyclif (<i>d</i>. 1384) against their bishop and his attack on the city's liberties; in 1378, again ostensibly on behalf of the popular Joan but probably at Gaunt's request, he intervened to seek an end to Archbishop Sudbury's trial of Wyclif. Neither incident can of itself suggest Clifford's own religious sympathies.<br>
<br>Between 1370 and 1372 Clifford married Eleanor, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19451/', "John (II) Mowbray, Lord Mowbray of Axholme")</script>, and Joan of Lancaster, and widow of Roger, Lord de la Warr (1326&#150;1370), from whom she brought a large jointure as well as her own descent from Henry III. Before her early death in June 1387 Clifford had prudently renegotiated the settlement with her son, so as to give himself a life interest in a large estate in Ewyas Harold, Herefordshire. He acquired holdings in six other counties to add to valuable life tenancies received from the Black Prince and Joan, but curiously never established a perpetual estate, perhaps because his son, Lewis, predeceased him.<br>
<br>In 1367 Clifford had fought in Spain under the Black Prince; in 1373&#150;4 he took part in John of Gaunt's unsuccessful campaign in France, and in 1378 concluded his soldiering with Gaunt's expedition to Brittany. He was elected to the Garter in 1377 or 1378, doubtless&#151;as his services in the home crisis had also indicated in those years&#151;with the approval of both Gaunt and the young king's domestic circle, an unusual consensus. His personal service to Princess Joan evidently kept him out of the political mainstream in the early 1380s, and that was to prove fortunate. In June 1385 Clifford was commanded by the king to be in continual attendance on his failing mother; in August he was named as one of her executors; in September he received livery of mourning. Richard II naturally confirmed Clifford in everything he had held of Joan.<br>
<br>Clifford visited France in 1385&#150;6. Perhaps now, but certainly by 1396, Clifford was elected to the Passion, an international crusading order based in France. After the political crisis that overwhelmed Richard II's regime in 1386&#150;8 Clifford became one of the most frequent attenders on the king's council between 1389 and 1393, a knight of the chamber, and a member of many commissions&#151;clearly a trusted and prestigious contributor to the king's determined restoration of his authority. Clifford's experience and his personal standing in France made him a natural choice for missions in February 1391 and 1393 preparing the way for peace talks, and in 1396 he helped negotiate the king's marriage to Princess Isabella. Despite his earlier links with Gaunt it is not surprising that Clifford enjoyed no favour from Henry IV after Richard's deposition; although originally ratified in his holdings, he was deprived of two major estates (Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, and Mere, Wiltshire) on alleged legal grounds in 1404.<br>
<br>When he was in France in 1385&#150;6, Clifford met the poet Eustache Deschamps, who (like Froissart) admired him and called him <i>l'amoreux</i>. He brought back one of Deschamps's works for Geoffrey Chaucer, to whose son Lewis he may have been godfather&#151;the <span class="italic">Treatise on the Astrolabe</span> was written for either this boy or Clifford's own son. Chaucer also addressed a poem to Sir Philip la Vache, the second husband of Clifford's daughter, Elizabeth. (Sir Philip had, incidentally, received a gold goblet from Princess Joan as a wedding present.) Clifford and la Vache, always close associates, are found frequently in the public and private company of those household knights of the Black Prince and Richard II whom the chroniclers Knighton and Walsingham identified as supporters of, and even adherents to, Lollardy [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50540/', "Lollard knights")</script>]. Like Clifford, some were notably cultured, some especially interested in crusading. Clifford himself was said by Walsingham to have encouraged the audacious publication of the twelve conclusions of the sect in London in January 1395. Walsingham also claimed that in 1402 Clifford recanted (informally) and submitted a memorandum of seven radical beliefs held by his sectarian associates. Although prudence may have persuaded Clifford to forswear under the new, unsympathetic, regime, his sympathies remained. He had been an overseer to the highly idiosyncratic will of Sir Thomas Latimer (<i>d</i>. 1401), a determined supporter of Wycliffite teaching, and repeated the key sentiments in his own will (like Latimer's and, unusually, in English) on 17 September 1404; he chose as executors Sir John Cheyne (<i>d</i>. 1414), Sir John Oldcastle (<i>d</i>. 1417), and the equally suspect Richard Colefax, a brazen selection when viewed with hindsight. The fact that probate of his will was granted on 12 December 1404 indicates that he had died soon after making it.<br>
