<span class="headword">Rawlinson,  William George</span>  (1840&#150;1928), <span class="occ">art historian and collector</span>, was born on 23 December 1840 in Silver Street, Taunton, Somerset, the only son of William Rawlinson, who owned a silk mill there, and his wife, Harriet Jeboult. Nothing is known of his education; about 1865 young Rawlinson joined a London silk firm, James Pearsall &amp; Co., which handled the produce of the mill at Taunton. Later, as a partner in that business, he helped to create the English embroidery-silk trade, until then a German monopoly. In conjunction with Sir Thomas Wardle of Leek he reintroduced old methods of dyeing silk with the natural dyes of the East. On 26 September 1867 he married Mary Margherita (<i>b</i>. 1847/8), daughter of the Revd Alexander Cridland, incumbent of Hensall-cum-Heck, Snaith, Yorkshire; they had one son and three daughters. He retired from business in 1908.<br>
<br>Rawlinson is chiefly remembered for his scholarly publications on the engraved work of J. M. W. Turner, of whose drawings and prints he was an assiduous collector. In 1878 he published <span class="italic">Turner's Liber Studiorum: a Description and a Catalogue</span>, which he described in the preface as &#145;mainly compiled&#151;a labour of love indeed&#151;in such intervals as I have been able to snatch from City work&#146;  (Rawlinson, <span class="italic">Turner's Liber Studiorum</span>, vii). Based on the pioneering catalogue of the Burlington Fine Arts Club 1872 <span class="italic">Liber</span> exhibition, and much influenced by the writings of John Ruskin, this was the essential guide for all students and collectors of <span class="italic">Liber</span> prints. A second, much revised, edition appeared in 1906, and was only superseded in 1924 by the more exhaustive catalogue of A. J. Finberg.<br>
<br>However, Rawlinson's other major Turner publication, the two-volume <span class="italic">Engraved Work of J. M. W. Turner</span> (1908&#150;13), remains the only extensive catalogue of the nearly 900 prints, in addition to the <span class="italic">Liber Studiorum</span>, by and after Turner. The researches that led to these invaluable catalogues were based on Rawlinson's own collection. His collecting of the artist's watercolours is reflected in his contributions to a special number of <span class="italic">The Studio</span> on Turner's watercolours published in 1909. His choice collection of Turner watercolours was sold in 1917 to R. A. Tatton, after whose death it was dispersed at Christies on 14 December 1928. Rawlinson's collection of <span class="italic">Liber</span> proofs, of which he had issued a privately printed catalogue in 1887 (with a revised edition in 1912), was sold later in that year to Francis Bullard, of Boston, Massachusetts, and formed part of that collector's great bequest to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1913. Rawlinson's unrivalled collection of other Turner engravings was bought, as a whole, in 1919 by S. L. Courtauld, and is now in the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven. Late in his career as a collector Rawlinson also became interested in coloured aquatints of the early nineteenth century and in blue and white Chinese porcelain.<br>
<br>For many years until he left it in 1919, subsequently taking a flat in Chelsea, Rawlinson's house on Campden Hill was the centre of a large circle of friends, especially writers and artists. He died at his home, 26 Cadogan Court, Draycott Avenue, Chelsea, on 13 May 1928.<br>
