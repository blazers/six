<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Rowland</span>  (<em>c.</em>1590&#150;1667), <span class="occ">translator and poet</span>, was as he himself says &#145;ennyd iau&#146; (&#145;a little younger&#146;; NL Wales, Wrexham 3, 125) than Hugh Nannau, who was born in 1588. He was born at Caer-gai, Llanuwchllyn, the eldest son of John Vaughan of Caer-gai, a manor situated not far from Bala in Merioneth, and his wife, Ellen (or Elin) of the family of Nannau, another manor, situated near Dolgellau in the same county. There is no record of what school he attended, but he did spend at least some time in Oxford, probably at the university there. He refers to this in a letter to a Dr Si&ocirc;n Elis prefixed to his own translation <span class="italic">Yr arfer o weddi yr Arglwydd</span> (&#145;The practice of the Lord's prayer&#146;, 1658): &#145;pan f&ucirc;m yn brith sugno peth ar fronnau eich mammaeth dda chwi, Rhydychen&#146; (&#145;when, after a fashion, I suckled at the breasts of your foster mother, Oxford&#146;). There is no record of his having taken a degree.<br>
<br>Vaughan married Jane, the daughter and heir of Edward Price of Tref Prysg (or Coed Prysg) in Llanuwchllyn, Merioneth. In an elegy composed on his death Hugh Cadwaladr does not mention Vaughan's wife so, presumably, she predeceased her husband. He names six children: John, Edward, William, Elin, Elsbeth, and Marged. In his <span class="italic">Pedigrees of Anglesey and Carnarvonshire Families</span> (1914) J. E. Griffiths records that Vaughan and his wife had eight children, four boys and four girls. He does not mention William, and the other two names he records are Gabriel and Mary. So it may be that there were nine children all told. The eldest, John, entered Hart Hall, Oxford, in 1635. He later married Catherine, daughter of William Wynne of Y Glyn, Llanaber, Merioneth.<br>
<br>Rowland Vaughan's father, John, was high sheriff of Merioneth in 1613 and 1620; Rowland held the same office in 1642, and his son and heir, John, was high sheriff in 1670. During the turbulent period of the civil war Rowland Vaughan was a staunch royalist in politics and a staunch Anglican in his religion. A contemporary poet, William Phylip, refers to Vaughan being away &#145;in the war&#146;  (W. L. Davies, &#145;Phylipiaid Ardudwy&#146;, <span class="italic">Y Cymmrodor</span> 42.233). Another poet, Hugh Cadwaladr, refers to his &#145;bearing arms in war&#146;  (NL Wales, 11990, 571). It is said that he was a &#145;Captain&#146; at the battle of Naseby in 1645  (D. Williams, <span class="italic">A History of Modern Wales</span>, 1950, 109). His home, Caer-gai, was burnt by parliamentary forces in the same year. His inheritance was given to his nephew. After 1645 it is likely that Vaughan spent some time in hiding, in Cilgellan, on the slopes of Aran Benllyn in Merioneth, and in 1650 he was imprisoned at Caerleon. About that time he began to translate <span class="italic">Eikon Basilike</span>, purportedly written by Charles I. The translation was left incomplete, and never published. After the wars it was only as a result of years of litigation that he succeeded in regaining his patrimony. He built a new house at Caer-gai, and died there on 18 September 1667.<br>
<br>Rowland Vaughan was a poet, the type &#145;living on his own food&#146; as it was said&#151;in order to differentiate him and others from poets who attempted to make a living by composing praise poetry to the gentry. His strict-metre poems are what could be expected of a seventeenth-century Welsh squire liking, as he himself said of a friend, &#145;yn hoffi march a gwalch a milgi&#146; (&#145;liking a horse and a hawk and a hound&#146;; Ellis, 144). His free-metre poetry is of a religious and didactic nature, or is used for political propaganda.<br>
<br>But it is as a translator that Rowland Vaughan is best-known, especially as the translator of <span class="italic">Yr ymarfer o dduwioldeb</span> (1630), his version of Lewis Bayly's <span class="italic">The Practice of Piety</span>. Other works published by him, such as <span class="italic">Yr arfer o weddi yr Arglwydd</span> (1658), a translation of <span class="italic">The Practice of the Lord's Prayer</span> by John Despagne, provide practical guidance on devotional matters, or hold forth against nonconformists&#151;<span class="italic">Ymddiffyniad rhag pla o schism</span> (1658), a translation of <span class="italic">A Defence Against the Plague of Schism</span> by William Brough, is an example. Papists were also told that they had strayed from the true path of the Christian faith. To his way of thinking both they and the nonconformists should be, as he was, devoted members of the Church of England. All his translations fit into the tradition of devotional translations that dominated Welsh prose in the seventeenth century.<br>
<br>In his address to the reader of <span class="italic">Yr ymarfer o dduwioldeb</span> Vaughan makes the interesting comment that he gained the &#145;weak mastery&#146; that he had of Welsh letters from his love of the strict-metre poems called <i>cywyddau</i> (&#145;deall, mai wrth fwrw fy serch ar gywyddau cymraeg y cefais i y gyfrwyddyd wan sydd gennif&#146;).<br>
