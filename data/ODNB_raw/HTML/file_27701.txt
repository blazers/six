<span class="headword">Trench,  Power  Le Poer</span>  (1770&#150;1839), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Tuam</span>, was of Huguenot ancestry, being the third son of William Power Keating Trench, first earl of Clancarty, of the second creation (1741&#150;1805), and Anne, the eldest daughter of the Rt Hon. Charles Gardiner of Dublin. Born in Sackville Street, Dublin, on 10 June 1770, he was educated first at Mr Cormick's school in Wandsworth and Putney, and subsequently, after a few years at Harrow School (1780&#150;84), he attended Mr Ralph's academy in Castlebar, co. Mayo (1784&#150;7). After graduating from Trinity College, Dublin, in July 1791, he was ordained deacon in November and received priest's orders in June 1792. He was immediately appointed to the family benefice of Creagh (Ballinasloe) and in the following year he was authorized to hold this in plurality with the benefice of Rawdenstown, co. Meath. He also acted as his father's business agent on the family's Galway estate. On 29 January 1795 he married his cousin Anne, the daughter of Walter Taylor of Castle Taylor, Galway, with whom he had two sons and six daughters. Initially they took up residence at Raford, near Ballinasloe. Trench was an accomplished horseman; during the uprising of 1798 he was a captain in the local yeomanry raised by his father to resist the French invading army.<br>
<br>In 1802 Trench was consecrated as bishop of Waterford, though family commitments may have contributed to the delay in his removal to the episcopal palace two years later. In 1810 his translation to the see of Elphin brought him back to the vicinity of his family. He was a gifted preacher, noted for his charity, and his diocesan reforms included church and rectory building, diaconal appointments, and administrative improvement.<br>
<br>Unlike his brother the second earl of Clancarty and his sisters Lady Rathdowne and Lady Emily La Touche, Trench was at this stage unsympathetic to the progress of the evangelical movement in Ireland, though he was impressed by the serenity of Lady Emily when he ministered to her at the time of her death in 1816. In the same year, although he valued the work of the evangelical ministers in his diocese, his visitation sermon condemned their doctrines as erroneous. However, a courteously reasoned reply in a letter from Archdeacon William Digby was instrumental in Trench's subsequent identification with the evangelical cause. In 1819 he was advanced to the archdiocese of Tuam but, before this, he had publicly committed himself to support evangelicalism &#145;by my influence, by my patronage and by my personal countenance&#146;  (Sirr, 46).<br>
<br>Although for a time Trench's association with the evangelical societies was somewhat diffident, he made clear to his clergy at their first clerical meeting that in matters of preferment spiritual zeal would be as important a factor as talent. Following his public defence, in 1822, of the Hibernian Bible Society, which had recently lost the support of the Irish primate, Lord John Beresford, Trench became the acknowledged leader of Irish evangelicalism, though this role was not allowed to hinder the vigorous performance of his archiepiscopal duties. Clerical inadequacy which had resulted in some defections to the Roman communion was an immediate cause for concern. Societies for the furtherance of evangelism and education were founded and new churches were established. During the famine of 1822 &#145;he was virtually a proconsul&#146;  (Acheson, 1119) in Connaught, where his representations to the government and the relief agencies in London for the distribution of emergency supplies earned him gratitude from protestant and Catholic alike.<br>
<br>Of the evangelical initiatives associated with Trench's archiepiscopacy, Edward Nangle's Achill mission was probably the most celebrated, but not an isolated, example. By establishing his own diocesan branch of the Established Church Home Missionary Society, Trench was able to require his clergy not to obstruct active evangelism among the Catholics in his diocese. The archbishop's unabashed statement in 1827, &#145;We are proselytisers. We plead guilty to this terrific and unpardonable charge&#146;  (Sirr, 487), reflects his sincere commitment to the evangelism of the Bible Society as well as his forceful, uncompromising manner. But such statements were liable to alienate Catholics who had once appreciated his conciliatory spirit. Justly or otherwise, the Catholic <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> (1824) claimed that when peasants in Trench's archdiocese were forgiven their arrears of rent &#145;part of the condition is that the tenantry should send their children to the <span class="roman">Bible</span> schools; and this is the <i>questio vexata</i> between the tenantry and his grace&#146;  (Bowen, 73).<br>
<br>The <span class="roman">Irish Church Temporalities Act</span> of 1834 (by which, on Trench's death, Tuam became a simple bishopric) resulted in the incorporation of the dioceses of Killala and Achonry into Trench's charge, but the sexagenarian archbishop continued to travel extensively on horseback to discharge these additional responsibilities. He died on 26 March 1839 at his archiepiscopal residence in Tuam, and was buried with his ancestors at Creagh, near Ballinasloe. His wife survived him.<br>
