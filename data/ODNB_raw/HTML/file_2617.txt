<span class="headword">Bland,  William</span>  (1789&#150;1868), <span class="occ">medical practitioner and politician in Australia</span>, was born in London on 5 November 1789, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2614/', "Dr Robert Bland (1740&#150;1816)")</script>. William was said to have attended the Merchant Taylors' School, but this has not been confirmed. Certainly, he was drawn to medicine and on 6 January 1809 qualified as a surgeon's mate in the navy, rising to naval surgeon in 1812. On 7 April 1813, while aboard the <i>Hesper</i> at Bombay, he killed the purser, Robert Case, in a duel and was sentenced to seven years' transportation.<br>
<br>Having arrived at Sydney on the <i>Frederick</i> on 14 July 1814, Bland was sent to the asylum at Castle Hill and served there until pardoned on 27 October 1815. He moved to Sydney, set up a successful medical practice, and on 17 April 1817 married Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1797), the eldest daughter of the missionary, William Henry. The couple separated and Sarah left the colony in 1818, after William accused her of infidelity and sued Richard Drake of the East India Company. On 24 September 1818, Bland was himself tried for lampooning Governor Macquarie and was sentenced to a year in Parramatta gaol. He did not again break the law and after release resumed his medical practice.<br>
<br>A highly successful surgeon, who performed demanding operations, Bland contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Australian Medical Journal</span> and became president of the Australian Medical Subscription Library in 1859. Earlier, in 1821, he had begun an involvement with the Benevolent Society that lasted until 1863. His concern for the health of the poor was further reflected in his work for the Sydney Dispensary between 1826 and 1845. He was also anxious to improve educational opportunities for the colonists, rich as well as poor. He helped establish the Sydney School of Arts and Mechanics Institute in 1833 and prepared a plan for the non-denominational Sydney College on 18 August 1828. The college offered a classical education and opened on 19 January 1835. Bland served as treasurer until 1844 and president from 1845 until 1853. His community work extended to patronage of the arts and financial support for the construction of a church at Ashfield.<br>
<br>Bland also became a substantial landowner, acquiring large properties at Prospect and Hunters Hill near Sydney and grazing runs at Yass and Gerringong on the south-western plains. He thus contributed to the growth of the pastoral industry, running cattle and sheep. His interest extended to horse racing, which was one of his enjoyments. All this helped identify him with the landed gentry and like many of their number he became involved in colonial politics. During the 1820s and 1830s he threw his weight behind the cause of reform, supporting the group known variously as the Emancipists, or more accurately, Botany Bay Whigs, who advocated representative government and trial by jury. When the Australian Patriotic Association was formed in 1835 to co-ordinate the group's efforts and strengthen links with a parliamentary agent in London, Bland was made chairman of the committee of correspondence. He played a leading role in the ensuing struggle for self-government and helped draft a constitution bill. In 1842 the legislative council was enlarged, its powers were increased, and provision was made for two-thirds of the members to be elected. Bland was returned as a representative for Sydney on 15 June 1843 and over the next five years was active in council affairs, taking a generally liberal stand. He lost his seat to Robert Lowe in 1848, but regained it in 1849 when Lowe resigned. A year later Bland left politics and did not return until 1858 when he was appointed to the new upper house. Refused an annuity in 1861 at the end of his term of office, he was also declared bankrupt.<br>
<br>Despite this misfortune, Bland stands out as one of the more constructive figures in early New South Wales. He possessed wide interests, contributed to numerous facets of colonial life, and published several writings. Colourful and outspoken, he was noted for his drive, progressive ideas, and professional skills. He died of pneumonia in Sydney on 21 July 1868, leaving his second wife, the coroner's widow, Elizabeth Smeathman, whom he had married on 5 February 1846, after himself being widowed. He left no children. He was buried on 23 July at Haslem Creek.<br>
