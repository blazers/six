<span class="headword">Crisp <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Becker]</span>,  Dorothy</span>  (1906&#150;1987), <span class="occ">author and political activist</span>, was born on 17 May 1906 at 26 Aylesford Terrace, Leeds, the only child of Albert Edward Crisp (1877&#150;1943), railway brakesman, and his wife, Annie Beckwith (1873&#150;1957). Although her father had no settled career, and her mother had been a tailoress before their marriage, the family acquired sufficient means for Dorothy to receive a middle-class education, initially with an order of Anglican nuns and later at the Thoresby High School for Girls. Inspired by voracious reading in theology, poetry, and history, in her teens Dorothy Crisp had a vision that she must become prime minister, in order to save England and the empire. Her unwavering convictions, that England was dangerously threatened by enemies at home and abroad, and that she alone had the intelligence, courage, and imagination to save the country, remained her motivating forces throughout her life.<br>
<br>In 1925 Crisp passed the entrance examination for Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, but never took up her place. Instead, she spent brief periods in Oxford and Vienna, before launching herself into political journalism. She began a campaign of self-promotion, sending her essays and articles to editors and politicians alike, seeking introductions and approaching people of influence. She was published, fitfully, in the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Evening Post</span>, Leo Maxse's <span class="italic">National Review</span>, and Lady Houston's <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>. She devoted great energy to her first book, <span class="italic">The Rebirth of Conservatism</span> (1931). As she had been persuaded by her publisher that her own essay could not stand alone, it also contained five essays by young university men including John Boyd-Carpenter (later a Conservative minister) and an introduction by John Buchan.<br>
<br>The book received little attention, but it secured Crisp's place in political circles and drawing-rooms in London. Never a fascist, and certainly not pro-Nazi (she had too much scorn for any but the English to support a foreign ideology), she none the less found her most sympathetic hearers among the flourishing radical right of the 1930s: historians Arthur Bryant and Sir Charles Petrie were sympathetic, she was tangentially connected with groups like the English Mistery, she spoke regularly for groups opposed to Indian independence, and she counted acknowledged fascists like Lord Queenborough and die-hard Conservatives like Lord Lloyd among her patrons, friends, and associates. Frustrated by her inability to persuade editors to publish her articles, for three years from 1933 she used&#151;with his permission&#151;the name of the industrialist Sir Thomas Polson for her articles in the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>.<br>
<br>Crisp wrote prolifically and fluently, her dominant tone one of anger tempered by scorn and directed variously at Stanley Baldwin, Ramsay MacDonald, Herbert Morrison, and Archbishop Temple. Her political programme was one of ultra-imperialist, individualist anti-socialism. In 1931 she set out a manifesto calling for a reduction in taxation to a bare minimum, a reduction in welfare benefits, the removal of health and unemployment insurance from state control&#151;sweeping away the &#145;thousand petty restrictions&#146; placed on industry&#151;the reform of the Post Office, the abolition of death duties, the promotion of patriotism, and the reinforcement of British power and prestige abroad. These measures, she insisted, were essential to save England from financial crisis and international decay. She took to self-publishing with her anti-pacifist tract <span class="italic">Christ Is No Pacifist</span> in 1937. In the three weeks following Neville Chamberlain's return from Munich with &#145;peace in our time&#146;, she wrote 65,000 words on the &#145;philosophy and the practical acts needed in England to restore her greatness&#146;, to which she gave the title <span class="italic">England&#151;Mightier Yet</span> (1939); the book brought her to the attention of the former Canadian premier R. B. Bennett, who became a sympathizer.<br>
<br>Following the outbreak of war Crisp addressed public meetings around the country and began a campaign to persuade the BBC to allow her to broadcast; the BBC proved resistant to the &#145;extremely forceful young woman&#146;. Following an interview with her, one BBC official noted: &#145;Truculence often accompanies merit, but in her case I am clear about the truculence and supremely doubtful about the merit&#146;  (BBC WAC, file RCont1/Dorothy Crisp, 5 Dec 1939). Her persistence paid off to the extent that she was allowed to make two broadcasts, on the <span class="italic">Calling All Women</span> slot on the Home Service in 1940, one shortly after she had herself been injured in the September bombing. She also broadcast twice in 1942; her themes were British pride, courage, and distinctiveness: &#145;Don't forget. Queuing for sausages, you are saving civilisation and even as you walk you proclaim the temper of the British race&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calling the Home Front</span>, 13 Aug 1942). Crisp's jingoism did not go down well with the BBC, and when they declined a talk about English achievements in the war, she published it in the <span class="italic">Sunday Dispatch</span>, which thereafter gave her a weekly column. Her columns could be incendiary: one issue of the <span class="italic">Dispatch</span> was banned in Eire in 1943 over her criticisms of the De Valera government.<br>
<br>In 1943 Crisp sued the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> for libellously identifying her with Mrs Dorothy Patterson, one of the fascist council of seven; the case was settled with damages of &pound;750 and an apology. The taint of the accusation lingered and was used against Crisp when she stood for parliament as an independent at the Acton by-election in 1943. She took some 8 per cent of the vote, as opposed to the successful Conservative candidate's 60 per cent, and lost her deposit. Finding it nearly impossible to find a publisher for her next book, <span class="italic">The Future of Europe</span> (1944) she set up her own publishing company, Dorothy Crisp &amp; Co. Ltd. Using information gained from her connections, who by now included her future husband, John Becker, an army intelligence officer recently sent home from the Far East after warning his superiors of the danger and likelihood of a Japanese invasion through Siam, and who had acted as her secretary during the Acton campaign, she wrote an indictment of British military policy in the Far East. The first of her own books to come out under the Dorothy Crisp &amp; Co. imprint, <span class="italic">Why We Lost Singapore</span> (1944) was and remains perhaps the most widely read of her books. Her company published an eclectic list of books mainly by foreign authors.<br>
<br>On 21 March 1945 Dorothy Crisp married John Neill Herman Becker (1900&#150;1948), son of Neill Theodore Becker and a descendant of a family of German&#150;Danish shipbrokers and merchants. He had by then become active in the Society of Individualists and the National League for Freedom. She continued to be known as Dorothy Crisp, and kept up her frenetic round of public speaking and writing. She stood again for parliament in the general election of 1945, for Westminster St George's, once more losing her deposit. Her daughter, Elizabeth, was born in July 1946, shortly after Crisp had published her first autobiography, <span class="italic">A Life for England</span> (1946).<br>
<br>About this time Crisp joined the committee of the British Housewives' League (BHL), formed by Irene Lovelock to protest at the hardships caused to housewives by rationing and queuing for food. Notionally a non-party organization, it argued for an immediate end to rationing and a return to the free market in food. Crisp hoped to use it as the vehicle for a large-scale, popular movement, and toured the country, speaking at fifty-seven towns in twelve months, urging members to militancy in the suffragette style to stop &#145;any tendency to totalitarianism&#146; in the country  (Hinton, 145). She became chairman of the BHL in early 1947. In February, following a speech in Liverpool, the Road Haulage Association offered to pay for the hire of the Albert Hall in London for the BHL to attack &#145;&#147;controls&#148;, bureaucracy and nationalization&#146;  (Crisp, <span class="italic">A Light in the Night</span>, 21). The meeting, held in June 1947, attained notoriety but not the success Crisp had hoped for: a planned march of women from the north attracted few participants and the meeting in the Albert Hall was disrupted by communist women, who scattered leaflets and water from the balcony onto the housewives below. It was, <span class="italic">Life</span> magazine reported, &#145;an impressive brawl while it lasted&#146;  (23 June 1947, 34&#150;5).<br>
<br>Crisp's relationship with the BHL rapidly broke down; she opposed what she saw as attempts by the Conservative Party to co-opt the movement, and when a statement was circulated at an extraordinary general meeting implying that Crisp had used league funds for her own purposes, she resigned and issued a writ for libel against the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, which had reported the allegations made at the meeting. Crisp insisted that, far from using BHL funds, the league had been a constant drain on her own income.<br>
<br>Early in 1948 John Becker travelled to Singapore, where he worked as a senior assistant in the firm of Watts &amp; Co., leaving Dorothy, who was pregnant once more, in England. In Singapore he enrolled as a special constable, and was shot dead on 24 August 1948 when (off duty himself) he went to the assistance of a policeman attempting to make an arrest. Four days later Dorothy gave birth to a son, and a few days after that she learned that a bankruptcy order had been made against her, which she ignored. She found Becker's affairs in disarray&#151;he left no will, there was no record of any money in Singapore, and no inquest was held into his death until she travelled to Singapore in March 1949. Although there was a compensation scheme for widows of special constables, because Becker was not on duty at the time of his death, Dorothy was ineligible. The Conservative MP Irene Ward took up the case, but it was not until 1952 that she was finally awarded an annual pension of &pound;500. In the meantime the libel case against the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> lapsed, and Crisp continued to ignore the bankruptcy order.<br>
<br>In March 1958 Crisp was convicted of obtaining credit while an undischarged bankrupt, and sentenced to a year in prison. Her account of her time in Holloway Prison, <span class="italic">A Light in the Night</span> (1960), laced with self-justification and increasingly paranoid that the authorities were persecuting her for her political beliefs, nevertheless offers an interesting insight into the effects of arbitrary power. Granted leave to appeal against sentence, she was released at the end of October 1958. After writing her prison memoir she completed another book, <span class="italic">The Dominance of England</span> (1960), devoted to denigrating the role played by the Americans in the Second World War. She served two more terms in Holloway, in 1966 and again from 1969, for offences of obtaining credit while an undischarged bankrupt, and obtaining credit by fraud. She remained litigious, taking a claim for the Home Office to pay her taxi fares between prison and the courts all the way to the Court of Appeal, where in 1972 it was rejected by Lord Denning. By 1975 she had been declared a vexatious litigant, and was required to seek the leave of the court to begin an appeal against a rent tribunal. Crisp self-published a final book in 1986. <span class="italic">Truth Too Near the Heels</span>, which continued her old themes into modern times, was her final diatribe. Dorothy Crisp died after an operation for a perforated duodenal ulcer in the Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith, on 19 May 1987.<br>
