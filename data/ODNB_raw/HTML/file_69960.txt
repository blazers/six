<span class="headword">Jevon,  Rachel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1627), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized on 23 January 1627 in Broom, Worcester, the daughter of Daniell Jevon (<i>d</i>. 1654), rector of Broom, and his wife, Elizabeth. In his will dated 1649 Daniell Jevon named his wife, Elizabeth, their daughter Elizabeth and her husband, Robert Cooper, a brother, Thomas Jevon of Stowbridge, and a cousin, Thomas Scott of the Overhouse in Barre. He declared other (unnamed) children as heirs with his wife. Beyond the parish record of Rachel's baptism, only four other known documents witness her name and life. The main two are her poems, one Latin and one English, congratulating Charles II on his restoration (<span class="italic">Exultationis carmen</span> and <span class="italic">Carmen <i>thriambeutikon</i></span>, each printed in 1660). The other two are petitions to the king dated May(?) 1662, one for &#145;the place of one of the meanest servants about the Queen&#146; and the other for &#145;the place of Rocker to the Queen&#146;. The first petition informs that her father, &#145;a loyal clergyman in the diocese of Worcester, though threatened and imprisoned, contrived to preserve his flock, so that not one took arms against His Majesty, but could only give his children education, without maintenance&#146;.<br>
<br>The more concise Latin poem (138 hexameter lines) probably preceded Jevon's more expansive English version (190 lines of iambic pentameter couplets). Both &#145;exultation&#146; poems have much the same order of contents: humble presentation of the poem to Charles; his royal lineage; his providential escape after defeat at Worcester and travels on the continent; his triumphal return to England; celebration of Charles, the king, as a spirit of peace and spring, wearing five crowns and figured as bridegroom, royal lion, royal oak, King David, and star (sun). Both poems exhibit considerable education (unusual for a woman then), in verbal and versifying skills, rhetorical devices, and allusions to biblical and classical literature. Both express enthusiastic loyalty to the monarchy and Charles. Congruence between Jevon's (English) congratulatory poem and the petitions two years later led Elaine Hobby to conclude that the poem &#145;was not the na&iuml;ve outpouring that it might at first appear&#146;. It seemed rather &#145;a planned strategy of publicizing her learning, loyalism and humility&#146;, in order to win a position  (Hobby, 19). Rachel's petitions for a position in service to the queen came with Charles's marriage to Catherine of Braganza in May 1662. Whether she received such a position is not known.<br>
