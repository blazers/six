</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thom,  John Hamilton</span>  (1808&#150;1894), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born on 10 January 1808 in Newry, co. Down, where his father, John Thom (1776&#150;1808), who had come from Scotland in 1800, was a Presbyterian minister; his mother was Martha Anne (1779&#150;1859), daughter of Isaac Glenny of Newry. In 1823 he entered the Belfast Academical Institution. He was profoundly impressed by reading the sermons of the American minister William Ellery Channing (1780&#150;1842), with their Unitarian theology and Romantic eloquence, but his Unitarian commitment never entirely escaped the more exalted view of Jesus characteristic of his Arian teachers in Belfast. Nor was he exposed to the rigorous necessarianism of Joseph Priestley (1733&#150;1804) and Thomas Belsham (1750&#150;1829), which so deeply affected many of his English colleagues, especially those trained at Manchester College, York.<br>
<br>In 1828 Thom became minister of the Ancient Chapel, Toxteth Park, just outside Liverpool, but in 1831 the early death of John Hincks (<i>b</i>. 1804), minister of Renshaw Street Chapel, Liverpool&#151;whose brother William Hincks (1794&#150;1871) had earlier occupied that pulpit and whose father, Thomas Dix Hincks (1767&#150;1857), was Thom's teacher&#151;brought him to that important post. Congregational minutes indicate considerable opposition: John Finch (1784&#150;1857), an Owenite iron merchant, protested against the &#145;aristocratical&#146; way in which the invitation was issued by the pew owners; others worried about Thom's youth or, with John Hincks in mind, his delicate health.<br>
<br>The objections were overcome, but the early years of Thom's tenure were difficult. Some members complained of his &#145;stile and manner&#146;, others that his sermons were too abstract and inattentive to practical, ethical questions. Many years later, Thom conceded his immaturity; but at the time he took on his critics with a startling imperiousness, pleading his ignorance of the workaday world, insisting on his entire freedom, and lecturing the congregation on the proper duties of minister and flock. With strong support from congregational leaders, among them William Rathbone (1787&#150;1868), he survived the criticism and remained at Renshaw Street as minister&#151;with a three-year leave in 1854&#150;7, during which he was replaced by William Henry Channing (1810&#150;1884), the son of his American inspirer&#151;until he retired from loss of voice in 1866. On 2 January 1838 he married Hannah Mary Rathbone (1816&#150;1872), the second daughter of William Rathbone, whose eventually futile opposition to the match was based on concern about Thom's health and its possible implications for his daughter's financial prospects. There were no children.<br>
<br>The denomination in England became generally aware of Thom in 1839 when, in <span class="italic">Unitarianism Defended</span>, the Liverpool ministers&#151;Thom, James Martineau (1805&#150;1900), and Henry Giles (1809&#150;1882)&#151;answered one by one thirteen lectures by local Anglican ministers determined to confute Unitarianism. The brilliance of the defence made a great impression, but Thom's and Martineau's lectures contain hints of the subversion that the &#145;new school&#146;&#151;in the leadership of which they were joined by John James Tayler (1797&#150;1869) and Charles Wicksteed (1810&#150;1885)&#151;visited on post-Priestleyan rational religion over the next thirty years, rejecting materialism and necessity, subordinating the nexus of religion and science, and questioning the authority of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> as testimony.<br>
<br>Thom's views were reinforced by Joseph Blanco White (1775&#150;1841), the former Spanish priest and once an influential figure at Oriel College, Oxford, who lived his last years in Liverpool; in 1845 Thom published a life of Blanco White, based on White's own accounts. He had written a memoir of his predecessor, John Hincks, in an edition of his sermons (1832) and was to publish a biographical account of his friend Tayler incorporating his letters (1872). Eventually Tayler and Martineau moved to London as professors and successive principals at Manchester College, but Thom remained in Liverpool, where his relative leisure allowed him to edit the <span class="italic">Christian Teacher</span> in 1839&#150;44 and to take the lead in the shared editorship of its greatly influential successor, the <span class="italic">Prospective Review</span> (1845&#150;55).<br>
<br>The conflict between the &#145;new school&#146; of Thom and his friends and the &#145;old school&#146; of the Priestleyans came to a head in 1866 in a conservative resolution insisting on a broadly worded commitment to historical Unitarianism as a qualification for membership in the British and Foreign Unitarian Association. Although the new school was probably in a minority among Unitarian ministers and laymen at the crucial meeting, long-standing Unitarian resistance to anything resembling a creed assured the overwhelming defeat of the resolution. Martineau and Thom were less successful in their next initiative, to submerge the Unitarian identity and name in the Free Christian movement.<br>
<br>Members of the new school led a revolution in taste as well as in doctrine. Although nearly everyone in their generation had been deeply affected by Romantic poetry, and while there was general sympathy with the Gothic revival so dramatically embodied in new Unitarian churches built in mid-century, the new school carried the Romantic impulse to the very centre of their thought and into their language. The reservations of Thom's early hearers were soon swept away, and the diary of George Holt (1790&#150;1861), one of the great Liverpool Unitarian merchants, repeatedly records his dissatisfaction with preaching elsewhere compared with Renshaw Street. L. P. Jacks (1860&#150;1955), a later minister there, continued to regard Thom as the finest preacher of them all, though many readers a century later may find his sermons (the best-known of several collections is <span class="italic">Laws of Life after the Mind of Christ</span>, 1882, 1886) highly convoluted (yet precise) in rhetoric and too self-conscious in the deliberate, lapidary creation of verbal beauty. Although privately Thom could reveal a sly sense of humour, in public he was an awe-inspiring figure, and it was said in Liverpool that merely seeing him enter the pulpit did one as much good as hearing a sermon from anyone else.<br>
<br>Thom exercised wide influence in another area of Unitarian activity where there was little disagreement. The domestic mission movement&#151;aimed not at proselytizing but at reclaiming the dignity and self-worth of the poorest of the poor&#151;was begun in Boston by the American minister Joseph Tuckerman (1778&#150;1840). On a tour of England in 1833&#150;4, Tuckerman made a particular impression in Liverpool, and while missions were established in almost every major town starting in London, the mission in Liverpool, established in 1836, may have been the best-known of them all. Much of this fame was owing to the death of its first missionary, the Revd John Johns (<i>b</i>. 1801), from cholera in 1847. Thom did not himself go regularly into the slums: ministers confided that task to missionaries thought to have special abilities, and their reports provided the texts on which ministers could descant in drawing support from their wealthy and comfortable hearers. The methods of the movement meshed superbly with the way in which Thom and his friends saw religion, as well as social improvement, as an intensely individual experience&#151;in his words, &#145;heart acting on heart, conscience on conscience, soul on soul, man on man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Religion, the Church, and the People</span>, 1849, 25). Thom and Martineau never abandoned that view, though all about them the rage grew for collective solutions, legislative intervention, and even socialism.<br>
<br>After his retirement, Thom remained in Liverpool and in regular attendance at Renshaw Street. Clad in immaculate broadcloth and conveyed in a smart brougham, he was a daunting presence for the youthful Jacks, who knew that he was constantly being judged by, and against, his distinguished predecessor: Thom once rebuked him for derogating from ministerial dignity by riding a bicycle. Thom died of old age and exhaustion at his residence, Oakfield, in Sefton Park, Liverpool, on 2 September 1894, and was interred on 7 September in the burial-ground at the Ancient Chapel, Toxteth Park.<br>
