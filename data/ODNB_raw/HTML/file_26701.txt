<span class="headword">Stuart, Lord  Dudley Coutts</span>  (1803&#150;1854), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 11 January 1803 in South Audley Street, London, the only son of John Stuart, first marquess of Bute (1744&#150;1814), and his second wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1832), daughter of Thomas Coutts, a banker. Although Dudley and his sister Frances (1801&#150;1859) were the only children of this couple, Stuart had no chance of succession to his father's title, as John Stuart had ten children with his first wife, seven sons among them. At least three of Stuart's half-brothers had sat in parliament and that fact&#151;together with the memory of the career of their grandfather John Stuart, third earl of Bute&#151;had certainly some influence on the atmosphere in which he was brought up. Among his youthful associates were Dudley Ryder, Lord Sandon, and Lord Holland's son Henry Edward Fox. He was also steered towards public activity by his beloved mother, who superintended his education. His home tutor was the Revd Edmund Mortlock, and they travelled in Italy. Charles Dickens's <span class="italic">Uncommercial Traveller</span> paper, &#145;The Italian Prisoner&#146;, is a romanticized account of how Stuart secured the release of a political prisoner about this time.<br>
<br>In 1820 Stuart became a member of Christ's College, Cambridge. Three years later (1823) he graduated MA. Soon after that, in 1824 and to the consternation of many of his relatives and friends, he married Napoleon's niece Christina Alexandrina Egypta (1798&#150;1847), daughter of Lucien Bonaparte, prince of Canino. They married at Rome, in secret, and according to Roman Catholic rites. On 21 May 1826 they went through an Anglican ceremony in Florence. The reappearance in 1827 of Christina's first husband, a Swede, Count Aasvid de Poss&eacute;&#151;who had been reported dead&#151;was an inconvenience: one that required a papal dispensation for an annulment, which was granted the following year. Despite the birth of a son&#151;Paul Amadeus Francis (1825&#150;1889)&#151;the Stuarts' marriage proved a failure. By 1840 Lady Stuart had left their only child with her husband and moved to Rome. She died there on 19 May 1847.<br>
<br>In the meantime, Stuart was elected to the House of Commons as the Liberal member for Arundel (1830). He was re-elected in 1831, 1832, and 1835. The greatest influence on Stuart's views was his uncle, and first political mentor, Sir Francis Burdett. Drawn by his example, Lord Dudley joined the group of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> supporters. His parliamentary maiden speech was made in favour of the bill, on 7 March 1831.<br>
<br>In 1832 Stuart became acquainted with a few participants of the suppressed Polish uprising of 1830&#150;31, who had emigrated to western Europe. Three of them, Prince Adam Czartoryski, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, and Count Wladyslaw Zamoyski, soon became intimate friends. Czartoryski especially, a former minister of Emperor Alexander I and in 1830&#150;31 one of the leaders of the Polish national government, made a deep impression on Stuart. The fascination of the prince's personality, newly discovered family connections with him, and Stuart's approbation of Czartoryski's political opinions, gave a stimulus to his activities on behalf of the Poles.<br>
<br>There were two main aspects of this activity. As early as 1833 Stuart became the leading organizer of the action to provide help for hundreds of Polish refugees who had arrived in England. He was supported by the members of the London Literary Association of the Friends of Poland (LAFP), established by Thomas Campbell in 1832. In 1833, accepting the post of one of its vice-presidents, Lord Dudley became <i>spiritus movens</i> of the association, far more active than the nominal president, Thomas Wentworth Beaumont. After Beaumont's death in 1848 Stuart took over his function and performed it until 1854. Under his guidance LAFP organized many public subscriptions for the relief of the Poles. In 1834, as a result of Stuart's motion, the House of Commons voted an annual grant for the Polish exiles of &pound;10,000. LAFP distributed the grant&#151;which was renewed every year at a different amount&#151;until 1838, when the Treasury took over the task.<br>
<br>The engagement of Lord Dudley in affording the relief for the Poles was as strong as his support for their political claims. He was convinced that restoration of Poland would not only be an act of justice, but it also would help to eliminate a menace to British interests caused by Russian expansion in the Middle East. Until 1837 he expressed these opinions mostly in parliament, where he was supported by Sir Stratford Canning, Joseph Hume, Robert Cutlar Fergusson, David Urquhart, and several other politicians. Debates initiated by them played a considerable role in stirring up the anti-Russian feelings in England. But theories about the growing danger from Russia and the necessity of supporting Turkey had also their eloquent opponents at that time. One of them was Richard Cobden, who regarded the British Russophobes as false prophets and dangerous warmongers.<br>
<br>In 1837 Stuart was defeated at Arundel by Lord Fitzalan. For the next decade he could only give some informal inspiration to parliamentary debates on Poland. Pro-Polish agitation was meanwhile led by him at public meetings, in private conversations, and through the press and other publications, which included <span class="italic">Speech of Lord Dudley Stuart on the policy of Russia delivered in the House of Commons, Friday, February 19, 1836</span> (1836), <span class="italic">An appeal of the Literary Association of the Friends of Poland to the inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland in behalf of the Polish refugees</span> (1840), and the <span class="italic">Speech of Lord Dudley Stuart in the House of Commons on the 16th of May, 1848 with official and other documents relating to the insurrection in Posen and the bombardment of Cracow</span> (1848). He also facilitated the contacts between British officials and the Poles and backed up Czartoryski's political undertakings.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1847 Stuart returned to Westminster, via the metropolitan borough of Marylebone. He was re-elected in 1852, and kept the seat until his death. In the spring of 1848, with continental Europe in turmoil, Lord Dudley shared the opinion that the restoration of Poland was very close. He tried to gain active support in Whitehall for that idea but with no positive results. Once hopes for Poland had vanished, he started to organize help for Hungarians, who were fighting for independence. After the suppression of the Hungarian uprising (1849) he was among those who insisted on firm British action in defence of several thousand emigrants who took refuge in Turkey and whose extradition was demanded by eastern powers.<br>
<br>From 1850 Stuart's public activity declined. Yet his contacts with the Poles were not suspended: in 1853 and 1854 he spent a few weeks in Turkey, inducing local authorities to form Polish military units and to use these against Russia. In the autumn of 1854 he went to Sweden where, in conversations with King Oscar I and his advisers, he sought approval of the idea of the restoration of Poland and encouraged the Swedes to take part in the war. All of these activities broke off suddenly. Stuart died in Stockholm on 17 November 1854 of pneumonia, which followed a typhoid fever. His body was returned to England and he was buried in All Saints parish church, Hertford, on 16 December 1854. <span class="italic">Burke's Peerage</span> (1857), a publication not easily moved to elegy, recorded that his death was &#145;deeply lamented&#146;.<br>
