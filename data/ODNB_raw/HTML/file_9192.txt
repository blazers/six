<span class="headword">Farren,  Henry</span>  (1827&#150;1860), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in London on 10 July 1827, the younger son of the actors <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9193/', "William Farren (1786&#150;1861)")</script> and his companion (later wife), <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49704/', "Harriet Elizabeth Savill, n&#233;e Diddear, known as Mrs Faucit (1789&#150;1857)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49703/', "Saville, John Faucit")</script>]. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33090/', "William Farren (1825&#150;1908)")</script> was his elder brother. Henry Farren made some provincial appearances in 1846 (at Birmingham and Manchester) and 1847 (at Nottingham, Liverpool, Norwich, and Brighton), mostly in comedy but with occasional roles such as Mercutio to support starring tragedians. On 16 August 1847 he married Ellen Smithson, the daughter of a solicitor's clerk. Eventually they had three daughters: Ellen (called Nellie), Harriet Letitia, and Florence; all became actresses, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33089/', "Nellie Farren")</script> being particularly successful and popular.<br>
<br>On 2 October 1847 Henry Farren made his London d&eacute;but at the Haymarket as Charles Surface to his father's Sir Peter Teazle in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>. Reviewers approved his easy, natural bearing but found his speech too harsh and measured for light comedy. In the spring of 1849 he briefly managed the New Strand Theatre but soon relinquished control to his father, under whose direction he acted such parts as Dazzle in Boucicault's <span class="italic">London Assurance</span>. In September 1850 he moved to the Olympic with the elder Farren, who appointed him acting manager. He now essayed some heavier roles, not only in established dramas, but also in two new blank-verse tragedies (by that time rare theatrical ventures): he created the part of De Fontaine in Westland Marston's <span class="italic">Philip of France and Marie de Meranie</span>, with G. V. Brooke and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9200/', "Helen Faucit")</script> (Farren's half-sister) in the starring roles (November 1850), and the title character in <span class="italic">The Warden of Galway</span> by a clergyman named Groves (May 1852). The first production was acclaimed, the second hissingly condemned&#151;the audience, according to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, was repelled by the subject matter and the unexpectedly grim ending. Farren, however, won praise from the <span class="italic">Theatrical Journal</span> for the &#145;power and intelligence&#146; with which he portrayed his unsympathetic part, an inflexibly just public official who sentenced his own son to death for murder.<br>
<br>From July 1852 to March 1854 Farren managed the Theatre Royal, Brighton, where he undertook leading roles of all kinds, including Shakespeare's tragic heroes. His most popular offerings were extravaganzas featuring Louisa Howard, an actress so frequently paired with him that she was sometimes mistaken for his wife. The Brighton management was a financial failure. On 4 March 1854 Farren fled from the theatre, barely escaping arrest for debt, and went to London, leaving his wife in Brighton. After a brief acting engagement at Sadler's Wells he sailed for New York&#151;again without Mrs Farren. At the Broadway Theatre, he and Louisa Howard starred in the first few performances of the new season (21&#150;6 August), beginning with Claude and Pauline in Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span>, but they caused little excitement. In December 1854 they acted briefly at the St Charles Theatre in New Orleans, then twice at Field's Theatre in Mobile. Later Farren was a member of Ben DeBar's company, which acted alternately at New Orleans and St Louis. On 23 November 1857, while in New Orleans, he bigamously married the popular young actress Catherine Mary (Kate) Reignolds (1836&#150;1911), who believed erroneously that his first wife was dead. In 1858 he became manager of the St Louis Theatre, though he spent the summer seasons at Dubuque, Iowa. On 8 January 1860 he died of diabetes at St Louis, Missouri, and, after a funeral at the theatre, was buried in Belfontaine cemetery. He left his second wife (later Mrs Erving Winslow) with an infant, but nothing further is known about this child. His bigamy was little known in his lifetime.<br>
<br>Farren was a competent, versatile actor but never an outstanding one; in his more ambitious roles he was judged acceptable rather than distinguished. Perhaps his best acting was in his father's line of &#145;old men&#146;. The <span class="italic">Brighton Herald</span>, which praised his Sir Peter Teazle, suggested that he specialize in such parts, but he seemed unwilling to cultivate them at the expense of romantic and heroic ones. He was only thirty-two when he died, however. With more mature judgement, he might have limited his range and refined his apparent talent for character acting.<br>
