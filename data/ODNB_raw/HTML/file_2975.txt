<span class="headword">Boucher <span class="st"> [Bouchier]</span>,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1643), <span class="occ">royalist conspirator</span>, was probably related&#151;perhaps as a son&#151;to Nathaniel Boucher, a Bristol merchant who was warden (1621) and treasurer (1625) of the Bristol Society of Merchant Venturers, and sheriff of the city in 1624. Little is known of Boucher's family except that he left a wife, who died early in the Restoration, and seven children, of whom the eldest was a son, John; a younger son was named George. Boucher was probably the George Butcher listed as a member of the Merchant Venturers in 1618, who in 1626 was a collector for the company's project to send a ship in search of the north-west passage. He does not appear as a high official of the company. In 1640 or 1641 he was the first of several men sent to Westminster to complain that the actions resulting from the award of the customs farm to the London Vintners' Company had ruined large numbers of Bristol vintners. He was clearly a man of wealth and influence, who allegedly lost &pound;2000 in the plot which cost him his life.<br>
<br>The civic leaders of Bristol were unwilling to take sides in the civil war, but this was at first expressed chiefly in efforts to deflect and delay the admission of parliamentarian forces, who lay closer to the city than their opponents. During the subsequent occupation the behaviour of the parliamentarian commander, Colonel Essex, gave much ground for complaint and, despite his removal and the installation as governor of Nathaniel Fiennes, there was considerable sentiment in Bristol for an approach to the king's forces. The first steps in organizing the attempt were apparently taken before the end of 1642. The chief actors were Richard Yeamans or Yeomans and George Boucher, &#145;men of good esteem, plentiful estates, known integrity, and true children of the church of England&#146;  (Towgood, 21). Boucher's chief role, as he later affirmed, was initially in the political selection and recruitment of the foot-soldiers of the conspiracy in Bristol itself. First he framed an oath which expressed loyalty to the king &#145;in these words: I do voluntarily protest before Almighty God that I will to the utmost of my power and with my life and fortunes defend and maintain the rights and privileges of my dread sovereign Lord King Charles&#146;  (Walker, 6). He himself took this oath on 3 March 1643 and set about administering it to others, providing them also with arms and ammunition. But Boucher's organizational role on the night of 7 March was equally crucial. His house in Christmas Street lay next to St John's Bridge, and backed onto the River Froome. It was selected as one of four rallying points for the plotters, not least because all depended on the first step in their plan, the opening of the Froome gate to admit Prince Rupert and his troops. Boucher's men were to seize the guards stationed at the gate and imprison them in a crypt underneath the adjoining church of St John's. He had also arranged &#145;to give Prince Rupert a signal when he should make his approaches to the city, by ringing Saint John's and Saint Michael's bells&#146; and had organized locks and chains to bar the movement of any parliamentarian horse, should these appear  (Towgood, 15).<br>
<br>The conspiracy, however, was betrayed at the last moment. Alerted to the danger, and expecting the arrival of Rupert under cover of darkness, Captain Thomas Goodier commanded that lanterns be lit by those living close to the Froome gate. His soldiers, proceeding along Christmas Street enforcing the order, found Boucher's residence &#145;without light&#146; and silent, &#145;as if there were no person at all in the house&#146;, so they set about breaking down the door. Sixty men were crammed inside. Of these, most &#145;ran out at a water gate on the backside of the house, and went away through the water, it being a low tide, and made an escape&#146;  (Walker, 12). The soldiers arrested the twenty-three remaining, and impounded muskets and ammunition.<br>
<br>Four conspirators were singled out as chief organizers. George Boucher was examined at least three times, signing statements on 10 March, 27 April, and 3 May. These amounted to a frank admission of guilt, and the accusers had ample supporting evidence against Boucher and others. Two principals, Edward Dacres and Robert Yeamans's brother William, were pardoned, and parliamentarian officers of the garrison who had been privy to the conspiracy were not prosecuted, but on 8 and 22 May respectively Richard Yeamans and George Boucher were condemned to death by hanging.<br>
<br>In Oxford there was outrage at the death sentences. Patrick Ruthven, earl of Forth, lord general of the king's forces, threatened to execute parliamentarian prisoners taken at Cirencester, but Fiennes responded on 18 May that the four Bristolians had been taken not as soldiers in open warfare but in a conspiracy, and warned of retaliation against royalist prisoners in London if Ruthven did as he had promised. In the circumstances, Fiennes was careful to secure approval at the highest level before carrying out the sentences. On 22 May 1643 the Commons ordered that the earl of Essex, commander-in-chief of the army, should instruct the governor of Bristol to proceed. On 29 May the king himself ordered the mayor and aldermen to prevent the executions by all means. Even had this appeal arrived in time, the civic authorities would have had no means of obeying&#151;and it did not. On the following day Yeamans and Boucher were taken to the scaffold, which had been set up close to Yeamans's house in Wine Street. Fiennes arranged that the city gates be closed and deployed troops to prevent possible disturbances. Yeamans and Boucher had requested that two city divines, Richard Towgood of St Nicholas and Richard Standfast of Christ Church, should preach at the service which would precede their execution. These men were both outspoken supporters of the royalist cause and the request was refused; the three replacements included Walter Cradock, a prominent Independent recently arrived in Bristol.<br>
<br>Yeomans was executed first without incident but Boucher, a devout man even on the testimony of his enemies, was enraged at the choice of preachers. When the time came for his last words, he launched into a bitter speech against &#145;those beggarly and schismatical rudiments which crafty and malicious men had invented and introduced into the church of God in these last and worst times of the world &hellip; Proud (says he) they are, boasters, heady, unstable&#146;, continuing in this vein at some length. This appears not to have been well received by one of the ministers, at least, for:<blockquote>Rosewell, a levite of their own, and a cract brained separatist, interrupts him in the midst of his devotions, reviles him, and calls him a hypocrite and apostate, that after so strict a conversation, so much time spent in the profession of religion, he should render all suspected for hypocrisie. (Towgood, 25)</blockquote>George Boucher met his death bravely. The same evening his body was conveyed first to his own house, &#145;a sad spectacle to his poor widow and seven orphans&#146;, and then to be buried at the church of St Werburgh  (Towgood, 26&#150;7). His eldest son, John, was banished the kingdom. Charles I granted George's widow a pension of &pound;100 per annum, but she did not receive it until the Restoration, when &#145;she lived but one year to enjoy it&#146;, as her younger son George reported when seeking financial relief from the crown in May 1678.<br>
