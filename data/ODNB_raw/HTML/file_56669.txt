<span class="headword">Bosanquet,  Bernard James Tindal</span>  (1877&#150;1936), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, born at home at Bulls Cross, Enfield, Middlesex, on 13 October 1877, was the eldest son in the family of two sons and three daughters of Bernard Tindal Bosanquet (1843&#150;1910) and his wife, Eva Maude Cotton (<i>d</i>. 1912), and was grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2928/', "James Whatman Bosanquet")</script>. His father, who was of Huguenot descent, belonged to the banking firm Bosanquet &amp; Co., which was sold to Lloyds Bank in 1884, and then became a partner in Culverwell, Brooks &amp; Co., hide, leather, and fur brokers in the City of London; he was high sheriff of Middlesex (1897&#150;8), honorary lieutenant-colonel in the rifle brigade, and captain of Enfield cricket club. Bernard, the son, attended Sunnymede School, Slough, before going on to Eton College (1891&#150;6), where he scored a century against Harrow at Lord's, and then Oriel College, Oxford (1897&#150;1900), which he left without taking a degree. He had a distinguished sporting career at the university, winning blues for cricket (1898, 1899, and 1900), and half-blues for hammer-throwing (1899, 1900) and billiards (1898, 1900), as well as being an accomplished ice hockey player.<br>
<br>Bosanquet is remembered as the bowler who invented the &#145;googly&#146;, an off-break delivered with a leg-break action from the back of the hand. He had begun, when at Oxford, to pitch a tennis ball on a table so that, with the same action or delivery, he could make it break in one direction, then another. By 1899 he had progressed to a cricket ball. &#145;I had become a &#147;star turn&#148; for the luncheon interval during our matches at Oxford. The most famous batsman from the opposing side was enticed into a net&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wisden</span>, 1925, 226), Bosanquet bowled two or three leg-breaks to him, and then, with the same action but altering the axis of the spin, deceived him with an off-break. He recorded his first success when, playing for Middlesex at Lord's in 1900, he had the Leicestershire batsman S. Coe stumped on 98, albeit with a delivery which bounced four times before reaching the wicket-keeper. It was at first regarded as something of a joke, and <span class="italic">Wisden</span> (1901, 129) chose to give him credit instead for his two centuries in the match. The development in this technique, however, marked a revolution in bowling, and transformed Bosanquet from a fairly ordinary medium-pacer into a spinner capable of baffling the most assured batsman with his flight and break.<br>
<br>Between 1898 and 1919 Bosanquet, who had a business career, played 123 matches as an amateur for Middlesex and represented England on six occasions. He took a total of 629 wickets at an average of 23.8 runs per wicket. In his best season, 1904, he captured 132 wickets. He went on six overseas tours but played representative matches only on MCC's 1903&#150;4 tour to Australia, when, in the fourth test at Sydney, his six for 51 in the second innings enabled England to win back the &#145;Ashes&#146;. His best performance was eight for 107 against Australia at Nottingham in 1905. After 1905, when he was one of the <span class="italic">Wisden</span> cricketers of the year, his bowling declined, though his batting improved remarkably. Standing 6 feet tall, he was a fine hard-hitting batsman who in 1908 topped the first-class averages with 1018 runs (average 54.05).<br>
<br>As a bowler, Bosanquet remained something of an enigma. A friend once reflected, &#145;I know old Bose invented the Googly and that sort of thing, but did he ever get any wickets?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wisden</span>, 1925, 228). His length was notoriously wayward and even his mentor, Sir Pelham Warner, said he bowled more bad balls than any bowler he knew. Yet on his day he was a match-winner, and the long line of googly bowlers who succeeded him (notably the 1907 South African side) was testimony to his achievement. Abdul Qadir of Pakistan was the most notable exponent of the technique in the 1980s, and Shane Warne of Australia in the 1990s.<br>
<br>During the First World War Bosanquet was a temporary lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps. A convivial and good-natured man, he married, on 5 April 1924, Mary Janet (<i>b</i>. 1897/8), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46376/', "(William) Kennedy Jones")</script>, MP for Hornsey and joint founder of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>. After his father's death in 1910 Bosanquet sold the family seat, Claysmore, Enfield, Middlesex, and settled at Wykehurst Farm, Coneyhurst Lane, Ewhurst, Surrey, where he died on 12 October 1936. He was buried three days later in the Lavender Hill cemetery, Enfield. His wife survived him along with their only child, Reginald Tindal Kennedy Bosanquet (1932&#150;1984), who became a well-known television newsreader and was rector of the University of Glasgow from 1980 to 1983.<br>
