</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Myers,  Frederic William Henry</span>  (1843&#150;1901), <span class="occ">psychical researcher and essayist</span>, was born on 6 February 1843 at St John's parsonage, Keswick, Cumberland, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19688/', "Frederic Myers (1811&#150;1851)")</script>, perpetual curate of St John's, and his second wife, Susan Harriet Marshall (1811&#150;1896). The mathematician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19689/', "Thomas Myers")</script> was his grandfather, and the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35176/', "Ernest James Myers")</script> a younger brother.<h2>
<a name="Theclassicalscholar"></a>The classical scholar</h2>On his father's death Myers's mother moved with her three sons to Blackheath, Kent, where Frederic attended a preparatory school. Mrs Myers was a daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37739/', "John Marshall (1765&#150;1845)")</script>, owner of large estates in the Lake District, whose considerable fortune came from his Leeds flax mills. Money was not a serious problem, and in 1856 she took a substantial house in Cheltenham, sending her sons as day boys to Cheltenham College. There Myers's love of poetry and taste for classical literature were recognized and fostered. An early admiration for Virgil (instilled by his father) was followed by enthusiasms for other Greek and Latin authors. The reading of Plato's <span class="italic">Phaedo</span> at the age of sixteen occasioned a kind of religious conversion, which profoundly influenced his later thought. Before he left school he had learned the whole of Virgil by heart. These early enthusiasms were matched by a remarkable precocity in the use of language. At fourteen two of his poems were placed first and second for the college's English verse prize (the subject was &#145;Belisarius&#146;), and in the same year he won the prize for a Latin lyric. In 1859 he came second in a national competition for a Robert Burns centenary poem. At the end of that year he left school to study privately, but in 1860 won the English verse prize (for which he was still eligible) with a striking poem on &#145;The Death of Socrates&#146;.<br>
<br>That October, Myers went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, as a minor scholar. His university career was outstandingly successful. He won two university classical scholarships (the Bell and the Craven), the chancellor's medal for English verse twice, the Camden medal for Latin verse once, and the members' prize for a Latin essay three times. In 1864 he was second in the first classes of both the classical and the moral sciences triposes. Despite these achievements, Myers was not popular. Many thought him an eccentric and a poseur. The fervent and emotionally intense Hellenism which consumed him might easily have seemed like an affectation, but it was not. Thirty years later (in an autobiography only published in 1961) he wrote: &#145;That tone of thought came to me naturally; the classics were but intensifications of my own being&#146;  (Myers, 10). However, he added: &#145;They drew from me and fostered evil as well as good; they might aid imaginative impulse and detachment from sordid interests, but they had no check for lust or pride&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>It was more than anything overweening conceit which led Myers into a piece of folly that seriously damaged his reputation. He had won the Camden medal for Latin verse in 1862. Into his entry for the following year he packed (mostly without acknowledgement) a considerable number of what he considered the best lines from past Oxford prize poems. He was following what he believed to have been Virgil's practice, and to his friends would disdainfully quote Virgil's remark <i>Aurum colligo e stercore Ennii</i> (&#145;I am collecting gold from Ennius's dunghill&#146;). He was awarded the prize, but when the borrowings were discovered was forced to resign it.<br>
<br>The outward events of Myers's life over the next few years are easily told. He took his BA in 1864 and his MA in 1867, was a fellow of Trinity from 1865 until 1874, and a college lecturer in classics from 1865 to 1869. Feeling himself unsuited for teaching, he resigned his lectureship to work on behalf of the movement for the higher education of women. In 1872 he became an inspector of schools, an occupation which he followed until not long before his death without much impeding his other activities, and in 1875 was appointed to the Cambridge district.<br>
<br>The inward events were more interesting and a great deal more complex. A tour in the summer of 1864 of classical sites in Italy, Greece and Asia Minor had somewhat cooled Myers's Hellenic ardour by showing him how unattainable was that vanished ideal world. A tour of Canada and the United States the following summer found him for the first and last time in a state of religious apathy which was brought home to him when, about to swim the river below Niagara Falls, he asked himself, &#145;What if I die?&#146; and found the answer void of emotion. To a man of Myers's eager temperament sustained indifference was not possible. Christianity had for many years been displaced in his mind by Platonism, but now he was converted to Christianity by Mrs Josephine Butler, wife of the vice-principal of Cheltenham College, a lady for whom niceties of dogma were subordinate to the lived experience of Christian verities. Under her influence Myers for several years passed much of his life in prayer, self-discipline, and inner rapture. His best-known poem, &#145;St Paul&#146; (1867), which was dedicated to Mrs Butler, reflects the feelings of this period.<h2>
<a name="Movingtowardsspiritualism"></a>Moving towards spiritualism</h2>By 1869 disillusion had set in. It came, Myers said, &#145;from increased knowledge of history and science, from a wider outlook on the world &hellip; insensibly the celestial vision faded&#146;  (Myers, 13). The years of religious doubt that followed were exceedingly painful. Though for a while he moved much in the society of Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) and other earnest disbelievers, he could derive no satisfaction from their attempts to find meaning in a life bereft of God and the prospect of immortality.<br>
<br>Myers now turned, with the collaboration and cautious encouragement of his Trinity colleague and mentor, Henry Sidgwick, to an investigation of spiritualistic and kindred phenomena, which were then attracting a fair amount of interest. Between 1873 and 1878 Myers, Sidgwick, and a group of Trinity fellows and friends, including Edmund Gurney, Walter Leaf, Lord Rayleigh, and Arthur Balfour, together with Balfour's sisters, Eleanor (who was to marry Henry Sidgwick) and Evelyn (Lady Rayleigh), sat in various permutations and combinations with a good many mediums. Most proved in the end disappointing but Myers felt that he had witnessed occasional phenomena which justified continued hope that such investigations might eventually open an escape route from the prison of materialism.<br>
<br>These investigations coincided with other events which were to have a profound influence on the rest of Myers's life. His first cousin, Walter James Marshall, had married in 1866 Annie Eliza Hill, but Walter's increasingly frequent manic-depressive episodes and eccentric behaviour put great strains on the marriage. Myers and Annie were often in each other's company, partly because of family attempts to cope with the problem of Walter, and from about 1873 a deep, though unconsummated, affection developed between them. In May 1876 Walter was certified insane and taken to a private asylum at Ticehurst in Sussex where he was (wrongly) pronounced incurable  (Beer, chap. 4). His anger and recriminations distressed Annie and, overwhelmed by these and other problems, she drowned herself in Ullswater on 29 August 1876. Myers, who had gone abroad, was devastated. Annie had shared his religious doubts and his interest in spiritualism and was already associated in his mind with his quest for evidence of survival of death; proof of her survival now became a principal object of that quest.<br>
<br>In the years following 1876 Myers threw himself into literary work, publishing (mostly in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span> and the <span class="italic">Nineteenth Century</span>) the essays later collected as <span class="italic">Essays Modern</span> (1883) and <span class="italic">Essays Classical</span> (1883). In several of these essays are passages&#151;most notably the end of his essay on Ernest Renan, and the section on the neoplatonists in the essay on Greek Oracles&#151;which foreshadow much of his subsequent thought. To this period also belong a further volume of poems, <span class="italic">The Renewal of Youth</span> (1882), and &#145;Wordsworth&#146; (1880), a brief sketch for the <span class="roman">English Men of Letters</span> series. The latter was frequently reprinted&#151;Myers's love for and intimate knowledge of the Lake District, together with his own poetic gifts and strong sense of a spiritual reality behind and interpenetrating the sensible world, fitted him particularly well to be a biographer and interpreter of Wordsworth.<br>
<br>On 13 March 1880, after a whirlwind courtship, Myers married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55520/', "Eveleen Tennant (1856&#150;1937)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101196/', "Tennant, Gertrude Barbara Rich")</script>], the youngest daughter of Charles Tennant, of Cadoxton Lodge, Neath, Glamorgan. In most ways they were exceedingly different. Eveleen's interests were social and artistic&#151;she was a gifted photographer&#151;and not in the least intellectual, still less other-worldly. The bond between them was emotional and passionate. Eveleen was a devoted if somewhat possessive wife and mother&#151;they had three children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35178/', "Leopold Hamilton Myers (1881&#150;1944)")</script>, Silvia (<i>b</i>. 1883) and Harold (<i>b</i>. 1886)&#151;and the marriage was on the whole happy, despite the fact that Myers's inmost affections remained secretly fixed on the idealized Annie Marshall.<br>
<br>Myers and his wife both came from wealthy families (at his death his estate was valued at &pound;37,370) and they were able to enjoy a settled and comfortable lifestyle. In 1881 he built as their home the substantial Leckhampton House, set in 4 acres of grounds just to the west of Grange Road, Cambridge. From then on his outward life&#151;the activities for which the world at large most particularly knew him&#151;and his inward life came together more fully than they had previously done. The result was twenty years of sustained endeavour and impressive productivity.<h2>
<a name="TheSocietyforPsychicalResearch"></a>The Society for Psychical Research</h2>Early in 1882 Myers joined Sir William Barrett, the physicist, certain prominent spiritualists, notably E. Dawson Rogers and W. Stainton Moses, his own Trinity friends, Henry Sidgwick and Edmund Gurney, and various others, in setting up the Society for Psychical Research (the SPR). The aim of this society was to investigate psychic phenomena in a scientific spirit and without presuppositions as to outcome or explanations. Sidgwick became its first president and, more than anyone, set its tone, but it was above all Myers whose enthusiasm drove it on. His own motivation was of course broadly religious, but it would be unjust to accuse him of wholesale credulity. His experience of spiritualistic frauds was considerable, and his tendency towards belief was restrained by his sense that momentous issues were at stake. His contribution to the SPR and to psychical research in general was fourfold. He was centrally involved in organizing the society and in promoting its image, which he did by recruiting distinguished members, speaking at international psychological conferences and placing informative articles in leading reviews. He devoted a great deal of time and energy to the investigation of cases of apparitions (he was co-author with Edmund Gurney and Frank Podmore of the monumental <span class="italic">Phantasms of the Living</span>, 2 vols., 1886) and of automatic writing, trance mediumship, and so forth, and travelled widely in Britain and abroad to obtain first-hand testimony and sit with mediums. (Sittings with the American trance medium Mrs Leonora Piper and with the English Mrs Rosina Thompson eventually convinced him that he had made contact with Annie Marshall.) He used his classical learning to coin a specialist vocabulary for psychical research, the term &#145;telepathy&#146; being one of his inventions. And he developed a theory to unite the findings of psychical research with the latest discoveries in psychopathology, abnormal psychology, and hypnotism.<br>
<br>The reading with which he supported this theory was prodigious. He probably knew more than any man in England (except perhaps his own youngest brother and close collaborator, the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40751/', "Arthur Thomas Myers (1851&#150;1894)")</script>) about current continental work on hypnosis, dissociation, and secondary personality, and had met many of the leading French authorities. He was the first to describe in English the early work of Pierre Janet and Freud. The development of his theory of the subliminal self can be traced through numerous lengthy articles in the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the SPR, and a more popular book, <span class="italic">Science and a Future Life</span> (1893), to its fullest, though still incomplete, expression in his posthumous <span class="italic">Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death</span> (2 vols., 1903). Myers regards each human personality as consisting of a number of distinct streams of consciousness, which he sometimes compares to geological strata. These are in some sense modifications of the same soul, and have the potential for unification. But normally they remain separate, and one, the ordinary &#145;supraliminal&#146; stream of consciousness, has evolved to cope with the problems of everyday living. Others, however, may possess faculties, for instance telepathy, of less immediate practical relevance. Waking telepathic experiences may be regarded as leaks or messages from these &#145;subliminal&#146; streams of consciousness, and telepathy is most likely to occur when such streams are tapped, as in dreams or hypnosis, or become to an extent detached and autonomous, as in automatic writing or secondary personality. This theory had for a while great influence within psychical research, and some outside it. Whether it could be made credible or even wholly coherent might be doubted. None the less <span class="italic">Human Personality</span>&#151;despite the rhapsodical style in which some passages are written&#151;remains an impressive attempt to systematize a vast quantity of interesting materials.<h2>
<a name="Characterandappearance"></a>Character and appearance</h2>As a person the later Myers was admired by many but also disliked by not a few. The self-conceit of his earlier days had been replaced by a chastened insight into his own shortcomings, and the snobbery and excessive respect for titles, which had irritated his American friend, William James, was substantially moderated. But lingering memories of the Camden medal affair, together with his unconventional religious views, made some doubt his sincerity, a doubt not allayed by the sonorous fluency with which he would talk or lecture on his favourite themes. His prose was liable to similar excesses; they represented, however, not insincerity but a brief lifting of the curtain on his intense inner life. A sentence from the manuscript of his autobiography runs: &#145;I cannot feel that I am entirely candid unless I write in this emotional, over-decorated style which corresponds in some subtle way to the idiosyncrasy of the soul within.&#146; His ordinary bearing was serene and reserved, and he had great social gifts; he had, however, few close friends, and these&#151;Edmund Gurney, Henry Sidgwick and his wife, Oliver Lodge, the French physiologist Charles Richet, William James&#151;were mostly individuals whom he thought of as fellow workers in the great endeavour.<br>
<br>Myers was about 5 feet 10 inches in height, tending somewhat to stoutness, with brown eyes, dark hair, later thinning and becoming grizzled, and a short beard. According to members of his family he was almost tone deaf and had little appreciation of music, a failing which is perhaps reflected in his poetry. In 1898, 1899, and 1900 Myers had severe attacks of influenza. He developed Bright's disease, with enlargement of the heart. Towards the end of 1900 he went abroad for his health. He died of pneumonia in a clinic in Rome on 17 January 1901. A memorial tablet was erected in the city's protestant cemetery. Myers was buried in the graveyard of St John's Church, Keswick, between his father's (more substantial) grave and a gateway into the garden of the house where he was born. He was survived by his wife.<br>
