<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Robert</span>  (1795&#150;1868), <span class="occ">Congregational minister</span>, of Welsh descent, was born in Bristol on 14 October 1795. His parents belonged to the established church. He had no early advantages of education, but showed a taste for historical reading, one of his first purchases being a copy of Sir Walter Ralegh's <span class="italic">History of the World</span>. He came under the influence of William Thorp (1771&#150;1833), Independent minister at Castle Green, Bristol, who trained him for the ministry and from whom he took his early, over-demonstrative style of preaching.<br>
<br>While still a student Vaughan was invited to serve Angel Street Congregational Church, Worcester, and was ordained on 4 July 1819; among his ordainers were William Jay and John Angell James. He married in 1822 Susanna Ryall of Melcombe Regis, Dorset. They had several children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28143/', "Robert Alfred Vaughan")</script> was the eldest son; the eldest daughter married Dr Carl Buch, principal of Government College at Bareilly, upper India, who was murdered in 1857 at the outbreak of the Indian mutiny. In March 1825 Vaughan accepted a call to Hornton Street, Kensington, in succession to John Leifchild.<br>
<br>Through the publication of his <span class="italic">Life and Opinions of John de Wycliffe</span> (1828) and <span class="italic">Memorials of the Stuart Dynasty</span> (1831) Vaughan gained some reputation as a historical writer. In 1833 he was appointed to the chair of history in University College, London, and he published his introductory lecture, <span class="italic">On the Study of General History</span>, in 1834. In the same year he delivered the Congregational lecture, a series of disquisitions published as <span class="italic">Causes of the Corruption of Christianity</span> (1834). His connection with University College brought him into contact with whig leaders, and increased his influence as a preacher; people of social position, including Harriet, duchess of Sutherland, were drawn to his services. In 1836 he received a DD from Glasgow University. He continued his historical research, and published the <span class="italic">Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell</span> (2 vols., 1838) and <span class="italic">The History of England under the House of Stuart</span> (1840).<br>
<br>In 1843 Vaughan succeeded Gilbert Wardlaw as president and professor of theology at the Lancashire Independent college, which moved on 26 April to new buildings at Whalley Range, Manchester. He published his inaugural discourse, <span class="italic">Protestant Nonconformity</span>, in 1843. He was dissatisfied with the tone of the <span class="italic">Eclectic Review</span>, which, under the editorship of Thomas Price, was favouring the militant policy of Edward Miall. Vaughan was opposed to radical political dissent. Only during his last year did he embrace the principles of the Liberation Society. He was also opposed to the voluntary principle in education. To present his own views he launched the <span class="italic">British Quarterly Review</span>, bringing out the first number in January 1845. During the twenty years of his editorship he kept it at a high intellectual level and, while retaining its nonconformist character and its theological conservatism, admitted on other topics a wide range of writers of different schools. Some of his own articles were collected in <span class="italic">Essays on History, Philosophy, and Theology</span> (2 vols., 1849). The <span class="italic">British Quarterly Review</span> was his most influential contribution to the hold that Congregationalism was to achieve in the great centres of population by 1870. Such an outcome coincided with the view that he had expressed in his book <span class="italic">The Age of Great Cities</span> (1843) that Congregationalism was the authentic religion of urban industrial society. In 1846 Vaughan occupied the chair of the Congregational Union. Returning to the subject of his first publication, he edited for the Wycliffe Society <span class="italic">Tracts and Treatises of John de Wycliffe &hellip; with &hellip; Memoir</span> (1845), and published <span class="italic">John de Wycliffe, DD: a Monograph</span> (1853).<br>
<br>Vaughan was not entirely fitted to be a successful president of the Lancashire Independent college. He had no competence in dogmatic theology and his manner towards students was reserved and undemonstrative. He resigned his post on 20 July 1857, in great perturbation of mind, in the wake of the bitter controversy over the endorsement of the principles of higher criticism by his colleague Dr Samuel Davidson. Although Vaughan voted against Davidson in the college committee, he did not initiate the action. He was succeeded by Henry Rogers (1806&#150;1877).<br>
<br>After ministering for a short time to a small congregation at Uxbridge, Vaughan retired to St John's Wood, and occupied himself with literary work, publishing <span class="italic">Revolutions in English History</span> (3 vols., 1859&#150;63) and taking his part in the nonconformist publications occasioned by the bicentenary of the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of 1662. It was a speech by Vaughan at the Congregational Union in autumn 1861 that was the main inspiration for the bicentenary commemoration of 1862. In 1867 Vaughan accepted a call to a newly formed congregation at Torquay. Scarcely had he moved there when he was seized with congestion of the brain followed by typhus. He died at Torquay on 15 June 1868, and was buried there.<br>
<br>Vaughan was a man of striking presence and great platform power, but otherwise he was not popular, and his ministerial career was not as successful as those of contemporaries such as William Jay, John Angell James, and Thomas Binney. However, beside the works specified above and single sermons and speeches, other books of his are significant, particularly because they provide provocative comments on contemporary religious life: <span class="italic">Thoughts on the &hellip; State of Religious Parties in England</span> (1838); <span class="italic">Congregationalism &hellip; in Relation to &hellip; Modern Society</span> (1842); <span class="italic">The Modern Pulpit</span> (1842); and <span class="italic">English Nonconformity</span> (1862).<br>
