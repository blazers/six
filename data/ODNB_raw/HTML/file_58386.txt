<span class="headword">Cox,  Joseph Mason</span>  (1763&#150;1818), <span class="occ">physician and asylum keeper</span>, was born on 31 August 1763 at Bristol, the son of John Cox (<i>d</i>. 1788), a grocer, and Elizabeth Mason. His maternal grandfather, Joseph Mason, was the proprietor of a madhouse at Fishponds, near Bristol. About 1778 Joseph Mason Cox was placed by his grandfather as apprentice to Ebenezer Ludlow, a surgeon&#150;apothecary of Sodbury. From November 1783 until August 1784 he was pupil to James Padmore Noble, surgeon to the Bristol Infirmary. He then pursued further medical studies in London, and subsequently at Edinburgh, Paris, and Leiden. Cox gained his MD at Leiden in June 1787. His early interest in the treatment of mental disorder was displayed in the subject of his thesis, <span class="italic">De mania</span>.<br>
<br>After Joseph Mason's death in 1779 the Fishponds madhouse was managed first by his daughters, Sarah and Elizabeth. When Sarah died in 1781, it passed to Elizabeth and John Cox. Following the death of his father, in June 1788, Joseph Mason Cox took over the house. He succeeded in consolidating Fishponds as one of the most successful of provincial private asylums. It catered for up to seventy patients, received mainly from the western counties. Cox married the wealthy Sarah Snooke of Bourton on the Water on 18 June 1795. They subsequently took up residence at Overn Hill House, Downend, Bristol. Cox later acquired other properties, including the manor of Patchway, near Bristol.<br>
<br>In addition to treatment at Fishponds, Cox also offered private consultations. His reputation as a mad-doctor was enhanced considerably by the publication of <span class="italic">Practical Observations on Insanity</span> in 1804, generally acknowledged as one of the period's most significant treatises on mental disorder. An enlarged second edition was published in 1806, and a third in 1813. There was also an American edition, as well as translations into French and German. Cox adhered to the established view that, given the correct treatment, most cases of insanity were curable in the early stages. Most of the methods he advocated in <span class="italic">Practical Observations</span> were similar to those of other contemporary practitioners, and included the use of emetic and purgative medicines, blisters, limited bleeding, and cold and warm baths. Purging he considered generally indispensable, as maniacs &#145;are frequently and most uniformly costive&#146;. Vomiting, he was convinced, &#145;takes the precedence of every other curative mean&#146;.<br>
<br>Although Cox argued that kindness and tenderness should be utilized wherever possible, he also accepted the need for coercive or drastic methods in certain cases. His celebrity largely rests on one particular treatment, known as the rotating chair or the circular swing chair, which he adapted from the work of Erasmus Darwin. The patient would be tightly strapped into a suspended chair, and rotated by a keeper turning a lever. The intensity of the treatment would vary according to the velocity, the duration, and whether the patient was in a vertical or prone position. The physical effects of swinging ranged from sleep, through vertigo, to evacuation and vomiting, which Cox considered particularly beneficial. There were also &#145;moral&#146; treatment benefits, arising from the discomfort and fear induced, which acted as a deterrent to the repetition of undesirable behaviours. The circular swing chair remained in vogue, in public and private lunatic asylums, until about 1830.<br>
<br>A contemporary wrote that Cox was &#145;a fair classical scholar, spoke French fluently, and was altogether an accomplished gentleman and a pleasant companion. He was passionately fond of music, and for many years belonged to a quartet party, of which Joe Sturge was the leader&#146;  (Smith, 166).<br>
<br>Cox's later years were marred by poor health. He gave up the management of Fishponds in 1817, passing it on to his nephew. He died at Downend on 11 July 1818, aged fifty-five, and was buried at Downend Baptist Church, Bristol. His wife, Sarah, survived until 1852. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> noted &#145;his amiable manners, the accomplishments of his mind, and the numerous Christian virtues which adorned his character through life and supported him in a long and painful illness&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 92).<br>
