<span class="headword">Abraham,  Roy Clive</span>  (1890&#150;1963), <span class="occ">scholar of African languages and colonial administrator</span>, was born on 16 December 1890 in Melbourne, Australia. From a Jewish background, he studied at University College, London, preparatory school, at Clifton College, Bristol, and also at various establishments in Germany. From 1923 to 1924 he was a Brassey scholar (in Italian) at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was awarded a first-class honours degree in oriental languages (Arabic and Persian); he was prepared to be examined in Ethiopic (his proficiency stemming from a study period at Leipzig University in 1920) but no examiner could be found. In 1927 Abraham took a certificate in anthropology from University College, London, and a diploma in (classical) Arabic from the School of Oriental Studies, University of London, in 1930.<br>
<br>During the First World War and its aftermath (1914&#150;23), Abraham saw British army service in Arabia and on the north-western frontier with the Indian army, where he acquired a working knowledge of Hindustani. His first experience of sub-Saharan Africa was in 1925, when he entered the administrative service of the northern provinces of Nigeria; he continued in the service until 1944, working initially as an administrative officer and (acting) government anthropological officer. His wife, Sadie, lived with him in Nigeria, and they had one son, Donald.<br>
<br>Sometimes difficult and temperamental, Abraham's relations with colleagues, then and later, often proved to be turbulent. Nevertheless, he was almost immediately seconded on a six-year language research project to Bauchi province in north-eastern Nigeria, and it was there, in 1926, that he conducted his first independent linguistic study of an African language, working on Bole (Bolanci), a west Chadic (Afro-Asian) language. He then assisted <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63452/', "G. P. Bargery")</script> in the compilation of the latter's monumental and authoritative <span class="italic">Hausa-English Dictionary</span> (1934). Abraham learned about the role of contrastive tone in west African languages from Bargery, and in his <span class="italic">Principles of Hausa</span> (1934) he simplified Bargery's six-tone system to the correct three-tone system for Hausa.<br>
<br>This was an especially productive period for Abraham, and he published yet more pedagogically-motivated works, including <span class="italic">The Grammar of Tiv</span> (1933) and <span class="italic">The Principles of Idoma</span> (1935), the first detailed linguistic description of an eastern Kwa language. Although the quality of his prolific output varied, and was sometimes abstruse, Abraham's grammars and dictionaries represented major descriptive and analytical contributions to the study of African languages. In 1941&#150;2, during the Second World War, he taught Hausa to soldiers in the Royal West African Frontier Force, after which he served in Ethiopia, teaching Amharic and Somali. Later in the war he was based in Kenya, South Africa, France, and Italy, and with the British military mission in Moscow, completing his military career with the rank of major.<br>
<br>In 1945 Abraham was awarded a Leverhulme research fellowship to research the Semitic languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea (including Amharic and Ge'ez). In 1946 he was frustrated in his attempt to succeed Bargery as lecturer in Hausa at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), London. His relationship with Bargery had become increasingly strained since their collaboration on Bargery's 1934 Hausa dictionary, and Abraham was of the opinion that Bargery had actively hindered his appointment. Relations were at such a low ebb that Abraham felt compelled to complain to the director of SOAS about Bargery's presence on the selection board, at the same time apologizing for his behaviour. Subsequently appointed to a new lectureship in Amharic, Abraham held the post from 1948 until he retired in 1951. During this same period he also taught Tigrinya and began research into Berber, Oromo, and Somali. In 1949 he was awarded the degree of DLitt by the University of Oxford on the basis of three of his published works on Tiv.<br>
<br>Further works by Abraham included his <span class="italic">Dictionary of the Hausa Language</span> (with Mai Kano), which was published in 1949; and in 1951 <span class="italic">The Principles of Somali</span> (with Solomon Warsama) appeared in mimeograph form. In 1952, Abraham embarked on a study of Yoruba, having made his own way to Ibadan, Nigeria. This led to his <span class="italic">Dictionary of Modern Yoruba</span> (1958). Beset by diabetes and ill health in the later stages of his life, Abraham's dogged determination and intellectual curiosity drove him to do further research on Igbo, and he was close to completing a dictionary and grammar when he died from a coronary thrombosis and stroke at his home, 11 West View, Hendon, on 22 June 1963 at the age of seventy-two. He was survived by his wife and son. A key figure in African language scholarship during the twentieth century, Abraham worked for over thirty years on a wide range of disparate languages in the Afro-Asian family, as well as in Niger-Congo. A commemorative volume in honour of his outstanding contribution to the understanding of African languages was published in 1992.<br>
