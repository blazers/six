<span class="headword">Sharples,  James</span>  (1825&#150;1893), <span class="occ">blacksmith and artist</span>, was born on 4 September 1825 in Wakefield, Yorkshire, one of the thirteen children of James Sharples (<i>c</i>.1793&#150;1855), blacksmith and wrought iron worker, and his wife, Margaret (<i>c</i>.1797&#150;1854). Both Sharples's grandfathers were blacksmiths, and Sharples himself entered the trade as a smithy boy, working in a foundry at the age of ten. He was later set to work in an engine shop where he heated and carried rivets for the boilermakers. It is said that he expressed his early aptitude for art by drawing boiler designs in chalk on his mother's kitchen floor, and it was with her support and that of an elder brother that he was encouraged to pursue his talent. At sixteen he attended weekly art classes at Bury Mechanics' Institute and he spent what little spare time he had outside the foundry in making copies of drawings, and in improving his reading so that he could better understand the principles of art.<br>
<br>Having made his own easel, palette, and canvas, Sharples taught himself oil painting from a shilling guide and after initial disappointments produced a copy of an engraving, <span class="italic">Sheep-Shearing</span>, which he sold for a half-crown. This gave him the confidence to attempt a more ambitious work and he began making sketches while working in the foundry, where he opted for the heavier kind of iron work, allowing him more time to draw while waiting for the metal to heat. He learned perspective from Brook Taylor's <span class="italic">Principles</span> and techniques for depicting the human form from Flaxman's <span class="italic">Anatomical Studies</span>.<br>
<br>The result of this endeavour was a large painting called <span class="italic">The Forge</span>, completed about 1849. The artistic merits of this painting, which was solid in its conception and execution, were less impressive than the trials that had been undergone to produce it, and Sharples was justly celebrated for his achievement. Samuel Smiles used him as one of the &#145;illustrations of character and conduct&#146; in <span class="italic">Self-Help</span> (1860) and the success of the picture encouraged Sharples to consider full-time painting. But, as Smiles noted, &#145;not obtaining sufficient employment at portraits to occupy his time, or give him the prospect of a steady income, he had the good sense to resume his leather apron, and go on working at his honest trade&#146;  (Smiles, 135). He painted one other large work, <span class="italic">The Smithy</span>, and in 1851 won a prize for an emblematical design offered by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, of which he was a member.<br>
<br>The suggestion that <span class="italic">The Forge</span> would make an admirable reproduction prompted Sharples next to learn the art of steel-engraving, and in 1859, after many years of Labour, he completed a work that was as remarkable in its way as the original. The quality of his etching, part line engraving and part mezzotint, was noted in the London art journals and copies were widely sold. But a combination of bad luck and na&iuml;vety deprived Sharples of most of the profit from this venture and to the end he was reliant upon the foundry for an income.<br>
<br>Sharples married on 7 April 1852 Sarah Moore (1832&#150;1861), with whom he had one son and a daughter, who died in infancy; after his first wife's death he married Sarah Ford on 20 June 1863, with whom he also had a son and a daughter. Sharples died in Blackburn, where he had settled, on 13 June 1893 and was buried at the town's cemetery four days later. Of <span class="italic">The Forge</span>, which defined him as an artist and as a man, and serves as his epitaph, Sharples wrote: &#145;The picture simply represents the interior of a large workshop such as I have been accustomed to work in&#146;  (Smiles, 227).<br>
