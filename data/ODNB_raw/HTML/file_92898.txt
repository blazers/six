<span class="headword">Berk <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Heymansohn]</span>,  Lieselotte <span class="st"> [Lotte]</span></span>  (1913&#150;2003), <span class="occ">dancer and fitness trainer</span>, was born on 17 January 1913 in Cologne, Germany, the only daughter of Jewish parents. Her Russian father, Nicolai Heymansohn, was originally a tailor and owned shops selling clothing for men. Her German mother died of a stroke when Lotte was eight years old. She led a life of privilege as a young woman; she was chauffeured around in her father's Mercedes and wore expensive clothes. Her father wanted her to study the piano, which she did for eleven years; however her true love was dancing. Despite her father's opposition, as dancing in Germany in the 1930s had close associations with prostitution, she trained under the seminal modern dance artist Mary Wigman in Cologne. As young as eighteen she danced for some of the more famous choreographers and conductors, including Carl Ebert, Bruno Walter, and Fritz Busch, at many events including the Salzburg Festival in Austria. In 1933 she married Ernst Berk, a fellow dancer. Their daughter Esther was born in 1934. As a Jew in Nazi Germany she was prevented from performing; when the situation in Germany became much more precarious she and Ernst fled to Britain in 1938 on Ernst's British passport (he had been born in Germany of British parents). Her father and his second wife died in Auschwitz. Upon their arrival in London, Lotte and Ernst lived in a shared house for Jewish refugees. Berk continued to dance and also worked as a model at Heatherley's School of Fine Art. The family finally settled in Shepherd's Bush in 1941 and Berk danced with the ballet instructor Marie Rambert's company. During the Second World War she toured the UK with the Entertainments National Service Association, performing for the troops, and had small feature roles.<br>
<br>In 1953 Berk decided to retire from dancing, partly because she felt that a female dancer's career should end before middle age and also because her type of modern dance was not appealing to London audiences. However, she became concerned with her weight and the prospect of her dancer's muscles turning to flab without constant workouts. Friends persuaded her to start an exercise class based on a combination of modern ballet, yoga, and what she called &#145;orthopaedic exercises&#146;. With the help of an osteopath, who assisted her with designing certain exercises, she opened her studio at 29 Manchester Street in the West End of London, near the theatre district. When an accident locked her lumbar spine X-rays suggested that she would be crippled for life, but through constant exercise she was better within fourteen days. Her methods proved very popular, at first with friends and then with London's socialites. It was said that in the 1960s Vidal Sassoon was responsible for looking after London socialites' hair, Mary Quant their clothes, and Lotte Berk their figures. The numbers of women attending Berk's classes increased and she eventually counted several internationally famous clients, including Joan Collins, Britt Ekland, Edna O'Brien, Brooke Shields, and Yasmin Le Bon. The exercise regime consisted of barre and floor work and stretching and loosening the spine, all of which took advantage of Berk's lifetime dance training. Classes were for women only and were conducted to pop music. Exercises included muscle toning exercises, pelvic tilts, and tiny but demanding muscle movements. They were creatively named by the mischievous Berk with descriptions such as &#145;the prostitute&#146; and &#145;the peeing dog&#146;. Although considering herself fit through years of riding horses, Prue Leith admitted that her legs were &#145;reduced to jelly&#146; after twenty minutes of Lotte Berk's demanding regime  (Berk and Prince, introduction). In the introduction to her book <span class="italic">The Lotte Berk Method of Exercise</span> (1978) she wrote: &#145;There is no need for any young girl to have a shapeless body, for any mother to lose her figure after childbirth, or any mature woman to have an old and decrepit body.&#146; Berk's studios expanded in England to Fulham and Hungerford, where her daughter, Esther, also taught her exercise method. One student gained permission to teach the technique in the 1970s in New York and the Lotte Berk method became international. Others adapted the exercises and developed their own versions of the Berk method. Eventually the Lotte Berk method of exercise was practised in classes in New York, California, Zurich, and Rome. Despite the expansion and popularity of her exercise regime, Berk did not make a vast fortune from her career as an instructor. However, she did have a permanent and lasting impact on women's exercise regimes around the world.<br>
<br>Lotte Berk had an interesting and varied love life. In later life she said that she had been married seven times, but only twice on paper. She divorced her first husband, Ernst, after thirty years of an &#145;open marriage&#146; and then married the 61-year-old Herbert Felix Rieser, a commercial photographer (and son of Emanuel Rieser, soap manufacturer) on 31 January 1964. Although the marriage only lasted three weeks, they remained close friends. A staunch supporter of vegetarianism as a way of life, she felt that the &#145;barrage of chemicals&#146; that animals were fed slowly poisoned the body  (Berk and Prince, introduction). However, she still continued to eat the occasional steak. Berk continued to exercise throughout her life, retiring in her early eighties, although she still supervised some classes. She died at the Brendoncare Foundation, Froxfield, Wiltshire, on 4 November 2003, and was survived by her daughter, Esther.<br>
