<span class="headword">Rittenhouse,  David</span>  (1732&#150;1796), <span class="occ">instrument maker and astronomer</span>, was born on 8 April 1732 at Paper Mill Run, near Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the second of ten children of Elizabeth Williams and Matthias Rittenhouse (1702&#150;1779), a paper maker turned farmer. The elder Rittenhouse was of German Mennonite background, his wife of Welsh Quaker, but neither seems to have been strongly attached to either church; their son, who held deistical views, had a loose affiliation with the Presbyterians.<br>
<br>Although he was without formal education (he was educated at home), Rittenhouse displayed a precocious mechanical talent: aged eight he made a model of a watermill and at sixteen he constructed a wooden clock. After 1750 he devoted himself completely to making clocks and surveying and other instruments. He was encouraged in this career by a local clergyman, Thomas Barton, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, who procured him books from London and introduced him to Philadelphia men of science. In 1768 Rittenhouse proposed to the newly established American Philosophical Society that it should make observations of the forthcoming transit of Venus, to determine the sun's parallax and thus the distance of the earth from the sun. Rittenhouse's observations, made at his farm at Norriton, were part of an international scientific undertaking. The American's observations were, in the judgement of Nevil Maskelyne, the astronomer royal, &#145;excellent and compleat&#146; and did &#145;Honor to the Gentlemen who made them&#146;  (American Philosophical Society, <span class="italic">Transactions</span>, 1, 1771, 40).<br>
<br>In 1771 Rittenhouse constructed the instrument for which he was most famous. This was an orrery, a mechanical representation of the solar system, that could reproduce the positions of the sun and planets 5000 years forwards and backwards. The first orrery was purchased by the College of New Jersey, a second was made for the College of Philadelphia, and eventually a third was authorized as a gift to the king of France. The instrument was described in journals and newspapers, it was illustrated in almanacs, and was the subject of public lectures. During their occupation of Philadelphia in 1777&#150;8 the British army posted a special guard to protect it. Thomas Jefferson expressed a commonly held view of the marvellous creation and its inventor: &#145;He has not indeed made a world; but he has by imitation approached nearer its Maker than any man who had lived from the creation to this day&#146;  (Jefferson, <span class="italic">Notes</span>, 64).<br>
<br>In 1766 Rittenhouse married Eleanor Coulston (<i>d</i>. 1771), daughter of a Quaker farmer; they had two daughters. In 1772, the year after Eleanor's death, he married Hannah Jacobs (<i>d</i>. 1799), like his first wife a Quaker. In Philadelphia, where he settled in 1770, Rittenhouse continued to make clocks, surveying and astronomical instruments, and even a pair of eye-glasses for George Washington. He compiled ephemerides for almanacs, and wrote on a wide range of subjects: the transits of Venus and Mercury, comets, eclipses, meteors, lightning and electricity, mathematical subjects, the geology of western Pennsylvania, and the power of snakes to fascinate birds. He used spider webs for the cross-hairs of telescopes and wrote about the illusion of reversible relief. He made improvements in Franklin's Pennsylvania fireplace. His most important invention was a compass equipped with a vernier.<br>
<br>As a celebrated surveyor and astronomer, Rittenhouse was called on to assist in surveying the boundaries of Pennsylvania with Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey, and New York. A proposal to erect an observatory in Philadelphia, with Rittenhouse as public astronomer, died with the outbreak of the American war in 1775.<br>
<br>In 1768 Rittenhouse was elected to the American Philosophical Society, which he served in many capacities and in whose <span class="italic">Transactions</span> he published most of his papers. In an address to the society in 1775 he presented the history of astronomy, defended the science against the charge of being anti-religious, expressed opposition to slavery, and, voicing a common colonial attack upon European &#145;luxury&#146; and &#145;decadence&#146;, expressed the wish that a bar could be raised between the Old World and the New that would &#145;make a voyage to Europe as impracticable as one to the moon&#146;  (Barton, 568). He was elected president of the society in succession to Franklin in 1791, and made it a national centre for the encouragement of science and scientists.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of the American War of Independence Rittenhouse's life changed. In the next fifteen years he held a variety of public offices. As a member of the board of war he gave advice on the manufacture of arms and ammunition, and on the construction of defensive works on the Delaware River, and as state treasurer from 1777 to 1789 he had to cope with persistent problems of depreciated currency and of tax collection. He was chairman of the state convention that drafted a constitution that was more radical than that of any of the new states. Jefferson regretted these political activities: &#145;No body can conceive that nature ever intended to throw away a Newton upon the occupations of a crown&#146;  (Jefferson, <span class="italic">Papers</span>, 2.203).<br>
<br>As Rittenhouse's reputation grew he received several honorary degrees, and he was elected to learned societies in Boston and Virginia. In the reorganization of the College of Philadelphia in 1779 he was chosen vice-president and professor of astronomy. There was some hope that he would accept an appointment at the College of William and Mary in Virginia. But lecturing did not appeal to him and he remained in Philadelphia, content modestly to call himself, and to be known as, a &#145;mechanic&#146;. In 1787 Charles Dilly of London published <span class="italic">Philosophical Papers of David Rittenhouse</span>. In 1792 Rittenhouse was appointed director of the national mint, where he designed several instruments and machines required for its work. He resigned the post three years later for reasons of health&#151;possibly a duodenal ulcer. On 16 April 1795 he was elected a foreign fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>Americans often linked Rittenhouse with Washington and Franklin as an example of American character and talents. Conservative federalists, however, did not forgive his radical politics, criticism of the federal constitution, and support of the French Revolution. John Adams, while admitting that Rittenhouse was &#145;an exquisite Mechanician&#146;, branded him as &#145;a good, simple ignorant well meaning Franklinian Democrat, totally ignorant of the World, as an Anchorite, an honest Dupe of the French Revolution&#146;  (<span class="italic">Adams&#150;Jefferson Letters</span>, 2.426).<br>
<br>Rittenhouse died in his house, at 7th and Arch streets, Philadelphia, on 26 June 1796, and was buried next day in the floor of the private observatory he had erected in the garden. His body was subsequently removed to a Presbyterian burial-ground, and still later to Laurel Hill cemetery, Philadelphia. His personal property was appraised at &pound;8941 16<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. He was survived by his wife, Hannah, who deeded the observatory to the American Philosophical Society, and in 1799 bequeathed it $200 for its upkeep.<br>
