<span class="headword">Malcolm <span class="st"> [Malcolme]</span>,  David</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1748), <span class="occ">philologist</span>, was licensed as a preacher by the presbytery of Haddington on 11 January 1700 and was ordained on 28 March 1705 to the ministry of Duddingston, at the foot of Arthur's Seat, near Edinburgh. Nothing is known of his life before 1700. He married Susanna Anderson and at least four children of theirs were baptized at Duddingston between 1712 and 1721. Malcolm's celebration of the marriage of George Drummond to Catherine, daughter of Sir James Campbell of Aberuchill, caused him to be summoned before the presbytery on 10 November 1721 and rebuked at the bar for his conduct. <br>
<br>Though not a highlander, Malcolm devoted himself to the study of Gaelic and, according to the Scots antiquary Walter MacFarlan, acquired an amazing knowledge of the etymology of Scottish place names  (Gough, 487n.). In 1732 Malcolm proposed to augment, revise, and reprint the Irish&#150;English dictionary from Edward Lhuyd's <span class="italic">Archaeologia Britannica</span> (1707), adding writings of his own, intended to illustrate Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Chaldean from Gaelic, and <i>inter alia</i> to demonstrate an affinity between Gaelic and the language spoken by natives of the Darien isthmus in Central America. He had the backing of learned societies in Edinburgh and a publication grant of &pound;20 from the general assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1737, but his only traced publication is a hotchpotch of testimonials, correspondence with scholars and possible patrons, and translations and extracts from Lhuyd and others, under the collective title of <span class="italic">An Essay on the Antiquities of Great Britain and Ireland</span> (1738). With the addition of more testimonials and correspondence and letter A of the proposed dictionary this collection was reissued under different self-advertising cancel-titles in Edinburgh (1739) and London (1744). <br>
<br>On 12 August 1736 Malcolm was elected FSA, but he evidently spent too much time in London on publication projects because he was deposed from his Duddingston ministry on 24 March 1742 for having deserted his charge for two years without leave. The sentence of deposition was recalled only when he demitted (that is, abdicated) his ministry on 27 April 1743. In the following year he unsuccessfully attempted to ensure that his wife and children could benefit from a newly established ministers' widows' fund. His eldest son, John, an army surgeon and physician in Ayr, was acting for him in financial affairs by 1743, suggesting that he was ill or otherwise incapacitated  (Baird, 218). David Malcolm died on 7 February 1748.<br>
