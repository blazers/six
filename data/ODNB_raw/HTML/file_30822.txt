<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blackett,  Patrick Maynard Stuart</span>, Baron Blackett  (1897&#150;1974), <span class="occ">physicist and government and military adviser</span>, was born on 18 November 1897 at Kensington, London, the only son and the second of three children of Arthur Stuart Blackett (1865&#150;1922), stockbroker, and his wife, Caroline Frances (1868&#150;1954), daughter of Major Charles Maynard RA, a veteran of the Indian mutiny.<h2>
<a name="Educationandmarriage"></a>Education and marriage</h2>Blackett received his early education at a preparatory school in High Street, Guildford, from 1907 and entered Royal Naval College at Osborne in 1910, moving on to Royal Naval College at Dartmouth in 1912, as was customary for naval cadets. When war broke out in August 1914 he and other cadets were immediately sent into action, and he participated in the battle of the Falkland Islands in 1914 and the battle of Jutland in 1916. Promoted to lieutenant in May 1918, he resigned from the navy shortly after January 1919 when the Admiralty sent him to Cambridge along with other officers whose study had been interrupted in 1914. He completed part one of the mathematical tripos in May 1919 and part two of the natural sciences tripos (physics) in 1921, graduating with first-class honours that year. He was elected to a Bye fellowship at his college, Magdalene, and in autumn 1921 he became a research student under Ernest Rutherford at the Cavendish Laboratory.<br>
<br>In 1923 Blackett was elected a fellow of King's College, a position that he held until 1933, to which he added a university lectureship in 1930. He spent the academic year 1924&#150;5 with the physicist James Franck in G&ouml;ttingen during the second of a two-year tenureship of the Moseley research fellowship of the Royal Society. In March 1924 he married Costanza 
    (or Constanza; <i>b</i>. 1899)
  , daughter of Eugenio Bayon, an Italian. Their daughter, Giovanna, was born in 1926 and their son, Nicolas (or Nicholas) Maynard, in 1928.<h2>
<a name="Subatomicphysics19211938"></a>Subatomic physics, 1921&#150;1938</h2>During the Cambridge and G&ouml;ttingen years Blackett established solid credentials as an experimental nuclear physicist in work that led to the award of the Nobel prize in physics in 1948. He was enthusiastic about the rapidly developing theory of quantum mechanics; his experimental researches addressed fundamental questions within a broad theoretical context. In the widely admired essay on &#145;The craft of experimental physics&#146;, he emphasized that &#145;the experimental physicist must be enough of a theorist to know what experiments are worth doing and enough of a craftsman to be able to do them. He is only preeminent in being able to do both&#146;  (in <span class="italic">University Studies</span>, ed. H. Wright, 1933, 67).<br>
<br>At the Cavendish Blackett, like many of his fellow researchers, was put to work by Rutherford counting the microscopic scintillations that provided evidence of the expulsion of protons from atomic nuclei targeted with fast alpha particles. From the scintillation work Blackett estimated that a million alpha particles fired into nitrogen should result in about twenty disintegration protons. Rutherford was also interested in using the cloud chamber as a detector in which vapour condenses on ionized particles during the expansion of gas. By developing an automatic cloud chamber Blackett, in the summer of 1924, obtained 23,000 photographs showing 415,000 tracks of ionized particles, of which eight tracks were of a strikingly different type. These showed the path of a proton ejected from a recoiling nitrogen nucleus and the capture of the alpha particle by the nitrogen nucleus, creating an isotope of oxygen. Blackett's classic paper, published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</span> in 1925, included photographs that have been widely reprinted ever since.<br>
<br>While in Berlin in 1930 Blackett met Bruno Rossi, who was studying ways to use the Geiger&#150;M&uuml;ller counter to detect charged particles in cosmic radiation. Rossi arranged for Giuseppe P. S. Occhialini to visit Blackett at the Cavendish in order to learn cloud chamber techniques. Blackett and Occhialini soon developed a counter controlled cloud chamber in which the expansion of the chamber was triggered by the passage of charged particles through the plane of the chamber.<br>
<br>In late 1932 Carl D. Anderson, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, published his discovery of a positively charged particle with a mass smaller than the proton. In March 1933 Anderson suggested that the particle was a positively charged electron (positron). By that time, in February 1933, Blackett and Occhialini had communicated to the Royal Society the results of 700 automatic expansions resulting in 500 tracks of cosmic ray particles, of which fourteen tracks were evidence for the existence of a positive electron. In contrast to Anderson's 1932 paper, they explicitly associated the new particle with Cambridge physicist P. A. M. Dirac's recent formulation of quantum mechanics that predicted pair production of an electron and an anti-electron. Later Blackett questioned new reports by Anderson and S. H. Neddermeyer that they had identified a particle heavier than the electron in the penetrating cosmic rays. However, by 1938 he had accepted the interpretation of what came to be called the mu-meson (muon).<br>
<br>In 1933, the year that Blackett was elected FRS, he moved to Birkbeck College in London in order to head his own laboratory. In co-ordination with Metropolitan-Vickers in Manchester he designed a large electromagnet for use with the cloud chamber. Blackett set up his equipment 100 feet below ground at an unused platform in Holborn tube station, attracting the attention of science journalists who compared his investigations to those of Sherlock Holmes. In 1937 he succeeded William Lawrence Bragg as Langworthy professor of physics at the University of Manchester. From 1937 to 1953 he built an international physics school with expanding student enrolments; distinguished foreign visitors, some of them refugees from Europe; and intersecting research programmes that came to include the work of D. R. Hartree and L&eacute;on Rosenfeld in theoretical physics; J. G. Wilson, G. D. Rochester, L. J&aacute;nossy, and C. C. Butler in cosmic ray physics; and Bernard Lovell in radio astronomy.<h2>
<a name="Militaryresearchandpoliticalinvolvements19351948"></a>Military research and political involvements, 1935&#150;1948</h2>From the 1930s onwards, Blackett's attention focused equally on military and political matters. While in London in 1935 he joined a committee chaired by Henry T. Tizard that advised the Air Ministry to give high priority to the development of radar for defence against enemy air attack. This argument prevailed over the objections of Frederick A. Lindemann, who was to become Winston Churchill's scientific adviser in 1939. At the outbreak of war Blackett joined the instrument section of the Royal Aircraft Establishment where he worked with H. J. J. Braddick on the design of the Mark 14 bombsight. This instrument eliminated the need for a level bombing run at the time of bomb release.<br>
<br>In August 1940 Blackett became scientific adviser to General Frederick A. Pile, the commander-in-chief of anti-aircraft command. Blackett organized a group of scientists to study the operational use of radar sets, guns, and mechanical calculators, resulting in improved accuracy of anti-aircraft fire during the battle of Britain. Joining Coastal Command in March 1941, he headed a group that recalculated the depth settings for anti-submarine explosives, and applied mathematical techniques (Poisson's distribution) to settle tactical and strategic arguments within the command. At the Admiralty from January 1942 to the summer of 1945 Blackett, and &#145;Blackett's circus&#146;, as it became known, exerted a major influence on the British battle against U-boats, and brought about significant improvement in the use of airborne radar for finding German submarines that were sinking Allied merchant ships.<br>
<br>Two reports that Blackett drafted in 1941 on the organization and methodology of operational research enjoyed broad circulation in Great Britain and elsewhere, appearing later in his <span class="italic">Studies of War</span> (1962). By the late 1950s Blackett was expressing misgivings about the teaching of operational research as an academic speciality, especially the use of game theory, which he considered practically inadequate and morally suspect in its application to warfare. On the other hand he was optimistic, like some other veterans of operational research, about the use of operational research in industry.<br>
<br>During 1942&#150;3 Blackett incensed some members of the government and the Air Ministry by arguing against Lindemann's recommendation for saturation bombing and the targeting of civilian housing in German cities. He was also the sole dissenting member in June 1941 from the finding of the Maud committee that an atomic bomb could be produced by 1943 at a cost of &pound;5 million; instead, he recommended that the project should be co-ordinated with work in the USA, as indeed subsequently occurred. Again during 1945&#150;7, when appointed to the advisory committee on atomic energy, his views diverged from majority opinion as he opposed British development of atomic weapons and argued for a neutralist foreign policy. Having failed to influence government policy, Blackett circulated his opinions, first in the Fabian Society publication <span class="italic">The Atom and the Charter</span> (1946) and then in the widely read book <span class="italic">Military and Political Consequences of Atomic Energy</span> (1948), published in the United States under the title <span class="italic">Fear, War and the Bomb</span>. This book excited considerable criticism for its sympathetic treatment of Soviet objections to American plans for international control of atomic energy, for its suspicion of American post-war global ambitions, for its criticism of British bombing strategy during the war, and for its debunking of claims that bombs alone could win a war.<h2>
<a name="Postwaractivitiesinscienceandpolitics"></a>Post-war activities in science and politics</h2>During the immediate post-war years, as Blackett returned to the problem of the origins and distribution of cosmic radiation, he revived the hypothesis that the magnetic fields of the sun, stars, and the earth are a fundamental property of their rotating mass. His presentation in May 1947 of a simple equation involving Newton's constant of universal gravitation and the speed of light led journalists to compare his work with Einstein's theory of relativity.<br>
<br>While marshalling evidence for his theory from the fields of quantum electrodynamics, astronomy, and geophysics, Blackett developed a magnetometer of great sensitivity and precision in order to measure a predicted magnetic effect on the order of 10<sup>-8</sup> Gauss for experimental cylinders. In 1952 he communicated his negative results to the Royal Society, as well as the failure of other lines of evidence to confirm his hypothesis. He offered a masterful account of his geomagnetic theory and of the operation of his magnetometer, noting its suitability for measuring remanent magnetism in sedimentary rocks that might corroborate the hypothesis of continental drift. He built up a research group for studying rock magnetism, first at Manchester and then at Imperial College, where he moved from Manchester in 1953. After a decade of fostering geophysical research, much of it led by Edward Bullard, Stanley Runcorn, and J. A. Clegg, Blackett initiated a Royal Society discussion meeting on continental drift in March 1964 that had a great impact on the acceptance of the hypothesis of continental drift and the development of the theory of plate tectonics.<br>
<br>During the 1940s and 1950s Blackett was a forceful advocate of university expansion and government funding of research and development. He was a member of the Barlow committee (1945&#150;6), the council and the research grants committee of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (1956&#150;1960), and the National Research Development Corporation (1949&#150;64), where he pushed for the development of the computer industry. He was dean of the faculty of science (1948&#150;50) and pro-vice-chancellor (1950&#150;52) at Manchester; dean of the Royal College of Science (1955&#150;60) and pro-rector (1961&#150;4) in London. After formally retiring from Imperial College and the University of London in September 1965 Blackett served as president of the Royal Society from 1965 to 1970.<br>
<br>Blackett had longstanding Fabian and socialist political allegiances, dating from his undergraduate years at Magdalene College. His conception of laboratory organization emphasized co-operation and teamwork. As he told Brian Connell of Anglia Television in 1971, a good laboratory is a place where ordinary people do first-class work. He was an active member and president (1943&#150;6) of the trade unionist British Association of Scientific Workers. The grandson of a vicar, he respected religious observances that were established social customs, but described himself as agnostic or atheist.<br>
<br>Blackett felt more at home in London than in Cambridge, declining in 1953 to be considered as a candidate to succeed Bragg as director of the Cavendish Laboratory. During 1939&#150;40 he was part of the London based <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95704', "Tots and Quots")</script> political dining club organized by Solly Zuckermann. From 1953 to 1963 he met a group of scientists hosted by J. R. M. Brumwell, and including J. D. Bernal and C. P. Snow among others, who advised Hugh Gaitskell, as leader of the Labour Party, and then Harold Wilson and his shadow minister for education, Richard Crossman. The expansion of science and technology became a main platform of the Labour Party in the 1964 general election.<br>
<br>Blackett first travelled to India in 1947, and increasingly became concerned with improving living conditions in poorer countries of the world through applications of science and technology. His sympathetic attitude toward the Soviet Union was based largely in his optimism that socialism and science could improve human welfare. Blackett was appointed CH in 1965 and OM in 1967. He never took a PhD, but he held twenty honorary degrees and was an honorary member of academic or other institutions in eleven countries, including the Soviet Union and China. His honours also included the royal medal in 1940 and the Copley medal in 1956, both from the Royal Society. In 1969 he was created a life peer, an honour that he had declined five years earlier. Sir Edward Bullard recalled Blackett's quip that, at any rate, he had remained Mr Blackett until after he retired  (Bullard, 370).<br>
<br>Tall and handsome, Blackett was a powerful and versatile figure in British scientific and governmental circles. He was a problem solver who was willing to take responsibility and to assess responsibility. &#145;Never say &#147;They&#148;&#146;, he cautioned a friend, &#145;it's a sign of frustration and woolly thinking and will get you nowhere&#146;  (Hodgkin and others, 137). He believed that science, clear thinking, and good will could win the day. He died in London on 13 July 1974.<br>
