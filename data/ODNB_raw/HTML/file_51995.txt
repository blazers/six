<span class="headword">Cox,  Homersham</span>  (1821&#150;1897), <span class="occ">judge, mathematician, and author</span>, was born on 19 June 1821 at Newington, Surrey. The fourth son of Edward Treslove Cox, he was educated at Tonbridge School (1830&#150;39) and at Jesus College, Cambridge (1839&#150;44), graduating with second-class honours in the mathematical tripos. He registered as a student of the Inner Temple on 2 May 1845, and was called to the bar on 13 June 1851.<br>
<br>Cox supplemented his income from his law practice by writing for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> for a number of years. He was acknowledged as both a speedy and a brilliant writer of leaders. He also wrote books upon a remarkably diverse range of subjects: differential and integral calculus, the institutions of British government, the law of parliamentary elections. His best-known and most successful work was titled <span class="italic">The First Century of Christianity</span> (1886; rev. edn, 1892); his <span class="italic">History of the Reform Bills of 1866 and 1867</span> (1868) and his <span class="italic">Institutions of English Government</span> (1863) are probably those of enduring interest, the latter reflecting his whiggish historicism.<br>
<br>Cox was appointed a commissioner at the Beverley election inquiry in 1869, and two years later was made a county court judge to serve on circuit no. 24 in mid-Wales. Thirteen years later, in 1884, he transferred to Cardiff, but within months replaced Judge Lindsdale on the Mid Kent circuit, where he remained until his retirement in 1893. The townsfolk of Tonbridge evinced much pride and pleasure in the success of a local boy as judge, and were gratified that Cox was awarded &#145;the biggest pension that could be awarded him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Maidstone &amp; Kentish Journal</span>).<br>
<br>Cox was married to Margaret Lucy (<i>b</i>. 1832/3), whose maiden name is not known. They had at least five daughters and four sons. His second son was the economist and journalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32602/', "Harold Cox")</script>. He died at his home, Marlfield House, Tonbridge, after a very short illness, on 10 March 1897, and was buried two days later at Tonbridge cemetery.<br>
