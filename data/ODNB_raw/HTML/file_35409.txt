<span class="headword">Paton,  Diarmid No&euml;l</span>  (1859&#150;1928), <span class="occ">physiologist</span>, was born on 19 March 1859 in Edinburgh, the eldest of the seven sons (there were four daughters) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35413/', "Sir (Joseph) No&#235;l Paton (1821&#150;1901)")</script>, artist, and his wife, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1900), daughter of Alexander Ferrier, of Bloomhill, Dunbartonshire. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and Edinburgh University. He graduated BSc in 1880 and MB, CM, with first-class honours in 1882. In the same year he was elected Baxter scholar in natural science.<br>
<br>After a brief period of study in Vienna and Paris, Paton returned to Edinburgh, where he took up a house appointment at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and later at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. In 1883&#150;4 he was awarded a biological fellowship in the Edinburgh physiological department under Professor William Rutherford. In 1886 Paton was elected lecturer in physiology at Surgeons' Hall (School of Medicine of Royal Colleges, Edinburgh), and in 1890 was appointed superintendent of the research laboratory of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. The output from the laboratory was remarkable for its quantity and diversity.<br>
<br>In 1898 Paton married Agatha Henrietta, daughter of Alexander Balfour, merchant, of Dawyck, Peeblesshire, and had one son and one daughter. He left Edinburgh in 1906 to take up the regius professorship of physiology in Glasgow University, a position which he held until his retirement in 1928. Paton was regarded as a stimulating teacher, a helpful colleague, and an enthusiastic researcher.<br>
<br>Attracted from the first by the chemical aspects of physiology, Paton was one of the earliest workers in Great Britain to take up the study of metabolism and nutrition. In 1901, with J. C. Dunlop and E. Inglis, he published <span class="italic">A Study of the Diet of the Labouring Classes of Edinburgh</span>, which was based on the methods of W. O. Atwater, the American pioneer of dietary surveys. Paton supervised a similar study of the working-class diet in Glasgow, published by D. E. Lindsay in 1913. During the First World War he served on the Royal Society's food (war) committee and represented the society on the Ministry of Food's rationing committee.<br>
<br>In 1913 Paton became responsible for supervising a large programme of research on rickets in Glasgow, for the newly formed Medical Research Committee (later Medical Research Council). This involved laboratory, clinical, and sociological investigations. The results of one of these projects were published as <span class="italic">Social and Economic Factors in the Causation of Rickets</span> by M. Ferguson in 1918. With Leonard Findlay, later professor of paediatrics at Glasgow, Paton opposed the vitamin theory of rickets of Edward Mellanby, arguing that the essential factors were not dietetic but hygienic, and that rickets was associated with lack of fresh air and exercise, poor housing, and inadequate maternal care.<br>
<br>As chair of the Medical Research Council's Scottish child life investigations committee, Paton was responsible for co-ordinating a wide range of studies on prenatal, infant, and childhood ill health. Paton and Findlay's report <span class="italic">Poverty, Nutrition and Growth</span> (1926) argued that the main factors influencing variation in the growth and nutrition of children were maternal efficiency and housing conditions rather than poverty <i>per se</i>.<br>
<br>Paton was also intensely interested in the endocrine glands, and in 1913 published his lectures on the subject as the <span class="italic">Nervous and Chemical Regulators of Metabolism</span>. In 1926 he also published <span class="italic">The Physiology of the Continuity of Life</span>, in which he vigorously attacked many of the orthodox views on the mechanisms of inheritance. In all he published some ninety papers, as well as textbooks for medical and veterinary students.<br>
<br>Paton was appointed a member of the royal commission on salmon fisheries (1900) and of the Medical Research Council (1918&#150;23). Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1914, he was on its council from 1922 to 1924. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1886), and a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (1886). He received an honorary LLD degree from Edinburgh University in 1919. He died suddenly, while walking to the River Tweed, near his home at Wester Dawyck, Stobo, Peeblesshire, on 30 September 1928. His wife survived him.<br>
