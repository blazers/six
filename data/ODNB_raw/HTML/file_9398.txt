<span class="headword">Fielden,  John</span>  (1784&#150;1849), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born on 17 January 1784 at home at Laneside, Todmorden, Lancashire, the third of the eight children of Joshua Fielden (1748&#150;1811), tenant farmer and clothier, and his wife, Jennifer (Jenny) Greenwood (1749&#150;1825). He had no formal schooling. From a very early age he worked in his father's spinning mills and accompanied him on weekly trips to Manchester, 20 miles away, to exchange yarn and calico for raw cotton. When his father retired in 1803, John, though the third brother, assumed the leading role in the firm and directed its growth, as Fielden Brothers, into one of the largest cotton-manufacturing concerns in the country. In 1811 he married Ann Grindrod (<i>d</i>. 1831), daughter of a Rochdale grocer, and moved with her into Dawson Weir, a modest house in the Rochdale Road in Todmorden, opposite Waterside, the largest of Fielden Brothers' mills. Together they had eight children, three sons, including the cotton manufacturer and politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55782/', "Joshua Fielden")</script>, and five daughters, one of whom died in infancy.<br>
<br>Both Fielden's parents were Quakers and he was raised in the Society of Friends. But in 1801 his interest in Sunday school teaching led him to join first the Methodists, and then the Methodist Unitarians, a small Pennine sect led by Joseph Cooke that tried to combine Methodist piety with Unitarian rationalism. Fielden built and owned the first Unitarian chapel in Todmorden, and he attended regularly, serving as superintendent of the Sunday school, where he had a reputation for &#145;severe but wholesome discipline&#146;  (Law, 54). Though never ostentatiously so, he was a deeply religious man, equally committed to worship, prayer, and scripture. His most consistent reading was the <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>After business, family, and faith, politics was from an early age Fielden's main interest. His father was a tory, but Fielden grew up in the blissful dawn of the French Revolution and soon became, his father complained, &#145;as arrant [a] Jacobin as any in the Kingdom&#146;  (Weaver, 23). An avid reader of Thomas Paine and William Cobbett, he had a particular interest in their &#145;currency crotchets&#146;, as critics called them&#151;particularly their opposition to paper money&#151;and in their radical prescriptions to reduce government expenditure in the face of an ever-swelling national debt. In 1816 Fielden supported the Manchester merchant Nathaniel Gould in his campaign for factory reform. He was an early and outspoken advocate of a minimum wage for hand-loom weavers. Though not especially democratic in his dealings with his own workers, he believed in democracy in the abstract, and was a founding member of the Manchester Political Union in 1830. In 1832 he agreed to stand alongside Cobbett for the new parliamentary borough of Oldham, and was easily returned at the head of the poll. His maiden speech was as the seconder of Cobbett's amendment to the address, and he also seconded Cobbett's famous motion to remove Robert Peel from the privy council. &#145;So long as I sit in Parliament&#146;, he had promised his constituents, &#145;Mr Cobbett's measures shall not want a supporter&#146;  (Weaver, 66). In this he proved as good as his word.<br>
<br>But Fielden was not otherwise an impressive or effective MP. His voice was weak, he spoke in a thick provincial accent that few members understood, and his thoughts seldom ranged beyond the uninspiring realm of industrial statistics. Until 1846, when he assumed parliamentary sponsorship of the <span class="roman">Ten Hours Bill</span>, his importance to popular politics lay in his influence out of doors. In 1833 he joined with Robert Owen in a short-lived effort to achieve an eight-hour working day by way of a general strike. A year later he organized a petitioning campaign among hand-loom weavers that led to the appointment of a committee of inquiry under Sir John Maxwell. Fielden was the author of the minimum-wage legislation that Maxwell introduced in parliament in 1835. When it failed, he joined Richard Oastler and Joseph Rayner Stephens in leading an increasingly militant factory movement in the north. In <span class="italic">The Curse of the Factory System</span> (1836), the most substantial and influential of his several political pamphlets, he argued that a shorter working day would serve the interests of owners and employees by stemming over-production and restoring a healthy level of demand for cotton goods. It was a familiar argument, but that it came in this case from a leading textile master gave it a public credibility that it would otherwise have lacked.<br>
<br>Like many factory reformers, Fielden was irreconcilably hostile to the new poor law, and when the government attempted to introduce it in the north, he helped orchestrate a furious campaign of resistance. Thanks to his and his children's influence, Todmorden would see no workhouse until 1878. A firm believer in manhood suffrage, Fielden addressed several Chartist demonstrations in 1838 and 1839. In June 1839 he helped Thomas Attwood present the Chartist national petition to parliament. His main interest thereafter was in factory reform. He was a strong supporter of Lord Ashley's unsuccessful <span class="roman">Ten Hours Bill</span> in 1844. On Ashley's temporary withdrawal from the House of Commons in January 1846, the bill was entrusted to him and, after one defeat on 29 April 1846, he carried the crucial second reading on 10 February 1847. After an easy passage through the House of Lords, the <span class="roman">Ten Hours Act</span> received the royal assent on 8 June 1847. More than the great moment of Fielden's life, it was the turning point of an age, the first significant admission of governmental responsibility for the welfare of the working poor.<br>
<br>Fielden lost his seat at the general election of 1847, largely because he insisted on standing alongside the unpopular J. M. Cobbett (William Cobbett's son and his own prospective son-in-law). He died of unknown causes at Skeynes Park, his country estate at Edenbridge in Kent, on 29 May 1849, survived by six of his children and his second wife, Elizabeth Dearden of Halifax, whom he had married in 1833 or 1834. He was buried on 4 June 1849 at the Unitarian chapel, Todmorden. &#145;History for the most part ignores him&#146; wrote G. D. H. Cole of this man, whose simplicity and integrity of character earned him the sobriquet of Honest John Fielden. &#145;Yet he, if anyone, for faithfulness, honesty, and persistence in well-doing deserves to be remembered among the people&#146;  (Cole, 238).<br>
