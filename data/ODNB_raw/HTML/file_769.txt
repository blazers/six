<span class="headword">Ashton,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1658), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was of unknown background and origins, though he was a citizen of London, having (on his own account) been &#145;a gentleman borne&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span>, no. 423, 667). He is chiefly remembered for his involvement in a plot against Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell in 1658. It was reported that, like at least two other parties to the plot, Sir William Leighton and Timothy Wright, he had been present at the siege of Colchester in 1648, having &#145;formerly commanded the Butchers in that town, and had now engaged them for this design&#146;  (<span class="italic">Publick Intelligencer</span>, no. 129, 638). This may suggest that he was a butcher by trade.<br>
<br>Ashton was by no means the controlling mind behind the conspiracy, later claiming to have been drawn into it by others who had dazzled him with the promise of a regiment. But his role was not negligible; he had, according to a resident of the King's Head in St Swithin, attended many of the plotters' meetings there and had been entrusted with money by one of the principals, Robert Manley. Ashton was to command a &#145;regiment&#146; of foot, with a Major Goodwin as his second in command. It was he who suggested that the insurrectionists should wear, as a means of recognition, white tape tied around their arms. According to one press report &#145;Colonel Ashton was to make all sure about Cripplegate, Newgate and Aldersgate&#146;  (<span class="italic">Publick Intelligencer</span>, no. 129, 584). However, at his trial it was charged only that he had agreed &#145;to block up the Tower, and for that end his main post was to have been at [All Hallows] Barking church at the upper end of Tower Street&#146;  (ibid., 641). On Friday 14 May 1658 the conspirators met for the last time, at the Mermaid tavern in Cheapside, setting the action for 11 p.m. the following night, &#145;when the chimes should go at Bow and in Cornhill&#146;  (ibid., 638). But the government had received regular bulletins about their preparations, and Thurloe's secretary was told immediately that the attempt was imminent. Strong military patrols were sent into the City, and there were many arrests.<br>
<br>Once captive the conspirators' chances of escaping death were not improved by allegations that they had planned to create civic chaos by firing buildings in the city and throwing open its prisons. On 17 June 1658 it was reported that an order had been issued for the trial of seven leaders, including Ashton, &#145;for the traitrous design of insurrection contrived&#146;  (<span class="italic">Publick Intelligencer</span>, no. 130, 618). On 1 July these men appeared before the commissioners of the high court of justice at Westminster. Ashton pleaded not guilty, but did not deny the substance of the charges against him. Six of the seven defendants were found guilty and sentenced to death; three were eventually reprieved, but Ashton was not among them. On 7 July he was accompanied to the place of his execution by Thomas Warmestry, the sequestered rector of Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire. Between nine and ten in the morning he was &#145;conveyed in a sled from Newgate, drawn with four horses (Dr Warmestry sitting in the sled with him) to Tower street, over against Mark Lane end&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Politicus</span>, no. 423, 665). At the request of the condemned man, Warmestry prayed for his soul. On the scaffold Ashton bemoaned his &#145;shameful death&#146;. God had often forgiven him his sins, but now, He &#145;hath visited me at this time, because I slighted, and did not follow that repentance that I promised&#146;  (p. 667). When he had finished speaking, the writer faithfully records:<blockquote>the executioner turned him off the ladder; and afterwards being cut down, he ripped up his belly, took out the bowels, and burnt them in a fire readie prepared upon the place. Then his head was cut off, and his body divided into four quarters. (p. 668)</blockquote>
