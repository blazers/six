<span class="headword">Taunton,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1769, <em>d.</em> 1821), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, son of Charles Taunton, a farmer, was born at Pye Mill in Paxford, a hamlet of Blockley in Gloucestershire. He was baptized on 21 May 1769 in the parish church of Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, and was brought up as a farmer; but a study of anatomy drew him to London. Being a stranger to London he asked at a shop in Holborn for the name of the best surgeon and anatomical instructor, and was advised that it was Andrew Marshal, whose anatomical school was in Thavies Inn, Holborn. Taunton immediately called upon Marshal, but he did not attend his classes, and he eventually became a pupil of Henry Cline at St Thomas's Hospital.<br>
<br>In 1801 Taunton was appointed demonstrator of anatomy at Guy's Hospital, in temporary charge during the illness of John Cunningham Saunders, and he subsequently became principal lecturer at the London Anatomical Society. He was surgeon to the City Dispensary in 1801, at a time when the charity was almost bankrupt; but under his able guidance it quickly became a flourishing establishment. His position as surgeon to the City Dispensary led him to treat large numbers of poor weavers in Spitalfields who suffered from <i>prolapsus ani</i>, hernia, and other diseases common to their occupation. Curing these conditions required expensive medical equipment, and this led to the establishment of the City of London Truss Society in 1807, when Taunton, with the assistance of a young bell-hanger, began to manufacture trusses for distribution among the poor of the neighbourhood. Taunton had also become surgeon to the Finsbury Dispensary some time about 1800, and reformed its whole constitution.<br>
<br>Taunton took an active part at the Medical Society of London, which he nearly wrecked in 1812 by proposing as secretary, and carrying against all opposition, Thomas Joseph Pettigrew, his former apprentice, then newly admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, instead of Dr Birkbeck, whose position as a senior member of the profession should have won him the contest. Taunton had a very large dispensary practice and visited the sick poor at their own homes, which were distributed over large areas. He performed his duties conscientiously, yet he still found time to carry out innumerable post-mortem examinations and to make many pathological preparations. He also established a private medical school, at which he sought to supplement the poor training given to medical students at the various hospitals in London. Married, with three sons, Taunton died at his house in Hatton Garden, London, on Monday morning, 5 March 1821.<br>
