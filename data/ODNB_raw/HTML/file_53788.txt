<span class="headword">Kay,  William Kilbourne</span>  (1856&#150;1929), <span class="occ">mail-order retailer</span>, was born on 11 September 1856 at Market Harborough, Leicestershire, the son of Richard Kay, a doctor. Nothing else is known about his education or early life. However, on 15 February 1883, when he married Jessie Farenden (<i>b</i>. 1857/8), daughter of Charles Farenden, telegraph engineer, in Southampton, he was described on the marriage certificate as a jeweller's assistant. By 1886 Kay was selling goods via mail-order catalogue from premises in Foregate Street, Worcester. He was not the founder of British mail-order retailing; Pryce Jones has a greater claim, and the Bradford-based Fattorini family was ahead of him in selling to customers organized into clubs. Yet he was the first mail-order retailer to devote himself exclusively to the mail-order club business. By 1894 he had embraced the club system in a big way, supplying watches and jewellery to members of &#145;Kay's Universal Clubs&#146;. Each club member paid a weekly instalment, in total sufficient to purchase an item from the catalogue, and then drew lots to decide whose turn it was to take it home. This boosted the purchasing power of individual customers who might otherwise not have bought at all.<br>
<br>Kay's business flourished and in 1896 he bought Skarratt &amp; Co., long established as watchmakers in Worcester. This allowed him to claim that his firm dated from 1794. It also enabled him to manufacture a range of English Lever watches; these sold in thousands to railwaymen requiring a reliable timepiece. By 1900 Kay was employing fifty packers and clerks at his extensive Shrub Hill premises and he was able to claim that his 6000 spare-time agents were servicing 250,000 customers annually. Kay's catalogue was by then offering a vast range of goods, including clothing, boots and shoes, and household furniture. By 1919, when the company cheekily published a brochure to celebrate 125 years in business, its customers numbered about 500,000.<br>
<br>Kay was a ruthless competitor, not averse to denigrating rival firms, some of which, he claimed, &#145;were under the thumb of unscrupulous Jews&#146;  (Kay &amp; Co. <span class="italic">Catalogue</span>). As an employer he was a stern disciplinarian, though proud that his modern offices made &#145;every reasonable provision for the health and comfort of those engaged&#146;  (Kay &amp; Co., <span class="italic">125 Years</span>, 13). He did not neglect civic duties, and served the city of Worcester as high sheriff in 1898&#150;9, councillor from 1896 to 1902, and magistrate from 1900. Kay died at his Worcester home, The Elms, Battenhall, on 2 May 1929, having been ill for three years, and was buried in the churchyard at Hallow, just outside the city. Little is known about his personal life, but he was survived by his wife and by three sons and three daughters. The family retained control of the firm until 1937, when it was absorbed into Isaac Wolfson's Great Universal Stores group.<br>
