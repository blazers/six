<span class="headword">Osric</span>  (<em>d.</em> 729), <span class="occ">king of Northumbria</span>, began his reign in 718. He therefore ruled for eleven years of Bede's life, but no information other than his accession and death is given in the <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica</span>. There is no contemporary evidence for his paternity. Twelfth-century sources, including the history of the church of Durham attributed to Symeon of Durham and the <span class="italic">Series regum Northymbrensium</span>, claim that his father was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/306/', "Aldfrith")</script> (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20930/', "Oswiu's")</script> illegitimate Irish-born son), and therefore that he was brother to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20903/', "Osred I")</script>. Alternatively, it has been suggested that he was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/286/', "Alchfrith")</script> (Oswiu's eldest son, who was subking in Deira but who fought against him). This theory has been extended to equating him with an Osric who is recorded as a king of the Hwicce between about 676 and 690  (Bede, <span class="italic">Hist. eccl.</span>, 4.23), but the suggestion that he ruled in this part of western Mercia thirty years before becoming king of Northumbria is based mainly on an equation of the two names and would mean that he became king for the second time at the age of sixty-five. The obscurity over Osric's background may conceal an irregularity in his birth, but he appears to have been the last of the old line of Northumbrian kings descended from Ida through &AElig;thelfrith. A taint of illegitimacy may have opened the way for rival claimants to the throne.<br>
<br>The suggestion that Osric was young enough to be a puppet of Wilfrid's faction at the Northumbrian court seems unlikely, since it has also been shown that he must have been aged between fourteen and twenty when he came to the throne, if he was a son of Aldfrith, and much older if a son of Alchfrith. He is said by Bede to have nominated his successor, Ceolwulf (<i>d</i>. 764), although he was of a different lineage. William of Malmesbury in the twelfth century claimed that Osric and his predecessor, Cenred (<i>r</i>. 716&#150;18), Ceolwulf's brother, were implicated in the death of Osred (<i>r</i>. 705/6&#150;716), but if Osric was Aldfrith's son this would imply that he allied with a rival lineage to murder his own brother, and may strengthen the argument that his father was Alchfrith.<br>
<br>Osric's name is recorded in an eighth-century calendar under 9 May, which accords with the date of his death as given by Bede  (<i>contra</i> Plummer in <span class="italic">Opera historica</span>, 1.349), though other commentators have tried to link this entry with the apostate <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20905/', "Osric (d. 634)")</script>, whose name, Bede states, was excluded from the regnal lists. The entry reads <i>Depositio Osrici regis</i>. Bede simply states that he died, but the entries in the A, B, and C texts of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> (under the year 731) claim that he was slain.<br>
