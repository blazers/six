<span class="headword">Evans,  William</span>  (1809&#150;1858), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, known both as Evans of Bristol and as Welsh Evans to distinguish him from William Evans of Eton, was probably born in Bristol, where his father, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8967/', "John Evans (bap. 1774, d. 1828)")</script>, was a printer. Nothing is known of William's early life. He was taught drawing in Bristol by Francis Danby (<i>c</i>.1824&#150;<i>c</i>.1826) and between 1827 and 1832 was himself giving drawing lessons in Clifton. In 1832&#150;3 he was a member of a sketching club in Bristol whose members also included W. J. M&uuml;ller and J. S. Prout [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95531', "Bristol school of artists")</script>]. A drawing, <span class="italic">Chepstow Old Toll Gate</span>, dated 1834 (NL Wales, Aberystwyth), provides evidence of an early visit to Wales, perhaps in the company of friends from the sketching club, and he certainly toured with M&uuml;ller, who seems to have been his closest companion, in 1842. The <span class="italic">View of Snowdon</span> (City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery) is dated 1843, suggesting that by this time north Wales provided the main focus for his work.<br>
<br>From about 1844 Evans lodged at T&#375;'n-y-cae, a cottage near the Fairy Glen at Betws-y-coed in the Conwy valley, and thereby became one of the first resident painters of the artists' colony popularized by David Cox, whose annual summer visits to the village commenced in that year. Evans's relationship with the increasing number of painters, both summer visitors and residents, who frequented Betws-y-coed at this time is unclear, but the paucity of references to him in letters and diaries suggests that he may have been less sociable than many of his contemporaries. He certainly lived in poverty and dire conditions at T&#375;'n-y-cae but produced some of the most lyrical landscape watercolours of the period there, as open and fluid as the later works of Cox, along with studies of domestic interiors and of the local people which reflect his earlier contact with M&uuml;ller. Among the small number of his works which survive in public collections, the <span class="italic">Autumn Landscape, North Wales</span> (BM), painted about 1844, is characteristic of his style in the Betws-y-coed period.<br>
<br>Subjects from other parts of Wales and from England demonstrate that Evans continued to travel in the 1840s. However, his health began to decline and he went to Italy in 1852, spending the winter successively at Genoa, Rome, and Naples. Evans settled in London probably in late 1854. His work was held in high esteem by his contemporaries in the Old Watercolour Society, where his work was exhibited between 1845 and 1859. He died at 143 Marylebone Road, London, on 8 December 1858, the cause of death given as asthma.<br>
