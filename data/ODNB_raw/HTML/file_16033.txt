<span class="headword">Langrishe, Sir  Hercules</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1729&#150;1811), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born in Knocktopher, co. Kilkenny, the second but only surviving son of Robert Langrishe (<i>c</i>.1696&#150;1770), landowner, of Knocktopher, and Anne, second daughter of Jonathan Whitby of Kilcregan in the same county. His great grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107359/', "Hercules Langrishe")</script>, parliamentary army officer [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107358/', "Langrishe, Hercules")</script>]. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated BA in the spring of 1753. A freeman of Kilkenny from 3 November 1750, he sat as MP for Knocktopher for six consecutive terms totalling almost forty years from 1761 until the abolition of the seat with the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> in 1800. The length of his tenure as MP has received much comment as has his advocacy for repealing the penal laws against Catholics, especially his introduction of the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span> of 1792. On 31 May 1755 he married Hannah (<i>d</i>. 1803), second daughter and coheir of Robert Myhill of Killarney, co. Kilkenny, and Mary Billingsley, and sister of Jane, wife of Charles, first marquess of Ely; they had three sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, Robert, second baronet (1756&#150;1835), also sat as MP for Knocktopher from 1783 to 1796.<br>
<br>Between 1762 and 1793 Langrishe supported a number of bills in the Irish parliament to repeal a range of anti-Catholic penal laws enacted in the 1690s and early 1700s. Up to 1782 these bills (none of them successful before 1778) concentrated on extending a number of property rights to Roman Catholics, including taking out mortgages on land, obtaining leases for terms in excess of thirty-one years, and purchasing and bequeathing freehold land. The British government supported Roman Catholic relief to curb the power of Irish protestants who were beginning to demand legislative independence in the wake of the American War of Independence (1775&#150;83).<br>
<br>Modern research suggests that Langrishe may have supported Roman Catholic relief bills for primarily fiscal reasons. First, he was rewarded for his support of the government with appointments to a succession of offices&#151;commissioner of barracks (1766&#150;74), supervisor of accounts (1767&#150;75), commissioner of revenue (1774&#150;1802), and commissioner of excise (1780&#150;1802)&#151;and by being made a baronet on 19 February 1777. He was also appointed an Irish privy councillor in 1786. Second, the Roman Catholic relief acts facilitated his manipulation of the vote in the borough of Knocktopher, which was almost entirely his property. His piecemeal acquisition of the remaining leasehold property in the borough enabled him to let holdings almost exclusively to Roman Catholic householders who were excluded from the franchise because of their religion. By 1783 there was only one protestant tenant in Knocktopher, a Dublin resident given the task of passing his vote in Langrishe's favour. The increased security of tenure experienced after 1782 by Roman Catholics limited the opportunity for any electorally unreliable protestant to move into Knocktopher.<br>
<br>Langrishe's politics were otherwise primarily pro-protestant. He opposed extending the parliamentary franchise to Catholics in 1784 and 1785 because, he felt, the resultant democracy would subvert the minority protestant administration in Ireland. He also opposed proposals to reform the tithe system in 1786&#150;7, whereby concessions would be made to non-Anglicans, because this would have impoverished the Church of Ireland clergy and would have broken with &#145;the principles of the glorious revolution to which we owe our religion and liberty&#146;  (Kelly, 122). However, prompted by Edmund Burke's <span class="italic">Letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe</span> (1792), he introduced a moderate relief bill in 1792 that allowed Catholics, among other things, to practise law, except as judges or as king's counsel. He seconded the <span class="roman">Catholic Relief Bill</span> of 1793, whereby Roman Catholics with freehold property worth 40<i>s</i>. gained the vote, partly from a fear of French revolutionary principles which he shared with the government. His view was that the &#145;old dangers of Popery were extinct; [and that] new dangers had arisen against which Catholics would be the truest allies&#146;  (Fewer, &#145;Land tenure&#146;, 58&#150;9). As the French revolutionary regime grew more repressive he opposed proposals to extend the franchise or further relax the penal laws in 1794, 1796, and 1797. He also acted as an official informer to the government regarding the state of co. Kilkenny during the 1798 rising.<br>
<br>Langrishe supported the government in other parliamentary matters by, for example, opposing the reduction of pensions and favouring the <span class="roman">Police Bill</span> in 1786&#150;8. At other times he opposed the government, especially during the unpopular administration of George, fourth Viscount Townshend (viceroy, 1767&#150;72), who had prorogued the Irish parliament between 1769 and 1771. Langrishe satirized the viceroy's administration in an anonymous essay entitled &#145;The history of Barataria continued&#146; that was published in the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> (April&#150;May 1771) and later reprinted with contributions by Henry Flood and Henry Grattan in <span class="italic">Baratariana</span>. He subsequently advocated a conciliatory policy towards the American colonists in 1775 and passively supported the legislative independence of the Irish parliament in 1782. After 1791, however, he came to support the government's desire for a legislative union between Britain and Ireland. With the passing of the <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> in 1800 he was subsequently compensated (as were other MPs regardless of whether they supported the act or not) for the loss of his parliamentary seat with the sum of &pound;13,862 10<i>s</i>., a sum far in excess of his estate's rental, which that year amounted to just over &pound;525. Langrishe died at his residence in St Stephen's Green, Dublin, on 1 February 1811 and was buried on 8 February at St Ann's in the same city.<br>
