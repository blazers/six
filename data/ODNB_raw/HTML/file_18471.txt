<span class="headword">Meade, Sir  Robert Henry</span>  (1835&#150;1898), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18470/', "Richard Meade, third earl of Clanwilliam (1795&#150;1879)")</script>, and of his wife, Lady Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1858), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13026/', "George Herbert, eleventh earl of Pembroke")</script>, was born on 16 December 1835, and educated at Harrow School and at Exeter College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 7 December 1854, graduating BA in 1859 and MA in 1860. On 1 June 1859 he entered the Foreign Office with the encouragement of his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13047/', "Sidney Herbert")</script>. He was dispatched to Syria with Lord Dufferin's special mission on 31 July 1860; on his return in September 1861 he was selected to accompany the prince of Wales in his tour through Palestine and eastern Europe in 1861&#150;2. In the autumn of 1862 he accompanied Earl Russell to Germany in attendance upon the queen. On 27 November 1862 he was appointed a groom of the bedchamber to the prince of Wales. In 1863 he accompanied Earl Granville abroad with the queen.<br>
<br>In June 1864 Meade became private secretary to Earl Granville as president of the council, and was with him until July 1866; he then resumed his work in the Foreign Office. When Lord Granville became, on 10 December 1868, secretary of state for the colonies, Meade accompanied him as private secretary to the Colonial Office. On 21 May 1871 Meade was appointed to an assistant under-secretaryship of state in the Colonial Office; from this time he devoted himself to the duties of his post which chiefly concerned colonies not possessing responsible government, the supervision of the West Indian and Eastern department, as well as financial and defence issues. In March 1883 he was offered, but declined, the position of permanent under-secretary at the Irish Office. He was a British delegate to the Berlin conference in December 1884. He there entered into negotiation with the German foreign ministry and with Prince Bismarck over African and Pacific issues. In 1885 he helped establish the interdepartmental colonial defence committee and later served on and sustained it.<br>
<br>In February 1892 Meade became permanent under-secretary for the colonies under Lord Knutsford, and subsequently served under Lord Ripon and Joseph Chamberlain. Later his health became indifferent; he was anxious to retire in 1895, but stayed on at the request of the secretary of state for a year longer. This was the period of the Jameson raid in South Africa which caused much work and worry. However, towards the end of 1896 he fell and broke his leg one evening while boarding a bus after leaving his office. He never returned to his work. Ill health and the sudden death of his daughter, Mary, in 1897 broke him down completely. She was the only child of his first marriage, on 19 April 1865, to Lady Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Lascelles, third earl of Harewood. Mary Elizabeth died on 7 February 1866. Meade was married again, on 13 April 1880, to Caroline Georgiana, daughter of Charles William Grenfell MP, of Taplow Court, Maidenhead. She, too, died within a year of their marriage, on 5 March 1881, following the birth of a son, Charles Francis. Meade died on 8 January 1898 at the Grand Central Hotel, Belfast. He was buried at Taplow, near Maidenhead. He became CB on 21 March 1885, KCB in 1894, and GCB in 1897.<br>
<br>Meade had considerable practical common sense and much tact, and was also a man of peculiar charm, greatly liked by all who knew him. He was one of a knot of official Liberals who formed a little coterie in the service of the crown from about 1870 to 1890.<br>
