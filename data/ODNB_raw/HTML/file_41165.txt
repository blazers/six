<span class="headword">Wedderburn, Sir  William</span>, fourth baronet  (1838&#150;1918), <span class="occ">administrator in India and politician</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 25 March 1838, the youngest son of seven children born to Sir John Wedderburn, second baronet (1789&#150;1862), of the East India Company service, and his wife, Henrietta Louise Milburn (<i>d</i>. 1881). He was educated at progressive private schools in Europe and Scotland and then at Edinburgh University, where he prepared himself for the Indian Civil Service public examinations. In choosing a career in India he was following in the footsteps of both his father and his eldest brother, John, who was killed in the uprising of 1857. William ranked third among some 160 candidates in the public examinations of 1859 and in the following year began his career in the Bombay presidency [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95501', "competition wallahs")</script>]. During a British furlough, on 12 September 1878, he married Mary Blanche (<i>d</i>. 1933), daughter of Henry William Hoskyns of North Perrott Manor, Crewkerne, Somerset. They had two daughters: Dorothy, born at Poona in 1879, and Margaret Griselda, born in London in 1884. He succeeded as fourth baronet on 18 September 1882.<br>
<br>Wedderburn filled increasingly responsible revenue and judicial positions in Bombay district administration. Coming from a liberal background, he was greatly influenced by peasant disturbances in 1875 against the increasingly powerful village moneylenders. Between 1878 and 1883 he publicly criticized the government's high rates of land assessments and the destruction of traditional village institutions, and formulated a model project of co-operative agricultural banks to provide credit to cultivators at reasonable interest rates. This innovative proposal won official endorsement in India, but was blocked by the India Office in London, and another twenty years passed before the government experimented with agricultural credit. Wedderburn also supported the reform initiatives of the viceroy, Lord Ripon, designed to remove racial barriers against Indian judges and to develop local self-government throughout India. He was involved with Indian leaders in establishing the Bombay Presidency Association in 1885, and attended that year's inaugural session of the Indian National Congress as an observer. His open identification with Indian political aspirations was disapproved of by senior officials and in 1885 he was denied a prestigious judgeship of the Bombay high court. Feeling unfairly treated he took early retirement in 1887.<br>
<br>Freed from bureaucratic office, Wedderburn committed the rest of his life to promoting political reform for India. A close connection with Bombay's influential Congress leaders and with the general secretary, Allan O. Hume, resulted in his election as president of the 1889 session in Bombay. That session, at which Liberal MP Charles Bradlaugh was a special visitor, endorsed a forward-looking scheme of representative government. In 1890 Wedderburn became chairman of the newly created British committee of the Indian National Congress, which attempted by various means, including the publication of the journal <span class="italic">India</span>, to mobilize support in the metropolis for that country's political advancement. His disinterested commitment to India influenced his decision to run for parliament in 1892, an enterprise in which he succeeded through a Banffshire by-election in 1893. Along with fellow Liberal Dadabhai Naoroji, a Bombay Congressman and MP for Finsbury Park (1892&#150;5), Wedderburn organized an Indian parliamentary committee, a loose collection of India sympathizers which at its peak had a nominal membership of over 150. It played a hand in influencing the government to establish the Welby commission to inquire into the apportionment of costs between the British and Indian governments for military and civil expenditure incurred by the secretary of state for India. The commission, on which Wedderburn and Naoroji constituted a pro-India minority, resulted in some readjustments in India's favour. Indian committee activists also caught the Liberal government off guard by winning a parliamentary vote to introduce simultaneous public service examinations in India, and won a last-minute pledge from the same ministry not to retain the north-west frontier outpost of Chitral: but neither of these decisions was implemented. As an activist against the South African War, Wedderburn anticipated defeat in the 1900 election and did not stand.<br>
<br>Wedderburn was disheartened by this era of imperialist ascendancy, but the Liberal re-election of 1905 and the retirement of Curzon as viceroy filled him with renewed hope for India. He pressured Lord Morley, the Indian secretary of state, to be more genuinely reformist, and developed a close relationship with G. K. Gokhale, the most dedicated leader of the constitutionalist wing of Congress. In 1910 he risked his health to return to India, as Congress president, and appealed for Hindu&#150;Muslim co-operation and for reconciliation between Congress constitutionalists and militants. He was saddened by the death in 1912 of his more outspoken Indian co-worker Hume, and the following year published his biography, <span class="italic">Allan Octavian Hume, C. B., &#145;Father of the Indian National Congress&#146;</span>. Later he utilized India's heavy commitment in the First World War to reinforce the case for a substantial measure of self-government. Wedderburn died at his home, Meredith, Gloucestershire, on 25 January 1918, active to the end in supporting India's political aspirations and in trying to transform an empire into a commonwealth.<br>
