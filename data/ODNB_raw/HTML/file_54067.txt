<span class="headword">McLagan,  James</span>  (1728&#150;1805), <span class="occ">folklorist</span>, was born at Ballechin, in Strathtay, Perthshire, in 1728. The birth or baptism of James, son of Donald McClagon, is recorded in the parish of Moulin, Perthshire, on 8 September 1728. He matriculated at the University of St Andrews in the 1750/51 session, and was ordained by the presbytery of Dunkeld in 1760. His first charge was the chapel of ease in Amulree, Perthshire. In 1764 he was appointed chaplain to the 42nd regiment (the Black Watch), which had originally been raised at Aberfeldy, Perthshire. He continued as chaplain until 1788; he served in the Isle of Man and was involved in the American War of Independence. The freedom of Glasgow was conferred on him in 1776. In 1788 he was admitted to the charge of Blair Atholl and Strowan, Perthshire, which he held until his death. In 1784 he married Catherine Stuart, daughter of James Stuart, the minister of Killin, who translated the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> into Gaelic (1767). She was half her husband's age in 1784, and they had a family of four sons and three daughters. Their eldest son, James, became professor of divinity at King's College, Aberdeen.<br>
<br>McLagan's great achievement was the collecting of Gaelic poems and songs, and Perthshire became the focus of this work. When he was interviewed in 1800 by John Leyden, the author of <span class="italic">Journal of a Tour in the Highlands and Western Islands of Scotland</span> (pp. 258&#150;61), McLagan told him that he had made collections of Ossianic ballads while still at school and college. This suggests that his interest in Gaelic verse started before 1750, and may have been in part a reaction to the failure of the Jacobite rising of 1745, which had strong nationalist implications for some highlanders, including James Macpherson, the Ossianic poet. McLagan corresponded with Macpherson in 1760 and 1761, Macpherson having been told that McLagan had a good collection of the kind of ballads in which he was interested; in 1800 McLagan recalled that he had given Macpherson &#145;about thirteen poems&#146;. In 1760&#150;63 Macpherson published his supposed translations of ancient Gaelic heroic balladry.<br>
<br>McLagan was one of a group of men, mainly from Perthshire and Argyll, who made a sustained effort to record Gaelic poetry and song in the second half of the eighteenth century. Part of this effort was encouraged by the publicity and opposition engendered by Macpherson's publication. It is clear, however, that there was an earlier positive drive in addition to the post-1760 reactive one. Adam Ferguson, McLagan's predecessor as chaplain to the Black Watch, and later professor of philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, had shown some interest in Gaelic material, and put Macpherson in touch with Edinburgh friends who shared this interest. Jerome Stone collected ballads in the early 1750s; Donald MacNicol made a large collection of Gaelic poetry. Other close contemporaries, such as Joseph Macintyre from Glenorchy, Archibald MacArthur from Glenlyon, and John Stuart from Killin (McLagan's brother-in-law), were also involved in Gaelic collection and writing, and sometimes collaborated with McLagan in such work.<br>
<br>McLagan maintained his interest in collecting Gaelic verse throughout his life. Just over a century after his death his collection, which had been preserved by his descendants, was given to Glasgow University Library. The surviving materials consist of 1650 pages, comprising some 630 separate items, largely anonymous and ascribed verse, with a small number of prose items. There are occasional Latin items, a small number of non-Gaelic verse items, a few prose items, genealogies, prayers, and so on. In many instances these manuscripts contain the earliest, or the only, examples of particular poems or songs, and they provide a highly valuable source. McLagan's material was drawn partly from indigenous Perthshire sources, including some manuscripts which are older than 1750. He also used his contacts, both ministerial and military, to acquire versions of poems and songs from other parts of Gaelic Scotland, such as Argyll with its islands, Ross-shire, Inverness-shire, Skye and the outer isles, and districts in Aberdeenshire and elsewhere that were still Gaelic-speaking in his time. Although this collection of manuscripts has been used by various editors over the years, at the end of the twentieth century much of it still remained to be fully exploited.<br>
<br>Publication of secular Gaelic writing may be said to have begun as late as 1751, with the appearance of Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair's poems, and no doubt this was an additional stimulus for eighteenth-century collectors and writers. It is likely that McLagan provided some material for the book <span class="italic">Clan Feuds and Songs</span>, published by John Gillies in 1780, and he was closely involved with the same publisher's book of 1786, known generally as the <span class="italic">Gillies Collection</span>, though Gillies himself had little or no Gaelic expertise. In 1792 an article by McLagan on the parish of Blair Atholl and Strowan appeared in the <span class="italic">Statistical Account</span>, volume 2, in which he voiced warnings about the perceptible weakening of Gaelic in that area. It is indeed fortunate that he personally preserved so much of the verse tradition while it was still available. McLagan died at Blair Atholl on 3 May 1805.<br>
