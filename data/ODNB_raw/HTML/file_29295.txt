<span class="headword">Whitehurst,  John</span>  (1713&#150;1788), <span class="occ">maker of clocks and scientific instruments, and geologist</span>, was born on 10 April 1713 at Congleton, Cheshire, the eldest child of John Whitehurst (<i>b</i>. 1687), maker of watches and clocks, and his wife, Mary. He had an enquiring mind and encouraged by his father he developed an early interest in local geology. After a rudimentary education he was apprenticed to his father. Upon completing his apprenticeship he travelled to Ireland to extend his knowledge but found it unsatisfactory for one determined to become eminent in his business, so returned to England and settled in Derby, possibly as early as 1735. Initially Whitehurst was unable to trade in the town as he was not a freeman, but following the construction and donation of a turret clock for the new guildhall he was made a burgess in 1737. By 1745 he was sufficiently well established to marry, on 9 January, Elizabeth, the elder daughter of the Revd George Gretton and his wife, Mary, and she was able to assist her husband by correcting his writing. Their only child died at birth.<br>
<br>At his premises at 24 Irongate, Whitehurst established a sound reputation as a clockmaker with a series of well-made but unremarkable domestic clocks and more innovative turret clocks. Some of his turret clocks were fitted with deadbeat escapements and temperature-compensated pendulums (of the Ellicott type) which were unusual features on turret clocks of that period. The temperature compensation depended on the differential expansion of different metals with changes in temperature and it was probably to obtain this information that Whitehurst constructed a pyrometer in 1749. By 1758 he had met and become a member of the influential group of philosophers and entrepreneurs who formed the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/59220', "Lunar Society of Birmingham")</script>, to their mutual benefit. Whitehurst supplied one of the members, Matthew Boulton, with clock movements, which were mounted in Boulton's ormolu cases. In 1771 he supplied Boulton with two more elaborate astronomical clocks, the dials of which had been designed by James Ferguson (1710&#150;1776) whom Whitehurst had met when he was lecturing in Derby. He also made a tidal clock for another friend and member of the Lunar Society, Benjamin Franklin.<br>
<br>Whitehurst was consulted widely on mechanical and hydraulic problems and in 1772 he installed what appears to be the first hydraulic ram for raising water, at Oulton Park in Cheshire. His consultancies involved much travelling which enabled him to extend his geological studies over a wider area, partly with a view to finding useful minerals but also to satisfy his curiosity about the formation of the earth. By this time Whitehurst had extended his range of products to include scientific instruments, many of which evolved from those which he originally made to carry out his own experiments. He is known particularly for his barometers, and for scales and weights. Whitehurst supplied assay balances and weights for Matthew Boulton's laboratory at Soho and when the latter was finally successful in his parliamentary petition for the establishment of an assay office in Birmingham the balances and weights are believed to have been supplied by Whitehurst. This may have been one of the factors which influenced the duke of Newcastle to secure Whitehurst's appointment in the following year to the newly established office of stamper of money weights to the mint. The duke was already conversant with Whitehurst's other work as he had constructed two turret clocks and a complete plumbing and heating system for the duke's seat at Clumber Park. As the stamper of money weights Whitehurst received a salary of &pound;200 per annum with an additional &pound;20 for the expenses of an office, which he established at his friend Ferguson's house in 4 Bolt Court, off Fleet Street in London.<br>
<br>Initially Whitehurst divided his time between Derby and London but by 1779 he was almost permanently resident in the capital, occupying the house of the deceased Ferguson. From that time his business in Derby was run by his wife's cousin, James Wright, and then by his nephew John, the son of his brother James. In 1778 he published the results of his geological researches in <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Original State and Formation of the Earth</span>, although the work had been substantially completed some years earlier. This book led to his election to the Royal Society in the following year. The importance of this work lies in the &#145;Appendix on the strata in Derbyshire&#146; rather than his fanciful speculation on the formation of the earth; in the appendix he identifies the volcanic origin of the basalts and also hints at the orderly sequence of strata, one of the great geological generalizations. Both topics are alluded to in the portrait which Wright of Derby painted four years later. William Hutton met him in 1785 and in his <span class="italic">History of Derby</span> (1791) described Whitehurst as &#145;near six feet high, straight, thin, and wore his own dark-grey bushy hair; he was plain in his dress, and had much the appearance of a respectable farmer&#146;  (W. Hutton, 294).<br>
<br>In addition to attending the meetings of the Royal Society, Whitehurst played an active part in the scientific life of London which centred on the taverns and coffee houses. In particular he attended the meetings convened by Smeaton at the Queen's Head tavern which were the precursor to the Institution of Civil Engineers. In 1774 when the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce offered an award for the best solution to the problem of producing a natural standard of length (one which depended on a law of nature) Whitehurst was one of the judges. The award was given for an ingenious but flawed method of measuring the effective length of a pendulum beating seconds. When the contestant failed to develop his idea Whitehurst proceeded to do so, disregarding the advice of William Nicholson who in his <span class="italic">Journal of Natural Philosophy</span> later described him as &#145;an ingenious mechanic and worthy man but possessed of very little science&#146;  (Nicholson, 31). Whitehurst published his results in 1787 as <span class="italic">An Attempt towards Obtaining Invariable Measures of Length</span>. Whitehurst was also involved in the ventilation of the wards at St Thomas's Hospital about 1784 and his <span class="italic">Observations on the Ventilation of Rooms on the Construction of Chimneys and on Garden Stoves</span> was published posthumously in 1794.<br>
<br>Whitehurst's wife died in 1784 and Whitehurst himself died at 4 Bolt Court on 18 February 1788, possibly from cancer of the colon. He was interred seven days later at St Andrew's burial-ground, Gray's Inn Lane, London. In his will he left his premises at Derby to his nephew John, who was succeeded in turn by his son John. The Whitehurst business ceased with the latter's death in 1855, although it continues in spirit as John Smith &amp; Son, a firm formed by Whitehurst apprentices.<br>
