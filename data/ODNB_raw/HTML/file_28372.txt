<span class="headword">Waddington,  Edward</span>  (1670/71&#150;1731), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was born in London. He was a scholar of Eton College, and was admitted to King's College, Cambridge, in 1687. He was a fellow at King's from 1691, and proceeded BA in 1692, MA in 1695, and DD in 1710. He was a fellow of Eton from 1720, and was, by all accounts, a very generous benefactor, bequeathing his entire library (valued at &pound;2000) to the college at his death. He was presented by the crown to the living of Wexham, near Eton, in Buckinghamshire, in 1702, and was the incumbent of All-Hallows-the-Great, Thames Street, London, from 1712 to 1726. He became chaplain to Henry Compton, the bishop of London, and then, in 1717, to George I. In 1724 he succeeded Thomas Bowers as bishop of Chichester, a position he held until his death. He is said to have found the bishop's palace in very poor condition, and set about renovating it at his own cost. Waddington married Frances, daughter of Jonathan Newey of Worcestershire, who predeceased him in 1728; they had no children.<br>
<br>Waddington seems to have walked a very narrow path between low- and high-churchman. He was a zealous protestant, like his patron, Bishop Compton, and was firmly committed to the Hanoverians as well as to the duke of Newcastle's whig interest in Sussex. There is an anecdote told about him that he was such a partisan of the Hanoverians that, when George II acceded to the throne, Waddington provided the gunpowder for the celebrations in Chichester at his own expense and had a kite flown from the spire of the cathedral. He seems, in addition, to have created a stir in Chichester Cathedral with his whig determination to wrestle the tory dean and chapter into submission  (Curtis, 13&#150;16). But he also had the religious sensibilities of a high-churchman. In a sermon preached in the House of Lords on 30 January 1729 he decried the regicide of the martyr Charles I (without, it should be added, overstressing the king's piety or prerogative), and blamed puritan religion because its &#145;enthusiasm&#146; (ungoverned religious zeal) had so carried away the murderers and warped their sensibilities that they were able to commit the heinous crime. This was an indictment, in his mind, against dissent, because dissenters were all subject to &#145;enthusiasm&#146;. Further, he vigorously advocated punishing deists and freethinkers, and objected when anyone maintained that they should be tolerated or treated humanely. Toleration was not one of Waddington's virtues. A number of his sermons were published between 1718 and 1729. He died in Chichester on 7 September 1731 and was buried in Chichester Cathedral.<br>
