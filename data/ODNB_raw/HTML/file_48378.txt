<span class="headword">Adie,  Alexander James</span>  (1775&#150;1858), <span class="occ">maker of scientific instruments</span>, was born on 7 January 1775, and baptized at Greyfriars parish church, Edinburgh, the posthumous second son of John Adie and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Miller. His father was a printer, one of the proprietors of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Evening Courant</span>, and was said to have contributed articles to the <span class="italic">Scots Magazine</span>. He died about three months before Alexander was born, and although his widow remarried she too died shortly thereafter, and the boy was adopted by his maternal uncle, John Miller (1746&#150;1815), with whom he lived until Miller's death.<br>
<br>At the age of twelve Adie was apprenticed to a stocking maker, but on the death a short time later of his elder brother, John, he was apprenticed as his replacement to their uncle, an optician. In later life, he regretted the curtailed education of his youth, and attended lectures and sought out private tuition. He became a partner with his uncle from 1803, and continued to trade under the name Miller and Adie until 1822, when the firm became Alexander Adie. On 22 October 1804 he married Marion Ritchie, with whom he had four sons and seven daughters. Three of his sons became successful scientific instrument makers: the eldest, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48379/', "John Adie (1805&#150;1857)")</script>, subsequently went into partnership with his father; the third, Richard (1810&#150;1881), started a business in Liverpool; and the youngest, Patrick (1821&#150;1886), began one in London.<br>
<br>Although the firm's products were aimed at satisfying the expanding demand for surveying instruments, both the University of St Andrews and Anderson's Institution of Glasgow are known to have purchased Adie's demonstration apparatus for their natural philosophy classrooms. His mechanical skills soon attracted the attention of a number of inventive patrons, among whom was the Edinburgh-based natural philosopher, David Brewster (1781&#150;1868), who commissioned a number of newly designed instruments from Adie for his research work in optics. As a scientific journalist and editor, Brewster publicized Adie's skills by promoting his own work, particularly in connection with his experiments with jewel lenses for microscope optics during the 1820s. Another early patron was Sir James Hall (1761&#150;1832) of Dunglass, who undertook a series of experiments between 1798 and 1805 which ultimately confirmed James Hutton's (1726&#150;1797) argument for the igneous origin of basalt and other types of rock. Adie also manufactured a series of differential thermometers used in the pioneering work on the nature of heat by Sir John Leslie (1766&#150;1832), professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh; these were advertised in Leslie's publications between 1808 and 1820. A further patron was the civil engineer Robert Stevenson (1772&#150;1850), whose improvements in lighthouse optics called upon Adie's practical mechanical skills. The construction of an improved form of the pantograph, called the eidograph, was produced by Adie in 1821 for its designer, William Wallace, professor of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Adie was interested in the science of meteorology from an early date, and began a register with barometer, thermometer, and wind and rain gauges, all constructed by himself. His records ran from 1795 to 1805, and again between 1821 and 1850, and were later used in discussion by James David Forbes (1809&#150;1868), professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, and also a patron of Adie during the 1830s. Adie's interest in weather led him to design, and subsequently patent, in December 1818, his sympiesometer or &#145;new air barometer&#146;. This instrument used oil as its hydrostatic fluid, together with a column of gas. It was particularly useful as a marine barometer, as its sensitivity provided early warning of weather changes at sea, and its construction meant that it was less likely to break in storms. Until the invention of the aneroid barometer in 1861 the sympiesometer appears to have sold in reasonable numbers.<br>
<br>An active member of the Wernerian Natural History Society, Adie was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1819 and was a founder member of Brewster's Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts in Scotland (later the Royal Scottish Society of Arts), instituted in 1821. In the same year, Brewster introduced Adie to the young J. D. Forbes, whose interests in geology and the nature of heat led to a project funded by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to investigate heat flow in soil and bedrock. Three sites around Edinburgh were chosen, for which Adie constructed four remarkable thermometers, of 3, 6, 12, and 24 ft in length, during 1836&#150;7. This appears to have been his final special commission.<br>
<br>Alexander's eldest son, John, joined him in the workshop about 1826. The business traded as Adie &amp; Son from 1835 until 1881, long after both had died. It is not known when Alexander ceased work altogether, but from about 1840 he suffered poor health. He spent much of his retirement experimenting with horticulture. John committed suicide in early 1857, and by that time Adie was becoming senile. After a severe illness followed by a bad cold, he died at his home, Canaan Cottage, Newington, Edinburgh, on 4 December 1858, aged eighty-three. He was buried at Greyfriars churchyard.<br>
