<span class="headword">Pound,  James</span>  (1669&#150;1724), <span class="occ">astronomer</span>, was baptized on 2 March 1669 at Bishop's Canning, Wiltshire, the son of James Pound and his wife, Mary. He matriculated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, on 16 March 1687, graduated BA from Hart Hall on 27 February 1694 and MA from Gloucester Hall in the same year, and obtained a medical diploma and MB on 21 October 1697. He practised medicine only briefly, but, perhaps in consequence, enjoyed the courtesy title of Dr Pound; he took holy orders and entered the service of the East India Company as chaplain to the merchants of Fort George, Madras. From India he was sent to Chushan Dao, an island south of Shanghai, where he arrived in 1700.<br>
<br>During his voyages Pound made what simple astronomical observations he could and noted the changing magnetic variation. He corresponded with John Flamsteed, the astronomer royal, who hoped that Pound would be able to provide observations of the southern stars, and for this purpose oversaw the construction of a fine 3 foot quadrant in the workshops of Thomas Tuttle. It was shipped to Pound in 1700, but its arrival was delayed by the vagaries of weather, and it reached him, sadly corroded, only in 1704.<br>
<br>In 1702 Pound joined a group of merchants who built a fort and settlement on Pulo Condore, one of a group of islands now known as Con Son, off the Mekong delta. He possessed an 18 inch quadrant and a clock, and was able to send observations to Flamsteed as well as specimens of plants and animals to Dr Charlett of Oxford University. But on 3 March 1705 the native troops attacked the settlement, setting fire to the buildings. Pound was one of eleven Europeans who escaped, having lost all their possessions, and fled the island in the sloop <i>Rose</i>, making for Malacca and eventually Batavia. He reached England in July 1706. The year after his return Pound was presented to the rectory of Wanstead, Essex. When Flamsteed died in 1720 he vacated it, and Lord Chancellor Parker presented him to Flamsteed's former living of Burstow, Surrey. He married on 14 February 1710 Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1715), the widow of Edward Farmer. Their firstborn son died at birth; a daughter, Sarah, died unmarried at Greenwich on 19 October 1747.<br>
<br>Pound had been elected fellow of the Royal Society on 20 December 1699, so that his admission was delayed until 30 July 1713, by which time he possessed a 15 foot telescope and had sufficient reputation as an astronomer to be invited on to the board of visitors for the Royal Greenwich Observatory. Edmond Halley presented Pound's observations of the total solar eclipse of 3 May 1715 to the Royal Society, the first of three reports from Pound to be published in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> that year; the others dealt with the occultation of a star by Jupiter and an eclipse of the moon on 30 October. In 1716 and 1717 he made various planetary observations. In 1717 the Royal Society lent Pound the 123 foot focal length lens which Huygens had made; he mounted this in Wanstead Park as the objective of an aerial telescope (one with no tube), supporting it on the maypole lately removed from the Strand, in Westminster, and procured for the purpose by Isaac Newton. Such ungainly apparatus was inconvenient to use, but Pound managed to master it to the extent that his observations of the five known satellites of Saturn enabled Halley to correct his own calculations. Newton employed Pound's micrometrical measurements of Jupiter's disc, of Saturn's disc and ring, and of the elongations of their satellites, in the third edition of his <span class="italic">Principia</span> (1726), and obtained from him data for correcting the places of the comet of 1680. Pound recorded two payments of 50 guineas from Newton in 1719 and 1720 for these or other services. The French astronomer Laplace also employed Pound's observations of Jupiter's satellites in determining the planet's mass, and Pound himself compiled in 1719 a set of tables for the first satellite, introducing an equation for the transmission of light.<br>
<br>Pound's second marriage, in October 1722, was to Elizabeth (1673&#150;1740), the daughter of Matthew Wymondesold; she possessed her own estate of &pound;10,000, while her brother, Matthew Wymondesold, was a successful speculator in South Sea stock and the proprietor of the Wanstead estate. There were no children of this marriage. Pound was responsible for encouraging a love of astronomy in his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3187/', "James Bradley (bap. 1692, d. 1762)")</script>. He had paid for Bradley's education, and nursed him through smallpox; many of their observations were made together at Wanstead, among them those of the opposition of Mars in 1719 and of the transit of Mercury on 29 October 1723. Their measurement of gamma Virginis in 1718, the first made of the components of a double star, was part of their search for solar parallax; Pound may have aided in planning the observations of gamma Draconis which led Bradley to his discovery of the aberration of light. He was a frequent visitor of Samuel Molyneux (1689&#150;1728), promoter of reflecting telescopes, at Kew. He was commissioned by the Royal Society in July 1723 to test John Hadley's reflecting telescope, and reported favourably on its performance. Pound died at Wanstead on 16 November 1724. His widow resided with Bradley at Oxford from 1732 to 1737; she died on 10 September 1740 and was buried at Wanstead.<br>
