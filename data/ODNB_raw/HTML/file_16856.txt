<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1733, <em>d.</em> 1764), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, was baptized on 7 May 1733 at St John, Smith Square, Westminster, London, the son of Pierson Lloyd DD (1704&#150;1781) and his wife, Anne, daughter of the Revd John Maximilian De L'Angle, rector of Croughton, Northamptonshire. Pierson Lloyd, son of a Westminster victualler, was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. On leaving Cambridge in 1726 he became an usher at Westminster School; in 1749 he was appointed under-master. He retired with a Lambeth DD in 1771. Forty-five years of schoolmastering did not prevent him from pursuing a successful career in the church. Ordained priest in 1730, he succeeded his father-in-law as rector of Croughton (1732&#150;79), and held the first part of the rectory of Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire, from 1733 until his death. He published a volume of sermons in 1765. Long-standing connections with the archdiocese of York led to his appointment as prebendary in 1777 and chancellor in 1780.<br>
<br>His son Robert was a Westminster schoolboy of brilliant promise: king's scholar, captain of the school in 1750, elected head to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1751; his friend George Colman (1732&#150;1794) was elected head of those proceeding to Christ Church, Oxford, in the same year. Despite a passion for literature rather than the mathematics and natural philosophy then dominant at Cambridge, Lloyd negotiated his years in college successfully, taking his BA in 1755 (MA, 1758). He remained in Cambridge for two years. His father would have urged Robert to enter the church, and to do so by winning a college fellowship. But Robert's real interest was poetry; as early as 1754 his Westminster friend William Cowper had hailed him as<blockquote>
<div>sole heir, and single,<br>
</div>
<div>Of dear Mat Prior's easy jingle.<br>
</div> (&#145;Epistle to Robert Lloyd&#146;)</blockquote>Lloyd returned to London in 1757. His father then secured for him an appointment as usher at Westminster School. Teaching the rudiments of Latin verse to schoolboys was repugnant to him, however, and in 1760 he gave it up in order to devote himself to writing. He thus cut himself off successively from the two professions in which his father could assist him.<br>
<br>Lloyd's fortunes as a literary man were bound up with those of his friend Colman. While still at Oxford, Colman had joined with a slightly older Westminster contemporary, Bonnell Thornton (1724&#150;1768), in conducting a successful essay periodical, <span class="italic">The Connoisseur</span> (weekly; 31 January 1754&#150;30 September 1756); five numbers contain poems by Lloyd (67, 72, 90, 125, 135). When all three had returned to London in the later 1750s they formed the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/71305', "Nonsense Club")</script>, an association of seven old Westminsters. The other members were William Cowper, James Bensley, and probably Chase Price; the identity of the seventh is uncertain. The club's interests were literary; its characteristic activity was burlesque. Two examples survive. Lloyd and Colman collaborated on parodies of the learned Pindaric odes of Thomas Gray (1757) and the vapid efforts of William Mason (1756). In 1760, to draw attention to their fledgeling careers, they retrieved these burlesques and published them anonymously in a quarto entitled <span class="italic">Two Odes</span>.<br>
<br>The friends' ambition was to become associated with David Garrick and write regularly for Drury Lane. While Colman began to write plays, Lloyd published a poetical epistle, <span class="italic">The Actor</span> (1760), nominally addressed to Thornton, but in reality an extended panegyric of Garrick as exemplar nonpareil of the actor's art. The poem was popular, reaching a fourth edition in 1764. Its graceful pentameter couplets express the mid-century fascination with theatrical performance, and particularly with Garrick's powers in both tragedy and comedy. Garrick's ability to make the audience feel with him leads Lloyd to mock those conventions of the theatre intended to act directly on the spectators, but he recognizes that the price a great actor pays for his intensity is impermanence; unlike the poet, he takes his art to the grave. George II died on 25 October 1760, and to mark the reopening of the theatres on 17 November Garrick substituted for the usual afterpiece a musical ode, <span class="italic">The Tears and Triumphs of Parnassus</span>, written by Lloyd. Apollo and the muses lament the death of the old king and then elegantly rejoice in the accession of George III. Colman's first play, <span class="italic">Polly Honeycomb</span>, was produced in December 1760; his second, <span class="italic">The Jealous Wife</span>, on 12 February 1761, with a prologue by Lloyd, spoken by Garrick. So far, Lloyd and Colman were establishing themselves satisfactorily in the theatre.<br>
<br>Lloyd next sought regular literary employment. In April 1761 he took charge of the poetry section of <span class="italic">The Library, or, Moral and Critical Magazine</span>, a periodical edited by Andrew Kippis. He was assisted by his old Westminster friend Charles Churchill, who was now living in London. Kippis was on the staff of the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, and it was probably through him that Lloyd became poetry reviewer for the <span class="italic">Monthly</span>. His first assignment, in May 1761, was to review Churchill's <span class="italic">Apology. Addressed to the Critical Reviewers</span> (24.340&#150;42). Churchill had achieved a huge success in March with <span class="italic">The Rosciad</span>, which combined high praise of Garrick with severe personal attacks on Garrick's rivals and enemies. A crucial role in the narrative is played by a young hero identified as Lloyd (191&#150;232). Churchill was unknown as a writer, <span class="italic">The Rosciad</span> was published anonymously, and the <span class="italic">Critical Review</span> surmised that the poem had been written by some combination of Colman, Thornton, and Lloyd. Colman and Lloyd issued denials. Churchill published a second edition with his name, and scarified the <span class="italic">Critical's</span> reviewer in the <span class="italic">Apology</span>. In his review Lloyd admired Churchill's genius for poetry, but regretted Churchill's penchant for satire and personal attacks. In two poems published in July, <span class="italic">Genius, Envy, and Time</span>, addressed to Hogarth, and <span class="italic">An Epistle to C. Churchill</span>, Lloyd defended his friend and the idea of genius unfettered by conventional restrictions with which Churchill justified his satire.<br>
<br>Lloyd's employment by the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> lasted only six months. In the autumn he wrote another lyrical afterpiece for Drury Lane: <span class="italic">Arcadia, or, The Shepherd's Wedding</span>, performed on 27 October 1761 in compliment to the king and queen on their nuptials. It received six further performances over the next month. It was to be his last theatrical venture for three years. In November 1761 Churchill published <span class="italic">Night</span>, an epistle addressed to Lloyd, a spirited defence of their shared devotion to late hours, imprudence, and unconventional opinions. It marks a shift of emphasis in Lloyd's literary and personal alliances, Colman and the theatre giving way to Churchill and dissipation.<br>
<br>Churchill, who had not long since been in such financial straits that Pierson Lloyd had intervened to broker a composition with his creditors, was now showing that poetry could be profitable. Lloyd, seeking to realize some money from his writing as well as to establish a reputation, prepared a collected edition of his poems which appeared in 1762 as <span class="italic">Poems. By Robert Lloyd, A. M.</span> He assembled a splendid list of subscribers, including fifty peers, two bishops, many fellows of Oxford and Cambridge colleges, and numerous old Westminsters, as well as Garrick, Hogarth, Johnson, Macpherson, Reynolds, Thomas Sheridan, Sterne, and the Warton brothers. His father's assistance is evident in the presence of the archbishop of York and a large number of names associated with York and the archdiocese. After the &#145;Author's apology&#146;, the poems are arranged chronologically, except that the Latin poems are grouped at the end. The Latin poems include exercises and ceremonial pieces from the Cambridge years, and a virtuoso rendering of Gray's <span class="italic">Elegy</span>. The collection offers pleasant reading, for Lloyd had a real gift for elegant verse, but as the gathering of a decade's output it underlines the slenderness of his talent and his debilitating preoccupation with his status as a poet. As Thomas Lockwood has written, he projects a &#145;feeling of contempt for the world in which he finds himself, characteristically intermingled with a certain determined sense of his own inferiority&#146;  (Lockwood, 63).<br>
<br>Kippis's <span class="italic">The Library</span> ceased publication in May 1762. In September Lloyd was engaged as founder editor of a new periodical, the <span class="italic">St James's Magazine</span>, intended to repeat the success with which Garrick, Colman, Thornton, and others had launched a newspaper, the <span class="italic">St James's Chronicle</span>, the year before. No doubt his friends saw this as a way of assuring him an income. For his part, Lloyd hoped, not entirely in vain, that his literary friends would supply him with contributions. The drudgery of editorship wore him down, however, proving as inimical to poetry as schoolmastering had been. He undertook a number of anonymous translations: the first book of Voltaire's <span class="italic">Henriade</span> for the edition by Smollett and Francklin (1762); Klopstock's <span class="italic">The Death of Adam</span> (1763); Marmontel's <span class="italic">Moral Tales</span> (3 vols., 1764&#150;6, the third probably by his associate on the <span class="italic">St James's Magazine</span> Charles Dennis).<br>
<br>By 1762 Churchill was increasingly associated with John Wilkes. The appearance of Lloyd's &#145;The Poetry Professors&#146; in Wilkes's <span class="italic">North Briton</span> (October&#150;November 1762) and the mildly obscene verse tale <span class="italic">The New-River Head</span> dedicated to Wilkes (1763) placed him also firmly in Wilkes's circle. There was as yet no breach with older friends. When James Boswell called on Thornton on 24 May 1763, he met there Wilkes, Churchill, and Lloyd, &#145;so that I was just got into the middle of the London Geniuses&#146;  (<span class="italic">Boswell's London Journal</span>, 266). Boswell subsequently wrote verses on Lloyd's nose as sign of his intemperance.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">St James's Magazine</span> was not profitable, and in March 1764 Lloyd passed the editorship to William Kenrick. In April he was arrested for debt, and confined to the Fleet prison. Churchill gave him 1 guinea a week and paid for a maidservant while he was imprisoned, but other friends proved less helpful, and there was a complete breach with Thornton. Wilkes was now a fugitive in France, and political differences may have helped to isolate Lloyd. Churchill, on a visit to France to see Wilkes, died unexpectedly on 4 November 1764. The tale of Lloyd's taking to his bed with the words &#145;I shall follow poor Charles&#146;, never to rise again, is a sentimental misrepresentation. Rather, his prospects were improving. On 20 November he wrote to Wilkes about his editing of the second volume of Churchill's collected poems. On 28 November his comic opera <span class="italic">The Capricious Lovers</span> was produced at Drury Lane with considerable success; it ran for nine nights, and Lloyd's text was highly praised in newspaper reviews. The profits of the third, sixth, and ninth nights went to the composer George Rush, but Lloyd's name was once again before the public. The play was published on 1 December with a dedication to Colman, who had arranged for its performance. Then, on 15 December 1764, Lloyd died of a fever in the Fleet prison. He was buried in St Bride's churchyard on 19 December.<br>
