<span class="headword">Pike,  Samuel</span>  (1717?&#150;1773), <span class="occ">Sandemanian minister</span>, was probably born at Romsey, Hampshire. He was educated for the Independent ministry, receiving his general training from John Eames of the academy in Tenter Alley, Moorfields, which was supported by the Congregational Fund board, and his theology from John Hubbard at the Independent academy, Stepney. His first ministry was at Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, about 1740. He moved in 1747 to succeed John Hill (1711&#150;1746) as pastor at the Three Cranes Meeting-House in Fruiterers' Alley, Thames Street, London.<br>
<br>Early in his London ministry Pike established, at his house in Hoxton Square, an academy for training students for the ministry. He adopted the principles of the biblical critic John Hutchinson, and defended them in a laborious work entitled <span class="italic">Philosophia sacra, or, The Principles of Natural Philosophy Extracted from Divine Revelation</span> (1753). In 1754 he succeeded Zephaniah Marryat (1684?&#150;1754) as one of the Tuesday lecturers at Pinners' Hall. About the same time he joined Samuel Hayward (1718&#150;1757), Independent minister at Silver Street, Wood Street, Cheapside, in a Sunday-evening lecture, dealing with &#145;cases of conscience&#146;, at Little St Helen's, Bishopsgate. He published <span class="italic">A Form of Sound Words, or, &hellip; Body of Divinity</span> (1755), which was solidly Calvinist and was criticized by Caleb Fleming, the religious controversialist.<br>
<br>In 1757 Pike became acquainted with the views of Robert Sandeman, the son-in-law and follower of John Glas. Sandeman had published in 1757 a series of <span class="italic">Letters</span> dealing with the <span class="italic">Dialogues between Theron and Aspasio</span> (1755) by James Hervey. Sandeman's <span class="italic">Letters</span> were admired by members of Pike's church; and Pike, on reading them, began on 17 January 1758 a correspondence with Sandeman, then in Edinburgh. He communicated their correspondence to his congregation, a number of whom, with Pike himself, gradually came to adopt Sandeman's views, particularly on the question of popular preachers; others showed such dissatisfaction that Pike ceased the correspondence, suppressing his fourth letter, but the others were published in 1758.<br>
<br>Pike began, none the less, to adopt Glassite or Sandemanian usages in his church, including a weekly communion. This led to rumours in August 1758 of his unsoundness; his discourses at Pinners' Hall gave offence, and he was excluded from the lectureship in 1759 by forty-four votes to one; the Congregational minister Dr John Conder was chosen to succeed him on 3 October. In his own church Pike was hotly opposed by William Fuller and Thomas Uffington. A church meeting on 9 October 1759 came to no conclusion; church meetings on 13 January and 21 April 1760 were equally divided, but Pike's casting vote carried the exclusion of the malcontents, who formed a new church under Joseph Barber. Disputes then arose about possession of church property, and a lawsuit was begun in 1761 by Pike for recovery of an endowment of &pound;12 a year.<br>
<br>At length Pike resigned his charge on 14 December 1765, left the Independents, and became a member of the Sandemanian church in Bull-and-Mouth Street, St Martin's-le-Grand. In 1765 he published anonymously <span class="italic">A Plain Account of the Practices Observed by the Church in St Martin's-Le-Grand</span>. This pamphlet is the basis for many subsequent accounts of Sandemanian practice&#151;the last being published in Edinburgh in 1905. The London board of Congregational ministers excluded him in March 1766 on the grounds that he was not a proper person to be continued on the list. Pike wrote about his change of sentiments in a letter to Revd John Smart of Cerne Abbas in May of the same year. He was chosen elder of his St Martin's congregation in 1766, and ministered with great acceptance.<br>
<br>Pike moved in 1771 to become minister to a Sandemanian congregation at Trowbridge, Wiltshire. He was a man of character and ability and considerable biblical scholarship, as testified by his Hebrew lexicon and grammar, published in 1766. A curious reaction led him from the doctrines of Hutchinson, who found in scripture a system of physical science, to those of Glas, who held that biblical authority did not extend to such topics, and who, as did Robert Sandeman, vehemently opposed Hutchinson's views. Pike, who was married, died at Trowbridge in January 1773, and was buried on 10 January in the parish churchyard. He was survived by his children.<br>
