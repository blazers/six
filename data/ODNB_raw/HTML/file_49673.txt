<span class="headword">Dene,  Peter</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or after 1334), <span class="occ">canon lawyer and monk</span>, no doubt derived from one of the villages called Dean in Sussex. A secular priest of the Chichester diocese, he began to acquire benefices in Sussex by the late 1280s and, later, benefices elsewhere. By 1287 Dene was a master of arts and, probably by the century's end, a <i>doctor utriusque iuris</i>, though his university is unknown. In the meantime he had become a royal clerk and several times travelled overseas on the king's business for both Edward I and Edward II, while in 1297 he was a member of the regency council governing England in Prince Edward's name. In 1300, for a retaining fee of &pound;10 yearly, he became legal adviser to the monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury, whose rights he undertook to uphold against the archbishop of Canterbury, among others. No doubt this contributed to the dispute in which he became embroiled with Archbishop Winchelsey, whose visitation of his province in 1302 found Dene's possession of East Tangmere church to be irregular. In 1302, and again in 1305, Winchelsey deprived him of all his benefices in the province of Canterbury, including canonries at Wells Cathedral and at St Paul's, London.<br>
<br>A man of abundant enterprise and talent, Dene was soon in the service of the archbishop of York, acting, at different times, as his chancellor, commissary-general, and vicar-general. As a canon of York, he accompanied the archbishop on a visitation of St Mary's Abbey, York, whose chronicler called him (using Ovid's words) &#145;a dreadful snake&#146; (<i>serpente diro</i>; <span class="italic">Chronicle of St Mary's</span>, 71). His wealth permitted him not only to donate the heraldic window in the north nave of York Minster but also to make generous gifts to St Augustine's, where he built houses within the monastic enclosure, presumably for his own use and for the use of his household when they were in Canterbury.<br>
<br>Involvement in support of Thomas, earl of Lancaster, in his unsuccessful rebellion against Edward II in 1322, ended his career in the north. Within two weeks of the defeat at Boroughbridge, and within a week of the execution of Lancaster at Pontefract, Dene fled south, &#145;being threatened with arrest, imprisonment, loss of position, the seizure of all his property, and even with death&#146;  (&#145;Chronica Guillielmi Thorne&#146; col. 2055). (His fears were probably not without foundation, for Sir Bartholomew Badlesmere, with whom Dene may have been connected in his ill-fated adventure, was executed at Bleen near Canterbury on 14 April 1322.) He appeared at the gates of St Augustine's in Canterbury on 31 March 1322, begging admission to the community, and was instantly given the habit of a Benedictine monk. Three days later, without observing the usual year of probation, he made solemn profession, and Dr Peter Dene, became Brother Peter, monk of St Augustine's. His profession, as he later claimed, may have lacked canonical validity. In a hastily drafted will he left all his goods to the abbey, on the condition that he could have continued use of them until his death. He also remitted debts owed him by the monastery and bequeathed to the house a considerable amount of money and silver. The profession itself, he later claimed and the monastic chronicler seems to have concurred, was at best conditional: he would wear the habit and live at the monastery, but he would not live in the monastic dormitory, rather with his household in his own dwellings. Also, he would not join the other monks in church, chapter, refectory, or elsewhere for community exercises. &#145;He was free to act as the Lord inspired him and as it pleased him&#146; (<i>prout sibi dominus inspiraret et de ipsius Petri libera procederet voluntate</i>; &#145;Chronica Guillielmi Thorne&#146; col. 2055). Dene made a public statement before the community in chapter to the effect that by his profession he had no intention of leading the regular life.<br>
<br>Eight&#151;or possibly nine&#151;years later, when the political climate had cooled, Dene asked for permission to leave and return to his former life. When the abbot paid no serious attention to his request, Dene, on a wintry night in December 1331, dressed in secular garb, climbed over the wall and, with the assistance of the rector of St Martin's, fled into what the monks considered apostasy. Three monks of St Augustine's snatched their apostate from a royal official, who had captured him and was removing him to prison at Maidstone. Dene subsequently claimed that upon his return he was forced to make a statement that his profession was absolute and that he was truly a monk. Dene's situation was complicated even further when he learned that Henry, the new earl of Lancaster, suspected him of stealing from his late brother's treasury and of concealing the stolen goods at St Augustine's. Nothing further is heard of this.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the canonist Dene secretly appealed to the pope at Avignon. Of the three papally appointed commissioners only Richard Oxenden, prior of neighbouring Christ Church Priory, entered St Augustine's on 23 and 24 November 1332 to determine the facts in the case. The reluctance of the community to co-operate led to Oxenden's excommunication of the prior and another monk. When at length Dene was allowed to be interviewed, he replied <i>alto voce</i> for the benefit of his fellow monks that he was truly a monk and <i>sotto voce</i> for the benefit of Prior Oxenden that he was too old in years and broken in body to pursue the matter. He remained at St Augustine's, perhaps not altogether unhappily, for in the following year he was selected to serve on a committee to choose a new abbot. He died some time after June 1334.<br>
<br>Dene's library included the canon law texts of Gratian's <span class="italic">Decretum</span> and the <span class="italic">Decretals</span> of Gregory IX, and canonical commentaries by Hostiensis, Innocent IV, Guido de Baysio, William Durandus, Johannes Monachus, and Giovanni d'Andreae, as well as a five-volume collection of Roman law texts. He is depicted prominently as a kneeling figure in the heraldic window in York Minster.<br>
