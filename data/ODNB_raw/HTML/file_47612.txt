<span class="headword">Evans, Dame  Joan</span>  (1893&#150;1977), <span class="occ">scholar and author</span>, was born at Nash House, Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, on 22 June 1893, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33040/', "Sir John Evans (1823&#150;1908)")</script>, archaeologist and numismatist, and his third wife, Maria Millington Lathbury (1856&#150;1944), daughter of Charles Crawford Lathbury of Wimbledon. There were three sons and two daughters by Sir John's first marriage. Joan's half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33032/', "Sir Arthur Evans")</script>, of Knossos fame, was forty-two years her senior. As the child of an elderly, distinguished father and a mature, academic mother, she had a somewhat solitary childhood, depending for close affection on her nanny, Caroline Hancock, to whose memory she dedicated her memoir <span class="italic">Prelude and Fugue</span> (1964), and who stayed with her for nearly sixty-seven years. The only man she might have married was killed in the First World War. Her father died when she was fifteen but the bond between them was already forged, and she knew by instinct that some form of scholarship would be the guiding motif of her life.<br>
<br>Joan Evans was educated at Coram School, Watford, Berkhamsted Girls' Grammar School, and then from 1914 at St Hugh's College, Oxford, where she took a diploma in archaeology (with distinction) in 1916, a certificate of letters in 1919, and a BLitt in 1920. From 1917 to 1922 she was the college's librarian (initially temporarily). In 1931 she became honorary librarian of the Courtauld Institute, London. Her interests were always far-ranging, but in view of her later concentration on medieval France, it may seem surprising that her first book was <span class="italic">English Jewellery from the 5th Century BC to 1800</span> (1921). Much later she published <span class="italic">A History of Jewellery, 1100&#150;1870</span> (1953). She had a true collector's flair and, just as her father avidly collected British flints, she early began to collect gems and jewels. The Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, the Birmingham City Art Gallery, and, above all, the Victoria and Albert Museum, were to be the beneficiaries. From this time she published numerous articles on jewellery and medieval artefacts and occasionally edited French medieval texts.<br>
<br>In 1931 came Evans's ground-breaking book, <span class="italic">Pattern: a Study of Ornament in Western Europe from 1180 to 1900</span>, and in 1939 <span class="italic">Taste and Temperament</span>; but these were subsidiary interests. She truly discovered her abiding interest with <span class="italic">Life in Mediaeval France</span> (1925), which was followed by <span class="italic">Monastic Life at Cluny, 930&#150;1157</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Art in Mediaeval France</span> (1948), <span class="italic">English Art, 1307&#150;1461</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Cluniac Art of the Romanesque Period</span> (1950), <span class="italic">Dress in Mediaeval France</span> (1952), and her edition of <span class="italic">The Flowering of the Middle Ages</span> (1966). These works remain vital general works of reference, despite the further researches of others. France was the passion of her life. In the preface of <span class="italic">Art in Mediaeval France</span>, a work which was dedicated to archaeologists and antiquaries who had fought for France during the Second World War, Evans vividly recalled her childhood visits to France, when a &#145;mediaeval cycle of times and seasons, traditions and beliefs&#146; still governed much of everyday life, now much altered. Despite the ravages of the revolution and the recent war, she firmly believed that &#145;by force of memory and imagination and love we may mend the shining chain; not France, nor her history, nor the memorials of that history can die&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art in Mediaeval France</span>, x&#150;xi). To this end, she devoted some of her considerable private means, in the same year that she published this seminal work, purchasing and presenting to the municipality of M&acirc;con the Cluniac Chappelle des Moines de Berz&eacute;. A plaque commemorates the gift. In the 1930s and 1940s she had also worked on a later period of French history and had written biographical studies of Chateaubriand (1939), Madame de S&eacute;rilly (1946), and Joseph Joubert (1947). In <span class="italic">Prelude and Fugue</span> she chillingly describes the bombers going overhead at dawn on D-day: &#145;That dawn indeed it seemed as if all the world was changing. My mother who had dominated my life for so long, lay dead; the France that I loved was being attacked by her allies; and everything seemed in flux.&#146;<br>
<br>Joan Evans was a woman of strong family loyalties. In 1943 she published <span class="italic">Time and Chance: the Story of Arthur Evans and his Forebears</span> and in 1956 <span class="italic">A History of the Society of Antiquaries</span>. Sir John and Sir Arthur had both been presidents of the antiquaries. She became the first woman president (1959&#150;64), and in 1973 received the gold medal of the society. She was proud of the fact that she had been elected president in her own right with no suspicion of nepotism. From 1948 to 1951 she had been president of the Royal Archaeological Institute. She was a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur. Many other honours fell to her: she was DLitt, London (1930), DLitt, Oxford (1932), honorary LLD, Edinburgh (1952), honorary LittD, Cambridge (1956), honorary FRIBA, and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the Royal Society of Literature. In 1976 she was appointed DBE. She was at various times a trustee of the London Museum and of the British Museum and a member of the advisory council of the Victoria and Albert Museum. She was also a sympathetic and generous person. Her gifts to individual friends and scholars were anonymous and numerous. She was a major benefactor of St Hugh's College, and bought for it part of its present site; she was elected to an honorary fellowship in 1936, and returned to the college as a supernumerary fellow in 1951. She helped to secure for the National Trust the ridge above Wotton under Edge, where she lived for the second half of her life.<br>
<br>One unusual episode should be mentioned. In 1911 Miss Moberley and Miss Jourdain, successive principals of St Hugh's, published <span class="italic">An Adventure</span>, an account of a psychic experience which they believed had occurred to them on a visit to Versailles. They left the copyright to Joan Evans and she edited its fifth edition (1955). Despite her admiration for these ladies she was eventually convinced that the experience was hallucinatory and in 1971 she forbade further reprinting. In October 1976 she published her own view of the affair in <span class="italic"><span class="roman">&#145;An end to</span> An adventure<span class="roman">&#146;, in</span> Encounter</span> (vol. 47).<br>
<br>Joan Evans considered herself a Victorian, and her air of authority and her bearing were splendidly of that period. In appearance she was very like her father, a fact noted by her mother's French friends who remarked that this was &#145;tactful&#146; as her father was seventy when she was born. Her rapport with the nineteenth century was shown in 1956, when she co-edited Ruskin's diaries with J. H. Whitehead, and in 1966 when she edited <span class="italic">The Victorians</span>, a selection of extracts and illustrations that tell us almost as much about herself as about them. It was in character that she retained some of the heavy Evans family furniture in her home, Thousand Acres, Wotton under Edge, where she died on 14 July 1977. Her body was cremated. Of her writings it has been rightly said that she published too much too quickly; she can be faulted on detail. This, however, does not diminish her achievement overall, which was of an inspirational nature. She was a scholar with an overriding sense of beauty and visual awareness, inspired by the vision implied in Ruskin's phrase &#145;the lamp of beauty&#146;.<br>
