<span class="headword">Sturmey,  (John James) Henry</span>  (1857&#150;1930), <span class="occ">cycle and automobile writer and promoter</span>, was born at Norton-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, on 28 February 1857, the son of Henry Gundry Sturmey, a master mariner and merchant navy captain, and his wife, Mary Ann Trask. He was educated at Melcombe Regis School and Weymouth College. His first career as a schoolmaster, in mathematics and science, soon mingled with, and ultimately gave way to, his passion for cycling. This enthusiasm initially took the form of touring, attempts to sell bicycles made to his own specification, and the compilation and publication of a handbook for bicyclists. By 1879 he was a &#145;chief consul&#146; of the infant Bicycle Touring Club, which became the Cyclists Touring Club in 1883. After Sturmey had published the first edition of the <span class="italic">&#145;Indispensable&#146; Bicyclist's Handbook</span> (1877), he established contact with William Iliffe, of a Coventry family printing firm, a meeting which was to be a significant event for both.<br>
<br>Sturmey suggested a new weekly periodical, the <span class="italic">'Cyclist</span>, to replace <span class="italic">Bicycle World</span>, which Iliffes already printed. Sturmey edited the new periodical and Iliffes published the next edition of Sturmey's <span class="italic">Handbook</span>. Another of Sturmey's technical interests gave rise to a new periodical in 1888, <span class="italic">Photography</span> (later <span class="italic">Amateur Photographer</span>). Seven years later his intense interest in another technical innovation, the horseless carriage, resulted in the launch of another Iliffe periodical which Sturmey edited, <span class="italic">Autocar</span>. (While &#145;autocar&#146; did not gain currency, except as the title of a successful and long-lived periodical, the term &#145;cyclist&#146; did. It seems that it is to Sturmey's choice of this title that the word which entered common parlance is owed.) In the view of one of the contributors to a booklet commemorating Sturmey's life and work, <span class="italic">Autocar</span> in 1930 still bore the imprint of his personality and it was &#145;hardly an exaggeration to say as much of technical journals generally&#146;  (<span class="italic">H. S. Some Tributes</span>, 3). Sturmey also began a quarterly periodical, <span class="italic">Flying</span>, but this proved to be before its time.<br>
<br>The extension of Sturmey's interests from the cycle to the automobile paralleled the evolution of part of the motor industry from cycle manufacture. Sturmey invested heavily in the Great Horseless Carriage Company, one of the numerous companies promoted by the inventor turned financier, H. J. Lawson (1852&#150;1925), whom Sturmey succeeded as chairman of the Daimler Motor Company. In October 1897 Sturmey successfully drove from John o' Groats to Land's End in a Daimler with Mulliner body, which he had designed. Three years later, in November 1900, Sturmey became an early victim of a motor accident, when he was seriously injured in a Dawson car in which he was a passenger. After a slow recovery, he broke with Iliffe in 1901, as a result of the latter's belief that Sturmey's editorial position was incompatible with his active involvement in the motor industry.<br>
<br>Sturmey then began the import of the American Duryea car, having visited the principal American motor manufacturers in 1899. In 1902 Sturmey set up the British Duryea Company, which built under licence in Coventry for a few years, utilizing a Rugby-made engine. The Duryea was a light runabout in the American buggy style. It was popular for a time, but the Duryea brothers split up and an enduring marque did not emerge from their pioneering efforts. St John Nixon described the Duryea, with its tiller steering, as very unconventional, and was also somewhat dismissive of Sturmey, describing his reputation as a &#145;high authority&#146; on motor vehicles as &#145;largely unjustified&#146;  (St John Nixon, 127). Sturmey Motors Ltd made the Napier-Parsons light van for one year, 1907, before inaugurating the Lotis marque of cars and commercial vehicles. The range included taxicabs and lasted from 1908 to 1911. The collapse of Lotis has been attributed to the failure of the Brazilian importer for whom a car for the Brazilian market had been produced. It appears that Sturmey failed to benefit from his own insights, for in 1902 he had identified lack of capital resources as one of the reasons why British manufacturers had failed to make headway.<br>
<br>His break with Iliffe did not mean the end of Sturmey's involvement in motoring journalism, for he became a major contributor to <span class="italic">Autocar's</span> rival, <span class="italic">Motor</span>, which was launched in 1903. His contribution to cycling continued indirectly through the Sturmey-Archer three-speed hub gear. This device had a complex background. Although manufactured by Frank Bowden's Three-Speed Gear Syndicate from 1903, numerous initiatives were involved. It owed something to Sturmey, but in practical terms probably more to the mechanic William Reilly, whose designs were patented in the name of a colleague, James Archer, to avoid a restrictive contract Reilly had entered into with the Hub Two-Speed Gear Company Ltd. The gear was used in an experimental light car that Sturmey built in 1900 and was subsequently used for motorcycles for a few years, but found its appropriate application in the cycle. Sturmey appears to have had no significant involvement with the syndicate after 1904, when he sold it his foreign patent rights.<br>
<br>By the time Lotis collapsed, Sturmey was in middle age. His American contacts were further made use of in the establishment of Bramco Ltd (whose name was derived from &#145;British American components&#146;), a business importing car components from the USA. Sturmey remained in his adopted city of Coventry, a tall and by all accounts somewhat forbidding figure, with an air of authority unrelieved by humour, at least in the company of strangers. He was said to have taken little part in the civic and social life of the city, but he &#145;had a penchant for expressing his very decided views upon a wide range of subjects&#146; in letters to the press  (<span class="italic">Midland Daily Telegraph</span>, 9 Jan 1930). In the 1920s Sturmey returned to the topic of cycle gears, advocating in the cycling press the hub as opposed to the bracket gear. With John Peart, a Coventry engineer, he took out a patent (118, 178 of 1922) for the first five-speed hub gear, but failed to interest a manufacturer.<br>
<br>Sturmey never married, and died at his Coventry home, Quarry Close, St Nicholas Street, on 8 January 1930. His funeral at St Nicholas Church, Radford, Coventry, was attended by the Iliffes and staff members of Bramco Ltd, but the local press remarked that otherwise the motor and cycle industries were scarcely represented.<br>
