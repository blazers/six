<span class="headword">Carreras, Sir  James Enrique</span>  (1909&#150;1990), <span class="occ">film executive</span>, was born on 30 January 1909 at 9 Chiswick Lane, Chiswick, as Jaime Enrique Carreras, the only child of Enrique Carreras, commission merchant, and his wife, Dolores Montousse. He was educated privately. In 1913 his father, who came from the Carreras tobacco family of Spain, became a film exhibitor and built the first of a small chain of cinemas in London, the Blue Halls. James joined the business as a youth and worked his way up from usher to assistant manager. In 1927, when he was very young, he married Vera St John (<i>d</i>. 1986); they had one son, <a href="#cosubject_54794">Michael [<i>see below</i>]</a>. In 1935 his father and William Hinds, known professionally as Will Hammer, founded Exclusive Films. James worked for this firm also. It distributed imported second features and a few films made by Hammer himself for Hammer Productions, a small company which he had registered in 1934. This was moribund by 1937. During the Second World War James rose from private to lieutenant-colonel in the Honourable Artillery Company, but he rejoined the firm after the war.<br>
<br>Will Hammer now wished to return to production and revive the name of Hammer. He was associated with a few films made at Marylebone Studios in 1947. In 1948 he joined with Enrique and James Carreras to form a new company, Hammer Film Productions, as the production arm of Exclusive Films. Production proper began in 1948 at a mansion studio at Bray, near Windsor. The company was registered in February 1949 and James Carreras, who was to dominate the company, became chairman. They made routine second features, a number of them based on BBC radio serials, using the large house and nearby locations as inexpensive settings. Output was large, and films were quickly and cheaply made by a small permanent team. Much of the writing and direction was by James's son Michael and Will Hammer's son Anthony Hinds, and there was an informal and family atmosphere in the unit.<br>
<br>In 1955 they made a science fiction thriller, <span class="italic">The Quatermass Xperiment</span>, in which the survivor of a space journey is gradually consumed by a mysterious fungus. This had been a popular BBC television serial, and its enormous success as a film encouraged Carreras to introduce a second seeping mass of something horrible in <span class="italic">X the Unknown</span> the next year. A third successful film, shown in 1957, was <span class="italic">Quatermass II</span>, which portrayed people taken over by menacing space organisms. The Gothic horror tale was out of fashion at the time, but Carreras now took a well-considered gamble, and with <span class="italic">The Curse of Frankenstein</span> later that year found his niche. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing first appeared as Hammer's favourite bogeymen in this lurid and profitable colour remake of the 1931 film <span class="italic">Frankenstein</span>. From now on an important part of Hammer Films' output featured vampires, werewolves, resurrected mummies, blood, and gore, and there were repeated appearances of Frankenstein and Dracula, producing delicious dread in the audience. Most other film-makers and the critics scorned these films, made in six to eight weeks and promoted with lurid posters and stunts. But they had a large and enthusiastic public in Britain and abroad, especially in America, where they had a huge cult following among teenagers. Ironically, it was Carreras who achieved the assured distribution in America which had so long eluded more serious British producers. His was the most consistently profitable film company in Britain, earning &pound;1.5 million in foreign exchange one year. The company received the queen's award for industry in 1968. Carreras took no part in the creative side of film-making.<br>
<br>However, times changed. The studio was sold in 1968, and although production continued elsewhere the verve had gone. In 1972 Carreras sold his holding to Michael and resigned as chief executive, though he remained chairman. He moved to the EMI group of companies, where he acted as special adviser for some years. With the appearance in 1973 from America of <span class="italic">The Exorcist</span>, an exceptionally frightening film, the writing was on the wall for the escapist Hammer brand of horror. The last Hammer film was made in 1978, and the company was in the hands of the receivers by 1979. Carreras then had a remarkable idea: to sell the <span class="roman">Hammer House of Horror</span> series to television in the early 1980s. This was then repackaged as video cassettes in the late 1980s for yet another set of youngsters going through the monsters stage.<br>
<br>In appearance and character Carreras, a good-looking, mild-mannered, soberly dressed businessman, who was a strong family man and devout Christian, was a surprising person to have brought about the phrase &#145;Hammer horror&#146;. But the essential innocence of the genre, with its saving grace of absurdity, was very different from the sadistic and violent films produced by other companies in later years.<br>
<br>Carreras was a prominent member of the Variety Club, the show-business charity, being its chief barker in 1954&#150;5. He was chairman of the board of Variety Clubs International for eleven years and president from 1961 to 1963. In 1970 he was knighted for his extensive charity work over many years, especially in the cause of young people&#151;he was president of the London Federation of Boys' Clubs for five years. He had been appointed MBE in 1944, possibly for secret operations in Spain during the war. He became KCVO in 1980 and also received honours from Spain and Liberia. Carreras died of a heart attack on 9 June 1990 at his home, Queen Anne Cottage, Friday Street, Henley-on-Thames.<br>
<br>Carreras's only son, <a name="cosubject_54794"></a><span class="headword">Michael Henry Carreras</span>  (1927&#150;1994), <span class="occ">film producer and director</span>, was born on 21 December 1927 in London and educated at Frays College, Uxbridge, and Reading School. He had early ambitions to be a jazz trumpeter, and remained a jazz enthusiast. At sixteen (being too young for military service) he joined Exclusive Films, initially in the publicity department. Following national service in the Grenadier Guards, he rejoined the company. His first film as producer was Vernon Sewell's <span class="italic">The Dark Light</span> (1951), and he went on to produce many of Hammer's most successful films of the 1950s, including its first science-fiction film, <span class="italic">Four-sided Triangle</span> (1952). He won critical acclaim for <span class="italic">Yesterday's Enemy</span> (1959) and <span class="italic">Hell is a City</span> (1960). However, there was friction between Carreras and his father, and in 1961 he established his own company, Capricorn Productions, though he continued to work for Hammer. His most profitable Hammer film was <span class="italic">One Million Years BC</span> (1966), starring Raquel Welch. He rejoined Hammer as head of production in 1971, and in 1972 bought out his father, becoming managing director. Seven years and only a handful of films later Hammer was bankrupt and Carreras was forced to resign. After unsuccessful attempts to revive his film career he died of cancer on 19 April 1994 in London, survived by his wife, Jo, and three sons.<br>
