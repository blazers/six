<span class="headword">Lindsay,  John, of Balcarres</span>, Lord Menmuir  (1552&#150;1598), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the second son of David Lindsay of Edzell (<i>d</i>. 1558), ninth earl of Crawford, and his wife, Katherine Campbell (<i>d</i>. 1578). When John was a child his father gave him the benefices of Menmuir, Lethnot, and Lochlee in Angus (Forfarshire), of which he was patron. John Lindsay was thus commonly known as &#145;Parson of Menmuir&#146;, though he was never ordained. On 29 November 1581 he married Marion Guthrie (<i>d</i>. 1592), widow of David Borthwick of Lochhill and daughter of a burgess of Edinburgh. She was to be the mother of all seven of his children.<br>
<br>John Lindsay's early years were spent being privately educated at the family seat at Edzell. About the year 1570, however, he and his elder brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16694/', "David Lindsay (1551?&#150;1610)")</script> went to the continent to be educated under the care of James Lawson, later minister of Edinburgh. They took up residence in Paris but fled to England because of trouble between Huguenots and Roman Catholics in the French capital. The brothers proceeded to Cambridge; David soon returned home but John, &#145;able to come to great understanding of letters&#146;, according to Lawson, stayed on  (Lindsay, 1.332). On his return to Scotland he devoted himself to legal studies and became an advocate. Perhaps with the help of his kinsman the earl of Argyll, he was presented to the lords of session by the king on 5 July 1581 as John Lindsay of Drumcairne. He was recommended as &#145;a man that fears God, of good literature, practice, judgement and understanding of the lawes, of good fame, haiffing sufficient leiving of his awin, and quha can mak gud expedition and despatche of materis tueching the leiges&#146;  (Brunton and Haig, 177). Lindsay thus became an ordinary lord of session, taking the title Lord Menmuir, and began a relatively short but influential career as a statesman.<br>
<br>Menmuir's involvement in parliamentary affairs began in October 1583 when he was recorded as one of the king's commissioners for holding parliament. From 1587 onwards he was appointed to numerous parliamentary commissions concerning such matters as taxation, coinage, the publication of statutes, and ecclesiastical finance. He was also involved in drafting a number of significant acts, most notably that of 1587 for the representation of the shires in parliament (though his draft of this was not used). In the later 1580s he was appointed to two privy council commissions for visitation of the University of St Andrews, of which he was to be appointed chancellor in 1587. As Menmuir his name is found on privy council sederunts after November 1589 and he attended frequently for the next eight years. In 1586 he bought Balcarres and other lands in eastern Fife, all of which in June 1592 were united and erected into the barony of Balcarres in a great seal charter. These lands would form the basis of the estates of his successors. Menmuir made his principal residence there, and in 1595 embellished the existing tower house with the addition of a substantial stair tower on the east and further accommodation on the south.<br>
<br>Menmuir's accumulation of public offices continued in May 1592 with his appointment as master of the metals, with responsibility for regulating all mining of ore and manufacture of metals. In January 1594 he acted in this capacity when approving a tack of mines to Thomas Foulis, an Edinburgh goldsmith. He also attempted to use this position to his own advantage, and in partnership with his brother David attempted to mine lead ore on the family estates in Angus. They imported German and Dutch expert labour but it is unclear how successful the venture proved.<br>
<br>Menmuir became prominent in financial affairs when in July 1593 he was appointed to a council for managing the income from the property of Queen Anne. The council was so successful that the queen is said to have goaded her husband about the greater ease with which she could obtain cash. James reacted almost immediately, in January 1596 appointing her financial commissioners and four others to an exchequer commission which became known as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69937/', "Octavians")</script>. They took over all responsibility for royal finance, while the treasurer, comptroller, and collector lost their positions, Menmuir being appointed to the two latter posts. No alienation of royal property was to take place, nor any disbursement of money even by the king, without the consent of five commissioners. Menmuir was also appointed keeper of the privy seal in March and secretary in May 1596. The power of the Octavians was immense and caused widespread resentment. Coupled with their lack of success in rectifying the dire financial situation of the crown, this was enough to force them to demit office after a year.<br>
<br>The Octavians were particularly unpopular with the kirk, largely because of the Roman Catholicism, or suspected Roman Catholic sympathies, of some of them. Menmuir seems initially, however, to have had honourable intentions for the kirk. In the summer of 1596 he drafted a putative act of parliament presenting a sensible solution to two long-standing problems. His own <span class="roman">Act of Annexation</span> of 1587 had taken the revenues of the prelacies into crown hands and dealt what seemed at the time a death blow to episcopacy. Nine years later he suggested a permanent financial settlement for the kirk from these revenues; each of Scotland's fifty presbyteries would also send a commissioner to parliament. James Melville described this scheme as &#145;the best and maist exact that ever was devysit &hellip; and wald, sum litle things amendit, haiff bein glaidlie receavit be the breithring of the best judgment&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Autobiography and Diary</span>, 345). It was never implemented, however, for a breakdown in relations between James VI and the kirk in the later months of 1596 caused the plans to be scrapped. At the beginning of 1597 James decided to assert royal supremacy over the kirk, and he enlisted the forensic mind of Menmuir to draw up a list of fifty-five penetrating questions concerning ecclesiastical polity and authority to be presented to the general assembly. This apparent volte-face by Menmuir led to a serious clash with the presbytery of St Andrews when he was sent by the king to complain about the political content of a minister's sermons. Things became very personal; the royal secretary was described as &#145;a plaine mocker of religioun&#146;  (Calderwood, 548), and the lavishness of his recently built house was cast up against him.<br>
<br>By this time, however, Menmuir was gravely ill, having suffered for some time from &#145;the stone&#146;. His attendances at meetings of the privy council became less frequent and he planned in March 1597 to go to Paris for surgery, combining the visit with an embassy to the French court. He did not leave Scotland, however. In June his &#145;lang absence fra court&#146;  (Lindsay, 1.371) was commented upon, and in December he made his final appearance on the privy council and resigned as a lord of session and as secretary, comptroller, and collector. In the spring of 1598 he again planned to travel to France but again did not go. He died on 3 September at Balcarres House and was buried in the nearby parish church of Kilconquhar. He was survived by his second wife, Jane Lauder, who had already been twice widowed after marriages to Sir James Forrester of Corstorphine and John Campbell of Cawdor, and who went on to marry for a fourth time. His heir was his eldest surviving son, David, through whom he was the ancestor of the earls of Balcarres.<br>
