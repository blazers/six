<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Horwood, Sir  William Thomas Francis</span>  (1868&#150;1943), <span class="occ">army officer and police administrator</span>, was born in November 1868, the youngest son of Charles Horwood of the Manor House, Broadwater, Sussex. At twenty he was commissioned into the 5th lancers, serving as recruiting officer and adjutant for the 49th regimental district from 1900 to 1902. After two years as brigade major in the 24th field artillery, he moved in 1904 to the War Office, where he spent six years on administrative duties. His first experience of the police was as chief of police of the London and North Eastern Railway, a post he held from 1911 until the beginning of the First World War. From 1914 to 1915 he was deputy assistant adjutant-general at the War Office, and in 1915 was appointed provost marshal at the general headquarters of the British expeditionary force in France. He was awarded the DSO in 1917. On 27 April 1897 Horwood married Violet (1864/5&#150;1941), eldest daughter of Lieutenant-General James George Fife, of Goring-on-Thames, Berkshire, an officer in the Royal Engineers. The couple had one daughter.<br>
<br>When Sir Nevil Macready was appointed commissioner of police to the metropolis in September 1918, after the first police strike and the resignation of Sir Edward Henry, the former commissioner, he chose Horwood, his former staff officer, as one of his assistant commissioners, continuing the tradition of appointing men from a military background to the highest posts in the police force. He later promoted him to the new rank of deputy assistant commissioner. Working closely with Macready, Horwood helped to restore the morale of the force after the strike, and when the police union called a second strike, in August 1919, only 5 per cent of the force went on strike, and were dismissed. He oversaw the introduction of an experimental force of women police in 1919, and the experiment with mobile patrols, which developed into the flying squad in the 1920s. When Macready was sent to command the troops in Ireland in 1920 he advised the prime minister, Lloyd George, to appoint Horwood as his successor.<br>
<br>Horwood was a good administrator, preferring, like his predecessors, to surround himself with military men, including Major-General Sir Wyndham Childs, appointed assistant commissioner to replace Sir Basil Thomson in 1921. One of the first problems to face Horwood in the early 1920s was that of arson attacks by Irish terrorists in London, and attacks on the families of men serving in Ireland in the Royal Irish Constabulary and the British army. Although he began a big recruiting campaign in 1920 he had to end this after the imposition of the &#145;Geddes axe&#146; in 1922 and the reduction in national expenditure, and had to cut the force by 1000, a 5 per cent reduction in strength. But following the decision of the government in 1925 to hand over the policing of naval and military establishments to the Admiralty and the War Office, 1300 policemen were able to return to regular duties, and the force was back up to strength by the time of the general strike in 1926, when the conduct of the police impressed the public. By 1927 criticism of the Metropolitan Police was growing, however, and despite the report of the Macmillan committee on the conduct and management of the police, which cleared the police of all but one of the charges in the newspapers that innocent citizens were being harassed, morale was low.<br>
<br>Horwood's last few months in office were overshadowed by two scandals, which gained a lot of press publicity and contributed to the worsening reputation of the force. In May 1928 allegations accusing the police of using tyrannical methods in the interrogation of a Miss Savidge led to questions in parliament, and although a commission of inquiry vindicated the police officers concerned, the government decided in August 1928 to set up the royal commission on police powers and procedure because of the criticism of police methods. The Savidge case was followed by the Goddard scandal, when Sergeant Goddard, who had had the duty of suppressing brothels and gambling dens in London, and keeping an eye on nightclubs, was accused by his fellow policeman, Sergeant Joslin, of accepting bribes from bookmakers and the owners of brothels and nightclubs to save themselves from police investigation. Although Horwood referred the case to the Home Office, and an inquiry found Joslin guilty of making false accusations, Goddard was later charged, and imprisoned, in 1929. In February 1928, before these scandals broke, Horwood had already announced his intention to retire in November, and the home secretary, Sir William Joynson-Hicks, decided that the Metropolitan Police needed to be headed by a strong and well-known public figure who could restore confidence in the force. He appointed General Lord Byng of Vimy to succeed Horwood as commissioner on Horwood's retirement on his sixtieth birthday.<br>
<br>Horwood was appointed KCB in 1921 and GBE in 1928. He had nearly died in 1922 after eating a box of poisoned chocolates sent through the post, but survived another twenty years, and died on 16 November 1943 at his home, The Hut, Coast Road, West Mersea, Essex, after a short illness. He was cremated at Golders Green on 22 November.<br>
