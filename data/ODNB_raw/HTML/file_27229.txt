<span class="headword">Thomas,  John Fryer</span>  (1797&#150;1877), <span class="occ">East India Company servant</span>, was born on 12 November 1797, probably in the parish of St Mary, Newington, Surrey, the son of James Thomas, formerly a commander in the company's service, and his wife, Ann. In 1814 he obtained a writership in the East India Company's service and joined Haileybury College. After the customary two years' study, he landed at Madras in July 1816, which marked the beginning of a long career in the Madras civil service. On 24 October 1820 he married Diana Elizabeth Wheen (1799/1800&#150;1839), with whom he had at least one surviving child, a daughter. Diana died in May 1839 and was buried in the cemetery of St George's Cathedral, Madras.<br>
<br>In 1844, after holding appointments in the <i>sadr adalat</i> and officiating in various revenue and judicial appointments, including that of judge of the provincial court of appeal and circuit, Thomas was appointed revenue secretary, and, in the following year, chief secretary, to the government of Madras. In both positions he exercised considerable influence over the governor, George Hay, eighth marquess of Tweeddale, and several of his minutes attracted favourable notice from the court of directors. In 1850 he became a member of the governor's council and chief judge of the <i>sadr diwani</i> and <i>faujdari adalat</i>. In 1853, prompted in part by the recent Moplah uprisings in Malabar, he published a <span class="italic">Memorandum of Suggestions for the Amelioration of the Madras Ryotwar</span>. His five-year term on the council expired in 1855, whereupon he resigned from the service and returned to England. The governor, third Baron Harris, was happy to recommend him to Sir Charles Wood as a man of &#145;considerable sagacity&#146; but warned Wood that he was not without his &#145;crotchets&#146;  (Harris to Wood).<br>
<br>Thomas's minutes were locally renowned for their incisive language. Most notably, he produced a review of T. B. Macaulay's draft of the Indian penal code and a minute on Indian education, the latter written in 1850 shortly after he had joined the council. Thomas's unequivocal views on education were rooted in his conviction that it was Britain's duty to effect the social and moral elevation of India. He disliked the education policy of the anglicists, with its emphasis on Western-style higher education institutions, and argued that the funds available, limited as they were, would be best spent in educating the masses through the medium of the vernacular languages. But, although a champion of vernacular education, he had no desire to uphold or reinforce indigenous values or culture. An evangelical, his hostility to Western-style institutions stemmed solely from his fear that government colleges were educating Indians in a moral vacuum and turning them into lawless atheists. He abhorred both Islam and Hinduism, condemning the scriptures of the latter for their &#145;puerile absurdities&#146;, and threw himself behind the missionaries in their long battle to get the <span class="roman">Bible</span> taught in government schools. In retirement he stepped up his attack on secular education and in 1860 published a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Bible Education in India</span>, which argued that diffusion of Christianity in India was the only way to build loyalty and prevent another catastrophe like the uprising of 1857.<br>
<br>Thomas died at his home at 22 Vanbrugh Park, Blackheath, on 7 April 1877. He was survived by his daughter, Louisa Ann, who at the time of his death was unmarried.<br>
