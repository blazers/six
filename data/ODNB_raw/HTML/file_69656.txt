<span class="headword">Vincent,  Richard</span>  (1697<span class="mult">x</span>1701?&#150;1783), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born probably in London and may have been the Richard Vincent baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 27 June 1697, the son of Richard and Elizabeth Vincent, although this conflicts with his age at death stated by the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, which would suggest a birth date of 1700 or 1701. He was the first of a family of musicians active in London, mainly in the Covent Garden area, during the eighteenth century. Some confusion has arisen and persisted owing to the number of musicians referred to simply as Mr Vincent in contemporary records. By February 1720 he was a member of the opera band at the Academy of Music, playing the bassoon for an annual salary of &pound;40. He had joined the king's musick by 1 April 1724. On 12 December 1737, at the church of St Benet Paul's Wharf, he married Elizabeth Bincks 
    (sometimes Binks; <i>c</i>.1708&#150;1792?)
  , a young actress who had made her d&eacute;but at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1729 and acted at the Covent Garden Theatre in the 1730s (she was probably the daughter of the Mrs Bincks who was a dresser at Covent Garden from 1735 to 1740). Billed as Mrs Vincent from January 1738, Elizabeth continued with her acting career in Dublin and at Covent Garden into the 1770s, by which time she was considered past her best. Her address for benefit tickets between 1750 and 1752 was the Cock and Turk's Head in Bedford Street. At least three of the couple's children joined the acting or musical professions. Richard Vincent was an original subscriber to the declaration of trust that established the Royal Society of Musicians in August 1739. His brother Thomas and his brother's sons <a href="#cosubject_75412">Thomas</a> and <a href="#cosubject_75413">James [<i>see below</i>]</a> were also subscribers at this time. Richard also performed on the harpsichord in a number of concerts and composed songs, and at some point he joined the Covent Garden orchestra as an oboist. He may have been the Mr Vincent paid 5<i>s</i>. per night in 1767&#150;8. Burney refers to him as being &#145;for more than thirty years the principal hautbois at Covent-garden&#146;  (Burney, <span class="italic">Hist. mus.</span>, 2.1011), and he was living in the Little Piazza, Covent Garden, in 1769. At the time of his death on 10 August 1783 at Tottenham Court Road, London, he was described as &#145;the oldest Musician belonging to Covent-garden playhouse and to Vauxhall-gardens, who enjoyed, till the last year of his life, a remarkable flow of spirits&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). This obituary notice makes no mention of a widow, although it is thought that his wife survived him.<br>
<br>One of Vincent's sons, <a name="cosubject_69655"></a><span class="headword">Richard Vincent</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1766), <span class="occ">musician</span>, lived in the Covent Garden area. Known primarily as a violinist and drummer, he became a member of the Royal Society of Musicians on 5 January 1752 and was leading the band at Vauxhall Gardens at the time of his marriage in 1755. On 25 August at St Paul's, Covent Garden, he married the singer and actress Isabella Burchell [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64360/', "Vincent, Isabella")</script>]. They had at least three daughters, according to the registers of St Paul's: Elizabeth (who possibly became the actress Mrs Ferguson), Sophia, and Penelope Louisa, the latter two dying in childhood. Vincent was living in King Street, Covent Garden, in 1763. He died in London on 28 August 1766 and was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 31 August. His will, which places him in the parish of St Marylebone, was made on 25 August 1766 and left all of his estate, unspecified, to his widow, Isabella.<br>
<br>Another son (possibly the youngest) of Richard Vincent senior, <a name="cosubject_69656"></a><span class="headword">Charles Vincent</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1777&#150;1795)<span class="occ"></span>, acted at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1777 and joined Tate Wilkinson's company at Wakefield in September of that year. However, by 1795 he was curate of St John's in Leeds and a schoolmaster. A Miss Vincent (<i>fl</i>. 1762&#150;1771), probably a daughter of Richard and Elizabeth Vincent, made her d&eacute;but at Covent Garden at the latter's benefit on 16 April 1762 and performed there during 1767&#150;8. There was also Sarah, who is described as the illegitimate daughter of &#145;Richard Vincent, Sr&#146; and whose baptism (30 April 1758) is recorded in the registers of St Paul's. A Richard Vincent, with a wife named Isabella and five children baptized at St Paul's, Covent Garden, in the 1740s, and whose will was proved on 2 August 1783, may have been related.<br>
<br>The brother of Richard Vincent senior, <a name="cosubject_75411"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Vincent</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1693?, <em>d.</em> 1751?)<span class="occ"></span>, possibly the son of Richard and Elizabeth Vincent baptized on 22 January 1693 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, played the bassoon in the guards for many years, composed music for the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre, and probably contributed some music for some dances published in 1721. Besides subscribing to the Royal Society of Musicians, he served on the first board of governors. The list of the king's musick features the name Thomas Vincent regularly between 1727 and 1750, although some of these instances probably refer to his son. Vincent died probably in late 1751, as his will was proved on 13 January 1752. The sole executor and administrator was the same son, <a name="cosubject_75412"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Vincent</span>  (<em>c.</em>1720&#150;1783), <span class="occ">oboist and composer</span>, who was born in London about 1720 and may have been one of the Thomas Vincents baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 28 October 1720 and 11 August 1723, both the sons of Thomas and Elizabeth Vincent. He became a very successful performer. His family connections no doubt assisted him in acquiring Giuseppe Sammartini as his teacher. Hawkins noted that Thomas junior was known to have possessed most of his teacher's &#145;excellencies&#146; in &#145;a very eminent degree&#146;, at a time when oboists were &#145;greatly superior to any that can be remembered before the arrival of Martini in England&#146;  (Hawkins, 2.895). He appeared at events including the annual spring concerts given at the King's Theatre for the benefit of the Royal Society of Musicians (1743&#150;68), the annual Foundling Hospital <span class="italic">Messiah</span> in 1754 and 1758, and the Covent Garden and Drury Lane oratorios during the 1750s, and he was concerto soloist at the Lock Hospital on 29 February 1764. Vincent also published a number of works during this period, including six solos (1748), <span class="italic">A Sett [<i>sic</i>] of Familiar Lessons for the Harpsichord</span> (1755), and songs (1760?). He was a member of the king's musick during the 1760s (while living at Brook Green, Hammersmith), although he may have gained this position much earlier, and may have appeared at the Dublin Rotunda in 1770. In 1764&#150;5 Vincent joined Peter Crawford and John Gordon in the management of opera at the King's Theatre, but the venture ended in 1769 with the loss of a considerable sum of money. The will of a John Gowland (proved 23 August 1776), described as Vincent's assignee, shows Vincent to have been deeply in debt, as he was paying his entire salary of &pound;40 as a royal musician, and his additional income as the king's barber, to Gowland; income was then to pass to a bookseller in New Bond Street, James Robson, who, after taking his own costs, was to transfer the sum to Vincent's wife, Penelope, for as long as she lived. Vincent was not to receive the money until after her death. Burney suggests happier times, when Vincent, an experienced professor and &#145;long a favourite on the hautbois&#146;, had &#145;been in great favour with the prince of Wales&#146;, presumably George III's father Frederick, and &#145;had acquired a considerable sum of money in his profession, which he augmented by marriage&#146;  (Burney, <span class="italic">Hist. mus.</span>, 2.870). Vincent died in 1783, probably on 10 May. An oboist, Thomas Vincent (<i>fl</i>. 1784?&#150;1795), may have been his son and may have appeared in the Handel commemoration (1784) and been a member of the king's musick in 1793 and 1795.<br>
<br>The younger Thomas Vincent's brother <a name="cosubject_75413"></a><span class="headword">James Vincent</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1718?, <em>d.</em> 1749), who may have been the James, son of Thomas and Elizabeth Vincent, baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 18 March 1718, was an <span class="occ">organist</span> in London, holding posts (with John Stanley) at the Inner Temple Church and also at St Luke's, Old Street. He also published compositions, including a few songs which appeared mainly during the 1730s and 1740s. Burney described him as &#145;a brilliant performer&#146; who &#145;died young&#146;  (Burney, <span class="italic">Hist. mus.</span>, 2.870). He died in London on 6 October 1749.<br>
