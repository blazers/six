<span class="headword">Parsons,  John Henry</span>  (1890&#150;1981), <span class="occ">cricketer and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 30 May 1890 at St John's Street, Oxford, the second of the six children of William Parsons (1854&#150;1931), chef at Brasenose College, Oxford, and later a hotel manager, and his wife, Kate Horn (<i>d</i>. 1919). The family moved to the midlands in 1898 and Parsons attended Bablake School in Coventry. There he became captain of cricket and football before finding employment at the Humber car factory in the city, where he quickly advanced to the responsible role of a car tester. Footballing and cricketing performances on the sports field led to trials with both Coventry City Football Club and Warwickshire County Cricket Club. In August 1910, within one week, he went from being a net bowler with the county to playing first-class cricket, via a double century on his d&eacute;but for the second eleven. The press comment that &#145;Warwickshire seem to have struck something good&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sporting Argus</span>) led him to make the first of several brave decisions. This was to accept professional terms with a county which had serious financial problems and abandon a career in the prosperous car industry. In the four years before the First World War broke out Parsons was a member of the team which, against all expectations, won the county championship in 1911. He made the first of his thirty-eight centuries in 1913 and appeared for the Players against the Gentlemen in July 1914. His name was pencilled in for the next MCC tour of Australia and it was said he would &#145;go straight to the top of the tree&#146;  (<span class="italic">Wisden</span>, 1915, 124).<br>
<br>The outbreak of war put paid to these cricket prospects. Parsons served in the Warwickshire yeomanry and took part in the battle of Suvla Bay at Gallipoli before being commissioned in the Worcestershire yeomanry. Both regiments took part in the attack on Huj, near Gaza, in November 1917, when he was one of 181 men who routed a Turkish and Austrian force of over 2000. It proved to be the last cavalry charge in British military history. Success paved the way for General Allenby to take Jerusalem and Parsons was awarded the Military Cross.<br>
<br>There followed five years serving with the Indian army on the north-west frontier during which Parsons married, on 19 April 1922, Gwendoline Ellen (Gwen) Bassett (1894&#150;1964), a nursing sister in Quetta. They had a son and a daughter. Soon afterwards he took another brave decision: to leave the army and resume a career as a cricketer. The bravery lay in hoping he could re-establish himself in the Warwickshire side. In the social context of the time he was turning his back on a life as an Indian army officer to play cricket as Parsons, J. H.&#151;a professional.<br>
<br>In the twelve years which followed (1924&#150;36) Parsons completed a first-class career which yielded 17,969 runs (average 35.72). He toured India with the MCC in 1926&#150;7, while innings of 161 against the 1928 West Indians and 190 against the 1931 New Zealanders again brought press suggestions that he be picked for England. The nearest he got, however, was selection for the Gentlemen against the Players, when in four appearances (1929&#150;31) he averaged 40.12. For the professional had, in 1928, made yet another brave decision when he sought ordination in the Church of England. He trained at St Aidan's Theological College, Birkenhead. While serving his title at Rugby and supervising soup kitchens during the depression, Parsons continued to play occasional first-class cricket as an amateur, and sometimes captained Warwickshire. He &#145;led a disciplined side and knew what he wanted&#146;, recalled his county colleague E. J. &#145;Tiger&#146; Smith  (Howat, <span class="italic">Cricketer Militant</span>, 83).<br>
<br>Shortly after war broke out in 1939&#151;by which time he was vicar of Liskeard in Cornwall&#151;Parsons volunteered to be an army chaplain. Two brigadiers recalled those years: &#145;What a pearl of great price the unit had as their padre&#146; and &#145;I wish I could strip him of his black buttons and make him one of my company commanders&#146;  (Howat, <span class="italic">Cricketer Militant</span>, 92). After the surrender of Italy in 1943, he became senior chaplain at Taranto, where his spiritual and practical concern for the allied forces, German prisoners of war, and displaced Italian civilians brought him a mention in dispatches.<br>
<br>On his return to Liskeard after the war (to a parish which had hardly known him) Parsons's incumbency was significant for the fervour of his evangelism and for the size of his congregations, together with his ability to run youth clubs and to raise money. Yet underlying all these&#151;as in his chaplaincy at Taranto&#151;was the need for reconciliation. In 1946 he had the sword he had carried at Huj against the Turks made into a ploughshare, echoing the book of <span class="roman">Micah</span>. With it he ploughed the field, sowed the seed, reaped the corn, and baked the bread which &#145;I used at the Communion Service&#146;  (Howat, <span class="italic">Cricketer Militant</span>, 104). He was appointed to a canonry of Truro Cathedral in 1953 and subsequently (1959&#150;65) served the rural parish of Birlingham, near Worcester, while still able to make 65 (with four sixes) against Solihull School when over seventy.<br>
<br>Jack Parsons died at 11 De La Hay Avenue, Plymouth, on 2 February 1981 and was cremated at St Martin's, Liskeard, three days later. The seriousness of purpose and the fulfilment of aims&#151;his philosophy of life&#151;were reflected in his cricket. There was perfection of technique in his batting and he belonged, in essence, to the classical era of cricket in the grace and formalism of his approach.<br>
