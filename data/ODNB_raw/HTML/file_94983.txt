<span class="headword">Watson,  George</span>  (1654&#150;1723), <span class="occ">accountant and benefactor</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 23 November 1654, the elder son of John Watson, merchant, and his wife, Marion Ewing (<i>d</i>. 1697), who were married on 26 September 1644. Following his father's early death and his mother's remarriage to a Mr Symmer, George and his brother James were brought up by their aunt Elizabeth, the wife of James Davidson of Curriehill, who was also a merchant.<br>
<br>On 2 April 1669 Watson was apprenticed to another merchant, John Clelland. He received tuition in a range of Italian and Dutch bookkeeping techniques and terminated his five-year indenture to train further in Holland, where Mrs Davidson's brother-in-law was conservator of the Scottish staple. Watson specialized in arithmetic, accounting, and bookkeeping, and also acted as agent for Scottish merchants. He returned to Edinburgh in 1676 and apparently never left the city again, probably due to a &#145;tender constitution&#146;. He was employed as accountant and secretary, and in due course trading partner, by James Dick of Priestfield, lord provost of Edinburgh from 1679 to 1681, and a Catholic supporter of James, duke of York (the future James VII and II), when the latter was effectively viceroy in Scotland. Dick's house was burned down by anti-Catholic rioters at Christmas 1680, and in compensation James appointed him a collector of customs; probably as a consequence of this, in 1682 Watson was appointed &#145;conjoint collector of customs&#146;. Dick's political fortunes declined but Watson remained his accountant until November 1696, while simultaneously trading and lending money on his own account.<br>
<br>Mrs Davidson died in 1688 and left Watson an annuity; he paid for her funeral. Watson's mother had outlived her second husband and from 1683 he supported his half-brother John Symmer, engaging in business with him. From 1695 until 1697 Watson lived in Greyfriars in a house with no servants, despite his wealth. However on the death of their mother in July 1697 Watson moved into Symmer's household, where he lived, unmarried, for the rest of his life, paying an annual rent of &pound;28.<br>
<br>In 1688 Watson received his burgess and guild ticket. His business interests were already distinctive. He chose not to become involved with the Darien scheme that attracted so much Scottish capital in the late 1690s. On 24 March 1696 Watson became the first accountant and bookkeeper of the Bank of Scotland, founded by act of parliament the previous July. At a general meeting held on 25 March 1697 the bank was forced to consider retrenchment in the context of the Darien Company's proposal to issue banknotes. Watson argued against such cuts, which included a reduction in both his staff and salary, and was dismissed. He did however retain the &pound;3000 Scots of bank shares which he had purchased the previous December and remained a member of the auditing committee which reported to the adventurers annually.<br>
<br>Watson's reputation for accounting was built on his highly cohesive systems, which could allow accessibility in the form of random checking and the speedy recall of loans. It could also facilitate knowledge of the vital ratio of banknotes to recallable assets, coin, bullion, and goods. Management of this ratio required a merchant's experience of seasonal patterns and also awareness of both domestic and international political circumstances. In 1689, for example, Watson's London trading contacts wrote to him making reference to the unsettling effects of political events on the exchange market. These skills were well developed through Watson's background and career, and his methods clearly improved with experience.<br>
<br>Watson was already trading to countries such as Italy. In November 1695 he joined with a London Scottish firm for a slave and ivory trading venture to Africa and the West Indies. They built a ship disguised as a frigate and &#145;fit to carry Negro's and elephants teeth&#146;  (Saville, 66). Since these plans were illegal under English law they were kept secret. Watson also illegally exported unclipped Scottish coin with which to buy up clipped English coin in anticipation of the silver recoinage of 1696. In 1713 he was still dispensing advice regarding the collection of Scots coins after the recoinage of 1708, in which the Bank of Scotland played a key role. He also made money from industrial investment, for instance in linen and wool. The New Mills woollen manufacture in East Lothian did not survive the union with England and closed in 1713. From 1702 to 1711 Watson was also treasurer of the committee that managed the Edinburgh ale tax.<br>
<br>However most of Watson's fortune came from banking. He owed much of his financial success to his ability to establish networks which survived the vicissitudes of internal and international political change. He was able to judge successfully when to avoid risk and when to take it, and indeed when to risk illegal activity. He negotiated bills of exchange with London, benefiting from the high margins in the remittance of funds, a high-risk trade about which the Bank of Scotland was cautious, as it required reliable political antennae. Watson also lent capital to many of the old Scottish aristocracy at a time when it was in short supply following the collapse of the Darien Company in 1700. Many of his creditors had lost money in the scheme, yet he &#145;recovered his debts with pertinacity&#146;  (Nish, 14).<br>
<br>Watson's religious allegiance was firmly presbyterian; he was a supporter of the revolution of 1688 and the Hanoverian succession in 1714. From February 1698 he and his half-brother were allocated seats in the Greyfriars Old Kirk, and he was described as &#145;for many years a constant hearer of the ministers of the Old Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Statutes and Rules</span>, xiii). His booksellers' accounts suggest he read widely in theological subjects. In 1711 he was appointed treasurer of the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SSPCK), established in 1709 to set up a system of presbyterian elementary schools in the highlands and islands. He received donations twice weekly and managed investments. He held the position until his death, a period that included the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1719.<br>
<br>Watson fell ill in the autumn of 1721 and was cared for in the house of his half-brother where he still lived. From February 1723 he was heavily medicated and attended by a nurse and a maid. He drew up his will on 9 February 1723. Watson had been one of the earliest benefactors of the Merchant Maidens' Hospital, established in 1706 by the Merchant Company of Edinburgh with funds gifted by Mary Erskine. Though never a member of the Merchant Company, he was treasurer of the hospital between 1702 and 1704, and a governor from 1700 to at least 1713. The relationship between the institutional support of the Merchant Company and the autonomy of the governors of the hospital provided a model that appealed to Watson. Consequently he followed Erskine's example in vesting his legacy in the Merchant Company, which, as a perpetual company established by royal grant in 1681, would ensure the continuation of a foundation of his own. He wrote to the Merchant Company on 16 February 1723 asking that his half-brother should become accountant for the &#145;hospital which is to bear my name&#146;  (Nish, 13).<br>
<br>On 21 March 1723 Watson wrote to the SSPCK resigning as treasurer on grounds of illness. He died in Edinburgh on 3 April 1723 and was buried on 8 April in the Old Greyfriars churchyard, where the site of his grave is marked by a plaque. His estate was reckoned at &pound;189,239 Scots (&pound;15,769 sterling), consisting largely of loans due for repayment by Scottish merchants and landowners. He also owned houses in Parliament Close and Fish Mercat Close and shops in the Exchange, valued at &pound;705 sterling. This amounted to a considerable fortune.<br>
<br>The motives behind the establishment of &#145;George Watson's Hospital&#146;, and for its administration being placed in the hands of the Merchant Company, derived from its founder's family background, possibly from his personal experience, and certainly from his trust that the Merchant Company would look after its own. The chief trustee of his will, John Osborn, was master of the Merchant Company for 1723&#150;4 and helped to ensure that his wishes were executed. The will provided 500 merks to the SSPCK and Trades Maiden Hospital, 3000 merks to Trinity Hospital, 5000 merks to Heriot's Hospital, and 830 merks to the Merchant Maiden Hospital. From the residue, &pound;100,000 Scots, increased in a codicil of 15 February 1723 to &pound;144,000 Scots, was left to build a new hospital &#145;for entertaining and educating of the male children and grandchildren of decayed merchants in Edinburgh&#146;  (Thomson, 17).<br>
<br>George Watson's will was ratified on 10 April by his niece Elizabeth Watson. Two of his relatives, descendants of his father's sister Margaret, challenged it on the grounds of Elizabeth Watson's mental condition, and subsequently on the grounds of conflict of interest by members of the Merchant Company, including those who had testified to Elizabeth's sanity. These challenges were finally rejected by Lord Cullen on 13 November 1723. The first text of the statutes of the new hospital was drawn up on 1 May 1724, followed by the declaration of the fundamental articles of the hospital. A seven-acre site for the hospital was purchased in 1738, and George Watson's Hospital received its first foundationers in 1741. In 1870 the hospital became a day school under the name of George Watson's College, and in 1974 it amalgamated with George Watson's Ladies College to become the co-educational school it is today.<br>
