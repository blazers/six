<span class="headword">Tobin,  James Webbe</span>  (1767&#150;1814), <span class="occ">slavery abolitionist</span>, was born at Stratford-sub-Castle, outside Salisbury, on 19 October 1767. He was the first of eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53030/', "James Tobin (1736/7&#150;1817)")</script>, a sugar planter and merchant of Nevis and Bristol, and his wife, Elizabeth Webbe (1744/5&#150;1824). When his parents left Salisbury in 1777 to manage the family plantations on Nevis he and his brothers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27484/', "George Tobin")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27485/', "John Tobin")</script> were brought up by their maternal grandfather and sent to King Edward VI School in Southampton until their parents returned from Nevis in 1784 and settled in Bristol, where Tobin may have attended the grammar school. Immediately after graduating BA from Wadham College, Oxford, in 1791 he visited revolutionary France. However, he may have come to share his brother John's growing disillusionment with both the violence in France and the increasing repression in England.<br>
<br>It seems probable that Tobin was involved in radical politics in England at this time, perhaps as a member of the London Constitutional Society, for it was suggested later that his father's partner, John Pinney, had been required to help him escape arrest by smuggling him out of the country to Philadelphia in February 1793. During this visit and before his return from Nevis in September 1794 his eyesight began to fail, a condition which plagued him for the rest of his life, ended his interest in the church as a profession, and led to the epithet &#145;Blind Tobin&#146;. From at least April 1796 he shared chambers with his playwright brother, John, at the Temple in London. About this time he re-entered radical circles becoming a devout follower of William Godwin, though later he grew disillusioned with Godwinian rationalism. It was probably through Basil Montagu, or perhaps through the sons of John Pinney, that Tobin became friendly with William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Robert Southey. Tobin may have visited the Wordsworths at Alfoxden in 1797 with Tom Wedgwood; he was certainly included by Coleridge in the original first line of &#145;We are Seven&#146; as the &#145;little child, dear brother Jem&#146;  (Moorman, 383&#150;5) although Tobin pleaded unsuccessfully with Wordsworth to drop the poem. About 1798 he began a lifelong friendship with Humphry Davy, who wrote an amusing account of Tobin's part in the experiments with nitrous oxide. Coleridge, meanwhile, was eager for Tobin and Davy to join him, along with Wordsworth and Southey, in a utopian colony abroad. Tobin contributed at least five poems to the second volume of Southey's <span class="italic">Annual Anthology</span> and urged Southey to produce a third. He also corresponded regularly with Coleridge, who stayed with Tobin at Barnard's Inn, London, in early 1804. However, later that year Coleridge began to believe that Tobin was an inveterate and mischievous gossip, and they fell out on the eve of Coleridge's departure for Malta over Tobin's constant advice on the subjects of health and debts. Shortly after this Tobin suffered a terrible blow with the death of his constant companion, his brother, John, in December 1804.<br>
<br>Tobin recovered some of his cheerfulness when he married Jane Mallet (<i>d</i>. 1837) on 8 September 1807 at St Botolph without Bishopsgate, London. They had at least four children. In 1809 the family moved to his father's plantation, Stoney Grove, on Nevis. Unlike his father Tobin was a fervent critic of slavery and became an advocate for its abolition. His correspondence with the abolitionist African Institution and others was responsible for the widespread publicity given to the flogging of thirty-two slaves by the notorious Edward Huggins in the public market in Charlestown, Nevis, on 23 January 1810, and to the subsequent acquittal of Huggins by a rigged jury of planters. In his correspondence Tobin advocated the right of free black people to vote and attacked the standard of justice in the islands as well as other practices. This stance led both to threats from planters and to the publicly expressed gratitude of the African Institution.<br>
<br>Tobin died on his father's plantation of a fever on 30 October 1814 and was buried a day later at St John Figtree, Nevis. His wife continued to play a role in the abolition cause since, when she left the island, she took with her to Bristol a free black man, Charles Hamilton, who had been enslaved illegally on the islands of St Barts and St Kitts and who had been freed by the courts.<br>
