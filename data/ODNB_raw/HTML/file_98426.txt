<span class="headword">Turnbull,  David</span>  (1793?&#150;1851), <span class="occ">journalist and slavery abolitionist</span>, was &#145;a native of Scotland&#146;  (Turnbull to Lord John Russell, 22 Jan 1841, TNA: PRO, FO 72/584), though his precise origins are uncertain. There is circumstantial evidence to suggest that he was the David Turnbull born at Glasgow on 2 July 1793, son of David Turnbull, grocer, and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Adam, but this cannot be established for certain. On the title-page of one of his publications he was described as &#145;M.A.&#146;, though it is not known at which university he graduated, his name not appearing in the graduation lists of Glasgow or Edinburgh. He was described as formerly resident in Glasgow before his marriage, on 18 August 1826, at Ballylesson, co. Down, to Elinor (1805?&#150;1843), daughter of Roger Casement, &#145;a man of great wealth and respectability in the county of Antrim, with whom I was previously connected by the marriage of my sister to his son&#146;  (ibid.). His sister Agnes was married to Elinor's brother, Hugh Casement. Following their marriage, David and Elinor moved to London and then to Edinburgh.<br>
<br>From 1830 Turnbull was a correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span> covering continental Europe; he lived for periods in Paris (1830 and 1831), The Hague (1831), and Brussels (1831). His known address in Paris confirms him as the author of an eyewitness account, <span class="italic">The French Revolution of 1830</span> (1830). In 1832 he was sent to Madrid, where he stayed for about two years. He supported the efforts of the British minister in Madrid, George William Frederick Villiers, to end the illegal slave trade in the Spanish colonies. This culminated in a treaty with Spain in 1835, reinforcing an earlier treaty of 1817 that had outlawed the slave traffic in the Spanish dominions with effect from 1820.<br>
<br>In late 1834 Turnbull returned to Paris, where he remained until 1837, when he resigned his position at <span class="italic">The Times</span> and moved temporarily to Britain, residing in London and co. Down. He continued to promote the anti-slavery cause as a member of the English Anti-Slavery Society. Between 1838 and 1839 he visited Demerara, Barbados, Trinidad, Jamaica, Port au Prince, and Cuba. His observations were published in 1840 as <span class="italic">Travels in the West</span>, dedicated to Villiers. They gave a detailed account of the illegal slave trade in the last two Spanish colonies, Puerto Rico and Cuba, pointing out that &#145;British capitalists, under the cloak of a foreign partnership, still assist in the trade&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 Feb 1840). Early in 1840 he took part in an anti-slavery deputation to the king of France, drawing attention to the continuance of slavery in French dependencies. In August 1840 he became a member of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, created to secure the abolition of the slave trade throughout the world.<br>
<br>Later in August 1840 Turnbull was appointed British consul in Havana, a position he held jointly with that of superintendent of liberated Africans at Havana, under the mixed commission for the suppression of the slave trade created by the treaty of 1817. He &#145;was the most outspoken abolitionist England ever sent to Cuba&#146;  (Corwin, 75). Despite the Anglo-Spanish treaties of 1817 and 1835, the slave trade to Cuba continued extensively, and as a recognized abolitionist Turnbull faced hostility from the Spanish colonial authorities and from British planters and merchants who had moved to Cuba, where they continued to employ slave labour (or benefited from it). On his arrival in Havana in November 1840 he endeavoured to find out the whereabouts of slaves illegally introduced after 1820, later claiming to have obtained the liberty of about 2000 slaves. Furthermore, he demanded the release of all slaves resident in Cuba who had been born in Britain or any of her colonies from 1807. His plan &#145;to overthrow this colossal grievance [the slave trade]&#146;, was founded on the idea of &#145;making the purchaser and possessor of an African slave insecure in the enjoyment of his unlawful acquisition that he is to be deterred from paying the price&#146;  (Turnbull to Palmerston, 13 March 1840, &#145;Select committee&#146;, 62&#150;3). Palmerston resisted Cuban pressure for Turnbull's removal, asserting that Turnbull's opinions &#145;are shared by the whole British nation&#146;  (Palmerston to Flores, 17 Aug 1841, Corwin, 76). Palmerston nevertheless cautioned him to be more tactful in correspondence with the Spanish colonial authorities:<blockquote>you write with so much bitterness of feeling; with so much of sneer and irony, that you excite a suspicion that you are actuated by some personal or vindictive motives as much as by a sense of duty &hellip; Moreover, you constantly exaggerate things, which require no exaggeration, and thus you defeat your own purpose. (Palmerston to Turnbull, 2 Aug 1841, Curry-Machado, 80)</blockquote>Turnbull travelled to other Cuban provinces, such as Matanzas, where slaves had been introduced illegally after 1820, to investigate reports that Africans kidnapped in Jamaica were subsequently taken to Cuba. The local colonial authorities at Matanzas disputed his authority, detained him on 13 November 1841, and ordered him to return to Havana. Pressure from Spain, and from British merchants and shipowners, led Lord Aberdeen, Palmerston's successor as foreign secretary, in February 1842, to separate the positions of consul and superintendent of liberated Africans, and to revoke Turnbull's appointment as consul. Aberdeen noted that Turnbull's proceedings at Havana had &#145;not been regulated by that spirit of moderation and discretion which your instructions enjoin&#146; and that &#145;the commercial interests of HM subjects in Cuba have suffered&#146; by the combination of the two offices, those trading interests requiring &#145;the entire and undivided attention of an individual of tact and experience&#146;  (Aberdeen to Turnbull, 10 Feb 1842, TNA: PRO, FO 72/608).<br>
<br>Turnbull's continuing anti-slavery activities as superintendent exposed him to death threats, and he sought refuge on HMS <i>Romney</i>, anchored at Havana. After two months confined to the ship his wife fell ill and he requested another posting. He moved in August 1842 to New Providence, Nassau, from where, in October 1842, he embarked on a risky mission to G&iacute;bara-Holgu&iacute;n in Cuba, in search of British subjects being kept as slaves in plantations belonging to British farmers. The local authorities were alerted and he was arrested, taken to Havana, and subsequently expelled from Cuba on 6 November 1842. Aberdeen now abolished the office of superintendent of liberated Africans in Cuba.<br>
<br>Turnbull returned to London and in January 1843 Aberdeen appointed him judge of the court of the mixed commission at Kingston, Jamaica, a post that had been created as a result of a treaty between Britain and Portugal for the suppression of the slave trade signed in July 1842. Kingston's proximity to Cuba raised further Spanish objections, and there were allegations that he was implicated in the Cuban <i>escalera</i> slave uprising in 1844. His involvement was never conclusively proved, and continues to arouse debate.<br>
<br>Turnbull's first wife died in Jamaica in December 1843, and he married there, on 1 August 1844, Alice, daughter of John Musson. His actions in Jamaica against the slave trade continued to be highly regarded by British abolitionists, and in March 1850 he returned to Britain to give evidence (7 May 1850) to a select committee of the House of Lords on the African slave trade, recounting details of his work. He also published <span class="italic">The Jamaica Movement for the Promoting of Slave-Trade Treaties</span> (1850). Palmerston requested him to seek support from French planters and merchants in the fight against the slave trade, and it was on this mission that he died in Paris, at 38 avenue Gabriel, Champs Elys&eacute;es, on 7 May 1851, following a long illness. The paper he had prepared to be read before the French Academy of Sciences in Paris was subsequently distributed among the academy's members. Palmerston paid tribute to him, referring to his death as &#145;a great loss to the slave trade suppression cause&#146;  (Murray, 219).<br>
