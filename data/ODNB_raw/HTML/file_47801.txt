<span class="headword">Lowndes,  Noble Frank</span>  (1896&#150;1972), <span class="occ">underwriter and insurance company manager</span>, was born on 28 August 1896 at Gisborne, New Zealand, the eldest of the six sons of Frank Forbes Lowndes, wool shipper, and his wife, Laura Louisa. After primary school, Lowndes worked in Gisborne in his father's firm, and later was employed by a large export firm in Auckland. At the outbreak of the First World War, Lowndes volunteered for the army and was sent to German Samoa, where he landed on his eighteenth birthday and raised the flag as a member of the 1st New Zealand expeditionary force. After six months he was invalided with tropical fever, and later, with the Anzacs, he was also wounded on the Western Front.<br>
<br>After the war Lowndes returned to New Zealand to work for his father's transport business, but this became bankrupt in the post-war depression, and Lowndes found employment selling life assurance in Auckland. Promoted to head the firm's pension unit, he attempted to promote more sophisticated employee benefit schemes such as combined pension, life, sickness, and accident insurance, but his employers objected. He resigned to join an Australian company, Mutual Life and Citizens, and moved to Sydney, where he became the youngest ever life manager for New South Wales. In 1928 he married Maisie Hennessy of Gisborne; but they were later divorced.<br>
<br>In 1932 Lowndes became manager of a newly opened branch of Mutual Life in London, but was again frustrated by opposition towards his underwriting ideas. In 1934 he therefore left Mutual Life to set up his own broking firm in London. His partners included his brothers Roy and Colin, and in 1938 the firm moved to 38 Lowndes Street in Belgravia, a street named after one of Lowndes's ancestors, a secretary to the Treasury under Queen Anne.<br>
<br>Over the next thirty-five years, Noble Lowndes &amp; Partners expanded to become an international business, specializing in the design of company pension schemes, insurance broking, and life assurance. By 1939 Lowndes was already regarded as one of the leading life insurance agents in the City of London. From the outbreak of the Second World War he enthusiastically promoted innovative endowment assurance schemes, under which premium contributions could be offset against the rising burden of taxation. He also persuaded insurance companies to issue full war-risk cover on all schemes arranged by his firm. After the war further innovations included the notorious &#145;top hat scheme&#146; of 1946, criticized as a form of tax evasion. Under this scheme the nominal salary of a senior executive was reduced, and the difference paid by the employer as a premium on an endowment assurance. The object was to maximize the amount of premiums paid towards the pension, at no extra cost to the employer, while reducing the amount of income lost to taxation.<br>
<br>By 1960 the success of this and other schemes had made Noble Lowndes the largest firm of pension consultants in the world. One in four British companies had a pension scheme devised by Noble Lowndes. The firm, which became a limited company in 1949, also expanded overseas, and business was extended to offer personal financial services to senior executives, most of whom came to Noble Lowndes through their pension schemes.<br>
<br>Although intensely proud of British traditions, Lowndes saw himself as a wild colonial boy who had come back to the mother country to make good. A staunch New Zealander, during the Second World War he had kept open house at his Warlingham home in Surrey for New Zealand and Australian fighter pilots based at Biggin Hill. He retired to Jersey in 1960, a few years before the firm of Noble Lowndes was taken over by the merchant bank Hill Samuel. In 1964 he declined the offer of a life peerage to join the new Labour government in a finance portfolio, because &#145;it would have been the icing on the cake for my Establishment foes in the City&#146;. He did, however, continue to act as an adviser to the government on national pensions. After his divorce from his first wife Lowndes remarried, and he and his second wife, Jane Hose, had a son and a daughter. He spent his leisure time sedately, gardening and playing bridge. He died in Jersey on 9 May 1972.<br>
