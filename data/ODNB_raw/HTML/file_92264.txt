<span class="headword">Kirk,  Alexander Carnegie</span>  (1830&#150;1892), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer and inventor</span>, was born in the manse of Barry, Forfarshire, on 16 July 1830, the eldest son in the family of three sons and one daughter of John Kirk (<i>d</i>. 1858), minister of Barry, and his wife, Christian Guthrie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carnegie (<i>d</i>. 1865). <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34336/', "Sir John Kirk (1832&#150;1922)")</script>, the naturalist who accompanied David Livingstone on his second Zambezi expedition, was his younger brother. The family became reduced in circumstances when John Kirk left the established Church of Scotland in the Disruption of 1843, relinquishing a comfortable home at Arbirlot, where he had been minister since 1837, to become Free Church minister at Barry. It was fortunate therefore that Kirk received a good education: initially at Arbroath Burgh Academy, followed by study for an arts degree at Edinburgh University from 1845, and evenings at Leith Mechanics' Institute.<br>
<br>In 1850 Kirk began a five-year apprenticeship at the Vulcan foundry of Robert Napier &amp; Sons on the Clyde, where many prominent marine engineers were to be trained. He left marine engineering in 1861 on appointment as chief draughtsman to Maudslay, Sons, and Field, London, though he returned to Scotland in the same year as an engineering manager in the burgeoning shale-oil industry working for James &#145;Paraffin&#146; Young, where he remained for five years. Young and his partners had opened one of the world's earliest commercial mineral-oil refineries in Bathgate in 1851. Trading originally as E. W. Binney &amp; Co.&#151;from 1866 as Young's Paraffin Light and Mineral Oil Co. Ltd&#151;these firms successively dominated the shale-oil industry until the late 1870s. Kirk was evidently aware of the technical challenges of the fledgling industry, and its potential, on moving back north to become Youngs' chief engineer. In 1876 Young's company produced nearly 4.5 million tonnes of oil.<br>
<br>In essence the shale-oil refining process comprised three steps: distillation, the key to the refining process for crude oil; chemical treatment of the distillation products with acid and alkali; and, if required, cooling and filtration to produce paraffin wax. The solid nature of shale required modified designs of retort&#151;which had been previously developed for the coal gas industry&#151;within which shale could be injected and removed in a &#145;continuous&#146; fashion, without blocking the retort and allowing the manual removal of spent shale. Kirk improved a vertical type of retort, first patented in 1839, which had a daily throughput of between 1125  and 1500 kilograms of shale and a yield of around 150 litres of oil per tonne of shale. Kirk produced a configuration of design whereby three retorts surrounded a central, coal-fired furnace, all enclosed in brickwork. A charging hopper for the crushed shale was mounted on top of each retort, and at the base a water bath acted as a seal and a quench for the hot spent shale that was removed. Steam was injected into the bottom of the vertical retorts to aid distillation efficiency, and the oil condensate was drawn off at the top and recovered. The Kirk retort was widely used but gradually superseded from 1877 by the Henderson retort, invented by N. M. Henderson (1839&#150;1917).<br>
<br>The paraffin wax was removed by cooling to about 25&deg;C, which made it crystallize, followed by pressure filtration and washing in naphtha and treatment with charcoal. Kirk was able to improve the cooling process by applying a refrigeration device he had invented in 1856 for chilling brine. In fact he had produced the first practical air-compression refrigerator, which was made under licence by the Norman Co. of Glasgow, and sold all over the world for ice making.<br>
<br>In 1865 Kirk joined the management of James Aitken &amp; Co.'s engine works in Glasgow, engaged in designing diverse machinery. He married, in Croydon in 1869, Ada Waller. In 1870 he left Aitkens and practised as a consulting engineer. He re-entered marine engineering in 1871 as engine works manager at Randolph, Elder &amp; Co., which was the creation of the brilliant marine engineer John Elder (who had also been trained at Robert Napiers). Elder, who died in 1870, invented the compound steam engine concept there, and patented it in 1856. The principle was to re-use the power of the piston-driving steam leaving the high-pressure cylinder by passing it through additional lower-pressure cylinders, thereby gaining in coal economy. The first trial of the principle was the installation of his new engine in the SS <i>Brandon</i> in 1854. Elder took out patent cover for two-, three-, and four-cylinder configurations, though it was left to others to demonstrate the full advantages of compound engines in the 1880s when technology had matured through, for example, the availability of high-pressure steel boilers. Kirk's contribution was to demonstrate practically the efficacy of the compound arrangement in triple-expansion form, with the launch in 1874 of the commercial steamer SS <i>Propontis</i>.<br>
<br>In 1877 Alexander Kirk left Elders on being appointed senior partner at the nearby shipbuilders Robert Napier &amp; Sons, a yard that had experienced mixed fortunes. In 1860 Robert Napier (1791&#150;1876) had retired, handing over to his two sons, under whose management the firm began to decline. Kirk brought to Napiers experience in compound engine design, and was in an admirable position to install them in his ships, now that early patents had expired. At Napiers, Alexander Kirk and his engine-works manager, Walter Brock, perfected the triple-expansion engine. Kirk secured a patent for this improved engine, but later relinquished his rights when others made claims to primacy. In 1881 one of his engines was lifted into the screw-propeller ship the SS <i>Aberdeen</i>, which was built by Napiers Govan East yard for George Thompson &amp; Co. This was the first steamer added to Thompsons' clipper fleet, and the ship's success in returning a 30 per cent economy in coal consumption vindicated their faith in the new propulsion method. Patent disputes apart, Kirk is generally credited with this first truly convincing demonstration of the triple-expansion steam engine.<br>
<br>The mercantile marine readily adopted the compound steam engine, as it provided better economy than existing propulsion units and thereby extended steamships' voyages, enabling them to surpass sailing ships. However, the Admiralty remained sceptical of the new approach until Kirk informed them that he had sold compound engines of around 12,000 ihp (indicated horse power) to the imperial Russian navy from 1883. The Admiralty responded by placing two orders for cruisers at Napiers: the first of these, the SS <i>Galatea</i>, performed above their expectations at trials in 1885.<br>
<br>The rival Clyde yards, Napiers and Elders (renamed Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. in 1886), suffered mixed fortunes, especially during the severe slump in British shipbuilding in the 1880s due to world trade fluctuations. Fairfields gained orders for two Cunard liners in 1891, each equipped with two sets of triple-expansion engines. The technical success of the triple-expansion engine was by then proven and with its successor, the quadruple-expansion engine&#151;developed by Kirk's colleague Walter Brock at the marine engineers Peter Denny of Dumbarton&#151;became the preferred propulsion units for the world's merchant fleets for the next fifty years.<br>
<br>Kirk's distinguished engineering career was recognized by Glasgow University with the award of an honorary doctorate of laws in 1888, and by service as president of the Institute of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland from 1887 to 1889 and as vice-president of the Institution of Naval Architects in 1888. He died at his home, 19 Athole Gardens, Kelvinside, Glasgow, on 5 October 1892, survived by his wife and their six children. His estate of about &pound;600 was relatively modest for an acclaimed engineer and entrepreneur, whose level of achievement is indicated by his progression from apprentice to senior partner in Robert Napier &amp; Sons in twenty-two years, and his thirty-seven patents.<br>
<br>Kirk's engineering skills made an enormous impact both on marine engine design for ocean-going vessels and on processing equipment for the shale-oil extraction industry, especially his refrigerator invention. His range of expertise spanned thermodynamics, mineralogy, chemistry, metallurgy, hydrodynamics, and mechanical engineering. The combination of inventive skill and management expertise gained him an enviable reputation that extended far beyond the confines of his native Scotland.<br>
