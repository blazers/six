<span class="headword">Andrews,  Thomas</span>  (1847&#150;1907), <span class="occ">metallurgist and ironmaster</span>, was born at 19 Carver Street, Sheffield, on 16 February 1847, the only son of Thomas Andrews and his wife, Mary Bolsover. Thomas Andrews senior was a partner in the Wortley ironworks and the Wortley Silkstone colliery, situated about 10 miles north-west of Sheffield.<br>
<br>The younger Andrews was educated at Broombank School and then received private tuition. He was carefully trained in metallurgy, mining, and chemistry (under Dr James Allan), before taking control of the Wortley forges (which had been at work since the seventeenth century) on the death of his father in 1871. Andrews took an active part in running the business, but he never<blockquote>evinced any ambition to embark on any extensions or improvements beyond what were necessary to maintain the old quality and workmanship in the limited output he cared to cope with. His mind and energy were devoted to the field of scientific research. (Andrews, 53)</blockquote>He married on 7 September 1870 Mary Hannah, the daughter of Charles Stanley of Rotherham, oil manufacturer; the couple had three sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Andrews developed a steady routine: after opening the morning's letters and consulting his managers, he devoted the remainder of the day to his metallurgical research, working usually from 9 a.m. until midnight. An equally steady stream of scientific papers issued from his pen, which meant that&#151;as one trade journal noted&#151;&#145;a review of his work is apt to develop into a catalogue of the titles of his contributions to contemporary scientific literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">Engineering</span>, 864). To the publications of the several engineering societies of which he was a member, and to the periodical press, he contributed some forty papers. These publications arose from Andrews's interest in the properties of iron and concerned such subjects as the electrochemical action of sea and river water upon iron and steel, and the effects of temperature on the strength of railway axles (one of the main products of his ironworks). He was much concerned with the problem of the accidental fracture of railway materials. In his researches, he was one of the first to study metals with the aid of a microscope, thus extending the pioneering metallography of Henry Clifton Sorby.<br>
<br>In 1888 Andrews was elected FRS and was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and of the Chemical Society, and a member, respectively, of the Institution of Civil Engineers and Society of Engineers. Among his other honours were the Telford medal of the Institution of Engineers in 1884 and the gold medal of the Society of Engineers in 1902.<br>
<br>In his day Andrews was recognized as one of the country's leading metallurgical experts. He was employed as a consultant engineer to various railway companies and the Admiralty also made use of his services. At Cambridge University he delivered lectures to engineering students. In Sheffield he was a consistent advocate of technical education directed to industrial ends; and by serving on its council he assisted in establishing and developing Sheffield University. On the other hand, his business was engaged in a losing battle with its new rival, the mild steel produced by the Bessemer and Siemens processes. Andrews's concentration on iron as an area of research also meant that his work has slipped more rapidly into obscurity than that of some his contemporary metallurgists, who worked with steel.<br>
<br>Andrews died at his home, Ravencrag, at Wortley, on 19 June 1907, aged sixty (his death hastened, according to his son, by overwork). Two of his sons died in childhood and the other, C. Reginald Andrews, was the chairman until 1918 of a small Sheffield tool steel firm owned by the family. This business was to survive the Wortley ironworks, which closed in 1929.<br>
