<span class="headword">Jermy,  Robert</span>  (1600&#150;1677), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son of John Jermy (1555&#150;1630), lawyer, of Gunton, Norfolk, and his wife, Helen (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Jermy). John Jermy was master of the Middle Temple and chancellor of Norwich. Jermy was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, entered the Middle Temple in 1621, and was called to the bar in 1629. He married Christian Cock (or Cooke). The details of his career may have been obscured by his descendants, squires of Bayfield, who may have sought to distance themselves from the civil war parliamentarianism of Jermy and his brother Francis.<br>
<br>From 1643 Jermy was a member of several Norfolk committees and commissions, including those for raising money for the parliamentarian cause, for sequestering the estates of delinquents, and for removal of scandalous clergy, and was a militia commissioner in 1648 and 1659. In 1648 he was probably the Major Jermy sent to suppress royalist stirrings at Great Yarmouth. In 1650 the royalist &#145;winter rising&#146; saw a gathering on Easton Heath, mainly of tradesmen, husbandmen, and artisans, intending to march upon Norwich. It was dispersed without bloodshed or violence, being a smaller and less powerful affair than expected, but the Commonwealth authorities wished to make much of it. Jermy was instrumental in the setting up of a high court of justice to deal with the royalists concerned, and was a member of this court. Thirty-four people were sentenced to death, including the Revd Thomas Cooper, an usher at Gresham's School, Holt, and William Hobart, son of the lord of the manor at Holt.<br>
<br>Jermy acted as a justice of the peace and in 1656 was one of those named to maintain the security of the lord protector, as well as serving as captain of the Norfolk militia. His son-in-law, Thomas Toll, recorder of King's Lynn and husband of his daughter Eleanor, also served on local committees. Jermy was chosen by the army council to represent Norfolk in the Barebones Parliament of 1653; in 1659 he was involved in the disputed parliamentary election for Castle Rising, but was admitted a member under a new writ in 1660 after the first election had been declared void. In March 1659 passes were issued for Jermy and Toll to travel &#145;beyond the seas&#146;, that is, to visit New England.<br>
<br>By now local hostility to Jermy was emerging. An anonymous &#145;loyal song&#146; attacked him for being &#145;a pitiful soldier&#146;, &#145;a cruel man&#146;, &#145;a rascal&#146;, and &#145;a coward&#146;, and accused him of corrupting the burghers of Castle Rising and having fled to New England. About the same time one John Armiger issued a proclamation addressed to the commissioners of the great seal, dealing with matters proved to a jury at Guildhall on 21 June 1656. This accused Jermy of showing preferential leniency to various people charged before him, of issuing violent prosecutions against Katherine Foxe, a widow whom he had helped materially but who refused to surrender her virtue to him, and of bringing an action against Armiger for saying &#145;You sit upon the Bench &hellip; to maintain roguery and villainy&#146;, which statement had been found to be justified by a jury sitting for the lord chief justice. Then, on 14 July 1660, Armiger petitioned the House of Lords for wrongs by Colonel Jermy who, after the previous jury had found for Armiger, had had him arrested on a trumped-up charge and sent as a slave to Jamaica, from whence he had escaped. Taking advantage of the restoration of Charles II, Armiger now sought reparation.<br>
<br>By 1661, however, Jermy had returned from abroad and taken up his manor of Bayfield, as seen by his presentations to the livings of Bayfield, Calthorp, and Letheringsett. In 1663, by command of Charles II, a letter was drafted for conferring a baronetcy on him, but the bill was never signed. His will, dated 4 April 1677, provides for his wife and several children but not for one of his sons, Revd John Jermy, from whom he was estranged for political reasons; Robert Jermy died in 1677. Coming from a privileged background, Jermy had been ambitious, seeking the powers of office. These he obtained under Cromwell, but he used his position unwisely, some of his actions being indiscreet and others even more questionable.<br>
