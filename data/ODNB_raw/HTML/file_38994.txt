<span class="headword">Cooper,  Frank</span>  (1844&#150;1927), <span class="occ">marmalade manufacturer</span>, was born on 12 November 1844 over his father's shop at 46 High Street, Oxford, the eldest surviving son of Francis Thomas Cooper (1811&#150;1862), hatter and tea dealer, and his wife, Decima (1819&#150;1857), daughter of Isaac Stone. Both parents came from the market town of Thame, 13 miles east of Oxford, where Francis's father had been an innkeeper and Decima's a builder. Encouraged by his brother Henry, who worked for the London tea-importing firm of Ridgways, Francis had for several years combined his hatter's business with an agency for Ridgways' teas; but in 1845 he abandoned the hatter's trade to become a grocer and dealer in tea and coffee. In 1856, after the decline and near closure of Oxford's former main coaching inn, the Angel, Francis Cooper moved his family and business across the road into two adjacent properties, formerly belonging to the Angel, at 83&#150;4 High Street, with his shop in the spacious, pillared former coffee room of the hotel at no. 84.<br>
<br>Following his father's death in 1862, the seventeen-year-old Frank Cooper and a widowed aunt were left in charge of the grocery shop. His mother had died five years earlier, and the family was cared for by a resident cousin from Thame. In 1872 Frank married Sarah Jane Gill (1848&#150;1932), daughter of John Gill, a Worcestershire farmer; she was connected on her father's side with the Gills and Wards, prominent Oxford coal-dealing and ironmongering families. Frank and Sarah had five children, one of whom died in 1903. Sarah Jane Cooper is traditionally credited with the manufacture of the first batch of Seville orange marmalade, which went on sale in the shop, in stoneware jars, in the spring of 1874. &#145;Her insistence on using Seville oranges &hellip; and her method of presenting the coarse-cut, chunky but well-macerated peel, produced a high-quality and excitingly bitter-tasting marmalade&#146;  (Allen, 33). Popular among undergraduates as a feature of the new, lighter breakfasts and as a source of energy for athletes in training, the distinctive &#145;Oxford&#146; marmalade became something of a late-Victorian cult food. Other Oxford grocers, and some of the colleges, followed the Coopers' example in manufacturing and selling their own marmalade; but the Coopers remained well ahead, adding jam to their output in the early 1880s, and mounting an extensive advertising campaign which stressed the purity of their marmalade and included sending samples to the smarter military messes, London clubs, and leading department stores. By 1884 Frank was displaying the royal arms, as a purveyor of marmalade to the prince of Wales, the future Edward VII; and in 1911&#150;12 tins of Oxford marmalade accompanied Captain Scott on his Antarctic expedition. A miniature jar of Frank Cooper's Oxford marmalade later found a place in Queen Mary's dolls' house at Windsor Castle.<br>
<br>Despite the increasing success of his marmalade business, Frank Cooper continued as a grocer and wine merchant until 1919, living on the premises of his shop in the High Street, until 1907, when he moved with Sarah Jane to a newly built Edwardian house, 155 Woodstock Road, Oxford. The jam and marmalade continued to be made on the shop premises, under Sarah Jane's supervision, until early in 1903, when (probably as a result of strictures on manufacturing conditions in the 1901 <span class="roman">Factory Act</span>) their production moved to a purpose-built factory in Park End Street, Oxford.<br>
<br>In 1913 Frank Cooper sold his personal interest in the manufacturing business for &pound;26,559 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to a newly constituted limited company, Frank Cooper Ltd, directed by himself, his sons, and his son-in-law. All the ordinary and preference shares were held by Cooper and members of his family. The eldest son, William Frank Cooper (1874&#150;1952), manager of the factory, became managing director; the youngest, Maurice, became company secretary; and the second son, Arthur, an engineer, sat on the board. This eventually included a few non-family members, but the business remained for the most part family-owned. Frank Cooper, as governing chairman, attended every board meeting of the company during the remaining fourteen years of his life, and regularly appeared at the factory in his chauffeur-driven Daimler car. Always careful, he was renowned among the workforce during his last years for his thriftiness, and had few obvious interests outside the business. He died at home in Oxford on 26 July 1927, leaving an estate valued at &pound;47,848 3<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> He was survived by his wife. The company remained independent until the early 1960s, when it merged with Brown and Polson Ltd, part of the American-owned CPC group of companies. A purpose-built factory, which was opened at Wantage, Berkshire, at this time, finally severed the manufacturing link between Cooper's marmalade and Oxford.<br>
