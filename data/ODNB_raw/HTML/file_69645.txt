<span class="headword">Rawlings <span class="st"> [Rawlins]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1703&#150;1767), <span class="occ">musician and music copyist</span>, was born &#145;about the year 1703&#146; according to information supplied by his grandson to John Sainsbury for his <span class="italic">Dictionary of Musicians</span> of 1824. It has been suggested that he may have been the son of the instrument maker and seller Mickepher Rawlings (or Rawlins), although no son named Thomas has been traced. He may, instead, have been the Thomas Rawlins, son of John and Martha Rawlins, who was baptized on 17 October 1703 at St Andrew's, Holborn, London.<br>
<br>According to his grandson, Rawlings was a &#145;scholar of the celebrated Dr [John Christopher] Pepusch&#146;, to whom he referred on at least one occasion as &#145;my Mastr&#146;  (Hunt. L., Stowe MS 87, p. 91), and it is likely that he was formally apprenticed to that renowned composer, antiquary, and teacher of music. Rawlings was employed by James Brydges, first duke of Chandos, from Michaelmas 1719 to some time in 1721 as a second violinist in an ensemble directed by Pepusch; his quarterly salary was &pound;7 10<i>s</i>. He continued to work with his teacher in the 1720s at John Rich's theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, where Pepusch was music director. Rawlings was a member of the band there by 5 November 1724 and appeared on the theatre's free list in succeeding years, on 19 November 1728 with both his sister and his wife, Elizabeth. No details are known of his wife's background, nor of the date or place of their marriage. In August 1737 he wrote that &#145;All my little family has been ill&#146;  (Rawlings to J. Harris, 13 Aug 1737, Hants. RO, 9M73/G557/1), implying that he had at least two children. These presumably included William, born to Thomas and Elizabeth Rawlins and baptized on 26 August 1732 at St Edmund King and Martyr in Lombard Street, and Ann, who as a married woman was left a bequest of &pound;20 by her godmother, her father's patroness Anne Temple (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Halsey), Lady Cobham. The birth of another son named William to Thomas and Elizabeth Rawlins, baptized on 24 November 1738 at St Michael Cornhill, may indicate that the elder William had died. Birth records have not been traced for Thomas Rawlings's son <a href="#cosubject_69644">Robert [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who became a professional musician.<br>
<br>In the 1720s Thomas Rawlings apparently formed a connection with the composer George Frideric Handel, whom he may previously have encountered at Cannons; according to his grandson, he &#145;performed at almost all Handel's oratorios, operas, &amp;c.&#146;  (Rawlings, 2.339). Records of these ensembles are almost completely lacking, but he was listed as a violist in the orchestra for the Foundling Hospital performance of <span class="italic">Messiah</span> in May 1754. By 1737 he had become music master to Handel's staunch supporter Lady Cobham, the wife of the distinguished general and politician Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham, and he was in August that year resident at the Cobham seat of Stowe, Buckinghamshire. In her will, dated 28 October 1759, Lady Cobham left &#145;to Mr Rawlins my old harpsicord that is at Stoke [<i>sic</i>] and all my Musick Books&#146;  (Hunt. L., Stowe Temple MS 16 (12)). Rawlings was also connected with another of Handel's patrons, William Freeman of Hamels, Hertfordshire, who died in 1750 leaving to &#145;Mr. Thomas Rawlins Musician all my musick&#146;  (Matthews, &#145;The organ&#146;).<br>
<br>Rawlings augmented his income as a performer and teacher by working as a music copyist. From correspondence with James Harris of Salisbury and his circle, it is clear that Rawlings was prepared to provide copies of Handel's music at a rate lower than that charged by the composer's principal copyist, John Christopher Smith the elder, and that he copied works from Lady Cobham's collection at Stowe and from material provided by Handel's librettist Charles Jennens.<br>
<br>Rawlings moved to Rich's new theatre in Covent Garden in 1732, and on the one surviving list of theatre musicians dated 22 September 1760 his daily salary was noted as 3<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. He received regular benefit nights at Covent Garden from 1738 to 1766. Rawlings was admitted to the king's musick on 17 January 1736, although he may have been serving as a deputy for some time before that, since payments to him can be traced from the previous year; his annual salary was &pound;40. The mistaken assertion that Rawlings entered the Chapel Royal as a singer in 1737 may derive from the confusion of him with the singer and violinist Peter Randall. On 28 August 1739 Rawlings was one of the original subscribers, together with Handel and Pepusch, to the Fund for Decayed Musicians, later called the Royal Society of Musicians.<br>
<br>According to William H. Husk in the first edition of <span class="italic">Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</span>, Rawlings was appointed organist at Chelsea Hospital on 14 March 1753. In 1763 <span class="italic">Mortimer's Directory</span> listed him as a member of the king's band living in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury. He was replaced in that ensemble on 10 April 1767, and his son William was granted administration of his estate on 6 June 1767. At the time of his death, which occurred in London, Thomas Rawlings was a widower still living in the parish of St George, Bloomsbury.<br>
<br>Thomas Rawlings's son <a name="cosubject_69644"></a><span class="headword">Robert Rawlings</span>  (1742&#150;1816)<span class="occ"></span> followed in his father's footsteps. According to information supplied to Sainsbury by Robert's own son, he was born in London in 1742 and studied music with his father and with the &#145;old Italian&#146; and &#145;very celebrated theorist&#146;  (Rawlings, 2.339) Barsanti (presumably the composer Francesco Barsanti). He may also have had an early appointment as organist of Chelsea College. At the age of seventeen he was appointed musical page to Prince Edward Augustus, duke of York, with whom he travelled on the continent until the latter's death in 1767. He returned to London, having already become a member of the Royal Society of Musicians on 1 May 1763. According to his son, he was personally appointed by George III as a violinist in the king's musick; the appointment took place on 5 January 1773. He was also, according to his son, appointed to Queen Charlotte's private band. About this time he married his wife, Jane, about whom no details are known beyond her name, revealed by the parish register at the baptism of their son <a href="#cosubject_69645">Thomas Augustus Rawlings [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>By 1783 Robert Rawlings was playing in the orchestra at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, and in 1784 he was presumably the &#145;Mr Rawlins&#146; who played second violin in the orchestra for the Handel commemoration. He may also have been the Rawlings listed among the second violins at the King's Theatre and the Pantheon in 1791, and he certainly played for the oratorio season at Covent Garden Theatre in March of that year. In May 1792 he played the violin in the annual benefit concerts at St Paul's Cathedral for the Royal Society of Musicians.<br>
<br>Doane's <span class="italic">Directory</span> of 1794 listed Robert Rawlings as residing at 15 Paddington Street in the parish of Marylebone and as participating in the king's musick and the Professional Concerts. He continued to play at the benefit concerts for the Royal Society of Musicians at least until 1806. He was replaced in the king's musick on 3 October 1816 and died seven days later; his wife had died before him. The administration of his estate was granted to his son Thomas Augustus Rawlings on 14 January 1817.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69645"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Augustus Rawlings</span>  (1774&#150;1849)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 18 November 1774 and baptized on 8 December 1774 at St George's, Bloomsbury, the son of Robert Rawlings and his wife, Jane. According to the information he supplied to John Sainsbury, he studied music with his father and for seven years, beginning at the age of thirteen, with the Austrian theorist Joseph Diettenhofer, who settled in London in 1780. As a young man he had some of his works performed at the Professional Concerts and met Franz Joseph Haydn on one of the aged composer's visits to London. By his own account, Thomas Augustus performed as a violinist and cellist for all the London concert organizations, including the opera and the Concerts of Ancient Music. He may also have been the Thomas &#145;Rawley&#146; who was listed as a member of the king's musick in 1793. On 2 November 1800 his father recommended him for membership in the Royal Society of Musicians, attesting that he &#145;Plays on the Violin, Tenor &amp; Violoncello &amp; pianoforte&#146;  (Matthews, <span class="italic">Royal Society</span>, 120). He performed at the annual benefit concerts for the Royal Society of Musicians in St Paul's Cathedral in 1811 and 1812.<br>
<br>In the 1790s Rawlings published a number of instrumental works, including a set of three piano sonatas and a concerto for piano, flute, and strings, as well as a <span class="italic">Cantata on the Death of the Late Unfortunate Marie Antoinette, Queen of France</span>. After 1800 he published mostly songs and smaller piano pieces. A detailed list of his works is given by Sainsbury.<br>
<br>On 11 August 1821 Thomas Augustus Rawlings married Mary Hughes (1787/8&#150;1848) at St Martin-in-the-Fields, and in 1839 he testified to the Royal Society of Musicians that he then had no children under the age of fourteen. He was one of the 100 significant British musicians who responded to Sainsbury's requests for their biographies in 1823, providing valuable information about his father and grandfather. Fran&ccedil;ois-Joseph F&eacute;tis, another music historian, reported meeting him in London in 1829. His career must have declined subsequently, as in 1838 he began receiving assistance from the Royal Society of Musicians. By the terms of his will, dated 24 November 1840, he left a house at 4 Exeter Row, Fulham, to his wife. He was then living at 20 Paul Street, Portman Market. His wife died at 31 Exeter Street, Lisson Grove, on 22 January 1848 aged sixty; the Royal Society of Musicians provided &pound;8 19<i>s</i>. for her funeral. Rawlings died of dropsy at the same address on 19 January 1849. His will was proved on 30 January 1849, and administration was granted to his executor Susanna Roberts, the widow of William Roberts.<br>
<br>A James Henry Rawlins, who may have been a relation, was recommended for membership in the Royal Society of Musicians on 2 December 1781, his reference asserting that he had served a musical apprenticeship, played the violin, viola, and clarinet, was married, and was then twenty-four years of age. Presumably he was the James Henry Rawlins who had married Mary Mann at St George's, Hanover Square, on 10 December 1776. He was accepted into the society on 3 February 1782. Doane's <span class="italic">Musical Directory</span> of 1794 lists him as a cellist living at 15 Paddington Street, which was also the address of Robert Rawlings, and credits him with membership in the queen's band and the orchestra for the Handel commemorations in Westminster Abbey (although he is not named as a cellist in Burney's list of participants in 1784). He took part in the benefit concerts for the Royal Society of Musicians in May 1794.<br>
<br>On 7 December 1794 James Henry Rawlins petitioned the Royal Society of Musicians for assistance, stating that he was then the father of one son and five daughters. He continued to receive aid until his death in 1807, and on 6 September 1807 the society gave &pound;8 for his funeral. His widow was given a monthly pension of &pound;2 12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. until her death, and on 3 July 1819 the society granted &pound;8 for her funeral.<br>
