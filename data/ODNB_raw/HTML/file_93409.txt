<span class="headword">Mifsud, Sir  Ugo Pasquale</span>  (1889&#150;1942), <span class="occ">prime minister of Malta</span>, was born in Valletta, Malta, on 12 September 1889, the son of Gio Batta Mifsud (1859&#150;1910), judge, and his wife, (Philomena) Marianna, otherwise Marianne, daughter of C. M. Muscat, president of the chamber of commerce in Malta. After attending the lyceum in Valletta and graduating in law at the University of Malta (where for four years he was president of the university students' representative committee) in 1910, Mifsud pursued a successful career at the bar, specializing in international law, an area of expertise in which he achieved international recognition.<br>
<br>Mifsud first became involved in politics in 1919 at a time of post-war socio-economic distress and heightened political anticipation, in Malta as elsewhere throughout the British empire. Regarded as a moderate, he was elected secretary of the national assembly, meeting in Valletta at the Giovine Malta club&#151;led by the other, more Italophile contestant, Enrico (Nerik) Mizzi&#151;where this constituent assembly had set itself the task of drawing up a new constitution for self-government. In the first general election to the new legislative assembly under the &#145;Amery&#150;Milner&#146; constitution in 1921, Mifsud was returned for Ignazio Panzavecchia's Unione Politica Maltese (UPM), becoming minister for industry and commerce. In 1921&#150;3 and again in 1924 he became leader of the house, in the latter year becoming also leader of the UPM and prime minister of Malta (Malta's third, after Joseph Howard and Francesco Buhagiar). He also took ministerial charge of finance (1924&#150;6) and then justice (1926&#150;7). Measures enacted during the first two self-government legislatures included policies on emigration, industry, tourism, compulsory school attendance, and the simultaneous teaching of English and Italian, and attempts at reviving commercial activity by balancing defence with merchant demands in shipping, anchorage, and clearance rights in the main harbours. In 1926 Mifsud negotiated a pact with Mizzi's party to refound the Partito Nazionale (PN). This had originally been founded by Mizzi's father, Fortunato, on an anti-reformist, anti-assimilationist platform in 1880; it had later split into two main factions, the more moderate UPM and the more radical Partito Democratico Nazionalista (PDN) under Enrico Mizzi. Mifsud became co-leader, with Mizzi, of the reunited Nationalist Party. It was Mifsud, however, who always remained the senior partner, generally regarded as more inclined towards a <i>modus vivendi</i> and less of a firebrand.<br>
<br>Mifsud was knighted in 1927, but in the same year lost office to the Constitutional Party of Sir Gerald Strickland (later Lord Strickland) and became leader of the opposition. In 1928 he married Malvina Beatrice (Blanche) Francia (<i>d</i>. 1964), the daughter of Colonel John Lewis Francia, a wealthy Gibraltar-born, British-educated mill owner and banker having long business and family connections with Malta, whose property had been ransacked during the unrest in 1919 known as the <i>Sette Giugno</i>, when British troops killed a number of demonstrators. While remaining active in opposition, Mifsud furthered his professional interests, publishing in the <span class="italic">London International Law Notes</span> and participating engagingly, even prominently, in a string of International Law Association conferences in Europe and North America. (He was a lifelong friend of Constantine Colombos, a Valletta-born barrister at the inns of court and a scholarly jurist of Greek descent who would later sponsor an imposing life-size monument to Mifsud in white marble by a leading sculptor at the Mall Gardens in Floriana, just outside the capital.) He was also president of the La Valette Band Club, practically a Nationalist leader's prerequisite since the nineteenth century, and he could hardly avoid being embroiled, if indirectly, in some local squabbles, particularly at a time of intense internecine imperialist&#150;nationalist and church&#150;state rivalry.<br>
<br>As Lord Strickland's controversial term of office approached its end in 1930 Mifsud was anticipating a return to office, but the colonial authorities cancelled the election half-way through the campaign because of an ecclesiastical interdict on Strickland and his party, a turn of events that involved the papacy as much as Westminster and Whitehall. The constitution was restored in 1932, and Mifsud led the Nationalists to a landslide victory, becoming prime minister for the second time. At the head of a Nationalist delegation which included Mizzi (now minister of education), he proceeded to London to demand dominion status for Malta, a demand that the British government would not countenance. On the contrary, in 1933 it dismissed the cabinet and again suspended the constitution, alleging (but weakly) that there had been financial mismanagement and, more pointedly if exaggeratedly, that plans were afoot to permit once again the teaching of Italian (by means of voluntary evening classes) in what the British regarded as a fortress colony, so close to Italy. Security concerns mounted, not without a degree of paranoia sometimes confusing linguistic or cultural affinity with political allegiance, as the international situation worsened in the 1930s, all the more so at the time of the Abyssinian war, when Anthony Eden led the campaign for the League of Nations to impose economic sanctions on Italy, infuriating Benito Mussolini and making him more popular than ever in his own country. Such tensions necessarily had a deep resonance across the political spectrum in Malta.<br>
<br>Mifsud was returned to the council of government under a crown colony constitution&#151;which was finally conceded in 1939&#151;similar to that of 1849. This time, however, in a changed political climate and for other reasons, the pro-British Strickland-led party gained a majority of seats. Although Italian had been central to Maltese education, religion, culture, and society for centuries before the advent of fascism in Italy, Anglo-Italian tensions became <i>a fortiori</i> a handy stick with which to beat the Nationalists, including Mifsud, although he had never harboured any irredentist inspiration or ambition.<br>
<br>On 9 February 1942 Mifsud delivered one of the most outstanding speeches ever heard in the tapestry chamber in the former grand master's palace, when he authoritatively quoted constitutional and international law and precedent to oppose as <i>ultra vires</i> a rushed <span class="roman">Emergency Powers (Removal of Detained Persons) Bill</span>, which was intended to deport Maltese from Malta on grounds of suspected possible disloyalty to the British crown in wartime. Hundreds of Maltese had already been interned or earmarked for internment and, as it soon turned out, scores of them, from Mizzi and the chief justice to dockyard workers, would be deported to Uganda without charge or trial. While passionately imploring the council not to pass such an unconstitutional piece of legislation Mifsud suffered a heart attack and collapsed; he died two days later. He was buried in the cemetery at Lija. Only one elected member of the council, Giorgio Borg Olivier, who would lead Malta to independence in 1964, had the courage to vote against the government's deportation ordinance so eloquently denounced by Mifsud. The other Nationalist elected member, Mizzi, had already been arrested and interned, and was deported shortly after.<br>
