<span class="headword">Willoughby <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>de Salinas]</span>,  Maria</span>, Lady Willoughby de Eresby  (<em>d.</em> 1539), <span class="occ">noblewoman and courtier</span>, was the daughter of Martin de Salinas and Josepha Gonzales de Salas, who were probably related of the Castilian royal family. Although she was not included in Katherine of Aragon's household list drawn up in 1500, Maria probably accompanied her to England in 1501 for her marriage to Arthur, prince of Wales. While the date of Maria's arrival remains unknown, it seems unlikely that she would have joined Katherine's household after the prince's death in 1502, when his widow was in financial difficulties. Possibly Maria was one of the Spanish ladies Isabella of Castile added to her daughter's household in March 1501, when she decided to increase their number. By 1511 Maria was certainly in England, for that year she was godmother to Mary, daughter of Charles Brandon, afterwards duke of Suffolk, and his first wife, Anne Browne. In 1514 Luis Caroz de Villaragut, ambassador of Katherine's father, Ferdinand of Aragon, complained about Maria's influence over his daughter, who by now was Henry VIII's queen. According to Villaragut, Maria was conspiring with her kinsman Juan Adursa, a merchant in Flanders who hoped to become treasurer to Philip, prince of Castile, to dissuade Katherine from co-operating with him and to encourage her to favour her English subjects instead.<br>
<br>On 5 June 1516, having been naturalized on 29 May, Maria was married at Greenwich to William, tenth Lord Willoughby de Eresby, as his second wife. For her marriage, the king granted her Grimsthorpe and other Lincolnshire estates, and Suffolk served as feoffee on her jointure. At the wedding Henry also gave an offering of 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. For some years Maria remained at court, and attended the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520. In 1522 a ship called the <i>Mary Willoby</i>, which may have been named after her, formed part of the Royal Navy. Her two sons, Henry, the king's godson, and Francis, possibly the namesake of the French king, Fran&ccedil;ois I, both died as infants. Her sole surviving child was her daughter, Katherine, born on 22 March 1519 at Parham, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Lord Willoughby died on 19 October 1526 and was buried at Mettingham, Norfolk, although he had requested burial at Spilsby, Lincolnshire. Thereafter his widow struggled to maintain her daughter's rights as heir-general against the claims as heir male of her brother-in-law Sir Christopher Willoughby. Some lands her husband had settled on Lady Willoughby had previously been entailed to Sir Christopher, whose legal claim to them was strong. The resulting dispute with her brother-in-law, which erupted into violence shortly after her husband's death, led to a series of lawsuits in chancery and Star Chamber. Sir Thomas More made a preliminary settlement, placing some of the manors in the hands of the two disputants, where these could be identified as Lord Willoughby's intended recipients of them. The profits of other manors were sequestrated, until in 1531 More distributed some of these properties to Lady Maria and Sir Christopher. The duke of Suffolk had obtained Katherine's wardship with the intention of marrying her to his heir, Henry Brandon, earl of Lincoln, and with Cardinal Wolsey's assistance he supported Lady Willoughby's efforts. Then, in September 1533, after the death of his wife, Mary Tudor (whose funeral Lady Willoughby attended), Suffolk himself married Katherine. No doubt it was the duke's intervention which led to a parliamentary act in 1536 treating Lady Maria more generously than Sir Christopher. Nevertheless, the dispute was not fully resolved until 1565.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in December 1533, after the king's marriage to Anne Boleyn, Lady Willoughby informed Eustace Chapuys, the imperial ambassador, that her son-in-law was reluctant to fulfil his commission to require Katherine of Aragon to accept the annulment of her marriage. Two years later, upon learning of the ex-queen's illness, Lady Willoughby repeatedly but unsuccessfully requested a licence to visit her at Kimbolton. Finally, she journeyed from her London property of Barbican or Bas Court to Kimbolton, where she arrived about 6 p.m. on 1 January 1536. Sir Edmund Bedingfield admitted her, but only after she proclaimed that the injuries she had suffered from falling from her horse prevented her from travelling any farther. She remained with Katherine until the latter's death on 7 January, and with her daughter attended her funeral. Lady Willoughby herself died between 7 and 20 May 1539; it is not known where she was interred, but the story of her loyalty to Katherine fuelled the legend that she was buried with her in Peterborough Cathedral.<br>
