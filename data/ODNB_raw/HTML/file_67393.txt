<span class="headword">Elliot,  John Herbert</span>  (1918&#150;1997), <span class="occ">television scriptwriter and producer</span>, was born on 4 July 1918 at 122 Castle Hill, Reading, the son of Herbert Benbow Elliot (1890&#150;1965), then serving as a captain in the eleventh battalion of the tank corps, later a businessman, and his wife, Isabel Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Palmer (1889&#150;1969). He was educated at Berkhamsted School and was reading English literature at King's College, London, when the Second World War was declared. He registered as a conscientious objector but subsequently volunteered for the Royal Army Medical Corps. As a corporal he was involved in the evacuation from Dunkirk. He later served in the Middle East and South Asia, and, having been commissioned, served as public relations officer for the commander-in-chief, Ceylon. On 31 August 1945, during leave back in Britain, he married Margaret Elizabeth Haynes (<i>b</i>. 1919), who had been a fellow student at King's. She was the daughter of Maurice Holford Haynes, businessman; they had a son, Simon, and two daughters, Julia and Catherine.<br>
<br>After the war Elliot spent a year in the public relations directorate of the War Office before being demobilized with the rank of major. He then worked for a small film company until in 1949 he joined the BBC's television service at Alexandra Palace. He remained with the BBC for more than twenty years, working as a sequence manager, writer, and producer, except for a brief secondment in 1954&#150;5 to the United Nations in New York as film and television liaison officer. On the death of George VI in 1952 he produced the first television obituary of a British monarch. He was also responsible for Sir Winston Churchill's television obituary in 1965. In 1954 he made <span class="italic">War in the Air</span>, the first documentary film series that the BBC had made and the first major series about the Second World War made by British television. He later said that he approached it as a pacifist rather than as someone making a chronicle of victory.<br>
<br>On his return from New York in 1955 Elliot joined the BBC's drama department as a scriptwriter&#150;producer. One of his first programmes was the pioneering drama documentary <span class="italic">A Man from the Sun</span> (1956), which looked at the lives of West Indian settlers in post-war Britain. He said: &#145;I thought that the clash between this mythical Britain and the actual grotty real Britain, which West Indians would face when they got here, was a terribly important and exciting conflict&#146;  (Pines, 86). He spent the summer of 1956 researching in Brixton and in other parts of London where there were West Indian communities:<blockquote>I just nosed around sinking into the background, talking and listening to people, going to parties, to church, to work, and generally being a fly-on-the-wall &hellip; and I turned it into a script &hellip; Up until <span class="italic">A Man from the Sun</span> there had been no real attempt to do programmes about race relations in this country &hellip; It proved to be a bit of a landmark. (Pines, 86&#150;9)</blockquote>The cast included many of the leading black actors of the day, such as Cy Grant, Nadia Cattouse, Earl Cameron, and Pauline Henriques. The Trinidadian Errol John took the lead role, and in 1963 Elliot offered him the rare opportunity for a black writer to write an original drama for BBC television, resulting in <span class="italic">The Dawn</span>. Four years later Elliot was approached by the head of programmes for BBC Birmingham to write and produce a six-part drama series about West Indians, <span class="italic">Rainbow City</span> (1967). Errol John again played the chief character, a lawyer with a white wife, living in a racially mixed community in Birmingham. &#145;This was different, a shift of gear from how these things had been presented before&#146;, Elliot noted  (ibid., 89).<br>
<br>Throughout the 1960s Elliot was associated with a number of other ground-breaking BBC television dramas. These included the science fiction classic <span class="italic">A for Andromeda</span> (1961), which he co-wrote, and <span class="italic">Mogul</span> (1965&#150;72, renamed <span class="italic">The Troubleshooters</span> from the second series, starting in 1966), a long-running oil industry drama series which he created and scripted. From 1967 to 1970 he was employed by the BBC as head of programmes, later becoming acting controller for the South and West region, based in Bristol. In 1970, in the face of major changes in regional programming, he resigned and became one of the first former BBC television producers to form a limited company. He went on scripting and making programmes, and was the creator and writer of <span class="italic">Fall of Eagles</span> (1974), an acclaimed thirteen-part BBC drama series about the collapse of the German, Russian, and Austro-Hungarian empires during and after the First World War. Leonard Miall later described him as &#145;one of the medium's most talented pioneers&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 22 Aug 1997).<br>
<br>In 1951 a documentary Elliot edited (and John Read directed) about the sculptor Henry Moore won the BBC its first international television award at the Venice Festival. In 1959 he received an award from the Guild of Television Producers and Directors, and in 1970 he received the Shell International television award. He lived latterly at 14 Royal York Crescent, Clifton, Bristol, and he died there on 14 August 1997 of bronchopneumonia, having also been suffering from Parkinson's disease. He was survived by his wife, Margaret, and their two daughters, his son having predeceased him.<br>
