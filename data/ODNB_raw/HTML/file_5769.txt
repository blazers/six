<span class="headword">Cockburn, Sir  George</span>  (1763&#150;1847), <span class="occ">army officer and writer</span>, eldest son of George Cockburn, and his wife, the eldest daughter of Charles Caldwell and a sister of Admiral Sir Benjamin Caldwell GCB, was born in Dublin. He was commissioned ensign in the 1st, afterwards the Grenadier Guards, on 9 May 1781, and in 1782 went to Gibraltar, where he was aide-de-camp to General Eliott during the siege. For his services he was promoted captain-lieutenant in the 105th regiment in 1784, and transferred in 1785 to the 65th, then quartered in Dublin. His new colonel, the earl of Harrington, took a great fancy to the young man, and instead of letting him go to Canada with the rest of the regiment in June 1785, he kept him at home for recruiting duties, and sent him to study the Prussian autumn manoeuvres. In the following years he went to Austria, France, and in 1788 to Spain for the same reason, and in March 1790 was promoted captain in the 5th (Royal Irish) light dragoons. He married in 1790 his cousin Elizabeth Riall (1771&#150;1851), the eldest daughter of Phineas Riall, of Heywood, co. Tipperary, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Caldwell, of Dublin. In the same year he was made major of the royal Irish independent invalids, and in November 1793 was transferred to the 92nd, of which he purchased the lieutenant-colonelcy in the following month, and soon after went on half pay. In 1797 he was promoted colonel, in 1803 major-general, and from 1806 to 1810 held a command in the northern district.<br>
<br>In April 1810 Cockburn was appointed to the command of a division in the army of occupation in Sicily, and took charge of Messina, but his period of command was short, and in November, on his promotion to lieutenant-general, he had to resign. Previously, however, he had been present at the defeat of Cavaignac's division when it attempted to land in Sicily, but the chief credit for this action is due to the adjutant-general, James Campbell. Cockburn then travelled in Sicily, and on his return to England published two illustrated volumes called <span class="italic">A voyage to Cadiz and Gibraltar, up the Mediterranean to Sicily and Malta in 1810 and 1811, including a description of Sicily and the Lipari Islands, and an excursion in Portugal</span>.<br>
<br>On leaving Sicily, Cockburn settled down at Shanganah Castle, near Bray, co. Wicklow, which he had purchased, and began to devote himself to politics. He was initially a radical reformer and admirer of Cobbett, and erected a column in his grounds in memory of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, which he speedily demolished when the whigs ceased to please him. He became a supporter of Sir Robert Peel. In 1821 he was made a KCH by George IV, and in 1831 William IV made him a GCH, more for his activity as a magistrate than for his military services. In 1843 he published a pamphlet, praised at the time, <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the State of the British Finances</span>, in which he advocated banknotes be issued by government and not the Bank of England. In 1846 he issued another, in which he examined such historical puzzles as Hannibal's passage over the Alps, and the authorship of the <span class="italic">Letters of Junius</span>, which he ascribed, on the testimony of Dr Parr, to Charles Lloyd. In 1821 Cockburn was promoted general. When he died at Shanganah Castle, on 18 August 1847, he was fourth general in seniority in the British army.<br>
