<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cape,  (Herbert) Jonathan</span>  (1879&#150;1960), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born in London on 15 November 1879, the youngest of the seven children of Jonathan Cape, builder's clerk of Cumbrian origin, and his wife, Caroline Page. He received little formal education, and at the age of sixteen he started his career as an errand-boy for Hatchards bookshop in Piccadilly. Four years later, in 1899, he joined the English house of the American publishers Harper &amp; Brothers, where he worked as a travelling salesman, first in the provinces and later in London. In 1904 he moved to the English publisher Gerald Duckworth as London traveller, and later became manager. On 13 June 1907 he married Edith Louisa (1880/1881&#150;1919), the daughter of Francis Creak, an ironmonger. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>In the First World War, Cape served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, where he reached the rank of captain. After the war he returned to Duckworth, but early in 1920 he went as manager to the Medici Society: its chief products were coloured reproductions of paintings, with some book publishing on the side. There he met George Wren Howard, fourteen years his junior, who after taking a degree at Cambridge had fought in the war and was now learning the business. Cape quickly saw that Howard had a fine sense of design in book production, as well as a good business head; the two became friends and allies. After some months they decided that there was no future for them where they were, and that they had better start a new firm of their own. Howard managed to borrow his share of their exiguous starting capital from his father; Cape with no such resource was compelled to look elsewhere. All the time he had been with Duckworth the firm's most profitable author had been Elinor Glyn, and Cape had always advocated cheap editions of her books, which Duckworth had steadfastly refused to issue. Cape persuaded Duckworth to lease him the &#145;shilling rights&#146; of Elinor Glyn's books, which he republished under the imprint Page &amp; Co.: the profits of this venture helped to provide Cape with his share of the necessary capital.<br>
<br>One thing more was needful: a literary adviser, and for this Cape and Howard engaged Edward Garnett (husband of Constance Garnett), the ablest and most influential publisher's reader of recent time, whom Cape had known at Duckworths. He stayed with Cape until his death in 1937, and it was largely his literary judgement, coupled with Howard's production, which gained the new firm its outstanding reputation for quality during the next two decades.<br>
<br>The firm of Jonathan Cape opened its doors at 11 Gower Street, Bloomsbury, London, on 1 January 1921, and its first publication was a reissue of <span class="italic">Travels in Arabia Deserta</span> by C. M. Doughty, originally issued in 1888 with no success. This new edition, in two volumes at the huge price of 9 guineas, seemed so risky that it was initially issued jointly with the Medici Society. But its success was prompt and substantial, and long before its appearance it had won the new firm one of its strongest supporters. Knowing that T. E. Lawrence was interested in the book, they persuaded him to write a long introduction for nothing. This eventually led to the firm's publishing Lawrence's <span class="italic">Revolt in the Desert</span> (1927), <span class="italic">Seven Pillars of Wisdom</span> (1935), and <span class="italic">The Mint</span> (1955).<br>
<br>In 1922 Cape purchased the business of A. C. Fifield, a small publisher of independence and judgement, thus adding the works of Samuel Butler, H. G. Wells, Laurence Housman, Lancelot Hogben, and W. H. Davies to his growing list. Cape also regularly visited the United States in search of books, and he led the London publishing industry in importing work by American authors. He was the English publisher of three future Nobel prize-winners (Sinclair Lewis, Ernest Hemingway, and Eugene O'Neill), as well as H. L. Mencken, Sherwood Anderson, Louis Bromfield, Dorothy Canfield, Robert Frost, Carl Sandburg, Edna St Vincent Millay, Margaret Mead, Lewis Mumford, Herman Wouk, and James M. Cain. In 1929 he went into partnership with Harrison Smith to set up a short-lived American company, which published William Faulkner's <span class="italic">As I Lay Dying</span> (1930).<br>
<br>In 1925 Cape's firm moved to its lasting home at 30 Bedford Square, from which in due course appeared the first, and most of the subsequent, works of H. E. Bates, Duff Cooper, Eric Linklater, J. E. Neale, and C. V. Wedgwood. The children's books of Hugh Lofting and Arthur Ransome were perennially successful, and when Cape heard that Stanley Baldwin was planning to speak at the Royal Literary Fund dinner about <span class="italic">Precious Bane</span> (1924) by Mary Webb, which Cape had published, he speedily bought the rights of her earlier books from their original publishers and reissued them in an immensely popular collected edition. Cape's many cheap series, of which the <span class="roman">Travellers' Library</span> was the most prominent, set a new standard of quality and appearance, and held the field until the arrival of paperbacks. Ten of the first Penguin books were Cape titles: he soon came to regret selling the rights, since the resulting paperback revolution killed his own hardcover reprints.<br>
<br>Several Cape books won the James Tait Black memorial prize, including Percy Lubbock's <span class="italic">Earlham</span> (1922), Liam O'Flaherty's <span class="italic">The Informer</span> (1925), and E. H. Young's <span class="italic">Miss Mole</span> (1930). He also published Robert Graves's <span class="italic">Goodbye to All That</span> (1929), James Joyce's <span class="italic">Stephen Hero</span> (1944), Arthur Koestler's <span class="italic">Darkness at Noon</span> (1940), and works by Roy Campbell, Christopher Isherwood, Henry Williamson, Andr&eacute; Maurois, Malcolm Lowry, and Alan Paton.<br>
<br>On 1 October 1927 Cape married again; his second wife was Olyve Vida (1894/1895&#150;1931) who had been an employee in the firm. She was the daughter of M. G. Blackmon, and had recently divorced her first husband, Thomas James. They went on to have a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Cape won notoriety by publishing Radclyffe Hall's lesbian novel <span class="italic">The Well of Loneliness</span> (1928), an affair he handled with questionable judgement. When a reviewer, James Douglas, denounced the book as pornographic, Cape appealed to the home secretary, Sir William Joynson-Hicks, who predictably threatened to ban it. Cape then announced that he would cease publication, but he leased the rights to a Parisian press, which smuggled copies into Britain until they were seized by the police. In the subsequent trial Cape's barrister bungled the defence, and the novel was ruled obscene. Fearful of another clash with the censors, Cape was to pass up the opportunity to publish work by Samuel Beckett, Norman Mailer's <span class="italic">The Deer Park</span> (1955), and Vladimir Nabokov's <span class="italic">Lolita</span> (1955). He also expurgated fiction by Hemingway and Irwin Shaw. Although he had a low opinion of <span class="italic">Casino Royale</span> (1953), Cape took on Ian Fleming's James Bond thrillers, which eventually sold millions and generated nearly all of the firm's profits.<br>
<br>Ten years after the death of his second wife, Cape married again, on 16 October 1941. His third wife was Kathleen Mary Webb (1906/1907&#150;1953), the widowed daughter of Philip Wilson, a former librarian at the British Museum. They had one son.<br>
<br>Cape knew his own limitations and stuck to what he knew: general publishing and high-quality books (never attempting to enter the educational, technical, or specialist markets, of which he was ignorant), and his standard remained unusually high. In this he was helped, first by Edward Garnett, and later by the diverse talents of Hamish Miles, David Garnett, Guy Chapman, J. E. Neale, C. V. Wedgwood, Daniel George, and William Plomer.<br>
<br>Cape was a tall, handsome man of commanding stature. He was an extremely hard worker, always keeping the same hours as the most junior member of his staff. By some he was considered a hard man, and he was certainly a shrewd one, but he had a humorous as well as a sentimental side and could sometimes be prevailed upon. He seldom became close personal friends with his authors, but they respected his integrity and admired his thorough knowledge of publishing. Except for reading, and the governorship of Frensham Heights, the co-educational school, he had no other interests. Publishing was his life, and although he suffered two strokes in 1954, he worked at it until his death at his home, 128 Bedford Court Mansions, London, from heart failure on 10 February 1960.<br>
