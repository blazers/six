<span class="headword">Pits,  John</span>  (1560&#150;1616), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born at Alton, Hampshire, one of the sons of Henry Pits and Elizabeth Sanders, who was the sister of controversialist and historian Dr Nicholas Sanders. The Pits family, which had an Oxford branch as well as a Hampshire one, were staunch Catholics, many of whom became priests. John Pits was admitted to Winchester College in 1571 and went to New College, Oxford, whence he matriculated on 20 March 1579. According to Anthony Wood he was in line to become a perpetual fellow of New College. However, before he could be appointed he became one of the group of Oxford men, William Allen and William Reynolds among them, who decided for religion's sake to leave Oxford for the Catholic settlements on the continent.<br>
<br>Pits went to the English College at Rheims (due to political difficulties the college had moved from Douai in 1578), where he arrived on 12 August 1581. At least five of his cousins had entered the college during the 1570s and at least one of his brothers, William, would follow him to Rheims. On 27 August 1581 he left Rheims for Rome, where he was admitted to the English College on 18 October 1581. Here he took the missionary oath and began to study for the priesthood. He was ordained subdeacon and deacon in October 1585 and priest on 5 April 1586. He left Rome on 2 March 1588 and arrived back at Rheims on 8 April 1588, where he began teaching rhetoric and Greek in September 1589. His period as a teacher did not last long, since the college records state that he left on 27 March 1590 in order to become tutor to the sons of an unnamed nobleman. In 1591 he was also awarded the degrees of BTh (23 July) and MA (5 August) by the University of Pont-&agrave;-Mousson. In 1592 he received a licentiate of divinity at Trier with the publication of <span class="italic">De legibus assertiones ex theologia deprompta</span> (Trier, 1592), a list of 137 theses on natural, divine, and human law. He completed his DTh degree at Ingolstadt on 13 June 1595&#151;his <span class="italic">Disputatio theologica de beatitudine</span> (Ingolstadt, 1595) announced the forthcoming defence of his dissertation. He returned to Lorraine and was made incumbent of the Chapelle de Notre-Dame de Bons-Secours in the neighbourhood of Nancy, by Charles de Guise III, cardinal of Lorraine. Two years later Pits became confessor to Antoinette, daughter of the duke of Lorraine and wife of Johan Wilhelm, duke of Cleves.<br>
<br>During this period Pits wrote five books, three of which remained in manuscript. <span class="italic">De peregrinatione libri septem</span> (D&uuml;sseldorf, 1604) was dedicated to his patron, Antoinette. His main work was his <span class="italic">Relationum historicarum de rebus Anglicis</span> (Paris, 1619), commonly referred to by its running title, <span class="italic">De illustribus Angliae scriptoribus</span>, which, according to a note by the author, he completed in September 1613 and which was edited after his death by William Bishop. Anthony Wood was very critical of Pits's bio-bibliographical dictionary, pointing out many mistakes and inaccuracies and, moreover, claiming that Pits copied his data from John Bale's <span class="italic">Illustrium majoris Britanniae scriptorum summarium</span> (1548), which, in the preface of <span class="italic">Relationum</span>, is reviled for its virulently anti-Catholic attitude. This accusation of plagiarism has subsequently been taken over by other writers. However, an examination of the book makes clear that Pits, while obviously depending on previous authorities, was independent. This conclusion was also reached by Thomas Hearne, who defended Pits against Wood's charges and made out a convincing case for Pits's original research.<br>
<br>Bishop's account of Pits, appended to <span class="italic">Relationum</span>, makes mention of the fact that Pits co-operated with the House of Writers at Arras College in Paris and with his cousin, Arthur Pits. Together with his cousin, Pits played a role in the acquisition of a monastery at Dieulouard for the English Benedictines; after its establishment he used its library, mainly collected by William Gifford. His work is in any case still valuable as a source of information about many contemporary Roman Catholic authors. After the death of his patron in 1610 he was appointed dean of the collegiate church of St Euchaire at Liverdun by his former pupil Charles Poncelet de Maillane, the very energetic cardinal of Nancy, whose intention with the appointment of learned foreign Roman Catholic priests was to combat German protestantism and to root out corruption in his diocese. Pits died on 17 October 1616 at St Euchaire, Liverdun, and was buried there. In Wood's time three other manuscripts by Pits (on English kings, bishops, and &#145;Apostolic men&#146;) were preserved at the church in Liverdun. According to Wood one of them (on the bishops) was later used by Edward Maihew for his history of the English Benedictine congregation, <span class="italic">Congregationis Angliae ordinis &hellip; S. Benedicti trophoea</span> (1619).<br>
