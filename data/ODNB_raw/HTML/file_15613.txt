<span class="headword">Kingsbury,  William</span>  (1744&#150;1818), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born on 12 July 1744 in Bishopsgate Street, London, one of five children of Thomas Kingsbury. In 1753 his father died, and William was placed at Merchant Taylors' School; later, under the patronage of Sir John Barnard, he was sent to Christ's Hospital school. In October 1758, through the interest of Dr Thomas Gibbons, he became a boarder at the Congregational academy, Mile End, under Gibbons himself, Dr John Conder, and Dr John Walker. Walker's free instruction included Hebrew, mathematics, geography, astronomy, and experimental philosophy. In 1760 Kingsbury became a divinity student, mainly because of Conder's persuasiveness and a conversion experience on Tuesday 7 October. In February 1762 he joined the Independent congregation at Haberdashers' Hall, where Gibbons was pastor. In August 1763, the year his mother died, Kingsbury preached his first sermon at Bethnal Green. In September, having preached at Lower Tooting, he was invited to be pastor. Until mid-1764, when he left the academy, he travelled weekly to Tooting.<br>
<br>In the autumn, Kingsbury preached at Above Bar Congregational Church in Southampton. On 28 December 1764 he was appointed pastor and ordained there on 8 October 1765. In 1767 the University of Aberdeen awarded him the degree of master of arts. On 23 November 1768 he married at Holy Trinity, Gosport, Mary Andrews (1744/5&#150;1789), daughter of Independent minister Mordecai Andrews. They had four sons and four daughters. In 1787 he was invited to be resident tutor at Homerton Academy. He declined, but, advised by his friend John Howard, opened an academy in Southampton. Kingsbury describes their first meeting in 1772 in James Baldwin Brown's <span class="italic">Memoirs of Howard</span>. Another friend was the evangelical divine John Newton. Other educational interests of his included Sunday schools, which he helped form in Southampton in 1786, charity schools, and the Revd David Bogue's seminary in Gosport for training missionaries. In 1793 Kingsbury became a founder contributor and trustee of the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Following the death of his wife on 2 January 1789, aged forty-four, Kingsbury married in spring 1790 Miss Redfearne. The following year Kingsbury's eldest son suffered a breakdown from which he never recovered. About the same time, Mrs Kingsbury developed a progressive mental disorder. By 1809 the condition was severe, and she was institutionalized. From 1776 onwards Kingsbury himself experienced periods of illness and depression. His extensive diaries present a &#145;picture of persevering piety, &hellip; strict habit of severe self-observation &hellip; a practice of viewing all &hellip; events with reference to the over-ruling providence, &hellip; and the merciful designs of the Almighty God&#146;  (Bullar, 23).<br>
<br>Kingsbury's ministry was dominated by popular evangelical preaching: &#145;Thousands of manuscript sermons attest the diligence with which he &hellip; prepared&#146;  (Bullar, 179). Some, often funeral sermons, were published. He habitually preached special sermons. One, on the recovery of George III (1789), was subsequently preached in at least two Anglican churches. Kingsbury, however, vociferously defended nonconformist beliefs and practices. A sermon in which the Revd Richard Mant criticized extemporary prayer led to the publication of <span class="italic">The manner in which the protestant dissenters perform prayer in public worship, represented and vindicated</span> (1796). He was also passionate about evangelical mission. In 1798 he published <span class="italic">An Apology for Village Preachers</span>. A founder member of the London Missionary Society, on 22 September 1795 he presided at two of the inaugural meetings. For a time he was a director of the society.<br>
<br>In 1802 George Clayton was appointed Kingsbury's assistant at Above Bar. Despite good relations, Clayton moved in 1804. On 8 October 1805 Henry Lacey became co-pastor. Relations were less harmonious and Lacey resigned in 1807. On resigning the pastorate of Above Bar in 1809, an annuity of &pound;200 was agreed, but in a letter dated 9 August Kingsbury declared, &#145;I <i>cannot</i> be prevailed upon to receive more than &pound;120&#146;. Kingsbury moved to Caversham, near Reading, where he opened a small place of worship. He died in Caversham on 18 February 1818 after a paralytic stroke. His daughter, Sarah Jameson, and son, Walter, were present. He was buried in Reading, and George Clayton delivered the funeral sermon. The Revd David Bogue preached a memorial sermon in Southampton.<br>
