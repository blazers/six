<span class="headword">Pennefather, Sir  John Lysaght</span>  (1800&#150;1872), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the third son of the Revd John Pennefather of New Park, co. Tipperary, and cousin of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21867/', "Richard Pennefather")</script>, baron of the exchequer in Ireland. His mother was a daughter of Major Percival. He entered the army on 14 January 1818 as cornet in the 7th dragoon guards, becoming a lieutenant on 20 February 1823 and a captain on half pay on 5 November 1825. On 8 April 1826 he was appointed to the 22nd (the Cheshire regiment), in which he became major on 22 March 1831 and lieutenant-colonel on 18 October 1839. In 1834 he married Margaret, eldest daughter of John Carr of Mountrath, Queen's county; she survived him.<br>
<br>Pennefather had seen no active service, but in 1843 his was the one European regiment in the force with which Sir Charles Napier won the battle of Meanee (17 February), and it bore the brunt of that action, in which Napier defeated the more numerous army of Sher Mahomed. The battalion was about 500 strong, many Irishmen, like their commander. &#145;The noble soldier&#146;, as Napier described Pennefather, fell wounded&#151;mortally, it was thought&#151;on the top of the bank which bordered the river-bed and formed the crest of the Baluchis' position. He was made a CB (July 1843), and received the thanks of parliament. From June 1846 to June 1854 he was an aide-de-camp to the queen. In 1848 he gave up the command of the 22nd regiment, and was placed on half pay; in the following year he was appointed assistant quartermaster-general in the Cork district. In 1854 he was given command of the 1st brigade of the 2nd (Sir De Lacy Evans's) division in the army sent to the Crimea, and on 20 June he was made major-general. His brigade consisted of the 30th, 55th, and 95th regiments. He commanded with great credit at the battle of the Alma, and in the action of 26 October, when a sortie in force was made from Sevastopol against the heights held by the 2nd division on the extreme right of the allied position. Pennefather also distinguished himself at the battle of Inkerman on 5 November when, owing to Evans's illness, he was in command of the division. He had fewer than 3000 men under command, while more than 30,000 Russian infantry were converging upon him. On 26 October Evans had drawn up his force on the ridge immediately in front of the camp of the division, and allowed his pickets to be driven in rather than leave his chosen ground. Pennefather adopted a different course, and disputed every inch, kept only a few men in reserve on the ridge, but pushed forward all the men he could to support his pickets in resisting the massed assaults. The thickness of the weather favoured these tactics, and the result justified them. As reinforcements, English and French, came up, they were similarly pushed forward as soon as available. Lord Raglan arrived, and Sir De Lacy Evans came up from Balaklava during the course of the morning, but Pennefather was left to direct the fight, so far as any one person could direct it, and he encouraged and inspired his men. The battle lasted about six hours&#151;from daybreak to 1 p.m.&#151;when the Russians began their retreat, having lost very heavily.<br>
<br>Pennefather's &#145;admirable behaviour&#146; was mentioned in Raglan's dispatch. A fortnight afterwards he was appointed to the colonelcy of the 46th regiment, and he succeeded to the command of the 2nd division when Evans returned to England in the latter part of November. He was invalided home from the Crimea in July 1855, and from 25 September 1855 until 1860 he commanded the troops in Malta, with the local rank of lieutenant-general. After brief service in the northern district he commanded at Aldershot from 1860 to 1865. He exchanged the colonelcy of the 46th for that of his former regiment, the 22nd, on 13 February 1860. On 12 November of that year he became lieutenant-general on the establishment, and on 9 May 1868 he became general. He had been made a KCB on 5 July 1855, and received the GCB on 13 May 1867. He was a commander of the Sardinian order of St Maurice and St Lazarus, a grand officer of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and was awarded the order of the Mejidiye (second class). On 27 August 1870 he was appointed governor of Chelsea Hospital. A staunch, combative and respected soldier, he died at Chelsea Hospital on 9 May 1872, and was buried in Brompton cemetery.<br>
