<span class="headword">Lawrence,  Dorothy</span>  (1887/8&#150;1964), <span class="occ">journalist, soldier, and sexual impostor</span>, was of uncertain origins, but by 1911 was a freelance journalist living in Kensington, London.<br>
<br>In 1914, at the start of the First World War, Lawrence was living in Paris. She contacted several British newspapers, offering to work as a war correspondent from the front line in France, but all the editors she contacted refused to employ a woman to cover such dangerous work. The military veto on civilians at the front line made it almost impossible to get even male reporters to the front, although one editor did respond with the comment, &#145;Of course if you could get to the front&#146;  (Lawrence, 41).<br>
<br>Lawrence later recorded her thoughts at this time in her autobiography: &#145;I'll see what an ordinary English girl, without credentials or money can accomplish&#146;  (Lawrence, 41&#150;2). After being turned down several times in her attempt to get to the front, including a request for a first-aid posting by the British War Office, she finally joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment. However, no one would send her anywhere because she was too young, so she reverted to journalism. She befriended two English soldiers in a Parisian caf&eacute;, and they agreed to provide her with a uniform which they smuggled into her flat in small parcels under the guise of washing. Lawrence bound her chest, and padded her back with sacking and cotton, struggling with her unfamiliarity with masculine clothing. Her friends taught her to drill and march. She managed to persuade two Scottish military policemen to cut her hair and then dyed her skin using a diluted furniture polish to give it a bronzed hue. After obtaining identification as Private Denis Smith of the 1st Leicestershire regiment, and with a real identification disc and a forged pass, which she wrote herself, and a safe-conduct pass from the mayor, she headed for the front lines. She cycled towards Bethune, and eventually arrived in Albert.<br>
<br>A Lancashire coalminer named Tom Dunn befriended Lawrence and found her a place in the British expeditionary force tunnelling company, a mine-laying company within 400 yards of the front line, where she was constantly under fire. He found her an abandoned cottage in Senlis Forest to live in, and she returned to it each night after laying mines by day. After working hard at her job and harder at hiding her gender, she was assaulted by the daily hardships of a front-line soldier. Suffering from chills and rheumatism, she also became increasingly aware of the physical danger she was in. Lawrence worried about what would happen to the men who had helped her if she were wounded and her gender discovered. After ten days the worry and discomfort became too much and she requested an interview with her commanding sergeant. After revealing her true gender to him, she was hauled from the trench and placed under military arrest. She escaped her arresting officers, but shortly afterwards gave herself up.<br>
<br>Dorothy Lawrence was taken to the British expeditionary force headquarters and interrogated as a possible spy and was made a prisoner of war. She explained that the reason for her masquerade was to obtain a byline as a journalist. Since the army did not know what to do with her she was taken cross-country on a horse to Calais. There, her interrogation occupied the time of six generals and approximately twenty other officers, and her ignorance about the term &#145;camp follower&#146; caused problems for her. Lawrence recalled later, &#145;We talked steadily at cross purposes. On my side I had not been informed what the term meant, and on their side they continued unaware that I remained ignorant! So I often appeared to be telling lies&#146;  (Lawrence, 161).<br>
<br>After her interrogation Lawrence was taken back to the Third Army headquarters in St Omer, where she was re-examined. She was thrown into a guard room policed by eight soldiers who were under strict instructions to refuse her all visitors. The army was embarrassed because of the serious breach in its security system and because of growing fears about women taking on male roles during the war. She was then detained in the Convent de Bon Pasteur, which kept her for two weeks until she agreed to swear an affidavit promising that she would not write for the newspapers and reveal to the British public how she had fooled the British army. Escorted back to Boulogne, she was then sent back to England.<br>
<br>In Folkestone, Dorothy Lawrence was made to promise not to divulge anything of her experiences until she received permission. This completely destroyed her original purpose of writing articles regarding the front lines: &#145;In making that promise I sacrificed the chance of earning by newspaper articles written on this escapade, as a girl compelled to earn her livelihood&#146;  (Lawrence, 189). Upon arrival in London she was taken to Scotland Yard but was released on the proviso she could guarantee her address for ten days. Unable, apparently, to do so, she was released onto the Embankment with a guinea-pig as a gift of the St Omer convent under her arm, and with nowhere to go.<br>
<br>Lawrence published her account of her experiences in 1919. In 1925 she was committed to the London County Mental Hospital, Hanwell, and later to the Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum, renamed the Friern Hospital, where she died on 29 August 1964, aged seventy-six. She was buried in New Southgate cemetery.<br>
