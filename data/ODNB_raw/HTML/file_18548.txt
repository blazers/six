<span class="headword">Melville, Sir  James, of Halhill</span>  (1535/6&#150;1617), <span class="occ">diplomat and autobiographer</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18549/', "Sir John Melville, fourth laird of Raith (d. 1548)")</script>, and his second wife, Helen (<i>d</i>. in or after 1584), daughter of Sir Alexander Napier of Merchiston and his wife, Janet, daughter of Edmund Chisholm of Cromlix. Born into a family that had long been prominent in Fife, at the age of fourteen James Melville was sent to France by Mary of Guise &#145;to be placit paige of honour with the Quen hir dochter&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of His Own Life</span>, 9). He left Scotland in the entourage of Jean de Montluc, bishop of Valence, the French ambassador to the Scottish court, and in April 1550 arrived in Paris, where he spent the next three years in the bishop's household continuing his education&#151;learning French, dancing, fencing, and playing the lute, as well as acquiring knowledge of current European affairs. He then entered the service of Anne, duc de Montmorency, great constable of France and chief minister to Henri II, and from May 1553 he saw military service in the war against the emperor, Charles V. In August 1557 Melville was wounded at St Quentin and narrowly escaped capture.<br>
<br>Following the treaty of Cateau Cambr&eacute;sis in April 1559, Henri II sent Melville to Scotland on a special mission to discover the real intentions of Lord James Stewart, half-brother of Mary, queen of Scots, whom Mary of Guise suspected of aiming at her daughter's crown. Melville achieved a meeting with Lord James through the good offices of Henry Balnaves, &#145;a godly, learnit, lang experimented, wyse consellor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of His Own Life</span>, 81), and was satisfied as to his intentions.<br>
<br>On Montmorency's recommendation Melville moved to the court of the elector palatine, Friedrich III, where he learned German, and from where he was able to visit the main cities of Italy. He returned to Paris to offer condolences to Mary, left a widow by the death of Fran&ccedil;ois II on 5 December 1560, and to present a commission regarding the proposed marriage of Charles IX to the emperor Maximilian's daughter. The French queen dowager, Catherine de' Medici, offered to make Melville a gentleman of the king's chamber and an ambassador to Germany, England, and Flanders, but in the meantime he received letters on behalf of Mary calling him home to Scotland to be employed in her service. Melville returned via England, where he had an interview with Queen Elizabeth regarding a proposal of marriage to the elector palatine's son, Johann Kasimir. Elizabeth, however, was more interested in Mary's choice of husband and proposed Lord Robert Dudley, later earl of Leicester, as one of two men she had in mind to offer Mary&#151;the other being Darnley, &#145;a lusty yong prince&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of His Own Life</span>, 108).<br>
<br>On 5 May 1564 Melville presented himself to Mary at Perth and was well received. Melville &#145;thocht her mair worthy to be servit for litle proffet, then any uther prence in Europe for gret commodite&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of His Own Life</span>, 111). He was appointed a privy councillor and gentleman of the bedchamber, and on 20 July 1564 was granted a yearly pension of &pound;100 Scots. He also received 1000 merks yearly out of Mary's revenues in France, together with lands in Auchtermuchty. In September 1564 he was sent to England to win the confidence of Elizabeth, to assess her opinions concerning Mary's marriage, and to secure her position as heir to the English throne. Melville worked hard to ingratiate himself with Elizabeth, but admitted that he did not trust her.<br>
<br>On 22 January 1565 Melville was granted the lands of Drumcorse in Linlithgowshire for his services, and on 18 November 1565 he was given all the goods, debts, and rights pertaining to his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18550/', "Robert Melville")</script>, escheated to the crown for Robert's support to the rising known as the chaseabout raid. James Melville was staying at Holyrood on the night of 9 March 1566, and, though he was not a witness to Rizzio's murder, he exploited it to bring about the reconciliation of Mary and Moray. On 16 April 1566 he was granted a life pension of 500 merks Scots a year. Following the birth of Prince James on 19 June 1566 Melville was sent to relay the news to Elizabeth. He requested her to be a godmother to the prince, and she agreed.<br>
<br>Melville was in Mary's entourage when she was abducted by Bothwell on 24 April 1567. But although he blamed Bothwell as the chief source of Mary's ruin, the prime suspect in Darnley's murder, and the bringer of &#145;gret trouble and mischeif into the contre&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of His Own Life</span>, 170), he was nevertheless present at their marriage on 15 May. After Mary had abdicated, on 24 July, Melville was sent by the nobles in August to offer the regency to the earl of Moray. In politics and religion Melville favoured Moray, but he was loyal to Mary and hoped that she and her opponents could be reconciled. This was prevented, however, by Mary's escape from Lochleven in May 1568, followed quickly by her defeat at Langside and her flight into England.<br>
<br>On the death of Henry Balnaves in February 1570, Melville inherited the estate of Halhill in Fife. Balnaves was a senator of the college of justice and an active reformer. Having no children of his own he had adopted Melville as his son and sole executor, and left him the whole heirship of Halhill. Balnaves's will, dated 3 January 1570, contains a bequest to his &#145;sones wyffe&#146; of a damask gown lined with velvet showing that Melville was now married  (Fraser, 3.117&#150;20). Melville's wife, Christine Boswell, with whom he had two sons and two daughters, (including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6009/', "Elizabeth Melville")</script>, the writer) is identified in a charter of 24 February 1576 confirming Melville's grant to her in liferent of the half-lands of Easter Collessie (called Halhill) and of Murefield, in the sheriffdom and county of Fife.<br>
<br>During the minority of James VI, Melville was entrusted with diplomatic missions by all four regents, before choosing to retire from court life. But having been recommended by Mary, queen of Scots, for his good counsel and services, he returned during James VI's reign, when he offered advice and support to the young king and received foreign ambassadors. However, &#145;hindered by want of health&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1581&#150;3</i>, 652), he was reluctant to act as ambassador himself, and declined missions to England, Denmark, and Spain, in spite of being commended in 1590 for his knowledge of Latin, Italian, and German, and his diplomatic experience. Appointed a member of the privy council and of the exchequer, and also made gentleman of the bedchamber to Queen Anne, Melville was knighted at her coronation on 17 May 1590. He was present at Holyrood on 27 December 1591, and again at Falkland on 28 June 1592, when the first earl of Bothwell tried to kidnap the king, and he commented at length on Bothwell's association with witches.<br>
<br>Following the death in 1594 of his brother David Melville of Newmill, Melville was retoured his heir in the lands of Prinlaws. He was called to parliament on 30 May 1594, as one of four representatives for Fife, and in December 1597 his annual pensions of &pound;100 and 500 merks were ratified by the king in parliament, with an augmentation fee of &pound;300. In July 1599 Melville was named to a commission for raising men for military service, and on 14 July 1600 he was received and admitted to the privy council (as reconstituted in 1598).<br>
<br>Melville declined James VI's request to accompany him to England in 1603, though he did subsequently make one visit to London. His later years were spent quietly at Halhill, where he wrote his memoirs. Intended mainly as a guide for his son James, they are among the most important sources for British history in the second half of the sixteenth century, through the light they shed on the human qualities of the leading actors on the public stage. They did much to justify Sir Walter Scott's verdict that they may &#145;justly be compared with the most valuable materials which British history affords&#146;  (Scott, <span class="italic">History of Scotland</span>, 1850, 2.93). Melville based his judgements on Mary, Elizabeth, Darnley, Moray, and others on his personal observation. It was to Melville that Queen Elizabeth uttered her famous cry of distress, when told of the birth of Prince James: &#145;The queen of Scots is this day leichter of a fair son, and I am but a barren stock&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of His Own Life</span>, 159). Likewise it is to Melville that posterity owes such vignettes of the great as Mary praising Darnley's good looks, Elizabeth tickling Robert Dudley's neck while creating him earl of Leicester, and Bothwell's disgusting language. The memoirs were not published until 1683. Several further editions followed in the eighteenth century and later, notably those of Thomas Thomson in 1827 and Gordon Donaldson in 1969.<br>
<br>Melville owed his ability to record people and events primarily to his employment as a diplomat. In that role he seems to have been fairly impartial, avoiding direct involvement in political and religious intrigue, and remaining free from links to any of the leading families. When setting down his opinion that the main figures of his time would have been better off if they had listened to his advice, Melville may well have been exaggerating his own importance. But his very lack of bias and self-interest did at least make it easier for him to speak freely. As both courtier and ambassador he earned the respect he won during the reigns of two monarchs and four regents. Melville died on 13 November 1617, aged eighty-two, and was buried in the churchyard of Collessie.<br>
