<span class="headword">Tennant,  Henry</span>  (1823&#150;1910), <span class="occ">railway administrator</span>, was born at Countersett on the shores of Semmerwater, near Bainbridge in Wensleydale. Little is known about his background, but his family were strong Quakers, and he undertook his education at Ackworth, the well-known Quaker school near Pontefract. At the age of sixteen he started his working life as a bookkeeper with the firm of Messrs Charles Bragg &amp; Co. at Newcastle upon Tyne, and two years later was appointed to the staff of the infant Brandling Junction Railway on Tyneside, where he soon became chief clerk. In 1844, as George Hudson engineered the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway, Tennant secured the post of chief clerk to the general manager, but he left in 1846 to become accountant and traffic manager of the Leeds and Thirsk Railway. On 17 February 1847 he married Mary Jane Goundry (<i>d</i>. 1900), also a Quaker. There were no children from the marriage.<br>
<br>Mounting the ladder of success rapidly as the youthful railway industry threw up opportunities for capable, ambitious young men, Tennant became general manager of the line in 1848. Inevitably, he was soon involved in the negotiations which led the Leeds Northern (as it became known) to amalgamate with the York, Newcastle and Berwick, and York and North Midland railways to form the North Eastern Railway (NER) in 1854. Tennant immediately became accountant of the new line and held the post until 1870 when he became general manager.<br>
<br>From 1854 to 1870 Tennant was active in forging, and implementing, the policies which led the NER to absorb the remaining significant independent railways in the area until in contemporary perception it had the district to itself, and was the most complete railway monopoly in the country. He was particularly noted for helping to define its pricing policies and for masterminding the complex scheme of finance by which the ordinary stocks and shares of the constituent railways of the NER were merged into a new class of North Eastern ordinary shares known as &#145;consols&#146;. The scheme served as a model for the reorganization of other railway companies' stocks as the course of railway amalgamation proceeded apace.<br>
<br>On the retirement of William O'Brien as general manager in 1870, Tennant was appointed to succeed him, and he held the job until his retirement from executive management in 1891 at the age of sixty-eight. Over the years of his reign the NER evolved into the most powerful of Britain's provincial railways. Its ordinary stocks paid the high dividend of 10 per cent in the early 1870s, and, while the line was subject thereafter to the diminishing returns which beset the industry as a whole, it had a reputation under Tennant for financial strength and sound administration, though not great flair. He brought to the job a skill in handling figures and a reputation for conducting negotiations with shrewdness and a cool, unemotional, and unhurried style. These qualities recommended him to the York City and County Bank, whose board of directors he chaired for a while. Inevitably, he was, in the early railway age (and later), a frequent witness and contributor to many railway parliamentary contests, select committees, and inquiries of the time. In the 1880s he was also closely involved with the evolution of a progressive labour relations policy for the NER, as the impact of militant general unionism on Tyneside made itself felt, and demanded a response.<br>
<br>On his retirement in 1891, Tennant was elected a director of the NER and was granted the sum of &pound;10,000 in recognition of his services to the growth of the railways in the north-east over the preceding forty years, as well as in anticipation of a continuing consultative contribution to the management of the line. His service on the board continued to the end of his long life, and he was appointed joint deputy chairman in 1905. While his influence on executive management inevitably waned, he remained prominent in the work of the company, and his reputation earned him appointments on the boards of other railways. He also directed ventures in which the NER had a stake, such as the Forth Bridge Company and shipping lines; these investments protected its share of continental traffic around 1900. At various times he acted as an arbitrator for the Board of Trade and the Irish Office on transport matters.<br>
<br>For much of his professional life Tennant lived unostentatiously in the city of York. His retirement from executive railway management in 1891 enabled him to expand his involvement in the local community. He made an active contribution to the York Liberal Association and local Liberal politics, and put in a long stint as a city JP. His contribution to education in York was particularly notable. He took an interest in the schooling of working-class children, making his motto &#145;For every child an equal opportunity&#146;. He was elected to the York school board in 1889 after a stiff political campaign, and served as vice-chairman of the board and later as a co-opted member of the York education committee (from which he retired only in 1906). He was active in the temperance movement, and in 1892 when the North Eastern Temperance Union was forged out of a number of regional bodies, he was elected its president and remained so until his death. For his service to railways, but doubtless also his contribution to Liberal politics and values in York, he was offered, but declined, a knighthood in 1907 from Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman.<br>
<br>Tennant died at his home, Holgate Hill House, York, on 25 May 1910. He was buried in the Quaker burial-ground at Heslington, York, on the 28th. An obituary in the <span class="italic">Yorkshire Gazette</span> mourned the loss of a &#145;Great Railway Administrator and Educationist&#146;. Tennant was, indeed, both these things and very much a man of the north.<br>
