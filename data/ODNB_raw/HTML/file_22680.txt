<span class="headword">Powys,  Thomas Littleton</span>, fourth Baron Lilford  (1833&#150;1896), <span class="occ">ornithologist</span>, was born on 18 March 1833 at 14 Great Stanhope Street, Mayfair, Westminster, the eldest son of Thomas Atherton Powys, third Baron Lilford (1801&#150;1861), and his wife, Mary Elizabeth (1806&#150;1891), daughter of Henry Richard Fox, third Baron Holland, and Elizabeth Vassall, his wife. He was educated at Dr Bickmore's school, Berkswell, Warwickshire, from 1843 to 1848, and at Harrow School until midsummer 1850, when he went to reside with a tutor at Lausanne, Switzerland. He then matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 12 June 1851, but left the university without taking a degree.<br>
<br>At an early age Powys manifested a love for animals; at Harrow he kept a small menagerie, and also began contributing to <span class="italic">The Zoologist</span>. He kept a larger menagerie at Oxford, and all his spare time, during vacations and subsequently through life, as far as his health would permit, was devoted to travel for the purpose of studying animals, especially birds. In 1853 he visited the Isles of Scilly, Wales, and Ireland, and becoming acquainted with Edward Clough Newcome, the best falconer of his day, shortly afterwards took up falconry himself. His aviaries at Lilford Park in Northamptonshire were the envy of field ornithologists, and especially noted for the collection of birds of prey.<br>
<br>In 1854, on the embodiment of the militia, Powys joined that of his county and served at Dublin and Devonport, giving up his commission at the end of 1855. From 1856 to 1858, accompanied by the Hon. Hercules Rowley, he made an extended yachting cruise in the Mediterranean. He returned to England in the following year, and married, on 14 June 1859, Emma Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1884), youngest daughter of Robert William Brandling, of Low Gosforth, Northumberland. He succeeded his father as fourth Baron Lilford on 15 March 1861.<br>
<br>Between 1864 and 1882 Lilford paid frequent visits to Spain and the Mediterranean, rediscovering the rare gull <i>Larus audouini</i>. Together with his friend <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34109/', "Leonard Howard Loyd Irby")</script>, he was a pioneer in Spanish ornithology. The death in 1882 of his eldest son, Thomas Atherton, and in 1884 of his wife, greatly distressed him, and his lifelong malady, gout, subsequently rendered him a permanent invalid. His affliction was somewhat relieved by the devoted attention of his second wife, Clementina Georgiana (1839&#150;1929), daughter of Ker Baillie Hamilton CB, whom Lilford married on 21 July 1885.<br>
<br>Lilford had been elected a fellow of the Zoological Society in 1852, and of the Linnean Society in March 1862. He was one of the founders of the British Ornithologists' Union in 1858, and its president from March 1867. He was also a liberal supporter and first president of the Northamptonshire Natural History Society, founded in 1876, and a prominent member of the &#145;Old Hawking Club&#146;.<br>
<br>Lilford's zeal for his favourite science never flagged. In addition to some two dozen papers on ornithological subjects, contributed to the <span class="italic">Ibis</span> (of which he was a generous supporter), the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society</span>, and other scientific journals, he was author of: <span class="italic">Coloured Figures of the Birds of the British Islands</span>, in seven volumes (1885&#150;97)&#151;which was completed by Osbert Salvin and included a biography by the zoologist Alfred Newton&#151; and <span class="italic">Notes on the Birds of Northamptonshire and Neighbourhood</span> (1895). He died at Lilford Hall on 17 June 1896, and was buried three days later at Achurch, near Lilford. He was succeeded by his son, the Hon. John Powys.<br>
