<span class="headword">Twysden <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Saunder]</span>,  Isabella</span>, Lady Twysden  (1605&#150;1657), <span class="occ">diarist</span>, was the third and youngest daughter of Sir Nicholas Saunder of Nonsuch, Surrey. On 27 January 1635 she married the antiquary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27929/', "Sir Roger Twysden, second baronet (1597&#150;1672)")</script>, of Roydon Hall, East Peckham, Kent. Sir Roger was detained by parliament for supporting the Kentish petition of March 1642 and in May 1643 his estates were sequestrated. He spent much of the remaining years of the 1640s in prison or in regular attendance on parliamentary committees trying to remove the sequestration. Lady Twysden was entrusted with much of her husband's business in these years and throughout these tribulations the couple maintained a stance of neutrality, making it clear that the family supported neither king nor parliament. Like many other wives of sequestered gentlemen and clergymen at the time, she found herself increasingly drawn into the political process of negotiating with parliamentarian officials. She made frequent appearances before parliamentary committees in London and the county committee in Kent in order to obtain the &#145;fifth part&#146; of her husband's estates as maintenance and to prevent the indiscriminate felling of his woods. She was forced to attend these committees even when she was, in her husband's words, &#145;great with child&#146; or had recently recovered from childbirth. In his later account Sir Roger wrote that his wife was put off &#145;from post to pillar&#146; and only obtained her fifth &#145;with unspeakable trouble, vexation and charge&#146;  (&#145;Sir Roger Twysden's journal&#146;, 4.139, 143).<br>
<br>Lady Twysden's surviving diary covers the years 1645 to 1651 and is written on the blank pages of printed almanacs. In it she gives brief accounts of the major political events of the period, the movements of troops, her family's dealings with the sequestrators, and other family affairs. She was careful not to express any personal opinions about the conflict, but her diary entries exemplify the keen interest in the national and local political events of the time expressed by many other contemporary gentlewomen, and are a good source of evidence for how and when information was received. Her diary starts with the execution of Sir John Hotham, his son, and Archbishop William Laud at the beginning of January 1645 and she noted later executions including that of Charles I as well as the deaths of politicians, among them Sir Anthony Weldon, chairman of the parliamentarian county committee in Kent, whom Sir Roger regarded as a particular enemy. Lady Twysden also noted the billeting of parliamentarian troops in East Peckham in August 1647, the use of the local trained bands to put down the Christmas riots at Canterbury in January 1648, and the defeat of the Kent rebels in the second civil war by Sir Thomas Fairfax at Maidstone later in June. She was similarly concerned by the progress of the war outside the county and recorded the parliamentarian success at Naseby in 1645, the subsequent fall of Bristol in September 1645, and the defeat of Charles II and his Scottish allies by Cromwell at Worcester in 1651.<br>
<br>The personal impact of the civil war played an important part in the diary and Lady Twysden thus noted the regular receipt of payments of rents representing her fifth, her husband's return to Roydon on 5 August 1647, &#145;where he had not ben in 5 yeare before&#146; and the decision reached by the parliamentary committee at Goldsmiths' Hall in May 1649 that Sir Roger should pay a reduced fine of &pound;1500. In April 1651 Roydon Hall was searched for arms and letters, and Sir Roger and Lady Twysden's brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5341/', "Sir Hugh Cholmley")</script>, were briefly imprisoned in Leeds Castle &#145;for no cause, I thank God&#146; as she noted in her diary  (Bennitt, &#145;Diary of Isabella&#146;, 121, 131, 133). Sir Roger later wrote that his wife's health never fully recovered after the birth of her sixth and last child, Charles, in March 1645. She died in Dean's Yard, Westminster, on 11 March 1657 after suffering from a cold and was buried at East Peckham church on 17 March. Sir Roger wrote a moving tribute to her in which he described her adherence to the English church &#145;as it was reformed&#146; by Elizabeth I and James I; she was &#145;a wise and temperat sollicitrix&#146; to him during his troubles and the &#145;saver&#146; of his estate  (&#145;Sir Roger Twysden's journal&#146;, 4.169, 200).<br>
