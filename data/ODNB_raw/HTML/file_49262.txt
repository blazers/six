<span class="headword">H&aelig;sten <span class="st"> [H&aacute;steinn, Hasting]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em>882&#150;893), <span class="occ">viking leader</span>, makes his first certain appearance in the work of two contemporary Frankish annalists, who independently reported Northmen on the Loire in 882 led by &#145;A(l)stingus&#146;, a Frankish attempt at a name the Norse form of which was probably H&aacute;steinn; he appears as H&aelig;sten in English sources and has sometimes been named, in Anglicized form, as Hasting. The West Frankish king Louis III induced him to quit the Loire for the channel coast. Perhaps active in the ravaging of northern Francia by the &#145;great army&#146; during the 880s, H&aelig;sten is next named in the annals of St Vaast under 890. He established a base on the Somme at Arg&#339;uves, then made a &#145;treacherous&#146; deal with Rudolf, abbot of St Vaast, &#145;that he might be able to go freely wherever he wanted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annales Vedastini</span>, s.a. 890), apparently undertaking to protect St Vaast against other vikings at Noyon; then on 27 December he attacked St Vaast. It is unclear if H&aelig;sten was among those Northmen defeated at the Dyle in 891. The St Vaast annalist reports H&aelig;sten's wintering in 891&#150;2 at Amiens, whence he launched a successful surprise attack on forces led by another West Frankish king, Odo. In autumn 892 famine caused the Northmen to leave Francia for England.<br>
<br>H&aelig;sten, the only viking leader named in the section of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> devoted to the years 892&#150;6, crossed the channel, evidently bringing wife and sons, &#145;with 80 ships&#146;, and &#145;made a fort&#146; at Milton Royal in north Kent. A &#145;great army&#146; came in 250 ships to Appledore, south Kent. In 893 Alfred, adopting a classic tactic, came to terms with the smaller force: H&aelig;sten's two sons were baptized (H&aelig;sten himself had perhaps adopted Christianity in Francia), with Alfred and Ealdorman &AElig;thelred of the Mercians as respective godfathers; H&aelig;sten gave &#145;hostages and oaths&#146;; Alfred &#145;made him generous gifts of money&#146;. H&aelig;sten then crossed the Thames to Essex, &#145;made a fort&#146; at Benfleet, and &#145;immediately went harrying in that very province which &AElig;thelred, his son's godfather, was in charge of&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 893 [text A]). He made no further attacks south of the Thames, and Benfleet became a key base.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the Appledore army raided in Wessex, and, wishing to carry booty &#145;across the Thames into Essex to meet the ships&#146;, was beaten at Farnham. The survivors eventually reached Benfleet. H&aelig;sten now went raiding again into Mercia, leaving wife and sons at Benfleet with the &#145;great army&#146;. The raiders included &#145;great reinforcements both from East Anglia and from Northumbria&#146;, which were now under Danish control. Reaching the Severn they made a fort at Buttington. After &#145;many weeks&#146; besieged by a combined West Saxon, Mercian, and Welsh force H&aelig;sten's men &#145;became distressed for lack of food and had devoured most of their horses, the remainder perishing with hunger&#146;. They attempted a break-out, and a fierce battle ensued, in which &#145;many king's thegns were slain&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 893 [text A]). &AElig;thelweard, the well-informed author (<i>c</i>.980) of a Latin version of the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, says: &#145;further effort was seen as foolish by the Danes: they confirmed peace a second time; they did not refuse hostages; they promised to withdraw from that region&#146;. They went back to Benfleet and &#145;divided out the year's booty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of &AElig;thelweard</span>, 50).<br>
<br>H&aelig;sten now met Alfred a second time in 893, for, in H&aelig;sten's absence, a small contingent of West Saxons, augmented by Mercian troops from London, had &#145;stormed the fortification at Benfleet, captured all that was in it, goods, women and children&#146;, and carried all these off to London, along with some ships. H&aelig;sten's second encounter with Alfred thus perhaps occurred at London. Alfred, mindful of their spiritual kinship, &#145;restored his wife and sons to him&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 893 [text A]). Hasty repairs to the Benfleet ramparts damaged by the Saxon&#150;Mercian force (&AElig;thelweard mentions the collapse of a rebuilt section) confirm the overriding importance of forts to viking strategy.<br>
<br>Though H&aelig;sten never reappears in the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span>, the further Danish efforts of 893&#150;6 may have continued under his leadership. Late in 893 there was another raid into Mercia, again involving forces from East Anglia and Northumbria. After moving to Chester, then Wales, and thence, with their loot, via Northumbria and East Anglia back to Essex, this army went up the Thames and the Lea, where, early in 895, another fort was built, 20 miles above London. When Alfred blocked the Lea, the Danes again escaped westwards, abandoning their ships (and leaving their womenfolk &#145;for safety in East Anglia&#146;), to Bridgnorth on the Severn, where they overwintered. In summer 896 &#145;the army dispersed, some to East Anglia, some to Northumbria, and those that were moneyless got themselves ships there and sailed south oversea to the Seine&#146;  (<span class="italic">ASC</span>, s.a. 896 [text A]). The annals of St Vaast (s.a. 896), naming a viking leader on the Seine as &#145;Hundeus&#146;, clearly distinguished him from &#145;Alstingus&#146;. H&aelig;sten probably ended his days moneyed and settled in England with his family.<br>
<br>If the &#145;Hastingus&#146; mentioned by Regino of Pr&uuml;m as &#145;commander of Northmen&#146; active on the Loire in 866, when they slew Robert, count of Anjou, and in 868, when they accepted a peace-offering of 500 cows from the Bretons in return for hostages, is the same H&aelig;sten (and not a kinsman), his uniquely well-documented career spanned three decades. Longevity alone hardly explains why legends later clustered around him. His reputation as an archetypal viking lies behind his legendary appearances in the histories of the dukes of Normandy by Dudo of St Quentin (1015&#150;26) and William of Jumi&egrave;ges (<i>c</i>.1070), which take him as far as the town of Luni in north-west Italy, as well as a number of other high-medieval legends of his exploits in north-west France. The genuine H&aelig;sten, in the 890s, applied his continental military and political experience to England in campaigns of dramatic mobility, resourcefulness, and skilful manoeuvre matching Alfred's own. H&aelig;sten's personal journey from raiding to acculturation and settlement typified the viking age.<br>
