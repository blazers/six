<span class="headword">Trevor, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1624, <em>d.</em> 1672), <span class="occ">politician and government official</span>, was baptized on 23 August 1624 at St Margaret's, Westminster, the second but eldest surviving son of <a name="cosubject_27728"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Trevor</span>  (1596&#150;1673), <span class="occ">politician</span>, and Anne, the daughter of Sir Edmund Hampden. Sir John Trevor senior was the eldest son of John Trevor of Trefalun (1563&#150;1630), navy official and politician, and Margaret, the daughter of Hugh Trevanion of Trevannion, Cornwall, and from his father inherited Plas Teg, Flintshire. He married Anne Hampden in 1619.<br>
<br>Trevor senior was knighted at Windsor on 7 June 1619 and sat as a member of parliament for Denbighshire in 1621 and Flintshire in the following parliaments. He then moved to Great Bedwyn in 1628 and Grampound in the Long Parliament. He initially made little mark in the parliaments, and was later named as one of those who had offered bribes to the lord chancellor in the parliament of 1621. A moderate presbyterian, he managed to gain the favour of the court and acquired the keepership of several royal forests and his father's farm of the coal tax, as well as the inheritance of Trefalun in 1638 from his uncle Sir Richard Trevor. He was involved in a number of royal commissions during the 1630s and was a member of the Long Parliament, being noted there as a spokesman for north Welsh affairs. He sat on the committee of both kingdoms from 2 June 1648 and the commission for the propagation of the gospel in Wales in 1650, as well as the republican council of state in 1651 and 1652&#150;3. In addition he sat on local committees for militia and taxation in Middlesex, Westminster, Denbighshire, and Flint. Trevor sat in Cromwell's second parliament of 1656 and supported the offer of the crown to the lord protector. Trevor was a rising man in the 1650s, sensible enough not to be a regicide, and making the most of the financial opportunities of the period, including the purchase of royalists' and recusants' estates. He took no part in the Restoration, but was given a royal pardon on 24 July 1660 and subsequently lived in London, his estate at Plas Teg in Wales being given as a refuge to William Jones, a deprived churchman, as his pensioner. He may have married Margaret Griffith in 1672. He died in 1673 bequeathing some of his property to the establishment of two houses for poor men in Wales.<br>
<br>Sir John Trevor the younger was educated at Leiden in 1643 and entered parliament as a recruiter member for Flintshire on 2 December 1646. He faltered at the possibility of regicide however and was excluded, or retired, in 1648. About 1649 he married his cousin Ruth (1628&#150;1687), fourth daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12169/', "John Hampden")</script>, the puritan politician, and the couple had five sons and one daughter. Ruth remained a presbyterian following the Restoration and attended Thomas Manton's church in London. Trevor returned to public life in the Cromwellian parliaments of the 1650s. He also sat on several county committees from 1657. His politics in the 1650s were clearly moderate, based on ideas of legality and a dislike of innovations. He supported the offer of the crown to Cromwell, and welcomed the constitution of 1656, hoping for the peace of the people as the main basis for the legal settling of the nation. He was a supporter of Richard Cromwell, and on the latter's removal backed George Monck, sitting on the council of state in February 1660. He was rejected by Flintshire in the Convention of 1660 and instead sat for Arundel. In a pamphlet of 1660 Trevor further outlined his political views in that he was against the Rump and called for a broader based settlement than the Rump could ever provide. Significantly he also claimed that absolute uniformity of religion was not essential to any monarchy. With this Trevor made a successful transition into the Restoration.<br>
<br>Trevor was MP for Great Bedwyn from 18 February 1663 to his death in 1672 and was an advocate of leniency in the indemnity debates. He was named to the committee for restoring the dukedom of Norfolk to the Howard family and was concerned to make good relations with the royal regime. Chosen for a diplomatic mission to France in 1663, he had already become attached to the party of Sir Henry Bennet, the future earl of Arlington. The fall of Lord Chancellor Clarendon in 1667 opened up new opportunities to Trevor. With a continued credit among the dissenters and at court because of his attacks on Clarendon he was thought to be useful for a regime planning religious indulgence as part of its policy. Trevor was knighted in 1668 and sent on another mission to France. There he did not behave himself altogether well according to Charles II, who was &#145;troubled that Trevor carried himself so like an ass&#146; to Henriette-Anne, the king's sister. Charles claimed that he had &#145;sent him a chiding for it&#146; and put it down to his &#145;want of good breeding&#146;  (Bryant, 1963, 216). None the less with the retirement of William Morice on 29 September 1668 Trevor was allowed to purchase the junior secretary of state's place for the sum of &pound;8000. Although initially the patent included the usual clause of giving the recipient &pound;100 for life, this was changed&#151;either because of jealousy from other courtiers or through retrenchment&#151;to &pound;100 during pleasure only and such was the limitation on Trevor's power that he did not challenge it.<br>
<br>Indeed, despite his post, Trevor was without any real influence or authority in the regime; it was Arlington, the senior secretary of state, who held the reins of power at this time. Trevor wavered between the clashing forces of Arlington and the duke of Buckingham in this period and some considered him as Buckingham's man as he secured the election of Buckingham as chancellor of the University of Cambridge in May 1671. He continued to support the relief of dissenters, speaking against the continuation of the <span class="roman">Conventicles Act</span> in November 1669, was unhappy at having to enforce it, and according to Joseph Williamson in 1671 &#145;Secretary Trevor [was] theirs&#146;, that is, wholly in with the dissenters  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1671</i>, 569). He naturally supported the declaration of indulgence of 15 March 1672 and had some share in its administration. Trevor died suddenly of apoplexy and fever on 28 May 1672, allegedly brought on by drinking cold wine with ice when he was very hot. He was buried on 31 May at St Bartholomew-the-Less, Smithfield, in London. His wife died on 1 December 1687, and his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27736/', "Thomas Trevor")</script>, was created Baron Trevor of Bromham.<br>
