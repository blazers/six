<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wilson,  Eleanora Mary  Carus-</span>  (1897&#150;1977), <span class="occ">economic historian</span>, was born in Montreal, Canada, on 27 December 1897, the only daughter and younger child of Charles Ashley Carus-Wilson (1860&#150;1942), then professor of civil engineering at McGill University, Montreal, and his wife, Mary Louisa Georgina (<i>d</i>. 1935), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22053/', "Colonel Martin Petrie")</script>, who had been one of the earliest women students at University College, London. Apart from her early transatlantic years, Eleanora Carus-Wilson was quintessentially English, in both her personal and her scholarly style. Her life and work were accomplished in symbiosis with Westfield College, London. Her maternal grandfather had been a foundation trustee of the college. Its benefactor and founder, Miss Dudin Brown, had been introduced to its future principal by her mother, who was subsequently a lecturer in English on the staff for five years in the 1880s and then active in the administration. Eleanora went to Westfield herself in 1918 after St Paul's Girls' School, graduating BA in 1921, and returned after some years as a schoolteacher, taking her MA with distinction in 1926 and working as a part-time lecturer at Westfield in 1930&#150;31. Her first edited book in 1932 was a history of the college. She was Leverhulme research fellow there in 1936&#150;8. Then, when a senior academic, once again she became increasingly identified with Westfield&#151;as a governor after 1965 and as president of the Westfield College Association from 1974. She was due to take the chair at the governing body on the day she died.<br>
<br>Apart from her years as a temporary civil servant in the Ministry of Food during the Second World War, Eleanora Carus-Wilson's life, like that of her parents, was encompassed by scholarly pursuits, always centred on London. Eileen Power became her main mentor when she became a member of her seminar in the 1930s. The research bridgeheads made under Eileen Power's direction proved to be the territories which Eleanora Carus-Wilson consolidated with magisterial authority during the remainder of her life. Eventually the mantle of Eileen Power fell upon her own shoulders when she herself had become a leading medievalist: as lecturer (after 1945) at the London School of Economics, then reader (1948), and as professor of economic history at London University from 1953 to her retirement in 1965. English medieval trade was her first and last major field&#151;with the study of the urban centres which cradled it, the organizations which sustained it, and the principal industry which provided its base. &#145;The overseas trade of Bristol&#146; and &#145;The Iceland trade&#146; appeared in a volume edited by Eileen Power and M. M. Postan in 1933, consolidated by a substantial volume of documents edited for the Bristol Record Society in 1937.<br>
<br>This aspect of Eleanora Carus-Wilson's work culminated in 1963 with the authoritative volume, written jointly with her own pupil Olive Coleman, <span class="italic">England's Export Trade, 1275&#150;1547</span>&#151;a meticulous and comprehensive critical assessment of the surviving customs accounts. Concern with the quantitative record of medieval trade (involving formidable difficulties of interpreting refractory documents) matched equally meticulous investigations into its commercial structures (notably the Merchant Venturer organizations in London and Bristol) and into the connections between trade, industry, and urban development more widely&#151;in particular for Bristol and Exeter. Integral with this was the study of the cloth industry itself, notably in the major chapter in the <span class="italic">Cambridge Economic History of Europe</span> (vol. 2, 1952). Her most renowned article, which raised some controversy over its wider interpretation, was provocatively entitled &#145;An industrial revolution of the thirteenth century&#146; (<span class="italic">Economic History Review</span>, 11, 1941) and was an equally meticulous documentation of the introduction and diffusion of the fulling mill.<br>
<br>With such a steady consolidation of scholarship in a major, defined field, Eleanora Carus-Wilson became widely recognized for her intellectual authority: as associate member of the Royal Academy of Belgium (1961); fellow of the British Academy (1963); trustee of the Cassel Educational Trust (1963); Ford's lecturer in English history at Oxford University (1964&#150;5); president of the Economic History Society (1966&#150;9), president of the Society of Medieval Archaeology (1966&#150;9); honorary LLD of Smith College, USA (1968); honorary fellow of the London School of Economics (1969). In all this the person matched the scholarship. Eleanora Carus-Wilson knew her own measure and her own mind. She kept things very much under control. She was precise, clear-cut, self-assured, always restrained and polite. But her eyes could slightly narrow behind her glasses and remarks dulcet in tone, softly spoken in the reticent, even prim, style of a very English lady, could mask a devastating content. She had a personal and intellectual authority about her which women academics in England&#151;particularly, perhaps, distinguished women academics of her own generation&#151;possessed in unrivalled measure.<br>
<br>Not having married, she filled her days with activities over a wide spectrum of academic and cultural affairs right to the end of her life. She listed &#145;music and mountains&#146; as her recreations, which signalled long-standing membership of the Bach Choir and annual active holidays with friends in Switzerland. Even in her scholarship there was vivid personal awareness; usually hidden but allowed to escape in some of her less formal pieces. &#145;The significance of the secular sculpture in the Lane Chapel, Cullompton&#146;, for example, is a charming account of medieval cloth-making equipment, with teazel frames and shears being wielded by angels in the vaulting (and John Lane's merchant's mark prominent upon the frames). Its splendid precision of observation and detail establishes a lively dialogue between present and past, between her own awareness and the living history of which she wrote and to which she had dedicated her life. Eleanora Carus-Wilson died at St Charles Hospital, Ladbroke Grove, London, on 1 February 1977.<br>
