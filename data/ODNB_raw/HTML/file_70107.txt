<span class="headword">Hodgson <span class="st"> [Hudson; <em>n&eacute;e </em>Dyer]</span>,  Mary</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1673?, <em>d.</em> 1719?), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was most probably the daughter of the dancing-master Benjamin Dyer and his wife, Mary, baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn, London, on 26 December 1673. As Mrs Dyer she performed in Henry Purcell's opera <span class="italic">The Fairy Queen</span> at Dorset Garden Theatre in May 1692, when she sang the role of Mystery and the song &#145;If love's a sweet passion&#146;. On 16 May 1692, two weeks after the premi&egrave;re, Mary Dyer married the actor John Hodgson or Hudson (<i>fl</i>. 1689&#150;1721) at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney. From song headings and play texts we know that she sang Purcell's music in the revival of the opera <span class="italic">Dioclesian</span> in 1693 and at least five plays, as well as incidental songs by John Eccles. She remained a singer in the United Theatre Company in London until December 1694, when she and her husband joined Thomas Betterton's breakaway group at Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre. There Eccles and Gottfried Finger were the house composers, and she sang in numerous plays and in the musical entertainment <span class="italic">The Loves of Mars and Venus</span> (November 1696). William Congreve praised her performance as Juno in the setting by Eccles of his <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span> (1701). Mrs Hodgson was also a leading singer in concerts at York Buildings in the early 1700s and sang at court in performances for royal birthdays in 1697, 1704, and 1706. John Hodgson was sued for debt three times in the early 1690s, and in June 1699, when bailiffs trying to arrest him at the playhouse were beaten off by the players, his servant was &#145;cowardly run through the back by a baylif, and immediately dyed, having nothing but a stick in his hand&#146;  (Luttrell, 529). John Hodgson appears to have left the stage in 1701, but his wife remained a leading singer until shortly after the company's move to the Queen's Theatre in 1706. The mistaken statement that she was an oboist  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>) seems to arise from a mistranscription of an advertisement in the <span class="italic">Daily Courant</span> for 11 December 1703. After 1706, we know only of benefit performances for her in 1710, in 1718, and finally on 18 May 1719. It seems likely that she was the Mary Hudson of Cross Street, Holborn, buried at St Andrew's, Holborn, on 28 June 1719.<br>
