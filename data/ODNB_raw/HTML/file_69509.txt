<span class="headword">Hicks,  David Nightingale</span>  (1929&#150;1998), <span class="occ">interior designer and author</span>, was born on 25 March 1929 at The Hamlet, Little Coggeshall, Essex, the second son of Herbert Hicks (1863&#150;1941), stockbroker, and his wife, Iris Elsie Platten, a former actress. After a happy early childhood he became a pupil at Charterhouse School, but did not enjoy the experience, leaving on the advice of his housemaster before he was due to take the school certificate. He decided on a career in art and design, so enrolled at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London before undertaking his national service in the Royal Army Educational Corps, where he taught art for two years from 1949 to 1951. Afterwards he returned to the Central School, then travelled for a year around Europe before taking up a six-month job with the advertising firm J. Walter Thompson in 1954.<br>
<br>Hicks married Lady Pamela Carmen Louise Mountbatten (<i>b</i>. 1929), the daughter of Earl Mountbatten of Burma and Lady Edwina Mountbatten, on 13 January 1960 at Romsey Abbey. The couple had two daughters, Edwina and India, and one son, Ashley, during their thirty-eight-year marriage. His father-in-law and mother-in-law had been influential themselves in the world of interior design during the 1930s, combining European modernism with transatlantic glamour in their London residence.<br>
<br>Hicks embarked on his glittering career as an interior designer in 1954 when his mother moved from Essex into a new house in South Eaton Place, Belgravia, London, and invited her son to redesign the interior. Photographs of the makeover were published in the leading lifestyle magazine <span class="italic">House and Garden</span> during that year. The combination of strong colours such as scarlet, black, and cerulean blue in the library, the accent on crisp outline, and the detailed table-top arrangements or &#145;tablescapes&#146;, all characterize Hicks's design work. The article attracted the attention of Mrs Rex Benson, former wife of the publisher Cond&eacute; Nast, and the pair worked together on some modest commissions during the early 1950s.<br>
<br>In 1956 Hicks entered a business partnership with the antique dealer Tom Parr. They opened their own shop, Hicks and Parr, located on Lowndes Street off Belgrave Square, London, in 1958, and Hicks's unique style began to make an impact. In 1959 the partnership ended and Parr went on to run the decorating firm of Colefax and Fowler while Hicks opened his own shop, David Hicks Ltd, on Lowndes Street in 1959. From this base he ran his retail and decorating business, undertaking commissions for London flats and country houses owned by aristocratic patrons. The show-window displays, which changed weekly, presented objects from around the world in uncompromising arrangements and attracted much notoriety among his upper-class client base.<br>
<br>During the early 1960s Hicks contributed to the renaissance in British culture at a time when British pop groups, fashion designers, photographers, and models dominated the international scene. He was featured in <span class="italic">David Bailey's Box of Pin-Ups</span> in 1965 as one of the young style gurus based in &#145;swinging London&#146;. His first marital home, in Britwell Salome in Oxfordshire, which dated back to 1728, underwent the Hicks treatment. This began with a classical re-creation of eighteenth-century interiors, but he soon branched out into more adventurous colour combinations and furniture arrangements. It included combinations of pink, orange, and aubergine or contrasting green, lurid yellow, and scarlet. The library had matt black walls, and white ceiling and woodwork, with the books bound in crimson, scarlet, and vermilion. These interiors were featured in his second book, <span class="italic">David Hicks on Living&#151;with Taste</span>, published in 1968. Hicks wrote eight books on various aspects of interior design between 1966 and 1987. All were lavishly illustrated and featured his own schemes, with information on how to achieve a similar effect. They also included Hicks's strong opinions on design, for example:<blockquote>I dislike brightly coloured front doors&#151;they are more stylish painted white, black or other dark colours. I hate wrought iron. I loathe colour used on modern buildings&#151;it should be inside. I do not like conventional standard lamps&#151;I prefer functional floorstanding reading lights. Function is just as important as aesthetics &hellip; Function dictates design. (Hicks, <span class="italic">Living with Design</span>, 252&#150;3)</blockquote>In 1969 Hicks designed his most prestigious interior to date, that of the Q4 nightclub on the <i>Queen Elizabeth II</i> ocean liner. This featured walls covered with grey flannel, offset by silver borders and bright red screens to be drawn across the windows at night. Other commissions, in London, included the Raffles nightclub in Chelsea and beauty salons for Helena Rubenstein Ltd. The growth in Hicks's reputation led to the foundation of David Hicks Marketing Ltd in 1970, with branch offices opening in Switzerland, France, Belgium, Germany, Pakistan, and Australia. He expanded into furniture design, textiles, ceramic tiles, and clothing, employing a wide range of designers worldwide. He designed clothing and fashion accessories for the Association of Japanese Manufacturers from 1977 and womenswear collections from 1982. One of his trademarks was his use of bold, geometrically patterned carpets and textiles&#151;particularly influential in American interior decoration. The leading post-war interior decorator Billy Baldwin proclaimed that Hicks had &#145;revolutionised the floors of the world with his small-patterned and striped carpeting&#146;  (M. J. Pool, ed., <span class="italic">20th Century Decorating, Architecture and Gardens</span>, New York, 1980, 10).<br>
<br>Hicks continued to design for the aristocracy as well as undertaking official state commissions in the 1970s and 1980s. The connections made through his marriage to Lady Pamela Mountbatten plus his suave good looks enhanced his career. Clients included Princess Anne, the prince of Wales, President Nkrumah of Ghana, and the sultan of Oman. He also received commissions to decorate the library of the British embassy in Washington and offices for Aeroflot. His interest in architectural design grew, and in his late fifties he designed a Palladian villa in Portugal for himself and his family.<br>
<br>David Hicks's contribution to the world of design was honoured in 1970 with a Design Council award. In 1977 he followed in the footsteps of his grandfather and father by becoming a master of the Worshipful Company of Salters. David Hicks died at his home, The Grove, Brightwell Baldwin, Oxfordshire, on 29 March 1998. He was survived by his wife.<br>
