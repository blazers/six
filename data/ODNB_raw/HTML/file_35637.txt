</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Quarrier,  William</span>  (1829&#150;1903), <span class="occ">philanthropist</span>, was born in Greenock on 16 September 1829, the only son and second of three children of William Quarrier, a ship's carpenter, and his wife, Annie Booklass. When William was three years old his father died of cholera and was buried in Quebec. Shortly afterwards the family moved to Glasgow where his mother provided for her children by doing fine sewing and laundry work. At the age of six years Quarrier started work in a pin factory, where, for ten hours a day, working a hand-machine, he put heads on ladies' hat pins. He was paid 1<i>s</i>. a week. His mother realized that this was a job with very little future, and at the age of eight years he began an apprenticeship as a boot and shoemaker, becoming a qualified journeyman by the age of twelve. In his first Orphan Homes annual report Quarrier recorded the thoughts he had at the end of the first week of his apprenticeship, recalling how, bareheaded and barefoot, cold and hungry, he had stood in the high street of Glasgow, wondering at the lack of compassion shown by passers-by.<br>
<br>Eventually Quarrier found employment with a Mrs Hunter, who owned a shoe shop in Argyle Street, Glasgow. She was a member of Blackfriars Baptist Church, which she encouraged Quarrier to attend. He soon became very active in church life and was soon appointed church officer. At the age of twenty-three he established his own shoemaking business, and on 2 December 1856 married Isabella, the daughter of Mrs Hunter. By 1864 Quarrier and his wife had a family of four (three girls and one boy) and his business was prospering. He was, in fact, one of the first multiple shoe-shop owners in Glasgow, with shops in Argyle Street, Anderston, and Cowcaddens. During this period his younger sister, who had been widowed, died, leaving three children. The Quarriers took them in and cared for them as part of their family.<br>
<br>Quarrier had not forgotten the hardships of his early life, and when, travelling home one night, he met a young boy crying over the theft of his matchbox stock by an older boy, he determined to do something to alleviate the plight of street children like him. After discussions with friends, he decided to establish a Shoeblack Brigade, a self-help group. The boys wore a simple uniform consisting of a cap, navy blue jacket trimmed with red, a red badge on the arm, and dark trousers. Each was provided with a box of brushes, blacking, and all that was required for the job. The aim was that they would be united in their work and would respect each other. Each boy kept 8<i>d</i>. out of every shilling, and 4<i>d</i>. was paid into a common fund from which all the shoeblacks' needs were to be met. In addition, they were required to attend a night class which Quarrier set up and they were expected to attend a Sunday school. Soon Quarrier turned his attention to another section of Glasgow's underprivileged young, the children hawking newspapers in the streets. They, too, were turned into a brigade with school lessons during the morning. Within a year of the formation of the Shoeblack Brigade, the third of the groups came into being. This was the Parcel Brigade. Wearing a canvas tunic, black belt, and a special badge, they carried parcels for citizens at a rate of 2<i>d</i>. per half mile, 3<i>d</i>. a mile. The parcels carried had their delivery guaranteed by the brigade. Quarrier was one of the prime movers in getting the town council to take responsibility for the young vendors. They, however, were slow to move and for some years the brigades worked in the face of continuing difficulties. Eventually, with changes in education, social conditions, and the organization of labour, the brigades were dissolved. Quarrier's initial vision had led to a major philanthropic endeavour in Scotland's largest city, which had met with considerable success. After the dissolution of the brigades, he turned his attention to another project. While working with the brigades, he had met Annie MacPherson, a Quaker working in the East End of London who was involved in Canadian immigration work. She convinced Quarrier that this might be a way forward. In September 1871 he wrote a letter which appeared in the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span> and <span class="italic">North British Daily Mail</span> pleading the cause of the destitute children of Glasgow. Thomas Corbett, on reading this letter, forwarded &pound;2000 to allow William Quarrier to open the first of his homes for orphaned children at 10 Renfrew Lane in 1871. Within six months he had thirty-five children ready to emigrate to Canada. The home at Renfrew Lane soon proved too small and the girls were transferred to a rented house in Renfield Street. During this time a night refuge and mission hall were established in Dovehill. In 1872, with the need for expansion, the boys moved to Cessnock House&#151;a mansion in the suburbs of Govan. Later the girls moved to Newstead and Elmpark homes which were in the same neighbourhood as Cessnock House. The premises at Dovehill were bought by the Glasgow school board but the need for a night refuge remained. In 1875 a new building was erected in James Morrison Street to provide accommodation and a mission hall. This building became known as the City Orphan Home, and eventually provided accommodation for working boys and girls and served as a receiving home for children who were subsequently transferred to Quarrier's Village at Bridge of Weir.<br>
<br>In Quarrier's first annual report, which he entitled <span class="italic">A Narrative of Facts Relative to the Work Done for Christ</span>, Quarrier developed his concept of cottage homes, which represented a new departure in the care of dependent children. In this document he discussed the establishment of an orphanage near Glasgow, open to children from any part of Scotland, which would consist of adjacent cottages, each able to accommodate twenty or thirty children. A &#145;father&#146; and &#145;mother&#146; would head each household, and a playground would be attached to each cottage. A central school and workshop would be established, and the fathers of the households would each be able to teach a different trade, while the mothers would cook for the households, with assistance if necessary. Each boy would learn the trade to which he was best suited, and all the children would meet together at school and church, and, on special occasions, in the common playground. Quarrier hoped, by these new arrangements, to keep up &#145;the family and home feeling&#146; among the children; he criticized the traditional institutions for orphans, where the &#145;strict uniformity&#146; necessary for the management of large numbers of children destroyed any domestic attachment.<br>
<br>The village at Bridge of Weir was the realization of Quarrier's ideal. In 1876 he purchased 40 acres of farmland at this site, which was 16 miles west of Glasgow, and in September 1878 the first buildings of what was to become known as Orphan Homes of Scotland were officially opened. The houses were built chiefly through the gifts of individual friends. Quarrier's Village grew, with more than fifty houses, a school, church, and dairy, poultry farms and workshops. From 1872, when the first thirty-five children went to Canada through Annie MacPherson's immigration scheme, until 1932, Quarrier and his successors continued to send boys and girls to Canada.<br>
<br>In 1887 Quarrier established his own distribution home at Brockville, Ontario. As he did for the children who remained in Scotland, Quarrier fought for and defended the members of his large family. In 1897 he fell out with the Canadian authorities over proposed legislation which would &#145;mark&#146; all children entering the country through schemes such as his. Each distribution home was to be licensed and a dossier kept on each child, classified until they were eighteen years of age. Quarrier felt that since the regulations were to apply only to children such as those he brought to Canada, it amounted to unjust treatment. As he was in Canada at the time, he discussed the legislation with the Canadian premier and members of the Ontario legislature, who had nothing but praise for his work and for the children he sent. But he did not receive a satisfactory answer to his queries concerning the act, which was passed in 1897; Quarrier immediately stopped his scheme. Immigration was later restarted in the year following Quarrier's death by his son-in-law, who had satisfied himself that all was in order.<br>
<br>In 1896 another of Quarrier's initiatives, a consumption sanatorium, was opened, and in 1906, three years after his death, his daughter opened a centre for epileptics, which was Quarrier's third area of concern. He died on 16 October 1903 at Quarrier's Homes at Bridge of Weir and was buried in Quarrier's Village. His wife, Isabella, died on 22 June 1904. The administration of the homes was continued by members of the family, together with elected trustees. In 1948 the consumption sanatorium was brought under the management of the local health board. At the end of the twentieth century Quarrier's homes were administered by a council of management and a team of senior managers, who were jointly responsible for the continuing and diverse work of this organization, which remained as a living memorial to the energy and achievement of nineteenth-century Scottish philanthropy.<br>
