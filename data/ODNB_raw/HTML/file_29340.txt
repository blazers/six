<span class="headword">Whood,  Isaac</span>  (1688/9&#150;1752), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, practised for many years as a portrait painter and professional copyist in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and was a skilful imitator of the style of Sir Godfrey Kneller. He was especially patronized in the 1730s by the duke of Bedford, for whom he painted numerous portraits of members of the Spencer and Russell families to hang at Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire; some of these were copied by Whood from other painters.<br>
<br>There is a good portrait of Archbishop Wake by Whood at Lambeth Palace, painted in 1736. At Cambridge there are portraits by Whood at Trinity College, including Roger Gale (1738), and Trinity Hall. His portraits of ladies were some of the best of that date. These include, in 1735, <span class="italic">Anne, Third Duchess of Bedford</span> and, in 1737, <span class="italic">Lady Georgina Spencer</span> (both Woburn Abbey), of which Sir George Scharf commented &#145;spiritedly painted, with much breadth of treatment&#146;  (Scharf, 127). Some of his portraits were engraved in mezzotint, notably one of Laurent Delvaux the sculptor (1734), engraved by Alexander van Haecken (1735), who assisted Whood &#145;to dress and adorn his pictures with silks satins velvets embroideryes&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 125) and finished a portrait of J. M. Rysbrack after Whood's death, and several by John Faber junior in the 1740s. Whood's drawings in chalk or black lead on vellum are of interest, particularly those now known of Dean Swift (NG Ire.) and William Stukeley (1725; Society of Antiquaries, London; 1727; Bodl. Oxf.), and Vertue wrote that he had &#145;much advanc'd his knowledge &amp; pencil with more freedom and correctnes abundantly&#146;  (ibid., 58). In 1743 he executed a series of designs to illustrate Samuel Butler's <span class="italic">Hudibras</span>.<br>
<br>As a portraitist Whood was &#145;as eminent a figure in that Art, as any of that Profession&#146; and &#145;a most humorous and agreeable companion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Advertiser</span>, 3 March 1752, in Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 160). He was a member of the Spalding Gentlemen's Society (1721) and the Society of Antiquaries (<i>c</i>.1751). His finances in later years were severely restricted as a result of a lawsuit over an estate. He died in Bloomsbury Square, London, on 24 or 26 February 1752, aged sixty-three; the duke of Bedford paid his funeral expenses.<br>
