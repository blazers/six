<span class="headword">Oldfield,  Thomas</span>  (1756&#150;1799), <span class="occ">marine officer</span>, was born at Stone, Staffordshire, on 21 June 1756, the third son of Humphrey Oldfield (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1775), also an officer in the Royal Marines; his mother was Elizabeth, daughter of Major-General Nicholls, of the East India Company.<br>
<br>Oldfield accompanied his father to America in the autumn of 1774, or in the following spring, and served as a volunteer with the marine battalion at Bunker Hill on 17 June 1775. In this action he was twice wounded, and his wrist permanently injured. Shortly afterwards, his father died and Oldfield accepted a commission in a provincial loyalist corps&#151;possibly the mounted legion led by Lieutenant-Colonel Banastre Tarleton. In 1776 he took up a commission in the Royal Marines which was intended for his brother, but which had been made out in his name by mistake. He was promoted to first lieutenant on 16 April 1778, but at the siege of Charles Town, South Carolina, in 1780, he served with the 63rd regiment. Noticed for his intelligence and gallantry, he was placed on the staff of the quartermaster-general's department, and as deputy assistant quartermaster-general he was attached to the headquarters of Lord Cornwallis and to Lord Rawdon who both repeatedly testified to his zeal, gallantry, and ability. He was taken prisoner with Lord Cornwallis at the capitulation of Yorktown.<br>
<br>After the war Oldfield returned to England, and while quartered at Portsmouth, purchased a small place in the parish of Westbourne, which he named Oldfield Lawn. It was presumably at this time that he married, and started a family; details of his wife are not known.<br>
<br>In 1788 Oldfield went to the West Indies, but returned in very poor health. He was promoted captain in 1793 and returned to the West Indies in the <i>Sceptre</i> (64 guns, Captain Dacres). In 1794 Oldfield commanded the Royal Marines landed from the squadron to co-operate with the army on the island of Santo Domingo. He reputedly distinguished himself on every possible occasion. In storming one of the enemy's works at San Nicolas Mole he was the first to enter it, and with his own hand struck the enemy's colours. He returned to England in the autumn of 1795, again in precarious health.<br>
<br>In 1796 Oldfield was employed on the recruiting service at Manchester and Warrington. The following year he embarked on board the <i>Theseus</i> (74 guns), and sailed to join the squadron under the orders of the earl of St Vincent off Cadiz. Upon the <i>Theseus</i>'s reaching her destination she became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson, then serving under St Vincent. Oldfield was wounded on the night of 5 July 1797 during the bombardment of the Spanish fleet in Cadiz, while in a boat with Nelson. His wound could not have been too serious, however, for he quickly recovered and on the night of 24 July was able to lead the marines in Nelson's brave but disastrous attack on Santa Cruz, Tenerife. In attempting to land, his boat was swamped, but he swam ashore, and on landing injured himself. Oldfield looked back on these events as the hardest actions he had fought.<br>
<br>In 1798 the <i>Theseus</i> was detached to join Nelson, who had shifted his flag to the <i>Vanguard</i> and gone in pursuit of the French squadron up the Mediterranean. Oldfield related in a private letter how, after the disappointment of not finding the French fleet at Alexandria, the <i>Zealous</i> made the signal at midday on 1 August that it was in Abu Qir Bay. At 3.30 p.m. the French fleet was plainly seen, and an hour later Nelson ordered the <i>Theseus</i> to go ahead of him. Oldfield in the <i>Theseus</i> was alongside the <i>Guerrier</i> at a quarter to seven and having poured in a broadside which carried away the latter's main and mizen masts, she passed on to the <i>Spartiole</i> and anchored abreast of her, Nelson anchoring on the other side ten minutes later. After the action, Oldfield (the senior Royal Marines officer in Nelson's fleet) was sent with his marines to the <i>Tonnant</i>, to guard upwards of 600 prisoners.<br>
<br>Oldfield was promoted major on 7 October 1798, and the <i>Theseus</i> spent some time at Gibraltar and Lisbon repairing damage sustained in the battle of the Nile. Then, with Oldfield on board, she was sent to join the blockade of the French army in Alexandria, and arrived there on 2 February 1799. On 8 March she sailed for Acre under Sir Sidney Smith's orders to organize the defences of that town against Bonaparte's advancing army, arriving on 12 March and being joined by Smith himself in the <i>Tigre</i> three days later. For two months British seamen and marines from the two ships, along with the Turkish defenders, were besieged in the town by 15,000 French troops. But Oldfield did not live to see the siege lifted on 20 May. At daybreak on 7 April a party of the defenders with Oldfield leading the centre of three columns sallied out from the walls to attack and destroy a mine which was being dug by the French to weaken their defences. Oldfield's column advanced to the entrance of the mine and according to General Berthier, chief of staff of the French army in Egypt, attacked like heroes. Oldfield was one of the first to be cut down. Both sides tried to recover his body, a French grenadier succeeding, reputedly by hooking a halberd into Oldfield's side and dragging him off, only to discover that he was still alive. Oldfield died shortly afterwards, and was buried with full military honours by the French, in recognition of his bravery. A tablet to his memory was later erected in the garrison chapel, Portsmouth. Sir Sidney Smith praised Oldfield's courage in his official dispatch; and Napoleon, on his way to exile on St Helena, is said to have spoken of Oldfield's gallantry to the marine officers on board the <i>Northumberland</i>.<br>
