<span class="headword">Currie,  (William) Finlay</span>  (1878&#150;1968), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 20 January 1878, at 35 Cumberland Street, Edinburgh, son of Annie Currie, Post Office clerk (his birth certificate states he was illegitimate and names no father). He completed his education at George Watson's College, Edinburgh, and began his adult working life as an organist and choirmaster. However, he was attracted to the theatre and he began what turned out to be a successful career on the variety stage with an inauspicious appearance as a courtier in W. H. Murray's <span class="italic">Cramond Brig</span> at the Pavilion, Edinburgh, in 1898. He then joined Adeler and Sutton's Pierrots, touring Scotland in concert parties. With his own act sufficiently developed Currie made his independent London d&eacute;but in June 1902 at the South London Music-Hall, billed as &#145;Harry Colvo, the double-voiced vocalist&#146;. By 1906 he was well enough established on the variety stage to undertake an American tour that included New York, where he played at Tony Pastor's renowned Vaudeville theatre on 14th Street. This success was followed by a period of over ten years working in Australia as the principal comedian in the company managed by Sir Benjamin Fuller. Finlay Currie's variety career is reported to have been encouraged by Harry Lauder. Currie returned to London in 1930 and pursued a career on the legitimate stage which tended to be overshadowed by his subsequent relatively high film profile. He appeared in more than twenty West End plays between 1930 and 1950, including Edgar Wallace's <span class="italic">The Case of the Frightened Lady</span> at Wyndham's Theatre in 1931; <span class="italic">Magnolia Street</span> by Golding and Rawlinson at the Adelphi in 1934; <span class="italic">Duet in Floodlight</span> by J. B. Priestley at the Apollo in 1935; Ivor Novello's <span class="italic">Crest of the Wave</span> at Drury Lane in 1937; and Arthur Miller's <span class="italic">Death of a Salesman</span> at the Phoenix in 1949. During this time he acted with various companies such as the Venturers, the Repertory Players, and the Stage Society. It was, however, on screen that Finlay Currie was destined to gain wide and lasting recognition as a talented and thoroughly professional character actor. In the film world he enjoyed the reputation of being willing to work in the most exacting circumstances, often travelling far to fulfil an engagement. His first film, <span class="italic">The Case of the Frightened Lady</span> (1932), marked the beginning of a long and successful career. Halliwell's <span class="italic">Filmgoer's Companion</span> (1977) described him as &#145;a welcome screen face well into his eighties&#146;. In fact, increasing age, a portly physique, and craggy features framed by a mane of white hair made him a much sought after actor in biblical and historical epics, including <span class="italic">Quo Vadis</span> (1951), <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span> (1952), <span class="italic">Rob Roy</span> (1953), <span class="italic">Ben Hur</span> (1959), and <span class="italic">The Fall of the Roman Empire</span> (1964). He was instantly recognizable on screen, with the soft Scottish accent that he never completely disguised. His film credits, impressive in their diversity, include also <span class="italic">Rome Express</span> (1932), <span class="italic">The Edge of the World</span> (1938), <span class="italic">The Brothers</span> (1946), <span class="italic">The History of Mr Polly</span> (1949), <span class="italic">Billy Liar</span> (1963), and <span class="italic">Bunny Lake is Missing</span> (1965). While the nature of character acting often confines the actor to supporting roles, it does not inhibit the possibility of fine performances, and in 1951 Currie's portrayal of Queen Victoria's highland servant John Brown in <span class="italic">The Mudlark</span> earned him high praise. But he gave possibly his most memorable performance as the convict Magwitch in the David Lean version of <span class="italic">Great Expectations</span> in 1946.<br>
<br>Currie continued to accept stage and television roles regardless of advancing years. The year 1965 saw him celebrating his eighty-seventh birthday by opening in a play in Connecticut in the USA, and at eighty-nine he played the bishop in the BBC television version of <span class="italic">Les mis&eacute;rables</span>, confirming his stamina and enduring appeal. A quiet man, in his private life he took his recreation in book collecting; maintaining his Scottish connections, he particularly favoured the work of Robert Burns. Finlay Currie was married to the American variety actress Maud Courtney (1884&#150;1959), who first appeared on the London stage in 1901. She was the original performer of the song &#145;The Honeysuckle and the Bee&#146;. They worked together for a time with Currie billed as &#145;Mr C&#146; in <span class="italic">Sketches at the Piano</span>. They had two children, George and Marion. Finlay Currie died from kidney and heart failure on 10 May 1968, at Chalfont and Gerrards Cross Hospital in Buckinghamshire.<br>
