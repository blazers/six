<span class="headword">Asher,  Alexander</span>  (1834&#150;1905), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born at Inveravon, Banffshire, on 27 January 1834, the third son and fifth child in the family of five sons and four daughters of William Asher DD (1791&#150;1874), parish minister of Inveravon, and his wife, Katherine Forbes (<i>d</i>. 1880), daughter of John Gordon, minister of Duffus. After education at Elgin Academy and at King's College, Aberdeen, he entered Edinburgh University, where he was a member of the Speculative Society (president 1863&#150;5), but did not graduate. After passing to the Scottish bar on 10 December 1861, he gradually acquired a large practice and became one of the most distinguished counsels of his day, his only rival being John Blair Balfour, first Baron Kinross. He took a leading part in numerous cases which attracted public attention, and he represented the United Free Church in litigation which ended in 1904 with the defeat of that body. A strong Liberal in politics, he was appointed advocate-depute in 1870, during the Gladstone ministry of 1868&#150;74. He married in the same year Caroline Julia, daughter of the Revd Charles Henry Gregan Craufurd, rector of Old Swinford, Stourbridge, Worcestershire; they had no children.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1880 Asher was unsuccessful as Liberal candidate for the universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen; but in 1881 he was elected for the Elgin burghs (in succession to Sir M. E. Grant Duff) and retained this seat for the rest of his life. He made no great mark in the House of Commons, where he followed Gladstone in his support of home rule. Meanwhile in 1881 he became QC; he was an inconspicuous solicitor-general for Scotland during Gladstone's later ministries in the years 1881&#150;5, 1886, and 1892&#150;4, and was deputy lieutenant of Edinburgh. He received the honorary degree of LLD from the universities of Aberdeen (1883) and Edinburgh (1891). In 1894 he resigned office, &#145;largely&#146;, it was said, &#145;owing to the very inadequate remuneration then paid to the Scottish solicitor-general&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>), and in the following year was elected dean of the Faculty of Advocates. Suddenly taken ill in London on 4 July 1905, he died on 5 August at his house, Beechwood, Murrayfield, Edinburgh, and was buried in the churchyard of Corstorphine.<br>
