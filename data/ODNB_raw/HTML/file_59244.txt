<span class="headword">Vigor <span class="st"> [<em>other married names </em>Ward, Rondeau]</span>,  Jane</span>  (1699&#150;1783), <span class="occ">travel writer</span>, was probably the daughter of the Revd Edward Goodwin of Rawmarsh Hall, Yorkshire, and Jane Wainwright. Her father had a considerable fortune, which his daughter inherited on the death of her brother. In 1728, probably shortly after this event, she was married to Thomas Ward (son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28681/', "Sir Edward Ward")</script>, former chief baron of the exchequer), and accompanied him to St Petersburg on his appointment that year to the post of consul-general to Russia and agent of the Russia Company. He died suddenly in February 1731 and was succeeded by his secretary, Claudius Rondeau, the son of a French protestant who had settled in England, who swiftly married his predecessor's widow on 23 November 1731. Rondeau served the British government effectively, and managed to reconcile the bickering factions within the Russia Company at St Petersburg. However, he was a delicate man and died in October 1739, and his widow, who had also been suffering from ill health, returned to England. Empress Anna, &#145;having a particular benevolence towards the said Widow&#146;, sent her home with a letter of recommendation to George II, requesting his &#145;consolation in the melancholy Station she is in&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 102/50). Mrs Rondeau seems not to have needed this support, however, since she was accompanied on her voyage home by William Vigor (<i>d</i>. 1767), a merchant and a Quaker, whom she married in 1740.<br>
<br>Thereafter Mrs Vigor's life seems to have been lived quietly at Taplow and Windsor until the publication in 1775 of <span class="italic">Letters from a Lady who Resided some Years in Russia, to her Friend in England</span>. John Nichols states that &#145;she was in a manner obliged to publish, to prevent a spurious and incorrect copy from being obtruded on the world&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.209). Although anonymous, the authorship of the <span class="italic">Letters</span> was at once widely known. They were favourably reviewed and translated into German, French, and Dutch by 1776. A second English edition (corrected) was printed in 1777. Mrs Vigor featured as a character in a fictionalized series entitled <span class="italic">Letters from Henrietta to Morvina. Interspersed with Anecdotes, Historical and Amusing</span>, which also plagiarized her work and was therefore greeted with critical derision on its publication in 1779. In 1784 (after Mrs Vigor's death the preceding year) was published <span class="italic">Eleven Additional Letters from Russia</span>, &#145;found among her papers since her decease&#146;  (p. v), with a short biographical preface and some historical notes. These letters date from her earliest years at St Petersburg as Mrs Ward. They are more personally revealing than the letters she had herself published, but, like the earlier ones, they offer a unique eyewitness account of imperial and expatriate society at St Petersburg. She makes sophisticated use of the epistolary form, constructing a playful relationship with her female correspondent not unlike that between Anna Howe and Clarissa in Richardson's novel. Contemporary reviewers praised especially the <span class="italic">Letters</span>' anecdotes of courtly occasions (such as the marriage and death of Peter II), and of aristocratic intrigue and romance. The <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> pronounced the <span class="italic">Letters</span> &#145;agreeably written, somewhat in the lively manner of Lady Montagu&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, Sept 1775, 211).<br>
<br>Mrs Vigor seems not to have had children (her will makes provision for a servant and for the daughter of a local labourer). William Vigor died in October 1767, and she survived him until her own death at Windsor on 6 September 1783. She was buried beside him in the churchyard at Taplow. John Nichols recalls that having &#145;lived much in the world, and being well acquainted with books, her conversation was the delight of all who had the pleasure of knowing her&#146;, and reports that her loss was &#145;severely felt by the neighbouring poor, amongst whom she was constantly searching after proper objects for the exertion of her charity and benevolence&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 3.209). Another Englishwoman resident in St Petersburg during the 1730s, the governess Elizabeth Justice, observed of Mrs Rondeau that she was &#145;a fine woman; very tall, and perfectly genteel&#146;, and &#145;in all her answers, even to her inferiors, she shows the greatest condescension, and most obliging temper&#146;  (Justice, 40).<br>
