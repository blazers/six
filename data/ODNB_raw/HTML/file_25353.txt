</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shepstone, Sir  Theophilus</span>  (1817&#150;1893), <span class="occ">politician in Natal</span>, was born on 8 January 1817 at Westbury-on-Trym, on the outskirts of Bristol, Gloucestershire, the son of (John) William Shepstone (1796&#150;1873), stonemason and Methodist missionary, and his wife, Elizabeth Brooks (1793&#150;1833). In 1820 the Shepstone family joined one of the parties of English settlers recruited to establish farming settlements near the eastern frontier of Cape Colony in South Africa. For three years after landing with his family at Algoa Bay on 1 May 1820, William Shepstone was engaged in building work at Bathurst and Grahamstown. His abilities as a lay preacher attracted the attention of Methodist missionary superintendent William Shaw who was looking for men to establish stations beyond the Cape frontier. In 1823 William became assistant missionary at Wesleyville; from there he moved on to various missionary postings among the Xhosa. Theophilus was mainly educated at home, where he acquired from his African playmates a thorough colloquial knowledge of the Xhosa language, as well as his African name, Somtseu. As early as the age of ten he was already assisting missionary William Shrewsbury as an interpreter. By the age of fifteen he was collaborating with William Boyce in preparing the first Xhosa grammar and translations of religious materials.<br>
<br>After a brief period of formal schooling at Salem, Shepstone entered government service on his eighteenth birthday, as interpreter of native languages at Cape Town. At the outbreak of the Cape Frontier War of 1834&#150;5 he was appointed to the military headquarters staff of Sir Benjamin D'Urban. After the war he was appointed clerk and general interpreter to the agent-general responsible for British resident officers beyond the frontier. From the middle of 1836 to the end of 1838 he lived mostly at Grahamstown where he met his future wife, Maria (1816&#150;1893), whose father, Charles Palmer, was responsible for military transport. On 11 November 1838 the couple married at the Cape Town home of Colonel Harry Smith. Eight days later Shepstone sailed with Major Samuel Charters's expeditionary force to Port Natal, whose hinterland was then convulsed by warfare between Boer settlers and the Zulu kingdom. After returning to Grahamstown in February 1839, Theophilus took up an appointment as resident agent at Fort Peddie, charged with the oversight of local Xhosa chiefs and the reservation set aside for Mfengu refugees. He enjoyed his life as adviser to chiefs and would seek, unsuccessfully, on several later occasions to convince British authorities to appoint him to administer some African territory where he might rule as supreme chief over a host of lesser chiefs, raising revenue from hut taxes and dispensing justice according to customary law.<br>
<br>At the end of 1845 Shepstone moved to the new British colony of Natal, initially as diplomatic agent to natives, and subsequently secretary for native affairs. In this position for thirty years Shepstone wielded enormous power over the African population of the region. In the face of determined early opposition from officials and white settlers he succeeded in securing large reserved territories for exclusively African occupation. He also won Colonial Office approval for his policy of ruling the black population through their own chiefs in accordance with customary usages. In many ways his policy resembled the practice of &#145;indirect rule&#146; by which much of British colonial Africa was governed in the first half of the twentieth century. Shepstone's first preference was for direct administration through magistrates with a solid grounding in Zulu language and culture. A shortage of resources forced him to make much greater use of chiefs than he had anticipated. His aim was gradually to supplant hereditary chiefs with appointed African officials whose positions would depend entirely on government preferment. Likewise, in relation to customary law, he hoped gradually to supplant African usages with European &#145;civilization&#146;. Under his administration he elaborated a system of &#145;native law&#146; to which virtually all Africans were subjected. His tolerance for polygamy and bride prices paid in cattle was condemned by most settlers and missionaries, but helped him, in the longer run, to acquire a reputation for tolerance motivated by a humane cultural relativism. The key to his early success was the raising of large sums through taxes and other charges levied on Africans. By the final years of his administration direct and indirect African contributions to the Natal treasury amounted to about three quarters of total government revenue. As an appointed member of the legislative council Shepstone was frequently attacked by white settler representatives who wanted to force more men into wage labour by reducing the land available for African occupation. Shepstone, however, could generally count on the support of large landowners who depended on rents paid by African tenants and by coastal sugar planters who looked to Shepstone to provide a steady flow of African migrant labourers from neighbouring territories. In his speeches to the legislative council Shepstone argued that any drastic reduction in African lands would inspire an armed rebellion that might quickly overwhelm the small white population.<br>
<br>Shepstone's fear of uprisings, perhaps born of his experiences on the strife-torn eastern Cape frontier, seems to have been entirely genuine. At the slightest hint of opposition he showed African chiefs the iron fist concealed beneath the velvet glove of cultural tolerance. In 1848, when Chief Fodo refused an order, he and his people were chased by government forces over the southern boundary of the colony. In 1857 Shepstone ruthlessly crushed opposition from chiefs Sidoi and Matshana. He created an African police force commanded by his <i>indunas</i>, men whose loyal service was rewarded by grants of cattle and women seized in battle. He believed that his system of administration, underpinned by his system of taxation, could be successfully applied to virtually any African territory. He longed to be given the opportunity to prove his claim, and was, for twenty years, supported in his ambitions by the bishop of Natal, John William Colenso. Shepstone's father had always regretted the Wesleyan break with the Church of England, so it was not so surprising that the son was confirmed in the Anglican faith in 1850 and began a lifelong involvement in church affairs. Colenso gave a theological underpinning to Shepstone's toleration of African customs, while Shepstone enthusiastically endorsed the liberal reading of scripture which caused Colenso to be tried for heresy. On at least three different occasions Colenso and Shepstone discussed going as a team into a neighbouring African territory to try out their missionary and administrative theories. Their plans were firmly squashed by the high commissioner, Sir George Grey, who said that the scheme was &#145;nothing else than that Great Britain should establish a new kingdom in South Africa&#151;and make Mr. Shepstone the King of that country&#146;  (Gordon, 176). In 1868 Shepstone only narrowly failed to secure the annexation of Basutoland which would have vastly extended the scope of his administration.<br>
<br>During the 1850s Colenso and Shepstone schemed to make Mkungu, one of the younger sons of the Zulu king Mpande, heir to his father's throne. By 1861 they had decided to throw their support behind another son, Cetshwayo. In a risky expedition, Shepstone went into Zululand to confer official British recognition on Cetshwayo as heir apparent. After the old ruler died Shepstone led a large delegation to install Cetshwayo as king (August 1873), an event that marked the high-water mark of his influence in Zulu affairs. At the end of the same year the long-standing friendship with Colenso dissolved in rounds of bitter recriminations over Shepstone's role in the capture and trial of the Hlubi chief Langalibalele, who had defied orders to hand in unregistered guns and tried to flee over the Drakensberg Mountains. The bishop now pronounced Shepstone's administration to be a corrupt tyranny and returned to England in an attempt to marshal support from various philanthropic societies. Shepstone was sent on behalf of the Natal government to convey its version of events to the colonial secretary, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13035/', "H. H. M. Herbert, fourth earl of Carnarvon")</script>. Although Carnarvon insisted on important reforms and sent Sir Garnet Wolseley to reform Natal's government, he was profoundly impressed by Shepstone's voluminous knowledge of African affairs both inside and outside the borders of the colonies. In 1876, when Shepstone travelled to England to participate in the conference Carnarvon had convened to promote the idea of federating the various states and colonies of southern Africa, he was promoted to the rank of KCMG (he had been made CMG in 1869), and designated to lead a delegation to the financially troubled Transvaal republic in January 1877. Invoking the secret commission he held to annex the territory if circumstances warranted, Shepstone raised the union flag on 18 April. For two tumultuous years he served as administrator of the Transvaal while recalcitrant Boers plotted to regain their independence, treasury officials complained that Shepstone's finances were a shambles, and his own misjudgement of African affairs sped on a military confrontation with neighbouring rulers. His advice to Carnarvon and the new high commissioner for South Africa, Sir Bartle Frere, was that the threat of a united rising of all the independent African polities must be countered by extending the mantle of British suzerainty over them all. He wrongly believed that Sekhukhuni's Pedi would crumble before an advance of British forces, and supported the impossible ultimatum Frere issued to the Zulu king in December 1878. Sekhukhuni's stalwart resistance and the catastrophic British defeat at the hands of Zulu forces at Isandlwana&#151;where Shepstone's fourth son, George John Palmer, perished&#151;called his judgement into question on precisely the ground on which he was supposed to be most capable. He relinquished his commission as administrator of the Transvaal in March 1879 and left the public service in 1880.<br>
<br>After the election of 1880 brought Gladstone's Liberal government to power on a platform of anti-imperialism, Shepstone's name and work lay under a cloud. An uprising in the Transvaal led to re-establishment of a Boer republic, and Zululand was carved up into thirteen independent chieftainships. Shepstone found a champion in H. Rider Haggard, who had served on his staff in the Transvaal and whose book <span class="italic">Cetewayo and his White Neighbours</span> (1882) argued for the wisdom of his old chief's policies. Haggard's subsequent novels, including <span class="italic">King Solomon's Mines</span> and <span class="italic">Allan Quatermain</span>, helped popularize Shepstone's notion of governing Africans in accordance with their own customs and traditions. When it was decided to restore Cetshwayo as Zulu king in 1883, Shepstone emerged briefly from retirement to supervise the re-installation of the monarch. In the remaining decade of his life he had the satisfaction of seeing many of his sons and other relatives occupying important posts in African administration. Colonial opinion gradually came to regard Shepstone's policy of separate lands, laws, and leaders for the African population as the best way of ensuring the peaceful maintenance of white supremacy and reliable labour supplies. Later scholarship endorsed the judgement that he had been one of the chief architects of segregationist policies used to govern Africans in colonies stretching from the Cape to Kenya. Some have even gone so far as to give him the dubious distinction of having erected key pillars of the apartheid system which dominated South Africa for much of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Shepstone's wife died on 2 March 1893; he survived her by only a few months, succumbing to a respiratory illness on 23 June at Pietermaritzburg. He was buried two days later beside Maria in the old Anglican cemetery, Pietermaritzburg.<br>
