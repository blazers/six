<span class="headword">Baker,  Beatrice May</span>  (1876&#150;1973), <span class="occ">headmistress and internationalist</span>, was born at 2 High Street, Hereford on 4 May 1876, the third daughter and youngest child in the family of three daughters and a son of Edward Joseph Baker, a gentleman's tailor in Hereford, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pugh. The family's business, with premises in High Street, Hereford, was sufficiently successful to support a servant and allow all four children to attend Hereford high school. In 1896 Baker secured a &pound;30 bursary for three years in order to pursue an arts degree at Royal Holloway College. Perhaps for financial reasons, she remained at the college for only one year, but gained a London University BA degree, and took great pride throughout her working life in her university education.<br>
<br>A brief period boarding in Islington and working locally as a schoolmistress at the Central Foundation School preceded the decisive application for a teaching post in Cardiff in 1902. The Cardiff Intermediary School for Girls predated the local boys' high school by three years. Consequently, the founding headmistress Mary Collin enjoyed a rare degree of freedom in the development of its ethos. Collin and her deputy, Marion Layton, educated at Bedford College, London, and Newnham College, Cambridge, respectively, made exacting academic standards an intrinsic part of the new school's ethos, and their political beliefs and styles of leadership offer clues to Baker's political development. Collin was an advocate of women's suffrage, a supporter of the Women Citizens' Association when it opened a Cardiff branch in 1910, and a member of the Women's Liberal Association. Her personal style, which Baker adopted, combined carefully presented respectability with such overtly modern touches as the active encouragement of cycling. It was at Cardiff that Baker met her lifelong companion and deputy, Lucy Jane Rendall (1881/2&#150;1966).<br>
<br>In 1911 Baker accepted a post at a private school for the daughters of gentlemen lodged in Badminton House, in the suburb of Clifton, Bristol. After a brief trial period she became headmistress and proprietor, the school's third since its foundation in 1858. At the age of thirty-five she proceeded with Rendall to transform a modest, dignified private school into an ambitious academic and socially aware institution with a reputation that extended well beyond Bristol.<br>
<br>By 1918 five of Baker's eight staff had studied at Oxford, Cambridge, or London. Societies for the study of archaeology, debating, drama, and reading were founded. Staff and students established a holiday cottage for families from the Bristol slums, and girls were expected to be prepared to quote an item of news or poetry on demand. The transformation alienated some. One parent complained of a conscientious objector on the staff: &#145;they'll have to get rid of him, or I'll write to the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>&#146;  (Cooper, 7). But others were attracted to the combination of public-school aspirations and progressive ideology. Parents in the inter-war period included members of the Trevelyan family, the potter Bernard Leach, the publisher Victor Gollancz, the painter Stanley Spencer, and the poet and author Naomi Mitchison. By 1919 supporters agreed that Baker's ambitions for the school necessitated a move from Clifton to a graceful country house in the Bristol satellite town of Westbury-on-Trym. In 1931 Badminton was reconstituted as a public school, with a distinguished board of governors (including Gilbert Murray, Edith Major, and Ernest Barker) and a nascent national profile.<br>
<br>Baker's genius was to marry an internationalist ethos to the public-school tradition. The life of the school was interlaced with international rhetoric and symbolism, designed in Baker's words to create &#145;forward looking citizens of a new world&#146;  (Blewitt, 222). In practice this meant a near-veneration of the ideas and processes of the League of Nations, and a rejection of the emotive nationalism that prevailed in the school's competitors.<br>
<br>Baker's students carried excerpts from the covenant of the League of Nations in their pockets  (Conradi, 68). She led annual pilgrimages to the league's headquarters in Geneva. Bristol suburbs were subjected to conversion drives in support of the peace ballot, and nationalist heroes were supplanted by pacifist exemplars in a syllabus which presented British history as &#145;a dark legend of peasants being massacred by barons, the iniquities of the slave trade, and a wicked foreign office bent on reintroducing opium to the five ports&#146;  (Valery, 20). Activism and political protest were presented as legitimate, even necessary, forms of engagement with society and the state.<br>
<br>In the chapel Van Gogh's <span class="italic">Blue Cart</span> took the place of a crucifix behind the altar and the scripture was taken from anyone from Plato and Marx to those Baker called the &#145;modern prophets&#146;&#151;chiefly Emerson, Carlyle, and Thoreau. Christian duty was presented as a rejection of international and social divisions. As the author Iris Murdoch, once a pupil at Badminton, dryly observed, Jesus often had to share the stage with Lenin  (Storry, 53).<br>
<br>Baker took in the future Indian prime minister Indira Nehru, whose father languished in an Indian gaol, and won her lifelong respect, but refugees (there were many from Europe) found Baker an emotionally remote and demanding figure and even her admirers found her fierce idealism daunting. The Second World War, and the attendant collapse of the league and its aspirations, were a blow to Baker's idealistic vision of world citizenship. She led the school doggedly through its wartime relocation to Dorset, but retired in 1946. In retirement she entertained and corresponded with former students into her nineties.<br>
<br>Known universally as BMB, Baker was short of stature, had piercing blue eyes, and wore her silver hair tied firmly down with a black band. She died at Greyfriars Nursing Home, Nailsea, Somerset, on 28 September 1973.<br>
