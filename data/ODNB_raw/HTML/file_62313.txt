<span class="headword">Scafe,  John</span>  (1776&#150;1843), <span class="occ">poet and writer on geology</span>, was born on 19 June 1776 in London, the only son of William Scafe (1744&#150;1808), barrister, of The Leazes, Tanfield, Durham, and his wife, Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hodgson, of Fieldhouse, Darlington. Scafe matriculated at University College, Oxford, on 21 January 1794 but never graduated. In 1799 he obtained a commission as ensign in the army, and in 1805 attained the rank of captain in the 43rd regiment of foot. He resigned from the army in 1808 on the death of his father.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Scafe penned an &#145;Elegy to the River Isis&#146;. While on army service on Minorca in 1800, he composed other verses on &#145;Beautiful scenery&#146; and these, together with poems written while serving in Dublin in 1806, were subsequently published. Scafe first ventured into print in 1815 with a hesitant edition (six copies) of <span class="italic">Poems in Four Parts</span> published by J. Graham at Alnwick, where Scafe was then living. Four further volumes in similarly small editions were issued in 1817 and 1818. In 1818 Emerson Charnley of Newcastle published Scafe's collected <span class="italic">Poems</span> (150 copies). Scafe's publishers' lists of subscribers show that the majority were gentry living in Alnwick and its neighbourhood. One poem, <span class="italic">The Velocipede</span> of 1819, suggests an interest in technology, this early form of bicycle having been invented in Germany only two years previously.<br>
<br>Scafe, of whose poems it was later noted &#145;few are very bad&#146;  (&#145;Alnwick poets&#146;, 334&#150;5, 351), might have remained forgotten had not one of his volumes, a <i>jeu d'esprit</i> called <span class="italic">King Coal's Levee</span> (issued at Alnwick in 1818 in an edition of twenty-five copies), come to the attention of members of the Oxford school of geology late in 1818. The work treated the order of stratification of English rocks, and the utility of such knowledge, as a poetic court scene, and it was inspired by William Phillips's <span class="italic">Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales</span>. Geology was being popularized by the Geological Society in London (to which the last three editions of Scafe's <span class="italic">Levee</span> were dedicated). William Daniel Conybeare helped to expand the second edition (1819), with explanatory notes by William Buckland &#145;comprehending all the leading features of geology&#146;  (Buckland to Greenough, 26 March 1819, Greenough archives, UCL). Third (500 copies) and fourth editions (750) appeared in London in 1819 and 1820.<br>
<br>The book caused a sensation. Some accused Scafe of &#145;intending Personalities in it as Meaning to ridicule the Duke of Northumberland's Publick Days at Alnwick Castle&#146;  (Buckland to Mary Cole, 13 July 1819, NMG Wales). Others saw wider, national significance in such seditious times, with &#145;King Coal&#146; the symbolic monarch and &#145;The Pebbles&#146; the rabble&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1147/', "Robert Bakewell (1767&#150;1843)")</script> published a mocking commentary on this interpretation in his <span class="italic">Geological Primer in Verse</span> (1820), a work long thought to be by Scafe himself. In Germany, Goethe was differently impressed, since the book &#145;contains all the knowledge of geology a man wants&#146;  (Morley, 369) and showed how the English &#145;disseminate through both serious and light poetry what everyone ought to know&#146;  (Goethe, 332). Goethe planned a translation (1824) which was never completed.<br>
<br>The success of <span class="italic">King Coal's Levee</span> led to a sequel issued anonymously in 1820, <span class="italic">Court News &hellip; and the Errants</span>, the latter inspired by Buckland's &#145;Table of the order of &hellip; strata&#146; of 1818, in an edition of 250. This was printed and published by those involved with the earlier volume, so Scafe's authorship seems certain.<br>
<br>Scafe may have become interested in geology through the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society, of which he appears to have been a member from 1814. In 1852 Scafe's posthumous &#145;Minutes of the geology of Holy Island&#146;, with an originally coloured geological plan, appeared in Raine's <span class="italic">History and Antiquities of North Durham</span>. Scafe never married and lived at Alnwick from 1815. By 1838 he had moved to Bamburgh, where he was one of those who first brought the heroic exploits of Grace Darling (1815&#150;1842) in 1838 to public attention. Here he died on 24 December 1843 intestate, leaving an estate of under &pound;450.<br>
