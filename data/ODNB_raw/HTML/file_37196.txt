<span class="headword">Black,  Clementina Maria</span>  (1853&#150;1922), <span class="occ">political activist, suffragist, and writer</span>, was born on 27 July 1853 in Brighton, the eldest girl in the family of five daughters and three sons of David Black, solicitor, town clerk, and coroner of Brighton, and his wife, Clara Maria (1825&#150;1875), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21570/', "George Patten")</script>, portrait painter to the prince consort. Educated at home, mainly by her mother, she became fluent in French and German.<br>
<br>When Clementina Black was twenty-two her mother died, leaving her to look after the family, including an invalid father. A teaching job added to her duties, but she began to write short stories. These were followed by her first novel, <span class="italic">A Sussex Idyll</span> (1877), and a three-volume novel, <span class="italic">Orlando</span> (1879). In the 1880s she and her sisters (one of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33332/', "Constance Garnett")</script>) moved to Fitzroy Street, London. Here she divided her time between private studies (which included work on social problems) at the British Museum Library, literary work, and lecturing on eighteenth-century literature. She began associating with both Marxist and Fabian intellectual socialists and was a friend of the Marx family.<br>
<br>Ill health forced Black abroad in 1885 and she returned to England to the Trafalgar Square riots of 1886. This event made her determined to become actively involved in social issues. She promoted the idea of a consumers' league, whose members would purchase only from firms paying decent wages, and advocated closer ties between trade union and co-operative societies. In 1886 she became secretary to the Women's Protective and Provident League (founded by Emma Paterson), and as a delegate to the 1888 Trades Union Congress initiated an equal pay resolution. She resigned in 1889 after becoming actively involved in the match girls' strike in London's East End. Convinced that a more radical, militant approach to women's trade unionism was needed, she became one of the founders of the Women's Trade Union Association (WTUA) in the East End in 1889, supported by John Burns and H. H. Champion, well-known socialists, and served as secretary until 1891.<br>
<br>The failure of the WTUA in 1894 led to the formation of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/96080', "Women's Industrial Council (WIC)")</script>, a new kind of organization which sent out its mainly middle-class women investigators to see for themselves conditions of working women, after which they wrote reports in an attempt to influence public opinion and government policy. Clementina Black became editor of its journal, the <span class="italic">Women's Industrial News</span>, in 1895 and later president of the WIC. She became increasingly active as a speaker and writer on problems facing women workers. She saw low pay as the root of the problem, and from 1896 began to campaign for a legal minimum wage. She was concerned with the plight of women home workers (usually widows or wives of casual labourers), especially in the tailoring trade in east and south London. She was on the executive committee of the National Anti-Sweating League and one of the organizers of the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> sweated industries exhibition of 1906. Her two books, <span class="italic">Sweated Industry and the Minimum Wage</span> (1907) and <span class="italic">Makers of our Clothes: a Case for Trade Boards</span> (which she wrote jointly with C. Meyer, 1909) were powerful works of propaganda. The <span class="roman">Trade Boards Act</span> was passed in 1909, but her stand on the legal minimum wage caused a split within the WIC and she resigned, though later returned as its president. Her interest in improving conditions for working women remained, and she edited <span class="italic">Married Women's Work</span> (1915), the findings of the WIC's inquiry into the effect of industrial employment on married women. In 1918 she wrote on ways of improving housing and housekeeping so that women could be freed for employment.<br>
<br>A non-militant suffragist, Black inaugurated the suffrage declaration of 1906 which was signed by thousands. Representing the WIC, she was one of twenty-one distinguished women who met the prime minister (Asquith) in 1910 during the campaign for the <span class="roman">Conciliation Bill</span> which, if passed, would have allowed limited women's suffrage. She realized that, without the vote, women had no power to legislate against poor working and social conditions. She became one of the vice-presidents of the London Society for Women's Suffrage in 1913 and was acting editor of the <span class="italic">Common Cause</span>. She was a well-known author in her day, writing fiction, biographies, translations, and even plays for children. One novel, <span class="italic">An Agitator</span> (1894), was described by Eleanor Marx as a realistic account of the British working-class movement, but her other fiction avoided social concerns. A non-revolutionary socialist, she believed in legislative action. A deceptively fragile and refined appearance belied her dedication and untiring industry in the cause of justice for women. Her cheerful disposition, sympathy, and tact made her popular. In recognition of her endeavours on behalf of women, she was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;75 a year in 1913.<br>
<br>Unmarried, Black took her niece Gertrude Speedwell, daughter of her brother Arthur, into her house when Arthur committed suicide after murdering his wife and son  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 Jan 1893), and brought her up herself. Clementina Black died at 22 Westmoreland Road, Barnes, Surrey, on 19 December 1922.<br>
