<span class="headword">Bamford,  Samuel</span>  (1788&#150;1872), <span class="occ">radical</span>, was born in Middleton, Lancashire, on 28 February 1788, one of five children of Daniel Bamford, a dissenting muslin weaver, part-time teacher, and later master of the Salford workhouse, and his wife, Hannah (1755&#150;1795). After private tuition Bamford was sent to the Manchester grammar school, from which he was withdrawn by his father, who refused to let him study Latin. He learned weaving instead, and was then employed as a warehouseman in Manchester. Here he read Homer's <span class="italic">Iliad</span> and Milton's poems, which cultivated a lifelong taste for poetry as shown in his own compositions.<br>
<br>Bamford had an unsettled early adulthood: in 1802 he joined the local militia, but left to return to warehousing; he then became a farm worker near Prestwich, worked on a collier trading between Shields and London, and returned to warehousing before finally settling down as a weaver. He married Jemima Shepherd (1788&#150;1862) at Manchester Cathedral on 24 June 1810; their daughter, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1834), had been baptized in the previous January.<br>
<br>The onset of Luddite unrest prompted Bamford's political consciousness, already given direction by the writings of Robert Burns and William Cobbett. A gifted organizer, Bamford helped found the Hamden Reform Club, Middleton, in 1816, and represented the club at a reform gathering in London that year. Despite his opposition to the Blanketeers, his reformist activities led him to be charged with treason in March 1817, although he was acquitted. He chronicled this in his <span class="italic">Account of the Arrest and Imprisonment of Samuel Bamford</span> (1817).<br>
<br>On 16 August 1819 Bamford led the Middleton contingent to St Peter's Fields, where they witnessed the Peterloo massacre. Bamford was charged later with treason, but although the evidence showed that his own conduct and that of his contingent were peaceful and orderly, he was sentenced to a year in Lincoln gaol for inciting a riot.<br>
<br>Upon his release Bamford returned to weaving, but writing took up an increasing amount of his time. In 1819 he published <span class="italic">The Weaver Boy, or, Miscellaneous Poetry</span>, but to little critical success. However, by 1826 he had discarded weaving to become Manchester correspondent for the <span class="italic">Morning Herald</span>, although he continued to hold a series of other jobs as well. By 1839 Bamford abandoned full-time journalism in order to devote himself to writing the autobiographical works <span class="italic">Passages in the Life of a Radical</span> (1840&#150;44), which included his wife's account of Peterloo, and <span class="italic">Early Days</span> (1849), as well as <span class="italic">Homely Rhymes</span> (1843), <span class="italic">Walks in South Lancashire</span> (1844), and <span class="italic">Tawk o'seawth Lankeshur</span> (1850).<br>
<br>In the meantime, Bamford withdrew from the forefront of radical politics: his last radical tract was a poem on the acquittal of Queen Caroline entitled <span class="italic">The Queen's Triumph</span> (1820). Although he continued to support moderate reform, disillusionment&#151;prompted in particular by the increasingly violent rhetoric of Chartism, but also by the petty antagonisms among the radical leadership and their condescension towards the working classes&#151;drove him away. Indeed, he served as a special constable in Middleton during the Chartist agitation there, and became a member of the Anti-Corn Law League.<br>
<br>In 1846 a private subscription was raised to assist Bamford, and in 1851 he moved to London to take up the post of messenger in Somerset House. Here he published his <span class="italic">Life of Amos Ogden</span> (1853) and <span class="italic">The Dialect of South Lancashire</span> (1854). Unhappy with the city of London and his employment, Bamford returned to Manchester in 1858 and attempted to survive on the proceeds from public readings of his poetry. In 1864 a group of Manchester Liberals became aware of his near destitution and raised an annuity, which supported him until his death at Harpurhey, Lancashire, on 13 April 1872. He was buried in the churchyard of St Leonard's, Middleton.<br>
<br>Bamford has been viewed as something of an apostate of radicalism owing to the popularity with which his memoirs were greeted by members of the middle classes, and in the light of his strong opposition to Feargus O'Connor's physical-force Chartism. This has led editors of his writings either to marginalize Bamford's intellectual consistency or to emphasize his increasing irrelevance to Victorian working-class agitation. Recently, however, his role has been reappraised.<br>
<br>Bamford can be seen as the voice of a class-conscious radicalism which was nevertheless compelled to oppose physical-force activism. He believed the 1830s and 1840s had demonstrated the capacity of parliament to reform itself in the face of moral pressure; furthermore, he was haunted by the spectre of the Peterloo massacre and remained convinced that the physical power of the state could always crush radical militancy. It was the confluence of these factors which gave Bamford's later life an appearance of political passivity. However, he remained a strong supporter of continued legal and political reforms, and of a self-disciplined and self-educated working-class movement independent of middle-class machinations. Consequently, his writings continue to be of great use to social historians of nineteenth-century Britain.<br>
