<span class="headword">Shakespear <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Tucker]</span>,  Olivia</span>  (1863&#150;1938), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 17 March 1863 at Southlands, Chale, on the Isle of Wight, the second of the three children of Major-General Henry Tod Tucker CB (1808&#150;1896), who served with the British army in Bengal from 1824 until ill health forced his retirement in 1856, and Harriet Maria (1821&#150;1900), second daughter of Sir Henry Allen Johnson (1775&#150;1860). In 1866 the family moved to Framfield in Sussex, and then to Bayswater in London in 1878. Olivia Tucker was privately educated at home; like her cousin Lionel Johnson (1867&#150;1902) she read voraciously from an early age. On 8 December 1885 she married Henry Hope Shakespear (1849&#150;1923), a solicitor from a family with a long history of civil and military service in India. They lived first at 18 Porchester Square, Bayswater, where their only child, Dorothy (1886&#150;1973), was born on 14 September 1886.<br>
<br>The marriage, though outwardly tranquil, was not, from Olivia Shakespear's point of view, a happy one. In April 1894, at the inaugural dinner for the <span class="italic">Yellow Book</span>, she first encountered <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37061/', "William Butler Yeats (1865&#150;1939)")</script>; thus began a lifelong relationship which developed, during 1895&#150;6, into a love affair. Olivia Shakespear broke off the affair early in 1897, owing to Yeats's continuing obsession with Maud Gonne (1867&#150;1953), but by 1899 they had resumed contact, and thereafter remained close friends. Olivia Shakespear is a significant presence in Yeats's <span class="italic">The Wind among the Reeds</span> (1899), and her fourth novel, <span class="italic">Rupert Armstrong</span> (1898), a <i>roman-&agrave;-clef</i> about the life of John Millais that attributes his artistic decline to the influence of Effie Ruskin, takes some of its emotional colouring from her affair with Yeats.<br>
<br>Between 1894 and 1909 Olivia Shakespear published six novels, of which the first three, <span class="italic">Love on a Mortal Lease</span> (1894), <span class="italic">The Journey of High Honour</span> (1894), and <span class="italic">The False Laurel</span> (1896), though elegantly written, are conventional &#145;society&#146; novels. With <span class="italic">Rupert Armstrong</span> her work becomes more distinctive; <span class="italic">The Devotees</span> (1904) is a study of a son in thrall to a feckless mother, while <span class="italic">Uncle Hilary</span> (1909) explores the plight of a young woman who unknowingly marries her stepfather and eventually finds peace in a quasi-Buddhist detachment from the world.<br>
<br>Though not personally ambitious&#151;Yeats remarked that she seemed content &#145;to have no more of life than leisure, and the talk of her friends&#146;  (Yeats, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 74)&#151;Olivia Shakespear remained actively involved in London literary circles throughout her life. In 1909 she introduced Yeats to Ezra Pound, who married her daughter, Dorothy, in 1914; in 1911 her brother Henry Tudor Tucker (1868&#150;1943) married Edith Ellen Hyde-Lees (1868&#150;1942), whose daughter Bertha George Hyde-Lees (1892&#150;1968) was later to marry Yeats.<br>
<br>After her husband's death in July 1923, Olivia Shakespear moved to 34 Abingdon Court, Kensington. There she died of a heart attack on 3 October 1938. On hearing the news of her death Yeats wrote: &#145;She was not more lovely than distinguished&#151;no matter what happened she never lost her solitude&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of W. B. Yeats</span>, 916).<br>
