<span class="headword">Willis,  Browne</span>  (1682&#150;1760), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 14 September 1682 at Blandford St Mary, Dorset, the eldest son of Thomas Willis (1658&#150;1699) of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Alice (1663&#150;1700), daughter of Robert Browne of Blandford and his wife, Alice.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyears"></a>Early years</h2>Willis began his education at the school of the Revd Abraham Freestone at Beachampton, Buckinghamshire, from where he went to Westminster School, which he left in 1700 on the death of his mother. In March 1700 he entered Christ Church, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner and later in the same year was admitted as a student to the Inner Temple, leaving Oxford without taking a degree in 1704. Early influences were Edward Wells, the mathematician and divine and his tutor at Oxford, and William Wotton, the theological scholar, under whom he studied for three years after leaving the university.<br>
<br>Through his father Willis inherited Whaddon Hall, where he was to live until his death, together with the adjoining manor and advowson of Bletchley. He also owned the manor of Burlton in Burghill, Herefordshire, and his estate was augmented by the dowry of &pound;7000 obtained through his marriage in 1707 to Katharine (1690&#150;1724), only child and heir of Daniel Eliot (<i>d</i>. 1702) of Port Eliot, Cornwall, and his wife, Catherine. From 1705 to 1708 Willis served as tory MP for Buckingham, for which he was returned by the casting vote of a man brought from prison for the purpose, but by that time he had already decided to devote his life to antiquarian interests, probably first awakened by his boyhood visits to Westminster Abbey.<h2>
<a name="Willistheantiquary"></a>Willis the antiquary</h2>Willis's energies and range as an antiquarian writer were prodigious. Along with his contemporary John Le Neve, of whose work he was often critical, Willis was one of the first antiquaries to base his work on original documents; he was, however, frequently slapdash and inaccurate in his attention to detail. He travelled extensively, visiting every cathedral in England and Wales save Carlisle. This interest in cathedrals and great churches is reflected in his published works, the principal of which are his accounts of the Welsh cathedrals of St David's, Llandaff, St Asaph, and Bangor, printed between 1717 and 1721 (the first two at least partly the work of William Wotton), the two-volume <span class="italic">History of the Mitred Parliamentary Abbies and Conventual Cathedral Churches</span> (1718&#150;19) and <span class="italic">A survey of the cathedrals of York, Durham, Carlisle, Chester, Man, Lichfield, Hereford, Worcester, Gloucester, and Bristol</span> (also in two volumes) of 1727, supplemented by a further volume covering Lincoln, Ely, Oxford, and Peterborough in 1730. The unsold copies of this work were purchased by the London bookseller Thomas Osborne in 1742 and mischievously reissued as a new edition containing histories of all the cathedrals, an action roundly condemned by Willis.<br>
<br>Willis's approach to cathedrals was innovative. Others such as John Weever and Sir William Dugdale had written accounts of the country's great churches, particularly their funerary monuments (also a prominent feature of Willis's work), but his devotion to medieval architecture at a time when most scholars were interested only in Greek or Roman architecture was unusual. Willis frequently commented on the condition of the cathedrals he visited: thus of Peterborough he writes:<blockquote>I cannot but say that it is ill kept in Repair, and lies very slovenly in the inside, and several windows are stopped up with Bricks, and the glazing in others sadly broken; and the Boards of the Roof of the middle Isle or nave, which with the Cross-Isle is not archt with stone but wainscotted with painted boards [in fact, these ceilings are medieval] &hellip; several of them damaged and broken &hellip; that scarce any Cathedral in England is any more neglected. (Willis, <span class="italic">A Survey of the Cathedrals</span>, 3.504)</blockquote>With Worcester he is much happier, relating that:<blockquote>The whole Fabrick is &hellip; in excellent Repair, several Thousands of Pounds having been expended of late Years by the Chapter, who are yet generously going on in new casing the outward Walls, which being built of a soft reddish Stone [he notes perceptively] have mouldred. (ibid., 2.628)</blockquote>The value of Willis's written accounts is increased by the plans and copperplate-engravings of the cathedrals, virtually all of them by the topographical and architectural artist John Harris, among them some of the earlier accurate views of these buildings.<br>
<br>In these comments on the condition of the cathedrals he visited Browne Willis demonstrates an interest which is not only antiquarian but appears also to express a concern for the proper care and future preservation of these great monuments. To promote this he was active in the revival of the Society of Antiquaries, of which he was a founder member in July 1717, regularly attending meetings and involving himself in its affairs; he was also a member of the Spalding Society. He was awarded the degree of master of arts at Oxford in August 1720 and a doctorate of civil law by the same university in April 1749.<br>
<br>Willis's legal background is reflected in his <span class="italic">Notitia parliamentaria, or, An history of the counties, cities, and boroughs in England and Wales</span> (3 vols., 1715, 1716, and 1750, the first volume reprinted with additions in 1730), while his almost compulsive desire to record the names and dates of ecclesiastical office-holders and the valuation of benefices is revealed by his two editions of John Ecton's <span class="italic">Thesaurus rerum ecclesiasticarum</span> (1754, 1763). Willis communicated frequently with other major antiquaries of his day, including William Cole, Andrew Ducarel, Samuel Gale, Thomas Hearne, John Hutchins, Francis Peck, Thomas Tanner, William Thomas, and Francis Wise, making important contributions to several of their published works. Indeed, Willis himself claimed to have persuaded Hutchins to undertake his history of Dorset in 1736 and to have drawn up queries for him to use in its preparation. Between 1713 and 1720 he also corresponded regularly with Dr Arthur Charlett, master of University College, Oxford (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ballard 18).<br>
<br>Willis's most intensive antiquarian research was on his family's native Buckinghamshire. He first issued queries for information on the county in 1712, and amassed considerable material, much of it drawn from original sources, on its history, principal buildings, and the genealogy and coats of arms of its leading families. Some of this eventually appeared in <span class="italic">The History and Antiquities of the Town, Hundred, and Deanery of Buckingham</span> (1755), which like much of his published work was poorly received and displayed his lack of skill at narrative writing, but more was gathered together by William Cole in ten manuscript folio volumes for &#145;The history of the hundreds of Newport and Cotslow&#146; (BL, Add. MSS 5839, 5840). Yet more, however, remained in note form and, along with similar material on other counties, either formed the collection of manuscripts Willis donated to the Bodleian Library on his death (Bodl. Oxf., MS Willis 1&#150;110) or remained with Cole, after whose death they were deposited in the British Museum. These manuscripts provide a wealth of information on ecclesiastical and other buildings now demolished or altered, and again display Willis's keen attention to architectural detail and eagerness to record buildings from personal observation. Of the former Benedictine nunnery of St Margaret's, Nettleden, in Buckinghamshire, for instance, of which he was originally informed nothing remained above ground, he writes:<blockquote>I visited this place; the House seems almost entirely standing, tho it was always small; the parlour and Hall not bad buildings being of Tatenhall (Totternhoe) stone well wrought, behind them stood the church I saw the square of the Tower it was 10 foot high in memory of man. (Bodl. Oxf., MS Willis 34, fol. 40b)</blockquote>Willis's writings on non-antiquarian subjects, such as the anonymous <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man, Abridged for the Benefit of the Poorer Sort</span> (1717) and <span class="italic">To the Patrons of Ecclesiastical Livings</span> (1752), reflect his other gentlemanly interests, and he also published works on coins and tradesmen's tokens, of which he was an avid collector and cataloguer, donating large numbers to Oxford University, both between 1739 and 1750 and on his death.<h2>
<a name="Willisasarchitecturalpatronandchurchbuilder"></a>Willis as architectural patron and church builder</h2>Willis was a notable patron of architecture. Inheriting his father's portion of Whaddon Hall on coming of age in 1703, he immediately embarked on its rebuilding. Further work followed in 1710 when he bought out the co-owner, James Selby, much of the material for this phase of construction apparently coming from the recently built dissenting meeting-house at nearby Fenny Stratford, which Willis had bought and then demolished in order to prevent dissenters from congregating there. He also spent &pound;5000 on the construction of Water Hall in 1711, a large house next to Bletchley church, in which he never lived. As with his antiquarian research, however, Willis's chief architectural interest was ecclesiastical and he enthusiastically raised funds for work to several churches in the area close to his home. His first involvement was in rebuilding the damaged chancel at Little Brickhill in 1703, while in 1704&#150;9 he restored St Mary's, Bletchley, of which he was patron. The work at Bletchley was carried out as a memorial to his parents but characteristically, rather than lavishing money on &#145;Marble statues or fine Embellishments, whilst the other part of God's house in which they lay wanted both a Requisite Decency and convenience for His Worship&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Willis 2, fol. 99), he repaired the church instead, and his mother and father are directly commemorated only by two simple slabs in the chancel floor.<br>
<br>It was, however, the complete rebuilding of St Martin's Church, Fenny Stratford, between 1724 and 1730 in memory of his grandfather, the physician Thomas Willis, which gave Willis his &#145;chiefest and most real worldly comfort and happiness&#146;  (will, fol. 223<i>v</i>). Here his love of architecture combined with his patronage of the church in a forthright rejection of nonconformity which, as a high Anglican, he despised. Not surprisingly, the architect-builder Edward Wing (replaced by John Simmonds in 1728) was instructed to use the Gothic style, an early example of its type, albeit of a kind that owed more to the medieval past than the playful &#145;gothick&#146; which was beginning to appear elsewhere at this time.<br>
<br>At Stony Stratford after a disastrous fire in 1742, where he raised funds for the relief of the townspeople, Willis ensured that &pound;30 was spent on repairing the tower of St Mary Magdalene's Church; this prevented its demolition along with the remains of the rest of the building. Even in the impoverished last decade of his life he contributed &pound;200 in 1752 for repairs to Buckingham church, and in 1756&#150;7 he restored the long-disused church at Bow Brickhill.<br>
<br>Willis was always keen to protect the rights of the ancient county town, Buckingham, against those of the rapidly expanding Aylesbury, and was disappointed by the townspeople's failure to rebuild on a grander scale after a major fire in 1725. Unsuccessful in his efforts to replace the church spire (the old one had collapsed in 1699), he did, however, succeed in re-establishing the summer assizes in the town, and helped to get the mock-castellated gaol erected in 1748. He also revived the market at Fenny Stratford in 1702.<h2>
<a name="Personalityandfamilylife"></a>Personality and family life</h2>Willis was an eccentric, both in appearance and behaviour. This frequently attracted comment, sometimes humorously satirical, occasionally hostile, not only from his fellow antiquaries but from those who met him socially. Many such were as bemused by his clothing as by his antiquarian predilections: in a letter to a friend in 1739 Catherine Talbot, the social correspondent and author, described him as &#145;the dirtiest creature in the world &hellip; his great coat has been transmitted down, I believe, from generation to generation ever since Noah&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 6.204), and in 1781 Cole recalled that by the 1750s when he first met him his patron had<blockquote>more the appearance of a mumping beggar than a gentleman &hellip; dressed in an old slouched hat, more brown than black, a weather-beaten large wig, three or four old-fashioned coats, all tied round by a leather belt, and over all an old blue cloak, lined with black fustian, which he told me he had new made when he was elected member for the town of Buckingham about 1707. (ibid., 208)</blockquote>Despite his strange appearance, unworldliness, bouts of depression, and lapses into self-pity (he frequently chided his antiquarian colleagues for not visiting him more often at Whaddon), Willis was also noted for his tremendous energy, general good humour, modesty, and kindness. Catherine Talbot, putting aside her dismay at his peculiar clothing, readily acknowledged that he had &#145;one of the honestest hearts in the world&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 6.204), while even the formality of the eulogium read by Ducarel to the Society of Antiquaries shortly after Willis's death (itself a most unusual step for the fellows to take) fails to conceal the affection in which he was generally held: &#145;blessed with a most excellent memory &hellip; in his friendships none more sincere and hearty; always communicative, and ever ready to assist every studious and inquisitive person&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 5830, fol. 202).<br>
<br>Perhaps inevitably, Willis's relations with his peers were not always so cordial during his lifetime. Contact with Cole, whom he appointed rector of Bletchley in 1753, was frequently strained and his friendship with Hearne was tested not only by the latter's criticism of his work&#151;Hearne called <span class="italic">Mitred Parliamentary Abbies</span> &#145;a most strange rhapsody and nothing tolerable in it, only what he hath taken from Leland, which, however, he hath strangely mangled and spoiled&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 7.9), a form of hostility which Willis was more than capable of returning&#151;but by personal jealousy. This may have been brought about by Hearne's visit to Whaddon in May 1716, an event which he referred to as one of the &#145;happy occurrences of my life&#146;  (ibid., 5.217), his pleasure apparently stemming largely from a letter&#151;&#145;amongst the choicest Writings that I have&#146;  (ibid.)&#151;which he received from Willis's wife while there (Willis himself was away) and declined to destroy despite the separate entreaties of both Willis and Katharine.<br>
<br>Willis's own relationship with his wife is difficult to determine; she is scarcely referred to in his letters and there is no eulogy on her memorial at Bletchley, but there is none on that to his parents, and as his own monument at Fenny Stratford is equally plain it would be unwise to read anything into this. It is unlikely, however, that his continual ridicule of the two theological pamphlets she wrote&#151;&#145;A letter from a gentlewoman in the country to the lord bishop of Bangor&#146; (1717?), written in response to Benjamin Hoadly's controversial sermon &#145;The nature of the kingdom, or Church of Christ&#146; (1717), and &#145;The established Church of England, the true Catholic church&#146; (1718)&#151;improved their relationship. Of his five sons and five daughters only the twin daughters, Gertrude and Katherine, survived him; all, it seems, despite the generosity of the sums bestowed on his married children, disapproved of his squandering the family's wealth on antiquarian research and church building projects. Relations with his sons were particularly poor, and having &#145;testified their dislike and aversion to the study which hath been my chief delight and amusement&#146;  (will, fol. 225<i>v</i>), he left all his printed books and pictures to his elder grandson, Thomas. After several months' illness Willis died on 5 February 1760 at Whaddon Hall, according to the curate and his friend John Gibberd &#145;with great ease and without the usual agonies of death&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 15935, fols. 177&#150;82), and was buried beneath the altar of St Martin's, Fenny Stratford, six days later.<br>
<br>Willis was one of the major antiquarian scholars of his day but like others of his generation it was not only interest in the medieval past that spurred him on. As high in his churchmanship as in his toryism, he was interested above all in using his studies to restore the glories of the Church of England, of which he was a devoted member and keen proponent of clerical celibacy. He was driven also by a strong sense of local patriotism, his efforts in church building and resurrecting the privileges of Buckingham always being underpinned by his antiquarian research and love of his neighbourhood.<br>
