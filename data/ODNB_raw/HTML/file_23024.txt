<span class="headword">Raine,  Matthew</span>  (1760&#150;1811), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born on 20 May 1760 at Gilling in the North Riding of Yorkshire. His father, of the same name, was for many years vicar of St John's, Stanwick, and rector of Kirkby Wiske, and also master of a school at Hartforth, near Richmond, in the same county. His mother, Esther (<i>d</i>. 1803), was of a Cumberland family. After receiving the elements of education under his father, with William Beloe for a schoolfellow, he was admitted a scholar of the Charterhouse, on the king's nomination&#151;obtained, it is said  (Beloe, 1.10), through the interest of Lord Percy, a patron of his father&#151;in June 1772. In 1778 he went up as an exhibitioner to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a scholar in 1779 and graduated as sixteenth wrangler in 1782 (MA 1785, BD 1794, DD 1799). In 1783 and 1784 he gained the members' university prize, and in the latter year was made fellow of his college. He was ordained deacon in 1782 and priest in 1784, and served as curate of Melford, Suffolk.<br>
<br>After some time spent in tuition at Cambridge, Raine was appointed headmaster of Charterhouse School on 7 June 1791, in succession to Samuel Berdmore. Charles Burney was one of his competitors. Here he remained until his death. The school enjoyed a high reputation, pupil numbers rose, and a new schoolroom was added in 1802. Raine was credited with the reform of providing a single bed for each scholar. In 1803 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1809 was chosen preacher of Gray's Inn. In July 1810 he was presented by the governors of the Charterhouse to the rectory of Hallingbury, Essex, in anticipation of his retirement.<br>
<br>Raine died, unmarried, at Charterhouse Square, London, on 17 September 1811. He was buried in the chapel of the Charterhouse, where a gravestone was placed in the south aisle inscribed M. R., and a mural tablet on the adjoining wall by Flaxman, with an epitaph by Samuel Parr. Parr and Richard Porson were his close friends. His choice collection of classical books, including many <span class="roman">Aldines</span> and rare editions, went by bequest, after the death of his brother Jonathan (1763&#150;1831), to the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. This brother, a schoolfellow of Porson's at Eton, and afterwards at Trinity (BA 1787, MA 1790), was a barrister and a member of parliament from 1802 to 1807 and again from 1812 to 1831.<br>
<br>Raine was described as eloquent in the pulpit and dignified in manner. The latter part of this description is borne out by his portrait, reputed to be by Hoppner, in the master's lodge at the Charterhouse. The Society of Schoolmasters owed much to his generosity. His only published works were two sermons.<br>
