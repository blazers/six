<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boyd,  Robert</span>, fifth Lord Boyd  (<em>c.</em>1517&#150;1590), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of Robert, fourth Lord Boyd (<i>d</i>. 1558), and Helen, daughter of Sir John Somerville of Cambusnethan. In 1535 he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1601), daughter of Sir John Colquhoun of Glins, with whom he had two sons, Thomas and Robert, and six daughters, Margaret, Helen, Egidia, Agnes, Christine, and Elizabeth. He succeeded to his father's title in 1558.<br>
<br>The power base of the Boyd family was in Ayrshire, which had a reputation for religious dissidence stretching back to the time of the Lollards of Kyle in James IV's reign. Consequently it is not surprising that Robert Boyd, like some of the other leading Ayrshire landowners, notably the earl of Glencairn and Lord Ochiltree, should have played a prominent role in the events surrounding the Reformation in 1559&#150;60, at both a local and a national level. At Easter 1559 Boyd was nominated one of the lords of the congregation who would protect the protestant reformer John Willock while he engaged in theological debate with Quintin Kennedy, abbot of Crossraguel. The contest was scheduled to take place at St John's Kirk, Ayr, but Kennedy ultimately decided not to participate. Then in the summer of 1559, as the protestant revolution gathered force, Boyd joined Knox and his followers at Perth, and when it became apparent in July that victory was impossible without outside assistance he was among the signatories of a letter appealing to Queen Elizabeth for English support. On 4 November Henry Balnaves, a leading reformer, reported paying 500 crowns to Glencairn and Boyd, thereby helping to keep them loyal to the protestant cause. In February 1560 Boyd was one of the commissioners appointed to negotiate the treaty of Berwick, which guaranteed English military and naval aid against the French forces of the regent, Mary of Guise. Having witnessed the defeat of the latter in the summer of 1560, Boyd attended the convention at Edinburgh in January 1561 at which the <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>, the first blueprint for the kirk, was given parliamentary approval.<br>
<br>Mary's personal reign from 1561 to 1567 created something of a dilemma for Boyd. He obviously had a strong attachment to the queen, yet some of her actions dismayed him. Thus the announcement in the summer of 1565 of her marriage to Lord Darnley, who had been brought up a Roman Catholic, aroused his fears over her religious intentions and caused him to join Moray's faction against the queen. The upshot of this questionable move was Boyd's participation in the so-called chaseabout raid, a futile attempt at rebellion led by Moray in August&#150;September 1565. After assembling initially in Boyd's home territory of Ayrshire, the insurgents briefly occupied Edinburgh at the end of August, but the absence of any substantial support either in Scotland or from England soon caused the revolt to fizzle out.<br>
<br>Summoned to stand trial for his actions, Boyd decided to seek reconciliation with Darnley, and in March 1566 he joined those who, in return for a pardon for their involvement in the chaseabout raid, signed a bond recommending that the queen's consort be given the crown matrimonial. In the event Boyd received his remission from Mary herself, when after Riccio's murder she astutely split her opponents by granting pardons to the previous year's rebels, but not to those who had assassinated her secretary. Then after the murder of Darnley in February 1567 Boyd showed himself in favour of the queen's marrying Bothwell. He was a member of the jury which acquitted the earl of involvement in Darnley's death, and also a signatory of the Ainslie bond supporting his proposed marriage to Mary. On 17 May he was made a privy councillor, and in the following month he was a leader in an (unsuccessful) attempt to hold Edinburgh for the queen.<br>
<br>However, it was after Mary was forced to abdicate (24 July 1567) that Boyd's loyalty to her became particularly conspicuous. It was far from unusual in sixteenth-century Scotland for political allegiance to be at odds with religious affiliation, in whole regions as well as in individuals. Boyd was a native of the protestant south-west, which was nevertheless a powerful bastion of support for the queen. This may have been due in part to the highly successful tour of Ayrshire which Mary made in 1563. Moreover, it is likely that Boyd, like many others, disapproved of Mary's enforced abdication, believing it could only lead to civil war and instability. On 13 May 1568 he fought for Mary at Langside, and in September, following a meeting of her supporters at Dumbarton, he was nominated a commissioner to represent the queen at the forthcoming inquiry into Mary's behaviour which Queen Elizabeth had instigated. Boyd's selection was endorsed by Mary and he joined Bishop John Lesley, Lord Herries, and the others for the proceedings first at York and later at Westminster. Mary seems to have trusted him without reservation, and in a letter to Cecil of 11 February 1569 asked that she could keep him and Lesley permanently with her. In February 1569, with the investigation completed, Boyd was given a safe conduct to return to Scotland, but instead lingered near Tutbury in Staffordshire, where Mary had recently been transferred; he remained in England for much of 1569, acting as a Marian agent and becoming involved in the complex marriage negotiations between Mary and the duke of Norfolk. One of his duties was to deliver, as a token of the duke's affections, a diamond which Mary promised to wear secretly until their wedding took place. Shortly afterwards, in June 1569, he travelled to Scotland and discussed with Regent Moray the possibilities of arranging Mary's divorce from the exiled Bothwell, but he then returned to England once more. Early in 1570 Boyd went back to Scotland and for more than a year was active as one of the &#145;queen's men&#146; in the civil war waged intermittently between 1570 and 1573. None the less, by August 1571 he had recognized the futility of continuing the struggle, and with other Marians submitted to the earl of Lennox's government.<br>
<br>The earl of Morton's appointment as regent in November 1572 marked the beginning of the most important phase in Boyd's career. For almost a decade he held a variety of positions in an administration whose political and religious affinities appealed to his own anglophile and protestant leanings. Having been restored to the privy council by Lennox's government on 7 September 1571, Boyd also became an extraordinary lord of session under Morton, and then, as the state assumed control of the kirk's finances, collector of the thirds of benefices. On 17 November 1572 he visited the deathbed of John Knox. Moreover, he was closely involved in the pacification of Perth, of 23 February 1573, when the Gordon and Hamilton families were reconciled to Morton&#151;Boyd being one of the officials responsible for the execution of the settlement in the southern half of the country. As a reward for his services Boyd received various forfeitures, escheats, and wardships, and in 1575 he was appointed bailie and justiciar of Glasgow, where his nephew James Boyd of Trochrig had become archbishop two years previously. By 1577 Lord Boyd was receiving a yearly pension of 1000 marks from the thirds of the archbishopric and of Paisley Abbey.<br>
<br>Having remained loyal to the regent during the 1578 crisis, when according to one account he even criticized him for yielding too easily to his enemies, Boyd once more became prominent in government after Morton effected his recovery. Thus he served on the commission, holding discussions with the leaders of the kirk regarding the second <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>; he was nominated to be one of the roll of councillors who would be in permanent residence with the king at Stirling; he attended the conference of September 1578 which put the final touches to the reconciliation between Morton and the Argyll&#150;Atholl faction; and in 1579 he was named as one of the royal officials responsible for implementing the government's attack on the Hamiltons.<br>
<br>Morton's overthrow at the end of 1580 signalled the start of a period of fluctuating fortunes for Boyd. In August 1582, undoubtedly unhappy with the policies of the Lennox&#150;Arran government, he joined in the so-called Ruthven raid, the seizure of James VI by ultra-protestants. Less than a year later, however, the raiders were ousted and many of them, including Boyd, were forced to leave the country and seek refuge in England. Only at the end of 1585, when the king assumed personal control of the realm, did Boyd experience better times. Thus in 1586 he was restored to his position as an extraordinary lord of session; and in June of that year he was appointed a border commissioner for negotiations over a proposed Anglo&#150;Scottish alliance. One of his final duties was the supervision of the tax levied to meet the costs of James VI's marriage to Anna of Denmark. Boyd died at Kilmarnock on 3 January 1590, five months before the king and his bride returned to Scotland, and was buried in the Laigh Kirk (Low Church) at Kilmarnock.<br>
<br>For over thirty years Boyd had been a conspicuous figure in Scottish affairs. Initially he was both a staunch Marian and an ultra-protestant with anglophile sympathies. Latterly, once Mary's cause was indisputably lost, his religious and political outlook dictated most of his actions. The policies pursued by Morton during his regency were highly sympathetic to a man of Boyd's views, making the 1570s the most successful period of his long career.<br>
