<span class="headword">Waddell,  Peter Hately</span>  (1817&#150;1891), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister and author</span>, son of James Waddell of Balquhatston, Stirlingshire, and his wife, Alice Hately, was born at Balquhatston House, Slamannan, on 19 May 1817. His father soon afterwards disposed of the property and moved to Glasgow, and Waddell was educated at the high school and the university in Glasgow. He was a probationer for ordination at the time of the Disruption in 1843, and joined those who soon formed the Free Church of Scotland, outlining his thoughts in his <span class="italic">Orthodoxy is not Evangelism</span> (1843) and several other pamphlets published that year. Having been licensed as a preacher, in 1843 he was ordained as minister of Rhynie, Aberdeenshire, and in the following year he moved to Girvan, Ayrshire, to the pastorate of a small Free Church congregation. In 1845, while at Girvan, he married Helen Halcro Wardlaw, second daughter of Walter Wardlaw, a Glasgow merchant and descendant of Ebenezer Erskine, founder of the Secessionist church in Scotland. They had four sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Waddell's attachment to the Free Church was loosened when he found that its members intended to retain in their entirety the rigid doctrinal definitions contained in the Westminster confession of faith. When in 1847 he refused to subscribe to the confession his licence was withdrawn. Waddell then founded an independent chapel at Girvan called the Church of the Future, whose objectives he defined in a pamphlet with the same title (1861). His <span class="italic">Sojourn of a Sceptic in the Land of Darkness and Uncertainty</span> (1847) is a somewhat tedious allegory modelled on <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span>. Many of his congregation left the Free Church and joined him. Waddell remained at Girvan until 1862, when he went to Glasgow and began preaching in the city hall as an independent minister. He soon gathered a large congregation, and in 1870 a church was erected for him in East Howard Street. Financial difficulties led to the abandonment of this building, and Waddell once more gathered a congregation by preaching in the Trades Hall. In 1888, encouraged by friends and adherents, he joined the Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>Waddell was an orator of very exceptional power. In his early years his lectures in London and in Scottish cities had attracted much attention. His skill as a dialectician was displayed in a series of lectures on Renan's <span class="italic">Vie de J&eacute;sus</span> delivered in Glasgow City Hall before large audiences in 1863, and afterwards published. His profound admiration for Robert Burns led to his issuing a new edition of the poems, with an elaborate criticism (2 vols., 1867&#150;9). He presided at the meeting held in Burns's cottage on 25 January 1859 to celebrate the centenary of the poet's birth, and then delivered an impassioned eulogy on Burns. His chief historical work was a volume entitled <span class="italic">Ossian and the Clyde, Fingal in Ireland, Oscar in Iceland, or, Ossian Historical and Authentic</span> (1875), in which he sought to confirm the authenticity of the Ossianic poems by the identification of topographical references that could not have been known to James Macpherson when he edited Ossian in the eighteenth century. His book was an important stimulus to the Celtic revival at the end of the nineteenth century. Waddell also contributed a remarkable series of letters to a Glasgow journal on Ptolemy's map of Egypt, arguing that the discoveries of Speke and Grant had been foreshadowed by the classical geographer. He took a keen interest in educational matters, and was a member of the first two school boards in Glasgow. His most original contribution to literature was a translation of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> of David from the Hebrew into the Scottish language, under the title <span class="italic">The Psalms: frae Hebrew intil Scottis</span> (1871). This work was followed in 1879 by a similar translation of <span class="roman">Isaiah</span>. He also wrote a verse tragedy, <span class="italic">Behold the Man</span> (1872). Between 1882 and 1885 he edited a people's edition of Walter Scott's Waverley novels with notes and an introduction. Advancing years compelled Waddell to retire from the ministry in October 1890, and he then began to make selections from his published works to form a volume. The task was not completed when he died at 9 Ashton Terrace, Dowanhill, Glasgow, on 5 May 1891.<br>
<br>The Waddells' third son, <a name="cosubject_57507"></a><span class="headword">Peter Hately Waddell</span>  (1854&#150;1922), was born at Girvan on 15 June 1854 and was educated at the high school and university in Glasgow, matriculating in 1870 and graduating MA in 1877. He was tutor to the family of Dr Fergus, an oculist in Glasgow, and was licensed by the presbytery of Glasgow in 1878. In 1879 he was called to be minister of Whitekirk and Tyninghame. He married, on 4 July 1882, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1924), daughter of John Watson Laidlay, of Seacliff near Whitekirk, and his wife, Ellen. He was a well-known preacher and something of a humorist. Unusually among the Scottish clergy he was a keen Wagnerian, and in 1894 published <span class="italic">The Parsifal of Richard Wagner at Bayreuth</span>. He also published several works of theology. He died on 22 November 1922 at Whitekirk.<br>
