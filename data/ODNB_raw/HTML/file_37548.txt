<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hillary,  Richard Hope</span>  (1919&#150;1943), <span class="occ">air force officer and author</span>, was born on 20 April 1919 in Sydney, Australia, the only child of Michael Hillary (1886&#150;1976), DSO, OBE, an Australian government official, and his wife, Edwyna Mary Hope (1881&#150;1966). He arrived in England at the age of three, when his father received a London posting. From Shrewsbury School he went in 1937 to Trinity College, Oxford, where he started to read philosophy, politics, and economics and then moved to modern history. He stroked the Trinity boat to head of the river, and as a notably good-looking but somewhat challenging undergraduate enjoyed to the full the leisured life of his college. He also joined the university air squadron, with the motive, he later asserted, not of patriotism but self-realization. The Second World War began before he took his degree.<br>
<br>After enlistment and commissioning in the RAF and completion of his service flying training Hillary was posted on 6 July 1940 to 603 (City of Edinburgh) fighter squadron in Dyce. The battle of Britain was beginning, and on 10 August no. 603 was ordered south to Hornchurch. Hillary's valiant combat career lasted three weeks, during which he was credited with five enemy aircraft. On 3 September 1940, over the North Sea, he was himself shot down. He fell from his Spitfire, but was sustained in the water by his buoyancy jacket and parachute. Horribly burned about the face and hands, he was rescued after three hours by the Margate lifeboat. There followed months in hospital and repeated operations, mostly by Archibald McIndoe. His face was miraculously mended&#151;he was given new upper eyelids and a new upper lip&#151;but he was left with very wasted and weakened hands.<br>
<br>During 1941 Hillary persuaded the Air Ministry to send him to the United States on a speaking tour. But when he arrived there the British embassy expressed fears that his scarred features would only reinforce anti-involvement sentiments among American parents. His talks were confined to broadcasts, where he could not be seen. In America, Hillary met many prominent people and enjoyed the affection of the film star Merle Oberon. He also finished a book and secured its publication there (in February 1942) under the title <span class="italic">Falling through Space</span>.<br>
<br>The book was retitled <span class="italic">The Last Enemy</span> and published in England the following June. It begins with a vivid account of Hillary's final flight. The narrative switches back to Oxford and the RAF, and then forward again to his hospital and surgical experiences. But it is concerned less with the facts of his life than with his feelings and motivation. The self-analysis is sustained and unflattering. Hillary presents himself as an individualist, who only later and almost reluctantly becomes aware of the wider aspects of the war as a battle for civilization and humanity. The success of <span class="italic">The Last Enemy</span> was immediate. The author was acclaimed not only as a born writer but also as a representative of the doomed youth of his generation, although in his constant self-analysis he was in fact a most untypical British fighter pilot of 1940.<br>
<br>After returning from the United States in October 1941 Hillary had gone through Staff College and thence to the headquarters of Fighter Command. But he became obsessed with a desire to return to operations&#151;as he saw it, to keep faith with his dead comrades. After repeated pleas he secured a medical board to consider his case. Surprisingly, it passed him fit for operations. On 24 November 1942 Hillary joined 54 operational training unit at Charter Hall in Berwickshire for training as a night fighter pilot. On 8 January 1943, in a night of poor weather, he was circling a beacon on an exercise when his Blenheim lost height and crashed nearby, at Crunklaw Farm, Edrom, killing both Hillary and his radio operator. The subsequent inquiry, unable to determine a specific cause for the accident, concluded that the pilot had lost control of his aircraft. Later a Richard Hillary Trust was instituted and a Hillary archive was accumulated at Trinity College, Oxford.<br>
<br>After Hillary's death a considerable literature developed. Arthur Koestler, Eric Linklater, and John Middleton Murry all wrote about him, the last-named falsely hypothesizing a death wish and suicide. Lovat Dickson, his publisher, wrote a biography. Much later, in 1988, Michael Burn, in <span class="italic">Mary and Richard</span>, published a selection of the love letters which had passed in 1942 between Hillary and Mary Booker, an understanding and beautiful woman twenty-two years Hillary's senior, whom Burn later married. A fully detailed biography by David Ross appeared in 2000. Hillary's own letters, remorselessly self-analytical as ever, confirm the writing talent of this brave, charming, self-assertive, mocking, and rather uncomfortable young man.<br>
