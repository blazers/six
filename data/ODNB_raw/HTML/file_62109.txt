<span class="headword">Padmore, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1909&#150;1996), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 23 April 1909 at 193 Shirebrook Road, Sheffield, the elder son of Thomas William Padmore, steel merchant, and his wife, Emily, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Handley. Educated at the central secondary school, Sheffield, he won a scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1928, graduating with first-class honours in French and German. After entering the civil service in the Inland Revenue in 1931 he was transferred to the Treasury in 1934 as having potential for high office. In the same year, on 22 December, he married Alice (<i>d</i>. 1963), daughter of Robert Alcock, of Ormskirk, Lancashire. They had three children&#151;a son, John (<i>b</i>. 1937), and two daughters, Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1939) and Katherine (<i>b</i>. 1944).<br>
<br>In the Treasury, Padmore's advancement was rapid; an able administrator, and a powerful advocate in both speech and writing (though on his own admission less of an originator of policies), he was principal private secretary to the chancellor of the exchequer, Sir John Anderson, from 1943 to 1945. Very much the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Sir Edward Bridges, then permanent secretary to the Treasury and head of the home civil service, Padmore was selected to succeed Sir Norman Brook as cabinet secretary when the latter moved to the Treasury on Bridges' expected retirement in 1952. But the change of government after the October 1951 general election led to the new prime minister, Winston Churchill, countermanding these moves, and Padmore (who had already moved to the Cabinet Office as deputy cabinet secretary) returned to the Treasury. He took this major check to his career philosophically, and was promoted second secretary (equal in rank to permanent secretary in other departments) in 1952. In 1953 he was made a KCB. Until 1962 he was for the most part in charge of personnel and management matters for the civil service. Though he was considered for the top posts of permanent secretary to the Treasury and head of the civil service, in the event these went elsewhere. During this period the death of his son in 1956 at the age of eighteen from a long-drawn-out cancer was a great grief to him and his wife.<br>
<br>In 1962 Padmore went to the Ministry of Transport as permanent secretary, doubtless glad to have his own department after ten years as no. 2 at the Treasury. The ministry had been substantially changed in the previous three years under Sir James Dunnett; the main lines of the motorway programme had been set in hand, and new policies for inland transport, particularly the railways, had also been developed and were the subject of legislation just enacted. While this had certainly raised the profile of the ministry it had created a good deal of turmoil among the senior staff, some of whose hopes had been set back in the new conditions. Padmore, with his long experience in staffing matters in the civil service, made it a main objective to try to assuage this; and he was the more able to devote himself to this as the principal lines of policy had already been laid down. This period of his career was beset by another personal loss in the death of his first wife, like their son from a lingering cancer, on 30 September 1963. On 1 May 1964 he married Rosalind Culhane (<i>d</i>. 1995), a former colleague as chief welfare adviser at the Treasury, and for some years a close friend.<br>
<br>The advent of the Labour government in 1964, with its not thoroughly worked out aspirations for co-ordination of the country's transport system, required a firm policy input from the top. Unfortunately Tom Fraser, the first minister of transport in Wilson's government, was a somewhat weak minister, unable to give the necessary lead. It is certainly a criticism of Padmore's leadership that he did not organize in the department the development of policies in line with the new government's aspirations, so as to allow the minister to put before his colleagues proposals with some prospect of cabinet approval. It was no surprise that in the first government reshuffle Fraser was replaced as minister by the much more dynamic Barbara Castle; and it is clear that, from the outset, she intended to replace Padmore as permanent secretary. There is contradictory evidence as to whether this was because he was thought to have opposed the government's co-ordination objectives, or because he was thought to have been more in favour of the motorway programme than of the development of public transport&#151;neither of which opinions was well-founded&#151;or because he was thought to have run out of steam, which might have had some justification. The minister's intention to dispose of Padmore was leaked to the press. His reaction was instant&#151;he told her he would fight to stay, believing that it was hardly proper for ministers to try to change their permanent secretary in such a manner when they came into a department. Stay he did (though other posts were mooted for him they came to nothing) until after Castle had herself left the department, when he retired some months before he was due to go. It is fair to say, however, that in the last three years of his career in the Ministry of Transport he played a distinctly muted role as a formulator of policy.<br>
<br>Padmore had been promoted GCB in 1965. In retirement he took a number of directorships; he also continued his long-standing interest in music as chairman of the Handel Opera Society from 1963 until 1986. His second wife died on 4 March 1995; he himself died at his home, 39 Cholmeley Crescent, Highgate, London, on 8 February 1996. He was survived by the two daughters of his first marriage.<br>
