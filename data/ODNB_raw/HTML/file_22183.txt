<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Philpott,  Henry</span>  (1807&#150;1892), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester</span>, was the son of Richard Philpott and his wife, Jane Gertrude <i>n&eacute;e</i> Price, of Chichester, where he was born on 17 November 1807. He was educated at the cathedral school in that town, and at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1825. His university career was distinguished. In 1829 he was senior wrangler and fourteenth classic, Lord Cavendish (afterwards duke of Devonshire) being second wrangler; and in 1830 he gained the second Smith's prize, Cavendish being placed above him. He was admitted BA and elected fellow of his college in 1829, proceeding MA in 1832. He filled various university offices, acting as proctor in 1834&#150;5, and as moderator and as examiner in the tripos five times between 1833 and 1838. He became, successively, assistant tutor and tutor to his college. Dr Blomfield, bishop of London, appointed him Whitehall preacher for 1837&#150;9; and in 1844 Dr Turton, bishop of Ely, made him his examining chaplain. In 1839 he was admitted BD, and in November 1845 was elected master of St Catharine's; annexed to this post was a canonry at Norwich. On 29 April 1846 he married Mary Jane Doria (1814&#150;1904), eldest daughter of Niccol&ograve; Doria, marchese di Spineto, who taught Italian art at Cambridge. They had no children.<br>
<br>As head of the college, Philpott proved singularly successful, and took a prominent part in the life of the university. He was elected vice-chancellor for the year commencing 4 November 1846, and in that capacity received the queen and Prince Albert, when the prince was installed as chancellor in 1847. From this time Philpott was in close touch with the court. He proceeded to the degree of DD by royal letters patent in 1847, and was appointed chaplain and university correspondent to the new chancellor. His business capacity proved useful in enabling the university in 1856 to arrange a compromise with the town in regard to long-standing disputes as to their respective jurisdictions, and in assisting to reorganize the university itself after the changes made by the new statutes of 1854&#150;5, into the creation of which he had put invaluable work. The general appreciation of his services was shown in his re-election to the vice-chancellorship in 1856, and again in 1857; no vice-chancellor of modern times had held the office in consecutive years.<br>
<br>In 1860 Philpott was nominated to the bishopric of Worcester. His episcopal career was uneventful. Although he faithfully fulfilled the duties of his office, he disliked public life and lived in a simple manner, his not inconsiderable wealth being spent for and in the diocese. He seldom attended the House of Lords; he never attended the upper house of convocation, and is said to have only once appeared at the private meetings of the bishops. He refused to allow diocesan conferences because, as he said, he had &#145;a horror of irresponsible talk&#146;. He had few disciplinary cases with which to deal, but in them showed firmness and moderation. The case of the Revd R. W. Enraght, the ritualistic vicar of Holy Trinity, Birmingham, in 1879, was almost the only one in which he felt compelled to press for the full application of the law. He published ten triennial charges during his episcopate.<br>
<br>Philpott's long university experience led to his being nominated as vice-chairman of the Cambridge University commission of 1877, and he became its chairman in 1878, on the retirement of Lord Chief Justice Cockburn. He had practically &#145;the whole question of University government in his hands. He was wonderfully clear. A few words from him, in his delightfully judicial manner, made any complicated point simple&#146;, recalled one of the secretaries  (Browne, 162). He sympathized with the minority of the commissioners in not wishing to press too hardly upon the colleges.<br>
<br>While bishop, Philpott acted as provincial chaplain of Canterbury, and was also clerk of the queen's closet. In 1887 he was elected honorary fellow of St Catharine's College. In his later years he took great interest in the movement towards establishing a bishopric of Birmingham, and offered to allot &pound;800 a year from his own revenues to that purpose. Increasing age and his wife's ill health compelled him to resign in August 1890, before the arrangements could be completed. He retired to Cambridge, where he died on 10 January 1892 at The Elms. He was buried at St Mary's Church, Hartlebury, Worcestershire, on the 15th. To a twentieth-century historian of his college Philpott seemed &#145;perhaps the greatest man St Catharine's has produced&#146;  (Jones, 190).<br>
