<span class="headword">Winter, Sir  James Spearman</span>  (1845&#150;1911), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Newfoundland</span>, born at Lamaline, Newfoundland, on 1 January 1845, was the son of James Winter, of the customs service at St John's, Newfoundland. Educated at St John's at the General Protestant and Church of England academies, he went in 1859 into a merchant's office, where he remained until in 1861 he was articled to Hugh Hoyles, afterwards chief justice of Newfoundland. He was enrolled a solicitor in 1866, was called to the bar in 1867, became QC in 1880, and at his death was the senior member of the Newfoundland bar and president of the Newfoundland Law Society.<br>
<br>Winter entered the legislature as member for the Burin district in 1874. In 1877&#150;8 he was speaker of the house of assembly. He was solicitor-general from 1882 to 1885 in Sir William Whiteway's first administration and attorney-general from 1885 to 1889 in the Thorburn administration. In 1893 he was appointed judge of the supreme court of Newfoundland, but resigned in 1896, returned to politics as leader of the opposition, and in 1897 became premier of Newfoundland. He held the premiership, combining it with the post of attorney-general and later that of minister of justice, until 1900. Winter's government in 1898 agreed a contract with Sir Robert Gillespie Reid, giving Reid unprecedented rights and privileges over Newfoundland's rail network, docks, and vast tracts of land and their associated mineral resources. Winter's government felt forced into such an agreement by the huge scale of the public debt in Newfoundland, but it was hotly contested and led to his fall from power and the replacement of his government by a Liberal administration, which substantially revised the Reid contract in 1901.<br>
<br>Winter represented Newfoundland at the fisheries conference at Washington in 1887&#150;8, and, although the United States failed to ratify the treaty, for his services he was made a KCMG. In 1890 he went to London as one of the unofficial representatives of the Patriotic Association in connection with the French fishery question, and that year published <span class="italic">French Treaty Rights in Newfoundland</span> on the subject; in 1898, when premier, he visited London again on the same errand, and in the same year represented Newfoundland at the Anglo-American conference at Quebec. In 1910 he was one of the counsel on the British side before The Hague tribunal on the occasion of the north Atlantic fisheries arbitration between Great Britain and the United States.<br>
<br>Winter married in 1881 Emily Julia, the daughter of Captain William J. Coen, governor of the Newfoundland penitentiary. She died in 1908, leaving four sons and four daughters. Winter died at Toronto, while on a visit to a married daughter, at midnight on 6&#150;7 October 1911.<br>
