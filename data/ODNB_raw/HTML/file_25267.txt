<span class="headword">Shaw,  Samuel</span>  (1634/5&#150;1696), <span class="occ">clergyman</span>, was born at Repton, Derbyshire, the son of Thomas Shaw, blacksmith. Educated at Repton School, he was admitted as a sizar, aged fifteen, to St John's College, Cambridge, on 23 December 1650. After graduating BA in 1656 he became master of the grammar school at Tamworth, Staffordshire; there he assisted the puritan vicar, Thomas Blake, at whose funeral he delivered an oration that was printed in Blake's posthumous <span class="italic">Vindiciae foederis</span> (1658). In January 1658 Shaw was ordained by the Wirksworth (Derbyshire) classis, having been invited the previous August to the curacy of Moseley, Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, by Richard Grevis. There he worked closely with Thomas Hall, the presbyterian curate of King's Norton. Through the influence of Captain Gervas Pigot of Thrumpton, Nottinghamshire, he received the protector's presentation to the sequestered rectory of Long Whatton, Leicestershire, of which he took possession on 5 June 1658. But, though the crown confirmed Shaw's title in September 1660, the opposition of Sir John Pretyman, MP for Leicester, forced his removal the following year, and he retired to Cotes, near Loughborough, Leicestershire. About this time he married Jane, daughter of Ferdinando Poole, the ejected vicar of Thrumpton.<br>
<br>In 1665 relatives from London carried the plague to Shaw's house. He lost &#145;two tender babes&#146; and a sister during three months' confinement. The &#145;senseless aspersions&#146; of Shaw's neighbours, some of whom blamed him for introducing the plague into their community, compounded his grief  (Shaw, <span class="italic">Voice of One Crying</span>, foreword). Yet his experience of God's love in the midst of these afflictions inspired him to write the two books for which he is best known&#151;<span class="italic">The Voice of one Crying in a Wilderness</span> (1666) and <span class="italic">Immanuel</span> (1667). Both sought to wean men from their &#145;false notions&#146; of religion. This meant criticizing even his fellow nonconformists, those &#145;pretenders to religion&#146;, who still complain of &#145;persecution, [whose] cry is all for liberty&#146;. Such complaints betrayed a &#145;mere selfish carnal principle&#146;. For Shaw, true religion consisted not in performing duties, reforming worship, or &#145;raging against &hellip; Antichrist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Immanuel</span>, preface), but in God's &#145;changing the hearts, and as it were deifying the souls of men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Immanuel</span>, 18). Frequently reprinted, <span class="italic">Immanuel</span> has remained popular.<br>
<br>At the end of 1666 Shaw left Cotes for Ashby-de-la-Zouch, where in January 1668 he was appointed master of the free school. His reputation for moderation earned him the respect of prominent Anglicans, who were willing to wink at his nonconformity. Thus, in December 1670, Lord Conway persuaded Archbishop Sheldon to grant Shaw a licence to teach without requiring full subscription; Bishop Fuller of Lincoln, &#145;glad to have so worthy a man in his diocese&#146;, did likewise. &#145;Pleasant and facetious&#146;, the new schoolmaster had &#145;great skill &hellip; suiting himself to the temper of boys&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.429&#150;30). During Shaw's tenure Ashby School regained the prestige it had had at the beginning of the century under John Brinsley, and soon attracted scholars from as far away as London, many of whom went on to careers in the established church. Shaw's efforts to revive the school involved him in a long-running quarrel over rents with the feoffees, whom he regarded as &#145;enemies to learning&#146;  (Hunt. L., Hastings MSS, HA 10776). Fortunately he enjoyed the backing of local gentry, including Sir Edward Abney, and the town's clergymen, the godly conformists Alexander Jones and Ithiel Smart the younger.<br>
<br>Of Shaw's lesser-known works, his <span class="italic">A Receipt for the State-Palsie</span> (1660) attributed England's political troubles to the fact that &#145;every man is left to the free choice of &hellip; his own religion&#146;, and called upon magistrates to wield the sword for &#145;the terror of evil doers&#146;  (p. 18). A few months later, however, a more subdued Shaw commended repentance and resignation in a sermon dedicated to the presbyterian MP Sir John Swynfen (<span class="italic">Samuel in Sackcloth</span>, 1660). In addition to a treatise against usury, <span class="italic">The True Christian's Test</span> (1682), much admired by Bishop Thomas Barlow, Shaw published <span class="italic">Adam Abel &hellip; a Discourse &hellip; for Funeral Occasions</span> (1692), and an English translation of <span class="italic">An Apologie for the Ministry</span> (1660) by his friend Thomas Hall. He also published three guides to grammar and two of the comedies he wrote for his students to perform at Christmas time&#151;<span class="italic">Words Made Visible</span> (1679) and <span class="italic">The Different Humours of Men</span> (1692).<br>
<br>Shaw died at Ashby on 22 January 1696, and was buried there two days later on 24 January. His brother-in-law, William Cross, ejected vicar of Beeston, Nottinghamshire, preached his funeral sermon. Shaw was survived by his wife, Jane, two married daughters, Frances Bragg and Jane Warner, and two sons, Samuel and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65310/', "Ferdinando Shaw (bap. 1674, d. 1745)")</script>. The latter published several works as minister of Friar Gate Presbyterian meeting, Derby, from 1699 until his death in 1745.<br>
