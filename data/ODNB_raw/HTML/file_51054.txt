<span class="headword">Grantham, Sir  Guy</span>  (1900&#150;1992), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born on 9 January 1900 at Roman Bank, Skegness, Lincolnshire, the only son of Charles Fred Grantham, landowner and farmer, and his wife, Jane Marian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hildred. He was educated at Rugby School (1914&#150;18) before joining the navy as a special entry cadet at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, in June 1918. He first served as a midshipman in the battleship <i>Monarch</i>, and then as a sub-lieutenant in the royal yacht <i>Victoria and Albert</i> and the cruiser <i>New Zealand</i>, flagship of the admiral of the fleet, Lord Jellicoe. He joined the Submarine Service in 1923, his first boat being the giant <i>M.1</i>, which was armed with a 12 inch gun. He returned to general service in the battle cruiser <i>Hood</i> in 1927, before going to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, in 1931, as river officer in charge of sailing. He returned to submarines in 1933 and commanded <i>L.56</i> and <i>Regent</i>. After early promotion to captain in 1937, he joined the staff of Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, the commander-in-chief Mediterranean, and when Pound became first sea lord in 1939 Grantham went to the Admiralty as his naval assistant. Meanwhile, in 1934 he had married Beryl Marjorie (<i>d</i>. 1991), daughter of T. C. B. Mackintosh-Walker, of Geddes, Nairn, Scotland. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1940 Grantham commissioned the new light cruiser <i>Phoebe</i>, serving in the Home Fleet and then in the Mediterranean, where she took off thousands of soldiers in the evacuation of the army from Greece in April 1941 and then from Crete in May. Grantham was awarded the DSO for <i>Phoebe</i>'s part in the evacuation from Nauplia in Greece on 24 April. In August <i>Phoebe</i> was hit by an aerial torpedo on a run to Tobruk and was so badly damaged she was sent to America for repairs. Grantham was then sent by Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham to be naval liaison officer to his brother, General Sir Alan Cunningham, commanding the Eighth Army, and was mentioned in dispatches for his services in the western desert.<br>
<br>In January 1942 Grantham took command of the light cruiser <i>Naiad</i>, and was flag captain and chief of staff to Rear-Admiral Sir Philip Vian, commanding the 15th cruiser squadron. On 11 March, as <i>Naiad</i> was returning to Alexandria, she was torpedoed off the harbour entrance by <i>U.565</i> and sank in twenty minutes. Grantham had no lifebelt, having been preoccupied with his attempts to save the ship. Vian and Grantham were picked up half an hour later by destroyers, both of them cold and oily, Grantham at the end of his tether and quite exhausted. However, there was no question of survivors' leave. Three days later Vian hoisted his flag in the newly arrived <i>Cleopatra</i>, and took Grantham with him as his flag captain. On 22 March 1942 <i>Cleopatra</i> took part in one of the most celebrated naval actions of the war, known as the second battle of Sirte, when light cruisers and destroyers under Vian defended a convoy to Malta against a much stronger Italian force including heavy cruisers and the battleship <i>Littorio</i>. Not at all abashed by their much larger and heavier gunned opponents, Vian's ships made skilful use of the weather gauge (as in Nelson's day), laying smokescreens, through which they advanced to attack with guns and torpedoes. At the height of the action <i>Cleopatra</i>'s bridge was hit by a 6 inch shell which Grantham saw coming straight for him. It struck the opposite corner of the bridge, where Vian normally stood, but luckily he had just gone to the chart house. Grantham escaped, but one officer and fourteen men were killed. Some ships besides <i>Cleopatra</i> were damaged, but they held the enemy off until nightfall, when the convoy made good its escape. Grantham was appointed CB.<br>
<br>In December 1942 Grantham took command of the carrier <i>Indomitable</i> and went out again to the Mediterranean, to provide air cover for operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily in July 1943. After <i>Indomitable</i> was damaged by an aerial torpedo Grantham transferred to the cruiser <i>Euryalus</i> to serve once again with Vian as his chief of staff for operation Avalanche, the Salerno landing in September, after which Grantham was mentioned in dispatches for the second time. In 1944 Grantham went to the Admiralty as director of plans and attended the conferences at Quebec, Yalta, and Potsdam, on the staff of Cunningham, who had succeeded Pound as first sea lord. He was appointed CBE in 1946.<br>
<br>From 1946 to 1948 Grantham was chief of staff to the commander-in-chief Mediterranean with the rank of commodore. Promoted rear-admiral in July 1947, he was flag officer (submarines) from 1948 to 1950. Early in 1950 he was appointed flag officer (air) and second-in-command Mediterranean Fleet, and promoted vice-admiral. In 1951 he went back to the Admiralty as vice chief of the naval staff. Following the change of government in October 1951 Duncan Sandys was put in charge of defence, and the navy's finances and traditional role came under fierce attack. It fell to Grantham to fight the navy's corner&#151;with only partial success, although probably no one could have done better. He was appointed KCB in 1952, promoted admiral in 1953, and went out to the Mediterranean once more in 1954 to relieve Lord Mountbatten as commander-in-chief Mediterranean and commander-in-chief allied forces Mediterranean. Grantham could have been first sea lord in 1955 but the senior admirals believed that the navy was then battling for its very existence, and the higher-profile Mountbatten was chosen instead. Grantham was appointed GCB in 1956. In July that year President Nasser of Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal. Had Britain and France taken immediate military action, world opinion might have been on their side. But it took time to assemble the necessary forces, the plan of attack was changed, and it was not until October that operation Musketeer, the assault on Port Said, was launched. It was a military success, but a political disaster. In May 1957 Grantham became commander-in-chief Portsmouth, hoisting his flag for the first time on the periscope standard of a submarine at Gosport. The next year, when Mountbatten was due to become chief of the defence staff, Grantham could again have been first sea lord. Again the post went elsewhere&#151;to Admiral Sir Charles Lambe, a friend and confidant of Mountbatten's. Grantham never showed or expressed any disappointment.<br>
<br>Grantham retired in 1959 to become governor of Malta&#151;the first naval officer to hold the office since Sir Alexander Ball in 1800. He arrived in the middle of a political crisis. Dom Mintoff, the Labour prime minister, had just resigned over a British proposal for the island's future. Grantham had to govern in fact as well as in name until 1962 when Borg Olivier's Nationalist Party won the general election. He was principal naval aide-de-camp to the queen from 1958 to 1959; vice-chairman of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission from 1963 to 1970; governor of the Corps of Commissionaires from 1964 to 1992; and a lay canon of Portsmouth Cathedral.<br>
<br>&#145;It is difficult to write, without being fulsome, a description which would do Grantham justice,&#146; Vian wrote in his memoirs. &#145;He is, and always has been, a very perfect knight, without fear and without reproach&#146;  (Vian, 81). Yet Guy Grantham had a remarkably non-heroic, unassuming, somewhat schoolmasterly manner, indeed he was sometimes known as Granny Grantham. One admiral's daughter said of him: &#145;Guy is family. You can see him in his wellington boots calling at the back door on Sunday morning with vegetables he has dug up for lunch&#146;  (private information). He was a fair horseman and was one of the five admirals who rode, with differing degrees of skill, in the coronation procession of 1953. He died of a heart attack at North Lodge, Syston Park, Barkston, Lincolnshire, on 8 September 1992. He was survived by his two daughters; his wife had died in December 1991.<br>
