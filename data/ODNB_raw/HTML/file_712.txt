<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Arundale,  Francis</span>  (1807&#150;1853), <span class="occ">architect and painter</span>, was born at 4 Stanhope Terrace, London, on 9 August 1807, the son of George Arundale. He was an early pupil of Augustus Charles Pugin, with whom he stayed for seven years, accompanying his master to Normandy in 1826. Together with B. Ferrey, G. B. Moore, and T. T. Bury he provided illustrations for Pugin's <span class="italic">Historical and descriptive essays accompanying a series of engraved specimens of the architectural antiquities of Normandy</span> (1828) and also contributed drawings for <span class="italic">Illustrations to the Public Buildings of London</span>, by Pugin and J. Britton (2 vols., 1826&#150;8). He entered the Royal Academy Schools on 22 April 1829, and in July that year travelled via Switzerland to Italy. Studying buildings designed by Palladio, he made detailed architectural drawings of four which he published in <span class="italic">The edifices of Andrea Palladio, forming a selection from his most admired buildings, from drawings and measurements taken at Vicenza</span> (1832), with a dedication to Sir John Soane.<br>
<br>Recommended by J. J. Scoles, Arundale joined the Egyptologist Robert Hay in Egypt in 1832 as a draughtsman and landscape artist, and in the course of Hay's researches after Egyptian antiquities made numerous sketches and drawings, many of which are now in the British Museum. That same year Hay was rejoined by Joseph Bonomi, and while in Upper Egypt Arundale and Bonomi lived for a while in the same tomb, a choice of residence that was later said to have contributed to Arundale's early death from an obscure disease. His frequent journal references to his delicate state of health while abroad, however, suggest that his death was probably due to a pre-existing condition. In letters to his mother and sister, which he illustrated with rapid sketches, Arundale conveyed a vivid impression of the day-to-day life of an early nineteenth-century field expedition to sites of Egyptian antiquity, which at that time were also being visited by the eminent French Egyptologist J. F. Champollion, interpreter of the Rosetta stone. In August 1833 Arundale travelled with Bonomi and Frederic Catherwood, via the Sinai, to Jerusalem, where he stayed for six weeks and where, with Catherwood, he measured the interior of the mosque of Omar: his adoption of local dress and customs possibly contributed towards the required access. His later paintings and watercolours, while accurate in their depiction of views of the city (for example, <span class="italic">Jerusalem: the Via Dolorosa</span>, and <span class="italic">Jerusalem: the Arch of Ecce Homo</span>, both priv. coll.), are also suffused with a quality of light for which the city is famous. In depicting the effect of sunlight on the local pale yellow sandstone Arundale's paintings reveal that, while his training as an architect enabled him accurately to record the construction of buildings, his temperament led him naturally to include in his works more painterly considerations of light and mood. His inclusion, too, of local figures employed in journeyman tasks in a manner similar to Delacroix in his Moroccan sketchbooks of 1832 (particularly in his use of a vibrant red to highlight costume details) is a testament to his fascination with his exotic surroundings. The fluid, sketch-like quality of his figures, compared to the detailed rendering of the architecture which formed the main subject of his work, confirms that, at least in his earlier work, his primary concern was with architecture.<br>
<br>From Jerusalem, Arundale travelled north to Tyre, Sidon, and Beirut, before returning home via Cyprus, Greece, and Rome. While in Rome he sat for his portrait &#145;in the costume of an inhabitant of Mount Lebanon&#146; to Penry Williams, whom he probably met on his way to Egypt in 1830: his studio was a meeting-place for British artists in the city. The portrait shows a tall, spare, dark-eyed, and heavily bearded figure in oriental dress; before him stands a narghile, the pipe of which he holds in one hand; through the Moorish window in the background a view of a domed mosque and minaret is silhouetted against an evening sky. Subsequently engraved by Maxim Gauci for Arundale's <span class="italic">Illustrations of Jerusalem and Sinai</span> (1837), the portrait conveys a romantic, almost Byronic, view of its subject, a view that is upheld not only by reference to Arundale's letters and journal but also by the mood of his finished paintings.<br>
<br>Between 1830 and 1852 Arundale exhibited at the Royal Academy over forty works, mainly views of Greek, Roman, and Egyptian ruins, some of which were large oil paintings. It was possibly at the academy that he met Mary Ann Pickersgill (<i>c</i>.1806&#150;1893), miniaturist, who exhibited five works in the 1838 exhibition and whom he married on 11 October that year. She was the daughter of the portrait painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22216/', "H. W. Pickersgill")</script>. They lived first at 48 Greek Street, London, also the address of the partnership of Arundale and Heap, architects. It seems that Arundale was not particularly active as a practising architect (his only executed design appears to have been for a boathouse for Mr Bowyer Adderly in Birmingham, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839); by 1841 he was involved with Bonomi in preparing for publication <span class="italic">A Gallery of Antiquities Selected from the British Museum</span> (1842&#150;3), with descriptions by Samuel Birch. His next project was to translate (with T. L. Donaldson) the four-volume <span class="italic">Architecture ancienne et moderne</span> by Jules Gailhabaud; the resulting <span class="italic">Ancient and Modern Architecture</span> appeared between 1844 and 1846.<br>
<br>Declining health led to a move in 1845 from 11 Berners Street, London, to 15 Devonshire Place, Brighton. Arundale's next publication, a technical work entitled <span class="italic">Designs for Verandahs</span> (1851), appeared in the same year as the exhibition at the Royal Academy of his unusual history painting <span class="italic">The Meeting of Godfrey and Alexis</span> (priv. coll.), which depicts the arrival of the Crusader leader, Godfrey de Bouillon, at Constantinople in 1096, when he was met by the emperor, Alexius Comnenus. The year 1852 was the last in which he sent work to the Royal Academy exhibition; these were two views, one of Greece and one of Egypt. His last recorded works were two watercolour sketches of Brighton (priv. coll.), taken from the downs above the town, painted shortly before his death on 9 September 1853, aged forty-six. At the height of his powers Arundale sent to the 1843 Royal Academy exhibition <span class="italic">St Peter's from the Tiber</span> (priv. coll.), in which the viewer's eye is led from a small boat in the foreground, from which a fisherman is casting a hook, in the direction of a punt crossing the river towards a line of flat barges on the far bank; these lie opposite a row of old riverfront houses which stretch back from the picture plane towards, in the distance, the cupola of St Peter's and the castle of St Angelus. Over all the clear sky and soft Roman light, the source surely of Arundale's inspiration, evoke a balanced stillness, which, as Vialla suggests, while they certainly make this his masterpiece, also confirm that many of his works deserve equally to be considered as landscapes and as architectural drawings. Arundale was described by one obituarist as &#145;an amiable man and an accomplished artist&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 84), and another noted that &#145;he had the enviable quality of never losing a friend on his travels, and during his residence in his native land&#146;  (<span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, 50). With five young children to support, his widow moved back to London, where, as Mary Ann Arundale, she continued to paint portraits, and exhibited at the Royal Academy until 1862.<br>
