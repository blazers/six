<span class="headword">Caus,  Salomon  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1576&#150;1626), <span class="occ">engineer and architect</span>, was born in the pays de Caux (whence derived the family name) in Normandy, probably in Dieppe. He was a relative (possibly an uncle) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7406/', "Isaac de Caus (1589/90&#150;1648)")</script>. In all probability Salomon's parents were Huguenots who took refuge in England. Knowledge about de Caus's youth is restricted to what he himself revealed in the dedications of his books. He studied such classical authors as Hero of Alexandria, Vitruvius, and Pliny, and was also familiar with the historical works of Diodorus Siculus and Diogenes Laertius. He derived his knowledge of mathematics from the first six books of Euclid and was acquainted with technical treatises by Jacques Besson and Agostino Ramelli.<br>
<br>From about 1595 until about 1598 de Caus journeyed through Italy, a tour which proved to be of great importance for his education. After his Italian travels, about 1598 he became an engineer in the service of the archdukes Albert and Isabella at Brussels. Here he became responsible for the construction of artificial grottoes and fountains in their gardens in Brussels and on their estate at Mariemont. On 21 January 1605 he received an official appointment as engineer to the archdukes, and on 10 April 1606 he married Hester Picart in the parish of St G&eacute;ry in Brussels. Their only son, William, was baptized on 24 February 1607, but died shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>In 1610 de Caus became an engineer in London at the court of James I. During his stay in Brussels he had already given some lessons in perspective to Henry, prince of Wales, and he was now attached to Henry's household at Richmond Palace. He supervised and transformed gardens for Queen Anne, the prince of Wales, and some of the principal courtiers. With his relative Isaac, he built the porticoes and loggias of Gorhambury and Campden House, Kensington. He must have known Cornelis Drebbel, who at that time&#151;like de Caus&#151;was in the service of Henry as an inventor. De Caus made a number of ingenious discoveries, which he later published in the second part of his <span class="italic">Les raisons des forces mouvantes</span>.<br>
<br>De Caus gave drawing lessons to Princess Elizabeth, Henry's youngest sister, and built a picture gallery at Richmond Palace for Henry, who was a great art lover; in 1612 he published the lessons he had given to Henry as <span class="italic">La perspective avec la raison des ombres et miroirs</span>. The death of the prince in November of that year marked the end of his employment. On 26 July 1613 he was paid &pound;50 &#145;for attendance on the late Prince&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1611&#150;18</i>). In the year of Henry's death his sister Elizabeth married the elector palatine, Frederick V, and she asked de Caus to join her entourage. At her husband's residence, the castle of Heidelberg, de Caus designed a fabulous emblematic garden, for which the hillside had to be terraced; he later described the technical problems he had to conquer in his <span class="italic">Hortus palatinus, a Frederico rege Boemiae, electore palatino, Heidelbergae exstructus</span> (1620). On 14 July 1614 he became the elector's official engineer and architect. During his stay at Heidelberg he published two other works, <span class="italic">Institution harmonique divis&eacute;e en deux parties: en la premi&egrave;re sont monstr&eacute;es les proportions des intervalles harmoniques, et en la deuxiesme les compositions d'icelles</span> and, his most important work, <span class="italic">Les raisons des forces mouvantes avec diverses machines tant utilles que plaisantes: aus quelles sont adjoints plusieurs desseings de grottes et fontaines</span>, both in 1615.<br>
<br>In 1619 Elizabeth became queen of Bohemia for one winter; she later settled at The Hague. De Caus did not follow her into exile, but returned to France. During the years 1618&#150;20 he had vainly negotiated with the council of Rouen about the construction of a bridge over the Seine; in 1620 he was employed in public works in Paris, where his duties involved the transportation of water from the Seine into the city, both for drinking water and for cleaning the streets and the squares. In the last years of his life he occupied himself mainly with mathematical studies. His last book&#151;which was on the subject of sundials&#151;was published in 1624.<br>
<br>De Caus supplemented his income by producing air- and water-driven engines, which were used mainly to make emblematic figures to move. He used water, light, and artificial or solar heat as sources of energy. From <span class="italic">Les raisons des forces mouvantes</span>, it appears that he was an Aristotelian: he explained the action of his machines in terms of the four Aristotelian elements earth, water, fire, and air. Both artist and artisan, he attempted to place his inventions in a magico-philosophical framework. He died in Paris, where he was living with his wife in the rue Poitou. On 15 January 1626 they made a mutual last will, from which it appears that they had no children. De Caus was buried at the protestant cemetery La Trinit&eacute; at Paris on 28 February 1626.<br>
