<span class="headword">Cunningham,  Anna <span class="st"> [Anne]</span></span>, marchioness of Hamilton  (<em>d.</em> 1647), <span class="occ">noblewoman</span>, was the fourth daughter of three sons and six daughters born to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74471/', "James Cunningham, sixth earl of Glencairn (c.1552&#150;1630)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54161/', "Cunningham family")</script>] and his first wife, Mariot or Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1610), daughter of Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and his second wife, Catherine Ruthven. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45812/', "Margaret Cunningham (d. 1622?)")</script>, who married Sir James Hamilton, master of Evandale, was her sister. Anna's date of birth is unknown, but on 30 January 1603 she was contracted to marry the fourteen-year-old <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12085/', "Lord James Hamilton (1589&#150;1625)")</script>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12103/', "John Hamilton, first marquess of Hamilton (1539/40&#150;1604)")</script>, bringing with her a dowry of 40,000 merks Scots (&pound;2222 sterling). The following year her husband inherited his father's titles and James VI and I subsequently made him a gentleman of the bedchamber, a privy councillor, and steward of the royal household. He spent much of his time at court, leaving his plain but capable wife to bring up their family of at least eight children, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12134/', "William Hamilton, later second duke of Hamilton")</script>, and run his vast estates.<br>
<br>This the marchioness did, with energy and decision. She rode constantly round their lands, which stretched from Arran in the west of Scotland to Kinneil in the east, and oversaw all the expenditure. She did not learn to write until adult life, but the accounts bear her signature of authorization and some of them are entirely in her bold, italic hand, her calculations done in an alarming mixture of arabic and roman numerals. She initiated building work, employed the well-known decorative painter Valentine Jenkin to embellish ceilings and walls both at Hamilton Palace, the principal family seat, and at Kinneil, re-stocked the palace deer park, and undertook extensive planting. In the 1630s, thanking her relative Sir Colin Campbell of Glenorchy for fir seeds, she told him:<blockquote>Belive me, I think moir of them nor ye can imagin, for I love them moir nor I dou all the frout tris in the wordil. I have alrady ane four or fayf houndir of my awin planting that is pratti treis. (Breadalbane muniments, GD112/860b)</blockquote>As is evident from her will, the marchioness also supervised industrial activities. She left to her eldest son the rights to her coalworks at Kinneil. In the past, she said, this enterprise had cost her much money and her servants had reaped the rewards, but she believed that the works were now in such a good state that they would bring him substantial benefit. Likewise she left him all her salt pans, &#145;for the profit wil be greit give [if] God send piece&#146;  (Hamilton archives, RH98/29/3).<br>
<br>After her husband's sudden death in London in 1625, Anna continued to run the estates for their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12087/', "James Hamilton, third marquess and later first duke of Hamilton (1606&#150;1649)")</script>. He was Charles I's principal Scottish adviser, and the outbreak of the first bishops' war in 1639 brought mother and son into conflict. As a convinced covenanter who was said to have attended conventicles in person, and who participated in the Shotts revival about 1630, the marchioness was bitterly opposed to Charles's ecclesiastical innovations, and when her son was appointed to command a royalist fleet sent north in June 1638 to crush the king's opponents she raised a troop of cavalry for the covenanting cause. According to contemporary reports, she rode at its head by day and by night, with her pistols and carbine at her side, threatening to shoot her son with a silver bullet should he set foot in Scotland.<br>
<br>The marchioness none the less continued to look after her son's estates, and three years later he sent his elder daughter, Anne [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12046/', "Hamilton, Anne (1632&#150;1716)")</script>], to be brought up by her. He himself returned to Hamilton in 1646 and sent for his younger daughter, Susanna. The girls were deeply upset when the marchioness fell seriously ill the following autumn during a visit to Edinburgh. Their father declined to take them to see her, however, telling them, &#145;Your sorrows would be increased, to be an eye-witness of her weak condition&#146;  (Marshall, <span class="italic">Duchess Anne</span>, 23). She died soon afterwards and was buried on 16 September 1647 at Hamilton parish church as she had wished, &#145;in the tombe of Hamilton, besayd my deir lord&#146;  (Hamilton archives, RH98/29/3).<br>
