<span class="headword">Wilson <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>O'Brien]</span>,  Florence Roma Muir</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Romer Wilson]</span>  (1891&#150;1930), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born at 30 Collegiate Crescent, Ecclesall, on 26 December 1891 to Arnold Muir Wilson, a solicitor, of Whiteley Wood Hall, Sheffield, and Amy Letitia Wilson, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dearden. From the age of two until sixteen she lived &#145;in a dark old manor house on the edge of the moors just outside Sheffield&#146;. During her childhood the family spent summers at the seaside and also frequently travelled to the continent. For four years from the age of fifteen she attended West Heath School, Ham, in the Thames valley. In 1911 she studied law at Girton College, Cambridge, where she &#145;existed&#146; &#145;with considerable boredom&#146;. She passed her examinations in 1914 &#145;with mediocre honours&#146;. A professor influenced her to try her hand at fiction and she initially wrote &#145;rubbish for a typewritten private magazine&#146;  (Kunitz and Haycraft, 1532).<br>
<br>The First World War destroyed her hopes of enjoying a pleasant social life after university, but the enforced inactivity prompted her in the summer of 1915 to begin a draft of her first novel, <span class="italic">Martin Sch&uuml;ler</span>. Although she completed the first half in three weeks, she reached an impasse, and eventually threw the manuscript out. A friend retrieved it and Wilson continued working on it in 1917, finishing it in another three weeks. During these years she also contributed to the war effort by selling potatoes for the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Martin Sch&uuml;ler</span> (1918) tells the story of an obsessionally driven German composer, who ruthlessly exploits people, particularly women, in his pursuit of inspiration and fame. Sch&uuml;ler does succeed in producing an operatic masterpiece, but dies on the opening night of its production in Berlin in 1914. Several influences can be detected in the work: Sch&uuml;ler himself is influenced by Wagner; his selfish lust for genius at any cost suggests a Faustian pact with the devil and also brings to mind Oscar Wilde's Dorian Gray; in his belief in his superiority, especially over women, he resembles the Nietzschean <i>&Uuml;bermensch</i>. The tragic denouement suggests a strong critique of these conceptions of the artist and a subtext of fear of German dominance, though on the surface the novel seems oblivious to the war, as several reviewers noted. Edward Shanks termed the novel an &#145;extraordinary <i>tour de force</i> of the creative imagination&#146;  (Shanks, 343), and recalled that it created something of a sensation in artistic circles when it was published in October 1918.<br>
<br>Wilson's second novel, <span class="italic">If All These Young Men</span>, written before this date, directly confronts the enervating impact of the war on the home front, and unusually expresses another fear, of &#145;England's ruin and the ruin of humanity in an endless war&#146;  (R. Wilson, <span class="italic">If All these Young Men</span>, 1919, 88). With slight satire, Wilson traces the unstable relationships of several characters emotionally drained by the war. Josephine Miller feels particularly constricted, displaced, and impotent because of her ambiguous role as a woman in wartime.<br>
<br>Following the novel's publication in 1919 Wilson turned her hand to writing a play, entitled <span class="italic">The Social Climbers</span> (published in 1927), and then quickly immersed herself in <span class="italic">The Death of Society</span>, the novel that garnered her the most attention of all her novels as well as the Hawthornden prize in 1921. This novel portrays the transcendent love that a solitary Englishman, Rane Smith, develops for an older Norwegian woman, Rosa, the wife of the philosopher Karl Ingman, while a guest at the couple's home. Though very modern in its critique of societal mores that thwart true love, the novel suffers from some distinctly purple passages and from the curious detail that the lovers cannot understand each other's language, which makes the relationship's profundity less believable.<br>
<br>While in Italy correcting proofs on her next novel, <span class="italic">The Grand Tour</span> (1923), about a French sculptor, Wilson met the anthologist Edward Joseph H. O'Brien (1890&#150;1941) of Boston, USA, whom she married in 1923. They had one son. From 1928 the family resided at the Villa Pauliska in Locarno, Switzerland. Her subsequent novels, notably the modern pastoral romance <span class="italic">Greenlow</span> (1927), express a longing for harmony with nature as a means of overcoming the ravages of industrialization. Wilson also produced a romantic biography of Emily Bront&euml;, several collections of fairy-tales, and a collection of short stories, <span class="italic">Tender Advice</span> (1935), featuring studies of the artistic temperament, her forte.<br>
<br>In appearance Wilson was tall and slim, with dark hair. According to Robert Nichols, &#145;Her face, of singular beauty &hellip; bore an extraordinary resemblance to that of Keats. &hellip; The great eyes had the same dark fervour, brilliance, and depth. &hellip; She talked wonderfully. Her speech was &hellip; elliptical, gnomic, the flight of a winged horse&#146;  (Kunitz and Haycraft, 1532). Like Keats, she died of tuberculosis, on 11 January 1930 in Lausanne.<br>
<br>Surprisingly, Wilson has received virtually no contemporary critical attention. In 1930 Shanks likened the moments of poetic lyricism in her novels to those in Walter de la Mare's fantasies; her contributions to post-war lyric fiction need to be assessed as well alongside her female contemporaries Stella Benson, Katherine Mansfield, and Virginia Woolf.<br>
