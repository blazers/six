<span class="headword">Place,  Francis</span>  (1647&#150;1728), <span class="occ">printmaker and potter</span>, was the fifth son of Rowland Place (1616&#150;1680) of Dinsdale, co. Durham, and his wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1670), daughter and coheiress of Charles Wise of Copgrove, Yorkshire. Place was persuaded to enter the law as his father had done, and was articled to an attorney at Gray's Inn until the outbreak of the plague forced him to leave both the profession and London in 1665. By this time, Place had already discovered a gift for drawing and engraving through his contact with Wenceslaus Hollar, who became a close personal friend, although not his tutor. Unlike most other amateurs, Place began to practise his art professionally. Hollar invited Place to etch seventeen plates for John Ogilby's edition of Jan Nieuhoff's <span class="italic">Embassy to the Emperor of China</span> in 1669, his earliest essay in topography. Dutch publishers (including Hugo Allardt and Frederick de Witt, among others) also issued Place's prints, which may suggest that he travelled to the Low Countries, possibly with Hollar. Clearly he had a continental market, which was very unusual for British printmakers at this time.<br>
<br>Between 1668 and 1680 Place travelled widely throughout Britain making sketches, particularly between 1677 and 1678, and again after his father's death in 1680. About 1680 Place's interests and activities widened further as he became involved with the antiquarian group the Virtuosi of York, where he eventually settled. Place became an intimate friend of many artists and antiquarians in and around York, including Ralph Thoresby and William Lodge, with whom Place went on many drawing and angling excursions; sketchbooks of these tours are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. As a result of the Popish Plot, during one trip to Wales, Place and Lodge found themselves imprisoned as suspected Jesuit spies. Although Place's works were typically wide-ranging for an amateur of his time, his landscapes were unique in the way he combined natural detail with real places and imaginary idealism. His set of etched Italian scenes for the publisher Arthur Tooker (only two now survive) reflected a continental influence unknown in any other British artist of his time. Place may also have drawn some naval shipping as a royal commission.<br>
<br>In addition to topographical views of London and York (BM and V&amp;A), Place also took an interest in three-dimensional botanical drawing (Hospitalfield collection) which was quite unlike the two-dimensional style that was typical of the period. Animals and still life also preoccupied him. He etched the plates to Godartius's <span class="italic">Book of Insects</span> (1681) and several sets of birds and animals after Francis Barlow. For a short time about 1688 Place was involved in horse-racing with Lord Fairfax. His angling trips provided source material for his numerous studies of &#145;fishing fowle&#146;. Between 1666 and 1667 the Dutch tavern scenes of Teniers and Brouwer were reproduced by Place, the latter in mezzotint, making Place one of the earliest to use the new technique after Prince Rupert, who first introduced it in 1658. Place's portrait of Richard Tompson after G. Soust is said to be his finest mezzotint  (Croft-Murray, 456). Via Hollar, Place received a commission from Sir Jonas Moore to produce a series of etchings after Robert Thacker's drawings of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich to commemorate its opening in 1676. Place also produced plates for the publications of his friends, including Ralph Thoresby's <span class="italic">Ducatus Leodiensis</span> (1715; Brotherton Library, Leeds) and Francis Drake's <span class="italic">Eboracum</span> (1736; City Art Gallery, York). His portraits are rare (BM) and often depict his &#145;virtuoso&#146; friends, notably Henry Gyles, the glass-painter, whose portrait Place designed for a tradecard (Heals 90.42. BM). This portrait was also produced in crayon, as were a number of other &#145;admirable drawings&#146;  (Croft-Murray, 457).<br>
<br>The &#145;ingenious&#146; Place's virtuosity and enthusiasm led him to experiment with oil painting from 1680, stoneware pottery glazing, and the manufacture of porcelain from 1683, which he abandoned in 1694 owing to his lack of commercial success. Only four of his marbled greyware pots are known to have survived, one of which is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. His style was not dissimilar to that of John Dwight, a professional potter with whom Place was acquainted  (Hake, letter 11 in Tyler, 127.83). Place's maturer drawing style evoked that of Bartolomeus Breenburgh, Antoni Waterloo, and Francis Towne, and in his latter years, Claude, by which time Place was treated as an old master. Comparatively unfinished, Place's drawings have survived because of the value of them to their virtuoso owners. About 1680 Place married Mrs Ann Wintringham, with whom he had one daughter, Elizabeth; presumably his wife died, and he married Mrs Ann Wilkinson (1662/1663&#150;1752) in 1693, with whom he had two daughters, Ann and Frances. Place painted himself in oil, possibly at the time of this second marriage (Arbroath collection). He died at his home, King's Manor, York, on 21 September 1728, aged eighty-one, and was buried in St Olave's Church, York.<br>
<br>Place's manor house, its contents including his collection of works of art (Hollar, Barlow, Jan Van de Velde, and Manby's drawings of Roman ruins), and his natural and artificial rarities were all left to his wife, who sold many of his paintings. The remaining collection was later divided between their two daughters, Ann Parrott and Frances Wyndham, on Ann Wilkinson's death in 1752 but was later reunited through descent by Francis Parrott, Place's grandson. In turn, Parrott willed the estate to his sister, Elizabeth Fraser, widow of Major John Fraser of Hospitalfield, Arbroath, part of which came up for sale in 1931 at Sothebys.<br>
