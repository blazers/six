<span class="headword">Clerk, Sir  John, of Penicuik</span>, second baronet  (1676&#150;1755), <span class="occ">politician and antiquary</span>, was born at Edinburgh on 8 February 1676, the second child and eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47927/', "Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, first baronet (1649/50&#150;1722)")</script>, landowner and coal owner, and his first wife, Elizabeth Hendersone, who died aged twenty-five leaving seven children. With his second wife the first Sir John had a further nine children. Clerk's merchant grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107331/', "John Clerk (1611&#150;1674)")</script>, had bought the estate of Penicuik, Edinburghshire, and the first baronet had developed the coal reserves there. Clerk was educated at Penicuik parish school and Glasgow University, before being sent for legal study to Leiden in the Netherlands. After three years there, during which he developed considerable skill on the harpsichord and became a close friend of Herman Boerhaave, he went on a two-year European tour. He spent considerable periods of time in Vienna, Rome, and Paris, and acquired an enthusiasm for Italian music and Roman antiquities.<br>
<br>On returning to Scotland, Clerk was admitted advocate in 1700, and on 23 February 1701 married Lady Margaret Stewart, eldest daughter of the third earl of Galloway. She died in childbirth within the year, leaving him with a son who died aged twenty-one. The marriage brought Clerk into politics as a firm supporter of the proposed Hanoverian succession and an adherent of the Church of Scotland. He represented Whithorn in the Scottish parliament (1703&#150;7), a constituency under the control of his father-in-law, and came into the political circle of the second duke of Queensberry. In 1703&#150;4 Clerk served on a commission to examine the public accounts; he was one of a small group who made a thorough investigation into the leakage of public money, and he wrote the commission's report. He thus gained a reputation for public finance, which led to his appointment in 1706 as one of the thirty-one Scottish commissioners for the treaty of union with England. His <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> (not published until 1892) are one of the few historical sources for the treaty negotiations. It was Clerk who checked the calculation for the Equivalent, the recompense to be paid to Scotland for accepting the burden of a share in the interest payments on the English national debt. He served as one of the Scottish members for the first parliament of Great Britain in 1707, and was involved in the transfer to Scotland of the exchequer bills for the Equivalent and the return of the retired notes. He retired from politics in 1708, having been appointed a baron of the newly created court of the exchequer in Scotland, a semi-sinecure which gave him &pound;500 a year. His second marriage, on 15 November 1709, was to Janet Inglis (<i>d</i>. 1760), daughter of Sir John Inglis of Cramond, baronet; they had nine sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5618/', "John Clerk of Eldin (1728&#150;1812)")</script>, naval writer, and seven daughters.<br>
<br>Clerk inherited the family estate and the baronetcy in 1722. His income, talents, interests, and occupation gave him opportunities for cultured leisure activities. He improved his estate, planting trees and modernizing the tenancies, gave advice to landed neighbours on their coalmines, and designed and commissioned the construction of a new house, Mavisbank, at Loanhead, Edinburghshire. Clerk wrote and played music, and cultivated literary figures, the most notable of whom was the poet Allan Ramsay (1686&#150;1758). Clerk was one of the earliest and most constant patrons of Ramsay, who used to spend a portion of each summer under his roof. The premature death of Clerk's first son in 1722 was made the occasion for an elegy by Ramsay. After the poet's death an obelisk was erected in his memory at Penicuik.<br>
<br>Clerk followed up his enthusiasm for Roman remains and the classics with excavations, and made a collection of Roman finds. At Penicuik House he accumulated a valuable collection of antiquities, which brought him membership of the Society of Antiquaries in 1727. He served on the board of trustees for manufactures from its start, was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1729, and was also president of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society. He died on 4 October 1755, at Penicuik House, and was succeeded as third baronet by his son James (<i>d</i>. 1782). From 1760 James began the redesign of Penicuik in the Palladian style.<br>
<br>Sir John Clerk published a number of works on political and antiquarian themes, and many other writings were still in manuscript form at his death. <span class="italic">An Essay upon the Intended Limitations</span> (1703) was a response to criticisms of the union with England; and it was followed by two further pamphlets, <span class="italic">A Letter to a Friend Giving an Account of how the Treaty of Union has been Received</span> (1706) and <span class="italic">An Essay upon the XV. Article of the Treaty of Union</span> (1706). A manuscript entitled &#145;Observations on the present circumstances of Scotland&#146;, comprising a balanced review of the economy, was first published by the Scottish History Society only in 1965 (<span class="italic">Miscellany</span>, 10). With the chief baron of the exchequer he wrote <span class="italic">A Historical View of the Forms and Powers of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland</span>, published in 1820. Two short papers by Clerk also appeared in <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>: in 1731 &#145;De stylis veterum et diversis chartarum generibus&#146;, and in 1738 &#145;An account of the observation of the late solar eclipse made at Edinburgh on February 18th 1736&#150;7&#146;. In 1750 he published <span class="italic">Dissertatio de monumentis quibusdam Romanis in Boreali Magnae Britanniae parte detectis anno MDCCXXI</span>. He wrote over many years a long Latin paper, &#145;De imperio Britannico&#146;, a history of English-Scottish relations. It was summarized and translated and published for the Scottish Historical Society in 1973. His musical compositions, mostly pieces for chamber orchestra, almost entirely remain in manuscript.<br>
<br>Clerk's <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> give a view of the culture of Scottish landed society, especially at the time of the union with England; they also provide perceptive comments on the economy. Although not published until 1892, the editor noted that &#145;the passages, in particular, which deal with his two interviews with Queen Anne, if they want the dignity of formal history &hellip; bring us close to the time and the scenes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 15).<br>
