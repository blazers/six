<span class="headword">Tatham,  John</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1632&#150;1664), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was probably born about 1612, though nothing is known about his place of birth or parentage. His first play, a pastoral drama called <span class="italic">Love Crowns the End</span>, was published in 1640 in his volume of verse entitled <span class="italic">The Fancies Theater</span> (reissued as <span class="italic">The Mirrour of Fancies</span> in 1657), but it had been &#145;acted by the scholars of Bingham, in the county of Nottingham in 1632&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dramatic Works</span>, 3). He probably saw military service on the royalist side during the civil war under Lord Carnarvon, and his writings show a staunch devotion to the king's cause. (They also show an immoderate dislike of Scotland and the Scots.) A second play, called <span class="italic">The Distracted State</span>, was published in 1650 (dated 1651). According to the title-page it was written in 1641, but this may well be a ruse to distract attention from the evident contemporary relevance of its royalist story. The Sicilian King Evander has been deposed in a civil war; a series of usurpers contend for power until the supposedly dead king reappears. It seems that neither <span class="italic">The Distracted State</span> nor Tatham's subsequent satirical comedy <span class="italic">The Scots Figgaries</span> (1652) was ever performed. But his play <span class="italic">The Rump, or, The Mirrour of the Late Times</span> achieved widespread notoriety with its satire of actual republican politicians. &#145;Acted Many Times with Great Applause, at the Private House in Dorset-Court&#146;  (title-page), it was first staged in June 1660, a month after the king's return, and repeated at Oxford in July 1661. Printed in autumn 1660 it was expanded and went through three further editions in 1661. Tatham's political satire was given a new lease of life in the exclusion crisis when <span class="italic">The Rump</span> was plagiarized by Aphra Behn in 1681 for her play <span class="italic">The Roundheads</span>. Also attributed to Tatham, though doubtfully, is a brief play called <span class="italic">Knavery in All Trades, or, The Coffee-House</span> (1664), which was &#145;Acted in the Christmas Holidays by several Apprentices with great Applause&#146;  (title-page). Besides these plays Tatham published a volume principally consisting of love poems, <span class="italic">Ostella, or, The Faction of Love and Beauty Reconcil'd</span> (1650). <span class="italic">Daphnes, a Pastorall</span> was printed in 1651, but only the title-page survives.<br>
<br>Tatham found his widest and most appreciative audience with the pageants which he wrote annually from 1657 to 1664 for the lord mayor of London. Staged partly on land and partly on the river most were celebrations of the good government and commercial success of the City: the 1659 pageant staged by the Grocers' Company includes appreciative speeches from a European, an Egyptian, and a Persian, while the 1661 celebration features the allegorical figures of Justice and Mercy. In July 1660 the City welcomed the return of Charles II with Tatham's spectacular pageant called <span class="italic">Londons Glory Represented by Time, Truth, and Fame</span>. The disappearance of Tatham from view after 1664 has prompted speculation that he died in the plague of 1665 or in the great fire of 1666.<br>
