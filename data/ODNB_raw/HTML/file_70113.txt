<span class="headword">Norsa,  Hannah</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1784), <span class="occ">singer and actress</span>, was the daughter of Issachar Norsa (<i>d</i>. 1748?), a Jewish tavern keeper. She made her stage d&eacute;but as Polly in John Gay's <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span> on 16 December 1732 in the newly opened Covent Garden Theatre and was an immediate success, the revival having a continuous run of twenty nights. Miss Norsa remained a leading singer and actress at Covent Garden, appearing in numerous ballad operas and musical afterpieces. In February 1733 she created the heroine, Deidamia, in Gay's posthumously produced ballad opera <span class="italic">Achilles</span>, and in Johann Ernst Galliard's <span class="italic">Nuptial Masque</span> she sang Cupid, &#145;the first Time of her appearing in Boy's Cloaths&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Journal</span>, 16 March 1734). Her non-singing roles included Dorinda in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span> and Serena in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>. Hannah's brother, Master Norsa, appeared with a children's company, the Lilliputians, in May 1734. The following spring he was joined by his younger sister, &#145;Little Miss Norsa&#146;, who then danced at Hannah's Covent Garden benefit on 29 April. Brother and younger sister made their final appearances in June and July 1736 at the Haymarket Theatre.<br>
<br>Hannah Norsa remained at Covent Garden until early May 1736, when she was taken off the stage by Robert Walpole, first Baron Walpole and later second earl of Orford (<i>c</i>.1701&#150;1751), son of the prime minister Sir Robert Walpole and elder brother of Horace Walpole. Lord Walpole's marriage in 1724 to an heiress had proved unhappy; they were living apart and eventually obtained a legal separation. Hannah Norsa remained Walpole's mistress until his death, staying with him at Houghton Hall, Norfolk, after he became earl of Orford in 1745. Mrs Kerrich, the wife of a local rector and daughter of an archdeacon, was favourably impressed, despite earlier misgivings about the propriety of visiting:<blockquote>She is a very agreeable Woman, &amp; Nobody ever behav'd better in her Station, She have every body's good word, and bear great Sway at Houghton, She is every thing but Lady, She came here in a Landau &amp; Six horses &amp; one Mr Paxton a young Clergyman with her. (Pyle, 244)</blockquote>Orford was in debt when he died, and according to William Cooke, Hannah lost the &pound;3000 legacy from her father which she had lent him. However, when she made her will in 1766 she owned about &pound;3000 in stocks, together with diamond jewellery and gold and silver plate, so Cooke's report may have been unfounded. Hannah's sister Rachel had married Edward Wilford, the brother of Priscilla, wife of the theatre manager John Rich, and after Orford's death she lived for a time with the Riches. In August 1766 Hannah Norsa was resident in Rotterdam, on friendly terms with the family of Benjamin Sowden, the minister of the English Presbyterian church there; she left him her <span class="roman">Bible</span> and Thomas Tillotson's <span class="italic">Works</span> and made generous bequests to his children, while leaving the bulk of her estate to her sister and nephews. She was living in the parish of St Margaret, Westminster, in 1771, when she added a codicil to her will. She died at her lodgings in Queen's Row, Brompton Road, Kensington, and was buried at St Mary Abbots, Kensington, on 28 August 1784.<br>
