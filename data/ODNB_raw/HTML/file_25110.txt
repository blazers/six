<span class="headword">Seton family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1300&#150;<em>c.</em>1510), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, had its territorial base in Lothian, where Seton and Winton, east of Edinburgh, were united with Winchburgh, on the west of the town, by William the Lion to make one knight's fee for Philip of Seton. The position of the family was later enhanced through service to Robert I, although this was hardly unwavering, as <a name="cosubject_25110"></a><span class="headword">Sir Alexander Seton</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1348)<span class="occ"></span>, who made a bond in 1308 with two other Bruce adherents to defend Robert I and the realm of Scotland, was nevertheless in English service from 1309 until 1314. Personal considerations, probably concerning the security of his Lothian lands, may have led to this inconsistency, but his defection to the Scottish side on the eve of Bannockburn, reputedly bringing crucial intelligence of the poor morale in the English camp, led to Seton's rapid rehabilitation. He became one of a small group of trusted counsellors at the heart of royal service, attending the king regularly and holding the position of steward of Robert I's household in 1317, and steward to the king's infant son David from August 1328.<br>
<br>Seton was employed as an envoy in truce negotiations between 1317 and 1320, and his name appears on the declaration of Arbroath. He held Tranent, Myles, Elphinstone, and Falside in Haddingtonshire, in addition to land at Barns and the nearby east mill beside Haddington, these last being given by King Robert for services in Ireland as well as Scotland. As a further mark of favour, his lands of Seton were erected into a free barony, with the town of Seton achieving burghal status. By January 1328 he was governor of the town of Berwick, then a place of considerable military activity. His sons Alexander and William were killed fighting for David II in 1332&#150;3, while during the siege of Berwick by Edward III in 1333, a third son, Thomas, was reputedly hanged on Edward's orders in sight of the town's garrison. After the battle of Halidon Hill in the same year, Seton accepted the need to maintain his position by working with the English victors, and attended Edward Balliol's parliament in 1334, but he was willing to swear allegiance to David II as soon as the Scottish side proved triumphant. Seton died <i>c</i>.1348, having been predeceased by all his sons.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54319"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Seton</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1347)<span class="occ"></span> was her grandfather's heir. The chronicler Andrew Wyntoun relates the story of Margaret Seton's forcible abduction in 1347 by Alan Wyntoun (an ancestor of his), who may have been her distant relative as the Setons held the lands of Winton; and Bower embellishes the story with the consequent complaint brought before the king's court by her relatives, in settlement of which David II offered Margaret the choice of marrying Wyntoun or having him executed. Although Margaret chose marriage, her husband took the cross not long afterwards, according to Andrew Wyntoun in response to the continuing hostility of the Seton family, and died in the Holy Land. Their son, William, bore the name of Seton, being recorded as such on a charter of <i>c</i>.1367. According to Bower, he also went on crusade, but had returned to Scotland by 14 September 1402, when he fought at the battle of Homildon Hill, following which he was captured and imprisoned. He married Janet Fleming, elder daughter of Sir David Fleming of Biggar, with whom he had John, Alexander, and Janet. In 1408 his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61150/', "Alexander Seton")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25111/', "Seton, Alexander, first earl of Huntly (d. 1470)")</script>], married Elizabeth, the daughter and heir of Adam, lord of Gordon, from whom the earls of Huntly were descended [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54209/', "Gordon family")</script>].<br>
<br>John Seton had succeeded his father by 1407, serving in that year as a hostage for the return from English captivity of Archibald, fourth earl of Douglas. On 24 March 1411 he received a charter from Robert Stewart, duke of Albany, the governor of Scotland, confirming him in the baronies of Seton and Tranent, and the lands of Winchburgh. He was appointed a commissioner to treat for the release of James I, and served briefly as a hostage for the king in 1424, his estates being valued at 600 marks, although he was released from his obligation in March 1424 as one of the men exchanged for other hostages. His subsequent service in the king's council underlines the reliance placed by James I at this time on support from prominent members of the Douglas affinity. Seton was dead by 1434. His son William had been killed at the battle of Verneuil in 1424, and so he was succeeded by his grandson.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_25119"></a><span class="headword">George Seton</span>, first Lord Seton  (<em>d.</em> 1478)<span class="occ"></span>, was a minor when he inherited, his lands and possessions, including a colliery at Tranent, being held in ward to the crown. He attained his majority by November 1437, and embarked on a career of court service which may have owed much to his family's Douglas connections during the minority of James II, possibly leading to his becoming a lord of parliament as early as 1445, although the style George, Lord Seton, indicating royal sanction, appears in official records only by 1451. In 1448 he travelled to France with the chancellor Lord Crichton, on an embassy to Flanders, France, and Burgundy to seek a foreign marriage for James II, and he returned to Flanders in 1449 or 1450 with Thomas Spens and other ambassadors, as part of a diplomatic mission connected with the downfall of the Livingston family. Notwithstanding the Setons' Douglas connections, political pragmatism seems to have determined George Seton's loyalty to the king, and he sat in parliament as Lord Seton on 14 June 1452, when James II sought to explain the murder of the eighth earl of Douglas to the three estates. He attended the king's council held at Dunfermline on 11 July 1458, and sat on the assize which condemned Robert, first Lord Boyd, and his son Thomas, earl of Arran, on 22 November 1469. He served as an ambassador to England in 1472&#150;3. He died in 1478, and was buried at the church of the Black Friars in Edinburgh. He had married Margaret Stewart, daughter of John, earl of Buchan. They had a son, John, who died in 1476, having married Christian, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54270/', "John Lindsay, Lord Lindsay of the Byres")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54268/', "Lindsay family of the Byres")</script>], with whom he had a son.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54320"></a><span class="headword">George Seton</span>, second Lord Seton  (<em>d.</em> 1507/8)<span class="occ"></span>, succeeded his grandfather. He had studied at the universities of St Andrews and Paris, and undertook diplomatic duties in 1497 and 1499. In addition to his political and administrative activities, there is evidence that he engaged in trade, the Edinburgh customs returns for 1486&#150;7 showing that he exported salt. In response to a plea for assistance from King Hans of Denmark, James IV attempted a naval expedition in 1502, for which Seton offered his ship, the <i>Eagle</i>. The royal treasury paid him an advance of &pound;400 to have the ship ready for sea by 8 May 1502, but work on it was still going on at Inverkeithing when the king came to check on progress on 27 May. On 9 September the lords of council censured Seton for defaulting on his commitment, and he was ordered to repay the king's outlay on the ship, amounting to &pound;1853 13<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>., and to forfeit the <i>Eagle</i>. A final settlement, agreed on 17 September, allowed for the restoration of the ship to Seton in return for payment of &pound;952. Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington, in his history of the Seton family, describes the second lord as well educated and an accomplished musician, and draws a flamboyant character sketch of him. He certainly employed a minstrel, whom he sent to entertain the king in 1502 during strained relations over the preparation of the <i>Eagle</i>, but Maitland none the less censures Seton for having been overly given to the pursuit of pleasure and bad company. He died between June 1507 and April 1508, and was buried in Seton church, originally parochial, but erected into a college by papal sanction granted on 22 December 1492 in response to Lord Seton's petition. By 23 April 1475 Seton had married Marion, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4481/', "Colin Campbell, first earl of Argyll")</script>, and they had a son, George, subsequently third Lord Seton.<br>
