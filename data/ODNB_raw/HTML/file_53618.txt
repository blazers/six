<span class="headword">Carleton,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1735&#150;1817), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial governor</span>, was born in Ireland, the youngest son of Christopher Carleton of Newry, co. Down, and Catherine, daughter of Henry Ball of co. Donegal. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4674/', "Guy Carleton, first Baron Dorchester (1724&#150;1808)")</script>. Following his childhood in Ireland, Thomas Carleton joined the 20th foot in 1753, achieving the rank of lieutenant and adjutant by early 1756, and that of captain on 27 August 1759, after considerable service in Europe during the Seven Years' War. He continued his military career after the peace. Several leaves of absence allowed him to tour throughout Europe and, at times, to observe other armies in combat, such as the Russians in 1774 then battling &#145;with the Turks on the Lower Danube&#146;  (&#145;Statement of the services of General T. Carleton&#146;, 8 Feb 1810, Carleton collection).<br>
<br>The outbreak of the American War of Independence brought Carleton, now a lieutenant-colonel in the 29th foot, to his brother's side in Quebec, where Guy Carleton was governor, to serve as quartermaster-general to the British forces stationed there. Like his brother, Thomas became increasingly critical of Lord North's handling of the war effort, commenting at one point: &#145;this letter contains the worst kind of Treason against the Minister so I shant put my name to it&#146;  (Carleton to Lord Shelburne, 23 Oct 1779, Carleton collection). Although Carleton's patron Lord Shelburne later slipped from power, Thomas was fortunate enough to be offered, after two others had declined the office, appointment as governor of the newly created colony of New Brunswick. He took the oaths of office on 28 July 1784 and with his wife, Hannah Foy (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Van Horn), whom he had married in London on 2 May 1783, reached his temporary capital Parrtown, soon to be renamed St John, in November 1784. Carleton had achieved colonel's rank on 20 November 1782 and journeyed to New Brunswick with two major assumptions: that his military responsibilities would continue, since the war office promised two regiments would be stationed in New Brunswick, and that his New Brunswick appointment would be a stepping-stone to higher colonial office in Quebec. He was to be disappointed on both counts.<br>
<br>During the colony's first year Carleton governed by prerogative, choosing not to call any elected assembly. The governor and the appointed council, almost entirely loyalist in composition, made Fredericton, well up the St John River, the capital, dispensed land and offices, incorporated St John as a city, established the colony's boundaries to protect against American claims, and in general carefully oversaw every aspect of the colony's development. The creation of a deferential, well-ordered society, dominated by a landed gentry and without the &#145;American spirit of innovation&#146; was the goal, along with the &#145;strengthening [of] the executive powers of Government [to] discountenance its leaning so much on the popular part of the Constitution&#146;  (25 June 1785, National Archives of Canada, M.G. 11, N.B. Ser. A, 2/132&#150;7). Officials in England as well as rank-and-file loyalists in New Brunswick had reservations about some of Carleton's decisions and inclinations.<br>
<br>In St John the first election in November 1785, finally called to choose an assembly, was marked by riots and strong opposition to the governor's party, but Carleton and the loyalist &eacute;lite prevailed. Recounts, arrests, and military intervention produced loyalist &eacute;lite domination of the assembly until the 1790s, when an even stronger opposition to the Carleton regime emerged. Meanwhile, the French menace forced considerable focus on the defences of Britain's remaining North American colonies. In the maritimes it was the senior colony of Nova Scotia that attracted most of London's attention. Carleton witnessed the loss of both regiments within his colony. The culmination of New Brunswick's military neglect came in September 1799 when Prince Edward, duke of Kent and Strathearn, assumed command of the forces in British North America with headquarters in Halifax. Somewhat softening these blows but by no means removing Carleton's military frustrations, he had been granted a major-general's rank on 12 October 1793 as well as an appointment as colonel commandant of a battalion of the 60th foot in August 1794.<br>
<br>Despite his promotions Carleton remained disappointed with his shrinking military responsibilities and found his efforts as governor increasingly disconcerting and burdensome. While counties were established and substantial portions of New Brunswick were settled and developed by the loyalist newcomers and old settlers (pre-loyalists and Acadians), the political, social, and economic blueprint applied by Carleton and his supportive loyalist leaders came under heavy fire in the 1790s. A second assembly, elected in 1793, challenged the authority and decisions of the lieutenant-governor, his title as of 1786, and his appointed council. The confrontation resulted in deadlock and government ground to a halt from 1795 to 1799. Measures passed by the assembly were routinely turned back by the lieutenant-governor and council while legislation initiated at the upper levels of government suffered the same fate in the assembly. Hints from the British government concerning the need to compromise, along with divisions in the opposition faction led by James Glenie, eventually achieved concessions from both sides. Normal government resumed although assembly rights and privileges had been successfully asserted at the expense of executive authority.<br>
<br>Carleton did not believe that &#145;to reign is worth ambition tho' in Hell&#146;  (Raymond, <span class="italic">Winslow Papers</span>, Carleton to Edward Winslow, 3 Jan 1805, 530). Capitalizing upon a temporary peace between France and England, in June 1802 he requested and was granted a leave of absence to return to England. Early in October 1803, accompanied by his wife, son William, daughters Emma and Anne, and stepson Captain Nathaniel Foy, Carleton sailed for England. He never returned to New Brunswick. Carleton tried to keep informed about his colony's needs but his advice was frequently ignored, and he became increasingly aware of &#145;the little prospect of being able to draw the attention of Ministers towards our part of the world&#146;  (ibid., 6 July 1804, 516). At the same time, his family was quickly seduced by residence at Ramsgate, winter visits to Bath, periods with Lord Dorchester at Stubbings House, near Maidenhead, and sojourns in London. Although several times pressed to return to his colonial post, Carleton declined and was allowed to continue as absentee governor until his death on 2 February 1817. He was buried beside his brother in St Swithin's Church at Nately Scures, near Basingstoke.<br>
<br>Thomas Carleton's career has been overshadowed by the exploits of his brother Guy. The younger Carleton's administration of the governorship of New Brunswick also suffers in historical studies which assume that the newly arrived members of the loyalist &eacute;lite shaped and directed the infant colony with the governor merely following their lead. But Thomas Carleton achieved at least some of the loyalists' aims and, while present in New Brunswick, actively directed its development. He &#145;deserves to be acknowledged as the key figure among the founding fathers of New Brunswick&#146;  (<span class="italic">DCB</span>) although his governorship after 1803 was largely ineffective and inactive.<br>
