<span class="headword">Ventris, Sir  Peyton</span>  (1645&#150;1691), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was born in November 1645, the first surviving son of Edward Ventris (<i>d</i>. 1649) of the manor of Granhams in Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire, and of Mary, daughter of Sir John Brewse of Little Wenham, Suffolk, where Ventris was born. His father, a barrister of the Middle Temple, took no part in the civil war though he did profit from it, as he purchased his manor in 1646 from a compounding royalist. He died in 1649, leaving the bulk of his property to his eldest son, Peyton.<br>
<br>Ventris entered Jesus College, Cambridge, on 4 July 1660 and proceeded, without taking a degree, to the Middle Temple on 3 February 1664. He was called to the bar on 2 June 1671 and kept a chamber in Fleet Street above the Great Gate of the Middle Temple. Ventris enjoyed little success as a pleader. Having begun noting cases while a student, he now turned to reporting for his livelihood. The result was two volumes of reports, principally of arguments in king's bench and common pleas, published posthumously in 1696 and in many editions thereafter owing to their reputation for clarity, comprehensiveness, and accuracy.<br>
<br>Ventris married Margaret, the daughter and coheir of Henry Whiting, a shipowner of Coggeshall, Essex, and of Ipswich. They had five sons and one daughter. Ventris established his family in St Nicholas's parish, Ipswich, where in 1681 he became the town clerk and one of three counsel to the corporation. In July 1684 he lost these offices when his name was omitted from the town's new charter, perhaps owing to accusations that he had countenanced conventicles and because he had defended dissenters in king's bench. Despite apparent royal disfavour, Ventris was made a justice of the peace for Suffolk in 1685. His fortunes improved further when he inherited extensive properties from his father-in-law in 1687.<br>
<br>Ventris came to prominence only after the revolution of 1688. He was chosen to one of Ipswich's seats in the Convention Parliament in January 1689, where he reportedly voted against declaring the throne vacant by virtue of James II's departure from England. In his only recorded parliamentary speech Ventris defended the hereditary royal revenue. Ventris, along with other more prominent lawyers, took the oath as a serjeant-at-law on 2 May 1689. Two days later the king made him a justice of common pleas; a knighthood followed on 31 October 1689.<br>
<br>Like other justices, Ventris was often asked to comment on legal cases heard in the House of Lords and on proposed legislation that would affect the operation of the law. But Ventris's recorded statements, both in court and in parliament, were few and brief compared to those of the more prominent jurists with whom he served. After a long illness Ventris died on 6 April 1691 at his house in Ipswich and was buried in the chancel of St Nicholas's Church, survived by his wife, his mother, five sons, and a daughter. Why Ventris, who had done little to distinguish himself professionally, had been advanced to the bench remains unclear, though his <span class="italic">Reports</span> endure as among the most important written during the Restoration.<br>
