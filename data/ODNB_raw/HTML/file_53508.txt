<span class="headword">Souvestre,  Marie Claire</span>  (1835&#150;1905), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born in Brest on 28 April 1835, the second of three children (all daughters) of (Charles-) Emile Souvestre (1806&#150;1854) and his second wife, Ang&eacute;lique-Anne (Nanine) Papot (1806&#150;1886). The father was the prolific, Morlaix-born, republican-inclined author who, making his name with <span class="italic">Les derniers bretons</span> (1836) and subsequently settling in Paris, achieved European fame through a plethora of writings of various genres, notably the best-selling <span class="italic">Un philosophe sous les toits</span> (1850). Marie's vivacious mother edited a <span class="italic">Journal des femmes</span> and wrote stories for children under the name Nanine Souvestre.<br>
<br>The sole surviving glimpse of Marie Souvestre's childhood and early life is a visit paid by father and fourteen-year-old daughter to his friend the historian Jules Michelet early in February 1850. At some stage she learned German and English, translating into French <span class="italic">Deux jeunes femmes</span> (1858) by Mme Carlen from the former and <span class="italic">Paul Ferroll</span> (1859), Caroline Clive's best-seller, from the latter.<br>
<br>In 1864, with Caroline Adela&iuml;de Dussaut (1832&#150;1887), a qualified teacher, Souvestre opened a pioneering girls' boarding-school, Les Ruches, at Avon, Fontainebleau, at which forty or so girls from well-to-do non-French families received, in French, a liberal, secular, intellectual, and social education of high quality. The venture was supported by Victor Duruy, the education minister of the day, who foresaw its contribution to the global diffusion of French culture. Caroline Dussaut brought to the enterprise her professional expertise, Marie Souvestre her money, social flair, and acute intellect and the cultural contacts inherited from her father. The two women, who seem previously to have spent some time together in Germany, had been lovers at least since 1862, the fragile Caroline constantly cosseted by her more forceful younger partner. Of the two, Marie was also to reveal herself as by far the more demanding and charismatic teacher.<br>
<br>To learn at Les Ruches came Anna (Bamie) Roosevelt, the favourite sister and later adviser of Theodore Roosevelt; Natalie Clifford Barney; Helen Vacaresco, the Romanian poet; Dorothy Strachey, future author of <span class="italic">Olivia</span>; Beatrice Chamberlain, daughter of Joseph and half-sister of Neville; and the daughters of Stuart Rendel, Charles Kegan Paul, T. H. S. Escott, and Richard Potter&#151;though Beatrice Potter (later Webb), then antipathetic to the Frenchwoman's energetic atheism, declined to follow her sister Rosy. John Morley's sister briefly taught at the school. All fell under the intellectual spell of Marie Souvestre, an excitingly incisive and intuitive teacher of history, politics, and literature and a riveting reader of French poetry.<br>
<br>The English intake to the school stemmed largely from the recruiting talents of, on the one hand, Lady Jane Strachey, and, on the other, Frederic Harrison. Jane Strachey, wintering in Florence in 1870&#150;71, made the acquaintance there of Marie Souvestre, who had closed her school owing to the Prussian advance and, with Caroline, accompanied her friends, the elderly Michelet and his wife, into temporary Italian exile. Ardent friendship and the eventual attendance of Jane's daughters, Elinor and Dorothy, at Les Ruches, ensued. <span class="italic">Olivia</span> (1949) by Dorothy Bussy (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Strachey) is a scarcely fictionalized account of schoolgirl life in Fontainebleau and a posthumous homage from pupil to teacher. With Marie, Dorothy lost her heart and found her mind.<br>
<br>The positivist Harrison had known Souvestre, perhaps through the Paris positivists or the Michelet connection, also since the early 1870s. They met at intervals&#151;she kept him abreast of French politics&#151;and corresponded. He rented holiday quarters at Les Ruches for the summer of 1877, when she introduced him to Fontainebleau society and took him to see the painter Millet at work in Barbizon.<br>
<br>Professional and emotional jealousies between the two teacher&#150;partners, exacerbated by Dussaut's increasing neurotic invalidism, eventually led Marie to abandon Les Ruches to her and, with the support of Lady Jane Strachey and her other English friends, to open, in 1884, Allenswood, a similarly &#145;French&#146; international girls' boarding-school, in a grand house in Albert Road, Wimbledon Park, Surrey&#151;&#145;a very highly esteemed school for girls at high, breezy Wimbledon&#146;, Henry James wrote to his brother in 1900  (L. Edel, <span class="italic">Henry James: the Master</span>, 1972, 83&#150;4). Finance (the fees by 1904 were &pound;54 7<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. a term) and administration were run by the devoted Paolina Sama&iuml;a, who had followed Marie from Les Ruches&#151;and who perhaps supplanted Caroline.<br>
<br>Isabel Fry, Helen Gifford, and Dorothy Bussy taught at Allenswood, as did Lloyd George's lover, later his secretary and eventual wife, Frances Stevenson. Among the pupils were Pernel and Marjorie Strachey, Marjorie North (Mack) (whose <span class="italic">The Educated Pin</span> of 1944 contains a long account of Souvestre at Allenswood), Helen Gifford, Hester Ritchie, Olive Harrison, Megan Lloyd George, and Marie's most famous favourite, Eleanor Roosevelt. Roosevelt's autobiography <span class="italic">This is my Story</span> lengthily describes her debt to and affection for the inspirational teacher, who took her travelling in Europe, and with whom she corresponded to the last&#151;and from whom, in addition, she may have indirectly learned her lesbian proclivities. She described Marie in her sixties: &#145;beautiful, with clear-cut, strong features, a very strong face and broad forehead &hellip; her eyes looked through you and she always knew more than she was told&#146;  (Roosevelt, 58). The young Lytton Strachey, too, who met her in the role of family friend, was in part her intellectual creature: a number of his views&#151;on religion, education, and French literature&#151;were coloured by her ideas. This is particularly true of his receptivity to the dramatic poetry of Racine&#151;Marie's readings were renowned&#151;of whom he was the first authentically insightful English critic in the modern sense. Marie thus stands at the source of modern English Racine criticism.<br>
<br>In London, Souvestre became intimate, as well as with the Harrisons and Stracheys, with Leslie Stephen, the Morleys, the Chamberlains, Mrs J. R. Green, and a wider circle of radicals and freethinkers, including the young Beatrice Webb. A convinced humanist, candidly pro-Boer, anti-imperialist, and anti-clerical&#151;though she also frequented and liked the Mandell Creightons&#151;she impressed with her intellect and charmed with her personality.<br>
<br>Souvestre died, unmarried, aged sixty-nine, of liver cancer, at Allenswood School on 30 March 1905, having named Paolina Sama&iuml;a her executor, and was buried, alongside her parents, in the P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery, Paris, on 5 April, beside Balzac and close, as she had been in life, to Michelet. Funeral orations were given by her friends Pastor Charles Wagner and Alexandre Ribot, a former <i>pr&eacute;sident du conseil</i>. &#145;A brilliant woman&#146;, wrote Webb in her diary for 31 March, &#145;handsome, warm-hearted&#151;the very soul of veracity&#151;and keen-witted; she must have counted for much in the lives of many women coming from the best of the governing class in England, America, France and Germany&#146;  (Webb, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2.340&#150;41). Allenswood School continued, under Mlle Sama&iuml;a, then different proprietor&#150;heads, at least until 1948.<br>
