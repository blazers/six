<span class="headword">Stewart,  Archibald</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1584), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the second son of Sir James Stewart of Beath and nephew of Henry Stewart, Lord Methven, the third husband of Margaret Tudor, widow of James IV. He acquired lands in Newton feued by his elder brother James as commendator of Inchcolm Priory in 1564 and was granted a pension of &pound;40 in July of the same year. He was a friend of John Knox and a &#145;familiar servant&#146; of James Stewart, earl of Moray, through whose influence as regent he was made a burgess and guild of Edinburgh <i>gratis</i> in September 1569. A year later he was described by Thomas Randolph, the English ambassador and agent, as an &#145;old acquaintance&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1569&#150;71</i>, no. 489). Through Randolph, Stewart had various personal cases pressed with Sir William Cecil and the earl of Leicester during the Marian civil war of 1568&#150;73. Stewart married Helen Acheson (<i>d</i>. 1585), widow of William Birnie, the wealthiest Edinburgh merchant of his generation, shortly after Birnie's death in 1569. Most of the &pound;29,064 Scots that Birnie left was in merchandise; a substantial amount of it lay in Dieppe. Birnie had also been a client of Regent Moray, whose government had given him and his partner, Alexander Clark, permission to strip the lead from the roof of Elgin Cathedral in 1568.<br>
<br>Stewart's marriage brought him severe difficulties as well as new-found wealth. A nominal supporter of the king's party in the civil war, Stewart found that the assets of himself, his new wife, and her husband's old business partner in France were seized through the intervention of the Marian agent Sebastian Danelour. From at least September 1569 Stewart played a double game in order to have his goods restored to him. As well as lobbying Cecil and Leicester through Moray, he became an intermediary between William Maitland of Lethington and Queen Mary, held at Tutbury; he was recommended as her &#145;affectionate servant&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1569&#150;71</i>, 2, no. 1142). By these means he hoped to cultivate the duke of Norfolk to press his and Clark's case. His goods were eventually released in November 1570, with a hint that more might be done for him if his &#145;sincerity&#146; to the Marian cause was further demonstrated. Three months later, Stewart, his wife, and Clark agreed to lend money to Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange, who held Edinburgh Castle for the exiled queen, with part of the royal jewels as security. In June 1573, after the fall of the castle, all three were ordered to appear before the privy council, which since 1571 had included Stewart's elder brother, together with the jewels in their keeping.<br>
<br>In public, however, Stewart and his wife, like Clark, had remained staunch supporters of the king's men. Hers was one of the houses of king's supporters demolished by the Marians in May 1572. Stewart was a member of the loyalist Edinburgh town council, which with Patrick, Lord Lindsay of the Byres, as provost, regained control of the capital in July 1572 after a year in exile. He visited John Knox, who had recently returned from his own exile in St Andrews, shortly before Knox's death in November 1572. Some of the loan to Grange was never repaid: Helen Acheson was still owed &pound;758 when she died in 1585, leaving a net &pound;10,496 Scots. Stewart served continuously on the council from 1572 to 1575, once as a bailie, and was an elder on the kirk session in 1574&#150;5.<br>
<br>In the second half of the 1570s Edinburgh politics, like those of the royal court and privy council, became polarized into pro- and anti-Morton factions. Stewart and Clark went their different ways. Like many other merchants Stewart became alienated by Morton's financial exactions. But the key factor in his allegiances was kinship. The period after Morton's dismissal as regent in April 1578 saw a widespread restoration of Stewart influence. Archibald Stewart was appointed provost of Edinburgh, a central figure in an anti-Morton administration in the capital, replacing Morton's kinsman George Douglas of Parkhead. He survived an attempt by Morton to displace him five months later, when the former regent regained power, and he remained provost until the autumn of 1579, which coincided with the rise to power of another Stewart, the king's cousin Esm&eacute;. He continued on the town council for a further year but after that slipped out of active politics. His brother was created Lord Doune on 24 November 1581 because he was, as the young King James said, &#145;of our blood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>, 3.188); in January 1581 his nephew, also James, had become earl of Moray through his marriage to the daughter of the murdered regent.<br>
<br>Despite his losses during the civil war Archibald Stewart continued to enjoy prosperity. He acted as surety in August 1581 for a dowry of 8000 merks arranged in the marriage contract between his elder brother's eldest daughter, Mary, and Sir John Weymss. Taxed at three times the merchant average in assessments of 1581 and 1583, Stewart left a net &pound;4128 Scots when he died, childless, in autumn 1584. He was buried, unusually, in St Anthony's aisle in St Giles's, Edinburgh, &#145;in respect of the honour and dignitie sumtyme borne&#146; by him  (Marwick, 1573&#150;89, 348). Six months later, in March 1585, the town council agreed that his wife should be buried alongside him.<br>
