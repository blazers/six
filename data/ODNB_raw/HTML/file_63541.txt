<span class="headword">Weston,  Charles</span>  (1731/2&#150;1809), <span class="occ">merchant and philanthropist</span>, was born in Calcutta, the son of William Weston, register (chief clerk) of the mayor's court, Calcutta, until the mid-1740s. His mother was possibly Mrs Mary Ballantine, who married a William Weston in October 1731. Weston spent his life in or near Calcutta. As a youth he was apprenticed to the surgeon John Zachariah Holwell (1711&#150;1798), later a member of the council at Fort William, Calcutta, in whose service he was when Siraj ud-Daula attacked the fort in 1756. Weston escaped imprisonment in the Black Hole, since he was on the River Hooghly looking after Holwell's baggage boats when the fort fell. He was listed among the European sufferers who received compensation in 1759 for financial loss.<br>
<br>Holwell helped Weston with capital to start his career, a debt returned when Weston supported Holwell in his old age and left bequests to his grandchildren. Weston built his fortune through commerce, judicious purchase of Calcutta property, and the provision of mortgages. As determined in business as he was compassionate in private life, he pursued his interests through the civil court in the 1760s, and in 1778 foreclosed on the Revd J. Z. Kiernander, the founder of the Old Mission Church, Calcutta, with which Weston and his family had a close association. But, when Kiernander's house was put up for public auction, Weston used his son-in-law, Philip Leal, to buy the house back for himself. In that year Weston was among a group of Calcutta merchants and agents who asked for, and received, naval protection of their trade returning from China and the Malay coast at the start of war with France. By then he owned several Calcutta properties and held mortgages on others. His wealth was much augmented when, also in 1778, he drew the first prize in the Calcutta lottery, Tiretta's Bazar, which stood opposite the site of his childhood home, worth Rs 196,000 with a monthly income of Rs 3500.<br>
<br>As a prominent Calcutta citizen, Weston served, despite his being Eurasian, on the jury which tried the notorious case of Maharaja Nandakumar in 1775. He acted too as parish clerk to St John's, Calcutta. His charitable work among the poor of Calcutta during his lifetime was munificent. He is said to have distributed each month 100 gold <i>mohurs</i> (approximately &pound;150 at contemporary value) to the poor, and provided many with pensions. At his death this charitable work was crowned by his trust of Rs 100,000 to be administered by St John's vestry for those whom Weston had supported in his lifetime and for the general relief of poverty.<br>
<br>On 9 November 1758 Weston married Amelia de Rozario (1736?&#150;1774&times;7), and, after her death, Constantia (<i>b</i>. 1735/6, <i>d</i>. in or before 1801). Of his nine known children, only his eldest son Charles, who was mentally and physically handicapped, survived him. Portraits of Weston in old age depict him as slender and of medium height, well but simply dressed, dark of hair and countenance, with an air of dignity, sagacity, and kindliness.<br>
<br>When Charles Weston died, at Chinsura on 25 December 1809, he owned four houses and considerable personal effects, including a gold snuff-box which bore a portrait of his patron Holwell. A large library attested to his erudition, and two pianos and scores&#151;bequeathed to granddaughters&#151;to his musical interests. Many legacies, large and small, went to relatives and friends. Rs 230,000 remained in bonds from those to whom he had lent money in his life with little expectation of repayment. He was buried on 25 December at South Park Street cemetery, Calcutta, after a lifetime &#145;of benevolence and charity, seldom equalled, and never yet exceeded in British India&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bengal Obituary</span>, 94). Weston's personality and generosity with his wealth overcame the prejudice which existed against those of mixed parentage in the European community. He was indeed &#145;a striking and existing example, that chaste and refined sentiments are not confined to complexion and climate&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
