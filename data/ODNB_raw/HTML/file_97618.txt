<span class="headword">Reger <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Phillips]</span>,  (Esther) Janet</span>  (1935&#150;2005), <span class="occ">lingerie designer</span>, was born in Jubilee Street, London, on 30 September 1935, the eldest daughter of Hyman Phillips, textile manufacturer, and his wife, Ray, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Levine. Both her parents were the children of Jewish immigrants; her paternal grandfather, Zaida Phillips, from the Ukraine, had established a textile business in London's East End. When the Second World War bombing of London began in 1940 she, with her sister Barbara (<i>b</i>. 1939) and her parents, moved to Reading, where many of her maternal relatives lived. By the time the family had moved to Caversham, north of Reading, she had two more sisters, Gloria (<i>b</i>. 1941) and Sandra (<i>b</i>. 1948). She attended Battle council primary school in Reading, and Kendrick Girls' Grammar School, Reading, where she excelled in art.<br>
<br>As the family textile business declined in the late 1940s Janet Phillips's parents developed a successful sideline making brassi&egrave;res, recycling textile factory offcuts. Realizing the underwear market had potential, her father persuaded Janet to study corsetry and underwear design at Leicester College of Art and Technology. She started the two-year diploma course in September 1951. She specialized in designing co-ordinated sets of lingerie, an innovation at that date, and the set she made for her diploma final gained much publicity in the end-of-year fashion show.<br>
<br>After leaving college in 1953 Janet Phillips worked for several established underwear and swimwear manufacturers, gaining experience and good salaries, but frustrated by the prevailing conservatism of underwear design, and lack of interest in her more adventurous ideas, she travelled to Israel in May 1958 to work on a kibbutz. In her first week there she met a fellow worker, Peter Reger, formerly Adolf Peter Reger (1940&#150;1985), a German chemistry student from Munich, and the two were immediately attracted. By November, when Peter returned to Munich to complete his degree, they had decided to marry, and Janet planned a move to south Germany. In April 1960 she started work in Z&uuml;rich for a lingerie and corsetry firm, and after graduation Peter found employment there also. Their future now looking secure, they married at Reading Synagogue on 1 January 1961. By April she became pregnant, and since her salary was essential she was persuaded by Peter to work from home as a freelance lingerie designer for firms throughout Europe. Her daughter Aliza, her only child, was born in London on 27 December 1961. Back in Z&uuml;rich, Janet's freelance career developed with great success; Peter acted as her agent and secretary, and the couple enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle. However, by the mid-1960s it became difficult for foreign nationals to get Swiss work permits, and in December 1966 the Regers left Z&uuml;rich for London.<br>
<br>Since freelance design work was scarce in Britain the Regers decided to manufacture as well as design garments. Their company, Janet Reger Creations Ltd, was registered in June 1967, Janet working as designer, cutter, and production manager, and Peter as business manager. Deliveries to shops started in August, and immediately the new company was inundated with orders, as Janet Reger's pretty, glamorous lingerie caught the current mood, appealing to young, self-confident, and increasingly affluent women, who found the products of established underwear firms dull and utilitarian. The Regers set up business premises in Southwick Mews, Paddington, with a small staff and outworkers. Reger products were sold to trendy London boutiques as well as department stores, and thanks to enormous media interest the name Janet Reger became widely known. By 1970 the business had expanded into three buildings in Southwick Mews, and Janet had added new lines inspired by Edwardian and 1920s lingerie, and introduced her dragonfly Reger trademark. To meet increasing demand a mail order catalogue was issued, <span class="italic">Bottom Drawer</span>.<br>
<br>The 1970s saw a period of constant expansion, financial success, and unprecedented publicity for Janet Reger Creations, owing to the high profile of customers, including royalty and the wives of pop stars. Needing to expand production, the Regers took over a small factory in Wirksworth, Derbyshire. They moved their London base to Beauchamp Place, Knightsbridge, opening a boutique there, followed by a second shop in Brook Street, to cater for a West End clientele. In 1976 the American market was opened up through sales to Saks, the New York store, and a further London shop opened in New Bond Street in 1978. The hard work involved to ensure this success, however, took its toll on the couple's marriage: Peter suffered from stress and depression and Janet became aware of his frequent extramarital affairs. From then onwards their relationship was soured by rows.<br>
<br>By the end of the 1970s the business was also facing difficulties. The high exchange rate deterred American customers, other lingerie firms were now offering competition, copying Janet's designs in cheaper materials, and the business had overexpanded. In 1982 the Regers signed a contract with the corset manufacturers Berlei, who proposed to market a &#145;Janet Reger collection&#146;, which proved a disastrous decision for the Regers. By the end of 1982 sales of luxury goods generally were in recession, and in January 1983 Janet Reger Creations Ltd went into liquidation. In the sale of the firm's assets Berlei bought the Janet Reger trademark, and attempted to prevent her from trading independently. Discovering that the contract referred to her company rather than to herself, Janet set up a new firm, Designs by Janet Reger, bought back the lease to the shop in Beauchamp Place, re-opening it in April 1983, and business flourished once more, a proof of her considerable entrepreneurial skills. The crisis of the liquidation ended the Regers' marriage, however. In 1984 Peter was bought out of the business, and in October 1985 he committed suicide.<br>
<br>In early 1986 Berlei went into receivership, and Janet bought back her Janet Reger trademark, at enormous cost. She recouped this through licensing deals with firms manufacturing bedlinen, soft furnishings, and accessories under the Janet Reger name, as well as producing a couture lingerie collection. Her daughter Aliza took an increasing role in the business, becoming chief executive in 1998. After developing breast cancer in 1991, which was successfully treated, Janet spent much of her time in Mauritius, where her products were manufactured. She wrote her autobiography, with Shirley Flack, in 1991, because, she said, &#145;my story seems to occupy a special place in the public's imagination&#146;  (<span class="italic">Janet Reger</span>, preface). She continued to be involved in her company until cancer returned and she died in the West Middlesex Hospital, Isleworth, London, on 14 March 2005.<br>
<br>Janet Reger said that she knew her name had become a household word in 1978 when Tom Stoppard included the line &#145;Don't get your Janet Regers in a twist&#146; in his play <span class="italic">Night and Day</span>  (<span class="italic">Janet Reger</span>, 73). Her designs introduced glamour, luxury, and sexiness into underwear at a time when the more liberated attitudes of the 1960s made the erotic acceptable, and by using sensuous fabrics and fine embroidery she turned underwear into &#145;lingerie&#146;, eagerly bought by women and their male partners. Her 1970s designs exactly accorded with the prevailing nostalgia for 1920s and 1930s Hollywood glamour, re-introducing garments such as French knickers, camisoles, and basques, for which an international fashionable clientele paid couture prices. Janet Reger's legacy was the large number of high street firms producing glamorous and erotic lingerie in the twenty-first century, satisfying a market she created.<br>
