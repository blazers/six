<span class="headword">Booker,  John</span>  (1602&#150;1667), <span class="occ">astrologer</span>, was born at Manchester on 23 March 1602 and was later described as being of &#145;good parentage&#146;; his father died on 23 March 1621. He received a sound schooling which gave him a lasting proficiency in Latin, and his writings show that he read widely. He moved to London in August 1616 and the following April was bound apprentice to a haberdasher of small wares in Laurence Lane. However, instead of pursuing that trade he taught for a time as a writing-master at a school in Hadley, near Barnet, Middlesex, and worked as a clerk for the London aldermen Sir Hugh Hammersley and Sir Christopher Clitheroe (both of whom served as mayor). According to William Lilly &#145;he served with great Credit and Estimation; and by that means became not only well known, but as well respected of the most eminent Citizens of London, even to his dying Day&#146;  (Lilly, 27).<br>
<br>Booker was drawn to astrology from an early age, poring over almanacs as a child, and he came to enjoy an extensive astrological practice in London. His friend the parson&#150;astrologer William Bredon, formerly chaplain to Sir Christopher Heydon, may have been his mentor. Booker's casebooks for the years 1648&#150;65, written in shorthand, survive among the Ashmolean manuscripts in the Bodleian Library; they cover roughly 16,500 enquiries from clients who ranged from peers through merchants and artisans to domestic servants. Lilly called him &#145;an excellent Proficient, &hellip; a very honest Man, abhorred any Deceit in the Art he studied; had a curious Fancy in judging of Thefts, and as successful in resolving Love-Questions&#146;  (Lilly, 27&#150;8). His astrological practice flourished right up to his death.<br>
<br>Booker's wider fame rested on the series of almanacs he published annually from 1631 to his death. He used a variety of titles, including <span class="italic">Bowker: a New Almanack</span>, <span class="italic">Mercurius Coelicus</span>, <span class="italic">Uranoscopia</span>, <span class="italic">Celestiall Observations</span>, and, in his final years, <span class="italic">Telescopium Uranicum</span>. In the 1630s he was recognized as the leading astrologer of his day. His fame was secured by a hint in his almanac for September 1632 that Saturn and Jupiter in opposition threatened the death of kings, a &#145;prophecy&#146; seen as fulfilled by the death of the conquering king of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus, two months later. Booker was the most outspoken compiler of the 1630s. In 1632 he complained of pervasive &#145;bribery, oppression, extortion&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Almanack</span>, 1632, sig. C5<i>v</i>), and in 1633 made a provocative prediction of &#145;wonderful change in the church&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Almanack</span>, 1633, sig. C2). As a result he was arrested by the high commission in 1634, gaoled eight weeks in the Gatehouse, fined &pound;500, and suspended from writing. The case prompted an order that henceforth all almanacs must be licensed by the archbishop of Canterbury or bishop of London. Booker did not publish in 1635, and his almanacs for the later 1630s were heavily censored; he later complained that he had been tempted to abandon writing them altogether.<br>
<br>In the 1640s Booker quickly emerged as a militant parliamentarian, and became so famous that his almanacs were pirated and counterfeited. In June 1643 he and the reader of mathematics at Gresham College were appointed by parliament as joint licensers of mathematical books (which included almanacs), a position he retained until 1660. His almanacs predicted the downfall of popery and sweeping reforms in religion, though he criticized separatists and was pained by the rift between Presbyterians and Independents. In 1644 he savaged the king for associating with the bloodthirsty Irish papists who in 1641 had &#145;cut the throats of 200,000 Israelites, I mean Protestants in Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">No Mercurius aquaticus</span>, 1644, 5). His political stance led to fierce quarrels in print with the royalist astrologer George Wharton, whom Booker attacked in <span class="italic">Mercurius Coelius</span> (1644) and who replied with <span class="italic">Mercurio-Coelico-Mastix, or, An anti-caveat to all such, as have (heretofore) had the misfortune to be cheated and deluded by that grand and traiterous impostor of this rebellious age, John Booker</span> (1644), and with the versifier turned royalist propagandist, John Taylor, whom Booker attacked in his vigorous <span class="italic">No Mercurius aquaticus, but a Cable Rope Twisted for John Tayler, the Water-Poet</span> (1644). None the less Booker continued to stand for a limited monarchy and he was shocked by the extremism he found in the first almanac submitted by William Lilly, which he licensed only after insisting on substantial changes. Lilly rapidly overtook him as the leading parliamentary astrologer, but they became friendly colleagues. Booker greatly admired Lilly's <span class="italic">Christian Astrology</span> (1647), and sometimes sought his professional advice. In 1647 they were both invited to the army's headquarters at Windsor, where General Fairfax tried to convince them of the justice of its cause. During the second civil war in 1648 they were summoned to Colchester to encourage the besieging forces with predictions of a speedy triumph, which quickly followed. Booker's importance in shaping public opinion is confirmed by the counterfeit astrological judgement issued in his name in 1649 by his rival Henry Walker, which claimed that the stars indicated the failure of Cromwell's expedition to Ireland.<br>
<br>After the king's execution Booker adopted a more radical political and religious stance. He now damned Presbyterianism as well as prelacy and popery, and predicted in 1651 that monarchy would soon disappear throughout Europe. He interpreted &#145;black Monday&#146;, the solar eclipse of 29 March 1652, as heralding the fall of kings as well as popery. His clients included several radicals, and he wrote a verse lamenting the death of John Lilburne, whose wife was a frequent visitor. During the 1650s Booker's almanacs gave warm support to the Commonwealth and protectorate, with dire warnings to royalists, Scots, Dutch, French, and Spaniards. In his almanac for 1660 he dismissed the failed rising of Sir George Booth as the &#145;gripings and wringings of Antichrist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Telescopium Uranicum</span>, sig. C5). The Restoration, which he had totally failed to anticipate, therefore demanded some nimble footwork. Henceforth Booker heaped praise on Charles II and his generous amnesty and poured fierce invective on the regicides. His political prophecies were now very cautious, and sales dwindled; his fee from the Company of Stationers accordingly halved from &pound;40 to &pound;20. The approach of 1666 rekindled something of his old anti-popery, however, and he prophesied that the year would prove fatal to the popish Antichrist.<br>
<br>Though Booker published little outside the field of astrology, he seems to have had some involvement in both iatrochemistry and natural magic. Lilly described him as very competent in physic, and he sometimes described himself as physician (and mathematician) as well as astrologer. He &#145;was a great Admirer of the Antimonial Cup&#146;, Lilly remarked, and &#145;not unlearned in Chymistry&#146;  (Lilly, 28). He was one of the friends who supplied Elias Ashmole with materials for his <span class="italic">Theatrum chemicum Britannicum</span> (1652). In 1650 he published <span class="italic">The Dutch Fortune-Teller &hellip; Brought into England by John Booker</span>, which set out a system of divination based on letters, words, and numbers and employing dice, &#145;wheels&#146;, and &#145;globes&#146;. Egyptian in origin, it had been carried to Germany by an Ottoman ambassador and translated into German. Booker complained that many treated it merely as a jest; he stopped short of endorsing it, but suggested it might be seen as a form of natural magic, and similar to some of the writings of Dr Robert Fludd. Booker was also &#145;no mean Proficient in Astronomy&#146;  (Lilly, 28), vigorously supporting the system of Tycho Brahe against its Copernican rival. In 1639 he published an updated edition of William Rastall's concordance of years.<br>
<br>Booker married his wife, Joan, in June 1638; they had several children. One daughter, Victoria, born in 1644, was named after the victory at Marston Moor. In 1662 Booker sent an agitated note begging Lilly to help trace his son Samuel, who had run away from home on the eve of being bound apprentice, adding that he had sent another troublesome son (John) to Barbados; &#145;never was any man so vexed with his children&#146;, he complained  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 180, fol. 112). Gadbury's later comment that Booker possessed &#145;a competent share of Choler&#146;  (Gadbury, 181) may provide a clue to his domestic problems. Booker was still living at Hadley, at the house of Francis Atkinson, as late as 1633. By 1646 he had a house in Cree-Church Lane, near Duke's Place; from 1662 he gave his address as near St James's Church in Duke's Place. (The minister of St James's, William Harrison, was a client.) Booker died in Duke's Place on 8 April 1667, after three years of dysentery had &#145;at last consumed him to nothing&#146;  (Lilly, 28). He had also been diabetic. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and two daughters; Joan sold his collection of astrological books to Elias Ashmole for &pound;140, which Lilly thought far more than they were worth. Ashmole, a client and friend since 1646, was the dedicatee of Booker's last almanac, and paid for a marble slab to be placed over his grave in St James's Church. No likeness of Booker is known to exist&#151;perhaps a mercy, for a contemporary jibed that his face would &#145;fright a razor&#146;  (J. B., <span class="italic">A Faire in Spittle Fields</span>, 1652, 7). Lilly, summing up his career, said that he had always &#145;lived an honest Man, his Fame not questioned at his Death&#146;  (Lilly, 28).<br>
