<span class="headword">Elgar <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Craymer]</span>,  Sybil Lillian</span>  (1914&#150;2007), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 10 June 1914 at 88 Tubbs Road, Harlesden, Middlesex, the daughter of Frederick Green Craymer (1892&#150;1939), railway locomotive fireman and later engine driver, and his wife, Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas, who worked in the local Path&eacute; News factory. At some point her family adopted the surname Green-Craymer. She was brought up in Willesden. During the Second World War she was a local government clerk responsible for accommodating evacuees in north London, and trained as a mortician. On 8 June 1940 she married John William Elgar (1914&#150;1994), then a sapper in the Royal Engineers, formerly a railway clerk, and later a surveyor and civil servant. They had one daughter, Jacqueline (Jackie).<br>
<br>After the war Sybil Elgar worked as a school secretary. On deciding to become a teacher she became a student of the Montessori method and owing to lack of financial resources she embarked on a correspondence course to gain her diploma. In 1958, while studying, she went to see the Marlborough Day Hospital for &#145;severely and emotionally disturbed children&#146;. She was horrified by the scene she was confronted with and &#145;could not get out of her mind how soul-destroying the place was and how miserable the children were&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 24 Jan 2007). At the time of the visit children with autism were viewed as being &#145;psychotic&#146; and Leo Kanner's &#145;refrigerator mother&#146; theory was prevalent. Parents, particularly mothers, were thought to be largely responsible for their offspring's difficulties due to a &#145;genuine lack of maternal warmth&#146; and &#145;parental coldness&#146;, and it was widely accepted that children with disabilities should be placed in institutions  (L. Kanner, &#145;Problems of nosology and psychodynamics of early infantile autism&#146;, <span class="italic">Journal of American Orthopsychiatry</span>, 19/3, 1949, 416&#150;26). On visiting the hospital for a second time, in 1960, it was clear to Elgar that nothing had changed. Frustrated, she resolved to provide an alternative.<br>
<br>In 1962 Elgar succeeded in setting up her own school for autistic children in the basement of her home in St John's Wood, London. There she developed a new and innovative way of teaching, allowing her pupils time to internalize what they needed to do, through clear instructions that she would write down or present in pictorial form. In doing so she became one of the first teachers able to see beyond the difficult, often severely challenging or withdrawn behaviour of autistic children to the underlying child, and to act on her belief that every child had the capacity to learn. As word spread, demand from parents grew. In September 1965, with support from the Autistic Children's Aid Society of North London (renamed the National Society for Autistic Children in 1966 and the National Autistic Society in 1975), she was able to open a residential school for children with autism, in Ealing. The school, initially named the Society School for Autistic Children, was the first of its kind in the UK, and, it is thought, the world.<br>
<br>Although Elgar faced some critics who described the project as over-ambitious, the school quickly gained an international reputation as an example of how autistic children should be taught. At first nine children with an age range of five to fourteen years were accommodated within one building, which included a live-in flat for Sybil Elgar and her husband. However, within five years the school grew rapidly and the society was able to purchase three more adjoining houses, with the pupil intake growing to forty. Elgar's work was widely admired and she influenced, for example, Eric Schopler from North Carolina, USA, who came to view her work in 1965 and went on to develop the structured teaching model known as TEACCH (the treatment and education of autistic and related communication-handicapped children), which became part of the essential toolkit for teaching children with autism.<br>
<br>In October 1969 Elgar celebrated a historic moment when an inspection by the Department of Education and Science granted the school formal recognition. The following year a visit from Edward Short, the secretary of state for education, gave further credibility to the pioneering work of Elgar and her team. In 1972 the National Society for Autistic Children marked its tenth anniversary. In the commemorative issue of the society's magazine, <span class="italic">Communication</span>, Elgar stated that &#145;Children need praise and congratulation but most of all they need the opportunity to continue their education and training so that they can maintain and extend educational capabilities, develop social and personal ability and acquire occupational skills&#146; (<span class="italic">Communication</span>, June 1972). This vision was shared by a growing number of educationists and carers, and reflected Elgar's determination to promote the rights of all children and adults with autism to learn and to have that learning facilitated throughout their lives.<br>
<br>Despite celebrating tremendous success within the field of education Elgar was increasingly drawn to a similarly pioneering role for adults with autism. Soon after establishing the school she recognized that while the children improved considerably in their behaviour and awareness they still remained autistic, and if they did not continue to receive appropriate support into adulthood they could easily regress or struggle to cope with daily life. So, after an enormous fundraising effort, in 1974 she founded the first residential service for adults with autism. Still working with the National Society for Autistic Children, she oversaw the purchase of Somerset Court, a large house at Brent Knoll in Somerset. Moving twenty of the older children from the Ealing school, she set about showing how the skills the children had acquired at school could be developed and built on, greatly enhancing their lives as adults as well as their ability to function within society. According to Wendy Brown, the founding head of two later National Autistic Society schools (Helen Allison School and Broomhayes School), it was at Somerset Court that Elgar &#145;showed the effectiveness of a person with autism's functioning within society was based on other factors, including an appropriate education, the fostering of motivation, and a stimulating environment&#146;. She also observed that Elgar &#145;was perhaps also the first person to realise that the language disorder was close to the heart of the condition&#146;  (private information, W. Brown).<br>
<br>Sybil Elgar was appointed MBE in 1975 and retired in 1984, having made a major contribution to the body of expert knowledge, understanding, and experience of autism. She was an inspirational leader who had true determination and tenacity. Her last years were spent in Dawlish, Devon, where her daughter, Jackie, and her family lived. She died at Palm Court Nursing Home, Dawlish, on 8 January 2007, of pneumonia, and was cremated at Exeter crematorium. She was survived by her daughter. The principles of her work continued to inform the education and care of children and adults with autism throughout the UK and the world and she was commemorated by the renaming of her pioneering school as Sybil Elgar School. Each year at the school's graduation ceremony the Sybil Elgar cup is presented for &#145;most progress made&#146;.<br>
