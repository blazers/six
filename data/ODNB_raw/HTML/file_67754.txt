<span class="headword">Millar,  Robert</span>  (1672&#150;1752), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and historian</span>, was the son of the Revd Andrew Millar of Neilston, Renfrewshire. He was educated at Glasgow University and was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Paisley on 3 February 1697. While the minister of Port Glasgow, where he had been ordained on 18 August 1697, he married, on 10 June 1702, Elizabeth Kelso (<i>d</i>. 1759), daughter of John Kelso of Kelsoland in the borders. They had eight surviving children: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18714/', "Andrew Millar")</script>, a London bookseller; John (<i>d</i>. 1738) and Henry (<i>d</i>. 1771), who followed him into the ministry; Anna (<i>d</i>. 1768) and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1798), who both married Paisley ministers, one of whom, James Hamilton, was his successor; Archibald (<i>d</i>. 1766), a naval officer; Robert, a physician who went abroad; and William, who practised medicine in Antigua and later acquired the Walkinshaw estate near Paisley. On 28 December 1709 Millar moved to the first charge at Paisley where he ministered for the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In 1723 Millar published at Edinburgh his major work, <span class="italic">The History of the Propagation of Christianity, and Overthrow of Paganism</span>, two large volumes dedicated to the earl of Dundonald, Lord Cochran of Paisley, and William, Lord Ross. The widespread support that Millar's book engendered among clergy and laymen in the Church of Scotland is indicated by the impressive list of nearly 500 subscribers prefixed to the first edition, including several university principals and many professors. From a foundation in Christian apologetics directed against the English deists, the work develops into a global history of evangelism that displays considerable learning and commitment. As stated in the preface the four components in the author's design are to stimulate thankfulness to God for delivering Christians from &#145;miserable Darkness and Idolatry&#146;; to trace the history of the propagation of Christianity by divine providence &#145;down to the present time&#146;; to move readers to pity the heathens &#145;who make up so great a Part of the World&#146;; and to incite Christians with missionary &#145;Fervour and Zeal&#146;. In sending a copy of the book to Cotton Mather of Boston, from whose work on American missions Millar is said to have borrowed &#145;almost verbatim&#146;  (De Jong, 114), the church historian Robert Wodrow asserted, in a letter of 29 July 1724, that Millar &#145;is a serious, diligent, and laborious minister, and his book will show his acquaintance with learning, in most of its valuable branches&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of the Rev. Robert Wodrow</span>, 3.154). A second edition was published in London in 1726, and a third by the author's son Andrew in 1731, in addition to a Dutch translation. It was enormously influential among Scottish missionaries and has been called one of the formative influences in the eighteenth century by a leading historian of Scottish revivalism  (Fawcett, 215).<br>
<br>In 1730 Millar published in Edinburgh, also by subscription, his second major work, <span class="italic">The history of the church under the Old Testament &hellip; to which is subjoined, a discourse to promote the conversion of the Jews to Christianity</span>, which may be seen as an extension of his earlier history of Christian conversion among pagans. Although no publisher is named on the title page, an advertisement for the book that appears at the end of the third edition of <span class="italic">The History of the Propagation of Christianity</span> states that it was &#145;Printed for A. Millar&#146;. Robert Millar published nothing else before his death on 16 December 1752. In 1782 two pamphlets based on his <span class="italic">History of the Church</span> appeared in Edinburgh under his name, one on the life of Herod and the other (which was reprinted in Glasgow in 1786) on the history of the Jews from the death of Herod to the destruction of Jerusalem. In 1789 <span class="italic">The Whole Works of the Reverend Robert Millar</span> was published in Paisley in eight octavo volumes.<br>
