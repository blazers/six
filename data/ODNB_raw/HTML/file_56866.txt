<span class="headword">Gore,  Spencer Frederick</span>  (1878&#150;1914), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born on 26 May 1878 at Epsom, Surrey, the third of four children of Spencer William Gore (<i>d</i>. 1908), a partner in Smiths Gore, agents to the ecclesiastical commissioners, and holder of the first lawn tennis championship at Wimbledon (1877), and his wife, Amy Margaret Smith. The family lived at Holywell in Kent. Freddy&#151;as he was known&#151;was sent, like his elder brother, to Harrow School (1892&#150;6). There he displayed some of his inherited sporting prowess, keeping wicket for the second eleven and winning the Harrow mile. He grew very tall (throughout his life his trousers always hung awkwardly). He also developed his interest in art, winning the drawing prize. After leaving Harrow he attended the Slade School of Fine Art, London (1896&#150;9), studying under Frederick Brown, Henry Tonks, and Philip Wilson Steer, and learning much from their brand of English impressionism. His friends included Harold Gilman, Albert Rothenstein (later Rutherston), Augustus John, and Wyndham Lewis.<br>
<br>With Lewis, Gore visited Madrid in 1902, partly to study the work of Goya. In the summer of 1904, on a painting trip in Normandy, he visited Walter Sickert, who was living in a self-imposed exile at Dieppe. The meeting was propitious. Sickert, then in his mid-forties, was inspired by Gore's account of the rising generation of Slade students and returned to England after an absence of some seven years. And Gore was excited to come into contact with a painter who was so intimately connected with the artistic traditions of French impressionism.<br>
<br>From Sickert himself Gore learned the practice of painting in the studio from small, well-documented drawings done from life. Although Gore continued to paint landscapes <i>en plein air</i>, Sickert's technique (learned from his friend and mentor Degas) was useful for the complex theatrical subjects he was beginning to attempt. Gore shared Sickert's love of the theatre and the music-hall (he was himself an excellent and enthusiastic amateur performer, specializing in comic policemen and irate Victorian fathers). At about this time he also came into contact with Lucien Pissarro, and from him he learned more directly of the techniques of French impressionist painting, as espoused by Camille Pissarro (Lucien's father). Gore began to adopt such techniques, eschewing black and building up his pictures with dry touches of unmediated colour on a white ground.<br>
<br>In 1906 Gore's father deserted the family after his business failed. Gore was urged by his uncle&#151;the bishop of Oxford&#151;to give up painting. He stood firm, however, and henceforth strove to earn his living with his brush. His mother, granted a pension by the firm, moved to Garth House, Hertingfordbury, Hertfordshire. (Gore, alone of his family, continued to keep in contact with his disgraced father, who died two years later.) Although Gore spent his summers painting the country (at Billy in France, in Yorkshire, at Hertingfordbury, and at Applehayes in Somerset), following Sickert's lead he gravitated to the Camden Town area of London. He had rooms at 15 Granby Street, and often shared Sickert's studio at 6 Mornington Crescent.<br>
<br>Although an occasional exhibitor with the New English Art Club (he was even elected as a member in 1909), Gore&#151;like many of his generation&#151;felt out of sympathy with its increasingly conservative stance. As a result he became involved in a series of initiatives to promote the claims of more progressive art. Together with Sickert, Gilman, and a few others he founded the Fitzroy Street Group, renting a first-floor room at 19 Fitzroy Street, where members' pictures were exhibited and tea was served to prospective clients every Saturday. And in 1908 Gore and Gilman assisted the critic Frank Rutter in the setting up of the Allied Artists' Association, a non-jury society, modelled on the Salon des Ind&eacute;pendents, which held annual exhibitions at the Royal Albert Hall. In 1911 Gore was elected as the first president of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64739/', "Camden Town Group")</script>, the alliance which evolved out of the Fitzroy Street Group. In March of the same year he had his first&#151;and only&#151;one-man show at the Chenil Gallery, London.<br>
<br>Artistically Gore had begun to move beyond impressionism, towards a post-impressionist style founded, in part, on the examples of Gauguin and (subsequently) Derain. The impact of Roger Fry's ground-breaking &#145;Post-impressionist exhibition&#146; (1910) and of the Gauguin exhibition at the Stafford Gallery (1911) became increasingly marked in Gore's paintings, with their flat colours and strongly marked contours. Gore's position as, perhaps, the leading British exponent of the new style was confirmed when several of his pictures&#151;including <span class="italic">The Cinder Path</span> (Tate collection) and <span class="italic">Letchworth Station</span> (National Railway Museum, York)&#151;were selected for the English section of the &#145;Second post-impressionist exhibition&#146; (1912). He also organized the group of artists (Gilman, Charles Ginner, Lewis, Jacob Epstein, and Eric Gill) who decorated the Cave of the Golden Calf, the nightclub set up by Madame Strindberg (widow of the playwright). On account of his personality and his talent Gore was recognized as a leader by his contemporaries. He sought&#151;and very nearly managed&#151;to bring together all the progressive strains of British art under a single banner, in the exhibition he curated at Brighton, and in the London Group which was established in 1912 (and had its first exhibition in 1913). In the event the difficulty of reconciling Roger Fry with Wyndham Lewis proved too much, though characteristically both men maintained their affection for, and admiration of, Gore.<br>
<br>On 19 February 1912 Gore married Mary Johanna 
    (Molly; 1889&#150;1968)
  , daughter of John Kerr. (Sickert was best man.) A daughter, Elizabeth, was born that October, at Letchworth, where Gore had rented Gilman's house. The young family subsequently moved to 6 Cambrian Road, Richmond, where a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101743/', "Frederick John Pym Gore (1913&#150;2009)")</script> also a painter, was born. Gore's paintings of Richmond show a new stylistic departure, inspired by his study of C&eacute;zanne. It was while painting in the park in the early months of 1914 that Gore contracted a cold which developed into pneumonia. He died at home on 25 March 1914 and was buried in Hertingfordbury. His death called forth numerous tributes, from artists as diverse as Sickert and Lewis. All regarded Gore as a rare talent and a rare friend. His quiet good humour, his eager enthusiasms, his unstinting kindness, and his rare common sense endeared him to a whole generation of artists.<br>
