<span class="headword">Homer,  Henry Sacheverell</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1719, <em>d.</em> 1791), <span class="occ">writer</span>, son of Edward Homer, of Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, and godson of Henry Sacheverell, from whom he received his Christian name, was baptized in Sutton Coldfield on 19 November 1719, and educated at Oxford, where he matriculated on 26 June 1736 as a member of University College. He became a demy of Magdalen College in 1737, and graduated BA in 1740, MA in 1743. On 11 February 1751 he married Susannah Pitts (<i>d</i>. in or after 1806) at Birdingbury. He was appointed rector of Birdingbury, Warwickshire, and vicar of Willoughby in 1764; and chaplain to Edward, Lord Leigh, high steward of the University of Oxford. From 1774 to 1779 he also held the vicarage of Anstey, Warwickshire.<br>
<br>While Homer was a clergyman, he was also a Warwickshire commissioner of enclosure. His name &#145;appears in Acts for at least twenty enclosures in surrounding counties alone&#146;  (Beresford, 131) and he dedicated his <span class="italic">Essay on the nature and method of ascertaining the specific shares of proprietors upon the inclosure of common fields</span> (1766) to his fellow commissioners. According to J. A. Yelling, Homer's work on enclosure &#145;gives perhaps the most detailed view of the procedure from the commissioners' point of view&#146;  (Yelling, 135). Homer's other major work, <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Means of Preserving and Improving the Publick Roads of this Kingdom</span> (1767), examines the importance of inland navigation to the British economy. Its anonymous reviewer in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> called it &#145;a masterpiece of its kind&#146;  (1767, 403). Homer also wrote in 1788 a memoir of the archdeacon of Richmond, Thomas Townson, which later appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1792 (587&#150;8).<br>
<br>Homer died on 14 July 1791 &#145;suddenly, as he was returning from his hay-field&#146;, and was buried in the family tomb &#145;near the east end of the church at Birdingbury&#146; (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1791, 685; 1806, 1209). His seventeen children included <a href="#cosubject_13650">Arthur [<i>see below</i>]</a>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13652/', "Henry Homer")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13653/', "Philip Bracebridge Homer")</script>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_13650"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Homer</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1758, <em>d.</em> 1806)<span class="occ"></span>, the fourth son of Henry Sacheverell Homer and his wife, Susannah Pitts, was baptized at Birdingbury, Warwickshire, on 9 August 1758, and educated at Rugby School and at Magdalen College, Oxford. He graduated BA (1778), proceeded MA (1781), BD (1790), and DD (1797); from 1782 to 1802 he was a probationary fellow of Magdalen. In 1802 the college presented him to the rectory of Standlake, Oxfordshire, where he died on 4 June 1806. There is a monument to his memory, with an inscription supposed to have been written by Samuel Parr, on the south wall of the chancel of Standlake church. In 1799 Homer published a proposal and prospectus, <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Universalis Americana, or, An Universal American Library</span>, a work that was to consist of &#145;two quarto volumes &hellip; and to be dedicated to Gen. Washington&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1806, 1208). The proposal was revised twice (in 1800 and 1801) but in 1803 Homer issued a printed letter to his prospective subscribers announcing that he had suspended work on the project indefinitely. His work never did appear in print, though Leman Thomas Rede's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Americana</span> (1789) was later thought to be the first volume of it and misattributed to Homer.<br>
