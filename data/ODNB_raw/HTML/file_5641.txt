<span class="headword">Clifford,  Anne</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Lady Anne Clifford]</span>, countess of Pembroke, Dorset, and Montgomery  (1590&#150;1676), <span class="occ">noblewoman and diarist</span>, was born at Skipton Castle in Craven in the West Riding of Yorkshire on 30 January 1590, the only surviving child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5645/', "George Clifford, third earl of Cumberland (1558&#150;1605)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Margaret (1560&#150;1616) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5655/', "Clifford, Margaret, countess of Cumberland")</script>], youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24306/', "Francis Russell, second earl of Bedford")</script>. She was brought up in her father's houses at the Charterhouse and in Clerkenwell and at the homes of her mother's Russell relatives, Chenies in Buckinghamshire and North Hall in Hertfordshire. She was educated by her mother and her Russell relatives, all intellectually gifted, her governess Anne Taylor, and until 1602 her tutor, the author Samuel Daniel. The composer Jack (John) Jenkins taught her to play the lute in 1603. She had a dancing master, Stephen, and performed in masques at James I's court.<br>
<br>Lady Anne's mother was her mentor and remained her exemplar. She and Daniel in particular inspired in their pupil a love of literature, history, the classics, and religious works and fostered her precocious autodidactism and critical bent. To them she owed her piety and biblical knowledge, though she eschewed their puritan convictions. Reading (more often being read to) was for her a lifelong pleasure and a solace in periods of trouble and depression. Having inherited her mother's library, she built up, to quote her officer George Sedgewick, &#145;a library stored with very choice books, which she read over, not cursorily, but with judgement and observation&#146;. Her breadth of knowledge surprised John Donne, who remarked that &#145;she knew well how to discourse of all things, from predestination to slea-silk&#146;. Bishop Edward Rainbow attests that her conversation could be not only &#145;useful and grave, but also pleasant and delightful&#146;  (Spence, <span class="italic">Lady Anne Clifford</span>, 189&#150;90, 14, 223).<br>
<br>Lady Anne's life was dominated by the great inheritance dispute caused when her father in 1605 bequeathed his estates (for financial reasons) to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67095/', "Francis Clifford, fourth earl of Cumberland")</script>, leaving her instead a &pound;15,000 portion. Countess Margaret, as her guardian, initiated claims on Anne's behalf to both the Cliffords' baronial titles, which the earl marshal's court refused in 1606, and the estates. Her archival researches demolished Earl Francis's case for all the estates in the court of wards in 1607, the judges deciding the Skipton properties (though not the other Craven manors) were rightfully Anne's, although her uncle kept possession.<br>
<br>Lady Anne married, on 25 February 1609, Richard Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, third earl of Dorset (1589&#150;1624), with whom she had three short-lived sons and two daughters, Margaret and Isabella. From 1612 her husband Dorset took charge of her lawsuits, complicating the issues because he stood out for the maximum gain, but in 1615 the court of common pleas decided that he and Anne could have the Skipton and Westmorland estates or the portion, but not both. After her mother's death in May 1616 Anne was isolated, refusing to yield her claim on all the estates despite unpleasantness from Dorset and incessant pressure from James I's courtiers. She suffered a period of ill health and withdrawal. Worse followed when she refused to accept the king's award in February 1617 which settled the dispute by giving all the estates to Earl Francis and his male heirs and &pound;17,000 in compensation to Dorset and Anne, which her husband then pocketed.<br>
<br>Countess Anne's marriage had been deeply scarred by the bitter quarrels with Dorset&#151;over the estates, his profligacy, and his infidelities. She became perforce far more independent-minded, self-reliant, and worldly-wise. She helped with cash her uncle's Westmorland tenants who opposed him in the law courts and supported his political opponents in the north-west. She also indulged her artistic and literary tastes by erecting monuments to her cousin Lady Frances Bourchier in Chenies church, to her mother in Appleby church, and in 1620 to Edmund Spenser, a favourite author, in Westminster Abbey. Her burgeoning interest in her family's history and her father's achievements led her to commission an illustrated volume of his sea enterprises and the antiquary St Loe Kniveton to write up her mother's legal archives in two books. Her own diary for these years has survived in part.<br>
<br>Dorset's death in 1624 made Countess Anne wealthy, with a generous jointure of &pound;2000 a year landed income in Sussex and Essex, and independent. Her daughters' welfare and her claim for the estates were her overriding concerns, hence her purchase of their wardships from the crown. Besides living with her relatives, she frequented the court, with an eye to Lady Margaret's marriage and her own. The suitable match for Lady Margaret was John, Lord Tufton, later second earl of Thanet (1609&#150;1664), the wedding being celebrated on 21 April 1629. The countess added to the Sussex manors provided by Dorset for Lady Margaret's portion several from her own jointure holding. Feeling the need for greater financial security and political support in her campaign for the estates because Earl Francis's heir, her cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5649/', "Henry Clifford")</script>, had been elevated to the Lords, she married, on 3 June 1630, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13042/', "Philip Herbert, earl of Montgomery and fourth earl of Pembroke (1584&#150;1650)")</script>, Charles I's lord chamberlain. He brought her great wealth, power, royal influence, and a life at court, what she needed to counter &#145;the envie, malice and sinister practices&#146; of her enemies Henry Clifford and her brother-in-law Edward, fourth earl of Dorset, who resented her occupying so much Sackville property  (Spence, <span class="italic">Lady Anne Clifford</span>, 94).<br>
<br>With Henry Clifford lacking male heirs, Countess Anne could anticipate the king's award taking effect at his death. She reached an agreement with Pembroke in December 1634 which ensured her possession of the Westmorland lordships while he would hold Skipton on a life interest and raise &pound;5000 there towards her daughter Lady Isabella's portion. Soon after they had a great quarrel&#151;over the estates or his infidelities&#151;and he banished her from London. For eight years she and Lady Isabella lived at his Wiltshire houses, although he joined with her in making formal claims to the estates. On the outbreak of the civil war in 1642 Pembroke requested her to reside in his Baynard's Castle in London to safeguard his rich household belongings, which he moved there. She did not leave for six years and negotiated from there Lady Isabella's marriage on 5 July 1647 to James Compton, third earl of Northampton (1622&#150;1681), the portion being Sussex manors Dorset had assigned Isabella in 1624.<br>
<br>Although the hostilities prevented Countess Anne from entering her estates following Henry Clifford's death in December 1643, she appointed officers in Westmorland and also in Craven, Pembroke's interest notwithstanding. His death in January 1650, six months after she had ridden north, brought her a second jointure estate, in Kent, worth &pound;2000 a year in rents, adding to her now great landed wealth. Moreover, she now had the freedom of action to overthrow the king's award. In Westmorland the issue was the rate of entry fines set by the award. Determined and abrasive, she was successful in November 1656 after years of costly litigation and ejections of tenants in a manner which tarnishes her image. Her object in Craven was to oust Henry Clifford's heirs, Richard Boyle, earl of Burlington (1612&#150;1698), and his countess, Elizabeth, from the properties awarded Earl Francis in 1607. Their Skipton town and her own Silsden tenants bore the brunt of her litigation until she conceded defeat in 1657. But she widened her campaign by championing her Clifford fee as a liberty separate from Staincliffe wapentake which was in Burlington's hands. This alarmed the Yorkshire political establishment who, fearing her love of controversy and lawsuits, blocked her by resort to the courts. Burlington's retaliation, invoking the financial safeguards of the award, threatened not just Countess Anne's Sussex jointure estates but also the Dorsets', Thanets', and Northamptons' interests in them. It appears to have succeeded in curbing Countess Anne's claims to Burlington's Craven properties. She was particularly intransigent during the 1660s, exploiting her powers as hereditary sheriff of Westmorland to defy court orders over paying rents to Sackville College, the East Grinstead almshouses she and Dorset had founded.<br>
<br>The last thirty years of Countess Anne's life, starting at Baynard's in 1646, were immensely creative. She commissioned there two copies of the great triptych, one for each daughter, an exaltation of her noble family and her right to the inheritance (painted by Jan van Belcamp and possibly Peter Lely). She had Kniveton's volumes rewritten and expanded, with contributions from the antiquary Roger Dodsworth, into three great books of record (three copies), a documentary assertion of her title. At Skipton Castle in 1652 she inserted in them her summary of the lives of her forebears and thereafter entered yearly a memorial of her life. Subsequently, she added to her collections two histories of her forebears compiled by the judge and antiquary Sir Matthew Hale, two copies of Earl George's voyages, a book of heraldry, genealogies, and a volume of her mother's letters, which, with the numerous legal documents, mark her as a family historian of special note.<br>
<br>Countess Anne has an outstanding reputation as a builder, restorer, and conservator, a passion indulged on her ancestral estates from 1650 as a very wealthy landowner with about &pound;8000 gross yearly income. In Westmorland she repaired her four castles: Appleby, Brougham, which had been damaged in the civil war, Brough, which had burnt down in 1521, and Pendragon, destroyed by the Scots in 1341. In Craven she restored Skipton Castle so far as she was allowed, following its slighting by parliament in 1648, and Barden Tower, which had been disroofed by the combatants. Her restoration of churches helped revitalize religious observance on her estates, where she defiantly continued to use the proscribed <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> through the 1640s and 1650s, and, unlike her castles, the churches are all still standing. In Westmorland her work is visible at St Lawrence and St Michael's, Bongate, Appleby, at St Wilfrid's and St Ninian's (Ninekirks), Brougham, at St Mary's Chapel, Outhgill, Mallerstang, and at her oratory at Appleby Castle. Her renovations at Holy Trinity, Skipton, and the chapel of Barden Tower were extensive. In 1632 she had, with Pembroke's help, completed the building and endowing of her mother's Beamsley almshouses near Skipton. Between 1651 and 1653 she erected almshouses in Appleby, St Anne's Hospital, initially a retirement home for her women attendants. Plaques on all her buildings publicized her inherited rights to her father's lands and titles. Even more illuminating of her sense of ancestral pride and title were the coats of arms on the triptychs, the inner walls of the hospital, and her fine monuments in Skipton church to her father and in Appleby church to herself. The last also bear uncompromising inscriptions. Her most public demonstration was the shields and inscription on the Countess's Pillar, which she erected near Brougham in 1654 to mark her last parting from her mother. Her other monuments commemorated Samuel Daniel, in Beckington church, Somerset, and her clerk of works, Gabriel Vincent, who directed all her building, in Brough church.<br>
<br>Countess Anne spent the last twenty years of her life as a grand lady, dressed in her favourite black. Her brown eyes and, when young, brown hair worn waist length, complemented a shapely figure, of which she was very proud. In spite of her small stature&#151;less than 5 feet tall&#151;she had a formidable presence, and the strength of will which was a frequently remarked facet of her complex personality is revealed in portraits of her from her middle twenties in a stubbornness about the mouth and chin. Latterly she progressed from castle to castle, receiving in audience a stream of titled relatives and friends who came to pay their respects to her. Living frugally herself, she kept rigorous account of her finances. Her household was a place of piety, charity, and hospitality, her regime beneficent, religious, and, in the best sense of the term, baronial. It ended on 22 March 1676, in Brougham Castle. She was buried on 14 April in the vault she had built for herself in St Lawrence, Appleby.<br>
