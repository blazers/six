<span class="headword">Knowles,  Thomas</span>  (1723&#150;1802), <span class="occ">religious writer</span>, born at Ely, Cambridgeshire, was the son of John Knowles, a verger and master of the works of Ely Cathedral. He was educated at Ely grammar school and at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a sizar on 6 July 1739; he graduated BA in 1744 and MA in 1747. He was elected a college fellow on 23 March 1749 and was ordained deacon at Ely in May 1746 and priest in Norwich in September 1748. He published <span class="italic">The Existence and Attributes of God not Demonstrable A Priori</span> (1746) in response to Samuel Clarke and his followers, in particular to Phillips Glover's <span class="italic">The Argument A Priori &hellip; Stated and Considered</span>. He subsequently published <span class="italic">The Scripture Doctrine of the Existence and Attributes of God &hellip; in Twelve Sermons</span> (1748), the preface of which was written in response to David Hume.<br>
<br>On 10 January 1748 Knowles became rector of Ickworth and of Chedburgh in Suffolk, the second of which he held until his death. He was also chaplain to the dowager Lady Hervey, of Ickworth. In 1752 he had a dispensation to hold the living of Teversham, Cambridgeshire, which he held until 1761. He was made DD by Archbishop Secker in 1753, apparently on the strength of his sermons in response to Bishop Robert Clayton's <span class="italic">An Essay on Spirit</span>. From 1771 onwards he was also lecturer of St Mary's Church, Bury St Edmunds. On 10 October 1779 he was collated to a prebend at Ely, and in 1791 he became rector of Winston, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Knowles also wrote on practical religion: his <span class="italic">Preparatory Discourse on Confirmation</span> was hugely popular and went through ten editions by 1784, and in his final years he published anonymously a book of advice to young clergymen on entering the priesthood. He published two sermons on schools in 1772 and 1787, and works on the <span class="roman">Tithe Bill</span> and <span class="roman">Test Act</span>. His treatise <span class="italic">Primitive Christianity</span> (1789) drew forth <span class="italic">Observations</span> (1789) from Capel Lofft and <span class="italic">Strictures</span> (1790) from James Edward Hamilton.<br>
<br>Knowles died in Chedburgh on 6 October 1802, and was buried in his church there. He was married and one of his two daughters married Benjamin Underwood, rector of Great Barnet and of St Mary Abchurch, Abchurch Yard, London; the other, Eliza, married Sir Edmund Lacon, later baronet.<br>
