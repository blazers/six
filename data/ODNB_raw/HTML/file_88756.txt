<span class="headword">Roper,  Hugh Redwald  Trevor-</span>, Baron Dacre of Glanton  (1914&#150;2003), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 15 January 1914, at Glanton, Northumberland, the elder son of Bertie William Edward Trevor-Roper (1885&#150;1978), physician, and his wife, Kathleen Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davison (1885&#150;1964). His younger brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/93651/', "Patrick Dacre Trevor-Roper (1916&#150;2004)")</script>, followed their father in pursuing a distinguished career in medicine. As a boy Hugh was solitary, self-reliant, and studious: boarding at Charterhouse (after Stancliffe Hall school, Derbyshire, and Belhaven Hill preparatory school, Dunbar) provided relief from a grim household where the children were often rebuffed, but never praised. He was awarded a classical scholarship at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1932, the Craven scholarship in 1933, and a first in classical moderations and the Hertford and Ireland scholarships in 1934; but he then transferred to modern history, in which subject he won first-class honours in 1936. As an undergraduate he moved in a set of hard-drinking hunting men, but read long, challenging works of scholarship with ferocious concentration: he taught himself German so as to study Wilamowitz, but then used his skill to read <span class="italic">Mein Kampf</span>.<br>
<br>Trevor-Roper became a research fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1937 and embarked on research which was published by Macmillan in 1940 as <span class="italic">Archbishop Laud</span>. At this time he was a tory Marxist, committed to economic motives and causation, although his interests later focused on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century political and social structures, and in later middle age his work turned towards the history of ideas and the origins of the Enlightenment.<h2>
<a name="WarserviceandHitlersdeath"></a>War service and Hitler's death</h2>Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, Trevor-Roper was recruited to MI8, the Radio Security Service (RSS), a newly formed War Office department initially based at Wormwood Scrubs, which (after he and a colleague had deciphered a crucial code) became expert in monitoring the intercepted wireless traffic of the Abwehr, the German intelligence service. Trevor-Roper had an intelligence of rare clarity and incisive force that exceptionally fitted him for the task of analysing and interpreting this welter of material. In recognition of their successes he and the RSS were transferred in 1941 to MI6's counter-espionage section. Trevor-Roper was a resolute, independent-minded officer, who more than once was threatened with court martial: although never insubordinate, he was impatient and provocative of complacent mediocrity. In 1943 he became head of the radio intelligence section, a new branch of MI6, and developed a special interest in the workings of the German underground opposition. During 1944 he joined the War Room, a counter-intelligence group preparing for the occupation of Germany, headed by his friend Dick White.<br>
<br>It was at White's instigation that in the autumn of 1945 Major Trevor-Roper began a systematic investigation into the circumstances of Hitler's death, including interrogation of eyewitnesses, and compiled an official report on the subject. After returning to Christ Church as a Student (tutor) in 1946, he expanded his report into a book, <span class="italic">The Last Days of Hitler</span>, which was published to high acclaim in 1947. It was never out of print in its author's lifetime. <h2>
<a name="Oxforddon"></a>Oxford don</h2>Trevor-Roper was a relentless scourge of zealots, cheats, and bores, and had exacting standards of historical evidence. But although he required the truth to be pure, he liked his mentors to be wicked gossips. In 1940 he was befriended by the selfish but winsome Chelsea man of letters Logan Pearsall Smith: Trevor-Roper's supple, exact, indelible prose, his elaborate elegance as a raconteur, and his malicious pleasures owed much to Smith. In 1947, while visiting Italy as a special correspondent of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, he met Smith's brother-in-law Bernard Berenson, the tutelary genius of I Tatti, to whom he became gratefully devoted for training his pictorial imagination and for quickening his interest in the history of European ideas. Another enduring friendship, dating from 1951, was with Gerald Brenan. These contacts were proof of Trevor-Roper's interest in European, rather than merely national or regional, history. He had a reading knowledge of at least eight languages and was an inveterate traveller; and he thus acquired a breadth of experience and scholarship that English historians seldom attain&#151;there had been no one to rival the cosmopolitanism of his professional expertise since Lord Acton. He was the pioneering advocate in Britain of <i>l'histoire totale</i>. He extolled the <span class="italic">Annales</span> school in France, and particularly the early work of Fernand Braudel: during the 1950s he attended their seminars in Paris.<br>
<br>In 1953 Trevor-Roper, whom Pearsall Smith had encouraged in a taste for the coroneted <i>haute monde</i>, began a passionate affair with Lady Alexandra Henrietta Louisa Howard-Johnston (1907&#150;1997), the wife of Rear-Admiral Clarence Dinsmore Howard-Johnston and eldest daughter of Field-Marshal Earl Haig. After an acrimonious divorce the lovers were married on 4 October 1954: Trevor-Roper thus acquired three stepchildren.<br>
<br>The success of <span class="italic">The Last Days of Hitler</span>, and Trevor-Roper's beautifully limpid prose, made him a sought-after and well-paid reviewer, essayist, and travel writer in the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>, and other periodicals. These worldly successes, and his sardonic humour, were resented by some contemporaries in Oxford, where his appointment to the chair of modern history was blocked in 1951. He was a dialectic historian, who investigated and tested the truths of other historians, sometimes with grave irony and on other occasions with destructive zest. By now he detested talk of ineluctable historical forces and all mechanistic theories of history: he cherished the free wills and moral choices of historical protagonists. His formidable powers as a controversialist were evident in his essay demolishing Lawrence Stone's views on the Elizabethan aristocracy (1951); in his annihilating <i>opusculum</i> directed against R. H. Tawney's &#145;The gentry 1540&#150;1640&#146; (1953); and in his <span class="italic">Encounter</span> polemics, &#145;Arnold Toynbee's millennium&#146; (1957) and &#145;A. J. P. Taylor, Hitler and the war&#146; (1961).<br>
<br>These activities distracted him from writing the big book that his friends expected of him. After 1948 he started but discarded several monographs, produced an edition of Hitler's table talk in 1953, and collected his <span class="italic">Historical Essays</span> in 1957; but his efforts after 1958 to produce a <i>magnum opus</i>&#151;conceived as a three-volume study of the age of Cromwell and modified into a volume on the crisis in English government from 1600 to 1658&#151;were abortive. He could not find a satisfactory form or ending for his manuscript, which was, he felt, overcrowded with argument. This failure caused him anguish, which was not relieved by the ambivalent critical reception of <span class="italic">The Rise of Christian Europe</span> (1965). His default also gratified his proliferating enemies, for Trevor-Roper was a combative man whose razor-edged intelligence caused wounds that in some cases never healed. He was a sceptic who hated closed intellectual systems, despised metaphysics, and was revolted by the enforced submission of personal judgement to doctrinal authority. This led him into trenchant criticism of Catholicism, especially fashionable converts and their Jesuit confessors; of Stalinists; but also&#151;for in these matters he was even-handed&#151;of communist witch-hunts. His keen scrutiny after 1966 of the bogus traditions and theocratic Calvinism underlying some currents of Scottish nationalism was never forgiven in some quarters.<h2>
<a name="Regiusprofessor"></a>Regius professor</h2>Trevor-Roper was an astute if mischievous intriguer in university politics, and after careful manoeuvres he secured his appointment as regius professor of modern history in 1957. This required him to relinquish his studentship at Christ Church for a fellowship at a smaller, more staid college, Oriel, where his colleagues, rather than feeling refreshed by a healthy breeze after his arrival, initially shuddered at his chill Northumbrian blast. Of his predecessors in the regius chair he most admired York Powell, &#145;a universal man accidentally thrown up among our grim specialists&#146;  (Lloyd-Jones and others, 13), as he said in his inaugural lecture, which attacked obscurantism and timid pedantry among scholars, and urged that historical writing must be provocative, even playful, if history was not to seem a dead subject. Though Trevor-Roper disdained irresponsible frivolity, or any other form of cowardice in the face of life's difficulties, he cared even less for unrelenting seriousness, which seemed to him a form of fanaticism that stultified scholarship. He wanted Oxford University to be saved from &#145;solemn, pompous, dreary, respectable &hellip; experts&#146; and to be instead &#145;gay, irreverent, genial, unpompous&#146;  (Trevor-Roper, 307). To this end he masterminded the campaign that resulted in the defeat of Oliver Franks and the election of Harold Macmillan as chancellor of the university in 1960.<br>
<br>The range of Trevor-Roper's interests was exceptional: only he could have published, in the same year (1964), editions of Gibbon's <span class="italic">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</span> and of <span class="italic">Hitler's War Directives</span>. His many time-consuming digressions included investigations in the 1950s into the Swedish humanitarian Count Bernadotte's murky dealings with Himmler's Estonian masseur Felix Kersten; his report on Adolf Eichmann's trial in Israel in 1961; and his scrutiny of the Warren commission's report, which convinced him that President Kennedy's assassination was a conspiracy. Trevor-Roper, who had known and liked Kim Philby, wrote of twentieth-century espionage with subtle authority in <span class="italic">The Philby Affair</span> (1968). In that year, too, he began occasional contributions to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> of witty pastiches, purporting to be the letters of a seventeenth-century Oxford don, &#145;Mercurius Oxoniensis&#146;, commenting on the vagaries of academic life and the absurdity of contemporary manners: these were collectively published as <span class="italic">The Letters of Mercurius</span> (1970). In 1973, at Basel airport, the manuscript memoirs of the Sinologue Sir Edmund Backhouse were confided to Trevor-Roper's keeping. He found them obscene, fantastic, and risible; but his testing of their claims resulted in <span class="italic">A Hidden Life</span> (1976), which (with cool, unwavering irony) revealed Backhouse as a fantasist, forger, and swindler. It confirmed Trevor-Roper's place as the funniest historian since his hero, Gibbon.<br>
<br>Trevor-Roper's forte, like Namier's, was the historical essay; but&#151;perhaps unlike Namier&#151;he valued historical evidence for its quality, not its massed quantity. It was a joy to watch him in a record office, as his eyes darted with hawk-like vigilance over the papers on his desk: he mistrusted those who delved interminably in muniment rooms, and liked to reach his conclusions not from dogged archival trawls but by swift, confident assessment of the sources followed by the play of his intelligence over his selection of evidence. The lack of evident intensity in his research suggests one reason why colleagues such as V. H. Galbraith felt reservations about him. <span class="italic">Religion, the Reformation and Social Change</span> (1967) showed Trevor-Roper's powers as an essayist at their finest. His approach was always eclectic, not doctrinaire; he was a historian of moods and tempers, who used social structures and systems as explanations. He admired moderate social critics, like Erasmus and Bacon, but deprecated historians such as Christopher Hill who sentimentalized saboteurs, outsiders, and nihilists. His luminous, penetrative, discriminating mind was equally joyous in three further collections: <span class="italic">Renaissance Essays</span> (1985); <span class="italic">Catholics, Anglicans and Puritans</span> (1987); and <span class="italic">From Counter-Reformation to Glorious Revolution</span> (1992). Original ideas, fertile speculations, and dazzling comparisons, which narrower historians might achieve only once or twice in their careers, sparkled through his pages.<br>
<br>The Thatcher government recommended Trevor-Roper for a life peerage in 1979, and he took the title Baron Dacre of Glanton. As an impish anti-clerical he most enjoyed, among his other honours, his doctorate of divinity from the University of the South, Sewanee, Tennessee (1980). He had been elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1969.<h2>
<a name="MasterofPeterhouse"></a>Master of Peterhouse</h2>Dacre retired early from the regius chair to become master of Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1980. His appointment was instigated by a group of high tory bachelor dons, led by Maurice Cowling, who felt confident that his sallies would enhance the gaiety of the senior common room and that he would oppose moves to admit women to the college. They had misjudged their man, for Dacre was a reforming whig, who believed that a clerisy should be open, plural, civilized, and efficient. He wanted constitutional process, not die-hard custom, to govern college business. He resisted, and in some cases defeated, reactionary tendencies in the college, and vigorously promoted its 1984 appeal. The state of the college library in 1980 scandalized him, and he was especially proud of instigating the creation of a new library. The rancour at Peterhouse exasperated Dacre, and at times became too dominant an obsession, but never wholly soured him. The Dacres made the master's lodge a centre of hospitality and culture, and had grateful admirers, as well as detractors, among the fellowship.<br>
<br>Gavin Astor, his wife's brother-in-law, had secured Trevor-Roper's appointment as an independent national director of Times Newspapers in 1974. Dacre opposed the selection of Harold Evans as editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1981, and deplored the sales strategy of Rupert Murdoch who, he believed, wished to degrade British institutions, especially the monarchy, by a campaign of constant belittlement, trivialize British politics, vulgarize national culture, and reduce the population to a boorish, infantilized mass. Trevor-Roper, in the post-war period, had sacrificed some of his best energies to journalism; and the great calamity of his life, in 1983, arose from his involvement with the newspaper world. Sixty handwritten volumes purporting to be Hitler's diaries were concocted by a Stuttgart confidence trickster and sold for &pound;3.5 million to <span class="italic">Stern</span> magazine. After Murdoch decided that he wanted an immediate decision on serialization rights, Dacre rashly submitted to pressure from Charles Douglas-Home, editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, to inspect the diaries in a Zurich bank vault. Following a cursory examination, and misled by false assurances that were intended to further the criminal conspiracy, Dacre allowed the correct processes of historical verification to be sacrificed to the exigencies of a newspaper scoop. On the very day (23 April 1983) that Dacre's exuberant authentication of the diaries was trumpeted in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, he developed sharp misgivings, of which he warned Douglas-Home; but these doubts were not conveyed to the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, which published a farrago of humiliating nonsense the next day. His reputation was permanently besmirched, although it was not until 1988 that Murdoch dislodged him from his directorship of Times Newspapers.<h2>
<a name="Characterandfinalyears"></a>Character and final years</h2>The enmities that Dacre aroused could obscure the affection that he generated. At Christ Church and Oriel he was solicitous and stylish in his treatment of undergraduates: he preferred them to be high-spirited and sociable, and regaled them with indiscretions about wartime MI6. In the 1960s he baited student revolutionaries, and after those disturbances had subsided he continued to retaliate against undergraduate sloppiness and self-indulgence, whether in work, appearance, or emotions, for he always was reticent, fastidious, and self-controlled. He was not an academic empire-builder, but gave meticulous, witty, and subversive encouragement to young scholars.<br>
<br>After he left Peterhouse in 1987 Dacre's personal tensions and intellectual assertiveness both relaxed. He nursed his wife through the distressing course of Alzheimer's disease. He developed Charles Bonnet's syndrome, which in 1998&#150;2001 gave him such alarming hallucinations that, for a time, this most unswervingly rational of men feared that he was losing his sanity. Although nearly blind, he maintained a large international correspondence, and spent months painfully rereading voluminous notes for long-abandoned biographies to write the entries for this dictionary of, among others, Theodore Mayerne and Thomas Sutton. Finally, he was stricken by prostate cancer, which he faced with stoical fortitude, and of which he died, on 26 January 2003, at Sobell House hospice, Oxford. His ashes were scattered at Dryburgh Abbey, Berwickshire. He was survived by his three stepchildren.<br>
