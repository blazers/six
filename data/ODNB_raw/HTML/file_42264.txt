<span class="headword">Wynford,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1405), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, is first recorded in 1360, working as one of two wardens of masons at Windsor Castle under <a name="cosubject_42264"></a><span class="headword">John Sponlee</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1382?), who had become <span class="occ">master mason</span> there in 1350. The work then in progress was the royal lodgings block in the upper ward, the chief part of the costliest building project undertaken in late medieval England. The pressures of organizing an exceptionally large workforce probably account for the departure from the usual practice of appointing only one warden, and perhaps also for Wynford's promotion to joint &#145;ordainer&#146; with Sponlee in April 1361. Only in 1366 did Wynford spend the whole year at Windsor. Sponlee probably retained responsibility for the design, as he was paid at the exceptional rate of 2<i>s</i>. per day, twice the normal pay of a master mason. In 1369 Sponlee walked in Queen Philippa's funeral procession among the royal household's esquires of greater estate (whereas Wynford was ranked as an esquire of lesser estate) and he retained overall control of the works at Windsor until at least 1377. Wynford had commissions to impress masons for royal works in 1371, 1372, and 1378, the last being for Southampton Castle, where he was master mason of a great cylindrical keep hurriedly erected in response to the growing threat of invasion from France. Wynford's latest known royal work was the remodelling in 1394&#150;5 of the aisles of the thirteenth-century great hall of Winchester Castle.<br>
<br>Wynford's employment at Windsor occurred while the clerk of works there was William Wykeham (<i>d</i>. 1404). Whether the latter's influence brought about Wynford's rapid promotion is not known, but personal links forged between the two men in 1360&#150;61 must lie behind Wykeham's decision to entrust to his erstwhile colleague the prodigious series of works he undertook after his elevation to the see of Winchester. The 1377&#150;8 accounts for the reconstruction of the episcopal manor house at Bishop's Waltham, Hampshire, contain a reference to Wynford as master mason for all of Wykeham's works, a position which he appears to have held continuously until the bishop's death in 1404. The earliest of Wykeham's three most important undertakings, New College, Oxford, was mostly built between 1380 and 1386. It betrays heavy influence from the upper ward at Windsor, not only in respect of the planning of its main quadrangle, which Wykeham as patron could perfectly well have stipulated, but also in terms of its detailed treatment, which is far more likely to reflect the preferences of the architect. The building accounts are lost, but the design can with confidence be attributed to Wynford, as it shows the closest stylistic kinship with Wykeham's next major project. This was Winchester College, begun in 1387, for which Wynford was certainly the master mason. Both colleges exhibit a sober elegance of treatment which is carefully modulated to underline the hierarchy of functions within a rigorously integrated ensemble. New College was to exert a strong influence on Oxford college architecture during the rest of the middle ages and beyond. Wynford built much for Wykeham at his numerous episcopal residences, but the only well-preserved survival is the manor house at East Meon, Hampshire, of <i>c</i>.1395&#150;7.<br>
<br>Wykeham's and Wynford's last and greatest undertaking was the remodelling of the nave of Winchester Cathedral, begun in 1394. Alongside the nave of Canterbury Cathedral, this is the outstanding surviving work of late fourteenth-century English church architecture. Wynford hit on an ingeniously minimal method of modernizing a Romanesque fabric, namely the cutting away of the angles of the old piers to form diagonal planes. Although abnormally bulky, the resulting supports incorporate enough verticals, and possess enough variety of modelling, to give a convincing approximation to Perpendicular aesthetics. If the aim of this singular procedure was economy, it must be judged a failure, since many parts of the Romanesque facework could not be recut and had to be replaced with new masonry. The stylistic character of Wynford's design is broadly similar to that of the works of Henry Yevele (<i>d</i>. 1400), his leading contemporary, but it shows a less complete adherence to the formal repertory developed in the 1330s by the pioneer of Perpendicular in the south-east, William Ramsey (<i>d</i>. 1349). It is possible that Wynford's approach at Winchester was influenced by his experience of refashioning the Romanesque church of Abingdon Abbey, in progress <i>c</i>.1375&#150;6 (destroyed).<br>
<br>When Wynford died in Winchester in 1405, probably on 25 July, it is likely that only that part of the cathedral nave which incorporated Wykeham's chantry chapel had been completely remodelled. Better than any other extant work, the chantry shows Wynford's skill in small-scale decorative architecture. That Wykeham regarded his architect highly is evident from the inclusion of a representation of him in the east window of Winchester College chapel. The carpenter Hugh Herland (<i>d</i>. 1406?) appears in the same window in a less honorific position behind Wynford, but no other fourteenth-century English architects are known to have been commemorated in this way.<br>
<br>In 1365 Wynford became master mason to Wells Cathedral, possibly through the influence of Wykeham, who had been a prebendary there until 1363. The upper stages of the south-west tower, built <i>c</i>.1385&#150;95, are probably lower and plainer than those intended by the architect of the 150-year-old work which they surmount. Nevertheless, Wynford's design, followed in the early fifteenth-century north-west tower, provides a wholly convincing termination to this grandest of English Gothic cathedral fa&ccedil;ades.<br>
