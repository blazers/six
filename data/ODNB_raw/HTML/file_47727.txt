<span class="headword">Tredgold,  Alfred Frank</span>  (1870&#150;1952), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at 49 Liversage Street, Derby, on 5 November 1870, the son of Joseph Tredgold, a builder's foreman, and his wife, Bessey Smith. His ancestors belonged to the Cornish family of Tregol, but his own branch of the family came from Lincolnshire. Six of his near relatives were members of the medical profession. He studied medicine at Durham University and the London Hospital, where he won scholarships and prizes in biology, anatomy, physiology, pathology, and medicine. After qualifying in 1899 he married Zo&euml; (<i>d</i>. 1947), daughter of F. A. Hanbury, barrister-at-law. In the same year he was offered a research scholarship in insanity and mental disease, recently founded by the London county council. He chose mental deficiency as his subject and worked for two years in the LCC's asylums and newly built Claybury Laboratory under F. W. Mott. When the scholarship expired he entered general practice to earn a living. In 1905 he was appointed as one of the main medical investigators to the royal commission on the care and control of the feeble-minded. His views were largely endorsed in the report of the commission, which was released in 1908. In the same year he published the first edition of his <span class="italic">Mental Deficiency (Amentia)</span>, which became the standard text on the subject, going through eight editions in his lifetime alone. His ideas and campaigning efforts paved the way for a specialized system of institutional care under the <span class="roman">Mental Deficiency Act</span> of 1913.<br>
<br>Tredgold had been commissioned as an officer in the 2nd volunteer battalion of the Queen's regiment in 1905. On the outbreak of the First World War he offered his services as a mental expert to the Royal Army Medical Corps. However, the importance of such skills was not yet recognized and Tredgold remained a combatant. He served at Gallipoli, and in Egypt and Sinai, rising to the rank of major. In 1916 he was invalided home with severe dysentery, but he remained in command of the local Territorial depot in Guildford. Between the wars he was the leading consultant in mental deficiency in the country. He became neurologist to the Royal Surrey County Hospital and physician in psychological medicine to the London Hospital. He lectured at the Bethlem and Maudsley hospitals and at the London School of Economics. He served on the mental deficiency committees of the Board of Education and the BMA, and on the Ministry of Health's (Brock) committee on sterilization. He was elected FRCP in 1929, was president of the psychological section of the Royal Society of Medicine, and in 1927 gave the Galton lecture to the Eugenics Society. He was one of the driving forces behind the Central Association for Mental Welfare, a voluntary organization which provided community supervision for defectives, and he taught on its training courses for social workers and medical officers. His <span class="italic">Manual of Psychological Medicine</span> (1943) proved to be another widely read textbook.<br>
<br>Tredgold argued that amentia (his preferred term for mental deficiency) was generally caused by the inheritance or acquisition of a defective germplasm, through poor stock or the effect of alcohol, syphilis, and other poisons. This disposition led to below average intelligence, social failure, and immorality. Training could ameliorate but not cure this pathological condition. Tredgold continued to support his germplasm theory, despite mounting evidence for a genetic explanation. Regarding defectives as a danger to society, he was an ardent proponent of lifetime segregation. However, he was at first wary about sterilization, resigning from the Eugenics Society in 1931 over its claim that sterilization would halve the number of defectives over three generations&#151;in his view a wild overestimate. Nevertheless, in 1934 he endorsed the Brock report's proposals for a voluntary scheme and thereafter joined the campaign to legalize voluntary sterilization.<br>
<br>Shortly after the death of his wife, in 1947, Tredgold lost the sight in one eye through glaucoma. Loss of sight in the other eye and a stroke disabled him in his final years, but he still managed to prepare new editions of his books with the assistance of his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65060/', "Roger Francis Tredgold (1911&#150;1975)")</script>. He died at his home, St Martin's, Clandon Road, Guildford, on 17 September 1952. He was survived by two daughters and a son. The elder daughter, Joan Alison (1903&#150;1989), was principal of Cheltenham Ladies' College in 1953&#150;64, and his son, physician-in-charge of the department of psychological medicine, University College Hospital, oversaw later editions of <span class="italic">Tredgold's Mental Deficiency</span>.<br>
