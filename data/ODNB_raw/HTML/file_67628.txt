<span class="headword">Binge,  Ronald</span>  (1910&#150;1979), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born at Derby on 15 July 1910, the eldest of three children of Lawrence Binge, iron moulder, and his wife, Florence Gertrude Davies. His father served as a soldier in the First World War, dying of his wounds in 1920. As a boy Ronnie, as he was known, sang in St Andrew's Church, Derby, soon learning the piano and organ. Private lessons in harmony and counterpoint followed. Straitened circumstances precluded a college education, and at the age of seventeen he took employment as organist at a local cinema, arranging and composing for its small orchestra for silent films.<br>
<br>In 1931 Binge became pianist to a light orchestra at Great Yarmouth, also playing the piano accordion, upon which he eventually became a virtuoso. After moving to London he played in theatre, dance, and caf&eacute; ensembles. In 1935 he began his long association with Mantovani as arranger for his new Tipica orchestra, also playing the accordion. Among his compositions was music for the film <span class="italic">Thirteen Men and a Gun</span>.<br>
<br>Binge served in the Royal Air Force from 1940 to 1945; but it was not long before he began directing musical activities in association with Sidney Torch. He composed his first orchestral success, <span class="italic">Spitfire</span>, at that time. In 1942 he became a link trainer (flight simulator) operator, and in 1944 he met Vera (<i>b</i>. 1922/3), daughter of James Simmons, an electrician. They were married on 2 June the following year. After demobilization, Binge reactivated his association with Mantovani. Much in demand as arranger, he scored No&euml;l Coward's musical <span class="italic">Pacific 1860</span> for the Drury Lane Theatre in 1946.<br>
<br>Binge's successful compositions included <span class="italic">Madrugado</span>, <span class="italic">Las Casta&ntilde;uelas</span>, <span class="italic">The Red Sombrero</span>, and <span class="italic">Trade Winds</span>. A composition entitled <span class="italic">Prelude: the Whispering Valley</span> featured solo piano with strings. In 1951 he was given a free hand for a new recording while Mantovani was away on tour: in this he created the striking &#145;cascading strings&#146; effect, which brought international acclaim to the new-style Mantovani orchestra. In his BBC radio programme <span class="italic">Sunday Rhapsody</span> Mantovani also performed Binge's compositions. The most notable work by Binge was <span class="italic">Elizabethan Serenade</span>, which became an outstanding international success, winning an Ivor Novello award in 1957. Its vocal version, <span class="italic">Where the Gentle Avon Flows</span>, with words by Christopher Hassall, was issued in several forms.<br>
<br>After these broadcasts Ronald Binge brought to an amicable end his association with Mantovani to concentrate on composition. His subsequent works included music for the films <span class="italic">Desperate Moment</span> (1953), <span class="italic">The Runaway Bus</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Dance Little Lady</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Our Girl Friday</span> (1953), and many for American television. He received commissions for BBC light music festivals in 1952 (<span class="italic">Thames Rhapsody</span>) and 1956 (saxophone concerto). He hoped (without success) that colleagues would forget his &#145;Mantovani sound&#146; achievement, though variants of it came with &#145;Dance of the Snowflakes&#146; (which can be characterized as &#145;cascading strings&#146; with trills on) and &#145;Cornet Carillon&#146;, an immediate hit with brass bands.<br>
<br>Binge produced many miniatures for the recorded background music libraries of publishers. The best-known were &#145;The Watermill&#146;, used as the signature tune for BBC television's <span class="italic">The Secret Garden</span>, and the deceptively simple &#145;Sailing By&#146;, long cherished as late-night signing-off music for BBC Radio 4. Later compositions include the <span class="italic">Saturday Symphony</span> (1966&#150;8), <span class="roman">Te Deum</span> (1970), and two albums for solo guitar. From 1952 Binge devised and conducted his own BBC radio programme called <span class="italic">String Song</span>, creating a new spaciousness in monaural sound. From that time on he regularly conducted his own works at home and abroad.<br>
<br>On a basis of impeccable technique, Binge's originality is evident in his turn of melody (often of an engaging, quirky nature), his intimate understanding of players and their instruments, and a novel use of texture. <span class="italic">The Tales of Three Blind Mice</span> demonstrated his mastery of counterpoint. He composed two ingenious &#145;palindromes&#146;, a toccata for piano entitled <span class="italic">Vice Versa</span> and <span class="italic">Upside, Downside</span> for a school trio, which reads exactly the same whichever way up the performer places the music. Binge was elected a member of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1951. He believed firmly in the encouragement of &#145;light music&#146;, however inadequate the term, as its own genre. For some years he served on the BBC music advisory committee and the council of the Songwriters' Guild of Great Britain, and also as a director of the Performing Right Society. Ronald Binge died of cancer on 6 September 1979 at Ringwood, Hampshire; he was survived by his wife, son, and daughter.<br>
