<span class="headword">London,  David  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1189), <span class="occ">ecclesiastic and canon lawyer</span>, was one of the many Englishmen who studied law at Bologna in the twelfth century; what sets him apart is the survival of his letter collection, &#145;The register of Master David&#146;, so that some details of his life, interests, and personality are unusually well documented. He was born in London, was a student in Clermont, where he acquired the title <i>magister</i>; he went on to Paris, and then to Bologna. He doubtless taught as well as studied at Bologna, and it is possible that he was &#145;D.&#146;, the glossator who appears in Bolognese glosses of the 1180s. While he was at Bologna, and at the latest by 1167, he was presented to the prebend of Brownswood in St Paul's, and he remained a canon of St Paul's until his death. In early days he enjoyed the patronage of Gilbert Foliot, bishop of London (<i>d</i>. 1187); Gilbert put him in charge of two of his own nephews who were also studying in Bologna&#151;both dignitaries of St Paul's&#151;and in 1169&#150;70 sent Master David to Rome to plead his cause with the pope. The bishop had been excommunicated by Thomas Becket for his opposition to Becket's cause, and David's defence both of the bishop and of the king against Becket's attack impressed the pope and curia: the pope himself said that it was David who persuaded him to grant Gilbert absolution, and that he was worthy of a bishopric, not just of a canonry. With this and other testimonials David set off from the curia, and attempted to improve his endowments at home, winning a royal pension of &pound;20 per annum, and one of &pound;10 per annum from the bishop, pending further preferment which never came.<br>
<br>Late in 1170 Becket again excommunicated Gilbert Foliot, and David was once more at the curia. He gives a dramatic account of how he and his colleague Master Hugh were working hard in the cause when news came of Becket's murder on 29 December 1170. For a time the pope would not give audience to David and his colleagues; but he argued the case for king and bishop privately, and once again the pope bore witness to his fidelity and skill. Thus far he had worked wholly to Gilbert Foliot's satisfaction.<br>
<br>David's later years, however, seem to have brought disappointment: he held his pensions until his death, but remained only a canon of St Paul's. In 1179&#150;80, it seems, he unsuccessfully intrigued to become dean of St Paul's; by then he had quarrelled with Gilbert Foliot and was working for Roger, bishop of Worcester (<i>d</i>. 1179). He continued to witness Gilbert's <i>acta</i>, especially those settling legal cases, throughout the 1170s, but not in the bishop's last years. Nevertheless David was resident at St Paul's for a part at least of his own later years. He probably died on 31 March 1189.<br>
<br>David's register survives in the Vatican Library, MS Lat. 6024, amid a remarkable group of letter collections. But it was evidently originally a separate double quire, fols. 140&#150;154, and there can be little doubt that these quires were put together by David himself or under his eye. The register was edited by F. Liverani in 1863, very inaccurately, and became more widely known from the fundamental article by Z. N. Brooke of 1927; some of its contents have been re-edited since. Most, though not all, of the contents relate to David's own affairs: the chief exception is the dossier concerning the canonization of Edward the Confessor. But taken as a whole it is a fascinating revelation of the interests of an active and intelligent canonist involved in Anglo-papal relations and lawsuits in the late 1160s and 1170s.<br>
