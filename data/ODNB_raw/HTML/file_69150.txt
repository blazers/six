<span class="headword">Redman,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1540), <span class="occ">printer</span>, first comes to notice in a record of a fine paid for selling foreign books in 1521 when his freedom is described, as in his will: &#145;Stacioner and Freman of London&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/28, fol. 117<i>r</i>). He was assessed in the Middlesex lay subsidy of 1523/4 for &pound;10 in the parish of St Clement Danes. The London stationer John Redman, who printed editions for him in 1534 and 1539, may have been a relation. Robert Redman operated his business from a number of carefully chosen premises. He began printing as well as selling books in 1525 at the sign of the George in St Clement's, outside Temple Bar. He was in the main a printer of law books, and adopted the same sign as his main competitor in this trade, Richard Pynson, the king's printer at the sign of the George in nearby Fleet Street. In 1527 Redman moved his own shop to Fleet Street, under the same sign, only 100 yards from Pynson. When Pynson died in 1530, Redman moved his business to Pynson's old shop.<br>
<br>Redman was a prolific printer: 203 editions were printed for or by him between 1523 and 1540. He printed vernacular devotional manuals and other popular texts, such as herbals and saints' lives. Legal texts, however, comprised more than 60 per cent of his output. His use of Pynson's signs, and later devices, and printing material, were one way that he secured access to the legal book market, which was monopolized by the king's printers. In the 1520s Redman had issued editions of the <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>, Thomas Littleton's <span class="italic">Tenures</span>, and yearbooks in direct competition with Pynson. This, and his encroachment upon his competitor's sign and shop, led Pynson to call him &#145;Rob. Redman, sed verius Rudeman&#146; in his own 1520s editions of the <span class="italic">Tenures</span>. In the 1530s Redman continued to compete with Pynson's successor as king's printer, Thomas Berthelet, by issuing further editions of the <span class="italic">Tenures</span>, as well as Christopher St German's <span class="italic">Division betwene the Spirytualtie and Temporaltie</span>, the <span class="italic">Natura brevium</span>, and law books by Anthony Fitzherbert, for which Berthelet apparently held privileges. It was perhaps at Berthelet's instigation that Redman was brought before the privy council on 15 May 1533 and bound over for 500 marks not to sell St German's work, or any other books privileged by the king.<br>
<br>Redman was perhaps sympathetic to religious reform. He may have used a Wycliffite translation for parts of his <span class="italic">Prayers of the Byble</span> (1535, <span class="italic">STC</span> 20200.3), one of the earliest books of English scripture. He certainly printed William Hardy's Lollard <span class="italic">Lanterne of Lyght</span> in 1535, and reformist material by John Frith in 1534. Redman's name appears in relation to an English primer in correspondence between Thomas Cromwell and Thomas Cranmer in 1537; a year earlier he printed a translation of a text by Erasmus that the reformist author Richard Taverner dedicated to Cromwell. In the latter year he was also commissioned to print a translation by another reformer, Tristram Revel, for presentation to Anne Boleyn, but the author was brought before the council and the edition cancelled. In 1541 the printer Robert Bankes was brought before the council accused of producing ballads by Thomas Smyth attacking Cromwell, and responses by William Gray accusing Smyth of popery. Bankes claimed that the broadsides had false imprints and had in fact been printed by Richard Grafton and Redman, who was by then dead; Grafton admitted the charge and was imprisoned.<br>
<br>Redman died at some point between 21 October 1540, when he drew up his will, and 4 November 1540, when it was proved. Among his beneficiaries was Henry Smith, his son-in-law and a fellow printer of law books. He left the main part of his business to his widow. His first wife, whose name is unknown, died in 1537. His second became the first English woman to print books under her maiden name, <a name="cosubject_69150"></a><span class="headword">Elisabeth Pickering</span>  (<em>c.</em>1510&#150;1562), although by the time of her marriage to Redman she had already been married to a man named Jackson, with whom she had two daughters, Lucy and Elizabeth. In the nine months or so after Redman's death, Elisabeth printed at least thirteen editions that survive, eleven bearing her name. All her editions were from earlier Redman prints, mostly medical tracts and law books. She married again in 1541, about which time she sold her business to William Middleton. Elisabeth's new husband was William Cholmeley (<i>d</i>. in or before 1546), a gentleman of Lincoln's Inn. Like Redman, Cholmeley mentions Henry Smith in his will, which was proved in April 1546. Alice Redman, later Alice Hilton, a daughter of Elisabeth and Redman, as well as Lucy and Elizabeth Jackson, are mentioned. Another daughter of Elisabeth and Redman, Mildred Hanbury, in disgrace after marrying under age, is not mentioned. William Cholmeley was freed as a member of the Stationers shortly before he and Elisabeth married. He may, at her instigation, have assisted with the unsuccessful 1542 charter of incorporation of that company. Following Cholmeley's death, Elisabeth married William's relative, Ranulph Cholmeley (<i>d</i>. 1563), who, from 1554, was the recorder of London, and sometime counsel to the Stationers'. Ranulph was probably the author of the Stationers' successful charter of incorporation of 1556. It is likely that Elisabeth's own interest in the book trade is linked to the important role her last two husbands played in the Stationers' incorporation. Elisabeth died in October 1562, when the administration of her previous husbands' goods was granted to Ranulph Cholmeley. She was buried in St Dunstan-in-the-West Church; Ranulph was buried next to her when he died in late April 1563. His will, proved in May, gives some indication of Elisabeth's circle about the time of her death: among those named are William Roper, the printer Richard Tottell, and no fewer than three former lord mayors of London: Thomas Leigh, Thomas Offley, and William Chester. Her funeral service was held at St Margaret Lothbury and her body then carried for burial in St Dunstan-in-the-West, where her last husband was buried six months later.<br>
