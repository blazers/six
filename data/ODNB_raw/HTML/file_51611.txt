<span class="headword">Conder,  Peter John</span>  (1919&#150;1993), <span class="occ">ornithologist and conservationist</span>, was born on 20 March 1919 at 81 Thornton Avenue, Streatham, London, the son of John Reynolds Conder, a shipbroker, and his wife Edna Frances, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Benson. Conder's interest in birds began with egg collecting, an activity he later opposed. He was educated at Cranleigh School, Surrey; he won a prize when in the junior school for completing a bird diary, and his basic training in ornithology came through the school ornithological society and one of his schoolmasters, Marston Henniker-Godley. Conder recalled sneaking from the school dormitory for early morning bird-watching expeditions. After leaving school he was sent to Lausanne to learn French and spent six weeks in Newfoundland on a British Schools Exploring Society expedition. In the spring of 1938 he became a clerk in the voucher department of the advertising agency of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46623/', "Samuel Herbert Benson (1854&#150;1914)")</script>, his maternal grandfather and one of the pioneers of advertising in England.<br>
<br>As war approached Conder joined the Territorial Army and was commissioned into the Royal Corps of Signals. When the British expeditionary force was sent to France in 1939 his unit was part of the 51st Highland division, and in June 1940 he was captured at St Valery-sur-Somme. During almost five years' incarceration his interest in ornithology helped him to survive. For him the wild birds that flew freely in and out of the camp were objects of hope. He spent part of this period in Eichstatt in Bavaria, where he watched migrants passing over and studied the breeding behaviour of goldfinches, later publishing the results in <span class="italic">Ibis</span> in 1948. He made notes of his observations on any paper he could find. The camp guards became accustomed to the lone bird-watcher wandering around the camp and constantly taking notes, an activity that gave him the opportunity to record the routine of his captors and thus to provide intelligence for escape attempts.<br>
<br>After demobilization Conder did not relish spending the rest of his working life in an advertising agency and he resigned within a month of returning to S. H. Benson. In 1947, after a short period at the British Museum (Natural History), he became warden of Skokholm bird observatory, where he studied wheatears, the subject of his monograph <span class="italic">The Wheatear</span> (1990). On 12 January 1952 he married Patricia Neale (<i>b</i>. 1919/20), daughter of John Freeman Higginson, an outfitter, of Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire. In 1954 he became assistant secretary of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) at the society's headquarters in London. His responsibilities were varied and Conder, who always claimed to be an amateur, described himself as a jack of all trades, dealing with reserves, prosecutions, and protection work.<br>
<br>The RSPB, which had 20,000 members and few staff, moved from its London office to a country house in Bedfordshire in 1961. The move produced a financial surplus and the consequent opportunity to expand. When Conder became director in 1963 he appointed specialist staff to deal with nature reserves, research, education, publications, film, and financial administration. The competent, enthusiastic team he created built on the opportunities they had, so that when Conder retired thirteen years later membership had risen to over 200,000 and there had been some spectacular conservation achievements. The society had been a major contributor to the successful campaign to stop the use of organochlorine pesticides; ospreys had become established once more as a breeding species in Britain; and the society's list of nature reserves was added to each year. Perhaps more important was the growing realization of the significance of research to successful nature conservation, an applied science that was beginning to be taken seriously by government.<br>
<br>Conder himself took most pride in the campaign against pesticides, but, almost certainly, his greatest achievement was to lay the foundations that made the RSPB one of the world's leading voluntary nature conservation organizations. His greatest disappointment was the failure of the RSPB and the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves (later the Wildlife Trusts) to merge in the 1970s. The result, he felt, would have created a really influential organization.<br>
<br>Although a relatively shy man, Conder was able to communicate his passion for nature and its conservation both in writing and orally. His retirement at fifty-seven, at a time when the RSPB was growing, showed his understanding of the need for leaders not to outstay their usefulness, though one of his staff wrote that &#145;he could have easily gone for another 10 years and would have had the loyal support of his staff&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 18 Oct 1993).<br>
<br>In the 1976 new year's honours Conder was appointed OBE. He was awarded the RSPB's gold medal in 1976 and an honorary MA from the Open University in 1977. He spent his retirement writing, birdwatching, and travelling, sometimes as a tour leader, sometimes as a consultant to overseas conservation organizations, and sometimes on holiday. He spent much of the year in Comberton, Cambridgeshire, and was a regular visitor to Alderney for over twenty years. He died at Arthur Rank House, Cambridge, on 8 October 1993 after suffering from cancer. He was survived by his wife, one son, and a daughter.<br>
