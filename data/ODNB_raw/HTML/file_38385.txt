<span class="headword">Madge,  Thomas</span>  (1786&#150;1870), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister</span>, was born in 1786 at Plymouth, Devon, and was baptized there on 15 July 1787, the son of John and Betty Madge. Little is known of his parents, except that his father, a miller, died when he was about twelve, and his mother placed him in the care of a relative, Thomas Hugo, a surgeon of Crediton. Following education at the local grammar school (<i>c</i>.1798&#150;1803), he commenced training for the medical profession in his guardian's surgery in 1803.<br>
<br>Brought up in the Church of England, Madge started to attend the Unitarian church in Crediton. The preaching of John Rowe of Lewin's Mead, Bristol, influenced him to enter the Unitarian ministry. While this was not to the taste of his guardian, nothing was done to stop him. Madge entered Timothy Kenrick's theological academy at Exeter in 1804, transferring afterwards to Manchester College at York (1804&#150;9). He married, first, in 1819, Harriet, daughter of Benjamin Travers of Clapton, who died on 22 June 1835; they had two sons and a daughter. On 20 August 1844 he married Ellen (1805&#150;1889), daughter of James Bischoff, a merchant, and his wife, Peggy. Their one daughter died in 1872.<br>
<br>Madge's ministry commenced at Bury St Edmunds early in 1810, and he &#145;took his place as one of the most eloquent and able of preachers, a place he maintained for more than half a century&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>, 10 Sept 1870, 593). In 1811 he joined Pendlebury Houghton in the ministry of the Octagon Chapel, Norwich, becoming sole pastor the next year. Being convinced of the truth of Unitarianism as the genuine gospel of Christ, he proclaimed it strongly, thereby causing some secessions, but strengthened the congregation's sense of commitment. He influenced James Martineau, then a young chapel member, who concluded in 1870 that &#145;in my case, early impressions have something to do with the affectionate veneration with which I regarded him&#146;  (Drummond and Upton 1.13). Martineau's sister Harriet, however, saw him as a preacher fitted only for children.<br>
<br>Madge's fame spread, and in 1825 he was appointed assistant to Thomas Belsham at Essex Street Chapel, London. He became minister in 1829, at Belsham's death, of what was then considered the premier pulpit of Unitarianism. He was no administrator or reformer, was seldom seen on platforms, and took no part in politics. The pulpit was his throne: &#145;In the prayers so devoutly offered, and the hymns and lessons so admirably delivered, he often produced a thrilling effect and an abiding impression&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>, 29 Oct 1870, 699). For thirty-four years he preached at Essex Street, attracting listeners, including Charles Dickens, from all walks of life, a power which did not diminish with time. He drew so large and select a congregation that the carriages took up nearly all of one side of St Clement's churchyard.<br>
<br>Madge's attraction as a preacher was not intellectual, but lay in a crystal-clear presentation, combined with earnestness and vitality. Madge saw his success arising from his simplicity of style; there had never been any difficulty, he believed, in understanding what he said. He was considered by many as the leading Unitarian preacher of his time, and it was remarked in 1859 that &#145;his [was a] ministry which for acceptance and popularity had never probably been surpassed in Unitarian congregational history&#146;  (James 237&#150;8). Essex Street Chapel never regained its popularity after Madge's retirement. The congregation declined in the 1860s, and moved to Notting Hill Gate in 1887. Madge's published writings consist mostly of sermons and prayers delivered on special occasions, for which he was in much demand until his death. Twice chaplain to sheriffs of London, he also delivered the address from the Presbyterian divines to the queen during the Crimean War and on the occasion of royal marriages.<br>
<br>Madge became widely known: his son Travers (1823&#150;1866), staying at Ambleside in 1843, introduced himself to Wordsworth, and met with the response &#145;Oh, the son of the clergyman&#146;  (Herford, 22). His traditional, <span class="roman">Bible</span>-based view of the Unitarian gospel led him to oppose Martineau's theological innovations in the 1860s, but he never joined in the religious rancour that was so common after 1850. Madge died at 20 Highbury Terrace, Highbury, London, on 29 August 1870, and was buried in the grave of his daughter Amelia at Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington.<br>
