<span class="headword">Maccoby,  Chaim Zundel</span>  (1858&#150;1916), <span class="occ">Zionist and preacher</span>, was born near the town of Kobrin, Poland, the son of &#145;Simche&#146;. Little is known of his parents, except that they were poor, devoutly Orthodox Jews. Maccoby had a thoroughly religious education, studying Talmudic subjects first in Kobrin and later in Brisk and Prusznin, where he delved into secular subjects; and he became a rabbi. At the age of sixteen Maccoby married Hannah Blumah Belber (<i>d</i>. 1921), whose parents lived in Prusznin. There were four sons and four daughters of the marriage.<br>
<br>As a rabbinical authority Maccoby was not in the first rank. But his powers as an orator were widely recognized, and he found himself in demand as a preacher of extraordinary charisma. In 1874 he accepted a call to become the <i>maggid</i> (or preacher) of the town of Kamenitsk, and though his sojourn there was little more than two years he became known thereafter as the Kamenitsker <i>Maggid</i>.<br>
<br>Maccoby had many followers, but he made many enemies, both among anti-Zionist Orthodox rabbis and within the Russian government of Poland. Though not a supporter of political Zionism, which sought to re-establish a Jewish nation state in the Holy Land (an ambition which he regarded as heretical), he was none the less an early adherent of the Chovevi Zion (&#145;Lovers of Zion&#146;) movement, which merely supported Jewish settlement in Palestine. In 1883 he became the first full-time preacher for Chovevi Zion, and spent the next six years travelling widely in Russia, Poland, and Lithuania to gather support for the cause. This peripatetic activity became highly controversial, the more so as he had no compunction about censuring fellow rabbis for having failed to do anything to alleviate the condition of Jews living under tsarist rule. The Russian authorities eventually forbade his lecturing activities, and in January 1890 he fled with his family to England, where he had previously agreed to serve as rabbi of a small congregation in London's East End.<br>
<br>Maccoby's arrival in London coincided with a number of developments central to the future direction of London Jewry. The practicality of Jewish settlement in Palestine was a matter of wide discussion, and Maccoby played a part in the formation of an English branch of Chovevi Zion in London in April 1890. Militant socialism was spreading among the Jewish poor of the East End. Maccoby preached the virtues of Chovevi Zion, but also spoke out against the vices of socialism and atheism. His ability to draw crowds to his lectures was evident. In 1892 Samuel Montagu, the Liberal MP for Whitechapel and founder (1887) of the Federation of Synagogues in east London, suggested that he finance Maccoby's appointment as official <i>maggid</i> of the federation. Maccoby accepted the post in February 1894 and retained it until his death.<br>
<br>Maccoby's task, for which Montagu had appointed him, was to counter the propaganda of socialists and atheists. In 1895 Theodor Herzl, the founder of political Zionism, made the first of several visits to England, where his ideas found enthusiastic audiences among the Yiddish-speaking refugees. Herzlian Zionists established the English Zionist Federation; in December 1902 the English branch of Chovevi Zion was wound up. Maccoby regarded Herzl as a false messiah, and his movement as a threat to the preservation of Orthodox Jewish values. But in his bitter opposition to Herzl we may detect more than a vague hint of wounded pride. He spoke out ever more vehemently against Herzl, the self-confessed atheist, and his followers, refusing to preach at one federation synagogue because it dared to host a branch of the Zionist Federation. Maccoby's relationship with Montagu and the Federation of Synagogues deteriorated, and he seems to have withdrawn from social gatherings, offering his strict vegetarianism as a pretext. In 1910 his health began to break down. He died of kidney disease at his home, 4 St Agnes Terrace, South Hackney, London, on 4 April 1916, and was buried at the Edmonton cemetery of the Federation of Synagogues. A collection of Maccoby's sermons was published in 1929 under the title <span class="italic">Chayim</span> (&#145;Life&#146;).<br>
