<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cochrane, Sir  Alexander Inglis</span>  (1758&#150;1832), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was born Alexander Forrester Cochrane on 22 April 1758, the ninth of eleven children (all sons) of Thomas Cochrane, eighth earl of Dundonald (<i>bap</i>. 1691, <i>d</i>. 1778), and his second wife, Jean (1722/3&#150;1808), eldest daughter of Archibald Stuart of Torrance, Lanarkshire. He joined the navy at an early age, and was made lieutenant on 19 May 1778 during the War of American Independence. On 17 April 1780, as a junior lieutenant in the <i>Montagu</i> under Captain John Houlton, he was wounded in action off Martinique. Made commander on 6 December that year, he continued on the West Indian station under Sir George Rodney and on 17 December 1782 achieved promotion to post captain.<br>
<br>When war ended in 1783 Cochrane returned to England; he remained unemployed on half pay until 1790, when he was appointed to the frigate <i>Hind</i>. On 26 April 1788 he married Maria, daughter of David Shaw and widow of Captain Sir Jacob Wheate, baronet; the Cochranes had three sons and two daughters. The most notable of their offspring was their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5758/', "Thomas John Cochrane (1789&#150;1872)")</script>, who, in a naval career spanning more than sixty years, was awarded three knighthoods, including a GCB and a KCB, and ended as admiral of the fleet. A daughter, Anna Maria (<i>d</i>. 1873), married the naval officer Sir Edward Troubridge, second baronet, and was the mother of Sir Thomas Troubridge, third baronet, army officer. Under Captain Cochrane's command his nephew midshipman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5757/', "Thomas Cochrane (later tenth earl of Dundonald)")</script> began a colourful naval career in 1793. In that same year, when war began with revolutionary France, Cochrane cruised against enemy privateers off Norway during the spring and summer, then transferred to the <i>Thetis</i> (42 guns), commanding her on the North American station. Accompanied by the <i>Hussar</i>, on 17 May 1795 he fought a well-contested action against four large French storeships, capturing the <i>Pr&eacute;voyante</i> and <i>La Raison</i>, two frigates armed <i>en fl&ucirc;te</i>. In May 1797 he wrote to the Admiralty to request that the name Forrester be dropped from future citations.<br>
<br>In 1799 Cochrane was appointed to the <i>Ajax</i> (80 guns), and in the following year he served in the Channel Fleet under Lord St Vincent, being especially engaged in the detached squadrons under Sir Edward Pellew and Sir John Borlase Warren in the expeditions to Quiberon Bay and against Ferrol. He then joined Lord Keith in &#145;coasting along the shores of the Mediterranean in quest of adventures&#146;, which were found in Egypt. Superintending the landing of troops on the Egyptian coast in February&#150;March 1801 and supporting them with a flotilla of armed boats on Lake Mareotis in August, he earned high praise from Keith and General Hutchinson. At the same time Cochrane proved troublesome to Keith, organizing an opposition clique within the fleet and accusing the admiral of dishonesty  (C. Lloyd and W. G. Perrin, eds., <span class="italic">The Keith Papers</span>, 3 vols., 1927&#150;55, 2.235, 285, 311&#150;13).<br>
<br>After his ship was paid off following the peace of Amiens in 1802, Cochrane entered politics as MP for the Stirling burghs. The breakdown of the peace in 1803 reduced his effectiveness as a politician since, without relinquishing the seat, he returned to sea as captain of the <i>Northumberland</i> (74 guns), which he retained as his flagship when advanced to rear-admiral of the blue on 23 April 1804. Commanding a squadron off Ferrol, Cochrane sent home intelligence on Spanish armament and war preparations&#151;information which led to the seizure on 5 October of Spanish treasure ships off Cape Santa Maria. In February 1805, still off Ferrol, he learned that Missiessy's squadron had sailed from La Rochelle for the West Indies, and simultaneously received orders to pursue. His chase was as fruitless as Nelson's later transatlantic chase of Villeneuve, but he was appointed commander-in-chief at the Leeward Islands and joined Nelson as a subordinate in the West Indies phase of the hunt for Villeneuve, continuing as commander-in-chief after Nelson left.<br>
<br>Cochrane became rear-admiral of the white on 9 November 1805. After Trafalgar the French maintained a <i>guerre de course</i> at sea, and in 1806 as second-in-command to Vice-Admiral Sir John Duckworth he fought the battle of San Domingo (6 February), the second fight against survivors of Trafalgar. The British squadron included seven ships of the line and four frigates. Three of the five French ships of the line were captured and the other two destroyed; three frigates escaped. Alexander Cochrane was awarded a knighthood of the Bath (29 March 1806), a vote of thanks from both houses of parliament, the freedom of the City of London, and a sword of honour to the value of 100 guineas; however, having been an absentee MP for over three years, he was now defeated at the polls.<br>
<br>Still commander-in-chief at the Leewards, he became rear-admiral of the red on 28 April 1808. In 1809 he and Lieutenant-General George Beckwith began a joint campaign against the French in the West Indies, and on 24 February took the island of Martinique, Cochrane flying his flag in the <i>Neptune</i> (74 guns) and leading a fleet of 47 ships and other vessels. A naval general service medal was issued to mark the event, which the participant ships were also allowed to list as a battle honour. The French regimental eagles captured on this occasion were sent back to London and were the first seen in England. Cochrane became vice-admiral of the blue on 25 October 1809; Beckwith was knighted. In the <i>Pomp&eacute;e</i> on 5 February 1810, commanding a fleet of fifty assorted vessels, Cochrane captured Guadeloupe with Beckwith. This brought another naval general service medal for personnel and another battle honour for participant ships. Cochrane was appointed governor of the island, and advanced to vice-admiral of the white (31 July 1810) and of the red (4 December 1813).<br>
<br>War with America had begun in 1812, and in 1814 in the <i>Tonnant</i> (80 guns) Cochrane commanded the North American station, directing (but not actively participating in) coastal operations, including the failed attacks on Baltimore and New Orleans. His last action before leaving Bermuda for Britain on 23 April 1815 was to oversee the withdrawal of British forces from North America, handing command of the station to Rear-Admiral Edward Griffin. On his return Cochrane, who had been made GCB on 2 January 1815, was again unemployed but became admiral of the blue on 12 August 1819. In October 1815 he wrote to the Admiralty expressing his wish to be known as Alexander Inglis Cochrane, which name was adopted in subsequent Navy Lists. Although keen to re-enter parliament Cochrane's alleged interest in standing in the Westminster by-election for this year came to nothing. His last appointment was as commander-in-chief at Plymouth in 1821. He became admiral of the white on 27 May 1825, and on 26 January 1832 he died suddenly in Paris, where he is buried in the P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery.<br>
