<span class="headword">Weston, Sir  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1465&#150;1541), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the eldest son of Sir Edmund Weston (<i>d</i>. before 1509) of Boston, Lincolnshire, and Katherine, daughter of Robert Cammel of Fiddleford, Dorset. By 1502 he had married Anne, daughter of Oliver Sandys of Shere, Surrey; they had a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29121/', "Francis Weston")</script>, and two daughters. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29136/', "Sir William Weston")</script>, who was the last prior of the knights of St John of Jerusalem and died on the same day as the dissolution of his order in 1540, was his brother.<br>
<br>Edmund Weston had been a supporter of the Lancastrians and gained favour at the court of Henry VII, to whom he was an esquire of the body. Richard entered the service of Henry's queen, Elizabeth of York, and his wife, Anne, may have been one of Elizabeth's ladies-in-waiting. She later served Katherine of Aragon. Richard began to accumulate profitable positions during the last years of Henry VII's reign: he was a groom of the chamber by 1505, acquired a number of keeperships and stewardships, and became forester of Windsor Forest and lieutenant of Windsor Castle. Further offices followed under Henry VIII. He was named an esquire of the body and also (like his father) governor of Guernsey and neighbouring islands in 1509, a position he held until his death. In 1510 he was granted the manor of Ufton Pole, Berkshire, which had been forfeited by the attainder of Viscount Lovell. He was a JP for Berkshire (from 1510), Kent (1518), and Surrey (from 1524). In 1511 he was a member of the small English contingent sent to aid King Ferdinand of Aragon in a campaign against the Moors. Knighted in 1514, Weston was made a knight of the body in 1516 and a knight of the Bath in 1518. In 1514 he was among those present at the marriage of Henry VIII's sister Mary to the French king Louis XII. He was named keeper of the swans on the Thames (1517), one of the king's cup-bearers (1521), a commissioner for the subsidy (1523), and a commissioner for the tenths of spiritualities (1535).<br>
<br>In 1518 Weston was appointed to join the ageing Sir Thomas Lovell as master of the wards. Under Henry VII the crown's rights of wardship had been exploited with ever increasing thoroughness, a process which continued under Henry VIII. It was in keeping with this development that when Sir Edward Belknap succeeded Lovell in 1520 he and Weston were no longer &#145;masters&#146; in their patent but &#145;surveyors, governors, keepers, and sellers of wards and their possessions&#146;, with a salary of &pound;100 each  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 3, pt 1, no. 1121 [10]). They were also licensed to call on members of the council for assistance with legal problems. Belknap died a year later, and Weston remained in control of the office. It does not seem to have brought him much profit, since in 1525 he tried to exchange it for the chancellorship of the duchy of Lancaster.<br>
<br>Weston made his bid for the exchange of offices through Cardinal Wolsey. There is some evidence that he was a follower of Wolsey. In particular, when in spring 1519 the cardinal attempted to control the king's privy chamber by ejecting Henry's young &#145;minions&#146; and replacing them with courtiers of a more mature and sober stamp, Weston was one of the latter. The minions soon recovered their former places, but Weston was present at many of the great events of Henry's reign: the Field of Cloth of Gold (1520), the meetings between the king and Emperor Charles V (1520, 1522), the christening of Prince Edward (1537), and the reception of Anne of Cleves (1540). He did not obtain the chancellorship of the duchy, suggesting that his influence with Wolsey was limited, but late in 1525 was made treasurer of Calais, a position he held until 1528. His term there was dogged by financial difficulties and by quarrels with Baron Sandys, the captain of Gu&icirc;nes, but he did at least reinforce the sea defences with a new wharf. On resigning from Calais he was made under-treasurer of the exchequer, and held that office until his death.<br>
<br>In 1521 Weston had been a member of the jury which convicted Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham, of treason. Following the duke's execution Weston was granted his manor of Sutton in Surrey. Here he proceeded to build a great country house that ranks with the king's palace of Nonsuch, Baron Sandys's house The Vyne, and Sir William Fitzwilliam's Cowdray as one of the chief monuments of the early Renaissance in England. He himself was probably responsible for much of the architecture; a few years earlier he had visited the French royal ch&acirc;teau of Blois, then still under construction, and was evidently eager to copy some of its details in his own residence. Built in the shape of a square surrounding a central courtyard, the house has since been altered by the demolition of the entrance front.<br>
<br>Weston sat in the Reformation Parliament which began in 1529. Possibly through the influence of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, he was returned as a knight of the shire for Berkshire. In 1536 Weston's son, Francis, was implicated in the fall of Anne Boleyn. Convicted of adultery with the queen, he was executed on 17 May, the king having refused to grant him a reprieve. Sir Richard remained one of Henry's confidants and councillors, however, and, when the Lincolnshire rising broke out later in the year, he was summoned to attend the king with 150 men. In 1539 William Fitzwilliam, earl of Southampton, visited Weston to see if he would serve again in the coming parliament, but found him sick in bed, protesting that he was more likely to die than perform any further service. He recovered sufficiently to greet Anne of Cleves in January 1540, but died on 7 August 1541, probably at Sutton. His brief will, drawn up on 16 May, included a traditional preamble leaving his soul to the Virgin Mary and made lavish provision for masses for his soul. He left his lands and possessions, which according to an earlier assessment were worth more than &pound;400 a year, to his wife. After her death, because of his son's execution, they were to pass to his seven-year-old grandson, Henry Weston; should Henry die they were to pass to the children of his daughters Margaret, who had married Sir Walter Denys, and Katherine, who had wed Sir John Rogers. The executors, in addition to Lady Weston, were the earl of Southampton and Sir John Russell, the lord high admiral. Weston requested burial in Holy Trinity Church, Guildford, in a chapel he had built for the purpose. If an imposing tomb marked the site of his interment it no longer exists.<br>
