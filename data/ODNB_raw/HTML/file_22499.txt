<span class="headword">Ponsonby,  John</span>, Viscount Ponsonby  (<em>c.</em>1770&#150;1855), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22506/', "William Brabazon Ponsonby, first Baron Ponsonby (1744&#150;1806)")</script>, politician, and Louisa, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Molesworth (<i>d</i>. 1824), and brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22505/', "Sir William Ponsonby")</script>. He sat for Tallagh, co. Waterford, in the Irish parliament of 1797, for Dungarvan, 1797&#150;1800, and for Galway town, in the first parliament of the United Kingdom, 1801&#150;2. He was a handsome man, dissipated, and without political prospects. He had an affair with Lady Jersey, who arranged his marriage to her fifteen-year-old daughter, Elizabeth Frances Villiers (<i>d</i>. 14 April 1866), on 13 January 1803. There were no children of their marriage. Soon after his marriage he had an affair with Harriette Wilson, which she made public. He took to diplomacy.<br>
<br>On the death of his father on 5 November 1806 Ponsonby succeeded him as second Baron Ponsonby, and for some time held an appointment in the Ionian Islands. Canning sent him to South America to please George IV, who resented his success with Lady Conyngham, the royal mistress. On 28 February 1826 he went to Buenos Aires as envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary, and in July 1828 was moved to Rio de Janeiro in the same capacity. On 1 December 1830 he was appointed to succeed Thomas Cartwright at Brussels as joint commissioner of the conference of the five powers on the Belgian question; he remained there until June 1831, being withdrawn partly as a result of the conference's ultimatum to Belgium to accept its terms of separation, partly as a result of exceeding Palmerston's instructions. His dealings with this matter were adversely criticized in <span class="italic">The Guet-&agrave;-Pens Diplomacy, or, Lord Ponsonby at Brussels</span> (1831). But Lord Grey eulogized him in the House of Lords on 25 June 1831. Ponsonby was envoy at Naples from 8 June to 9 November 1832, a trial for future promotion. He was considered for St Petersburg, but rejected, perhaps because his affair with Princess Lieven might have compromised him there. Instead he was ambassador at Constantinople from 27 November 1832 to 1841. There he was an effective if controversial executor of Palmerston's policy. He was rewarded with the Vienna embassy, which he held from 10 August 1846 to 31 May 1850.<br>
<br>Through Lord Grey, who had married his sister Mary Elizabeth, Ponsonby had great influence, but his behaviour as an ambassador sometimes embarrassed the government. He had a lively relationship with Palmerston, finally quarrelling with him in 1849. He was one of the few in the diplomatic corps who could match Palmerston for will, and the latter respected him for it. He was gazetted GCB on 3 March 1834, and, largely on Palmerston's urging, created Viscount Ponsonby of Imokilly, co. Cork, on 20 April 1839. Having published <span class="italic">Private Letters on the Eastern Question, Written at the Date Thereon</span> (1854), he died at the Bedford Hotel, King's Road, Brighton, on 21 February 1855 and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_22501"></a><span class="headword">Richard Ponsonby</span>  (1772&#150;1853), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland bishop of Derry</span>, brother of John Ponsonby, was born in Dublin and educated at Dublin University, where he graduated BA in 1794 and MA in 1816. During 1795 he was ordained deacon and priest, and was appointed prebendary of Tipper in St Patrick's Cathedral. He succeeded by patent to the precentorship of St Patrick's on 25 July 1806, and became dean on 3 June 1817. In February 1828 he was consecrated bishop of Killaloe and Kilfenora, was translated to Derry on 21 September 1831, and became also bishop of Raphoe, as a result of the <span class="roman">Church Temporalities Act</span>, in September 1834. Bishop Ponsonby was a talented, handsome man with a reputation for sloth. He was a notorious gambler and despite his episcopal income of &pound;14,000 p.a. was usually in debt. He married, in 1804, his cousin Frances, second daughter of the Right Hon. John Staples. She died on 15 December 1858, having borne William Brabazon, fourth and last Baron Ponsonby, who died on board his yacht, the <i>Lufra</i>, off Plymouth, on 10 September 1866. Bishop Ponsonby died in his palace at Derry on 27 October 1853.<br>
