<span class="headword">Long <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Campbell]</span>,  Margaret Gabrielle Vere</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseuds. </em>Marjorie Bowen, Joseph Shearing, George Preedy]</span>  (1885&#150;1952), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born Margaret Gabrielle Vere Campbell on 1 November 1885 at Hayling Island, Hampshire, the second of three daughters (the first died very young) of Vere Douglas Campbell and Josephine Elisabeth Bowen Ellis, writer and daughter of a Moravian clergyman. The poverty, deprivation, verbal denigration, and emotional abuse she experienced in youth are detailed in her autobiographical <span class="italic">The Debate Continues</span> (1939). Her parents separated when she was four. Her mother's compromised status as a woman living apart from her husband, her temperament, and her connections to the theatre resulted in a bohemian lifestyle which Margaret despised. Food was often scarce and frequent moves occurred to avoid paying bills. Moreover, the disparaging comparison of Margaret to her attractive and frivolous younger sister undermined her confidence, causing her to withdraw to a life of the mind.<br>
<br>Margaret was not sent to school but was taught to read and write at home. She voraciously accumulated knowledge, developed her artistic abilities, and by early adolescence had taught herself to read French, Italian, and a bit of Latin. Her mother wanted to send her to the Royal College of Art in South Kensington, but she failed the entrance examination. A second try at formal education was an equally dismal experience. At the Slade School of Fine Art she was isolated from other students by her poverty, often went the entire day without food, and failed the first exam. She worked for a time as a research assistant at the British Museum. Her mother then sent her to Paris to study art but did not send money for board or school fees. Isolated from others because of her poverty, she turned to writing for consolation. After rejection by eleven publishers, the eventual success of <span class="italic">The Viper of Milan</span> (1906), a historical fantasy, created further bitterness on the part of her mother, who had long and vainly sought literary fame herself. The book launched a writing career that helped support Margaret's family, and a new identity as Marjorie Bowen.<br>
<br>On 11 October 1912 Bowen married Zeffirino Emilio Costanzo (1882/3&#150;1916), an employee in an engineering and mining company. Although the marriage offered a socially acceptable escape from the turmoil of life with her mother and sister, it was fraught with difficulty. Bowen continued to send money to her mother and sister, leaving herself and her husband poorly off. They settled for a time in Tuscany before returning to England at the outbreak of the First World War. In Kent her husband embarked on a disastrous venture as a poultry farmer, and their first child, a daughter, died of meningitis at five months. Costanzo, who was suffering from tuberculosis, returned to Italy leaving Bowen pregnant with their second child. She was forced to leave her infant son in England while she nursed her ailing husband in Italy. Bowen fictionalized this episode of her life in <span class="italic">Stinging Nettles</span> (1923). After Costanzo's death in 1916 she had a doomed affair with her husband's physician and returned to England. On 4 December 1917 she married Arthur Leonard Long (<i>b</i>. 1885/6), an army officer. They had two sons, and in this relationship she seems finally to have achieved the domestic stability she longed for.<br>
<br>During the decade since <span class="italic">The Viper of Milan</span> Marjorie Bowen had been remarkably prolific, publishing about twenty books, including the supernatural gothic novel <span class="italic">Black Magic: a Tale of the Rise and Fall of the Antichrist</span> (1909), and numerous historical romances such as <span class="italic">A Knight of Spain</span> (1913). Later she turned her hand to novels and short stories with modern situations such as <span class="italic">Stinging Nettles</span> and <span class="italic">The Pagoda</span> (1927), coinciding with the general shift away from the swashbuckling romance. She began a Renaissance trilogy in the 1920s which comprised <span class="italic">The Golden Roof</span> (1928), <span class="italic">The Triumphant Beast</span> (1934), and <span class="italic">Trumpets at Rome</span> (1936), and a further trilogy in the 1930s of the spiritual life of seventeenth-century England, <span class="italic">God and the Wedding Dress</span> (1938) <span class="italic">Mr. Tyler's Saints</span> (1939), and <span class="italic">The Circle in the Water</span> (1939). In 1920 she adopted the pseudonym George Preedy to write more historical novels, including the best-seller <span class="italic">General Crack</span> (1928), made into a film starring John Barrymore in 1929; several biographies, such as <span class="italic">This Shining Woman</span> (1937); a life of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin; and drama. She used pseudonyms throughout her life, she said, in order to demarcate her separate creative personalities. In 1932 she began to use the name Joseph Shearing for reconstructions of nineteenth-century crimes starting with <span class="italic">Forget-me-Not</span> (1932), based on the murder of the duchesse de Praslin, and followed by treatment of the Maybrick poisoning in <span class="italic">Airing in a Closed Carriage</span> (1943). As Joseph Shearing she was similarly prolific and successful; her identity was not revealed until 1942. As John Winch and Robert Paye she wrote children's literature, and as Margaret Campbell her candid autobiography <span class="italic">The Debate Continues: being the Autobiography of Marjorie Bowen</span> (1939). In <span class="italic">Ethics in Modern Art</span> (1939) she reflected on the social function of art and the place of women in the literary arena.<br>
<br>Bowen died in St Charles Hospital, Kensington, London, on 23 December 1952 of haemorrhage due to a fractured skull, the result of a fall at her home at 34 Holland Park, Kensington; her husband survived her. She was cremated on 31 December at Putney Vale, London.<br>
<br>While Bowen believed she necessarily sacrificed her art to write so prolifically in order to earn a living, she has had her share of supporters who believe she should be taken seriously as a literary writer. Edward Wagenknecht has noted that she was a superb storyteller, presenting rich, accurate, and well-researched background for her historical works he ranked her with Wilkie Collins for her skill in the creation of atmosphere. While Wagenknecht believed she was one of the best writers of stories of the supernatural, Hugh Walpole proclaimed her the most important historical novelist of her generation. Befriended by Mark Twain, she dedicated one of her novels to him. Graham Greene, in <span class="italic">The Lost Childhood</span> (1951), credited a reading of <span class="italic">The Viper of Milan</span> when he was fourteen with the awakening of his writing career.<br>
