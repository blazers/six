<span class="headword">Sinclair,  John</span>, ninth Lord Sinclair  (<em>bap. </em>1610, <em>d.</em> 1674), <span class="occ">nobleman and army officer</span>, was baptized at Edinburgh on 29 October 1610, the son of Patrick, eighth Lord Sinclair (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1615), and his wife, Margaret, a daughter of Sir John Cockburn of Ormiston. Sinclair had a charter for the baronies of Ravenscraig and Newburgh and, with his wife, for other lands in Fife granted to him on his marriage to Mary Wemyss (<i>d</i>. 1657), daughter of John, first earl of Wemyss, in July 1631. They had one daughter, Catherine. During Charles I's 1633 visit to Scotland for his coronation Sinclair attended the first of the fifteen parliaments he would attend. A supporter of the emerging covenanter movement, he attended the general assembly of 1638 and was on the committee there which judged on the legitimacy of the general assemblies held from 1606 to 1618. In 1639 he accompanied Balmerino's horse and the earls of Home, Lothian, and Rothes, and Lord Yester in the forced removal of the regalia from the king's house at Dalkeith to Edinburgh. His association with the earl of Rothes continued in their shared command of a regiment, with Lord Lindsay, in the first bishops' war.<br>
<br>In the second bishops' war Sinclair had sole command of a regiment of foot raised from Caithness and Orkney in September 1640 which occupied Aberdeen from the end of October until February 1642. Sinclair himself did not remain with his troops throughout, but made repeated trips to Edinburgh because of his duties in parliament, and on the committee of estates and the privy council, to both of which he had been appointed in 1641. His troops' behaviour while occupying Aberdeen was considered unreasonable by the inhabitants, but that does not necessarily reflect directly on Sinclair, who castigated his lieutenant-colonel for executing a deserter, and discharged the lieutenant-colonel for cruelty in 1641.<br>
<br>In early 1642 Sinclair's regiment was one of those sent to Ulster as part of the Scottish government's response to the 1641 rising. It crossed to Ireland from April 1642 and garrisoned Newry. Sinclair served in Ireland from August 1642 until 1643, when he fell ill. Suffering hardships his regiment abandoned Ireland in February 1644, creating disturbances on its arrival in Scotland. It was attached to the army sent to England that year to fulfil Scotland's military obligations to the English parliament. Again Sinclair was not with his regiment for the whole of their service. He was absent at the beginning of their participation in England, acting as colonel of the College of Justice regiment of foot. In 1645 Sinclair was again on the committee of estates. In England he appears to have made contact with agents of Charles I and, in 1646, was called before the estates to answer charges that he had been communicating with royalists, but was acquitted of the accusations. His regiment returned to Scotland in 1647 and, though there was talk of returning it to Ireland, it was disbanded after further disturbances.<br>
<br>Sinclair was a supporter of the engagement agreed between Charles I and some of the more accommodating of the covenanters in December 1647. He raised a horse troop for the engager army which entered England in the king's cause in 1648 and served with it himself. With the collapse of the engager cause and the execution of Charles I, Sinclair, at some point, joined the exiled Charles II at The Hague. He advised Charles to launch his cause in Ireland rather than treat with the kirk party in power in Edinburgh by 1650. When Charles in fact accepted Scottish offers of support, Sinclair was among those barred from returning to Scotland or having access to the king until he reconciled himself to the Scottish parliament. In defiance of this Sinclair accompanied Charles II's invasion of England in 1651, and was taken prisoner at the battle of Worcester. He was imprisoned, first in the Tower, and later in Windsor Castle, until the Restoration, though account was taken of his ill health, and he was granted liberty at various times. He was also granted a pension in 1656 because of poverty demonstrated by the fact that his forfeited estates had been valued at &pound;906 17<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., and his debts at &pound;1660 10<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. In 1654, while imprisoned, he was excluded from pardon under the <span class="roman">Act of Grace and Pardon</span>. In 1659 he was again granted liberty for illness.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Sinclair was released from his imprisonment, and he was made a privy councillor again in 1661. In that same year parliament made him a commissioner for excise for Fife and Kinross. The last fifteen years of his life were uneventful in comparison to the two preceding decades, and there is little note of him after 1661. In 1666 his daughter, Catherine, who had married John St Clair the younger of Herdmanston, Haddingtonshire, died giving birth to the third of their sons. Their elder son, Henry, succeeded his grandfather as the tenth Lord Sinclair after the ninth lord's death on 10 November 1674 at Edinburgh. He was buried at Greyfriars, Edinburgh, later that month.<br>
