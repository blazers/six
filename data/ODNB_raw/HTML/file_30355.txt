<span class="headword">Aitchison,  Craigie Mason</span>, Lord Aitchison  (1882&#150;1941), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at the manse, Erskine, Falkirk, on 26 January 1882, the second son of the Revd James Aitchison, minister of the United Presbyterian church, and his wife, Elizabeth Mason Craigie. He was educated at Falkirk high school and went with a scholarship to the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated MA in 1903. He was a Vans Dunlop scholar in logic and metaphysics, and Muirhead prizeman in civil law. In 1906 he graduated as LLB with distinction. He was called to the Scottish bar in 1907 and took silk in 1923. In 1919 he married Charlotte Mary Forbes Jones (<i>d</i>. 1970), daughter of James Jones JP, of Torwood Hall, Larbert, Stirlingshire; they had two sons, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101406/', "(John Ronald) Craigie Aitchison (1926&#150;2009)")</script>, became a painter and Royal Academician.<br>
<br>In 1929 Aitchison was appointed lord advocate&#151;the first socialist to hold that great office&#151;and sworn of the privy council. In 1929 he entered parliament as Labour member for the Kilmarnock division of Ayrshire; he subsequently sat from 1931 as a <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95547', "National Labour")</script> member, and had a distinguished career in the House of Commons. In 1933 the degree of LLD was conferred upon him by the University of Edinburgh, and in the same year he became lord justice-clerk of Scotland, with the judicial title of Lord Aitchison. The bare recital of these facts fails, however, to present a true picture of Aitchison's personality and achievements. At the bar he specialized in criminal work. It is not too much to say that he was the greatest criminal advocate in Scotland of his time. He appeared for the defence in many murder trials, and in none of them did the crown secure a verdict. His forensic eloquence, coupled with a pleasing voice and a gracious personality, was unmatched by any of his contemporaries. The cases of John Donald Merrett (1927), of the Oscar Slater appeal (1928), and of Scottish Amalgamated Silks Ltd (1932)&#151;all well known to Scottish lawyers&#151;were the highlights of his career at the bar. The Merrett case was one of alleged matricide, in which, on that charge, he secured a verdict of not proven. In the Slater appeal he succeeded in quashing a twenty-year-old conviction recorded against the accused man. The Silks case, an alleged long term fraud, lasted for thirty-three days.<br>
<br>In the office of lord justice-clerk Aitchison amply justified the expectations entertained regarding him by his colleagues and friends. He was a just and merciful judge. His opinions were luminous and convincing, and they stood well with the House of Lords. Their literary form was unimpeachable. In his later years Aitchison seemed to become in appearance, manner, and personality the embodiment of the old Scottish judges whom Sir Henry Raeburn loved to paint, with their characteristic combination of massive dignity, kindly good humour, and broad humanity. With a love of art and good literature, he was liberally endowed with the gift of friendship, and his friendship was loyal and abiding. A contemporary commentator and friend wrote of him after his death, quoting what Sir Walter Scott said to Lockhart at John Ballantyne's funeral: &#145;I feel as if there would be less sunshine for me from this day forth&#146;  (private information, 1959). Aitchison died in Edinburgh on 2 May 1941. His wife survived him.<br>
