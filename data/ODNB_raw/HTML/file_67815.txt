<span class="headword">Roettier <span class="st"> [Roettiers]</span> family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1620&#150;1784), <span class="occ">die-engravers and medallists</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_77214"></a><span class="headword">Philip Roettiers</span>  (1596&#150;1669)<span class="occ"></span>. He was born in Antwerp on 20 December 1596, was a goldsmith by training and a medallist by speciality; indeed, he was the founder of a dynasty of engravers and medallists who for two centuries graced their art and were of service in various capacities to the kings of England, Spain, and France. During his exile Charles II of England borrowed money from Philip Roettiers, and in gratitude promised future employment to his sons.<br>
<br>The eldest son of Philip Roettiers and his wife, Elizabeth Therm&eacute;s, was <a name="cosubject_23951"></a><span class="headword">John <span class="st"> [Jan]</span> Roettier</span>  (1631&#150;1703), who was born in Brussels (or possibly Antwerp) on 4 July 1631 and trained under his father. In 1658 he married Catherine Prost, with whom he had five daughters and three sons. The eldest, John (<i>b</i>. 1661?), is not known to have been a medallist and is remembered as a suspected conspirator in the plot by Ambrose Rookwood to kidnap or assassinate William III, though the other two, <a href="#cosubject_23948">James [i]</a> and <a href="#cosubject_23952">Norbert [<i>see below</i>]</a>, followed in their father's footsteps. The family was Roman Catholic, John himself being described as a &#145;violent papist&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In 1661 he was duly invited by Charles II to England, not long after he had executed his first known medals, of Leopold William, governor of the Low Countries, and Charles Vanden Bosch, bishop of Ghent. With his two brothers, <a name="cosubject_76732"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Roettier</span>  (1635&#150;1703)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born in Antwerp on 1 August 1635, and <a name="cosubject_76733"></a><span class="headword">Philip [i] Roettier</span>  (1640&#150;1718)<span class="occ"></span>, also born in Antwerp, in May 1662 John was made joint chief engraver at the Royal Mint, at a salary of &pound;325 per annum. This was &#145;over and above their piece-work rates on the coinage and a further &pound;450 [subsequently] granted to them in 1669 out of the coinage money paid into the Exchequer&#146;  (Challis, <span class="italic">New History</span>, 363). This last was a life grant which it was intended should reduce to &pound;350 per annum for two survivors and to &pound;250 per annum for one survivor.<br>
<br>To some, then as now, this was a most puzzling appointment, for it was made at the expense of Thomas Simon, one of the greatest engravers the mint has ever had. Previously it was surmised that this preferment came because Charles II liked the portrait of himself produced by Simon less than that done by the Roettiers, or that because of his service under the protectorate Simon lacked royal favour, or that Simon failed to produce dies quickly enough for the first hammered issue of coins. But the real explanation was given by the master of the mint, Henry Slingsby:<blockquote>When Monsieur Roettier and his two brothers were sent over in the year 1661, and Mr. Johnson [the Roettiers' smith] likewise, they came in opposition to me, Blondeau and Simon, but finding the Roettiers's way of engraving only fit to carry on the new way of coining I turned their friend. (Challis, &#145;Presidential address&#146;, 171)</blockquote>Their &#145;skill complemented that of Blondeau and thus ensured that the Mint could make the best possible use of the newly installed mechanised process&#146;, the screw press  (Challis, <span class="italic">New History</span>, 350).<br>
<br>The three brothers worked together until 1679, John being concerned principally with producing the puncheons and Joseph and Philip [i] with sinking the dies. They were also engaged in engraving dies for the copper coinage of 1672&#150;6, at a halfpenny per pound weight, and in 1675 in producing working tools for the Edinburgh mint. About February 1679 Joseph Roettier left for France, where he became naturalized and rose to be engraver-general of coins. He was married twice, first to Elizabeth Nilis (<i>d</i>. 1680), with whom he had a daughter and four sons&#151;one of whom, George, became an engraver at the Paris mint&#151;and second, on 12 June 1690, to Helen Stonehouse, with whom he had three sons and three daughters. He died in Paris on 11 September 1703.<br>
<br>After 1679 John and Philip [i] Roettier continued their partnership on the same salary until 1685, when, again about February, Philip ceased to be remunerated and subsequently migrated to the Low Countries. There he became engraver-general of coins, and in 1686 he was appointed engraver at the mint in his home town, Antwerp. On 10 February 1674 he married Jeanne Marie de Mangelaer, with whom he had two sons. Philip [ii] Roettier succeeded his father, following the latter's death in Antwerp in 1718, as engraver-general of the Low Countries, which post he held from 1719 to 1732. His brother, Francis Roettier (1685&#150;1743), was an engraver and professor at the Acad&eacute;mie de Peinture et de Sculpture in Paris.<br>
<br>John Roettier continued in office in London, ostensibly alone but in reality, since he had become infirm in his engraving hand, assisted by his second and third sons, <a name="cosubject_23948"></a><span class="headword">James [i] Roettier</span>  (1663&#150;1698)<span class="occ"></span>, born in London, and <a name="cosubject_23952"></a><span class="headword">Norbert Roettier</span>  (1665?&#150;1727)<span class="occ"></span>, born either in London or in Antwerp. Although he wanted to return to Brussels when his employment at the mint ceased on 30 September 1689, he remained in London, drawing his life grant and living in his house in the Tower, where he died in 1703; he was interred in the Tower in 1703. Many dies and puncheons executed by him are now in the British Museum. A list of his principal medals is given in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
<br>James [i] and Norbert did not officially succeed their father as chief engraver but, on the death of the new incumbent, George Bowers, in 1690, in practice they did. Between 1690 and 1695 both men deputized for Bowers's successor, Henry Harris, who took &pound;150 per annum for himself, and left the rest of the engraver's remuneration to them. James, with Harris, also received &pound;100 per annum as engraver of dies for the tin coinage of 1690&#150;91 and possibly also of 1694&#150;6. Norbert left in 1695 for France, where he succeeded his uncle Joseph in 1703 as engraver-general of the French mint. He had married, first, Elizabeth Isard and, second, Winifred Clarke, a niece of the duke of Marlborough. He died at Choisy-sur-Seine, France, on 18 May 1727 and was succeeded by his cousin Joseph Charles Roettier (1691&#150;1779), the fourth child of Joseph Roettier.<br>
<br>Norbert's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_23950"></a><span class="headword">James [ii] Roettier</span>  (1707&#150;1784)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 20 August 1707 at St Germain-en-Laye, France; James Stuart, the Old Pretender, acted as his godfather. He first practised medal engraving but later became a goldsmith and was appointed goldsmith to Louis XV. After his father's death in 1727 he was appointed &#145;Engraver to the Mint of the Pretender&#146;. He travelled to London with the intention of striking medals from the dies of his grandfather John Roettier, and in 1739 he produced medals of John Locke and Sir Isaac Newton. His signature was &#145;Jac Roettiers&#146;. He became a member of the Acad&eacute;mie de Peinture et de Sculpture in Paris and in 1772 obtained &#145;lettres de confirmation de noblesse&#146;. James [ii] Roettier died in Paris on 17 May 1784.<br>
<br>James [i] Roettier deputized alone in London until February 1697, when he was dismissed because he had allowed dies which were in his custody to be misappropriated. He died in 1698 at Bromley in Kent, following a horse-riding accident. He and his wife (1663&#150;1698) had a son, <a name="cosubject_23949"></a><span class="headword">James [iii] Roettier</span>  (1698&#150;1772)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born in London and served as engraver-general of the Low Countries. He died in Brussels on 15 July 1772.<br>
<br>Of the five Roettiers employed at the English mint, John was undoubtedly the most important, being described in 1678 by John Evelyn as &#145;that excellent graver &hellip; who emulates even the ancients in both metal and stone&#146;  (Evelyn, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 20 July 1678). Samuel Pepys, who visited John Roettier in the Tower, recorded that there he saw &#145;some of the finest pieces of work, in embossed work, that ever I did see in my life, for fineness and smallness of the images thereon&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 26 March 1666). All five produced medals, on which they sometimes co-operated, notably on the <span class="italic">Felicitas Britanniae</span> (1660), for which Joseph is credited with the head and John with the reverse. To Evelyn, <span class="italic">Christ's Hospital</span> (1673), struck to commemorate the foundation of a mathematical and nautical school, was a &#145;glorious medallion&#146; and &#145;one of the finest, rarest, and most valuable of all the works of John Roettiers&#146;  (Forrer, 5.167). Other commissions included jetons by Joseph and Philip, the great seal of 1667 by John, and the Britannia for the reverse of the farthing issues, also by John, for which the model is said to have been Charles II's favourite, Frances Stewart, later duchess of Richmond. Dies and puncheons of John Roettiers and his family were presented to the British Museum in 1829.<br>
