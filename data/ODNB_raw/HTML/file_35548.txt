<span class="headword">Plunkett, Sir  Francis Richard</span>  (1835&#150;1907), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, born at Corbalton Hall, co. Meath, on 3 February 1835, was sixth son of Arthur James, ninth earl of Fingall, and Louise Emilia, only daughter of Elias Corbally of Corbalton Hall. Educated at the Roman Catholic St Mary's College, Oscott, he was appointed attach&eacute; at Munich in January 1855, and transferred in July of that year to Naples, where he remained until diplomatic relations were broken off on 30 October 1856. After a few months of service at The Hague he was transferred to Madrid, and in July 1859 was promoted to paid attach&eacute; at St Petersburg. In January 1863 he was transferred as second secretary to Copenhagen, where he served during the troubled times of the war of Austria and Prussia against Denmark. After service at Vienna, Berlin, Florence, and again at Berlin, he was promoted to secretary of legation at Tokyo in 1873, then at Washington, DC, in 1876, and became secretary of embassy at St Petersburg in 1877. He was transferred to Constantinople in 1881, but after a few months of service, during part of which he was in charge of the embassy in the absence of the ambassador, Lord Dufferin, he was moved to Paris, with promotion to the titular rank of minister-plenipotentiary.<br>
<br>In July 1883 Plunkett was appointed British envoy at Tokyo, and while there in 1886 he was made KCMG. In 1886 and 1887 he took part as the senior British delegate in the conferences on the very difficult question of the revision of the treaties between Japan and the European powers. These conferences considered the conditions on which the rights of extra-territorial jurisdiction enjoyed by those powers over their nationals resident in Japan should be abandoned. The conditions agreed upon at the conference were considered by the Japanese government to be too onerous, and it was not until 1894 that a definitive agreement was reached. In 1888 Plunkett was transferred to Stockholm, and in 1893 to Brussels, where in 1898 and 1899 he took part in the conferences for the abolition of bounties on the export of sugar and for the regulation of the liquor trade in Africa. In September 1900 he was appointed British ambassador at Vienna, and held that post until his retirement on pension in October 1905. He was made GCMG during his residence at Brussels in 1894, GCB in 1901, and GCVO in 1903. He was made a privy councillor on his appointment as ambassador, and received from the emperor Franz Josef the grand cross of the order of Leopold on leaving Vienna, where his natural kindliness and urbanity had made him universally popular.<br>
<br>Plunkett married on 22 August 1870 May Tevis, daughter of Charles Waln Morgan, of Philadelphia, with whom he had two daughters. He retired to Paris, where he died on 28 February 1907 in his home, 76 avenue Malakoff, and was buried at Boulogne-sur-Seine. His wife survived him. He was an orthodox career diplomat who reached ambassadorial level but had no major effect on British policy.<br>
