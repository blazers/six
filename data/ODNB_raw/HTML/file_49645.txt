<span class="headword">Fox,  Charles Richard Jeremy</span>  (1921&#150;1991), <span class="occ">writer on jazz and radio broadcaster</span>, was born on 7 April 1921 at 4 Clarence Buildings, Weymouth, Dorset, the son of Harold Fox, at the time an electrician with HMS <i>Gibraltar</i>, and his wife, Martha Mary Warren. The family moved to Bournemouth in the mid-1930s, and Fox lived there until he moved to London in 1954. He developed an interest in jazz in his schooldays and soon began to study and write on the subject. Fox was giving regular record recitals to the Bournemouth Rhythm Club by the early 1940s, helping to formulate many local youthful tastes for jazz; he made a similar contribution in the field of modern literature, of which he was also an enthusiastic follower. Everyone who has written appreciatively of his career has noted his wide and all-embracing tastes; his outlook on both music and literature was founded on the traditional but extended to the most avant-garde. Before he was able to write for a living, he worked for Thomas Cook, the well-known travel agency. During the war years he worked in the drawing-office of the Experimental Bridging Establishment at Christchurch, where the famous Bailey bridge was conceived.<br>
<br>Fox moved to London in 1954, having already established a solid reputation as a jazz critic through his writing in various jazz magazines including <span class="italic">Jazz Forum</span>, published in the 1940s, and he later became a regular contributor to Albert McCarthy's <span class="italic">Jazz Monthly</span>, founded in 1955, which published some of the country's most intelligent writings on jazz until it folded in 1972. His services were soon in demand for the newly created LP sleeves, and he wrote many for the smaller jazz labels as well as for the larger EMI, Philips, and Decca groups, for the latter writing regularly for the London series <span class="roman">Origins of Jazz</span>. He also contributed to <span class="italic">The Decca Book of Jazz</span> (1958) and <span class="italic">Duke Ellington: his Life and Music</span> (1958) (both edited by Peter Gammond), contributing one of the best pieces in the book on Ellington (who was always one of his very special interests) and his recordings in the 1930s; he then collaborated with Peter Gammond, Alun Morgan, and Alexis Korner on <span class="italic">Jazz on Record: a Critical Guide</span> (1960). Charles Fox wrote <span class="italic">Fats Waller</span> (1960; reprinted in <span class="italic">Kings of Jazz</span>, New York, 1978) and <span class="italic">Jazz in Perspective</span> (1969); and collaborated with Valerie Wilmer on <span class="italic">The Jazz Scene</span> (1972) and with Max Harrison and Eric Thacker on <span class="italic">The Essential Jazz Records, Volume 1</span> (1984; 2nd edn, 2000). An outstanding example of his writings on jazz was &#145;Sit down and listen: the story of Max Roach&#146;, an article in <span class="italic">Repercussions: a Celebration of African&#150;American Music</span> edited by Geoffrey Haydon and Dennis Marks (1985). There was a frequent strain of wit in his reviews, a good example being reprinted in Jim Godbolt's <span class="italic">A History of Jazz in Britain, 1950&#150;70</span> (1989). But like others who have become too deeply embroiled in the more temporal forms of journalism and broadcasting, he never got round to writing the really substantial volumes on jazz that his followers would have liked him to produce, or what would surely have been welcome books on his other interests such as music-hall and cricket (he was a loyal supporter of Hampshire).<br>
<br>From the early 1950s Fox was a regular jazz record reviewer for <span class="italic">The Gramophone</span>, and he wrote for <span class="italic">Jazz News</span> from 1951 to 1962. He was also jazz critic at various times for the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, and the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. He interviewed many leading jazz musicians including Benny Carter, Milt Jackson, Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Hines, and Clark Terry for BBC Radio 3's series <span class="italic">Jazzmen Talking</span> and presented a history of jazz called <span class="italic">Jazz in Perspective</span> for the same network, as well as conceiving many individual radio features, of which the most ambitious were documentaries on Jelly Roll Morton and Max Roach and a history of ragtime. From the early 1960s he was the host of the weekly record programme <span class="italic">Jazz Today</span>. In the 1970s he returned to his native Weymouth to live at 40 The Esplanade; he travelled to London each week to record the programme, keeping a &#145;pad&#146; in Bayswater at the home of Alexis Korner and his wife. When Peter Clayton became ill he took over Radio 3's <span class="italic">Jazz Record Requests</span>, but Clayton briefly took over again when Charles Fox suddenly succumbed to a heart attack and died in an ambulance on his way to the Weymouth and District Hospital on 9 May 1991.<br>
<br>Fox's great literary interests were less known. A shared interest in poetry led to a friendship with the poet Christopher Logue, whom he first met in 1949 at a meeting of the Bournemouth Film Society. With the help of Patrick Brangwyn they produced for a short while a poetry magazine entitled <span class="italic">Ninepence</span>. Fox often contributed poems to other magazines, both jazz and literary&#151;a typical example of his crossover interests being &#145;Poem for the Late Jimmy Noone&#146; published in 1947. At this time he wrote and published a children's book. In 1958 he was involved with Logue in the experimental poetry-and-jazz movement and produced a successful album with the backing of the Tony Kinsey Quartet.<br>
<br>The fostering of serious jazz interest on BBC Radio 3 was Charles Fox's natural niche; he was an erudite and scholarly man, bearded and prone to wearing the tweed jackets and woolly pullovers so characteristic of the immediate post-war years, and many may have found him a bit daunting at first acquaintance. But then one discovered a person of great warmth, charm, wit, and humour, always ready to spend generous time on any jazz or literary project. He is remembered as one of the finest writers and talkers on jazz that the British scene has produced.<br>
