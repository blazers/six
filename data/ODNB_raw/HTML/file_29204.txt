<span class="headword">Whichelo,  (Charles) John Mayle</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1784, <em>d.</em> 1865), <span class="occ">watercolour painter</span>, was baptized on 28 December 1784 at St Nicholas's Church, Brighton, the eldest of the five children (he had three brothers and a sister) of Richard Whichelo, brewer, and his wife, Ann, the daughter of Francis Wood, yeoman. He is believed to have been a pupil of John Varley, and of Joshua Cristall, whose style his work more closely resembles. Whichelo was chiefly a marine painter who made studies of the channel coasts in England, and to a lesser extent the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as of the harbours and dockyards of his native land. But he was also a landscapist and an art teacher, and he spent his early career as a topographer in London. He was first known as the illustrator of <span class="italic">Select Views of London and its Environs</span> (2 vols., 1804&#150;5). Some of his drawings were engraved for Robert Wilkinson's <span class="italic">Londina illustrata</span> (1819) and three plates, after drawings by &#145;Whichelo&#146;, appear in E. W. Brayley's <span class="italic">Beauties of England and Wales</span> (18 vols., 1801&#150;15). He is also said to have produced topographical drawings to illustrate copies of <span class="italic">Pennant's Tours</span>, at 5<i>s</i>. each. At this time he lived centrally but in 1823 he moved further out, to Chalk Cottage, Brixton, and later Norwood. From 1834 until his death he again lived in the city.<br>
<br>Two of his brothers, Henry Mayle Whichelo and Richard Mayle Whichelo, served in the Royal Navy, the latter at Trafalgar, and it was as a promising marine artist that John Whichelo was fortunate enough to be given a sitting by Nelson when he visited Merton in September 1805. Whichelo's fine chalk portrait, mounted on canvas, depicts Nelson in vice-admiral's undress uniform, wearing the star of Bath. He is pictured in left profile &#145;with grey hair, grey eye, leathery and weather-beaten complexion&#146;  (Walker, 260). In 1811 Whichelo's large canvas <span class="italic">The Battle of Trafalgar</span> was exhibited at the British Institution, and he returned to this theme in later years. Graves's <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> identifies four artists with the surname Whichelo who exhibited in the mid-nineteenth century, and the potential for confusion in attributing works is made greater by Whichelo's &#145;proved trick of shedding prefixes&#146;, so that exhibition catalogues &#145;show some looseness in recording his name&#146;  (Roget, 1.525). He is listed in the catalogues of the Society of Painters in Water Colours as &#145;J. Whichelo&#146; (1823&#150;9), &#145;J. M. Whichelo&#146; (1830&#150;34), and &#145;John Whichelo&#146; (after 1835). He first appears in the catalogues of the Royal Academy as &#145;C. J. M. Whichelo&#146; in 1810, when he exhibited <span class="italic">View on Brighton Beach</span>. In 1812 he sent <span class="italic">Portsmouth Beach</span> to the Royal Academy. By this date he was described as &#145;Marine and Landscape Painter to His R. H. the Prince Regent&#146;. After 1818 there is no further mention of his position at court. He exhibited at the academy in 1816&#150;17, and again in 1819&#151;on the latter occasion he sent <span class="italic">A Scene from Roderick the Last of the Goths</span> which illustrates lines from Robert Southey. Although the subject matter is untypical of his work, the painting, attributed to &#145;John Whichelo&#146;, is assumed to be his. He sent a total of fifteen works to the academy and thirteen to the British Institution.<br>
<br>On 10 February 1823 Whichelo was one of three landscape painters to be elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours, which was seeking to secure its future by augmenting its numerical strength. Whichelo contributed four sea pieces to the exhibition at the society's new gallery in Pall Mall East in 1823 and remained an associate to his death. He generally sent three or four drawings to the summer exhibitions, besides having some fifty &#145;sketches and studies&#146; in the first four winter shows. In all he sent over 200 works, the majority of them marine paintings such as <span class="italic">Portsmouth Naval Arsenal</span> (1827) and <span class="italic">Rotterdam Boats Passing Dort in a Fresh Breeze</span> (1831). There were also occasional studies of men-of-war at Portsmouth and the Medway. He painted four naval scenes, two of which depicted events of his own time, namely <span class="italic">The Bombardment of St Jean d'Acre</span> (1841) and <span class="italic">The British Fleet, under Sir Charles Napier, Entering the Baltic</span> (1854); the others were <span class="italic">The Glorious Battle of the Nile</span> (1844) and <span class="italic">HMS Victory in the Battle of Trafalgar Firing Her First Broadside</span> (1851). The fiery theme of these two works was also evident in the sketch <span class="italic">Burning of Drury Lane Theatre</span>, exhibited in 1864&#150;5. Whichelo also exhibited five subjects from Jersey in 1854, including a man-of-war coming to relieve a mail steamer in distress off Corbi&egrave;re rocks.<br>
<br>Whichelo's last works were chiefly English landscapes, mostly views from Surrey and the New Forest. He painted &#145;elaborate tree subjects with small figures, in which the foliage, though rather stiff and mannered, was not ill executed&#146;  (Roget, 2.202). He also produced some river views from the Rhine and the Scheldt, and landscapes from Switzerland. One or two works on the coast of Sicily were most probably from sketches made by other hands. Whichelo is described by a friend who knew him when he lived in Haymarket (1838&#150;46) as &#145;a gentlemanlike man, and tall in stature&#146;  (ibid., 2.203). There is uncertainty as to whether or not John Whichelo married, and the drawing-master son that some authorities credit him with was probably his nephew Henry Mayle Whichelo junior. Around 1841 he lived with his sister Ann (or Anne) Rowe and her two daughters at Charles Street Chambers, and a decade later he was living at Ravenscourt Park with the same two nieces. He died at Kensington on 2 August 1865. His drawings and art property were sold at Christies on 10 April 1866. His works are represented in the collections of the Fitzwilliam Museum, the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, and the National Maritime Museum.<br>
