<span class="headword">Lucas,  Charles</span>  (1808&#150;1869), <span class="occ">composer, cellist, and conductor</span>, was born at Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 28 July 1808, the son of a music-seller. He was a chorister at Salisbury Cathedral for eight years under Arthur Thomas Corfe. In 1823 he was admitted to the Royal Academy of Music, where he studied the cello with Robert Lindley and composition with William Crotch. He was made a sub-professor of composition in 1824, and won several prizes. In 1830 he joined Queen Adelaide's private band, and about the same time became music tutor to Prince George (later duke) of Cambridge and the princes of Saxe-Weimar. In 1832 he succeeded Cipriani Potter as conductor at the Royal Academy, and in 1839 became organist of Hanover Chapel, Regent Street. He was for some time conductor of the Choral Harmonists' Society, and from 1840 to 1843 occasionally conducted at the Ancient Concerts. From 1859 to 1866 he was principal of the Royal Academy, and from 1856 to 1865 a member of the music-publishing house of Addison, Hollier and Lucas. He was in much demand as a cellist and succeeded Robert Lindley as principal cellist of the Italian Opera and the Philharmonic Society. His compositions included an opera, <span class="italic">The Regicide</span>, three symphonies, string quartets, anthems, songs, and a cello concertino, and he edited <span class="italic">Esther</span> (1851) for the Handel Society. Several of his works were performed at concerts of the Philharmonic Society.<br>
<br>Lucas married Helen Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1866), a soprano. A Charles Lucas married Frances Short at St Thomas, Salisbury, on 15 March 1832, and may be our subject; Zo&euml; Wilson (<i>b</i>. 1840), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27679/', "Walter Hawken Tregellas")</script>, was described as the third daughter of Lucas and his wife Frances. He died on 23 March 1869 at his home, 9 Louvaine Road, Wandsworth, London, and was buried at Woking. The Royal Academy of Music set up a gold medal for composition in his memory. His executors were his two sons, Stanley and Radnor.<br>
