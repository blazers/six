<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Ede,  James Chuter  Chuter-</span>, Baron Chuter-Ede  (1882&#150;1965), <span class="occ">politician and educationist</span>, was born on 11 September 1882 at Epsom, Surrey, the son of James Ede, a grocer, and his wife, Agnes Mary Chuter. He had one sister. In common with many lower-middle-class shopkeepers in the late Victorian period, Ede's father was firmly attached to religious nonconformity (in the shape of Unitarianism) and to political radicalism, in the form of Gladstone's Liberal Party. In addition to sustaining these concerns, he also inherited from his parents a passion for education and learning. Later in his career he would often be introduced as someone who started life as a teacher. To this he would add the corrective that he began as a pupil, and had been on the side of the underdog ever since.<br>
<br>From his local elementary school (Epsom national schools), Ede progressed to Dorking high school, and then to Battersea Pupil Teachers' Centre, and eventually to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he studied natural science. But lack of money meant he had to leave Cambridge before securing a degree, and he returned to his native Surrey, where he became an assistant master at a council elementary school in Mortlake. Increasingly, however, his energies were directed towards public service and political activity, which in the eyes of his parents were inseparable from their religious convictions.<br>
<br>Ede's political career began to take shape in the Edwardian period. As a forthright critic of contemporary teaching conditions (he was placed in charge of classes of up to seventy pupils), he became active within the National Union of Teachers and was the youngest member elected to the post of president of the Surrey County Teachers' Association. He also became active in local politics. In 1908 he was elected to Epsom urban district council, where he was an assiduous attender&#151;missing only four meetings over the next six years&#151;and where he made no attempt to hide his pronounced Liberal views, which he developed as secretary and agent of the local association. In the summer of 1914 he was elected as Epsom's representative on Surrey county council, but the further advancement of his career was delayed by the outbreak of the First World War.<br>
<br>The war proved to be an important watershed in Ede's life, both personally and politically. He served in the front line with the East Surreys and the Royal Engineers, reaching the rank of sergeant, and while home on leave in 1917 he married Lilian Mary Stephens Williams (<i>d</i>. 1948), the daughter of Richard Williams, a Plymouth doctor. She was herself a teacher in Surrey and became a member of the county council. He also abandoned the Liberal Party in favour of the emerging labour movement, believing it had become a more effective representative of the cause of the underdog. At the 1918 general election he was heavily defeated when he stood as the Labour candidate for Epsom.<br>
<br>In the early 1920s Ede concentrated on establishing himself as a county councillor, and in March 1923 he was returned to parliament after defeating the Conservative minister of health, Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen, by the margin of 800 votes in a fiercely contested by-election at Mitcham. In the House of Commons he was quickly recognized as a knowledgeable speaker with a dry sense of humour. But in a general election held later in 1923 Ede was narrowly beaten in Mitcham, and suffered the same fate in a further contest a year later; his entry into national politics had been impressive but short-lived.<br>
<br>In 1929 Ede secured a narrow victory at South Shields&#151;a seat which had returned a Liberal MP at every election since the <span class="roman">1832 Reform Act</span>&#151;this time by a mere forty votes. He was privately critical of the inability of Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government to tackle mounting unemployment, but voted against the administration only once in parliament, conscious of the party's precarious position in office. Like many colleagues, he was soundly defeated at the election which followed the formation of the National Government in 1931.<br>
<br>In spite of this set-back, the 1930s witnessed a consolidation of Ede's political career. In 1933 he became chairman of Surrey county council and in 1935 he won a handsome victory at South Shields&#151;the constituency he represented without further interruption until 1964. At last, in his mid-fifties, his talents received recognition within the Parliamentary Labour Party, and in 1939 he was appointed to a vacancy on the opposition front bench.<br>
<br>At the time of the formation of Winston Churchill's wartime coalition in May 1940, Ede was appointed as parliamentary secretary at the Board of Education, serving after 1941 under the Conservative minister R. A. Butler. During his five years at the board, Ede played a central role in preparing plans for reform, culminating in the passage of the <span class="roman">1944 Education Act</span>, which introduced compulsory secondary schooling for all children over eleven in the state sector. His expertise was invaluable: in setting out the nonconformist case while devising a settlement for the vexed issue of religious education; in negotiating with the teaching profession; in preparing for a reorganization of local education authorities; and in liaising with Labour MPs.<br>
<br>When later asked what he regarded as his main contribution to the socialist cause, Ede pointed with great pride to his part in drafting the <span class="roman">Education Bill</span> and ensuring its passage through parliament. Wartime reform was later much criticized as local authorities, using the flexibility offered by the act, developed prestigious grammar schools alongside the markedly inferior secondary modern schools in which most children found themselves. In time Ede concurred with the growing view in Labour ranks that continuing inequality could only be remedied by the introduction of a single form of comprehensive education for all children over the age of eleven. But his admiration for the 1944 act remained undiminished. During the war years there were few, either in the Labour Party or the educational world, who questioned the assumption that &#145;parity of esteem&#146; between various types of secondary school was attainable. He regarded secondary education for all&#151;in whatever form&#151;as a great improvement on pre-1939 provision, and nothing could detract from securing a settlement for church schools that had eluded policy makers since the turn of the century. Ede's attachment to the cause of educational reform was such that at one point in the war he rejected the prime minister's offer of promotion to another department. This was an action, he noted ironically, that gave him the distinction of being the only man to turn down a move from the Board of Education.<br>
<br>Ede's administrative ability, and his association with the successful passage of the <span class="roman">Education Act</span>, ensured his promotion to cabinet rank in the Labour government elected at the end of the war in 1945. The new prime minister, Clement Attlee, saw him as a natural choice for the Home Office, combining long experience of local government with knowledge of the judiciary as a magistrate. As home secretary for the next six years he was responsible for a large body of legislation, including measures on deprived children, police pensions, reform of magistrates' courts, and changes to the licensing laws. The most controversial problem he encountered came during the passage of the <span class="roman">Criminal Justice Act</span> in 1948, when he argued against a Commons motion calling for the abolition of capital punishment for an experimental period of five years. The Commons rejected his advice by a small majority. The issue was only defused, temporarily, by agreeing to establish a royal commission on the working of the death penalty.<br>
<br>Ede was also criticized for his handling of electoral boundary changes, which were said to have assisted the Conservative recovery at the 1950 general election. But on the whole he was considered a fair-minded and efficient home secretary, and the esteem in which he was held by members of all parties was one factor behind his appointment as leader of the House of Commons for a brief period before Attlee's government lost office in 1951.<br>
<br>Ede remained an influential figure in Labour politics for several years to come, though successive Conservative election victories in the 1950s afforded him no opportunity of a return to high office. When he eventually left the front bench, he was able to take up the seat in the house traditionally reserved for the opposition spokesman of highest standing. In 1964 he ended his connection with South Shields, changed his name by deed poll to Chuter-Ede, and went to the upper chamber as a life peer with the title Lord Chuter-Ede of Epsom.<br>
<br>Although overshadowed by more powerful personalities at the top of the Labour hierarchy, Ede had been a respected party figure for over two decades. Close colleagues were struck by his tolerance, humour, and deep commitment to what he called the good old causes of freedom and social justice. Those who knew him less well found him to carry the aura of an austere schoolmaster, especially after the death of his wife in 1948. They were a devoted couple and he was much affected by the loss. There were no children.<br>
<br>The public issue which overshadowed Ede's later life was that of the death penalty. Growing evidence emerged in the mid-1950s that a serious miscarriage of justice had taken place in the case of Timothy John Evans, who had been sentenced to death for murder during Ede's term as home secretary. Ede maintained that he could not have granted a reprieve to Evans on the basis of the evidence available to him at the time, and in this he was supported by official inquiries. But his anguish over the case encouraged him to revise his view of capital punishment.<br>
<br>In old age Ede campaigned for the abolition of the death penalty and for a posthumous free pardon in the case of Evans, whose remains he argued should be transferred from prison to family relatives. This was to be the last struggle of a liberal nonconformist of the old school. After suffering from a fall, Chuter-Ede was admitted to a nursing home, Wilmor Lodge, Epsom Road, Ewell, Surrey, where he died on 11 November 1965&#151;one day after the remains of Evans had been transferred from prison.<br>
