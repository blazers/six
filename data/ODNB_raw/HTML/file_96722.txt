<span class="headword">Lane,  Joseph</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1717, <em>d.</em> 1784), <span class="occ">grotto maker</span>, the son of Thomas Lane, was born at Ashley Wood cottage on the Fonthill estate in Wiltshire, but moved to nearby Tisbury, Wiltshire, where he was baptized on 28 August 1717. When he married, on 22 July 1747, Mary Flippen of Swallowcliffe, his occupation was recorded as stonecutter. It is likely that he learned his stonecraft in the quarries of Fonthill, and that in the 1750s he hewed stone for the building of Fonthill Splendens, the great house built by the planter and London alderman William Beckford, who bought the Fonthill estate about 1744. He probably did not turn to grotto construction before 1760, when it is thought that he worked on at least one grotto for Beckford at Fonthill and the cascade at Loakes Manor, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Lane built and decorated the lavish cave grotto at Painshill Park, near Cobham, Surrey, owned by Charles Hamilton. With its astonishing decoration of spar and other crystals on the walls and dripping from the ceiling as stalactites, the grotto was substantially complete by 1765, though work continued for a few years. This was highly innovative work. Although Italian grottoes had some stalactites, usually of <i>spugne</i>, the satin spar stalactites that sparkled in Painshill grotto were something new, as was the extensive use of what is commonly, though incorrectly, known as &#145;tufa&#146;, a pitted limestone (spongestone or honeycomb) that gave a somewhat eerie effect and was used as dressing over a brick core. &#145;Tufa&#146; was used not only on the grotto but also on numerous alcoves and outcrops all over the grotto island, including, most spectacularly, an arch to invite the visitor on to the island.<br>
<br>It is possible that Joseph Lane's son <a name="cosubject_97898"></a><span class="headword">Josiah Lane</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1753, <em>d.</em> 1833)<span class="occ"></span>, who was baptized at Tisbury parish church on 9 September 1753, helped, at a young age, in the work at Painshill. The next important commission saw Joseph and Josiah Lane working in full partnership. The grotto at Oatlands, Weybridge, Surrey, only a few miles from Painshill, had been designed by Stephen Wright for the ninth earl of Lincoln as a two-storey construction with a large banqueting room above and three separate chambers and a corridor below. The grotto was fairly formal architecturally, but in the 1770s Lord Lincoln (perhaps in emulation of, or inspired by, Painshill) had it transformed inside by the Lanes. The upper room was decorated with crystals, ammonites, and shells (possibly by the women of the house&#151;the Lanes did not normally do shellwork), while the three lower rooms comprised a bath room, a dressing or gaming room with zig-zag pebble patterns, and a central chamber simply described as &#145;grotto&#146;, which had the stalactite decoration of Painshill. The connecting corridor contained spar and quartz, with star patterns. Although the exterior remained architectural, some separate rockwork seems to have been added on each side.<br>
<br>The Lanes' practice was centred on Wiltshire and Surrey. Perhaps from the late 1770s came another Surrey commission, the grotto at Wimbledon House, said by J. C. Loudon to be by the same mason as at Oatlands and Painshill and to have borne some resemblance to the Oatlands structure. Wimbledon House belonged to Benjamin Bond Hopkins, who had purchased Painshill from Hamilton in 1773. There is also one commission which is likely to date from somewhere between 1780 and 1790 but where there is no evidence other than style to attribute it to one or both of the Lanes. That is the grotto at Ascot Place, Berkshire, which is considered by some to be the greatest grotto in England. It has a variety of decoration, ranging from large stalactites to patterns picked out in pebbles, both of which were features in the earlier Lane grottoes.<br>
<br>Joseph Lane died in January 1784 and was buried at Tisbury parish church on 28 January. His son undertook the next commission of importance in Wiltshire, the cascade and grotto complex at Bowood, seat of the earl of Shelburne, who became marquess of Lansdowne in 1784. The complex was designed by Charles Hamilton of Painshill in 1781 and executed by Josiah Lane and others from 1785. This composition, consisting of a spectacular cascade with a grotto and tunnels behind it, a hermit's cell further back, and a series of rockwork alcoves and niches stretching in front of the cascade along the stream, shows a new direction and evidence of Josiah's distinctive style&#151;no spar or crystals, but primitive, naturalistic stonework. Josiah is entered in the accounts as a &#145;rock mason&#146;. In 1790 the two-storey tea-house grotto at St Anne's Hill, Chertsey, Surrey, appeared. There is no direct evidence that Josiah was involved, but stylistically it represents a throwback to the stalactite days of Painshill and the stone patterns of Oatlands and Ascot Place. In 1792 the impressive grotto at Wardour Castle, Wiltshire, was put up by Josiah Lane. It sits on a formal turf platform but is very primitive in its construction, though there may have been some waterfall effects inside.<br>
<br>A lack of documentary proof casts doubt on four other possible Lane projects in Wiltshire. An early grotto (thought to have been built about 1750) at Lacock Abbey exhibits some of the Lanes' naturalistic stonework of a later period, while Belcombe Court has a double-decker grotto where the upper level is a sort of open balcony with a jagged stone parapet, and is likely to be post-1777. One of the two grottoes at Wilbury has also been said to resemble Lane work. At Bowden Park the grotto is dated to the 1790s, but has crystals and spar, and like St Anne's Hill harks back to the Lanes' earlier style. In the adjacent county of Dorset the grotto at Duntish Court, formerly Castle Hill, is a candidate for attribution to the Lanes.<br>
<br>The most extensive of Josiah Lane's commissions was also his last definitely known work. This was the unparalleled suite of grottoes around the lake at Fonthill. In all there are seven grottoes (nine if one is divided into three separate units), and there is some mystery as to their dates and how far Josiah was responsible for creating, or at least modifying, all of them. It is probable that Joseph Lane created at least one for Alderman Beckford, but in their present state the grottoes bear the &#145;primitive&#146; trademark of Josiah's later work, and in one case an inscribed signature of Josiah dated 1794. He would have worked for the arch-fantasist William Beckford, son of the alderman. The grottoes range from the semi-formal boathouse-cum-plunge pool through a two-storey &#145;cromlech&#146;, with a staircase, to two heavily natural caves simply carved out of the quarry.<br>
<br>It is unlikely that Josiah Lane worked on any grotto after 1800, although one account states that he was responsible for the bath-and-cavern grotto built at Norbiton Place, Surrey, about 1819. By that time he would have been sixty-six and the strenuous labour involved would have been challenging for his age, particularly if he had not done such work for twenty years. His end was sad: after a career of creating splendour for others at handsome wages he sank into poverty and died in the workhouse at Tisbury in January 1833; he was buried at the parish church on 28 January.<br>
<br>Little is known of Josiah Lane's life or character apart from the fact that he and his wife, Rebecca, had at least three daughters. Some personal information comes from J. C. Loudon in his account of the gardens at Wardour Castle in the <span class="italic">Gardener's Magazine</span> in 1836:<blockquote>He was a native of the adjoining parish of Tisbury, in the workhouse of which he died &hellip; at a great age. He was perfectly ignorant, but certainly had a genius for this kind of construction. He used to do all the work with his own hands, and be paid at the rate of about two guineas a week; but, like other money-getting men with ill-regulated minds, he never thought of making provision for age. (Loudon, 504)</blockquote>For well over a century the Lanes were hardly mentioned except occasionally as labourers who worked on one or two specific grottoes. It was only with the publication, in 1976, of an account of their partnership that serious attention was drawn to them. As a result of recent interest in makers rather than, as traditionally, in designers, both Lanes, and Josiah in particular, are receiving recognition and celebration that are long overdue.<br>
