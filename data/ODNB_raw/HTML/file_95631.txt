<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Briggs, Sir  Harold Rawdon</span>  (1894&#150;1952), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Pipestone, Minnesota, USA, on 14 July 1894, the second of the two sons of Henry Edwin Briggs (1856&#150;1895), banker, and his wife, Georgina Martha Tunnard (1867&#150;1942). In the early 1890s his parents had emigrated to the United States, where his elder brother Rawdon Briggs (1893&#150;1960) was also born. The family returned to England and settled in Bedford, where Henry Edwin Briggs died, allegedly from excessive drink, leaving Georgina to bring up the two infant sons; in 1908 she married George Samuel Jebb. Both sons attended Bedford School and served in the British army.<br>
<br>After attending the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, Harold Briggs was placed on the unattached list for the Indian army as a subaltern on 15 August 1914 and was naturalized as a British subject on 24 August. Attached to the 4th battalion, King's regiment, in March 1915, he fought with the regiment in France, but in 1916 transferred to the 31st Punjab (later redesignated the 16th Punjab) regiment of the Indian army. With his new unit he saw action in Mesopotamia and Palestine. In 1917 he was appointed to command one of the battalion's companies with the rank of acting captain. During the inter-war period he served in India and saw action on its turbulent north-west frontier. Transferred to the 10th Baluch regiment in 1923, he served with it in the 1930 Waziristan campaign. In October 1937 he was promoted to command the unit.<br>
<br>Briggs married, at Shalford, Surrey, on 10 September 1925, Iris Myrtle Grace (<i>b</i>. 1894), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Algernon Winn Chaldecott of the Punjab cavalry. They had one son and one daughter. In 1940 he married Irene Mona Wood (1896&#150;1965), widow of Engineer Commander Alfred Oswald Wood RN, and daughter of Herbert Henry Capper, journalist, of Ceylon.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Briggs saw action in Eritrea, north Africa, and Burma. On 24 September 1940 he was promoted to acting brigadier and placed in command of the 7th Indian brigade. The unit was deployed to Port Sudan, from where it advanced southward along the coast into Italian-held Eritrea. The brigade contributed to the capture of Keren (March 1941) by drawing off Italian units, and played an important role in the subsequent assault on the port of Massawa. The Italians capitulated soon afterwards, freeing up British forces for the north Africa campaign, which was going poorly.<br>
<br>At the end of April 1941 the 7th Indian brigade rejoined the 4th Indian division, from which it had been detached for the Eritrea campaign. Briggs saw action in operation Crusader, launched by Claude Auchinleck to relieve Tobruk in the autumn of 1941. Although Briggs captured two German positions on the Libyan frontier, the operation failed badly. Rommel drove the British back into Egypt, destroying much of their armour in the process. Briggs's brigade covered the retreat. In December 1941 his 7th brigade spearheaded an attack by the 4th Indian division that captured Benghazi, but a counter-attack by Rommel drove him out in January 1942. In May Briggs was promoted and put in command of the 5th Indian division, held in reserve behind the Gazala line. The division fought in the rearguard action at Mersa Matruh, covering the Eighth Army's retreat to El Alamein, where Briggs took part in the first battle (July 1942), though his division was withdrawn before Montgomery's decisive victory in October.<br>
<br>Hitler's drive toward the Caucasus in the summer of 1942 raised concerns about the security of Persia, and the War Office moved Briggs and the 5th Indian division there to augment British forces in the early autumn. However, by early 1943 the failure of the Germans' Caucasus campaign and the crushing defeat of German forces at Stalingrad removed the threat to Persia. In June 1943 the 5th Indian division was redeployed to India, where it joined General William Slim's 15th corps.<br>
<br>Briggs remained with Slim, who was promoted to command of the Fourteenth Army, for most of the Burma campaign. In February 1944 his troops fought in the battle of the Admin Box (named for the administered area British troops defended). In March most of his brigade was airlifted to Imphal, whence it advanced on Kohima, engaging in heavy fighting until June. The battle for Kohima was Briggs's last combat assignment. He was promoted from his brevet brigadier rank to major-general in July 1945 and given administrative assignments in India. Promoted lieutenant-general, he was appointed in April 1946 general officer commanding in Burma, where he gained experience in combating internal unrest. Knighted (KCIE) in 1947, he retired to Limassol, Cyprus, in January 1948, when Burma obtained independence.<br>
<br>Briggs's retirement, however, proved short lived. In March 1950 his old commander William Slim, now chief of the imperial general staff, recalled him to serve as director of operations during the Malayan emergency, with the task of co-ordinating the police and military services. Since 1948 communist insurgents had been conducting a guerrilla war to expel the British and gain control of Malaya. Operating in large units and with little intelligence on the insurgents' whereabouts and intentions, the army had made little progress in combating them. Briggs, who arrived in April, recognized that the key to victory lay in separating the guerrillas who operated in the jungle from their base of support in the Chinese peasant population living along its fringe. His &#145;federation plan for the elimination of the communist organisation and armed forces in Malaya&#146;, put to the British defence co-ordinating committee on 24 May 1950, was soon known as the Briggs plan, though it drew on many ideas already circulating in Malaya.<br>
<br>The Briggs plan created an elaborate committee system to co-ordinate security, and a scheme to establish control over the populated areas including the formation of a home guard in towns and villages. Its linchpin was a massive relocation of Chinese squatter communities to new villages away from the jungle and less accessible to the insurgents. These would be protected and equipped with amenities like schools, clinics, and running water. Disconnecting the active cadres in the jungle from their logistic support among the people would force the insurgents to focus on getting food to survive. At the same time an improving standard of living in the new villages would inspire ordinary Chinese to provide the security forces with intelligence on the insurgents. Intelligence and food denial together would make the cadres vulnerable to attack by small military units.<br>
<br>Although Briggs devised the strategy for victory, he could not successfully implement it, despite the speed of the resettlement programme, by which about 400,000 squatters were moved by early 1952. A divided system of command, which gave the director of operations control of the security forces while the high commissioner (Sir Henry Gurney) retained political oversight, as well as uneasy relations with the police commander, Nicol Gray, hampered the Briggs plan. Gurney was assassinated in October 1951, and Briggs retired a frustrated and disappointed figure at the end of November. He handed over command to General Sir Rob Lockhart, having remained in Malaya longer than the maximum period of eighteen months he had originally agreed to serve. The security situation did not improve until the arrival in February 1952 of General Sir Gerald Templer with a dual appointment as director of operations and high commissioner. Unity of command allowed Templer to energize Briggs's strategy.<br>
<br>Briggs did not live to see victory in Malaya. His health irreparably damaged, he died in Limassol on 27 October 1952. He had been created KBE in the new year honours list of 1952. He served with distinction in both world wars but is best remembered for his service as director of operations during the Malayan emergency. In his memoir <span class="italic">Defeat into Victory</span> Field Marshal Slim provided the best commentary on Briggs's distinguished career: &#145;I know of few commanders who made as many immediate and critical decisions on every step of the ladder of promotion, and I know of none who made so few mistakes&#146;  (p. 166). The Briggs plan, the strategy for victory over communist insurgents, continues to be studied by academics and military officers interested in counter-insurgency.<br>
