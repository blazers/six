<span class="headword">Bagster,  Samuel, the elder</span>  (1772&#150;1851), <span class="occ">publisher and author</span>, was born in Eagle Street, Red Lion Square, Holborn, London, on 26 December 1772, the second eldest of the five sons and two daughters of George Bagster (1739&#150;1819), a businessman, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Denton (1738&#150;1823). He was educated from 1779 to 1783 at the Revd John Ryland's Northampton school, moving in 1783 to a day school at Hammersmith, run by Dr Morgan Jones. After three years he was apprenticed to William Otridge at 134 Strand.<br>
<br>Bagster was overjoyed when on 8 February 1794 his father bought the lease of a confectionery and pastry shop that was closing down at 81 Strand. He commenced business there as a general bookseller on 19 April 1794 and within an hour had sold a forty-five-volume set of Johnson's <span class="italic">Poets</span>. On 19 December 1797 he married Eunice Birch (1777&#150;1877) whom he had met at a preaching rally led by William Romaine. They had nine sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1047/', "Samuel Bagster the younger")</script>, and three daughters; six of the children survived infancy.<br>
<br>Business at the Strand was brisk. In 1813 a humorous incident occurred with the publisher John Murray. Murray had contacted Bagster by letter, with a detailed proposition about some books. Bagster then called on Murray at Albemarle Street to explain why he would not be able to take on the venture. Murray was out, so Bagster left a note: &#145;Finding you out&#151;I decline your offer, S.B.&#146; A few hours later a distraught Murray rushed in to see Bagster, spluttering, &#145;Pray Sir! What have you found me out in doing?&#146; After Bagster explained, the two laughed at the misunderstanding.<br>
<br>Bagster was determined to meet the need for inexpensive polyglot bibles. A Hebrew <span class="roman">Bible</span> and <span class="roman">Septuagint</span>, both in foolscap octavo, soon appeared, but the production of English bibles was a monopoly in the United Kingdom, confined to the king's printers in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and to the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. However, the patent did not apply to bibles with printed notes. In 1816 Bagster produced <span class="italic">The English Version of the Polyglot Bible</span> with a preface by T. Chevalier and over 60,000 parallel references, most selected and all verified by Bagster. He also attended to the minutest detail, even down to the choice of thread for sewing the sheets together.<br>
<br>In 1816 Bagster moved his premises to 16 Paternoster Row. The following year saw the issue of the <span class="italic">Biblia sacra polyglotta Bagsteriana</span>, which was completed in four volumes. It was a very thorough production and included the prolegomena of Dr Samuel Lee, the Hebrew <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, the Samaritan <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>, the <span class="roman">Septuagint</span> Greek version of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, the Latin <span class="roman">Vulgate</span>, the authorized English 1611 version, the Greek <i>textus receptus</i> of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, and the Peshito or ancient Syriac version. Two other forms of the English <span class="roman">Bible</span> were issued, beginning the <span class="roman">Facsimile Series</span>. The publication of the polyglot was followed in 1821 by an octoglot edition of the liturgy of the Church of England; this Bagster presented to George IV in the year of its publication. In 1828 the archbishop of Canterbury, William Howley, presented Bagster to William IV.<br>
<br>A two-day fire destroyed the building at Paternoster Row on 1 and 2 March 1822. The stock, too, was all but ruined. Only the deeds and twenty-three copies of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> were preserved. Inadequate insurance cover with the Sun Fire company raised &pound;500 and a further &pound;140 was gained by selling 20 tons in weight of ruined papers. To recover from the shock of the fire Bagster and his wife travelled around Europe in 1823, returning in September.<br>
<br>A friendship and working relationship with the self-taught orientalist William Greenfield began in 1822. In 1827 Bagster's <span class="italic">Comprehensive Bible</span>, edited by Greenfield, with 4000 illustrative notes, 500,000 marginal references, and a general introduction, was published. A number of other scholarly biblical works, all edited by Greenfield, were printed by Bagster. When Greenfield died Bagster wrote an account of his life in the <span class="italic">Imperial Magazine</span> (1834). The firm's motto, <i>Multae terricolis linguae, coelestibus una</i> (&#145;Many tongues for those on earth, one for those in heaven&#146;), believed to be by Greenfield, was inscribed in both Greek and Latin on Greenfield's tomb.<br>
<br>In 1837 Bagster encouraged Isaac Pitman (1813&#150;1897) to invent a new shorthand system. <span class="italic">Stenographic Sound-Hand</span> was the result, and established Pitman's reputation. Other notable works published by Bagster include <span class="italic">The English Hexapla</span> (1841) containing six translations of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>: those of Wyclif (1380), Tyndale (1534), and Cranmer (1539), and the Genevan (1557), the Anglo-Rhemish (1582), and the King James (1611) versions. They were arranged side by side for easy comparison and reference. Also included was a Greek version and an account of the English translations. This led to Bagster's publishing an account tracing the history of the English version of the scriptures from the Anglo-Saxon to the 1611 translation. His <span class="italic">Daily Light on the Daily Path, a Devotional Textbook</span> (1841) proved popular.<br>
<br>Samuel Bagster died at his home at Old Windsor, Berkshire, on 28 March 1851 and was buried in April in the family vault at Abney Park cemetery, Stoke Newington, Middlesex. His wife survived him by some twenty-six years, reaching the age of 100. Jonathan (1813&#150;1872), his tenth child, followed him as senior member of the firm.<br>
