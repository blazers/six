<span class="headword">Radcliffe <span class="st"> [Radclyffe]</span>,  Charles Edward</span>  (1774&#150;1827), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the third son of Edward Radclyffe of Barnsley (<i>b</i>. 1728) and his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of William Adamson of Milton, Yorkshire. He received his first commission as adjutant of the 1st dragoons (Royals) on 11 October 1797, having previously served under the duke of York in the campaign of 1794. He was made cornet on 12 April 1799, lieutenant on 4 May 1800, and captain on 1 December 1804. He embarked for the Peninsula with the Royals in September 1809, and in the following June he was appointed brigade major to General Slade's brigade, which consisted at that time of the Royals and the 14th dragoons. He continued in this position up to the battle of Toulouse in 1814, being present at Busaco, Fuentes d'O&ntilde;oro, Vitoria, and various minor engagements. After the action at Maquilla on 11 June 1812, in which Slade's brigade (Royals and 3rd dragoon guards) was routed by Lallemand and driven in confusion for 6 miles with a loss of 150 men, Slade reported that he was particularly indebted to Radcliffe for his assistance in rallying the men. As a result of his experience in the war Radcliffe submitted a strong recommendation that British troopers should be taught to use the point instead of the edge of their swords, and published a small work on the subject.<br>
<br>Radcliffe was employed as assistant adjutant-general of cavalry after the Peninsular War. He became a brevet major on 4 June 1814, and on 25 September was made brigade major to the inspector-general of cavalry. In 1815 he went to Belgium with his regiment, which formed part of the famous Union brigade. His squadron constituted the rearguard of the brigade in the retreat from Quatre Bras on 17 June, and he was thanked for his conduct by Sir William Ponsonby. He was specially praised by Ponsonby's successor, Colonel Clifton, for his part in the great cavalry charge at Waterloo the following day. He was severely wounded by a bullet in the knee, which could not be extracted and caused him much pain for the rest of his life. He was given a brevet lieutenant-colonelcy, dating from the day of the battle.<br>
<br>Radcliffe was placed on half pay on 20 April 1820, and was appointed brigade major to the inspector-general of cavalry. &#145;He was a dexterous swordsman, an accomplished officer, and an able tactician &hellip; a warm and sincere friend, a conscientious Christian, and a brave man&#146;, wrote General de Ainslie, historian of the Royals.<br>
<br>Radcliffe married in 1800 Mary, eldest daughter of Henry Crockett, of Littleton Hall, Staffordshire, who died a week before him. He died at Connaught Square, London, on 24 February 1827. His only son, the Revd Charles Edward Radclyffe (<i>c</i>.1801&#150;1862), had a son, also Charles Edward Radclyffe, of Little Park, Hampshire.<br>
