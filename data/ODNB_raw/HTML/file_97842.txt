<span class="headword">Esmonde, Sir  Thomas Henry Grattan</span>, eleventh baronet  (1862&#150;1935), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was born on 21 September 1862 in Pau, France, the eldest of seven children of Sir John Esmonde, tenth baronet (1826&#150;1876), Liberal and Home Rule MP for Waterford County from 1852 to 1876, and his wife, Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1880), daughter of Henry Grattan the younger, Liberal and Repeal MP for Dublin City, 1826&#150;30, and Meath, 1831&#150;52. His paternal grandfather, Sir Thomas Esmonde, ninth baronet (1786&#150;1868), was active in the Catholic Association and was Liberal MP for Wexford County, 1841&#150;7. Esmonde physically resembled his maternal great-grandfather, Henry Grattan. He was also descended from John Esmonde (son of the seventh baronet), a United Irishman hanged in 1798, a fact that was frequently cited during Esmonde's participation in the centenary of the 1798 rising. A Catholic gentry family of Norman descent, the Esmondes lived at Ballynastragh House near Gorey, co. Wexford. In 1876 they owned over 8000 acres in Wexford, Wicklow, Offaly, Tipperary, Longford, Kilkenny, and Waterford. Esmonde later celebrated his family's military traditions in a brief family history, <span class="italic">Gentlemen! the Queen!</span>, published in 1926 under the pseudonym A. Norman.<br>
<br>Esmonde was educated by tutors in France and at Oscott College, Birmingham, where he was still a pupil when he succeeded his father in the baronetcy. His nationalist views were influenced by one of his guardians, Canon O'Neill, parish priest of Killanerin. From 1880 to 1886 he was a lieutenant in the 6th brigade of the south Irish division, Royal Artillery militia (Waterford). In the early 1880s Esmonde antagonized his fellow landlords by announcing his support for Charles Stewart Parnell, the leader of the Irish National Land League. In 1885 he was elected as Home Rule MP for Dublin County South, becoming the youngest member of the House of Commons. At this time he resigned from the Kildare Street Club, which he rejoined in 1922. In 1887 he was deposed as high sheriff of Waterford for nominating a sub-sheriff whom the Unionist government found unacceptable. He then participated in resistance to evictions at Coolgreany, co. Wexford (1887), and went on fund-raising tours to America (1888) and South Africa, Australasia, and California (1890). He described the latter trip in <span class="italic">Around the World with the Irish Delegates</span> (1892). On 21 July 1891 Esmonde married Alice Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1922), daughter of Patrick Donovan of Frogmore, Tralee, co. Kerry. They had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Following the split in the Home Rule Party, in 1891, Esmonde became an anti-Parnellite. In the 1892 general election he was defeated in Dublin South but returned for West Kerry. In the factional rivalries of the 1890s he generally sided with T. M. Healy against John Dillon, but was regarded as a waverer. During the 1900 general election, as William O'Brien's United Irish League purged Healyite MPs, Esmonde unseated Healy's brother Thomas as MP for North Wexford. (He was also returned for West Kerry but vacated the seat.) He strengthened his Wexford political base by participation in local government and by using his National Bank and Dublin and South-Eastern Railway directorships to employ constituents' sons. He prided himself on having given all the local employment he could in the Gorey area by tilling his land rather than setting it to pasture; he built fifty houses and planted over one million trees. In 1899 he became the first chairman of Wexford county council (1899&#150;1909) and established the general council of county councils under his chairmanship to co-ordinate matters of common concern.<br>
<br>In 1900 Esmonde became chief whip of the reunited Nationalist Party under the leadership of John Redmond. He was a raconteur of considerable charm, well-liked even by political opponents, and an accomplished parliamentary speaker and tactician: the journalist Sir John Foster Fraser spoke of his &#145;Christ-like character&#146; and a Conservative MP called him &#145;straight as a string&#146;  (<span class="italic">Irish Independent</span>, 16 Sept 1935, 7). Some of his party colleagues, however, distrusted his perceived ambitions and powerbase in the general council. On account of his social standing, financial independence, and descent from Grattan, Esmonde was sometimes seen as a potential leader. Arthur Griffith's radical nationalist Sinn F&eacute;in party viewed the general council as an embryonic Irish parliament, and Esmonde invested in a pro-Sinn F&eacute;in newspaper, the <span class="italic">Enniscorthy Echo</span>. In 1907 Esmonde endorsed Sinn F&eacute;in in protest against alleged subservience of the Irish Parliamentary Party to the Liberal government. The Irish Parliamentary Party deposed Esmonde from the general council and mounted a campaign in his constituency spearheaded by his fellow Wexfordman John Redmond. Faced with possible defeat, Esmonde returned to the Irish Party in 1908; he remained MP for North Wexford until defeated by Sinn F&eacute;in in 1918.<br>
<br>In 1920 Esmonde resigned as JP and DL for co. Wexford in protest against the detention of Terence MacSwiney. From 1922 to 1934 he was an Irish Free State senator, and he was chairman of the Irish board of the National Bank until 1933. In March 1923, during the Irish civil war, Ballynastragh House was burnt by republicans, destroying historical relics and a valuable archive (the art collection was saved). Esmonde, already saddened by the loss of his wife in December 1922 and his younger son, John (who had joined the Royal Navy and died at the battle of Jutland in 1916), experienced this as a major personal trauma. This was compounded by a long and painful legal process after which Esmonde received 60 per cent of what he had originally claimed and felt he had been treated &#145;as a criminal during his trial&#146;  (Dooley, 204). Most of his landed property had meanwhile been sold under the <span class="roman">Land Purchase Acts</span>.<br>
<br>On 22 September 1924 Esmonde married the portrait painter Anna Frances Levins, (<i>d</i>. 1941), daughter of Peter Levins, architect, of Mount Hope (New York) and Drogheda. She accompanied him on annual Canadian hunting expeditions and art-collecting forays and published his books under a private imprint, the Levins Press. In the &#145;golden age&#146; of aristocratic shooting, Esmonde was an enthusiastic traveller, fisherman, and big-game hunter, recording his activities in <span class="italic">Hunting Memories of Many Lands</span> (1920, rev. 1925) and <span class="italic">More Hunting Memories</span> (1930).<br>
<br>Esmonde was appointed a chamberlain of the Vatican household in 1898, later becoming senior privy chamberlain of the Sword and Cape. He headed the Irish <i>langue</i> of the papal order of the Holy Sepulchre, from its establishment in 1908, as a knight grand cross; he was prominent in Irish-linked Vatican ceremonies (such as the 1920 beatification of Oliver Plunkett) and the 1932 Dublin eucharistic congress. He died at his home, 84 St Stephen's Green, Dublin, on 15 September 1935, after a prolonged illness and was buried on 17 September at the Lymbrick graveyard, Kilcavan, near Gorey, co. Wexford. He was considerably more competent as politician and businessman than his published writings suggest, but his abilities none the less fell short of his aspirations.<br>
<br>Esmonde's final will, made in July 1928, leaving his property to his second wife, was unsuccessfully challenged in the Dublin high court by the eldest son from his first marriage and his successor in the baronetcy, <a name="cosubject_97842"></a><span class="headword">Sir Osmond Thomas Grattan Esmonde</span>, twelfth baronet  (1896&#150;1936)<span class="occ"></span>. The latter was born at Gorey, co. Wexford, on 4 April 1896 and educated at Downside Abbey and Balliol College, Oxford, where he was a pupil of the Catholic tutor F. F. Urquhart, and took a third in modern history in 1917. Active in Sinn F&eacute;in from 1918, he was a republican envoy to the USA and the dominions in 1920&#150;21 (thus following his father's example as an Irish nationalist envoy). He was refused permission to disembark in Australia, in March 1921, following his refusal to take the oath of allegiance and loyalty to the crown, and was subsequently deported from Canada after being arrested for &#145;sedition&#146; in Vancouver. He was Cumann na nGaedheal and Fine Gael TD for Wexford from 1923 to 1927 and again, after a short interval, from 1927 until his death. In 1927 he became estranged from his father, who complained that he had taken to drink. In May 1933, in a publicity stunt to ridicule De Valera's rural policy and the Irish government's proposal to remove the statue of Queen Victoria from outside Leinster House in Dublin, Esmonde placed a wreath of cauliflowers and leeks at the foot of the statue, accompanied by a fellow Cumann na nGaedheal TD wearing a peasant smock and holding a bunch of rhubarb to represent a mace. He was later allegedly involved with Francis Stuart in a harebrained plot to stage a coup and install a member of the O'Neill family as king of Ireland, but this progressed very little beyond fantasy. Latterly in poor health, he died suddenly of a heart attack in Dublin on 22 July 1936, less than three weeks after the high court upheld his father's will. As he was unmarried, the baronetcy passed to his uncle, Sir Laurence Grattan Esmonde, thirteenth baronet (1863&#150;1943), a barrister, who had served with the British forces in the South African War and in the First World War, holding the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
