<span class="headword">Barton,  Robert</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Hob  a Barton]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1540), <span class="occ">sea captain and administrator</span>, known to the English as the pirate Hob a Barton, was one of three sons of John Barton, sea captain in Leith, the port of Edinburgh. Some time prior to 1476 his father's ship and goods were captured by Portuguese ships. John senior was dead by 1494, when James IV granted Robert and his brother John letters of marque against the Portuguese while not authorizing their use. In 1497 James employed Robert to escort Perkin Warbeck on his departure from Scotland. Over the next ten years he undertook various commissions for the king in France and Flanders, including purchase of ships and naval supplies. He was also involved in James's shipbuilding schemes in Scotland. His trading ventures brought him considerable wealth which he invested in property, notably the lands of Over Barnton, acquired from the crown in 1508.<br>
<br>In July 1507 James renewed the letters of marque in favour of Robert and John and their brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1594/', "Andrew Barton")</script>. In 1508 Robert, having captured a Portuguese ship, was arrested in the Scottish staple port of Veere and was released only after strong protests by James. Although the letters of marque were suspended in June 1510, the Bartons continued their depredations, including seizure of goods belonging to English merchants. After Andrew's death in 1511 Robert took service under the French flag and renewed his attacks on English shipping. He was still involved with James IV's navy and in May 1513 took command of a new Scottish ship, the <i>Lion</i>, at Honfleur. His surviving brother, John, who sailed with the Scottish fleet to France in July 1513, died later that year.<br>
<br>Early in 1514 the <i>Lion</i> had to take refuge in Corunna, where Barton and an envoy sent by the Scottish council to John Stewart, duke of Albany, were taken prisoner, though they were released when France and Spain agreed a truce. In the following year Barton returned to France to escort Albany to Scotland. On 12 October 1516 Albany, as governor of Scotland, appointed Barton comptroller, responsible for collecting revenues from the property (crown lands and customs) and defraying the cost of the king's and governor's households. Though Gavin Douglas denounced the appointment of &#145;ane very pyrett and sey-revare&#146; as comptroller  (BL, Cotton MS Caligula B.iii, fol. 311), Barton's acumen and private resources enabled him to hold the office far longer than any of his predecessors. In 1519 he earned the gratitude of the queen mother, Margaret Tudor, by lending her his own money when she was on the point of pawning her jewels and unable to pay her household expenses. Nevertheless, internal unrest and intermittent hostilities with England depressed crown revenues, while expenditure on the king, governor, and queen mother was difficult to contain. Following James V's assumption of personal rule in July 1524 his household expenditure outstripped Barton's ability to fund it. On 30 July 1525 Barton warned that the crown's property could not sustain the burden and protested that whatever might happen in future should not be laid to his charge since &#145;he has done his exact diligence, spendit his awn geire and may sustene na forrare&#146;  (<span class="italic">APS</span>, <i>1424&#150;1567</i>, 296). On 17 August 1525 James Colville replaced him as comptroller.<br>
<br>Approached by the deposed Christian II to assist him in recovering the throne of Denmark, Barton had agreed to provide a small fleet of ships. Though this does not appear to have materialized, his heirs were to claim he had spent money that had not been repaid. In 1527 he procured the release of some of Christian's sailors arrested in Scotland, receiving arms and munitions from Christian's chancellor as security for his expenditure. His plans for assisting Christian were frustrated by James V's seizure of the munitions for use against the earl of Angus and his own return to office on Colville's resignation.<br>
<br>On 6 March 1529 James appointed Barton treasurer, comptroller, great custumar, master of the coin, master of the artillery, and conservator of the mines of Scotland, to which he added custumar of Edinburgh and chamberlain-depute of Galloway. Though these were the most extensive financial powers held by any subject since the 1420s, they were undermined by the priority given to repaying Colville and a previous treasurer, Sir John Campbell. Moreover, James had embarked on an expensive building programme for the royal palaces. By August 1530 Barton's deficit as comptroller had risen to &pound;7467 Scots, equivalent to a year's net income from the property. On 9 September Barton was again replaced by Colville as comptroller and soon afterwards by William Stewart as treasurer. By December 1530 Barton was in serious difficulties with his creditors, especially royal officers and servants who were distraining his lands and goods for payment of sums that had been allowed in his accounts. Because these were really the king's debts, the council gave Barton protection until he was repaid. Although repayment in annual instalments was promised, these came only intermittently. In July 1536 James granted protection to Barton, who was &#145;of gret age, febill and vaik in persoun&#146;  (Hannay, <span class="italic">Acts</span>, 456), probably so that he could accompany the king to France. Nevertheless, in June 1538 the lords of council ruled that this protection was invalid. They found Barton guilty of deforcing a royal officer acting for one of his creditors, though their sentence of escheat and imprisonment was not carried out. Barton is recorded as still living on 27 February 1540, but he had died by 23 March following, when James V replied to a demand by Christian II's daughter, the countess palatine of the Rhine, for the goods entrusted to Barton. Professing ignorance of the matter, James claimed he would have seen to restitution, had it not been that Barton was dead and had her envoy been willing to wait to sue his heirs. In 1541 Barton's widow and his eldest son John renounced sums still due to him from James V in return for a pension for two of his younger sons. About that time John Barton obtained renewal of the letters of marque against the Portuguese. They were suspended by the privy council in 1561 and finally revoked by parliament in 1563.<br>
<br>Barton's first wife, Elizabeth Jameson, died possibly before 1507 and certainly by 1509, the probable year of his second marriage, to Elizabeth Crawford, daughter of Thomas Crawford of Bonnington and widow of Gilbert Edmonston, sea captain, of Leith. From his first marriage Barton had three sons, John Barton of Duddingston, Henry, and James; and a daughter, Margaret, who married James Sandilands of Calder. In 1511 he had granted all his lands to Robert, his son from his second marriage, who married his ward, Barbara Mowbray, the heiress of Barnbougle, and took the name of Mowbray.<br>
