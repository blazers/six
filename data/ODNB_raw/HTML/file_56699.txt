<span class="headword">Mitchell,  Gladys Maude Winifred</span>  (1901&#150;1983), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 19 April 1901 in Crescent Road, Cowley, Oxford, the eldest daughter of James Mitchell, of Scottish ancestry, and Annie Julia Maude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Simmonds. She moved with her family in 1909 to the Brentford and Isleworth area of Middlesex, where she received her early education at the Rothschild School in Brentford, and the Green School in Isleworth. She studied at Goldsmiths' College, London (1919&#150;21), and later attended University College, London, where she gained an external diploma in European history in 1926 and qualified as a teacher.<br>
<br>Gladys Mitchell became a distinguished writer of detective novels, a survivor of the &#145;golden age&#146; of detective fiction of the 1920s and 1930s which included such writers as Dorothy Sayers, Agatha Christie, and G. K. Chesterton. Like them, she was a member of the Detection Club. In 1976 she won the Crime Writers' Association silver dagger award. During much of her writing career she was also a dedicated teacher of history, athletics, English, and Spanish at several girls' schools in Middlesex. She taught at St Paul's School, Brentford (1921&#150;5), and at St Ann's Senior Girls' School, Ealing (1925&#150;39). After a period of ill health she took up a post at Brentford Senior Girls' School in 1941 and resigned in 1950 with the intention of retiring. Three years later, having devoted herself to writing, she returned to teaching, this time at the Matthew Arnold School, Staines, where she remained until 1961 when she finally retired.<br>
<br>Mitchell, who also wrote under the pseudonyms Stephen Hockaby and Malcolm Torrie, began writing early. Undeterred by the rejection of her first four novels, she launched her long and prolific literary career with <span class="italic">Speedy Death</span> (1929) and continued to produce at least one book a year for the rest of her life. This first book introduced her famous character Mrs Beatrice Adela Lestrange Bradley (later Dame Beatrice), a sleuth and &#145;psychiatric consultant to the Home Office&#146;. The formidable Mrs Bradley, with her unattractive physical features, claw-like hands, yellow skin, and cackling laugh, was sometimes nicknamed Mrs Croc. She appears in all the crime novels written under Gladys Mitchell's name. Like her creator, Bradley possessed a strong sense of justice, socially progressive views, and a warm understanding of humanity. Characteristic features of Mitchell's novels include sustained tension, improbable plots, black humour, and eccentric themes with frequent use of folklore and the supernatural. In <span class="italic">Speedy Death</span>, a double murder story, Bradley commits the second murder herself but is acquitted with the assistance of her defence counsel, who is also her son; the victim of the first murder, known as a male explorer, turns out to be a woman.<br>
<br>Mitchell's settings varied enormously but she frequently used the enclosed atmosphere of schools, as in <span class="italic">Death at the Opera</span> (1934), <span class="italic">St Peter's Finger</span> (1938), <span class="italic">Laurels are Poison</span> (1942), and <span class="italic">Faintley Speaking</span> (1954), while <span class="italic">Spotted Hemlock</span> (1958) is set in two adjacent agricultural colleges, one male and one female. <span class="italic">The Rising of the Moon</span> (1945) recalls Mitchell's childhood in Brentford. As the novels progress, various members of Bradley's family and associates begin to appear, and reappear, such as her son Ferdinand Lestrange, a barrister, and Carey Lestrange, her pig farmer nephew. Sally Lestrange, Bradley's granddaughter, is the key figure in <span class="italic">Winking at the Brim</span> (1974), a comic work in which the Loch Ness monster eliminates the culprit. A grandniece, Hermione Lestrange, appears in <span class="italic">The Death-Cap Dancers</span> (1981), where the suspect is killed by a boar on her father's pig farm. George, the faithful chauffeur, is in frequent attendance, as is Laura, Bradley's secretary, whose investigative skills are put to good use in the Holmesian satire <span class="italic">Watson's Choice</span> (1955). While Mitchell's novels are firmly rooted in the golden age tradition of detective fiction, she was equally capable of turning the genre on its head. Such was the confidence of her narrative style, it is often impossible to distinguish serious crime from parody, or tragedy from comedy. While some readers found her implausible plots taxing, her numerous loyal followers, not least Philip Larkin, enjoyed her inimitable mixture of horror and jollity. Other notable Bradley novels include <span class="italic">Lament for Leto</span> (1971), which centres on an archaeological expedition, <span class="italic">The Saltmarsh Murders</span> (1932), and <span class="italic">Here Lies Gloria Mundy</span> (1982).<br>
<br>In the Stephen Hockaby novels, written during the 1930s, Mitchell moved from crime detection to historical fiction with works such as <span class="italic">Marsh Hay</span> (1933), set in Edwardian rural England, and <span class="italic">Grand Master</span> (1939), a Mediterranean adventure story about the knights of Malta.<br>
<br>Mitchell had a lifelong fascination with the legends and folklore of the British Isles and a serious interest in archaeology and ancient buildings. These interests are reflected throughout her work, but are particularly evident in the six crime novels she published as Malcolm Torrie. They all feature the male detective Timothy Herring, who is also the secretary of the Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings, a role which frequently leads him to corpses in bizarre situations, as in <span class="italic">Heavy as Lead</span> (1966). In <span class="italic">Your Secret Friend</span> (1968), Timothy becomes engaged to Alison Marchmont Pallis, an embittered schoolteacher whose knowledge of history makes her a useful sidekick in subsequent Torrie novels.<br>
<br>Gladys Mitchell also wrote several mystery stories for children. She never married and spent the latter part of her life at 1 Cecil Close, Corfe Mullen, Dorset, where she died of cancer on 27 July 1983.<br>
