<span class="headword">Taylor,  John</span>  (1808&#150;1887), <span class="occ">leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</span>, was born on 1 November 1808 in Milnthorpe, Westmorland, the second of the ten children of James Taylor (1773&#150;1870), excise officer and farmer, and his wife, Agnes Taylor (1787&#150;1868), daughter of John Taylor of Pooley, Barton, Westmorland, and his wife, Agnes Whittington. John was christened at the Heversham parish church on 4 December 1808. After formal schooling at Liverpool, then at Beetham, near Hale, Westmorland, where his family moved on to a small farm in 1819, he became a skilled wood-turner and cabinet-maker. After his apprenticeship in Penrith, Cumberland, he established his trade in Hale.<br>
<br>Experiencing a strong religious awakening, Taylor joined the Methodist church at the age of sixteen and shortly thereafter became an exhorter, then a local preacher. He later recalled having a &#145;strong impression to go to America to preach the gospel&#146;  (Taylor, 267). He followed his parents to Toronto in Upper Canada in 1832, set up his trade, and continued his preaching for Methodism. While so engaged he met the gentle and refined Leonora Cannon, whom he married on 28 January 1833. Leonora was born on 6 October 1796 in Peel, Isle of Man, the oldest child of Captain George Cannon (1766&#150;1811) and Leonora Callister (1775&#150;1822). She had emigrated to Canada in 1832. John and Leonora were to have four children.<br>
<br>In 1836 a Latter-Day Saint apostle named Parley P. Pratt preached the message of the restored gospel to the Taylors in Toronto. After thorough investigation, John became convinced of the truth of the message and was baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Shortly thereafter he was appointed to preside over several branches in Canada. This was the beginning of a half-century of devoted and valiant service in his newly found faith.<br>
<br>In 1837 the Taylors moved to Far West, Missouri, where John was ordained as one of the church's twelve apostles on 19 December 1838. He was to hold this high office for over forty years. He played a prominent role in assisting the Saints as they fled mob persecutions to a new gathering place at Commerce (later Nauvoo), Illinois.<br>
<br>In 1839 Taylor accepted a call to return to his native England as a missionary. He was based in Liverpool and preached the restored gospel here and in surrounding cities, including Manchester and Preston. He introduced the same message into Ireland and the Isle of Man, and extended his labours into Scotland. He gained a reputation as a powerful speaker, debater, and writer, and his work resulted in the conversion of many to Mormonism. He was to return again on a short-term mission to England in 1846&#150;7, at which time he also ministered for a brief period in Wales.<br>
<br>In 1841 Taylor rejoined his family and the Saints in Nauvoo, where he began a career of considerable community service as he continued his spiritual ministry. He was appointed as a city councilman, regent of the Nauvoo University, and judge-advocate in the Nauvoo Legion. In recognition of his literary talents he was appointed editor of the <span class="italic">Times and Seasons</span> (1839&#150;46), a Latter-Day Saint periodical, and he published a weekly, the <span class="italic">Nauvoo Neighbor</span> (1843&#150;5).<br>
<br>In June 1844 Taylor was invited to accompany Joseph and Hyrum Smith to Carthage gaol, Illinois, where the Smiths were detained while awaiting a hearing involving the destruction of an anti-Mormon newspaper. Taylor was to assist with the legal proceedings. An angry mob attacked the gaol and murdered both Joseph and Hyrum Smith. Severely wounded himself, Taylor survived to continue his ministry in the church.<br>
<br>Under intense persecution, the Latter-Day Saints left Nauvoo in the winter of 1846 and headed westward under the leadership of Brigham Young. Taylor's vigorous opposition to the tyranny of persecution during this and later periods gained him the title Champion of Liberty. &#145;I am God's free man,&#146; he said; &#145;I cannot, will not be a slave&#146;  (Roberts, 424). Later, in 1847, he led one of the companies of pioneers to the Great Salt Lake valley and the free exercise of their religion.<br>
<br>In 1849 Taylor was called to open France to the preaching of the restored gospel. He preached and published extensively both in Paris and, later, in Hamburg, Germany, overseeing the production of the <span class="italic">Book of Mormon</span> in both French and German. After nearly three years he returned to the Salt Lake valley. In the summer of 1854 Taylor responded to yet another mission call, this time to the eastern states of America, with his headquarters in New York city. Here he published <span class="italic">The Mormon</span> (1855&#150;7), a periodical which did much to allay harsh feelings against the church. Upon his return to Utah he was appointed speaker of the house of representatives in the Utah territorial legislature for five successive sessions and remained a member until 1876. He was also elected as territorial superintendent of schools in 1877.<br>
<br>In his private life Taylor was a kind and loving husband and father. He accepted the ancient biblical order of plural marriage when it was a revealed and authorized practice among Latter-Day Saints, and married several additional women. By seven of his wives&#151;Leonora Cannon (1796&#150;1868), Elizabeth Kaighin (1811&#150;1895), Jane Ballantyne (1813&#150;1900), Mary Ann Oakley (1826&#150;1911), Sophia Whitaker (1825&#150;1887), Harriet Whitaker (1825&#150;1882), and Margaret Young (1837&#150;1919)&#151;he fathered thirty-five children. He went to great lengths to be fair and impartial while caring for each of his families.<br>
<br>With the passing of Brigham Young in 1877, the mantle of church leadership fell upon John Taylor. In October 1880 he was sustained as the prophet and president of the church, the only president to this day born outside America. His ministry is notable for pushing forward with increased zeal work on temples; the further definition of priesthood responsibilities, such as holding of local weekly priesthood meetings and of monthly priesthood meetings in larger areas (stakes); further development of children and youth programmes; increase in missionary effort; assistance to the poor and those in debt; and his bold defence of the restored gospel in a time of intense government prosecution.<br>
<br>Besides scores of articles and pamphlets on Mormonism, Taylor wrote <span class="italic">The Government of God</span> (1852), in which he compared and contrasted the governmental systems of God and man; <span class="italic">Items on Priesthood</span> (1881), a treatise on priesthood and especially the duties of a bishop; and <span class="italic">Mediation and Atonement of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ</span> (1882), an assembling of scriptural passages with his own personal witness relating to the pre-eminent role of Christ in the salvation of humankind. A number of his talks and sermons are preserved in the <span class="italic">Journal of Discourses</span> (1854&#150;86), especially volumes 5&#150;26, and a compilation of many of his writings and discourses is found in <span class="italic">The Gospel Kingdom</span> (1943).<br>
<br>John Taylor was nearly 6 feet tall, weighing 180 pounds, with high forehead, deep-set grey eyes, firm chin, and silvery white hair. He seemed an English gentleman, of affable and kindly manner and noble bearing, deeply resolute, an ardent lover of liberty, and possessed of great courage and determination. He was a bold advocate and defender of the faith he espoused.<br>
<br>During Taylor's administration anti-polygamy legislation and prosecution increased. For what he felt was the public good, in the interests of peace, and out of his deep-felt conviction to abide by his religious principles rather than be subject to legalized persecution, Taylor went into self-imposed exile in 1885 to continue to lead the church. The strain took a great toll on his health. On 25 July 1887, after two and a half years in exile, he died in Kaysville, Utah, of congestive heart failure. He was eulogized as a &#145;double martyr&#146; for his near-fatal wounds in Carthage gaol and for his sacrifice for religious principles. He was buried on 29 July 1887 in the Salt Lake City cemetery.<br>
