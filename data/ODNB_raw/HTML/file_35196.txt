<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Neilson,  Julia Emilie</span>  (1868&#150;1957), <span class="occ">actress and theatre manager</span>, was born in Tottenham Court Road, London, on 12 June 1868, the only child of Alexander Ritchie Neilson, a silversmith and jeweller, and his wife, Emily Davis, who was one of an unusually gifted Jewish family of five sisters, no fewer than seven of whose offspring became professional actresses. Her widowed mother later married William Morris, a solicitor; his deceased first wife had been the actress Florence Terry, member of an even more illustrious theatrical dynasty and elder sister to the actor Fred Terry, who was by then Julia's husband.<br>
<br>Educated initially at two local private schools but showing little scholastic aptitude, Julia was sent to Germany at the age of twelve to be &#145;finished&#146; at a cosmopolitan boarding establishment in Wiesbaden, where she learned French and German and discovered a pronounced talent for music. After returning to London three years later she was enrolled at the Royal Academy of Music, at first to study the piano; before long, however, she was found to possess a fine mezzo-soprano voice and was advised to concentrate on singing with a view to a career in opera or on the concert platform. Having already won several prizes she made her first public appearance, while still a student, at the St James's Hall on 1 April 1887, but after gaining some experience of amateur dramatics she was given an introduction to W. S. Gilbert, who auditioned her and encouraged her to abandon music for the theatre. It was he, too, who arranged for her to make her acting d&eacute;but as Cynisca, the jealous wife, with Mary Anderson as Galatea in a charity matin&eacute;e of his <span class="italic">Pygmalion and Galatea</span> at the Lyceum Theatre on 21 March 1888, and then to play Galatea opposite Lewis Waller in a similar matin&eacute;e at the Savoy on 16 May.<br>
<br>Thanks to Gilbert's coaching, to which Neilson always acknowledged a profound debt, these performances helped to secure a formal engagement with Rutland Barrington at the St James's Theatre for the 1888&#150;9 season, following which she was invited by Beerbohm Tree to become a member of his company, initially on tour and subsequently at the Haymarket Theatre&#151;a meteoric rise to prominence for a young woman of twenty-one after little more than twelve months in the profession. She remained at the Haymarket for five years, creating such leading roles as Drusilla Ives in Henry Arthur Jones's <span class="italic">The Dancing Girl</span> (1891), Lady Isobel in his <span class="italic">The Tempter</span>, and Hester Worsley in Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">A Woman of No Importance</span> (both 1893). She married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36462/', "Fred Terry (1863&#150;1933)")</script>, a fellow artiste in the company, in 1891. After a brief engagement at the Adelphi Theatre she returned to the Haymarket, now under the management of Lewis Waller, in January 1895 to become the first Lady Chiltern in <span class="italic">An Ideal Husband</span>; in December she accompanied John Hare on a five-month tour of the United States, opening at Abbey's Theater in New York as Agnes in the American premi&egrave;re of Arthur Wing Pinero's <span class="italic">The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith</span>. On her return she joined George Alexander at the St James's to portray Princess Flavia in Anthony Hope's <span class="italic">The Prisoner of Zenda</span> (1896), staying with him for two years and playing, among others, her first Shakespearian roles, Rosalind in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span> (1896) and Beatrice in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> (1898). After rejoining Beerbohm Tree, now at Her Majesty's Theatre, she appeared as Constance in <span class="italic">King John</span> (1899) and Oberon in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (1900).<br>
<br>The same year saw Neilson take a fateful step which did much to determine the remainder of her career, when, following a tour of <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, she embarked upon London management with her husband. They mounted their first joint production, Paul Kester's <span class="italic">Sweet Nell of Old Drury</span>, at the Haymarket on 30 August. Not only did this inaugurate an acting and managerial partnership which lasted for thirty years, but it established a model for their subsequent offerings, mostly historical romances or comedy melodramas that made few intellectual demands on the spectator but ravished the eye with exquisite costumes and stylish period settings. Among the most successful were <span class="italic">The Scarlet Pimpernel</span> by Baroness Orczy and J. M. Barstow (New Theatre, 1905) and <span class="italic">Henry of Navarre</span> by William Devereux (New, 1909), which, with <span class="italic">Sweet Nell</span>, became their mainstay for many provincial tours and one to the United States in 1910; others, like <span class="italic">For Sword or Song</span> by Robert Legge and Louis Calvert (1903), <span class="italic">Dorothy o' the Hall</span> by Paul Kester and Charles Major (1906), <span class="italic">The Popinjay</span> by Boyle Lawrence and Frederick Mouillot (1911), <span class="italic">Mistress Wilful</span> by Ernest Hendrie (1915), <span class="italic">The Borderer</span> (1921), <span class="italic">The Marlboroughs</span> (1924), and William Devereux's <span class="italic">The Wooing of Katherine Parr</span> (1926), were equally capable of drawing large and extraordinarily loyal audiences. Each provided both actor&#150;managers with a prime role in which they could shine, but which scarcely challenged their creative resources, a fact which makes it difficult to assess the true calibre of Julia Neilson's acting. She possessed a compelling stage presence, admirable diction, a vibrant personality, and striking physical beauty which aged gracefully. If not a great actress, she was certainly highly accomplished and dearly loved by the thousands to whom she gave so much pleasure.<br>
<br>After her husband's death in 1933 Neilson appeared twice more on the stage, in the farce <span class="italic">Vintage Wine</span> by Seymour Hicks and Ashley Dukes at Daly's in 1934 and Heron Carvic's <span class="italic">The Widow of Forty</span> at the Q in 1944, and was guest of honour at a testimonial luncheon held in London in 1938 to mark her fiftieth anniversary as a performer. She died in hospital in Hampstead, after a fall at her home, on 27 May 1957, and was cremated at Golders Green two days later. Her son, Dennis (1895&#150;1932), and daughter, Phyllis Neilson-Terry (1892&#150;1977), also enjoyed distinguished theatrical careers.<br>
