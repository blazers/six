<span class="headword">Tomlinson,  (Philip) Richard Henry</span>  (1943&#150;2006), <span class="occ">teacher and theatre director</span>, was born on 10 August 1943 at 32 Mansion House Road, Glasgow, the only son (there were two daughters) of David Alan Tomlinson, chartered accountant and teacher, and his wife, Dorothy Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Owston. At the time of his birth his parents lived at 66 Newlands Road, Glasgow. The family had moved to Glasgow from Cheltenham during the war, and returned afterwards. Tomlinson was educated at Cheltenham College, which instilled in him his lifelong love of cricket. After reading history at London University he travelled across South Africa, where he met (Yvonne) Mavoureen Bryceland, the daughter of the actress Yvonne Bryceland. They married in 1967 and later had two daughters, Jemimah and Maisie.<br>
<br>After their marriage Tomlinson and his wife hitchhiked back to Britain through Europe, and Tomlinson began teaching history at the National Star College, Cheltenham, which specialized in students with physical disabilities and associated learning difficulties. He moved in 1970 to the Sandford Centre, Cheltenham, then in 1971 to Hereward College for the Disabled in Coventry. It was there that in 1973 he met the aspiring actor Nabil Shaban, during an interview for a place on a business studies course. Having been rejected by every drama school in the country because of his disability, Shaban had reasoned that the only way he would get into the theatrical profession was to set up his own company. By coincidence Tomlinson's only question was whether or not Shaban was interested in drama. (Tomlinson had the previous year begun a series of drama workshops at the college.) Shaban sought Tomlinson out as soon as he arrived at Hereward, and became part of the stage management team on a show Tomlinson and his cast were devising called <span class="italic">Never Mind You'll Soon Get Better</span>. The show took its name from the platitudinous nature of attitudes towards the disabled, and, in particular, a remark a doctor had made to a young man who had broken his neck in a diving accident. It explored the stories of the cast and their experiences of being disabled. Their next show, <span class="italic">Ready Salted Crips</span> (1974), expanded on this theme and consisted of sketches focusing in a satirical way on &#145;disabled people's perspectives and experiences of education (which was usually second-class), the medical profession and model, family, parents, employment, lack of employment&#146;  (Shaban). A key part of the show was &#145;Blind, Crippled, and Black&#146;, a parody of &#145;Young, Gifted, and Black&#146;. Shaban and Tomlinson shared a sense of humour influenced by Monty Python and the Goons and a determination to shock people out of their complacent and patronizing attitudes to people with disabilities. <span class="italic">Ready Salted Crips</span> toured Warwickshire, performing in schools, colleges, and amateur dramatic groups as well as in Coventry Cathedral and at Warwick University. The group followed this with Harold Pinter's <span class="italic">The Dumb Waiter</span>, which also toured and garnered excellent reviews from the local press. In 1975 Shaban and Tomlinson made a pact to set up a theatre company when Shaban had finished his degree. Tomlinson meanwhile went to the University of Illinois to study for an MA degree in education, specializing in child psychology, and while there he directed American students in a version of <span class="italic">Ready Salted Crips</span>, which he called <span class="italic">Sideshow</span>. He returned to London in 1976 to take up the post of senior adviser to disabled students at the Open University and began to plan the establishment of the theatre company with Shaban.<br>
<br>When the United Nations announced that 1981 would be designated international year of disabled people Tomlinson and Shaban decided that their company would need to be ready with a show by 1980. An opportunity to perform at an international conference on disability and rehabilitation in Canada in 1980 spurred them on, and by the end of 1978 the company had a show, <span class="italic">Sideshow</span>, and a name, Graeae. The Graeae were three sisters in Greek legend with only an eye and a tooth between them, betrayed by Perseus and left blind, screaming, and defenceless. The company's work was dedicated to overturning this popular perception of the disabled and providing work and a showcase for disabled practitioners. <span class="italic">Sideshow</span>, coupled with a BBC documentary about the group broadcast in 1981, gained the company international recognition. In the same year Tomlinson became headmaster of the Thomas Delarue School for the disabled in Tonbridge, where once again he used drama to challenge the preconceptions of the staff and students. One of the latter, Jamie Beddard (who would go on to work for Graeae), later described him as &#145;a man with no preconceptions and an absolute faith in the individual&#146;. Tomlinson's book <span class="italic">Disability, Theatre and Education</span> (1982) was a manifesto for theatre as a unique means of communication between the disabled and the able-bodied.<br>
<br>Tomlinson remained at the Thomas Delarue School until its closure in 1989. From 1993 to 2003 he was client services director for a national consultancy for people with learning disabilities, MacIntyre Care. He and his family had moved to Plaxtol in Kent where he resumed his cricketing career and joined the local amateur dramatic society, writing and appearing in pantomime. When Mavoureen died, in 1998, he moved to Manchester and set up a management training consultancy before becoming chief executive of the Royal School for the Deaf and Communication Disorders in Cheshire in 2004. He moved back to Tonbridge to live with his daughter Maisie when he became seriously ill with bone cancer. He died at her home, 37 Mortley Close, on 3 May 2006. Both daughters survived him.<br>
