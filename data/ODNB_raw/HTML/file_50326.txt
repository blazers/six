<span class="headword">Patrick</span>, fourth earl of Dunbar  (<em>d.</em> 1232), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50325/', "Waltheof, earl of Lothian (d. 1182)")</script>, and his wife, Alina (<i>d</i>. 1179). The best documented of the early Dunbar earls, he makes his first appearance on the record about 1178, when he witnessed a royal charter as &#145;the son of Earl Waltheof&#146;. When he succeeded, upon the death of his father, Patrick was the first to take the title &#145;earl of Dunbar&#146;, his predecessors having been styled &#145;of Lothian&#146;. He also succeeded to the lordship of Beanley and other lands in Northumberland, which a document of 1212 reveals were held for the service of &#145;inborh and utborh&#146;, that is, the earls of Dunbar apparently had to regulate border disputes. These English lands engendered much litigation: in 1187 Patrick deprived a vassal of his lands of Dercester (modern Darnchester), in Berwickshire, and in 1226&#150;7 he was involved in a dispute over tallage from the Middeltons.<br>
<br>Earl Patrick was among the most prominent of the Scottish magnates and was a frequent witness to the acts of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29452/', "William the Lion")</script> between <i>c</i>.1178 and <i>c</i>.1210. When King William fell ill in 1195 and attempted to settle the succession upon Otto of Saxony, the proposed husband of the king's daughter Margaret, Patrick was in the forefront of the opposition to the scheme; but the king's recovery negated the need for immediate action. Earl Patrick was among those nobles from both England and Scotland present in November of 1200 when King William performed homage to King John at Lincoln. In 1221 he again accompanied a Scottish king to England: this time the monarch was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/322/', "Alexander II")</script>, and Patrick was present at York for his marriage to Joan (Joanna), the sister of Henry III. The fact that at the end of John's reign he temporarily forfeited his lands in Northumberland suggests that Patrick had previously associated himself with Alexander's claims upon the northern counties of England. Roger of Howden, who described Earl Patrick's role in rebuilding the bridge at Berwick following its destruction in 1199, called him &#145;warden [<i>custos</i>] of Berwick and &hellip; chief Justiciar of the whole kingdom of the Scots&#146;  (Anderson, <span class="italic">Scottish Annals</span>, 322). Three royal charters, dating from 1195 to 1205 or 1206, style him <i>Justicia</i>, but since Earl Duncan (II) of Fife was chief justice at that time, Patrick was probably justice of Lothian, an office in existence by the late twelfth century. The reference to Patrick as <i>custos</i> of Berwick suggests that he held a prominent place in the community of the burgh and a position of responsibility on the Anglo-Scottish border. Like his ancestors, he endowed several monastic houses. He confirmed earlier grants and patronized the monks of Coldingham and Melrose as well as the canons of Dryburgh. But his relationship with the monasteries was often tempestuous, and led to a number of disputes. The best-known of these commenced in 1207, when Patrick had a falling-out with Melrose Abbey over a pasture on the Leader Water which was only resolved in 1208 with papal intervention.<br>
<br>In 1184 Patrick married Ada, the daughter of King William the Lion, providing a good indication of his high social status. Ada predeceased her husband in 1200, but the couple had several sons&#151;Patrick, who succeeded as earl, William, Robert, and Fergus&#151;and more than one daughter, for documents refer to all his sons and daughters. Some time after the death of his first wife, Patrick married Christina, the widow of William de Brus (<i>d</i>. 1211/12), but they are not known to have had any children. The chronicle of Melrose offers a touching portrayal of Patrick's death in 1232. It relates how, after celebrating Christmas with his children and kinsmen, Patrick was afflicted by a serious illness. He then:<blockquote>summoned Adam, the abbot of Melrose, his friend and kinsman; and he received from him the last unction, and the habit of religion. And bidding a last farewell to all, he closed his last day on the day of St Silvester [31 December], in the fiftieth year of his earldom. (Anderson, <span class="italic">Early Sources</span>, 2.486)</blockquote>Patrick was buried in the Cistercian nunnery at Eccles and was succeeded by his son, Patrick, who had probably controlled the earldom for some years before his ageing father's death.<br>
