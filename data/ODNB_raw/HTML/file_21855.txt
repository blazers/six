<span class="headword">Penn,  Thomas</span>  (1702&#150;1775), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, was born at Kensington, London, on 8 March 1702, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21857/', "William Penn (1644&#150;1718)")</script>, founder of Pennsylvania, and his second wife, Hannah Callowhill (1670&#150;1726). During his childhood the Penn family received little profit from the colony, and Thomas was apprenticed to a London mercer in order to provide an alternative financial security. Upon William's death in 1718 the children of his first wife disputed his will, which left the proprietorship of the colony to Thomas and his two brothers, John and Richard, by William's second wife. In 1727 Hannah won the upholding of her husband's will, which was further secured in 1731 when the descendants of William's first wife released their claims to the colony in exchange for a sum of money. In exchange for two beaver skins delivered annually to Windsor Castle the Penns were given absolute ownership of all lands and mining rights of Pennsylvania, but the proprietorship was still no guarantee of wealth. Rents had to be collected, payment for settled lands secured, and potential lands for settlement protected from French or American Indian attack.<br>
<br>Thomas Penn took the lead in the family's financial affairs, and in 1732 was the first family member to visit the colony since his father left in 1701. While in America Thomas devised new ways of categorizing the family's lands for rent and sale, as well as various ways to collect rents. He also renewed treaties with various American Indian communities and determined to strengthen his family's interests through strengthening the powers of an appointed governor. His success is perhaps best measured in the change from the warm welcome he received upon his arrival to the general colonial opinion of him as greedy and cold by the time of his departure in 1741. Upon his older brother's death in 1746 Thomas inherited his portion of proprietorship and thus held a three-quarters interest in the colony. On 22 August 1751 Thomas married Lady Juliana Fermor (1729&#150;1801), daughter of the earl of Pomfret. They had four sons, including the writers <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21850/', "John Penn (1760&#150;1834)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21847/', "Granville Penn (1761&#150;1844)")</script>, and three daughters. Although a Quaker by descent and association, Thomas had long since abandoned many of the denomination's practices, and his marriage in an Anglican church marked the end of his association with the Quaker faith. The Seven Years' War revealed the difficulties of managing the family's substantial American interests from England, and in 1763 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21849/', "John Penn (1729&#150;1795)")</script>, Thomas's nephew, was appointed governor of Pennsylvania. John maintained a regular correspondence with Thomas and Juliana, who had assumed a role of increasing importance as Thomas's health worsened. He died on 21 March 1775 at his estate at Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, and was buried at the church there. He left his interests in Pennsylvania to his only surviving son, John, who was fifteen. Juliana and his son-in-law, William Baker, took the lead of the family's American affairs for the short time until the American War of Independence brought about the dissolution of the Penns' proprietorship in 1779. For their losses of about 24 million acres of land and &pound;118,569 owed in rents, the Penns received &pound;130,000 as compensation from the new government of Pennsylvania.<br>
