</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Spinckes,  Nathaniel</span>  (1654&#150;1727), <span class="occ">bishop of the nonjuring Church of England</span>, was born on 9 May 1654 at Castor, Northamptonshire, where his father, Edmund Spinckes (1606/7&#150;1671), was the rector. His mother, Martha (<i>bap</i>. 1623, <i>d</i>. 1693), was the second daughter of Thomas Elmes, esquire, of Lilford and Warmington, Northamptonshire, whom Edmund Spinckes served as a chaplain. Edmund evidently had links with New England, where he had a share in an ironworks at the time of his death as well as property in Ireland. He took the solemn league and covenant and was faced with the threat of nearby royalist troops; he needed a troop of horse to guard him when he preached at Castor and was forced to flee from Warmington on the day before his eldest son was born because enemy parties had twice raided the house that day. Edmund Spinckes was ejected for his nonconformity at the Restoration. Indeed much was made later of Spinckes senior's support for parliament: &#145;nobody being more zealous for the rebels&#146;, and consequently Spinckes junior's achievement in overcoming &#145;the errors of his father&#146; and conquering the &#145;prejudice of his first education&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 9.5). In fact, Spinckes senior conformed to the Church of England, and Nathaniel's early schooling was undertaken by Samuel Morton, the rector of Haddon, Huntingdonshire.<br>
<br>On 9 July 1670 Nathaniel Spinckes matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge. As the eldest surviving son, on his father's death in 1671 Spinckes inherited his father's estate. This &#145;disqualified him from preferment in his college, according to the statutes&#146;  (BL, Sloane MS 4225, fols. 107&#150;11), so Spinckes transferred to Jesus College on 12 October 1672, aged eighteen, where he was elected a Rustat scholar. He graduated BA in 1674. He was ordained deacon on 21 May 1676 by Bishop Henry Compton of London, proceeded MA at Cambridge in 1677, and was ordained priest on 22 December 1678 by Bishop Thomas Barlow of Lincoln.<br>
<br>Spinckes became chaplain to Sir Richard Edgcumbe at Mount Edgcumbe, Devon, in June 1677, leaving to become curate at Stibbington, Huntingdonshire, in August the following year. In early 1679 he moved to Petersham in Surrey, where he served as curate and as chaplain to John Maitland, earl of Lauderdale, staying there for the next two and a half years. His fellow chaplain was George Hickes, another future nonjuror. He was appointed to the vicarage of Eckington in Worcestershire through the offices of the influential Anglican polemicist Simon Patrick, but was never instituted and, returning the living to its patrons, moved to London. He was curate of St Stephen Walbrook, London, from about March 1683 to September 1685; he also served as lecturer there for some months in 1684 and assisted William Clagett as afternoon preacher at Gray's Inn in 1685. On 17 September 1685 he was instituted as rector of Peakirk-cum-Glinton, Northamptonshire, by the dean (Simon Patrick again) and chapter of Peterborough. On 1 December 1686 he married Dorothy Rutland (<i>bap</i>. 1660, <i>d</i>. 1727), daughter of William Rutland, citizen of London, who brought with her a portion of &pound;1000. On 21 July 1687 he was made a prebendary of Salisbury, and on 24 September he became rector of St Martin's, Salisbury.<br>
<br>The revolution of 1688 changed Spinckes's comfortable existence. He lost his livings on 1 February 1690 for refusing to take the oaths of allegiance to the new regime. Much respected by fellow nonjurors such as John Kettlewell, Robert Nelson, and George Hickes for his piety, learning, and sweet disposition he was actively involved in Kettlewell's scheme to raise money to relieve indigent deprived clergy, for which he was one of those hauled before the privy council in 1695, and came to be the chief manager of the fund. However, Spinckes was, it seems, slow to take up his pen as a controversialist. In August 1705 Thomas Hearne recorded that Spinckes had written &#145;one book already about patience&#146;, presumably <span class="italic">Of trust in God, or, A discourse concerning the duty of casting our care upon God in all our difficulties</span> (1696). Now Hearne was informed that &#145;Mr Spinckes is a very prudent man and &hellip; well qualified to answer Mr Basset's <span class="italic">Essay for Catholic Communion</span>&#146;, a polemical work by Joshua Basset who had been the Catholic master of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, appointed by James II  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 1.30). This Spinckes duly did with his <span class="italic">Essay towards a Proposal for Catholic Communion</span> (1705) which he followed up with <span class="italic">The Case Truly Stated</span> (1714), <span class="italic">The Case Further Stated</span> (1718), and <span class="italic">The Article of Romanish Transubstantiation Inquired into and Disproved</span> (1719). According to Hearne, in 1705 he was also employed in the distribution of money &#145;given by the chief Jacobites for charitable purposes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 1.30). Spinckes also entered the controversy against the French prophets with <span class="italic">The New Pretenders to Prophecy Re-Examined</span> (1709). In 1712 he published a more popular work, <span class="italic">The sick man visited and furnished with instructions, meditations and prayers suitable to his condition</span>, the fourth edition of which in 1731 contained a short life of the author by John Blackbourne.<br>
<br>On 3 June 1713 Spinckes, Jeremy Collier, and Samuel Hawes were consecrated bishops &#145;at large&#146; by the nonjuring Bishop Hickes, assisted by bishops Campbell and Gadderar. In 1713 he wrote the preface to the published sermons of Hickes. In October 1716 he was taken into custody in Norwich on suspicion of Jacobite activity. From 1716 Spinckes was an important participant in the &#145;usages&#146; dispute over the proposals of some nonjurors like Collier to return to the first liturgy used by Edward VI. At least four pamphlets were published by Spinckes on this issue, including <span class="italic">No Reason for Restoring the Prayers and Directions of Edward VI's First Liturgy</span> (1717) and <span class="italic">No Just Grounds for Introducing the New Communion Office</span> (1719). Indeed, Spinckes was to be an intractable opponent of a compromise with the usagers which would have ended the schism between the nonjurors.<br>
<br>Not all of the work of Spinckes was explicitly acknowledged. His Greek scholarship was put to good use in translating the proposals for unity with the Greek church. In 1721 Spinckes published <span class="italic">The True Church of England Man's Companion to the Closet</span> (1721), which became known as <span class="roman">Spinckes's Devotions</span> during its long usage in the eighteenth century. In 1726 he published more discourses by Hickes with a preface.<br>
<br>Spinckes died on 18 July 1727, aged seventy-four; his wife followed seven days later. He was buried in the cemetery of the parish of St Faith under St Paul's, London. Although Spinckes had a large family, seven children died in infancy while an eighth, Robert, drowned in a shipwreck sailing from Bengal to Bombay in 1712. Only William, a merchant, and Anne, who married Anthony Cope, survived their parents. <span class="italic">The Historical Register</span> rather sympathetically recorded that Spinckes &#145;had no wealth, few enemies, many friends &hellip; His patience was great, his self-denial greater, and his charity still greater; though his temper seems to be his cardinal virtue&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Register</span>, 12.29&#150;30).<br>
