<span class="headword">Ellis,  John Edward</span>  (1841&#150;1910), <span class="occ">colliery owner and politician</span>, was born on 15 October 1841 at Castle View, The Newarke, Leicester, the eldest of the five children of Edward Shipley Ellis (1817&#150;1879), railway chairman and social reformer, and his wife, Emma Burgess (1809&#150;1899), both of whom came from Quaker families.<br>
<br>Educated at Friends' schools at Hertford and Kendal, in 1857 Ellis accompanied his father (by that time chairman of the Midland Railway Company) on a trip to the USA to study the American railway system. From 1858 to 1861 he served an apprenticeship with Kitson and Hewitson, railway and general engineers, of Leeds. In 1861 he was appointed to a management position at the Hucknall colliery then being sunk by a partnership in which his father and uncle were initially joined by two others, and Ellis soon assumed overall managerial control. This was the first mine to be sunk in Nottinghamshire's Leen valley, which was to become Britain's most prosperous coalfield. A paternalistic employer, Ellis was concerned to provide fair wages and good working conditions, as well as decent housing and social infrastructure. He was largely responsible for the establishment of a local board in the Leen valley in 1866, a school board in 1871 (he served as chairman of both bodies for some years), a town water supply, and adult schools (in which he himself lectured for a time).<br>
<br>In 1867 Ellis married Maria (1845&#150;1941), the fifth child of John and Jane Rowntree of Scarborough, whom he met at the Quaker meeting there. They lived at The Park, Nottingham, and had three sons (two of whom died in early adulthood), and twin daughters, one of whom, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56644/', "Marian Ellis")</script>, became a philanthropist and political activist. In Nottingham, Ellis again became involved in educational work and was a member of the city's school board. Between 1882 and 1886 he was also chairman of the Nottingham Joint Stock Bank.<br>
<br>Ellis promoted the formation of a Liberal association in north Nottinghamshire in 1880, and in 1885 he became MP for the newly created seat of Rushcliffe, which then included Hucknall. He held this seat until shortly before his death in 1910. A highly principled man, as befits a Quaker, Ellis campaigned against Irish injustices and for home rule; supported the temperance movement; opposed the arms trade and the South African War; and supported free trade. In 1902 he welcomed the emergence of labour representation in parliament. He chaired many standing and select committees of the house; in 1895 he became temporary chairman of ways and means, but subsequently declined nomination as speaker. From December 1905 to December 1906 he was under-secretary for India under John Morley, and he was sworn of the privy council in 1905.<br>
<br>Because of his early belief in classical economic doctrine Ellis was unsympathetic to trade unions in the 1860s and 1870s, but he gradually came to recognize their value; soon after the formation of the Nottinghamshire Miners' Association in 1881, he gave it encouragement and support. He formed a particularly close relationship with the association's second agent, William Bailey (appointed 1886), and the good relationship then established with the association continued after Bailey's untimely death in 1896. Ellis, assisted by two other Nottinghamshire colliery owners who were Liberal politicians, induced the Leen valley colliery proprietors to break the owners' lock-out by their men in 1893 by re-opening their pits on the pre-stoppage conditions and by forming a breakaway owners' association. This split in the coal owners' ranks was subsequently exploited by the union.<br>
<br>Ellis was asthmatic and it was partly for this reason that he bought a country estate near Scarborough (Wrea Head, Scalby) in 1883. On his election to parliament in 1885, he also bought a London residence, 40 Pont Street; in 1906 he moved from there to 37 Prince's Gate, Knightsbridge. He died from acute bronchitis at his London home on 1 December 1910, and was buried in the churchyard at Scalby on 6 December.<br>
