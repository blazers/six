<span class="headword">Harvel,  Edmund</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1550), <span class="occ">merchant and diplomat</span>, was probably the gentleman of that name of Besford and Cowley, Worcestershire, who appears on the pardon roll at the accession of Henry VIII and in a genealogical table in a Worcestershire heralds' visitation of 1564. Little else is sure about his family and early life, except that he had a brother, a London merchant, who visited him in Venice in 1539. This man was almost certainly the Richard Harvel who was an exile in Z&uuml;rich and Geneva in the reign of Mary I. Edmund Harvel was in Venice by 1524, when he acted as an agent for the Paduan philosopher Niccol&ograve; Leonico Tomeo. He was by then a friend to Tomeo's circle of English students, which numbered Thomas Lupset, Reginald Pole, and Thomas Starkey. He developed particularly strong relations with Starkey and Pole, and in the 1530s came to be on close terms with Starkey's associate Richard Morison, and with one of Pole's servants, Bernardino Sandro. By the 1540s a succession of English students and tourists were in contact with him as a potential aid and protector in Venice, and several of them, including Thomas Hoby and John Denny, stayed in his home.<br>
<br>Harvel's semi-official activities on behalf of Henry VIII date at the latest from 1530, when he acted as an agent for Richard Croke and John Stokesley, who were in Italy to find solutions to the problem of the royal divorce. He transmitted money from England to Croke in Venice, and sent back to the king Croke's letters and writings, activities for which he received royal grants in 1530 and 1531. It was probably through Thomas Starkey&#151;who was back in England by 1534, and with whom Harvel carried on a regular correspondence in the mid-1530s&#151;and through Thomas Winter, Cardinal Wolsey's illegitimate son, that Harvel became known to Thomas Cromwell, who offered him employment in 1535 and advised him to move back to England. At this time Starkey was himself in Cromwell's service as an intelligencer for Italian affairs, and was working to persuade Reginald Pole to come to terms publicly with Henry VIII's divorce and royal supremacy. Although Harvel wrote to Starkey in 1535 communicating his plans to return to England as soon as he had tied up his business affairs in Italy, and reassuring him that Pole would satisfy the king, it appears that Harvel was misleading Starkey. In the autumn of 1535, while Pole stayed in his house in Venice, Harvel visited Sicily. This journey, apparently made to settle his business interests, was at least in part a mission on Pole's behalf to Charles V, then in Palermo, probably intended to persuade the emperor to take action against the schismatic king of England. In April 1536 Pole, whose passionate denunciation of Henry VIII had by then reached England, still regarded Harvel as one of his clients, claiming to his friend Alvise Priuli that he could not send Harvel again to Charles V without causing suspicion in England. This material explains why Harvel in the event thought it prudent not to return to England, instead marrying Apollonia Uttinger, the daughter of an Augsburg merchant resident in Venice, in 1538. Uttinger brought a substantial dowry worth 1500 Venetian <i>ducati</i> to the union.<br>
<br>Harvel's work for Pole also testifies to his skills of concealment: in 1537 he entered government service and through Cromwell was granted a stipend from the crown and a licence to export wool from England. Thereafter he sent regular newsletters to Cromwell until the latter's death in 1540. But his diplomatic status remained ambivalent. From the English side he was not yet an official agent in 1538, when Richard Morison begged Cromwell to make him so. By 1539 he was specifically instructed as an intelligencer by Cromwell &#145;under the colour of his feate and trade of merchandise, keping this Commission secrete from all men&#146;. His task was to include spying on the papacy and on Reginald Pole; fostering evangelical and anti-papal sentiment among &#145;notable and honest persons&#146;; and secretly conveying the king's favourable disposition to the duke of Urbino, who was under threat of invasion from the pope  (Merriman, 2.167&#150;75). His letters to Cromwell also include extensive reports on Mediterranean and Turkish matters. After Cromwell's fall Harvel wrote directly to Henry VIII, or occasionally to Thomas Wriothesley and William Paget.<br>
<br>From the Venetian government Harvel gained some, but not total, diplomatic recognition. In 1542 he was granted permission for his thirteen servants, four of them English, to carry arms, and the authorities gave him retrospective exemption from taxes on the basis of his ambassadorial status in 1545. On the other hand, although permitting him a grand funeral in 1550, partially paid for by the state, the signoria did not follow the procession because Harvel was considered more of an &#145;envoy&#146; and &#145;vice-ambassador&#146; than a full ambassador. Although most of his business activities remain obscure, they included trade in corn in Sicily and, more importantly, the export of wool from England to Venice and elsewhere. The Venetian republic's traditionally warm relations with England were maintained in this period because of the wool trade in particular, and some of Harvel's diplomatic dealings reveal the Venetian authorities' anxieties not to alienate Henry VIII because of this. For example, the republic was reluctant to act against the Bolognese <i>condottiere</i> Ludovico dalle Armi, accused of various criminal activities in the 1540s, in part because he was in the employment of the king; Harvel acted as a negotiator over this matter, helping to postpone dalle Armi's execution until after Henry VIII's death.<br>
<br>Harvel's marriage to a German probably reflected his religious sympathies. His connections in the late 1530s and 1540s with Italian evangelicals, Lutherans, and critics of the established church were wide-ranging. His physician (Girolamo Donzellino) and his secretary (Baldassare Altieri) were both noted heretics, while he maintained relations with Pietro Aretino, Antonio Brucioli (whom he recommended to Cromwell as a potential spy in Rome in 1539), Ortensio Lando (who dedicated to him his <span class="italic">Lettere di molte virtuose donne</span> in 1548), and, possibly, Michelangelo Florio and Vincenzo Maggi. Harvel used his diplomatic position to protect evangelicals in Venice and to foster protestant connections between England and Italy, but apparently always with sufficient prudence and discretion not to come under suspicion himself.<br>
<br>It was indeed for his prudential qualities that Harvel was highly regarded by the Venetian government as a diplomat. He also gained a reputation for kindness, friendship, and learning. By the 1540s his household was a substantial one and the inventory of his goods, drawn up after his death, indicates possessions (including 170 books) valued at 930 Venetian <i>ducati</i>. From this, 446 <i>ducati</i> and 12 <i>grossi</i> were spent on paying off his servants and on his funeral in the church of San Geremia and burial in the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo; these took place before 7 January 1550. His wife, by whom he was deeply mourned, inherited the remainder as the return of her dowry.<br>
