<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gowland,  William</span>  (1842&#150;1922), <span class="occ">metallurgist and archaeologist</span>, was born in South Durham Street, Sunderland, co. Durham, on 16 December 1842, the elder of two sons of George Thompson Gowland (1800/01&#150;1847), shipowner and innkeeper, and his wife, Catherine, formerly Ovington, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kelly (1805&#150;1891). He was intended to enter medicine and spent two years preparing for the profession with a doctor in Sheffield, but his scientific interests led him to enrol in 1868 as a student at the Royal College of Chemistry. He then studied metallurgy at the Royal School of Mines, and qualified as an associate of the school. From 1870 to 1872 he was employed at the Broughton Copper Co., Salford, Lancashire. He became a fellow of the Chemical Society in 1871.<br>
<br>In 1872 Gowland went to Japan as one of the foreigners employed by the Meiji government to assist in its programme of modernization. As chemist and metallurgist to the imperial mint at Osaka, whose director was Thomas Kinder, he had responsibility for the purity of the copper coinage. In 1875, when the running of the mint was placed under Japanese management, and the employment of most of the foreign employees was terminated, he was retained as a technical adviser. In 1878 he became chief metallurgist at the mint. He was also an assayer to the imperial war department of the Japanese government. He remained in the imperial service in Japan until the end of October 1888. A keen oarsman, he introduced the sport of rowing among the staff employed at the mint. In 1884 the emperor of Japan awarded him the fourth class of the order of the Rising Sun, and he was promoted to the third class at the end of his employment.<br>
<br>Gowland travelled widely in Japan, and made expeditions into the mountains, probably with a view to sourcing metal deposits for the mint. His time in Japan coincided with growing interest in the country's prehistory, and the adoption in 1876 by the Meiji government of measures to protect ancient sites, notably imperial tombs. Gowland himself undertook an investigation of tombs of the kofun period while visiting Tondabayashi in Osaka prefecture in 1876. During the remainder of his stay in Japan he went on to survey 406 earth-mounded tombs, dating from the third to seventh centuries <span class="smallcap">AD</span>. He examined over 130 of them in detail, using flash photography to record the interiors of the stone burial chambers. Through his official contacts in Japan he was able to bring back to Britain considerable quantities of objects, which were acquired for the British Museum by Augustus Wollaston Franks. The collection comprises &#145;perhaps the finest collection of kofun-period material outside Japan&#146;  (Kaner, 279).<br>
<br>Despite the comprehensive and pioneering nature of his archaeological investigations in Japan, Gowland did not publish his results until some years after his return to Britain, and did so only in English, in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Anthropological Institute</span> (1895), <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> (1897), and the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Japan Society</span> (1898). This delay was probably dictated by prudence, as some of his findings would have been unwelcome to his Meiji hosts. He questioned the restored dynasty's recent identification of the Misanzai kofun as the mausoleum of the legendary founding emperor Jimmu; while his evidence of the power of local rulers in the early kofun period undermined the received chronology of imperial sovereignty. His influence in Japan was as a result limited. Moreover, as other contemporary researchers, such as Romyn Hitchcock of the Smithsonian Institute and the American zoologist Edward Sylvester Morse, reported their Japanese researches earlier, their contribution became better known, though Gowland's findings were cited in <span class="italic">Prehistoric Japan</span> (1911) by Neil Gordon Munro. In later literature Gowland's use of the term &#145;dolmens&#146;, by analogy with burial tombs in European prehistory, was regarded as anachronistic, though his interest in the question of whether Japan, too, had a stone age suggested a wide intellectual curiosity, which he pursued through meticulous investigation  (Kaner, 279). His contribution to Japanese archaeology was reappraised in a monograph published in 2003, which reproduced many photographs from his surviving glass plates.<br>
<br>Gowland's careful archaeological method was also applied in Britain when, in 1901, he supervised the restoration of part of Stonehenge. Stone 56 was tilting dangerously and, following representations by the Society of Antiquaries (of which Gowland was a fellow), by the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society, and by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Monuments, the site's owner, Sir Edmund Antrobus, permitted the re-erection of the stone, set in concrete. During the operation, over four days in September 1901, Gowland undertook careful archaeological excavations in an area of 18 square yards around the base of the stone, removing the soil in six-inch sections, sieving it through meshes of varying sizes (a technique he had used at the Shibamura tomb as early as 1878), and recording three-dimensionally the position of each object found. He discovered the sarsen hammerstones with which the stones had been shaped, and other tools used in the monument's construction, which had been used to wedge the stone in place. His report of the excavations, published in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span> (1902), set out for the first time precise evidence of how Stonehenge was constructed, and the stones raised, while also offering a possible dating (1800 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>) based on material evidence. He also found traces of the early use of copper. Since his findings refuted some of the more sensational theories about the origins and purposes of Stonehenge, Gowland's work did not receive wide public attention, but it was later admired for its precision, and is regarded as a landmark in archaeological investigation  (Atkinson, 193).<br>
<br>On his return to Britain Gowland had resumed employment at the Broughton Copper Co. as chief metallurgist. He married, on 2 September 1890, Joanna (1859/60&#150;1909), youngest daughter of Murdoch Macaulay, of Linshador, Stornoway, Isle of Lewis; they had a daughter. In 1894 he became examiner in metallurgy to the Board of Education. He settled in London, where he became a prominent figure in the world of learned societies, serving on the councils of the Japan Society, the Anthropological Institute, and the Society of Antiquaries. His extensive publications in their journals mainly related to the metallurgy of artefacts from early periods, but also included a study of the Maruyama Shijo school of Japanese painters.<br>
<br>In 1902 Gowland succeeded Sir William Roberts-Austen as professor of metallurgy in the Royal School of Mines, which became a constituent part of Imperial College in 1907. His reputation as a metallurgist was mainly based on his practical experience. His principal work involved methods of examining steel alloys, in which he continued the work of his predecessor; he also promoted the use of microscopes in metallurgy. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1903, later serving on the council of the society, and was president of the Institution of Mining and Engineering in 1907. After his retirement from Imperial College in 1909 he wrote <span class="italic">The Metallurgy of Non-Ferrous Metals</span> (1914; second edn, 1918).<br>
<br>After the death of his first wife Gowland married, on 31 March 1910, Maude Margaret (1868&#150;1949), a schoolteacher, daughter of Duncan James Connacher, dentist. Gowland died at his home, 13 Russell Road, Kensington, London, on 10 June 1922, and was buried in Marylebone cemetery. His antiquarian interests were incidental to his principal occupation (as early as 1871 he was described as a professional chemist), but his excavations in Japan and at Stonehenge have proved to be his enduring legacy.<br>
