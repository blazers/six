<span class="headword">Cole,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1530&#150;1600), <span class="occ">dean of Lincoln and college head</span>, was born in Grantham, Lincolnshire. He was possibly the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5856/', "Thomas Cole")</script>, archdeacon of Essex. Admitted at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 28 July 1545, William Cole graduated BA in March 1548 and is credited with a fellowship from the time of his matriculation. He proceeded MA in 1552.<br>
<br>After Mary's accession Cole was among the distinguished group of Oxford scholars who sought refuge in Z&uuml;rich. Early in 1554, with Robert Horne and his wife, James Pilkington, Thomas Lever, Thomas Bentham, Thomas Spencer, and Laurence Humphrey, among others, Cole petitioned the Z&uuml;rich magistrates for permission to reside there and enjoy their protection &#145;against the violence of those &hellip; who would oppose and molest us&#146;  (Robinson, <span class="italic">Original Letters</span>, 1.752). Thereafter, with Humphrey and John Parkhurst, future bishop of Norwich, Cole was one of many who were welcomed into the household of the printer Christopher Froschover, who had been a pupil of Peter Martyr in Oxford in 1551&#150;2. Here they lived together &#145;happily, like brothers&#146;, paying their way as if they were still undergraduates wherever they went (&#145;simul fraterne &amp; iucunde viximus, &amp; ordinaria pensa quasi in Gymnasio quopiam persoluimus&#146;; Humphrey, 89).<br>
<br>Although also kindly received by Rudolph Gualter, Heinrich Bullinger's eventual successor as Z&uuml;rich's chief pastor, Cole migrated to Frankfurt, where in the tax list of October 1556 he was rated as worth 100 florins. With John Foxe he seems to have moved on to Basel during the winter of 1556&#150;7, but on 5 June 1557 was accepted into John Knox's congregation in Geneva, on the same day as Alice Agar, widow of Colchester, Essex, and her children Thomas, Jane, and Priscilla. On 29 November Cole became a resident of the city. Before the end of 1557 Alice Agar married Thomas Spencer (who had arrived in November 1556), while Cole married Jane Agar. No child is recorded as being baptized in Geneva before the couple's departure.<br>
<br>During 1558 Cole assisted in the translation of the Geneva <span class="roman">Bible</span>. He perhaps continued to do so for several months after Elizabeth I's accession, since his Knoxian views on church discipline and the fact that his marriage prevented him from resuming his fellowship will have given him no immediate incentive to return to England. By May 1564 he was serving as chaplain to the Merchant Adventurers in Antwerp, where Edmund Grindal, bishop of London, permitted him to follow local protestant usage. Accordingly he ignored the prayer book ceremonies and was assisted in his ministry by six elders.<br>
<br>Yet his family connections finally drew Cole to Colchester, where on 20 November 1564 he was admitted burgess, without fine, as the town's common preacher. As such he was not obliged to observe the prayer book ceremonies, and perhaps for that reason did not, like Colchester's archdeacon, James Calfhill, publicly oppose Archbishop Matthew Parker's attempts to impose ritual conformity during the vestiarian controversy of 1564&#150;6.<br>
<br>In 1568, at the recommendation of Robert Horne, now bishop of Winchester and the college's visitor, Elizabeth nominated Cole to the presidency of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. The senior fellows, still conservative in their approach to Elizabeth's settlement, had no wish to have a married president imposed upon them, and when Cole arrived to take formal possession the doors were closed against him. It was necessary to obtain a royal commission, dated 21 July 1568, to secure his admittance. He was granted the degree of BD on 18 November following.<br>
<br>Thereafter Cole appears to have shed much of his Knoxian austerity, becoming a modest pluralist in the process. Rector of Buscot, Berkshire, from 1571 to 1573, he resigned after institution to the college living of Lower Heyford, Oxfordshire, in 1572. On 21 September 1571 he had been collated by the dying John Jewel to the prebend of Durnford in Salisbury Cathedral, and on 10 May 1572 Horne collated him canon of the fifth prebend in Winchester Cathedral. He proceeded DTh in January 1574, and on the following 4 December was installed as prebendary of Bedford Major in Lincoln Cathedral.<br>
<br>Perhaps more than most of his generation Cole's Elizabethan career was conditioned by the Marian years. He had owed his preachership in Colchester to his marriage, and his presidency to Horne, while two Genevan fellow exiles, the London merchants Edward Caunt and John Bodley, were among those who stood surety for his first fruits, for Lower Heyford and his Salisbury prebend respectively. He also remained a friend of Foxe, Parkhurst, and John Aylmer. When Gualter's son visited England in 1573 as Parkhurst's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Cole went out of his way to remind Gualter of the kindness he had received from him &#145;beyond all others&#146;, declaring that &#145;in mind and inclination I shall always be a Zuricher&#146;  (Robinson, <span class="italic">Zurich Letters</span>, 2.222). Given his subsequent removal to Geneva this smacks of special pleading, as does his letter the following year regretting that because young Gualter's stay in Oxford had been brief he had &#145;not treated him according to his merit&#146;  (ibid., 2.256). For his part young Gualter praised Cole and Laurence Humphrey, under whose tutelage at Magdalen he had placed himself, for their &#145;singular regard&#146; and &#145;especial kindness&#146; towards him  (ibid., 2.218).<br>
<br>Although he was accounted an excellent teacher, Cole's presidency was undistinguished. The college estates were incompetently administered during his tenure, and complaints reached Horne that he had defrauded the college and allowed it to fall into debt. One of Horne's informants was Simon Tripp, who wrote in April 1572 of the contention and strife among the fellowship. Tradition asserts that when Horne decreed that &#145;he and the college must part without more ado&#146;, Cole &#145;fetched a deep sigh and said, &#147;What, my lord, must I then eat mice at Zurich again?&#148;&#146; Touched, Horne bade him &#145;be at rest and deal honestly with the college&#146;  (Wood, 2.166). Since the story scarcely accords with the generous reception both men had received from Froschover, Bullinger, and Gualter, it should probably be discounted. Cole's later career, moreover, suggests that reports of his inefficiency were exaggerated and/or that he heeded Horne's advice. During 1577 he served as vice-chancellor, and by letters patent dated 17 May 1577 he succeeded John Aylmer, elevated to the bishopric of London, as archdeacon of Lincoln.<br>
<br>From this time, if no earlier, Cole appears to have been entirely reconciled to Elizabeth's settlement of religion and showed no sympathy for the aspirations of younger nonconformists. On 28 February 1579, condoling with Gualter on the death of his son, he observed laconically of the settlement that there had been &#145;no change whatever&#146; since 1559  (Robinson, <span class="italic">Zurich Letters</span>, 2.306). In September that year he became a canon residentiary at Lincoln, and perhaps for that reason resigned his stall at Winchester. In June 1580 he was excused further residence in Lincoln on the grounds that he had been summoned to attend the earls of Warwick and Leicester. By March 1581 he had also resigned his archdeaconry but retained his Lincoln and Salisbury prebends, along with Lower Heyford, until his death.<br>
<br>Cole evidently approved of the three articles which John Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury, introduced as his yardstick of conformity in late 1583. He served on a committee which on 5 February 1584 promulgated new and restrictive regulations with regard to university preaching licences. Later that year the bailiffs (joint mayors) of Colchester asked Cole to intercede with Aylmer following the suspension of their present town preacher, George Northey. Finding Aylmer inflexible, and informed that similar efforts by Walsingham, Leicester, and Warwick had all failed in council, he advised the bailiffs to abandon their suit unless Northey would subscribe Whitgift's articles &#145;for that opinion is very dangerous to the estate of the whole realm as I am verily persuaded&#146;  (Essex RO, Morant MS D/Y 2/5, p. 107). In March 1589 Cole expelled the radical William Hubbock from his fellowship following his imprisonment by the high commission and subsequent refusal to enter into bonds for his good behaviour.<br>
<br>Aylmer unsuccessfully recommended Cole for some promotion in 1591 or 1592, and, describing him as his &#145;coexile&#146; and Burghley's &#145;countryman and faithful wellwisher&#146; suggested on 1 June 1592 that he might succeed John Underhill as bishop of Oxford  (BL, Lansdowne MS 72, fol. 103<i>r</i>). In the event the see remained vacant until 1604.<br>
<br>In 1598, when Whitgift wished to encourage John Reynolds, dean of Lincoln, to continue his writings against the Jesuits by returning him to the more congenial atmosphere of Oxford, Cole agreed to resign his presidency in exchange for the deanery. Whitgift successfully petitioned Sir Robert Cecil in September, describing Cole as &#145;an ancient Doctor of Divinity and an honest, learned and grave man&#146; and the exchange as &#145;greatly for the benefit of the church, and for God's&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 8, 332).<br>
<br>Elected on 28 October 1598 and installed as dean on 2 June 1599, Cole left no record in the chapter acts beyond his signature to receipts in a clear, well-formed hand. He made a brief nuncupative will on 31 August 1600, leaving a personal bequest to his daughter-in-law Elizabeth, wife of his eldest son, William, and the rest of his property to the disposal of his wife and executor, &#145;Joane&#146;. He died before 14 September and was buried under the high altar of the cathedral. A monument, now destroyed, was erected in 1632 by his eldest daughter, Abigail, wife of Henry Stratford of Hawling, Gloucestershire. The epitaph was transcribed in full by Browne Willis.<br>
<br>It has been assumed that Thomas Cole, fellow of Corpus from 1576 and Cole's successor at Lower Heyford, must have been his son, but Thomas gave his birthplace as Stanley, Gloucestershire, and his age as twenty-six when ordained by Aylmer in 1578. Born, therefore, while Cole was still an Edwardian fellow of Corpus, he was probably a nephew.<br>
