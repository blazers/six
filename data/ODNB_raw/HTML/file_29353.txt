<span class="headword">Widdicomb,  Henry</span>  (1813&#150;1868), <span class="occ">comic actor</span>, born in Store Street, Tottenham Court Road, London, on 14 February 1813, was the son of <a name="cosubject_29353"></a><span class="headword">John Esdaile Widdicomb <span class="st"> [Widdicumb]</span></span>  (1787&#150;1854), a well-known figure for many years in London, who from 1819 to 1853 was <span class="occ">riding-master and conductor of the ring</span> at Astley's Amphitheatre. The elder Widdicomb, before he was at Astley's, played in pantomimes with Grimaldi at the Coburg Theatre, and was said to be an excellent ring-master. When there was no evening performance at Astley's he was frequently seen at Vauxhall. He died in Kennington on 3 November 1854.<br>
<br>When he was fifteen Harry Widdicomb was entered by his father as a clerk at the custom house. Against his father's wish he left this employment in 1831, and obtained an engagement at the Margate theatre under Saville Faucit. He joined the Yorkshire circuit under Down, but moved to London about 1835 and was engaged by Andrew Ducrow. When Astley's was burnt down he went to Liverpool and played leading low comedy parts under Malone Raymond. In March 1842 he was taken on by Benjamin Webster at the Haymarket, his first employment at a West End theatre. In 1845 he became joint manager of the Sheffield and Wolverhampton theatres with Charles Dillon, but three years later he returned to London, and was principal comic actor at the Surrey Theatre from 1848 to 1860. He played, at first occasionally and then regularly, under Fechter at the Lyceum, notably in <span class="italic">Sarah's Young Man</span> (August 1858), Gilbert's <span class="italic">Uncle Baby</span> (November 1863), and as the First Gravedigger in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> (January 1861 and May 1864), as well as in many other minor roles. He was last seen during 1867 at the Holborn Theatre.<br>
<br>Widdicomb never attained the first rank, but he had a considerable fund of original humour and power of facial expression. He died in Kennington Park Road on 6 April 1868, and was buried at Norwood cemetery.<br>
