<span class="headword">Maxwell,  William</span>, fifth earl of Nithsdale  (1676&#150;1744), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer and courtier</span>, eldest son of Robert, fourth earl of Nithsdale (1627/8&#150;1683), and Lady Lucie Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1713), daughter of William, first marquess of Douglas, was probably born at Terregles Castle, near Dumfries. The early death of his father ensured that he was raised by his mother, the dowager countess, who educated him to be a faithful and conventionally devout Roman Catholic and a partisan of the Stuart cause. A series of private tutors endowed him with those social accomplishments thought necessary, by his class, for a great nobleman and courtier. He was confirmed in his titles on 26 May 1696, and shortly after reaching his majority he was dispatched to the exiled court at St Germain to pay his respects to James II. While there, he met and courted Lady Winifred Herbert [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18417/', "Maxwell, Winifred (1672&#150;1749)")</script>], the youngest daughter of William, first marquess of Powis, and Lady Elizabeth Somerset. The couple married in Paris on 2 March 1699. On returning to his seat at Terregles, Nithsdale was careful not to present any outward show of his religion that might enrage any of his staunchly Presbyterian lowland neighbours. However, this was to no avail, and on the night of 24 December 1703 a crowd of more than 100 armed men, led by four local ministers, broke open the castle's gates and ransacked his property in search of Jesuit agents and Roman Catholic priests. Summoned to appear before the magistrates in Edinburgh on 21 February 1704, he was acquitted of harbouring foreign priests but was still stripped of his office as hereditary steward of Kirkcudbright, a title which was conferred instead upon James, duke of Queensberry.<br>
<br>Long suspected by the authorities of Jacobitism Nithsdale was placed under surveillance and a bond as a security for his future good conduct was demanded of him by the government, to be paid no later than 8 November 1708. Fear of the total confiscation of his lands may well have prompted him to bequeath all of his estate to his eldest son on 28 November 1712, while retaining only a life-rent for his own maintenance. However, it appears that this was only a secondary consideration, and that his utter inability to manage his own affairs, and to handle money, was the real reason behind the transference of his properties.<br>
<br>The Jacobite rising of 1715 placed Nithsdale in a very difficult dilemma, and he initially temporized before, refusing a government summons, he joined the insurgents. Though his faith had effectively barred him from high command, he was entrusted with the unenviable task of raising the old covenanting districts of Dumfries and Galloway for the Jacobite cause. Having proclaimed James III (James Francis Edward Stuart) king at Moffat and Jedburgh, he rendezvoused with the main Jacobite forces of General Forster at Rothbury, near Hexham, on 19 October 1715. At Penrith on 2 November he brought up the main body of the troops, who pushed aside the small and dispirited militia companies which had barred the road south. He accompanied the army on its march through Kendal and Lancaster, and was placed in joint command of the gentlemen volunteers at the battle of Preston, on 12&#150;13 November 1715. He was stationed in the parish churchyard throughout the fighting and saw his forces drawn upon as a reserve at times of crisis. However, he appears to have been one of the Scottish lords who advocated surrender once it became clear that the town was thoroughly enveloped by government troops, and his sword was delivered to generals Wills and Carpenter on Monday 14 November without the promise of any sort of favourable terms from his captors.<br>
<br>On 5 December Nithsdale was led into London along with the other Jacobite prisoners. Confined to the Tower, he was impeached on 9 January 1716 and was among the six Jacobite lords tried for treason at Westminster Hall over the following month. Pleading guilty to the charge, he begged George I for mercy, and argued that he had been forced into joining the rising by his compatriots who now stood accused beside him at the bar. However, his appeal was unsuccessful and he was sentenced on 9 February to be hanged, drawn, and quartered on Tower Hill. In contrast to his earlier behaviour, once this sentence was delivered Nithsdale acted with great composure and set down his &#145;last&#146; testament which stressed both his commitment to Roman Catholicism and the claims of the Pretender.<br>
<br>Nithsdale was fortunate indeed that Winifred, Lady Nithsdale, was a woman of fortitude, intelligence, and bravery. On hearing of his capture she immediately rushed to London to be close by him and to lobby hard for his release. Combining a skilful propaganda campaign with frequent visits to the gallery of the House of Lords, she made such a favourable impression upon those she met that rumours began to circulate that her husband was about to be granted a reprieve and a full pardon. However, given the continuing opposition of George I to all such moves, it is most likely that Nithsdale would almost certainly have gone to the gallows had not his wife planned and accomplished a daring rescue. The guards at the Tower were bribed to allow Nithsdale to receive gifts and visitors, and they became confused by the frequent visits of the countess, her maid, and her friends. Under the cover of one of these visits, on the evening of 22 February&#151;the day before his scheduled execution&#151;Nithsdale was able to disguise himself as a woman and slip out of the Tower dressed as his wife's maid. He sought refuge in the Venetian embassy in the City of London and travelled to Dover disguised in the ambassador's livery coat. From there the Venetians helped him to charter a small boat which took him safely to Calais. The full details of his escape, which delighted partisans of the Jacobite movement and became something of a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i>, are to be found in a letter sent by the countess to her sister, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13039/', "Lucy Herbert")</script>, the prioress of the English convent at Bruges, which has been extensively reprinted (<span class="italic">Letter</span>, ed. Grace; Tayler, 46&#150;58; Maxwell Stuart, 163&#150;70).<br>
<br>Shortly after arriving in Paris, in the spring of 1716, Nithsdale fell dangerously ill but recovered. Having secured a loan from Mary of Modena, he attended the Pretender at his court in Avignon and was reunited with his wife at Lille in September 1716. On his departure for Italy in late March 1717, he chose the cheapest form of transport and consequently was almost drowned when the boat he was sailing in foundered in heavy seas. On 26 May 1717, together with the viscount of Kilsyth, he welcomed the Pretender to Rome and officiated at his court as a lord-in-waiting. The following year his wife was appointed lady-in-waiting to Clementina Sobieska, and during 1727&#150;9 she served as governess to Henry Benedict, the titular duke of York.<br>
<br>Although these appointments brought with them considerable financial relief, and despite receiving (from 1717) a pension of approximately 200 livres a month from the exiled Jacobite court, until his death Nithsdale was continuously in debt. His correspondence with his brother-in-law, Charles, fourth marquess of Traquair, makes constant requests for money to be drawn from the estates of his son, while his wife lamented the raggedness of her dress and the poverty of their existence. Unable or unwilling to control his spending, Nithsdale continued to add to their difficulties and wrote of his dislike of, and boredom with, life at Rome. After 1724 the records appertaining to him tail off, and it would seem that apart from arranging the marriage of his daughter, Anne, to John, fourth Baron Bellew, in 1729, he became no more than a half-forgotten cipher at the exiled court. Nithsdale's death in Rome in 1744 obliged his son to settle &pound;200 per annum upon the dowager countess in an attempt to fend off their creditors: Nithsdale was buried in an unknown grave in Rome.<br>
<br>Of his five children, only two reached adulthood; Anne, Lady Bellew, and William, commonly called Lord Maxwell. Maxwell was able to hold his family estates together as the Lords, on 21 January 1723, finally ruled that his father had forfeited only his life-rent through his part in the rebellion and not the Nithsdale lands which were held in trust for his son. The riding cloak in which Nithsdale fled the Tower is on display at Traquair House, Innerleithen, Peeblesshire.<br>
