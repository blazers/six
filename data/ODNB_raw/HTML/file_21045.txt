<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Oxberry,  William</span>  (1784&#150;1824), <span class="occ">actor and printer</span>, was born in Moorfields, London, on 18 December 1784, the son of an auctioneer. At the age of fourteen he was made a pupil of the artist George Stubbs, but having developed at school a fascination for the stage he quickly abandoned painting, first for bookselling and then for indentures with a Tottenham Court Road printer named Seale, who fortuitously was equally obsessed with the theatre. Oxberry appeared in amateur theatricals (in nearby Queen Ann Street and Berwick Street), where he performed in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> and <span class="italic">The Castle Spectre</span>. In the intervals between acting he learned the printing trade, but in 1802 made a bid for the professional stage, and made his first appearance at Watford as Antonio in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>. Later, at Godalming, he was noticed by Trotter, manager of the Worthing and Hythe circuit, and given a renewable engagement as low comedian. While thus employed, he married at Southend in 1806 sixteen-year-old Catherine Elizabeth Hewitt, &#145;a lady of most respectable connexions&#146;  (&#145;Memoir&#146;, 235).<br>
<br>At Worthing, Oxberry impressed Henry Siddons, who recommended him to Covent Garden, where he was offered by John Kemble a three-year contract, beginning at &pound;5 per week. On his d&eacute;but as Robin Roughhead in Allingham's farce <span class="italic">Fortune's Frolic</span> (7 November 1807) reviewers were divided: the hostile <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span> refused to &#145;consider him as a desirable acquisition to the London stage&#146;, yet <span class="italic">The Times</span> liked his &#145;perfect boyish simplicity&#146; and compared his rustic characterization with that of experienced players such as Edward Knight, John Emery, and John Liston. Oxberry played Lord Duberly in Colman's <span class="italic">The Heir-at-Law</span> (14 November), but did not settle at Covent Garden and, before the season was over, negotiated release from his contract. Thereafter at Glasgow and Aberdeen he performed with reasonable success in tragedy. George Raymond, on tour in Scotland, induced him to return to London to play in Siddons's <span class="italic">The Russian Imposter</span> (Lyceum, 22 July 1809), when Samuel Arnold was impressed enough to offer him a three-year rising contract, beginning at &pound;7 a week. He later obtained similar terms at Drury Lane, and a handsome follow-on four-year contract rising from a &pound;9 base to &pound;12 in the last two years. From 1807 to 1811 he also contributed occasional journalism to <span class="italic">The Cabinet</span> and the <span class="italic">Monthly Mirror</span>, which, as well as the <span class="italic">Theatrical Inquisitor</span>, he seems to have edited for a short while.<br>
<br>Oxberry was a regular member of the Drury Lane company between 1812 and 1820, when his roles included Dan in Colman's <span class="italic">John Bull</span>, Justice Greedy in Massinger's <span class="italic">A New Way to Pay Old Debts</span>, Mawworm in Bickerstaffe's <span class="italic">The Hypocrite</span>, and Leo Luminati in Kenney's <span class="italic">Oh! This Love</span>. But when Robert Elliston reduced salaries in 1820, Oxberry left to star at the Sadler's Wells, east London, and Surrey theatres. He also played at the Haymarket in the summer of 1821.<br>
<br>The last years of Oxberry's short life were bound up with Elliston, who took on the Olympic in 1818 and Drury Lane in 1819. At the former, where he is said to have been stage-manager and partly responsible for the theatre's straightened finances, Oxberry made a successful d&eacute;but in 1819 as a playwright with the one-act afterpiece <span class="italic">The Actress of All Work</span> (28 January), usually erroneously attributed to his son. In this essentially single-actor piece, the heroine is in love with a theatrical manager's son. Desperate to join the company, she auditions in six disguises, ranging from &#145;country gawky&#146;, through Parisian opera singer, to amorous eighty-year-old, before convincing the father of her talent. Refused by Frances Kelly, for whom it was written, the part went to Elizabeth Edwin, who &#145;made it a sterling favourite&#146;  (&#145;Memoir of Mrs Edwin&#146;, 208). Later performers, including Mrs Tayleure and Clara Fisher, gave the play an extended life in the repertory. Oxberry altered Pilon's comedy <span class="italic">He Would be a Soldier</span> (1786) into <span class="italic">The High Road to Marriage</span> (9 November 1820), in which he starred himself. It had some success but was never published. Winston credits Oxberry with authorship of <span class="italic">How to Pay your Taxes</span>, which when read in the green room was discovered to be &#145;so bad it had to be given up&#146;  (<span class="italic">Drury Lane Journal</span>, 6). It was licensed for the Olympic in November 1820, but apparently not performed. Another piece, described as &#145;taken from the poem of <span class="italic">Marmion</span>, [was] performed at the West London Theatre&#146;  (&#145;Memoir&#146;, 240). Oxberry was also a leading actor at the Olympic from 1820 onwards (notably as Jerry Hawthorn in Moncrieff's <span class="italic">Tom and Jerry</span>). He gave the address on the opening night of the 1821 season (3 November); but in January 1822 he led an actors' strike when Elliston fell behind with the wages. The theatre remained closed for a month. In the year of his death, Oxberry agreed a new three-year contract with Elliston for the ensuing season at Drury Lane.<br>
<br>Oxberry utilized his skills as a printer throughout his life. From his press at 8 White Hart Yard, Drury Lane (moved to 1 St George's Place, Camberwell, in 1824), he issued playbills and several lightweight collections of anecdotes and miscellaneous material under his own editorship, including <span class="italic">The Theatrical Budget</span> (2 vols., 1809) and <span class="italic">Flowers of Literature, or, The Encyclopaedia of Anecdote</span> (<i>c</i>.1821&#150;2; 2nd edn, 4 vols., 1824), published in shilling numbers, and designed for &#145;amusement without toil&#146;. Considerably more substantial was <span class="italic">Oxberry's [Edition of the] New English Drama</span>, issued as separate plays (from 1818) and collected into twenty (sometimes twenty-two) volumes from 1819 to 1825 or 1826. It featured &#145;the peculiar business of the Performers, and the general directions of the Stage, as practised at the <i>London Theatres Royal</i> &hellip; [with] costumes, acting times for each act, &amp; &#147;Original Remarks&#148; on the merit of every Drama&#146;. Some commentaries were Oxberry's, some were by unknown writers, and eighteen were by William Hazlitt (later reprinted by him elsewhere). Also noteworthy is <span class="italic">Oxberry's Dramatic Biography, and Histrionic Anecdotes</span>, a series of &#145;chiefly original&#146; memoirs of contemporary actors and actresses, edited after Oxberry's death by his widow, Catherine, who claimed her husband delayed publication because of the sensitivity of some of the material: he &#145;could not review as a critic the man that he met as a brother&#146;  (&#145;Advertisement&#146;). Between 1 January 1825 and 15 April 1826, when Mrs Oxberry's responsibility ended, sixty-four memoirs were issued (4 vols.), some written by Oxberry himself. Later that year a fifth volume, usually ascribed to Catherine Oxberry's second husband, Leman Thomas Rede, whom she married in 1824, concluded the original series.<br>
<br>Oxberry's strength as an actor was in dialect and rustic parts, though he was never a great performer, partly perhaps because, unlike rivals such as Liston, &#145;he bestowed too little study on his profession&#146;  (&#145;Memoir&#146;, 239). However, Hazlitt gave a superbly evocative description of his role as Justice Greedy, in whom &#145;apparitions of fat turkeys, chines of bacon, and pheasants dressed in toast and butter, evidently floated in rapturous confusion before his senses&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, 14 Jan 1816). Art seemed to imitate life, for Oxberry had a reputation as a &#145;free liver&#146; and was never happier than feasting and drinking in company with like-minded friends. It was no surprise when in December 1821 he acquired the Craven's Head chop-house in Drury Lane, a popular venue for theatrical people, where &#145;we <i>vocalize</i> on a Friday, <i>conversationize</i> on a Sunday, and <i>chopize</i> every day&#146;  (&#145;Memoir&#146;, 239). Although he tried latterly to moderate his habits, he simply lived life too hard. Following two attacks, from which he appeared to recover, he died of an apoplectic fit at the Craven's Head on 9 June 1824. As the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> put it, an addiction to tavern life &#145;shortened the days of a very shrewd, pleasant, good-humoured man&#146;. Winston was blunter: &#145;this is another instance of early death from drinking&#146;  (<span class="italic">Drury Lane Journal</span>, 89). Oxberry was buried in a vault at St Clement Danes, Strand.<br>
<br>Dark in complexion, with curly dark hair, Oxberry was just under 5 feet 10 inches tall and, in later years, rather plump. A distinctive feature was the piercing and expressive nature of his eyes. Of Oxberry's three children two survived infancy and aspired to theatrical careers: a daughter, who made her d&eacute;but in 1826 at the Olympic, and, much more successfully, a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21046/', "William Henry Oxberry")</script>.<br>
