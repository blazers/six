<span class="headword">Lockhart,  William</span>  (1819&#150;1892), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic convert and Rosminian priest</span>, son of the Revd Alexander Lockhart (1788&#150;1831), rector of Stone and Hartwell, Buckinghamshire, and his wife, Martha (<i>d</i>. 1872), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14575/', "William Jacob (1761/2&#150;1851)")</script>, the statistician, traveller, and politician, was born on 22 August 1819. On his father's side he was a descendant of Alexander Lockhart, Lord Covington, and a cousin of John Gibson Lockhart. After education at Bedford grammar school he matriculated from Exeter College, Oxford, on 17 May 1838, and graduated BA in 1842. While still an undergraduate he felt the attraction of the Roman Catholic church, and confided his difficulties to his mother's friend H. E. Manning, who advised him, on graduating, to join the community at Littlemore then being established by J. H. Newman. However, he continued to be unsettled, and though he had promised Newman to wait for three years before making any move, he was received into the Roman Catholic church at Loughborough on 26 August 1843. He was the first of the Tractarians who went over to Rome, and the much publicized secession prompted Newman to resign his cure at Littlemore and to deliver his valedictory sermon, &#145;The parting of friends&#146;, in which Lockhart is disguised under the character of Orpah.<br>
<br>Lockhart was received into the church by Luigi Gentili of the Institute of Charity, founded by Antonio Rosmini. He entered the same order at Ratcliffe College, Leicestershire, on 29 August 1843 and was ordained there on 19 December 1845; his mother had become a Roman Catholic earlier that year. Based at Ratcliffe until 1853, he travelled widely throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland as a missioner and retreat-giver.<br>
<br>In 1854 Lockhart established a permanent mission at Kingsland in north London. In 1873 he was instrumental in acquiring for his order the disused church of St Etheldreda's, Ely Place, Holborn, originally built in the thirteenth century as the domestic chapel of the bishops of Ely. He remained at St Etheldreda's as rector until his death, though from 1881 he wintered in Rome as procurator for his order. Through the connection of his father's sister, the marchesa de Riario-Sforza, he had an entr&eacute;e to the Roman curia, and was frequently consulted by the pope on English affairs, but diffidence prevented him from seeking or obtaining high preferment.<br>
<br>While at Littlemore, Lockhart had assisted Newman in the translation of Fleury's <span class="italic">Ecclesiastical History</span> and begun the life of St Gilbert of Sempringham, later completed by J. D. Dalgairns. As a writer he is best known for his work on Rosmini, whose teaching he expounded in <span class="italic">A Short Sketch of Modern Philosophies</span> (1882). In 1886 he published the second volume of a voluminous <span class="italic">Life of Antonio Rosmini-Serbati</span>, the first volume of which, by G. S. MacWalter, had appeared in 1883. As editor of <span class="italic">Catholic Opinion</span> from 1867 to 1873, and of <span class="italic">The Lamp</span> from 1871, he was a prolific journalist. He published three works of Catholic apologetics, and at the time of Newman's death in 1890 contributed reminiscences of the cardinal to several journals, including the <span class="italic">Paternoster Review</span>. He was most influential, however, as a preacher and pastor, and was an ardent apostle of total abstinence. Lockhart died of heart failure at St Etheldreda's on 15 May 1892 and was buried at Ratcliffe College on 20 May.<br>
