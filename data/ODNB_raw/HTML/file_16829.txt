<span class="headword">Lloyd,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1648&#150;1713), <span class="occ">coffee-house keeper, publisher, and eponymist of &#145;Lloyd's insurance&#146;</span>, was probably born about 1648, but nothing is known of his origins. He was the proprietor of a London coffee house licensed some time between March 1685 and 1687. This was almost certainly &#145;Mr Edward Lloyd's Coffee House in Tower Street&#146;, referred to in an advertisement in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> (18&#150;21 February 1688). Edward Lloyd and his wife, Abigail, had previously lived in the parish of All Hallows Barking, but by September 1682 they were living elsewhere in Tower Street ward, though Lloyd's occupation at that time is unknown. In 1691 he moved to premises in Lombard Street, at the corner of Abchurch Lane, where Lloyd's Coffee House became the recognized centre of shipbroking and marine insurance business. Previously, the chief meeting-place of the brokers and shipowners had been a coffee house known as John's, in Birchin Lane; the well-known Garraway's also had considerable popularity among customers with maritime connections.<br>
<br>Lloyd appears to have been a man of great intelligence and enterprise. Already by January 1692 he was publishing the first series of a weekly news-sheet, which came out on Saturdays; it was succeeded in September 1699 by a Friday publication, which continued until at least March 1704. The running title for these single-sheet serial publications was <span class="italic">Ships Arrived at, and Departed from several Ports of England, as I have Account of them in London &hellip; [and] An Account of what English Shipping and Foreign Ships for England, I hear of in Foreign Ports</span>. In September 1696 Lloyd also started the newspaper <span class="italic">Lloyd's News</span>, a shipping and commercial chronicle which lasted until 1698, but <span class="italic">Ships Arrived</span> has a better claim, on grounds of similarity of marine intelligence content, to be the predecessor of <span class="italic">Lloyd's List</span>, reputedly the second-oldest continuously published newspaper in the world. Under this title, <span class="italic">Lloyd's List</span> dates from about 1734, some twenty years after Edward Lloyd's death, but rather than being a new enterprise, it is possible that this twice-weekly paper was a further development of the earlier news-sheet associated with Lloyd's Coffee House. If so, Edward Lloyd deserves recognition as an even more significant figure than the association of his name with marine insurance suggests.<br>
<br>Another publication associated with marine insurance, which originated in Lloyd's Coffee House, was <span class="italic">Lloyd's Register of Shipping</span>, first published in 1764. The earliest extant issue of Edward Lloyd's <span class="italic">Ships Arrived</span> was dated 22 December 1696 and that of <span class="italic">Lloyd's List</span>, 2 January 1740.<br>
<br>In 1693 the Hudson's Bay Company looked to &#145;Mr Lloyd the Coffee Man for his Intelligence of the Compies Shipps&#146;, and by 1700 a poem which professed to follow the daily movements of &#145;The wealthy shopkeeper, or charitable Christian,&#146; contained the lines:<blockquote>
<div>Then to Lloyd's Coffee House he never fails<br>
</div>
<div>To read the letters and attend the sales.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>During the next decade Lloyd's Coffee House prospered continuously. Steele mentioned it in the <span class="italic">Tatler</span> (25 December 1710), and Addison described the manners of its frequenters in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (23 April 1711). The merchants and underwriters used it as a free place of meeting, without rules or organization.<br>
<br>In 1769 John Julius Angerstein and other City merchants started an association of underwriters, under the name of New Lloyd's, with its headquarters in Pope's Head Alley, Cornhill. Various improvements in marine insurance were introduced. The adjective &#145;new&#146; was soon dropped, and the offices were moved to the Royal Exchange. This association, improved and reorganized, was incorporated in 1870. At first the contest between the original informal group at Lloyd's Coffee House and New Lloyd's was reflected in rival newspapers, but in due course <span class="italic">Lloyd's List</span> became established as a Committee of Lloyd's publication. In 1884 <span class="italic">Lloyd's List</span> merged with the <span class="italic">Shipping and Mercantile Gazette</span>; later, in 1914, responsibility for the publication reverted to the Corporation of Lloyd's and it resumed the title <span class="italic">Lloyd's List</span>.<br>
<br>Apart from a break (1838&#150;44) at the South Sea House while rebuilding took place following a fire, Lloyd's remained at the Royal Exchange until 1928 when it moved to a larger new building in Leadenhall Street. In 1958 it expanded further into a second building in Lime Street and in 1986 yet another new Lloyd's opened on the site of the earlier Leadenhall building.<br>
<br>Edward and Abigail Lloyd had at least nine children of whom four daughters survived to adulthood. The youngest, Handy, married William Newton, the coffee house head waiter, with whom&#151;and subsequently with her second husband, Samuel Sheppard&#151;she managed the business after her father's death. Abigail died in 1698, and in the same year Lloyd married Elizabeth Mashbourne (<i>d</i>. 1712). His third wife was Martha Denham, whom he married in 1712. Lloyd died in London on 15 February 1713, and was buried at St Mary Woolnoth in the City of London.<br>
