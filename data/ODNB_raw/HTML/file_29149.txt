<span class="headword">Wetwang, Sir  Joseph</span>  (1622/3&#150;1684), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was descended from an old freeholder family of Dunstan, Northumberland. Nothing is known of his early life prior to his marriage to Isabel Middleton (<i>b</i>. 1628) at All Saints' Church, Newcastle, on 23 December 1648. He was engaged in merchant shipping in Newcastle and the east coast at the time of the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652&#150;4). The loss of his ship to the Dutch caused the mayor of Newcastle to petition the admiralty on his behalf for some employment, and in February 1653 he was appointed to command the <i>Sparrow</i>, a small Dutch prize then fitting out at Newcastle. Wetwang spent the rest of the war cruising against Dutch privateers on the east coast, and convoying trade from Newcastle to London and Hamburg. He continued in command of the <i>Sparrow</i> after the war's end, plying off Scotland under the orders of General George Monck. His requests to be transferred to a bigger ship were unsuccessful, and he left the navy when the <i>Sparrow</i> was withdrawn from service in September 1654.<br>
<br>Wetwang probably returned to merchant service, not re-entering the navy until February 1665 when he was appointed to command the fifth-rate <i>Norwich</i>. Wetwang was highly regarded by his superiors at this time, being described by the lord admiral's secretary, Sir William Coventry, as &#145;a very good man&#146;  (Coventry MS 99, fol. 91) and by Monck, now duke of Albemarle, as &#145;a diligent officer and a good seaman&#146;  (NMM, LBK/47). Wetwang moved to the <i>Tiger</i> on 10 May 1666, taking part in Sir Robert Holmes's attack on Terschelling, and remained in command of her until November 1667, being regularly employed on convoy and cruising duties in his native waters. He commanded the <i>Dunkirk</i> and the <i>Edgar</i> briefly in 1668, returning to command the latter in January 1672 at the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Dutch War and fighting in the earl of Sandwich's division of the Blue squadron at the battle of Solebay (28 May 1672). Wetwang was captain of the <i>Warspite</i> over the winter of 1672&#150;3 and of the <i>Henry</i> from March to June 1673, commanding the latter in Prince Rupert's division of the Red squadron at the two battles of Schooneveld (28 May and 4 June 1673) and earning high praise from Rupert for his conduct. On 1 July 1673 he became second captain of Rupert's flagship, the <i>Sovereign</i>, fighting at the battle of the Texel (11 August) and remaining aboard her until the end of October. He then commanded the <i>Newcastle</i>, chiefly in the Mediterranean, from November 1673 to February 1676, capturing a valuable Dutch East Indiaman at the very end of the Third Anglo-Dutch War. In the French war scare of 1678 Wetwang commanded the <i>Monmouth</i> before serving as second captain of the <i>Royal James</i>, the flagship of Admiral Sir Thomas Allin, between March and August. He subsequently went to Flushing and Ostend to organize the re-embarkation of the army which had been sent to Flanders. Wetwang commanded the <i>Northumberland</i> briefly in 1679 before taking his last naval command, the <i>Woolwich</i>, in which he served (again in the Mediterranean) from October 1679 to May 1681. He was knighted on 20 November 1680.<br>
<br>Wetwang had always maintained his mercantile connections, part owning a number of merchant vessels, attempting in 1676 to get a patent for making all merchant bills in the port of London, and becoming in 1679 water bailiff for the rivers Humber and Trent and their tributaries, in reversion. The fact that by 1682 his half pay was three years in arrears seems to have persuaded him to seek employment outside the navy, and in 1682 he became captain of the new East India Company vessel, the <i>Royal James</i>, flagship of the force intended to re-establish trade with Bantam. He died on board his ship at Fort St George, Madras, soon after his arrival, on 12 July 1684. By his will, dated 18 October 1683, Wetwang made bequests to his wife, Isabel, and to his four sons, Robert (<i>b</i>. 1649), John (<i>b</i>. 1651), Samuel (1653&#150;1685), and Joseph. All had held posts in the customs at Newcastle in the 1670s, but Joseph then entered the navy, being dismissed as lieutenant of the <i>Happy Return</i> in 1684 for drunkenness and abusing his captain. He was saved from a court martial only by the kindness of Admiral Lord Dartmouth towards his father, but was in prison by 1687 for other &#145;grand misdemeanours&#146;. Samuel was a factor at Madras at the time of his death on 1 February 1685. Another of Wetwang's sons succeeded him in command of the East Indiaman <i>Royal James</i>, dying in command of her in 1689.<br>
