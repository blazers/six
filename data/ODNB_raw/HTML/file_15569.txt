<span class="headword">King, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1637), <span class="occ">politician and landowner</span>, was born of a Yorkshire family, although the name of his parents and details of his early years remain unknown. He is first recorded in Ireland in July 1585 as secretary to Richard Bingham, governor of Connaught. By early 1601 he was deputy vice-treasurer of Ireland, a post of considerable practical importance, and went on to become clerk of the crown in chancery and clerk of the hanaper (12 July 1603), muster-master-general and clerk of the cheque (11 May 1609), and a member of both the Irish privy council (June 1609) and the council of Munster (20 May 1615). He was knighted on 7 July 1610. At an unknown date he married Catherine, daughter of Robert Drury, nephew to Sir William Drury, lord deputy of Ireland. They had six sons and three daughters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/55437/', "Dorothy Dury")</script>.<br>
<br>Following the completion of the conquest of Ireland in 1603 King was able to use his government connections to benefit massively. A poor system of record keeping and ignorance of geography allowed well-placed officials to use royal grants to claim lands far in excess of what was intended. Between 1603 and 1607 he received lands in twenty-one different counties. He probably sold most of this and concentrated his holdings in co. Roscommon, having a residence at Boyle. He invested heavily in developing Boyle and appears as constable of Boyle Castle from September 1606. In 1613&#150;15 he sat as MP for Roscommon county but only after Oliver St John, governor of Connaught, had manipulated electoral proceedings. He was joint caretaker governor of Connaught in 1615.<br>
<br>Despite his land interests in co. Roscommon, King continued to pursue an administrative career and based himself in Dublin, living at Baggotrath. With his vast experience, particularly in financial affairs, he would have exerted considerable influence behind the scenes, being a regular attender of council meetings and a member of many government land commissions. He was also commissioner for the plantations of Wexford (1614) and Leitrim and Ely O'Carroll (1619). For obscure reasons in June 1615 he insinuated that Lord Deputy Chichester was mismanaging royal finances, thereby precipitating the governor's removal from office. Political motives aside he always showed great concern for the health of the Irish exchequer. He died on 4 January 1637 at Lichfield, Staffordshire, and was buried in Boyle on 30 March. He was succeeded by his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15593/', "Sir Robert King")</script>. His eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15558/', "Edward King")</script>, drowned in 1637; an early John Milton poem, &#145;Lycidas&#146; (1638), lamented his death.<br>
