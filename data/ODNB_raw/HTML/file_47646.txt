<span class="headword">Whiston,  Robert</span>  (1808&#150;1895), <span class="occ">headmaster and reformer of cathedral charities</span>, was born in Derby on 20 November 1808, one of eleven children of William Whiston, solicitor, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hopkinson. Educated at Repton School, he matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1827, where he was elected a scholar in 1830. He graduated BA in 1831, having been ranked among the senior optimes in the mathematical tripos and top of the second class in the classical tripos. He proceeded MA in 1834. In 1833 he was elected a fellow of Trinity, but did not reside in the college, instead becoming the headmaster and proprietor of the Rochester and Chatham classical and mathematical school, a private establishment which flourished under his leadership. He was ordained deacon in 1840 and priest in 1841.<br>
<br>As a successful local schoolmaster in holy orders, and a fellow of a Cambridge college, Whiston was the obvious candidate to fill the vacant post of headmaster of the Rochester Cathedral Grammar School (or King's School), to which the dean and chapter of Rochester appointed him in December 1842. Under his predecessor, the Revd Daniel Francis Warner, the school had emptied of pupils, despite the requirement under the cathedral's sixteenth-century statutes to educate twenty poor boys. Whiston soon restored a full complement of scholars, as well as bringing in pupils as boarders, who lodged in a house, the Old Palace, which he fitted up at a personal cost of &pound;4000. At his insistence, the dean and chapter of the cathedral built a new school house, which opened in 1844.<br>
<br>Whiston came into conflict with the dean and chapter when he made allegations of financial mismanagement on their part, and especially of their failure to carry out the intention of Henry VIII's founding charters. In February 1848 he requested them to raise the value of the four exhibitions tenable by former pupils of the school while studying at Oxford and Cambridge universities: these stipends had remained unchanged since the 1540s, whereas the emoluments of the dean and canons had increased some thirtyfold over the same period. Rebuffed, in August 1848 Whiston laid before the chapter further instances of their neglect of statutory obligations, including a failure to provide sufficient maintenance for the twenty boys entitled to free education. Ignored by the chapter and fortified by legal advice from Sir John Romilly and W. D. Lewis, he appealed to the cathedral's visitor, George Murray, bishop of Rochester, who declined to act, seeking instead to divert the question into the court of chancery, with its inevitable delays and costs. Whiston's retort was to publish in May 1849 <span class="italic">Cathedral Trusts and their Fulfilment</span>. Based on manuscript researches in Lambeth Palace library and elsewhere, Whiston's pamphlet sought to expose the extent to which cathedral chapters founded by Henry VIII deviated from the instructions of their founder, while enriching themselves from the surplus revenues of the foundations. Members of the Rochester chapter were singled out for personal attack, along with &#145;the late dean of Worcester&#146; (George Murray), for perpetuating corruptions. The pamphlet went through five printings.<br>
<br>On 29 June 1849 Whiston was summoned to the chapter house at Rochester and dismissed from the headmastership, on the ground that his publication &#145;cast odium on the dean and chapter&#146;, and contained &#145;many scandalous and libellous passages&#146;, which rendered him &#145;utterly unfit and unworthy&#146; to be entrusted with the instruction of the boys  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 Aug 1849). Whiston's refusal to accept his removal led to three years of litigation and public controversy. He brought an action for reinstatement in the court of chancery, which held (August 1849) that jurisdiction lay with the cathedral visitor, though adding that the chapter had acted wrongly in not allowing him to speak in his defence. In September 1849 the chapter issued a fresh deed of removal, Whiston being permitted to read out a long statement in defence of his action, published as <span class="italic">Protest or Demurrer</span> (1849). A month later the chapter confirmed his ejectment, and appointed a replacement, the Revd Henry Meeres, chaplain of Buckinghamshire county gaol. Whiston refused to give up the occupation of the school and playground, and continued to teach the majority of the boys, only a few of whom attended the premises run by Meeres, as the two schools ran in competition within the cathedral precincts.<br>
<br>In November 1849 Whiston took his case to the court of queen's bench, gaining an order to restore him to the headship. The dean and chapter challenged the decision and after a delay of fourteen months gained their point when the court held (April 1851) that the matter was one for the visitor, Murray. This decision proved a turning point in Whiston's campaign, as public opinion mobilized in his favour. A leading article in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (6 May 1851, 5) pointed out that while the dean and chapter may have prevailed on a procedural technicality, the substance of Whiston's allegations remained unanswered. Although himself a Conservative in politics, Whiston gained the support of radicals and anti-clericals. Public subscriptions were raised to meet his costs, and MPs&#151;notably Benjamin Hall&#151;took up his case and the wider issue of cathedral finances. By June 1851 Meeres's school had only one pupil while Whiston, who was translated to a senior fellowship by his Cambridge college in October 1851, continued to attract pupils.<br>
<br>Finally Whiston took his case to the cathedral's visitor, who sat with two lawyers, Sir James Parke and Stephen Lushington. Whiston represented himself at the well-attended hearings at Doctors' Commons, in April and June 1852. The bishop of Rochester's judgment, delivered on 20 October 1852, concluded that Whiston's pamphlet had libelled the dean and chapter, but that this did not amount to an offence of sufficient gravity to warrant his dismissal. He was to be reinstated on 1 January 1853, though without retrospective payment of any stipend for the period since his dismissal and with a caution against repeating the allegations. <span class="italic">The Times</span> (22 Oct 1852, 4), which had backed Whiston's stand, thought the judgment shabby, and maintained that the chapter had acted unfairly towards Whiston, whose attacks upon cathedral abuses the paper found entirely justifiable. He did not return quietly, and under the threat of further controversy the dean and chapter raised the stipends of grammar school boys, university exhibitioners, and minor cathedral office holders specified in the school's founding statutes.<br>
<br>Whiston remained headmaster of the Rochester Cathedral school until 1877. He relinquished his college fellowship following his marriage, on 5 July 1855, to Ellen (1833&#150;1879), daughter of Richard Wedd, surgeon. They had three sons and a daughter. He continued to tussle with the chapter over its failure adequately to support the grammar school, which, however, continued to thrive. He insisted on competitive entry and upheld high academic standards. Himself a classical scholar, he produced an edition of Demosthenes (2 vols., 1859&#150;68) in the series <span class="roman">Bibliotheca Classica</span>, and characteristically published a pamphlet (1859) in reply to a reviewer who had criticized his editing. He also contributed to William Smith's dictionaries of Greek and Roman antiquities and Greek and Roman biography and mythology. In 1869, concerned to preserve the classical status of his school, he sent a petition to the endowed schools commissioners and was successful in ensuring that they classified it as a first-grade school, teaching Latin and Greek and preparing boys for university entry. The new scheme laid down by the commissioners in 1877 provided for Whiston to receive a pension, enabling him to retire.<br>
<br>Whiston continued his public activities as a justice of the peace in Kent and was one of the first elected members of Kent county council. He died at his home, the Old Palace, Rochester, Kent, on 3 August 1895. In 1929 a memorial was erected in Rochester Cathedral at the direction of his eldest son, commemorating Whiston and his litigation  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 July 1929, 13).<br>
<br>Physically large, bewhiskered, and energetic, Whiston was an effective headmaster, though his cantankerousness seems to have hindered his career. He was an example of the &#145;almost professional exposer of &#147;jobs&#148; and abuses&#146; who frequented the mid-Victorian public scene  (Burn, 233). His activities were part of a wider reform movement which prompted the appointment in November 1852 of a royal commission to inquire into cathedral churches in England and Wales and the creation in 1853 of a permanent commission to scrutinize charities. Whiston is now perhaps best remembered for having supplied some of the inspiration for Anthony Trollope's Barsetshire novels, the first instalment of which (<span class="italic">The Warden</span>, 1855) made topical reference to him.<br>
