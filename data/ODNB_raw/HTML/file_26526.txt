<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stillingfleet,  Edward</span>  (1635&#150;1699), <span class="occ">bishop of Worcester and theologian</span>, was born at Cranborne, Dorset, on 17 April 1635. He was the seventh son of Samuel Stillingfleet and his wife, Susanna, daughter of Edward Norris of Petworth. His father's family came originally from Yorkshire and had estates at Stillingfleet, near York. He was educated at Cranborne grammar school and after 1648 at Ringwood, Hampshire. In 1649 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, and obtained a scholarship on the earl of Salisbury's nomination. He graduated BA in 1653 and was immediately elected into a fellowship on 31 March. He proceeded MA in 1656 and was awarded his DD in 1668.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>In 1654 Stillingfleet went to live at Wroxhall, Warwickshire, with Sir Roger Burgoyne, who in 1657 appointed him to the rectory of Sutton in Bedfordshire. Meanwhile he had been clandestinely ordained by Ralph Brownrigg, the deprived bishop of Exeter. In 1659 he married Andrea, daughter of William Dobyns of Dumbleton. They had two daughters who died in infancy and a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26527/', "Edward Stillingfleet (1661&#150;1708)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26525/', "Stillingfleet, Benjamin (1702&#150;1771)")</script>], who became Gresham professor of physic in 1698, and also, through the influence of his father, rector of Wood Norton and Swanton Novers, Norfolk. His second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Nicholas Pedley, a serjeant-at-law, died in 1697. They had seven children, of whom, on the evidence of his will, only two certainly survived, Anne Fyshe, who married Humphrey Fyshe of Gray's Inn, and James, who became rector of Hartlebury, Worcestershire, when Stillingfleet became bishop of Worcester.<br>
<br>After the Restoration Stillingfleet became preacher and lecturer at the Rolls Chapel, and held posts at the Temple Church and at Serjeants' Inn. His family connections and these posts &#145;brought him into acquaintance and great esteem with all the judges and gentlemen of station&#146; in the law, among them Sir Matthew Hale and Chief Justice Vaughan  (DWL, MS 201.30, fol. 30). This interest in legal and constitutional matters emerged in his later writings. Though he was able to conform at the Restoration Stillingfleet did not forget his friends who had not found this possible. For instance Richard Kennet had been ejected from a parish in Cheshire; Stillingfleet helped him find a large house in Sutton where he ran a successful school. In January 1665 Stillingfleet was appointed to the rectory of St Andrews, Holborn, which he held until 1689. Being outside the cramped space of the City, St Andrews was a large church with a substantial auditorium; it was not damaged by the fire of London but under Stillingfleet's aegis was nevertheless rebuilt by Wren between 1684 and 1686. In this large church Stillingfleet rapidly became a popular preacher and as such first made his name. On 23 April 1665 Samuel Pepys went to the Whitehall Chapel and &#145;heard the famous young preacher&#146; whom the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London &#145;believe is the ablest young man to preach the gospel since the apostles. He did make a most plain, honest, good, grave sermon in the most unconcerned manner that ever I heard in my life&#146;. On 9 May 1669 Pepys &#145;could not get a place at St Andrews&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 6.87 and 9.548). A very different sort of auditor for Stillingfleet was the extremely devout and puritanical Mary Rich, countess of Warwick, who recorded four times on hearing or reading one of his sermons that her heart was &#145;affected&#146; or &#145;melted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir of Lady Warwick</span>, 1847, 89, 90, 144, 215). On the other hand there were parishioners who complained that he only &#145;vouchsafes&#146; to preach, &#145;coming in late when the reading of prayers is over&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Pepys's summary of his style is, no doubt, just. His sermons covered a great range of subjects: doctrinal, historical, pastoral, devotional, and even, on occasions, political. They were, as Pepys said, &#145;plain&#146; in the style of the day, and expository, eschewing the rhetorical flourishes of preachers of a former generation. Stillingfleet, however, did not lack courage as a preacher: on 13 March 1667 he preached before the king on the text &#145;fools make a mock of sin&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.17&#150;30). On another occasion he told the king: &#145;it is the love of sensual pleasure which is most apt to ensnare men in the practice of sin&#146;  (ibid., 1.224). (This sermon may in fact have been aimed at John Wilmot, earl of Rochester, the libertine and freethinker, who had published a satirical attack on reason.)<h2>
<a name="WritingsonprotestantunityandtheChurchofEngland16591680"></a>Writings on protestant unity and the Church of England, 1659&#150;1680</h2>Alongside his fame as a preacher Stillingfleet soon became known as a writer. Throughout his life he produced a steady stream of lengthy works of immense learning, so that when he died forty years after his first publication he was, without doubt, the leading theologian and apologist of the Church of England. His work fell into three phases. Up to the revolution of 1688 he wrote on issues which were of paramount importance to the Church of England in positioning it in relation to a broader protestantism and to Rome. During the early years of his episcopate he wrote at slightly less length on more immediately practical concerns; for his last three years he returned to major theological controversies prompted by what he felt were attacks on, or dangers to, the fundamentals of Christianity. His first published work was <span class="italic">A Weapon Salve for the Church's Wounds</span>, usually known as the <span class="italic">Irenicum</span> (1659). Acutely aware of the church's divisions at the end of the interregnum, and of the chances of healing them at the forthcoming Restoration, he addressed mainly the question of the form of church government which underlay the divisions. &#145;Christ never intended any one form as the only means of peace in the church&#151;or he would have made it clear&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.55). There was no &#145;law of nature&#146; which determined church practice and this left the magistrate free &#145;in determining things left at liberty by the word of God, in order to the peace and government of the church&#146;  (ibid., 2.185). Matters left thus indifferent must be determined by the lawful authority of the church and must be obeyed by church members on opting to join the church. But these indifferent matters were not unalterable, &#145;but may be reversed, limited or changed according to the different ages, tempers or inclinations of men by the same power which did determine them&#146;  (ibid., 2.198). (This rule was repeated in the preamble to the commission on comprehension of September 1689 which Stillingfleet must have had a part in drafting.) There was &#145;no single model for the form of church government in scripture&#146; or in apostolic practice: &#145;it is a matter of liberty &hellip; a nation joining in the performance of Christian liberty is a true church of God &hellip; there must be a form of ecclesiastical government in a nation as a church, as well as of civil government over it&#146;  (ibid., 2.225, 2.253). Episcopacy was not at first universal and &#145;even after episcopal government was settled in the church, yet ordination by presbyters was looked on as valid&#146;  (ibid., 2.392). Bishops and priests were one office and <i>in extremis</i> princes as well as bishops might ordain priests since &#145;all Christian princes have committed unto them immediately by God the whole care of all their subjects, as well concerning the administration of God's word for the cure of the soul, as concerning the ministration of things political&#146;  (ibid., 2.400). Here Stillingfleet was quoting a highly Erastian paper of Thomas Cranmer's &#145;now just published&#146;  (ibid., 2.396) on the power of the state over the church. This was indeed an eirenic starting point for church negotiations and one in line with reformed practice on the continent, but Stillingfleet backed away from its extreme Erastianism in the second (1662) edition of the <span class="italic">Irenicum</span> without ever entirely retracting it.<br>
<br>Stillingfleet was twice involved in negotiations for comprehension in the 1670s. In 1675 he and John Tillotson, dean of Canterbury, met the leading nonconformists Richard Baxter, William Bates, Thomas Manton, and Matthew Poole to discuss a comprehension bill in negotiations instigated by bishops George Morley and Seth Ward; the negotiators came to an agreement, but the scheme was dropped given the impossibility of the bill getting passed in the face of the antipathy of most of the bishops. In late 1679 the presbyterians Manton and John Howe waited&#151;in vain, as it turned out&#151;at Stillingfleet's house to meet Bishop William Lloyd of St Asaph to discuss further proposals for comprehension. Stillingfleet was also a member of the circle of rising London clergy&#151;who also included Tillotson, John Sharp, and Thomas Tenison&#151;patronized by the Finch family: the lord chancellor, the first earl of Nottingham, and his eldest son, Daniel. The latter, a moderate tory Anglican, was a strong advocate of comprehension in 1679&#150;80 (as he was to be ten years later) as a means of forging protestant unity against the common Catholic threat.<br>
<br>The failure of the comprehension schemes in the 1670s and the mounting exclusion crisis meant that times had indeed changed by the time Stillingfleet next entered into print on the battlefield of protestant ecumenical politics in 1680. When he preached his sermon <span class="italic">The Mischief of Separation</span> on 11 May 1680, delivered before the whig lord mayor of London, Sir Robert Clayton, times had changed. It was no longer a matter of negotiations for a church from a virtual <i>tabula rasa</i>, but of forming a united protestant front in the wake of the Popish Plot and with the prospect of a Roman Catholic &#145;magistrate&#146; should James, duke of York, succeed to the throne. Moreover Stillingfleet admitted to his bishop, Henry Compton, that his own view had changed: &#145;I do not deny &hellip; that I now think much more is to be said of the apostolical institution of episcopacy than I at that time apprehended&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.138). He started his sermon with a simple proposition: &#145;the true notion of a church is no more than of a society of men united together for their order and government according to the rules of the Christian religion&#146;  (ibid., 1.283). The dissenters did not deny that the Church of England had true doctrine and right sacraments, &#145;but they blame their non-conformity on the strict obligation to all of conformity&#146;  (ibid., 1.290). But if they could join the services occasionally without sin, &#145;why not constantly&#146;  (ibid., 1.291). He recognized that many nonconformists were accepting their sectarian position, and therefore would prefer toleration to comprehension within the Church of England, but since &#145;wise and good men will bear with anything for the sake of order &hellip; they will consider the common danger that threatens us all by means of our divisions&#146;  (ibid., 1.299).<br>
<br>The sermon caused a furore. Dissenters led by Richard Baxter and John Owen rose up against it. Baxter protested that his own practice was always to avoid clashing with the work of the established church and never to separate or support a rival congregation unless driven to do so. But where conformists say that &#145;bishops and presbyters are distinct orders &hellip; the churches are differing in the very order or species of the constitutive government&#146;  (R. Baxter, <span class="italic">Mr Baxter's Answer to Dr Edward Stillingfleet's Charge of Separation</span>, 1680, 8). Baxter was constantly attacking Stillingfleet's pragmatism and asking &#145;which is the constitutive? Whether the king or a sacerdotal head?&#146;  (ibid., 8). In his reply Stillingfleet ignored this. However, William Sherlock, writing ostensibly in his defence, did respond to the idea of the constitutive part of the church: &#145;the nature and essence of the church does not consent in religious assembling, but in its union with Christ&#146;, which &#145;requires that the national church be governed by common advice and consent&#146;, which is achieved by bishops and some presbyters in synod  (W. Sherlock, <span class="italic">A Discourse about Church Unity</span>, 1681, 305, 504). Another Anglican who found Stillingfleet's doctrine of the church wanting was Samuel Lowth, later a nonjuror. In his <span class="italic">Of the Subject of Church Power</span> (1665) he had attacked the <span class="italic">Irenicum</span> and, replying to Stillingfleet's further development of the argument of <span class="italic">The Mischief</span>, held that the church is &#145;a particular society &hellip; distinct from the commonwealth, subsisting by powers of its own&#146;  (S. Lowth, <span class="italic">A Letter to Dr Stillingfleet</span>, 1687, 9). A very different person writing against Stillingfleet was John Locke, who must have been known to Stillingfleet about this time. His &#145;Critical Notes&#146; were an unpublished critique of Stillingfleet: &#145;it suffices for the union of protestants that they keep up a friendship under different forms or modes of worship&#146;  (Marshall, 102).<br>
<br>Stillingfleet was clearly taken aback by the opposition to his sermon. In 1683 he produced a major work, <span class="italic">The Unreasonableness of Separation</span>, which enlarged upon the earlier sermon. Even if occasional conformity were accepted as the norm there would be no end to dissenters pressing for their various ideas of a perfect church, and so perpetuating schism. He admitted that various reforms were desirable in the Church of England, especially in the church courts to restore the puritan ideal of church discipline; but dissenters maintained their nonconformity only because of certain &#145;accidental appendices&#146; and some &#145;circumstantials of worship&#146; whereas the Church of England's schism with Rome rested on doctrinal issues&#151;a very different matter  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.621, 636).<h2>
<a name="Otherwritings16621685naturaltheologyantiCatholicpolemicandchurchhistory"></a>Other writings, 1662&#150;1685: natural theology, anti-Catholic polemic, and church history</h2>The <span class="italic">Irenicum</span> had been followed in 1662 by <span class="italic">Origines sacrae</span>, written while Stillingfleet was still at Sutton. This monumental work of natural theology &#145;made him known to the world&#146; and went into five editions before 1680  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.18). He believed that there was &#145;sufficient evidence in point of reason to prove &hellip; the existence of the deity&#146; and that this belief was universal  (ibid., 2.231). Those who were squeamish about accepting revelation could have &#145;sufficient evidence in point of reason to prove to them the existence of a deity&#146;  (ibid., 2.231). The idea of God was imprinted on man's mind by God who &#145;hath stamped an universal character of himself upon the minds of men&#146;  (ibid., 2.234, 242). The truth of religion was attested to by &#145;the necessity of the belief of the creation of the world&#146;  (ibid., 2.265). In four long sermons (which were probably never preached as no date is given for them) Stillingfleet argued that the immortality of the soul could be deduced &#145;by the force of natural reason&#146; and was the basis, even for non-Christians, &#145;of moral happiness through virtue and quelling passions&#146;, and of the coherence of society  (sermons 41, 42, and 44, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.625&#150;78).<br>
<br>Stillingfleet's next major writings, which occupied him until&#151;and indeed after&#151;the Revolution were polemical works against Roman Catholics, in which labour he had been encouraged by Humphrey Henchman, bishop of London from 1663 to 1675. The main works were <span class="italic">A Rational Account of the Grounds of Protestant Religion</span> (1665), <span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning the Idolatry Practiced in the Church of Rome</span> (1671), <span class="italic">An Answer to Mr Cressy's Epistle</span> (1674), <span class="italic">A Defence of a Discourse Concerning Idolatry</span> (1676), and <span class="italic">Several Conferences Concerning the Idolatry of the Church of Rome</span> (1679), with many shorter works and pamphlets. In this lengthy series Stillingfleet had three main opponents. These were John Sergeant, Hugh Cressy, and Thomas Godden. All three were former Anglicans who had converted to Rome, and who had trained in France and returned to England as controversialists. Sergeant was the most prolific, but Stillingfleet regarded him as &#145;unfit of all men to undertake this cause&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 6.362). The main arguments tended to be repetitive, but as the years went on Stillingfleet, in his advocate's way, piled detail upon detail. Nowhere is his prodigious historical learning more evident, not only in patristic and orthodox, but also in medieval, theology. The first issue was the Roman Catholic accusation against the Church of England of schism. Here he adopted the traditional Anglican defence: the schismatics were not the Anglicans: &#145;it was not we who left your church, but your church that left her primitive faith and purity&#146;  (ibid., 3.325). The Romans compounded this by setting up such absolute conditions for the return of non-Catholics to their fold: &#145;you are the greatest schismatics in the world&#146;  (ibid., 3.324). But the issue which most exercised him was that of the Roman claim of infallibility. He said that it added nothing to Christian belief: &#145;it is impossible for you to give a better account of faith by the infallibility of your church, than we can do without it&#146;  (ibid., 3.110). Scripture, tradition, and the exercise of reason to judge credibility were sufficient, especially as absolute certainty was not possible as the human mind could not encompass the truths of Christianity. Stillingfleet was in any case deeply affronted by the fact that infallibility left no place, as he saw it, for human judgement and reason. It was, in fact, a recipe for scepticism. He also made great play with the circular reasoning of infallibility. Where did it lie? How could a final statement be reached? And so on: &#145;you avoid not the circle&#146;  (ibid., 3.123). For himself, as he constantly reiterated, he was content with the moral certainty provided by scripture, tradition, and reason, provided that reason was not contradicted. Scripture was not irrational, but was above reason. For Stillingfleet faith was &#145;a rational, discursive act of the mind&#146;, not of the will  (ibid., 4.134). In the later works of this series Stillingfleet concentrated more on the &#145;errors and corruptions&#146; which had infiltrated the Roman church since it departed from primitive tradition. There were the usual protestant accusations, though delivered in more than usual detail: the corruptions and irregularities of general councils, especially the Council of Trent, which created more difficulties than it solved; the doctrine of purgatory, which undermined the necessity of virtuous living as did the easiness of gaining absolution through the confessional; the &#145;dangerous enthusiasms and raptures&#146;  (ibid., 4.615), which were encouraged and found especially in the monastic orders. He particularly attacked the doctrine of transubstantiation which &#145;overthrows the very nature of a sacrament, leaving no external visible sign&#146; whereas the consubstantial view of both the bread and the body together in the sacrament avoided this  (ibid., 6.437). Finally, he felt that the invocation of saints and the multiplication of miracles (he made great play with the Holy House of Loreto) did indeed introduce an idolatry which was akin to pagan practices, and he refused to accept the Roman Catholic justification of &#145;relative worship&#146; of the saints  (ibid., 6.79). This was a position also reached at the same time by the future nonjuror Henry Dodwell in a series of volumes which ran parallel to those of Stillingfleet. It was an accusation which Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon regretted.<br>
<br>In 1685 Stillingfleet published his <span class="italic">Origines Britannicae</span>. The book aimed at &#145;the rescuing of this part of church history &hellip; from the fabulous antiquities which have so much debased the value and eclipsed the glory of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.1). He had in mind the contemporary accusations that Christianity was shored up by the complicated teachings of &#145;priestcraft&#146;&#151;a theme to which he often returned especially after John Toland published his <span class="italic">Christianity not Mysterious</span> in 1695. He set about, therefore, to explain his system in sifting historical evidence to arrive at &#145;evident demonstration&#146;. This had required &#145;much labour and industry in searching and comparing good and bad authors&#146;  (ibid., 3.1). His second purpose in the book was to show that the church had been founded in England independent of Rome. Early kings had not been converted by the pope, and Joseph of Arimathea was a fabled figure, invented by later monks. Nevertheless the church in England went back to apostolic times and may have been founded by St Paul, a claim which was accepted well into the nineteenth century. This and his other purely historical works, such as the posthumously published &#145;<i>Discourse of the true antiquity of London and its state in Roman times</i>&#146;, were much valued and quoted in the eighteenth century.<h2>
<a name="AdvancementandStPauls16651688"></a>Advancement and St Paul's, 1665&#150;1688</h2>While engaged in these writings Stillingfleet was also steadily advancing in the hierarchy of the church. In 1667 he received the prebend of Islington at St Paul's, which he exchanged for Newington in 1672. In a letter to the dean and chapter on 9 June 1670 the king recommended that he be given the &#145;next vacant place&#146; as &#145;he hath by his learned writings done such excellent service for the Church of England, particularly in defence of Christian truth&#146;  (Worcs. RO, BA 9832 I). In 1672 he became a residentiary canon of St Paul's and on 22 September 1673 he and another residentiary were reported as &#145;making all the haste they can to come into their new houses&#146; rebuilt after the great fire  (Bodl. Oxf., Tanner MS 145, no. 183). In December 1674 Dean William Sancroft appointed him receiver and chamberlain, acknowledging &#145;how many and weighty your employments are&#146;  (DWL, MS 201.38, fol. 10). He was also a chaplain to the king and a canon of Canterbury. In 1677 he was appointed archdeacon of London, the senior of the four London diocesan archdeacons. There he would have had his first practical experience of the workings of the ecclesiastical courts, which were later to exercise him so greatly. He was also in 1678 prolocutor of the lower house of the Canterbury convocation, not a weighty commitment at this time since convocation, though meeting formally, had in fact been in abeyance since 1662. But with a few exceptions there is very little evidence of his actual activities in these various offices. In 1673 Burnet persuaded the duke of York, newly converted to Catholicism, to see Stillingfleet though the latter &#145;had no hopes of success&#146; in converting him back to the Church of England  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 2.26). The discussion turned on the sensitive issue of the pope's powers of deposing princes, but predictably the duke remained unimpressed.<br>
<br>Also in 1673 Stillingfleet was appointed a commissioner for the rebuilding of St Paul's. On 18 May 1674 the full commission met and, to Christopher Wren's dismay, turned down the previously accepted Greek cross plan for the cathedral, of which he had had made a model 20 feet long. The opposition was led by the three residentiary canons, of whom Stillingfleet must have been the most influential. Criticisms of the Greek cross centred on the fact that the choir, with semicircular seating, would not be suitable as a separate space for smaller congregations. It was also realized that it would not be possible to build the cathedral in sections and so start services before the whole building was completed. But no doubt the fundamental objection was conservative opposition to a ground-plan which was so at variance with the traditional plan of English cathedrals. Around this opposition clerical opinion gathered, and the king and Archbishop Sheldon did not feel able to uphold the more radical&#151;and continental&#151;scheme. So Wren was sent back to his drawing board. Stillingfleet continued as a commissioner, attending most of the committee meetings which oversaw accounts and issued the detailed individual contracts to the craftsmen concerned. During Compton's suspension as bishop of London by James II from 1686 to 1688 Stillingfleet was particularly responsible, as either the dean or the bishop had to be present at every meeting of the commission.<br>
<br>In January 1678 Stillingfleet succeeded William Sancroft as dean of St Paul's. In October, at the time of the Popish Plot, there was a rumour that he might be kidnapped and murdered, and &#145;thereupon on Sunday about forty persons for a guard waited on the doctor to church and home&#146;  (<span class="italic">House of Lords MSS</span>, 2.68). In November 1678 he preached the sermon to the Commons on the fast day appointed in response to the discovery of the plot.<br>
<br>In 1680 Stillingfleet entered into the pamphlet debates which followed the failure of the whig attempt to impeach the king's first minister, the earl of Danby, when the case fell through the votes on his behalf of the bishops. The whigs claimed that the bishops could not sit as judges in cases (such as impeachments) which could involve the death penalty. In the vigorous tract warfare that ensued medieval precedents were freely bandied. Stillingfleet entered the lists somewhat late with <span class="italic">The Grand Question Concerning the Bishops' Right to Vote in Cases Capital</span>. He was specifically responding to Denzil, Lord Holles's <span class="italic">A Letter of a Gentleman to a Friend</span>. Much argument had turned on Henry II's constitutions of Clarendon and his case against Archbishop Becket. Stillingfleet &#145;showed that Holles's handling &hellip; was upside down&#146;  (Goldie, 94): Henry had actually intended the bishops to do their secular duty by taking part in the prosecution. The argument from canon law that they should not be involved in capital cases was an attempt by the papacy to draw them from the king's service into the papal power. Stillingfleet showed that the bishops were not a third estate of the realm but full members of the Lords summoned by royal writ as were the hereditary peers. This was an argument for the centrality of the bishops in the English polity which paralleled his Erastian arguments against separation from the Church of England in <span class="italic">The Mischief of Separation</span>, published in the same year. Gilbert Burnet, who much admired Stillingfleet's learning, commented that <span class="italic">The Grand Question</span> &#145;put an end to the controversy in the opinion of all impartial men, showing more skill and exactness in judging these matters than all that had gone before him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 2.215). It was the beginning of a new role for Stillingfleet&#151;that of advising on legal, and especially constitutional, matters.<h2>
<a name="Therevolutionof1688comprehensionandthereformofthechurchcourts"></a>The revolution of 1688, comprehension, and the reform of the church courts</h2>With the accession of James II, Stillingfleet moved centre stage. He and a group of leading London clergy, which included John Tillotson, Thomas Tenison, and Simon Patrick, as well as Bishop William Lloyd of St Asaph, organized the opposition to the reading from church pulpits of the declaration of indulgence of 4 April 1687 by which the king offered a much wider toleration to protestant dissenters and Roman Catholics than was eventually incorporated in the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 1689. They also formed a pressure group to strengthen Sancroft and other bishops in their opposition; this was based on the king's illegal use of his suspending power, a formula in which Stillingfleet had a hand. In the end the clergy in London and elsewhere refused by huge majorities to read the declaration, though Stillingfleet absented himself from the cathedral that day. At this time, too, tentative steps were taken, in which Stillingfleet was fully involved, to draft a scheme of comprehension to bring dissenters into the church and, as part of this in 1688, to revise the liturgy. These moves were frustrated by the arrival on 5 November of William of Orange and his subsequent march on London. Stillingfleet took no part in the invitation to William. Indeed in the spring of 1688 he and Tillotson had advised Daniel Finch (by now second earl of Nottingham) against becoming involved. But on 14 January 1689 the old pressure group met at the deanery to set on foot proposals for comprehension which included the problem of the re-ordination of nonconformist ministers, liturgical and ceremonial change, the revision of the ecclesiastical canons, and the reform of the church courts to make them more effective in enforcing discipline. These plans were delayed when William made a supremely tactless speech to parliament on 16 March 1689 urging &#145;the admission to public office of all protestants that are willing and able to serve&#146;  (J. Israel, &#145;William III and Toleration&#146;, <span class="italic">From Persecution to Toleration</span>, 1991, 129&#150;70). The tories rallied to the cry of &#145;the church in danger&#146; and for the moment plans for both toleration and comprehension were shelved. On 8 March Stillingfleet had advised Nottingham that the idea of comprehension would be better presented to convocation &#145;without which our clergy will hardly come to it&#146;. But since at the moment convocation was not possible it would be better to appoint a committee to consider the revision of the canons and the reform of the courts, &#145;a work too great to be undertaken by any one person &hellip; I rather think the whole summer will be little enough for it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 2.194). At length on 4 September a royal warrant appointed a commission of ten bishops and twenty senior clergy to draw up proposals for comprehension. The agenda commenced with<blockquote>rites and ceremonies &hellip; Being things in their nature indifferent and alterable &hellip; it is reasonable upon weighty and important consideration, according to the exigencies of times and occasions [that] changes and alterations should be made therein, as those that are in place and authority should from time to time deem either necessary or expedient.</blockquote>(This formula can be attributed to Stillingfleet.) The writ also proposed reform of church discipline:<blockquote>And whereas the book of canons is fit to be reviewed and made more suitable to the state of the church, and whereas there are divers defects and abuses in the ecclesiastical courts &hellip; and particularly there is not sufficient provision made for the removing of scandalous ministers and for reformation of manners either in ministers or people. (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1689</i>, 242&#150;3)</blockquote>Stillingfleet was elected bishop of Worcester on 12 October 1689 and was consecrated at Fulham on the following day. He was one of the first of William III's appointments, the see being vacant by the death of William Thomas. But he did not proceed at once to Worcester, being engaged on preparing the terms for comprehension. The commission met twenty-two times between 3 October and 18 November. Stillingfleet attended thirteen of these meetings but was not present at the meetings after 3 November, though in fact he was still in London and attending the House of Lords as the new bishop of Worcester. The early discussions were almost entirely on the revision of the liturgy and here Patrick and Tenison took the lead, drawing on the liturgical draft of 1688. Stillingfleet took little or no part except in the discussion on the use of the Athanasian creed. His interest had been in the revision of the canons and the reform of the courts, matters which were not reached before convocation voted comprehension down. He had, as noted above, been involved with Tillotson in previous comprehension discussions in 1675, and he must have known about the plans of 1680 and 1688, which were those which incorporated the latest thinking. But his proposals for the canons and the courts, preserved at Lambeth, were the most radical to date. The canon requiring church attendance should be dropped; canons &#145;with no penalty annexed&#146; should be revised; &#145;causes not of their own nature spiritual&#146; should be taken out of the church courts &#145;to avoid the objections of civil lawyers&#146; and make the church courts more credible; the sentence of excommunication in cases not relating to religion, such as tithes, should be replaced, especially as the follow-up to it to secure a prison sentence was so often ineffectual; exempt jurisdictions and peculiars with independent jurisdiction within a diocese should be abolished, which would avoid many abuses such as clandestine matrimony. These and other proposed reforms, long overdue, would have revolutionized the church courts  (LPL, MS 1743, 111).<br>
<br>Some time later, no doubt as a result of his direct experience of his own courts, Stillingfleet had even more drastic thoughts about reform. He diagnosed the main problem as being the exercise of plenary instead of summary jurisdiction in the church courts, even for trifling cases. This drew out time and increased the fees involved. He also envisaged in &#145;proposals towards the reviving of discipline among the clergy&#146; the revival of rural deaneries of several parishes under a &#145;grave and fit&#146; rural dean. He traced the medieval precedents for this and opined that where rural deaneries were &#145;discontinued it is mainly through the neglect of discipline which hath been too notorious among us, the consistory courts drawing all to themselves&#146;. The deanery meetings should be for mutual edification and the reporting of recalcitrant clergy to the bishop. &#145;It cannot be denied that, while the church hath been much concerned to preserve its doctrine and worship the cause of discipline hath been too much neglected&#146;  (DWL, MS 201.39, fol. 25). These thoughts echoed to a remarkable degree the proposals put forward in the aborted Worcester House declaration of 1660. He also quoted a short canon in Cranmer's abortive <span class="italic">Reformation legum ecclesiasticarum</span> of 1553 of which printed editions existed at this time. Tucked away among its various very conservative regulations for church courts there was provision for an annual &#145;archpresbyter&#146; in each deanery to keep his area under inspection and report malfeasance to the bishop for summary examination  (G. Bray, ed., <span class="italic">Tudor Church Reform</span>, 2000, canon 26S, 351f).<br>
<br>Stillingfleet knew that such radical reforms would be hard to implement, as proved to be the case. The nearest he came to improving the workings of the courts was in his <span class="roman">Small Tithes Act</span> of April 1694. By this the recovery of small tithes by vicars was removed from the consistory courts and vested in the plenary jurisdiction of justices of the peace. He recognized that there could be problems because some of the justices might have local interests but they would have to proceed &#145;according to the rights and customs and usages of the several places&#146;, and the vicars would be spared the expenses and delays of plenary procedure in the consistory court  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Discourses</span>, 393). In the event, though he was in London, Stillingfleet was ill and it was John Sharp, archbishop of York, who piloted the bill through the Lords.<h2>
<a name="BishopofWorcester"></a>Bishop of Worcester</h2>Once he reached his diocese Stillingfleet was an exemplary bishop, within the constraints of illness and the traditions of the time which required bishops to reside in London for the House of Lords in the winter. During his ten-year episcopate he conducted three visitations, in 1690, 1693, and 1696. The primary visitation in 1690 was presumably peripatetic but by 1696 he was probably too ill with gout to undertake the travelling and attendant entertaining; of the 1693 visitation no records remain. The primary charge to his clergy was typical of that which a thorough bishop would issue: residence, daily offices and frequent celebrations of holy communion, preaching, and catechizing were all emphasized; a full list of confirmands must be sent to the bishop beforehand. He condemned extempore preaching: &#145;loose and careless &hellip; an ill habit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.627). Towards nonconformists he recommended &#145;such an open temper as is constant with the preserving of the constitution of our church&#146;  (ibid., 3.361). Diligence in visiting as great as that of dissenting clergy was vital, especially with the sick: &#145;it is no matter to run over some prayers and so take leave&#146;  (ibid., 3.362). The clergy must have a &#145;great care of your conversations&#146;, an exhortation repeated in his third charge, &#145;for we live in an age whereas the contempt of the clergy is too notorious not to be observed&#146;  (ibid., 3.661). Clerical demeanour must not be so high as to put off the parishioner nor so low as to cause scandal: &#145;the doing good of your people's souls ought to be the principal and chief design of your thoughts, studies and endeavours&#146;  (ibid., 3.657).<br>
<br>In August 1692 Stillingfleet visited his cathedral where the open scandals exasperated him: cathedrals ought to be &#145;the nurseries of the church&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Discourses</span>, 264ff). He asked the most detailed questions as to the behaviour, learning, residence, and church attendance of the clergy. The answers of the dean and chapter were not satisfactory. The chapter claimed that immemorial practice justified their performance, especially on the matter of residence. Stillingfleet would have none of it. How, he asked, could immemorial practice supersede the obligations of the statutes: &#145;wherein is this ambiguity? Can any words be plainer on the intentions of the founder?&#146; Even a royal mandate could not override the statutes  (DWL, MS 201.39, fols. 16&#150;22). Another local dispute in which he was involved concerned the administration of Worcester charities and his right as bishop to be a trustee; this called forth the usual barrage of medieval precedents.<br>
<br>The only other evidence on Stillingfleet's Worcester episcopate is to be found in the archives of his consistory court. His first biographer records the &#145;general satisfaction&#146; given by his presiding there, where &#145;he soon found it sunk in its reputation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.110&#150;11). In fact it was not so deplorable (compared with courts in other dioceses) as he painted it: the chancellor, Sir Timothy Baldwyn, was not a regular absentee and Stillingfleet's predecessor, William Thomas, did occasionally sit himself, for example on 15 April 1685 and 16 September 1686. Nevertheless the bishop would have found most of the daily entries deferred until the next court day when he himself started sitting on 28 August 1690. After a gap until 14 July 1692 he sat reasonably regularly between spring and autumn, when he would not have been in London for parliament. In 1692 he presided five times; in 1693 twelve; in 1694 three; and in 1695 eleven. On 30 July 1695 John Price LLB appears for the first time, often thereafter sitting with Stillingfleet; in 1696 the bishop only sat twice and Price appeared as chancellor: Stillingfleet had evidently been running Price in until he was satisfied, for the bishop's last appearance was on 3 June 1696. It is difficult to see from the records what the precise effects were of his frequent appearances (unprecedented in other dioceses) but no doubt he was justified in saying that he succeeded in speeding up the proceedings by punishing &#145;vexatious and dilatory subterfuges&#146;: when he was sitting in 1695 proctors were often fined for &#145;retarding the process&#146;  (Worcs. RO, BA 2722, 794.011. 4a, 4b, 4.iii). His biographer says that he drew up new rules for his court, which did away with &#145;many useless obsolete terms and forms&#146;, but if that is true they have not survived  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.113).<h2>
<a name="Occasionalwritings"></a>Occasional writings</h2>During the early years of his episcopate Stillingfleet produced a number of (for him) short works on issues which were exercising the minds of churchmen. He had been under some threat from James II's commission to oversee the affairs of the church. He wrote about it at the time but did not publish <span class="italic">Of the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction with Respect to the Legal Supremacy</span> until 1689. The definition of the monarch's supremacy and dispensing power was a very complex legal and historical issue, involving in particular the key statutes of the English Reformation. But Stillingfleet insisted that the act of 13 Chas II. c.12. at the Restoration overthrew all these in abolishing the court of high commission. As to the dispensing power the king could not dispense in matters which were <i>mala per se</i> (&#145;inherently wrong in themselves&#146;) rather than merely <i>mala prohibita</i> (&#145;wrong by human decree&#146;): &#145;I cannot but conclude that the dispensing power is a kind of mental reservation which quite alters the meaning and design of law&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.762).<br>
<br>In the same year Stillingfleet published a book with what was no doubt the intentionally ironic title of <span class="italic">The Unreasonableness of a New Separation</span>. This was a contribution to the nonjuring debate about the position of those who felt bound by the oath of allegiance they had taken to James II. He took the pragmatic view that James had forsaken the public good and so nullified the oaths taken to him &#145;with apostasy from the principals of the Church of England. &hellip; Under a state of usurpation, notwithstanding these oaths taken to the rightful prince, men are bound to do those things which tend to the public safety as well as their own&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.940). Bishop Thomas of Worcester would have been a nonjuror, but died before his principles could be put to the test. So Stillingfleet escaped the strictures of Henry Dodwell and other nonjurors that in accepting the bishopric he was creating a schism in the church. But that did not inhibit him from entering the lists against the nonjurors. In 1691 he produced his <span class="italic">Vindication of their Majesties' Authority to Fill the Sees of the Deprived Bishops</span>. It was reasonable not to accept a see where the deprived incumbent was an old friend; but otherwise the deprived bishop had lost his post and brought &#145;unpardonable scandal both to the enemies and to the friends of government and to the government itself&#146;  (ibid., 3.960). These views may reflect his earlier Erastianism.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">A Discourse Concerning Bonds of Resignation</span> followed in 1695. Stillingfleet believed that the practice of giving a bond to resign a post at a later request on being appointed (usually to a living which was being reserved by the patron for a relative when he was old enough to be ordained) was a &#145;growing mischief&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.738). The practice was simoniacal as it involved the biblical sin of buying a religious position&#151;what he called &#145;trafficking&#146;  (ibid., 3.719). Even though not strictly illegal an &#145;equitable construction&#146; would supply the &#145;defects of our law&#146; and Sir Edward Coke had declared &#145;our common law doth detest simony&#146;  (ibid., 3.735). In the end its rejection lay with the conscience of the patron and the incumbent. Many bishops must have been under pressure from influential landowner patrons to turn a blind eye to bonds, and even Burnet had accepted such an arrangement to finance other posts in his diocese. Tenison consulted Stillingfleet as to whether such an arrangement was acceptable and Stillingfleet replied emphatically in the negative, however good the cause: &#145;such examples are dangerous &hellip;. It was to no purpose to go about to persuade lay patrons against bonds of resignation, so long as bishops gave such examples&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellaneous Discourses</span>, 38). Perhaps no book of his brought him more letters of gratitude. Tillotson had consulted him and Nicholas Stratford, bishop of Chester, wrote that the work came &#145;seasonably at a time when I stood in need of it&#146; as he had been &#145;in discourse with several of my clergy&#146; who considered the practice acceptable  (DWL, MS 201.38, fol. 38).<h2>
<a name="TheHouseofLordsandthecourtofdelegates"></a>The House of Lords and the court of delegates</h2>Stillingfleet attended the winter sittings of the House of Lords as often as his gout allowed&#151;on an average six times a year until 1696 and 1697. Undoubtedly this decline was due to the worsening of his affliction after more than twenty years. On 4 December 1697, for instance, Tenison wrote to say that he had been dispensed by the king because he was not fit for the journey to London, but must attend if he improved. Most of the letters to him from his colleagues refer to his affliction and on 3 May 1698 William Stanley, who had succeeded him as archdeacon of London, wrote with an infallible cure&#151;&#145;drinking fresh urine of a cow, then fasting, a pint every morning&#146;  (DWL, MS 201.38, fol. 17). On 11 December 1697 Bishop Edward Fowler of Gloucester wrote to thank him for his book against John Locke: whatever malady Stillingfleet has, it is not to his head, &#145;such books, so fast from the press&#146;  (DWL, MS 201.38, fol. 54). In fact Stillingfleet's advice was sought by almost half the members of the episcopal bench including archbishops Tillotson and Tenison (often on appointments) and Compton, his old bishop in London. William Lloyd, formerly bishop of St Asaph and latterly of Lichfield, was his most frequent correspondent with queries about statutes for his cathedral, visitations, recalcitrant clergy, and, above all, his courts. These letters testify to Stillingfleet's reputation as a man not only of unrivalled learning but of great wisdom, as does the fact that he was frequently chosen to sit on the court of delegates, the final court of appeal on ecclesiastical cases, established at the Reformation to take the place of Rome. This court did not have a permanent existence but, rather, judges were appointed <i>ad hoc</i> for each case: a panel of three or four bishops aided by common law judges sat on the most important cases, otherwise they were left to lay judges. Between 4 November 1689, when Stillingfleet made his first appearance, and his death in 1699 the delegates heard 233 cases; of these fifty-three had episcopal delegates; Stillingfleet sat on thirty-five of them, while seven of the cases from which he was absent came in a period between January 1696 and November 1697 when his gout was increasingly incapacitating him. In sum, during this decade Stillingfleet established an unprecedented hegemony over the court of delegates, none of the other bishops being appointed so often.<br>
<br>Stillingfleet was appointed by William III to a number of episcopal committees, for instance on church appointments and to supervise the reconstruction of the Irish church. He was an early supporter of the lay and ecumenical movement of the Society for the Reformation of Manners. Indeed it was he who in 1691 persuaded Queen Mary to patronize the society with the Middlesex justices, which first brought the movement to public attention. The pious Queen Mary was an ardent supporter of Stillingfleet and, on Tillotson's death in 1694, urged his candidature for Canterbury on her husband. She &#145;pressed the king earnestly for him&#146;, recorded Burnet, &#145;but as his ill health made him not capable of the fatigue that belonged to this province, so the whigs did generally apprehend that both his notions and his temper were too high&#146;, whereas Tenison had &#145;many friends and no enemies&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 4.238).<h2>
<a name="Finalwritingsanddeath"></a>Final writings and death</h2>From 1695 Stillingfleet turned his pen back to major themes of theology and philosophy with a number of works, the common theme of which was that the church was in danger from the undermining of its fundamental beliefs. First he revised (or continued) his earlier <span class="italic">Origines sacrae</span>, examining &#145;modern atheistical hypotheses&#146;. He attacked Thomas Hobbes's thesis &#145;that religion is owing to man's ignorance and superstitious fear&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.61). Next he condemned Descartes's ideas of motion and the mechanical laws of nature as explaining the universe without the intervention of providence. Both these thinkers, he would have believed, undermined natural theology which claimed that belief in God and the immortality of the soul could be reached without recourse to scripture. This work was laid aside because of his controversy with John Locke and was only published posthumously.<br>
<br>Instead in 1696 Stillingfleet published <span class="italic">Two Discourses Concerning Christ's Satisfaction</span>, written against Socinians and antinomians. He identified &#145;the main point of difference between us seems to be whether the death of Christ had respect to the justice or the mercy of God. &hellip; Whether [Christ] did really undergo the punishment of our sins in order to bring a sacrifice of atonement for them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.229, 405). On these issues the bishop insisted on a full penal substitutionary theory of atonement against the Socinian argument that Christ's sacrifice was not &#145;performed on earth&#146; but &#145;offered in heaven&#146;  (ibid., 3.295). <span class="italic">A Discourse in Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity</span> followed in 1697. Socinian pamphlets had &#145;swarmed so much among us within a few years&#146;, he complained  (ibid., 3.413). Indeed Socinianism had now become in England unitarianism, with the controversy started by Stephen Nye's <span class="italic">Brief History of the Unitarians</span> of 1687. To the unitarian accusation that trinitarian doctrine was neither scriptural nor logical Stillingfleet replied &#145;the doctrine of the trinity [was] not received in the Christian church by force or interest&#146;, and fell back on his usual argument that &#145;God asks us to believe things beyond our comprehension &hellip; but he never requires us to believe contradictions&#146;  (ibid., 3.435, 448).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Vindication</span> also provided the first salvo in what became the last great crusade of Stillingfleet's life&#151;the controversy with John Locke&#151;where he criticized Locke's <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span>, whose philosophy of knowledge had been appropriated and deployed against trinitarian Christianity by the deist John Toland. Stillingfleet clearly felt that Locke's position and influence as a philosopher&#151;and in particular his central and revolutionary theory of knowledge&#151;constituted the greatest danger undermining the accepted theology of the church. He, perhaps better than anyone, was in a position to confute the threat presented by Locke. He wrote two more books against Locke in the form of letters, in 1697 and 1698, to which Locke replied with three substantial volumes, the last published after the bishop's death; these were <span class="italic">Letter to the Right Reverend Edward, Lord Bishop of Worcester</span> (1697), <span class="italic">Mr Locke's Reply &hellip; to the Bishop of Worcester</span> (1697), and <span class="italic">Mr Locke's Reply to &hellip; the &hellip; Bishop of Worcester's Answer to his Second Letter</span> (1699). Stillingfleet accepted that Locke was a Christian but said<blockquote>I cannot believe that you intended to give any advantage to the enemies of the Christian faith &hellip;. But consider in our age wherein the mysteries of faith are so much exposed by the promotion of scepticism and infidelity, it is a thing of dangerous consequence to start such new methods of certainty as are apt to leave men's minds more doubtful than before. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.530)</blockquote>(The theme of certainty was recurrent in these interchanges.) Locke denied that this was the result of his writing but Stillingfleet cited to him Toland's <span class="italic">Christianity not Mysterious</span> which clearly echoed Locke: &#145;our knowledge is in effect nothing else but the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas&#146;  (J. Toland, <span class="italic">Christianity not Mysterious</span>, 2nd edn, 1697, 10). Toland, Stillingfleet argued, &#145;thought he had reason to reject all mysteries of faith which are contained in propositions upon your grounds of certainty&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.531). Stillingfleet's thoroughness in pursuing the controversy (even into Toland's second edition) at the end of his life, and in increasing pain, is surely remarkable. After this Locke &#145;distanced himself from Toland&#146;  (Marshall, 409).<br>
<br>Stillingfleet attacked Locke's epistemological formula that sensation and reflection were the basis of knowledge as &#145;very insufficient&#146; to provide an analysis of all thought and experience. There must also be &#145;some general ideas which the mind doth form&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.504). He was willing to &#145;grant that by sensation and reflection we can come to the powers and properties of things, but our reason is satisfied that there must be something beyond these, because it is impossible that they should subsist by themselves&#146;  (ibid., 3.509). He wanted an underlying common substructure of substance or essence which was more than Locke's &#145;modes and accidents&#146;  (Locke, <span class="italic">Letter</span>, 38). Locke would grant no more than that such substance was &#145;a collection of several ideas combined into one abstract idea&#146;  (ibid., 165). He insisted that such a collection could have no more reality than a name it was given: &#145;the complex idea is the nominal essence and nothing else&#146;  (ibid., 206). Stillingfleet's reaction to this new form of the medieval heresy of nominalism was that &#145;I do think that there is a difference between that [that is, a belief in universals] and making them mere names or signs of ideas&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.350). Locke's ideas were too destructive: &#145;if we cannot come at a rational idea of substance, we can have no principle of certainty to go upon in this debate&#146;  (Locke, <span class="italic">Letter</span>, 15, quoting Stillingfleet).<br>
<br>In the Christian context Stillingfleet felt that Locke's teaching attacked by implication the doctrine of the Trinity: &#145;upon your notions of nature and persons [that is, as particular individuals] I do not see how it is possible to defend the doctrine of the Trinity &hellip; the doctrine of the Trinity and Incarnation are past recovery gone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.576, 579). Second, the two differed on the resurrection of the body. Here Locke challenged the later overlay which Christian theologians put on scripture: scripture spoke of the resurrection of the dead, not of the body. And in any case the human body changed many times in one lifetime; personal identity was the key to continuity and therefore resurrection. Stillingfleet would have none of this: it must be the same body which is resurrected  (Locke, <span class="italic">Reply to &hellip; Second Letter</span>, 168). Third, there was the immortality of the soul. For Stillingfleet &#145;the great ends of religion and morality are best secured by proofs of the immortality of the soul from its nature and properties&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.513). But Locke could not contemplate &#145;that the soul is immaterial put together in this way&#146;  (Locke, <span class="italic">Reply to &hellip; Second Letter</span>, 148).<br>
<br>Stillingfleet was the only critic to whom Locke deigned to reply. The works are full of quotation and counter-quotation&#151;Locke always meticulously accurate, Stillingfleet less so. But for all that there is a feeling that they never really encountered each other. Locke drew a distinction between faith and knowledge and was determined to defend his epistemology, whatever its consequences; Stillingfleet felt that faith and knowledge could not be separated, that however much he protested to the contrary Locke's thinking was a Trojan horse inside traditional Christian philosophical scholasticism, and that &#145;all the work of centuries of harmonizing belief and human knowledge was falling apart&#146;; Stillingfleet was &#145;trying to hold on to the possibility of a meaningful religious world &hellip; The bishop keenly pointed out some of the basic difficulties in Locke's thinking&#146;  (Popkin, 316&#150;17).<br>
<br>It is easy to see that as he approached death Stillingfleet felt that his world was indeed falling apart, and that he must do his best to deploy all his knowledge and scholarship to hold everything together. The extent of his success is showed by the fact that in the eighteenth century those theologians who continued the controversy with Locke trod in his footsteps.<br>
<br>Stillingfleet died on 27 March 1699 at his London home in Park Street, Westminster, and was buried in Worcester Cathedral. His &#145;noble&#146; library was split at sale, the manuscripts going to Robert Harley and the books, said to number 6000, after prolonged negotiation to the archbishop of Armagh, to be housed in a special building in Dublin. In his will dated 4 April 1698, he left virtually his whole estate to his son James, rector of Hartlebury; bequests went to his other son, Edward Stillingfleet, and to his married daughter, Anne Fyshe; lesser sums went to more distant relatives and &pound;20 to his housekeeper, Mary Bryan, &#145;who hath been a careful servant in my illness&#146;  (Worcs. RO, BA 982 (ii) 899.918). This suggests that none of his other daughters survived him. His first&#151;and only&#151;biography prefaces the six folio volumes of his <span class="italic">Works</span>. It was thought that its author was Richard Bentley, who had been his chaplain and tutor to his son James. But a more likely candidate is Timothy Goodwin, who was his chaplain when he died and composed the Latin eulogy on his tomb in Worcester. However, Bentley, later the highly litigious master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and certainly never one to award easy praise, shall have the last word on Stillingfleet: &#145;whom even envy itself will allow to be the glory of our church and nation; who, by his vast and comprehensive genius, is as great in all parts of learning as the greatest next to himself are in any&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Works of Richard Bentley</span>, 3 vols., ed. A. Dyce, 1836, 1. pref. xlix. 1).<br>
<br>It is not difficult to agree with this handsome estimate. It is much more difficult to arrive at an estimate of Stillingfleet in the light of contemporary knowledge, especially as so little archival material about him survives. He is often classified as a latitudinarian, or low- or broad-churchman, along with Tillotson and other contemporaries. But, apart from the fact that the label latitudinarian is unsatisfactory because it is virtually impossible to define, he does not fit happily into this stable. Tillotson and Tenison were without doubt more low church than he, and Burnet was probably right in saying that the whigs thought both his notions and his temper were too high for them. Clearly he moved away from the liberal notions expressed in the <span class="italic">Irenicum</span>. From the time of his elevation to Worcester he was a particular friend of the high-church Archbishop Sharp of York, who wrote to him in the most affectionate terms. In fact Stillingfleet was, no doubt, his own man and undoubtedly conscious of his standing in intellect and learning. At the same time he was essentially conservative, summing up in himself the core Anglican beliefs of the seventeenth century while not espousing their more extreme forms. Perhaps this is why when, in the eighteenth century, the concerns and interests shifted, his theological&#151;though not his historical&#151;influence declined. Yet in the end one is left with great admiration for his industry, courage, and integrity.<br>
