<span class="headword">Eadburh <span class="st"> [Eadburga]</span></span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>716&#150;<em>c.</em>746), <span class="occ">abbess (probably of Wimborne)</span>, first appears in the historical record as the recipient of a letter from Boniface, written while he was still known by the Anglo-Saxon name of Wynfrith, recounting at her request the recent vision of a monk at Much Wenlock. The letter can be dated to 716&#150;19. Three further letters survive from Boniface to Eadburh, written after he was established in Germany and she had been appointed abbess, and one to her from Lull while he was a deacon; the date range for these letters has been estimated as <i>c</i>.735&#150;746. In one of his letters Boniface commissions Eadburh to copy the epistles of St Peter in gold, and there are other general references to books that she had supplied to the mission, as well as clothing. It is usually assumed that she is the Eadburh whom Leoba identified, in a letter to her kinsman Boniface, as her teacher; this evidence makes it unlikely that the Eadburh who was Boniface's correspondent was the same person as the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8379/', "Eadburh (d. 751)")</script> who was abbess of Thanet. Leoba's biographer Rudolf of Fulda makes no reference to Leoba's studying in Kent and implies that she remained at Wimborne until she joined Boniface in Germany. It is also unlikely in the political climate of the first half of the eighth century that a nun would be sent from Wessex to Kent. It would appear then that Eadburh was at one time in charge of the education of the nuns at Wimborne. The form of address in Boniface's letters suggests that Eadburh had been appointed abbess by about the middle of the 730s. The natural assumption is that she was abbess of Wimborne, but the identification is not completely certain because it is not known when Abbess Tetta ceased to be in charge of the foundation, and Leoba's biographer Rudolf implies that Tetta was still abbess when Leoba left for Germany, an event which cannot be closely dated but which is also likely to belong to the mid-730s, though it could be as late as 748. The recognition of Eadburh as West Saxon is important for an appreciation of standards of learning and literacy in the West Saxon church in the first half of the eighth century, and among its nuns in particular. The reference to the epistles written in gold is especially valuable as no surviving manuscript of this calibre has yet been identified as coming from a West Saxon foundation.<br>
