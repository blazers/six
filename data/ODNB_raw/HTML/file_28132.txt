<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Henry Halford</span>  (1811&#150;1885), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born at 1 Montague Place, London, on 27 August 1811, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28137/', "Sir John Vaughan (1769&#150;1839)")</script>, subsequently justice of common pleas, and his first wife, the Hon. Augusta St John (<i>d</i>. 1813), daughter of Henry Beauchamp, twelfth Baron St John of Bletso. In 1822 Vaughan went to Rugby School where Thomas Arnold, according to his son Matthew, considered him the ablest boy in the school. (His prize essay there was published in 1829.) He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1829, and was awarded a Fell exhibition, often, but not in his case, the preliminary to a studentship. His contemporaries included W. E. Gladstone and H. G. Liddell. Vaughan took a first class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1833, and in 1835 was elected to a fellowship at Oriel, one of the most coveted distinctions in Oxford, having, it was reputed, read nothing beforehand except Bacon's <span class="italic">Advancement of Learning</span>. He was awarded the chancellor's prize in 1836 for an English essay (highly praised by Mark Pattison) on &#145;The effects of a national taste for general and diffusive reading&#146;. Vaughan was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1838 but never practised as a barrister, and in 1839 became clerk of assize for the South Wales circuit, which gave him a permanent income of &pound;500 a year plus fees. In 1839 he stood for election to the recently revived praelectorship of logic (subsequently the Wykeham professorship), but was defeated because of his unwillingness to reside in Oxford and the bitter opposition of the Newmanites who accused him of heresy for questioning scriptural authority as the sole basis of morality. In 1842 he was deprived of his fellowship for refusing to take holy orders; in the same year he acted as a special poor law commissioner, inquiring into the employment of women and children in agriculture. Undeterred by failure, he sought election to the White professorship of moral philosophy in 1841 and 1846, and for a second time to the praelectorship of logic in 1848.<br>
<br>In 1848, Vaughan was appointed professor of modern history at Oxford. As the nominee of a prime minister committed to university reform, the first layman to hold the chair, and the victim of Tractarian hostility and obsolete statutes, he was enthusiastically welcomed by the radical reformers who included Liddell, A. P. Stanley, Mark Pattison, and Benjamin Jowett. In his two inaugural lectures delivered shortly before the creation of the school of jurisprudence and history, Vaughan enunciated a scientific and evolutionary view of history then novel in Oxford. History was defined as &#145;a disclosure of the critical changes in the condition of society&#146;, and although it did not repeat itself was subject to laws discovered by observation and by &#145;instincts of expectation&#146;, a concept later echoed in a famous phrase of Pasteur. Although Lord John Russell was dissuaded from appointing him to the royal commission on Oxford University in 1850, Vaughan had immense influence on the commission's recommendations for reviving the professoriate through his friendship with Liddell, who was a commissioner and was said to idolize Vaughan. In evidence often anticipating Mark Pattison, Vaughan proposed a body of professors who would &#145;investigate, reflect, and write&#146;, even if they were not very active as lecturers, pursuing learning for its own sake wherever it led. The university was to be governed by an intellectual oligarchy of mainly lay professors with a permanent majority in reformed institutions and in five faculties, including a separate faculty of theology. Lay fellowships were to be increased and college endowments redistributed. Vaughan's idea of a university not only strengthened the university at the expense of the colleges but advocated a secular university imposed by the state and divorced from the Church of England. He was bitterly attacked by Pusey, who accused him of Germanizing the university, and defended himself in <span class="italic">Oxford Reform and Oxford Professors</span> (1854). An acrimonious correspondence with Pusey was published in a <span class="italic">Postscript</span> in the same year. As opinion polarized, Vaughan became the champion of a radically reformed professoriate.<br>
<br>Gladstone, who piloted the <span class="roman">Oxford Bill</span> through parliament in 1854, judged that the professorial question would be best left to the university, but Vaughan believed the collegiate and Anglican character of Oxford made legislation essential to implement the commission's proposals. Petitions to a sympathetic Lord John Russell having failed, Vaughan, without the support of the radical reformers except for Liddell and apparently ready to see the bill fail, took the drastic step of lobbying the anti-clerical dissenting opposition in parliament by preparing briefs and drafting amendments. His allies deserted when concessions were offered on religious tests, but obstruction caused such serious delays that Gladstone was forced to make sweeping revisions to the bill, none of which favoured the professoriate, and complained of the opposition offered by &#145;the <i>London</i> portion of the Oxford Reformers&#146; (Vaughan resided in Hampstead). As a reformer Vaughan was an original and powerful advocate, but his intransigence won few converts, and he undoubtedly contributed to the animus towards professors in general which lingered in Oxford for many years.<br>
<br>From 1849 to 1856, except in 1855, Vaughan went annually to Oxford to lecture on English and continental history to the reign of King John, but only the inaugural lectures were published. His audiences were spellbound by his eloquence and presence. Liddell wrote that:<blockquote>His features were large, well-defined, and mobile, especially his eyes [which] were fixed on you with an intensity of expression that seemed to pierce to your very soul. He had an immense &#145;fell&#146; of rough hair [which] gave a sort of wild Olympian character to his head. (H. L. Thompson, <span class="italic">Henry George Liddell</span>, 1899, 124&#150;5)</blockquote>Of his lecture on the death of William I, George Butler recorded, &#145;the lecture was a powerful, poetical, and sometimes sublime oration &hellip; Vaughan is almost too brilliant, both in conversation and in lecturing. He dazzles one&#146;  (J. E. Butler, <span class="italic">Recollections of George Butler</span>, n.d., 88). So well attended were his lectures in 1852 that he transferred to the Sheldonian. Yet Vaughan's contribution to the establishment of historical studies at Oxford was negligible, and neither Goldwin Smith, Freeman, nor Stubbs mentioned him in their inaugural lectures. A principal cause of his lack of influence was a refusal to live in Oxford. He disliked Oxford society and preferred the intellectual Bohemian salon at Little Holland House, to which he was introduced by his wife's aunt Mrs Thoby Prinsep, and where he was affectionately known as Boodh (Buddha). For study he preferred the London Library, of which he was a foundation subscriber, to the Bodleian. Above all, his elevated conception of the professoriate was irreconcilable with the prevalent view in Oxford that, at least until more fellowships in new studies were provided by the reform of college statutes, the professor ought to be a superior tutor. To Vaughan this meant that learning was sacrificed to education and was replaced by the drudgery of &#145;hand-to-mouth&#146; lecturing with almost continuous residence. The irony of a radical reformer perpetuating the longstanding abuse of non-resident professors was not lost on Vaughan's detractors. Owing to his non-residence, he was never an examiner, he was not consulted when special subjects were introduced in 1855, and he was ineligible for election to the hebdomadal council, the governing body of the university. When Oriel endowed the chair on condition that the incumbent resided, Vaughan resigned in March 1858, despite the pleas of Jowett and others who even petitioned Palmerston on his behalf.<br>
<br>In 1861, Vaughan served on the public schools commission where Lord Lyttelton praised his &#145;laborious industry, fertility of thought and subtlety of expression&#146;, while regretting that &#145;his practical wisdom is not commensurate&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 44239, fol. 235). Vaughan contributed an account of Rugby and a remarkable minority report on mental development and liberal education in which he advocated the teaching of natural science. As with university reform, many of his ideas later gained acceptance.<br>
<br>Vaughan retired to Upton Castle, Pembrokeshire, in 1867, intending to complete the philosophical treatise on the origin of moral ideas which had occupied him since the 1840s. He was initially influenced by Hume and later by the study of history and anthropology, but the complexity of the subject and its long gestation eventually overwhelmed him. Substantial fragments of the manuscript survive but inexplicable losses have destroyed its coherence. Vaughan believed that many of his ideas were appropriated by J. M. Wilson and T. Fowler in <span class="italic">Progressive Morality</span>, which was printed in 1875 but not published until after Vaughan's death. He published a three-volume work on Shakespeare's tragedies (1878&#150;86).<br>
<br>On 21 August 1856, Vaughan married Adeline Maria Jackson (1837&#150;1881), the eighteen-year-old daughter of John Jackson MD and Maria Pattle. It was, said Goldwin Smith, &#145;the most startling event of the kind since the marriage of Luther&#146;  (Oxford, Christ Church Archives, MS Estates 117, fol. 22<i>v</i>). The surviving children were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36635/', "William Wyamar Vaughan")</script> (headmaster of Rugby), Augusta, Margaret, Millicent, and Emma. Vaughan died at Upton Castle on 19 April 1885. The <span class="italic">Oxford Review</span> recalled the impress which he &#145;stamped on the best men of his day&#146; by his &#145;rare and commanding intellect&#146;, but Goldwin Smith described his life as &#145;one of genius, mournfully, almost tragically, thrown away&#146;  (G. Smith, <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span>, 1911, 274).<br>
