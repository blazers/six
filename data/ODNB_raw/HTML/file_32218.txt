<span class="headword">Butler, Sir  (Spencer) Harcourt</span>  (1869&#150;1938), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born in London on 1 August 1869, the second of the nine sons of Spencer Perceval Butler, barrister, of Lincoln's Inn, conveyancing counsel to the office of works, and his wife, Mary, only child of the Revd Nicholas Kendall of Bodmin. He was the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32211/', "Sir (George) Geoffrey Gilbert Butler")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32215/', "Sir Montagu Sherard Dawes Butler")</script>. He was educated at Harrow School, then under the headmastership of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32213/', "Henry Montagu Butler")</script> and, after passing the Indian Civil Service examination in 1888, spent his probation at Balliol College, Oxford. In October 1890 he began his Indian career in the North-Western Provinces (renamed in 1902 the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh). In 1894 he married Florence, daughter of Francis Nelson Wright of the Indian Civil Service. Butler first received particular notice as secretary in 1901 of the famine commission presided over by Sir Antony (afterwards Lord) MacDonnell. The report which he drafted was for many years the standard authority on Indian famine prevention and relief. For this work he was appointed CIE. Later honours were the CSI (1909), KCSI (1911), GCIE (1923), and GCSI (1928).<br>
<br>As deputy commissioner of Lucknow district (1906&#150;8) Butler enhanced the beauty and amenities of the capital of Oudh. At the close of 1907 the viceroy, Lord Minto, took him from this post to be secretary of the foreign department, which then had charge of both external relations and those with the Indian states. Three years later (1910) he was appointed to the viceroy's executive council in charge of the new department of education, which included within its scope public health, local self-government, archaeology, and several minor branches. In 1913 he formulated a memorable government resolution which reshaped policy towards higher education. From now on the principle of expansion through five affiliating institutions was abandoned in favour of the establishment of independent teaching and residential universities. This set the pattern for the expansion of university education in India for the rest of the century.<br>
<br>In 1915 Butler went to Rangoon as lieutenant-governor of Burma. By his development for the use of the allies of the output of wolfram concentrates from the Tavoy fields he broke the virtual monopoly which the Germans had acquired in the manufacture of tungsten, a valuable agent in the production of munitions. Butler also did much to awaken a new spirit in Burma, notably by raising a large sum by public subscription for the foundation of Rangoon University, thereby ending the inconvenient and unsatisfactory affiliation of the colleges of Burma to Calcutta University, across the Bay of Bengal.<br>
<br>Early in 1918, when his term in Burma had run only half its course, Butler went as lieutenant-governor to the United Provinces. He allayed serious agrarian unrest in Oudh by reconciling the landowning <i>talukdars</i> to a policy of tenancy reform. The Montagu&#150;Chelmsford reforms, coming into force under the 1919 <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> on 1 January 1921, initiated the system of provincial &#145;dyarchy&#146;, which gave elected Indian ministers considerable authority over fields of government &#145;transferred&#146; to them; and the heads of provinces became governors. Like Lord Willingdon in Madras, Butler encouraged joint consultations between the two halves of his government&#151;the &#145;reserved&#146;, with executive councillors, and the &#145;transferred&#146;, with ministers responsible to the legislature.<br>
<br>Butler had the unique experience of introducing the dyarchical system into two great provinces. The second of these was Burma, where the reforms took effect two years later than in peninsular India. As governor from the beginning of 1923, he nursed the area's public consciousness, but never concealed from higher authority the dangers of instability and the need for less exiguous defence measures. He took prompt steps to bring to an end slavery and human sacrifice, as practised by the Nagas in the unadministered territory bordering on the Hukawng valley, which he visited in 1925.<br>
<br>Butler left Rangoon at the end of 1927, and accepted the chairmanship of the Indian states committee, which looked into relations between the Indian princes and British power. Reporting in 1929, it reaffirmed the doctrine of &#145;paramountcy&#146;, but laid down guiding principles on its application and on equitable financial relations between British India and the states. In 1931 he accepted the chairmanship of the governing body of the School of Oriental and African Studies, London University. He joined the boards of the Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Company, the National Provincial Bank, and other concerns. His occasional writings include his concise and fascinating <span class="italic">India Insistent</span> (1931).<br>
<br>Sir Harcourt Butler died from heart disease and gout in the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, St Pancras, London, on 2 March 1938. He was survived by his wife and only son, Victor. His gifted personality was well summed up by Sir John Hewett, one of the most distinguished of his predecessors in the headship of the United Provinces:<blockquote>He had a brilliant intellect, boundless energy, and wonderful capacity for getting at the root of a matter, ability to express his conclusions so as to be clear to all, and a very practical head in carrying them out. Butler was a wonderful host. His fondness for music added greatly to the charm of his entertainments.</blockquote>Indeed, his social skills were an important factor in his successful career.<br>
