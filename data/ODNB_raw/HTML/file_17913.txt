<span class="headword">Man,  Henry</span>  (1747&#150;1799), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in the City of London. His father, a well-known builder in the City, sent him to be educated under the Revd John Lamb at a house school in Croydon. He was a quick learner and soon distinguished himself as a scholar. Family pressure and a nonconformist background meant that progressing to university was impossible, so Man left school at fifteen and became a clerk in a mercantile house in the City.<br>
<br>In 1770 Man published a small work called <span class="italic">The Trifler</span>. This volume of essays established him as a writer. In 1774 he contributed a series of letters on education to Woodfall's newspaper the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. In the following year he published a novel, <span class="italic">Bentley, or, The Rural Philosopher</span>. In 1775 he retired from business and published a dramatic satire entitled <span class="italic">Cloacina</span>. In the following year Man married. The couple had one daughter, Emma Claudiana. Shortly after his marriage Man obtained a post in the South Sea House, and within a matter of months he was elected deputy secretary there.<br>
<br>It was while Man was deputy secretary that he became acquainted with the writer Charles Lamb, who worked at South Sea House as a teenager between 1791 and 1792. Although they worked together for only a brief time, Man impressed Lamb. Praising Man in <span class="italic">The Essays of Elia</span> Lamb remarked that in him &#145;common qualities become uncommon&#146;, and that he had a genuine wit and geniality  (C. Lamb, <span class="italic">Essays of Elia</span>, 1902, 10).<br>
<br>Working at South Sea House did not interfere with Man's literary interests. He continued to write letters and essays for the <span class="italic">Morning Gazette</span> until his death on 5 December 1799. His only daughter died in Sevenoaks, Kent, on 14 August 1858.<br>
<br>Man's works were collected and published in two volumes, with a &#145;Memoir&#146;, in 1802. They consisted of essays, letters, and various other literary fragments. In <span class="italic">The Essays of Elia</span> Lamb lamented that they had been all but forgotten in so short a space of time, as was his style, &#145;terse, fresh epigrammatic, as alive&#146;. Lamb owned a set of Man's works and often read them. He was particularly fond of Man's epigram on lords Spencer and Sandwich, credited respectively with making the waistcoat a fashionable item and inventing the sandwich:<blockquote>
<div>Two noble Earls, whom if I quote,<br>
</div>
<div>Some folks might call me sinner;<br>
</div>
<div>The one invented half a coat;<br>
</div>
<div>The other half a dinner.<br>
</div>
<div>The plan was good, as some will say<br>
</div>
<div>And fitted to console one:<br>
</div>
<div>Because, in this poor starving day,<br>
</div>
<div>Few can afford a whole one.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>
