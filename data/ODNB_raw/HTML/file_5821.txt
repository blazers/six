<span class="headword">Cokayne,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1429), <span class="occ">justice</span>, is frequently confused with his nephew, Sir John Cokayne (<i>d</i>. 1438) of Ashbourne in Derbyshire. Contemporary sources distinguish the two by referring to the justice as &#145;the elder&#146; or &#145;the uncle&#146;. He was the younger son of John Cokayne (<i>d</i>. 1372), chief steward of the northern parts of the duchy of Lancaster, and Cecilia Vernon (she later married Robert Ireton). His marriage, probably in the early 1380s&#151;the marriage had produced grandchildren by 1400&#151;to Ida (<i>d</i>. 1426), daughter of Reynold, Lord Grey of Ruthin (<i>d</i>. 1388), reflected the quality of his family's connections. He must already have been well established in the legal profession when, in April 1383, the king granted him a life annuity of &pound;15. In the following decade he was appointed to his first major legal offices: by October 1394 he was serving as recorder of London&#151;an office he surrendered in 1398&#151;and in October 1396 he became a serjeant-at-law. By this time he had already followed the family tradition of service to the house of Lancaster, holding, as his father had done before him, the chief stewardship of the northern parts of the duchy (1398&#150;1400). In his will of February 1398, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, nominated Cokayne as one of his executors. Such impeccable Lancastrian connections ensured further promotion on the accession of Henry IV. In November 1400 he was appointed chief baron of the exchequer, and in May 1405 he was elevated to the bench of the common pleas. He continued to hold both offices until Henry V's accession in 1413, when he surrendered his exchequer office.<br>
<br>The profits of office and royal patronage&#151;while a justice he enjoyed the grant of several royal wardships&#151;enabled Cokayne to lay the landed foundations of a gentry family that was to endure for more than 300 years. By 1394 he had acquired lands at Bearwardcote in his native Derbyshire, and in 1398 he secured a life interest in the Hertfordshire manors of Almshoe, in Ippollitts, and Radwell. His major purchase, that of the Bedfordshire manor of Bury (now Cockayne) Hatley, was made in 1417; when he drew up his will on 10 February 1428 he expressed his wish to be buried in the parish church there (his altar tomb is now lost). His bequests looked back to the patrons who had made his worldly success possible: he endowed prayers for the souls of John of Gaunt, the first two Lancastrian kings, and, most interestingly, Richard II. He died on 22 May 1429, probably at Bury Hatley.<br>
