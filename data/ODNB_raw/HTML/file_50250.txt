<span class="headword">Bridgeman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Weld-Forester]</span>,  Selina Louisa</span>, countess of Bradford  (1819&#150;1894), <span class="occ">correspondent of Benjamin Disraeli</span>, was the seventh and youngest child of Cecil, first Baron Forester (1767&#150;1828), MP and landowner, and his wife, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lady Katherine Manners (1779&#150;1829), second daughter of the fourth duke of Rutland. On 10 April 1844 she married Orlando George Charles Bridgeman, Viscount Newport (1819&#150;1898), sporting peer and Conservative MP for South Shropshire, 1842&#150;65. Benjamin Disraeli described him in 1843 as &#145;very agreeable, a shrewd, tall, fair, unaffected, very young man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Disraeli Letters</span>, 4.1307); he succeeded his father as third earl of Bradford in 1865, living at Weston Park, Weston under Lizard, in Staffordshire. They had four children, two sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Selina Bradford was a leader of society, &#145;not cultured in the usual sense, but with much mother-wit, a <i>grande dame</i>, yet a fine lady too&#146;  (Paget, 1.127). She first met Disraeli in the 1840s. &#145;Somehow [Disraeli] is a man I cannot respect&#146;, she wrote in 1849  (Bradford, 308). Not until nearly a quarter of a century later did they become intimate. In July 1873, at a dinner party given by Lady Augusta Sturt, Selina Bradford captivated the 68-year-old Conservative leader, whose elderly wife had died a few months earlier. Disraeli was soon besotted, beginning an epistolary romance not only with Selina Bradford but also with her sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50251/', "Anne Stanhope, countess of Chesterfield")</script>. Within a few weeks &#145;Dear Lady Bradford&#146; had become &#145;Dearest Lady Bradford&#146;; such was his ardour that in September, staying at Weston, he broke the habit of a lifetime and rode to hounds (not a successful venture), and by November he was writing her passionate love letters. In 1874 when Disraeli became prime minister, he appointed Bradford master of the horse. &#145;Selina&#146;, he wrote, &#145;will ride in Royal Carriages, head the line even in an entree and gallop over all Her Majesty's lieges&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; to Lady Bradford</span>, 1.54). As prime minister, his life revolved to an astonishing extent around the need to write to Selina or the chance of seeing her; he was plunged into deepest gloom by her silences and elated by a meeting. &#145;I live for Power and the affections&#146;, he declared, and he observed somewhat wistfully that &#145;there is no greater misfortune than to have a heart that will not grow old&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters &hellip; to Lady Bradford</span>, 1.57, 73). In May 1875 he proposed to Anne Chesterfield, who was a widow and available, in order to be closer to Selina, who was neither (wisely Anne Chesterfield refused). The thousand or so letters that Disraeli wrote to Selina Bradford leave no doubt as to the depth of his affection for her, though he perhaps used letter-writing as a vehicle for the fantasy which was so necessary to his existence. Selina Bradford, however, was outwardly cold and detached. None of her letters has survived, but Disraeli complained that her cold demeanour belied her letters, and hints survive that she reciprocated his feelings. &#145;Have confidence in me, believe in me, believe that I am true&#151;oh, how true&#146;, she wrote on one occasion  (Bradford, 309), and she was evidently nervous lest her letters be seen by her family, which may explain why, unlike Disraeli's, they were destroyed. Selina Bradford died at Weston Park on 25 November 1894, after a lengthy illness. She was buried in Weston under Lizard.<br>
