<span class="headword">Jones <span class="st"> [<em>later </em> Leif-Jones]</span>,  Leifchild Stratten</span>, Baron Rhayader  (1862&#150;1939), <span class="occ">temperance advocate and politician</span>, was born at 44 Albert Street, Regent's Park, London, on 16 January 1862. The fourth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15098/', "Thomas Jones (known as Jones Treforris)")</script> of Morriston, Glamorgan (1819&#150;1882), a Congregational minister who served as president of the Congregational unions in England and Wales and in Australia, and his first wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones (<i>d</i>. 1867). Leif Jones had two older brothers who later became prominent: Sir (David) Brynmor Jones (1852&#150;1921), a barrister and Liberal MP, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34235/', "John Viriamu Jones (1856&#150;1901)")</script>, a scientist and principal of University College, Cardiff.<br>
<br>Jones began his secondary schooling at Swansea, probably at the Normal College. While his father preached in Australia during 1877&#150;80 he attended Scotch College, Melbourne, where he graduated in first place in a class of over 500 boys. He won a scholarship at Trinity College, Oxford, where he took first-class honours in mathematics in 1885. He also studied law at the Middle Temple.<br>
<br>The turning point in Jones's life was his appointment, while still at Oxford, as tutor for the children of the future ninth earl of Carlisle. He became the secretary, disciple, and ally of Rosalind Howard, later countess of Carlisle, an imperious and outspoken prohibitionist. Having taken the teetotal pledge at Naworth Castle, Lady Carlisle's Cumberland seat in 1885, he started his temperance work by speaking at local meetings. In 1894 he said: &#145;Nothing in life is more precious than the feeling of comradeship, of solidarity, of unity that comes of sharing in the onward march of some great human cause&#146;  (<span class="italic">Alliance Year Book</span>, 18). He did not regard sobriety as a panacea for all social problems, but he emphasized the reciprocal connection between drink and poverty.<br>
<br>Despite his libertarian principles, Jones belonged to the prohibitionist wing of the temperance movement. When he joined the prohibitionist United Kingdom Alliance in 1892, he was immediately appointed a member of its consultative committee. In 1895 he joined its executive committee. He worked closely with Lady Carlisle and the prohibitionists in her family circle&#151;her son Geoffrey Howard, her daughter Lady Cecilia Roberts, and her son-in-law Charles H. Roberts&#151;as well as the alliance president Sir Wilfrid Lawson, a north country neighbour, and Good Templars such as Guy Hayler and Joseph Malins.<br>
<br>At the turn of the twentieth century uncompromising prohibitionists were losing their influence in the temperance movement and with the Liberal Party and, as the alliance's president from 1906 to 1932 Jones presided over its decline. He fought proposals for public management of the retail drink trade, promoted by Joseph Rowntree and Sir Thomas Palmer Whittaker. During the First World War he discouraged David Lloyd George's tentative discussion of state purchase and nationalization of the drink trade. Committed to prohibition by local option, Jones would support other reforms only when they reduced the consumption of alcoholic drink. He testified before the royal commission on licensing (England and Wales) on 9 July 1930. In 1933 he signed the &#145;agreed&#146; temperance programme, a kind of treaty between prohibitionists and other temperance reformers that outlined points of consensus and smoothed over a row ignited by Henry Carter, a &#145;moderate&#146; who had served on the royal commission.<br>
<br>During much of his period of office as president of the United Kingdom Alliance, Jones sat as a Liberal MP, on the radical wing of the party (he was, for example, an early supporter of women's suffrage). Defeated in 1892 at Westminster, where he stood as a radical and Labour candidate on a platform of opposing privilege &#145;in every shape&#146;, he was also unsuccessful at Leeds Central in 1895 and at Manchester South in a by-election in 1900. He eventually entered the House of Commons after winning a by-election for the Appleby division of Westmorland in March 1905, and held the seat by the slender margin of five votes in the Liberal landslide of 1906. He lost it in the first general election of 1910, but in the second general election of that year was returned for Nottinghamshire Rushcliffe. He was sworn of the privy council in 1916. As a supporter of Asquith he lost his Nottinghamshire seat in the &#145;coupon&#146; election of 1918, and then stood five times for the temperance stronghold of Camborne, Cornwall: unsuccessful in 1922, he won the seat in 1923 but lost it in 1924, regaining it in 1929 and losing again in 1931. He served on the public accounts committee of the House of Commons, but held no ministerial office.<br>
<br>In January 1932, after losing his Commons seat, Jones was made a peer, on the recommendation of Philip Snowden, and took the title Baron Rhayader. Shortly before that he had adopted by deed poll the surname Leif-Jones. A strong advocate of free trade and peace, he was honorary secretary of the Cobden Club from 1927 to 1932 and its president from 1932 to 1938. He was a member of the League of Nations Union and from 1934 to 1937 he was president of the Liberal Council.<br>
<br>Athletic in his youth, Jones preferred intellectual pursuits as he aged. Although his <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary described him as &#145;genial&#146; he was slow to make friends. In the House of Commons his friends included Isaac Foot and Sir Donald Maclean. Jones read voraciously and played chess. He dined at the Reform Club with writers such as Arnold Bennett, A. G. Gardiner, and H. G. Wells. Despite being a nonconformist minister's son he seems to have been agnostic in religion. An unemotional orator, he spoke slowly, logically, and with an abundance of factual evidence, but also wittily, in his clear silvery voice. Tall, slim, and refined in appearance, he looked frail in later years. Unmarried and increasingly deaf, he was lonely in his last years. He died at his home, 16 Bryanston Street, Portman Square, London, on 26 September 1939, and was cremated at Golders Green three days later.<br>
