<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stewart,  John</span>, first earl of Traquair  (<em>c.</em>1599&#150;1659), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son of John Stewart of Traquair, Peeblesshire, and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Andrew Stewart, master of Ochiltree. His father's early death on 9 March 1606 made him heir to his grandfather, James Stewart of Traquair, whom he succeeded in May 1606. He was placed under the tutelage of his uncle Sir Robert Stewart of Schillinglaw, who supervised his properties and legal affairs, while his early education at home seems to have been entrusted to Thomas Sydserf, future bishop of Galloway. From 1608 onwards Stewart often appears in the Scottish privy council records alongside his tutor, who was frequently obliged to protect his charge against the Turnbull family of Bedrule, whose depredations and deforcements in the Stewart lands at Huntlyhill caused considerable tensions. By August 1619 the Turnbulls had been intercepted while trying to expropriate hay from Traquair property, leading Schillinglaw and Stewart to obtain a conciliar injunction against them. In September the council deployed the earls of Buccleuch and Roxburghe and Lord Cranstoun to apprehend the chief Turnbulls, thus ending a decade of litigation and possibly encouraging Stewart's own move towards a personal assumption of justiciary power within his ancestral territory as a member of the Peebles peace commission once he came of age at some date between August 1619 and 1621.<br>
<br>Stewart's impressive rise to political prominence began soon after his marriage, by a contract dated 14 September 1620, to Lady Katherine, daughter of David Carnegie, earl of Southesk, a match which brought 20,000 merks scots in tocher. In 1621 Stewart was made a member of the Scottish privy council, and in July and August he participated in the parliament as a commissioner for small barons for Tweeddale. His loyalty to James VI's policies of ecclesiastical congruity was proved by his decision to vote in favour of ratifying the five articles of Perth, and before 29 January 1622 he was knighted. He took an increasing role in parliamentary committees for the exportation of undraped wool (October 1622) and the wool commission (January 1623). His responsibilities as a local landowner in Tweeddale led him to act with fifteen other lords, lairds, and bailies to formulate a <span class="roman">Temporary Relief Act</span> for those affected by the famine of 1623. In July that year he was once again serving on a committee, this time for standing manufactures.<br>
<br>Stewart's rise as an expert in financial management temporarily gave way in 1623 to his interests in local law enforcement, and from this time onwards he served not only as a justice of the peace for Peebles (from August 1623) but as a border commissioner (from July 1624). He reached the apex of his political career only after the accession of Charles I in 1625, resuming his place on the privy council and gaining a promotion on 19 April 1628 with his elevation to the heritable lordship of Traquair. Hereafter, his fiscal acumen gained him the trust of Charles but his penchant for bullying, his high-handed attitude towards administrative red tape, and his improperly defined political loyalties alienated his fellow councillors.<br>
<br>In 1630 Traquair was appointed co-treasurer-depute with Lord Napier (becoming sole depute in 1631) under Lord Treasurer William Douglas, earl of Morton, as well as an extraordinary lord of the court of session. Traquair's loyalty to the Caroline regime was rewarded during the king's coronation in Edinburgh in June 1633, when he was elevated to the earldom of Traquair and the appurtenant lordships of Linton and Caberston. His apparent lack of personal integrity and reputation as an &#145;abrasive placeman&#146; soon gained him enemies, however, and his dislike of bishops and episcopal power generally made him an unlikely (and inconsistent) royal agent. Traquair's controversial participation, as chancellor of the jury, in casting the final vote against Lord Balmerino in his trial for seditious libel (1634) gained him immediate notoriety; despite his personal appeal to the king at Whitehall and a subsequent pardon for Balmerino, his public action merely confirmed growing national fears of the king's own vindictive and arbitrary behaviour in a trial that had appeared to be rigged. On 30 November Traquair appeared as a commissioner in the revived border commission, resurrected on account of new disorders throughout the Anglo-Scottish middle shires.<br>
<br>Traquair's expedition to London in the spring of 1636 resulted in his promotion to lord high treasurer, a position which, for a difficult five-year period, made him the most powerful politician in Scotland. Unfortunately for him, a sequence of events also pinpointed him as the man considered most responsible for attempting to impose the Laudian prayer book on the kingdom in 1637. Ironically, Traquair's personal friendship with Archbishop William Laud did not mitigate the earl's own distrust of diocesan episcopacy, and it was widely rumoured that the Edinburgh riot of 23 July was, if not engineered by him, at least encouraged as a means of discrediting the Scottish bishops. In the months that followed he urged Charles not to pursue further implementation of the new liturgy, a view perhaps strengthened by a personal attack upon him by a presbyterian mob in October. Traquair chaired the parliament at Linlithgow in November and attempted to devise placatory legislation that would suitably revise the prayer book while underlining the illegality of Edinburgh's riot against the crown.<br>
<br>For the next three years Traquair devoted much of his energy to travelling between Whitehall and Edinburgh in an increasingly unviable attempt to reconcile the king's episcopal policies with the militant presbyterianism of the Scottish &eacute;lite. On returning from London in February 1638 he was the unwilling bearer of royal instructions meant to reinforce the prayer book by proclamation, over and above the complaints of Scottish ministers and the gentry. The national covenant of 28 February soon endangered the king's policies, and Traquair quickly returned to court as a negotiator, reappearing in Scotland by July as a supporter of the lord high commissioner, the marquess of Montrose. In March 1639 Charles issued private instructions for Traquair to fortify and arm Edinburgh Castle, a task which the treasurer soon found logistically impossible to execute, obliging him to garrison Dalkeith Palace until a suitable opportunity arose to transport the weapons into Edinburgh. This chance never came, as Traquair quickly surrendered the palace and its contents to David Leslie, whose team of 1000 musketeers surrounded Dalkeith on 19 March. Traquair immediately went underground, resurfacing in York with Charles himself in April, and later returned to Scotland as lord high commissioner to the general assembly of August. This session resulted in the abolition of episcopacy in Scotland, but the treasurer seems only to have conceded this as a means of buying time, as shown by his strategic postponement of parliament (which would have ratified the assembly legislation) to June 1640.<br>
<br>Traquair's personal reputation with the covenanters having plummeted at this point, he was disqualified from serving as commissioner in the negotiations leading to the treaty of Ripon on 30 September 1640. In the ensuing year the Scottish parliament obliged Charles to remove him as lord treasurer, and his fall from grace was compounded on 16 July, when it read out a twenty-six-page charge against him, shortly followed by a general denunciation of him as one of five principal &#145;incendiaries&#146;. His diminished political status was further confirmed in 1644 by the remarkable decision of the general assembly to declare him an &#145;enemy to religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>); this condemnation was more a summation of his ecclesiastical indifference and bad faith in dealing with the covenanters than a condemnation of his rumoured Catholic leanings.<br>
<br>Despite his alignment with the crown, Traquair is rumoured to have been involved in passing information to General Alexander Leslie in his battle against Montrose at Philiphaugh in 1645, as evinced by the last-minute withdrawal of his son John Stewart, Lord Linton (<i>b</i>. in or after 1624, <i>d</i>. 1666), from the royalist encampment. In March of that year the Scottish parliament again admonished him, but with less severity this time: the earl was fined an agreed sum of 40,000 merks and expected to keep himself confined to his properties in Peebles, Selkirk, and Roxburgh. With the resumption of war in 1648 Traquair and Linton fought together at Preston in August, with the former suffering capture by the sheriff of Cheshire and ultimate long-term imprisonment in Warwick Castle. In June 1650, during his absence, the Scottish parliament declared Traquair a delinquent alongside the duke of Hamilton and earls of Seaforth, Lauderdale, and Dumfries, though he was still periodically permitted to attend to his financial affairs in person, with his wife regularly reporting on the dilapidating condition of his estates during his captivity.<br>
<br>Traquair's plight drew the attention of Oliver Cromwell himself, who in March 1652 allowed the earl to return to Scotland, where he was met by a dwindling estate income, estrangement from his son, and the litigious efforts of one of his sons-in-law, who attempted to have him tried for perjury. He was forced to sell off both Traquair House in 1656 and Linton in 1657 in order to clear his debts, but found employment under Cromwell as a commissioner for the collection of assessments in the counties of Peebles and Selkirk. The remainder of his life has been the subject of much legend. Despite his recorded death on 27 March 1659 at home, contemporary and later historians envisaged him dying between sermons at a kirk service, or alternatively, panhandling for his subsistence as &#145;the beggar Earl&#146; on the streets of Edinburgh in 1661  (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>). As one observer carefully summarized his contribution to Scottish politics, Traquair had been &#145;a man of extraordinary natural parts, and of great learning, but of too much craft&#146;  (Smith, fol. 27<i>v</i>). With his wife, who was still living on 1 November 1655, he had four daughters, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1673), who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7895/', "James Douglas, second earl of Queensberry")</script>, Elizabeth, Catherine, and Magdalene; he was succeeded as second earl by his only son, John.<br>
