<span class="headword">Fleming, Sir  David</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1406), <span class="occ">landowner and courtier</span>, was the son of Malcolm Fleming (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1390), lord of Biggar and Cumbernauld, and his wife, Christian. A middle-ranking baron, he rose to prominence in the service of David II and Robert III. His father had been a follower of David II, holding the office of sheriff of Dumbarton. David also entered royal service; he was termed &#145;our dear and faithful bachelor&#146; by David II in 1362  (Thomson, no. 175) and married Jean, daughter of the king's adherent David Barclay of Brechin. After the death of the king in 1371 the Flemings may have given their support to John Stewart, earl of Carrick. According to the <span class="italic">Liber pluscardensis</span>, Fleming was the man responsible for arresting Robert II; if that is correct, the act probably occurred in 1384 when Carrick seized power from his father. By 1400 Fleming was &#145;luvit wel&#146; by Carrick, now Robert III, and had established himself as an influential councillor of both the king and his younger brother, Robert Stewart, duke of Albany and earl of Fife (<i>d</i>. 1420).<br>
<br>Fleming's rise to a position of personal power came in 1404. The battle of Homildon Hill in 1402 had removed the major figures of southern Scotland into English captivity. Fleming himself had been captured in this clash, but he secured a quick release, and by early 1404 was employed in a major role in Anglo-Scottish diplomacy. His status in the kingdom is suggested by his place as first-named baron in the general council of April 1404. Along with his political allies, Henry Wardlaw, bishop of St Andrews (<i>d</i>. 1440), who was the guardian of the young heir to the throne, Prince James, and Henry Sinclair, earl of Orkney (<i>d</i>. 1418), Fleming sought to establish himself in the south. In 1405 they backed the rebellion in England of Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, and after its collapse Fleming aided Percy's escape from Scotland before he could be exchanged for the captive Archibald Douglas, fourth earl of Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1424). This act, combined with Fleming's ambitions in the south, antagonized the Black Douglases, while his efforts to obtain control of the office of sheriff of Roxburgh from the heirs of George Douglas, first earl of Angus (<i>d</i>. 1403), brought the hostility of the Red Douglases. In an attempt to pressurize the Red Douglases, Fleming entered Haddingtonshire with Orkney, Prince James, and an armed following in early 1406. He overestimated his strength. Orkney and the prince escaped, but Fleming was killed on 14 February on Long Hermiston Moor, Edinburghshire, after a running fight by a force of Black Douglas adherents led by James Douglas of Balvenie (<i>d</i>. 1443), Archibald Douglas's brother. Faced by major magnates, the resources of a royal favourite such as Fleming proved to be insufficient for regional power.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54187"></a><span class="headword">Sir Malcolm Fleming</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1440)<span class="occ"></span>, the son of David Fleming and his second wife, Isabel of Monycabock, also based his career on the backing of powerful patrons and suffered a similar fate to his father. Although he was worth 600 marks in 1424, he sought eminence by serving greater magnates. His marriage, before 1413, to Elizabeth, daughter of the duke of Albany, signalled his close association with the governor, and Fleming acted as his father-in-law's councillor and received of his patronage. The link with the Albany Stewarts continued into the 1420s, when Malcolm adhered to Albany's grandson Walter Stewart of Lennox. In 1424 he may have negotiated between Stewart and the newly returned king, James I, but his efforts only earned him James's mistrust. When Stewart was arrested at Edinburgh in May 1424, Fleming was also detained. Unlike Stewart, who was executed in 1425, Fleming was spared further punishment. Although in 1431 he exploited the fall of another of the king's victims, John Kennedy, to claim the lands of Lenzie, Fleming did not return to prominence until after the king's death. Again his importance was as the councillor of a great magnate, William, sixth earl of Douglas. The connection may have won both men the suspicion of James Douglas. On 24 November 1440 Earl William and Fleming were arrested in Edinburgh Castle at the so-called Black Dinner; William was executed that day, Fleming on the 25th.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54188"></a><span class="headword">Robert Fleming</span>, first Lord Fleming  (<em>d.</em> 1491)<span class="occ"></span>, the son of Malcolm and Elizabeth, acted vigorously to reverse the sentence of forfeiture passed on his father. In 1442 he was restored as part of a settlement with James Douglas, now seventh earl of Douglas, whose daughter, Janet, Robert married (in or before 1451). In the 1440s Robert adhered to his in-laws, witnessing Douglas family documents, attending court with William, eighth earl of Douglas, in 1444, and leading an attack on their enemies in 1445. Unlike his father, however, when magnate kinsmen clashed with the crown, Robert took the king's side. In June 1452 he attended the parliament which exonerated James II for his murder of Douglas earlier that year, and was created a lord of parliament. By 1454 he was master of the king's household and an occasional councillor of James II. Lord Fleming retained links of service with magnates, acting as carver to William Sinclair, earl of Orkney (<i>d</i>. 1480), himself a royal councillor. His bond with Gilbert, Lord Kennedy (<i>d</i>. 1479), and Alexander Boyd in 1466 shows him dealing with two men of similar baronial rank, who were at that time heading the principal faction in James III's minority government. Though Fleming held no comparable influence, the fall of the great magnate houses nevertheless enabled him to act as an independent player in Scottish politics. After the death of his first wife in or before 1480 he married Margaret Lindsay. He died in 1491.<br>
