<span class="headword">Wall,  William</span>  (1647&#150;1728), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Maranto Court Farm in the parish of Chevening, Kent, on 6 January 1647, the son of William Wall, and his wife, probably Mary Rich (a couple of those names had married in Chevening on 14 January 1646). He had at least one brother, Geoffrey, and a sister, Elizabeth, who were alive when he made his will in 1725. Wall graduated BA from Queen's College, Oxford, in 1667 and proceeded MA in 1670, being incorporated in the latter degree at Cambridge in 1676. After taking holy orders he became vicar of Shoreham, Kent, in December 1674, where he continued until his death.<br>
<br>Wall married Catharine (1657/8&#150;1706), daughter of Edward Davenant, at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, London, on 1 May 1677  (parish register). Their children were as follows: Catharine, baptized on 9 April 1678, who married Richard Waring and had eight sons and eight daughters; William, baptized on 9 November 1679, who became a citizen of London and was buried on 20 June 1725 at Shoreham; Richard, baptized on 2 January 1681; Elizabeth, baptized on 18 December 1681, and buried on 12 February 1683; Edward, baptized on 17 December 1682; Rebekka, baptized on 17 December 1683, and buried on 2 March 1685; and Thomas, baptized on 20 March 1685, also a citizen of London, and buried at Shoreham on 3 February 1710.<br>
<br>Wall once had the offer of a living of &pound;300 a year at Chelsfield, 3 miles from Shoreham, which he declined because his &#145;conscience would not let him take [it]&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 54/1, 1784, 435). Later, about 1708, he took the living at Milton, near Gravesend, at about one-fifth of the value, and 12 miles from Shoreham. At Milton he had the assistance of a curate, Mr Thomas.<br>
<br>Wall's major publication was <span class="italic">A History of Infant Baptism</span> (1705), followed by expanded second (1707) and third editions (1720). In it he defended the validity of infant baptism by using much material from ancient church fathers, and he explored a variety of topics related to baptism. The last chapter made a plea for not dividing the Church of England over the age of baptism: a plea made to Antipaedobaptists (Baptists) who remained separate from the established church. Because of that book he was awarded the degree of DD by the University of Oxford in 1720. John Wesley (1703&#150;1791) published some twenty pages of extracts from it under the title <span class="italic">Thoughts upon Infant-Baptism</span> (1751; reprinted 1780 and 1791). Wall's book was reprinted several times in the nineteenth century. The circumstances of Wall's history were that David Russen had written a book against Baptists, <span class="italic">Fundamentals without Foundation</span> (1703), to which, for Baptists, Joseph Stennett (1663&#150;1713) published <span class="italic">An Answer to Mr. David Russen's Book</span> (1704). Wall's book then followed; he consulted with Stennett and respected him. Wall was in turn opposed by a Baptist, John Gale, in <span class="italic">Reflections on Mr. Wall's History</span> (London, 1711); the two men held a conference in 1719. In connection with the topic of infant baptism Wall also published <span class="italic">A Conference between Two Men &hellip; about Infant-Baptism</span> (1706) and <span class="italic">A Defence of the History of Infant Baptism</span> (1720). Several small works complete his publications.<br>
<br>Catharine Wall died on 10 May 1706, aged forty-eight; William Wall died on 13 January 1728, probably at Shoreham, and was buried in the parish church there six days later.<br>
