<span class="headword">Tooke,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1744, <em>d.</em> 1820), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, was baptized at St John, Clerkenwell, on 26 January 1744, the second son of Thomas Tooke (1705&#150;1773), vintner, of that parish and his wife, Hannah, only daughter of Thomas Mann of St James's, Clerkenwell, whom he married in March 1737. The Tookes claimed descent from Le Sieur de Touque, who arrived in Britain with William the Conqueror. After a liberal classical education at John Shield's reputable Islington academy, William Tooke and his lifelong friend the future publisher John Nichols were apprenticed to William Bowyer the younger. Two years later, in 1760, Tooke was turned over to James Harrison: he became free of the Stationers' Company in May 1765. His correspondence from this period gives a unique insight into Tooke's life as a journeyman typographer and printer, his love entanglements, writing potential, and his earliest decision, in September 1767, to enter the church. During 1767 he edited and printed an impressive third edition of John Weever's <span class="italic">Antient Funeral Monuments of Great-Britain</span>. Two years later he printed <span class="italic">The Loves of Othniel and Achsah: Translated from the Chaldee</span>, described by the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> as &#145;a moral poem, in prose, in the manner of Klopstock and Gesner&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 39, 1769, 261).<br>
<br>The year 1771 marked a milestone for Tooke, then a resident of St John's Square, Clerkenwell. On 24 February he obtained letters of ordination as a deacon and priest from the bishop of London. He married Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1749), daughter of Thomas Eyton of Llangynhaval, Denbighshire, and his wife, Alice Robert. They had two sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27546/', "Thomas Tooke (1774&#150;1858)")</script>, economist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27548/', "William Tooke (1777&#150;1863)")</script>, lawyer. Tooke turned down John Duncombe's offer of the living of West Thurrock in Essex when the Russia Company elected him chaplain to the English Factory's church at Kronstadt, St Petersburg's commercial harbour, on 22 March. A year later he was admitted to a master mason's degree at the &#145;Perfect Union&#146; lodge in the Russian capital. His edition of <span class="italic">Mary Magdalene's Funeral Tears</span>, by the Jesuit poet Robert Southwell, was published in 1772.<br>
<br>In March 1774 Tooke succeeded John Glen King, his influential friend, as chaplain of the English Factory's St Petersburg church, located at the centre of the Galley, or English Quay. He held the post until 1792 and during this time became friendly with the clergy of several different denominations and with many leading writers and academics, stimulating his ambition to make their works known in Britain. In 1777 Nichols printed Tooke's translation, with additional notes, of <span class="italic">Pieces Written by Mons. Falconet and Mons. Diderot on Sculpture in General</span>, with special reference to &Eacute;tienne Falconet's sculpting of his famous equestrian statue of Peter the Great. Then, between 1780 and 1783, Nichols published the four volumes of Tooke's anonymous translation of J. G. Georgi's German work, <span class="italic">Russia, or, A Compleat Historical Account of All the Nations which Compose that Empire</span>. Extensively reviewed in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, under Nichols's editorship, it provided English readers with their first comprehensive knowledge of the subject. Furthermore, by including Tooke's translation of Pallas's dissertation on the formation of mountains, read in 1777 to the Russian Academy of Sciences, it publicized what Cuvier regarded as the cornerstone of modern geology.<br>
<br>On leave of absence from October 1783 to June 1784, Tooke travelled overland to Britain, visiting Emanuel Kant at K&ouml;nigsberg and the Berlin Academy of Sciences <i>en route</i>. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London on 5 June 1783 and signed its charter book on 21 January 1784. He was admitted to Jesus College, Cambridge, as a sizar in May 1784, and was appointed a corresponding member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland on 12 June. An informative letter from Tooke to Glen King about ancient Tartar burial sites was read on 25 March at the Society of Antiquaries of London.<br>
<br>Launching a major project on his return to Russia, Tooke contributed thirty-one letters describing fictitious journeys through central and southern Russia and the Ukraine to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (1785&#150;9 and 1794&#150;1816). He wrote as M. M. M., from his family motto, &#145;Militia mea multiplex&#146;, and adopted the persona of a pseudo-military traveller with a peripatetic lifestyle. Most of his material was drawn from travel accounts by Pallas, Georgi, Gmelin, and other historical, cultural, and ethnographic sources.<br>
<br>Tooke was a voluminous correspondent, mostly with Nichols, and his letters, both published and unpublished, provide a remarkable picture of the life of an intelligent and observant Russophile. Among unpublished writings that are discussed in his correspondence are a guide to teaching Greek in schools, via Latin (1785), and his translation in 1783 of Carl Friedrich Bahrdt's version of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> from the third Berlin edition, which Tooke presented to Dr Williams's Library (MS Mod., fol. 43) in 1816. Other letters reflect what resulted in two series of Tooke's didactic lectures, published by Benjamin White, in four volumes each, as <span class="italic">Moral and philosophical estimates of the state and faculties of man; and of the nature and source of human happiness</span> (1789) and <span class="italic">Moral and philosophical suggestions on various subjects related to human perfection and happiness</span> (1790); both were well received. Earlier Daines Barrington had relied on the accuracy of Tooke's data when quoting from his letters of 1774 and 1775 in support of his view that the north pole was navigable from the Arctic Ocean throughout the year. Tooke also supplied Richard Gough and Joseph White with scientific and scholarly material in 1784 and 1785. However, his correspondence with Sir Joseph Banks in 1785, 1786, and 1791 is the clearest evidence of his productive liaison between the Royal Society and the Imperial Academy of Sciences at St Petersburg. In his letter dated 23 September 1791 Tooke informed Banks that over the past four years he had compiled several thousand folio pages of items, not published in English, from every branch of literature. &#145;I take dry dissertations&#146;, he writes,<blockquote>and give them an easy dress and entertaining air. I compress elaborate works into a legible compass. I stew down old German professors into a potable soup, distill dull lectures into volatile essence, and extract the marrow of every critical bone. (BL, Add. MS 33982, fols. 320&#150;21)</blockquote>In December 1791 Tooke told Nichols that he wanted to leave Russia and set up a periodical along the lines of James Anderson's well-known <span class="italic">Bee, or, Literary Intelligencer</span>, a move that was made possible in 1792 by a substantial legacy from his uncle William Mann of the Middle Temple. At his departure Tooke was elected a member of the Free Economic Society of St Petersburg and, on 3 September 1792, a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences. Tooke bought a house in Great Ormond Street, where he lived from 1795 to 1820. He frequently attended meetings at the Royal Society, where he introduced many visitors, signed proposal certificates, and presented the library with nine of his works. He continued to keep Banks posted on Russia through Matthew Guthrie, his St Petersburg correspondent. He composed a memoir of Sir Hans Sloane and his collections, written in French, with English annotations, on Chinese paper from Canton (Guangzhou) made from bamboo cane. He and his son Thomas subscribed to proprietors' shares in the Russell Institution for the Promotion of Literary and Scientific Knowledge, founded in 1808 at Great Coram Street, Brunswick Square.<br>
<br>Tooke continued to make good use of the eclectic material he had accumulated from Russia. In 1795 <span class="italic">The Repertory of Arts and Manufactures</span> published his letter (reprinted in the <span class="italic">Annual Register</span> and the <span class="italic">Pocket Magazine</span>) about the fires during the 1780s on a Russian frigate and to hemp at a ropewalk plant caused by self-igniting substances. That year he also published the two volumes of his <span class="italic">Varieties of literature from foreign literary journals and original MSS.</span>, a broad selection which included Gregory Shelekov's account of his epic voyage from Okhotsk to America between 1783 and 1787. It was followed in 1798 by <span class="italic">Selections from the most celebrated foreign literary journals and other periodical publications</span>, the second volume of which contained A. L. Schloezer's pioneering dissertations on Russian history. In the same year a new edition of <span class="italic">The General Biographical Dictionary</span>, revised and enlarged in fifteen volumes, was published under Tooke's overall editorship. Between 1798 and 1801 he translated or compiled four major works about Russia. Jean-Henri Cast&eacute;ra's French biography, rendered by Tooke as <span class="italic">The Life of Catharine II, Empress of Russia: an Enlarged Translation</span> (1798), appeared in six editions; over half the text consisted of Tooke's additions. Cast&eacute;ra incorporated most of these, with his own new findings, in another edition of his biography, from which Tooke produced a fourth edition (1800), exemplifying his firmly held belief that a translator&#150;compiler becomes part owner and author of a translated work in his own right. He also supervised the translation of F. C. P. Masson's anonymous <span class="italic">M&eacute;moires secr&egrave;tes</span>, published in 1800 by Longman and Rees, as a supplement to <span class="italic">The Life of Catharine II</span>, under the title of <span class="italic">Secret Memoirs of the Court of Petersburg</span>. His next compilation, <span class="italic">View of the Russian empire during the reign of Catharine the Second, and to the close of the present century</span> (1799), was translated into French from the second edition in 1801. Much praised by contemporaries, this comprehensive work succeeded in promulgating Russia through the systematic translation and reconfiguration of source materials. Tooke followed it up in 1800 with a diligent <span class="italic">History of Russia from the foundation of the monarchy by Rurik to the accession of Catharine the Great</span>. His final major translation on a Russian theme, <span class="italic">The Picture of Petersburg: from the German of Henry Storch</span> (1801), gave the British reader a well-informed survey of contemporary Russian life, personalities, and institutions, to which Tooke added his own innovatory Russian verse translations.<br>
<br>An excellent preacher, Tooke published at his own expense the sermon he delivered on Ash Wednesday in 1808 as honorary chaplain to the Stationers' Company. In 1814 the corporation of London printed the five sermons which he preached as the lord mayor's chaplain, prompting Nichols to remark that if he could dispense ecclesiastical preferment, &#145;Mr. Tooke would not be long without at least a Prebendal Stall&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 84/2, 1814, 48). Between 1802 and 1814 he published translations of the sermons by Georg Joachim Zollikofer, the celebrated Leipzig reformed church minister, and also translated his <span class="italic">Devotional Prayers and Exercises</span> (1815). His wittily prefaced translation <span class="italic">Private History of Peregrinus Proteus the Philosopher &hellip; from the German</span> (by Christoph Martin Wieland) appeared in 1796. In 1820 Nichols printed the two quarto volumes of Tooke's translation <span class="italic">Lucian of Samosata: from the Greek. With the Comments of Wieland and Others</span>. In a long introduction Tooke clearly defined his guiding principles as a translator, enshrined in his <span class="italic">Illustrations</span> of Horace's epistles and satires, over 300 pages of which appeared in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> between September 1806 and November 1811. In what would have been a key work, he was revising these for separate publication at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Tooke died in Guilford Street, London, on 17 November 1820 following a short illness, and was buried on the 23rd in the new burial-ground adjoining the St Pancras churchyard. He was survived by his wife. Nichols was a pallbearer at his funeral.<br>
