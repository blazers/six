<span class="headword">Walker,  John</span>  (1769&#150;1833), <span class="occ">founder of the Church of God and classical scholar</span>, was born in co. Roscommon, the son of Matthew Walker, a Church of Ireland clergyman. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 18 January 1786, was chosen a scholar in 1788, graduated BA in 1790, was elected a fellow in 1791, and proceeded MA in 1796, and BD in 1800.<br>
<br>Walker was ordained a Church of Ireland priest and served as a chaplain in Bethesda Chapel, Dublin, from 1793; he composed a moderately well-known hymn, &#145;Thou God of power and God of love&#146;, in honour of the chapel's move to Dorset Street, Dublin, on 22 June 1794. From about 1803 he began to study the principles of Christian fellowship prevailing among the earliest Christians. Convinced that later departures were erroneous, he joined with a small band of followers who attempted to live what they believed to be the practice of the apostles, rejecting all church authority and discipline and calling themselves members of the Church of God. His views from this period can be found in his <span class="italic">Expostulatory Address to Members of the Methodist Society in Ireland</span> (1804) and his <span class="italic">Letters to Alexander Knox</span> (1803).<br>
<br>On 8 October 1804 Walker became convinced that he could no longer honestly hold the position of a clergyman of the Church of Ireland. Informing the provost of Trinity College of his theological position, he offered to resign his fellowship, but was formally expelled on the following day. He joined a congregation of fellow believers at their meeting-place for worship in Stafford Street, Dublin, and supported himself by lecturing on subjects of university study, completing his edition of Livy's <span class="italic">Historiarum libri qui supersunt</span> (1797&#150;1813) and publishing <span class="italic">The First, Second and Sixth Books of Euclid's Elements</span> (1808) and <span class="italic">Selections from Lucian</span> (1816). After paying several visits to Scotland, he moved to London in 1819, where he wrote <span class="italic">A Full and Plain Account of the Horatian Metres</span> (1822). It was probably while in London that he married and that his daughter Mary was born.<br>
<br>In 1833, after Trinity College, Dublin, had granted Walker a pension of &pound;600 in amends for their earlier treatment of him, he returned to Dublin where he died on 25 October. His theological work, <span class="italic">The Sabbath: a Type of the Lord Jesus Christ</span> (1866), was published posthumously, and his <span class="italic">Essays and Correspondence</span> (1838), edited by W. Burton, went to press five years after his death. His followers were known by the pejorative terms Separatists or Walkerites.<br>
