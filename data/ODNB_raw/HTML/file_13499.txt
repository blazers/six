<span class="headword">Holdsworth,  Richard</span>  (1590&#150;1649), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and college head</span>, was baptized in the parish of St Nicholas, Newcastle upon Tyne, in the year of his birth in that town, the youngest son of Richard Holdsworth (<i>d</i>. 1596), the vicar there, and his wife, whose maiden name was Pearson. After his father's death he was brought up by an uncle, William Pearson, who was a curate and lecturer in the town. Holdsworth may be assumed to have imbibed from this Newcastle background the moderate Calvinism often equated with puritanism&#151;but somewhat misleadingly, since it was the dominant tendency in the Jacobean church of his youth. From grammar school he proceeded to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted scholar on 2 November 1607. He graduated BA in 1610, was elected fellow on 20 March 1613, and was ordained deacon and priest at Peterborough in 1617. He was incorporated MA at Oxford in 1617 and in 1620 was appointed one of the university preachers. He became chaplain to Sir Henry Hobart, who presented him to a benefice in Yorkshire which he at once exchanged for the London rectory of St Peter-le-Poer in Broad Street, his home base from 1624 and for the remainder of his life, which was spent split between London and Cambridge. In 1629 he became professor of divinity at Gresham College. He took his BD in 1622 and his doctorate in 1637.<br>
<br>Holdsworth gained a golden reputation as both tutor and preacher. The lawyer and parliamentarian Simonds D'Ewes left a number of snapshots of his &#145;loving tutor&#146; as he led him through the standard texts in logic, ethics, and moral philosophy, and, for light relief, some history and Virgil's <span class="roman">Eclogues</span>. He remembers Holdsworth returning late from London and rousing the seventeen-year-old from his bed to share in a conversation which went on half the night with friends who, for their &#145;late watchings&#146;, were called &#145;noctuae Londinenses&#146;. As tutors did, Holdsworth accompanied his pupil to his Suffolk home, where he preached for D'Ewes's father &#145;so sweetly and profitably&#146; that Simonds &#145;began to love him better than ever&#146;, and almost forgot to mention the young man's debts of &pound;13. A Suffolk contemporary of D'Ewes who in politics was his opposite, the future Archbishop William Sancroft, wrote that at Emmanuel College (where he was master from 1637) Holdsworth was his &#145;card and compass&#146;, and that only his directions &#145;for study, for life, for all&#146; had made Sancroft a scholar. These &#145;Directions for students in the university&#146;, while preserved at Emmanuel, doubtless record Holdsworth's practice at St John's. His curriculum was enlightened and perhaps novel, substituting for the year-by-year progression through grammar, logic, and rhetoric of the Elizabethan university statutes a varied day of studies, commencing with a morning of logic and philosophy and continuing with a more relaxed afternoon of poetry, classical oratory, and history, the fruits of which were to be stored in a commonplace book, full of &#145;choice and witty sayings, sentences and passages&#146;. A gentler course was prescribed for gentlemen who had no need to make themselves scholars, readings mostly in English to provide &#145;such learning as may serve to delight and ornament&#146;. This remarkable pedagogue amassed one of the largest private libraries of his time, estimated to contain more than 10,000 volumes by the time of his death.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Holdsworth had become one of the most famous London preachers of the day. According to Thomas Fuller he &#145;dominated&#146; the pulpit, a position marked by his presidency of the London clergy guild, Sion College (1639). D'Ewes says that his sermons were &#145;by general approbation deemed extraordinary&#146; but, with a single exception, they were not published in a form which Holdsworth had himself authorized. The posthumous collection <span class="italic">The Valley of Vision</span> (1651) derived from inferior shorthand notes and appeared with a request that the reader make &#145;charitable allowances in things of this nature&#146;. No such allowances were made, Fuller condemning the publication as &#145;none of his&#146;, with &#145;little vision therein&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 448). But Holdsworth's cousin Richard Pearson (grandson of William) was able to locate in Cambridge manuscript copies of the Latin sermons preached at Gresham College in the early 1630s, which he published in 1661 as <span class="italic">Praelectiones theologicae</span>, a folio volume of 737 pages. Six English sermons dating from 1634 and 1635 are also preserved  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 331).<br>
<br>In 1633 the mastership of St John's fell vacant and while the vice-master, Robert Lane, received the support of the senior fellows and obtained a royal letter of recommendation, Holdsworth was elected by a clear majority of the governing body, presenting the vice-chancellor of the day with an embarrassing impasse. When a royal commission of the heads of other houses succeeded only in digging up a good deal of irregularity and some dirt (Lane was accused of &#145;singing drunken catches&#146;) Charles I took the matter into his own hands and appointed by mandate the Arminian high-churchman William Beale. This <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> lasted for months and soon even Archbishop Laud was weary of it. Holdsworth bore no resentment and presented the college with some books, before collecting his compensation prize, the archdeaconry of Huntingdon. The fact that on 26 April 1637 he was freely and without fuss elected master of Emmanuel, where earlier vacancies had seen cloak-and-dagger manoeuvres designed to protect the &#145;pure&#146; traditions of the college, may or may not indicate a bad conscience in high circles for his treatment at St John's. Holdsworth may well have been the best and most popular master of Emmanuel in its history, receiving the full approbation of the foundation master, Laurence Chaderton, who lived on in the vicinity of the college into his hundredth year and beyond. In spite of other commitments, especially in London, his record of residence, which can be checked against a remarkable register of &#145;admonitions&#146; for offences against the college statutes, was good.<br>
<br>By now, however, Holdsworth's more public life was entering stormy waters. He was a natural fence-sitter, from the most honourable of motives. When in 1637 Sylvester Adams of Peterhouse preached a sermon asserting the necessity of auricular confession, the heads of houses were divided, with five Arminian heads refusing to endorse the condemnatory sentence passed by the vice-chancellor, Ralph Brownrigg. Holdsworth believed that a recantation was necessary, but characteristically recommended &#145;that a longer time be given to Mr Adams to deliberate of it&#146;. His misfortunes in England's gathering troubles he was to share with other moderate Calvinists, including the Emmanuel men Samuel Ward, master of Sidney Sussex College, Joseph Hall, bishop of Exeter, who recorded the &#145;hard measure&#146; he received, and his particular friend and Hall's successor at Exeter, Brownrigg.<br>
<br>As a man of what had been the centre, Holdsworth was now raked by the vicious crossfire of an increasingly polarized political and ecclesiastical scene. Fuller wrote that when the times turned &#145;he, standing still, was left to the censure of factious innovators&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 447). No enemy of Laud, Holdsworth could write: &#145;His Grace Delights in Gentleness&#146;. As archdeacon of Huntingdon, he was stricter than his diocesan, Laud's enemy John Williams, in insisting on the placing of the holy table altarwise and on reception of communion at the altar rails, and he was pleased to have achieved compliance in this respect at St Ives. But he confessed to &#145;weakness&#146; when it came to dealing with scrupulous consciences. In his London parish he refused to read the <span class="roman">Book of Sports</span>. He was a natural choice to preach one of the fast sermons before the Short Parliament in 1640, and he opposed the continuation of convocation after the dissolution of that parliament, and the new canons which it legislated, especially the seventh, which enforced what he called &#145;these new taken up ceremonies&#146;. By the early months of 1641 Holdsworth had joined with Archbishop James Ussher and Brownrigg in propounding a scheme for so-called &#145;reduced&#146; episcopacy. Charles I made him a royal chaplain and he was one of five anti-Arminian moderates, including Brownrigg, to be offered a mitre. Holdsworth was the only one to refuse, whether, according to Fuller, because he thought the appointment in the circumstances &#145;unsafe and unseasonable&#146;, or, as both Fuller and Holdsworth's nephew Pearson report, because the &#145;smallness&#146; of the see in question, Bristol, would not allow him to maintain appropriate hospitality  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 448).<br>
<br>The logic of the polarizing situation would now drive Holdsworth towards royalism, but for a time the Long Parliament did not know what to make of him. In December 1640 he was summoned to appear before it, it was thought because of his position on altar rails, but in May 1642 he was appointed to the Westminster assembly of divines, although in the previous October Oliver Cromwell, MP for Cambridge, had opposed the appointment of the five new bishops, and had spoken &#145;somewhat bitterly&#146; against Holdsworth in particular, provoking Simonds D'Ewes to come to his old tutor's defence. According to D'Ewes himself, this business was debated &#145;with as great earnestness almost as I ever saw in the House&#146;. Cromwell's hostility was perhaps provoked by Holdsworth's actions in contributing from his college, but really, it seems, from his own pocket, &pound;100 towards the royal war chest.<br>
<br>As vice-chancellor (from 1640 to 1643) and head of his house, Holdsworth had already risked the ire of parliament in defending the interests of both university and college, particularly in his oration at the commencement in 1641. Now he could no longer avoid taking sides. In late March 1642 Charles I paid his last visit to Cambridge and Holdsworth preached before him in the university church. The sermon complained that the royal influence had been &#145;intercepted&#146;, and made much of &#145;manifold yieldings and recessions&#146; on the part of the king, &#145;who knows how to recede from power, and in some cases, even from prerogative&#146;, the care of his people's happiness being &#145;radiant in our gracious Sovereign&#146;. Charles having ordered the sermon to be published by the university printer, Holdsworth offered it as &#145;some little portion of that great happiness which this eighteen years we have enjoyed, under your blessed government&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Sermon Preached &hellip; the 27 of March</span>, 1642).<br>
<br>Holdsworth was now marked as &#145;delinquent&#146;. In August 1642 the university published a pamphlet which called the resistance offered to the king by parliament &#145;unwarrantable&#146;, &#145;damnable&#146;, &#145;murder&#146;. Holdsworth had to explain himself before the House of Commons, although he remained at liberty until May 1643, when he was arrested and imprisoned at Ely House, where he continued to live, and to preach, dangerously, and to license the republication of royal declarations. A parliamentary committee now wanted to know how he had become master of Emmanuel and wondered &#145;whether, by his demeanour since, he hath not forfeited the said place&#146;. When the university provocatively elected Holdsworth Lady Margaret professor of divinity in succession to Samuel Ward, who had himself died in custody, Holdsworth was removed to the Tower, but not perhaps for long. In April 1646 he was at Carshalton in Surrey. There were rumours of a plot to enable Holdsworth to take up the Lady Margaret chair, which remained vacant, but he never returned to Cambridge, or only on fleeting visits. In 1647 he was in the king's presence at Hampton Court, and received the now empty honour of the deanery of Worcester. In September 1648 he made further unsuccessful attempts to attend the king, now weeks away from trial and execution. &#145;So here is their circle: first we are imprisoned because with the king, and then denied to be with the king because imprisoned.&#146;<br>
<br>The earl of Manchester's visitation of the university had ejected Holdsworth from his master's lodge and had intruded as his successor Anthony Tuckney, but Tuckney was in no hurry to take possession, and in Emmanuel many regarded Holdsworth as, morally, still master. Sancroft, who had written &#145;I had not thought they would have beheaded whole colleges at a blow&#146;, was a constant correspondent, and looked for the time when Holdsworth would come back &#145;as the soul and life of this body, which hath been in a fainting and swooning condition ever since he was by violent hands snatched from us&#146;. Holdsworth continued to feed Sancroft with prize gentry pupils (&#145;you may please to take notice that he is a baronet&#146;), hoped that Sancroft would be civil to Tuckney as man to man, if not as master, and was courtesy itself in all his dealings with Tuckney.<br>
<br>Holdsworth died, unmarried, on 22 August 1649 at his home in Broad Street, London, and was buried at St Peter-le-Poer. His final legacy to Cambridge was princely, but problematical: his huge library. It was gifted under the terms of a most unsatisfactory will, and come the Restoration, Emmanuel and the university were at legal loggerheads over the matter. Eventually the court of arches referred the dispute to the arbitration of three bishops, who found for the university, with some financial compensation for the college. Holdsworth's 10,000 books remained in the Cambridge University Library, but not, as the bishops' judgement required, &#145;distinguished from other books there by the name of Dr Holdsworth's library&#146;.<br>
