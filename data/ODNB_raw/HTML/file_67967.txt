<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Matteis,  Nicola</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>1670&#150;<em>c.</em>1698), <span class="occ">violinist and composer</span>, came from Naples; nothing else is known about his origins. His contemporary Roger North related that &#145;his circumstances were low, and it was say'd that he travelled thro' Germany on foot with his violin under a full coat at his back&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 32536). Matteis arrived in England <i>c</i>.1670. The earliest account of his playing comes from John Evelyn, who first heard him at a private music meeting in November 1674. Evelyn's reaction (recorded in his diary) was to be echoed by many others:<blockquote>I heard that stupendious Violin Signor <i>Nicholao</i> (with other rare Musitians) whom certainly never mortal man Exceeded on that Instrument: he had a stroak so sweete, &amp; made it speake like the Voice of a man; &amp; when he pleased, like a Consort of severall Instruments: he did wonders upon a Note: was an excellent Composer also &hellip; nothing approch'd the <i>Violin</i> in <i>Nicholas</i> hand: he seem'd to be <i>spiritato'd</i> &amp; plaied such ravishing things on a ground as astonish'd us all.</blockquote>Matteis was supported (and persuaded out of what were considered arrogant Italian manners) by Roger L'Estrange, William Waldegrave, and William Bridgeman, all of whom had strong interests in music and were sympathetic to Roman Catholics.<br>
<br>In 1676 Matteis published his <span class="italic">Arie diverse per il violino</span>, a collection of 120 pieces for solo violin and continuo bass. A second edition with an English title-page together with a second part containing a further seventy pieces (<span class="italic">Other Ayrs</span>) appeared about two years later. These publications were important for various reasons, not least the fact that they helped establish in Britain the technology of engraving music (which had been little utilized since one landmark publication in 1613). Like all Matteis's subsequent publications, they seem to have been produced with pupils in mind. An advertisement in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> announcing the 1676 publication indicated his willingness to teach &#145;such as desire to learn Composition, or to Play upon the Violin&#146; and mentioned the availability in manuscript of second treble and tenor (viola) parts.<br>
<br>In November 1678 Matteis applied to go to France (perhaps because London seemed unsafe for Catholics while hysteria about the Popish Plot was at its height). He was, however, back in England within a year (Evelyn heard him play again in November 1679). About this time he published an important treatise on thoroughbass realization for the five-course guitar, an instrument on which he was also (according to North) a &#145;consummate master&#146;. This treatise (<span class="italic">Le false consonanse della musica</span>) appeared in an expanded English-language edition (<span class="italic">The False Consonances of Music</span>) in 1682. Three years later he published the third and fourth parts of the <span class="italic">Ayres for the Violin</span>, and as before this was followed by an expanded second edition (1687). Three features stand out in the edition of 1687. First, it includes a concerto for three trumpets with strings and/or recorders partly based on a violin piece in the <span class="italic">Ayres</span> of 1685. Second, Matteis's pedagogical interests are again to the fore: the table of contents is categorized according to difficulty, and pieces requiring the violinist to use multiple stops (that is, to play on more than one string at a time) have lower parts indicated with a dotted-outline notation enabling less skilled violinists to omit them. Third, Matteis published a companion volume, <span class="italic">The Second Treble of the Third and Fourth Parts</span>, thus turning what were essentially solo violin pieces into trio sonatas.<br>
<br>Matteis appears to have married in or before about 1678, and had a son, Nicola, whom, according to North, he had &#145;taught upon the violin from his cradle&#146;. By the early 1690s the younger Nicola was coming to prominence as a performer. His age is uncertain: his will of 1737 (in Vienna) suggests that he was born <i>c</i>.1677, while a marriage licence issued in 1692 describes him as &#145;ab<sup>t</sup> 25&#146; at that time. This, as Simon Jones has pointed out, makes it difficult to know whether references to Nicola Matteis after <i>c</i>.1695 denote father or son.<br>
<br>A Matteis was listed in 1695 (together with Henry Purcell) as a teacher for a planned royal academy. Two volumes of <span class="italic">A Collection of New Songs</span> appeared under the same name, the first (1696) &#145;made purposely for the use of his Scholers&#146; and the second (1699) &#145;being all teaching Songs, made for his Scholars&#146;. Nicola Matteis is named in advertisements in the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> (and on a broadsheet copy of the poem) as the composer of the now lost St Cecilia's day ode &#145;Assist, assist! You mighty sons of art&#146; of 1696. This ode was first performed on 23 November &#145;being the sequel of St. Cecilia's day&#146; and was repeated a few days later at a St Cecilia's day celebration in Oxford (for which Matteis was named as a steward) and again at a public concert in the York Buildings in January 1697. In May 1698 the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> reported another concert in the York Buildings featuring &#145;Mr Nicholas's Consort of Vocal and Instrumental Musick&#146;. It is possible that all of these refer to the younger Nicola Matteis.<br>
<br>Roger North claimed that Matteis lived with a woman &#145;as one that was marryed&#146; and that they had a child and moved to a great house where the violinist dissipated his by-now considerable wealth and undermined his health in extravagant living. It has been assumed that North was alluding to a marriage in 1700 to Susanna Timperley (<i>fl</i>. 1685&#150;1715). But the younger Matteis's will proves that it was he who had married this widow. The confusion may have arisen very early, since the <span class="italic">London Post</span> reported in January 1700 that &#145;Signor Nicolao, the famous Italian Musician, is married to one Madam Timperley &hellip;&#146;. (Despite the younger Matteis's growing reputation, it seems unlikely that he would be described then as a famous Italian musician.) The elder Matteis may well have been dead by this time. He features as one of the imagined writers in the third edition of Thomas Brown's <span class="italic">Letters from the Dead to the Living</span> (1707).<br>
<br>Matteis's works were still very much in demand. Roger published five books of <span class="italic">Les solos de Nicolas Mathys</span> in 1702, and in the following year Walsh brought out a new edition of the first two parts of the <span class="italic">Arie</span> together with second treble parts (presumably those mentioned in the advertisement for the original publication of 1676) to complement those published earlier for volumes 3 and 4.<br>
<br>Matteis made an extraordinary contribution to violin playing in England. He was technically innovative and set new standards of virtuosity and expressiveness performing his own music, which in North's words in <span class="italic">The Musicall Grammarian</span> &#145;shewed him a very exquisite harmonist, and of a boundless fancy, and invention&#146;.<br>
