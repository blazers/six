<span class="headword">Peddie,  James Mortimer <span class="st"> [Jim]</span></span>, Baron Peddie  (1905&#150;1978), <span class="occ">co-operative movement activist and politician</span>, was born on 4 April 1905 in Hull, one of the six sons of Crofton Peddie, a colour-works labourer, and his wife, Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whisker. He was educated at St Paul's Church of England School and Hull Municipal College, and then studied at the London School of Economics, where he took day and evening classes on the general course in 1927&#150;8, supporting himself by part-time night work. He returned to Hull to work as a lecturer in economics at Hull Technical College and then as a lecturer in economics and industrial administration at Hull College of Commerce until late 1939. In Hull Peddie was active in both the trading and the political sides of the local co-operative movement. In 1931 he married Hilda Mary Alice, daughter of J. E. Bull, a fish merchant; they had two daughters and a son, Ian James Crofton (<i>b</i>. 1945). Between 1940 and 1945 Peddie worked for the ministries of Food and Information and was appointed MBE in 1944.<br>
<br>Jim Peddie was a major co-op business figure between 1945 and 1965. He was a director of the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) Ltd from 1945, and vice-chairman of its board from 1961 to 1965. For the same period he was a director of the Co-operative Permanent Building Society and also of the Co-operative Insurance Society, of which he was vice-chairman of the board. Writing in the <span class="italic">Co-operative News</span> on 19 April 1978, William Richardson, a lifelong friend and leading co-operator, recalled that Peddie &#145;never hesitated to initiate or take up a challenge. On the CWS board he was fertile of ideas and at times impatient that the federation was not making a great impact on the nation and the co-operative movement&#146;.<br>
<br>Peddie's career as a co-operative businessman was closely linked with his involvement in co-operative and wider politics. He was the first person from the business side of the movement to become chairman of the Co-operative Party, a post he held from 1957 to 1965, a high point in its history. He firmly ensured that the Co-op movement's interests were safeguarded when the Labour Party sought in 1957 to limit the number of candidates sponsored by the Co-op. He was president of the Co-operative Union in 1958 when he chaired both the May annual congress and a special November congress to consider the report, largely written by Anthony Crosland, produced by the independent commission of inquiry into the effectiveness of co-operative production and marketing chaired by Hugh Gaitskell. Although Peddie spoke up vigorously for &#145;efficiency and progressive management&#146;, little was done.<br>
<br>During his years as chairman of the Co-operative Party, Peddie became a national figure and spoke at major labour movement meetings. He strongly supported Gaitskell's leadership of the Labour Party. While the Co-operative Party conferences supported unilateral disarmament Peddie bluntly told political audiences that he was &#145;a supporter of multilateral disarmament and could not support the unilateralist point of view&#146;. He was created a life peer in 1961. After Gaitskell's death in 1963, Peddie became known as a supporter of George Brown&#151;so much so that when Brown, as minister of economic affairs, set up the National Prices and Incomes Board in 1965, Peddie became one of its full-time members, resigning from his co-operative business positions as well as the chair of the Co-operative Party. He succeeded Aubrey Jones as its chairman in October 1970 until its abolition on 31 March 1971. Under his chairmanship the board completed work on ten cases, including low pay, the prices, profits, and costs of food distribution, London Transport's fares, and solicitors' remuneration. He led joint parliamentary delegations to Sweden (1965) and Finland (1968) and in 1974 served on the Council of Europe.<br>
<br>Peddie had a reputation for being a tough negotiator and a very blunt Yorkshireman. A historian of the Co-operative Party wrote, &#145;Peddie is a character about whom few can be neutral&#151;one either admires him considerably or dislikes him intensely&#146;  (Carbery, 53). Richardson, in his obituary in the <span class="italic">Co-operative News</span>, observed that he had been &#145;a bonny fighter for policies and principles that he believed in and he fought to win&#146;. Peddie died on 13 April 1978 from bronchopneumonia and cancer at Epsom and Ewell Cottage Hospital. He was survived by his wife, son, and one daughter. Roy Hattersley, then secretary of state for prices and consumer protection, gave the address at his memorial service on 24 May 1978.<br>
