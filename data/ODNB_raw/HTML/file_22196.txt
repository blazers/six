<span class="headword">Phylip,  Si&ocirc;n</span>  (<em>c.</em>1540&#150;1620), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet</span>, was the son of a Phylip and a Catrin. He had three brothers and four sisters. One of these brothers, <a href="#cosubject_68899">Rhisiart Phylip [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was also a poet. Si&ocirc;n was born in Mochras and lived there. Mochras is situated a few miles from Harlech in north Wales.<br>
<br>In a <i>cywydd ymryson</i> (poem of contention) between him and his brother Richard about recognition as the poet of the house and family of Nannau, near Dolgellau, Phylip says of Huw Nannau that he was &#145;cyd ysgol &hellip; ag ef&#146; (&#145;in school at the same time as him&#146;; Cardiff Free Library, MS 66, 119 ff). In his MA dissertation W. L. Davies suggests  (p. 31) that this means that Phylip was taught by the same <i>pencerdd</i> (master poet) as Huw Nannau, that is, by Wiliam Ll&#375;n. This may well be true, but the fact that Phylip was a &#145;master of three languages&#146;&#151;Welsh, English, and Latin&#151;which is mentioned by elegists may indicate that he had been tutored somewhere. Edmwnd Prys's elegy mentions that Phylip had two bardic instructors, Gruffudd Hiraethog and Wiliam Ll&#375;n. In his own elegy to Wiliam Ll&#375;n, Si&ocirc;n says that Ll&#375;n gave him &#145;true instruction&#146;  (Oxford, Jesus College, MS 101, 44). He graduated as a poet in the second Caerwys eisteddfod of 1567. In turn he was bardic instructor to his brother Rhisiart and to his own sons Gruffydd and Phylip Si&ocirc;n. In his elegy to him, Richard Cynwal also calls Phylip &#145;our teacher&#146;  (NL Wales, Peniarth MS 124, 261b). It may be that it was Phylip's role as teacher that led him to compose a bardic grammar. In his elegy to Phylip, the Welsh prose writer and poet Rowland Vaughan of Caer-gai mentions that he could take to his bed, stay there for a while, and get up having composed a <i>cywydd</i>&#151;usually of about forty to fifty lines in full <i>cynghanedd</i> and rhyme  (ibid., 265a&#150;6). This is one of the rare glimpses of the way that the Welsh poets of the gentry composed poems.<br>
<br>Phylip composed about 200 poems and many <i>englynion</i> (four-line stanzas), many of them to families in north Wales, and especially to the families of Nannau and Corsygedol in Merioneth (there are references to his spending Christmases in Corsygedol), and Gwydir in Caernarvonshire. He took part in bardic controversies with his brother Rhisiart, with his uncle Si&ocirc;n Dafydd Siencyn, with Edmwnd Prys, Tomos Prys of Plas Iolyn, and Si&ocirc;n Tudur. In his elegy to him Edmwnd Prys refers to Phylip as a judge in bardic controversies. He composed poems entitled &#145;To Wine&#146;, &#145;To Queen Elizabeth&#146;, &#145;The Phoenix&#146;, and &#145;The Gull&#146;&#151;the last two seem to be his most popular poems, if popularity is to be judged by the number of times they were transcribed by copyists. He also composed a number of religious poems, among which are versifications of biblical texts. He was also recognized as a <i>cronigliwr ag achwr gwych</i> (&#145;a splendid chronicler and genealogist&#146;), to quote Richard Cynwal  (NL Wales, Peniarth MS 124, 260b). In fact many of Phylip's poems addressed to noble families contain long lists of pedigrees and family connections and are little more than versifications of such matters. He did not compose free-metre poems, and so did not follow the example of many of his contemporaries in the seventeenth century. Several elegies were composed on Phylip's death. In them 1620 is given as the year of his death, and his age when he died is recorded as eighty. In his elegy Edmwnd Prys, archdeacon of Merioneth, says that Si&ocirc;n, who was &#145;like a candle&#146;, died &#145;ar w&#375;l Fair&#146;  (ibid., 260a), which probably means at Candlemas, 2 February. However, it should be said that the date of his death has also been noted as 13 February 1620, and his age at the time seventy-seven  (NL Wales, MS 6499, 28). The circumstance of his death is remarkable enough to be mentioned. In his elegy Evan Lloyd describes Si&ocirc;n's last bardic circuit (<i>taith glera</i>) when he visited patrons in north Wales who would pay for poems he composed to them and for records of their pedigrees that he drew up  (NL Wales, Peniarth MS 124, 2626). Lloyd says that he went over &#145;Gest&#146;, a hill near the present Porthmadog, and on to the vicinity of the Menai Strait. From there he went to Anglesey. Thence he made his way back through the Ll&#375;n peninsula as far as Pwllheli. There he was drowned&#151;&#145;y dwned aeth dan y d&#373;r&#146; (&#145;the grammar [poet] went under the water&#146;; elegy by Gruffydd Hafren, ibid., 263b). His body was rowed over the sea to Llandanwg, near his home, where he was buried in the church. A wife and six children survived him. Two of the children, <a href="#cosubject_68900">Gruffydd Phylip [<i>see below</i>]</a> and <a href="#cosubject_68901">Phylip John (or Si&ocirc;n) Phylip [<i>see below</i>]</a>, were poets. Gruffydd Phylip composed an <i>englyn</i> to the four who rowed his father's body from Pwllheli:<blockquote>
<div>O fwyn ddynion bob yn ddau&#151;cyfarwydd<br>
</div>
<div>Cyd fwriwch [cyfeiriwch] y rhwyfau<br>
</div>
<div>Tynnwch ar draws y tonnau<br>
</div>
<div>Y Bardd trist yn y gist gau.<br>
</div>(Ah, gentle men, two by two,&#151;skilful men, pull the sad poet in the hollow coffin across the waves. NL Wales, MS 6499, 28)</blockquote>
<a name="cosubject_68899"></a><span class="headword">Rhisiart Phylip</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1641), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet</span>, was a younger brother of Si&ocirc;n Phylip. He was born in Mochras, near Harlech, but at some stage moved to Llanuwchllyn, near Bala in Merioneth. It was there that he died, in a place called Y Prys. He was buried in Llanuwchllyn. In an elegy to him William Phylip calls him his &#145;uncle and good teacher&#146;  (NL Wales, Wynnstay MS 6, 46). He also refers to him as <i>bardd Nannau</i>, because he was more closely associated with that house and family than with any other: he composed at least seven poems to that family. It is likely that he also had a close relationship with the Lloyd family of Rhiwedog in Merioneth: at least he was involved in a light-hearted bardic controversy (<i>pur gellwair</i>)  (NL Wales, Cwrtmawr MS 11, 181) about the family with Richard Cynwal. Just over a hundred of his strict-metre poems survive, and many <i>englynion</i>. Most were composed to north Wales families, although one poem is an elegy to Dafydd Llwyd ab Ifan from Aber-mad in Cardiganshire, who died in 1631. Among his most remarkable poems are his elegies to Catrin of Berain and Queen Elizabeth, and his love poem to a girl from Tywyn in Merioneth. He was one of several poets who composed an elegy to the eminent scholar Dr John Davies of Mallwyd. He also composed an elegy to Edmwnd Prys.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_68900"></a><span class="headword">Gruffydd Phylip</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1666), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet</span>, was the son of Si&ocirc;n Phylip. He composed over sixty strict-metre poems, <i>englynion</i>, and a handful of free-metre poems. He composed mainly to families in Merioneth and Caernarvonshire, and was most closely associated with the Vaughan family of Corsygedol, to whom he composed at least seventeen poems. It is noteworthy that he composed <i>englynion</i> that were prefixed to Rowland Vaughan's translation of Lewis Bayly's <span class="italic">The Practice of Piety</span> (<span class="italic">Yr ymarfer o dduwioldeb</span>, 1630) and Elis Lewis's translation of an English version of Drexelius's meditations on eternity (<span class="italic">Ystyriaethau Drexelius ar dragwyddoldeb</span>, 1661). These <i>englynion</i> suggest a very different character from the one portrayed in a poem William Phylip addressed to him. There he is presented as a loudmouth, <i>dwndrio bawb dan daro'r bwrdd</i> (&#145;railing against all and banging the table&#146;; NL Wales, Swansea MS 3, 94), and as a belligerent wencher&#151;though he was, at sixty, so William Phylip suggests, past it. Such a poem is typical of the mock-satirical banter of the poets among themselves. Among his more interesting poems are his elegy to his father, <i>englynion</i> on the overthrow of Harlech Castle by the parliamentarians, two poems addressed to Dr John Davies of Mallwyd, a <i>cywydd</i> addressed to Humphrey Davies of Llandyfrydog in Anglesey on behalf of Richard Vaughan of Corsygedol asking for copies of a hundred poems by Dafydd ap Gwilym, and a free-metre poem on the poet's longing for Ystumllyn. In an <i>englyn</i> he describes himself as the last of the Welsh professional poets, and he was also so regarded by some of his contemporaries.<br>

<a name="cosubject_68901"></a><span class="headword">Phylip Si&ocirc;n Phylip</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1676<span class="mult">x</span>8), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet</span>, was the son of Si&ocirc;n Phylip. His will, dated 9 September 1676 and proved 5 July 1678  (NL Wales), shows that he lived in the parish of Llandanwg, Merioneth. He was probably a farmer, who composed occasional poems in the traditional manner. Not many of his poems survive&#151;though more have come to light than when W. Ll. Davies was writing about him in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of Welsh Biography</span> (1953). Most are poems addressed to Merioneth and Caernarvonshire families. His two most interesting poems are his elegy to William Phylip and his <i>cywydd</i> to Gruffydd Vaughan of Corsygedol to welcome him home&#151;&#145;from school&#146; according to a manuscript title  (NL Wales, Peniarth MS 239, 154), though the poem itself suggests that Vaughan was a student at Oxford University (&#145;ystuwdent &hellip; o Rydychen wych&#146;). The fact that Phylip John Phylip composed fewer poems than any other member of his family and that he died later than any of them indicates that it was becoming more and more difficult for any poet to live by his art by composing poems to Welsh gentry and being paid for his services.<br>
