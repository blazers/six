<span class="headword">Lestrange <span class="st"> [Strange]</span>,  Roger</span>, Lord Lestrange  (<em>d.</em> 1311), <span class="occ">soldier and administrator</span>, was a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16510/', "John (III) Lestrange (c.1194&#150;1269)")</script>, lord of Knockin in Shropshire, and his wife, Lucia, daughter of Robert of Tregoz. Roger benefited from the grant of rebel lands in that and the following year and in 1267 he received his first royal commission, to inquire into the trespasses committed against the king by the men of the rebellious earl of Derby in southern Lancashire. In May 1270 he was appointed sheriff of Yorkshire, an office he continued to hold until October 1274. Although he had interests in many counties, Lestrange was especially active in Cheshire, Shropshire, and Staffordshire, and his prominence in the Welsh marches led to his being much involved in Edward I's conquest of Wales. In 1276 he was sent on a special mission to the marches, and he fought against the Welsh in 1277, when he was empowered to receive the submissions of individual Welshmen, and was given the custody of Oswestry Castle, which he held until 1279. He played a particularly important part in the war of 1282&#150;3. On 30 October 1282 he succeeded Roger (III) Mortimer of Wigmore as commander of the English forces in the region of Whitchurch, Oswestry, and Montgomery, and was closely, if sometimes obscurely, involved in the manoeuvres which culminated in the defeat and death of Prince Llywelyn near Builth on 11 December. Lestrange himself wrote to the king to report his success&#151;&#145;Llywelyn ap Gruffudd is dead, his army defeated, and all the flower of his army dead&#146;  (Edwards, 84&#150;5). He also led the campaign against the Welsh rebellion of Rhys ap Mareddud in 1287, while in 1294&#150;5 he took part in the suppression of the revolt of Madog ap Llywelyn. He also served on the continent in 1295 and 1297.<br>
<br>At the parliament at Acton Burnell on 21 October 1283 Lestrange was appointed chief justice of the forest south of the Trent. He held the office until 12 February 1297, and the forest seems to have occupied much of his attention during that period. He held some forest eyres, and some of his forest eyre rolls have survived. In 1291&#150;2, however, he served as a royal envoy on a mission to the papal court, and he was summoned by name to several parliaments and royal councils, and is consequently regarded as having been Lord Lestrange from 1295. His contribution to the English conquest of Wales received no territorial reward, though Lestrange himself hoped to be granted the lordship of Maelor Saesneg. But throughout his career he received many lesser marks of favour from King Edward, whom he served for many years as a household knight, but seems to have remained in debt to him. In 1306, in consideration of his long service and great expenses in his service, the king granted that Lestrange's executors should not be impeded by reason of his debts to the king from having sufficient of his goods to bury him and provide for his obsequies in a fitting manner. In the last years of his life, after giving up the forest justiceship, he was apparently largely inactive, and is recorded in 1298, 1302, and 1310 as being in poor health, though in 1301 he was involved in assessing the king's wastes in his forests north of the Trent and he also sealed the barons' letter to the pope.<br>
<br>Lestrange died on 31 July 1311. His first wife was Maud, former wife of Roger (II) de Mowbray. She had died by 1275, when he received her lands in dower, at a rent of 200 marks, during the minority of the heir, which lasted until late 1278; his second wife, named Eleanor, was dead by 1280; a third wife, also Maud or Matilda, is mentioned in 1307. Also in 1275 he received a life grant of Ellesmere hundred and castle in Shropshire, and some manors there, which he had received as a gift from his brother Hamo and had surrendered to the king; it remained his principal lordship. Lands in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, including the site of Bedford Castle, part of his third of the barony of Beauchamp of Bedford, which he held by the courtesy of England in right of his first wife, descended to her heir John (I) Mowbray.<br>
