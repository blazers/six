<span class="headword">Tisdal,  Philip</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1703, <em>d.</em> 1777), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was baptized on 1 March 1703 at St Mary's Church, Dublin, the son of Richard Tisdal (<i>d</i>. 1742), registrar of the Irish court of chancery, and MP for Dundalk (1707&#150;13) and Louth (1713&#150;27), and his wife, Marian, daughter of Richard Boyle, MP for Leighlin. He was educated at Thomas Sheridan's school in Capel Street, Dublin, and from 1718 at Trinity College, Dublin, where he was tutored by Swift's friend Patrick Delany. He graduated in 1722 and entered the Middle Temple in 1728. In 1733 he was called to the Irish bar, where he achieved rapid success. His marriage in 1736 to Mary, daughter of the Revd Rowland Singleton, and niece and coheir of Henry Singleton, chief justice of the common pleas and master of the rolls, aided his political career. Not only was she a distinguished beauty, but she was also extremely wealthy. His influential connections enabled him to stand as a parliamentary candidate for Dublin University in 1739, and although initially defeated by Alexander McAuley, who was backed by Swift, Tisdal's petition was successful and he represented the university in the Irish parliament until 1776.<br>
<br>On 21 January 1742 Tisdal was appointed third serjeant-at-law, and became a bencher of the King's Inns, and on the death of his father in October he succeeded him as registrar of the court of chancery. In 1743 he was one of the leading counsel for the plaintiff in the celebrated Anglesey peerage case. In 1751 he was appointed solicitor-general, and on 31 July 1760 attorney-general, appointments which he owed in part to the influence of his new patron, the primate, George Stone. The first of these appointments sparked resentment among the speaker Henry Boyle's party and it was a contributory factor in the increase of tension that led to the money bill dispute of 1753.<br>
<br>Tisdal's parliamentary talents raised him to great eminence as a politician and he was invaluable as a parliamentary speaker to a succession of viceroys. However, his bitter rivalry with John Hely-Hutchinson, MP for Cork City, occasionally persuaded him to obstruct government measures, as did the influence of Primate Stone. During the duke of Bedford's administration he refused to support a money bill until resolutions against the burden of pensions on the Irish establishment were transmitted to London. After the government's defeat Tisdal persuaded the patriot clubs of Dublin to organize a celebration. Although he quickly returned to the government fold once Bedford had made his peace with Stone, he threatened to go into opposition when Richard Rigby, chief secretary, appeared likely to be appointed as master of the rolls. He was eventually assuaged by the offer of the reversion of the post of secretary of state.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1761 Tisdal was again returned, by a large majority, for Dublin University, and in the same year received the freedom of the city of Cork. In the Irish Commons his pre-eminence was challenged by an alliance between Hely-Hutchinson and the new chief secretary, William Gerard Hamilton. But with the assistance of Stone and Lord Shannon, Hamilton's personal ambitions were scuppered and Tisdal returned as leader in the Commons. His political comeback, however, was short-lived as the new viceroy, Lord Hertford, opted for Hely-Hutchinson as his chief parliamentary manager. Tisdal's position had been undermined by the death of Stone and inconsistent government majorities during the previous viceroyalty.<br>
<br>On the death of the lord chancellor, John Bowes, in 1767, Tisdal made a strenuous effort to gain the seals. But despite support from Lord Townshend, the ministry was unwilling to appoint an Irishman to this post, and it went to James Hewitt, Viscount Lifford. Smarting at his treatment Tisdal did not proffer his support for Townshend's planned augmentation of the army. Nevertheless he was able to retain a great degree of influence in the Townshend administration, and that of his successor, Lord Harcourt; his luxurious living and social habits added, in the eyes of both Townshend and Harcourt, to his merits as an adviser. Tisdal, his wife, and their two daughters divided their time between their town mansion in Leinster Street, Dublin, and Stillorgan Park, co. Dublin. The artist Angelica Kauffman, who was patronized by Mary Tisdal, was a frequent visitor to their homes during her stay in Ireland in 1771. As a leading member of the Dublin Castle government Tisdal was satirized in <span class="italic">Baratariana</span>, a compilation of anti-Townshend propaganda pamphlets written by prominent opposition MPs. In this work Tisdal was Don Philip the Moor, but he was more commonly known as Black Phil due to his dark complexion, grave demeanour, and sardonic temper.<br>
<br>Tisdal's support for government was always conditional on his personal advancement, but he was not devoid of patriot sympathies. He voted for the absentee tax despite Harcourt's withdrawal of support, and was reluctant to offer support for parliamentary approval of the American war&#151;although this was partly motivated by pique following the appointment of Henry Flood to the post of Irish vice-treasurer, which Tisdal wanted for himself. In 1776 Tisdal's election for the university seat was opposed by Richard Hely-Hutchinson, the son of his rival. Tisdal was defeated, but was returned at the same general election for Armagh. A petition was lodged against Hutchinson's return, which was subsequently declared void. Tisdal's death at Spa in the Netherlands on 11 September 1777 was a severe blow to government, which struggled against a rejuvenated opposition during the Buckinghamshire viceroyalty. Tisdal was buried at Finglas, near Dublin.<br>
