<span class="headword">Amphlett,  John</span>  (1845&#150;1918), <span class="occ">historian and diarist</span>, was born at Sydenham, Kent, on 22 March 1845, the eldest of the three children of John Amphlett (1839&#150;1868) of Clent and his wife, Jane (1812&#150;1888), daughter of Robert Smithson of Skipwith, Yorkshire. John Amphlett was seventh in nine successive generations of John Amphletts of Clent, a parish annexed to Worcestershire from Staffordshire in 1842. The first John Amphlett of Hadzor and Clent died without children, and it was from his youngest brother, Joseph (1672&#150;1720), that the eight successive generations descended.<br>
<br>John Amphlett was sent to a dame-school at Kidderminster, but cried; after a week he returned home for private tuition until May 1854 when he became a weekly boarder at Stourbridge grammar school. An early example of a propensity for noting what he saw and did was his recording the number of birds' eggs he collected annually from 1852 to 1855, and on 1 January 1854 he began his first diary, entering: &#145;Went to church.&#146; On 19 January he wrote: &#145;Hunted at Island Pool with foxhounds; had no run.&#146; He continued his diary until a few days before his death in 1918, thus providing a mine of information and gossip for social historians. He later moved to Bromsgrove School, and went from there to Worcester College, Oxford, as a commoner in October 1864. He did not work, and failed most of his examinations. Leaving Oxford in 1867 he became a student in the Inner Temple and continued his life of pleasure in Paris.<br>
<br>In 1868 Amphlett's father who, having parted from his wife, was living at Lydney, Gloucestershire, was thrown from his dog cart when driving home from viewing the ruins of Tintern Abbey by moonlight (his companion said he was the worse for drink) and died from his injuries. The new, financially independent, squire of Clent took on further responsibilities when on 18 August 1869 he married Eliza Anne (<i>d</i>. 1919), only child of Edward Biven Baylie, a former Quaker who had retired to Clent from his chain manufacturing and iron merchant's business in Stourbridge. After a continental honeymoon Amphlett settled down at Clent Cottage, and in 1870, having skimped his legal studies but paid his dues, he was called to the bar. Although a qualified barrister he practised for only a few years, but was called on from time to time to deputize for the judge in west midlands county courts. He returned to Oxford and took his MA in 1871.<br>
<br>A son and heir (also John), the first of three children, was born on 18 March 1872, but Amphlett's health caused concern and in December he sailed for Jamaica. His long letters home to his wife consisted almost entirely of notes about what he had observed, and these he turned into his first book, <span class="italic">Under a Tropical Sky</span> (1873). A novel, <span class="italic">Warnton Kings</span>, was published in 1874 after his return. An enthusiastic member of the Worcestershire Naturalists' Club, he was elected president for 1876&#150;9. He edited the botany section for the <span class="roman">Victoria county history</span> of Worcestershire and compiled for it the list of the county's flowering plants. His major contribution to botanical studies was <span class="italic">The Botany of Worcestershire</span> (1909), compiled with Carleton Rea, another Worcester barrister. He made a worthy contribution to geological studies, notably in mapping the erratic boulders he located in Worcestershire; he was president of the Dudley and Midland Geological Society in 1885 and 1886. His research into the history of Clent and the Amphletts led not merely to the publication of <span class="italic">A Short History of Clent</span> (1890) and <span class="italic">Amphlett of Clent</span> (1905) but to substantial works of scholarship and to his becoming a moving spirit in founding the Worcestershire Historical Society. Greatly impressed by the volumes of <span class="italic">Collections for a History of Staffordshire</span>, published from 1880 by the William Salt Archaeological Society (which he joined when it was formed in 1879), he pressed for a publishing society in Worcestershire, and the Worcestershire Historical Society was established in 1893. For one year joint editor with J. W. Willis Bund, Amphlett continued as sole editor until 1908; to the society's list of publications he personally contributed a number of volumes, including a series of Worcestershire lay subsidy rolls (between 1893 and 1902), a biographical introduction and index to Nash's <span class="italic">Collections for the History of Worcestershire</span> (1894&#150;5), the churchwardens' accounts of St Michael's in Bedwardine, Worcester, 1539&#150;1603 (1896), and an index of Worcestershire fines 1649&#150;1714 (1896&#150;7). He also collated the manuscripts of Habington's survey of Worcestershire (1893&#150;9), and published the Kyre Park charters (1905) and the rolls of Hales manor (1272&#150;1307). The latter, deciphered with the help of the Revd S. G. Hamilton, was published in two volumes (1910 and 1912), a work of exceptional value to students of medieval history.<br>
<br>Amphlett was a member of Worcestershire county council for over twenty years, chairman of Bromsgrove poor-law union and of Clent parish council, and a magistrate and chairman of the Stourbridge bench from 1902 to 1918; he also served many local committees and organizations. His later years were troubled by a lengthy dispute over his encroachment onto Clent Hill Common; he had been involved in setting up a board of conservators for the area and had chaired the board in 1881, and was consequently deeply embarrassed to be accused of moving his boundary fence onto the common land. His case went on appeal to the House of Lords after his death, the lords finding for the conservators.<br>
<br>For several years Amphlett spent most of his time on the continent, but at the outbreak of war in 1914 he left Rome for Kensington. His health had declined over some years and he returned to Clent, where he died on 23 June 1918 and was buried on 26 June in the family vault under Clent church chancel. His grandchild John Amphlett was killed in the western desert while serving with the RAF in 1942, and the line of John Amphletts of Clent ended.<br>
<br>John Amphlett had continued his diary until 19 June 1918, when he wrote, &#145;After tea Lord Cobham called, and we had a long natter, hill common and everything included; but I shall allow nothing to interfere with our life long friendship.&#146; His portrait bookplate, inserted in each of the thirty-six morocco-bound volumes and six volumes of index, shows him in 1895 as bald, heavily bearded, beetle-browed, and tight-lipped, belying his amiable nature. The diary was willed to Worcester College by his son, John Amphlett (1872&#150;1949), and the family archives, historical manuscripts, and transcripts were deposited in Worcestershire Record Office in 1950.<br>
