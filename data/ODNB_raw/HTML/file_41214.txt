<span class="headword">Reeves <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Robison]</span>,  Magdalen Stuart</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Maud Pember Reeves]</span>  (1865&#150;1953), <span class="occ">suffragist and socialist</span>, was born on 24 December 1865 at Mudgee, New South Wales, the third of ten children of William Smoult Robison, a bank manager, and his wife, Mary, a literary and well-travelled relative of the Carr-Saunders family of Surrey. When Maud, as she was always known, was two years old, her parents migrated to Christchurch, New Zealand, an Anglican settlement founded on the colonizing principles of Edward Gibbon Wakefield. She was one of the first pupils at the new Christchurch High School for Girls. A &#145;keen and spirited&#146; pupil, she developed a passion for the theatre. Tall and striking, with a handsome face, full red lips, dark eyes, and brown hair, Maud met her husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38493/', "William Pember Reeves (1857&#150;1932)")</script>, a journalist and politician eight years her senior, at a coming-out ball when she was nineteen. The son of a newspaper proprietor, who &#145;grew up an Englishman&#146;, Reeves was an ambitious&#151;if absent-minded&#151;politician whose vision for New Zealand was &#145;no slums and no poverty&#146;. They married at Christchurch on 10 February 1885.<br>
<br>Newly married, Maud acted, helped her mother-in-law in charitable works, and for three years was the lady editor of the weekly <span class="italic">Canterbury Times</span>, edited by her husband and owned by his father. The Reeves's first child, William, lived only a few hours. Their daughter Amber [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63956/', "White, Amber Blanco")</script>] was born in 1887. After the birth of her second daughter, Beryl, in 1889, Maud took the first part of a BA in French, mathematics, and English at Canterbury College (founded in 1873). In 1890 the family moved to Wellington, where William Reeves had been a radical member of the house of representatives since 1887. Maud's studies were abandoned for her duties as the wife of a minister and suffragism. She had been converted to women's suffrage by Julius Vogel, a former prime minister and friend of her husband. She had been president and founder of the women's section of the Christchurch Liberal Association. Education, she believed, would both convince women of the need to vote and civilize national debate. Although never a temperance advocate, she worked closely with Kate Sheppard, the Women's Christian Temperance Union's suffrage superintendent, and Ellen Ballance, the prime minister's wife, and she used her considerable charm to influence her husband's colleagues. In September 1893 New Zealand was the first country in the world to grant women the vote, and Maud chaired the first public meeting of enfranchised women in Christchurch on 11 October.<br>
<br>In March 1896 William Reeves was appointed New Zealand agent-general in London. Maud followed him eagerly thither with the three children, Fabian having been born in December 1895. The Reeves immediately made friends with the Fabians, whose essays they had read and who admired Reeves's experience in government. They spent country weekends with the Webbs, Shaws, and Blands, working, bicycling, and talking. Maud joined the Women's Liberal Association, the Fabian Society in 1904, and the executive of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in 1906. At Maud's instigation the Fabian Society's statement of its basic aims included a clause on equal citizenship in 1907, when she was elected, with Ethel Bentham and Marian Phillips, to the society's executive committee. The first meeting of the Fabian Women's Group, which she founded with Charlotte Wilson, the anarchist, was held in her Brunswick Gardens drawing-room early in 1908, after a winter of suffrage agitation.<br>
<br>The Lambeth mothers' project, initiated by Maud, was prompted by the recognition that more infants died in the London slums than in Kensington or Hampstead. It asked &#145;How does a working man's wife bring up a family on 20s a week?&#146;, and from it sprang Maud's <span class="italic">Round about a Pound a Week</span> (1913), one of the sharpest of the many works of Edwardian social observation. Forty-two families were selected from a lying-in hospital in Lambeth, London, to have weekly visits, medical examinations from Dr Ethel Bentham every two weeks, and 5<i>s</i>. to be paid to the mother for extra nourishment for three months before the birth of the baby and for one year afterwards. The money came from private donations, and the mothers wrote down their weekly expenditure. Eight families withdrew because the husbands objected to this weekly scrutiny. Eight other mothers who could not read or write dictated their sums to their husbands or children. The verbatim accounts of the &#145;maternal manner of recollecting&#146;&#151;&#145;Mr. G's wages was 19 bob out of that e took thruppons for es diner witch is not mutch e bein sutch a arty man&#146;&#151;is one of the features of the book which is in part an ironic comment on class relations: Lambeth women, familiar with the habits of educated visitors, politely anticipated sitting in draughts, listening to the gospel of porridge, and being advised against marriage.<br>
<br>Poverty, the book argued, and neither maternal ignorance nor degeneration, caused ill health and high mortality. Had the children of Lambeth been &#145;well housed, well fed, well clothed and well tended from birth&#146; who knows what they would have become. Fabian women were would-be law makers. The state must cast off its &#145;masculine&#146; guise and &#145;co-parent&#146;. The individual not the family should be the economic unit, and the state should pay family endowment, train midwives, make burial &#145;a free and honourable public service&#146;, introduce a legal minimum wage, and build clean, light, roomy buildings at economic rents for the working classes. If socialism should address the needs of working mothers then women themselves must want more: &#145;If people living on &pound;1 a week had lively imaginations, their lives, and perhaps the face of England, would be different.&#146;<br>
<br>Maud's own household was unorthodox. In 1900 Maud's favourite sister, Effie Lascelles, recently widowed, moved in with her two daughters. Amber remembered a house filled with children, relatives, servants, nursemaids, &#145;frightful rows&#146; in the nursery, and her mother too busy to pay much attention to children. The Reeves marriage after the birth of Fabian was not intimate. William did not approve of birth control. The tensions in their marriage, H. G. Wells&#151;who until his affair with Amber was a close friend&#151;wrote, were about money and birth control. When Amber, then a student at Cambridge, became pregnant by H. G. Wells&#151;a public and political scandal&#151;Maud offended her daughter by suggesting an abortion.<br>
<br>In March 1917 Maud was appointed director of women's services in the Ministry of Food, and in June 1917 Fabian died of wounds sustained during service in the First World War. Maud turned privately to spiritualism, and later to Higher Thought. From the early 1920s her participation in public life declined. She travelled to New Zealand with William in 1925, but while she had conversed with the London poor she had never met a Maori. She was a conscientious grandmother, and she nursed both William and her sister through their final illnesses. Amber described her mother as &#145;serious-minded&#146; and &#145;obviously chaste to the last degree&#146;. Her focus on the needs of others was as austere as her prose, but the unflinching eye for detail and clamour of voices in <span class="italic">Round about a Pound a Week</span> dramatized both the &#145;almost intolerable conditions&#146; of women's daily lives and Fabian feminism's response. After twenty-one years as a widow, having lived with her sister Effie in Cambridge, Maud died in a nursing home at 27 Powis Gardens, Golders Green, Middlesex, on 13 September 1953.<br>
