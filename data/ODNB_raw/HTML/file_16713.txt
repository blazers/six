<span class="headword">Lindsay,  Patrick</span>  (1566&#150;1644), <span class="occ">archbishop of Glasgow</span>, was the son of Alexander Lindsay, portioner of Monikie, Forfarshire, and Jean, daughter of Alexander Guthrie the younger of that ilk. After graduating MA from St Andrews University in 1587 he was appointed minister of Guthrie in 1588. He was translated to St Vigeans in the same county in the early 1590s, and although he was appointed bishop of Ross in 1613 (consecrated 1 December) he remained minister of St Vigeans until 1618, and thereafter joint minister of the parish until 1630. At some point early in his career he married Helen, daughter of Patrick Whitelaw of Newgrange.<br>
<br>Lindsay, who is said to have been &#145;a very fervent preacher&#146;  (Keith and Spottiswoode, 265), had been appointed a member of the new Scottish court of high commission in 1610, and on 31 March 1615 he was admitted to the Scottish privy council. He sat in many general assemblies, actively supporting the five articles of Perth in 1618. On 13 August 1633 he was translated to the archbishopric of Glasgow, and in 1637 appears to have been diligent in trying to gain acceptance for the new Scottish prayer book, contradicting the later report that he had been &#145;much against the liturgy&#146;  (ibid., 265). After open opposition to the new book emerged charges were raised against him in his own presbytery of Glasgow and were referred to the general assembly that sat there in 1638.<br>
<br>By this time Lindsay was not only demoralized by the collapse of royal authority in church and state in face of the opposition of the covenanters, but was disillusioned by bitter financial disputes with the bullying earl of Traquair, the treasurer: &#145;Glasgow he abuses pitifullie at his pleasure&#146; it had been reported in 1637  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.7&#150;8). He therefore wavered, considering escaping the threat of excommunication by accepting the authority of the assembly over him: &#145;He seemed oft not farre from this course&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.157). Though living in his house next to the cathedral in which the assembly was being held, he refused to appear before it, but was said to be &#145;contented verbally&#146; to accept its authority, but would not do so in writing  (Gordon, 2.140). The assembly ordered his deprivation from office on 11 December, but allowed him the chance of escaping excommunication if he submitted without reservation by 13 December, the day on which the sentences on all the bishops were formally pronounced. When he failed to do so he was both deprived and excommunicated.<br>
<br>&#145;Since that time he hes lived verie privatelie, miskent [despised] by all&#146;, it was noted late in 1639  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.157). He was said to have fled to England in January 1639, &#145;in great seiknes&#146;  (J. Spalding, <span class="italic">Memorialls of the Trubles</span>, 2 vols., 1850&#150;51, 1.244&#150;5). In December 1640 he was one of a number of deposed Scottish bishops in London &#145;in great povertie&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.188). He was buried on 2 July 1644 in York, being left &#145;to be put in the earth by some few poor men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 2.213), the rest of those attending the funeral having departed hastily on news of the battle being fought at Marston Moor.<br>
