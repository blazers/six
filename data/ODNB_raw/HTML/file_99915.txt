<span class="headword">Harling,  (Henry) Robert</span>  (1910&#150;2008), <span class="occ">typographic designer, novelist, and magazine editor</span>, was born on 27 March 1910 at 27 Thorpedale Road, Islington, London, the elder son of Henry Robert Harling (1876&#150;1954), taxi driver and former regular soldier, and his wife, Adelaide Lavinia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thomas (1876&#150;1949). He and his younger brother, Arthur Stanley (<i>b</i>. 1912), were brought up by their parents in north London. Harling later gave a characteristically unreliable account of his upbringing in his semi-autobiographical novel <span class="italic">Amateur Sailor</span>, published in 1944 under the pseudonym Nicholas Drew, in which he claimed that his parents died young and he was brought up in Brighton by a so-called &#145;aunt&#146;, a family friend, and her dairyman husband. It would have delighted him that this romanticized account appeared as fact in his obituaries.<br>
<br>Harling, known in the family as Robbie, attended Dame Alice Owen's School in Highbury. He showed a precocious interest in the design of print and lettering and this became the ruling passion of his life. He enrolled as a student of typography at the Central School of Arts and Crafts at some point during an unsettled and somewhat frenzied early period in which he also worked for the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span>, gained experience at the Lund Humphries printing works in Bradford and the Kynoch Press in Birmingham, and made use of a family legacy to open a bookshop selling first editions and poetry in Lamb's Conduit Street, London. His outlook was already that of the sophisticated metropolitan.<br>
<br>In 1932 Harling entered the then burgeoning world of modern advertising, taking a job as designer at Stuart's, an agency well known for its illustrated booklets for Fortnum and Mason. Four years later he moved to Everett Jones and Delamere, the agency financed by the young Lord Delamere, as a freelance designer. His promotion to creative director allowed him to commission work from his favourite artists, Edward Bawden, Rex Whistler, and Eric Ravilious. His redesign of the cover for <span class="italic">Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack</span> in 1938, with its Ravilious engraving of Victorian cricketers, is regarded as a typographic classic of its time. The cover used Harling's own Victorian-style typeface Playbill, developed in 1938 with the Sheffield typefounders Stephenson Blake for whom he also designed Chisel (1935), Tea Chest (1939), and Keyboard (1951).<br>
<br>Harling was quick on the uptake and able to predict, and indeed to stimulate, the coming resurgence of interest in Victoriana. Two books on the Victorian period&#151;<span class="italic">The London Miscellany</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">Home, a Victorian Vignette</span> (1938)&#151;reinforced his reputation as an authority on period design and decoration. But he was notably eclectic in tastes, his authority also encompassing the continental modern. In 1935 he organized an exhibition of Rudolph Koch's Klingspor types at Lund Humphries's office in London. This was followed by an exhibition on Jan Tschichold; Harling wrote the first article about the Swiss typographer to appear in Britain. It was published in <span class="italic">Printing</span> magazine in 1936 with the typically Harlingesque heading, &#145;What is this &#147;functional&#148; typography? The work of Jan Tschichold. The man is different!&#146;. At this period he also made friends with the great English type designer Eric Gill, visiting him at Pigotts. Harling's later book, <span class="italic">The Letter Forms and Type Designs of Eric Gill</span> (1976), was recognized as the most authoritative study of this aspect of Gill's work.<br>
<br>Harling's breadth of knowledge and enormous range of contacts, as well as his sheer energy and zest for life, made him a natural magazine editor. In November 1936 the first issue of <span class="italic">Typography</span> appeared. This was an innovative periodical conceived by Harling with his slightly older friend James Shand and published by Shand's family firm, the Shenval Press. The magazine was original in its coverage of lettering of all kinds, not just fine book printing. The first issue contained an article on Kardomah tea labels; the second an analysis of train ticket typography. Harling's early championing of typographic ephemera anticipated 1960s pop culture. Eight issues were published before <span class="italic">Typography</span> ended with the outbreak of the Second World War.<br>
<br>Harling's war was eventful. Always a keen sailor, he volunteered for the Royal Navy and, before he had finished training, assisted in the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk in May 1940. He described the episode in <span class="italic">Amateur Sailor</span>, a book praised by John Masefield as the best of all eyewitness accounts of Dunkirk. As a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve he served as navigator of a corvette on convoy duty in the western approaches, an experience he recounted in a further vivid personal narrative, <span class="italic">The Steep Atlantick Stream</span> (1946). His close friendship with the writer Ian Fleming began in 1939 when Fleming, already working in intelligence, commissioned him to redesign the Admiralty's weekly intelligence report. In 1941 Fleming, now assistant to the director of naval intelligence, recruited Harling first to the inter-services topographical division, to work on gathering and publishing information on potential enemy targets, and later as a member of Fleming's own 30 assault unit, referred to by Harling as &#145;Fleming's secret army&#146;, operating in the front line at the end of the war to capture enemy code books, wireless equipment, and so on, before these could be destroyed. Harling became the unit's expert on mines and minefields.<br>
<br>Harling had been present when, in 1944, Fleming stated his intention to write &#145;the spy novel to end all spy novels&#146;. The result was James Bond, a fictional character who bore a distinct resemblance to Harling in his sardonic elegance of manner and cool sexual expertise. In 1945, when Fleming was foreign manager at the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>, Harling was appointed consultant designer to the paper, remaining blissfully happy in the part-time post for the next forty years. He was also for a while the architecture critic for the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span>. The journalistic world of power politics fascinated him and when he too began writing fiction Fleet Street provided him with a potent theme. His first novel, <span class="italic">The Paper Palace</span> (1951), was a thriller about a reporter sent out by a corrupt editor on the trail of a dead man. It gave an acute and chilling picture of English journalism at that period as did his later book, <span class="italic">The Hollow Sunday</span> (1967). Of his other five novels the most successful was <span class="italic">The Endless Colonnade</span> (1958), a suspense novel about a physician in Italy being pursued by killers. Harling loved Italy and would revisit Venice year after year.<br>
<br>After the war Harling resumed his typographical enthusiasms. He and James Shand inaugurated a new graphic design periodical, <span class="italic">Alphabet &amp; Image</span>, eight issues of which appeared between 1946 and 1948. This was followed by <span class="italic">Image</span>, ostensibly a quarterly concentrating on the visual arts. Eight volumes were published between 1948 and summer 1952. Under Harling's brilliantly entrepreneurial editorship the journal published work by such important post-war artists as John Minton, Leonard Rosomon, Blair Hughes-Stanton, and Edward Ardizzone. In 1948, again with Shand, he set up the Art and Tecnics publishing firm, commissioning a series of exceptionally elegant and expert books on architecture, including John Summerson on Sir John Soane and Hugh Casson on Victorian buildings. In 1957 he started the last of his many varied but interconnected lives as editor of <span class="italic">House &amp; Garden</span> magazine, published by Cond&eacute; Nast and based at Vogue House in Hanover Square. He liked the ambience of what he called &#145;the glossies&#146;, relishing their absurdities and making the most of his many opportunities to encourage young illustrators and designers. He was an autocratic, effective, imaginative editor, adored by his largely female staff, who extended the potential of a magazine previously limited to decoration into architecture and social commentary, inventing the journalistic &#145;lifestyle&#146; feature. He edited <span class="italic">House &amp; Garden</span> until 1993.<br>
<br>Harling married first, on 25 October 1930, Mary Adelaide Homer (1910&#150;2002), drapery saleswoman, and daughter of William Thomas Homer, cartage contractor (and a friend of Harling's father). After their divorce (in 1942 she married the advertising agent Sydney Righyni) she was quickly edited out of his life; later friends remained unaware of her existence. He then married, on 3 April 1945, a psychiatrist's beautiful assistant, Phoebe Pauline Helen Konstam, formerly Kohnstamm (1911&#150;2006). His own version of their meeting was that he had picked her up in Leicester Square. It was apparently a very happy marriage, surviving Harling's many liaisons&#151;some long-lasting, some less so&#151;elsewhere. They had three children (two sons and a daughter), two of whom became journalists, the third a painter. The family lived in an exquisite house, Glebe House at Godstone in Surrey, an eighteenth-century pink-washed gothick vicarage, which Harling reconfigured by removing the top storey. When the planning authorities objected he was able to present the evidence to prove that he had simply returned the building to the architect's original intention.<br>
<br>Harling was a lean, handsome, raffish man who cut a figure of considerable glamour in drab London in the 1950s, wearing well-cut Edwardian-style suits and a fedora. His friend the artist Lucian Freud, noting Harling's drainpipe trousers, enquired how he managed to make quick getaways. He was loyal and affectionate to selected friends but not generally gregarious. He showed a characteristic ruthlessness in divesting himself of his family at an early stage. Ruari McLean described him as &#145;exceptionally non-boring. One probably never knew much about him; but one never forgot him&#146;. He died of cancer on 1 July 2008 at Glebe House, and was survived by his three children. He was cremated at Surrey and Sussex crematorium on 10 July 2008.<br>
