<span class="headword">Cruttwell,  Charles Thomas</span>  (1847&#150;1911), <span class="occ">classical scholar and Church of England clergyman</span>, was born in London on 30 July 1847, the eldest son of Charles James Cruttwell, barrister, of the Inner Temple, and his wife, Elizabeth Anne, daughter of Admiral Thomas Sanders. Educated under J. A. Hessey at Merchant Taylors' School (1861&#150;6), he proceeded with a foundation scholarship to St John's College, Oxford, in 1866. He was in the first class in classical moderations in 1868 and in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1870, graduating BA in 1871 and MA in 1874; he obtained the Pusey and Ellerton Hebrew scholarship in 1869, won the Craven scholarship for classics in 1871, and the Kennicott Hebrew scholarship in 1872. He was president of the Oxford Union Society in 1872. He was a fellow of Merton College from 1870 until 1885, and was tutor there from 1874 to 1877. Ordained deacon by the bishop of Oxford in 1875 and priest in 1876, he was curate of St Giles's, Oxford, from 1875 to 1877.<br>
<br>In 1877 Cruttwell left Oxford for Bradfield College, where he was headmaster until 1880, when he was appointed headmaster of Malvern College. Despite his efficient scholarship he showed little aptitude for public school administration, and resigned in 1885 to become rector of Sutton, Surrey. A few months later he was appointed rector of Denton, Norfolk, and in 1891 he accepted from Merton College the benefice of Kibworth-Beauchamp. In 1901 he was nominated by Lord Salisbury to the crown benefice of Ewelme, near Wallingford, and in 1903 he was collated by the bishop of Peterborough to a residential canonry. Cruttwell was also select preacher to Oxford University in 1896&#150;8, and again in 1903&#150;5. In 1909 he joined the party of bishops and clergy who visited Germany in the cause of international peace.<br>
<br>On 5 August 1884 Cruttwell married Annie Maud (<i>d</i>. 1926), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19456/', "Sir John Robert Mowbray, first baronet")</script>. They had three sons and one daughter; one son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32655/', "Charles Robert Mowbray Fraser Cruttwell (1887&#150;1941)")</script>, became principal of Hertford College, Oxford. Cruttwell died at Ewelme rectory on 4 April 1911.<br>
<br>Deeply read in ancient and modern literature, Cruttwell published little. The best of his books, <span class="italic">A History of Roman Literature</span> (1877), was a concise account of the development of Roman literature from the earliest times until the death of Marcus Aurelius. It reached a sixth edition in 1898.<br>
