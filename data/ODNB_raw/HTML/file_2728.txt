<span class="headword">Blyth,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1450&#150;1499), <span class="occ">bishop of Salisbury</span>, was the son of William Blyth of Norton, on the Derbyshire&#150;Yorkshire border, and of a sister of Thomas Rotherham, archbishop of York (<i>d</i>. 1500). His younger brother Geoffrey Blyth (<i>d</i>. 1530) became bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. A fellow from 1476&#150;7, and warden from 1488 to 1498, of the King's Hall in the University of Cambridge, John Blyth was created a DCL in 1485 and served as chancellor of the university from 1494, probably until his death. Rotherham, while bishop of Lincoln, gave him the archdeaconry of Stow in 1477, and then the archdeaconry of Huntingdon in 1478, which he held until 1494; he also held a canonry in Lincoln Cathedral with the prebend of Leighton Ecclesia (1482&#150;5). Benefiting further from Rotherham's patronage after his uncle's translation to York, Blyth was a canon of York Minster, with the very valuable prebend of Masham, 1484&#150;94, and held the important office of archdeacon of Richmond (1485&#150;94). Henry VII promoted him to the bishopric of Salisbury by papal provision on 13 November 1493, and he was consecrated on 23 February 1494.<br>
<br>From March to August 1499 Blyth presided over a series of heresy trials at Reading, Sonning, and Ramsbury. Otherwise he left little impression on his see, retaining the officials of his predecessor and employing a suffragan to celebrate ordinations on all but two occasions (in 1498). He was installed in his cathedral church by proxy, and his first recorded presence in the diocese was in August 1494. He resided chiefly at the episcopal manors at Ramsbury and Sonning. He advanced his brother Geoffrey, to whom he gave several benefices including&#151;on the day before he died&#151;the archdeaconry of Sarum. In 1496 the islands of Jersey and Guernsey were taken from the see of Coutances and added to that of Salisbury, but in 1499 they were incorporated in Winchester diocese.<br>
<br>On 5 May 1492 Blyth was appointed keeper (or master) of the rolls. This was an office several times given to trained civilians who afterwards became bishops in the later middle ages, and like other such holders Blyth resigned it when he was consecrated to his see. The appointment suggests involvement in government at this time, as does the fact that he was appointed to commissions of the peace for fifteen counties in the midlands in May 1493; however, from November 1494 he served only on the commissions for Berkshire, Dorset, and Wiltshire (that is, for the counties in his diocese), and for the town of Cambridge. He died on 23 August 1499 in Ramsbury, apparently suddenly, and was buried behind the high altar of his cathedral church, beneath the confessional chair, being laid north and south, in a tomb which, according to Leland, was constructed but not used by Bishop Richard Beauchamp (<i>d</i>. 1481). Blyth's will, made on the day of his death and proved one month later, does not survive.<br>
