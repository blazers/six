<span class="headword">Stocqueler,  Joachim Hayward</span>  (1801&#150;1886), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in London on 21 July 1801, the son of Joachim Christian Stocqueler (<i>d</i>. 1813), an insurance broker of Hatton Garden, who was of Portuguese extraction, and his wife Elizabeth, second daughter of Dr Francis Hayward of Hackney. His paternal grandmother was the opera singer, Joanna Stocqueler [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/106538/', "Giovanna Sestini")</script>]. He was educated in Camden Town by a French &eacute;migr&eacute;, and completed his education in St Omer, France. Although he had theatrical ambitions (there were suggestions of a family connection with George Siddons, son of the actress Sarah Siddons) he decided to enter the army of the East India Company, and arrived in Bombay in 1819. Buying himself out, he became a clerk in India, serving in the secretariat of the commander-in-chief at Bombay, Sir Charles Colville, while also writing occasionally for the <span class="italic">Bombay Argus</span>. After briefly visiting England in 1826 he returned to India, where he edited several newspapers and journals, including <span class="italic">Iris</span>, the <span class="italic">Bengal Hurkaru</span>, the <span class="italic">Bengal Herald</span>, <span class="italic">The Englishman</span>, the <span class="italic">Bengal Sporting Magazine</span>, and the <span class="italic">East India United Services Journal</span>. In 1829 he married Jane Spencer, with whom he had a son, Edwin Roper Loftus Stocqueler (1829&#150;1895), who became an artist. His <span class="italic">Fifteen Months' Pilgrimage through Khuzistan and Persia</span> (2 vols., 1832) was published in London, which he visited in 1832, returning in 1833 to Calcutta, where he was the subject of insolvency proceedings in 1840.<br>
<br>After Lord Auckland's disastrous military campaign in Afghanistan, Stocqueler returned to England in 1843 to find a wider market for his Indian experience. He wrote <span class="italic">Memorials of Affghanistan</span> (1843), which documented the British expedition there in 1838&#150;42, followed by the <span class="italic">Handbook of India</span> (1844), the first of several books on British India. Separated from his first wife, who went to Australia, he married, in 1844 Eliza, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson (1825&#150;1902), the adopted daughter of William Pepper, with whom he had two sons. He became an investor in the Olympic Theatre, in which he lost money (becoming involved in bankruptcy proceedings between 1846 and 1851), and co-wrote a pantomime, <span class="italic">Robin Hood</span> (<i>c</i>.1846), and a novel, <span class="italic">Maid Marian</span> (1849), developing the Robin Hood literary tradition. In 1847 he became editor of the <span class="italic">United Service Gazette</span>, and in the following year he wrote the memoirs of the Afghanistan commander Sir William Nott. His other activities included cramming candidates for the Sandhurst entrance examinations and giving lectures to accompany dioramas on the overland route to India, the campaigns of the duke of Wellington (of whom he wrote a memoir in 1852), and the Crimean War. A period as a manager for the Professional Life Assurance Office was followed by bankruptcy in 1858. As partner in an agency involved in obtaining commissions in the army he was subject in 1859 to public allegations of jobbery  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 26 April 1859) and later that year he fled from Maidstone insolvent debtors' court, where proceedings against him were being heard, when he was threatened with indictment for forgery  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 21 Dec 1859).<br>
<br>Having arrived in New York in January 1860, Stocqueler served as a newspaper correspondent in the United States throughout the American Civil War and wrote works under the name Joachim Hayward Siddons. Divorced from his second wife, he married, about 1863, Elizabeth Cameron, with whom he had a son. Back in England, he was described as a widower when he married, at Holy Trinity church, Haverstock Hill, on 19 July 1870, Mary Agnes (<i>b</i>. 1839/40), daughter of Frederick Ganen Cameron. In 1871, 1872, and 1875 he received grants of financial assistance from the Royal Literary Fund. Among his later works were a biography of the orientalist G. W. Leitner (1872), two historical works on the British army and Horse Guards (1871 and 1873), and a book (1873) professing to be his autobiography (originally published in the <span class="italic">Times of India</span>) but later withdrawn. His later years were spent in the USA, where he produced a compendium of words occurring in the plays of Shakespeare (1886). He died in Washington, DC, on 14 March 1886. His works are remarkable for their breadth of coverage and their sheer volume. A few were well reviewed at the time: not all are forgotten.<br>
