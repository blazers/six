<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Baldwin,  Robert</span>  (1804&#150;1858), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Canada</span>, was born on 12 May 1804 at York, Upper Canada, the eldest of the five sons of <a name="cosubject_54612"></a><span class="headword">William Warren Baldwin</span>  (1775&#150;1844), also a <span class="occ">lawyer and politician in Canada</span>, and his wife, (Margaret) Phoebe Willcocks (1771&#150;1851). Robert Baldwin's grandfather, also Robert Baldwin (1741&#150;1816), was a member of a moderately prosperous Anglo-Irish family. In 1799 he left Ireland as a widower to settle some 40 miles east of York (later Toronto), the capital of Upper Canada, with two sons and four daughters. William Warren was the fifth of the sixteen children born to him and Barbara Spread (1748&#150;1791). Born at Knockmore, co. Cork, on 25 April 1775, he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh (<i>c</i>.1794&#150;7), and in 1802 he left the family home to go to York to practise medicine. On 31 May 1803 he married Phoebe, the daughter of his influential landlord, William Willcocks, formerly mayor of Cork. He had already been admitted to the bar, and had been licensed to practise law in the previous month. Shrewd, hard-working, and well placed, William prospered; his wife inherited her father's property in 1813 and additional property in 1822.<h2>
<a name="Entryintopolitics"></a>Entry into politics</h2>Although neither William nor his father had trouble securing government appointments, William identified more with the &#145;outs&#146; than the &#145;ins&#146;. Anxious about the prospects of his family, he felt that a Scots clique discriminated against all others. Indeed, several friends and acquaintances had already fallen foul of officialdom. His father had sought parliamentary reform in Ireland: William found similar reason to agitate for reform in Upper Canada. Although the province had an assembly, it had an appointed lieutenant-governor and two appointed councils, one legislative, the other executive. This structure invited abuses. In 1820 William stood successfully for the assembly, and soon gravitated to the side of the government's critics. In the country tradition of British politics, he was for limited government and the independence of its constituent parts. He proposed a bill in 1822 to free the assembly from the control of the legislative council (the latter emasculated the legislation). In 1824 he failed in a bid for re-election, but he was soon joined in his political and legal enterprises by his son Robert.<br>
<br>Robert, who had earlier attended the district grammar school in York, had begun studying law in 1819; he became a clerk in his father's law office in 1820 and was called to the bar in 1825. On 31 May 1827 he married a first cousin, Augusta Elizabeth Sullivan (1811&#150;1836), to whom he was devoted and with whom he had two sons and two daughters. In 1828 he stood unsuccessfully for the assembly but had the satisfaction of seeing his father triumphant. Both Baldwins were identified with the nascent reform movement, whose members prized their status as gentlemen because it helped make reform respectable. None the less, both men lost in the elections of 1830. Neither stood four years later when reformers won a majority of seats. This angered the fiery William Lyon Mackenzie, who felt that they had failed their colleagues.<h2>
<a name="Thestruggleforresponsiblegovernment"></a>The struggle for responsible government</h2>The Baldwins distrusted Mackenzie and other radicals, who they felt were inclined to take the reformers in an American, republican direction. They desired British forms and solutions. In a reform petition of 5 July 1828 to the British government William complained of the irresponsibility of officials, arguing that responsibility had already been granted constitutionally. He informed the prime minister, Wellington, that Upper Canada needed &#145;a provincial ministry &hellip; responsible to the provincial parliament&#146;  (Careless, 105). Increasingly the Baldwins, especially Robert, came to see responsible government as the great panacea. The governor should choose his executive councillors from the party that had control of the assembly and should hear their advice on all matters. If unable to accept that advice, he should dissolve the assembly and call an election.<br>
<br>The conception that the ministers of the crown should be responsible to parliament for the conduct of the executive arm of government was well established in Britain. In both Canadas, notably Lower Canada, notions of responsibility had been raised before the Anglo-American War (1812&#150;14). It was the Baldwins' genius that they (especially Robert) came to promote responsible government which, as William explained to Joseph Hume in 1830, &#145;would, of itself, indirectly lead to the removal of all our present grievances and prevent the recurrence of any such for the future&#146;  (Wilson, 22). The issue of responsible government was to become heated after the arrival of a new governor in January 1836.<br>
<br>Sir Francis Bond Head had the reputation of a tried reformer. He decided to bring Robert Baldwin into the executive council. Baldwin accepted the offer, albeit reluctantly, being desolate after the recent death of his beloved wife. Joining Baldwin and the three tories on the council were two reformers, John Rolph and J. H. Dunn. On 3&#150;4 March 1836 the entire council drafted and adopted a memorandum arguing that the constitution demanded the establishment of responsible government. Head denied that he needed to consult the council on all matters. Four of the councillors, but not Baldwin and Rolph, were prepared to yield. When the penitents failed to secure the agreement of the recalcitrants, all resigned. Head appointed a new council, including two relatives of the Baldwins, one being William's brother Augustus. The assembly stopped the supplies in protest. Head refused assent to all money bills, dissolved the assembly, and called an election.<br>
<br>William Baldwin, who headed both the newly formed Constitutional Reform Society of Upper Canada and the Toronto Political Union, was one of those Head purged from office, being dismissed as a judge. Neither Baldwin stood in the election that summer, but Robert took his concerns, and those of the reformers generally, to England. A dispatch from Head beseeched Glenelg, the colonial secretary, not to see him. Glenelg, who certainly felt that the old councillors had been wrong to argue that the governor must always consult them, obliged. Consequently, Baldwin set out his understanding of responsible government for the colonial secretary in a missive of 13 July. He did talk to other influential politicians, Lord John Russell, J. A. Roebuck, and Joseph Hume among them, before going to Ireland, and arrived back in Upper Canada in February 1837.<br>
<br>That December Mackenzie and a small group of radicals, dismayed at the smashing victory of the tories in the election of 1836, and spurred on by a revolt in Lower Canada, led a rebellion at Toronto. The Baldwins were not involved, though Head used Robert's good offices to offer the rebels an amnesty. He revoked the offer when reinforcements arrived, leaving Baldwin feeling that his trust had been abused. The insurgents were soon put to flight. Although he was not sympathetic to the rebels, Baldwin later defended several accused insurgents in court.<br>
<br>The British dispatched Lord Durham to investigate the causes of the rebellions in the Canadas and to make recommendations. Reflecting the fact that rebellion, exacerbated by national tensions between French and &#145;English&#146;, had been more serious in Lower Canada, Durham spent most of his time there, but while in Toronto he met both Baldwins, and asked them to put their views in writing. William produced a rather prolix document, enumerating varied grievances and making several recommendations, including the establishment of both an aristocracy and a responsible executive council. Robert sent a copy of his missive to Glenelg of 13 July 1836. Durham's landmark report of January 1839, in which he recommended the establishment of responsible government, echoed the phrases of Robert's letter. However, Durham elaborated on the proposal therein by arguing that the provinces should have control of internal affairs while the imperial government should manage external ones. The report fuelled a widespread reform campaign for responsible government in which both Baldwins were active.<br>
<br>The British government dispatched Charles Poulett Thomson, a prominent whig, to preside over Durham's proposed union of the two Canadas. He arrived in October 1839 and trumpeted the idea of &#145;harmony&#146;, that men of goodwill could make the existing political system work. In February 1840 Robert Baldwin agreed to become solicitor-general of Upper Canada. He declared publicly, but opaquely, that &#145;in accepting the office I consider myself to have given a public pledge that I have reasonably well-grounded confidence that the government of my country is to be carried on in accordance with the principle of responsible government&#146;  (Wilson, 93). It is likely that his decision had been influenced by colonial secretary Lord John Russell's dispatch of 16 October 1839 which declared that the holding of public office was no longer contingent only on good behaviour: officials could be asked to relinquish their posts for reasons of public policy. William Warren Baldwin also chose to view the Russell dispatch as a grant of responsible government.<br>
<br>The Canadian union was proclaimed in February 1841; an election followed. Like many Reformers in Lower Canada, but unlike most in Upper Canada, Robert Baldwin was successful. In June he told the governor-in-chief, who had been elevated to the peerage as Baron Sydenham, that representatives of the French-Canadian Reformers must be added to the council. Sydenham chose to regard Baldwin's insistence as a resignation. The episode left the tories delighted and Sydenham convinced, if his dispatches to Britain can be believed, that Baldwin was an unprincipled scoundrel. The latter worked to forge a province-wide Reform alliance. He had won two seats in the election, and, after choosing one, suggested that Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine, the leader of the French-Canadian Reformers who had been defeated in his riding by chicanery, run in the by-election for the other. LaFontaine agreed, and won the ensuing contest. Sydenham's system was threatened, though he did not live to see it crumble, since he died on 19 September 1841.<br>
<br>Sydenham's replacement, Sir Charles Bagot, a career diplomat, arrived in January 1842. Bagot had been told by the new tory colonial secretary, Lord Stanley, to bring the ablest men into his council. Although Bagot was not anxious to see &#145;radicals&#146; like Robert Baldwin or the French Reformers in office, he recognized reality and brought both LaFontaine and Baldwin into his ministry that September. The new ministers had to face by-elections. Baldwin was defeated&#151;by a cousin. Bagot was not displeased. LaFontaine, however, obligingly found a seat for Baldwin in Lower Canada, which, though he was unable to speak French, he won by acclamation in another by-election. Bagot told Stanley that responsible government now existed in practice, but he persisted in making various appointments personally. LaFontaine persuaded Baldwin not to protest because Bagot was increasingly ill. His deteriorating condition eventually removed him from day-to-day affairs, making Baldwin and LaFontaine, in a practical sense, the first prime ministers of the province.<h2>
<a name="DeathofWilliamBaldwinandthefinalbattlesforresponsiblegovernment"></a>Death of William Baldwin and the final battles for responsible government</h2>In March a new governor, Charles Metcalfe, arrived, carrying instructions from Stanley not to feel himself obliged to accept his ministers' advice in every particular and to control the use of patronage. Baldwin fell out with Metcalfe over the crucial question of patronage as well as the governor's reservation of a bill aimed at the Orange order. On 26 November 1843 all but one of the ministers resigned. Some weeks after, at Toronto on 8 January 1844, William Warren Baldwin died, and was buried in the family cemetery at their country home, Spadina, leaving his son Robert, who pined still for his wife, even more bereft. He was to miss the advice of his father, whom he regarded &#145;as one of the kindest of parents and best of men&#146;  (Wilson, 198). William's strong personality had helped offset the rather drab and wooden public persona of his son. That prop was now taken from Robert, though William had convinced his son that he was destined to bring the country responsible government. A devout Anglican, William felt that God had foreordained it.<br>
<br>The political battle was joined in earnest. Loyal addresses poured in on Metcalfe, as did assurances from Lord Stanley and others that he had been right not to compromise the governor's authority. Nevertheless, Metcalfe's political position became ever more difficult. He was obliged to let his chief minister, William Henry Draper, have free use of patronage to maintain his slim parliamentary majority. The election in November was marred by vitriolic campaigning and violence at the polls; the government maintained a slim majority and Baldwin and LaFontaine were both returned in opposition. Baldwin went on the offensive, endlessly lecturing his opponents on responsible government and on the necessity of Canadians managing their own affairs.<br>
<br>Since he was dying from cancer, Metcalfe returned to Britain in October 1845. Lord Cathcart, commander of the forces in British North America, was appointed, first administrator, then governor-general. Interested in military matters, he let his councillors have a free hand, and once again the government, with Draper still at the head, acted as a responsible party government. Earl Grey, the colonial secretary, suggested to Lieutenant-Governor Harvey of Nova Scotia in a dispatch of 3 November 1846 that the members of his council could expect him to accept their advice. Grey sent Lord Elgin to Canada as governor-in-chief, intimating that he should allow a responsible executive to dispense patronage.<h2>
<a name="TheGreatMinistry"></a>The Great Ministry</h2>The new governor-in-chief arrived in Montreal, the capital of the Canadas, in January 1847. Despite the reconstitution of the ministry that spring, he felt it no longer reflected the will of the people, and he dissolved the assembly on 6 December 1847. The ensuing election saw the Reformers win a majority in both sections of the Canadas, with Baldwin again elected. The Baldwin&#150;LaFontaine government, which came to be known as the &#145;Great Ministry&#146;, took office on 11 March 1848, with Baldwin as attorney-general for Upper Canada. Baldwin and LaFontaine formed the first truly responsible ministry in that they took office and exercised complete authority over internal affairs as a matter of course. Other responsible ministries had existed, but only on sufferance. The establishment of responsible government was inextricably bound up with its recognition.<br>
<br>Baldwin always insisted that the new ministry was LaFontaine's, but he was, in fact, co-premier. The government was exceedingly active legislatively and carried two measures with which Baldwin is particularly identified: a bill providing for the secularization of the University of Toronto, and the <span class="roman">Municipal Corporations Act</span>, which went some distance towards introducing responsible local government to the western half of the province. More controversial was the <span class="roman">Rebellion Losses Bill</span>, which promised to compensate those in Lower Canada who had suffered property losses in the troubles of 1837&#150;8. Opponents of the measure worried that traitors would be rewarded. The bill passed the assembly, with Baldwin speaking briefly on its behalf. Despite his personal doubts, Elgin gave it royal assent on 25 April 1849, signifying for all to see that responsible government was in place, that the ministers, not the crown, controlled policy and legislation. A tory mob roamed Montreal for days, burning the parliament buildings and searching for LaFontaine, Baldwin, and other perceived traitors.<br>
<br>The bill helped persuade the tories of Montreal that they had been deserted by the British government. On 13 October they published a manifesto advocating annexation to the United States. Annexationist sympathy existed too among a group of ultra-Reformers known as the Clear Grits, who sought the introduction of American democratic devices. Baldwin, who, unlike his father, believed that Canada's ties to Britain must be permanent, battled annexationists of whatever stripe, helping extirpate them from office. He annoyed the radicals further when he proved hard to draw out on the vexed clergy reserves issue, which raised the question of state support for organized religion. His retreat on school reform provoked them yet again. On the other hand, he disagreed with Francis Hincks, the inspector-general, who favoured railroads and government involvement in their financing. And he quarrelled with other Reformers such as George Brown of the Toronto <span class="italic">Globe</span>, who took an increasingly intolerant stance with respect to French and Catholic rights. A devout Anglican but no religious bigot, Baldwin had struggled hard to forge a bi-&#145;racial&#146; Reform Party. Symbolically, he had had his four children educated in Catholic, Francophone schools in Quebec. Increasingly tired, ill, and disillusioned, he announced, on 30 June 1851, his retirement as minister after an old adversary, William Lyon Mackenzie, had proposed abolition of the court of chancery, which Baldwin had reformed in 1849. Although it was defeated, Mackenzie's motion had won a majority of votes from Upper Canada. LaFontaine soon followed Baldwin's lead. Baldwin did stand in the ensuing election, but, seen as yesterday's man and harried by Mackenzie, suffered a humiliating defeat.<h2>
<a name="Deathandreputation"></a>Death and reputation</h2>Reclusive and plagued by ill health, Baldwin lived out his days at the estate he had inherited from his parents, obliging his elder daughter to forsake her happiness and look after him. He refused several prime appointments. A weak heart and lung congestion carried him off at Toronto on 9 December 1858. Uxorious to a fault, he had been melancholy and unhappy since the loss of his wife in 1836. He joined her in death, with his coffin chained to hers and his body mutilated in imitation of the scars she bore from her tragic last birth. He was buried initially in the family cemetery at Spadina, on 13 December, but in 1874 was reinterred at St James's cemetery, Toronto.<br>
<br>A cold, reserved public man, Baldwin had not inspired great love or affection. Although he was somewhat taller than average, his hunched posture, paunch, rather lifeless grey eyes, and increasingly bald pate made him physically unprepossessing in later life. This evidently clouded some judgements. The anonymous author of an obituary in the <span class="italic">Upper Canada Law Journal</span> (January 1859, 1) paid him a most modest compliment. Of but moderate talents, he had been &#145;an able and honest politician&#146;. He had been that&#151;and much more. Possibly driven by a desire to measure up to the father he so respected, he rarely stooped and seldom pandered. He knew his objective&#151;responsible government. His genius was that he recognized its efficacy in conferring legitimacy on colonial government and in ensuring the maintenance of the imperial tie. His contribution was that he persevered through much political turmoil and personal anguish.<br>
