<span class="headword">Pritchett,  James Pigott</span>  (1789&#150;1868), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born at St Petrox, Pembrokeshire, on 14 October 1789, and baptized there on 4 January 1790. He was the fourth son of Charles Pigott Pritchett, fellow of King's College, Cambridge, rector of St Petrox and Stackpole Elidor, Pembrokeshire, prebendary of St David's, and domestic chaplain to the earl of Cawdor, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Roger Rogers of Westerton in Ludchurch, Pembrokeshire; Delabere Pritchett, sub-chanter of St David's Cathedral, was his grandfather. He first married, at Beckenham, Kent, on 22 October 1813, Peggy Maria, daughter of Robert Terry, with whom he had three sons and one daughter, Maria Margaret. The latter married John Middleton (1846&#150;1896), her father's pupil. Pritchett was articled to James Medland, an architect in Southwark, and in 1809 he submitted at the Royal Academy a design for a villa. After completing his articles he worked for two years in the office of Daniel Asher Alexander, architect of the London Dock Company. During this time he was engaged on the construction of Maidstone county gaol.<br>
<br>Pritchett set up independently in London in 1812, but in the following year he moved to York, where he entered into partnership with Charles Watson (<i>c</i>.1770&#150;1836). Watson, who had been a pupil, and from 1792 to 1800 a partner, in the Doncaster office of William Lindley, had first set up in practice on his own account in Wakefield about 1800. He was, for a time, the leading architect in Yorkshire, working in a neat Grecian style, as in the court houses in Beverley (1804&#150;14), Wakefield (1807&#150;10), Pontefract (1807&#150;8), and Sheffield (1807&#150;8). With Lindley he designed St John's Church, Wakefield (1791&#150;5), and the square and terrace related to it. In 1807 Watson moved to York, and in 1813 he took Pritchett into partnership. Their first joint major work was the Pauper Lunatic Asylum, Wakefield, which was designed according to the reforming ideas of Samuel Tuke as well as paying attention to heating, air circulation, and fire precautions. In York they built Lendal Chapel and the Friends' meeting-house (both started in 1816); these were neo-classical in style, but the later Ramsden Street Chapel, Huddersfield (1824), marked a change to a Gothic style which they developed in the Nether Chapel, Sheffield (1827), and in the deanery, York, which was designed in the same year. After the death of his first wife, Pritchett married, on 6 January 1829, Caroline, daughter of John Benson, solicitor, of Thorne, near York; they had three sons and two daughters, of whom the eldest son, James Pigott Pritchett (1830&#150;1911), adopted his father's profession at Darlington.<br>
<br>In their public buildings Watson and Pritchett continued to be faithful to a neo-classical taste. In 1828 they completed a new elevation to Lord Burlington's famous assembly rooms in York, and in the same city they built the savings bank in St Helen's Square (1829). By this time Watson was taking less part in the firm's affairs, and the partnership was dissolved in 1831. On his own account, Pritchett designed the cemetery chapel (1836&#150;7) and Salem Chapel (1838&#150;9), both in York and Grecian in style, but he also used a Gothic design for other churches, such as that at Meltham Mills (1845).<br>
<br>Pritchett's most important work is at Huddersfield, where he built one of the great monuments of railway architecture. The station was designed to serve two companies, and it is a symmetrical classical composition in which the central pedimented block contains offices, meeting-rooms, and refreshment rooms, while the flanking wings and pavilions were intended originally to serve the two companies. It is a noble design, bold and sculptural in its massing. It was completed in 1850. Another of his additions to the town is the Lion Arcade (1852&#150;4).<br>
<br>Pritchett had various professional interests. For a while he was architect to the dean and chapter of York Minster, and for fifty years he was surveyor and architect to three successive earls Fitzwilliam at Wentworth Woodhouse. He was a prominent Congregationalist in York and he played an active role in the affairs of the York Cemetery Company. He died at York on 23 May 1868, and was buried in the cemetery there on 27 May. His second wife survived him.<br>
