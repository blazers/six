<span class="headword">Stahl,  Ernest Ludwig</span>  (1902&#150;1992), <span class="occ">German scholar</span>, was born on 10 December 1902 in Senekal, in the Orange River Colony, the son of Philip Stahl, merchant, and his wife, Theresa. His parents had emigrated from Bavaria. He studied at the University of Cape Town (MA, 1925), was encouraged to come to Oxford, graduated from Wadham College with a first in German in 1927, then went to the universities of Heidelberg and Bern, where he wrote a thesis on the intellectual sources of the <span class="italic">Bildungsroman</span>, for which he was awarded his doctorate in 1931. He taught from 1932 to 1935 at the University of Birmingham before returning to Oxford in 1935 as a lecturer in German. That soon meant a wartime programme of thirty tutorial hours a week, which others might have built into a legend of pedagogic stamina but which Stahl characteristically deflated with the assurance that he always allowed himself a leisurely breakfast with the newspapers and never started teaching until ten. On 1 August 1942 he married Kathleen Mary Hudson (1918&#150;1993), Africanist and daughter of John Adamson Hudson, shipping agent; there were no children of the marriage.<br>
<br>In 1945 Stahl was elected a student (that is fellow and tutor) of Christ Church, Oxford, where his quiet sociability and gentle wit made him a popular figure among senior and junior members. There was at the time of his election more to restore than the inward-looking life of a college, and Stahl was one of a group who founded the Michael Foster scholarships to bring young Germans to Oxford at a time when the Rhodes Trust had not yet accepted Germany back into the fold. Stahl's attachment to Christ Church was such that he hesitated before taking in 1959 the university's highest post in his subject, the Taylor professorship of the German language and literature. The move to Queen's College, where the chair was attached, was not a wholly happy one. In ways untypical of Oxford there were persons there who created gratuitous unpleasantness for him. Others, however, showed him kindness, which he later remembered with a legacy to the college's social life. Yet he remained deep down a Christ Church man.<br>
<br>Stahl's tenure of the Taylor chair confirmed his reputation, and in 1966 he was awarded the gold medal of the Goethe Institut, Munich. Goethe, Schiller, H&ouml;lderlin, Kleist, and that whole high eighteenth century period of humane letters were the centre of Stahl's work, with poetry in general and Rilke in particular among the moderns forming a later accompaniment. Stahl's scholarship was not materially massive; his books&#151;<span class="italic">H&ouml;lderlin's Symbolism</span> (1945), <span class="italic">Heinrich von Kleist's Dramas</span> (1948), and <span class="italic">Friedrich Schiller's Drama: Theory and Practice</span> (1954), for example&#151;were compact and lucid. Of his teaching there were unanimously warm memories. He was the least schoolmasterly of teachers, gentle to a fault. His criticisms came in a tentatively voiced &#145;I wonder if you've thought of &hellip;&#146;. In his doctoral seminar he would say, as if seriously locating the rash judgement of a first-year graduate in the history of scholarship, &#145;Some have held that view&#146;. Just occasionally there might be a quiet but firm &#145;No&#146;. The effect was proportionate. But his tolerance was rarely strained to that point. His was a sensitivity that respected others' sensitivities, as well as a modesty that genuinely shrank from obtruding his authority. He would return a draft thesis chapter with ample annotations, but with the spoken reminder that its author could always rub them out.<br>
<br>It was all a lesson in how unassuming distinction could be. Not every academic refrains, in the natural flow of conversation&#151;or perhaps guiding the flow&#151;from telling his interlocutor where in the wider world he has lately been. Stahl's guest professorships, on the other hand, at Cornell, Princeton, and Yale, had to be unearthed in <span class="italic">Who's Who</span>. Likewise he never name-dropped about the poets he knew&#151;W. H. Auden, Dylan Thomas, Louis MacNeice, Stevie Smith. He had been a close friend of MacNeice's since their time as lecturers in Birmingham, and it was through MacNeice that his scholarship had its most considerable public impact, yet paradoxically without much public recognition. For the two-hundredth anniversary of Goethe's birth in 1949 MacNeice was commissioned to write a version of <span class="italic">Faust</span> for the BBC Third Programme. The snag was his lack of German. What more natural than that he and Stahl should do it together? So in London and in a cottage in Provence Stahl &#145;plied Louis with synonyms and antonyms and with as many quotations and allusions as I could, however inadequately, muster, until he found what he considered the appropriate version or its near equivalent&#146;  (&#145;The &#147;Faust&#148; translation&#146;, 67&#150;8). The &#145;however inadequately&#146; is characteristic. With similar modesty Stahl turned MacNeice's deficiency into the advantage of a poetic empathy that could go its own way, &#145;freed, as he was, from the inhibitions of bilingual knowledge&#146;  (ibid., 68). Stahl's name, to his disappointment, did not figure alongside the poet's on the title-page of the book, apparently a decision of T. S. Eliot's as a director of Faber and Faber. Nevertheless MacNeice dedicated the book &#145;to my great friend E. L. Stahl who went through the German text with me line by line and without whom I should never have started, let alone ended, this translation&#146;.<br>
<br>Having lived latterly at 43 Plantation Road, Oxford, Stahl died on 14 September 1992 at the Churchill Hospital, Oxford, of cerebrovascular ischaemia.<br>
