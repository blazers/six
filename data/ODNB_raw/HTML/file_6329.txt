<span class="headword">Cornewall,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1698, <em>d.</em> 1744), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was baptized on 17 November 1698 at Moccas, Herefordshire, the fourth son of Colonel Henry Cornewall (<i>d</i>. 1717) of Bradwardine, near Hereford, and the second son with his second wife, Susanna, daughter and coheir of Sir John Williams, second baronet, of Elham, Kent. James's half-brother and brother, Henry and Velters Cornewall, were MPs for Hereford and Herefordshire respectively, while his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6327/', "Vice-Admiral Charles Cornwall (formerly Cornewall)")</script> came to prominence for his role in the victory off Cape Passaro in July 1718.<br>
<br>Cornewall appears to have begun his career as a volunteer per order in the <i>Chatham</i> in March 1721, moving in the same rate to the <i>Torbay</i> in December of that year  (TNA: PRO, ADM 6/477, pp. 326, 415). On 3 April 1724 he was promoted captain of the frigate <i>Sheerness</i>, in which for the next four years he was employed on the North American coast, principally at Boston, in protecting legitimate trade from piracy. He returned to England in August 1728 and two years later stood unsuccessfully as the parliamentary candidate for Weobley, Herefordshire. He was subsequently returned for that seat in April 1732 and held it until 1734. In December 1732 he was appointed to the frigate <i>Greyhound</i>. During the following summer he was employed in her on the Moroccan coast where, during 1733, he established friendly relations with the Sal&eacute; corsairs and the bashaw of Tetuan. In the following March he returned to England and three months later he took command of the <i>Deptford</i> (50 guns) which served in the channel and along the Portuguese coast with Sir John Norris.<br>
<br>Early in 1737 Cornewall commissioned the <i>Greenwich</i>, in which he oversaw the regulation of trade on the west African coast. Rumours surfaced that he had carried slaves to Barbados, though this charge was not substantiated and led to nothing more than a caution addressed to his successor, George Anson. In March of that year he had been returned as MP for Weobley on petition; seldom in the house, he voted (for the administration) in only two divisions and did not contest his seat at the 1741 election. In 1739 he had been appointed to the <i>St Albans</i> (50 guns), in which between September and October, with the company of the <i>Weymouth</i>, he cruised off the Azores in quest of homeward-bound Spanish ships. Plans to send Cornewall on to the China seas and western Pacific to co-operate with Anson's squadron in the eastern Pacific came to nothing on account of the strain of the West Indian expedition. In 1741 he was appointed to the <i>Bedford</i> in which, a year later, he accompanied Vice-Admiral Thomas Mathews to the Mediterranean.<br>
<br>Cornewall was transferred to the <i>Marlborough</i> (90 guns) in 1743 and supported the <i>Namur</i> (Mathews's flagship) during its engagement with the Spanish flagship, <i>San Felipe</i>, and her seconds at the battle of Toulon (11 February 1744). The <i>Marlborough</i> and <i>Namur</i> bore the brunt of the encounter, the <i>Namur</i> being dismasted while the <i>Marlborough</i> was reduced to a wreck. The ship suffered heavy casualties (43 killed and 120 wounded) including Cornewall who died, unmarried, after his legs had been shot away, an injury which left him with life only &#145;to express the agony he was in, by shaking his head at the surgeon&#146;  (<span class="italic">Narrative of the Proceedings of his Majesty's Fleet in the Mediterranean</span>, 1744, 89). Writing in June 1747, Horace Walpole commented how &#145;in the present dearth of glory&#146; Cornewall &#145;is canonized, though poor man! he had been tried twice the year before for cowardice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 37.271). In the same year parliament voted to commemorate his actions with a 36 foot monument for Westminster Abbey, designed by Sir Robert Taylor and completed in 1755. Cornewall's cousin, Frederick Cornewall, then first lieutenant of the <i>Marlborough</i>, assumed command after Cornewall's death until he too was severely wounded. He later commanded the <i>Revenge</i> in the action off Minorca in 1756 and died in 1786.<br>
