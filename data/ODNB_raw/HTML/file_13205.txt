<span class="headword">Hickes,  Francis</span>  (1565/6&#150;1631), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was probably born in Shipston, Worcestershire, the son of Richard Hickes (<i>d</i>. 1621) and Anne Ingram. His father was appointed the queen's arrasmaker in 1569  (<span class="italic">CPR, 1566&#150;9</span>, no. 2573; TNA: PRO, LC 5/49, fols. 317&#150;19) and may have come to England as a Flemish &eacute;migr;&eacute;. In 1575 Francis was appointed in survivorship with his father in a renewed grant of the office of arrasmaker, with responsibility to supervise the maintenance of the monarch's tapestries  (<span class="italic">CPR, 1572&#150;5</span>, no. 3268; TNA: PRO, LC 5/49, fols. 317&#150;19). Hickes matriculated at St Mary Hall, Oxford, on 27 March 1579, aged thirteen, and graduated BA on 30 April 1583. After graduation he appears to have spent most of his life in Barcheston, Warwickshire, and Shipston, where he devoted himself to translations from Greek into English. Probably about 1593 he married Elizabeth Munday, daughter of Thomas Munday, of Bagshot, Surrey; they had four children. Elizabeth died in 1616 and was buried at Barcheston on 25 May.<br>
<br>None of Hickes's works was published during his lifetime, but in 1634 his <span class="italic">Certain Select Dialogues of Lucian, together with his True History</span> was published in Oxford, with additions by his son <a href="#cosubject_13205">Thomas [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Thomas described his father as &#145;no profest scoller&#146; but &#145;a true lover of Schollers, and Learning&#146;, whose translations were &#145;[h]is studie or rather his recreation&#146;  (Hickes and Hickes, sig. A3<i>r</i>). Two more translations from Greek are extant in manuscript: &#145;The history of the wars of Peloponnesus, in 8 books, written by Thucydides the Athenian&#146; and &#145;The history of Herodian, beginning from the reign of the emperor Marcus&#146;. These manuscripts were presented to the library of Christ Church, Oxford, by Thomas Hickes, and are still held among the library's collections.<br>
<br>Hickes is said by Wood to have died in a kinsman's house at Sutton in Gloucestershire on 9 January 1631, and to have been buried in the chancel of the parish church at Brailes, Worcestershire  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.491). There is, however, no reference to his burial in the Brailes parish registers, and no will survives.<br>
<br>Wood writes that Hickes's son <a name="cosubject_13205"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Hickes</span>  (1598/9&#150;1634)<span class="occ"></span> was born in Shipston in the parish of Tredington in Worcestershire  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.584), but there is no record of his birth in the Tredington or Shipston parish registers. Thomas matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, on 13 December 1616, aged seventeen, and took his BA on 11 May 1620 and his MA on 23 January 1623. In 1630 he became a chaplain at Christ Church, Oxford, an appointment attributed by Wood to the patronage of Brian Duppa, then dean of Christ Church and vice-chancellor of Oxford University  (ibid.). Hickes's edition of his father's translation of Lucian is dedicated to Duppa, with the assurance that Hickes is &#145;so farre indebted to your favours, that my thankfulnesse cannot willingly omit the occasion of expressing itself&#146;  (sig. A2<i>r</i>). As well as the dialogues translated by Francis, this volume includes Thomas's <span class="italic">Life of Lucian, Gathered out of his Own Writings</span>, and his notes on his father's translations. In his letter &#145;To the honest and judicious reader&#146; Hickes hints at plans to publish more of his father's works &#145;to propagate his owne memorie, which may chance to last longer in this small monument of his owne raising (or in some larger hereafter) than in the hardest marble posteritie can erect him&#146;  (sig. A3<i>v</i>). His own notes to the dialogues, which testify to an extensive knowledge of Greek literature, are justified as an attempt to make his father's translations comprehensible even to &#145;the meanest capacities &hellip; otherwise, the English, would be to many, almost as much Greeke as the Originall&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Wood records that in addition to his proficiency in Greek, Thomas Hickes had a reputation as a good poet and an excellent limner  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.584); he contributed Latin verses to the Oxford volume, <span class="italic">Camdeni insignia</span> (1624). Thomas Hickes died, unmarried, at Christ Church on 16 December 1634, and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral. No monument to him survives.<br>
