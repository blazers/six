<span class="headword">Powell, Sir  Richard Douglas</span>, first baronet  (1842&#150;1925), <span class="occ">physician</span>, born at Walthamstow on 25 September 1842, was the second but only surviving son of Captain Scott Powell of the 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers, and his wife, Eliza, daughter of Richard Meeke. Much of his boyhood was spent at Toft, near Cambridge, and there he laid the foundations of the interest in natural history and sport (fishing and shooting) which were the chief relaxations of his later life. Educated privately at Streatham he gave up his wish to follow his father's profession, entered University College, London, and continued his course at University College Hospital, becoming physician's assistant to Sir William Jenner, to whom he owed much in his early professional career. He graduated MB in 1865 and qualified for the gold medal at the MD (1866) examinations.<br>
<br>Powell was appointed in 1867 to take temporary charge of out-patients, and in 1869 he applied unsuccessfully for a vacancy as assistant physician at University College Hospital. Two years later (1871) he was elected assistant physician and lecturer on materia medica to Charing Cross Hospital. He resigned both posts in 1878 on being appointed assistant physician to the Middlesex Hospital, becoming physician in 1880 and consulting physician in 1900. Thus for nearly thirty years he taught medical students, being a stimulus to the thoughtful rather than a source of dogmatic answers for those interested only in satisfying examiners. As resident clinical assistant, assistant physician (1868), physician (1875), and consulting physician (1889) he was attached to the Brompton Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest, and was much in demand as a consultant in thoracic disease. For thirty-eight years he was connected with the court, being appointed in 1887 physician-extraordinary in the place of Wilson Fox, and in 1899 physician-in-ordinary to Queen Victoria, whom he attended in her last illness (1901); he continued to serve in the latter capacity Edward VII and George V.<br>
<br>A hard worker, Powell's published writings extended over a period of fifty-six years and included articles on diseases of the chest contributed to Russell Reynolds's <span class="italic">System of Medicine</span> (1879), and to the two later editions (1898&#150;9 and 1909). His chief work was <span class="italic">On the Principal Varieties of Pulmonary Tuberculosis with Practical Comments</span> (1872) which went through six editions up to 1921. His Lumleian lectures, delivered in 1898 at the Royal College of Physicians of London, appeared as <span class="italic">The Principles which Govern Treatment in Diseases and Disorders of the Heart</span> (1899).<br>
<br>In the medical life of London, Powell was continuously at work from the time when he was a junior at the Pathological Society, of which he was secretary (1877&#150;9). Later he was successively president of the Medical Society of London (1891), the Clinical Society of London (1899&#150;1901), and the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society (1904&#150;6), and he was active in the arrangements for amalgamating seventeen metropolitan medical societies into the Royal Society of Medicine (1907). Powell also lent his help to the formation, initiated by Sir William Osler, of the Association of Physicians of Great Britain and Ireland, and was its first president (1907). At the Royal College of Physicians of London he became a member (1867) and a fellow (1873), held several offices, was president (1905&#150;10), and delivered the Harveian oration in 1914. He was deputy chairman (1899&#150;1925) of the Clerical, Medical, and General Life Assurance Society, and in 1896 was president of the Life Assurance Medical Officers' Association. He was closely connected with the Conservative and Unionist Association of the University of London for more than thirty years, and was its president 1909&#150;19. He was created a baronet in 1897 and KCVO in 1901, and received several honorary degrees from English, Scottish, and Irish universities.<br>
<br>Powell was a striking personality. Tall, slight, with an ascetic, clean-shaven, pale face, charming in manner and voice, reticent, correct, cautious, dignified, and kindly, he was widely recognized as an impressive leader. He married twice: first, on 30 October 1873, Juliet (<i>d</i>. 1909), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2125/', "Sir John Bennett")</script>, sheriff of London and Middlesex, with whom he had three sons and two daughters; second, on 16 October 1917, Edith Mary Burke (<i>d</i>. 1935), younger daughter of Henry Wood, of 10 Cleveland Square, Hyde Park, London, where they afterwards lived. He died there after a short illness on 15 December 1925, contributions from his pen to the medical press appearing three days before and two weeks after his death. He was succeeded as second baronet by his eldest son, Douglas (1874&#150;1932), brevet lieutenant-colonel, Royal Welch Fusiliers. The second son was killed in the South African War, the third in the First World War.<br>
