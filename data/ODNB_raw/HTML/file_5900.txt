<span class="headword">Colfe,  Abraham</span>  (1580&#150;1657), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and benefactor</span>, was born in Canterbury on 7 August 1580, the eldest son of Richard Colfe (<i>d</i>. 1613), a Church of England clergyman, and his first wife, whose maiden name was Thorneton; he was a nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5901/', "Isaac Colfe")</script>. After early education at Canterbury Cathedral grammar school, Abraham Colfe matriculated at Oxford from Christ Church in November 1594 and graduated BA in October 1599.<br>
<br>Colfe was still in residence at Christ Church when, in April 1601, &#145;publicly in hall&#146; he made what the vice-chancellor, George Abbot, and the dean, Thomas Ravis, described as a &#145;very offensive&#146; outburst, passionately commending the earl of Essex as a great general, &#145;Veri Dux&#146;, and &#145;Pater Patriae&#146;, whose very virtue had been the cause of his overthrow  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1601&#150;3</i>, 35). A month later he wrote a supplicatory letter to Secretary Robert Cecil from Newgate prison, offering an eloquent if disingenuous explanation of his conduct. Likening himself to Icarus, &#145;indiscreetly&#146; flying too near Essex, who &#145;shine[d] like the sun in his height&#146;, he had intended to praise his virtues, &#145;and darkly to point at his death under the history of Cicero&#146;, but not, as a loyal subject, to challenge his condemnation  (ibid., 44).<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Colfe must have transferred to Cambridge to resume his studies for he obtained his MA from Trinity College there in 1603, the year in which he was ordained. Although there is no university record of further degrees, he was later described as having a DD. He was curate of Lewisham, Kent, from 1604 to May 1610, when he succeeded Hadrian Saravia in the vicarage. Three months earlier, having obtained a dispensation for pluralism, he had also become rector of St Leonard Eastcheap, London, but he continued to live in Lewisham; about this time he married Margaret Valentine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hollard (<i>c</i>.1566&#150;1644), the widow of a local tanner, whose family connections, especially with the Leathersellers' Company, were to become important to him.<br>
<br>Identifying himself with the interests of his Lewisham parishioners, whom in 1614 and 1615 he helped to a successful defence of their rights over Westwood Common, Colfe only occasionally officiated in person in his London parish, but his preaching was apparently well received by the pious in that congregation. Feeling that &#145;a minister should labour earnestly &hellip; to stir up all professed Christians&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hasted's History</span>, 1.258n.), Colfe, on the evidence of his will, took preaching very seriously, usually delivering two sermons on Sundays and, for the last twenty years of his life, expounding the <span class="roman">Bible</span> on Wednesdays, Fridays, and holy days. He was one of the earliest members of Sion College, and was a benefactor of the library. As early as 1626 he determined to buy land to found and endow charitable institutions, and in 1634 proposed to convey land from the manor of Sydenham to the Leathersellers' Company for pious uses.<br>
<br>Relations with some inhabitants of Lewisham were soured during 1642 and 1643 when Colfe and others resisted parliamentary orders to admit John Batchelor, soon to be notorious for licensing sectarian books, as a weekly lecturer at Lewisham. Colfe complained that &#145;at the instigation of their impudent lecturer&#146;  (Black, xxiv) the parishioners tried to turn him out of the living by proceeding against him before the committee of plundered ministers, but in the event he remained in place until his death, although he lost his London living to Henry Roborough in 1647.<br>
<br>Continuing the charitable impulses shared by his wife, whose funeral monument erected in Lewisham church after her death in 1644 celebrates her &#145;having bene above 40 yeares a willing nurse, midwife, surgeon and in part physition to all both rich and poor, without excepting reward&#146;, in 1652 Colfe founded and opened a free grammar school in the town. As his will of 7 September 1656 explained, it was intended for thirty-one boys drawn from the Blackheath hundred; the trustee was not, &#145;as he shall answer for it at the Judgement seat of Jesus Christ&#146;, to admit the sons of the wealthy, and there were very strict limits on the extent of corporal punishment  (<span class="italic">Hasted's History</span>, 1.258n.). He died on 5 December 1657 in Lewisham, leaving no children of his own but having had a good relationship with his stepsons, whom he had assisted during his life. He was buried in Lewisham church. Charitable bequests dominated his will, with money left for &#145;30 or 40&#146; chained bibles for the use of strangers and parishioners, and a library of books left to the school. In 1662 his trustees built almshouses in Lewisham in accordance with his instructions, and in 1664 the ownership and governorship of his various charitable institutions were vested by act of parliament in the Leathersellers' Company.<br>
