<span class="headword">Falconer,  William</span>  (1744&#150;1824), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in Chester on 23 February 1744, the younger of two surviving sons of William Falconer of the Inner Temple, recorder of Chester, and his wife and second cousin, Elizabeth, daughter of Randle Wilbraham of Townsend near Nantwich, Cheshire. After graduating MD from Edinburgh in 1766 he attended the lectures of Gaubius and Albinus at Leiden and gained a second MD on 22 May 1767. He had become an extra-licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians on 12 March 1767 and in the same year was appointed physician to the Chester Infirmary. Falconer established a good practice in the town. In January 1770, however, at the suggestion of the Quaker physician John Fothergill, he moved to Bath where he lived briefly in Duke Street and then at 29 The Circus. On 18 March 1773 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and on 12 May 1784 he was appointed physician of the Bath General Hospital, a post which he retained until 10 February 1819. Falconer married Henrietta (1739&#150;1803), daughter of Thomas Edmunds of Worsbrough Hall in Yorkshire. Their only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9115/', "Thomas Falconer (1771&#150;1839)")</script>, took holy orders and gained the degrees of MB and MD; Thomas's fifth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9113/', "Randle Wilbraham Falconer (1816&#150;1881)")</script>, followed in his grandfather's footsteps by becoming a physician to the general hospital.<br>
<br>Though greatly esteemed, William Falconer was not a popular man. As the nineteenth-century commentator, R. E. M. Peach, observed: &#145;He was too proud and too independent to stoop to the arts of his profession &hellip; [and] had a peculiar <i>brusqueness</i> of manner, which has been sometimes referred to as the <i>Falconer</i> <i>temper</i>&#146;  (Peach, 101). Despite this abrasive personality Falconer ran a successful spa practice, counting among his patients the duke of Portland, Lord Chancellor Thurlowe, William Pitt, and Horatio Nelson. A cultivated man, Falconer engaged in the activities of the Bath and West of England Society and the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society. He was also a prolific writer who published over forty books as well as numerous papers. These works ranged over topics in the classics, theology, and natural history, but medicine featured most prominently, including studies of plague, influenza, and fever, the antiseptic qualities of fixed air or carbon dioxide, and the implications of climate, diet, and lifestyle for health. <span class="italic">A Dissertation on the Influence of the Passions upon Disorders of the Body</span> (1788) won the Fothergill gold medal of the Medical Society of London in 1796. However, William Falconer was most famous for his research into the Bath waters and their impact on chronic conditions, notably rheumatism, gout, and ischias, or the hip case. The Medical Society of London awarded its silver medal to him for an essay on this last subject in 1805.<br>
<br>In investigating the efficacy of the spa, William Falconer made an important contribution to later Georgian medical quantification, which contests the view that clinical statistics only emerged at the Paris hospitals after the French Revolution. Building on the mortality and morbidity ratios which James Jurin had constructed to evaluate smallpox inoculation, Falconer was an &#145;arithmetic observationist clinician&#146; who recognized that numerical analysis had to accompany simple counting if patient records were to yield their full potential  (Tr&ouml;hler, 62&#150;4). His training at the progressive Edinburgh medical school under William Cullen primed him for this role and brought him into contact with a group of students&#151;including Thomas Percival and John Haygarth&#151;who were to become pioneers of a social medicine which used statistical comparisons to tackle problems of urban public health. Like Falconer, Haygarth joined the staff of the Chester Infirmary in the late 1760s, and his subsequent control of its fever wards received widespread acclaim. Falconer, however, applied his Edinburgh education to the evaluation of balneology after his transfer to Bath in 1770.<br>
<br>Falconer was the latest in a line of medical practitioners to subject the springs to scientific enquiry. Election to the Bath Hospital, while not inducing regular attendance at its weekly management committee, did enable him to follow the example of predecessors like William Oliver and Rice Charleton, and use the patient records for research purposes. This was the source for his most sophisticated project, <span class="italic">An Account of the Use, Application and Success of the Bath Waters in Rheumatic Cases</span> (1795). More than 400 patients with rheumatism, admitted to the hospital between 1785 and 1793, were divided into five categories according to their state of health when discharged. One-third were described as &#145;cured&#146;, almost four out of ten as &#145;much better&#146;, and 15 per cent as &#145;better&#146;. Therefore, Falconer concluded that the spa was beneficial. Furthermore, by adjusting for the sex ratio, and projecting a success rate for men from the rate achieved by women, he was able to suggest that male patients responded more effectively to treatment.<br>
<br>The roots of Falconer's statistical methodologies in Edinburgh medicine linked him to the religious and political radicalism which informed this intellectual culture. Though pious and an &#145;earnest reformer&#146;, however, he was neither a dissenter nor a committed whig, believing that the party &#145;cared less for reform than they did for office&#146;  (Peach, 102). Support for Edmund Burke's early reaction against the French Revolution encouraged him to respond with what Burke himself praised as a &#145;temperate, judicious, and reasonable paper&#146;  (Peach, 102). Moreover, Falconer joined with his conservative medical colleagues in 1792 to resist a campaign to relocate the general hospital which was articulated through the new language of social medicine.<br>
<br>Falconer died at his house in The Circus on 31 August 1824. He was buried at Weston, outside Bath. A contemporary chronicler compared &#145;his general manner, and sententious, pithy observations &hellip; to the style and address of Dr Samuel Johnson. Science and learning &hellip; [were] indebted to his pen&#146;  (Mainwaring, 260).<br>
