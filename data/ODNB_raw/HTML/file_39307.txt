<span class="headword">Davenport,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1584, <em>d.</em> 1655), <span class="occ">landowner and diarist</span>, was baptized in Stockport, Cheshire, on 25 March 1584, the son and heir of Sir William Davenport (1563&#150;1627) of Bramhall and Dorothy Warren (<i>fl</i>. 1566?&#150;1615), the daughter of a neighbouring gentleman. William Davenport is an especially well-documented example of someone who refused to take sides in the English civil war and who suffered for it. He was the head of a cadet line of a cadet branch of a Domesday family, a one-manor gentry family with an income of perhaps &pound;400 p.a. in the 1630s, in the top fifty but not the top thirty families in Cheshire. His ancestors in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries had been chief foresters of the royal forest of Macclesfield, and his family served continuously from the first Cheshire commission of the peace in 1543 to the death of his father in 1627. Sir William had rebuilt the family home&#151;Bramall Hall&#151;at the turn of the sixteenth century as a magnificent timber-framed mansion&#151;a &#145;fair house and a park and all things fit for a worshipful seat&#146;  (W. Webb, <span class="italic">Perambulation</span>, 1656, 70). The marriage of his daughters to mere merchants suggests that Sir William may have overextended himself in this rebuilding.<br>
<br>Davenport himself married twice into families higher in the Cheshire rank order of wealth and status than himself; first, in 1599, he married Frances (<i>d</i>. 1620), daughter of Thomas Wilbraham of Woodhey, and second, in 1637, he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1653), daughter of Thomas Legh of Adlington. His father's brother Humphrey was&#151;as chief baron of the court of exchequer&#151;at the centre of legal controversy in the 1630s; his mother's brother was a Jesuit but his own religion seems to have been staunchly conformist Anglican. His younger brother Humphrey was killed in the duke of Buckingham's failed &Icirc;le de R&eacute; expedition in counter-productive support of the French Huguenots in 1627; he was a country squire with intriguing connections.<br>
<br>Between 1613 and 1650 Davenport kept one of the most interesting of all gentry commonplace books. The first half covers events at court, at Whitehall, and at Westminster, and contains accounts of the failure of English arms abroad down to 1641. It then becomes a chronicle of Davenport's experiences during the lead up to, and through, the civil wars. The first half demonstrates just how much information about matters of public concernment was circulated in manuscript by the 1610s and 1620s; it ranges from scabrous accounts of the divorce of the earl and countess of Essex and the ensuing Overbury scandal (1612&#150;15), and of the earl of Castlehaven's trial for sodomy (1631), to copies of the speeches of all eight managers in the impeachment of the duke of Buckingham (1626), a speech allegedly made by Archbishop Abbott in council against a greater tolerance of Catholic practice (1623), and details of the marriage negotiations (1622&#150;3) between the then Prince Charles and the Spanish court for the hand of the Spanish infanta. Disapproval of royal fiscal policy, of a bungled royal foreign policy, and of corruption at court did not make this unpuritan man a parliamentarian in the civil war. But conventional Anglican piety and a distaste for local sectarian activity did not make him a royalist either.<br>
<br>After 1640 Davenport's book changes and becomes an account of his own experiences. It records the petition&#151;humble in tone, determined in purpose&#151;presented to him by a group of his tenants on 17 September 1642. It explains why, despite his own misgivings, they felt bound in conscience to enlist as soldiers in a parliamentarian regiment being raised by a neighbouring gentleman. It records his decision to remain neutral and to obey all lawful commands (which he took to mean warrants in due form from both sides) and it lays out the various contributions that he made to royalist and parliamentarian commanders. It also records various raids and the pillaging of his house by both sides, and his formal protests (for instance, when he was forced by a file of parliamentarian soldiers to dismount, hand over his horse, and walk home; a subsequent strong protest to their gentleman-captain brought an apology and the return of the horse). His even-handedness did not prevent a local committee from confiscating his estate on account of the assistance he had given to the royalists, and he then fell foul of an internal feud within the parliamentarian bureaucracy; he had to pay fines totalling &pound;995 to two different bodies (the local sequestration committee and the committee for compounding with delinquents in London). Davenport demonstrates that an unwillingness to take sides in the civil war and a willingness to obey whoever was in power in his area was no guarantee of a quiet life. He was buried at the parish church, Stockport, on 24 May 1655.<br>
