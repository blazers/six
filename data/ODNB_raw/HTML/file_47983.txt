<span class="headword">Williams, Sir  Evan</span>, baronet  (1871&#150;1959), <span class="occ">coal owner and employers' representative</span>, was born at Llwynhendy, Pontarddulais, Carmarthenshire, on 2 July 1871, the elder son of Thomas Williams, coal owner, of Llwyn Gwern, Pontarddulais, and his wife, Mary Williams (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Harry). Like D. A. Thomas, but unusually for Welsh coal owners of the time, Evan Williams followed an upper-class pattern of education, from public school (at Christ College, Brecon) to ancient university (at Clare College, Cambridge). In September 1903 he married Charlotte Mary (1877&#150;1961), the youngest daughter of David Lackie, coal owner, Montrose. There were no children. Williams was created a baronet in 1935: the title lapsed on his death.<br>
<br>There is an apparent paradox in Williams's career: the family was, and remained, relatively minor coal owners away from the (then) centres of activity in the south Wales coalfield; yet Williams was the major figure on the employers' side for a quarter century during which coal dominated British industry. Perhaps as a small, unthreatening coal owner himself he could bridge the endemic divisions within coal owners' associations at both district and national levels. At all events he was chairman of the Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners' Association in 1913, president of its crucial conciliation board from 1918 to 1944, and, finally, was president of the Mining Association of Great Britain (MAGB) from 1919 to 1944.<br>
<br>The last-named position was both central and exceptional. It was central because industrial relations in the coal industry were a significant determinant of both economic and political developments in the years between the wars; it was exceptional because before 1919 the presidency of the MAGB had always been a temporary, honorary post, and the MAGB itself had played a very limited role in representing the industry on (mostly) legislative matters. The change was induced by the extent of public acceptance of the condemnation of the coal owners embodied in the evidence to the Sankey commission in 1919. As president at the time (the youngest the MAGB had ever had) Williams played a crucial role in securing the reorganization necessary to meet the crisis: the MAGB acquired full-time staff and four standing committees, which significantly included one for &#145;propaganda&#146;. In 1920 Williams reported that they had put &#145;nationalisation to sleep&#146;  (Supple, <span class="italic">History</span>, 57); in 1921 a national strike was successfully weathered, and Williams was informally established as a more or less permanent president.<br>
<br>Throughout the inter-war years Williams sang from just two hymn-sheets: no national settlements, especially on wages, for the coal industry; and&#151;even more vehemently&#151;no interference (by state, miners, or anyone else) with the sole prerogative of the owners to manage the collieries. He never tired of the performance and, if the messages were short, their delivery was protracted. Most famously, in the dying days of the 1926 stoppage, when Winston Churchill threatened government action if the coal owners did not carry out an earlier indication to accept an element of settling by national negotiation, Williams insisted on the pure milk of district agreements. The meeting between Churchill and Williams was acrimonious and prolonged (the verbatim account covered 56 foolscap sheets). Churchill had to give way, reflecting not their relative debating skills, but Williams's awareness of two realities: the miners were then beyond resistance and (as the newspapers put it) &#145;is it conceivable that a conservative Government will coerce the owners, however foolish, and the assumption is, No.&#146;  (Jones, 80). Williams could also recognize when reality changed: in 1943, towards the end of his long reign, he bluntly warned the south Wales coal owners that &#145;the industry could not revert to the old state whereby &#147;we are the masters and they are the men&#148;&#146;  (Supple, <span class="italic">History</span>, 580).<br>
<br>Williams the man remains elusive. It is curious and puzzling that one who held such key positions in a key industry during a crucial period attracted so little specific attention. There was no biography and he left no memoirs or personal papers. The <span class="italic">Western Mail</span>, traditionally the coal owners' paper, carried no obituary. Too significant entirely to disappear, he has only a flickering existence in the indexes and footnotes of many of the mountain of books covering this period and this industry. Thomas Jones's early judgement of him as &#145;an insignificant little man&#146;  (Jones, 12) is as implausible as the claim in the <span class="italic">Times</span> obituary that he had the &#145;secret goodwill&#146; of the miners  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Feb 1959). It rings truer that he was &#145;ever-polite and courteous&#146; but that he was inflexible in views which &#145;he held with a singular tenacity and unfailingly expressed with precision and in exactly formulated phrases&#146;  (Page Arnot, 46).<br>
<br>Besides other positions that Williams held in the coal industry (for example as chairman from 1930 to 1938 of the central council under the 1930 <span class="roman">Coal Mines Act</span>) and in industry in general (as president in 1925&#150;6 of the National Confederation of Employers' Organisations) he was also a JP and, in 1922&#150;3, high sheriff of Carmarthenshire. He was a knight of the order of St John of Jerusalem and seneschal of its priory for Wales, and he was awarded an honorary LLD from the University of Birmingham. His clubs were the Carlton and the Oxford and Cambridge, and his home was Glynd&#373;r at Pontarddulais, Carmarthenshire. He died at the Santa Maria Nursing Home in Swansea on 3 February 1959. His wife, who died two years later, is buried beside him at Hendy Chapel.<br>
