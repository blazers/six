<span class="headword">Marsden,  John Howard</span>  (1803&#150;1891), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, eldest son of William Marsden, curate of St George's Chapel, Wigan, and afterwards vicar of Eccles, was born at Wigan on 7 May 1803 and was admitted on 6 August 1817 into Manchester grammar school, where he was head scholar in 1822. He was an exhibitioner from the school to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was elected a scholar in 1822 on the Somerset foundation. In 1823 he won the Bell university scholarship. He graduated BA in 1826 and proceeded MA in 1829 and BD in 1836. In 1829 he gained the Seatonian prize, the subject of the prize poem being &#145;The Finding of Moses&#146; (2nd edn, 1830). He was select preacher to the university in 1834, 1837, and 1847; was Hulsean lecturer on divinity in 1843 and 1844; and was from 1851 to 1865 the first Disney professor of archaeology, with the sole duty of giving one lecture a year. He published his first two lectures in 1852.<br>
<br>In 1840 he married Caroline, elder daughter of William Moore, prebendary of Lincoln, and in the same year he was presented by his college to the rectory of Great Oakley, Essex, which he held until 1889, when he resigned it on account of old age. He also held for some years the rural deanery of Harwich. Having been elected canon residentiary of Manchester in 1858, he became rural dean of the deanery of Eccles, and he was one of the chaplains of James Prince Lee, first bishop of Manchester. Marsden died at his residence, Grey Friars, Colchester, on 24 January 1891, a very wealthy man.<br>
<br>Marsden published various sermons and works on a wider range of other subjects. His first work was <span class="italic">The Sacred Tree: a Tale of Hindostan</span> (1840). He then published on Sir Thomas More's <span class="italic">Philomorus</span> (1842) and in 1844 and 1845 published his own Hulsean lectures. He wrote a history of the Gentlemen's Society at Spalding (1849) and <span class="italic">College Life in the Reign of James I</span> (1851), derived from the autobiography of Sir Symonds D'Ewes. His article on classical works at Felix Hall appeared in <span class="italic">Transactions of the Essex Archaeological Society</span> (1863), and he concluded with a memoir of William Martin Leake (1864) and <span class="italic">Fasciculus</span> (1869), a collection of comic verses.<br>
