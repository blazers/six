<span class="headword">Lapworth,  Arthur</span>  (1872&#150;1941), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 10 October 1872 in Galashiels, Selkirkshire, the elder son in the family of two sons and one daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37655/', "Charles Lapworth (1842&#150;1920)")</script>, professor of geology at the University of Birmingham, and his wife, Janet, daughter of Walter Sanderson of Galashiels. He went to school in St Andrews and to King Edward VI's School, Birmingham, and graduated in 1893 from Mason College, Birmingham. He then studied chemistry at the City and Guilds Central Technical College under F. S. Kipping, who became his friend. His studies laid the foundations for his later researches on camphor and the mechanism of aromatic substitution. He took a DSc at London University in 1895.<br>
<br>Lapworth's academic career began as lecturer in chemistry at the School of Pharmacy in Bloomsbury; in 1900 he moved to the Goldsmiths' Company's institute at New Cross as head of the chemistry department. In the same year he married, in Bridgwater, Somerset, Kathleen Florence, youngest daughter of William Thomas Holland JP. There were no children. Kathleen's two elder sisters married the chemists F. S. Kipping and W. H. Perkin respectively. In 1909 he was appointed senior lecturer in inorganic and physical chemistry at the University of Manchester, where he succeeded W. H. Perkin as professor of organic chemistry in 1913 and became Sir Samuel Hall professor of inorganic and physical chemistry and director of the laboratories in 1922, appointments which show his remarkable versatility.<br>
<br>At Manchester, Lapworth studied the molecular constitution of camphor and its derivatives; his researches suggested new interpretations of organic reaction mechanisms employing the migration of double bonds within organic molecules, and the formation of organic ions and chemical equilibria. His ideas were eagerly taken up by his assistant, Robert Robinson, who made use of them in developing his own electronic theories. The two men remained friends until Lapworth's death. Lapworth discovered new reactions and introduced improved preparative techniques. His classification of organic reagents as &#145;anionic&#146; and &#145;cationic&#146; paved the way for the electronic theory of organic reactions, but as the electronic formulations of C. K. Ingold were simpler these were generally adopted and Lapworth's pioneering work was largely forgotten until the late 1940s. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1910, Lapworth served on its council (1927&#150;9) and was awarded the Davy medal (1931). He received honorary LLD degrees from Birmingham and St Andrews; on retirement in 1935 he was made emeritus professor at Manchester.<br>
<br>Lapworth was retiring, generous, especially to his students, and sincere, though he had a sharp wit. He ran his department with firmness and wisdom; in controversy he was always courteous. He loved radio, the cinema, and the theatre and had a wide knowledge of classical music, playing the violin, cello, and viola at Perkin's musical parties in Manchester. He was a member of the council of the Manchester College of Music for many years. Carpentry, microscopy, astronomy, geology, mountaineering, golf, and fishing were among his hobbies; he was an authority on British mosses and was interested in ornithology.<br>
<br>Lapworth died at Sandown Nursing Home, 55 Palatine Road, Withington, Manchester, on 5 April 1941. He was survived by his wife.<br>
