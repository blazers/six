<span class="headword">Sanders,  Ruth Vernon  Manning-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Ruth Vernon Manning]</span>  (1888&#150;1988), <span class="occ">writer and folklorist</span>, was born on 21 August 1888 in Swansea, the youngest of three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34857/', "John Edmondson Manning (1848&#150;1910)")</script>, Unitarian minister, and his wife. Brought up in a book-loving, play-acting household and moving to Sheffield, then to Manchester, Ruth won a Shakespeare scholarship to Manchester University, where she hoped to gain a degree in English literature and become an actress. A serious illness, however, ended her studies at the university, and a period of convalescence and travel then followed.<br>
<br>Ruth met George Rawlings Sanders (1884/5&#150;1952), then a painter, in Devon. The pair married in Totnes on 22 May 1911, joined their surnames with a hyphen, and took to the road together&#151;literally: in a horse-drawn caravan&#151;and spent two exciting, unorthodox, and thoroughly enjoyable years travelling with the well-known tenting circus known as Count Rosaire's, owned by Freddie Ross. A photograph shows Ruth in boots and breeches, whip in hand, seated on the knee of a crouching elephant&#151;which she apparently rode through the streets as part of the circus parade. With the birth of their daughter Joan in 1913 the circus period ended, and more conventional quarters were established in Bude, Cornwall. The caravanning influence must have persisted, however, because between 1914 and 1927 the Manning-Sanders household (augmented by a son, David, born in 1915) lived in Newlyn (Cornwall), Midhurst (Sussex), Catchal (Cornwall), Grasse (near Cannes), Catchal again, and Sennen Cove.<br>
<br>In 1919 Ruth's first work was published: <span class="italic">The Pedlar, and other Poems</span>. Two years later she submitted a narrative poem, <span class="italic">Karn</span>, to the Hogarth Press in hopes of publication. Virginia Woolf was enthusiastic: &#145;She sent a long poem, which seems to have a good deal of merit, and we are going to bring it out this Spring &hellip; its rather exciting and altogether most unexpected&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2.495). By early 1922 the publishing process was well under way: &#145;We are &hellip; busy printing a new long poem by a short fat poetess, who came to correct her proofs the other day &hellip; She was very nice, and very modest&#146;  (ibid., 2.502). To herself (in her diary, 6 February 1922) Woolf described the author: &#145;Mrs Manning-Sanders is a bob haired, wide mouthed woman, dressed in a velvet dressing gown, plump, sandy-haired with canine brown eyes far apart. We liked her&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 2.160).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Karn</span> did not sell, nor did its successors <span class="italic">Martha Wish-You-Ill</span> (1926) and <span class="italic">The City</span> (1927)&#151;though the latter was awarded the Blindman international poetry prize. Ruth Manning-Sanders turned her hand to prose with the novel <span class="italic">The Twelve Saints</span> (1925); this was followed by more fiction for adults and for children, a biography of Hans Andersen, a book about Devon and Cornwall, and <span class="italic">The English Circus</span> (1952). This title and her children's books <span class="italic">Circus Boy</span> and <span class="italic">Luke's Circus</span> drew upon her earlier experience of life with Count Rosaire's travelling troupe&#151;and Ruth Manning-Sanders is credited in the <span class="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> with the earliest use of the term &#145;strong woman&#146;, which is quoted from <span class="italic">The English Circus</span>.<br>
<br>George, confined to a wheelchair as the result of illness, abandoned painting for writing, and produced two or three novels of his own during the thirties. He died after a road accident in 1952, and it was in the aftermath of her bereavement that Ruth Manning-Sanders, in her late sixties, found her literary m&eacute;tier in the telling or retelling of folk-tales and legends for children. <span class="italic">Peter and the Piskies: Cornish Folk and Fairy Tales</span>, illustrated by Raymond Briggs, which happily united the author's lifelong interest in folklore and her abiding love for her adopted county, was published by Oxford University Press in 1958 and was an immense success. This was followed by the popular series of works entitled <span class="italic">A Book of &hellip;</span>, which was brought out by Methuen in twenty-two volumes between 1962 (<span class="italic">A Book of Giants</span>) and 1984 (<span class="italic">A Book of Magic Horses</span>). The timeless quality of her subject matter meant that the fact that the author was now in her nineties did not detract from her appeal to the children of the 1980s; the uncluttered style of her vigorous narrative and her lack of sentimentality were as appropriate to that decade as they had been when she first became a best-seller in the early fifties.<br>
<br>Manning-Sanders continued to work with the aid of her daughter Joan, who shared her house in Penzance, until 1988, when her last book, <span class="italic">A Cauldron of Witches</span>, was published six months before her 100th birthday. On 12 October 1988, two months after her birthday, this hard-working and professional writer died at Penzance, with more than ninety titles to her credit.<br>
