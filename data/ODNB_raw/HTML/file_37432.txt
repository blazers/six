<span class="headword">Freeman,  Richard Austin</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Clifford Ashdown]</span>  (1862&#150;1943), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 11 April 1862 at 27 Thayer Street, Marylebone, London, the youngest of the five children (four of them sons) of Richard Freeman (1822/3&#150;1890), a journeyman tailor who rose to become the manager of a bespoke tailoring business, and his wife, Ann Maria Dunn. Virtually nothing is known of Freeman's early years; he shrouded his early life in great mystery and the details of his secondary schooling&#151;which apparently took place at a boarding-school in north London&#151;remained unknown even to his closest relatives. On leaving school he worked in a chemist's shop and he later qualified as an apothecary (LSA) in 1886. At eighteen he entered Middlesex Hospital, qualifying as MRCS in 1886.<br>
<br>In 1887 Freeman married Annie Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1948), daughter of Thomas Edwards, a master plumber of St Pancras Road, London: they went on to have two sons. But newly married and impecunious, Freeman entered the colonial service as assistant colonial surgeon in Accra in the Gold Coast Colony, where he landed in June 1887, remaining for four years. The Gold Coast was notable for the high mortality rate suffered by Europeans, and in 1891 he contracted blackwater fever and was invalided home. Freeman's continuing ill health prevented the establishment of a successful medical practice in London, and in 1896 he retired to Broadstairs to become a writer. From 1902 he lived in Gravesend, where he both wrote books and practised medicine.<br>
<br>In 1902 Freeman became the co-author of the first of his fictional works to become well known, <span class="italic">The Adventures of Romney Pringle</span>, written under the pseudonym of Clifford Ashdown, and the fruit of Freeman's collaboration with the physician John James Pitcairn. In 1907, now working on his own, Freeman produced the first of the Doctor Thorndyke stories, the novel <span class="italic">The Red Thumb Mark</span>, whose plot revolved around the forgery of a set of fingerprints by an ingenious mechanical device. Thorndyke, both barrister and physician, was the first of the fictional &#145;scientific detectives&#146;. In 1912 Freeman published a new series of Thorndyke short stories in <span class="italic">Pearson's Magazine</span>, starting with &#145;The Case of Oscar Brodski&#146;, which made secure his important place in detective fiction. &#145;Brodski&#146; was the first &#145;inverted&#146; detective story ever written&#151;that is, one in which the identity of the criminal is known to the reader at the outset and the plot concerns the efforts of the detective to ascertain his identity. Between 1907 and 1942 Freeman produced forty Thorndyke short stories and twenty-one Thorndyke novels, to great critical acclaim. The best stand comparison with those of Arthur Conan Doyle.<br>
<br>After the First World War (in which he served as a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps, stationed in Maidstone, Kent) Freeman increasingly became involved in the eugenics movement, producing a lengthy work on the ills of society, <span class="italic">Social Decay and Regeneration</span>, in 1921. He believed that machinery and urban life had ruined modern life, and advocated what he termed the &#145;voluntary segregation of the fit&#146; to live and breed in a utopian community of farmers and skilled craftsmen. Freeman was closely associated with the Eugenics Society from the First World War until the end of his life.<br>
<br>In mature life Freeman was a large, distinguished-looking man with a walrus moustache; he was noted for his humour and self-effacement. Freeman died at his home, Rosemount, 94 Windmill Street, Gravesend, Kent, on 28 September 1943.<br>
