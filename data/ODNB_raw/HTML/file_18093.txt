<span class="headword">Marriott,  John</span>  (1780&#150;1825), <span class="occ">poet and Church of England clergyman</span>, born at Cotesbach Hall, Cotesbach, near Lutterworth, Leicestershire, and baptized at Cotesbach church on 11 September 1780, was the third and youngest son of Robert Marriott DCL (<i>d</i>. 1808), rector of Cotesbach and Gilmorton, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1819), daughter and only child of George Stow of Walthamstow, Essex. He entered Rugby School at midsummer 1788, and matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 10 October 1798. He was one of two who achieved first-class honours in classics in the first honours school in 1802, and was awarded a BA and a studentship at Christ Church. In 1806 he proceeded MA. He was ordained priest in the Church of England on 22 December 1805. His feelings about Oxford, and a clue to his reason for leaving, are contained in a manuscript &#145;Sonnet Composed under the Shadow of Joe Pullen, a Tree in Headington Hill&#146; of 1806 (Bodl. Oxf., MS top. Oxon. e. 364, fol. 120).<br>
<br>Marriott went to Dalkeith, Scotland, in 1804 to become tutor to George Henry, Lord Scott, brother of the fifth duke of Buccleuch. By 1805 he was describing himself as &#145;half a Scotchman&#146;  (Sharpe, 236). Robert Southey, meeting him then, was impressed by his ability to &#145;tell by the track what horse has past (<i>sic</i>) and how long ago&#146;, &#145;as in a savage country&#146;  (<span class="italic">Southey's Common-place Book</span>, 530). Marriott's naturalization is testified to by his neighbour Sir Walter Scott, who dedicated the introduction to the second canto of <span class="italic">Marmion</span> (1808) to his friend, celebrating their enjoyment of hunting and poetry. Intervals &#145;between each merry chase&#146; were free from dullness:<blockquote>
<div>For we had fair resource in store,<br>
</div>
<div>In Classic and in Gothic lore;<br>
</div>
<div>We marked each memorable scene,<br>
</div>
<div>And held poetic talk between.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Although Marriott disapproved of the introductory epistles he realized that his name stood &#145;a fair chance of riding down to posterity on the back of one of them&#146;  (Sharpe, 308).<br>
<br>Marriott's other claim to posterity's attention lies in his own writing. Fired by the enthusiasm in Scott's circle for ballads, he contributed three poems to the fourth volume of the <span class="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</span>: &#145;The Feast of Spurs&#146;, &#145;On a Visit Paid to the Ruins of Melrose Abbey&#146;, and &#145;Archie Armstrong's Aith&#146;. Southey describes in his <span class="italic">Common-Place Book</span> an evening in 1805 with Scott and Marriott reciting ballads. He did not realize that a &#145;deplorably bad business upon Purlin Jane&#146;  (p. 530) was Marriott's &#145;Pearlin Jean&#146;, in which a jilted girl's ghost takes revenge. This poem and others on Scottish subjects, and several letters by Marriott, are published in <span class="italic">Letters from and to Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe</span>.<br>
<br>Marriott's tribute to Scott is his poem &#145;The Poet Released from the Law&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Annual Register, 1809</span> (1811), 652&#150;3. Composed in 1806, the poem concludes:<blockquote>
<div>Oh may it be my lot to wander near,<br>
</div>
<div>Some strains of his enchanting minstrelsy to hear!<br>
</div>
</blockquote>That wish, and his intention to marry Mary Scott, of the Buccleuch family, and set up house with his pupil was foiled early in 1807 by a pulmonary disorder, which forced him to resign his post and retreat to Penzance. On 28 April 1807 he became rector of Church Lawford and Newnham Chapelry in Warwickshire, a benefice in the gift of the Buccleuch family. On 19 April 1808 he married Mary Anne Harris (<i>d</i>. 1821), daughter of a Rugby solicitor, Thomas Harris, and his wife, Ann Harrison. Her poor health caused them to move to Devon, where Marriott served as curate of St James, Exeter, St Lawrence, Exeter, and Broadclyst. During this time Marriott wrote several hymns, including &#145;Thou whose almighty word&#146;, &#145;A saint, O would that I could claim&#146;, and &#145;When Christ our human form did bear&#146;. He also turned to secular verse, and wrote his best known poem, the gently satirical &#145;Devonshire Lane&#146;, which describes the narrowness and bumpiness of marriage. It is printed in several places, including Joanna Baillie's <span class="italic">Collection of Poems</span> (1823) and William Everitt's <span class="italic">Devonshire Scenery</span> (1884), which also contains &#145;A Devonshire Sketch&#146;. The poems' merits are wit, humour, and intelligence, rather than metrical ingenuity or originality. A volume of Marriott's autograph poems is held by Exeter Central Library.<br>
<br>Marriott collected and published his sermons in 1818, and after his death his sons John and Charles edited another volume in 1838. His sympathies were with the low-church party. In the summer of 1824, being diagnosed with &#145;ossification of the brain&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1825), Marriott moved to London for medical treatment. He died there on 31 March 1825 and was interred in the burial-ground of St Giles-in-the-Fields adjacent to Old St Pancras Church. Marriott had five children: John, Thomas, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18090/', "Charles Marriott (1811&#150;1858)")</script>, George, and Mary Ann.<br>
