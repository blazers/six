<span class="headword">Colomb,  Philip Howard</span>  (1831&#150;1899), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in Scotland on 29 May 1831, the third son of Lieutenant-General George Thomas Colomb (1788&#150;1874), colonel of the 97th regiment, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Sir Abraham Bradley King, first baronet, of Corrard, co. Fermanagh, twice lord mayor of Dublin. He was the elder brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32510/', "Sir John Charles Ready Colomb (1838&#150;1909)")</script>. Educated privately, he entered the navy in February 1846 on board the <i>Tartarus</i> on the Irish station, and from November 1846 to March 1849 was in the steam frigate <i>Sidon</i> in the Mediterranean. He was then appointed to the <i>Reynard</i> on the China station, and remained on the station as a supernumerary in various ships, until in September he was appointed to the 16-gun brig-sloop <i>Serpent</i> in which, from November until May 1852, he was engaged in the Second Anglo-Burmese War and was present at the capture of Rangoon. He passed his examination in seamanship in May 1852, and continued in the <i>Serpent</i> as acting mate and acting lieutenant until she was paid off in January 1854. In March he joined the screw-sloop <i>Phoenix</i> for a voyage to Smith Sound under the command of Captain (afterwards Admiral) Sir Edward Augustus Inglefield. On his return to England in October he was appointed to the guardship <i>Ajax</i> and on 3 February 1855 was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Hastings</i>, going up the Baltic under James Crawford Caffin. In May 1856 he was appointed to the <i>Excellent</i> for the gunnery course and, having passed out in November 1857, was in December appointed flag-lieutenant to Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Sabine Pasley, then admiral superintendent at Devonport, and later to Pasley's successor, Thomas Matthew Charles Symonds. In 1857 Colomb married Eleanor Bourne, daughter of Captain Hook, 34th regiment; they had two daughters and six sons, of whom five entered the public service.<br>
<br>Colomb in 1858 was ordered by the Admiralty to examine and report on a system of day signals which they had bought. On his showing its unsuitability for sea service, he was asked to improve night signals, then still made in the seventeenth-century manner. Colomb had already studied this problem, without success; he resumed his experiments, and after many months' work devised a system long used in the navy, known as Colomb's flashing signals, using Morse code with long and short flashes from a lamp by night, or blasts from the foghorn or steam whistle in fog. Their novelty has been disputed, and possibly the method had been more or less vaguely suggested before. After opposition, unfavourable reports, and much testing, it was adopted first by the Channel Fleet, under Sidney Colpoys Dacres, before being fully adopted in the navy in February 1867.<br>
<br>On 12 December 1863 Colomb was promoted commander, but continued attached nominally to the <i>Edgar</i> or the <i>Victory</i>, to perfect his signalling system. In 1867 he was seconded to the Royal Engineers, to improve military signalling.<br>
<br>In July 1868 Colomb commissioned the wooden steam sloop <i>Dryad</i>, part of the British naval force which patrolled the Indian Ocean, capturing Arab slave dhows sailing from east Africa to Arabia. Colomb's <i>Dryad</i> captured seven slavers with 365 Africans on board. From his experiences Colomb wrote <span class="italic">Slave Catching in the Indian Ocean</span> (1873), a useful historical source and an expression of his opinions: he considered the Australian Aborigines the lowest race he ever saw and that, unlike Africans, they could not be improved by civilization. On 4 April 1870 he was advanced to post rank, and for approaching four years worked at the Admiralty preparing the <span class="italic">Manual of Fleet Evolutions</span>, officially issued in 1874. From 1874 to 1877 he commanded the battleship <i>Audacious</i> on the China station, as flag-captain to Vice-Admiral Alfred Phillipps Ryder; in 1880 he commanded the turret-ship <i>Thunderer</i> in the Mediterranean, and from 1881 to 1884 was captain of the steam reserve at Portsmouth, from which in September 1884 he was appointed to the shore establishment as flag-captain to Sir Geoffrey Thomas Phipps Hornby. On 20 May 1886 he was retired owing to age, still nearly a year from the top of the captains' list. In 1886 he published <span class="italic">Fifteen Years of Naval Retirement</span>, criticizing the 1870 naval officer retirement scheme and opposing compulsory retirement. He became rear-admiral on 6 April 1887 and vice-admiral on 1 August 1892 but received no official honours. From 1887, succeeding his friend John Knox Laughton, he lectured on naval strategy and tactics at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. He resided at Botley, Hampshire.<br>
<br>The coming of steam and a perceived &#145;scientific age&#146; had led many naval officers to reject as irrelevant the lessons of sailing warfare. Initially the work of neither Colomb nor his brother John was historically informed, but from the later 1880s, influenced by Laughton, Colomb developed the historical side of his work, and in turn influenced Laughton. He was also influenced by his brother, with whose ideas he agreed and on whose foundations he built. He acknowledged John's primacy on imperial defence, writing that John had &#145;the leading part in laying down and continually differentiating the governing principles of Imperial Defence&#146; and claimed John's 1867 pamphlet <span class="italic">The Protection of our Commerce and Distribution of our Naval Forces Considered</span> gave &#145;the key-note to all subsequent discussions&#146;  (Colomb, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, 1).<br>
<br>In his retirement Colomb devoted himself to the study of naval history as a key to the problems of naval policy and strategy. Like Laughton and Alfred Thayer Mahan, he argued the continuities of sailing and steam warfare and the validity of lessons drawn from sailing warfare, notably on command of the sea, blockade, and defence against invasion. He asserted in 1887, &#145;it is impossible to form correct views of the present or future of naval warfare unless they are based on a pretty thorough investigation of its history in the past&#146;  (Colomb, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, 197). The science of naval evolutions he had, theoretically, a complete mastery of, though fate prevented him from combining practice with his theory, and his views did not always meet, among naval men, with that ready acceptance many believed they were entitled to. Fisher and others criticized him as a &#145;theoretical&#146; admiral. Laughton claimed in 1893 that some of the opposition to Colomb's theories reflected the &#145;imperfection&#146; of his language. An untiring correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, Colomb had an opinion to express on many contemporary naval issues: for example, he condemned very heavy guns but advocated convoys. He was &#145;an ardent advocate for strengthening the Navy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 171). He wrote voluminously and was generally known as &#145;Column and a Half&#146;. At the meetings at the Royal United Service Institution (RUSI) he was a regular attender, a frequent speaker, and contributed several important papers, some of which were published in <span class="italic">Essays on Naval Defence</span> (1893). He claimed that the essays merited republication because up to then no single book existed on the whole subject of naval defence &#145;where the great principles of strategy and tactics are placed side by side with the material and personal conditions which either govern or are governed by them&#146;  (Colomb, <span class="italic">Essays</span>, iii). His major work was <span class="italic">Naval Warfare: its Ruling Principles and Practice Historically Treated</span> (1891; 2nd edn, 1893; 3rd edn, 1899), whose great merit was somewhat obscured by its length. This work attempted to make history a determining guide for the analysis of naval problems of that age. Contemporaneous with Mahan's classic <span class="italic">Influence of Sea Power upon History</span> (1890)&#151;which overshadowed Colomb's work, and which he generously praised&#151;Colomb's <span class="italic">Naval Warfare</span> attempted a scientific explanation of how history shaped international politics and British imperial defence.<br>
<br>In Britain Colomb was the precursor of other naval historian-strategists, notably Sir Julian Corbett, and later, Soviet naval theory embraced Colomb for a time. In contrast to Mahan's historical survey, Colomb's work followed a logical structure, working up from securing command of the sea to power projection operations. It was a more accurate reflection of British thinking, particularly in its emphasis on the offensive: for this reason Russian naval thinkers took his work to heart. Its most valuable contribution to naval thought was the concept of a fleet-in-being, which he developed from Herbert's rationalization of his defeat at Beachy Head in 1690. Colomb was a major intellectual influence on the late Victorian navy. His <span class="italic">Memoir of Sir Astley Cooper Key</span> (1898) as a biography was among the best of its kind and era. An advocate of the ascendant &#145;blue water&#146; school, Colomb argued an extreme navalist case in the controversy over the relative roles of warships and fortifications, notably in his 1889 RUSI paper, &#145;The relations between local fortifications and a moving navy&#146;.<br>
<br>During his last years Colomb worked at a memoir of Arthur Herbert, earl of Torrington, whose character and conduct of the battle of Beachy Head (30 June 1690) he considered misrepresented by popular historians. He published numerous pamphlets on naval matters. With J. F. Maurice, Archibald Forbes, and others, he wrote the future war fiction <span class="italic">The Great War of 189-</span>, published serially in <span class="italic">Black and White</span> (1892), then in book form (1893). He was one of the founders of the Navy Records Society (1893). A war games enthusiast, he wrote the influential <span class="italic">The Duel: a Naval War Game</span> (1879), used by the United States navy in the 1880s.<br>
<br>Colomb died at his home, Steeple Court, Botley, Hampshire, suddenly from an affection of the heart, on 13 October 1899. He was survived by his wife.<br>
