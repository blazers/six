<span class="headword">Clogie,  Alexander</span>  (1614&#150;1698), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and biographer</span>, was born in Scotland and may have attended Trinity College, Dublin. He was admitted to holy orders by Bishop William Bedell of Kilmore in 1636 and collated to the vicarage of Dyne, co. Cavan, on 12 November 1637. The same month he married Bedell's stepdaughter Leah Mawe, daughter of a recorder of Bury St Edmunds and his wife, also Leah Mawe, but she died within a few weeks. On 7 May 1640 Clogie became vicar of Urney or Cavan. Resident at the episcopal palace at Kilmore, by his own account he assisted Bedell with his translation of scripture into Irish. Following the outbreak of the 1641 rising Clogie, together with the bishop and several others, was seized by the insurgents in December 1641 at Kilmore and conveyed to the nearly ruinous castle of Cloughoughter, where the party was kept for three weeks in severe winter weather. Released in a prisoner exchange, they remained in the area residing at the home of a clergyman, Denis O'Sheridan. Bedell became seriously ill and Clogie remained with him until his death on 7 February 1642. After officiating at Bedell's funeral he joined refugees who departed Cavan for protestant-held Drogheda in June 1642. He moved on to Dublin and later reported that he had served for fifteen months as a deputy commissary to Sir Philip Perceval, responsible for the receipt of bread and biscuit from the Dublin bakers. In late 1643 he travelled to England with the troops dispatched by the marquess of Ormond to serve the king, acting as chaplain to the cavalry. By September 1646 he was minister at Beely, in Worcestershire, and by the following year was officiating as minister at Wigmore, in Herefordshire, a living in the hands of the parliamentarian Harley family.<br>
<br>Clogie remained at Wigmore for the rest of his life. His early praise for the populace seems to have been reciprocated, for in 1650 inhabitants of the parish successfully petitioned in his favour against an act banishing Scots from England. He married Susanna Nelme (<i>d</i>. 1711), the daughter of John Nelme, at Ludlow on 11 December 1655, and the baptism of two sons and four daughters of their marriage are recorded at Wigmore between 1656 and 1671. At some point before 1679 he wrote <span class="italic">Speculum episcoporum, or, The apostolique bishop, being a brief account of the lyfe and death of that reverend father in God, D. William Bedell</span>. Though it was the foundation for the much more influential life of Bedell published by Bishop Gilbert Burnet in 1685, Clogie's work was not published until 1862, then again in 1902. He published <span class="italic">Vox corvi, or, The Voice of a Raven</span> (1694, perhaps with a first edition in 1691), a sermon prompted by an incident where his grandson heard a raven &#145;that thrice spoke these words distinctly; &#147;Look into Colossians the 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 15<sup>th</sup>&#148;&#146;  (Jones, 219), a command which Clogie related to a family dispute in the parish. He died in 1698 at Wigmore, where he was buried.<br>
