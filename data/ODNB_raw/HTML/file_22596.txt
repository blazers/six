<span class="headword">Postlethwaite,  Thomas</span>  (1730/31&#150;1798), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was the son of Richard Postlethwaite of Crooklands, Lancashire. He was educated under Mr Fisher at St Bees School, Cumberland, and entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, as a subsizar on 19 June 1749, aged eighteen. He was elected scholar on 24 April 1752, sizars at that time not being allowed to sit for scholarships until their third year. He graduated BA in 1753, when he was placed third in the mathematical tripos with the reputation, which he retained throughout his life, of being one of the best mathematicians in the university. He proceeded MA (1756), BD (1768), and DD (by royal mandate) in 1789. He was elected fellow in 1755, held various college lectureships and offices, and from 1763 to 1776 was tutor. He had been ordained deacon at Lincoln on 13 June 1756, and in 1774 was presented to the rectory of Hamerton, Huntingdonshire, which he retained until his death. He published only one sermon, on the subject of prophecy, which he preached before the university on Christmas eve 1780.<br>
<br>Postlethwaite, who was made senior fellow in 1782, was recommended by Richard Farmer, master of Emmanuel College, to succeed John Hinchcliffe as master of Trinity in 1789. When recommending him to the prime minister, Farmer told Pitt, &#145;If you wish to oblige the society, appoint Postlethwaite&#146;. Postlethwaite certainly took a relaxed attitude towards his duties as head of house. Mindful of the disruption caused by some of his predecessors, such as Richard Bentley, he &#145;soon discovered that, if he was alert, he and the Seniors should be at variance, according to antient usage&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 6.738). The principal reforms carried out during his mastership&#151;the establishment of public examinations for fellowships and for first- and second-year undergraduates&#151;do not appear to have been due to his initiative. He incurred considerable embarrassment in 1792 when he broke his promise to appoint the most outstanding classicist of the day, Richard Porson, to a vacant lay fellowship at Trinity. He quickly made amends by nominating Porson for the regius professorship of Greek, to which Porson was elected unanimously.<br>
<br>Postlethwaite never married, and one of his nieces kept house for him. He died at Bath on 4 May 1798, and was buried in the abbey church, where there is a monument to his memory in the north aisle.<br>
