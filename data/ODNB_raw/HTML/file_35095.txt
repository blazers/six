<span class="headword">Morant,  Geoffrey Miles</span>  (1899&#150;1964), <span class="occ">anthropologist and statistician</span>, was born in Battersea, London, on 15 July 1899, the third child of Henry Morant, headmaster of an elementary school in Lambeth, and his wife, Maria Elizabeth Miles. He was educated at Battersea secondary school and, after service with the machine-gun corps in the First World War, at University College, London. He obtained a BSc in applied statistics (second-class honours, 1920), an MSc in 1922, and a DSc in 1926. He held board for scientific and industrial research and Crewdson Berington studentships and an 1851 Exhibition from 1920 to 1926. In 1932 he won the Weldon memorial prize. He married, on 31 July 1922, Geraldine Wynne (<i>b</i>. 1886/7), who died in childbirth in 1923. The child also died. In 1928 he married Mary Evelyn, daughter of Ernest Hitchcock, caterer; they had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Morant was on the staff of the department of applied statistics at University College and was a pupil of Karl Pearson. By the late 1920s Morant was the acknowledged leader of the biometric school of physical anthropologists. Much of his early work appeared in <span class="italic">Biometrika</span> (of which he was assistant editor). His first paper, &#145;On random occurrence in space and time when followed by a closed interval&#146; (1921), was soon followed by a number of important contributions to physical anthropology setting new and critical standards. These included &#145;Tibetan skulls&#146; (1923) and &#145;Racial history of Egypt&#146; (1925). In 1926 he showed that the so-called Iberian inhabitants of Neolithic Britain were of Nordic not Mediterranean origin. Subsequent work confirmed Morant's views, which were unconventional at that time. Four important studies on Palaeolithic man appeared in the <span class="italic">Annals of Eugenics</span> (1926&#150;30). In 1935, in collaboration with Pearson, he produced a lavishly illustrated study of the &#145;Wilkinson&#146; head of Oliver Cromwell. This showed the relic to be the protector's head and shed new light on his death and the disposal of the remains. This work led to the advances in forensic medicine first used in the trial of Dr Buck Ruxton (charged with murdering his wife, Isabella, and their children's nanny).<br>
<br>When Hitler came to power Morant was disturbed by the manner in which his discipline was being perverted for political ends. In an article &#145;An attempt to estimate the variability of various populations&#146; (1939) in <span class="italic">Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Rassenkunde</span> he destroyed the foundation of Nazi theories of pure race. This was followed in 1939 by <span class="italic">The Races of Central Europe</span> (with a preface by J. B. S. Haldane) in which, by using blood groups and anthropometry, he showed that the Germans were racially the most heterogeneous group in Europe. In 1939 the <i>Biometrika</i> Trust published a bibliography of Karl Pearson's work prepared by Morant from material given him by Pearson.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the Second World War Morant joined the Ministry of Information. But by 1942 he was applying his anthropometric methods to help the Medical Research Council's army personnel research committee. The first report (1943), written jointly with Austin Bradford Hill, analysed the heights and weights of 1600 men in the Royal Armoured Corps; later (1945) a more detailed study of 2000 tank personnel gave the information needed to design tanks with the optimal space for the crew. From 1944 Morant worked at the physiological laboratory (the RAF Institute of Aviation Medicine) at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough. He prepared many reports for the flying personnel research committee. These covered four main topics: surveys of heights and weights of men and women recruits to the RAF with comparisons with earlier similar surveys; body measurements of aircrew to provide the information needed for improving the fit of services clothing, and for the detailed design of aircraft cockpits, seats, and their controls; statistical analyses of research projects at the establishment, such as the effects of fluoride on dental caries; and experimental studies of decompression and airsickness. Morant worked closely with those making the decisions&#151;the cockpit design teams and the cutters preparing the patterns for the clothing. In this way his work had an important and immediate application.<br>
<br>At the end of the war Morant returned briefly to academic work at University College. This was a period of great disappointment for him. He had expected that the understandings he had had with those in authority before the war would secure him a senior appointment in the department of anthropology or anatomy. But the senior staff had died, others had moved away, and the appointment he had expected had been filled. He therefore returned to the Institute of Aviation Medicine, retiring in 1959.<br>
<br>Morant had an old-world courtesy, a rather diffident manner, and a charming smile which was immediately attractive to the many much younger laboratory members with whom he worked so successfully. He was tall and handsome, with striking dark eyebrows. His modesty prevented many of his colleagues in the services realizing his eminence as an anthropologist. It also perhaps prevented him pushing earlier and harder to ensure his return to academic work at the end of the war. His kindness to many by helping to prepare publications often went unrecorded at his request. He was an eminent anthropologist who made a unique contribution to the needs of the services in the later part of his career. He was appointed OBE in 1952. He died at his home, Southbrook, Brook Street, Bishop's Waltham, Hampshire, on 3 July 1964. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
