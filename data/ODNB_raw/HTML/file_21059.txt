<span class="headword">Oxlee,  John</span>  (1779&#150;1854), <span class="occ">philologist and writer on theology</span>, son of a well-to-do farmer in Yorkshire, was born at Guisborough in Cleveland, Yorkshire, on 25 September 1779, and educated at Sunderland. After working as a tailor for a short time he studied mathematics and Latin, taught classics at a school near Greta Bridge, and made such rapid progress in Latin that in 1802 Dr Vicesimus Knox appointed him second master at Tonbridge School. There he lost, through inflammation, the use of an eye, yet began studying Hebrew, Chaldee, and Syriac. In 1805 he was ordained to the curacy of Egton, near Whitby, where he married a daughter of John R. A. Worsop of Howden Hall, Yorkshire, and took in pupils. In 1811 he moved to the curacy of Stonegrave, from 1816 to 1826 he held the rectory of Scawton for the master of Downing College, and in 1836 the archbishop of York presented him to the rectory of Molesworth in Huntingdonshire.<br>
<br>Oxlee's power of acquiring languages, considering that he was self-educated, has rarely been excelled. He is said to have obtained a knowledge more or less extensive of 120 languages and dialects. In pursuing his studies he often had to form his own grammar and dictionary. He left among his numerous unpublished writings a work entitled &#145;One hundred and more vocabularies of such words as form the stamina of human speech, commencing with the Hungarian and terminating with the Yoruba&#146; (1837&#150;40). He spent much time on mastering the Hebrew law and in studying the <span class="roman">Talmud</span>. His only recreation was walking, and he at times walked 50 miles to York or Hull to obtain a book in Hebrew or some other oriental language. He was a contributor to the <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin Review</span>, <span class="italic">Valpy's Classical Journal</span>, the <span class="italic">Christian Remembrancer</span>, the <span class="italic">Voice of Jacob</span>, the <span class="italic">Voice of Israel</span>, the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span>, the <span class="italic">Jewish Repository</span>, <span class="italic">The Yorkshireman</span>, and <span class="italic">Sermons for Sundays and Festivals</span>.<br>
<br>Oxlee's minute study of the Hebrew writings led him to differ on many important points both from the Jewish and Christian interpreters. His most important work is <span class="italic">The Christian doctrine of the Trinity and incarnation considered and maintained on the principles of Judaism</span> (3 vols., 1815&#150;50). During the thirty-four years which elapsed between the publication of the first and third volumes he was busy collecting materials. The work contains a mass of abstruse learning. He held that the Jewish rabbis were well aware of the doctrine of the Trinity, and that in the <span class="roman">Talmuds</span> the three persons of the Godhead are clearly mentioned and often referred to. In his <span class="italic">Three Letters to the Archbishop of Canterbury</span> (1842) and <span class="italic">Three More Letters</span> (1845) he stated his reasons for declining to take any part in the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews, and his grounds for not believing in the personality of the devil. From 1842 to 1854 he corresponded with a Jewish scholar, Mr Peynado, respecting the differences between Judaism and Christianity. Seven previous letters, addressed to J. M., a Jew, are printed in the <span class="italic">Jewish Repository</span> (1815&#150;16). An article in the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> welcomed his stance on Judaism, calling him &#145;a believing priest of the Church Tolerant&#146; (11 July 1845).<br>
<br>Oxlee's many controversial pamphlets, letters, and sermons included his <span class="italic">Three letters to the Archbishop Lawrence of Cashel on the apocryphal publications of his grace (Enoch, Ezra, and Isaiah) on the age of the Sepher Zoar and on the two genealogies of Christ as given in the gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke</span> (1854). This publication amazed Dr Nicholl, regius professor of divinity at Oxford, by its immense number of correct extracts from early and late Jewish writers. Oxlee's taste for controversy is exemplified in <span class="italic">Three letters to Mr. C. Wellbeloved, tutor of the Unitarian College, York, on the folly of separating from the mother church</span>.<br>
<br>Oxlee died at Molesworth rectory on 30 January 1854, leaving two children: an unmarried daughter, Marianna, and a son, John Oxlee (<i>d</i>. 1892), vicar of Over Silton in 1848 and rector of Cowesby in 1863 (both in Yorkshire). The latter's intention of publishing a memoir of his father does not seem to have been fulfilled. Oxlee himself left many unpublished works, including an Armenian and an Arabic lexicon.<br>
