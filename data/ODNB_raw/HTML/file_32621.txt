<span class="headword">Crawfurd, Sir  Raymond Henry Payne</span>  (1865&#150;1938), <span class="occ">physician and medical historian</span>, was born at East Grinstead, Sussex, on 9 November 1865, the sixth son of the Revd Charles Walter Payne Crawfurd, and his wife, Mary, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20610/', "James Adey Ogle")</script>, regius professor of medicine at Oxford. He was educated at Winchester College, New College, Oxford, and King's College Hospital, London, at all of which he gained scholarships or prizes. He qualified BCh (Oxon.) in 1894 and DM in 1896. After holding resident appointments at his hospital and at the Victoria Hospital for Children, Chelsea, he became in 1898 assistant physician to King's College Hospital and later (1905) full physician, as well as lecturer there and at the London School of Medicine for Women. He continued with active work at King's College Hospital until 1930.<br>
<br>Crawfurd took a keen interest in the history of medicine and played a leading part in the foundation of the section of the history of medicine of the Royal Society of Medicine, of which section he became president. He contributed to the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the society many interesting papers such as &#145;Martial and medicine&#146; (1913), &#145;Oliver Goldsmith and medicine&#146; (1914), and &#145;Superstitions concerning menstruation&#146; (1915). He also published <span class="italic">The Last Days of Charles II</span> (1909). Besides his historical work he was the author of a thesis on exophthalmic goitre, and was joint editor with Farquhar Buzzard of Burney Yeo's <span class="italic">Manual of Medical Treatment</span> (1913).<br>
<br>Crawfurd took an active part in the affairs of the Royal College of Physicians, of which he was elected a member in 1894, a fellow in 1901, and registrar in 1925, holding this post until his death in 1938. He also gave the Fitzpatrick lectures in 1911&#150;12, which were expanded and published as <span class="italic">The King's Evil</span> (1911) and as <span class="italic">Plague and Pestilence in Literature and Art</span> (1914), and he delivered the Harveian oration in 1919. His skill as an organizer, for which he was knighted in 1933, was shown by the active part which he took in the transfer of King's College Hospital from its position near the Strand to its new site on Denmark Hill. He was an effective chairman of the council of Epsom College (1923&#150;36), though permitting &#145;undue prolixity in debate&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 652).<br>
<br>Crawfurd married in 1898 Ethelberta Ormrod, youngest daughter of Colonel Arthur Bailey JP, of Bolton; they had three sons. He died at 11 Beaumont Street, London, after a few days' illness, on 9 March 1938, his wife surviving him.<br>
