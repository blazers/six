<span class="headword">Zarnecki,  Jerzy <span class="st"> [George]</span></span>  (1915&#150;2008), <span class="occ">art historian</span>, was born on 12 September 1915 at Stara Osota, near Kiev, Ukraine, the third of five children of Zygmunt Zarnecki, civil engineer, and his wife, Julia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wolszczan. His father was a convert from Judaism, his mother Catholic. His parents moved to Poland at the Russian revolution and Zarnecki grew up in Rataje, a small village beside the Vistula, where he attended the mathematical gymnasium. He then went on to Cracow University where he obtained his MA degree in 1938 and became junior assistant in the Art History Institute. His career was cut short at the beginning of the Second World War, during which he served in the Polish army in France, where he was taken prisoner in 1940. His escape with the help of forged documents in 1942, his adventures in occupied southern France, internment in Spain, and escape to England make a dramatic narrative. His war service was recognized by the award of the Polish cross of valour and the Croix de Guerre. While still in the Polish army in the UK, taking shelter during an air raid at Regent's Park tube station in 1944, he met Anne Leslie Frith (1923&#150;2009), daughter of John Leslie Frith, actor, whom he married on 22 March the following year and who remained his lifelong support. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>After the war Zarnecki undertook a PhD degree at the Courtauld Institute under the inspiring supervision of Fritz Saxl, director of the Warburg Institute. Completed in 1950, his dissertation was on the regional schools in English sculpture in the twelfth century, and it set the course of his academic career. In 1945 he had obtained his first employment at the Courtauld as assistant in the Conway Library, the unrivalled photographic archive of medieval art and architecture, and scholars in this field owed much to his photographic campaigns abroad. After ten years as Conway librarian, he joined the teaching staff with the rank of reader in 1959, became deputy director in 1961, and professor in 1963. It was a period of expansion for the institute under Anthony Blunt's directorship and it was Zarnecki who carried the main administrative burden. His diplomatic and managerial skills were much admired and it was widely thought that he would become director when Blunt retired in 1974. But he felt that he wanted to return to more teaching and research and declined to apply. His achievements as scholar and deputy director received recognition from the 1960s: most notably, he was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1968, made a CBE in 1970, and received several honorary doctorates. He was Slade professor of fine art at Oxford in 1960&#150;1 and received the gold medal of the Society of Antiquaries in 1986. His generous help to Polish students and scholars was recognized by the award of several Polish distinctions.<br>
<br>Zarnecki published a considerable body of work, which was both authoritative and accessible. His two volumes <span class="italic">English Romanesque Sculpture, 1066&#150;1140</span> (1951) and <span class="italic">Later English Romanesque Sculpture, 1140&#150;1210</span> (1953) are deceptively modest in length and format. They were the first to propose a widely accepted structure of dates and sequence of the main monuments. These general books were followed by detailed studies of <span class="italic">English Romanesque Lead Sculpture</span> (1957), <span class="italic">Early Sculpture at Ely Cathedral</span> (1958), and <span class="italic">Romanesque Sculpture at Lincoln Cathedral</span> (1963; expanded edn, 1988) as well as numerous innovative articles collected in his two-volume <span class="italic">Studies in Romanesque Sculpture</span> (1979&#150;92). Of his major publications only <span class="italic">Gislebertus, Sculptor of Autun</span> (1961) concentrated on a continental monument. The eleventh century saw the revival of monumental architectural sculpture and most of the surviving sculpture of the period forms an integral part of ecclesiastical buildings. Accordingly, a study of the history of the architectural setting was Zarnecki's first concern, followed by a close analysis of the sculpture itself. Comparisons, particularly with English illuminated manuscripts and continental sculpture, were adduced to fix sources of inspiration, dates, and sequences of development. If stylistic analysis was the main concern, his expertise also covered questions of material, patronage, and iconography. One of his most valued early studies demonstrated that the coronation of the Virgin, an image best known from thirteenth-century French sculpture and mosaics in Roman churches, in fact had its earliest development in England, as seen in a capital of about 1130 from Reading Abbey.<br>
<br>Shortly after his retirement in 1982 Zarnecki achieved a particular triumph with the Arts Council's magnificent exhibition <span class="roman">English Romanesque Art</span> at the Hayward Gallery in 1984. His was the inspiration behind the exhibition, which for the first time brought the subject to a really wide audience. Indeed, although his reputation was that of a specialist, his ability to cover large fields for a more general public was demonstrated as early as 1945 by his brief introduction, <span class="italic">Polish Art</span>, and more fully with his <span class="italic">Art and the Medieval World</span> (1975). His achievements were matched by the warmth of his personality. Immediately striking was the old-world continental charm that remained with him to the end. But the charm was matched by a deep-seated kindness, concern for others, and gift for friendship. He died of broncho-pneumonia at Barnet General Hospital, London, on 8 September 2008, and was buried on 22 September at Golders Green crematorium. His wife died nine months later. They were survived by their two children.<br>
