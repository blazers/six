<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Young,  Matthew</span>  (1750&#150;1800), <span class="occ">natural philosopher and bishop of Clonfert</span>, was born on 3 October 1750 at Castlerea, co. Roscommon, and was the fourth son of Owen Young and Olivia Maria Bell. He matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, on 8 July 1766, obtained a scholarship in 1769, and graduated BA (1772), MA (1774), and BD (1782). Young married Anne, daughter of Captain Bennet Cuthbertson; the couple had eleven children.<br>
<br>Elected fellow in 1775, Young was appointed Donegal lecturer at Trinity College in 1782. Two years later he published, in Dublin and in London, <span class="italic">An Enquiry into the Principal ph&aelig;nomena of Sounds and Musical Strings</span>, an endeavour to vindicate Isaac Newton's work on air pulses in <span class="italic">Principia</span>. In 1786 he was awarded the degree of DD and he was elected professor of natural philosophy in Trinity College. Young enthusiastically promoted private research at the college. In 1777 he founded a society for the study of Syriac and theology, as well as a philosophical society, the forerunner of the Royal Irish Academy, of which he was a founder member. To the transactions of this body Young contributed several papers, chiefly on scientific subjects, as well as one on ancient Gaelic poetry, in which he took much interest. His <span class="italic">Ancient Gaelic Poems, Collected in the Highlands of Scotland</span> appeared in 1787. In 1790 Young published an anonymous tract, <span class="italic">An enquiry how far the provost of Trinity College, Dublin, is vested with a negative upon the proceedings of the senior fellows</span>. The question arose from the claim of the provost, John Hely Hutchinson, from which Young himself had suffered, to overrule elections of fellows even against a clear majority of the electors.<br>
<br>On 2 February 1798 Young was consecrated as bishop of Clonfert, Ireland's poorest diocese, on the recommendation of the lord lieutenant's principal secretary, who considered Young &#145;the most distinguished literary character in the kingdom&#146;. This was also the opinion of William Bennet, bishop of Cloyne, who described Young as &#145;the ablest man I have seen in the country, with a keen and logical mind, united to exquisite taste. He has the playfulness and ingenuousness of a schoolboy&#146;. Besides his scientific and theological attainments Young was an amateur landscape painter and an enthusiastic botanist. Following his appointment as bishop of Clonfert he studied Syriac with special reference to an amended version of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> which he had undertaken, and which was printed, but not published, in his lifetime. Young's work remained unfinished at his death from cancer at Whitworth, Lancashire, on 28 November 1800. His remains were brought to Dublin and interred in Trinity College chapel. A more important work in preparation at the time of his death was his <span class="italic">Method of Prime and Ultimate Ratios, Illustrated by a Comment on the Principia</span>, in Latin; it was never published. Thomas Elrington, bishop of Ferns, published a sermon on Young's death, with biographical details, which appeared in three editions in 1800. A pension of &pound;500 per annum was obtained for Young's widow and children. In 1803 there appeared <span class="italic">An Analysis of the Principles of Natural Philosophy</span>, a compendium of his lectures given at Trinity.<br>
