<span class="headword">Dillwyn,  (Elizabeth) Amy</span>  (1845&#150;1935), <span class="occ">novelist and businesswoman</span>, was born at Parc Wern, Sketty, Swansea, on 16 May 1845, the second daughter and third child in the family of three daughters and one son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47114/', "Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn (1814&#150;1892)")</script>, an industrialist and Liberal MP for Swansea (1855&#150;92), and his wife, Elizabeth (Bessie) De la Beche (1819&#150;1866), the only legitimate daughter of the geologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1891/', "Sir Henry Thomas De la Beche")</script>. She was the granddaughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7670/', "Lewis Weston Dillwyn")</script>, owner of the famous Cambrian pottery, and great-granddaughter of William Dillwyn, the American Quaker abolitionist. Educated privately at home by tutors and governesses, first at Parc Wern and later at Hendrefoilan, her father's new mansion at Sketty, she inherited a long family tradition of unorthodox and innovative ideas. Shortly after her d&eacute;but in London society in 1863 she became engaged to Llewellyn Thomas of Llwynmadog, the heir to a large coal fortune, but his early death from smallpox in 1864 on the eve of their wedding left her to face a lifetime of spinsterhood and good works, divided between Swansea and her London home in fashionable Knightsbridge.<br>
<br>Bored with the formalities of mid-Victorian high society, scornfully documented in her private diaries, Amy Dillwyn sought refuge in a form of neurasthenia and turned her hand to writing popular fiction, producing half a dozen still very readable novels which reflected her rebellious discontent with women's role as second-class citizens in a world often dominated by relatively untalented men. <span class="italic">Chloe Arguelle</span> (1881) and <span class="italic">Jill and Jack</span> (1887) are typical examples of her ability to combine trenchant social criticism with a positive affirmation of women's rights. Having thus resigned herself to the passive lifestyle of a semi-invalid literary lady, she became a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, then edited by her father's close friend Richard Holt Hutton, and between 1880 and 1893 published over fifty articles in it. But when her father, the widely respected leader of the Welsh radicals in parliament, died suddenly in 1892 she found to her horror that he had left a crippling burden of debt and that his principal business enterprise, the Dillwyn spelterworks at Llansamlet, Swansea, was on the verge of financial ruin and was now her personal responsibility as his residuary legatee.<br>
<br>Determined to honour the family tradition of social concern, Amy Dillwyn forgot her various ailments, put aside her unfinished literary manuscripts, and took on the onerous commitment of managing one of the most important zinc factories in the United Kingdom at a time when women were virtually excluded from the board-rooms of industry and commerce. After several years of sheer hard work and dedicated self-sacrifice, which involved giving up her fine home, Hendrefoilan House, and living in cheap lodgings, she finally turned the ailing enterprise around and by 1904 was able to sell her shares in Dillwyn &amp; Co. at a very substantial profit to Metallgesellschaft of Frankfurt, the German industrial giant then striving to create an international monopoly of zinc manufacture.<br>
<br>By 1902 Amy Dillwyn's fame as a hard-headed businesswoman, capable of holding her own with the shrewdest of her male rivals in the intensely competitive world of industry, had already won her recognition (from the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>) as &#145;one of the most remarkable women in Great Britain&#146;, famous enough to be caricatured by the <span class="italic">Punch</span> cartoonist Bert Thomas in the comic journal <span class="italic">Ally Sloper</span> in 1904. For a brief period she became a national celebrity, often portrayed by her contemporaries as a spare, bespectacled woman wearing the plainest of short serge skirts with a pocket on each side in which she buried her hands when talking, a short, rather mannish jacket, a trilby hat, and a simple bunch of violets at her throat, and carrying a stick or umbrella and striding out in a thoroughly businesslike manner. Staunchly Liberal like her father and an ardent but always non-violent feminist, she campaigned vigorously for women's rights, fought hard to improve rudimentary state education and medical services, and was one of the first women to stand for election to a borough council after the passing of the <span class="roman">Qualification of Women Act</span> in 1907. By this time she was consciously beginning to play the role that most appealed to her ironic sense of self-awareness: the rather eccentric and certainly unorthodox grand old lady of her native Swansea, whose celebrated love of a good cigar, smoked in public, masked a deep attachment to the humanitarian principles instilled into her by her Quaker family background. Yet for all her passionate dedication to public service she also knew how to enjoy herself, and as an elderly lady she was often seen at the gaming tables of Monte Carlo in the late 1920s, savouring to the full the social pleasures made possible by her unique commercial success.<br>
<br>Amy Dillwyn died in her ninety-first year at her home, T&#375;-Glyn, West Cross, Swansea, on 13 December 1935, leaving a personal fortune of &pound;114,500&#151;striking testimony to her rare achievement as a businesswoman in a man's world. She was cremated without ceremony at Pontypridd, and her ashes were laid to rest in the Dillwyn family grave at St Paul's Church, Sketty, Swansea.<br>
