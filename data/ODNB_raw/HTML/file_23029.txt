<span class="headword">Rainolds <span class="st"> [Reynolds]</span>,  John</span>  (1549&#150;1607), <span class="occ">theologian and college head</span>, was born on 29 September 1549 in Pinhoe, Devon, the fifth of six sons of Richard Rainolds, a prosperous farmer. His uncle Thomas Rainolds (<i>d</i>. 1559) held numerous church positions as well as serving as warden of Merton College, Oxford, from 1545 to 1559 and vice-chancellor of the university from 1556 to 1557. His eldest brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23030/', "William Rainolds (1544?&#150;1594)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation15491572"></a>Early years and education, 1549&#150;1572</h2>All of Richard Rainolds's sons studied at Oxford University, and five of them held fellowships there. John Rainolds appears to have been sent to Oxford at eight, for an exhibition at Oriel College was bestowed on him on 11 December 1557. In all likelihood he was dispatched there so that Thomas Rainolds might oversee his education. However, as his uncle was ejected from Merton College following Elizabeth I's accession to the throne in November 1558 and imprisoned in the Marshalsea, John Rainolds was probably sent back home. He returned to Oxford in 1562, this time as a student of Merton College, but on 29 April 1563 he was admitted <i>discipulus</i> to Corpus Christi College, where his brothers Jerome and Edmund Rainolds were already fellows.<br>
<br>Upon his arrival at Oxford John Rainolds had been a Catholic, as were his father, his uncle, and his two brothers at Corpus. His conversion to protestantism was gradual and perhaps not completed until the late 1560s. According to Peter Heylin, he also studied in one of the English seminaries on the continent and, if true, this might explain why he was admitted a second time to Corpus on 12 February 1564 and why it took him five and a half years to complete his undergraduate course, for he graduated BA only on 15 October 1568. In any event, Rainolds appears to have been continually in residence by 1564. During Elizabeth's visit to Oxford (30 August to 3 September 1566), Rainolds presented her with verses and acted the part of the woman Hippolyta in the production at Christ Church of Richard Edward's <span class="italic">Palaemon and Arcyte</span>. Judging by the vehemence with which he criticized stage plays a quarter of a century later, this experience left an indelible impression on him. At the time, however, Rainolds's efforts were rewarded handsomely, and eight years later, when he presented Elizabeth with his translation of Plutarch's <span class="italic">De utilitate ex hostibus capienda</span> (BL, Royal MS 15 A. iii), he recalled her generosity towards him on that occasion.<br>
<br>Six weeks later, on 11 October 1566, Rainolds was elected probationary fellow of Corpus. His election coincided with the visitation of the college by George Acworth, chancellor and commissary to Robert Horne, bishop of Winchester, who investigated serious charges against Jerome Rainolds, which included not only his persistent adherence to Catholicism, but his concealment of church plate, vestments, and various chapel furniture as well as his conspiring to alienate certain college property. Jerome Rainolds's countercharges against the college president, Thomas Greenway, were dismissed, and he was expelled with two other fellows. In July 1568 it was Edmund Rainolds's turn to be expelled from the college, for the role he played in opposing the installation of William Cole as the new president.<br>
<br>The extent to which John Rainolds sympathized with his brothers' religious and collegiate politics is not known. However, it was during that very period that his metamorphosis into puritanism occurred. William Alabaster, the Latin poet who had himself shifted from protestantism to Catholicism and back again, recounted in memorable verse how John and his then zealous Calvinist brother William Rainolds proselytized each other. It is often assumed that such an account of a mutual conversion is either apocryphal or a mistaken embellishment by Alabaster of the documented public disputation between John and his other brother Edmund Rainolds held during a visit of Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, to Oxford almost twenty years later in January 1585. It should be noted, however, that Alabaster makes no mention of any spectacular public disputation and seems rather to use the battle imagery to invoke the far more drawn-out, painful, and private process of soul-searching that undoubtedly characterized the relations between members of the Rainolds family in general, and the eventual conversions of John and William Rainolds in particular. By whatever means the conversion occurred, by 1569 the gifted John Rainolds had sufficiently demonstrated his protestant credentials to be entrusted with the tutorship of Richard Hooker.<h2>
<a name="Greekreaderandlecturer15721580"></a>Greek reader and lecturer, 1572&#150;1580</h2>Rainolds graduated MA on 14 July 1572, and shortly thereafter was elected Greek reader at Corpus. The lectureship was open to the university public at large and his lectures proved very popular. He began with Aristotle's <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span>, and the text of these lectures survives in the form of notes for two complete sets: the first on the <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> alone, the second on dialectic and rhetoric. Both can be found with Rainolds's working copy of the Greek edition of the <span class="italic">Rhetoric</span> (1562). The lectures represent an advanced critical examination not only of Aristotle's rhetorical theory, but also of the relations between language, the passions, and the probity of the (Christian) orator. While the content of Rainolds's lectures during the latter part of his six years' tenure is not known, the exhortatory orations he was in the habit of delivering at the beginning of each term survive, and these further attest to his commitment to Christian humanism, though his endorsement of profane literature and philosophy is somewhat qualified by his nascent radical Calvinist sensibilities. These orations proved very popular and were printed several times, and in various forms, during the first half of the seventeenth century. Rainolds's lectures were also important in occasioning the rise of the short-lived erudite and ornamental literary style known as euphuism.<br>
<br>Rainolds resigned the lectureship so that he could devote himself to the study of theology, but he immediately became embroiled in a controversy over his successor. The choice fell on John Spenser, who was then only nineteen and not yet a master of arts. Rainolds judged the youth, who was neither a fellow nor even a scholar of the college, inexperienced&#151;though not necessarily incompetent&#151;for the task that he himself had performed with such distinction. He launched a public campaign to annul the election, appealing to both the visitor of the college, Horne, and to Sir Francis Walsingham&#151;but in vain.<br>
<br>No sooner was the controversy settled than a far more divisive strife broke out. Towards the end of 1579 it was strongly rumoured that Cole was about to resign his office, and Rainolds became one of the two contenders for the position. His rival, John Barefoot, had been vice-president for the previous decade and, in addition, was backed by both Leicester and his brother, Ambrose Dudley, earl of Warwick. Rainolds was supported by Walsingham as well as by many members of the university who considered him by far the abler candidate. Though Leicester soon came round to support Rainolds, neither Barefoot nor Warwick gave way, and the ensuing impasse was resolved only by Cole's decision to remain president. The enraged Barefoot, however, in his capacity as vice-president, immediately expelled Rainolds, Hooker, and three other fellows on the grounds of infraction of college statutes. Fortunately for Rainolds, his powerful patrons quickly arranged for an <i>en bloc</i> reinstatement.<br>
<br>In the meantime Rainolds emerged in the forefront of the puritan party at Oxford. In addition to allying himself with Cole's reforming party at Corpus, in university politics Rainolds aligned himself with Laurence Humphrey. In 1575 he appears to have taken an active role in expelling Francesco Pucci, the opinionated Italian &eacute;migr&eacute; who, with the support of Leicester, the chancellor of the university, petitioned for a licence to teach at Oxford while publicly denouncing key Calvinist doctrines. Rainolds led the university opposition against conferring, at Leicester's request, the degree of DTh on the Spaniard Antonio del Corro who, as Rainolds wrote to Humphrey on 7 June 1576, was actually Pucci's mentor. Rainolds protested that Corro's deliberately obscure writings concealed &#145;verie great heresies about predestination and justification by faith&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.182), and beseeched Humphrey to be as firm in refusing Corro's degree as he had been with Pucci. Three weeks earlier Rainolds had also been licensed to preach and at a later date, was ordained by Edmund Freake, bishop of Norwich.<h2>
<a name="Worksanddisputations15801598"></a>Works and disputations, 1580&#150;1598</h2>Rainolds resigned his Greek lectureship, he later explained, so that he could devote himself to studying divinity. He was admitted BTh on 24 January 1580, having been chosen as respondent in the theology act of 13 July 1579, in the course of which he maintained three of the required six theses for the degree, completing his requirements four months later. The theses, exhibiting strong anti-Catholic sentiments and firm Calvinist attitudes on matters of scripture and the church, were immediately sent to press, appearing in March 1580 as <span class="italic">Sex theses de sacra scriptura et ecclesia</span>.<br>
<br>Having thus distinguished himself, Rainolds was charged the following year by Walsingham with the task of disputing with John Hart, an English Catholic who was to be executed alongside Edmund Campion on 1 December 1581. Shortly before the execution Hart recanted and was spared, but he soon reaffirmed his Catholic convictions and Walsingham sent him to Oxford, purposely to confer with Rainolds on the divisions between the English and Catholic churches, hoping thereby to offset the infelicitous outcome of the earlier debates between Campion and several protestant theologians. There followed a long series of conferences between Rainolds and Hart, first at Oxford and then in London. Despite his continued obstinacy, Hart finally conceded on one cardinal issue: the supremacy of the pope over secular rulers. Having been promised a reprieve from execution and banishment from England instead, Hart agreed to subscribe his name to the transcript of the debates that Rainolds prepared, which was published in 1584 as <span class="italic">The summe of the conference betweene John Rainoldes and John Hart: touching the head and the faith of the church</span>, with a dedication to Leicester. The book proved quite influential, and during the following quarter of a century it was reprinted four more times in English, and twice in Latin.<br>
<br>Partly to reward him, and partly in order to continue channelling his proven disputatious skills against the Catholic church, Walsingham resolved in 1586 to endow at Oxford a special lectureship in controversial theology earmarked for Rainolds&#151;who had in the meantime been licensed for the degree of DTh on 14 June 1585&#151;and convocation readily acquiesced. Walsingham promised to pay Rainolds &pound;20 per annum and the latter, weary of the continued dissensions at Corpus, availed himself of the opportunity and resigned his fellowship in 1588, moving to Queen's College, where the provost, Henry Robinson, arranged room and board for him. Rainolds reciprocated by taking an active part in teaching at Queen's.<br>
<br>Rainolds lectured three times a week during term, drawing consistently large audiences: &#145;never were any lectures in our memory so frequented as these in that university&#146;, wrote Daniel Featley, &#145;nor any in Cambridge, save those of Dr. [William] Whitaker&#146;  (<span class="italic">Abel redivivus</span>, 2.226). The lectures specifically targeted the Jesuit Robert Bellarmine, then a professor of theology at the Gregorian University in Rome. Walsingham instructed his agents at Rome to send him transcripts of the lectures that Bellarmine delivered there and, upon arrival, they were forwarded to Rainolds for immediate public rebuttal. Of particular interest to Rainolds was the refutation of Bellarmine's attempt to make the Apocryphal books an integral part of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> canon. True to his style and thoroughness, however, Rainolds left no stone unturned as he battled the Jesuit. The 250 lectures were not published during Rainolds's lifetime, but appeared in 1611 in two enormous quarto volumes under the title <span class="italic">Censura librorum apocryphorum veteris testamenti</span>.<br>
<br>In 1589 Rainolds also devoted a set of lectures to refute Hugh Broughton's <span class="italic">A Concent of Scripture</span> (1588). In his book the talented, though eccentric and opinionated, Broughton claimed to have constructed an exact chronology, based solely on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, from Adam to Christ. Both Rainolds at Oxford and Edward Lively&#151;regius professor of Hebrew at Cambridge University&#151;had strong reservations concerning the plausibility and value of such an exercise, and they took Broughton to task in 1589. Relying on scriptures as well as on many &#145;heathen&#146; authors, Rainolds pointed out various errors in Broughton's chronology. The latter, who was not the sort of person to take criticism lightly, was highly offended, especially since the objections of his formidable opponents seemed to have carried the day with university members as well as with many bishops. For the better part of the following decade, therefore, the irascible Broughton waged a stubborn campaign against Rainolds. He first attempted to force the Oxford scholar into submission through a series of conferences with him. Having failed in that, Broughton excoriated Rainolds in lectures he delivered in Stationers' Hall in London. At the same time he resorted to a campaign of letters and pamphlets addressed to, among others, the queen, William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and John Whitgift, archbishop of Canterbury. However, though Whitgift remained unwavering in his support of Rainolds's position, he was reluctant to allow the latter to publish his lectures against Broughton. It was not until 1631 that a modified version of some of these lectures was published by William Pemble.<br>
<br>While the debate with Broughton was still raging, Rainolds became inadvertently involved in a very different sort of controversy. In early February 1592 he was invited by Thomas Thornton of Christ Church to attend the performance of one of three plays by William Gager that the college staged between and 6 and 8 February. Rainolds, who was known for his objection even to academic drama, refused and when Thornton persisted he sent him a detailed letter enumerating his objections. For his part, Gager added to the last play in the series, a rendition of Seneca's <span class="italic">Hippolytus</span>, a speech spoken by Momus&#151;highly suggestive of Rainolds&#151;which was then promptly refuted in the epilogue. Gager immediately proceeded to publish both Momus's speech and his defence of academic drama as an appendix to his <span class="italic">Ulysses Redux</span>, sending Rainolds a complimentary copy in May 1592. An epistolary exchange between the two ensued, lasting until the following summer, at which time Alberico Gentili, regius professor of civil law, stepped in to take Gager's place. The main issues remained the same from the start&#151;primarily Rainolds's claims of the unlawfulness of men wearing women's garb, his objections to breaching the sabbath, and the more generally puritan beliefs of the moral obloquy of plays and actors&#151;but it quickly turned into an exercise of erudition and, with Gentili, it also descended into personal abuse. Again, Rainolds was apparently prohibited from publishing his letters, but in 1599 the puritan printing press of Richard Schilders at Middelburg in the Netherlands published <span class="italic">Th'Overthrow of Stage-Playes, by the Way of Controversie betwixt D. Gager and D. Rainoldes</span>, which included Rainolds's detailed letters to Gager as well as part of his exchange with Gentili.<br>
<br>Walsingham did not intend personally to support Rainolds in perpetuity, nor to endow the lectureship. As he wrote in 1586 to Sir Thomas Bromley, the acting chancellor of the university, he would pay Rainolds a salary until he &#145;maie be otherwise better called and enabled to doe good either there or elswhere oute of that Place&#146;  (Corpus Christi College, Oxford, MS 303, fol. 137). One such opportunity occurred in spring 1589, when the ailing Humphrey stepped down as regius professor of theology. On 9 May convocation petitioned the new chancellor, Sir Christopher Hatton, to appoint Rainolds as Humphrey's successor but, despite widespread support for such an appointment, Elizabeth would not consent and Thomas Holland was appointed instead. Walsingham died on 6 April 1590, but his son-in-law, Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, took over supporting Rainolds's lectureship. Rainolds, however, was hoping for a more permanent arrangement. During 1593 fresh efforts were made to secure a church position for Cole that would facilitate Rainolds's election as president of Corpus. This time it was Anne Dudley, dowager countess of Warwick, who championed Rainolds's cause by attempting to secure for Cole the post of dean of Lincoln. But the queen remained obstinate in her refusal to allow for Rainolds's promotion within the university.<br>
<br>Elizabeth's objections stemmed from the continued extremism of Rainolds, who participated in several presbyterian meetings during the mid-1580s as well as becoming known for some radical preaching in Oxford. Equally alarming were his writings in support of various Calvinist positions which were at variance with the official position of the English church. Thus, for example, Rainolds was mobilized by Sir Francis Knollys to respond to Richard Bancroft's St Paul's sermon of 19 February 1589, in which the latter argued for the divine origin of episcopacy. Rainolds complied not only by refuting Bancroft's claim, but also by insisting that in upholding his own position he could not be considered a heretic. A year or two later Rainolds wrote a short treatise concerning the lawfulness of divorce and remarriage following adultery, and about the same time he challenged the established interpretation&#151;embraced by Whitgift, and later by Thomas Bilson, bishop of Winchester&#151;according to which Christ descended into hell in body as well as in soul, arguing instead that this descent was made only by the body of Christ, while the pains of hell were inflicted on Christ's soul only on the cross. Needless to add, none of these opinions was published during Rainolds's lifetime, though they were widely circulated in manuscript. Small wonder, then, that when Elizabeth visited Oxford in September 1592, she &#145;schooled Doctor Reynalds for his precisenes, willing him to follow her lawes and not to run before them&#146;  (J. Harrington, <span class="italic">A Supplie or Addicion to the Catalogue of Bishops to the Year 1608</span>, ed. R. H. Miller, Potomac, MD, 1979, 134).<br>
<br>What Elizabeth wanted, clearly, was for Rainolds to accept a position in the church. Cognizant of his stature, Elizabeth was loath to enhance Rainolds's influence at Oxford while a position in the church, by its very nature, would bring him much more in line with official religious policy. Indeed, the very acceptance of such a post would amount to a public declaration of conformity to the Church of England. Rainolds's patrons recognized the situation and convinced him to accept the deanery of Lincoln (he was appointed on 10 December 1593). Though he acquiesced, Rainolds remained resident in Oxford, invoking various technicalities in delaying his move. Only in 1598 was he finally installed as dean&#151;and by then it was already certain that his patrons had managed to arrange for an exchange of positions with Cole. Rainolds was elected president on 11 December 1598.<h2>
<a name="PresidentofCorpusChristiandfinalyears15981607"></a>President of Corpus Christi and final years, 1598&#150;1607</h2>The nine years of Rainolds's presidency greatly altered the fortunes of Corpus. Cole turned over to him a college plagued by internal conflicts and financial difficulties, and Rainolds set to work to rectify the situation. He introduced a more equitable system of distributing college revenues, which benefited the fellows as well as the college and allowed for the renovation of the hall, chapel, and library. The improved fortunes of the college also resulted in an increase in the number of students, who were subjected to the firm academic and religious discipline that Rainolds introduced.<br>
<br>With the accession of James I in 1603 Rainolds, like most English puritans, was buoyed by the hope that the new monarch would look more favourably upon the reformation of the English church. Indeed, he even contributed some verses to an Oxford volume commemorating James's accession&#151;something he had not done for nearly forty years. In April 1603, while <i>en route</i> for London, James was presented with the celebrated millenary petition, in which the puritans set down their grievances against the established church. The relatively moderate tone of the petition worked well upon the new monarch, who soon announced his intention to hold a conference, over which he would preside, in which all grievances and disputes between the bishops and the puritans could be aired openly. The conference was scheduled for 14&#150;18 January 1604 and Rainolds's name appeared on every list of puritan candidates that had been circulated the previous summer and autumn. When the historic occasion arrived, it was he who led the puritan delegation, which also included Laurence Chaderton, Thomas Sparke, and John Knewstub. Rainolds did most of the speaking, while Chaderton and Sparke were &#145;mute as any fish&#146;. The outcome was disappointing, for though James listened favourably to the arguments against non-residency and consented to improve the state of preachers, he had no intention of compromising on matters of church discipline and ceremonies. Ultimately Rainolds's recommendation that the king establish a synod of bishops and presbyters to determine contested issues in the church so infuriated James that he brought the audience to a close, snapping &#145;No bishop, no king&#146; and leaving the room.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of the conference, especially following Bancroft's elevation to the archbishopric of Canterbury, great pressure was brought to bear upon Rainolds to subscribe to the new book of canons. However, Rainolds put up a fight, using his old delaying tactics. He resorted to writing numerous letters to clarify his religious views in the hope that he would thereby privately satisfy the king and Bancroft in his conformity without the need to endure public subscription. Such a ploy was evidently successful, for it was not until the summer of 1605 that he was pushed for an immediate submission. No doubt the reason for this pressure was the impending visit of James to Oxford, scheduled for late August 1605. The king arrived at Oxford on 27 August, and Rainolds was one of the lecturers chosen in his honour. James was apparently determined to force the obstinate and slippery president of Corpus into submission, and he instructed the vice-chancellor, George Abbot, to set Rainolds a deadline for submission, making it clear that failure to comply would lead to expulsion from the university. Rainolds, however, wrote a few more letters and, in the end, appears to have withstood the pressure.<br>
<br>By the time the subscription controversy subsided Rainolds was in failing health. Conscious of this, he tried to proceed in what he clearly regarded as the most important project of his career&#151;and the only tangible result of the Hampton Court conference&#151;the new translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. The task was divided among six groups, and Rainolds was part of the one charged with translating both major and minor prophets. Although officially headed by John Harding, the regius professor of Hebrew, the group met at Rainolds's lodgings at Corpus three times a week, a practice that continued even during the last weeks of the president's life. It is difficult to judge just how far the translation of the Oxford group proceeded before Rainolds's death, but it appears that most of the work was accomplished, even though officially the task was completed only in 1609.<br>
<br>Rainolds died on Thursday 21 May 1607 of consumption. He had been in poor health for at least twenty years&#151;suffering mostly from gout&#151;and by the end of his life he was emaciated. His funeral on 25 May was attended by many drawn from all quarters of the university, as well as by the mayor and aldermen of Oxford, and he was mourned both at home and abroad. He was buried on 25 May in the college chapel where his pupil and successor, John Spenser, raised a monument to him. Rainolds left his large collection of books to various colleges and to friends. He did not marry. Joseph Hall, who seized the occasion to lament the great loss in recent years of eminent protestant divines such as William Fulke, William Whitaker, Hadrianus Junius, and Theodore Beza, added:<blockquote>Doctor Reynolds is the last; not in worth, but in the time of his loss. He alone was a well-furnished library, full of all faculties, full of all studies, of all learning; the memory, the reading of that man, were near to a miracle. (<span class="italic">The Works of the Right Reverend Joseph Hall</span>, ed. P. Wynter, 10 vols., 1863, 6.149&#150;50)</blockquote>In Leiden, Joseph Scaliger mourned the loss of not only a profoundly erudite scholar but a towering pillar of the reformed churches, writing on the subject in his <span class="italic">Illustriss. viri Iosephi Scaligeri &hellip; epistolae</span> (1627). That Rainolds's reputation remained high throughout the seventeenth century is manifest by the publication of many of his manuscripts, as well as by the frequency with which his judgement was invoked on both sides of the religious divide.<br>
