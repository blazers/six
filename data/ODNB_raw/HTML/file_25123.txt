<span class="headword">Seton,  George</span>, fifth earl of Winton  (<em>b. </em>before 1679, <em>d.</em> 1749), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, was born at Seton, the first and only surviving son of George Seton, fourth earl of Winton (1642&#150;1704), and Christian (<i>d</i>. 1703), daughter of John Hepburn of Alderston. Raised in the Episcopal Church of Scotland, he succeeded to the title on the death of his father on 6 March 1704, but having gone abroad in June 1700 after a family quarrel did not return to Scotland until 1 November 1707. The issue of the succession was not a straightforward one as Seton had been born before the marriage of his parents. The marriage was established as lawful and Seton legitimated by the court of session in 1710. That declaration defeated any claim by the second Viscount Kingston, who had intruded himself into the Seton estates in 1705.<br>
<br>Winton showed his family's traditional loyalty to the Stuarts when, in 1715, he raised a troop of 300 horse and on 11 October joined Viscount Kenmure at Moffat in support of the Jacobite rising. During the campaign he advised Kenmure to move to the west of Scotland with a view to opening communication with the forces of the earl of Mar. This advice was in contrast to that proffered by Northumberland supporters of the Pretender (James Stuart), who advised marching into England. Despite this advice, Winton was persuaded to take part in the march into England and was captured at Preston on 14 November 1715. He was taken to London together with William, earl of Nithsdale, Robert, earl of Carnwath, William, Viscount Kenmure, and William, Lord Nairne. They were impeached before parliament in January 1716, and when Winton replied to the articles of impeachment he alone pleaded not guilty. At his trial, which took place in Westminster Hall in March 1716, he was found guilty of high treason and condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, and his titles and lands to be forfeited. Three years later his estates would be sold to the York Buildings Company for &pound;50,300. Winton's sentence came in spite of an able defence conducted by Sir Constantine Phipps, who &#145;advised him, as the only plea he had, to act the madman, and &hellip; he performed it to the life&#146;  (L. Inese to the duke of Mar, 3 Oct 1716, <span class="italic">Stuart Papers</span>, 3.15). The sentence of death was never carried out because, according to one account, Seton escaped from the Tower of London in a hamper  (Seton, 1.272). From London he travelled to Calais, arriving on 18 September 1716. On joining the Pretender at Avignon in January 1717 he was granted a pension of 2000 livres a month, which was paid to him until his death. He moved to Rome and was admitted to the masonic lodge there on 16 August 1735. He became grand master in April 1736, holding office until the suppression of the lodge by Clement XII in August 1737.<br>
<br>There is no evidence that Seton was ever married to Margaret Maclear  (Seton, 2.1006&#150;9), but they had a son, Charles, who was born in 1711 and died in 1781. Seton died, aged over seventy, in Rome on 19 December 1749, and was buried near the Porta del Popolo.<br>
