<span class="headword">Cecil, Lord  Edward Herbert  Gascoyne-</span>  (1867&#150;1918), <span class="occ">army officer and administrator</span>, was born in London on 12 July 1867, the fourth son and sixth of eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32339/', "Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, third marquess of Salisbury (1830&#150;1903)")</script>, prime minister, and his wife, Georgina Caroline (1827&#150;1899), daughter of Sir Edward Hall Alderson and his wife, Georgina Drewe. Known to his family as Nigs, and to friends as Ned, Edward Cecil was educated privately and at Eton College, and was commissioned in the Grenadier Guards in 1887. On 18 June 1894 he married Violet Georgina [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35039/', "Milner, Violet (1872&#150;1958)")</script>], the brilliant daughter of Admiral Frederick Augustus Maxse. He was aide-de-camp to Lord Wolseley in Ireland and from 1896 to Sir Horatio Kitchener, then sirdar (commander-in-chief) of the Egyptian army, who valued the intermediary role Cecil could play with his father in pressing for the reconquest of the Sudan. Cecil served in the Dongola campaign and, in 1897, accompanied the Rodd mission to Abyssinia. He was present at Kitchener's decisive victory over the Sudanese Mahdists at Omdurman in September 1898. His ensuing service in South Africa was spent almost entirely under siege at Mafeking. Sir Reginald Wingate, newly appointed to succeed Kitchener as sirdar and governor-general of the Sudan, thereafter persuaded Cecil to join the Egyptian army and the Sudan government, and appointed him to the important if ill-defined post of Sudan agent in Cairo. There Cecil's administrative abilities were recognized by Lord Cromer, the famous pro-consul, who made him successively under-secretary for war and under-secretary for finance in the Egyptian government.<br>
<br>Between 1907, when Cromer was succeeded by Sir Eldon Gorst, and 1911, when Kitchener returned to Egypt as agent and consul-general, Cecil endured a disagreeable eclipse. In 1912, however, his years of efficient administration were rewarded with his appointment as financial adviser to the Egyptian government, the second position in the byzantine hierarchy of British Egypt. With the outbreak of war in 1914 Cecil's personal authority was further enhanced; during the interregnum caused by Kitchener's appointment as secretary of state for war and, indeed, during the ensuing high commissionership of Sir Henry McMahon, who was without Egyptian experience, Cecil was pre-eminent.<br>
<br>The death of Kitchener in 1916 and succession of Wingate as high commissioner led to Cecil's departure from Egypt. Wingate challenged the powerful financial adviser who, after repeated political and personal disagreements, finally resigned in 1918, ostensibly for war service in Europe. But Cecil was ill in any case, with what was eventually diagnosed as tuberculosis. He spent most of the last year of his life in a sanatorium at Leysin in Switzerland, where he died in the Grand Hotel at midnight on 13&#150;14 December 1918.<br>
<br>Edward Cecil was an important figure in Anglo-Egyptian history. Willingly overshadowed by a succession of imperial grandees&#151;Cromer, Kitchener, Wingate&#151;he epitomized the competent stewardship that has since been hailed as Britain's most notable achievement in Egypt. That he was unhappy in his personal life&#151;his marriage soon broke down, and the couple lived apart for most of their marriage&#151;may account for a single-minded devotion to his work. He found fault more easily than pleasure in his eastern postings, though ironically is remembered for <span class="italic">The Leisure of an Egyptian Official</span>, the sometimes smug and acerbic sketches written only for his own and his friends' amusement, which was published by his widow in 1921. There were two children of the marriage: George, who was killed in action during the First World War, and Helen, who married the second Baron Hardinge of Penhurst.<br>
