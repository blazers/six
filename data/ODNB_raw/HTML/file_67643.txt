<span class="headword">Harwood,  Elizabeth Jean</span>  (1938&#150;1990), <span class="occ">singer</span>, was born on 27 May 1938 at Hawnby, Markton Lane, Barton Seagrave, Kettering, Northamptonshire, the daughter of Sydney Curtis Harwood, local government officer, and his wife, Constance Read. Her mother had herself been a professional soprano (after studies at the Royal Academy of Music, London) and gave Elizabeth her first childhood singing lessons. Harwood was educated at Skipton Girls' High School and went on to the Royal Manchester College of Music, the family having moved to Yorkshire. As a vocal student there of Elsie Thurston she was encouraged by the college principal, Frederic Cox, to involve herself in opera; he had recognized that with her alluring blonde glamour and outgoing personality Harwood, a soprano, was a &#145;natural&#146; for the stage.<br>
<br>After graduating in 1960 Harwood won the Kathleen Ferrier memorial prize and joined the Glyndebourne Festival Chorus, making her d&eacute;but there as Second Boy in Mozart's <span class="italic">Die Zauberfl&ouml;te</span>. In the following year she was engaged by Sadler's Wells Opera in London, where she was first cast in coloratura roles and won success as Gilda (<span class="italic">Rigoletto</span>), Zerbinetta (<span class="italic">Ariadne auf Naxos</span>), and Constanze (<span class="italic">Die Entf&uuml;hrung aus dem Serail</span>). Colin Davis, then music director of the company, was a strong influence on her stage development, while audiences much enjoyed the sense of fun she regularly imparted in her singing.<br>
<br>Harwood's international reputation developed after she was joint winner of the 1963 international Verdi competition at Busseto, Italy, and in 1965 she toured Australia in starring roles with the Sutherland&#150;Williamson company, an <i>ad hoc</i> ensemble formed primarily to showcase Joan Sutherland's return to her native country as an international celebrity and for whom Harwood was engaged as the alternate soprano for specific performances. These included the title role in <span class="italic">Lucia di Lammermoor</span> (Donizetti) and the leading roles in <span class="italic">La sonnambula</span> (Bellini) and <span class="italic">L'elisir d'amore</span> (Donizetti), parts that Harwood then also sang after her return to England. In the year after the Australia tour, on 15 January 1966, she married Julian Adam Christopher Royle (<i>b</i>. 1937/8), a company director, with whom she shared a happy home life in the Essex countryside, becoming an accomplished horsewoman and keen swimmer. They had a son.<br>
<br>During the next decade Harwood was probably heard at her best, although not always on first nights, while recurring throat infections forced her to cancel some performances altogether. She nevertheless became a famously memorable partner to Janet Baker in productions of <span class="italic">Cos&igrave; fan tutte</span> and <span class="italic">Der Rosenkavalier</span> for Scottish Opera (their complementary eloquence and style in both Mozart and Richard Strauss were an enduring memory). Harwood further enhanced her reputation with engagements at the major festivals of Aix-en-Provence in 1967&#150;9, while also making her Covent Garden d&eacute;but in 1968 as the Fiakermilli in <span class="italic">Arabella</span> (Strauss). Here she went on to sing Gilda, Teresa in <span class="italic">Benvenuto Cellini</span> (Berlioz), and, in a rare excursion into contemporary opera, Bella in <span class="italic">The Midsummer Marriage</span> (Tippett).<br>
<br>At Aix-en-Provence Harwood was heard in <span class="italic">Don Giovanni</span> by the conductor Herbert von Karajan, who engaged her for the prestigious Salzburg Festival in 1970; she regularly returned there until 1976, mainly singing Mozart roles. Meanwhile she made her d&eacute;but at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, in 1972 as Fiordiligi (<span class="italic">Cos&igrave; fan tutte</span>), and returned there in subsequent seasons, also making successful guest appearances in Hamburg, Stuttgart, and Paris and at La Scala, Milan. In 1975 she captured Viennese hearts as Rosalinde in <span class="italic">Die Fledermaus</span>, and even persuaded listeners that an Englishwoman could successfully become the quintessentially Viennese operetta heroine, Hannah Glawari, in the title role of Leh&aacute;r's <span class="italic">Die lustige Witwe</span> (<span class="italic">The Merry Widow</span>) with the recording she made under Herbert von Karajan, treasured by many for the infectious vocal character she brought to the role.<br>
<br>Harwood was often described as &#145;bubbly&#146;, an apt epithet for her offstage persona, which was warm and friendly, even to a professional critic whom she was not averse to accompanying to a concert that interested her. She also brought endearing vocal character to her varied oratorio and song performances, of which several recordings fortunately constitute a living legacy, and she liked to organize musical evenings at home as well as bringing the benefit of her experience to aspiring young singers, whom she greatly enjoyed musically &#145;mothering&#146;. She died after a long struggle against carcinomatosis and cancer of the breast at her home, Masonettes, Fryerning, Ingatestone, Essex, on 22 June 1990, aged fifty-two. Her husband survived her.<br>
