<span class="headword">Balliol,  Edward</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or after 1281, <em>d.</em> 1364), <span class="occ">claimant to the Scottish throne</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1209/', "John (John Balliol), king of Scots (c.1248x50&#150;1314)")</script>, and Isabel, daughter of John de Warenne, sixth earl of Surrey (<i>d</i>. 1304). He was probably born soon after their marriage, which took place before February 1281. He had a younger brother, Henry, who died in 1332.<h2>
<a name="Disinheritedprince"></a>Disinherited prince</h2>Little is known of Edward Balliol's early life. When in 1296 his father was forced to resign the throne of Scotland and was taken to England, Edward was taken with him; he was lodged at times in the household of the future Edward II and at times in the Tower. When, however, John was transferred in 1299 to papal custody in France, Edward was retained in England, though now in the care of his cousin John de Warenne, seventh earl of Surrey (<i>d</i>. 1347). He was still being held honourably in custody in 1310, when he was removed from his cousin's household to that of Thomas and Edmund, the brothers of Edward II. After his father's death he was allowed to take possession of the Balliol estates in France, and he appears to have stayed there, except for occasional visits to England. Although according to the Franco-Scottish treaty of 1295 he was to have married a niece of Philippe IV of France, nothing had come of this; nor was he ever to marry, probably because he never again enjoyed the secure status which alone could have commanded a bride of the rank to which he aspired.<br>
<br>It is possible that the obscure Soulis conspiracy against Robert I which was uncovered in 1320 was made on Balliol's behalf. Be that as it may, it is certain that in the late 1320s there were signs of interest being taken in England of the exile.<br>
<br>In 1325 Edward II's alienated queen, Isabella, and their son the future Edward III came to France, allegedly on diplomatic business. Already there were some nobles, notably Sir Henry de Beaumont, who had been &#145;disinherited&#146; by the Scots for their failure to follow Robert I and who were anxious to recover the Scottish lands to which they had a claim. They joined in Isabella's and Mortimer's successful invasion of England in 1326, and supported the campaign made in response to the Scottish invasion of the north of England in July and August of 1327. Balliol may have been there: he was expected in England in the middle of July, when a safe conduct was issued for him. But after the Scots escaped from the English attempt to entrap them it became clear that Isabella and Mortimer were contemplating a final peace, which became a reality in 1328.<br>
<br>This suited neither Balliol nor the &#145;disinherited&#146;, and some of the latter, now back in France, became involved in the resistance to the queen and her lover. When the rule of Isabella and Mortimer was ended by the coup of 1330 and power was taken by the young Edward III, Balliol's prospects rose. Robert I had died in 1329, and Scotland was now governed by Thomas Randolph, earl of Moray, as regent for the infant David II. Several visits to England are recorded at this period; ultimately, though Edward III was not prepared to intervene directly, he was prepared to tolerate an invasion of Scotland by Balliol and the &#145;disinherited&#146;, who were now committed to an attempt to establish Balliol as king of Scots. This was launched just after the death of the Scottish regent on 20 July 1332. The invasion found the Scots in some disarray and resulted in a remarkable and decisive victory at the battle of Dupplin Moor on 11 August. Balliol was crowned at Perth on 24 September; styling himself king of Scots, he proceeded to try to establish his authority.<h2>
<a name="KingofScots"></a>King of Scots</h2>At this stage Edward III had not finally decided upon his attitude towards the new king. If Balliol were king of Scots, Edward clearly assumed that he would hold Scotland as an English fief, and Balliol himself made proposals in November 1332 under which he was to do homage for Scotland and convey a large portion of the southern part of the country to direct English rule. He even suggested that he might marry Edward's sister Joan, who was still of an age to repudiate her marriage to David II. But Edward III also had in mind the possibility of taking direct control of Scotland himself, to which he believed he might be entitled, and this idea was put to a parliament at York, where it was coolly received. Events for the moment overtook any such schemes. After a successful skirmish at Roxburgh, in which the newly appointed guardian of Scotland, Sir Andrew Murray, was captured, Balliol retired to spend Christmas in what he thought of as security at Annan, near the ancestral Balliol lands in Galloway. Here he was surprised by a party headed by Sir Archibald Douglas and John Randolph, earl of Moray, and forced ignominiously to flee to England in total disarray. His brother Henry was killed in the fray.<br>
<br>Edward III was left with the choice of supporting the campaign in Scotland openly or of giving up any hopes he had of asserting his overlordship. Given his desire to make his own reputation after the failures of his father, there was no doubt which he would choose. His response was a full-scale invasion and siege of Berwick, originally taken by Edward I, but recovered by Robert I in 1318. This resulted in the crushing Scottish defeat at Halidon Hill on 19 July 1333 and the re-establishment of Balliol as king of Scots. He rapidly set about rewarding his supporters, who included some English nobles to whom he gave estates in Scotland. He also began to put together an administration, appointing William Bullock chamberlain and custodian of the castle of Cupar in Fife and at least one sheriff, Alan Lisle, who held office in Bute and Cowal. In the absence of records of its operations we have only scattered references to Balliol's officials, but it is clear that his government had great difficulty in functioning. He was able to hold a parliament at Holyrood in February 1334, in which he obtained confirmation of his arrangements with Edward III. This was followed by his formal performance of homage to the English king at Newcastle on 19 June; a week earlier he had ceded the sheriffdoms of Berwick, Roxburgh, Selkirk, Peebles, Dumfries, and the three parts of Lothian to Edward III. In the mean time the young David II and his queen had taken sanctuary in France, and they spent the next seven years at Ch&acirc;teau Gaillard in Normandy.<h2>
<a name="Gainsandlosses"></a>Gains and losses</h2>Despite Balliol's apparent success, his position remained uncertain. There were quarrels among the &#145;disinherited&#146;, whom he had restored to the estates they claimed in Scotland; and supporters of David II, particularly Robert the Steward in Ayrshire and Sir William Douglas in the south-west, were already mounting resistance. In August 1334 Balliol had to flee to Berwick, whence he sought further support from Edward III. It rapidly became clear that his regime could survive only with substantial English support, which for a time was forthcoming. Over Christmas 1334&#150;5 Edward III joined Balliol in a campaign to recover control of Roxburgh. For the moment it achieved little else, but plans were in hand for a larger effort the next summer, including, at Balliol's suggestion, an attack on the western seaboard from Ireland.<br>
<br>This followed in June 1335. Balliol, now at Newcastle, advanced without opposition up the east coast while Edward III, starting from Carlisle, marched through Nithsdale. The pincer movement was planned to close at Glasgow, which it did at the end of July. From there the two Edwards marched to Perth. In addition to Roxburgh and Lochmaben, garrisons were established at Stirling and Perth. The areas ceded in southern Scotland by the agreement of 1334 were taken into English control, and sheriffs established at Berwick, Edinburgh, and Dumfries. Many of those who had deserted Balliol the previous year returned to his allegiance, and even Robert the Steward is reported to have made his peace. The autumn of 1335 was the high water mark of Balliol's fortunes. Even so, he did not remain in Scotland. Instead he appointed one of the &#145;disinherited&#146;, David Strathbogie, titular earl of Atholl, as guardian on his behalf and, rather surprisingly in the circumstances, retired to spend the winter at Holy Island in Northumberland. Perhaps age was already taking its toll.<br>
<br>Resistance to Balliol continued, led chiefly by Sir Andrew Murray and Sir William Douglas, and on 30 November 1335 Murray defeated and killed Strathbogie at the battle of Culblean in south-west Aberdeenshire. This brought Edward III to Scotland in the autumn of 1336 on yet another campaign, in which he recovered and repaired Bothwell Castle in Lanarkshire, refortified Perth and left it with an English garrison, and sacked Aberdeen.<br>
<br>It was, however, to be Edward's last campaign in Scotland; his concerns now centred on France, and he left Scotland to others. Balliol's prospects consequently declined. In 1337 Andrew Murray campaigned successfully in Angus and Fife, recovering the castles of St Andrews and Leuchars, though not Cupar, and also recapturing and slighting Bothwell. English attempts to besiege Dunbar Castle in 1337 and 1338 failed. Balliol last appears at Perth in August 1338; thereafter he seems to have retired to the north of England, where in 1339 he was appointed commander of an English army against Scots who were invading the marches. Balliol's effective presence in Scotland had ended, and supporters of David II were left to get on with the task of removing the remaining English garrisons: Perth fell in 1339, Edinburgh in 1341, and Roxburgh and Stirling in 1342. In June 1341 David and his queen were able to return to their kingdom amid general rejoicing.<h2>
<a name="Declineresignationanddeath"></a>Decline, resignation, and death</h2>Balliol's impact on the history of Scotland after that time was limited. He stayed mainly in the north of England, receiving payment for his services from Edward III. In October 1339 a warrant was issued to pay the wages of 1264 men from Cumberland and Westmorland who were going to Scotland under the command of Balliol and others to raise the siege of Perth, but Perth had in fact surrendered on 17 August. Although at several points in the 1340s Balliol was appointed to command armies directed against the Scots, there is little evidence of his achievements. More is known about his impact on Galloway, where lay his ancestral lands. In August 1339 several important Galloway landowners had returned to the peace of Edward III, and Balliol, though unable to occupy his ancestral castle of Buittle at this point, seems to have been able to fortify Hestan Island off the coast of Kirkcudbrightshire. He left a garrison there under Duncan MacDowell, to which supplies were on several occasions ordered to be sent by Edward III. After the English victory at Nevilles Cross on 17 October 1346 Balliol again acted as commander of English armies reoccupying the south of Scotland; texts exist of documents granted by Balliol at Hestan Island in 1348 and at Buittle in 1352.<br>
<br>Balliol's usefulness to Edward III was declining. The latter came to recognize the desirability of reaching some arrangement with his captive, David II, if only terms could be agreed that suited Edward. To these negotiations, Balliol's insistence on his own rights in Scotland was an obstruction, and an obscure and partially coded memorandum, probably belonging to 1350, suggests that pressure was being brought on him to be more accommodating. By 1351 there was at least the prospect of an agreement between David and Edward III, and David was temporarily released to see if the Scots would agree to Edward's demands. At this point they would not, and David returned to captivity, but it was clear that Edward III was prepared to abandon any support for Balliol.<br>
<br>In 1356 Balliol was brought, on the plea of age and infirmity, to resign to Edward III all rights he had in the crown and kingdom of Scotland. He is said by Andrew Wyntoun to have called the Scotsmen &#145;ill and wicked&#146;, perhaps remembering his father's similar invective against his former subjects after he resigned the Scottish throne. In return for his surrender Balliol received an annuity of &pound;2000, on which he lived in retirement at Wheatley, near Doncaster, in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>Edward Balliol has generally been dismissed by Scottish historians as of little significance, but he showed considerable persistence and on occasions, as in his tactical advice to Edward III in 1336, also revealed some military capacity. His pension continued to be paid until he died, probably at Wheatley, in January 1364. The exact day is uncertain, but it must have been between the 1st and 24th of the month.<br>
