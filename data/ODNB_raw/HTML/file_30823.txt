<span class="headword">Blackman,  Geoffrey Emett</span>  (1903&#150;1980), <span class="occ">agricultural scientist</span>, was born on 17 April 1903 at 58 Scarsdale Villas, Kensington, London. He was the eldest of the three children of the cytologist and plant physiologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31911/', "Vernon Herbert Blackman (1872&#150;1967)")</script>, then an assistant in the British Museum (Natural History), and Edith Delta (1876/7&#150;1940), daughter of Joseph and Rebecca Ann Emett of Mangotsfield, Gloucestershire. Blackman began his schooling in Leeds, where his father was professor of botany from 1907. Following his father's return to London as professor of plant physiology and pathology at Imperial College, he attended King's College School, Wimbledon, before entering St John's College, Cambridge. Blackman graduated second class in both parts of the natural sciences tripos (1924 and 1926). He was also a good sportsman, a jazz fan, and president of the dance club.<br>
<br>Blackman's interest in biology started very early. He grew up surrounded by renowned biologists including his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31910/', "Frederick Frost Blackman (1866&#150;1947)")</script>, his aunt <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30924/', "Dame Harriette Chick (1875&#150;1977)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36415/', "Sir Arthur Tansley (1871&#150;1955)")</script>, a close friend of the family. In Cambridge he became interested in the applications of mathematical statistics to biological problems through his teacher G. E. Briggs. This interest was furthered in 1926 during Blackman's five months as a student worker in the Rothamsted Experimental Station under Ronald Fisher and Bernard Keen, studying the effects of fertilizers on plant growth in the field laboratory. His father, considering his performance in Cambridge poor, then advised Blackman to go into industry rather than try to follow an academic career. Thus, in 1927, he joined Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). There he worked under Frederick Keeble, director of the agricultural research station at Jealott's Hill. Blackman eventually headed the station's botany section, working in particular on the effects of fertilizers and poisonous substances on the ecological interactions between different plant species, thereby laying the foundations of the study of selective herbicides. Some of this work was publicized in articles in the <span class="italic">Gardeners' Chronicle</span>. Blackman later became an assistant scientific editor of the <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>.<br>
<br>On 8 October 1931 Blackman married Audrey Babette Seligman (<i>b</i>. 1906/7), sculptress, with whom he shared many interests, including the collection of British watercolour paintings. She was the daughter of Richard Joseph Simon Seligman, chemical engineer and director of APV Ltd, manufacturers of machinery for the food trade, on whose board Blackman sat from 1930. They had no children.<br>
<br>During his time at ICI Blackman developed his hobby of gardening, in which he became a great expert&#151;well known for his gardens on acid soils. He also became passionately fond of mountains and winter sports, making regular visits to the Alps until he was over seventy.<br>
<br>During the first half of the 1930s Blackman grew increasingly frustrated with routine testing at ICI, and with the secrecy surrounding the composition of the compounds involved, which, he argued, kept him from designing satisfactory experiments. He sought employment elsewhere, and in 1935 was appointed to a lectureship in the department of biology at Imperial College, then still headed by his father. While the department was very interested in the agricultural applications of its work, Blackman was very sensitive about having started his scientific career in industry, and, therefore, turned his attention increasingly to ecological experiments in natural habitats. However, the time spent in Rothamsted and at Jealott's Hill left its mark. The statistical methods he and A. J. Rutter deployed in their work on the autecology of the bluebell and on the dispersion of plants were pioneering, as was their application to native vegetation of techniques of plant growth analysis then being used by agricultural scientists in Cambridge and Rothamsted. Significantly, Blackman remained uninterested in experimental work on the mechanisms of photosynthesis, nutrient absorption, and intermediate metabolism, which his colleagues believed to be fundamentally important to understand plant growth.<br>
<br>Blackman's agricultural work before moving to Imperial College also facilitated his efforts to establish a role for biologists in the war effort. He was centrally involved in moving the Association of Applied Biologists, the Society of Experimental Biology, and the British Ecological Society to support the establishment of the biology war committee, of which he was the secretary from 1942 to 1946. He also supervised research under the aegis of the Agricultural Research Council on many agricultural problems, including the possible use of selective herbicides, and the introduction of new crops such as oilseed rape, maize, and flax to compensate for lost imports. His involvement with the war effort also cemented his friendship with Sir Henry Tizard who, after being elected president of Magdalen College, Oxford, was instrumental in persuading Blackman to apply for an Oxford chair.<br>
<br>Appointed to the Sibthorpian chair in rural economy in 1945, Blackman was quick to change the emphasis of the department. This was reflected in its name which he changed first to the department of agriculture and subsequently to the department of agricultural science. Teaching and research changed in line with this transformation to reflect the needs of students less interested in becoming farm managers than in embarking on a scientific career. By 1950 the team of collaborators Blackman had drawn together during the war was unified in the Agricultural Research Council unit of agronomy, and was engaged in important research on the physiology of plant hormones and plant growth, the kind of work he had disdained at Imperial College. Blackman's persistent reservations about scientific work in industry, together with criticism from colleagues in Oxford, also resulted in a determined avoidance of any close relationship with the agricultural industry. Some members of the unit who disagreed with these developments eventually succeeded in 1960 in establishing, under the aegis of the Agricultural Research Council, a separate Weed Research Organization at Letcombe.<br>
<br>During the 1950s Blackman became less actively involved in research and more interested in the wider activities of both St John's College and the university, particularly the management of the university parks and the university botanic garden. He also expanded his advisory and administrative activities outside Oxford; these included supervision of the organization of the Malaysian Rubber Research Institute and chairing the section on production and processes of the International Biological Programme. He retired from his professorship in 1970 and was invited to join the committee set up by the United States National Academy of Sciences to report to Congress on the controversial use of herbicides in Vietnam for military purposes. In spite of his age and the dangers involved he took a very active part in the committee's surveys, and was only disappointed that there was no support for more detailed investigations of the herbicides' effects.<br>
<br>Blackman was elected to the Royal Society in 1959, and served on its council and as vice-president (1967&#150;8). He was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture (1963), to an honorary fellowship of Imperial College (1968), and as honorary councillor of the Superior Scientific Circle of Spain (1968). An annual Blackman lecture, at Oxford, was created in his honour. Blackman died at 29 Norman Avenue, Abingdon, on 8 February 1980 after a short illness. He was survived by his wife.<br>
