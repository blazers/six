<span class="headword">Spence,  George</span>  (1787&#150;1850), <span class="occ">jurist</span>, was the second son of Thomas Richard Spence, surgeon, of Hanover Square, London. Educated at a private school at Richmond, Surrey, he matriculated at the University of Glasgow in 1802 and graduated MA in 1805. He was for a period in the office of a London solicitor before joining the Inner Temple in 1806. He was called to the bar on 28 June 1811. After a pupillage with John Bell (1764&#150;1836), he was in good practice at the chancery bar. In 1819 he married Anne Kelsall, the daughter of a solicitor in Chester. He entered parliament, being elected in the tory interest for Reading (20 June 1826), but was unseated on petition (26 March 1827). He was later returned for Ripon (2 March 1829) and held that seat until the dissolution of December 1832, when he did not seek re-election, having voted for the <span class="roman">Reform Act</span> of 1832 against his party.<br>
<br>Spence took silk in December 1834 but he was not successful as a leading counsel and ceased to retain an active practice. Elected bencher of the Inner Temple in 1835, he became reader in 1845 and treasurer in 1846. He devoted the rest of his life to the cause of law reform and to the study of legal history, particularly the history of the chancery jurisdiction. He had raised the issue of chancery reform on several occasions in parliament and in pamphlets published in 1830 and 1839, and he was an original member of the Society for Promoting the Amendment of the Law, founded in 1844. His interest in legal history was evident as early as 1812 in an essay read to the Society of Clifford's Inn on the origin of English laws and institutions. In 1826 he published <span class="italic">An Inquiry into the Origin of the Laws and Political Institutions of Modern Europe</span>. The culmination of his researches was <span class="italic">The Equitable Jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery, comprising its Rise, Progress and Final Establishment</span>, the first volume of which appeared in the year of his Inner Temple treasurership (1846) and was dedicated to his fellow benchers. In two parts, it included a general historical survey and a historical and analytical account of the equitable jurisdiction. With the aid of Cecil Monro, registrar of the court of chancery, Spence was able to include some original material drawn from the court's records. The second volume (1849) was in the nature of a textbook on the substantive law of the court as it had developed by the middle of the nineteenth century. Spence was a jurist of wide interests, and though time has rendered some of his writing on general history and Roman law parallels somewhat obsolete, this work as a whole continued to serve as an important source of information on the development of equitable jurisdiction in England, surpassing everything previously published in that field. It was also a pioneering work in the field of comparative legal history.<br>
<br>Spence's health had been affected by his literary labours and in a fit of insanity he took his own life on 12 December 1850 at his home, 42 Hyde Park Square, London. His wife and two sons survived him.<br>
