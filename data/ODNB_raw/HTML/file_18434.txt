<span class="headword">Mayhew,  Horace</span>  (1816&#150;1872), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born in London, the son of Joshua Dorset Joseph Mayhew (<i>d</i>. 1858) and Mary Ann Fenn, and the brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18433/', "Henry Mayhew (1812&#150;1887)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18432/', "Augustus Septimus Mayhew (1826&#150;1875)")</script>. Like all the seven Mayhew brothers, he was articled to his father, a London attorney, but he chose to pursue other professional interests. He had a lengthy career in journalism, serving as sub-editor of <span class="italic">Punch</span> with Douglas Jerrold and William Makepeace Thackeray and as editor of the <span class="italic">Comic Almanac</span>. In 1845 he was on the staff of contributors to George Cruikshank's <span class="italic">Table Book</span>, and was an early contributor to the <span class="italic">Illustrated London News</span>. He was the author of one play, <span class="italic">Plum Pudding Pantomimes</span>, which was produced at the Olympic Theatre, London, in December 1847. His publications include the humorous sketches &#145;Change for a Shilling&#146;, &#145;Model Men&#146;, and &#145;Model Women and Children&#146; (all 1848; published in 1872 in one volume entitled <span class="italic">Wonderful People</span>); &#145;Whom to Marry and How to Get Married&#146; (1848); &#145;A Plate of Heads&#146;, with drawings by Gavarni (1849); &#145;The Toothache&#146; (1849); &#145;Guy Faux&#146; (1849); and &#145;Letters Left at the Pastry-Cook's&#146; (1853). A good-natured man, Ponny (as he was called) is said to have been deeply hurt by harsh criticism of his work. The death of his father in 1858 left him in easy circumstances and he wrote little in later years. He had been engaged to one of Douglas Jerrold's daughters&#151;his brother Henry's sister-in-law&#151;but Jerrold is reported to have ended the affair, stating that &#145;one Mayhew in the family is enough&#146;  (Spielmann, 329). He was married late in life, on 7 September 1868, to Emily Sarah Fearon (1823&#150;1876), the widowed daughter of William Slade, an army officer.<br>
<br>Mayhew was a handsome, captivating man&#151;though reputedly the model for Sir John Tenniel's not-so-handsome white knight in the illustration for Lewis Carroll's <span class="italic">Through the Looking Glass</span>. He was also a bon vivant and, according to Spielmann, &#145;scorned to seek repose before the milkman started on his rounds&#146;  (Spielmann, 328). His politics, at least in the context of the important <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of 1867, were Conservative, and in a reputed debate at <span class="italic">Punch</span>'s table he firmly rejected the premises of the bill, noting that as many working writers as labourers were suffering from want of work and money. On 30 April 1872 Ponny Mayhew died suddenly of a ruptured blood-vessel at his home, 33 Addison Gardens, South Kensington, London. He was survived by his wife, who died in October 1876. <span class="italic">Punch</span> published a moving obituary shortly after.<br>
