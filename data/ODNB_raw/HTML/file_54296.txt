<span class="headword">Montgomery family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1350&#150;<em>c.</em>1485), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, was important in the history of Renfrewshire and Ayrshire (in particular the region of Cunningham in north Ayrshire) in the south-west of Scotland. Persons bearing the name Montgomery first appear in Scotland in the twelfth century, in the retinue and lands of the Stewarts in Renfrewshire and Ayrshire, and their rise to prominence in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries probably owed much to the Stewart accession to the crown in 1371. They also had links with the Douglases. <a name="cosubject_19062"></a><span class="headword">John Montgomery of Eaglesham</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1400/01)<span class="occ"></span> is the first member of the family who achieved more than local eminence and from whom its descent can be followed with some certainty. Froissart's account of the battle of Otterburn in 1388 narrates how Montgomery captured Sir Henry Percy (Hotspur) in the course of hand-to-hand fighting. Montgomery is also said to have built the castle of Polnoon at the <i>caput</i> of his principal estate of Eaglesham in Renfrewshire, near Glasgow, as or with the proceeds of Percy's ransom. Although these stories gain no support from record evidence, Montgomery did have &#145;ix hunder punde of Inglish gold&#146; to lend James Lindsay in 1389  (Fraser, <span class="italic">Eglinton</span>, 2, no. 22). He married Elizabeth, the only daughter and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54179/', "Sir Hugh Eglinton")</script> of Eglinton, prominent servant of both David II and Robert II. Through Elizabeth, Montgomery acquired the neighbouring west Cunningham estates of Eglinton and Ardrossan, together with the offices of bailie of Cunningham and chamberlain of the burgh of Irvine, which Sir Hugh had been granted by Robert Stewart before he became king.<br>
<br>John received a pension for the year to May 1400, but was dead by 4 July 1401, when his son <a name="cosubject_54296"></a><span class="headword">Sir John Montgomery of Ardrossan</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1427<span class="mult">x</span>9)<span class="occ"></span> was in possession of his lands. He styled himself lord of Ardrossan and also held the estate of Giffen in Kyle Stewart in Ayrshire. He was bailie not only of Cunningham but also of the barony of Kilbride (once held by the future Robert III) in the sheriffdom of Lanark. His first wife, Agnes, was a daughter of John, lord of the Isles, while his second wife, Margaret, was a Maxwell of Carlaverock, in Dumfries-shire. Sir John was taken captive by the English at the battle of Homildon in 1402, and spent a good deal of the next six years as a prisoner or hostage in England. Subsequently he seems to have managed Cunningham on behalf of the Stewart dukes of Albany, governors of Scotland during the captivity of James I in England between 1406 and 1424. He also engaged in overseas trading activity and apparently owned a ship called <i>La Wynyne</i>. In 1424 James I returned to Scotland. He probably resented the services that Montgomery, formerly a retainer of his father and elder brother, the duke of Rothesay, had rendered to the Albany Stewarts. Consequently Sir John was arrested at parliament in March 1425 along with Murdoch Stewart, duke of Albany, and the latter's family. He was quickly released, and subsequently demonstrated his loyalty to the king by serving on the assize that convicted Murdoch and others at Stirling in May 1425, and by being one of the joint leaders of an expedition which at Loch Lomond in June crushed a rebellion led by James Stewart, a surviving son of Duke Murdoch, but the king probably remained suspicious. One of the other leaders of this expedition was Sir John's neighbour in Cunningham, Sir Robert Cunningham of Kilmaurs, who had also served on the Stirling assize. It is likely that the king arranged the indenture that on 6 June 1425 Sir John entered into with Sir Robert for the latter's marriage with Sir John's daughter Anna. This provided for a life grant of the office of bailie of Cunningham to Sir Robert, with reversion to Sir John and his heirs on Sir Robert's death. This document also seems to anticipate what in fact happened a couple of months later (which may also have been a sign of royal displeasure), the sending of Sir John into England in exchange for a hostage returning to Scotland. He seems not to have returned to Scotland, and to have died in England, possibly at Pontefract Castle.<br>
<br>Sir John was succeeded by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_19051"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Montgomery</span>, first Lord Montgomery  (<em>d.</em> 1470)<span class="occ"></span>. Alexander's wife, Margaret, was a daughter of Sir Thomas Boyd of Kilmarnock, head of another important Cunningham family. As part of the king's assertion of control over the territories under the sway of the lordship of the Isles, Alexander was in February 1430 appointed joint keeper of Kintyre and Knapdale in Argyll with his brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54164/', "Sir Robert Cunningham of Kilmaurs")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54161/', "Cunningham family (per. c.1340&#150;1631)")</script>]; in this role the pair had custody of castles Sween and Skipness. Sir Robert seems to have been dead by February 1431, and in 1447 Alexander Montgomery rendered an account at the king's exchequer for the last twelve years as bailie of Cunningham, having presumably regained possession of the office under the indenture of 1425. From 1436 on Alexander was a frequent envoy to England, and during the minority of James II, <i>c</i>.1445, he became a lord of parliament as Alexander, Lord Montgomery, probably by 1438 and certainly by 1445. Between 1442 and 1444 he was keeper of Brodick Castle on Arran, and he seems to have held other lands on the island, as well as receiving various further grants of land from the crown.<br>
<br>On 31 January 1449, just before the end of the king's minority, when governance was still in the hands of the Livingstons and the earl of Douglas, Lord Montgomery's son Alexander, master of Montgomery, received a royal grant of the office of bailie of Cunningham, thereby sparking a feud with the Cunninghams of Kilmaurs, which was to continue murderously for over 150 years until settled by royal arbitration in 1609. The initial phase of the feud was ended in the winter of 1454&#150;5, after the death in 1452 of the master of Montgomery (who thus predeceased his father). The king, who was now of age to act for himself, ratified the families' agreement that Alexander Cunningham of Kilmaurs should exercise the office until the lawful age of Alexander Montgomery, the master's son, at which point the matter would be put to &#145;a declaration of rycht&#146; before the king and his council, who would declare who should &#145;bruik office fra thinefurth for ever maire&#146;  (NA Scot., GD 148/1/12). Alexander was the son of the master's marriage with Catherine, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54246/', "Gilbert Kennedy")</script> of Dunure and Cassillis [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54242/', "Kennedy family")</script>] in Carrick, south Ayrshire. In June 1466 the younger Alexander was retoured heir to his father in the bailiary of Cunningham. Significantly, this process did not take place in Ayrshire but before sheriffs <i>in hac parte</i> at Linlithgow, suggesting that trouble with the Cunninghams of Kilmaurs was anticipated. Nothing is known of any process of right concerning the office at this time or, indeed, about whether Alexander was ever able to make good his claim to be bailie of Cunningham. He seems to have been dead before 1470, the year of the death of his grandfather, Lord Montgomery. When Alexander's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19058/', "Hugh Montgomery, later first earl of Eglinton")</script>, was infeft in the principal family estates of Eglinton, Ardrossan, and Eaglesham in 1484, it was as heir to Lord Montgomery rather than to his father, suggesting that the latter had predeceased the former.<br>
<br>The Montgomerys provide a good example of a long-established landowning family in the south-west of Scotland achieving political significance following the ascent of the Stewarts to the throne, which left something of a power vacuum locally, but also drew the family closer to the central government of the day. The feud with the Cunninghams of Kilmaurs is the main illustration of the local power struggle, but there was an interaction with national politics inasmuch as royal favour (as well as the premature deaths of successive heirs) clearly played a significant part in determining which family held the upper hand in that struggle from time to time.<br>
