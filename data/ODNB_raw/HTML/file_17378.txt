<span class="headword">Maccarthy,  Donough</span>, styled fourth earl of Clancarty  (1668&#150;1734), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, was born in Blarney, co. Cork, the only son of Callaghan Maccarthy, third earl of Clancarty (<i>d</i>. 1676), and Elizabeth, daughter of George Fitzgerald, sixteenth earl of Kildare. Maccarthy was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67053/', "Donough MacCarthy, second Viscount Muskerry")</script>, a general of the Irish forces in Munster supporting Charles I during the revolution. In exile the viscount was created earl of Clancarty, and he returned to Ireland after the restoration of Charles II. During this period the Clancartys, staunch Catholics and loyal to the Stuart kings, were one of the noblest and richest families in Ireland, with estates in Cork and co. Kerry. On his father's death on 21 November 1676 Maccarthy became the fourth earl of Clancarty. The family's wealth and power ensured that the young earl would be drawn into the Catholic&#150;protestant struggles for control over the Irish kingdom. His mother, Elizabeth, a protestant, was appointed Clancarty's guardian by her late husband. To fend off Catholic influences and ensure a proper protestant education for her son, she placed him under the care of John Fell, bishop of Oxford and dean of Christ Church.<br>
<br>It was while Donough was at Oxford that he drew the attention of Charles II and became the subject of one of the greatest scandals of the day. Charles, concerned that there were too many &#145;old Cromwellians&#146; in the Irish army, intended to root out the protestant veterans of the interregnum and replace them with loyal Catholic royalists. In 1684 Charles began to reorganize the army under Richard Talbot, the first earl of Tyrconnell, and purge Irish officers, replacing them with loyal Catholics. The first commission he granted was to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17380/', "Colonel Justin MacCarthy")</script>, Clancarty's uncle. Justin, a veteran of the armies of Louis XIV of France, had strong ties to the Stuart cause and Catholic factions at court. Married to Arabella, daughter of Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, MacCarthy was also an adviser to James, duke of York. It was MacCarthy who proposed to enlist the young earl of Clancarty in the Catholic cause. The king sent a letter, countersigned by the earl of Sunderland, to John Fell commanding that the young earl should &#145;keep his Christmas at London with his uncle&#146;. Fell suspected subterfuge but, unable to contact the earl's mother and unwilling to dismiss the king's wishes, sent the boy to Sunderland's London house. On his arrival in London, Clancarty (aged fifteen or sixteen years old) was quickly married to Sunderland's second daughter, Lady Elizabeth Spencer (<i>d</i>. 1704), who by various accounts was between eleven and thirteen years old, at Westminster Abbey on 31 December 1684. The marriage caused a great scandal. Intended to bind one of Ireland's most powerful families more closely to the Stuart cause, it was seen by many as a crude attempt by the king to advance his Irish policies. The Sunderlands enlisted the aid of the diarist John Evelyn to break the news to the earl's distraught mother. Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, wrote an account of the incident in his <span class="italic">History of my Own Time</span>. Attempting to cover up Sunderland's role in Charles's &#145;sinister&#146; policies, Burnet later deleted references to his friend in a subsequent draft that was eventually published.<br>
<br>Clancarty was immediately recalled to Ireland, before consummating his marriage and without his new bride. In defiance of his mother, he converted to Catholicism within a year. On the accession of James II, Clancarty received command of a troop of horse, giving the Stuarts another loyal Catholic officer in the Irish army. The appointment prompted a letter of complaint from the earl of Clarendon that the commission deprived a Captain Brook &#145;of his troop of horse in Lord Ardglasse's regiment though he gave sixteen hundred pounds for it not two years ago&#146;. Serving with his uncle Justin MacCarthy under the command of Tyrconnell, Clancarty's service amounted to little more than licensed banditry. He had a reputation as a brutal, even sadistic, commander. Clancarty allegedly had a man hung up by his hair and ordered that another, a butcher in Mallow, be tossed in a blanket. According to J. P. Kenyon, Clancarty also took a second wife and fathered a son. In May 1689, though under age, he was granted a royal dispensation that allowed him to sit in the Irish House of Lords.<br>
<br>At the outbreak of the revolution of 1688 Clancarty, a loyal supporter of James II, greeted the deposed king when James invaded Ireland in 1689. Clancarty was appointed lord of the bedchamber and later colonel of the 4th regiment of foot, later called Clancarty's regiment. Fighting beside his uncle, who was now a general titled by James II as Viscount Mountcashel, Clancarty participated throughout the ill-fated Irish campaign. Mountcashel was wounded and captured during the campaign. He later broke parole and entered the army of Louis XIV. Clancarty surrendered to Marlborough at the siege of Cork in October 1690 and was sent to the Tower of London. The earl's estate (yielding a rent of about &pound;10,000 a year) was seized, though the dowager countess and her daughters were provided a pension. He was attainted and his title forfeited on 11 May 1691. The bulk of the forfeited estates went to William Bentinck, Lord Woodstock.<br>
<br>On 27 October 1694 Clancarty escaped from the tower by leaving a &#145;periwig block&#146; dressed up in his bed to fool the watch. The guards allegedly found a note pinned to the blanket with the inscription &#145;this block must answer for me&#146;. He joined James II's court at St Germain as commander of the second troop of Horse Guards, disbanded in 1697 after the treaty of Ryswick. By this time, Clancarty was thoroughly estranged from the earl of Sunderland, who considered him little more than a dissolute brigand. Sunderland refused to support a petition for the return of Clancarty's confiscated estates and blocked the earl's efforts to reunite with his wife, Sunderland's daughter. Nevertheless Clancarty, who had not seen Lady Clancarty in over a decade, returned to England in secret. On an evening in late December he sent for her. Elizabeth, now in her twenties, a slim woman with dark good looks, expressive eyes, and a high forehead, was still loyal to Clancarty and agreed to meet him at his mother's house. Clancarty tried to convince her to consummate their marriage, but she refused. The earl persisted, following her that night to Norfolk House at St James Square, London, where she went to bed with him. Lady Clancarty's maid revealed the earl's presence to a porter, who ran to Sunderland's house. Sunderland went to Whitehall and, finding the secretary of state, Sir James Vernon, working late, had a warrant sworn out for Clancarty's arrest. Accompanied by armed soldiers, Sunderland dragged Clancarty from Elizabeth's bed and deposited him in London's Newgate prison. Elizabeth took refuge with the family of Jael Boscawen, where she mounted a campaign to secure her husband's release. For the second time controversy over the Clancarty marriage became the talk of London. In defiance of her parents, Elizabeth enlisted the aid of a long list of members of court to plead her husband's case before William III. William remarked that &#145;he never was so teased about anything so much as petitions and requests in behalf of that little spark Lord Clancarty&#146;  (Kenyon, 303). Clancarty was pardoned on condition of leaving the kingdom. In addition, he received a small pension of &pound;300 a year and Lady Clancarty received a grant of &pound;2000 a year &#145;out of the first fruits of office&#146;.<br>
<br>The earl and countess of Clancarty went to Hamburg and then took up residence on an island in the Elbe River, near Altona. They had a daughter, Charlotte, and two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17382/', "Robert Maccarthy")</script> and Justin, before Lady Clancarty's death in 1704. Clancarty himself died on 19 September 1734 at Praals-Hoff. His daughter, Charlotte, married John West, the seventh Lord Delawarr. Justin served as an officer in the Neapolitan army. The eldest son, Robert, became Viscount Muskerry and titular earl of Clancarty. He entered the British navy and served as governor of Newfoundland from 1733 to 1735. After returning to Britain and failing in efforts to recover the family estate he went back to sea, rising to command the <i>Adventure</i>. He left the navy in 1741 to support Charles Edward Stuart and the Jacobite cause. He was granted a pension of &pound;1000 a year by Louis XV of France and retired to Boulogne. The last Clancarty to champion the Stuart claim to the throne, he died on 19 September 1769.<br>
<br>The scandals of the Clancarty marriage were retold in Lord Macaulay's <span class="italic">History of England</span>. The story was later adopted by Tom Taylor as an &#145;original drama&#146; and first produced at the Royal Olympic Theatre in London on 9 March 1874. Clancarty's life and marriage remain of enduring interest not only as what Macaulay called a &#145;romantic history&#146;, but as a tale reflective of the web of political, religious, and military conflicts that strained the Irish aristocracy during the Stuart age.<br>
