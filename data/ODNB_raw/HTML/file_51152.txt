</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Percy,  Algernon George</span>, sixth duke of Northumberland  (1810&#150;1899), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was born on 29 May 1810 at 37 Grosvenor Place, London, the eldest son of George Percy (1778&#150;1867), second earl of Beverley and fifth duke of Northumberland, and his wife, Louisa Harcourt Stuart Wortley (1781&#150;1848). From 1830 to 1865 he was known by the courtesy title Lord Lovaine, and briefly as Earl Percy, between his father's succession to the dukedom in 1865 and his own succession on his father's death on 21 August 1867.<br>
<br>Educated at Eton College, Lovaine was an officer in the Grenadier Guards in his early years (1827&#150;37), but followed his father as MP for the rotten borough of Beeralston, Devon, in 1831 only to find it disfranchised in the <span class="roman">First Reform Act</span>. He contested, unsuccessfully, the Exeter seat in the election of 1841, and much more surprisingly failed to get elected for the North Northumberland county seat in 1847, his cousin Algernon Percy, fourth duke of Northumberland, a moderate Conservative allied by marriage to the whiggish Grosvenors, presumably declining to mobilize the overwhelming Percy influence over that constituency.<br>
<br>Doubts about Lovaine's reliability may have been sown by his marriage on 26 May 1845 to Louisa Drummond (1813&#150;1890). She was the daughter and coheir of the banker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8067/', "Henry Drummond")</script>, principal patron of the millenarian sect the Catholic Apostolic church, which had its origins in meetings of &eacute;litist church reformers at Albury Park, Drummond's Surrey seat, in 1826. The church blossomed under Edward Irving's inspiration into a bizarre religious manifestation of a group of eccentric tory aristocrats: extremely wealthy, exclusive, and deliberately self-terminating through insistence that, since the second coming was imminent, there was no need to provide any mechanism for discovering successors to its hierarchy of &#145;chosen&#146; apostles. Followers, who included Lovaine for the rest of his life, adhered to the rule that the faithful should contribute a full 10 per cent of their annual income to the church&#151;for him a small sum until he succeeded to the huge Percy estates, after which his tithe cost him about &pound;20,000 a year. With such riches at its disposal the church indulged in opulent display, creating for example the cathedral-like structure that eventually became the University of London's church in Gordon Square. Lovaine's &#145;very fantastic opinions&#146;, as Disraeli later described them (Disraeli to Queen Victoria, 30 April 1868, quoted in Blake, 492), were discreetly concealed by obituaries: &#145;in religious attitude he was a nonconformist&#146;  (<span class="italic">ILN</span>, 7 Jan 1899, 7). As an act of piety he edited the two volumes of <span class="italic">Speeches in Parliament by the late Henry Drummond</span> (1860), published within months of his father-in-law's death, after which he acquired, through his wife, the Albury Park estate.<br>
<br>Lovaine entered parliament in 1852, when normal service was resumed in the North Northumberland constituency, and he continued to sit for the county until 1865. He was a solid, if uninspiring, supporter of the Conservatives and was rewarded with appointment as a lord of Admiralty in 1858 and as vice-president of the Board of Trade in 1859, performing unremarkably. As a back-bencher he spoke quite frequently, predictably, and briefly, mainly on military and naval matters, Irish education, and church rates. He ventured a joke when smoke abatement was being debated in 1857, saying that Scottish smoke was very like English smoke and that the same law ought to apply to the whole UK. His passion was only aroused when the sanctity of marriage was at stake: he strongly opposed the <span class="roman">Divorce Bill</span> of 1857, aligning himself with Gladstone, and was even more vehement in resisting the frequent attempts to legalize marriage with a deceased wife's sister, which he was convinced would destroy marriages because husbands would take a fancy to their sisters-in-law (his sister-in-law was safely married to Sir Thomas Rokewood-Gage).<br>
<br>In 1868 Northumberland, as he had now become, felt strongly that Disraeli was betraying the constitution, the party, and the social order in pressing ahead with the <span class="roman">Second Reform Act</span>, and he declined to give any active support to the Conservative Party in the election of 1868, remarking:<blockquote>If the present government obtain a majority, it will be only an incentive to the Whigs to plunge further into revolution, and between them Lord Derby and Disraeli they have let the mob in upon us, and will of course give way whenever they find themselves hard pressed.(Northumberland to Lord Hylton, 4 Nov 1868, quoted in Hanham, 26)</blockquote> Disraeli refused, in 1868, to recommend Northumberland for the Garter, which the latter hankered after.<br>
<br>Like Salisbury (Cranborne), who had also walked out of the cabinet in 1868 over Disraeli's <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> antics, and who became reconciled to Disraeli after he won power in 1874, so the politically unimportant Northumberland returned to the party fold. He was totally unexpectedly taken in to the cabinet as lord privy seal in February 1878, &#145;a strange choice surely&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of Gathorne Hardy</span>, 354). At least he did no harm while in office, and at the opening of parliament in February 1880, as Disraeli related, &#145;he was consoled for his never having anything to do, by bearing the Crown&#151;rather a weighty and difficult office&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Disraeli to Lady Bradford</span>, 2.261). He was also consoled with the Garter, but was in fact kept occupied as chairman of the royal commission on the parochial charities of the City of London. Northumberland was one of the largest contributors to the Conservatives' election fund in 1880&#151;his &pound;2000 exceeded only by the duke of Portland's &pound;6000&#151;but this was not enough to prevent Beaconsfield's defeat, with which Northumberland's undistinguished political career came to an end.<br>
<br>Northumberland's religious opinions were a handicap to political success; the major drawback, however, was his own personality coupled with his solidly traditional conservatism. Contemporary diarists found him &#145;rather deaf and slow&#146;; Disraeli wrote to Lady Bradford that &#145;the cold, proud, Duke of Northumberland &hellip; was grim and acid&#146; at a banquet given by Disraeli in 1875; and Gathorne Hardy noted that at a party meeting in the Carlton in 1885 Northumberland &#145;spoke in a whisper and dropped out words inconsecutively so that I doubt if the meeting knew what he was at&#146; (<span class="italic">Letters of Disraeli</span>, 1.206; <span class="italic">Diary of Gathorne Hardy</span>, 459, 565). More waspishly, <span class="italic">Vanity Fair</span> remarked: &#145;In religion he is reputed to be an Irvingite, and to possess the gift of tongues. This gift he has never displayed in public&#146;  (<span class="italic">VF</span>, 14 June 1884, 339). Disraeli summed him up in a&#151;not entirely fair&#151;pen portrait for Victoria:<blockquote>The Duke of Northumberland is very unpopular and has the reputation of being the proudest man in yr Majesty's dominions. He <i>is</i> proud, but he is more shy; and suffering under a morbid feeling that he has never been appreciated.(30 April 1868, quoted in Blake, 492)</blockquote>Northumberland may have been a political nonentity and a token cabinet minister, but he played the part of aristocratic grandee to perfection. In the home town of Grace Darling he was a natural for president of the Royal Lifeboat Institution (1866&#150;99), and he was also president of the Royal Institution from 1873 to 1899. As the lord of Alnwick Castle and owner of a Northumberland estate of more than 186,000 acres he was as a matter of course lord lieutenant of Northumberland, from 1877 onwards; he was also a notably considerate landlord, offering his tenantry considerable financial help during the agriculturally difficult 1880s and early 1890s and giving a lead in the conversion of marginal arable land into pasture. He took seriously his responsibilities as by far the wealthiest landowner in the county, promoting the foundation of the Durham College of Science in Newcastle (forerunner of the University of Newcastle), of the Northumberland, Durham, and Newcastle Infirmary for Diseases of the Eye, and of the College of Medicine in Newcastle. Although an Irvingite he supported Anglican church-building and church schools, and gave &pound;10,000 towards the formation of the see of Newcastle and the enthronement of the first bishop, in 1882. He catered for the social as well as moral improvement of the people on his estates by opening Hulne Park, Alnwick, to the public, donating a public park to Tynemouth, and helping with the building of the Tynemouth aquarium.<br>
<br>Some of this munificence may have been financed simply by recycling some of the proceeds of the compulsory demolition of Northumberland House. This huge, rambling town house, with many alterations and additions to its Jacobean core, including a recently rebuilt ballroom, stood in the way of Bazalgette's plan for a direct link from Trafalgar Square to the Thames Embankment, and the Metropolitan Board of Works started compulsory purchase proceedings in 1873. Lord Elcho mounted a rather half-hearted preservation campaign, and the duke defiantly held a last enormous ball in July 1873, attended by the prince and princess of Wales, the Grand Duke and Duchess Cesarewitch, and 1000 other guests. Demolition, and the construction of Northumberland Avenue, none the less went ahead in 1874. The duke pocketed &pound;497,000 in compensation.<br>
<br>Northumberland died at Alnwick Castle on 2 January 1899, and was buried in Westminster Abbey a week later, alongside his ancestors. He was survived by his two sons, Henry George Percy, seventh duke of Northumberland (1846&#150;1918), and Algernon Malcolm Arthur Percy (1851&#150;1933). Proud, haughty, and difficult he may have been in London society, but in his own county and on his own estates he was said to be &#145;beloved and respected by all classes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, 1899, pt 2, 127), a claim lent some credibility by the wreath sent to the abbey by the Albury working men's club.<br>
