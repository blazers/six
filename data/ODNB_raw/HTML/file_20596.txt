<span class="headword">Ogilvy,  James</span>, first earl of Airlie  (1586&#150;1666), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the eldest son of James Ogilvy, sixth Lord Ogilvy of Airlie (<i>c</i>.1565&#150;<i>c</i>.1617&times;19), and his first wife, Lady Jean (<i>d</i>. 1612), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24375/', "William Ruthven, first earl of Gowrie")</script>. He succeeded his father on the latter's death, after 12 October 1617. He married (contract dated 22 November 1610) Lady Isobel or Isobella (1596&#150;1682), second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12126/', "Thomas Hamilton, first earl of Haddington")</script>. In 1631 he was one of the commissioners appointed to inquire into the burning of Frendraught Castle, as part of a Gordon&#150;Crichton feud. A committed royalist, he was created earl of Airlie and Lord Ogilvy of Alyth and Lintrathen by a royal patent dated at York on 2 April 1639.<br>
<br>In 1640 Airlie went to England to avoid having to take the covenant, leaving his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20597/', "James Ogilvy, Lord Ogilvy")</script>, in charge of his estates. The covenanting earl of Argyll marched to Airlie Castle with 5000 men and demanded its surrender. When Lord Ogilvy refused, and prudently departed, Argyll burned both the castle and the other principal Airlie seat at Forter, Forfarshire. A contemporary commented that &#145;they have not left him in all his lands a cock to crow day&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1640</i>, 53) and the episode later inspired the well-known Scottish ballad &#145;The Bonnie Hoose o'Airlie&#146;. Returning to Scotland, Airlie sat in the covenanting parliament of 1643, but the following year he and his three sons joined the marquess of Montrose's royalist army. As a result he suffered forfeiture of life, titles, and estates by parliament on 11 February 1645. On 15 August he led the first charge at the battle of Kilsyth and routed the covenanters. He was present at Montrose's subsequent defeat at Philiphaugh (13 September) where James, Lord Ogilvy, was captured; the latter only escaped death when his sister managed to smuggle him out of prison. Airlie's second son, Thomas, had been killed on the royalist side at the battle of Inverlochy (2 February 1645).<br>
<br>Airlie was exempted from the general pardon of 11 February 1646 and was excommunicated by the Church of Scotland on 27 July 1646. Not until 17 March 1647 was his forfeiture finally rescinded, thanks to the intervention of John, first earl of Middleton, who had been authorized to pacify northern Scotland. His participation was expected in the &#145;start&#146; in October 1650, a failed attempt to free Charles II from covenanter tutelage by rallying royalist support. Thereafter he appears to have taken no more part in public affairs, living quietly with his wife. By 1664 he was complaining that he could not &#145;get anywhares abroad [outside] for my age and infirmitie, I being thre scoir and eighteen yeirs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Scots peerage</span>, 1.124). He died on 21 February 1666.<br>
