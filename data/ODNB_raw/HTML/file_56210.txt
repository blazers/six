<span class="headword">Smith,  Henry  Newson-</span>  (1854&#150;1898), <span class="occ">accountant and music-hall entrepreneur</span>, was born on 14 May 1854 at 28 Wyndham Street, Marylebone, Middlesex, the son of Henry George Smith, leather merchant, and his wife, Emily Newson. Smith was educated at the North London Collegiate School, Camden Town, and in 1871 took up employment in a City solicitor's office. In 1876 he married Elizabeth Caroline Louisa, the daughter of Nicholas Powning, a builder, of Truro. The same year he established his own accountancy business at 37 Walbrook in the City of London (which remained his office throughout his career). His business interests flourished and in 1880 he became a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. In later life he was known as Henry Newson-Smith.<br>
<br>Newson-Smith's financial acumen became evident in the closing decades of the nineteenth century, when he stimulated a profound transformation of the commercial aspects of the buoyant music-hall business. His initial involvement in popular entertainment came through his role as an auditor of theatre companies, but he soon became more deeply involved in the ownership and management of the London Pavilion during the late 1880s. In partnership with George Adney Payne he purchased the recently built Tivoli in 1891 and his control of the West End variety business was consolidated by the opening on 31 January 1893 of the rebuilt Oxford music-hall. As the guiding force behind this syndicate of halls, Newson-Smith controlled the finances of the most influential and successful theatres of the music-hall boom of the 1890s.<br>
<br>According to <span class="italic">The Era</span>, Newson-Smith's financial success and his distinctive contribution to the development of popular entertainment in Britain lay &#145;in the intelligent application of ordinary business principles to a calling which had hitherto been regarded as incapable of such treatment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Era</span>, 14 March 1896, 19). Previous generations of music-hall entrepreneurs had adopted a largely cavalier and providential attitude towards the financial aspects of their activities. Newson-Smith, drawing on his experience outside the entertainment industry, pioneered the adoption of a much more rigorous and prudent approach to music-hall finance. His involvement with the music-hall business was cut short by ill health, however. Newson-Smith resigned his directorships of the London Pavilion, Tivoli, and Oxford music-halls in November 1896, and by the time of his death he had sold off the majority of his interests in these companies.<br>
<br>In addition to his business responsibilities, Newson-Smith was also a deputy lieutenant of London and the honorary auditor of the Music Hall Benevolent Fund. &#145;Hennie&#146;, as he was often known to intimates, was a motor enthusiast, a keen collector of Constable paintings, and an avid follower of cricket. Newson-Smith died from cirrhosis of the liver and acute jaundice on 28 April 1898 at his home, 25 Avenue Road, St John's Wood, London; he was only forty-three. He was buried at the old parish church, Hampstead, on 2 May 1898. He had at least one son, who was at that time a chartered accountant's articled clerk.<br>
