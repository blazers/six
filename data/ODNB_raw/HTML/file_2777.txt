<span class="headword">Bohun,  Humphrey (VII)  de</span>, fourth earl of Hereford and ninth earl of Essex  (<em>c.</em>1276&#150;1322), <span class="occ">magnate and administrator</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2776/', "Humphrey (VI) de Bohun, third earl of Hereford and eighth earl of Essex (c.1249&#150;1298)")</script>, constable of England, and his wife, Maud de Fiennes, daughter of Enguerrand, seigneur de Fiennes. Edward I received his homage and granted livery of his father's lands on 16 February 1298. Bohun attended the marriage of Edward I to Margaret of France at Canterbury on 10 September 1299. In 1300 he was present at the siege of Caerlaverock, and in the following year he was among those barons who sealed a letter of grievances to the pope. He married Elizabeth, youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8517/', "Edward I")</script>, and widow of John, count of Holland, in 1302; among their children was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2778/', "William de Bohun, first earl of Northampton")</script>. Before the marriage he surrendered all of his lands and rights as both earl and constable to the king. They were regranted jointly to the earl and his wife after the wedding took place. In October 1304 he was to have accompanied the prince of Wales to Amiens to perform homage on his father's behalf for Aquitaine, but the journey was not undertaken. In 1306 he and his wife were granted Lochmaben Castle and all the lands of Robert Bruce in Annandale. He participated at the knighting of Edward of Caernarfon (the future Edward II) on 22 May 1306, fastening one of the prince's spurs. Later, in the Scottish campaign, he served with Thomas of Lancaster, investing the castle at Kildrummy.<br>
<br>Early on in Edward II's reign, Bohun seems to have been well disposed to the new king. He witnessed the grant of the earldom of Cornwall to Edward's Gascon favourite, Piers Gaveston, in August, he dined with the king in August and September, and he was present at court in October and November 1307. He attended the Wallingford tournament in December, when Gaveston defeated a party including himself and the earls of Arundel and Surrey. When he accompanied the king to France for his marriage to Isabella in January 1308, however, he appears to have entered the baronial opposition that was beginning to develop. He sealed the so-called Boulogne agreement which foreshadowed the opposition that was to emerge, led by the earl of Lincoln, at the parliament of April 1308. Nevertheless, at the coronation of Edward II he bore the sceptre with the cross, and throughout 1308&#150;9 he was frequently present at court, as his presence as a witness in the charter rolls attests. In 1310 he was elected as one of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50153/', "lords ordainer")</script>, appointed to reform the king's household and government. According to the <span class="italic">Vita Edwardi secundi</span> he refused to accompany the king on the Scottish campaign of 1310&#150;11 because of his hatred of Gaveston. Edward II stripped him of the constableship, but restored him to the office on 28 August 1311. When Gaveston returned from his third and final exile early in 1312, Bohun was among the magnates who organized opposition to the king and his favourite. He was charged with protecting Essex and the east while others hunted Gaveston down. Following Gaveston's capture Bohun was present at Warwick and participated in the deliberations that resulted in Gaveston's execution on 19 June. Indeed, on 18 June letters were sealed by the earls of Lancaster and Warwick guaranteeing Bohun against any losses he might suffer as a consequence of this act. He was active in the subsequent peace negotiations with the king, and was among those pardoned by Edward in October 1313. In the following year he fought at Bannockburn and was taken prisoner. According to the <span class="italic">Vita Edwardi secundi</span> a dispute between Bohun, constable of England, and the young earl of Gloucester over who should have precedence in the line of attack was a major factor in the English failure. Bohun was subsequently exchanged for Elizabeth de Burgh, wife of Robert I.<br>
<br>From 1315 until 1320 Bohun was regularly present at court, where he is constantly found as a witness in the charter rolls, eclipsed in the frequency of his attendance only by the Despensers. The full nature of his reconciliation with the king is clearly indicated by his presence at Kings Langley on 3 January 1315 for the long-delayed burial of Gaveston. On 11 February 1316 he was appointed captain of the English forces being raised to suppress the revolt of Llywelyn Bren in Glamorgan, and in this he was successful. Later in the year he was appointed to the committee established to reform the king's household and kingdom, but by 1317 he had entered an indenture of service with the king on very favourable terms. He was present at the negotiation of the treaty of Leake in 1318, and he was appointed to the new council that resulted. In 1318&#150;19 he served in the war with Scotland.<br>
<br>Throughout this period, however, the power and influence of the Despensers had grown inordinately. As an important marcher lord Bohun was the natural leader of the opposition to the younger Despenser's territorial aggrandizement. On 30 January 1321 he was sent a royal order not to attend or assent to an illegal assembly that he was about to hold with other magnates, including the earls of Arundel and Surrey. It is likely that soon after this he met with Lancaster to form an alliance. On 16 March the king occupied Bohun's castle at Builth for the latter's failure to appear at a conference with the earl marshal. Further warnings from the king and denunciations of the favourites by the marchers led to an escalation of tensions but no settlement. On 4 May Bohun and the marchers began the destruction of the Despenser estates. In the short term the marchers' objectives were achieved and the Despensers were driven into exile. But the king soon recalled them and showed an unwonted zeal in prosecuting a counter-offensive against his baronial foes in the autumn of 1321. Bohun occupied Gloucester in December, and burned Bridgnorth and destroyed its bridge. Forced to go as far north as Shrewsbury, Edward crossed the Severn on 14 January, after which many of the marchers, including the Mortimers, surrendered. Bohun withdrew to Pontefract, and on 23 January the king ordered the confiscation of his goods. Edward consolidated his grip on the south before turning north for a final confrontation with Bohun and the earl of Lancaster. This came on 16 March 1322 at Boroughbridge, where Bohun was killed in battle. He was buried at the Dominican house in York.<br>
<br>Described in the Caerlaverock roll as &#145;a rich and elegant young man&#146;, Bohun's fluid political loyalties characterize the problems of Edward II's tumultuous reign. He was succeeded by the second of his six sons, John. Another son, Humphrey, succeeded John as sixth earl in 1335.<br>
