<span class="headword">Johnson,  Frank Robert</span>  (1943&#150;2006), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 20 January 1943 at Hackney Hospital, London, the only son and first child of Ernest Johnson, baker and pastry cook, and his wife, Doreen Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Skinner, of 68 Belgrade Road, Stoke Newington. The family was close, and Johnson did not fully leave home until he was thirty-two. Until then, his mother would bring him a cup of tea in bed every morning.<br>
<br>Johnson failed the eleven-plus examination, and was educated at Chartesey and Shoreditch secondary schools. His school career was undistinguished, and he left at sixteen. By that time he had developed a love of opera that was to prove lifelong. At the age of fourteen he had appeared in <span class="italic">Norma</span> at Covent Garden, alongside Maria Callas, in the silent role of one of her sons. He later described the first night:<blockquote>I could not forget that when Callas bore down on us with the knife, her nostrils flared; that when, dropping the knife, she repentantly clasped me to her bosom, her perfume smelt like that of an aunt who was always kissing me; and that &hellip; there penetrated, into my left eye, the tip of the diva's right breast, which partnership remained throughout the subsequent duet with Stignani &hellip; there are few men who can truthfully say that their eye made contact with the right nipple of Maria Callas. (<span class="italic">Out of Order</span>, 246&#150;7)</blockquote>After leaving school Johnson took a bus to Fleet Street, and asked for and got a job as a messenger-boy at the first office he came to, that of the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>. In 1960 his talent was spotted and he joined the <span class="italic">Walthamstow Post</span> as a reporter. He moved to the <span class="italic">Walthamstow Guardian</span> the following year, and worked briefly in Barrow in Furness for the <span class="italic">North-West Daily Mail</span> from 1965 to 1966. In the latter year he joined the press gallery of the House of Commons as a reporter for the <span class="italic">Nottingham Evening Post</span>, soon becoming a lobby correspondent for the <span class="italic">Liverpool Daily Post</span>. He joined the political staff of <span class="italic">The Sun</span> in 1969.<br>
<br>It was during these early years in parliament that Johnson built up the habits of observation that were to stand him in such good stead when, in 1972, he became a leader writer for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, whose &#145;unfashionably right-wing views&#146;, as he put it, he shared &#145;before they became fashionably unfashionable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Out of Order</span>, 8). His working-class toryism was attracted by the rise of Margaret Thatcher. He began to write the paper's parliamentary sketch. It was in this role that he was the master. His comic gift was based on the effect of inverting expectations: &#145;exemplary cowardice&#146;; &#145;Such is his [James Callaghan's] deviousness that he always knows the right moment at which to be straightforward&#146;; &#145;If the Government bales out the C of E, all Heaven will break loose&#146;. It was always deployed with a lightness of touch, and hit the right note with a public that wanted irreverence about the political situation of the 1970s, but not nastiness. He was a virtuoso, easily outclassing all others in the field. Amusing and handsome, with large quantities of wavy hair, Johnson was by this time considered one of the most eligible bachelors in London.<br>
<br>Johnson was so successful as a sketch-writer that he feared being trapped in the role. In 1979 he left the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> for much higher pay as the political columnist of Sir James Goldsmith's new weekly magazine <span class="italic">Now!</span>, but shortly before the magazine folded in 1981, he joined <span class="italic">The Times</span>, the paper that, as a young autodidact, he had most respected. There, too, he became the sketch-writer, but cast this off in 1984 in favour of being the paper's Paris diarist and then its correspondent in Bonn from 1985 to 1986, hoping through these posts to gain the education in European civilization his school had not provided. He returned to London, however, as the sketch-writer once more.<br>
<br>In 1987 Johnson became associate editor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, but was at war&#151;as was quite often the case in his career&#151;with his editor, and left the paper in 1988 to become associate editor and political columnist of the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> under the editorship of Peregrine Worsthorne, whom he much admired. There Johnson created what he called Worsthorne College, the mischievous, intellectually original comment pages that, despite endless skirmishing, survived the replacement of Worsthorne as editor (though not as the &#145;comment editor&#146;) by Trevor Grove, in the following year. In 1994 Johnson was promoted deputy editor by Grove's successor, Charles Moore. In 1995, after Moore's departure to edit the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, Johnson hoped to succeed him at the Sunday paper. In fact, however, the owner, Conrad Black, made Johnson editor of <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> instead. Although Johnson brought to the job all his qualities of subversive humour, intellectual curiosity, and encouragement of the young, his time at the magazine was not very successful. His lack of organizational power was marked, and he fell out irrevocably with the business management of the paper. In 1999 he was removed from his post by Black, who appointed Boris Johnson in his stead. Johnson was hurt by Black's failure to give him this decision in person.<br>
<br>Despite his eviction from the editor's chair at <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, Johnson continued to work for the Telegraph group, returning yet again to his most popular role as sketch-writer for the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. But in 1999 he developed cancer, of which, after a long struggle, he died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on 15 December 2006. He was lovingly cared for by Virginia Mary Fraser, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grose, the widow of Simon Fraser, the master of Lovat; they had married on 23 December 1998. He had no children. Although Johnson was an Anglican his funeral took place at the Roman Catholic church of the Most Holy Redeemer and St Thomas More, Cheyne Row, on 22 December. He was cremated at Mortlake crematorium, and his ashes were scattered in the Languedoc region of France, where he and his wife had a house.<br>
