<span class="headword">Stewart,  James</span>, earl of Moray  (1500&#150;1544/5), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was probably born on 21 February 1500, the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14590/', "James IV of Scotland (1473&#150;1513)")</script> and his mistress, Janet (<i>c</i>.1480&#150;<i>c</i>.1544), daughter of John Kennedy, second Lord Kennedy. On 1 June 1501 Janet Kennedy was granted Darnaway Castle and on 12 June her son was created earl of Moray, Lord Abernethy, and sheriff of Elgin and Forres. His parents seem to have had two further children, who probably died young. As a child Moray was tutored by James Watson and by the king's secretary, Patrick Paniter. In August 1508 he was sent to join his half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26454/', "Alexander Stewart")</script>, archbishop of St Andrews, studying first under Raphael Regius and later Erasmus at Padua. Erasmus later remembered Moray as a boy of &#145;great promise&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of James V</span>, 252). Alexander Stewart returned to Scotland in 1510, and presumably Moray came with him. He was probably not at the battle of Flodden, fought on 9 September 1513, where his father and the young archbishop perished.<br>
<br>Moray became significant during the minority of his half-brother James V, was favoured by the lord governor, the duke of Albany, and consistently supported the latter's Francophile party in Scotland. When the duke left Scotland for France in May 1517 Moray may have travelled with him, and in October 1519 Lord Dacre, who was warden of all the English marches and well informed about Scottish affairs, noted his return when he joined the council. In December 1521 Moray was granted a nineteen-year lease of Ross and Ardmanach, and he served in Albany's army and council during 1522&#150;4. He was a &#145;keeper&#146; of the young king in Stirling Castle between December 1523 and May 1524, and Albany also made him lieutenant of the north in January 1524, in place of the deceased third earl of Huntly. Albany then proposed his marriage to a daughter of Frederick of Denmark, describing him as &#145;an attractive young man of administrative ability and exceptional gifts&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of James V</span>, 98&#150;9).<br>
<br>In the summer of 1524 it became clear that Albany would not return to Scotland, and Queen Margaret set up a new government in which James V was supposedly ruling in his own right. Margaret was now estranged from Henry VIII's agent, the sixth earl of Angus (who was also her own second husband), and was keen to recruit Moray to her side. Therefore he was admitted to the new council and his lease of Ross and Ardmanach was confirmed. In addition, Margaret seems to have assigned Moray the wardship of the fourth earl of Huntly and offered him her daughter Lady Margaret Douglas in marriage. However, her schemes were confounded by Angus's return from exile; he joined the council in February 1525 and by August had secured custody of the king. Under Angus, Moray lost the Huntly wardship and his bride. In 1529 he married instead Lady Elizabeth Campbell (<i>d</i>. in or before 1548), daughter of Colin Campbell, third earl of Argyll. They had a daughter, Mary (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1547), who married John Stewart, master of Buchan. Between November 1525 and January 1526 Moray conspired with Queen Margaret and Arran to overthrow Angus, but came to terms after a show of force failed. Lacking an alternative, Angus confirmed Moray's appointment as lieutenant of the north in August 1526, but there was subsequently continual friction between them.<br>
<br>Moray was one of the first lords to support James V against Angus in the summer of 1528, and he was a loyal servant of the adult king. In 1530 James considered using him as lieutenant of the borders, but instead Moray exercised his lieutenancy of the north in 1530&#150;31, campaigning in Caithness and the isles. On 12 October 1532 he was appointed lieutenant-general of the Scottish realm during time of war, and lieutenant and warden-general of the east and middle marches in time of peace. He therefore acted as the commander-in-chief of the Scottish forces during the Anglo-Scottish war of 1532&#150;3. As a reward for his services he received lands in Elgin and Forres in September 1528, the wardship of Duffus in April 1530, the wardship of the sheriff of Aberdeen in January 1532, and the feu of Strathearn in May 1532.<br>
<br>In July 1535 Moray went to France as ambassador to assist Albany in arranging James V's marriage to a daughter of the duc de Vend&ocirc;me: the treaty was signed on 6 March 1536. Moray was made a knight of St Michael by Vend&ocirc;me, and instructed by Fran&ccedil;ois I to admit James V to the order. Between September 1536 and May 1537, with Moray as one of his party, James V visited the French court, jilted his fianc&eacute;e, and married Princess Madeleine instead. While Moray was in France there was tension on the borders and his wardenship of the marches was revoked and assigned to Huntly. Moray was also discharged from his post as lieutenant of the north in August 1537, but does not appear to have been replaced. In 1540 Moray was feeling infirm and planned to recover his health in France. Before going he made a will (dated Edinburgh, 8 June) which reveals the existence of a mistress, Marion Stewart, and two illegitimate children, James and Elizabeth, about whom nothing further is known. He stayed in France until February 1541.<br>
<br>Moray's health remained poor for some time. In August 1542, as hostilities with England reignited, Huntly was still lieutenant of the borders, and English spies reported that Moray was sick. Nevertheless, he replaced Huntly as lieutenant in early November, and the English thought that his pro-French, anti-protestant stance was influential with the king. In November 1542 the Scots planned a two-pronged assault on England: the king assembled a force at Lochmaben, and Moray was at Haddington with Cardinal Beaton, ready to dash across the border and pronounce a papal interdict on England before regrouping at Jedburgh. In the event Moray and Beaton never acted because the rout at Solway Moss on 24 November ruined their plan and the sudden death of the king on 14 December precipitated a political crisis.<br>
<br>Moray was a key figure in the early minority of Mary, queen of Scots. Henry VIII was determined to make her Prince Edward's bride; Moray, Beaton, Argyll, Huntly, and the infant queen's mother, Mary of Guise, were equally determined that the French alliance should endure. However, during 1543 Moray and others of his party gave the impression of being open to persuasion. Sir Ralph Sadler reported that Moray was favourably inclined to Henry VIII while remaining &#145;a great beadsman and &hellip; good Papist, wholly given to the old ceremonies and traditions of Rome&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, vol. 18, pt. 1, no. 324). Moray facilitated the reconciliation of Governor Arran with Beaton in September, and the parliament of December dashed English hopes by annulling the treaties which had been concluded at Greenwich on 1 July. In May 1544 Henry's army sacked Edinburgh in retribution, and Moray was one of the defenders forced to retreat. Henry hoped that this &#145;rough wooing&#146; would force the Scottish lords to accept the English marriage, and in December 1544 the English privy council was optimistically hoping that Moray would submit; yet five weeks earlier his countess had written to Mary of Guise, asserting his loyalty. Her letter reveals that Moray was now very ill and he died some time between December 1544 and 6 February 1545 (when a lease in Edinburgh was granted to his widow), having spent his life in the political, diplomatic, and military service of his country.<br>
