<span class="headword">Lowder,  Charles Fuge</span>  (1820&#150;1880), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, the eldest of the two sons and four daughters of Charles Lowder (1789&#150;1876), banker, and his wife, Susan Fuge (1788&#150;1871), was born at 2 West Wing, Lansdown Crescent, Bath, on 22 June 1820. After early schooling in Bath (1827&#150;34) and at Bruton grammar school (1835), he attended King's College School, London, from 1835 to 1839 and in February 1840 went up to Exeter College, Oxford, from which he received his BA, a second in classics, in 1843, and an MA in 1845. Ordained deacon at Michaelmas 1843, he went as curate to Walton, near Glastonbury, and following his priesting in December 1844 began work as chaplain to the Axbridge workhouse. In 1846 he became curate of Tetbury, and in September 1851 moved to London as assistant curate to James Skinner, senior curate of St Barnabas's, Pimlico, then a chapel of ease to St Paul's, Knightsbridge, and in the vanguard of the Anglo-Catholic revival.<br>
<br>In 1854 Lowder was briefly suspended for encouraging choirboys to throw eggs at the placard-bearer of an anti-ritualist churchwarden. During the suspension he read Louis Abelly's <span class="italic">Vie de S. Vincent de Paul</span> (1664) and conceived the idea of a secular order of priests to upgrade the clergy's spiritual life and to establish home missions among the poor. In February 1855, with five other priests, he founded the Society of the Holy Cross, which in the following February, at Lowder's suggestion, both revived retreats in the Church of England and began a home mission in Bryan King's parish of St George-in-the-East. As the Society of the Holy Cross grew and came to include most of the notable figures in the Anglo-Catholic movement, it exercised an increasing influence on its members and the church through its rules of life, its publications and monthly chapters, and its support for Anglo-Catholic parishes and beleaguered ritualist priests.<br>
<br>On 20 August 1856 Lowder left St Barnabas's to take charge of St George's mission, living in the recently bought mission house in Calvert Street, Wapping. In November 1856 the mission opened the iron chapel of the Good Shepherd in Wapping, and in the following March began services in the rented Danish chapel of St Saviour at Wellclose Square. Elizabeth Neale, sister of John Mason Neale, came in May 1857 to found under Lowder's aegis the Community of the Holy Cross, which enabled the mission to expand its work in the provision of schools, a refuge for prostitutes, a hostel for homeless girls, night classes and parish clubs, visiting, and general poor relief. From the opening of the iron chapel Lowder wore eucharistic vestments, almost certainly the first priest in London to do so. Bishop Tait complained of this and other ritual, but from May 1859 attention focused on the parish church, which with brief interludes was the scene of riots, ostensibly about ritual, until the summer of 1860. The mission clergy, especially Lowder and A. H. Mackonochie (Lowder's assistant from November 1857 to Easter 1862), bore the brunt of the disturbances, but the mission chapels themselves were relatively free of trouble. Despite accusations of Romanism Lowder was resolutely loyal to the Church of England. The secession to Rome of some of his assistants and curates in 1857&#150;8 and 1868 deeply distressed him, and on his deathbed he instructed that it should be witnessed he died an Anglican.<br>
<br>In 1860 Lowder acquired a site for a church and began to raise funds to build St Peter's, London Docks, which was consecrated on 30 June 1866. Lowder was first licensed as perpetual curate and then, on the resignation of the rector of St George's in 1873, became vicar. From July until September 1866 cholera attacked the East End, with Wapping one of the worst hit districts. The work of the clergy and sisters during the epidemic ensured their acceptance among the people, and from then on Lowder was known simply as &#145;the Father&#146;. The love of his parishioners and the esteem in which he was held in the wider church, even by those who disagreed with him, foiled efforts to prosecute him for allegedly illegal ritual. A complaint by the Church Association in 1869 under the <span class="roman">Church Discipline Act</span> was quashed by Bishop Jackson, and an attempt in 1877&#150;8 under the <span class="roman">Public Worship Regulation Act</span> was vetoed by Archbishop Tait on the advice of Jackson, who in November 1878 wrote privately to Tait that, if the prosecution of Lowder proceeded, he doubted whether the unamended <span class="roman">Public Worship Act</span> &#145;could ever be put in force again&#146;. The failure of the prosecution and the unabated ritual at St Peter's was a moral victory for the Anglo-Catholic movement, and undoubtedly contributed to the eventual acceptance of high-church ritual within the Church of England.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1870s Lowder struggled to raise the funds needed for parish work. In 1877 he published <span class="italic">Twenty-one Years in St George's Mission</span>, an update of his earlier <span class="italic">Ten Years in St George's Mission</span> (1867), in the hope of re-exciting interest and encouraging contributions. At the same time, the combination of overwork and what was probably a peptic ulcer told on his health, and he was increasingly forced to spend time out of the parish. During the 1870s his self-imposed reserve and sternness mellowed, and he allowed a natural warmth and sense of humour to show itself to colleagues and parishioners. Tall for his generation, slimly but strongly built, he impressed those who knew him with his physical courage and self-discipline, and as he grew older he won those who knew him by his gentleness and love.<br>
<br>Lowder died at Hotel Krone, in all likelihood from a perforated ulcer, while on a climbing holiday at Zell am See, Austria, on 9 September 1880. After a requiem at St Peter's on 17 September, several hundred clergy and a few thousand parishioners and friends made their way to St Nicholas's churchyard, Chislehurst, for his burial.<br>
