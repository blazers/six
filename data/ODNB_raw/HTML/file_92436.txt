<span class="headword">Freney,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1263&#150;1286), <span class="occ">Dominican friar and archbishop of Edessa</span>, is of unknown origins. He is first recorded on 1 August 1263, when Pope Urban IV, describing Freney as an Englishman who was going to the East, reported that he had been raised to episcopal rank and instructed the Latin patriarch of Antioch, Opizo di Fieschi, to consecrate him to a suitable bishopric or archbishopric &#145;in Arabia or Media or Armenia&#146;  (Guiraud, no. 338): if he became an archbishop, his province should be one not subjected to Antioch, but only to the see of Rome. Freney was duly made archbishop of Edessa (Rages or Rohes, present-day Urfa), by this time in Muslim hands for well over a century; he was the only thirteenth-century incumbent to bear the archiepiscopal title. In the following year Urban entrusted him with an embassy to Lesser (or Cilician) Armenia, which appears to have been instrumental in restoring good relations between its king, Het&#145;um I, and the Roman church: Het&#145;um's attested desire to found a Dominican convent appears to be linked with this episode. Urban, who before his election as pope had been patriarch of Jerusalem and subsequently retained a close interest in the Christian East, later made particular mention of Freney's knowledge of languages; but it is uncertain whether the appointment to Edessa was intended to equip him to preside over a large-scale missionary endeavour <i>in partibus infidelium</i> or merely to facilitate his diplomatic efforts.<br>
<br>Freney was in England by 12 February 1265, when Henry III assigned Wimborne deanery to him for his maintenance until he could return to his province or obtain an alternative dignity. In September, however, it was granted elsewhere, and Freney was assigned first 50 marks per annum from the manor of Havering and then, in October, the manor itself for life. In February 1266 he was further given the manor of Silverstone, Northamptonshire, during pleasure. He had come to England at a time of civil war. On 21 July 1266 he was deputed to escort rebels to court to treat for peace, having earlier been involved in negotiations between the royal army and the Montfortian garrison in Kenilworth Castle; he is recorded as &#145;a man of discretion and praiseworthy eloquence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Chronicle of William de Rishanger</span>, 54), but suspicion on both sides doomed his mission to failure, and he was unable even to enter the castle. At about the same time his procurations&#151;levies for his maintenance&#151;reportedly gave rise to complaint. Freney may have left England by May 1267, when the manors of Havering and Silverstone were bestowed elsewhere.<br>
<br>Freney does not resurface until August 1273, when he was again in England, having possibly encountered the Lord Edward on crusade in the Holy Land in 1271&#150;2 and returned with him; the new king granted him a tun of good wine on this occasion, and a further two tuns in 1277. In 1275 he consecrated the prior's chapel at Bury St Edmunds. He wrote to the bishop of Worcester, as a papal nuncio, on the subject of procurations and Peter's pence in November 1277. Freney was presumably the &#145;archiepiscopus Ragn.&#146; who assisted in the consecration of Norwich Cathedral in November 1278. This marked the beginning of a close association with Norfolk. In 1282 he held the manor of Cringleford and he was acting as the bishop of Norwich's suffragan by 1276, when he consecrated the site of the Carmelite friars and the high altar at Bishop's Lynn  (TNA: PRO, E 135/2/50, fols. 17 <i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). In 1280 he was present at the translation of the remains of St Hugh of Lincoln.<br>
<br>There is no further record of Freney, who does not appear to have returned to the East, and the date of his death is unknown. The inscription on his tomb in Norman French (&#145;Pray for the soul of Friar William Freney, archbishop of Rages&#146;), accompanied by the effigy of a bishop with mitre and crozier, suggests that he had retained his mendicant connections; Anian, bishop of St Asaph from 1268 to 1293, was a fellow Dominican. Now in St Mary's Church, Rhuddlan, the stone slab was probably at one time in the Dominican friary and was removed after its dissolution.<br>
