<span class="headword">Pollitt,  George Paton</span>  (1878&#150;1964), <span class="occ">chemical industrialist and farmer</span>, was born on 23 August 1878 at Ravenswing House, Mellor, near Blackburn, Lancashire, the younger son and middle child of Joseph Seddon Pollitt, a bank manager, and his wife, Charlotte Paton. He was at school in Bruges, where he learned to speak fluent French and German, and in 1899 took a BSc with honours in chemistry at the Victoria University, Manchester. He gained a PhD in the University of Basel in 1902, after three years' study at Z&uuml;rich, and in the following year an MSc at Manchester.<br>
<br>On completion of his education he entered the field of industrial chemistry and in 1907 joined the staff of Brunner, Mond &amp; Co., manufacturers of heavy chemicals. On the outbreak of war with Germany in 1914 Pollitt enlisted as a motorcycle dispatch rider and was sent on active service with the British expeditionary force immediately. He soon obtained a commission and served with the intelligence corps, the special brigade the Royal Engineers, and the infantry. His promotion was rapid: in early 1918 he was appointed to command the 11th battalion the Lancashire Fusiliers. He had been in command only for a fortnight when he was wounded and taken prisoner, and he remained in captivity for the rest of the war. His record as a non-professional soldier was remarkable. He was wounded four times, mentioned in dispatches four times, and was appointed DSO with two bars. On demobilization he was granted the rank of lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>On leaving the army Pollitt rejoined Brunner Mond and was elected a director. At this time the company was considering taking over from the government a wartime project to manufacture synthetic ammonia. The government was interested in the project as a basis for the manufacture of explosives, but the company was more interested in it as a basis for the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilizers. Not all the Brunner Mond directors were in favour of the take-over, but Pollitt was and his view prevailed. A new company, Synthetic Ammonia and Nitrates, was formed with a capital of &pound;5 million, and Pollitt was appointed managing director. The company took over a site of 266 acres, which the government had bought at Billingham in Durham, near the mouth of the River Tees and, under Pollitt's energetic direction, design and construction work was started. The factory at Billingham later became one of the largest chemical manufacturing complexes in the world.<br>
<br>In 1926 Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd was formed by a merger of the major chemical manufacturing companies in the United Kingdom, including Brunner Mond and Synthetic Ammonia and Nitrates. Pollitt took part in the negotiations leading to the merger and became a director on the first board of the new company, being one of the very few technically trained directors in its early days. Probably his most important contribution to its success was his insistence on the importance of adequate scientific research. In 1927 he was awarded the gold medal of the Society of Chemical Industry for &#145;conspicuous services to applied chemistry by research, discovery, and invention&#146;. Pollitt resigned as an executive director of ICI in 1934 but remained on the board until his retirement in 1945.<br>
<br>In 1932 Pollitt became interested in farming and acquired some 900 acres in Shropshire. He raised cattle by feeding them on fresh-cut grass in the summer and on hay in the winter. In 1937 he was awarded the silver medal of the Royal Society of Arts &#145;for the encouragement of arts, manufacture, and commerce&#146; for his paper &#145;Recent developments in grass drying&#146;. In 1942 he published a booklet entitled <span class="italic">Britain Can Feed Herself</span>, in which he claimed that if all the ploughable land in Britain were farmed up to the best standards there would be no need to import food, and that the total cost of the food produced would be no greater than the cost of most of the food imported. Although he was convinced that there was no agricultural reason why the plan should not succeed he realized that, for various reasons, political and social, it was unlikely to be adopted. During the Second World War he was appointed zone commander of the Home Guard with the rank of colonel. He was high sheriff of Shropshire in 1945&#150;6.<br>
<br>In 1947 Pollitt emigrated to Southern Rhodesia where he had bought a farm. He was no longer a young man, and his health began to suffer. He contracted cancer of the larynx and returned to England in 1952 for surgery. The operation was successful but as a result he found it difficult to speak and make himself understood. He went to live at Nansavallon, St Mawes, in Cornwall and became a recluse. He died there on 9 March 1964.<br>
<br>Pollitt never married. He was not averse to the company of women and always treated them with courtesy and consideration. He had two nephews, the sons of his brother, whom he treated as his own sons after his brother's death. Both boys took diplomas in agriculture and worked with their uncle on his farms in Shropshire and Rhodesia.<br>
<br>Pollitt was a tall man with a good physique, fair complexion, blue eyes, and close-cut sandy hair and small moustache. He was fond of outdoor exercise and always kept himself in good physical condition. His manner has been described as &#145;bluff, tactless, and masterful&#146;.<br>
