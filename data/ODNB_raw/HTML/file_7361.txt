<span class="headword">Day,  Daniel</span>  (1683&#150;1767), <span class="occ">engineer and founder of Fairlop fair, Essex</span>, was born in Southwark, Surrey, where his father was a prosperous brewer. Day never married, and resided all his working life in Wapping, then on the eastern margin of London, where he pursued his trade as an engine, pump, and block maker. He was known as an upright and ingenious mechanic, and was responsible for many improvements and inventions. His modification to the brewers' jigger&#151;a pump used to force beer into vats&#151;was in use for many years. His business prospered and he became sufficiently wealthy to enjoy the pleasures of generosity, endowing his nieces at their marriages, and lending or giving to those in need. Such was his reputation for probity that he was regularly called on to settle local disputes.<br>
<br>Day had many inoffensive eccentricities, some of which he was able to indulge at what became Fairlop fair. He owned a small estate near the Fairlop oak, a venerable and wide-spreading oak in Hainault Forest, Essex, about 10 miles from London, and went there each summer to collect his rent. It became his custom to invite a few neighbours to accompany him, and after his business was done, to partake of a meal of beans and bacon prepared by the nearby public house and consumed under the oak tree's shade. In the course of a few years, this modest beanfeast expanded into a vast gathering of local people as well as fun-seekers from London, to whom, nevertheless, Day continued to distribute beans and bacon beneath his favourite tree. The event naturally attracted a swarm of hucksters, who set up amusement stalls, giving, by 1725, the appearance of a regular fair.<br>
<br>In his youth, Day walked to Fairlop and back. Later he went on horseback, but after a fall, vowed never to mount a horse again and purchased a mule which, however, also threw him. He next took a post-chaise or cart, but in one of these he also met with an accident and thereafter refused to enter either. He then invented a machine to go by the aid of mechanical power alone, but it too failed on the third journey. His last resort was a jockey cart in which, attended by music, he made his annual trip until July 1767. For some years before his death the pump and block makers of Wapping attended the fair in a boat covered by an awning and mounted on a carriage drawn by six horses. A few years before his death the oak shed a large limb, out of which Day had a coffin made for himself. He died at Wapping on 19 October 1767; the catastrophes which he had suffered on his journeys induced him to direct that his remains be conveyed by water to his place of burial, the churchyard of Barking, Essex.<br>
<br>The roistering that accompanied the fair displeased the authorities, who made several attempts to suppress it, but it survived Day's death, the eventual destruction of Fairlop oak, and even the disafforestation of Hainault. About 1856 the area was enclosed but the fair transferred to various nearby sites before lapsing soon after 1900.<br>
