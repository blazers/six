<span class="headword">Davies,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1570&#150;1644), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Welsh scholar</span>, was born at Llanferres, Denbighshire, the son of Dafydd ab Ieuan ap Rhys, said to have been a weaver, and his wife, Elizabeth ferch Lewis ap Dafydd Lloyd. It was within a few miles of his birthplace that he came in contact with two men who set the course for his life and achievements. The first, the Gamaliel (the teacher of St Paul) at whose feet he was brought up, as he described him in the preface to his 1632 dictionary, was William Morgan, translator of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Welsh, and, at the time, vicar of a neighbouring parish. The second was Richard Parry, future bishop of St Asaph, then headmaster of the grammar school at Ruthin, which Davies attended. Davies graduated from Jesus College, Oxford, in 1594. During the following decade his movements are not known: he is speculated to have returned to teach in Ruthin or to have joined Morgan at Llandaff.<br>
<br>Davies was appointed rector of Mallwyd, Merioneth, in 1604 (the living of Llanmawddwy was added in 1613). The following year he became chaplain to Parry (elevated to St Asaph in 1604), and became a canon of the cathedral in 1612. About 1609 he married Jane Price, daughter of Llwyn Ynn, in the parish of Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd, Denbighshire. She was a granddaughter on her mother's side of Baron Lewis Owen of Dolgellau, and her sister was the wife of Richard Parry. In 1608 he resumed his studies, as a student of Lincoln College, Oxford, where he was in residence as reader of the sentences. He graduated BD the same year, and DD in 1615 (relinquished in 1621 for Llanfor). He became chancellor of St Asaph in 1617 with the prebendal stall of Llanefydd, Denbighshire.<br>
<br>Davies's achievements touched on many fields but were united by a common purpose, to propagate the faith to the people in their native tongue. The unavailability of sufficient numbers of Morgan's <span class="roman">Bible</span> of 1588 resulted in a plan to produce a new translation, one which could take into account the Authorized Version of 1611. The 1620 Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span> appeared under Parry's name, but is generally regarded to have been the work of Davies. Davies is also credited with revising the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, republished the following year, again under Parry's name.<br>
<br>Further works focusing on the Welsh language itself were an attempt to provide materials through which English-speaking clergymen could learn Welsh in order to communicate with their Welsh-speaking parishioners. Davies's Welsh grammar in Latin, <span class="italic">Antiquae linguae Britannicae &hellip; rudimenta</span> appeared in 1621. In 1632 he published a Welsh&#150;Latin dictionary, <span class="italic">Antiquae linguae Britannicae &hellip; dictionarium duplex</span>. Davies wrote the Welsh&#150;Latin section of the dictionary himself, and used Thomas Wiliems's work for the Latin&#150;Welsh sections, abridged and revised. He was forced to spend almost a year in London while the work was in the press in order to oversee its production. His dictionary was subsequently used and cited as an authority in the English dictionaries of Thomas Blount (1656) and Edward Philips (1658), and Dr Johnson had a copy of the <span class="italic">Dictionarium duplex</span> in his library.<br>
<br>In addition to his scholarly works Davies also published pastoral materials. He translated <span class="italic">The First Book of the Christian Exercise Appertayning to the Resolution</span>, the Jesuit Robert Parsons's introduction to Christian truths (as revised by Bunney), as <span class="italic">Llyfr y resolusion</span> (1632). He edited <span class="italic">Y llyfr plygain a'r catechisme</span> (1633), a mix of secular almanac and abridgement of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. It was uncommon in being pocket-size at a time when editions of the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> were normally folio. <span class="italic">Yr articulau</span> (1664) appeared posthumously.<br>
<br>From 1594 onwards Dr Davies copied a vast quantity of poetry of various periods, often hiring scribes to work for him. This extensive study of the Welsh language, and poetry in particular, informs all his published work. In 1710 Dafydd Lewys of Llanawddog printed a collection of some of Dr Davies's extracts of Welsh poetry under the title <span class="italic">Flores poetarum Britannicorum</span>.<br>
<br>Davies is said to have died at Harlech on 15 May 1644, and was buried at Mallwyd four days later. His widow later married his curate and successor, Edward Wynn.<br>
<br>Davies's achievements in propagating both the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the Welsh language deeply influenced Welsh culture. Rowland Vaughan, a contemporary, described him as &#145;the only excellent Plato of our tongue&#146;, and Sir Glanmor Williams continues to see Davies as &#145;the greatest Welsh scholar of his age, if not of all time&#146;  (Williams, <span class="italic">Recovery</span>, 476).<br>
