<span class="headword">Shute,  Samuel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1685), <span class="occ">local politician</span>, was the son of Francis Shute and his wife, Elizabeth. A linen draper by trade, he lived in the parish of St Peter's Cornhill, London, from 1658, when he married Anne Caryl (<i>d</i>. 1711), daughter of the Independent divine <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4846/', "Joseph Caryl")</script>. They had at least five children: three sons (two of whom died before Samuel and the third the year after) and two daughters, both of whom were alive when he made his will in April 1684.<br>
<br>Uncertainties in the Shute genealogy make Samuel's relationship to the civil war activist Richard Shute unclear, but they were probably closely related. Samuel and his brother Benjamin, with whom he has been confused, moved in the same London Independent circles that had attracted Richard Shute. They and their wives belonged to Joseph Caryl's gathered church; and, when Caryl's church merged with that of Dr John Owen after Caryl's death in 1673, they were friends of their new pastor and his assistant, Robert Ferguson. Yet Samuel and Benjamin Shute also held offices that point to the prominence the London Shutes had achieved during the civil war and the interregnum: Samuel was the king's draper in 1681; and the brothers were controllers for the ports of Cardiff and Swansea.<br>
<br>Samuel Shute played a leading role, as a major civic whig, in the London conclusion to the parliamentary crisis of 1678&#150;83. In 1681 he became prime warden of the Dyers' Company. He was nominated for aldermanic vacancies in 1681&#150;2, but he was passed over by the tory aldermanic majority. He served on common council for Cornhill in 1682&#150;3 and, contrary to the wishes of Charles II, he was elected sheriff of London and Middlesex, with Thomas Pilkington, for 1681&#150;2.<br>
<br>As sheriff Samuel Shute was fully involved in whig efforts to prevent Charles from regaining control of the corporation of London. He and Pilkington impanelled the London juries that returned <i>ignoramus</i> verdicts to the government's indictments of Stephen College in July 1681 and of the earl of Shaftesbury in November 1681. Indeed Shute reportedly encouraged the whig crowds that celebrated Shaftesbury's acquittal with the words, &#145;Shout, boys, &hellip; shout&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1680&#150;81</i>, 583). Shute and Pilkington were similarly instrumental in securing common hall majorities for whig candidates in the London shrieval election of 1682, only to see them overturned by the crown's agents. They clashed repeatedly with the loyalist lord mayor about polling, defied orders of the privy council, and were dispatched to the Tower at one point by an enraged monarch. Shute was one of fourteen leading civic whigs charged with riot in this election, a charge of which they were convicted in 1683. Shute was then fined 1000 marks.<br>
<br>Tory satirists such as John Dryden and Nahum Tate dismissed Shute as &#145;hot-brain'd&#146;, as a lightweight &#145;shuttlecock&#146;, and as being as often &#145;warm with wine&#146; as he was &#145;drunk with zeal&#146;  (Lord and others, 3.275, 195). Shute was regularly in the company of whig grandees such as Shaftesbury and Monmouth during his shrievalty; and, after the disclosures about whig plotting in 1682&#150;3, Lord Howard of Escrick claimed that he had been told that Shute was &#145;ready for action&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July&#150;September 1683</i>, 92). Shute's son Francis, who died in 1683, apparently acted as an intermediary between Howard and Robert West, one of the masterminds of the Rye House plot. In the absence of other evidence, the government ignored Howard's information about Samuel Shute.<br>
<br>Shute died in 1685 with personalty worth about &pound;9000, city property, a house in Essex, and lands in Shropshire, Glamorgan, and Montgomeryshire. He was buried on 12 November 1685 in the parish church of St Peter's Cornhill. Two kinsmen preserved the family's prominence into the next generation. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25488/', "Samuel Shute (1662&#150;1742)")</script> was governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1716 to 1727. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1531/', "John Shute Barrington (1678&#150;1734)")</script> was MP for Berwick upon Tweed from 1715 to 1723.<br>
