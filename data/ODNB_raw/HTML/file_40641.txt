<span class="headword">Mansell,  Bussy</span>  (1623&#150;1699), <span class="occ">soldier and politician</span>, was born at Briton Ferry, Glamorgan, on 22 November 1623, the second son of Arthur Mansell (<i>d</i>. in or before 1628), himself a second son, and his wife, Jane Price (<i>d</i>. 1638), heir of a Briton Ferry family. The main branch of the Mansell family in south Wales was seated at Margam and was descended from the Somersets, earls of Worcester. Mansell's forename was an acknowledgement of his paternal grandfather's second marriage to the widow of John Bussy of Lincolnshire. Nothing is known of his formative years or education, but it was natural that the Mansell family, within the sphere of influence of the royalist fifth earl of Worcester, should have been mobilized on behalf of the king during the civil war. At the age of twenty-one Mansell was active in the western hundreds of Glamorgan in raising taxes for the royalist war effort and in sequestrating the few parliamentarian activists in the county. When the Glamorgan &#145;peaceable army&#146; was formed in 1645 as a reaction against the depredations of the royalist commanders he became a prominent member of it, having recently been appointed colonel-general of the king's forces in south Wales. When his disloyalty was discovered he confessed his move had been a misjudgement, and promised on 13 September to prove his allegiance to Charles I. Four days later, however, Mansell was one of those in the peace army to whom the royalists surrendered Cardiff Castle. By 28 October he had espoused the parliamentarian cause at Cardiff, and by 17 November was being recommended for the post of commander-in-chief of parliament's forces in south Wales. The recommendation, by the most committed parliamentarians of Glamorgan, was later accepted by the House of Commons. Mansell was still only twenty-two years old, and although these moves have been taken as evidence of his military prowess and political adroitness, it is also possible to see him at this time as something of a <i>roi fain&eacute;ant</i>, pushed forward in the interests of social respectability by men like Philip Jones, who provided the real steer for winning the political war in south Wales for parliament. On occasions of military crisis in the region&#151;when the royalist gentry rose in February 1646 and June 1647 and when the disaffected Rowland Laugharne turned against his former parliamentary masters in May 1648&#151;Mansell played supporting roles to other commanders.<br>
<br>On 17 April 1646 Mansell married Catherine (<i>d</i>. in or before 1678), widow of Sir Edward Stradling of St Donats, a leading Glamorgan royalist, at a time when the resolve of parliamentarians in the county was hardening. The marriage proved no obstacle to his continuing good standing in the eyes of the king's opponents. Between 1648 and 1653 he was part of the circle of committeemen around Philip Jones, and sat on the commission for the propagation of the gospel in Wales (February 1650) and the high court of justice against royalist insurgents in the principality in 1651. The names of Jones and Mansell were inseparable in south Wales public affairs during the rule of the Rump Parliament, and it was surely Jones's patronage that secured Mansell a place in the nominated assembly of July to December 1653. On this new stage Mansell was able to find some independence from Jones, and it was perhaps as an expression of this freedom that Mansell supported the radical minority in the assembly that sought the abolition of tithes. This was opposed to the pro-Cromwellian line taken by Jones, and Mansell on no other occasion expressed support for the demands of the millenarians. He never again held a parliamentary seat until the Restoration, although he continued to hold local office, proof that his relations with the all-powerful Jones remained amicable.<br>
<br>The Mansell family name and his earlier loyalties made Mansell an attractive target for agents recruiting support for the future Charles II in what had been such a royalist region. On the eclipse of Philip Jones during the revived Rump Parliament he became the leading military figure in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire; at the same time Edward Hyde considered him an ally. By late September 1659 Hyde had to write off Mansell, who initially stuck to the republican cause before using his local offices to move with George Monck towards the Restoration. He was double returned for Cardiff Boroughs in the Convention of 1660, and had to wait until 27 June to be declared victor. He conformed easily to the restored monarchy, and became a leading figure in Glamorgan local administration, although his sympathies were decidedly whig: he was a patron of dissenting congregations. At some point before May 1678 he married, after the death of his first wife, a woman whose forename alone, Anne, is known. When he returned to parliament to sit for Glamorgan in March 1679 he was sympathetic to the exclusionists, but was not particularly active in that assembly or the succeeding one of October. He did not stand for the county in the 1681 elections, but instead took Cardiff Boroughs. Mansell was imprisoned briefly during Monmouth's rising, and supported the 1688 revolution without reservation. His reputation as a political weathervane persisted: in 1687 he was lampooned as<blockquote>
<div>Hospitable Bush, who cares not a rush<br>
</div>
<div>What hurries, so himself be secure,<br>
</div>
<div>With his friends and his glass,<br>
</div>
<div>Now and then a private lass,<br>
</div>
<div>Can all these adventures endure.<br>
</div> (J. P. Jenkins, &#145;Two poems on the Glamorgan gentry in the reign of James II&#146;, <span class="italic">National Library of Wales Journal</span>, 21, 1979&#150;80, 171)</blockquote>From 1689 Mansell sat once more for Glamorgan and was listed by Robert Harley as a member of the country opposition, but from 1694 he was given leave of absence from the House of Commons, probably on grounds of age and ill health. In 1696, following the attempt on the life of William III, Mansell readily signed the Association for the king's defence. He died at Briton Ferry on 5 May 1699 and was buried there on 25 May. His property passed to his only grandson, his son, Thomas, having predeceased him.<br>
