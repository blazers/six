<span class="headword">Holland,  Samuel</span>  (1803&#150;1892), <span class="occ">slate industrialist and railway promoter</span>, was born on 17 October 1803 in Duke Street, Liverpool, the youngest son and fifth child of Samuel Holland (1768&#150;1851), merchant, and his wife, Katherine Menzies (<i>d</i>. 1847). He had two brothers and three sisters and was educated at the Revd William Lamport's school in Lancaster and then in Hanau, Germany (<i>c</i>.1815&#150;1817). He was twice married: in 1850 he married Ann Robbins (<i>d</i>. 1877), and his second wife was Caroline Jane Burt (<i>d</i>. 1924). There were no children by either marriage.<br>
<br>In 1820 the elder Samuel Holland leased a slate quarry at Rhiwbryfdir, in the parish of Ffestiniog, from W. G. Oakeley of Tan-y-Bwlch, Maentwrog, and in 1821 his son was put in charge of this quarry. He built a cart road down to his quay on the River Dwyryd, from which the slate was boated to the new harbour at Porthmadog. The quarry was sold in 1825 for &pound;28,000 to what became known as the Welsh Slate Company. Another quarry above Rhiwbryfdir was taken over by the younger Samuel Holland in 1828, and was worked by him until 1877. In 1882 it became part of the complex of quarries called the Oakeley Quarry.<br>
<br>Holland played a crucial part in the rise and fall of the Ffestiniog Railway, designed for the carriage of slates from Blaenau Ffestiniog to Porthmadog. By chance, in 1829, he encountered Henry Archer (1799&#150;1863), a Dubliner, who was interested in railways. Holland persuaded James Spooner (1789&#150;1856) to survey the line with Thomas Pritchard, and Archer raised most of the capital in Dublin. Local opposition had defeated schemes in the 1820s and it took three attempts to get Archer's parliamentary bill through the House of Commons; it was finally approved on 25 May 1832. Archer became managing director of the railway. The gauge was 1 foot 11&frac12; inches, and the line was 14 miles long. Opening day was 20 April 1836 and Holland was the first quarry owner to use the horse-drawn railway. By 1860 all the large quarries near Blaenau Ffestiniog were connected to it. In 1863 two steam locomotives, designed by Holland's nephew, Charles Menzies Holland, were in use and in 1869 R. F. Fairlie produced the <i>Little Wonder</i> with its double engine. In 1865 passenger trains were introduced; and from 1867 there was also a quarrymen's train, which ran twice weekly at first and then daily from 1881.<br>
<br>The Ffestiniog Railway brought prosperity, but Holland and other industrialists began to look for other outlets for their slate at lower rates. Holland was the chief promoter of the Ffestiniog and Blaenau Railway, which was opened in 1868 and went from the terminus of the Ffestiniog Railway to the village of Ffestiniog, a distance of 3&frac12; miles. It was converted to standard gauge in 1883, and thereafter was worked by the Great Western Railway (GWR). Holland was also one of the directors of the Bala and Ffestiniog Railway, which was formed in 1873. This came to a working agreement with the GWR in 1879, and took over the Ffestiniog and Blaenau Railway in 1883.<br>
<br>Holland helped to get the tax on slate carried coastwise repealed in 1831, and, with other quarry owners, he persuaded the Board of Trade to include slate in the Anglo-French commercial treaty, which was negotiated by Cobden in 1860. Agreements with Norway, Sweden, and Denmark followed. In 1862 Holland was high sheriff of Merioneth. He was also deputy lieutenant for Merioneth and Caernarvonshire. He was a popular Liberal MP for Merioneth from 1870 to 1885 and was a JP and chairman of the board of guardians. He was opposed to trade unions and believed in a divide between employer and employee, but he had no confrontations with his quarrymen. In the 1850s he introduced gas lighting in his quarry, which, from 1840, had surface and underground workings. In 1873, a peak year, he employed about 500 men and 18,494 tons of slate were produced. Holland also invented a slate-dressing machine and he sent examples of his slate to the Paris Exhibition of 1854, gaining an honourable mention.<br>
<br>In partnership with John Whitehead Greaves, Holland founded the Porthmadog Mutual Ship Insurance Company, and in 1845 he promoted the Porthmadog Savings Bank, declaring it would instil habits of economy, industry, and self-dependence into the &#145;labouring classes&#146;. He subscribed to the Oakeley hospital and built cottages at Tanygrisiau. In 1835 he founded a school at Penrhyndeudraeth, which was organized on the model of the British and Foreign Society schools. He also promoted Dr Williams's School for Girls, a fee-paying school and a nonconformist establishment which opened in Dolgellau in 1878. Holland's cousin Mrs Elizabeth Gaskell was staying with him in 1848 when <span class="italic">Mary Barton</span> was published. Photographs of him in maturity show a man of shrewd expression with imposing side-whiskers. Holland was resident at Cae'rdeon, Llanaber, near Barmouth, from the 1870s, and he died there on 27 December 1892. He was buried at Cae'rdeon church, and was survived by his second wife.<br>
