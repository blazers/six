<span class="headword">Kyle,  James Francis</span>  (1788&#150;1869), <span class="occ">vicar apostolic of the northern district of Scotland and historical collector</span>, was born at Quarryholes, near Abbeyhill, in Edinburgh, on 22 September 1788, the eldest son of the four children of James Kyle (<i>d</i>. 1799), commissioner of roads and bridges for the war office, and his wife, Margaret Strachan, daughter of a Banff doctor. Although the elder James Kyle was a protestant, after his premature death, his son was brought up in his mother's faith as a Catholic. He was educated for three years at Edinburgh high school, before attending the Roman Catholic seminary at Aquhorties in Aberdeenshire from October 1799. His maternal uncle wanted to make him heir to his East India Company fortune and connections, but Kyle chose instead to enter holy orders, being ordained as priest in 1812. He remained at Aquhorties for twenty-seven years, becoming a master in 1808 and later prefect of studies. His scholarly instincts, however, were not to be truly fulfilled: in January 1826 he was sent as a missioner to the parish of St Andrew in Glasgow, where he spent several arduous years and much family money in the Clyde Street church. On 13 February 1827 he was appointed bishop <i>in partibus</i> of Germanicia and vicar apostolic of the newly created northern district of Scotland. He was consecrated at Aberdeen by Bishop Alexander Paterson of the eastern district on 28 September 1828.<br>
<br>Kyle proved to be an effective vicar apostolic, though he initially faced the problems relating to the new seminary at Blairs. This house and estate had been donated to the Scottish missions by the wealthy John Menzies of Pitfodel, and Kyle had been appointed mainly to manage the new foundation. The donor's disappointment with the educational system developed at the seminary, and conflicts over the tenancy of the accompanying land, plagued Kyle's early career as vicar apostolic. He was supported, however, by the coadjutor of the western district, Bishop Andrew Scott, whose active and energetic character complemented Kyle's more cautious and intellectual one. A portrait of Kyle, probably painted about this time, shows a long-faced man with dishevelled dark hair: his expression is solemn and rather reserved.<br>
<br>Owing to the intractability of Menzies and Charles Gordon (1772&#150;1855), who was overseeing the conversion of Blairs, Kyle chose to fix his episcopal headquarters at the parish of St Gregory, Preshome, from where he presided over a district of 13,000 square miles. With the foundation of the new district, new finances had become available, and Kyle was able to build many new chapels and schools. His high view of the position of the priest&#151;he had opposed the mixing of clerical and secular students at Aquhorties, and he now deplored the tendency of highland priests to supplement their incomes by farming&#151;further indicated the vigorous new direction of Scottish Catholicism.<br>
<br>Despite a useful episcopal career, Kyle was more significant as a collector of early historical documents relating to the history of Catholic Scotland, some of which were formerly in the Scots College in Paris. He numbered his letters and papers at 30,000, but a modern estimate suggests that he collected up to 75,000. Kyle supplied Prince Aleksandr Lobanov-Rostovsky with sources for his publication of the letters of Mary, queen of Scots, and he also succeeded in deciphering the secret letter code of the queen. Kyle died at Preshome on 23 February 1869, and was buried in the church there. His collections are now deposited at Columba House in Edinburgh: to him the Scottish Roman Catholic church owes the best part of its pre-Reformation archives.<br>
