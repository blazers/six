<span class="headword">Fuller,  Peter Michael</span>  (1947&#150;1990), <span class="occ">art critic and magazine editor</span>, was born on 31 August 1947 in Damascus, the second child and elder son in the family of two sons and a daughter of Harold William Charles Fuller, general medical practitioner, and his wife, Marjorie Dale Noyes, midwife. His childhood was largely spent in Eastleigh, a Hampshire railway town, where the family attended the Union Baptist church on Sundays. Fuller was baptized by complete immersion in 1961, just before he went away to board at Epsom College, a public school closely connected with the medical profession. Although he liked the fact that both John Piper and Graham Sutherland went to Epsom College, Fuller was unhappy there. He doubted his religious convictions and felt bewildered by the loss of earlier certainties.<br>
<br>The sense of confusion intensified while Fuller read English at Peterhouse, Cambridge, between 1965 and 1968. He obtained a second class (division two) in both parts of the English tripos (1967 and 1968). He later described his time at Cambridge as &#145;a period of personal crisis&#146;, and found his Baptist faith increasingly inadequate. Psychiatric problems aggravated his disquiet, and he consulted a psychoanalyst in his last year at Cambridge. By that time Fuller had fallen under the influence of Marxism and the far left. Revolution was in the air, and Marxist literature formed much of his reading. But he also staged an exhibition of his paintings at the Cambridge Union, and in 1967 met his future wife, Colette Marie M&eacute;jean, a French student whose father was a village postmaster. They married in 1971, and five years later their only child, Sylvia Leda, was born. After Cambridge, Fuller worked at first as a journalist on <span class="italic">City Press</span>, a City of London newspaper, whose motto was &#145;The voice of honest capitalism&#146;. His interest in Marxism intensified, and he began writing for the underground press&#151;most notably, <span class="italic">Black Dwarf</span> and <span class="italic">Seven Days</span>. A visit to Argentina allowed him to witness a struggle for national liberation, and he became an avid reader of the <span class="italic">New Left Review</span>. But his involvement with theoretical debate overlaid what he afterwards termed &#145;a deep sense of fragmentation&#146;. Gambling and masochism grew into compulsive obsessions, and he began a five-year period of psychoanalysis in 1972.<br>
<br>Apart from editing a book entitled <span class="italic">The Psychology of Gambling</span> (1974), with Jon Halliday, Fuller became a regular contributor to <span class="italic">Arts Review</span>, <span class="italic">Connoisseur</span>, <span class="italic">Art and Artists</span>, <span class="italic">Art Monthly</span>, and <span class="italic">Studio International</span>. Some of his most substantial reviews appeared in <span class="italic">New Society</span>, to which he had been introduced by the writer who influenced him most powerfully during the 1970s, John Berger. They became friends, and Fuller also got to know the American painter Robert Natkin, about whom he wrote articles, catalogues, and finally a book (<span class="italic">Robert Natkin</span>, 1981). The most impressive outcome of his work during the 1970s was <span class="italic">Art and Psychoanalysis</span> (1980).<br>
<br>The advent of a new decade brought momentous changes. Colette left Fuller in 1981, and they were divorced four years later. John Berger's influence was superseded by that of John Ruskin, whose ideas dominated Fuller's book <span class="italic">Theoria: Art, and the Absence of Grace</span> (1988). He repudiated Marxism, along with most of the friends he had made in the 1970s. Berger came under particularly virulent attack, and Fuller revised an earlier publication called <span class="italic">Seeing Berger</span> (1980) under the new, caustic title <span class="italic">Seeing through Berger</span> (1988). New friends, such as the philosopher Roger Scruton, now aligned him more with the right than the left. He became a fierce opponent of the avant-garde, calling instead for a return to the romantic and figurative tradition in British art. Marriage to the Australian sculptor Stephanie Jane Burns in 1985 brought him enormous happiness as well as a son, Laurence Ruskin Fuller, who was born in 1986. Stephanie was the daughter of Alan Robert Burns, company chairman and inventor. Two years later Fuller founded his own art magazine with the suitably Ruskinian title <span class="italic">Modern Painters</span>, as a pulpit for his views. It was an immediate success, not only because of Fuller's combative and controversial editorials, but also on account of his willingness to publish a lively range of views from novelists as well as critics. The attention attracted by the magazine helped to make Fuller more widely known, and his appointment as art critic of the <span class="italic">Sunday Telegraph</span> in 1989 gave him another public platform. A regular column there enabled him to champion artists like the painter John Bellany and the sculptor Glynn Williams, both of whom Fuller saw upholding the values he cherished.<br>
<br>Slight in build, and invariably pale, Fuller often looked as if he had just emerged from a long period incarcerated in his study. Behind spectacles, his eyes would often narrow as if to cope with the unaccustomed glare of daylight. Living in Bath, with a country cottage at Stowlangtoft in Suffolk, he enjoyed his greatest period of success and notoriety. But a motorway accident on 28 April 1990, when he was forty-two, cut everything short. His chauffeur-driven car crashed into a field off the M4 motorway, near Theale. Fuller died at the scene, of head and neck injuries. His wife, thirty-three weeks pregnant, broke a hip, damaged her spine, and lost her unborn child, Gabriel, as a result of the accident. Gabriel and Fuller were buried together at St George's Church, Stowlangtoft. A large sculpture called <span class="italic">Opening Chestnut</span>, by Glynn Williams, stands at the head of the grave.<br>
