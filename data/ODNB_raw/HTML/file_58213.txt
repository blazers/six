<span class="headword">Hallowes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Brailly]</span>,  Odette Marie C&eacute;line</span>  (1912&#150;1995), <span class="occ">special operations officer and member of the FANY</span>, was born on 28 April 1912 in Amiens, northern France, the only daughter in the family of three children of Gaston Brailly (<i>c</i>.1880&#150;1918), banker, and his wife, Yvonne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Quennchen (<i>c</i>.1880&#150;1960). Her father, a sergeant in the French 52nd infantry, was killed at Verdun in October 1918. Her paternal grandfather would regularly take her to visit her father's grave and say &#145;In twenty years there will be another war &hellip; and you will have to do your duty as your father did&#146;  (private information). Odette was educated at the Convent of Ste Th&eacute;r&egrave;se in Amiens and privately. In 1931 she married an Englishman engaged in the hotel trade, Roy Patrick Sansom (<i>c</i>.1911&#150;1957). A daughter, Fran&ccedil;oise, was born in 1932. In 1933 they moved to Britain, where Lili (<i>b</i>. 1934) and Marianne (<i>b</i>. 1936) were born. At the outbreak of war Roy Sansom was called up and Odette moved with her daughters to Somerset. In the early spring of 1942 she responded to a radio appeal for photographs of France. She was invited for interview at the War Office, where Selwyn Jepson, impressed by her strength of character, invited her to join the Special Operations Executive (SOE), set up in 1940 in response to Winston Churchill's directive to &#145;set Europe ablaze&#146; by the training and supplying of local resistance groups in all zones of war.<br>
<br>Odette joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY), as did most female SOE agents, and was trained in self-defence, Morse code, map reading, shooting, and how to resist interrogation. In November 1942, leaving her daughters in school, carefully dressed in French clothes, with new French fillings in her teeth, and carrying forged French papers, she was landed by small boat near Cassis. Codenamed Lise, she was to cross to occupied France to join a resistance circuit in Auxerre. She was met by Peter Morland Churchill (<i>d</i>. 1972), codenamed Raoul. On 11 November, in response to the allied invasion of north Africa, the Nazis invaded Vichy France. Churchill persuaded SOE in London to allow Odette to stay as his courier, first in Cannes, before moving to St Jorioz, near Annecy, in February 1943, together with Adolphe Rabinovitch (&#145;Arnaud&#146;), their radio operator. On 16 April, betrayed by a double agent, Odette and Churchill were arrested, Rabinovitch escaped. He was captured on another mission and was executed at Rawicz in 1944. Odette, silent in the face of very harsh treatment by the Gestapo, including months of solitary confinement, protected Rabinovitch, her French colleagues, and Francis Cammaerts (&#145;Roger&#146;), newly arrived in France, who was to run one of the most successful circuits of the war. She also protected Churchill by persuading the Germans that he was related to Winston Churchill.<br>
<br>Odette was condemned to death on two counts, as a Frenchwoman guilty of crimes under German law and as a British spy. &#145;You must take your pick, gentlemen. I can only die once.&#146; In May 1944 she was sent to Germany, where she ended up in Ravensbr&uuml;ck camp, north of Berlin. There she was again kept in solitary confinement for some months, close to the punishment block, where she was an unseen witness to the brutality of the prison regime: the beatings, the executions, the rumble of carts taking the previous night's dead to the nearby crematorium. Suffering from tuberculosis, she was eventually moved to the camp hospital, and survived execution orders issued by Berlin in early 1945. Fellow SOE agents Violette Szabo and Denise Bloch of FANY, and Lilian Rolfe and Cecily LeFort of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), were murdered. In April the camp commander, Fritz S&uuml;hren, still believing Odette to be a Churchill, tried to save his own skin by driving her to the American lines. On arrival she denounced him. She gave evidence against him and several of the camp staff at the N&uuml;remberg trials. S&uuml;hren was hanged. Odette was made MBE in 1945, and in August 1946 she was the first woman to be awarded the George Cross. In 1949 a book by Jerrad Tickell, <span class="italic">Odette</span>, appeared, followed by a film of the same name. Odette co-operated with both projects, not for her own glory but from a sense of responsibility to her murdered colleagues: &#145;My comrades, who did far more and suffered more profoundly, are not here to speak. Because of this I speak for them&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 17 March 1995).<br>
<br>Odette was divorced from Roy Sansom in 1946 and on 15 February 1947 she married Peter Churchill. Churchill, the son of William Algernon Churchill, consular official, was by then a captain in the intelligence corps. He was later a writer and estate agent. They divorced in 1955 and on 6 January the following year Odette married Geoffrey Macleod Hallowes (<i>b</i>. 1918), wine and spirit shipper, son of Edward Price Hallowes, wine and spirit shipper. Geoffrey Hallowes had served with SOE in France as a Jedburgh.<br>
<br>Odette was a petite, light-haired woman, vividly attractive and always immaculately dressed, whose air of fragility belied her great inner strength. It is a measure of the fame she achieved that she was known simply as &#145;Odette GC&#146;. She became a vice-president of the FANY in 1967. She was a prominent member of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association, a founder vice-president of the Woman of the Year luncheon, vice-president of the Military Medallist League, an honorary member of St Dunstan's Ex-Prisoner-of-War Association, and president of 282 air cadet squadron. She died on 13 March 1995 at her home, Rosedale, 8 Eriswell Road, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, of cardiac arrest following broncho-pneumonia, and was buried at Burvale cemetery, Walton-on-Thames. She was survived by her husband, Geoffrey Hallowes, and the three daughters of her first marriage. She is commemorated on the FANY war memorial at St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, London, where the names of the dead SOE women agents are listed and where she laid a wreath on remembrance Sunday every year. On her plaque is written: &#145;Here she laid violets, transforming into service the pain of her survival&#146;. Her medals are in the Imperial War Museum, London.<br>
