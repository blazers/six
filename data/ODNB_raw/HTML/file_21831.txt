<span class="headword">Pender, Sir  John</span>  (1816&#150;1896), <span class="occ">textile merchant and telegraph entrepreneur</span>, was born on 10 September 1816, at Bonhill, Dunbartonshire, Scotland, the second child of James Pender, textile merchant of the Vale of Leven, Dunbartonshire, and his wife, Marion, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mason. Pender had a sister, Margaret, born in 1814. He was educated at the village school, then at Glasgow high school, where he received a gold medal for design. He followed his father's trade, and by the age of twenty-one was the manager of a Glasgow textile firm, before embarking as a textile trader on his own account. He established himself in Glasgow, and then in Manchester, soon developing an extensive trade in fabrics to China, India, and the East, which brought him considerable wealth. In 1840 he married Marion (<i>d</i>. 1841), daughter of James Cairns of Glasgow. They had a son, James. In 1851 he married Emma (<i>d</i>. 1890), daughter of Henry Denison of Daybrook, Arnold, Nottinghamshire; they had two sons, Henry and John, and two daughters.<br>
<br>When a transatlantic cable was proposed, Pender was among those who invested in the new Atlantic Telegraph Company, formed on 20 October 1856. After various failures, a cable was successfully laid in the summer of 1858 but, although messages were passed, the link soon deteriorated. It failed after a few months, and never carried commercial traffic. Work continued, however, to improve both the cables and the associated telegraph apparatus, and Pender retained his interest in the affair. On 7 April 1864 he brought together the firms of Glass, Elliot, cable manufacturers, and the Gutta Percha Company, makers of insulated cable core, to found the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company (TCM), under his chairmanship. Pender and his co-director Daniel Gooch, who was also a director of the Great Western Railway Company and of the company that owned the ship <i>Great Eastern</i>, raised funds, and made an offer to the Atlantic Telegraph Company to make and lay a new transatlantic cable, chartering the <i>Great Eastern</i> as the only vessel large enough to carry the 2500 nautical miles of cable needed to span the ocean between Ireland and Newfoundland. Laying commenced in the summer of 1865, but was brought to a stop when the cable was lost in deep water. At this critical point, Pender offered his personal guarantee of &pound;250,000, a new cable was manufactured, and in 1866 it was successfully laid. Much of the lost cable was recovered, and a second crossing completed.<br>
<br>In 1868 Gooch took over the chairmanship of TCM, leaving Pender to form the group of companies which were to link England with much of the rest of the world. Pender reorganized the four companies involved in the link to India: the British-Indian Submarine Telegraph Company, the Falmouth, Gibraltar, and Malta Telegraph Company, the Marseilles, Algiers, and Malta Telegraph Company, and the Anglo-Mediterranean Telegraph Company. When the line was completed, a grand celebration was held on 23 June 1870 at Pender's house, 18 Arlington Street, off Piccadilly, in London. The first messages were simply &#145;How are you?&#146;, to which came the reply &#145;All well&#146;. The astonishing fact that this exchange took less than five minutes, when communication with India had previously taken several months, was truly a cause for celebration. Some 700 guests thronged Pender's house and the pavilion erected in his courtyard, ranging in status from the royalty of England and India through assorted European nobility and diplomats, naval officers, and other important persons. They were entertained by Cromwell Varley and Apps who performed various spectacular electrical and telegraphic demonstrations. Many messages were then passed to India; the <span class="italic">Liverpool Courier</span> reporting in awe, &#145;Sitting in the house of a commoner, the Prince of Wales sent a message to the Viceroy in India&#146;  (<span class="italic">Souvenir of the Inaugural Fete</span>, 53). This link with a distant colony was to change for ever the relationship of governor and governed.<br>
<br>Pender went on to form in 1872 the Eastern Telegraph Company, which absorbed numerous smaller companies and played an important role in the defence and prosperity of the United Kingdom. He came to preside over companies capitalized to nearly &pound;15 million and operating over 73,000 nautical miles of cable. Eastern ultimately became the largest submarine telegraph company in the world.<br>
<br>In his later years Pender, as chairman of the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, the largest undertaking of its kind, concerned himself with the electric lighting of London. He sat in parliament as Liberal member for Totnes in 1862&#150;6, but was unseated on petition. In 1868 he unsuccessfully contested Linlithgowshire, but was returned for the Wick burghs, as a Liberal from 1872 to 1885 and as a Liberal Unionist from 1892 to 1896, when he resigned. He unsuccessfully contested the Wick burghs in 1885, the Stirling burghs and Wick burghs in 1886, and Govan in 1889. On the occasion of his being made a KCMG in 1888 the earl of Derby presided at a grand banquet in his honour, held in the Hotel Metropole, and presented to Lady Pender a portrait of Sir John by Hubert Herkomer RA. In 1892 he was promoted to GCMG. He held many foreign orders, among them the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and the grand cordon of the Mejidiye. He was also a fellow of the Imperial Institute, of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, of the Royal Geographical Society, and of the Scottish Society of Antiquaries.<br>
<br>At one of his company meetings, Pender confessed to his shareholders that he had few outside interests, apart from yachting; nevertheless he held a very fine collection of porcelain, pictures, and fine art, which after his death took some eight days to pass under the hammer at Christies. A lavish privately published catalogue of 1894 detailed the oils, watercolours, drawings, and sculpture at Arlington Street and at Foots Cray Place, his country seat in Kent. Pender died at Foots Cray on 7 July 1896. He was buried in the parish churchyard. His son James sat as MP for Mid-Northamptonshire from 1895 to 1900, and was created a baronet in 1897; Henry died in 1881; and the youngest son, John Cuthbert Denison-Pender, followed in his father's footsteps, becoming manager, director, or chairman of numerous telegraph and cable companies. The younger daughter, Marion Denison, married Sir George William des Voeux, a colonial governor.<br>
