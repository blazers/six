<span class="headword">Atterbury,  Lewis</span>  (1656&#150;1731), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born on 2 May 1656 at Caldecote, near Newport Pagnell in Buckinghamshire, the son of <a name="cosubject_872"></a><span class="headword">Lewis Atterbury</span>  (1630/31&#150;1693), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, and his wife, Elizabeth Giffard (<i>d</i>. 1668).<br>
<br>The elder Lewis Atterbury was the son of Francis Atterbury (<i>b</i>. 1603/4), rector of Middleton Malsor, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Alice (<i>c</i>.1628&#150;1704). He matriculated at Oxford on 7 April 1647, at the age of sixteen; he was elected a student of Christ Church in 1648, graduated BA in 1650, and proceeded MA in 1652. He followed his father's example in conforming to the ecclesiastical requirements of the Commonwealth and protectorate, in his own case with evident eagerness: in 1654 he was rewarded with a lucrative living, Great Rissington in Gloucestershire, and three years later added to this the rectory of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, which he held in plurality. At the Restoration he changed tack again, secured a doctorate in divinity from Oxford in 1660 (incorporated at Cambridge in 1664), and a place as chaplain to Henry, duke of Gloucester. But this orientation was not entirely successful: though keeping Milton Keynes he lost the more valuable rectory of Great Rissington and was denied any greater preferment than a prebendary's stall in Lincoln Cathedral, which came to him only in 1690. Going to law on almost any pretext became his consolation. He died on 7 December 1693 in a drowning accident near his home at Milton Keynes. He had published three sermons, including <span class="italic">A Good Subject, or, The Right Test of Religion and Loyalty</span> (1684), which he had delivered at the Buckinghamshire assizes in 1684; and after the revolution of 1688 the retrospective <span class="italic">Babylon's Downfall, or, England's Happy Deliverance from Popery and Slavery</span> (1691). He first preached the latter, a heavily apocalyptic reading of the events of 1688, at Milton Keynes on 17 February 1689, and was sufficiently pleased with it to repeat the performance at the London Guildhall in June 1691.<br>
<br>Lewis Atterbury the younger was educated at Westminster School under the care of his father's friend Richard Busby. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1674. Having graduated BA in 1679 he was ordained deacon in the same year, proceeded MA in 1680, and a year later took priest's orders. His first step on the ladder of preferment came in 1684 when he was made chaplain to the mayor of London, Sir William Pritchard (who owned an estate in Buckinghamshire), and the following year he was given the rectory of Sywell in Northamptonshire. He strengthened his City contacts still further in December 1688, when he married Penelope (<i>b</i>. in or before 1665, <i>d</i>. 1723), daughter of John Bedingfield and niece of Robert Bedingfield, a future mayor of London, and in 1691 Atterbury was appointed lecturer at St Mary-at-Hill, London. Evidently an absentee rector he settled at Highgate, officiating for the preacher at Highgate chapel, whom he eventually succeeded in 1695.<br>
<br>To judge from the text of his printed sermons Atterbury was an accomplished, if not a rousing, performer in the pulpit: a safe choice as chaplain to the Princess Anne, whom he continued to serve in this capacity after her accession to the throne. In 1707 the queen granted him the rectory of Shepperton, Middlesex, after the deprivation of its nonjuring incumbent, but he does not seem ever to have been considered for any higher ecclesiastical dignity. Although probably a moderate tory, in so far as he displayed any partisan sympathies at all in his public life, he avoided controversy so successfully that he was continued as a royal chaplain under George I, while his high-flying younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/871/', "Francis Atterbury")</script>, bishop of Rochester, became a political pariah. Not surprisingly, perhaps, relations between the brothers cooled somewhat, the more so when in 1720 Lewis applied to Francis for episcopal recommendation to the deanery of Rochester, whose holder was mortally ill, and Francis refused, claiming to be pre-engaged to another and also suggesting that there was something &#145;indecent&#146; in discussing the matter while the dean was still alive. Lewis bridled at the word &#145;indecent&#146; but swallowed his disappointment. As long as his health remained he made a point of preaching every Sunday; in other respects, too, he was the picture of the solid and conscientious pastor, studying medicine in order to be able to relieve the Highgate poor of some of their earthly sufferings.<br>
<br>After turning seventy Lewis became markedly feebler, and suffered a mild stroke, which necessitated frequent visits to Bath, where he died after a short illness on 20 October 1731. He was buried at Highgate chapel. His wife and four children (three sons and a daughter) had all predeceased him and, after his only granddaughter (who in any case did not survive him long), he made Francis's son Osborne Atterbury his heir. The bishop, now in exile, received &pound;100, and there were small legacies to various charitable causes. The bulk of Atterbury's library went to Christ Church. During his lifetime he had published over twenty of his sermons (including a thanksgiving for the victory at Blenheim, in 1705, and another for the defeat of the Jacobite invasion attempt, in 1716), two devotional works translated from French, and items of anti-Catholic polemic, including a response (in 1709) to the Irish Catholic priest Cornelius Nary's <span class="italic">True and modest account of the chief points of controversy between the Roman Catholics and the protestants</span>, itself an attack on the writings of the late Archbishop John Tillotson. A selection of Atterbury's own manuscript sermons and papers was prepared for the press by Edward Yardley, archdeacon of Cardigan, and published in two volumes in 1743.<br>
