</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Leopold I</span>  (1790&#150;1865), <span class="occ">king of the Belgians</span>, was born on 16 December 1790 in Coburg, the eighth child and third son of Prince Francis Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (1750&#150;1806), heir to the German duchy of Coburg, and Augusta Caroline Sophia of Reuss-Ebersdorff (1757&#150;1831). His baptismal names were Leopold George Chr&eacute;tien Frederick. Charles Theodore Hoflender, head of ecclesiastical administration for Coburg and first professor at the Collegium Casimirianum, oversaw his education. He was confirmed in the Lutheran church on 12 September 1805, and left Coburg in the winter of 1805&#150;6, Napoleonic troops having overrun it.<br>
<br>Leopold then joined the Russian army; Tsar Alexander's brother Grand Duke Konstantin was his sister Anna's husband. The treaty of Tilsit (1807) returned the duchy of Coburg to Leopold's eldest brother, Ernest, and the two brothers travelled to Paris to meet Napoleon, who asked Leopold to act as his aide-de-camp. Leopold refused, returned instead to the Russian army, and fought at the battles of Lutzen, Bautzen, Kulm, and Leipzig. He was appointed to the military order of St George of Russia and accompanied the tsar on his triumphal march through Paris following Napoleon's defeat.<h2>
<a name="MarriagetoPrincessCharlotte"></a>Marriage to Princess Charlotte</h2>It was as part of the tsar's retinue that Leopold travelled to London in 1814, where he met <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5160/', "Princess Charlotte (1796&#150;1817)")</script>, daughter of the prince regent and heir presumptive to the British throne; their first encounter was accidental, on the back stairs of Pulteney's Hotel. At the time arrangements were being made for Charlotte's engagement to the prince of Orange, but she, known for her beauty and cultivated, independent spirit, alighted on Leopold&#151;who in contrast to Orange was tall, handsome, and soldierly&#151;as a more suitable husband. Tellingly in view of his later role in shaping modern European constitutional monarchy, she regarded his freedom from party ties in Britain an important recommendation. Leopold remained in London after the Russian delegation had departed, and moved from a flat above a grocer's shop on Marylebone High Street (reflecting the family's low income) to a residence of the Count Beroldingen in nearby Stratford Place. Their courtship letters were in French, though according to Lord Lauderdale, Leopold had &#145;a mania for England and English manners&#146;  (Sturt, 216). He was warmly received at the end-of-season ball at Carlton House, and the match was encouraged by, among others, the dukes of Kent and York, although with the regent (who, taking his cue from a favourite expression of Leopold's, nicknamed him le Marquis Peu &agrave; Peu) his relations were cool, and remained so  (Hibbert, 93).<br>
<br>Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to power saw Leopold return to the Russian army at the head of a cavalry division. After the French emperor's final defeat at Waterloo (Leopold's division arrived too late for the battle) Leopold undertook negotiations on behalf of his brother for the enlargement of the duchy of Coburg. Pleading these diplomatic commitments, he resisted entreaties to return to England from the prince regent and an increasingly frustrated Princess Charlotte. He finally crossed the channel in February 1816, and the couple were married on 2 May at Carlton House by the archbishop of Canterbury. The marriage settlement gave Leopold the rank of army general, English citizenship, and a generous annual stipend of &pound;50,000. Charlotte, whose original preference for Leopold had been pragmatic (she had told her confidante Mercer Elphinstone on 8 November 1814 that she was &#145;not in the least in the world in love with him&#146;), now hailed him as &#145;the perfection of a lover&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of the Princess Charlotte</span>, 180, 242). Once feisty, she now submitted to his dislike at seeing ladies in the saddle and ceased to ride; Leopold for his part grew a moustache to please her. They settled at Claremont House, Esher, Surrey, but enjoyed life together for barely eighteen months, as Charlotte died on 6 November 1817, following the traumatic birth of a stillborn son. Baron Stockmar, Leopold's private secretary, later recorded that his master &#145;never recovered the feeling of happiness which had blessed his short married life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Baron Stockmar</span>, ed. F. M. Muller, 1872, 1.67).<br>
<br>Leopold remained in England for the next fourteen years. He was accorded the title of royal prince and the military rank of field marshal, and lived on at Claremont on his vast pension, giving rise to murmurs of discontent in parliament: particular objection was felt to his profiting, as a state pensioner, from the produce of his Surrey estate. He angered George IV by paying a private visit to Queen Caroline at the height of the divorce proceedings against her in 1821. (During her exile in Italy Leopold made no contact, giving rise to accusations of crowd-pleasing opportunism.) Thereafter he left England for a time to visit his own mother, and to travel to Florence, Naples, and Vienna.<br>
<br>By this time Leopold had acquired another connection within the British royal family. After Charlotte's death the sons of George III had bestirred themselves to ensure the survival of the dynasty; Edward, duke of Kent, had married Leopold's sister Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and a daughter&#151;Alexandrina Victoria&#151;was born on 24 May 1819. After Kent's death in February 1820 Leopold granted his sister a pension of &pound;3000 (which he could certainly afford) and encouraged her to remain in England in spite of the attitude taken towards her by her royal brothers-in-law, which ranged from indifferent to hostile. He provided funds too for the education of his niece, who later recalled her visits to Claremont as the &#145;brightest epoch of my otherwise rather melancholy childhood&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, 1.14). A slight distancing factor was his sister's disapproval of his private life; he had installed his mistress, the German actress Kristina Bauer, in a house overlooking Regent's Park, and continued to have numerous affairs even after his second marriage.<h2>
<a name="FirstkingoftheBelgians"></a>First king of the Belgians</h2>Leopold had little to do in the United Kingdom; having been married to the heir presumptive to the throne he was effectively a king without a country. The first opportunity for him to rectify this omission came in February 1830, when he was put forward by France, Britain, and Russia for the throne of the newly established kingdom of Greece; finding that little popular support existed for him on the ground, he prudently declined the offer. His refusal was later recalled with gratitude by Victoria; Richard Barham, the pseudonymous Ingoldsby, took a less charitable&#151;and widely held&#151;view of his decision:<blockquote>
<div>Some say in hope to rule for his niece<br>
</div>
<div>He hath refused to be king over Greece.<br>
</div> (Weintraub, 64)</blockquote>In October 1830, however, the revolt of the former Habsburg territories in the Netherlands against Dutch rule, and the establishment of a provisional government in Brussels, provided Leopold with another opening. The London conference on the future of Belgium, as the new kingdom became known, was held in the following month and involved France, Britain, Prussia, Austria, and Russia. Apart from setting the boundaries of the new state the five powers' main concern was to select a suitable constitutional monarch. The initial favourite was the duke of Nemours, son of the French king, Louis Philippe, but the prospect of expanded French influence sparked objections, and Leopold emerged as a compromise candidate. His selection was confirmed by the vote of a Belgian national congress on 4 June, and&#151;with expressions of regret at leaving his adopted home of England&#151;he accepted the invitation. (He forwent some, but not all, of his pension and maintained establishments in England for which he had little use; this became the subject of press criticism, to which he reacted with uncomprehending irritation.) Dressed in the uniform of a lieutenant-general of the Belgian army, he was inaugurated as the first king of the Belgians on 21 July 1831.<br>
<br>Before Leopold had finished his inaugural tour of the country the Dutch had amassed 50,000 troops along the border. The Belgian army, ill-trained and half the size, was no match&#151;in spite of Leopold's own engagement with Dutch forces near Louvain&#151;but the invading army retreated at the threat of French intervention. The new state survived, albeit on terms less favourable than Leopold would have liked (he even threatened abdication). Belgian independence and neutrality was finally guaranteed by the treaty of London in 1839. In the meantime Leopold had strengthened his position with the country's Roman Catholic hierarchy by marrying on 9 August 1832 Louise Marie d'Orl&eacute;ans (1812&#150;1850), the eldest daughter of Louis Philippe, the king of the French, on 9 August 1832. According to Charlotte Bront&euml; the Brussels court to which he brought her was as gloomy as a conventicle. Their children were raised as Catholics; the eldest surviving son, Leopold Louis Philippe Marie Victor (1835&#150;1909), was married to the Habsburg archduchess Marie-Henriette&#151;an example of the dynastic empire-building for which the Coburgs won repute. Leopold also brokered the marriage between his nephew Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Kohary and Queen Maria of Portugal in 1836, and married another nephew and a niece into the house of Bourbon. His daughter Marie Charlotte (1840&#150;1927)&#151;known by her second name in honour of Leopold's first wife, reputedly at the suggestion of his second&#151;married another Habsburg, Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria. He later became emperor of Mexico&#151;with consequences fatal for himself and catastrophic for the mental health of his widow.<h2>
<a name="MentorandmatchmakertoQueenVictoria"></a>Mentor and matchmaker to Queen Victoria</h2>With his niece Victoria, Leopold maintained a steady correspondence from her childhood onwards. Their letters ranged from personal matters to court intrigue and national and international politics. They give an unparalleled insight into the mind of the young princess and her development of a sense of her destiny and constitutional role. Leopold's position in her life in the years leading up to 1837&#151;something between a father figure and an <i>&eacute;minence grise</i>&#151;was exemplified in a letter of 19 November 1834, in which Victoria thanked him for sending her an extract about Queen Anne &#145;to show what a Queen ought not to be&#146;, and requested &#145;that you will send me what a Queen ought to be&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Queen Victoria</span>, 1.50). In June 1837, with the health of William IV clearly rendering Victoria's succession imminent, Leopold advised her to keep the Melbourne ministry in office, that she would &#145;do wisely&#146; by showing herself &#145;attached to the English Protestant Church as it exists in the State&#146;  (ibid., 94), and&#151;above all&#151;to train those around her to offer their opinion only when she asked for it. When she ascended the throne he prudently declined her invitation to visit Britain for fear of giving the appearance of interference, but made the trip in September 1839 and on numerous occasions thereafter.<br>
<br>Leopold's most lasting contribution to the history of the British empire&#151;and his most triumphant piece of matchmaking&#151;was his energetic promotion of the union of Victoria and his nephew Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. This had been a pet project of his even before he arranged Albert's first visit to England, in May 1836, in the teeth of opposition from William IV. Victoria, however, would not be hurried into marriage; having found another confidante in Lord Melbourne she chafed at her uncle's overbearing influence and early became wise to his attempts to embroil her in Belgian affairs and his own international politicking. Leopold was shocked at the change in her tone towards him but bided his time and continued, through the agency of Stockmar, to groom Albert for the role of royal consort that he himself had been denied. His patience was rewarded and, though his relationship with Victoria inevitably altered, their correspondence continued unbroken until he died. In reply to his condolences on the death of Albert in 1861, she addressed him as &#145;Dearest, kindest, father&#146;  (Weintraub, 304). Afterwards, with his accustomed wiliness, he urged her to end her seclusion by invoking the popularity and high profile of the prince of Wales.<h2>
<a name="Constitutionalmonarch"></a>Constitutional monarch</h2>As king of the Belgians Leopold was active in promoting commerce and industry, and gave sanction in 1834 to the first railway on the European continent. He left domestic policy largely to his ministers; the lessons in constitutional monarchy absorbed during his time in England may have helped to ensure his survival of the revolutions of 1848 that toppled, among others, his father-in-law. He concerned himself more directly with foreign affairs; his diplomatic abilities were widely regarded and he was regularly called to act as an arbiter in international disputes.<br>
<br>Leopold made his last trip to England in April 1865 and, having been in declining health for a decade, returned to Belgium suffering from bronchitis. He died on 10 December 1865 at Laeken, Brussels. After lying in state at the Palais Royal dressed in the full uniform of a Belgian general, he was given a state funeral on 16 December. He was buried at Laeken, alongside his second wife, the wishes of his subjects having taken preference over his own desire to be buried at Windsor alongside Princess Charlotte. His eldest son succeeded him as Leopold II, whose rule in the Congo made his name a byword for colonial exploitation.<br>
