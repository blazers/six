<span class="headword">Legum,  Colin</span>  (1919&#150;2003), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born in the Mont aux Sources Hotel in Kestell, Orange Free State, South Africa, on 3 January 1919, the fourth of five children of Lithuanian Jewish immigrant parents. His father, Louis Legum, kept the hotel. He was educated at Retief High School in Kestell with the local Afrikaner children. He grew up in a house without books or newspapers, but was befriended by a neighbour who belonged to a mail-order book club and at school quickly became a voracious reader. As soon as he matriculated&#151;that year he was ranked seventh in South Africa&#151;he went off to Johannesburg. At fifteen he found a job as an office boy on the (Johannesburg) <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, and at nineteen was its political correspondent.<br>
<br>From early days Legum was a man of firm views and convictions, a socialist but strongly anti-communist, and a staunch Zionist and defender of Israel. He became deeply concerned about the plight of the black population of his country and quickly entered politics, being elected a member for the (white) Labour Party on Johannesburg city council in 1942. He served as general secretary of the Labour Party, edited its journal <span class="italic">Forward</span>, and became chairman of the special housing committee, which fiercely opposed those running the shanty towns. A year after Daniel Malan's Nationalist Party ousted Jan Smuts's United Party government in 1948 and launched apartheid Legum moved to London, at first joining a research team at the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations. This brought him into contact with David Astor, editor of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>. It was said that one day he turned up unannounced at the office to see Astor, did not apply for a job, but simply said he would be covering Africa for the paper. It was the unorthodox beginning of a legendary Fleet Street career&#151;thirty years as the newspaper's diplomatic and Commonwealth correspondent. Although the Commonwealth beat was much wider than Africa, the spotlight fell increasingly on that continent. Kwame Nkrumah took Ghana to independence in 1957 and thereafter the pace of decolonization quickened almost by the month. The Commonwealth became embroiled in the events that flowed from Ian Smith's unilateral declaration of independence in 1965, the subsequent war in Rhodesia, and then the long struggle in South Africa to end apartheid.<br>
<br>Legum had married Eugenie Maud Leon in South Africa in 1941, and they had one son, David. She died in 1953 and on 27 July 1960 he married, in London, the South African economist <a href="#cosubject_99234">Margaret Jean Roberts [<i>see below</i>]</a>. They had three daughters. In 1964 Legum and his second wife published <span class="italic">South Africa: Crisis for the West</span>, an influential book arguing for sanctions to bring down apartheid.<br>
<br>In these years of fundamental changes in Africa that were now being extensively covered in the British press, Legum was one of the most distinguished of a generation of journalists, some of whom became personally committed to the emergence of a new Africa. Among these were Basil Davidson, Anthony Sampson, Clyde Sanger, Bill Kirkman, Tom Stacey, Cyril Dunn, Michael Holman, Brigid Bloom, Patrick Keatley, Roy Lewis, and John Dickie. Legum became close to many African leaders such as Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta, Julius Nyerere, Kenneth Kaunda, Milton Obote, and Oliver Tambo. David Astor, influenced by Legum and the campaigner Michael Scott, took an increasingly close interest in events in Africa and <span class="italic">The Observer</span> acquired a growing reputation for its coverage. Scott was director of the Africa Bureau and Legum was a key voice on its committee.<br>
<br>Deceptively, Legum never gave the outward appearance of huge energy, whether at his typewriter with a cigar between his lips, calmly chatting to African presidents or prime ministers, or waiting invariably until the end of a press conference to come in with the most pertinent of all the questions. He was always helpful to young journalists, although his style was serious and sometimes brusque. In committee he usually got his way, displaying a great command of facts and detail, though with little sense of humour and usually pronouncing on African affairs as if he was the ultimate authority.<br>
<br>Legum's literary output was prodigious. He was involved as author, co-author, or contributor of twenty books&#151;most notably <span class="italic">Congo Disaster</span> (1960), <span class="italic">Pan-Africanism: a Brief History</span> (1962), <span class="italic">Africa: a Handbook of the Continent</span> (1962), <span class="italic">Western Crisis over Southern Africa</span> (1979), and <span class="italic">Mwalimu: the Influence of Nyerere</span> (1995). His last book, <span class="italic">Africa since Independence</span> (1999), was based on lectures delivered at Indiana University, in which he looked back at what he categorized as Africa's &#145;romantic period&#146; (1939&#150;70), its &#145;period of disillusionment&#146; (1970&#150;85), its &#145;period of realism&#146; (which he dated enigmatically 1988&#150;?), and then forward to a possible &#145;period of renaissance&#146;. However, his most remarkable achievement was to found in 1968 and edit twenty-three volumes of the <span class="italic">Africa Contemporary Record</span>, persuading many leading Africanists to write for it&#151;altogether a huge task. He also edited the <span class="italic">Middle East Survey</span> and from 1982 <span class="italic">Third World Report</span>. In 1981, by then associate editor, he had left <span class="italic">The Observer</span> when the paper was taken over by the controversial head of Lonrho, Roland (Tiny) Rowland&#151;a change that he felt would undermine the paper's integrity.<br>
<br>Legum and his wife had been banned from South Africa in 1962, but with the ending of apartheid in 1990 were able to return. In 1996 they settled there, at Kalk Bay, near Cape Town. Legum was delighted to be given honorary degrees by Rhodes University and the University of South Africa. In 2002 he founded a development trust to provide scholarships at Retief School. He continued to work as a journalist, author, and visiting lecturer until his death from cancer in Cape Town on 8 June 2003.<br>
<br>Legum's wife, <a name="cosubject_99234"></a><span class="headword">Margaret Jean Legum</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Roberts]</span>  (1933&#150;2007), <span class="occ">economist, journalist, and political activist</span>, was born on 8 October 1933 in Pretoria, South Africa, the daughter of Andrew Henry Roberts, civil engineer, and his wife, Margaret (Peggy), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mackenzie. Her father was the founder of one of South Africa's largest construction companies, but a greater influence was her mother, a member of Black Sash (the white women's group set up to campaign against apartheid). She was educated at Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa, and Newnham College, Cambridge. She then spent a couple of years lecturing in economics at Rhodes University before returning to England as a research assistant at the London School of Economics. After her marriage she worked briefly for the Fabian Society before becoming a full-time housewife and mother. She returned to work in 1984 for Voluntary Service Overseas, organizing health and social development programmes abroad, mainly in Africa. She was a long-standing member of the Iona Community, and sought to bring a Christian perspective to bear on political and economic questions. After her and her husband's return to South Africa she was a notable supporter of the African National Congress (ANC), but not an uncritical one. She was a founder of the South African New Economics Network, and her most notable book, <span class="italic">It Doesn't Have to Be Like This</span> (2002), based on a series of lectures at the University of Cape Town, argued for the introduction of a basic income grant (a policy rejected by the ruling ANC). In 2007 she published a well-received book of poems, <span class="italic">Learning to Saunter</span>. She died in Cape Town on 1 November 2007, after surgery for cancer. She was survived by her three daughters, her son David having died in Israel in 1994.<br>
