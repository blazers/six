<span class="headword">Cumin <span class="st"> [Comin]</span>,  Robert</span> <span class="st"> [Robert  de Cuminis]</span>, earl of Northumbria  (<em>d.</em> 1069), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was, according to Orderic Vitalis, granted the <i>comitatus</i> (&#145;county&#146;) of Durham by William I, in the third year of his reign. However, the <span class="italic">Historia regum Anglorum</span> (attributed, with little certainty, to Symeon of Durham) says that Earl Robert was appointed to govern the area to the north of the Tyne, and this has been seen as one of a number of measures adopted by William in his attempt to bring the area under his control. Orderic may have specified Durham as the seat of Cumin's power as this was where the earl met his death, but it is unlikely that he was using the word <i>comitatus</i> in the later sense of earldom. A later source, Gaimar, identifies Earl Robert as the leader of a band of Flemings which suggests that his cognomen, de Cuminis, used by Orderic, may refer to Comines near Lille in Flanders. The earl's relationship to William Cumin, chancellor of David I of Scotland, unsuccessful usurper of the bishopric of Durham in 1141&#150;4, and progenitor of the Scots clan Comyn, is uncertain. Robert Cumin succeeded to the earldom abandoned by Gospatric of Bamburgh. As he is described as being one of those men who paid the wages of their followers by allowing them to pillage and murder, it seems that he was at the head of a company of mercenary soldiers.<br>
<br>Earl Robert came to Durham late in December 1068 with a body of knights (their number varies from 500 to 900 in the sources), but all except two of them were slaughtered on 28 or 31 January 1069. According to Symeon of Durham's tract on the church of Durham (<span class="italic">Libellus de exordio</span>), the Northumbrians had heard of Cumin's imminent arrival and prepared themselves for flight, but a violent snowstorm prevented their escape. As a result they decided to murder Earl Robert or die in the attempt. As he made his way north, Cumin was met by &AElig;thelwine, bishop of Durham (1056&#150;71), who warned him of the plot against him. Refusing to heed the warning, the earl encamped in the city of Durham where his men committed acts of violence against the men of St Cuthbert. During the night the Northumbrians, who were those living to the north of the Tyne rather than the citizens of Durham, marched south and burst through the city gates slaughtering any Normans they came across. They attacked the earl, who was lodged in the bishop's house, but were beaten off. The Northumbrians therefore decided to set fire to the episcopal residence and when Earl Robert fled the flames he was killed. Sparks from the burning building threatened to ignite the west tower of the cathedral but prayers by the clergy and townsfolk to St Cuthbert proved efficacious and a contrary wind drove back the fire. On hearing of the massacre William I dispatched an army to the north of England but on reaching Allerton in Yorkshire it was engulfed in a black mist. Learning that the local people had a saint who would allow none to persecute them, the punitive expedition turned back. William of Jumi&egrave;ges describes a general conspiracy against William centred on a stronghold called Durham erected in Cumberland (<i>sic</i>), but his account of the rising in the north of England is confused and he does not record Cumin's death. Robert Cumin seems to have been succeeded by the native Northumbrian Gospatric who was reinstated in his earldom. Earl Robert's ill-fated attempt to subdue the Northumbrians living to the north of the Tyne illustrates the tenuous hold which William I had on the region for most of his reign.<br>
