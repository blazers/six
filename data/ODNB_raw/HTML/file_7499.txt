<span class="headword">Denne,  Samuel</span>  (1730&#150;1799), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born at the deanery, Westminster, on 13 January 1730, the second of the two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7498/', "John Denne (1693&#150;1767)")</script>, archdeacon of Rochester and antiquary, and Susannah Bradford (1703&#150;1780). He was educated at Streatham and at the King's School, Canterbury, and was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1748; he graduated BA in 1753 and MA in 1756. In 1754 he was presented to the vicarage of Lamberhurst in Kent, but he resigned the living in 1767 when he became vicar of the parishes of Wilmington and Darenth, both near Dartford. In 1783 he became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.<br>
<br>Denne was described in his obituary as a &#145;loyal son&#146;, and demonstrated this loyalty in maintaining his father's interest in antiquarianism. His first publication on the subject in 1772 was a history of Rochester and its environs, which was published by the local bookseller Thomas Fisher, but to which Denne contributed most of the content. He also assisted Fisher in his revision of the <span class="italic">Kentish Traveller's Companion</span>. Denne senior had at one time been vicar of St Leonard, Shoreditch, and Samuel continued the family interest in the parish of Shoreditch, providing Henry Ellis with considerable assistance in his parochial history. He also maintained the family connection with Lambeth, of which his father had been rector, with his <span class="italic">Historical Particulars of Lambeth Parish and Lambeth Palace</span>, published in 1795. In addition he made significant contributions to other publications, notably John Thorpe's <span class="italic">Custumale Roffense</span>, Richard Gough's <span class="italic">Sepulchral Monuments</span>, the <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica</span>, and the <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Manners and Expences of Antient Times in England</span> (1797). He corresponded regularly with the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> using the signature W &amp; D (Wilmington and Darenth) and was a prolific contributor of papers to the Society of Antiquaries, many of which were published in <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>, notably on the introduction of arabic numerals, on water marks, and on stone fonts in England. Like many other antiquaries of his time he entertained a keen interest in Anglo-Saxon antiquities and literature, but was handicapped by having no real command of the language. Denne was somewhat pedantic and not an original thinker but his interests were diverse and wide-ranging.<br>
<br>Denne appears as a somewhat lonely figure (he never married) and clearly drew immense pleasure from his antiquarian researches and the contacts it brought him with like-minded people. Settled in rural Kent, he felt isolated and often complained of the lack of antiquarian interest in the local town of Dartford. His correspondence with other antiquaries and in particular with his fellow &#145;Benedictine&#146;, Richard Gough, was something of an intellectual lifeline. His circle also included the other Kentish antiquaries William Boys, John Thorpe, and John Latham, but he rather disapproved of the county's historian Edward Hasted whose private life and publications, in Denne's view, both left something to be desired. He was close to his family, particularly his brother and sister. The former, chaplain of the gaol at Maidstone, suffered periods of mental instability from 1777, which Denne blamed on his having to cope with the insurrection at Maidstone gaol, when the prisoners attempted to blow it up. He was very supportive of both him and his sister-in-law, and when she died in 1798 he estimated that he had written over a thousand letters to his brother to amuse him. His brother's experiences as chaplain may account for Denne's own interest in prison reform, which formed the subject of a letter to Sir Robert Ladbroke published in 1771. To his sister, Susannah, who had lived with him, he left his entire estate when he died. In politics he professed great admiration for Walpole, bitterly regretted the loss of the American colonies, and was fiercely critical of the prosecution of the war against France during the 1790s. He appears to have performed his duties as vicar conscientiously and his obituary described him as devoted to the poor and needy of his parish.<br>
<br>Denne died on 3 August 1799, at Wilmington, in his library, having suffered from a bilious complaint for over forty years, and was buried near his father in the south transept of Rochester Cathedral on 10 August.<br>
