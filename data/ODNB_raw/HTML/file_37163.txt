<span class="headword">Bothumley,  Jacob</span>  (1613&#150;1692), <span class="occ">Ranter</span>, was born in 1613 in Leicester, the son of William Bauthumley (1586&#150;1635), a shoemaker, and was baptized on 23 May. He was apprenticed to his father in 1627. Both father and son were members of a semi-separatist group in All Saints parish in the city, and both attracted the attention of the ecclesiastical authorities for repeating sermons in William's house. William had been excommunicated in 1619 and Jacob was excommunicated on 28 June 1634, although he had already refused to kneel at communion in 1627 and 1633. Their identities have been confused: William was probably &#145;Bottomley the shoemaker&#146; who prayed aloud in the company of the nonconformist ministers Francis Higginson and Jeremiah Burroughs in the later 1620s. Both Bothumleys then were closely involved in the emergence of nonconformity in Leicester, a process which was hastened by the action of the forces attempting to achieve its eradication. The consequence of excommunication for Jacob was economic isolation: he was forced to give up his trade and was given redress for this when he petitioned the Long Parliament in 1640.<br>
<br>Bothumley fought for parliament and rose to be quartermaster in Colonel Cox's regiment. He seems to have had no direct connection with the other publishing Ranters (although Joseph Salmon refers to him), but on 14 March 1650 Bothumley was bored through the tongue with a hot iron for blasphemy, had his sword broken over his head, and was cashiered from the army. He was punished for publishing <span class="italic">The Light and Dark Sides of God</span> (1650), copies of which were ordered to be burnt, although George Thomason was still able to acquire a copy in November of the same year. By this time Bothumley had probably returned to Leicester, where the tract had already been sent to London as &#145;very dangerous &hellip; a very wide door to atheism and profaneness&#146;.<br>
<br>Bothumley's earlier habit of repeating in private sermons already delivered helps to explain his acquisition of a literacy exceptional for a shoemaker: <span class="italic">The Light and Dark Sides of God</span> has been regarded as &#145;a neglected masterpiece of seventeenth-century devotional prose&#146;. It is a work of deep inwardness, where the presence of God in all creatures makes external worship and scriptural authority superfluous: &#145;God is in all Creatures, Man and Beast, Fish and Fowle, and every green thing, from the highest Cedar to the Ivey on the wall; and that God is the life and being of them all&#146;  (Smith, <span class="italic">Collection</span>, 232). In no place does Bothumley recommend the practical antinomianism of which the other Ranters were accused. The devil and sin exist for him as states of mind in which the true location of the godhead is not recognized, even though such unenlightened awareness still functions as a praise of God. Sinful acts are not Bothumley's concern as such, but it is not difficult to see why <span class="italic">The Light and Dark Sides of God</span> was regarded as a dangerous work when it appeared to undermine Christian certainties: &#145;I have made God mutable as my self&#146;  (ibid., 233).<br>
<br>When the leading Quaker George Fox met Bothumley at Swannington in January 1655, he referred to him unfavourably as a Ranter, although <span class="italic">The Light and Dark Sides of God</span> circulated among Quakers. Later on, Bothumley became a minor corporation official at Leicester, in 1658 as serjeant-at-mace, and in 1667 as library keeper. Despite these offices, he was presented for not receiving the holy communion at his parish church, All Saints, Leicester, on 11 September 1667, together with two women. In 1676 he published an abridgement of Foxe's book of martyrs, entitled <span class="italic">A Brief Historical Relation</span>; it was reissued in 1686. Between 1676 and 1685 Bothumley was keeper of the house of correction, administering relief to the poor in Leicester on behalf of the corporation. He was buried on 30 July 1692.<br>
