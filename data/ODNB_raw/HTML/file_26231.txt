<span class="headword">Standish,  Henry</span>  (<em>c.</em>1475&#150;1535), <span class="occ">bishop of St Asaph</span>, was born at Standish, Lancashire, possibly (according to Dugdale) the son of Alexander Standish. He was educated at the Franciscan school in Hereford, at Oxford, where he had proceeded DTh by 1502, and perhaps at Cambridge. A Franciscan friar, he became warden of Greyfriars, London, about 1508, and later Franciscan provincial, before his consecration as bishop of St Asaph. He was also rector of Standish, Lancashire (<i>in commendam</i> with his episcopal appointment). He preached before the king in February 1511 and thereafter became a court favourite, asked back in the spring of every year from 1515 to 1520 (receiving 20<i>s</i>. each time). His sermons, much to Henry's liking, brought him an important place among the king's spiritual advisers. It was thought by Wood that Standish had collected his sermons together as <span class="italic">Sermons Preached to the People</span>, but firm evidence is lacking.<br>
<br>Perhaps because of his court position, Standish became involved in the disputes over benefit of clergy of the years following 1510. In this clash between church and state, Standish opposed his fellow clergymen. At a conference held at Blackfriars in February 1515 he argued that clergymen were subject to temporal authorities, and raised clerical ire further by giving a series of lectures on the issue, following which he was summoned to convocation on heresy charges. At a second Blackfriars conference, held later that year, he was vindicated by the king's legal experts, although Bishop Fox clearly had reservations, remarking to the king, &#145;Sir, I warrant you Dr. Standish will not abide by his opinion at his peril&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 2/1, no. 1313). Some time later, ignoring Wolsey's claims for William Bolton, Henry nominated Standish to the see of St Asaph (provided by papal bull dated 28 May 1518), less, perhaps, as a reward than as a sign of royal displeasure to other bishops. He was consecrated by Warham at Otford, Kent, on 11 July 1518, for which he later became subject to a <i>praemunire</i> charge, for having been consecrated before he had received royal assent and done homage for his temporalities.<br>
<br>Little is known of Standish's administration of his diocese, which was probably left largely to his chancellor and vicar-general, Robert ap Rhys. In 1520 he gave a canonry to his nephew Richard Standish, and the fact that he later made bequests to the Carmelites of Denbigh and to his own cathedral suggests that he was not entirely uninvolved in diocesan affairs. In 1521 he re-emerged from obscurity, when he publicly attacked Erasmus's scholarship in a sermon at St Paul's Cross. His subject was ostensibly Christian charity, but soon turned into an attack on Erasmus's Greek <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. John Stokesley (later bishop of London) and Thomas More took Standish to task over his opinions. Shortly thereafter, hoping to check the distribution of Erasmus's work, Standish took his warnings against Erasmus to the king, fearing &#145;a time of by far the greatest peril was at hand&#146; because of them  (<span class="italic">Collected Works Erasmus</span>, 8.10). In subsequent debate he was overmatched by Stokesley and More, and the king, &#145;sorry to see such colossal stupidity pilloried in such exalted company&#146;, ended it. Erasmus labelled Standish an &#145;egregious numskull&#146;  (ibid., 6.13&#150;14). Standish probably wrote out his arguments in a treatise directed against Erasmus's translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, but whether this was ever actually published (as Wood suggests) is questionable.<br>
<br>Standish thereafter played only a small role in official matters. In May 1522 he received Charles V at Canterbury, and in February 1524 accompanied Sir John Baker (later attorney-general) on an embassy to Hamburg. Early in 1526 he was a member of Wolsey's heresy commission which received the recantation of and imposed a public penance upon Robert Barnes and five Hanse merchants. And he was subsequently among the judges at the trials for heresy&#151;all in London&#151;of Richard Foster, Thomas Bilney, and Thomas Arthur (November 1527), and John Tewkesbury (December 1531). Standish supported Katherine of Aragon when Henry VIII began proceedings for a divorce, speaking on her behalf on 29 June 1529, although she later doubted his sincerity. According to Campeggi, Standish had submitted a book on Katherine's behalf (it was not read out in court). In the Lords, Standish objected to a discussion of the divorce prior to a papal decision but, in upper convocation, agreed that the pope's original dispensation allowing Henry to marry Katherine was faulty. On 11 July 1530 a <i>praemunire</i> information was filed in king's bench against him (and thirteen other clerics) because he had supported Wolsey's legatine authority through a composition with the cardinal for an annual payment of 10 marks.<br>
<br>On 15 May 1532 Standish subscribed to the king's supreme headship of the English church, and in the summer presided briefly in southern convocation. He was one of the three bishops who on 13 March 1533 consecrated Thomas Cranmer as archbishop of Canterbury. Standish's support for the king's policies was held in doubt by Thomas Cromwell, who used the first available occasion to test him. In October 1533 Robert ap Rhys, Standish's vicar-general at St Asaph, was indicted for <i>praemunire</i> in the great leet of Denbigh, and Standish, as his superior, was included in the charge. Both men fought the charges, and swore out writs of <i>supersedeas</i> in chancery. John Salisbury, the steward of the court at Denbigh, failed to process the writs even after <i>subpoenas</i> were sworn out against him. The results of this are unclear, but Standish was finally pressured into a formal renunciation of papal jurisdiction on 1 June 1535. He died a little over a month later, on 9 July, probably of old age.<br>
<br>In his will, made on 3 July and proved on 31 August, Standish directed that he should be buried &#145;among the friars minor&#146;, perhaps a reference to the London Greyfriars, though no monument to him there is recorded by Stow. He left &pound;40 for his burial, and &pound;13 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. for his tomb. His other bequests included &pound;40 apiece for paving the choir of St Asaph Cathedral, for building an aisle of the Franciscan church in Oxford, for exhibitions for Oxford scholars, and for the Lancashire parish of Standish. He also left &pound;5 to buy books for the Oxford Franciscans, and appointed executors to dispose of his library. However, his legal capacity to make a will, as a religious who had become a bishop, was open to question, and Standish's will seems to have brought trouble to his legatees.<br>
