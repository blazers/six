<span class="headword">Blagrave,  Daniel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1603, <em>d.</em> 1668?), <span class="occ">politician and regicide</span>, was baptized on 20 November 1603 at St Mary's, Reading, the fifth son of Alexander Blagrave (<i>d</i>. 1612), a clothier of Southcote Lodge, Berkshire, and his wife, Margaret. A nephew of the mathematician John Blagrave, Daniel entered the Inner Temple in 1637 and was called to the bar in 1648. Before then he emerged as a prominent parliamentarian in Berkshire, as treasurer of the county committee. His greatest influence was in Reading, where he was made an &#145;assistant&#146; of the corporation (1644), and became &#145;steward&#146; or recorder (1645). Thereafter he began to make an impression outside the county. He was made an exigenter in the court of common pleas and a master in chancery, and secured election as a recruiter MP for the borough of Reading in June 1648, although only after the resolution of an election dispute. Blagrave was vilified almost immediately in the royalist press, who accused him of securing his seat through bribery, and he would remain a controversial figure for many years. He married, in 1632, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1612, <i>d</i>. in or after 1672), daughter of Abraham Hull, a London merchant, with whom he had at least two sons.<br>
<br>A friend to the Independents, if not to the army, Blagrave emerged as a prominent MP during the Rump Parliament. He was involved in preparing for the trial of Charles I, during which he was a zealous commissioner who proved willing to sign the death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. He participated in the abolition of the House of Lords, and in introducing the controversial engagement, and secured appointments to many leading committees, not least in relation to the sequestration of delinquents and the sale of confiscated estates and church lands. He became a commissioner for forfeited estates in July 1651. His ambition for preferment and pecuniary office is evident in his frequent letters to Elias Ashmole seeking astrological advice, and his parliamentary activity was closely related to matters wherein he sought promotion. In 1650 the commissioners for compounding expressed fear that his attempt to become steward of forfeited estates in Berkshire conflicted with his positions as an MP and sequestrator, and by the spring of 1653 he faced accusations of having used bribes to secure offices, a practice recommended to him by Ashmole. Such accusations prompted an official investigation which threatened Blagrave's public career in the Commons.<br>
<br>Blagrave survived this investigation, but the absence of parliamentary privilege after the dissolution of the Rump left him open to other prosecutors, notably the corporation of Reading. This dispute, together with growing hostility resulting from his clashes with local presbyterians, probably prevented him from securing a seat in the 1654 parliament. He was also accused of failing to assist in the prosecution of the local astrologer and mystic John Pordage. Blagrave, having examined Pordage, provided written testimony in his defence in 1654, prompting accusations that he, like his wife, was one of Pordage's acolytes. The presbyterians in Reading removed Blagrave from civic office in March 1656, sparking a lengthy battle to reclaim his post, and a bitter factional struggle within the town. Blagrave's party secured his return in another contested parliamentary election in 1656, against the wishes of the ruling &eacute;lite, and he was returned again in 1659 after another double return, and was restored to his post as recorder.<br>
<br>Active in the restored Rump in 1659, Blagrave favoured civilian rather than military rule but probably withdrew from the Commons upon the readmission of the secluded members in February 1660. He gave way to his son in the Convention Parliament, but was confirmed as the town's recorder until he fled at the Restoration, to avoid prosecution as a regicide. The town promised to hold the post open for him until his return, but Blagrave remained on the continent until his death. He probably died at Aachen in 1668, and was certainly dead by 1672 when Bulstrode Whitelocke received a bequest through Blagrave's widow.<br>
