</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cunard,  Nancy Clara</span>  (1896&#150;1965), <span class="occ">poet and political activist</span>, was born at Nevill Holt in Leicestershire on 10 March 1896, the only child of Sir Bache Cunard, third baronet (1851&#150;1925), grandson of the founder of the Cunard steamship line, and the American heiress Maud Alice (later known as Emerald) Burke (1872&#150;1948) of San Francisco, whose Irish-American father, James Burke, claimed descent from the Irish patriot Robert Emmet. Lady Cunard left her husband when Nancy was in her teens, and went on to preside over the brightest political and artistic salon in London. The prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, was a regular guest, and she afforded notable social promotion to Wallis Simpson; her pre-eminence as a social hostess was therefore dealt a serious blow by the abdication crisis. A legend persists that the Irish writer George Moore (1852&#150;1933), Lady Cunard's faithful friend from before her marriage, was actually Nancy's father (see A. Frazier, <span class="italic">George Moore</span>, 2000). There is much to be said against this notion, though he always encouraged Nancy's writing and she later wrote a memoir of him.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Educated at home in languages, literature, and history; at Miss Woolf's school in London; in Munich for music and German in 1912, and in Paris at a school run by the Misses Ozanne, Nancy also travelled extensively, sharing her mother's passion for art museums and galleries, and for opera and concerts in London and abroad. Her early diaries show a remarkable range of reading, a ready command of languages, and a deep familiarity with the history of European art, music, literature, and dance. She later trained herself as an expert on the arts of Africa. Among her unpublished papers are a monograph on African ivories, notes for a book of images of Africans in European art, and extensive notes on the history of slavery.<br>
<br>A glamorous and wild society girl among the artists at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in London and a member of a group who called themselves the Corrupt Coterie, the aspiring poet rented a studio to write in with her friend the poet, journalist, and actress Iris Tree. On 15 November 1916 Cunard married an Australian, Sydney George Fairbairn (1892&#150;1943), son of Stephen Fairbairn, the celebrated Australian oarsman. Her husband, a noted cricketer, had enlisted in the Royal Buckinghamshire hussars, and had been wounded at Gallipoli. He subsequently joined the Grenadier Guards and was awarded the MC. After the war he undertook expeditions in east Africa and they lived separately, divorcing in 1925.<br>
<br>In 1916 Cunard organized with Edith Sitwell the first of a series of fresh and innovative anthologies which appeared annually until 1921, called <span class="italic">Wheels</span> after Cunard's signature poem, in which war poems by Wilfred Owen appeared next to avant-garde verse by Aldous Huxley and the Sitwell brothers. Cunard's first volume of poetry was <span class="italic">Outlaws</span> (1921), followed by <span class="italic">Sublunary</span> (1923), and <span class="italic">Poems (Two), 1925</span> (1930). Her most important early poem, <span class="italic">Parallax</span>, was published by Leonard and Virginia Woolf at the Hogarth Press in 1925. Reviews claimed that it plagiarized T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">The Waste Land</span>, which was published by Hogarth in the same series and written as a parallax or slanted view of the London of Eliot's poem. It is now known that one anonymous critic was the left-wing poet Edgell Rickword; it was he, ironically, who later arranged for the publication of Cunard's later works, <span class="italic">Negro</span> and <span class="italic">Authors Take Sides</span>. Driven from England by this hostile barrage, she began an expatriate life in Paris and a long career as an activist intellectual by joining the surrealists. In the company of, among others, Dali, Breton, and especially the surrealist communist Louis Aragon, with whom she had two passionate affairs, she sharpened her political beliefs, rejected her class background, and embraced American jazz and the music and culture of Africa. A few brilliant columns for <span class="italic">Vogue</span> in the mid-1920s show what she might have done in society and arts journalism had she followed the path of her close friend Janet Flanner, who wrote a Paris letter for the <span class="italic">New Yorker</span>.<br>
<br>In Paris, Cunard kept a flat on the rue le Regrattier on &Icirc;le St Louis, and set up the Hours Press (1928&#150;31), whose history she later documented in <span class="italic">These were the Hours</span> (1969). Based initially at a shop on the rue Guenegaud, from where she also sold African art objects, and later at Le Puits Carr&eacute;, her home in La Chapelle-R&eacute;anville, Normandy, the press published works by, among others, Robert Graves, Laura Riding, George Augustus Moore, Ezra Pound (<span class="italic">XXX Cantos</span>), and Louis Aragon (his French translation of Lewis Carroll's <span class="italic">The Hunting of the Snark</span>). She also discovered Samuel Beckett and published his <span class="italic">Whoroscope</span> (1930). The rare volume <span class="italic">Henry-Music</span> is a collection of jazz piano tunes by her lover, the African-American musician Henry Crowder, settings for poems by Cunard, Beckett, Walter Lowenfels, and other modernist poets, the best of them a blues song by Nancy herself.<h2>
<a name="Icon"></a>Icon</h2>Nancy Cunard's extraordinary good looks and her reputation for excess in love affairs, dancing to jazz, drinking, and drugs made her the icon of the new woman, the boyish vamp of the twenties. She was famously photographed by Man Ray, wearing African ivory bracelets (1920), and by Curtis Moffat for <span class="italic">Vogue</span>, wearing a feathered headdress and looking savage, with her then lover, Louis Aragon. Her image was also captured in photos and paintings by Cecil Beaton, to whom she resembled &#145;a robot woman in a German film&#146;  (Williams, 131), Wyndham Lewis, Barbara Ker-Seymer, and others, as well as in Constantin Brancusi's elegant abstract sculptures.<br>
<br>Michael Arlen's (1895&#150;1956) roman &agrave; clef <span class="italic">The green hat</span> (1924) and others among his popular novels established Nancy Cunard's reputation as the archetype of the sexually free &#145;woman of honour&#146;. Staged in London with Talullah Bankhead and in New York with Katherine Cornell playing the Nancy Cunard figure, the play followed the sensational text of the novel, but the silent film with Greta Garbo, <span class="italic">A Woman of Affairs</span> (1928), was censored beyond recognition. Cunard was generally recognized as Myra Viveash in Aldous Huxley's <span class="italic">Antic Hay</span>, Lucy Tantamount in his <span class="italic">Point Counter Point</span>, and as the subject of other unsavoury literary portraits by Wyndham Lewis and Richard Aldington. The most disturbing contemporary portrait of Nancy Cunard is the Fresca section of T. S. Eliot's <span class="italic">The Waste Land</span>, with her mother parodied as Lady Kleinwurm, and wisely edited out of Ezra Pound's final draft of the poem (<span class="italic">Facsimile Drafts of The Waste Land</span>, ed. V. Eliot, 1971; L. Gordon, <span class="italic">Eliot's Early Years</span>, 1977; Chisholm, appx 1).<h2>
<a name="Politicalactivist"></a>Political activist</h2>In 1931 Cunard brought to London and privately screened a print of the Bunuel-Dali film <span class="italic">L'&acirc;ge d'or</span> after it had been attacked by right-wing, Catholic, and antisemitic groups in Paris. She was helped in this venture by Sir Thomas Beecham, her mother's lover. Lady Cunard&#151;in spite of Beecham's defence of Nancy&#151;had disinherited her daughter because of the &#145;blasphemous and immoral film&#146; and her public appearances in London society with Henry Crowder. As the mother&#150;daughter battle escalated Nancy wrote an attack called <span class="italic">Black Man and White Ladyship</span>, published it in W. E. B. DuBois's Afro-American journal <span class="italic">The Crisis</span> in September 1931, and sent it as a privately printed pamphlet at Christmas to Lady Cunard's friends&#151;effectively a printed version of the slap in the mother's face featured in <span class="italic">L'&acirc;ge d'or</span>. &#145;How come, white man, the rest of the world is to be re-formed in your dreary and decadent image?&#146; the pamphlet asks. This personalizing of the politics of imperialism forever marked her as an outcast in England, and staked out her place on the world's stage as a public intellectual. She had broken all the taboos of loyalty to country, class, and family. Hate mail hounded her efforts on behalf of blacks at the time and untoward comments about her sexuality have since compromised her reputation as a radical activist for black arts and liberation.<h2>
<a name="Negro"></a>Negro</h2>Having thus broken with her past, Cunard set to work on an enormous encyclopaedia of black history, culture, and politics, at first entitled <span class="italic">Colour</span>, and later <span class="italic">Negro</span> (first published in London by Wishart in 1934, after rejections from Cape and Gollancz, among others). Inspired by Crowder, she researched for the work in ethnographic museums with African collections in Europe, most notably the Mus&eacute;e du Congo at Tervueren, outside Brussels, where her assistants Raymond Michelet and Raoul Ubac respectively drew and photographed hundreds of objects. Work on <span class="italic">Negro</span> took her to the US twice, and to the West Indies; her efforts to get to Africa were frustrated by her not being allowed to travel with a black man (later, she was able to go to north Africa to report on the condition of the Moors during the Spanish Civil War). She enlisted the contributions of many black intellectuals and leaders, among them Langston Hughes (1902&#150;1967), the activist poet, who became a lifelong friend, the novelist Claude Mackay, and the activists George Padmore (1901&#150;1959) and Marcus Garvey. Among other contributors were Africanists and anthropologists, including an early article by Melville Herskovits (1895&#150;1963); the Belgian Robert Goffin wrote a brilliant piece on jazz; nineteen essays were translated from the French by Samuel Beckett, while Rene Crevel's &#145;The negress in the brothel&#146; was censored in Britain (Cunard boasted of having surreptitiously re-inserted the offending pages at the bindery). They were joined by Ezra Pound on Frobenius, a manifesto by the surrealist group, studies of African culture in Central and South America, and sections on artists, entertainers (including Josephine Baker), boxers, and Harlem. A piece by Kenneth MacPherson called for a negro film union, and she published several major essays in folklore by Zora Neale Hurston. Musical scores and political manifestos from many different groups were represented, with special emphasis given to black candidates for office in the American Communist Party.<br>
<br>As editor of <span class="italic">Negro</span>, Cunard reprimanded W. E. B. DuBois, another of her contributors, for the timidity of his organization, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). At issue was the cause of the Scottsboro Boys, the nine young black men, almost lynched, and then sentenced to the death penalty in Alabama for the supposed rape of two young women on a freight train. Cunard and others contributed essays on the Scottsboro Boys to <span class="italic">Negro</span>. She organized many demonstrations in London and Liverpool and raised money on their behalf. Cunard's pro-black activities were under surveillance by British authorities and the FBI; she was later detained at Ellis Island. But as the communists had ceased to regard the black struggle as the vanguard of the revolution by the time <span class="italic">Negro</span> appeared in 1934, and as the book was too radical for a mainstream audience, it has never found the wide audience it deserves. Banned in British colonies in Africa and the West Indies, it provoked a furious review in the <span class="italic">Nation</span> by Jamaica's former governor, Lord Olivier. African and West Indian activists who sought Cunard out in London and Paris told her often of the experience of having read her book while it was banned. Hugh Ford's abridged version of <span class="italic">Negro</span> (1970; repr. 1996) reprints over half the essays but includes images of Cunard herself, in defiance of her own prefatory declaration that all of the book's illustrations were of black people and African objects. She called herself the &#145;maker&#146; of the book, which she saw as an international collective effort to recognize the black Atlantic as a global source of African cultures, rather than merely a part of the vogue for black art among white Europeans of the 1920s.<h2>
<a name="JournalismtheSpanishCivilWar"></a>Journalism; the Spanish Civil War</h2>In 1935 Cunard wrote to the head of the Chicago-based international wire service, the Associated Negro Press (ANP), for credentials to cover the Abyssinian crisis and Hailie Selassie's visit to the United Nations in Geneva. It was the beginning of three decades' work as a reporter&#151;almost exclusively on race issues&#151;to an international audience of mostly black newspaper readers in the US, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. She also wrote for Sylvia Pankhurst's <span class="italic">New Times</span>, the General News Service (British colonies, India, and the Far East) and Charles Duff's publications on the Spanish Civil War. For some of her radical journalism she used the pseudonym Ray Holt. George Padmore saw her off on the train for Barcelona on 10 August 1936, and she devoted herself intensively to the cause of Republican Spain for the next three years. Her articles urged Britain, France, and the US to stop their policy of non-intervention in the light of Germany and Italy's support for Franco. In Madrid, at Pablo Neruda's Casa de las Flores, Cunard joined other left intellectuals in collecting poems for Spain, later handset at home on her old printing press at Le Puits Carr&eacute; as six pamphlets, <span class="italic">Les po&egrave;tes du monde d&eacute;fendent le peuple espagnol</span>. These were produced in English, French, and Spanish, and included her own &#145;F.A.S.C.I.S.M.E&#146; as well as poems by Neruda, Aragon, Garcia Lorca, Langston Hughes, and most famously W. H. Auden's &#145;Spain&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1937 Cunard translated Pablo Neruda's &#145;To the Mothers of the Dead Militia&#146; and &#145;Almeria&#146;, for the <span class="italic">Left Review</span> and wrote an article on Langston Hughes, Jacques Roumain, and Nicolas Guillen called &#145;Three negro poets&#146;. Her own poems on Spain, including &#145;To Eat Today&#146; and a translation of Roumain's &#145;Madrid&#146;, were published in 1938. Her <span class="italic">Authors Take Sides on the Spanish War</span> appeared as a special issue of <span class="italic">Left Review</span> in 1937. This resulted from a call to British writers; of the replies, 126 were for the republic, five were for Franco and six were neutral. Cunard has not been given credit for originating this brilliant political strategy which, in organizing intellectuals to speak out on a political cause, was entirely in the spirit of the <span class="italic">Negro</span> anthology. The idea has been widely used since. <span class="italic">Authors Take Sides</span> included the signatures of black intellectuals Marcus Garvey, George Padmore, and C. L. R. James, an early and largely unrecognized instance of racial solidarity by the British left. The most effective part of her work for Spain was a series of articles in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> in 1938 and 1939 on the condition of the Spanish refugees in French concentration camps after the war. She managed to help a great many of them and was greeted as a heroine when she went to Chile in 1940. But her courageous efforts on their behalf in collecting money, clothing, and supplies were not appreciated by the French authorities, who stopped her from taking refugees from Perpignan back to her house in Normandy.<h2>
<a name="SecondWorldWarfinalyears"></a>Second World War; final years</h2>During the Second World War, Cunard worked as a translator for the BBC and the ministry of information. Here she encountered the pro-fascist broadcasts of her old friend, Ezra Pound, with which she expressed as much mystification as outrage. Much of her time in London was spent at the West African Students' Union and she continued to write race-related war stories for the ANP. Her most important work of the time was a collaboration with George Padmore called <span class="italic">The White Man's Duty</span> (1942). She also published another collective volume, <span class="italic">Poems for France</span> (1942; in French translation, 1947).<br>
<br>Returning to France after the war Cunard found that the Germans quartered in her house had destroyed her Hours Press books, most of her letters, her collections of modern paintings and African art, and her ivories. She eventually settled in an old stone house in LaMothe Fenelon in the Dordogne. Here she wrote her history of the Hours Press and her memoirs of Norman Douglas (1954) and George Moore (1956). In the outlaw status of both these men she found a source for imagining her own place as an eccentric rebel among minor characters in British cultural history; these memoirs contain all that there is of her autobiographical writing and have been extensively used by her biographers. She kept up her friendships with the left poets Sylvia Townsend Warner and Valentine Ackland, as well as with Janet Flanner and Solita Solano in Paris. But her behaviour became increasingly erratic, and she sought refuge in alcohol. Shortly after coming to London in 1960 she was committed to an asylum; having recovered somewhat, she persuaded Louis Aragon to secure her release, and returned to France. She died on 16 March 1965 in the H&ocirc;pital Cochin, Paris, weighing only 26 kilos, but still working on her epic poem against all wars. She was cremated at P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery on 25 March. George Sadoul wrote a tribute to her as the epitome of the jazz age: &#145;Around her shade float Afro-American blues and spirituals, Spanish Republican ballads and the immortal rhythms of French poetry&#146;, praising her &#145;great heart&#146;, &#145;brilliant intelligence&#146;, and &#145;strong character&#146;  (<span class="italic">Les lettres Fran&ccedil;aises</span>). Nancy Cunard was an outlaw, as she had envisaged in her poems, a serious political activist, who lived an intense and lonely life dedicated to her causes. She was also a minor English modernist poet. But she was also that rare creature on the world stage, the woman public intellectual. Her name is important in the history of surrealism and <i>le tumulte noir</i> in Paris, the struggle against Franco and fascism in the Spanish Civil War, and the twentieth-century global struggle for the recognition of African culture and the fight for racial justice.<br>
