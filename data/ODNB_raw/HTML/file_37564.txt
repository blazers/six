<span class="headword">Hooley,  Ernest Terah</span>  (1859&#150;1947), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born on 5 February 1859 in Sneinton, Nottinghamshire, the only child of Terah Hooley, lacemaker, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Peach. In his autobiography he claimed that the family had been farmers at Long Eaton, Derbyshire, since the eighteenth century. At the age of twenty-one he joined his father's lace business, and in the following year (1881) he married Annie Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Winlaw, the daughter of a baker, with whom he had four daughters and three sons. His earnings in his father's business (possibly helped by an inheritance from his mother) enabled him in 1888 to buy Risley Hall in Derbyshire for &pound;5000. In 1889 he left the lace business in search of larger fortunes and set up as a stockbroker in Nottingham.<br>
<br>In an age devoid of regulations to oversee the scrupulousness of share prospectuses and flotations, Hooley discovered a talent for making large sums of money by selling off companies at inflated prices and pocketing a sizeable percentage of the proceeds. Among them was his first public flotation in 1894&#151;that of an American subsidiary of Humber &amp; Co. Ltd, cycle manufacturers&#151;as well as household names such as Raleigh, Singer, Swift, and above all the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company, bought by Hooley and M. D. Rucker in 1896 for &pound;3 million and promptly floated at &pound;5 million (which was 80 per cent over-subscribed). Other celebrated companies to pass through Hooley's hands included Schweppes and Bovril (both in 1897). He also caused a stir with his purchase in 1896 and resale in segments of the Trafford Park estate in Manchester.<br>
<br>Partly for reasons of image-building, Hooley moved his business to London in 1896. He cultivated members of the aristocracy and sprinkled them among his company boards to impress potential investors. He affected a lavish lifestyle, purchasing Papworth Hall in Cambridgeshire for &pound;70,000 in 1895, and later adding several adjacent estates costing &pound;210,000. His entertainment featured abundant wine and cigars, although he himself was a non-smoking teetotaller.<br>
<br>Hooley's gilded years came to an abrupt end in June 1898, when he himself filed a petition for the first and most sensational of his four bankruptcies. The background to this was the ending of the cycle boom in the previous year. The specific causes of Hooley's failure remain obscure, owing partly to deliberate obfuscation and partly to the erratic nature of his business methods, including a total absence of accounts. He was certainly faced with claims for large commission payments arising out of his company promotions; and he alleged that his partner Martin Rucker had removed &pound;506,000 from the business (in addition to shares) in six months.<br>
<br>Bankruptcy sharply lowered Hooley's social position, but made less difference to his lifestyle, not least because before his crash he had made over to his wife both Papworth and Risley Hall and their contents. He was also allowed to continue trading, on condition that he kept his trustee supplied with a record of his financial affairs, so as to facilitate repayment of outstanding creditors. In the years 1899&#150;1904 Hooley was involved in a series of dubious companies concerned with exploiting concessions on foreign territories. It was in relation to one of these, the Siberian Goldfield Development Company formed in May 1900, that Hooley and his associate <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49308/', "H. J. Lawson")</script> were charged in 1904 with fraudulent share promotion. Hooley was acquitted, but Lawson received a twelve-month gaol sentence.<br>
<br>Thereafter Hooley steered clear of companies for some time, concentrating on land deals. In 1911&#150;12 he was involved almost simultaneously in three distinct sets of legal proceedings. First, his trustee, Mr Basden, charged him with contempt of court for failing to produce statements of his financial affairs over the preceding five years, and Hooley was eventually committed to Brixton prison for a month. Secondly, in October 1911 he faced a charge of obtaining money on false pretences in connection with an abortive land deal in Nottinghamshire, which ended with a twelve-month gaol sentence. Thirdly, he was declared bankrupt for the second time in 1912 on a creditor's petition.<br>
<br>During the boom which followed the end of the First World War, Hooley became involved in trading shares in the cotton industry. In 1921 he and five others were charged with fraudulent misrepresentation in floating shares of Jubilee Cotton Mills Ltd in 1919&#150;20. Hooley, as ringleader, received a three-year gaol sentence. He was also declared bankrupt for the third time in September 1921. His fourth bankruptcy followed in January 1939 on a petition of the Inland Revenue for an income-tax claim of &pound;699 17<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>.<br>
<br>For all his legal transgressions, Hooley was not an unattractive character: warm-hearted, dynamic, musically gifted (he played the piano and the organ), and with a contagious sense of humour. His enduring legacy was on the Papworth estate, where he left behind not merely a reputation for kindness and generosity, but a series of &#145;new model cottages&#146; for farmworkers, which continued to be appreciated several decades after his death. He died on 11 February 1947, at 197 College Street, Long Eaton, Derbyshire.<br>
