</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">MacCulloch,  John</span>  (1773&#150;1835), <span class="occ">surgeon and geologist</span>, was born on 6 October 1773 at his grandparents' home on Guernsey. He was the third of eight children born to James MacCulloch (1746&#150;1832), wine merchant of Roscoff, and his wife, Elizabeth de Lisle, daughter of Thomas de Lisle, a Guernsey jurat. John early showed his solitary and precocious nature, so his father sent him to schools in Cornwall between 1778 and 1790. In M'Gilvray's Grammar School, Lostwithiel, MacCulloch served as head pupil, and there he was inspired to become a doctor. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University from 1790 to 1794. He also read chemistry under Joseph Black and natural history under John Walker. In 1793, he graduated MD, presenting a dissertation, <span class="italic">De igne electreo</span>, reviewing uses of electricity to cure intermittent fevers. However, postgraduate studies were curtailed by his parents' internment during the French Revolution.<br>
<br>On 15 August 1795 MacCulloch became surgeon's mate in the Royal Artillery, rising to senior assistant surgeon by 1803, then being drafted to the ordnance chemical department, becoming ordnance chemist in 1806 and retiring from the army with a small military pension. In September 1808 he became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians and settled at Blackheath, where he practised privately until 1811 when ordnance duties necessitated prolonged absences for geological surveys. Always an opportunist, in 1820 he became physician to Prince Leopold, later king of the Belgians. MacCulloch's principal contribution to medicine was his compilation and analysis of data on fevers. He attributed recurrent fevers to bad air which he made the theme of his book, <span class="italic">Malaria</span> (1827). His description of symptoms and analysis of causes showed an appreciation of the role of the environment in propagating malarial disease. He published <span class="italic">An Essay on the Remittent Diseases</span> in 1828 and argued that there were causal links between malaria and other intermittent fevers but ignored some contrary evidence.<br>
<br>As ordnance chemist MacCulloch prepared chemicals, analysed materials, and gave lectures on chemistry, first to students of the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, then to East India Company military cadets at Addiscombe. He lectured at Woolwich (1803&#150;21) and at Addiscombe (1814&#150;35). During the Napoleonic wars he was responsible for analysing purity of sulphur and nitrate shipments for the gunpowder mills and he checked the efficacy of gunpowder delivered from them. When the powdermill wheels of Belgian limestone wore out in 1809, MacCulloch was assigned the task of locating British replacement limestone; thus began his paid geological fieldwork.<br>
<br>MacCulloch's growing interest in geology evinced itself in diaries of tours in the Lake District in 1805 and the west country in 1807, during which he visited mines and commented upon rocks, but his zeal was best expressed when he joined the Geological Society of London in 1808 and promptly read a paper on Channel Island geology. Between 1809 and 1813 he conducted geological surveys in Wessex, Wales, and Scotland, searching for silica-free limestone for millwheels. He located appropriate rocks in Skye and Sutherland but the quarries were difficult to work so no wheels were delivered.<br>
<br>Each summer from 1814 to 1821 MacCulloch acted as geologist to the ordnance trigonometrical survey. His tasks were to examine the geology of rocks around the survey stations to determine whether they were dense enough to distort the position of the vertical plumb line and so introduce errors in the survey, and also to find a detached mountain of simple geological structure where the deflection produced by a known mass could be measured exactly. In eight seasons he examined the geology of hundreds of Scottish peaks, completed a geological map of west Scotland, and recommended Ben Stack and Ailsa Craig for the deflection experiment.<br>
<br>Thorough descriptions of MacCulloch's discoveries concerning Scottish rocks were published in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Geological Society of London</span> where his closely reasoned and well illustrated papers epitomized the Baconian skills advocated by the society. He served as Geological Society president in 1816&#150;18, but his wide scientific expertise was best attested by his election as fellow of the Royal Society in 1820. Unexpectedly, survey work took its toll; after he suffered enlargement of the spleen in 1821, he was unfit for duty until 1822, and remained unhealthy thereafter.<br>
<br>In 1824 ordnance establishments were being cut; the chemical department was abolished, with MacCulloch retiring on pension, and the geological survey was transferred to the Treasury. Until 1832 MacCulloch spent each summer surveying central and southern Scotland to complete his map. Costs exceeded &pound;1000 per year but although the Scottish geological fraternity challenged the expenditure in parliament during 1830&#150;31, the survey was completed. MacCulloch suffered a stroke in 1831, but he rallied to draft the final reports and map which were demanded by the Treasury when prompted by Robert Jameson, who roused the Highland Society to seek publication.<br>
<br>Latterly MacCulloch was alienated from geological peers who had hailed his success in 1819 on publishing <span class="italic">A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland</span> and again in 1821 when he released <span class="italic">A Geological Classification of Rocks</span>, which served ten years as textbook for his geology lectures in the East India College. Those books embodied the results of careful field observation and demonstrated understanding of crystalline rock origins, and the power of erosion. From 1821 onwards writing was an auxiliary source of income and occupation and MacCulloch wrote dozens of scientific papers, book reviews, and articles for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</span>. His most controversial book, <span class="italic">The Highlands and Western Islands of Scotland</span> (1824), stated that lazy highlanders should be cleared from the land, and met virulent opposition. MacCulloch's scientific reputation was marred by his last geology book, <span class="italic">The System of Geology</span>, published in 1831. He wrote it before 1824 but found no funds to publish until 1830 when his ideas, largely based on studies of crystalline rocks, had become unfashionable. Fossils had become the favoured analytical tool in geology, but MacCulloch belittled their value.<br>
<br>MacCulloch was a handsome, charming man in his prime, about 1820 when Faulkner painted him, but as his health deteriorated his face became puffy and his manner acerbic. Nevertheless, he married Louisa Margaretta White of Croydon on 6 July 1835 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. On honeymoon in Cornwall he suffered severe injuries in a carriage accident near Penzance and died after the amputation of a leg on 20 August 1835. He was buried at Gulval church near Penzance.<br>
<br>The 4 mile to an inch Scottish geological map by MacCulloch appeared in 1836 and was criticized for topographical and geological inaccuracy, but it was not superseded for many years. His widow published his <span class="italic">Proofs and Illustrations of the Attributes of God</span> in 1837. In it he argued that geological evidence revealed the work of God in creation, an idea well received by the Church of England, but tested by Charles Darwin against his embryonic theory of evolution.<br>
<br>MacCulloch bequeathed money which supported his widow for twenty-three years and he left publications on medicine and geology which acted as the solid observational basis for later theoretical development. A contemporary, Charles Lyell, praised MacCulloch as an observer and commented on the powerful and lasting value of his written work. A twentieth-century biography considered that MacCulloch's work &#145;greatly advanced general knowledge of the varied rock formations of Scotland, especially that of the igneous rocks&#146;  (Eyles, 593&#150;5). Finally, MacCulloch exemplified early scientific professionalization in Britain, first challenging government bureaucracy to meet administrative and financial burdens involved in geological research.<br>
