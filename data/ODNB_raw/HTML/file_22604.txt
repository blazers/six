</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pott,  Percivall</span>  (1714&#150;1788), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, only son of Percivall Pott (1681&#150;1717), a notary and scrivener of London, was born on 6 January 1714 in Threadneedle Street, City of London, now the site of the Bank of England. The house was probably destroyed when the east and west wings of the bank were built between 1766 and 1788. Members of the Pott family, originally from Cheshire, settled in London in the late seventeenth century as grocers and vintners. In 1712 Pott's father had married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1745), daughter of William Symonds, a vintner, and widow of Benjamin, son of Sir John Houblon, the first governor of the Bank of England. Benjamin Houblon, an army officer, died in Lisbon in 1708, leaving his widow and a daughter, also named Elizabeth. The early death of Pott's father in 1717 left his mother a widow for the second time and, it is believed, her young family in straitened financial circumstances.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Fortunately, Elizabeth Pott and her two children were assisted by a distant relative, Dr Wilcox, bishop of Rochester, and, at the age of seven, Percivall was sent to a private school at Darenth in Kent. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8399/', "Sir James Earle")</script>, Pott's son-in-law and former apprentice, stated in a short biography preceding the 1790 edition of Pott's collected works that Pott formed an early taste for classical knowledge and was recommended to enter the church where his prospects of preferment were considerable. This he declined for a compelling interest in surgery and, aged fifteen years in 1729, he was bound apprentice to Edward Nourse for a premium of 200 guineas. Nourse was then assistant surgeon to St Bartholomew's Hospital and, unlike most of his colleagues, gave lectures on anatomy and surgery, delivering them at London House in Aldersgate Street where it was Pott's duty to prepare dissections for demonstration. These early anatomical studies combined with wide reading, daily exposure to clinical problems, and practical surgery, allied to an excellent memory, soon gained Pott professional respect. Earle reports that during his later apprenticeship, Pott being &#145;confident in the fair prospect of industry, hired a house of considerable rent in Fenchurch Street, and took with him his mother and her daughter by her first husband&#146;  (Earle, x). When Pott presented himself to the court of examiners of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company in 1736, it was recorded,<blockquote>not having waited on all the Governors and Examiners to desire the favour of their presence at his examination, and it appearing to the Court that Mr. Pott had been sent for out of town to attend Sir Robert Goodesall's lady, where he was detained so long as not to be able to return within the time limited &hellip; It was resolved that the Court would proceed to the examination of the said Mr. Pott notwithstanding his default in attending the Examiners: But this is not to be taken as a precedent &hellip; to any other person. (Dobson, 55)</blockquote>This confirmed an established reputation, for he received not only his freedom of the company but, on the same day, 7 September 1736, passed the difficult grand diploma. At this time he was still in Fenchurch Street, but when he took the livery of the company in 1739 he had moved to Bow Lane. With growing expertise and practice he applied for a post as assistant surgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital and, after an initial failure, was successful in 1745. That same year was important for the breakup of the Barber&#150;Surgeons' Company and the formation of the Company of Surgeons, later the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1753 Pott and William Hunter were elected the first lecturers in anatomy to the new company; Pott became a member of the court of examiners in 1763, and master of the company in 1765.<br>
<br>At St Bartholomew's Hospital Pott saw many patients and acquired the profound clinical experience so evident in his later written work. After moving to Watling Street he began informal classes for private pupils in anatomy and surgery. Initially lecturing with hesitation and reserve, according to Earle, he later developed confidence, eloquence, and a manner which &#145;gave importance to every subject, and impressed his audience with the idea, that the art which he taught was worthy of their highest ambition&#146;  (Earle, xxiii). Appointment to full surgeon at St Bartholomew's in 1749 enabled him to challenge long established and painful therapeutic measures, in particular to restrict the use of hot iron cauteries, of caustic applications, and of dangerous mechanical equipment employed to reduce major joint dislocations.<h2>
<a name="Anaccidentinspiresauthorship"></a>An accident inspires authorship</h2>On a cold January day in 1756 Pott sustained an injury which proved a turning point in his career and a stimulus to the original contributions associated with his name. In the words of Earle:<blockquote>As he was riding in Kent-street, Southwark, he was thrown from his horse, and suffered a compound fracture of the leg, the bone being forced through the integuments. Conscious of the dangers attendant on fractures of this nature, and thoroughly aware how much they may be increased by rough treatment, or improper position, he would not suffer himself to be moved until he had made the necessary dispositions. He sent to Westminster, then the nearest place, for two chairmen, to bring their poles; and patiently lay on the cold pavement, &hellip; In this situation he purchased a door, to which he made them nail their poles. When all was ready he caused himself to be laid on it, and was carried through Southwark, over London-bridge, to Watling-street, near St Paul's [over a mile], &hellip; At a consultation of surgeons, the case was thought to be so desperate as to require immediate amputation. Mr Pott, convinced that no one could be a proper judge in his own case, submitted to their opinion; and the instruments were actually got ready, when Mr. Nourse, who had been prevented from coming sooner, fortunately entered the room. After examining the limb, he conceived there was a possibility of preserving it; an attempt to save it was acquiesced in, and succeeded. (Earle, xiv&#150;xv)</blockquote>Commenting on compound long bone fracture in <span class="italic">Fractures and Dislocations</span> (1768) Pott stated that it &#145;either unites or heals as it were by the first intention, which is the case of some lucky few (as was my own) or it is attended with high inflammation&#146;. This statement and Earle's words suggest that the fracture sustained was not, as often alleged, a Pott's fracture, or fracture-dislocation of the ankle as meticulously analysed in his writings&#151;a Pott's fracture is not a fracture of the leg, meaning the shin in eighteenth century parlance. It is of interest that three well-known surgeons, Ambroise Par&eacute;, Richard Wiseman, and Pott avoided amputation after compound tibial fractures at a time when dismemberment was commonly advised.<br>
<br>Necessarily confined to bed and home for three months or so Pott started to write an essay on hernias, published in late 1756 as <span class="italic">A Treatise on Ruptures</span>. Prior to this, his only communication was a short paper in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</span>, in 1741, entitled &#145;An account of tumours which rendered the bones soft&#146;. The book's immediate success generated a series of monographs during the succeeding twenty-eight years which analysed ophthalmic, neurological, genito-urinary, orthopaedic, and traumatological subjects. Fortuitously, the enforced rest of his fracture revealed a talent for writing which otherwise might not have flourished.<h2>
<a name="Surgicalrenown"></a>Surgical renown</h2>In 1764 Pott's second paper, &#145;An account of a hernia of the urinary bladder, including a stone&#146;, was published by the Royal Society, which elected him a fellow. Succeeding Nourse as senior surgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1765 enabled Pott to give his course of surgical lectures publicly to large audiences; these became celebrated and, coupled with his writings, disseminated his views and methods widely.<br>
<br>With a growing private practice Pott moved house to Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1769 and finally to Princes Street, Hanover Square, in 1777. Among important patients he saw David Garrick, Samuel Johnson, and Thomas Gainsborough. He confirmed, with William Cruikshank, that Johnson had a solid tumour (sarcocoele) of the testis and not a simple hydrocele and, with John Hunter, that Gainsborough had inoperable cancer involving the neck. Earle stated that Pott's evenings were often occupied answering letters of consultation on cases in Europe, Russia, Turkey, and India. In 1786 the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh made him an honorary fellow, the first such fellowship to be awarded, and in 1787 the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland made him an honorary member. At the age of seventy-three he resigned from St Bartholomew's Hospital, having walked its wards for fifty-eight years. He was made a hospital governor and continued in private practice until his death. John Hunter and Henry Park were both pupils of Pott.<br>
<br>In 1746 Pott married Sarah, daughter of Robert Cruttenden, and they produced five sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22603/', "Joseph Holden Pott")</script>, archdeacon of London, and four daughters. According to Earle:<blockquote>The labours of the greatest part of his life were without relaxation; an increasing family requiring his utmost exertion: of late years he had a villa at Neasden; and in the autumn usually passed a month at Bath, or at the sea-side. (Earle, xliv)</blockquote>And: &#145;The person of Mr Pott was elegant, though lower than middle size: his countenance animated and expressive; his manners and deportment were graceful&#146;  (Earle, xliii). His kindness of heart was proverbial, and he is said to have had at one time three needy surgeons living in his house. His high character and blameless life helped to raise the surgeon's social standing in this country.<h2>
<a name="Surgicalconceptsandphilosophy"></a>Surgical concepts and philosophy</h2>Pott was an experienced and proficient lecturer and doubtless his lecture notes were the source of later publications. This is borne out in copies of Pott's lectures which survive in the manuscript hand of students, deposited in the Royal College of Surgeons of England, St Bartholomew's Hospital, and the Royal Society of Medicine; similarities between these notes and his publications are often close. One student recorded Pott's humane approach to patients thus:<blockquote>in performing an operation, always remember you have a diseased body, endowed with the greatest degree of sensibility and feeling; give therefore the least possible pain imaginable, be not too quick to strive to show your dexterity, by doing which you may cut parts which ought not to be cut, but be calm and moderate, and let this be a general rule with you. If it is well done, it is soon done. (&#145;Surgical lectures&#146;)</blockquote>Pott's conception of surgery demanded continuous improvement, towards which he contributed by objective analysis of hard gained experience. He challenged colleagues who accepted, automatically, earlier authors with most of whom Pott was familiar, due to his command of Latin and French. In the preface to <span class="italic">A Treatise on Fistula in ano</span> (1765) Pott wrote:<blockquote>The honour of our art and the moral character of its professors suffer, whenever we pay blind deference to anyone, as prevents us from using our own judgement, and from declaring freely the results of our enquiries or experiments. Truth, as Lord Bacon has said, is not the child of authority but of time. And were we to allow ourselves to suppose (let the subject be what it may) that nothing more, or new, could be taught, it is pretty clear that nothing more, or new, would be learnt.</blockquote>And he added in the preface to <span class="italic">Chirurgical Observations</span> (1775): &#145;[It is by] careful attention to the cases of individuals, and from an observation of diseases &hellip; that true and extensive judgement can be acquired&#146;.<br>
<br>In the preface to <span class="italic">A Treatise on Ruptures</span> (1756) Pott remarked:<blockquote>The ancient surgery was coarse, and loaded with a farrago of external applications, some of which were horribly, and yet unnecessarily painful, and others altogether useless; whilst the operative part of the art was encumbered with a multitude of awkward unmanageable instruments, and pieces of machinery. The practitioners of the present time have brought the practice into a much narrower compass &hellip; by a sedulous application to anatomy, by the frequent examination of dead morbid bodies, by making such experiments on the living, as they had just reason to think would prove beneficial &hellip; and not persisting in tormenting their fellow-creatures merely for gain.</blockquote>Pott's style of writing frequently won him praise. However, in the preface to <span class="italic">Hydrocele, or, Watry Rupture</span> (1767) Pott claimed:<blockquote>The character of an elegant writer I make no pretension to: that of a skilful surgeon &hellip; I should be extremely glad to deserve. &hellip; When &hellip; information is intended to be conveyed to many people of different capacities, it may be necessary to set the same object in several different lights; and to repeat the same thoughts many times in different words: to those who have not been much conversant with the thing treated of, a studied brevity would become a perplexing obscurity; however satisfied such readers might be with the stile of the writer, they would not be sufficiently acquainted with the subject; they might be pleased but they would not be informed.</blockquote>In further advice to the profession given in his preface to <span class="italic">Observations on &hellip; Fistula lachrymalis</span> (1758) Pott emphasized:<blockquote>The operative part of surgery is far from being the whole of it: and I cannot help thinking, that by attending a little more to what is called common or practical surgery [that is, venesection, catheterization, and so on], our art might still be considerably improved, practitioners rendered expert, and mankind much benefitted. &hellip; It is a false idea which the bystanders at an operation generally have of chirurgic &#145;dexterity&#146;; to which word they annex no other idea than that of quickness. This had produced a most absurd custom of measuring the motion of a surgeon's hand, as jockeys do that of the feet of a horse, viz. by a stop watch.</blockquote>Ever sensitive to the sufferings of patients and anxious to diminish the pain of operative procedures, Pott criticized the management of <i>fistula in ano</i> in his preface to <span class="italic">A Treatise on Fistula in ano</span> (1765), writing:<blockquote>The term Cutting for a Fistula, conveys to a patient a terrible idea; this terror is not a little increased by his incapacity to see the part diseased. The majority of writers have greatly increased, rather than lessened, this dread: and as the operation is (under their direction) sometimes performed, it is, indeed, a very severe one: &hellip; A more serious reflection &hellip; would lead us to a more rational method of treating it, and to a more easy and expeditious cure.</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="Pottspublications"></a>Pott's publications</h2>Pott spurned publication of a systematic surgical textbook in favour of single subject studies which, he maintained, promoted greater attention to detail. Further, these relatively short books appeared at prices appealing to students: 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. has been quoted. Each monograph debated a burning topic of the day and their popularity is evident from the numerous editions, translations into German, French, Dutch, and Italian, and several issues of collected works, lastly in 1819.<br>
<br>If Pott's <span class="italic">Treatise on Ruptures</span> (1756) first drew attention to his ability as a surgical author, it lacked the detailed references of later works and the individual clinical case observations of several others. None the less, Pott's vigorous challenge to old ideas and methods, his concern for patients mishandled by ignorant practitioners, and his overall lucidity set a pattern repeated in later monographs. Pott's advocacy of early operation for strangulated inguinal hernia must have saved numerous lives yet, after reduction of the hernia, he did not repair the defect. If indicated, gangrenous bowel was sutured to the wound margin, a dressing was applied, and the patient was kept horizontal until the wound healed. Rarely the scarring repaired the hernia naturally; most patients needed a steel truss permanently. Unhappily, repair sutures left at depth, prior to antiseptic techniques, usually festered, with uncertain results.<br>
<br>Pott's <span class="italic">Account of a Particular Kind of Rupture Frequently Attendant upon New-Born Children</span> (1757) is a short work on congenital hernias; it contains no references and was criticized harshly by William Hunter, who claimed that Pott failed to acknowledge Hunter's prior description at student lectures given in 1756. He wrote: &#145;It was what any of my pupils might have written &hellip; it bore strong marks of second-hand observations, and of time-serving hurry in the composition&#146;  (Hunter, 70). Hunter later apologized for any unintended offence, accepting Pott's probity in the matter. In the event, both deferred to an earlier suggestion of Samuel Sharp and the work of Albrecht von Haller who coined the term hernia congenita in <span class="italic">Opuscula pathologica</span> (1755).<br>
<br>Pott's next publication was <span class="italic">Observations on that Disorder of the Corner of the Eye, Commonly called Fistula lachrymalis</span> (1758). This was followed by <span class="italic">Observations on the Nature and Consequences of Wounds and Contusions of the Head and Fractures of the Skull Concussion of the Brain, etc</span> (1760). This has a preface but no case observations or plates, unlike a revised publication on the same subject published eight years later. The 1760 works is of interest for a long preface debating Pott's wider surgical tenets and views on head injury. He wrote:<blockquote>The symptoms brought on by the pressure of a piece broken off from the inner table of the skull, are scarcely distinguishable from those produced by blood or lymph pressing on the brain, each of which is certainly a very different cause of mischief. These combinations of causes and symptoms, and the uncertainty &hellip; make this a very disagreeable part of surgery: but merely lamenting, will never mend it; and as the inconvenience which we feel is great, our attempts to get information ought to be in proportion.</blockquote>
<span class="italic">Practical remarks on the hydrocele or watry rupture, and some other diseases of the testicle, its coats and vessels, etc</span> (1762) is a long treatise that defines swellings of the scrotum and their treatment. Well referenced, it is amplified by thirty-six detailed case observations, increased to fifty-one in later editions. Here, as in other treatises, Pott provides excellent anatomico-pathological descriptions based on accurate clinical records enhanced by careful post-mortem studies. He limited the false or spurious rupture either to fluid swellings around the testis or to solid testicular swellings known as sarcoceles. To discharge hydrocele fluid Pott favoured a trocar and cannula, in preference to uncertain lancet puncture. For radical cure he introduced a seton of fine lint to excite local inflammation and obliterative scarring of the hydrocele cavity; in 1771 he wrote <span class="italic">An account of the method of obtaining a perfect or radical cure of the hydrocele &hellip; by means of a seton</span>, which illustrated improved instrumentation for inserting silk threads. When diagnosed early, sarcocele due to a scirrhus (tuberculosis) or cancer was treated by orchidectomy to avoid a miserable demise; he deplored local applications of caustic and uncertain ulcerative mortification. Pott's manuscript of the second edition (1766) was deposited in the Royal College of Surgeons.<br>
<br>Pott's <span class="italic">Remarks on the Disease Commonly called Fistula in ano</span> (1765) referred particularly to contemporaneous French authors but without case observations. In the preface, he said:<blockquote>I have, on this occasion, carefully perused almost every writer of character on the subject; and think, that I may venture to say, that they are all either defective, or erroneous: they either pass the disease over slightly &hellip; or subject it to a method of cure, which is operose, painful, tedious, and unnecessarily productive of future evil.</blockquote>Pott said that many surgeons believed, erroneously, that every perineal sinus was fistulous and hence operated precipitately. If surgery was necessary he opposed the blind use of probe scissors inside the anal canal and recommended a curved probe pointed knife; later he devised a more sophisticated probe blade with movable guard. Benjamin Bell considered Pott's monograph the first to treat the subject with precision.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Observations on the Nature and Consequences of those Injuries to which the Head is Liable from External Violence</span> (1768) is one of Pott's longest and most important treatises, incorporating his preliminary study of 1760 but enlarged with forty-three case observations, references, and illustrations. Acknowledging the work of Henry-Fran&ccedil;ois Le Dran, Pott emphasized that brain injury and not skull damage dictated outcomes. Recommending early skull decompression, he was criticized for operating prophylactically by contemporaries such as William Dease in <span class="italic">Observations on Wounds of the Head</span> (1776). Comparison of his twenty-five observations with Pott's forty-three shows that most of Dease's patients had been assaulted while Pott's had been victims of a wider range of injuries including animal kicks and falls from horses, vehicles, scaffolding, and ladders, and two boys struck accidentally with cricket bats. Pott's cases were probably more severe; most deaths were subjected to post-mortem examination. Curiously 44 per cent of Dease's and 42 per cent of Pott's patients recovered, yet Dease trephined 80 per cent and Pott only 63 per cent, although several of Pott's patients had repeated procedures. Of those trephined, only 30 per cent of Dease's compared to 63 per cent of Pott's patients recovered; of those trephined early (within 24 hours), four of five of Dease's patients and two of six of Pott's died. Perhaps Pott's technique of trephining was more accurate and less inclined to infection. Others reporting detailed histories, including John Hunter, did not achieve Pott's success with the trephine. Pott noted that undisplaced closed fractures often formed epidural collections which suppurated to form a swelling, described as &#145;a puffy, circumscribed, indolent tumour of the scalp, and a spontaneous separation of the pericranium from the skull under such tumour&#146;  (P. Pott, <span class="italic">Observations on the Nature and Consequences of those Injuries to which the Head is Liable from External Violence</span>, 1768, 53). &#145;Pott's puffy tumour&#146; was considered a bad sign requiring early surgery.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">Some Few General Remarks on Fractures and Dislocations</span> (1768) Pott wrote: &#145;it is by no means my intention to write a regular treatise on fractures &hellip; I only mean to throw out a few hints&#146;  (8). However, this monograph of 126 pages is considered by many to be his most important contribution, for two reasons. First, he argued that long bone fractures subjected to powerful extension developed deforming muscle tension and were better managed without extension by relaxing the limb in flexion. As an example he drew attention to fractures of the humerus which healed routinely with the elbow flexed in a sling. His drawing shows that femoral and tibial fractures were positioned on their side with the knee and foot flexed before final splinting. This method introduced a need to splint joints both above and below tibial fractures, a fundamental concept which persisted. His scheme, popular in Britain and France, proved less so in America. At the end of the twentieth century conservative fracture management combined extension and the physiological doctrine of Pott: thus for the lower limb plaster was applied and traction apparatus was designed to permit partial knee flexion, although the foot was held in neutral.<br>
<br>Second, Pott drew attention to a particular fracture of the lower fibula combined with disruption of the inner ankle ligaments and dislocation of the tibia from the joint. Rarely, the lower tibia protruded through skin and gangrene was possible; if recovery followed conventional treatment, flat foot deformity, a permanent iron support, and disabling lameness were probable. Pott believed that a side posture on pillows with the knee flexed promoted reduction of the dislocation and a corrected stable result. This is Pott's fracture, a term used daily in every accident department in Britain to encompass almost all fractures at ankle level; very few recall the specificity of Pott's original description.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Chirurgical observations relative to the cataract, the polypus of the nose, the cancer of the scrotum, the different kinds of ruptures, and the mortifications of the toes and feet</span> appeared in 1775. For cataract Pott counselled long established lens couching or depression instead of a recently introduced lens extraction procedure. Suffering himself from nasal polypi he counselled care in assessing their suitability for extraction; he employed a polypus forceps. Pott's pioneering account of scrotal cancer brought attention to an occupational disease caused by chimney soot. Cure was possible if early excision of the ulcerated scrotal sore was performed before testicular involvement. On ruptures he described twenty-four further case observations. For gangrene of the toes and feet he recommended opium by mouth twice daily which alleviated pain and often produced a local healing reaction. This regime persisted, in Britain at least, for more than a century.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Remarks on that kind of palsy of the lower limbs which is frequently found to accompany a curvature of the spine</span> (1779) was followed in 1782 by his <span class="italic">Farther remarks on the useless state of the lower limbs in consequence of a curvature of the spine: being a supplement to a former treatise on that subject</span>. These two tracts generated the eponymous description, Pott's disease of the spine, <i>le mal vert&eacute;bral de Pott</i> of the French, despite a similar description given by J. -P. David in his <span class="italic">Dissertation sur les effets du mouvement et du repos dans les maladies chirurgicales</span> in 1779; this work was overlooked until much later. Pott associated changes in the spine with a strumous or scrophulous disposition, combined with local abcesses in the loin, groin, and thigh, and his treatment included the formation of issues, made by caustic, to discharge adjacent to the vertebral angulation; this involved rest in bed which doubtless contributed to healing; at the same time he discouraged the use of splints and apparatus. The 1782 publication, illustrated with plates of spinal pathology, included healed vertebrae from a patient, after Pott's issue therapy, who died from other reasons. St Bartholomew's Hospital museum displays carious spinal specimens either prepared by Pott or taken from patients under his care. Pott described the spastic nature of the palsy and lamented many victims of the disease in infancy and childhood, observing: &#145;a malady which, when an infant becomes its victim, renders all the care and tears, all the tenderness and anxiety of the fondest parent absolutely unavailing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Farther remarks on the useless state of the lower limbs</span>, 3). He claimed that issues encouraged cure and, in children, perhaps paravertebral abcesses were drained; on recovery they were mobilized in his &#145;go-cart&#146;, a form of baby-walker which kept the child upright. Once criticized for a neglect of splintage, his direct drainage technique was revised later, under antibiotic cover, as a method of choice in the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Pott's remarks on amputation were a response to doubts raised throughout Europe by Johann Ulrich Bilguer's book (1764) on the inutility of amputation. Pott accepted the terrible nature of amputation through sound flesh but concluded that it was &#145;in certain circumstances, absolutely and indispensably necessary&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks on &hellip; Palsy of the Lower Limbs</span>, 16). Careful selection and early operation were emphasized. Unlike John Hunter he experienced poor results after ligature of lower limb aneurysms and recommended amputation. For scrophulous (tuberculous) joints, amputation was generally accepted, for Henry Park's pioneering joint excisions were not reported until 1783, curiously enough in a letter specifically addressed to Pott, entitled &#145;An account of a new method of treating diseases of the joints of the knee and elbow&#146;.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>In severe weather on 11 December 1788 Pott visited a patient 20 miles from London and came back with a cold. On developing a fever he curtailed further visits but matters worsened and he died at his house in Hanover Square on 22 December, probably of pneumonia; his burial took place on 7 January 1789 at St Mary Aldermary, where a commemorative tablet was erected. He was survived by his wife. Remarkably, no full-length biography of Pott has been published. T. J. Horder commented in 1894: &#145;Our knowledge of Pott's life is by no means extensive. It does not seem to have been of that kind which invites the pen of the biographer&#146;  (Horder, 165). If Pott's personal life is sketchy, his surgical activities are documented in detail and remain a basis for further studies.<br>
<br>Pott introduced a wholesome scepticism into surgical practice, placing emphasis on personal observations described with clarity and accuracy, illuminated by a mastery of macroscopic anatomy and diligent post-mortem dissection. Unlike many contemporaries he recorded success and failure alike, believing more was gleaned from an unfavourable than a favourable case. Over fifty years of practice Pott's workload was prodigious, his opinion eagerly sought, and his teaching at the bedside and at lectures widely acclaimed. He devised and simplified many instruments. Without antiseptic wound care his operative results were often remarkable. Before statistical methods evolved he judged the probability of events by attentive comparison of similar cases. He promoted ethical standards, stating that surgeons had a duty to inform relatives fully of their motives and conduct.<br>
<br>Critics suggest that Pott's surgery had no scientific basis, comparing him unfavourably to immediate British successors, including John Hunter, Benjamin Bell, John Abernethy, and Astley Cooper. However, their improvements and Pott's were of the same mould; indeed they were students of Pott's and built on his foundations. If they all achieved renown, for different reasons, Pott at least equalled them clinically and excelled them in his mastery of previous authors, and in the quality of his written work. Over two centuries later Pott's fracture and Pott's disease persist in everyday surgical language. His publications achieved a refreshing impact on contemporary practice and remain a rich source central to our understanding of eighteenth-century surgical progress.<br>
