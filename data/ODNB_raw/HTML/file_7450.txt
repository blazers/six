<span class="headword">Delaune,  Paul</span>  (<em>c.</em>1585&#150;1655?), <span class="occ">medical practitioner</span>, was born in the parish of St Anne Blackfriars, London, the youngest of the four surviving sons of the Huguenot immigrant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7452/', "William Delaune (c.1530&#150;1611)")</script>, physician and Reformed minister, and Katherine des Loges (<i>d</i>. 1607). He was thus the youngest brother of the wealthy Blackfriars apothecary <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7449/', "Gideon Delaune")</script>.<br>
<br>Paul Delaune was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he proceeded MA in 1610. He graduated MD at the University of Padua on 13 October 1614, the degree being incorporated at Cambridge on 4 November 1615. He was examined before the censors' board of the College of Physicians on 8 September 1615, was admitted a candidate of the college on 25 June 1616, and became a fellow on 21 April 1618. During the previous year (22 November 1617) he married, in his parish of St Anne Blackfriars, Sarah Argent the sister of John Argent who was to be eight times president of the College of Physicians (1625&#150;33).<br>
<br>When Lord Falkland was appointed lord deputy of Ireland in 1622, Delaune accompanied him as his physician, and lived in Dublin for many years. There he worked for the formation of a college of physicians in Dublin, modelled on that in London, but this project was not realized until 1654, well after Delaune had left Ireland. By 24 May 1642 (by which time his wife had died) he was in London again, when he was made an elect, and in 1643 senior censor, of the College of Physicians. On 13 June 1643, after the withdrawal of Thomas Winston to the continent, Delaune was appointed professor of physic in Gresham College through the influence of Thomas Chamberlane, a member of the Mercers' Company. For over nine years Delaune carried out his professorial duties with efficiency and success. On 27 June 1643 he volunteered to act as one of three college physicians serving the parliamentary army under the earl of Essex. Delaune's involvement in the parliamentary cause, his education at Emmanuel College, and his service as an elder of the French church of London from 1651 to 1654 strongly suggest that he was of puritan religious inclinations.<br>
<br>In 1652 Thomas Winston returned to England and was restored to the Gresham professorship. For some time after his compulsory resignation of the chair of physic Delaune was in straitened circumstances. In 1654 he accepted from Cromwell the appointment of physician-general to the fleet that was about to embark to capture Hispaniola as part of the &#145;western design&#146;. He was probably present at the capture of Jamaica in 1655, but appears to have been been lost at sea shortly thereafter, as the fleet on its return could give no information regarding his whereabouts.<br>
<br>John Ward, in his <span class="italic">Lives of the Professors of Gresham College</span> (1740), writes of Delaune that &#145;He was naturally of an easy temper, and chearful with a small fortune, temperate and frugal himself, tho indulgent to his children some of whom probably survived him&#146;  (Ward, 268&#150;9). His will of 13 December 1654 mentions three children: his son and heir, Benjamin Delaune, a merchant of the East India Company, and his daughters, Elizabeth and Olave.<br>
