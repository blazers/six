<span class="headword">Shirwood,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1493), <span class="occ">bishop of Durham</span>, was the son of John Shirwood of York, the city's common clerk, and Agnes, his wife. He was educated at both Cambridge and Oxford, for as MA and BTh of the former he supplicated for DTh at the latter in 1456. By this time he had already been admitted to his first living, that of Terrington in his native Yorkshire. He owed his further advancement to the patronage of George Neville, who at the age of twenty-five was consecrated bishop of Exeter in 1458, and for whom Shirwood acted as Latin secretary. He became chancellor of Exeter Cathedral in 1460 and followed Neville to York in 1465, being collated archdeacon of Richmond on 5 July 1465 and receiving the &#145;golden prebend&#146; of Masham on 5 August 1471; these two livings alone provided him with an income of some &pound;350 p.a. Pardoned by Edward IV in 1471 for his acquiescence in Henry VI's readeption, he became a king's chaplain and within three years had taken up residence in Rome. In 1476 he became an apostolic protonotary, and in the following year was made the king's proctor at the curia, which he remained until Edward IV's death in 1483.<br>
<br>Shirwood is sometimes said to have returned to England in time to participate in Richard III's coronation, but this seems to be based on a confusion with Bishop William Dudley of Durham whom he was shortly to succeed. The evidence implies that he was continuously in Rome, and he was certainly there as Richard's representative early in 1484. Elected on 30 January and provided by 29 March 1484, he was consecrated at Rome on 26 May as bishop of Durham. Richard III also recommended to Sixtus IV that he be made a cardinal. He was almost certainly engaged, unsuccessfully, in pressing Sixtus's successor Innocent VIII not to sanction Henry Tudor's cause, being advocated early in 1485 by his fellow bishop, John Morton (then in exile). He remained in Rome after Richard III's overthrow, being willing to serve his new king, Henry VII, as proctor from February 1486. He probably returned to England thereafter, but was almost immediately sent back to Rome, as one of the king's envoys to tender his obedience, and arrived there on 8 May 1487. He had not as yet visited his diocese, the temporalities of which had been restored to him only on 16 August 1485, very shortly before Bosworth. A series of undated letters to him from John Auckland, prior of Durham, the last probably written on 1 February 1488, anticipated his arrival in the north-east. But he probably did not set foot in the palatinate until towards the end of 1489, his first recorded action being the appointment of Alexander Lee as his chancellor on 12 January 1490. He stayed in his diocese for little more than two years, before he was once more appointed the king's proctor and orator at the curia. He was in London in February 1492; and arrived in Rome on 14 June. He died, after a short illness, on 14 January 1493 and was buried in the English hospice, of which he had been a member since 1475, chamberlain from 1476 to 1483, and where he had lived in some style from 1480 to 1486.<br>
<br>Shirwood's greatest fame lies in his being one of the earliest English humanists. His library, which he left at Bishop Auckland in 1492, and which was donated by his successor Bishop Richard Fox to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, was collected by him in England and Rome between 1461 and 1487. It contained over three dozen, mainly printed, works, predominantly of classical Roman authors, but also including some moderns. But more significantly he was one of the first Englishmen to learn Greek, possibly being taught first by Manuel of Constantinople, who dedicated a Greek text to George Neville in 1468, then by George Hermonymos in the early 1470s, and perfecting the language later in Rome. He reputedly owned Greek manuscripts which remained in store at Bishop Auckland and disappeared during the Reformation. His support for Greek exiles in England is well documented, extending to exhortation in 1471 to the no doubt bemused inhabitants of Richmondshire to contribute to a collection on behalf of Demetrius Rosato. Shirwood's only surviving writing, which reveals his polished Latin style, is a treatise on the game of <i>Arithmomachia</i>, a sophisticated variant of chess, which, so he states in his preface, he taught Archbishop Neville in 1475 during a visit to Calais.<br>
<br>Before his career under Neville took flight Shirwood was attracted to the Carthusian order, which he considered joining in 1458&#151;a leaning which suggests an outlook akin to that of later Christian humanists like John Colet and Sir Thomas More. His attention to his ecclesiastical duties in England was slight. He was for most of his career an absentee from Richmondshire and Durham; his monition to the clergy of Richmondshire in January 1471 against non-residence might perhaps cause modern eyebrows to rise. He left little mark on his diocese. He served three kings loyally as proctor in Rome, which probably says less about the fickleness of his political allegiance, and more about the solidarity and corporate spirit of the episcopate of his day, and an emerging sense of duty to the crown of England as distinct from the individual wearing it. Perhaps his other masters would have concurred with Richard III's recommendation of him to Sixtus IV in 1484 as one &#145;whose integrity of life, exceptional gentle manners together with the unparalleled virtue with which he is endowed, draw and attract our love to him&#146;  (Rymer, <span class="italic">Foedera</span>, 12.214).<br>
