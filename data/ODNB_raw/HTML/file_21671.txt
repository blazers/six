<span class="headword">Peacock,  Dmitri Rudolf</span>  (1842&#150;1892), <span class="occ">philologist</span>, was born on 26 September 1842 at the village of Shakhmanovka, district of Kozlov, in the government of Tambov, Russia, the son of Charles Peacock, estate manager, and his wife, Concordia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Schlegel. He was educated at a school in England, and afterwards at the University of Moscow. On 25 October 1881 he was appointed vice-consul at Batumi, which had become more important since its annexation by the Russians. He became consul on 27 January 1890. Travellers in the Caucasus found a warm welcome there.<br>
<br>Peacock probably owed his appointments to his familiarity with the Russian language: few foreigners were better acquainted with the languages and customs of the Caucasus mountain peoples, with whom he established such friendly relations that he was admitted into their remotest strongholds. His expeditions led to the publication of &#145;Original vocabularies of five west Caucasian languages&#146;&#151;Georgian, Mingrelian, Lazian, Svanetian, and Abkhazian  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</span>, 1877, 145&#150;56). Up to that time no contribution on these languages had appeared in English, and, unsurprisingly, it was not without errors. It was still considered an important enough work, however, to merit reprinting as a pamphlet in 1888, when the author's name was given as Demetrius R. Peacock.<br>
<br>On 14 October 1891 Peacock was appointed consul-general at Odessa, but had only been in residence a few weeks when he became ill, probably from Caucasian fever, the marshes which surrounded Batumi being very unhealthy. He died on 23 May 1892 at the Hotel de Londres, Odessa, and was buried in the British cemetery there. He left a widow, Tatyana, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bakunin, and three sons and three daughters; they were living in 1894 at Dyadino in Russia. Peacock was a man of rare attainments, but left little that showed his abilities. According to the <span class="italic">Levantine Herald</span>, as quoted by <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, he wrote a book on the Caucasus which was not approved by the Foreign Office. His widow promised to publish it, but it is not known whether it ever appeared.<br>
