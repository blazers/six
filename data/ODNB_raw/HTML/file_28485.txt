</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walker, Sir  George Townshend</span>, first baronet  (1764&#150;1842), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 25 May 1764, the eldest son of Major Nathaniel Walker (1740&#150;1780), who served in the Royal American rangers during the Anglo-American War, and Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 1829), only daughter and heir of Captain John Bagster RN, of West Cowes, Isle of Wight. His great-great-grandfather Sir Walter Walker, of Bushey Hall, Hertfordshire, was advocate to Catherine of Braganza, the wife of King Charles II.<br>
<br>By Queen Charlotte's wish Walker was commissioned ensign in the 95th foot on 4 March 1782; he became lieutenant on 13 March 1783, and on 22 June was transferred to the 71st, the 95th being disbanded. The 71st was also disbanded soon afterwards, and on 15 March 1784 he was transferred to the 36th. He joined it in India, and served with General (afterwards Sir Henry) Cosby's force against the Poligars in the neighbourhood of Tinnevelly in February 1786, in charge of the quartermaster-general's department. He was invalided home in 1787, and exchanged on 25 July to the 35th foot. In 1788 he was employed on the staff in Ireland as aide-de-camp to General Bruce. On 13 March 1789 he was made captain-lieutenant in the 14th foot, but, instead of making plans to join it in Jamaica, he obtained leave to go to Germany to study tactics and the German language.<br>
<br>On 4 May 1791 Walker obtained a company in the 60th, all the battalions of which were in America; but he seems to have remained at the depot. In 1793 he went to Flanders with a body of recruits who had volunteered for active service. He was present at the action of 10 May 1794 near Tournai, and was employed on various missions while serving in the quartermaster-general's department during the retreat of the duke of York's army. When the army embarked for England he was made an inspector of foreign corps, and was sent to the Black Forest and Switzerland to superintend the raising of Baron de Roll's regiment. After making arrangements for its passage through Italy and embarkation at Civitavecchia, he returned to England in August 1796.<br>
<br>Walker was promoted major in the 60th on 27 August. In March 1797 he went to Portugal and was aide-de-camp first to General Simon Fraser (<i>d</i>. 1777), and afterwards to the prince of Waldeck, who commanded the Anglo-Portuguese army; but ill health obliged him to go home in June. He was inspecting field officer of recruiting at Manchester from February 1798 until March 1799. He then joined the 50th in Portugal, having become lieutenant-colonel in that regiment on 6 September 1798; but in October he was summoned to the Netherlands to act as British commissioner with the Russian troops under the duke of York. He afterwards accompanied them to the Channel Islands, and so missed the campaign in Egypt, in which his regiment served. He took over the command of the 50th at Malta in October 1801, returned with it to Ireland in 1802, and served with it in the expedition to Copenhagen in 1807, being in Spencer's brigade of Baird's division.<br>
<br>In January 1808 he went with the 50th to the Peninsula, as part of Spencer's force. It was one of the regiments particularly mentioned by Sir Arthur Wellesley (later Viscount Wellington) in his report of the battle of Vimeiro. It formed part of Fane's brigade, which, with Anstruther's brigade and Robe's guns, occupied a hill in front of Vimeiro, and was attacked by a strong column under Laborde. The French had nearly reached the guns when Walker wheeled his right wing round to the left by companies, poured a volley into the flank of the column, charged it both in front and flank, and drove it in confusion down the hillside.<br>
<br>In the autumn Walker went to England. He returned with dispatches for Moore, but reached Corunna two days after the battle. He was made colonel in the army on 25 September 1808. In 1809 he served in the Walcheren expedition, at first in command of his regiment, and afterwards as brigadier.<br>
<br>In August 1810 Walker went back to the Peninsula with the rank of brigadier-general. He was employed for a year in the north of Spain, aiding and stimulating the authorities of Galicia and the Asturias to raise troops and take a more active part in the war. He had persuaded Lord Liverpool to let him take 3000 British troops to Santona, but the men were sent to Wellington after the latter had intervened. Finding that he could do no good with the Spaniards, and having become major-general on 4 June 1811, Walker applied to join the army in Portugal, and in October he was given command of a brigade in the 5th (Leith's) division.<br>
<br>At the storming of Badajoz, on the night of 6 April 1812, Walker's brigade was ordered to make a false attack on the San Vincente bastion, to be turned into a real attack if circumstances were favourable. After a confused action Walker forced his way along the ramparts, and captured three bastions. Then a sudden scare (fear of a mine, according to Napier) made the men turn, and they were chased back to the San Vincente bastion, where they rallied on a battalion in reserve. Walker was shot while trying to overcome this panic. The ball, fired by a man not two yards distant, struck the edge of a watch which he was wearing in his breast, turned downwards and passed out between his ribs, splintering one of them. He also received four bayonet wounds. He was taken care of for a time by a French soldier, whom he was afterwards able to repay. He was so weakened by loss of blood that his life was for some time in danger, and he had to remain three months at Badajoz before he could be sent home. His brigade had lost about half its effective strength, but its success had decided the fall of Badajoz. Wellington in his dispatch wrote of his conspicuous gallantry. On 24 October he was given the colonelcy of De Meuron's regiment, one of the &#145;foreign&#146; corps raised for garrison duties.<br>
<br>Walker was still suffering from his wounds when he returned to the Peninsula in June 1813. The army was in the Pyrenees, covering the blockade of Pamplona, when he joined it on 4 August at Ariscun, and was placed in command of the 1st brigade (50th, 71st, and 92nd regiments) of the 2nd (Stewart's) division. Stewart had been wounded in the action of Maya ten days before, and in his absence the division was commanded by Walker for a month. He was present at the battle of the Nivelle on 10 November, but his brigade, which had suffered very severely at Maya, was not actively engaged. Shortly afterwards he was given temporary command of the 7th (Lord Dalhousie's) division, which formed part of Beresford's corps. At the passage of the Nive and the actions near Bayonne (10&#150;13 December) this division was in second line. It helped to drive the French out of their works at Hastingues and Oeyergave on 23 February 1814. At Orthez, four days later, it was at first behind the 4th division, but it had a prominent share in the latter part of the battle, and in the pursuit. Walker was wounded while leading one of his brigades. He was mentioned in Wellington's dispatch, and was included in the thanks of parliament.<br>
<br>In March he reverted to his former brigade, but in the middle of that month his own wound and the recent death of his wife caused him to leave the army and return to England. He received the gold medal with two clasps for his services in the Peninsula, was made KCB in January 1815, and knight commander of the Portuguese order of the Tower and Sword in May.<br>
<br>Walker was governor of Grenada from 7 April 1815 to 17 February 1816. On 21 April 1817 he received the GCB. He was made a member of the consolidated board of general officers, and groom of the chamber to the duke of Sussex. On 19 July 1821 he was promoted lieutenant-general, and on 11 May 1825 he was appointed commander-in-chief at Madras. He took over that command on 3 March 1826, and held it until May 1831. On 28 March 1835 he was made a baronet, and received a grant of arms commemorating Vimeiro, Badajoz, and Orthez.<br>
<br>On 24 May 1837 Walker was appointed lieutenant-governor of Chelsea Hospital, and on 28 June 1838 he was promoted general. He had been made a colonel-commandant of the rifle brigade on 21 May 1816, De Meuron's regiment being disbanded in that year. He was transferred to the 84th regiment on 13 May 1820, to the 52nd on 19 September 1822, and, finally, to the 50th on 23 December 1839. He had married in July 1789, Anna (<i>d</i>. 15 Feb 1814), only daughter of Richard Allen of Bury, Lancashire; they had two daughters. On 15 August 1820 he married Helen (<i>d</i>. 23 Aug 1859), youngest daughter of Alexander Caldcleugh of Croydon, Surrey; they had four sons and two daughters. A handsome soldierly man, Walker died at Chelsea Hospital on 14 November 1842.<br>
