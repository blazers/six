<span class="headword">Weld, Sir  Frederick Aloysius</span>  (1823&#150;1891), <span class="occ">premier of New Zealand and colonial governor</span>, was born on 9 May 1823 at Chideock Manor, Bridport, Dorset. He came from a well-known Roman Catholic family, being the third son of Humphrey Weld of Chideock Manor, and his wife, Christina Maria, the second daughter of Charles Clifford, sixth Baron Clifford of Chudleigh. Following his education at Stonyhurst College and at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland, he sailed in November 1843 to join relatives already in the New Zealand Company settlement of Port Nicholson. In partnership with his cousin Charles Clifford, he established sheep stations in the Wairarapa (Wharekaka), Marlborough (Flaxbourne), and Canterbury (Stonyhurst) districts, and he drew on this practical experience to produce an informative pamphlet, <span class="italic">Hints to Intending Sheepfarmers in New Zealand</span>, which was published in London in 1851. Pastoralism and exploration were major preoccupations at this time of his life, and early in 1855 Weld succeeded in finding a shorter stock route between Nelson and Christchurch. His competence as an artist is revealed in the sketches and paintings that resulted from his explorations within the North and South Islands of New Zealand and his ascent of the active Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa in November 1855.<br>
<br>Weld was elected member for Wairau, and attended the first session of the New Zealand house of representatives, which opened in Auckland in May 1854. He was one of the three members chosen to serve in a ministry which sought, unsuccessfully, to expedite the transition from crown colony to responsible government status. Political involvement over the next five years was erratic, but in November 1860 Weld's fundamental belief in the need to assert the supremacy of British rule in New Zealand led him to accept the native affairs portfolio in the ministry of Edward Stafford. On 3 March 1859 he married Filumena (Mena) Mary Anne Lisle Phillipps (<i>d</i>. 1903) of Garendon Park, Leicester; the couple had six sons and seven daughters, all but one of whom survived to adulthood.<br>
<br>Following political defeat in July 1861, Weld concentrated on developing a 300-acre family estate at Brackenfield, north of Christchurch. He continued to deplore official handling of the armed conflict in Taranaki, advocating instead a policy of military self-reliance whereby the colonists would dispense with the imperial regiments and would conduct colonial campaigns using colonial resources. In November 1864, believing, unwisely, that he had secured Governor Sir George Grey's support for such a policy, the 41-year-old was sworn in as premier.<br>
<br>The prospects for success were inauspicious. Weld's personal reputation as a man of integrity was no match for Grey's duplicity. Prolonged wrangling between the governor and Lieutenant-General Duncan Cameron undermined all prospect of the colonists' military success against Maori, while the removal of the seat of government from Auckland to Wellington fuelled provincial hostilities. Confiscation of 1.2 million acres of Waikato land in December 1864 caused widespread bitterness and resentment among those tribes most affected. Financial difficulties, petty political wrangling, and lack of co-operation from the governor contributed to the strain of holding office. Utterly exhausted, Weld announced his resignation on 13 October 1865 and retreated to Brackenfield to recover his health. Later ministries were to build on the financial and military initiatives of the self-reliance advocates, but the destructive legacy of confiscation persists to the present, a legacy which Weld did not acknowledge when reviewing political developments in his pamphlet <span class="italic">Notes on New Zealand Affairs</span> published in London in 1869.<br>
<br>The Welds returned to England in 1867. In December 1868, his health restored, Weld approached the Colonial Office seeking employment, a request favourably received and promptly actioned, for in May 1869, with his wife and their family of six children, he departed England for Western Australia and the start of an eighteen-year career as a colonial governor.<br>
<br>Once in the colony, Weld moved quickly to establish the style of energetic and active administration that was to be his hallmark. He promoted such public works as the inauguration of a coastal shipping service and the extension of telegraph lines; he facilitated the expansion of the timber industry; and fostered the farming sector through his introduction in 1873 of the Torrens system of land registration. He presided over the introduction of an elective element into the legislative council in December 1870; and he encouraged settler participation in local self-government through membership of school and roads boards and other municipal institutions. Eventually in 1871, but only after heated debate, he achieved his goal of an elementary education act, which included the principle of state aid to denominational schools. Although Weld displayed significant errors of judgement both in his handling of the controversial Landor&#150;Burges affair of 1872&#150;3, which involved a white settler facing criminal charges for the shooting of an Aborigine, and with his precipitate advocacy of responsible government in 1874, his achievements in Western Australia were substantial. He was created CMG for services rendered and promoted to the self-governing colony of Tasmania at the end of 1874, taking up the position early the next year.<br>
<br>Political factionalism and personal financial difficulties marred Weld's enjoyment of an otherwise pleasant and successful term of office in Tasmania. The intense personal antipathy between the chief justice and the premier affected Weld most directly when he acted on ministerial advice to pardon a convicted arsonist in November 1876. His conduct throughout the subsequent two-year controversy was upheld by the Colonial Office, but Weld was constantly irritated by the Tasmanians' reluctance to address more substantial issues&#151;provision for meeting imperial self-defence requirements especially. In personal terms the Welds paid a high price for the Tasmania interlude, for official economies in 1872 had significantly reduced the level of the governor's salary and abolished all allowances. Weld's difficulties in meeting official expenses while maintaining a household of twelve children were exacerbated when his aide-de-camp incurred substantial debts by misusing the governor's household account. Weld had therefore to sell Brackenfield and to draw heavily on personal income in an effort to cover the costs of his Tasmanian term of office.<br>
<br>Weld was promoted to the Straits Settlements, in March 1880, at a time when the possible extension of British influence in the Malay peninsula was under review, and he relished the return to a more active style of governorship. He made sustained efforts to resolve land-tenure problems, fostered improved communications and public services, supported the construction of a new museum and library at Singapore, and promoted effective management of the country's timber resources. His primary interest, though, was the consolidation of relations with the princely states, and by the end of his term of office he was able to record progress in Perak, Selangor, Sungei Ujong, and the states of the Negri Sembilan and Rembau, while new accords with the rulers of Johore and Pahang led to closer administrative links between Malay and British authorities. Weld had nevertheless annoyed the Foreign Office by his persistent suggestions for undermining Siamese influence in the northern part of the peninsula and by his independent actions when sent, in 1887, on a mission to Borneo to resolve the rival claims of Sarawak and the British North Borneo Company.<br>
<br>Weld was made KCMG in 1880 and GCMG in 1885. He retired on a first-class pension in October 1887, and he returned with his family to England, to Chideock Manor, where on 20 July 1891 he died of illnesses contracted during a visit to the Straits Settlements in his capacity as a director of the Pahang Exploration and Development Company. A man of ability, culture, and deep faith, straightforward and chivalrous but occasionally lacking in judgement, Weld had a lifelong devotion to the cause of empire.<br>
