<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wallace,  (Charles) William <span class="st"> [Bill]</span></span>  (1855&#150;1916), <span class="occ">oil industrialist</span>, was born in Calcutta on 21 November 1855, the elder son of Alexander Wallace, an East India merchant, and his wife, Helen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davidson. He was educated at Framlingham College, Suffolk (<i>c</i>.1866&#150;1874), and in 1874 joined a Calcutta mercantile firm (not his father's). He rose rapidly in that business, helping to sort out its chaotic accounts, and in 1886 he refounded it as Shaw, Wallace &amp; Co. In 1881 he married Ellen Charlotte, daughter of Captain George Fulton of the Royal Engineers, a veteran of the siege of Lucknow in 1857; they had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>One of the agencies held by Shaw Wallace was for marketing kerosene in India for the Burmah Oil Company. When in 1892 Wallace returned to London, he found himself helping out in the nearby London office of Burmah Oil, of which he became a director in 1902. There he assisted the chairman, John Cargill, who was based in Glasgow, over negotiating with the Admiralty an agreement, signed in 1905, to supply fuel oil from Rangoon.<br>
<br>Cargill and Wallace, aided by the company's consultant, Sir Boverton Redwood, jointly agreed to buy for Burmah Oil some Persian oil concessions from William Knox D'Arcy; Wallace thereafter maintained contacts with government departments in London. Despite bouts of severe liver disorder, Wallace agreed to become vice-chairman and managing director of a new firm, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, set up in 1909 after oil had been discovered in Persia. His chairman was the aged imperialist Donald Alexander Smith, first Baron Strathcona. Wallace's executive assistant, and successor as managing director in 1910, was Charles Greenway, a former employee in Shaw Wallace.<br>
<br>From 1912 onwards, Greenway attempted to persuade the British government to purchase a majority stake in Anglo-Persian, and this was finally agreed in 1914. These negotiations, which involved a number of government departments, were protracted and arduous. Wallace monitored every move taken by Greenway, but remained largely in the background, emerging only when Greenway needed powerful support.<br>
<br>Wallace possessed the intellectual capacity and the vision to have become one of the country's outstanding oil entrepreneurs of his day. As an old India hand, he grasped the immense economic and strategic advantages to Britain of a presence in Persia, to forestall Russian expansionist designs on Britain's route to the east. However, he exercised his talents mainly behind the scenes, partly because of illness; yet he would not have been happy as a high-profile tycoon. His influence sprang from a thorough knowledge of commercial conditions in the East and from his patent integrity and reliable judgement. The latter was not infallible, however, as he thought that the allies were going to lose the First World War; and he could be crusty, sceptical, and outspoken to a fault. His marriage ended in separation, but he got on well with his children and was devastated by the death of his younger son in action. A human touch was his legacy to a daughter's friend, Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies, to help her in what later became an acting career of distinction.<br>
<br>Equally human were Wallace's idiosyncrasies, such as his rule in Shaw Wallace that no one could be appointed who was related to those already in the firm. Again, believing that wealth acquired from the people should be appropriately returned, he bequeathed the residue of his &pound;125,966 estate to the treasuries of Britain and India. In 1977 the British exchequer received from this source &pound;1 million, and the governments of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Burma shared in a further &pound;1 million. Wallace had no particular interests outside his work, apart from recreational travel in company with one or more of his daughters. Had he been a more contented man, his achievements might have been less considerable.<br>
<br>On Strathcona's death in 1914, Wallace's reputation in Whitehall was so high that he was officially recommended to be chairman of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. He declined because of poor health; a year later he had to give up all business commitments. By the time of his death he had lost his sight; he died of kidney failure on 2 August 1916 at his London home, 76 Avenue Road, St John's Wood.<br>
