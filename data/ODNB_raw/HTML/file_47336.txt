<span class="headword">King,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1614, <em>d.</em> 1681), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was baptized Joannes Regius in the Dutch church at Austin Friars, London, on 11 September 1614, the first of six children of the Revd Joannes Regius (1574&#150;1627), a minister of that church, and his second wife, Johanna. His father's family were pillars of the Flemish Reformed church, his grandfather Jacobus Regius having been a minister of the London Dutch church from 1572 until 1601. King's father studied divinity at Leiden and Heidelberg, where he took his degree in theology in 1595. He was a staunch defender of orthodox Calvinism against the heresies of Servetus and Arminius. Persecuted for their religion in the Netherlands, the Regius family took refuge in London. In 1601 Joannes Regius succeeded his father as a minister of the Dutch church at Austin Friars, where he remained until his death in 1627. Between 1604 and 1625 he had eleven children, of whom four survived him. Among these was John King, the only one of six children of the Revd Regius's second wife to survive infancy. At least some of these children died in the London plague of 1625. King's father died of the stone in 1627 and under his father's will he received &pound;360.<br>
<br>In 1633 King began his medical education at Leiden. After five years he earned his MD, his thesis being on the subject of fevers, and returned to London. He incorporated on his Leiden degree at the University of Oxford on 14 January 1641. King was proposed by the president of the College of Physicians, Othowell Meverell, for election to the college on 22 December 1643 and was approved &#145;by a majority of the votes&#146;  (annals, RCP Lond., bk 3.4). It was not until 1648, however, that he was able to fill a vacant fellowship.<br>
<br>On 6 April 1643 King married, in the London Dutch church, Joanna Marolois, the widow of Jacob de Backer. On 13 December 1643 King was nominated for a deaconship in the Dutch church. He was not elected. In the same year he and his wife were to be found in the parish of St Olave Jewry, where, of seventy-one ratepayers King was assessed as the tenth wealthiest. A parliamentary assessment of April 1643 rated King's household seventeenth out of a total of sixty-four assessed. King aligned himself with the parliamentary cause when he signed the solemn league and covenant on 2 October 1643. In 1644 he was assessed by a parliamentary committee raising money to fight Charles I at &pound;100, indicating that he was not among the top rank of physicians, who were assessed at &pound;250.<br>
<br>King had three daughters and two sons. At least two of his daughters were baptized in both the English and the Dutch church, showing that King was concerned about maintaining good relations with both communities. King was formally elected to the long-awaited fellowship in the College of Physicians on 9 August 1648. On 25 September 1648 King subscribed to the relief of the Dutch church in Colchester, where civil war still raged. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the eldership of the Dutch church on five separate occasions between 1652 and 1659. As a fellow of the College of Physicians, King attended at least one college meeting a year from 1648 to 1674. He was elected a censor of the college in 1651, 1659, and 1661. From 25 June 1651 to 1654 King and George Ent had charge of the college library. To mark the end of his stewardship, King presented the college with the four volumes of the <span class="italic">Historiae naturalis</span> by the Polish physician Joannes Jonstonus. Between 1675 and 1679 he was absent from college proceedings. None the less, in 1680, he was made an elect.<br>
<br>King died from jaundice at his house in Austin Friars on 28 October 1681. He was buried six days later in the parish church of St Peter-le-Poer, where his father was also buried. In his will King left &#145;all my East Indian Actions in the Chambre of Amsterdam&#146;, &pound;100 sterling, &#145;and also my Studie of Books&#146; to his eldest son, <a href="#cosubject_57277">John King [<i>see below</i>]</a>. To his other son, James King (&#145;who is now at Surat in the East Indies, and well settled there&#146;), he left another &pound;100. The rest of his estate was to be shared by his surviving daughters, Mary Philipps and Hester King, but with a special provision for Hester who &#145;is verie weak impotent and infirme by reason of a melancholick Distemp[er] upon her, and thereby is disabled to helpe or mainteyne herself&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/368, sig. 166). John King left no publications beyond his Leiden thesis of 1638. He does, however, represent the presence of London's Anglo-Dutch community in the seventeenth-century medical profession.<br>
<br>King has in the past been confused with other individuals. Among these was another physician, John King (1604&#150;1688), who also took an MD at Leiden and was also the father of a John King, in this instance the lawyer Sir John King (1639&#150;1677). Munk's <span class="italic">Roll of the Royal College of Physicians</span> conflates the lives of these two John Kings.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_57277"></a><span class="headword">John King</span>  (<em>b. </em>1648, <em>d.</em> in or after 1686), the eldest son of John King, was born in London on 5 June 1648 and was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School. He was admitted a pensioner at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 21 June 1666. From 1667 to 1671 he was a scholar at Caius. He received an MB from the university on 26 November 1670, and was admitted to Leiden, probably on 20 May 1671. Through the influence of Sir Andrew King he became <span class="occ">university professor</span> at Gresham College, London, on 2 October 1676. In the following month, on 30 November 1676, he also became a fellow of the Royal Society, proposed by Abraham Hill, a founding member of that society. King remained professor at Gresham until his resignation on 20 August 1686.<br>
