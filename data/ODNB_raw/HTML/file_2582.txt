<span class="headword">Blake,  Robert</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1598, <em>d.</em> 1657), <span class="occ">naval and army officer</span>, was baptized on 27 September 1598 at the church of St Mary the Virgin in Bridgwater, Somerset, the eldest of the eight surviving children of Humphrey Blake (<i>d</i>. 1625), a merchant of the town, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1638), daughter of Humphrey Williams of Plainsfield near Bridgwater. Educated at the free grammar school, Bridgwater, he was admitted to the University of Oxford, studying at St Alban Hall and Wadham College. He graduated on 10 February 1618. Shortly afterwards he stood unsuccessfully for election as a fellow of Merton College.<h2>
<a name="Earlylife"></a>Early life</h2>On the death of his father in 1625 Blake inherited the manor of Crandon-cum-Puriton. He bought a house in Bridgwater and his name appears in the subsidy list for 1628. Some time between 1629 and 1632 he left Bridgwater, and may have become a merchant and travelled on the continent. There is a story that he lived in Schiedam, so he could be the Robert Blake who was admitted to the Company of the Freemen of Dorchester in 1629 and who was trading in masts, deal, and other timber with Schiedam's neighbouring port of Middleburg.<br>
<br>Blake was elected to the Short Parliament in April 1640 as one of the two burgesses for Bridgwater, but failed to keep his seat in elections for the Long Parliament which met in November the same year. He was a strong supporter of the parliament during the first civil war. In March 1643 a plot was formed to admit the royalists to the city of Bristol, which was only thwarted at the last minute. Blake was among those who signed the decree sentencing the plotters to death. When William Waller marched into the west Blake is reputed to have raised a troop of horse and it may well have formed part of the cavalry commanded by Colonel Edward Popham which made a foray against Bridgwater in May. By the time Prince Rupert laid siege to Bristol on 23 July, Blake was the commander of Prior's Hill Fort and repelled all the royalist attempts to storm it. He was still resisting when the parliamentarian governor agreed terms surrendering the city four days later.<br>
<br>Blake next appears at the siege of Lyme Regis in April 1644. He was never the official commander of the garrison but he was, by common consent, the mainspring of the resistance. The royalists outnumbered the defenders by six to one but they failed to make their advantage tell. Lyme was eventually relieved by an army under the earl of Essex. Subsequently Blake was appointed governor of Taunton. After Essex's defeat at Lostwithiel and the indecisive second battle of Newbury, Blake was left isolated and endured three sieges&#151;between October and December 1644, between March and May 1645, and briefly again in June 1645. The successful resistance in the second one in particular made him famous throughout the country and brought him to the attention of the army leaders. In October 1645 Blake and Colonel William Sydenham were sent with 600 men to lay siege to Dunster Castle. Here Blake got a taste of his own medicine. The castle resisted all his attempts to capture it and only surrendered on terms in April 1646 when the royalist cause was lost.<br>
<br>In September 1645 Blake was elected as a &#145;Recruiter&#146; MP for Bridgwater. He was also on the Somerset county committee, where his chief concern was the establishment of a presbyterian system of ministers and lay elders within the county. When it finally came into being in March 1648 Blake figured as a lay elder in the Taunton classis. While Blake did not like the Church of England he did not much care for the sects either and suppressed an Independent meeting-house in St Mary Street, Taunton, but by this time he was a republican and opposed to any compromise with the royalists. Taunton was one of the first places to support the vote of no addresses of January 1648, by which the MPs pledged themselves never to negotiate with Charles again. No fighting took place in Somerset during the second civil war but Alexander Popham seems to have been convinced that a rising was imminent. Blake had ceased to be governor of Taunton in September 1647, as part of the programme for the reduction of unnecessary garrisons, but Popham had him reappointed in August 1648. He was back in London in early November but took no part in Pride's Purge or the trial and execution of the king.<h2>
<a name="TheCommonwealth16491651"></a>The Commonwealth, 1649&#150;1651</h2>In March 1649 the new Commonwealth government appointed three generals-at-sea. Their qualifications for command were to be that they were loyal to the new regime and that they had good military records. Previous naval experience was of small importance as the commander usually consulted his council of officers when he needed navigational advice. The first appointment was that of Richard Deane. He appears to have recommended Blake, who in turn suggested Edward Popham. The first priority, to re-establish order and discipline, which had been badly dented by the mutiny of 1648, was effected smoothly and rapidly. On 21 May the Commonwealth fleet appeared off Kinsale to find a squadron of royalist ships, commanded by Prince Rupert, inside. After drawing lots Popham returned to the Downs. Deane was assigned the task of organizing the transport of Cromwell's army, designed for the reconquest of Ireland, from Milford. Blake was left off Kinsale to watch Rupert.<br>
<br>Cromwell's original intention was to land in Munster but when winds proved consistently contrary the army made for Dublin instead, leaving Blake to a very lonely vigil. All summer Blake kept Rupert penned in the harbour, unable to interfere with the movement of troops from England to Ireland. In September 1649 Cromwell offered Blake the post of major-general of foot in the Irish army but Blake preferred to stay with the fleet. While his political masters were pleased with his performance Blake was not. Just when it looked as if the parliamentarian army would capture the whole royalist fleet, a storm blew Blake off his station and Rupert escaped.<br>
<br>Rupert was no longer a military threat but his attacks on English merchant shipping from his new base in Portugal were costly and embarrassing. In March 1650 Blake was dispatched with a squadron of eleven ships to deal with him. When the king of Portugal refused to expel Rupert, Blake attempted to force his way up the Tagus but he had to retreat, the fire from the forts at the river mouth being far too strong for wooden ships to endure successfully. Faced with the prospect of a long blockade Blake was compelled to change tack. A request was made to King Jo&atilde;o IV that the English fleet be allowed to water in Oeiras Bay, to which he agreed on condition that no attack was made on Rupert while he was in Portuguese waters. The nearest Spanish port where he could water was Cadiz so, fearing a repeat of the Kinsale escape, Blake reluctantly accepted the limitation.<br>
<br>On 26 May Popham arrived with eight more ships and orders instructing both generals to seize Rupert's ships wherever they might be found, which obliged Blake to abandon his agreement with King Jo&atilde;o. In reprisal the king arrested the goods and property of the English merchants in Lisbon and expelled Charles Vane, the Commonwealth agent. Rupert's presence was an embarrassment to Portugal, especially as the blockading fleet was now seizing any ships attempting to enter the Tagus, and Jo&atilde;o tried to push the prince into leaving, but Popham and Blake combined gave the royalists little hope of getting away. Twice Jo&atilde;o persuaded Rupert to try, each time while part of the parliamentarian fleet was watering at Cadiz. The first attempt was on 22 June but the royalists and their Portuguese and French allies hardly got beyond the Catchops shoals before the powerful Commonwealth ships sent them scuttling back to the Tagus. The second was on 3 September during foggy weather while Popham was away watering, preparatory to returning to England. This time the determination of Blake not to be faced down when his flagship, the <i>George</i>, encountered Rupert in the <span class="italic">Constant Reformation</span>, was enough to persuade the royalists to seek the shelter of Lisbon once more.<br>
<br>The English did not get what they wanted until Popham had left and Blake had given up the close blockade as pointless. Returning from a short cruise in search of French privateers Blake learned that Rupert had left Cadiz. The English pursued his squadron into the Mediterranean, coming up with the royalists just short of Cartagena. One ship was captured and a second forced on shore, the remaining four taking refuge in Cartagena harbour. The Spanish government did not prove as accommodating as that of Portugal. Rather than have their ships and goods seized, the royalists decided to make a run for it on the night of 6&#150;7 November, but they had little knowledge of Cartagena harbour and all four vessels were wrecked. Neither Rupert nor his brother Maurice were present but the destruction of most of their ships had the result of reducing them to naval insignificance.<br>
<br>In spring 1651 Blake was appointed to command a small squadron designed to capture the Isle of Man but before he could sail he was redirected to the Isles of Scilly. The Commonwealth government, fearing a pre-emptive strike by the Dutch, wanted immediate action. Blake's own small force was augmented by the diversion of the squadron under Sir George Ayscue, designed for the recapture of Barbados. Blake quickly grasped that the key to success was the island of Tresco. The first attack was mismanaged by the landing party but a second one was more successful. The island was quickly occupied and two small royalist frigates captured. The surrender of the main island of St Mary's soon followed. The terms were very lenient&#151;there were no reprisals against the islanders and for those royalists who wished for it transport was provided to take them wherever they wanted to go.<br>
<br>By the summer the war with Scotland was reaching crisis point. Cromwell ordered Major-General John Disbrowe into the midlands and Blake came on shore to replace him as the chief officer commanding the west of England, but at the crucial moment news arrived of Popham's death. As Deane was already with the army Blake was the only one of the original three generals-at-sea still active so he was instructed to return to the fleet.<br>
<br>The last action of the year was the reduction of Jersey. This Blake accomplished with his now customary efficiency. He first of all exhausted the defenders by cruising up and down the west coast and round the Corbi&egrave;re Rocks, forcing them to anticipate where he was going to strike by marching parallel to the fleet. Then, night having fallen, an amphibious descent was organized just after high tide when the tired royalists thought that the immediate danger had passed. Once ashore the result was a foregone conclusion.<h2>
<a name="TheFirstAngloDutchWar16521654"></a>The First Anglo-Dutch War, 1652&#150;1654</h2>By this time relations with the Dutch had deteriorated so much that war seemed only just over the horizon. The immediate pretext was the English demand that all Dutch ships should strike their flags when in the presence of an English warship and submit to search for contraband of war. In March 1652 the Dutch dispatched a squadron into the channel under Lieutenant-Admiral Tromp to protect incoming Dutch merchant shipping and prevent searches. At first Tromp avoided the small squadrons of Blake and Nehemiah Bourne to prevent arguments about striking the flag but then he received information which led him to believe that the English had stopped and were searching a Dutch merchant fleet off Fairlight. He altered course right into the path of Blake's ships. When Blake fired shots across his bow to try and force him to strike his flag, the Dutchman replied with a broadside and a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e ensued which has become known as the skirmish off Dover. Tromp's squadron numbered forty-two. Blake had no more than twelve ships with him and even when Bourne joined in the English were never more than half the Dutch strength. Despite this the English lost no ships; they captured one Dutchman and another was so badly damaged that only the superior Dutch seamanship prevented it from falling into English hands.<br>
<br>The English were eager to force the Dutch to fight pitched battles which they now knew they could win. Blake was dispatched with a fleet of over eighty ships to the Shetland Islands to intercept the Dutch East India fleet, which was reported to be coming home &#145;north about&#146;. This was a challenge the Dutch could not turn down and Tromp was sent after him, only for both fleets to be caught in a terrible storm on 25&#150;7 July. The English were able to take shelter in Bressay Sound so their fleet, though battered, remained intact. There was no refuge for the Dutch caught off a hostile lee shore. When the weather let up after three days of continuous rain and gale force wind Tromp found that he had only thirty-four ships in company out of a fleet of over 100. Most of the others found some sort of shelter away from the main settlements but six foundered at sea and ten were wrecked. Blake had won a major victory without raising a finger. Ironically seven of the nine East Indiamen successfully rendezvoused with the now much depleted Dutch fleet.<br>
<br>Both fleets returned southwards to find that events in the channel had been much more favourable to the Dutch. A Dutch squadron under Commodore de Ruijter, escorting a merchant convoy, had encountered an English one under Ayscue off Plymouth. The English fought bravely but Ayscue adopted the old charge tactics, which proved inadequate, suggesting that more than superior morale and gunnery were required if complete success were to be achieved over the more experienced and skilful Dutch&#151;a lesson which the winter campaign was to drive home.<br>
<br>By this time Blake was back in the Downs. For the moment the Dutch were impotent. Blake took advantage of the respite to attack a French convoy designed for the relief of Dunkirk in retaliation for the way Mazarin had allowed royalists to sell their prizes in French ports. The result was the surrender of Dunkirk to its Spanish besiegers. Then, mustering all his available force, Blake set off down the channel to try and waylay de Ruijter's returning convoy. He sent on ahead a strong force of the speediest and most weatherly third- and fourth-rate frigates under the command of William Penn, which was to seek out de Ruijter and hold him until Blake could come up with the remainder of the fleet. Penn came in sight of de Ruijter's squadron off Berry Head and went in pursuit but lost it in worsening visibility and approaching darkness. Neither Penn nor Blake saw it again. Sure now that the English were off their own coast, de Ruijter took his fleet over to the French side and got home without trouble. The ease with which Blake had been fooled again suggested that the war might not be as plain sailing as the skirmish off Dover and the Shetland voyage seemed to presage.<br>
<br>As trade was the lifeblood of the Dutch the English stranglehold had to be broken. Tromp was now out of favour and after much dispute a fleet was organized with Cornelis Witte de With, the vice-admiral of Holland, in command, assisted by de Ruijter. As soon as Blake knew the Dutch were at sea his only thought was for a battle. The English ships got under way with all speed and rushed out of the Downs northwards as fast as they could with little regard for order, so much so that Rear-Admiral Bourne's division got left behind. When the English appeared, on 28 September, the Dutch were sailing westward. De With immediately ordered a change of course to SSE with the aim of sailing right past Blake and Penn's squadrons to attack Bourne, who was still trying to get his ships clear of the Downs. The plan was thwarted by an accident. The two leading ships of Penn's squadron, the <i>Sovereign of the Seas</i> and the <i>James</i>, went aground on a shoal called the Kentish Knock. Neither was seriously damaged but the incident had the effect of halting the English charge and forcing them to turn east straight into the path of the oncoming Dutch. The result was a violent m&ecirc;l&eacute;e out of which the English emerged triumphant partly because of their superior firepower and partly because many Dutch captains had no stomach for the fight. The Dutch lost only one ship sunk and one captured but there would have been many more had darkness not fallen before the English could exploit their victory, because the whole fleet had been badly mauled. So much so that all de With's attempts to get the captains to re-engage the next day failed. Even de Ruijter thought such a course would be suicide.<br>
<br>The euphoria induced by the result of Kentish Knock led the Commonwealth to make a serious error. The campaign had been very costly and, believing there would be no further fighting until the spring, a large part of the main fleet was stood down. On the Dutch side Tromp was reinstated because he was the only man who commanded sufficient respect to calm the factious behaviour of the other senior officers. The Dutch had to keep their trade flowing and over 400 merchant ships were awaiting convoy, so Tromp decided on a winter campaign as the only way that they could be got through the channel safely. Blake was in the Downs with forty-two ships but he made no move until Tromp's fleet of eighty-eight men-of-war was approaching the entrance to the channel. A council of war recommended that they sit tight but such was not Blake's way and the English fleet was soon heading south out of the Downs parallel to the Dutch. At first shoals prevented an engagement but once the Varne, the last of these, had been left behind, soon after noon on 30 November, Tromp closed with the English and a violent conflict began between the leading ships of the two fleets. The English, unable to manoeuvre because of the proximity of Dungeness, got much the worst of it. Two English ships, the <i>Garland</i> and the <i>Anthony Bonadventure</i>, were captured in the fighting and a third, the <i>Hercules</i>, was lost when she sailed into the Dutch fleet on her way from Portsmouth to the Downs. The Dutch suffered only one casualty when an accidental spark fired the magazine of Captain Juynbol's ship. The English recoiled on Dover and a major disaster might have occurred if Tromp had followed up his advantage but he regarded escorting the merchant ships to their destinations safely as his main task. When his ships disappeared over the horizon the English heaved a great sigh of relief.<br>
<br>The main reason for the defeat was the failure of the Commonwealth to maintain an adequate fleet. The government was quick to accept its share of responsibility and refused Blake's offer to resign. Yet Blake was not free from blame, rushing into battle with scant regard for the tactical situation, though he himself refused to accept this as the crucial factor. For him the defeat was caused by the failure of a number of his captains to support him properly. His determination to make them do exactly as he wanted, regardless of the cost, runs like a refrain throughout the war. After the skirmish off Dover captains Charles Thorowgood and John Gibbs were dismissed for, allegedly, keeping their ships out of the action. Thorowgood was the senior captain in the fleet. Blake conducted a running battle with another, John Taylor, who had been his flag captain in the Scilly campaign and was now one of those who incurred his wrath after Dungeness, together with four others, among them another distinguished captain, Anthony Young. Most extraordinary of all was his quarrel with his brother Benjamin. As Benjamin was his flag captain at the time his sin must have been to stand up for the others. Many of the ships appear to have been short of ammunition and the captains were angry at the way Blake rode roughshod over the council of war. The government supported Blake, as it had to, issuing a new set of thirty-nine articles of war which made the authority of the commander-in-chief paramount and provided severe punishments for any subordinate who failed to carry out the orders of a superior officer. But all the captains, except one, were later quietly reinstated, though their promotion prospects were irretrievably damaged.<br>
<br>Deane, who had gone on shore to serve in the Scottish campaign, was sent back to sea and Monck was appointed to succeed Popham. Blake welcomed them. While the war had been progressing favourably he was quite happy to command alone but when the prospects darkened he was unwilling to be made the scapegoat. The determination of the government to repair the situation, combined with the influence of Deane, brought more order and method into the conduct of the fleet which was now divided into three squadrons&#151;the red, blue, and white&#151;each with its admiral, vice-admiral, and rear-admiral.<br>
<br>A refurbished fleet of sixty to seventy ships put to sea to prevent Tromp's return. On 18 February 1653 advanced elements of the English fleet spotted the Dutch off Start Point. To begin with the Dutch had a decided advantage. In order to prevent Tromp slipping past, as de Ruijter had done, the English fleet was strung out across the channel. Tromp on the other hand had all his ships well in hand, and the weather gauge. He attacked immediately. The result was that the Blue squadron, commanded by the vice-admiral, William Penn, and leading elements of the Red squadron, among them the <i>Triumph</i>, which had Blake and Deane on board, bore the entire brunt of the initial Dutch assault. For over an hour the battle raged south of Portland Bill, over the decks of Penn's squadron and around the little group of ships with the <i>Triumph</i>. Blake's flag captain, Andrew Ball, and his secretary were both killed, and Blake himself was seriously wounded in the thigh. The battle began to swing the English way when the rear-admiral, John Lawson, managed to bring the remainder of the Red squadron into the fray. The White squadron, commanded by Monck, had been far away to leeward and took some time to come into play. When it finally did so Tromp was obliged to break off the action for fear that the English frigates would get among his convoy.<br>
<br>For the next two days the English harried the Dutch up the channel until, on the evening of 20 February, they were forced to seek sanctuary under the cliffs of Cap Gris Nez. The English prepared to administer the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> the next morning but when day dawned the Dutch were nowhere to be seen. They had used the shallow draught of their ships to escape over the shoals around the cape. The English claimed that seventeen Dutch men-of-war and forty merchant ships had been either sunk or captured. The Dutch only admitted to twelve but even that showed that the English had achieved a major victory. Yet once again English inexperience had let the Dutch off the hook.<br>
<br>Blake continued to exercise command as a general-at-sea throughout the battle despite his wound, but he seems to have caught a severe cold which turned to a fever and forced him to go on shore. He was ill during March and April and then went to London where he organized a new squadron designed to reinforce the fleet. Meanwhile Deane and Monck had sailed into the North Sea where Tromp once more attempted to contest the English supremacy. The battle of the Gabbard was a stunning victory for the English. The Dutch lost twenty men-of-war and the rest were so badly battered that they were forced to seek the protection of the shoals. The only real casualty on the English side was Richard Deane, killed at the outset of the battle. Blake's squadron did not get to sea early enough to take part but his appearance completed the Dutch rout. The pressures of life at sea brought a recurrence of his illness and he was forced to go on shore once again. During July he was so ill that his life was despaired of. He then made a slow recovery but he missed the final victory at Scheveningen, in which Tromp was killed, and did not return to duty until October.<br>
<br>The crisis of the war had been marked by a prolonged political upheaval. In April 1653 Cromwell had forcibly dissolved what remained of the Long Parliament. After an unsatisfactory experiment with Barebone's Parliament during 1653 Cromwell took power himself in December, as lord protector. He had never liked the war with the United Provinces and the Dutch were unwilling to face another summer campaign, so peace was concluded in spring 1654.<h2>
<a name="TheMediterraneanandtheSpanishwar16541657"></a>The Mediterranean and the Spanish war, 1654&#150;1657</h2>Blake accepted the new protectorate and was appointed to command a powerful fleet destined for the Mediterranean. The long cruise which ensued had three main phases. The French were planning an attack on Spanish-controlled Naples. A fleet was to sail from Toulon, escorting the troop transports. Blake carried instructions to thwart the intended invasion if he could. When he reached the Strait of Gibraltar he found himself in a dilemma. He received information that the French Brest squadron was intending to sail for the Mediterranean to reinforce the Toulon fleet, picking up four Portuguese warships on the way. He waited a vital three weeks off the strait until he heard that the French had taken refuge in Lisbon and had no intention of stirring so long as he was anywhere around. The result was that when he finally reached Naples on 12 December 1654 he found that the action was all over. The 8000 French, under the duc de Guise, arrived at the beginning of November. After two unsuccessful attempts to storm the city, they retired discomfited on 7 December. Had Blake not delayed in the strait the French expedition would have been destroyed completely.<br>
<br>Another part of Blake's instructions related to the corsairs of Tunis. The English claimed that the Tunisians had broken an agreement of 1646 by seizing a merchant ship called the <i>Princess</i>. Blake was to demand the ship's return and compensation for the merchants concerned. In February 1655 Blake sailed to Tunis but the negotiations soon reached an impasse. The dey claimed that the ship had been seized in reprisal for the action of a Captain Mitchell who had sold into slavery a group of Turkish soldiers he was supposed to be transporting to Malta. Blake contemplated offensive action but the harbour of Tunis was too well defended and there was no trade to attack. He inspected the more open roadstead at Porto Farina where the <i>Princess</i> and eight frigates lay at anchor. As he was closely watched by the dey's army Blake took no action and the English sailed away to Sicily for supplies. A second round of negotiations in March also proved fruitless because the dey was now confident that there was nothing Blake could do. His belief was reinforced when the English fleet disappeared over the horizon for a second time.<br>
<br>He was soon undeceived. Blake had sounded Porto Farina harbour earlier and he reappeared there suddenly on 2 April. Using the early-morning land breeze the third- and fourth-rate frigates sailed in, covered by the larger ships which bombarded the forts. All nine ships in the roadstead were destroyed and the English ships warped out again without any loss. The successful action made no difference. As Blake well knew the frigates were Turkish ones destined for the attack on Venetian Candia (Crete) and not the property of the dey.<br>
<br>By the time Blake sailed away from Tunis Cromwell had practically finalized the details of an alliance with France and a war with Spain was imminent. An expedition under William Penn had already sailed to attack the Spanish West Indies. Additional orders were sent to Blake to prevent any reinforcements reaching there from Spain so he returned to the Atlantic, posting his fleet off Cadiz. On 16 August 1655 the English fleet came in sight of the Spanish battle fleet. Blake's immediate instinct was to engage but the seas were running high, making it impossible to use the lower tier of guns, so he held away. During the delay he had second thoughts. There had been no declaration of war and he was informed that the Spaniards only intended to escort home the plate fleet. As they were not going to the West Indies he believed that his instructions did not entitle him to begin hostilities and he let them go.<br>
<br>The fleet reached the Downs at the beginning of October 1655, having apparently failed in all its aims. Blake was too late to be of use at Naples. He got no concessions out of the dey and the destruction of the Turkish ships only delayed the capture of Candia (Crete). Cromwell was dismayed by Blake's decision not to attack the Spanish fleet, though he admitted that his instructions were ambiguous. Yet the expedition was seen by everyone as momentous. Blake's presence effectually ruptured French schemes of Mediterranean dominance and forced Mazarin to accept an alliance with England on Cromwell's terms. Tunis may have got away with it but the strength and bellicosity of the English fleet led Algiers to make an agreement and England became a major player in Mediterranean politics. Blake may not have destroyed the Spanish fleet but he effectually prevented any reinforcements reaching the West Indies, saving Penn's mismanaged expedition from total disaster.<br>
<br>Cromwell showed his confidence in Blake by reappointing him to command the new expedition which was to blockade the coast of Spain now that war had been officially declared. He was joined by a new general-at-sea, Edward Mountagu. Mountagu's primary task was to negotiate a treaty with Portugal and Blake may well have been relieved that the political decisions which had plagued his last expedition were now to be transferred to someone else's shoulders. The fleet of thirty-seven powerful ships sailed from the Downs on 17 March 1656. The negotiations proved difficult. Cromwell demanded &pound;50,000 compensation for the damage done by royalist privateers, participation by English merchants in the Brazil trade on favourable terms, freedom of worship for English residents in Portugal, and free access to Portuguese ports for English warships. In return he was prepared to support Portugal in her fight for freedom from Spain which had been going on since 1640. King Jo&atilde;o wriggled hard and at one point Blake had to convince Mountagu that an attempt by the fleet to force the issue would not work. Blake had learned the lesson of 1650. In the end the Portuguese bowed to necessity. They needed English support badly. The treaty was concluded and the compensation money safely embarked and sent to England.<br>
<br>The English were now faced with the problem of what to do. The greatest prize, the plate fleet, was not expected for some time. Mountagu favoured an expedition to the West Indies but he received no support from the captains who feared the high mortality rate common in the tropics. A close inspection of Cadiz showed that a Porto Farina-style attack would not work. Mountagu had instructions to examine the Rock of Gibraltar to see if it would be suitable as a permanent fleet base. The report was not favourable. A large garrison would be needed and seamen were not suitable material. There was nothing of real importance on offer. Eleven ships were sent home and the rest prepared for a long and wearisome blockade, only varied by respites for victualling and watering at Lisbon and sporadic forays against the more exposed Spanish ports.<br>
<br>On 8 September 1656 the event occurred for which everyone had been waiting. Blake had divided the English fleet into three. Mountagu went with one squadron to negotiate a settlement with the pirates of Sal&eacute;, in which he was successful, due in no small part to the fear Blake inspired. Blake himself stood off to sea, leaving six of the fittest frigates under Captain Richard Stayner to watch Cadiz. Stayner it was who fell in with the plate fleet as it tried to make a dash for home, believing that the way was clear. Of the eight ships only two escaped. Three were captured, a fourth was sunk, and the other two forced on shore. The English haul was later valued at about &pound;200,000. They were rather disappointed because they thought that it would be much more valuable. In a way they were right. The ships with the most plate on board were the one sunk and one of those forced on shore, but the enduring belief that the war could be paid for with captured Spanish gold and silver was a myth.<br>
<br>Mountagu went home with the proceeds of Stayner's victory, leaving Blake to continue his weary watch off the Spanish coast. The plate fleet Stayner had captured was smaller than usual and information from prisoners indicated that a larger fleet was expected in the new year. When Cromwell heard what Mountagu had to say he had Blake reinforced and the weaker ships replaced so that he could ride the winter out. By this time everyone knew that the English fleet was there and merchant shipping kept away. The only excitement the English had was when a Dutch fleet appeared under de Ruijter. There were rumours that he intended to try and waylay the Portuguese Brazil fleet, which could have been a severe embarrassment. In the end all he did was escort Dutch trade to and from the Mediterranean. The first news of the plate fleet came when an English merchant captain, William Sadlington, reported seeing it on his voyage across the Atlantic. Blake made no move partly because of de Ruijter's presence and partly because he feared that he would miss it <i>en route</i>. Then information reached him that the fleet was at Tenerife and had no intention of moving so long as the English fleet was off the Spanish coast. Still he waited until de Ruijter had gone home and there was no danger to the ships left behind to maintain the blockade. The English sailed for the Canary Islands on 14 April 1657 and sighted Tenerife four days later.<br>
<br>After closely reconnoitring Santa Cruz harbour the English attacked on the morning of 20 April. The larger ships were to use their powerful guns to engage and, if possible, silence the Spanish forts. Twelve third- and fourth-rate frigates under the overall command of Stayner were to use the land breeze to sail into the harbour and get alongside the galleons. Strict instructions were given to sink them and not to try and take prizes. The attack commenced at 8 a.m. As at Porto Farina the English guns proved too strong for the main forts, which were quickly knocked out. The entire foreshore was fortified but the gunners there found that they could not see for smoke and risked hitting their own ships moored in front of them. By 9 a.m. the frigates were moored alongside the Spanish ships. By 11 a.m. all the smaller ships had been struck and many were on fire. The greater galleons were a tougher proposition and the larger ships had to enter the bay in order to complete their destruction, which was not accomplished until about 2 p.m. when the ships of the Spanish admiral and vice-admiral blew up in quick succession.<br>
<br>The most difficult part of the operation now began. The English ships had to warp themselves out of the bay under continuous fire from the forts, where some of the guns had been remounted, and from the foreshore, where, now that their own ships had gone, the gunners could at last see their targets. To make matters worse some of the captains greedily tried to tow their prizes out. Blake had to repeat his orders twice before they consented to fire them and cast off the ropes. It says a good deal for Blake's authority and leadership that they all successfully escaped; Stayner in the <i>Speaker</i> was the last to leave, very battered but still afloat.<br>
<br>In one way Blake's victory was a barren one. The Spaniards had had the forethought to transport the plate and bullion into the interior of the island, so the successful outcome of the battle did nothing to swell English coffers. Shortage of money was to force them to scale down their activity within a year. Yet in all other respects what Blake had done was of paramount importance. The victory at Tenerife resounded round Europe and made the English fleet feared far and wide. Santa Cruz harbour was believed to be one of the best defended on the Atlantic coast, a reputation that Nelson was later to find not unjustified. Yet the English fleet had sailed in and sunk all seventeen ships of the plate fleet without losing a single one of its own, an achievement almost unparalleled against land-based guns in naval annals. England may have been embarrassed for money but Blake's fleet had reduced the Spanish to desperate straits. In 1656 all the bullion from the New World had been lost, either to the English or sunk to the bottom of the ocean. The 1657 consignment was safe at Tenerife but the Spanish government could not get at it because of the English blockade. The Spanish armies ground to a halt for lack of money. 1658 was to be a disastrous year which finally forced them to the negotiating table.<br>
<br>The destruction of the plate fleet rendered a large armament off the Spanish coast unnecessary. Leaving a squadron of fourteen ships under Captain John Stokes, Blake sailed for home with the rest. Blake had never really recovered from the wound sustained at Portland. During the Mediterranean cruise of 1654&#150;5 he never set foot on shore, leaving diplomatic contacts to other officers such as Joseph Jordan. Part of the problem was ill health, which got worse in 1656 particularly after Mountagu went home. He was ill and in pain for part of the winter but rallied for the Canary Islands expedition. His state of health was causing concern to the Commonwealth agent Thomas Maynard, who visited him in July 1657. Blake must have known that he had not long to live and he breathed his last on 7 August 1657 as his flagship, the <i>George</i>, entered Plymouth Sound.<br>
<br>Blake never married and seems to have been almost totally without interest in women beyond the usual civilities. By his will dated 13 March 1656 he left his manor of Puriton to his brother Humphrey and his house in Bridgwater to his brother Benjamin. Apart from a house in Taunton he had no other property, not even in London, using the apartment at Whitehall to which his official duties entitled him as his residence. He left &pound;3000 in money. After giving &pound;100 each to Bridgwater and Taunton for distribution among the poor, the remainder was divided among his numerous relatives. He was buried in great state in the Henry VII chapel of Westminster Abbey, on 4 September, apparently against his expressed wishes, but at the Restoration his remains were thrown out by the royalists.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>Blake's achievements have led him to be ranked as one of England's three greatest seamen alongside Drake and Nelson, but often for the wrong reasons. In his day naval warfare was in the throes of a revolution but Blake had little part in making it. Regular broadside firing was already standard practice in the parliamentarian fleet and in the East India Company's fleet of defence. Disputes will always rage as to when fighting in a single line ahead became the norm. None of the battles where Blake was in charge show evidence of such tactics, yet this should not detract from his reputation. Neither Drake nor Nelson was a revolutionary and all three stand out for the way they led their fleets and took the tactics of their day to their logical conclusion. Yet, unlike the other two, Blake was not bred to the sea. He was appointed to the command on the strength of his record as a soldier and his loyalty to the Commonwealth, and had to learn the seaman's trade.<br>
<br>To begin with Blake seems to have been ignorant of the power of the guns English ships carried. At the beginning of the Anglo-Dutch War he soundly rated Christopher Myngs for rashness in taking on three Dutch warships single-handed. The skirmish off Dover opened his eyes and at Dungeness he went to the other extreme, rushing into battle with less than half the strength of the Dutch fleet. The critical early stages of Portland saw him treating a sea battle like the siege of Taunton, his ships being tied together so that guns were firing in all directions. Not until the Spanish war did he evolve a system by which he could use them to the greatest effect. The results both the Tunisians and the Spaniards had good cause to rue. How his conception of a battle in the open sea had developed will never be known, because he declined the one chance he had to engage the Spanish battle fleet.<br>
<br>In the same way Blake learned the art of blockade. In 1649 he let Rupert escape from Kinsale. In 1650 he learned first that attempts to force the issue could be counter-productive, then that accepting favours could limit his sphere of action, and finally that the enemy was only likely to emerge if the odds were not too heavily stacked against him. 1656 showed how well he had learned them.<br>
<br>Blake's most enduring contribution was in bringing a disciplined approach to naval warfare. What his captains liked were expeditions in search of plunder and prizes. What they disliked were pitched battles which threatened both life and limb, the irksome discipline which forced to them to spend long months on blockade, and, when they were on detached service, the priority which was given to defending their own merchant shipping over seeking rich pickings by attacking that of the enemy. His experiences before the First Anglo-Dutch War led him to suspect advice given by the traditional council of captains. During the war he was unsparing in his criticism of them. He was undoubtedly behind the new articles of war and supported the hierarchical arrangement of flag officers, introduced after Dungeness, which supplanted the earlier more egalitarian system.<br>
<br>Blake's disciplined approach continued during the Spanish war. He had learned the value of proper scouting and woe betide the frigate captain who abandoned his station to chase potential prizes or who returned before his relief had arrived. Blake was 5 feet 6 inches in height with a squat build and heavy jowled features, the very image of the church militant here on earth, the English &#145;bear&#146; who struck fear into his subordinates and visiting diplomats alike. So cowed were his captains before Tenerife that when Blake asked for their advice they refused to give it. The battle itself was the culmination of his work when he succeeded in forcing his captains to abandon their prizes in the interests of the operation as a whole.<br>
<br>If that had been all, Blake would not have been able to secure the response he did. In 1648 Lord Saye referred to the seamen with contempt as a group not worth considering in comparison with the soldiers. By 1660 all that had changed, and Blake played a major part in altering perceptions. It is typical of the man that, though most of the &pound;3000 he left were arrears from the civil wars, not claimed until he made his will, he realized that good men would not serve if they were not paid properly. In 1648 Popham had refused the command of a ship probably because becoming a navy captain would have entailed a reduction in his pay. In 1652 senior captains at last reached the pay levels of army colonels, who were their official equals in rank. Blake did not neglect the ordinary seamen either. There had been pay rises in 1642 and 1647 but rates were still poor in comparison with the Dutch and they were raised again. In order to encourage the men the prize regulations were altered so that they were rewarded for ships sunk as well as those captured, in proportion to the number of guns they carried. After Dungeness new regulations covering the sick and wounded were introduced and the interests of the relatives and dependants of captains were safeguarded. The widows and children of senior captains killed in battle were generously compensated. The interregnum governments and the other generals all played their part but only Blake identified himself totally with the interests of the fleet. He had no home life. His captains were his only family; he may have treated them like unruly children but he never asked them to do anything he would not do himself, with the result that they and their crews responded by following him wherever he led. The standards he set were the bench-mark by which later ages were to measure their own performances.<br>
<br>Perhaps Blake's greatest achievement in his own time was to create a unity of purpose when the country was beset by unrest and division. He himself wanted the Church of England to be replaced by a national presbyterian church along the lines laid down by parliament in 1646 and he regarded the sects with distaste. He was a republican. When he became one is not clear but Clarendon may well have been right in thinking that the idea took as early as his university days. While he was far from indifferent to what was happening, he took little active part in politics and, like Sir Henry Vane junior, he may have favoured the forced abdication of the king rather than his execution. He made no difficulty about serving the Commonwealth but he viewed the behaviour of Barebone's Parliament with disfavour, and he accepted the protectorate unenthusiastically as the least damaging alternative. As the earthly Jerusalem he sought became more and more elusive he tried to forget what was happening at home and treated the wars against the Dutch and the Spanish as in the interests of English people everywhere whatever their religious and political opinions. Clarendon again mirrored the extent to which he succeeded. He regarded Blake as an obstacle to a royalist restoration, second only to Cromwell, but he could not disguise his admiration for the &#145;miraculous&#146; victory at Tenerife which raised the reputation of the English nation throughout Europe to new heights  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 6.37).<br>
