<span class="headword">Sempill,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1595?), <span class="occ">poet and protestant controversialist</span>, was active during the early years of James VI's reign. Sempill's birth date is unknown; his allusion (in <span class="italic">Satirical Poems</span>, no. 45) to &#145;Epistle 25&#146; of Cl&eacute;ment Marot (1495&#150;1544) prompted the mistaken notion that he knew Marot personally, and was born <i>c</i>.1530. Sempill's parentage is also unknown. Attempts to identify him with Robert, fourth Lord Sempill (1563&#150;1611), who was a devout Catholic, are unconvincing. Sempill, styled in 1582 &#145;burgess of Dumbartan, callit utherwys the makar&#146;  (register of deeds, NA Scot., 23, fol. 59), was probably not of noble birth.<br>
<br>Sempill devised plays and other entertainments for the court, but no texts survive. On 17 January 1568 &#145;a play was made by Robert Semple, and played befor the Lord Regent and divers uthers of the nobilitie&#146;  (&#145;Diary of Robert Birrel&#146;, 14); the expenses for this were met, in part, by Edinburgh council. Between April 1567 and March 1573 the <span class="italic">Accounts of the Treasurer</span>, which record the expenses of the royal household, note various payments to Sempill for clothing and other unspecified services, possibly related to entertainments. On 20 September 1581 he was paid for producing &#145;a pastyme&#146; for King James in Dumbarton. The man styled &#145;capitane Sempill&#146; in March 1573 may possibly be the poet  (McInnes, 340). Many details in Sempill's poetry suggest that he had military experience; he either witnessed or participated in the sieges of Leith and Edinburgh Castle, which he describes with vividness and accuracy  (<span class="italic">Satirical Poems</span>, nos. 39 and 43).<br>
<br>Sempill is most famous for his satires and invectives, largely composed between 1567 and 1584, a time of great turbulence in Scotland. The poems vigorously support the reformers, and display hostility to Mary, queen of Scots. There is outrage at the St Bartholomew's day massacre (1572); a lament for the assassinated Regent Moray (1570); an attack on Archbishop Hamilton, executed in 1571; and a scurrilous but amusing lampoon, <span class="italic">The Legend of the Bishop of St Andrew's Life</span> (1584). Several poems are signed openly; others hint at their authorship covertly, by an acrostic on the &#145;first letters of everie verse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Satirical Poems</span>, no. 8), or punning references to Sempill's name, used as a symbol for the simple, plain-speaking man. Another favourite satirical persona is &#145;Maddie of the Caill mercat&#146;, who signifies the opinion of the ordinary citizen. Three bawdy poems on women are ascribed to Sempill in the Bannatyne manuscript (1568). Some critics have also attributed to him the comedy <span class="italic">Philotus</span> and, more plausibly, the satirical work known as <span class="italic">Rob Stene's Dream</span>.<br>
<br>Sempill's poems circulated widely, both in manuscript and print; many were published as broadsides by the protestant printer Robert Lekprevik. English envoys sent several to their government in London (where they are preserved in the Public Record Office and the British Library). James Melvill, minister of Kilrenny, records that in 1570, as a child in Montrose, he much enjoyed Sempill's verses: from them he learned both of the state of the country, and also &#145;of the missours [measures] and cullors [rhetorical ornaments] of Scottes ryme&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 22&#150;3). Although dismissed by some critics as crude and bigoted, Sempill's poems are metrically varied and rhetorically accomplished. Their pungent, combative style owes much to the &#145;flyting&#146; tradition of earlier Scottish poets, such as William Dunbar and Sir David Lindsay.<br>
<br>On 9 June 1582 Sir Patrick Waus (Vans) was informed that Robert Sempill, &#145;the poyet&#146; had been taken by &#145;men of weir&#146; from Edinburgh to Dalkeith  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of Sir Patrick Waus</span>, 247). Other accounts of this violent incident indicate that Sempill was imprisoned for several months by James, earl of Arran, who, with Esm&eacute; Stewart, duke of Lennox, had enormous influence over the young king. Sempill was variously accused of corresponding with Archibald, eighth earl of Angus, an extreme protestant, or of trafficking with the English in Berwick (Calderwood, 221; register of deeds, fols. 59 and 68<i>v</i>). Sempill survived this imprisonment, but the precise date of his death is uncertain. According to Thomas Dempster, an unreliable historian, he died in 1595  (<span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica</span>, 602&#150;3).<br>
