</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Zoffany,  Johan Joseph</span>  (1733&#150;1810), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born on 13 March 1733 near Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and baptized on 15 March at St Bartholomew's Cathedral, Frankfurt, the son of Anton Franz Zauffaly (1699&#150;1771), court cabinet-maker and architect to Alexander Ferdinand, prince of Thurn and Taxis, and his wife, Anna Ursula Dreiling (<i>bap</i>. 1704, <i>d</i>. 1779). The family soon moved to Regensburg with the prince and the young Johan was brought up in the circle of the court.<h2>
<a name="EducationearlyyearsandarrivalinEngland"></a>Education, early years, and arrival in England</h2>In 1747 with the encouragement of his mother, Zoffany was apprenticed to Martin Speer (<i>c</i>.1702&#150;1765), a local painter who worked in the late baroque style, but becoming impatient for the wider world Zoffany followed that essential means to self-improvement for an aspiring artist and in 1750 took himself to Rome. There he studied under Agostino Masucci, a fashionable painter of the classicist tradition whose pupils had included Pompeo Batoni and Gavin Hamilton. He attended the Accademia del Nudo, founded in 1754 on the Capitoline, placing himself under the German painter Anton Raphael Mengs, who taught drawing from the life and introduced Zoffany to the circles of nascent neo-classicism.<br>
<br>About 1757 after a second visit to Rome, Zoffany returned again to Germany to become court painter to Johann Philipp von Walderdorf, elector of Trier, who commissioned paintings and frescoes to decorate rooms in the Residenz at Trier and a chapel in the castle of Ehrenbreitstein at Koblenz. With the possible exception of <span class="italic">Venus Marina</span> and <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span> (1760; Mus&eacute;e des Beaux-Arts, Bordeaux), which may have been painted for the bedroom of the Residenz, none of these works is known to have survived, but a few studies in chalk and in oils (British Museum, London, and City of Manchester Art Gallery), in which the heroic baroque is modified into rococo prettiness, perhaps indicate their style.<br>
<br>At the same time Zoffany painted a number of ambitious mythological and historical pictures that were overlaid by a baroque emphasis more theatrical than convincing where movement and emotion are expressed in accentuated gestures to illustrate the story: <span class="italic">The Sacrifice of Iphigenia</span> (1758; Mittelrhein Museum, Koblenz) and <span class="italic">Odysseus Seizing Andromache's Son Astyanax</span> (ex Christies, 18 November 1988) showing a greater realism enhanced by a smooth finish and a relatively dark tonality typical of the German version of the international style. A still life (1760; Museum der Stadt, Trier) is a further example of the eclecticism of style which German court painters liable to be called on to paint works of every kind were required to master.<br>
<br>Towards the end of the 1750s Zoffany married Anthonie Theophista Juliane Eiselein (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1771/2), the daughter of a <i>Hofkammerrat</i> (court councillor) of W&uuml;rzburg, and making use of her dowry he left the confined life of the electoral court for the greater artistic horizons of London. Arriving there towards the end of 1760 he had difficulty in establishing himself, at first painting decorative scenes on clockfaces for Stephen Rimbault, a leading clockmaker, and then working as a drapery painter to Benjamin Wilson. From Wilson's studio he was rescued by the great actor David Garrick who commissioned Zoffany to paint informal scenes of his domestic life at his villa at Hampton&#151;<span class="italic">Mr and Mrs Garrick by the Shakespeare Temple at Hampton</span>, <span class="italic">A View in Hampton Garden with Mr and Mrs Garrick Taking Tea</span> (1762; priv. coll.).<br>
<br>The many portraits of himself in various roles that Garrick subsequently commissioned began with <span class="italic">The Farmer's Return</span> (1762; priv. coll.). This picture showed Zoffany's remarkable ability to paint lively figures in vivid interaction, to catch a fleeting expression, and to portray a likeness, and laid the foundation of his future reputation. It was exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1762 and was received with many accolades in the press. Setting up his own studio in Covent Garden, Zoffany painted many such pictures, which became known as theatrical conversations and were essentially publicity pictures, of Garrick, his friends, and his rivals. So pleased were the actors who were his subjects that Zoffany was commissioned to paint one or more versions of the same composition by others acting in the scene. Further publicity came for actors and artist from the large and handsome mezzotints that were immediately made from many of these theatrical conversation pieces. He painted Garrick with Mrs Cibber in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> (1762&#150;3; priv. coll.), in <span class="italic">The Provok'd Wife</span> (1763&#150;5; Wolverhampton Art Gallery), in <span class="italic">Lethe</span> (1766; Birmingham City Museums and Art Gallery), with Mrs Pritchard in <span class="italic">Macbeth</span> (1768; priv. coll.), and to great acclaim as Abel Drugger in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span> (1770; priv. coll.). Zoffany received many commissions to paint other actors in favourite roles, thus leaving vivid illustrations of one of the most brilliant periods in English theatrical history. Mrs Abington in <span class="italic">The Way to Keep Him</span> (1768; National Trust, Egremont Collection, Petworth House, Sussex), Charles Macklin as Shylock in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> (<i>c</i>.1768; Tate collection), Samuel Foote in <span class="italic">The Devil upon Two Sticks</span> (<i>c</i>.1768&#150;9; priv. coll.), and Thomas King and Mrs Baddeley in <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span> (1769&#150;70; Garrick Club, London), painted by order of George III, demonstrate Zoffany's success in transporting the spectator back to the theatre.<br>
<br>Through Garrick, Zoffany was introduced to the notice of the earl of Bute, prime minister to the young George III, for whom he painted a portrait of his eldest son, Lord Mountstuart (1763&#150;4; priv. coll.) wearing fashionable masquerade dress and the two companion paintings of Lord Bute's younger sons and daughters (1763&#150;4; priv. coll.), posed with the artful naturalness of motif that marks Zoffany's early success as a painter of the family or conversation piece. Zoffany was soon taken up by the circle of Scottish politicians who surrounded Bute and quickly entered into the spirit of a new informality in group portraiture, developing the family piece&#151;a genre which was well established but unfashionable in Germany&#151;into a lively composition in which natural actions are intertwined into a unity of responding gestures in a tightly composed group set in a context at once decorative and evocative of the lives of the sitters. Zoffany rendered the draperies and accessories of his sitters in a suavely rococo manner with a smoothness of finish and warm tone, painting the lustrous satins and intricate lace with skilful fidelity. His imitative skill was equally to the fore in his depiction of furnishings and interior settings, of still life, paintings, and sculptures. His musical sitters hold and play their instruments using the correct fingering, reflecting his own knowledge and enthusiasm, while his genuine sympathy with children is reflected in the imaginative amusements with which he animates their poses.<br>
<br>Among the commissions the Scottish connection brought Zoffany were the splendid full-length portrait of <span class="italic">Mrs Oswald</span> (1764; National Gallery, London), the conversation piece of <span class="italic">John, 3rd Duke of Atholl and his Family</span> (1765&#150;7), the duke and duchess with their seven children grouped informally beside the Tay in the grounds of their seat at Dunkeld, painted to fit the overmantel of the great drawing-room at Blair Castle. Zoffany's receipt for this picture specifies that he charged 20 guineas a figure. He also painted a powerful full-length portrait of Andrew Drummond (1766; Drummond's Bank, London), the founder of Drummond's Bank where Zoffany himself opened an account in 1765. In <span class="italic">Sir Lawrence Dundas with his Grandson</span> (1769&#150;70; priv. coll.) Zoffany shows Dundas in the library of his London house newly remodelled by Adam; this is a documented example of how an interior which apparently reproduces an actual room is a most artful painter's composition showing Sir Lawrence as a connoisseur of the arts.<h2>
<a name="Royalpatronage"></a>Royal patronage</h2>Probably through Bute, Zoffany obtained the patronage of George III and Queen Charlotte. His charming conversation piece of Queen Charlotte at her dressing table with her two eldest sons (1764; Royal Collection) marks the beginning of the informal royal conversation piece as a genre and is one of Zoffany's most elaborately contrived and perfectly finished works. Until he went to Florence in 1772 at Queen Charlotte's command, Zoffany continued to paint a number of conversation pieces and graciously informal portraits of the royal family capturing one of the characteristic expressions of eighteenth-century monarchy, one that he was later to employ for the family of the empress Maria Theresa.<br>
<br>Perhaps one reason why Zoffany made himself so acceptable at court was that he spoke German, for a number of the intimate court servants were Germans, with whom Charlotte, a German princess, evidently felt herself at ease. Zoffany seems never to have mastered English perfectly&#151;his one surviving autograph letter is largely written in a rather incorrect and slightly Germanized Italian. His accent and his broken English&#151;his third language after Italian&#151;are remarked on in several English memoirs. But he came to identify himself with England and was granted denization on 3 April 1772.<br>
<br>Zoffany also painted charming small single portraits or groups of two sitters, such as the <span class="italic">Reverend Randall Burroughes and his Son Ellis</span> (1769; Louvre Museum, Paris) in which he invents the setting: propped on a chair which can be identified as Zoffany's sitter's chair is Zoffany's own copy of <span class="italic">Perspective of Architecture</span> (1761) by his friend and neighbour Joshua Kirby. The set properties of eighteenth-century portraiture with curtain, column, books, and pose of <span class="italic">Mr Gawler's Cousin</span> (Yale U. CBA) is redeemed by the animation of the figure&#151;seated on the same sitter's chair&#151;and by the lustrous finish and brilliant colour. Under the influence of Reynolds's conception of the portrait as a historical painting Zoffany composed the life-size portrait of Henry Knight of Tythegston with his three children (1770; NMG Wales) linked in an inventive and lively manner in which the eye is carefully led round the sitters.<br>
<br>In the later 1760s Zoffany began painting genre pictures. Some, like the <span class="italic">Caritas Romana</span> (<i>c</i>.1769; National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne) and <span class="italic">The Beggars on the Road to Stanmore</span> (<i>c</i>.1769&#150;70; priv. coll.), painted for his banker, Andrew Drummond, are pleasing exercises in the prevailing sensibility, while in the highly finished picture <span class="italic">John Cuff and an Assistant</span> (1772; Royal Collection), painted in the Dutch manner, the still-life details of the optician's workshop are rendered with a sympathetic precision and fidelity that was distasteful to English connoisseurs of high art.<br>
<br>From 1762 Zoffany had exhibited at the Society of Artists but resigned in 1769 shortly after the establishment of the Royal Academy to which George III nominated him on a footing equal to the founding members [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94593', "Founders of the Royal Academy of Arts")</script>]. Probably for the king he painted his famous group portrait <span class="italic">The Academicians of the Royal Academy</span> (1771&#150;2; Royal Collection) which made a sensation when it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1772.<br>
<br>In spite of his success at court and his prominence as an academician Zoffany felt restless and in 1771 arranged to go with Sir Joseph Banks, accompanying as an artist Captain Cook's second voyage to the South Seas, but the accommodation proving inadequate he withdrew.<h2>
<a name="VisittoItaly"></a>Visit to Italy</h2>Mrs Zoffany later related:<blockquote>Being, however, in an unsettled state, having given up his house &amp; business, and displeased many of his patrons by leaving their pictures in an unfinished state, He determined to revisit Italy. Upon declaring this intention to Her Majesty, she patronised Him, and procured him letters of introduction to the principal persons there, with a present of &pound;300 for His Journey and an order to paint for Her, the Florence Gallery, which he executed &amp; recd for it a thousand pounds. (J. Farington, MS notebooks, 4 fols., 41&#150;3 (A), cited in Millar, <span class="italic">Zoffany and his Tribuna</span>, 37&#150;9)</blockquote>This commission from Queen Charlotte became a new turning point in Zoffany's life and in his artistic career.<br>
<br>The Tribuna of the Uffizi in Florence housed the finest paintings, antique sculptures, and works of art of the Medici collections and was famous throughout Europe. Neither Queen Charlotte nor George III could hope to visit Italy to see and admire its riches of ancient and modern art and Zoffany's picture was to be a painted substitute. In order to paint his picture, which was largely executed in the Tribuna itself, Zoffany needed special facilities which, since this was a royal commission, were granted without difficulty by the grand duke Pietro Leopoldo. Zoffany began work on the picture shortly after his arrival in Florence in August 1772, and continued to add to it until at least the end of 1777. The arrangement of the pictures hanging on the walls and of the statues and objects differs from their actual disposition in the Tribuna in the 1770s for he had leave to have brought into the Tribuna works from other parts of the gallery and from the Pitti Palace. Zoffany captured the culminating artistic experience of the grand tour in his <span class="italic">Tribuna of the Uffizi</span> (Royal Collection), a technical <i>tour de force</i> with its accurate imitation of the manner of the different painters and of the textures of the works of art he copied. Following the tradition of pictures of galleries small figures as spectators were to be included, but Zoffany's portraits of English travellers on their grand tour were an innovation.<br>
<br>Zoffany was secretly followed to Florence by a young girl of humble origins whom he had made pregnant. Finding that his first wife, who had returned homesick to Germany, had died, about 1772/1773 he married Mary Thomas (<i>c</i>.1755&#150;1832) in Florence after the birth there of a son. The self-portraits he painted while living in Italy (Uffizi, Florence, and Galleria di Parma), confessional and penitential in mood, reflect the conflicting drives tempting the painter from the pursuit of his art.<br>
<br>While living in Florence, Zoffany joined the English colony, finding a patron in Earl Cowper who had been settled there since 1759. He painted a fine and vigorous portrait of Lord Cowper, of his fianc&eacute;e, Hannah Anne Gore, playing a hurdy-gurdy (both priv. coll.), and a conversation piece of Lord Cowper with the Gore family (1775; Yale U. CBA) in which he figured the cultivated life of the family and an allegory of the forthcoming marriage.<br>
<br>Zoffany also found favour at the grand-ducal court of Pietro Leopoldo, son of the empress Maria Theresa, from whom he received commissions for family pictures like those he had painted for George III and Queen Charlotte. The intimate charm of his English portraits was tempered with pomp and ceremony in keeping with Habsburg formality for the portrait of the young Archduke Francis (1775) and in the life-size group of the whole grand-ducal family (1776) (both Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) painted against a background of the courtyard of the Pitti Palace. Zoffany took this portrait in a specially constructed carriage to Vienna where he completed it and was rewarded by the empress on 4 December 1776 with the title of baron of the Holy Roman empire. Honoured by his fellow artists during his stay in Italy, Zoffany was elected to the academies of Florence, Bologna, Cortona, and Parma.<br>
<br>Having moved in May 1778 to the duchy of Parma ruled by Ferdinand of Bourbon Parma whose wife was a Habsburg archduchess, he painted a group of the four grandchildren of Maria Theresa (1778; Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), one of his most charming formal compositions of children with their playthings set against the trappings of their princely rank. In a vivacious composition of the celebrations at the <i>scartocchiata</i> (or maize harvest) (1778; Galleria di Parma) and a <span class="italic">Florentine Fruit Stall</span> (<i>c</i>.1777; Tate collection) Zoffany's feelings for Italian life are painted with the affectionate observation that he introduced into the landscapes, prospects, and plants in the backgrounds of his Italian portraits.<br>
<br>Zoffany arrived back in London late in 1779 to disappointment and long wrangles over his picture of the Tribuna with the king and queen who were displeased with the groups of Englishmen introduced into the picture; there was now no more hope of royal commissions. But in this second short period in England from 1779 to 1783 Zoffany painted two of his most important pictures, <span class="italic">The Sharp Family</span> (1779&#150;81; NPG) and, as a gift for his friend, <span class="italic">Charles Townley in his Library</span> (1781&#150;3; Towneley Hall Art Gallery and Museums), the most neo-classical in feeling and colour of his paintings and a vivid record of a circle of collectors whose enthusiasm for the antique was important for the development of neo-classical taste. As in <span class="italic">The Tribuna</span>, Zoffany did not paint a straightforward view of the library but brought into his composition marbles displayed in other parts of the house.<br>
<br>Although at the height of his powers, Zoffany cannot have been too busy during these years for he painted a most accomplished life-size <span class="italic">Self-Portrait with his Daughter and Two Friends</span> (<i>c</i>.1782; Yale U. CBA). Adapting the principles of the no longer fashionable small conversation piece to a larger scale he produced a glittering double portrait, <span class="italic">John Wilkes and his Daughter Polly</span> (NPG). However his long absence had cost him his vogue as a portrait painter. He appears to have been living in too extravagant a style, buying in 1780 a house at Strand on the Green where he clothed his servants in liveries of scarlet, gold, and blue, the colours of his new arms as a baron. He now took the desperate step of resolving to restore his fortune in Bengal.<h2>
<a name="SojourninIndia"></a>Sojourn in India</h2>Zoffany sailed for India in March 1783 and arrived at Calcutta on 15 September. He was well recommended and immediately taken up by the governor, Warren Hastings. In India, Zoffany painted both small conversation pieces of English families, some conventional, others with Indian attendants and Indianized settings such as <span class="italic">Colonel Blair and his Family</span> (1786; ex Sothebys, 18 March 1981), and life-size swagger portraits whose brilliance of colour and Indian features celebrate the exotic years of their sitters' lives, <span class="italic">General Norman Macleod of Macleod</span> and <span class="italic">Sarah, Wife of Norman Macleod</span> (1787; priv. coll.). He responded to the Indian scene with genuine delight, making drawings of the landscape, crumbling buildings, and twisted trees.<br>
<br>In May 1784 Hastings summoned Zoffany to Lucknow, the capital of Oudh, to paint a portrait of the nawab vizier Asaf ud-Daula (India Office Library and Records, BL). In Lucknow, where Zoffany was to reside for much of his time in Bengal, he painted his most brilliant pictures of European life in India and of Indian princes and notables. There he made friends with the Swiss colonel Anthony Polier and the Frenchman General Claude Martin, both cultivated men who had entered the nawab's service. In one of his finest Indian works Zoffany has shown himself painting with these two friends, who are engaged with pictures and oriental manuscripts (Victoria Memorial Hall, Calcutta). The other side of life in Lucknow is illustrated in <span class="italic">Colonel Mordaunt's Cock Fight</span> (1784&#150;6; Tate collection), an unforgettable image of a moment when Indians and Europeans mingled on the easiest of terms at the court of a Muslim prince, which he painted for Warren Hastings.<br>
<br>As a token of his gratitude for the kindness and patronage he had received in Bengal, Zoffany presented in 1787 an altarpiece of the last supper to the new Anglican church of St John's in Calcutta. He also became a member of the newly founded Asiatic Society of Bengal. Zoffany left India in January 1789, with his fortune made. He continued to use drawings made in India for pictures painted after his return to England, such as the <span class="italic">Death of the Royal Tiger</span> (Victoria Memorial Hall, Calcutta) and <span class="italic">Hyderbeg's Embassy to Lord Cornwallis</span> (exh. RA, 1796; Victoria Memorial Hall, Calcutta).<h2>
<a name="ReturntoEngland"></a>Return to England</h2>The Europe to which he returned was the Europe of the French Revolution and Zoffany's easy-going eighteenth-century liberalism was shocked by the Parisian massacres of 1792 into horrified reaction. In <span class="italic">The Plundering of the King's Cellar</span> (exh. RA, 1794; Wadsworth Atheneum), his painting of the populace sacking the Tuileries, Zoffany depicted the scene of wanton brutality with dramatic force. In contrast to this and other similar compositions Zoffany painted two altarpieces for his local parish churches at Brentford and Chiswick, but his powers began to fail and he exhibited in 1800 for the last time at the Royal Academy.<br>
<br>Zoffany's later years were saddened by senile decay and on 11 November 1810 he died at Strand on the Green; he was buried on 17 November in Kew parish church, Surrey. His widow held a sale on 9&#150;10 May 1811 of his unsold and unfinished pictures, his collections of books and prints, together with the armour and oriental curiosities he had brought back from his travels; any drawings, letters, notebooks or accounts she may have kept were burnt after she died of cholera in 1832. From the 1920s attempts have been made to increase Zoffany's <i>oeuvre</i> by adding a substantial number of controversial attributions. More recently, his work has also attracted speculative publications on the subject matter of his compositions.<br>
