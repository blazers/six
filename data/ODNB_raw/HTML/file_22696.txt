</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Praed,  Winthrop Mackworth</span>  (1802&#150;1839), <span class="occ">poet and politician</span>, was born on 26 June 1802 at 35 John Street, Bedford Row, London, the fourth of the five children of William Mackworth Praed (1756&#150;1835), serjeant-at-law and long-time chairman of the Audit Office, and his wife, Elizabeth (1767&#150;1810), daughter of Benjamin Winthrop, merchant and governor of the Bank of England. Praed was the product of an old family with roots in Rutland and Cornwall. His father was wealthy enough to afford a fashionable address in London as well as Bitton House, an 18 acre estate in Teignmouth, Devon. Praed was a remarkably precocious but delicate child. In 1810 he started at Langley Broom School, near Colnbrook, where he quickly distinguished himself. He went to Eton College in March 1814, and remained there until July 1821. Praed was a legendary Etonian, who left as indelible a mark on his schoolmates there as George Canning had done a generation earlier. In 1820 he founded a manuscript journal, the &#145;Apis Matina&#146;, and accounted for at least half of the contributions to its six numbers. Later the same year, he started <span class="italic">The Etonian</span>, a more ambitious journal which Charles Knight agreed to publish, and once again he dominated its pages, contributing some thirty-five articles and a dozen poems. Knight later described Praed the Etonian as:<blockquote>natural and unaffected in his ordinary talk; neither shy nor presuming; proud, without a tinge of vanity; somewhat reserved, but ever courteous; giving few indications of the susceptibility of the poet, but ample evidence of the laughing satirist; a pale and slight youth, who had looked upon the aspects of society with the keen perception of a clever manhood. (Knight, 1.282&#150;3)</blockquote>Praed followed up his Eton career with an equally brilliant one at Cambridge. Breaking with family tradition, he chose Trinity College over St John's, and there he read classics alongside Macaulay. He won four medals for Greek odes and epigrams and two more for English parody, as well as a declamation prize. He narrowly missed winning the university scholarship, and in 1825 was bracketed third in the classical tripos. An active member of the Cambridge Union Society, Praed was widely praised for his witty and offhand manner in debate. While he lacked the physical stamina to match Macaulay's soaring eloquence, he could argue his case tenaciously when provoked into doing so, and he often took the radical side on political issues. Praed's good looks undoubtedly contributed to his popularity at Cambridge. &#145;In person he was of spare habit&#146;, according to his sister Susan:<blockquote>complexion pale, features strongly marked, symmetrical, but thin and somewhat sharply cut. His forehead was clear and well built; finished above by an uncommon beauty: his eyes large, and very expressive; face almost pointed, from the unusual prolongation of the lower outline. (Hudson, 66)</blockquote>His singular features, his self-confidence, and the ease with which he seemed to master any subject that interested him all combined to make him a legend. He &#145;was to the University what Byron was to the world&#146;, Bulwer Lytton recalled. &#145;[T]here was a fascination in the very name of this young man which eclipsed the repute of his contemporaries&#146;  (ibid., 67&#150;9).<br>
<br>After leaving Cambridge in March 1825, Praed served as tutor to Lord Ernest Bruce, second son of the marquess of Ailesbury, and eventually accompanied his charge to Eton. During this interval Praed contributed several political squibs to the whig <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. He also began a long relationship with the <span class="italic">New Monthly Magazine</span>, where many of his poems first appeared, and composed verse for Alaric Watts's <span class="italic">Literary Souvenir</span>, the most popular of the illustrated annuals. Praed also made time to read for a Trinity fellowship, to which he was elected in 1827. After leaving Eton late in 1827, Praed went to London, where he began work as a pupil of John Bayley, a Middle Temple barrister. He had little patience with the drudgery of legal work, but persevered in his studies and was called to the bar in May 1829. Praed decided to go the Norfolk circuit, and, like most new barristers, started off with few briefs and considerable time on his hands.<br>
<br>Praed's flirtation with political radicalism had ended by the time he left Cambridge. He was an enthusiastic supporter of Catholic emancipation, but by the late 1820s had become convinced that wholesale parliamentary reform could only lead to social chaos. An admirer of Canning, Praed lauded him in verse after he suddenly died shortly after reaching the premiership in 1827. Praed essentially remained a Canningite for the rest of his short life by subsequently professing his devotion to Sir Robert Peel. Like his two heroes, he was committed to practical improvements while deploring what he considered the dangerous constitutional tinkering of the whigs and their radical associates. The tories were aware of Praed's debating skills, and, thinking that he would provide a counterweight on the Commons floor to the likes of his old schoolfriend Macaulay, in December 1830 they offered him the use of the pocket borough of St Germans for two years in exchange for &pound;1000. He accepted the offer, and thus became one of very few promising young men who took a seat opposite the new Grey ministry. Praed lost little time in making himself useful to the tory cause. In a series of verse satires published in <span class="italic">The Alfred</span> and <span class="italic">The Albion</span> he established his anti-reform credentials:<blockquote>
<div>We're sick of this distressing state<br>
</div>
<div>Of order and repose;<br>
</div>
<div>We have not had enough of late<br>
</div>
<div>Of blunder, or of blows;<br>
</div>
<div>We can't endure to pass our life<br>
</div>
<div>In such a humdrum way;<br>
</div>
<div>We want a little pleasant strife&#151;<br>
</div>
<div>The Whigs are in to-day!<br>
</div>
<div>&hellip;<br>
</div>
<div>It's time for us to see the things<br>
</div>
<div>Which other folk have seen;<br>
</div>
<div>It's time we should cashier our kings,<br>
</div>
<div>And build our guillotine;<br>
</div>
<div>We'll abrogate Police and Peers,<br>
</div>
<div>And vote the Church away;<br>
</div>
<div>We'll hang the parish overseer&#151;<br>
</div>
<div>The Whigs are in to-day!<br>
</div> (&#145;The New Order of Things&#146;, 1830, stanzas 1 and 4, reprinted in Praed, <span class="italic">Political and Occasional Poems</span>, 123&#150;4)</blockquote>On 14 February 1831 Praed delivered a celebrated maiden speech on the cotton duties, supporting his argument against the government's plans for altering them with an impressive array of statistics. But his chief preoccupation at this time was the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. Resentful that his borough had been slated for extinction under schedule A, he fought vigorously against the main provisions of the bill, and tried but failed to narrow their scope through amendment. After the disfranchisement of St Germans, Praed stood for the borough of St Ives, but lost to the incumbent, James Halse, in a bitter contest. While he was out of parliament he remained deeply involved in partisan politics, frequently contributing anti-whig satires to the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> and serving as the <span class="italic">Post's</span> chief leader writer from early 1833 until late 1834. By this time his political celebrity had greatly enhanced the value of his legal practice; his barrister's income trebled the year after he entered the Commons, and it continued to grow thereafter. Praed returned to the Commons as MP for Great Yarmouth in 1834, and served as secretary to the Board of Control in Peel's short-lived ministry of 1834&#150;5. After retiring from this constituency in 1837, he was subsequently returned for Aylesbury, conveniently taking over the seat previously held by his cousin James. Already plagued by symptoms of consumption, Praed refused to slow down the hectic pace of his life; he still possessed sufficient energy to attack the Melbourne government's Canada policy and to champion the National Society's working-class education schemes.<br>
<br>What little spare time Praed allowed himself he devoted to raising a family. On 7 July 1835 he married Helen Bogle, a wealthy young beauty whose sugar merchant father, George, had retired to Effingham, Surrey. Two daughters were born to them over the next next three years, Helen Adeline and Elizabeth Lilian. In order to accommodate his growing family, Praed purchased a spacious house in south-west London, 64 Chester Square. His health was already rapidly deteriorating when they moved in, but he insisted on carrying on his legal and political duties as best he could, and was still attending Commons debates only a few weeks before his death. He died on 15 July 1839 at his Chester Square residence.<br>
<br>Praed is best remembered for what he might have become had he not died young; indeed, he came to be seen as a tragic archetype&#151;the young man of promise cut down before his prime. He carried his schoolboy reputation with him into parliament, and managed to preserve it there through occasional flashes of brilliance. Had he lived, he might well have risen to a commanding position within Peel's Conservative ministry in the early 1840s. As it happened, at the time of his death he was best known for his poetry. Although he often dismissed himself as a mere versifier, Praed sketched the manners and mores of the polite society he knew so well with a graceful nonchalance. While his poetry is now virtually unknown, it was popular enough in the Victorian era to merit the publication of several collections on both sides of the Atlantic. American collections appeared in 1844, 1850, and 1859. Praed's close friend Derwent Coleridge was responsible for the first British edition in 1864, and his nephew Sir George Young edited <span class="italic">Political and Occasional Poems</span> in 1888. It is altogether appropriate that Praed, a boy wonder whom fate would not permit to grow old, left behind him some of the most vivid paeans to the golden youth of the early nineteenth-century leisured classes:<blockquote>
<div>I wish that I could run away<br>
</div>
<div>From House, and court, and levee,<br>
</div>
<div>Where bearded men appear to-day,<br>
</div>
<div>Just Eton boys, grown heavy;<br>
</div>
<div>That I could bask in childhood's sun,<br>
</div>
<div>And dance o'er childhood's roses;<br>
</div>
<div>And find huge wealth in one pound one,<br>
</div>
<div>Vast wit in broken noses;<br>
</div>
<div>And play Sir Giles at Datchet Lane,<br>
</div>
<div>And call the milk-maids Houris;&#151;<br>
</div>
<div>That I could be a boy again,<br>
</div>
<div>A happy boy, at Drury's!<br>
</div> (&#145;School and schoolfellows&#146;, 1829, 11.77&#150;89)</blockquote>
