<span class="headword">Soone,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1545&#150;<em>c.</em>1575), <span class="occ">civil lawyer and map maker</span>, was of unknown parentage. He graduated BA at Cambridge in 1545 and proceeded MA in 1549. He became a doctor of canon and civil law, probably at a university on the continent. The bursar's accounts at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, show that he was resident at Gonville Hall, probably as a fellow, from 1548 to 1555. In 1561 he became regius professor of civil law and in June he was admitted as a fellow of Trinity Hall. He had probably left Trinity Hall by 1563, when he was succeeded in his professorship by William Clerke. His reason for leaving was that he would not conform to the new protestant service.<br>
<br>Soone is said to have lived in Paris, D&ocirc;le, Freiburg, and Padua and was professor of law for some time at Louvain. From there he moved to Antwerp where he probably acted as Abraham Ortelius's assistant, perhaps because of his expertise as a map maker. In 1572 he was at Cologne, where he published <span class="italic">Gulielmi Sooni Vantesdeni auditor, sive, Pomponius Mela disputator de situ orbis</span>, a copy of which is in the British Library. Ortelius complained to Soone that part of the book, the &#145;Novi incolae orbis terrarum&#146;, was copied from that of Arnold Mylius published by Ortelius in his 1570 version of the <span class="italic">Theatrum</span>. Soone wrote to Ortelius from Cologne on 31 August 1572, and offered some rather weak explanations for this. Soone also copied the map of Cambridge drawn by Richard Lyne for Thomas Caius's <span class="italic">History of the University</span> (1574) and published it in Braun's and Remigius Hogenberg's <span class="italic">Civitates orbis terrarum</span> (<i>c</i>.1575) along with a description of the university. He was working as an auditor in Cologne by 1573 but decided that his legal and administrative skills could be put to better use in Rome, where Gregory XIII appointed him <i>podest&agrave;</i> of a town within the Papal States.<br>
