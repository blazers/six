<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bolton,  Robert</span>  (1572&#150;1631), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Blackburn, Lancashire, on Whitsunday, 25 May 1572, the sixth son of Adam Bolton (<i>d</i>. 1593) of Brookhouse, Blackburn, a yeoman and governor of the free grammar school there in 1567, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1610). Much of what is known about him is to be found in the &#145;Life and death of Mr. Bolton&#146; prefixed to various editions of Bolton's works by Edward Bagshawe, who, having been one of his first students at Oxford, became a lifelong friend. His parents, finding in their young son &#145;a great towardliness for learning, destinated him to be a scholar, and struggled with their estate to furnish him with necessaries in that kind&#146;  (Bagshawe, 5&#150;6); he studied at Blackburn School under its master, Yates (perhaps Lawrence Yates), becoming &#145;the best scholler in the schoole&#146;  (ibid.).<h2>
<a name="Oxford"></a>Oxford</h2>In 1592 Bolton was admitted to Lincoln College, Oxford, where his tutor was John Randall. Here Bolton's school work, and comparative maturity, gave him an advantage over others in his cohort, and he progressed well in the study of logic and philosophy. Within a few months, however, the death of his father (himself a younger son) reduced him to penury. From the need to return books borrowed from his tutor and others he learned the habit of summarizing them extensively in notebooks. He became especially expert in Greek, and, according to Anthony Wood, could write it better than English or Latin.<br>
<br>Bolton transferred to Brasenose, perhaps hoping to resolve his financial difficulties by securing a fellowship, and graduated BA there on 2 December 1596. By 2 December 1597 he held a Nowell scholarship, a foundation designed for the support of Lancashire men. Yet lacking well-placed friends and connections a fellowship initially eluded him; it seems possible that his religious outlook may have been a factor. During this difficult period he depended greatly upon another Greek scholar, Dr Richard Brett, of Lincoln College, &#145;most bountifully to contribute to his relief&#146;  (Bagshawe, 10). Eventually in 1602 he became a fellow of Brasenose and proceeded MA on 8 July. Appointed lecturer in logic and moral and natural philosophy, he was subsequently chosen by George Abbot, then vice-chancellor, to hold a dispute before the king on natural philosophy on the occasion of James's visit to the university in 1605.<br>
<br>Throughout his university career up to this point, according to Bagshawe, Bolton had been exceptionally hard-working yet he had developed sympathies with Roman Catholicism, a fault akin to atheism: &#145;he was a very mean scholar in the school of Christ, he drew no religious breath from the soil he came&#146;. Having travelled to Cambridge to hear William Perkins, possibly the most eminent puritan of his generation, Bolton rejected his plain style of speaking and its content, calling the great man &#145;a barren empty fellow, and a passing mean scholar&#146;  (Bagshawe, 11, 13). Bagshawe, himself a zealous puritan, tells us that Bolton also enjoyed &#145;stage plays, cards and dice, he was a horrible swearer and sabbath breaker, and boon-companion&#146;, a character which may have been coloured to contrast with his subject's later piety  (Bagshawe, 12). An attempt by the Jesuit Lawrence Anderton, formerly of Blackburn School and then of Christ's College, Cambridge, to persuade Bolton to take ship for a seminary in Flanders failed when Anderton did not himself appear at the rendezvous. Bolton shortly afterwards returned to Brasenose, where he proceeded BD on 14 December 1609, and where the vice-president, Thomas Peacock, was instrumental in his conversion to the austere form of protestantism which he was to follow for the rest of his life. Bolton soon decided to become a minister, for, as he explained, he observed in the university &#145;many reverend and learned men, full of the light of divine truth, and of the water of life, able gloriously and comfortably to enlighten many dark places and dry souls in the bosom of this their famous nurse, not brought up by her to die at her breasts&#146;, but ready instead &#145;to enlarge Christ's kingdom abroad, and to oppose with all their power, against the bloody torrent of popery and rage of antichrist&#146;  (Bolton, <span class="italic">Discourse</span>, sig. A3).<h2>
<a name="RectorofBroughton"></a>Rector of Broughton</h2>On 12 February 1610 Bolton was inducted to the rectory of Broughton, Northamptonshire, on the presentation of Sir Augustine Nicols, sergeant in the household of Prince Henry, and on 22 June he was granted a preaching licence. He resigned his fellowship on 2 March 1611 and soon afterwards married Anne or Anna, the youngest daughter of Thomas Boyse of Eythorne, Kent. Their first child was buried, unbaptized, at Broughton on 21 March 1612.<br>
<br>Bagshawe describes the vigorous programme of daily prayer and spiritual reflection followed by Bolton and his growing family. His mental outlook was transformed by the pains of his spiritual rebirth, in which God came &#145;not by any soft and still voice, but in terrible tempests and thunder, the Lord running upon him as a giant, taking him by the neck and shaking him to pieces as he did Job; beating him to the very ground, as he did Paul, by laying before him the ugly visage of his sins&#146;  (Bagshawe, 15&#150;16). From many months of temptations and suffering Bolton emerged with unshakeable convictions, but he never forgot the torment his conscience had suffered. Thus it was that &#145;though in his preaching he was a <i>son of thunder</i>, yet unto bruised reeds and those that mourned in spirit, he was as sweet a son of consolation as ever I heard&#146;  (ibid., 20). Indeed, conceded Anthony Wood, &#145;he was sought to far and near, and divers beyond the seas&#146; came to him for relief from the doubts that afflicted their consciences  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.515). Several of Bolton's works reflect a deep preoccupation with the inner life of the saint, not least in their titles: <span class="italic">Some General Directions for a Comfortable Walking with God</span>; <span class="italic">Instructions for a Right Comforting Afflicted Consciences</span>; <span class="italic">A Cordiall for Christians in the Time of Affliction</span>. There is no doubt that Bolton's ministry was directed at a minority of that minority who conventionally saw themselves as good people in the sight of God: there was &#145;no hope for the drunkard, the swearer, the liar, the usurer, the unclean person, the sabbath breaker, the sacrilegious, simonical, and sinners of such infamous rank&#146;, though he spoke with grief rather than anger of the sins of his flock. Yet &#145;many thousands&#146; of others falsely supposed that, being free &#145;from gross and notorious sins&#146;, and having &#145;civil honesty, a formal profession of Christianity, outward performances of religious seriousness, that then their case is good enough for heaven, though there be wanting the &hellip; saving power of inward sanctification, and the truth of a sound conversion&#146;. And he pointed instead to &#145;a paradise of Christian comforts, a royal peculiar, a victorious simplicity, a neglected innocency, a marvellous light, an invisible kingdom, an heaven upon earth; which I call the state of grace&#146;  (Bolton, <span class="italic">Discourse</span>, sig. A3). Such a standpoint was perhaps not best calculated to strengthen the religious unity of the people of Broughton.<h2>
<a name="Publicmorality"></a>Public morality</h2>Bolton was a patriotic puritan minister, remarking upon &#145;the mighty workings of King James his works upon the adversaries&#146;  (R. Bolton, <span class="italic">Instructions for a Right Comforting Afflicted Consciences</span>, 1631, 4). The vigour and frequency of his diatribes against popery probably reflect Bolton's still unquiet conscience about his own record. He makes much of Catholic encouragement to &#145;furious assassins and incendiaries, for murdering of princes, butcheries of people, and fiering of states&#146;, stressing that in English protestantism, there was no warrant for the popular deposition of kings  (R. Bolton, <span class="italic">Two Sermons Preached at Northampton</span>, 29). Here and in other such passages the Gunpowder Plot figures largely, and in his will Bolton provided that his bequest to the poor of Broughton should be paid on 5 November following his death and on that date in two subsequent years. His works are often prefaced by dedications to leading gentlemen of Northamptonshire such as Edward Montague and Erasmus Dryden.<br>
<br>Bolton favoured a magistracy which would deal firmly with evil-doers (including usurers and enclosers), but saw popery and profanity as its chief enemies, and the godly preaching ministers as its chief allies. He attacked on the one side the &#145;negligent and unconscionable minister, which never goes about to stir the devil in the ignorant, profane and those that hate to be reformed&#146; and on the other, &#145;the idle justice, that only hunts after plausibleness and popularity, and for the good word of all the good fellows about him&#146;  (R. Bolton, <span class="italic">Two Sermons Preached at Northampton</span>, 56). There was &#145;no more notorious villany&#146; than for<blockquote>an ingenious and free people &hellip; to have a magistrate set over them, which adding craft to his power and skill, welds them all three to work his own ends, and practise his private revenge from time to time upon his supposed opposites.</blockquote>Justices should be &#145;men of truth&#146;, &#145;true hearted Nathaniels in their private and personal conversation; let them prize and prefer the truth &hellip; Before gold or friend, favourite, or richest favour&#146;  (ibid., 63).<br>
<br>Bolton's most prominent public platform was the celebrated, and officially sanctioned, lecture at Kettering. &#145;His doctrine was never drawn into question either for error or schism&#146;  (Bagshawe, 27), and he did not urge reform in church or state, but he repeatedly demanded that both should operate in a more godly fashion. He was extremely and repeatedly outspoken in condemning corruption. In 1621&#151;in a sermon before the assize at Northampton&#151;Bolton took as his text &#145;When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn&#146;. He pointedly asked whether<blockquote>this gangrene of going into offices, benefices, and high rooms by corruption, is not unhappily crept into this famous and flourishing state; which if it should, it will eat into the hearts and sinews of the state, that no wit of man can foresee, into what baseness and degenerations this noble kingdom would fall in the next age. (R. Bolton, <span class="italic">Two Sermons Preached at Northampton</span>, 3)</blockquote>On simony he was even less restrained, contrasting his deceased patron's integrity in disposing of livings with &#145;the practice of the times&#146;, attacking openly those among his auditory, who<blockquote>for a little bloody gain put upon them an ignorant, idle, dissolute, non-resident, or some way unfaithful minister &hellip; And what a vexing cry in the ears of all sacrilegious church robbers will that be of a damned wretch in hell; when he shall complain everlastingly that his soul had been saved, if such a man had not been simoniacal. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.161&#150;2)</blockquote>Bolton came to believe that many among the governing classes of England were becoming more selfish and arrogant, less godly and less humane; he attacked the &#145;degenerations of our gentility&#146;, in which gentlemen<blockquote>think to bear down all before them with an artificial affected impetuousness, as it were, of countenance; a disdainful neglect and contemptuousness in their carriage, with a kind of outbraving and brow beating of their brethren, as though brave apparel and a big look were demonstrations of a noble spirit. (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.167)</blockquote>He thought that when a &#145;patriot which in some high place like a strong pillar opposes the corruptions and popery of the times; or any faithfull pastor &hellip; is taken away&#146; then people should prepare &#145;against an evil day&#146;, and he feared &#145;some heavy thing is preparing for us&#146;, for the sins of England were &#145;ripe for His revenging hand&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.157). In 1629, in what was surely taken as a comment on recent developments in religion, he pointed to the danger of &#145;unrighteous ruling&#146; by means of &#145;tampering with our articles of religion &hellip; by labouring to put false glosses upon them, and talking of some reconcilement of our church to the Romish synagogue&#146;  (R. Bolton, <span class="italic">Two Sermons Preached at Northampton</span>, 76). It may be that he also became more aware of and unhappy at the sale of offices. In 1630 he attacked the practice in a sermon before justices of assize Sir Richard Hutton and Sir George Croke, quoting Tacitus, &#145;Never came any to an high room wrongfully, and unworthily: but he exercised his power and authority wickedly and unjustly&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 1.188).<br>
<br>Bolton's biographer claimed that his zeal &#145;was always tempered with discretion&#146;  (Bagshawe, 27), but this had limits. He corresponded with Arthur Hildersham, a veteran of the Elizabethan puritan movement, and was friendly with John Preston. His sympathies were with the reformed churches abroad: &#145;for his charity, he was ever universally bountiful, but especially he exceeded in those public distresses of Germany, France, Bohemia etc and to those that stood in true need&#146;  (Bagshawe, 28). Bolton knew from his training that the word &#145;puritan&#146; meant sympathy with the teachings of the heretic Novatius. Before his conversion he was not above deploying it as a mere insult, but later he sought to correct the misuse of the term, to rebut the sort of sneering attacks which he himself had once mounted, and to identify with the people thus stigmatized. In 1610 he could note that &#145;The world is come to that wretched pass, and height of profaneness, that even honesty and sanctification, is many times odiously branded by the nick-name of puritan&#146;  (Bolton, <span class="italic">Discourse</span>, 132). Almost two decades later he thought it had become commonplace: &#145;Nowadays, every Nimrod, impure drunkard, and self-guilty wretch, is ready with great rage&#146; to impute puritanism to anyone of religion and integrity, thus striking &#145;at Gods best servants, and the kings best subjects&#146;  (R. Bolton, <span class="italic">Two Sermons Preached at Northampton</span>, 84). Ironically, through its abuse the name had become synonymous with honesty in public life:<blockquote>We are coming to a strange pass, that it should be holden a puritanical point, to condemn all corrupt coming into places of preferment, and public charge, since even politic pagans, and barbarous nations, out of light of reason, and ordinary notions of nature, did abhor it. (ibid., 92)</blockquote>Bolton took his family and pastoral responsibilities with the utmost seriousness, and undoubtedly acted and appeared in a demeanour calculated to encourage respect. His portrait depicts a well-built, handsome, grave man of nearly sixty, with long white hair and impressive beard. It would be unwise to dismiss out of hand as an invention of puritan hagiography the story that Bolton, when &#145;walking in the streets, was so much cloathed with majesty&#146; that people would stop their levity, for fear of attracting his disapproval or censure  (Bolton and Bolton, 227). He acquired a reputation far outside Northamptonshire. For Anthony Wood, a historian rarely generous to men of Bolton's stripe, he was &#145;a most religious and learned puritan&#146;, and &#145;a painful and constant preacher, a person of great zeal for god, charitable and bountiful&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.513, 515). After enduring for over three months a &#145;quartan ague&#146; (characterized by the recurrence of fits every four days), Robert Bolton died on 17 December 1631. His funeral sermon was preached two days later at St Andrew's, Broughton, by Nicholas Estwick and was published in 1635. Bolton was buried in the chancel, where in an alcove was set a half-length figure of the rector at prayer, his arms resting on an open bible. He was survived by his wife, Anne, son Samuel (<i>d</i>. 1669), and daughters Hannah, Mary, Elizabeth, and Sara.<br>
