<span class="headword">Baker,  Robert</span>  (1803&#150;1880), <span class="occ">surgeon and factory inspector</span>, was born on 15 August 1803 in York, the second son of John Baker, druggist, of High Ousegate, York, and his wife, Hannah. His career shows many parallels with that of the better-known Charles Turner Thackrah, but evidence of association is lacking. In March 1818 Baker was apprenticed to William Pearson for five years, Pearson being surgeon to the Hull General (later Royal) Infirmary. Baker's medical education was continued at Guy's Hospital, London. He passed the Society of Apothecaries' qualifying examination in 1823, apparently while under age, and then gained membership of the Royal College of Surgeons. He appears on the college registers only from 1828 to 1843.<br>
<br>Baker's first appointment was in Leeds, as a poor-law surgeon, which he later described as &#145;an ordeal all the medical men of the town go through as the high road to better practice&#146;. The direction of Baker's career was determined by the cholera epidemic of 1831&#150;2. Baker's sanitary reports on the cholera in Tyneside, and on housing and environmental conditions in Leeds, included a use of maps which brought him to wider notice. On his own account he abandoned medical practice for factory work as a result of contracting cholera in the course of his poor-law duties. In the early 1830s he was employed as factory surgeon to the mill of Hindes and Derham and later claimed credit for the half-time education system for child factory workers whose health appeared precarious.<br>
<br>On 22 October 1834 Baker was appointed a &#145;superintendent&#146; (equivalent to sub-inspector) according to the <span class="roman">Factory Act</span> of 1833. By 1837 he had ceased acting as a certifying surgeon, which involved some conflict of interest. He was still the only factory inspector with medical qualifications at the time of the famous sanitary report of 1842 by Edwin Chadwick, to which Baker was a contributor. In spite of local support he was not promoted until 15 June 1858. In 1861 he became, with his younger colleague Alexander Redgrave, one of two inspectors covering the British Isles following the retirement of John Kincaid. Baker supervised the north-west, the midlands, the west country, Wales, and northern Ireland. In this capacity he submitted biannual reports and advised on legislation, which was elaborated and then codified by the <span class="roman">Factories Act</span> of 1878. He retired in the same year and was appointed CB.<br>
<br>Baker's publications were occasional. He was most consistent in his concern for working children and in his advocacy of some form of comprehensive medical supervision of all factories. In his later career he was hard-working and respected, especially by those in whose interests he was acting, but not innovative, as he had been during the heroic period of sanitary reform. The medical qualifications which at first gave him distinction tended later to restrict his outlook on what might be achieved in the field of occupational health.<br>
<br>Baker had a wife, Maria, who died in 1903. They had a numerous family, of whom four sons and four daughters were living in 1878. Baker died at home at Milverton Hill near Leamington Spa on 6 February 1880.<br>
