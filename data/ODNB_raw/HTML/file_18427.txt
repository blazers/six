<span class="headword">Mayer,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1583, <em>d.</em> 1664), <span class="occ">biblical commentator</span>, was baptized on 16 June 1583 at Long Melford, Suffolk, the son of John and Elizabeth Mayer. He had two brothers and five sisters, all younger than himself. He matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge, about 1597, but migrated to Emmanuel College, where he matriculated on 2 March 1598. He graduated BA in 1602, and proceeded MA in 1605, BD in 1612, and DD in 1627. He was rector of Little Wratting in Suffolk from 1609 until 1631, when he became rector of Raydon, near Hadleigh. About 1613 he married Anne, with whom he was to enjoy a partnership lasting fifty years. They had one surviving son, John.<br>
<br>Mayer produced over the course of a number of years an entire commentary on the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, drawing extensively on the work of other commentators and adding notes of his own. The publication of the work was delayed by what Mayer described as &#145;the Hierarchicall Government that then was&#146;  (J. Mayer, &#145;Dedicatorie&#146;, <span class="italic">A Commentary upon the Whole Old Testament</span>, 1653). It was published in seven volumes: 1, on the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>, 1653; 2, on the historical books, 1647; 3, on <span class="roman">Job</span>, the <span class="roman">Psalms</span>, <span class="roman">Proverbs</span>, <span class="roman">Ecclesiastes</span>, and the <span class="roman">Song of Solomon</span>, 1653 and again in 1659; 4, on the prophets, 1652; 5, on the gospels and <span class="roman">Acts</span>, 1631; 6, on the epistles of St Paul, 1631; 7, on the so-called catholic epistles and <span class="roman">Revelation</span>, in 1627 and 1631. Mayer believed in the saying <i>Bonus textuarius, bonus theologus</i> and produced the commentaries so that &#145;Students in Divinity may sooner become good Textmen, to give light into any place of Scripture&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Mayer's works are scholarly in tone and content, but aimed at an intelligent rather than necessarily educated audience. He wrote for those who &#145;not being professed Divines, yet, are studious of the Scriptures&#146;  (J. Mayer, &#145;To the reader&#146;, <span class="italic">A Commentarie upon the Foure Evangelists and the Acts of the Apostles</span>, 1631). Mayer flouted the convention of publishing works of this nature in Latin to restrict their audience to those with the education considered a prerequisite to comprehend such matters. He declared it desirable that the people become as well versed in the fathers and learned doctors of the church as the clergy.<br>
<br>Mayer was a determined opponent of both popery and forms of protestant extremism. His most popular publication was <span class="italic">An Antidote Against Popery</span>, which appeared in 1625 and was republished in 1627 and 1630. In 1647 he published <span class="italic">Christian Liberty Vindicated from Grave Mistakes, Occasioning so Great Divisions in England</span>. He denounced licentious behaviour conducted under the cloak of religion, declaring that Christian liberty was &#145;not a liberty to any evill or sinne, because this is no liberty, but servitude to corruption&#146;  (J. Mayer, <span class="italic">Christian Liberty</span>, 1647, 4). He also rejected the suggestion that the believer's best guide to the truth was his own conscience, affirming that a lawful assembly was the surest means of resolving contentious issues.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Mayer published a work dedicated to Charles II: <span class="italic">Unity Restored to the Church of England</span>. There he was bold enough to suggest to the new king the manner in which he should settle religious division in the country. He also took the opportunity to advertise another work, &#145;The history of the world from the creation to the year 1648&#146;, never published. His memorial stone in Raydon records that he also left in manuscript &#145;The topography of the three parts of the world, and the countries and most famous cities therein&#146;.<br>
<br>Mayer died at Raydon on 5 March 1664 and was buried there three days later. He left most of his estate to his wife and son, but also made provision for the extended members of his family and for the poorest families of Raydon. He left detailed instructions for a black marble memorial stone, with an inscription celebrating his ministry and his writings.<br>
