<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Norman, Sir  Richard Oswald Chandler</span>  (1932&#150;1993), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 27 April 1932 in Norbury, London, the only child of Oswald George Norman (1890&#150;1941), bank manager, and his wife, Violet Maud, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Chandler (1901&#150;1981). He was educated at Durston House preparatory school in Ealing, and St Paul's School, London. It was there that he became interested in science and caught an infectious enthusiasm for chemistry from Jack Strawson, who taught him in the upper school. He played cricket for the first eleven and subsequently became captain of the school. He won a Brackenbury scholarship in chemistry to Balliol College, Oxford, and matriculated in 1951. His career at Oxford was meteoric: he won the Gibbs scholarship in 1954 and obtained a top first in 1955. He then studied for his doctorate under W. A. (Alec) Waters, using continuous flow mixing techniques to study rapid free radical reactions. It was the influence of Waters and also of his other tutor, R. P. (Ronnie) Bell, that determined the course of much of the subsequent work that he did, both at Oxford and York.<br>
<br>In 1957, despite opposition from the chemical establishment, Norman was made a fellow of Merton College and rapidly built up a high-class research team. He also became a brilliant lecturer and an inspiring tutor. His abilities were recognized by Eric James, who persuaded Norman to start the chemistry department at the newly founded University of York. There Norman established an international reputation for the quality of his work on the mechanisms of organic reactions. This was further enhanced by his publication (with Roger Taylor) of <span class="italic">Electrophilic Substitution in Benzenoid Compounds</span> (1964) and (as sole author) <span class="italic">Principles of Organic Synthesis</span> (1968); the latter became a standard undergraduate text for the next two decades.<br>
<br>Norman was always intensely keen on teaching, both in the department at York and in the wider field of education in schools. <span class="italic">Modern Organic Chemistry</span> (1972), written in collaboration with David Waddington, brought an up-to-date rigour to A-level school chemistry and helped to make the chemistry department at York one of the most sought after in the country. He consolidated this interest by his work with the Salters' Company, who set up research grants for teachers and financed the new A-level courses, first in chemistry and subsequently in all three major sciences. Nor were his interests restricted to York: he was president of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, and of the Royal Society of Chemistry, formed after the amalgamation of the institute with the Chemical Society in 1980. On 30 December 1982 he married Jennifer Margaret Tope (<i>b</i>. 1942), a university administrator whom he met at the University of York. It was characteristic that they married quietly when on holiday in Jerusalem. There were no children. She proved to be an ideal companion for the extensive entertaining associated with Norman's work. Her wide interests, particularly in music, also provided a contrast to Norman's scientific work and helped make him accessible to a wider range of people.<br>
<br>In 1983 Norman became chief scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence and it was there that his capacity for getting the best results out of committee work became apparent. For him the role of the committee was publicly to endorse a consensus that had been arrived at by detailed and persuasive discussion with the main protagonists. In this way he cut through unnecessary red tape, quickly produced results, and alienated few people. A colleague emphasized the even-handed and impartial way he treated everyone; he was not a prime mover and shaker but if there was a consensus for change he speedily brought it to fruition. After five years as a civil servant Norman returned to Oxford as rector of Exeter College. He loved being close to students and took personal responsibility for them as tutor for graduates. He and his wife offered hospitality to every student every year, a quite remarkable achievement. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society in 1977 and appointed KBE in 1987.<br>
<br>Norman was of an athletic build. The large horn-rimmed glasses that he wore throughout his life gave him an owlish appearance and contributed to his aura of scholarly wisdom. He was warm-hearted and friendly, a convivial host who always found time to talk to everyone, making each of them feel individually valued. Apart from being a stylish cricketer and an accomplished bridge player, he was a keen gardener and an expert photographer, particularly in portraiture. When asked how he managed to become competent in so many fields he replied that after <i>reading</i> chemistry at Oxford, he could find out anything he wanted by using a book. His ability to digest large quantities of material, for example <span class="italic">Chemical Abstracts</span>, was phenomenal, and yet he tempered his intellectual powers with a humanity which made him accessible to a wide variety of people. He was a man of absolute integrity based on the Christian principles he learned early in his life. He had the happy knack of being at the right place at the right time, and could count on support from family, colleagues, and friends whenever he needed it. He had a happy and varied life, marred only by the shortness of time he had as rector of Exeter. He had an operation for cancer of the bile-duct in 1987 and this may have been the cause of the pulmonary embolism that struck him in June 1993. He died at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 6 June 1993. The chapel was so crowded at his funeral that many stood in the antechapel. He was cremated at Oxford on 14 June. On 27 September a memorial service was held in St Mary's, the university church, which was packed with friends, many going back to his schooldays.<br>
