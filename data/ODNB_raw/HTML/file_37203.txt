<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bodley,  John Edward Courtenay</span>  (1853&#150;1925), <span class="occ">writer on France</span>, was born on 6 June 1853 at King Street, Hanley, Staffordshire, the son of Edward Fisher Bodley, commercial traveller, and later a wealthy pottery owner, and his second wife, Mary Ridgway. Bodley was educated at Mill Hill School, London, and in 1873 matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford; his friends at Oxford included Oscar Wilde and Cecil Rhodes. He took a pass degree in 1877 (MA 1879). Called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1874, he practised as a barrister on the Oxford circuit, and then in June 1880 became political secretary to Sir Charles Dilke. His father was so disappointed at his abandoning law that he was disinherited in favour of a younger brother. In 1884 Dilke appointed Bodley as secretary of the royal commission on the housing of the working classes. Bodley wrote three reports on housing for England, Scotland, and Ireland, but his political hopes were dashed when Dilke was ruined by a divorce scandal in 1885.<br>
<br>Bodley visited South Africa in 1887&#150;8 and the United States and Canada in 1888&#150;9, meeting senior officials, politicians, and churchmen, and in 1890 he settled in France. The following year he married Evelyn Frances Bell, the daughter of John Bell of Rushpool Hall, Yorkshire; they had two sons (one of whom became a soldier and the other a painter) and a daughter, Ava, [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/109615/', "Anderson, Ava Courtney")</script>] who married the diplomat <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64932/', "Ralph Follett Wigram")</script>. Bodley's marriage ended in divorce in 1908.<br>
<br>Bodley began his literary career in France with the publication of <span class="italic">France</span> (1898), on French political institutions, which displayed an encyclopaedic knowledge of French local custom and tradition. It was followed by <span class="italic">L'anglomanie et les traditions fran&ccedil;aises</span> (1899) and the publication in 1906 of two lectures on the separation of church and state. <span class="italic">The Romance of the Battle-Line in France</span> (1919) recounted the historic associations of the departments ravaged in the First World War. Bodley was a corresponding member of the Institut de France (Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques), and contributed to the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span> articles on the history of the Third Republic. He knew France so well that Charles Maurras once described him as almost a Frenchman.<br>
<br>Cardinal H. E. Manning intended Bodley to be his biographer, but Bodley was absent in France when Manning died, and Edmund Sheridan Purcell guilefully secured the job for himself. Bodley drew Manning's portrait in <span class="italic">Cardinal Manning and other Essays</span> (1912), and wrote by royal command the official record of Edward VII's coronation (published 1903). The king personally rewarded him with the Royal Victorian Order, fourth class, but broke off relations when the disgruntled recipient returned it the following day.<br>
<br>In 1920 Bodley married Phyllis Helen Lomax, the daughter of the Revd Henry Joshua Lomax of Stoke Golding. He died at The Chestnuts, Haywards Heath, Sussex, on 28 May 1925; his wife survived him.<br>
<br>Bodley's life was one of disappointments, over Dilke's disgrace, the Manning biography, the coronation record, and the lack of English official acknowledgement of his work for Anglo-French relations. He failed to make a wholly satisfactory career.<br>
