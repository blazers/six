</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dowding,  Hugh Caswall Tremenheere</span>, first Baron Dowding  (1882&#150;1970), <span class="occ">air force officer</span>, was born in Moffat, Dumfriesshire, on 24 April 1882, eldest of the four children of Arthur John Caswall Dowding (1855?&#150;1932), founder and headmaster of St Ninian's preparatory school in Moffat, and his wife, Maud Caroline (1855?&#150;1934), daughter of Lieutenant-General Charles William Tremenheere, chief engineer in the public works department, Bombay presidency. Dowding's two brothers also made their mark: Arthur Ninian Dowding (1886&#150;1966) was superintendent of the Devonport naval dockyard from 1938 to 1945, and Kenneth Tremenheere Dowding (<i>b</i>. 1889) joined the Royal Flying Corps in 1914, qualified as a pilot, ended the war as a major and squadron commander, and was awarded the DFC in January 1919. Their sister, Hilda Dowding, never married.<h2>
<a name="ThehappiestdaysIndia19041910andStaffCollege"></a>The happiest days: India, 1904&#150;1910, and Staff College</h2>Dowding was educated at St Ninian's and, like his father, at Winchester College (1895&#150;9), but ancient Greek proved beyond him. Unable therefore to follow his father to New College, Oxford, he entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in September 1899 and was commissioned in the Royal Garrison Artillery on 18 August 1900. After service in Gibraltar, Ceylon, and Hong Kong, he transferred in 1904 to the mountain artillery based in Rawalpindi, India. The next six years, he assured both his biographers, were the happiest of his entire career: plenty of shooting, fishing, polo, and interesting military exercises in a grand country. During one such exercise, he and his men &#145;annihilated&#146; two companies of Gurkhas commanded by Cyril Newall, an officer who would later be preferred to him as head of the RAF.<br>
<br>Lieutenant Dowding was accepted by the Staff College, Camberley, in January 1912, having returned to England in 1911 with a year's leave on reduced pay in order to prepare for an exacting entrance examination. Promoted to captain on 18 August 1913, he learnt to fly (at his own expense, in his own time) at Brooklands, and was awarded a pilot's certificate&#151;after a mere 100 minutes in the air, few of them in sole charge&#151;by the Royal Aero Club on 20 December 1913, the day he passed out from Camberley. It was during these staff college years that he earned his lifelong nickname Stuffy, visited Switzerland, and began his lifelong addiction to skiing, a hobby which became an off-duty obsession.<h2>
<a name="Highlypromotedundervalued19141918"></a>Highly promoted, undervalued, 1914&#150;1918</h2>Dowding spent the first three months of 1914 at the Central Flying School, Upavon, where he became known to two officers who reached the highest air rank: John Salmond (his flying instructor) and Hugh Trenchard (assistant commandant). Neither Trenchard nor Salmond ever warmed to him&#151;few men did&#151;although they learnt to respect his uncompromising character, devotion to duty (as he saw it), and sheer professional knowledge. At the end of 1940, however, both men actively sought his removal from Fighter Command.<br>
<br>Dowding resumed his gunner career at Sandown, Isle of Wight, in April 1914, but transferred to the Royal Flying Corps on the outbreak of war in August. He was sent to Dover to organize the departure of four squadrons joining the British expeditionary force, and then to Farnborough, to help form 7 squadron. Persistent pestering finally provoked Trenchard into sending him abroad in October with 6 squadron&#151;but as an observer, not as a pilot. Although he soon regained pilot status, he never made a name in aerial combat, even though he was reputedly a fine shot. Perhaps he was too old (in his thirty-third year) to learn new tricks. Or perhaps, given his long experience of military procedures, he was considered too valuable an asset on the ground for such a new service to risk losing him in the air, where younger men were more at home.<br>
<br>He therefore found himself employed as a staff officer in France, but in January 1915 he managed a return to Brooklands to command (as a major, from March) a &#145;wireless experimental establishment&#146;. This appointment introduced him to the exciting challenges of rapid communication, a field in which his practical direction of the work of scientists and technicians would lie at the root of Britain's successful air defence system in 1940. His unit was charged to find a means of using Marconi's discovery (not yet twenty years old) that messages could be sent between two places without connecting cables. The military advantages for all armed services were obvious. Dowding claimed to be &#145;the first person, certainly in England if not in the world, to listen to a wireless telephone message from the air&#146;  (Collier, 103). Unfortunately, he was sent back to France in July 1915 and took no further part in this important work.<br>
<br>For six unhappy months he took command of 16 squadron, near Merville, some 18 miles west of Lille. In 1933 Duncan Grinnell-Milne, a squadron pilot, recorded his impressions of the major:<blockquote>He was efficient, strict and calm; he had a sense of duty. But he was too reserved and aloof from his juniors; he cared too much for his own job, too little for theirs &hellip; he was not a good pilot, seldom flew, and had none of that fire which I then believed and later knew to be essential in the leader of a good squadron. (Grinnell-Milne, 42&#150;3)</blockquote>Recalled to England in January 1916, Dowding was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and in June took command of 9 wing (responsible for four squadrons, under the eye of Trenchard himself) at Fienvillers (west of Albert on the Somme front) for six happier months, absorbed in problems of supply and replacement of men and equipment, and devising an efficient organization. He returned to England, was promoted to colonel in January 1917 and to brigadier-general in June, but never served in another operational theatre. Instead, he commanded southern training brigade in Salisbury until April 1918, and was then sent to York as chief staff officer to the RAF's senior administrative officer in that area.<br>
<br>Dowding married on 16 February 1918 Clarice Maud Vancourt, daughter of Captain John Williams of the Indian army and widow of an army officer named Vancourt who was killed before 1914. They had one child, a son. Clarice died suddenly on 28 June 1920.<br>
<br>The armistice in November 1918 seemed likely to mark the end of Dowding's aviation career, even though he was made a CMG in January 1919. He had quarrelled with Trenchard, soon to be confirmed as head of a very small post-war air force and influential in the choice of senior officers to be offered permanent commissions. Dowding believed that Trenchard's insistence on offensive action cost too many casualties for too little military advantage. He also believed that Trenchard failed to emphasize the need for sufficient realistic training before sending men into combat. For his part, Trenchard believed that Dowding's limitations as a field commander were not outweighed by any value he might have in post-war administrative, training, or technical appointments.<h2>
<a name="EarningTrenchardsrespect19191929"></a>Earning Trenchard's respect, 1919&#150;1929</h2>Trenchard, however, was persuaded to change his mind for once, perhaps because the demand for field commanders was likely to be small in the foreseeable future, and Dowding accepted a permanent commission on 1 August 1919 in the rank of group captain (equivalent to colonel in the army). As head of no. 1 group at Kenley from February 1920 he was responsible for two of Hendon's enormously popular annual air pageants: and nothing, he recalled, including presumably the darkest days of 1940, &#145;has ever induced in me a comparable state of prostration&#146;  (Wright, 46). Promoted to air commodore&#151;brigadier-general&#151;in January 1922, he served as chief staff officer at Inland Area headquarters, Uxbridge, from February 1923 and then at the headquarters of Iraq command, Baghdad, from September 1924.<br>
<br>Dowding's first influential post came in May 1926 when he was appointed director of training in the Air Ministry. Working closely with Trenchard in a demanding task which enthused him, he gradually earned that formidable man's respect, was made a CB in January 1928, and promoted to air vice-marshal a year later. Trenchard sent him to Palestine and Transjordan in September to study security problems in the light of Arab&#150;Jewish unrest. His long reports&#151;considered sensible and constructive by Trenchard&#151;paved the way for further elevation.<h2>
<a name="MemberoftheAirCouncil19301936"></a>Member of the Air Council, 1930&#150;1936</h2>The new decade began with a tragedy for which Dowding was partly responsible. He joined the Air Council in September 1930 as air member for supply and research, and one of his first acts was to sanction the issue of an airworthiness certificate to a new airship (the R101), which crashed on 5 October, killing forty-eight of those on board. He was aware of severe pressure to permit the flight&#151;intended to carry Lord Thomson, secretary of state for air, to India&#151;and accepted without question optimistic technical reports. &#145;I think I was wrong not to insist on much more extensive trials and tests&#146;, he later admitted  (Wright, 53).<br>
<br>In his new position Dowding soon became aware that dramatic improvements to the design, construction, and production of airframes and aero-engines were pending. These improvements coincided, from 1933 onwards, with a steadily growing fear that another major war was also pending. Although without scientific or technical training, he now confirmed (as his wireless experiments of 1915 suggested) that he had a rare capacity&#151;among senior RAF officers&#151;for grasping scientific and technical principles, and gave vital practical support to the work of experts, service or civilian.<br>
<br>Dowding was promoted to air marshal in January 1933 and made a KCB in June. In January 1935 his title was changed to air member for research and development, to reflect his actual responsibilities at a time of rapid expansion, when the RAF was receiving (and devising) new equipment on the ground as well as in the air. Matters of supply and organization were assigned to Newall.<br>
<br>Two single-engined monoplane fighters&#151;the Hurricane and the Spitfire&#151;were under development in 1934. They eventually had the unprecedented armament of eight wing-mounted machine-guns (no previous British fighter had more than two). Work also began on four-engined long-range bombers. Radios were improved and research into what became known as radar&#151;a method of detecting hostile aircraft at a distance&#151;was encouraged.<h2>
<a name="Organizinganairdefencesystem19361940"></a>Organizing an air defence system, 1936&#150;1940</h2>Dowding was appointed first head of the newly created Fighter Command in July 1936, with his headquarters at Bentley Priory in Stanmore, north-west London, and received his last promotion&#151;to air chief marshal&#151;in January 1937. There he prepared the world's first effective air defence system, based on two excellent fighter aircraft (some of which were assigned to photo-reconnaissance duties), two chains of coastal radar stations (one to detect high-flying intruders, the other to spot those approaching at low levels), and operations rooms, equipped to receive information not only from radar stations but also from members of a revived and ever-expanding observer corps. The human eye (assisted by binoculars) remained a necessary supplement to a fallible radar system, which in any case looked only seaward. Information came also from anti-aircraft gunners, and those working searchlights, barrage balloons, and wireless interception stations. Air-raid warning was controlled from Bentley Priory.<br>
<br>On Dowding's initiative, or with his active encouragement, fighters gradually received vital equipment: improved radios, bulletproof windscreens, armoured seats, self-sealing fuel tanks, and an electronic device to distinguish them from enemy fighters. Hard runways began to be constructed. If he had died <i>before</i> the battle of Britain was fought, &#145;his work in the field of technical development would place him high among his country's saviours&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 Feb 1970).<h2>
<a name="Togoornottogothatisthequestion19371940"></a>To go or not to go, that is the question: 1937&#150;1940</h2>Dowding learnt in February 1937 that he had been passed over for the RAF's highest office&#151;chief of the air staff (CAS)&#151;in favour of Cyril Newall, who succeeded Sir Edward Ellington in September. He was somewhat consoled in July by a most unusual elevation for an airman, the GCVO. His personal grief turned out to be a national blessing, however, as he himself later recognized. He had all the qualities needed at Fighter Command, few of those needed in Whitehall, and during the next three critical years he and Newall proved to be round pegs in round holes.<br>
<br>Even so, it was Newall who advised Dowding in July 1938 that he must leave his command in June 1939. He would by then have held it for three years (longer than many appointments) and Newall was justified in wishing to promote a younger officer to replace one past his fifty-seventh birthday. The ever-escalating crisis with Germany (and hindsight) may make that decision seem unwise, but it is the subsequent dithering in the Air Ministry&#151;resulting in brief extensions of his tenure, tardily notified&#151;that merits criticism. He was to have been replaced by Christopher Courtney, an officer without air defence experience.<br>
<br>In June 1939, shortly before he was injured in an aircraft accident, Courtney learnt that he would not now take over Fighter Command until 1 April 1940. He was in fact appointed air member for supply and organization in January 1940, and remained in that position for the rest of the war. On 31 March 1940, the day before Dowding expected to leave Bentley Priory, he was invited by Newall to stay on for a further fifteen weeks, until 14 July. Newall wrote again, on 5 July, to ask him to remain in office until the end of October. In view of Britain's desperate situation, Fighter Command's key role in remedying it (and his own conviction that he was still the best man available for the job), Dowding asked to remain in office until 24 April 1942, his sixtieth birthday, unless the war ended before then, or he wished to leave. Both Newall and Sir Archibald Sinclair (secretary of state for air) apologized for past discourtesy, and on 13 August 1940 Newall informed him that he was to remain in office indefinitely  (Wright, 138&#150;43, 158).<h2>
<a name="ThebattleofBritain"></a>The battle of Britain</h2>&#145;Since I was a child&#146;, Dowding later recalled, &#145;I have never accepted ideas purely because they were orthodox, and consequently I have frequently found myself in opposition to generally-accepted views&#146;, adding, somewhat smugly, &#145;Perhaps, in retrospect, this has not been altogether a bad thing&#146;  (Collier, title-page). His opinions, he believed, were soundly based; once they were formed and expressed, he proved most reluctant to change them. He argued forcefully and constantly that the needs of his command should prevail over those of any other&#151;and, indeed, over any other branch of the armed services, except those of the Royal Navy. Britain's security, resting on command of the air and sea approaches, must have absolute priority over offensive action.<br>
<br>He therefore resisted using fighters, especially Spitfires, to support operations in France. Their presence could not affect the issue there, whereas their absence from the home base would leave Britain vulnerable to invasion. On 16 May 1940, when a German invasion&#151;then in its seventh day&#151;was sweeping virtually unchecked through western Europe, he wrote out his case against sending more fighters to France in what has become a famous letter to the Air Ministry, often quoted. The framed original now hangs in the RAF College at Cranwell. It is less well known that Newall attached this letter to a clear statement on air defence weakness which he circulated to his fellow chiefs of staff that same day. Fighter Command, he argued, could give no further assistance to France:<blockquote>if we are to have any chance of protecting the United Kingdom, the Fleet, our sea-borne trade, our aircraft industry, and all the vital centres throughout the country on which we must depend for our ability to continue the war. (Wright, 116)</blockquote>Dowding appeared before the cabinet on 3 June to reinforce that statement. The Dunkirk evacuation was then drawing to a close and no more fighters were sent to France.<br>
<br>Dowding delegated the actual conduct of the battle to his group commanders, especially to Keith Park, his second in command at Bentley Priory from July 1938 until April 1940, when he went to Uxbridge, west London, as head of no. 11 group, the most important of the command's four subdivisions, covering London and south-east England. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, head of no. 12 group in central England, advocated the use of large formations&#151;three or more squadrons working together in a single wing&#151;but most historians agree that these were ill-suited to defensive fighting because they took so long to assemble and move into action; they were also difficult to control, either from the ground or in the air. Park disagreed strongly with Leigh-Mallory's tactics and Dowding failed to decide between them.<br>
<br>The system, nevertheless, withstood the German challenge admirably. That said, German errors made a major contribution to Fighter Command's avoidance of defeat. The German assault, hastily mounted, suffered from inept leadership, faulty tactics, and poor target selection, as a result of inadequate intelligence information about either Fighter Command's organization or the key centres of British industry. German bombers were incapable of carrying a devastating load and German fighters lacked the range to afford them continuous escort or to engage British fighters in prolonged combat.<br>
<br>The daytime assault had been rebuffed by mid-September, and the Germans then mounted a much more destructive night offensive. But Fighter Command was neither equipped nor trained for night fighting. In Park's words, tactics at night were &#145;those of a cat stalking a mouse rather than a greyhound chasing a hare&#146;  (Orange, 116). Different aircraft, aircrews, ground organization, methods of control, and, above all, a radar set small enough to be carried in an aircraft, were needed, but not yet available. A night air defence committee was formed in September 1940, chaired by Salmond. Both Salmond and most members&#151;among them Wilfrid Freeman, Arthur Tedder, and Sholto Douglas&#151;wanted a new commander in Bentley Priory.<br>
<br>Dowding was undermined by his antipathy to those who worked in the Air Ministry; his blunt resistance to suggestions made by Salmond's committee; his failure to control his group commanders; his vocal enthusiasm for Lord Beaverbrook, minister of aircraft production (hated, as he well knew, by most senior officers); the active opposition of Trenchard and Salmond behind the scenes; the alarming success of German night bombers; and a strong feeling that it was time for new blood.<h2>
<a name="Removedretiredrewarded19401943"></a>Removed, retired, rewarded: 1940&#150;1943</h2>Dowding was informed by Sinclair on 13 November 1940 that he must go, but Sir Charles Portal (who had succeeded Newall as CAS in October) asked him to stay on until 25 November, when Douglas&#151;deputy CAS&#151;took over. Leigh-Mallory succeeded Park at no. 11 group in December. At that time Britain was suffering severe nightly attack, aerial defences were evidently impotent, and winter had hardly begun. Come the spring, a heavier and better managed daytime attack was likely. Consequently, the mood in governing circles, air force or civilian, was more fearful of future destruction than grateful for past deliverance. It was a time for new faces and new methods. Few who knew Dowding regretted his impending departure&#151;sweetened, incidentally, in October with yet another honour, the GCB.<br>
<br>In June 1943 Dowding became the first RAF officer since Trenchard in 1919 to be offered a barony. Accepting, he most appropriately added the territorial designation Bentley Priory to his title. He might also have been promoted to the highest rank&#151;marshal of the RAF&#151;at that time, when the significance of the battle of Britain as a turning point in the war was already obvious. Quite apart from the recognition, the promotion would almost have doubled his income. But he was overlooked, as he was again in January 1946, when Arthur Harris and Sholto Douglas were elevated despite an alleged prohibition against officers who had not served as CAS. He was, however, offered and refused a highly desirable appointment as governor of Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), and he expressed disdain&#151;&#145;guinea pigging&#146;, he called it&#151;when directorships in the City of London were mentioned. In 1957 he declared in a preface to the first biography of him that he had &#145;no sense of grievance&#146;  (Collier, 12) over his removal from Fighter Command. But a decade later, while co-operating with Robert Wright in the writing of another biography, he was encouraged&#151;or decided&#151;to tell a very different story.<br>
<br>Dowding was persuaded by Churchill and Beaverbrook to go to the United States in 1940 on an ill-defined mission to look into the purchase or production for Britain of American aircraft or engines. A delicate task, it required diplomatic and commercial skills that he conspicuously lacked. As early as 25 March 1941 Lord Halifax (British ambassador to the United States) asked Churchill to send him home because he was expressing personal views in contradiction of official policy. By June he was back in England and took up the more congenial task of composing a detailed account of the battle. Completed in October, it was published in 1946. Churchill then found him another delicate task&#151;inquiring into the RAF's economic management&#151;which he thankfully abandoned in July 1942, when he actually retired.<h2>
<a name="Acontentedspiritualistvegetarianandicon"></a>A contented spiritualist, vegetarian, and icon</h2>Churchill barred publication until 1946 of Dowding's essay, <span class="italic">Twelve Legions of Angels</span>, the last work he wrote based on his military experience. From 1942 onwards he gradually became as single-mindedly devoted to spiritualism as he had once been to the organization and equipment of Fighter Command. He was also attracted by theosophy, a movement seeking some universal truth supposed to be common to all religions. He published four books on these themes: <span class="italic">Many Mansions</span> (1943), <span class="italic">Lychgate</span> (1945), <span class="italic">God's Magic</span> (1946), <span class="italic">The Dark Star</span> (1951), and became a regular lecturer on occult subjects. His &#145;very unfashionable&#146; retirement interests, as he described them, &#145;may appear to the orthodox as being strange, heretical and, still worse, &#147;non-U&#148;&#146;  (Collier, 12); they included belief in fairies, flying saucers, and the possibility of intelligent communication between the living and the dead.<br>
<br>Dowding married again, at Caxton Hall on 25 September 1951; his second wife was Muriel (1908&#150;1993), [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51842/', "Dowding, Muriel")</script>] daughter of John Albino and widow of Jack Maxwell Whiting (a flight engineer in Bomber Command, killed in 1944). Muriel shared her new husband's spiritual beliefs, and converted him to her own hatred of cruelty to animals. He gave up shooting and became a vegetarian, and they lived contentedly at her home, 1 Calverley Park, Tunbridge Wells.<br>
<br>Dowding was elected president of the Battle of Britain Fighter Association and regularly attended its reunions, at which he was regarded as a revered icon. During the summer of 1968, he visited Hawkinge, an airfield near Folkestone, where scenes for a film about the battle were being shot. Dowding was portrayed by Laurence Olivier, Park by Trevor Howard. Dowding told Howard: &#145;If it hadn't been for Keith Park's conduct in the battle, and his loyalty to me as his Commander-in-Chief, we should not be here today&#146;  (Wright, 281). His last public appearance was at the London premi&egrave;re of that film in September 1969. Sadly crippled by arthritis and confined to a wheelchair, he was given a standing ovation by some 350 of his former pilots: &#145;Dowding's chicks&#146;, as Churchill called them. He died at his home on 15 February 1970 and his ashes reside below the battle of Britain memorial window in the RAF chapel, Westminster Abbey. His son, Derek Hugh Tremenheere Dowding (1919&#150;1992), who served as a fighter pilot during the battle of Britain and retired as a wing commander in 1956, succeeded him as second Baron Dowding.<br>
<br>For good or ill, Dowding was not a man to compromise, thereby provoking anger, exasperation, respect, and devotion&#151;sometimes all of these in a single day&#151;but he was also a man who cared deeply about casualties and always did his best to keep these down. Although well read, with a dry wit, he was too abstemious and intensely serious to be easy company, even off duty. He had no ready flow of words and did not impress in debate across a table, preferring instead to state his case or to give instruction in writing: always cogently, often bluntly, and sometimes offensively. His appearance matched his personality: upright, lean, correct, unsmiling. He mellowed in his last years, cherished by Muriel, but the &#145;loving-kindness&#146; he then radiated was &#145;redeemed from mawkishness by a sense of fun and an undimmed eye for human foibles&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 Feb 1970). The queen mother unveiled a statue of him outside St Clement Danes (a church specially dedicated to the RAF) in the Strand, London, on 30 October 1988. His expression blends &#145;surprise, severity and faint disapproval&#146; of this ultimate elevation  (Ray, 7).<br>
