<span class="headword">Tirel,  Walter</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1130), <span class="occ">courtier and landowner</span>, was the son and heir of another Walter Tirel and was lord of Poix in Picardy, some 17 miles south-west of Amiens, and Domesday lord of Langham, Essex. He was a vassal of the count of Pontoise and Amiens and held his English estate of his father-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5445/', "Richard de Clare")</script>. Walter Tirel is described by some contemporary authorities as having fired the arrow that killed King William Rufus. But Suger of St Denis and John of Salisbury both report that in later years Walter denied the allegation, at a time when (as Suger observes) &#145;he had nothing to fear or gain&#146;. Walter declared repeatedly that he had not so much as seen Rufus in the New Forest on the day of his death and had not set foot in the part of the forest where Rufus was hunting. Theories of an assassination conspiracy involving Walter Tirel, Henry I, and the Clare family are not supported by contemporary evidence and are no longer taken seriously.<br>
<br>Walter Tirel was a friend of Anselm, abbot of Bec, who, on a visit to Poix of uncertain date, correctly prophesied the unexpected arrival of a large sturgeon for their dinner. Anselm's visit is one of several indications of Walter's association with the abbey of Bec. The connection probably resulted from the close relationship between the abbey and the family of Walter's wife, Adeliza de Clare, who spent her widowhood at Conflans, a daughter house of Bec, and whose brother Richard had been a monk of Bec before becoming abbot of Ely. The Clares were benefactors of Bec itself and also founded the Bec priories of St Neot's, Huntingdonshire, and Stoke by Clare, Suffolk.<br>
<br>Walter Tirel was active in both France and England. William of Malmesbury reports that he was on the friendliest of terms with William Rufus, who brought him from France to his court in England. He was clearly at Rufus's court at the time of the king's death on 2 August 1100 and was doubtless in Rufus's company at other times as well, although he attests no surviving royal charters. But he is also known to have entered into an agreement with the count of Pontoise and Amiens in 1087 and he was in attendance at the French royal court in 1091. His two major monastic foundations were both French: the abbey of St Pierre de Selincourt, and the priory of St Denis de Poix to which he granted two marks annually from the tithes of Langham in Essex.<br>
<br>Walter had presumably died by 1130: the pipe roll of that year records Langham, Essex, as being held by his wife (or widow) Adeliza. Their lands at Poix and Langham passed to their son and heir, Hugh, who subsequently sold Langham to Henry of Cornhill on joining the second crusade in 1147.<br>
