<span class="headword">Thorpe <span class="st"> [Thorp]</span>,  Thomas</span>  (1571/2&#150;1625?), <span class="occ">bookseller</span>, was born in Barnet, Middlesex, the son of Thomas Thorpe, innkeeper. On 24 June 1584 he was apprenticed as a stationer for nine years to Richard Watkins, co-holder of the patent on almanacs and prognostications, and he was admitted as a freeman of the Stationers' Company on 4 February 1594. On 19 March 1597, giving his address as St Faith's parish and his age as twenty-five, Thorpe testified that the previous autumn he had been in Madrid as a guest of the fugitive Jesuit Father Robert Persons, and had stayed in the house of the recently deceased Catholic fugitive Sir Francis Englefield.<br>
<br>In 1600 Thorpe surfaces as the author of a dedication addressed to his &#145;kind and true friend&#146;, the publisher Edward Blount, attached to Christopher Marlowe's translation of the first book of Lucan's <span class="italic">Pharsalia</span>. The rights to this translation had previously passed through four other stationers, including Blount, but Thorpe's is the earliest known edition. In the dedication Thorpe depicts Marlowe as a ghost haunting St Paul's Churchyard through his posthumous publications, and also humorously instructs Blount how to be a literary patron, telling his friend to &#145;sweat with the invention of some dry jest or two&#146;, but in the end, &#145;give nothing&#146;  (Marlowe, 261&#150;2).<br>
<br>The first three publications with Thorpe's name on the title-page, all dated 1603, include two pamphlets about the East India Company (reflecting his long-standing interest in exploration) and a speech by Richard Martin. Two of these were originally entered in the Stationers' register to William Aspley, and all were sold in Aspley's shop, in which Thorpe may have worked. Aspley had previously published several plays (including two by Shakespeare), and in partnership with Thorpe he published two which became best-sellers: John Marston's <span class="italic">The Malcontent</span> (1604), and <span class="italic">Eastward Ho!</span> (1605), by Marston, Ben Jonson, and George Chapman. On his own, Thorpe subsequently published many important dramatic texts by Marston, Jonson, and Chapman. These included Marston's <span class="italic">What you Will</span> (1607) and <span class="italic">Histriomastix</span> (1610); Jonson's <span class="italic">Sejanus</span> (1605, with Blount), <span class="italic">Hymenaei</span> (1606), <span class="italic">Volpone</span> (1607), and <span class="italic">The Character of Two Royal Masques</span> (1608); and Chapman's <span class="italic">All Fools</span> (1605), <span class="italic">The Gentleman Usher</span> (1606), and <span class="italic">Charles, Duke of Biron</span> (1608). For the most part these are excellent texts, almost certainly authorized by the playwrights. The survival of two presentation copies of <span class="italic">Sejanus</span>, plus the fact that the notoriously demanding Jonson used the quarto text virtually unchanged in his 1616 folio <span class="italic">Works</span>, show how satisfied he was with Thorpe's work.<br>
<br>In 1609 Thorpe published the work for which he is known to posterity: <span class="italic">Shake-speares Sonnets</span>. Despite the claims of commentators uncomfortable with the sequence's homoeroticism, there is no indication that the volume was surreptitious or unauthorized. It was entered normally in the Stationers' register on 20 May, and it fits well with the authorized volumes Thorpe published for other theatre people. It was published during a plague outbreak which closed the theatres, as Shakespeare's narrative poems had been, and is structurally similar to earlier published sonnet sequences by Sidney, Spenser, Daniel, and Lodge, as Duncan-Jones demonstrates. Like earlier sonnet sequences by Barnabe Barnes, Henry Constable, and others, it also contains a dedication written by the stationer (Thorpe) rather than by the poet. This epigraph, addressed by Thorpe to &#145;the onlie begetter of these insuing sonnets Mr. W. H.&#146;  (sig. A2<i>r</i>) has occasioned volumes of speculation on the identity of W. H., but no consensus. Some critics have taken &#145;begetter&#146; to mean the &#145;procurer&#146; who brought the manuscript to Thorpe, but none of the various candidates has attracted widespread support. Others have taken &#145;begetter&#146; to mean &#145;inspirer&#146;, or the young man addressed in the sonnets; here the two main candidates have been Henry Wriothesley, earl of Southampton, and William Herbert, earl of Pembroke, the latter notably championed by Duncan-Jones. Others have found none of these solutions satisfactory. Foster points out that &#145;begetter&#146; always meant &#145;author&#146; in dedications of the time, and suggests that Thorpe was addressing Shakespeare, with &#145;our ever-living poet&#146; being God.<br>
<br>On 18 January 1609 Thorpe entered in the Stationers' register <span class="italic">A Discovery of a New World</span>, John Healey's translation of Joseph Hall's <span class="italic">Mundus alter et idem</span>, but he later transferred the rights to Edward Blount and William Barret, who published it with the earl of Pembroke's financial assistance. The following year, Thorpe, Blount, and Barret jointly published Healey's translation of <span class="italic">Epictetus his Manuall and Cebes his Table</span>. For this volume Thorpe wrote a dedication to John Florio in which he praises Pembroke's earlier generosity to Healey, and asks for Florio's help in securing Pembroke's support for &#145;a greater body of Saint Augustines&#146;, to which the present volume is merely a &#145;hand-maide&#146;  (sig. A3<i>v</i>&#150;A4<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>The &#145;greater body&#146; was Healey's translation of St Augustine's <span class="italic">City of God</span>, which Thorpe published later in 1610 in an elaborate folio edition. Thorpe dedicated the volume to Pembroke in his characteristic witty and punning style, telling him that before departing for Virginia &#145;your late imaginery, but now actuall Travailer&#146; (Healey) had asked Thorpe to deliver the book &#145;to your Honours humbly thrise-kissed hands&#146;  (sig. A3&#150;A3<i>v</i>). In 1616, after Healey had died in Virginia, Thorpe published a second edition of <span class="italic">Epictetus his Manuall</span> with Healey's translation of Theophrastus' <span class="italic">Characters</span> added, and with an apologetic and self-deprecating dedication to Pembroke replacing the earlier dedication to Florio.<br>
<br>Between 1610 and 1615 Thorpe published several more religious works, alongside lighter fare such as the collection <span class="italic">Odcombian Banquet</span> (1611) and works by Thomas Nashe, John Taylor, and Humphrey King. In 1612 he published <span class="italic">A Funerall Elegy for Master William Peter</span> by W. S., a poem which Foster argued was written by Shakespeare but which is now generally accepted as the work of John Forde. Over the last decade of his career Thorpe's publications were mostly of a religious nature. Three of these contain unsigned prefaces almost certainly written by Thorpe: Arthur Dent's <span class="italic">Hand-Maid of Repentance</span> (1614), John van Oldenbarneveld's <span class="italic">Apology</span> (1618), and Theophilus Field's <span class="italic">A Christian's Preparation</span> (1622). In late 1623 Thorpe began receiving a pension from the Stationers' Company poor fund, indicating that he had fallen on hard times. His last publication was in 1625, and at the end of that year he stopped receiving his pension, presumably because he had died.<br>
<br>Thorpe may be the Thomas Thorpe who married Susan Hack on 12 July 1609 at St James Clerkenwell, London, and who had a son Robert baptized there on 17 August 1616. He may also be the Thomas Thorpe who had a son Thomas baptized at St Stephen, Coleman Street on 11 May 1610. However, he is probably the Thomas Thorpe of St Olave, Southwark, London, whose wife Dorcas was granted administration of his estate on 30 July 1625.<br>
