<span class="headword">Queen's Maries</span>  (<em>act. </em>1548&#150;1567) <span class="occ"></span>were four small girls chosen to be maids of honour to five-year-old <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18248/', "Mary, queen of Scots")</script>, when she was sent to France in 1548 as the fianc&eacute;e of the dauphin Fran&ccedil;ois. All four came from well-known Scottish families with royal connections. The mother of <a name="cosubject_70082"></a><span class="headword">Mary Fleming</span>  (1542&#150;<em>c.</em>1600)<span class="occ"></span> was both the young queen's governess and her aunt, for Lady Fleming was an illegitimate daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14590/', "James IV")</script>. <a name="cosubject_70083"></a><span class="headword">Mary Seton</span>  (<em>b. </em><em>c.</em>1541, <em>d.</em> after 1615)<span class="occ"></span> and <a name="cosubject_70080"></a><span class="headword">Mary Beaton</span>  (<em>c.</em>1543&#150;1597)<span class="occ"></span> were daughters of French ladies-in-waiting to the queen's mother, Mary of Guise. Marie Pieris, mother of Mary Seton, married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25120/', "George Seton, fourth Lord Seton")</script>, as his second wife; Jeanne de la Reinville, mother of Mary Beaton, married Robert Beaton of Creich, himself a page of honour from a family with a long tradition of royal service. Alexander, fifth Lord Livingston, and his wife, Lady Agnes Douglas, guardians of the queen, were the parents of <a name="cosubject_70081"></a><span class="headword">Mary Livingston</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1585)<span class="occ"></span>. Contemporaries frequently commented upon the coincidence of all four girls sharing the same first name, but Alexander Jamieson, the nineteenth-century lexicographer, linked the term &#145;Maries&#146; to the Icelandic word &#145;maer&#146;, meaning a virgin or maid.<br>
<br>When Mary, queen of Scots, arrived at the French court Henri II, though delighted with her, was dismayed that she did not speak French. Believing that she would forget her own country more quickly if she were surrounded by French ladies, he sent the Maries to Poissy to be educated under the supervision of the Dominican abbess Fran&ccedil;oise de Vieuxpont, but their separation from the queen seems to have been brief. On their return to Scotland with her in 1561 the Maries were obviously her close friends and confidantes, often sleeping in her bedchamber, as was the custom of the time. Elegant, sophisticated, and sumptuously dressed, they attracted admiring attention wherever they went. The English ambassador Thomas Randolph thought Mary Beaton the most beautiful, but Mary Fleming dazzled him at the twelfth night festivities of 1564, when she took the principal role, wearing diamonds and cloth of silver.<br>
<br>In 1565 Mary, queen of Scots, said that she was marrying off her Maries and had a mind to take another husband herself. On 6 March Mary Livingston became the wife of John (<i>d</i>. 1583), son of Robert, third Lord Sempill, the queen having provided not only the dowry and the wedding dress but a magnificent scarlet bed; on 29 July she herself married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26473/', "Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley (1545/6&#150;1567)")</script>. The following April the court celebrated Mary Beaton's marriage to Alexander Ogilvy of Boyne. Mary Seton showed no interest in matrimony, but the vivacious Mary Fleming had a string of suitors, and on 6 January 1568, after a long courtship, she married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17838/', "William Maitland")</script> of Lethington, the queen's secretary of state, a widower eighteen years older than she.<br>
<br>A month later Darnley was murdered at Kirk o' Field and the queen married James, earl of Bothwell. Mary Seton was with her when she surrendered to her rebellious lords at Carberry Hill. She and Mary Livingston accompanied the queen on her ignominious return to Edinburgh and they attended her during her imprisonment in Lochleven Castle. When the queen tried to escape, disguised as a washerwoman, she gave her long black dress to Mary Seton, who put it on and prepared to impersonate her until she could get safely away. The attempt failed, but after the queen's eventual escape, defeat at Langside, and imprisonment in England, Mary Seton once more became her companion and won praise for her skill at daily devising new hairstyles for her. The other Maries remained in Scotland.<br>
<br>Mary Seton had at least two suitors during her time in England. During her stay at Wingfield Manor, Sir Richard Norton's son Christopher wanted to marry her but was executed after his involvement in the northern rising. The master of the queen's household, Andrew Beaton, had also fallen in love with Mary Seton but she was reluctant, telling him that she had taken a vow of chastity; he died just as it seemed that she was changing her mind. In poor health Mary retired to Rheims in 1583 to spend the rest of her life in the abbey of St Pierre aux Dames, where the abbess, Ren&eacute;e de Lorraine, was an aunt of the Scottish queen. The longest lived of the four Maries, she eventually died there some time after 1615.<br>
<br>Mary Livingston died in 1585, two years before Mary's execution. Her eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25073/', "Sir James Sempill")</script>, was James VI's ambassador to the English court. Mary Beaton lived until 1597. It has been suggested that either she, or Mary Fleming and her husband, Maitland of Lethington, may have forged the notorious casket letters, but that is pure speculation. Mary Fleming was with her husband during his long illness and when he finally died, in 1573, after the fall of Edinburgh Castle to English and Scottish forces, she successfully pleaded with William Cecil for her husband's body to be given a decent burial instead of being put on display at his trial for treason, as would otherwise have happened. A month later she was refusing to give up a diamond and ruby chain belonging to Queen Mary, which was now being claimed by the representatives of King James. She devoted herself to bringing up her son and daughter and, having outlived her husband by many years, and having at some stage married, secondly, George Meldrum of Fyvie, she died about 1600.<br>
<br>The identity of the four Maries has been the subject of much confusion, thanks to a ballad entitled &#145;Marie Hamilton&#146;, which arguably dates from the eighteenth century. It tells the apocryphal tale of one of Queen Mary's ladies-in-waiting having an affair with Lord Darnley, drowning her illegitimate child, and going to the gallows with the poignant words:<blockquote>
<div>Yestreen the queen had four Maries<br>
</div>
<div>This night she'll ha'e but three<br>
</div>
<div>There was Marie Seaton and Marie Beaton<br>
</div>
<div>And Marie Carmichael and me.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In 1802&#150;3 Sir Walter Scott published this ballad in his <span class="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</span>. Realizing that there had been no such person as Marie Hamilton in Mary's retinue he believed that the tale derived from an incident related in John Knox's <span class="italic">History of the Reformation</span>, in which one of the queen's waiting women was executed for murdering her illegitimate child by the royal apothecary. C. K. Sharpe, the antiquarian who had collected the ballad and given it to Scott in the first place, more plausibly linked it with Mary Hamilton, a Scotswoman at the court of Peter the Great, who had an affair with the tsar, killed the resulting infant (and her two other illegitimate children), and was executed on 14 March 1719.<br>
<br>In the nineteenth century the final section of the ballad, beginning with the famous verse quoted above, was lifted from it and published separately as &#145;The Four Maries&#146;. It became very popular, and ever since then the fictitious Mary Hamilton and Mary Carmichael have displaced the real Mary Fleming and Mary Livingston in the minds of many people, despite the publication of Thomas Duncan's authoritative article in the <span class="italic">Scottish Historical Review</span> for 1905, pointing out that the ballad has nothing to do with the historical four Maries. However even without this highly-coloured and irrelevant tale of adultery and infanticide the notion of the four small childhood companions of Scotland's tragic queen has caught the public imagination, and they are still remembered as romantic figures after more than four centuries.<br>
