<span class="headword">Newsome,  Stella Winifred</span>  (1889&#150;1969), <span class="occ">women's activist</span>, was born on 28 July 1889 at 3 Museum Terrace, Leicester, the daughter of George Newsome (1841&#150;1909), wholesale grocer, and his wife, Caroline Louisa Rice (<i>b</i>. 1859). Little is known of her childhood and education, though by profession she was a schoolteacher. Newsome's life was shaped by her twin commitment to campaigning for women's equality and creating a historic record of feminist activity. She became involved in the Leicester branch of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) about 1911. Under the direction of its local organizer, Margaret West, she took part in militant activities, setting light to pillar boxes and raiding golf courses. Like other members of the WSPU she was angered by the halt to suffrage activity during the First World War and disapproved of Christabel Pankhurst's jingoism. As a result she left the union.<br>
<br>About 1916 Newsome moved to London and may have worked with the Borough branch of the United Suffragists. She went on to join the Women's Freedom League, and became secretary to its mid-London branch. In the 1930s she served on its executive committee, and between 1954 and 1958 was honorary secretary to the organization. After the extension of the franchise in 1918 Newsome campaigned to secure a new position for women based on economic and social equality. In November 1920 the National Federation of Women Teachers called a demonstration on the issue of equal pay for equal work: Newsome was a member and, in the run-up to the march, spoke on the issue to London women's organizations. She was not a high-profile activist, but worked hard behind the scenes. For many years she was an executive member of the Six Point Group, and focused particularly on broadening the educational opportunities of girls.<br>
<br>From the mid-1940s to her death, Newsome was secretary to the Suffragette Fellowship and effectively its archivist. She placed high value on documenting the movement and commemorating its participants. In 1954, with Edith How-Martyn and Elsa Gye, she compiled the commemorative roll of honour to suffragette prisoners. She was secretary to the Pethick-Lawrence Portrait Fund, and contributed many suffragette obituaries to <span class="italic">Calling All Women</span>&#151;the fellowship's journal. As part of the celebrations marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Women's Freedom League she wrote an account of its history: <span class="italic">Women's Freedom League, 1907&#150;1957</span> (1957).<br>
<br>Newsome was active right up until her premature death. Shortly after the fellowship celebrated her eightieth birthday she was involved in a road accident from which she never regained consciousness. She died unmarried on 11 November 1969 at her home, 26 West End Lane, West Hampstead, London, and was cremated at Golders Green on 24 November.<br>
