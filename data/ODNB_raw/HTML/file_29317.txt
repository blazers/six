<span class="headword">Whitlock,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1624, <em>d.</em> 1708), <span class="occ">presbyterian minister</span>, was baptized on 23 January 1624 at St Peter-le-Poer, London, the third son of Richard Whitlock, merchant, of London, and his wife, Catherine (1596&#150;1649), daughter of David Burdet of Wye in Kent. On 23 June 1642 he was admitted as a pensioner to Emmanuel College, Cambridge; he graduated BA in 1646 and proceeded MA in 1649. During his years at Cambridge he established a lifelong friendship with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23444/', "William Reynolds (1625&#150;1698)")</script>, with whom he shared future ministries. Appointed to the living of Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, in November 1646, he was joined by Reynolds in the following month. Together they also supplied the pulpit at Wokingham in Berkshire in 1647 and Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire in 1649. Both men refused to take the engagement in 1649, which led to their being deprived of their posts. <br>
<br>Whitlock's unwillingness to associate with the republican authorities created a favourable impression with the more conservative members of Nottingham's ruling body. In 1651 the marquess of Dorchester presented him to the living of St Mary's, Nottingham. Reynolds was appointed as his assistant, serving as lecturer. They were instructed to establish a &#145;Presbytery in the town as soon as they could prove and clear the way&#146;  (Carpenter, 22). In October 1651 both men were ordained according to the presbyterian discipline at St Andrew Undershaft in London. Not until 1655, with the establishment of John Barret at St Peter's Church, was a classis established within Nottingham. Whitlock attended all but one of the classis meetings over the next four years and served on several occasions as secretary. This &#145;three-fold cord&#146; of Barret, Reynolds, and Whitlock was to be prominent in the establishment and consolidation of presbyterianism within Nottingham. Whitlock enjoyed considerable links with presbyterians across the country. On 25 March 1652 he married Mary, daughter of the minister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27794/', "Anthony Tuckney")</script>. <br>
<br>At the Restoration Whitlock was indicted for not reading common prayer and on 6 July 1662 his living was sequestered, a full month before the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> took effect. Making his farewell sermon to his congregation he declared he would begin a policy of &#145;preaching by silence&#146;, that is to refrain from public preaching. Although he continued to teach privately at conventicles over the proceeding years, it was not until the declaration of indulgence of 1672 that he took out public preaching licences as a presbyterian for Mansfield and Nottingham. After his ejection Sir John Musters offered Whitlock and Reynolds accommodation and a degree of protection at Colwick Hall. There Whitlock ministered to a conventicle of over 200 persons, according to a report given to the county lieutenant on 6 September 1663. In the same year he published <span class="italic">England's Remembrancer</span>, a collection of farewell sermons by Nottingham's ejected clergy. In 1665 he and Reynolds were imprisoned for twelve weeks in the Black Moor's Head in Nottingham for preaching. As a consequence of the <span class="roman">Five Mile Act</span> of the same year the two men and their families moved to Shirebrook in Derbyshire, and in 1668 to Mansfield in Nottinghamshire. As the town was not a corporate borough, it proved to be a safe haven, and Whitlock enjoyed the friendship of Lord Wharton who often stayed with him on his journeys to the north. <br>
<br>Although Whitlock and Reynolds were imprisoned for five months in 1685 after entering the borough town of Newark, the declaration of indulgence two years later enabled the men to return to Nottingham. There they served as joint ministers of the town's presbyterian congregation until Reynolds's death in 1698. Whitlock published <span class="italic">A Short Account of the Life of the Reverend Mr William Reynolds</span> (1698) in memory of his great friend and continued to minister at the High Pavement chapel until within two years of his own death. He died at Nottingham on 4 December 1708 and was buried in the chancel of St Mary's on 8 December. His will showed him to own several properties and substantial sums of money were bequeathed to friends, family, and charitable use. Whitlock had two children, a daughter who died in infancy, and a son, John (1661&#150;1723), who succeeded him to the pastorate at High Pavement.<br>
