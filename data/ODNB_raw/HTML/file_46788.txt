<span class="headword">Bullock,  William Edward</span>  (1877&#150;1968), <span class="occ">motor car manufacturer</span>, was born on 14 March 1877 at Crockett Road, Handsworth, Birmingham, the son of William Bullock, smith, and his wife, Beatrice Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barnett. He was educated at Smethwick Technical School, leaving at the age of fourteen for a job as a toolmaker's assistant with Denison and Wigley, of Handsworth. He went on to work for an electrical engineer for two years, and another toolmaker in the Birmingham area for a further two years, before joining the newly formed Wigley-Mulliner Engineering Company as foreman about 1897. After two years he became works manager. During the South African War the firm expanded, producing munitions. Bullock designed gun carriages, and when the firm became the nucleus of the Coventry ordnance works he moved to Coventry. In 1902 he married Nellie Elizabeth Parsons, moulder; they had one son (<i>b</i>. 1903) and one daughter. In 1907 Bullock was elected a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.<br>
<br>In 1909 Bullock became works manager at Singer &amp; Co., originally a cycle manufacturer founded in Coventry in 1876 by George Singer (<i>d</i>. 1909); the firm made its first motor cars in 1905, and by 1909 employed 600 workers producing four models of car. Following a brief vogue for cycle cars, Singer became the first British manufacturer to produce a small economy car, the Singer 10, launched at the 1912 Motor Show. Earlier, on the continent, small cars with limited engines had been produced: the Baby Peugeot had appeared in 1900, and the 4&frac12; horsepower De Dion Bouton in 1901, but Singer was the first to produce a small car with a four-cylinder engine, a replica of a large car, with 10 horsepower, and to prove that a baby car was a practical proposition. Other motor manufacturers soon followed suit, and the Singer 10 had to face competition from the Morris Oxford and the Ford Model T, among others, but its success at the Brooklands trials 1912&#150;14, where it reached 72 m.p.h., helped to publicize it. At &pound;185 the Singer 10 appealed to those who could not afford a large car, and it became a best-seller. William Rootes was so impressed that he contracted to sell the whole first year's supply, and by 1913 the firm was making 1350 cars a year. During the First World War the factory concentrated on munitions production, but also supplied the armed forces with Singer 10s for the transport of junior army officers, and production continued after the war.<br>
<br>Bullock was appointed Singer's managing director in 1919 and in that year he was also a member of Coventry city council. After the war there was great demand for cars and the British motor manufacturing industry boomed, helped by the McKenna duties, first imposed in 1915, which protected British manufacturers from foreign competition, especially from the United States, which dominated the world market. Singer benefited from this and Bullock, advocating mass production for the popular market, began to acquire other companies in order to increase factory space, as the original factory site was hemmed in by housing and could not be expanded. In 1920 the firm acquired Coventry Premier Company Ltd, in 1922 Coventry Repetition Company, in 1925 Sparkbrook Manufacturing Company, and in 1926 the Calcott factory. In 1926 Singer was producing 9000 cars a year, 80 per cent of them Singer 10s. In 1927 a new car, the Singer Junior, was introduced to challenge the Austin 7, to be produced in Birmingham in an old BSA factory on the Coventry Road which had been bought by Singer the previous year. Despite additional competition from the Morris Minor, launched in 1928, the Singer Junior was very successful, with eight models listed in 1932. In 1929 Singer was one of the top three motor manufacturers in Britain, with 8000 employees and seven factories, producing 28,000 cars, but it was well behind Austin and Morris, which were responsible for 60 per cent of British car output whereas Singer had only 15 per cent of the market.<br>
<br>The fortunes of Singer nevertheless declined in the 1930s. Bullock had made some unwise purchases, including the acquisition of the large Hay Mills factory at Small Heath, Birmingham, bought from Daimler in 1928, into which he introduced new machinery and a moving assembly line, transferring assembly work from Coventry. The acquisition of the two Birmingham factories was a financial burden, despite the growth in popularity of small cars during the slump following the market collapse of 1929. In the 1930s the company struggled to survive: its rivals won the 10 horsepower market with the Hillman Minx and the Austin 10, while the Singer Junior was eclipsed not only by the Morris Minor and the Austin 7 but also, after 1932, by the Ford Model Y, which by 1934 had captured 56 per cent of the British market for cars of that class. In 1935 the Ford Popular, introduced at &pound;100, went on to sell more than any other car in the United Kingdom before the outbreak of the Second World War.<br>
<br>A final blow came in 1935. In 1933 Singer had introduced its first sports car, the Singer 9, which finished thirteenth at Le Mans that year and was a serious rival to the MG, but in the 1935 Le Mans Tourist Trophy three of the four Singers crashed as a result of steering failures, and the fourth immediately withdrew. Singer never entered a team again, and the disaster did the company a great deal of harm. At the annual general meeting in May 1936 a loss of &pound;129,292 was reported. Dividends had not been paid since 1931&#150;2, and following criticism from the shareholders Bullock was not re-elected to the board. He resigned from the company shortly afterwards, together with his son, who had been general manager since 1931 and who had been in charge of the Birmingham factory.<br>
<br>From the beginning of his years with Singer, Bullock dominated the company, and as a vice-president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in the 1920s was a leading figure in the motor industry. An advocate of mass production, he visited the United States in the 1920s to study ways of increasing production, and embarked on the acquisition of other factory sites to house the expanding moving assembly lines. His interest in technical and design improvements was wide-ranging: he was one of the first to introduce safety glass as standard equipment, low pressure tyres, and rear-mounted petrol tanks to reduce the risk of fire. However, he did not have a good grasp of financial matters: in the end the company was over-committed, and by the end of the 1930s Singer was no longer one of the top six motor manufacturers. In 1955 it was taken over by Rootes.<br>
<br>Bullock was small and energetic, with a prominent chin. He was always in the office by 8 a.m., and his main relaxation was gardening. After the death of his wife in 1934 he married, in 1936, Margaret F. Van Driest, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whynant, a divorcee and daughter of a veterinary surgeon. This marriage ended in divorce. His third wife was Mrs Parsons, the widow of his first wife's brother.<br>
<br>After leaving Singer in 1936, Bullock worked for a time on the development of fire pumps. He left Coventry at the start of the blitz and spent the rest of the Second World War working on the farm in Warwickshire belonging to his daughter. He died on 17 March 1968 at Wootton Court, Leek Wootton, Kenilworth, Warwickshire.<br>
