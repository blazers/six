<span class="headword">Brugge,  Lodewijk  van</span> <span class="st"> [Louis  de Bruges; Lodewijk  van Gruuthuse]</span>, earl of Winchester  (<em>c.</em>1427&#150;1492), <span class="occ">courtier and diplomat</span>, was the only son of Jan van Brugge and Margaretha van Steenhuyse. The name Gruuthuse, by which he is commonly known, refers to his family's property in and around Bruges and its associated wealth, based on the tax levied on <i>gruut</i>, a herb essential for the making of beer. Nothing is known of Lodewijk's early years, until in 1445 he was made cupbearer to Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, the start of a long career as an eminent courtier and successful soldier. In the early 1450s he took part in Philip's campaigns against the city of Ghent and was knighted in the field. In 1454 he was present at the famous Feast of the Pheasant, and was among those who swore to accompany the duke on crusade. In the following year he married Margaretha (<i>d</i>. 1510), daughter of Hendrik van Borsele, count of Grandpr&eacute; in France and lord of Veere in Zeeland, and Joanna van Halewyn. Margaretha's brother, Wolfert VI, became earl of Buchan in Scotland through his marriage in 1444 to James II's sister Mary. In December 1460 Gruuthuse was sent via England on an embassy to Scotland. His mission, to persuade the Scots to ally themselves with York rather than Lancaster in England's civil wars, enjoyed only limited success, but this was still sufficient to secure his admission to the order of the Golden Fleece on 2 May 1461. In 1463 he was appointed governor (<i>stadhouder</i>) of the counties of Holland and Zeeland, a position he held until 1477.<br>
<br>From 1465 to 1467 Gruuthuse was a member of many delegations and embassies to England and the English territories; these eventually, after the death of Philip the Good in 1467, paved the way for the marriage of Philip's heir, Charles the Bold, to Edward IV's sister, Margaret of York, on 3 July 1468. Only two years later, when Edward was forced to flee England in October 1470 by his own brother George, duke of Clarence, and Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, and landed on the island of Tessel, Gruuthuse was the first to be informed of the fugitive king's arrival. He hastened to meet Edward at Alkmaar, and travelled with him via the monastery of Egmond (where they venerated the relics of the &#145;English&#146; St Adalbert) and Leiden to The Hague, where Edward was Gruuthuse's guest until Christmas. Early in 1471 Edward had a meeting with Duke Charles, and then went to stay with Gruuthuse in the latter's magnificent town house in Bruges, before he moved to Zeeland on 17 February to join his fleet and eventually return home.<br>
<br>Gruuthuse's generous hospitality&#151;he even offered to accompany the king back to England&#151;earned Edward's gratitude. In the autumn of 1472 he came to England again on embassy, and was magnificently received. Bluemantle pursuivant's account of Gruuthuse's reception constitutes an important source for the splendour of Edward IV's court. Having made his way through Kent to London, the ambassador was entertained by the king at Windsor. He went hunting there with Edward, who gave him a crossbow with silk cords and gilt-headed bolts, while in the evening he attended a banquet given by the queen. He and his retinue watched Princess Elizabeth and the court ladies dancing, before retiring to &#145;iij chambers of Pleasance&#146;  (Madden, 279), where Gruuthuse's bed had a &#145;counterpoynt cloth of gold furred w<sup>t</sup> ermyne&#146;  (ibid.). He then returned to Westminster, where at the opening of parliament on 13 October Edward created him earl of Winchester, with an annuity of &pound;200, referring specifically to &#145;the grete humanytie and kyndnes of my lord Gruthuse shewed to his highnes when he was in the counties of Holand and Flaunders&#146;  (ibid., 281). The ritual on this occasion was no less elaborate, the king being attended by nobles and prelates, while the new earl earned the gratitude of the heralds for his lavish largess. On 23 November Gruuthuse also received a coat of arms based on that of the thirteenth-century Quincy earls of Winchester, with the addition of a canton with the leopard of England. Following his return to Flanders, in May 1473 Gruuthuse represented Edward at a chapter of the Golden Fleece, of which the king had been a member since 1468. In 1500, however, Gruuthuse's son and heir Jan was effectively forced by Henry VII to resign the arms, the title and the annuity, and even the freedom from customs duties that Edward had granted to the village of Westenschouwen in Zeeland at the request of Jan's father.<br>
<br>After the death of Duke Charles in January 1477 Gruuthuse became involved in the troubles that this traumatic event created. When Charles's only child and heir, Mary, died, in 1482, civil war broke out and Gruuthuse took the side of the Flemish towns which sought French support against the archduke Maximilian, Mary's husband. A member of the regency council for her son Philip the Fair, Gruuthuse was imprisoned in June 1485, and though unlike some of his colleagues he escaped being condemned to death, he remained in custody for several years. He was accused of high treason at the chapter of the Golden Fleece held in 1491, but died not long afterwards, in the Gruuthuse palace in Bruges on 24 November 1492, aged about sixty-five. Two days later he was buried in the church of Notre Dame in Bruges.<br>
<br>Gruuthuse is principally remembered as a bibliophile. He patronized the Bruges printer Colard Mansion and formed a splendid collection of beautifully illuminated manuscripts, which by the end of his life contained a copy of almost every book that was popular in his own aristocratic milieu&#151;among them the only complete set of Jean de Waurin's <span class="italic">Chronicles of England</span>&#151;and work from most of the famous Flemish illuminating workshops of his time. But although it has been claimed that his collection greatly influenced the taste and choice of books of Edward IV, there was in fact intense cultural exchange between England and Flanders throughout this period, and the king's stay in Bruges is unlikely to have had any real impact upon it. The Gruuthuse manuscripts (about 145 in all) are preserved in libraries all over western Europe and the USA&#151;one of them, a copy of the <span class="italic">Instruction d'un jeune prince</span>, was relatively recently identified in the British Library, in Cotton MS Vespasian Bi.&#151;but the bulk of them (some 120) passed to the kings of France and are now in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale in Paris. In most of these manuscripts Gruuthuse's arms have been painted over with the royal arms of France, but his motto, <i>Plus est en vous</i>, and his emblem of a bombard usually survive.<br>
<br>Lodewijk van Brugge was one of the few great Flemish-speaking servants of the Valois dukes of Burgundy. His beautifully restored residence in Bruges is now an important museum, while his contemporary portrait can be seen in the nearby Groeningemuseum.<br>
