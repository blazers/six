<span class="headword">Hazlitt,  William</span>  (1811&#150;1893), <span class="occ">editor and translator</span>, was born in Winterslow, Wiltshire, on 26 November 1811, the only surviving child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12805/', "William Hazlitt (1778&#150;1830)")</script>, writer and painter, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stoddart (1774&#150;1840). From 1812, when the elder Hazlitt had secured a regular post as a parliamentary reporter on the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, the family lived together in Westminster. In 1819, however, the parents separated, the younger William staying mainly with his mother. His upbringing was consequently unsettled; his parents frequently quarrelled and, according to acquaintances, he learned to play off one against the other, becoming very spoiled in the process&#151;when he was eight John Keats called him &#145;that little Nero&#146;  (Hazlitt, <span class="italic">Four Generations</span>, 1.106). He had attended at least three different small schools by the age of eleven and for a time was taught by Mary Lamb, alongside Mary Novello, the future Mary Cowden Clarke; at thirteen he was sent to a school run by a Unitarian pastor, William Evans, near Tavistock in Devon. But despite all difficulties his father remained as close to him as he could. In 1827, for example, he had &#145;his boy&#146; with him for a short stay in Paris.<br>
<br>When Hazlitt's father died, virtually penniless, in 1830, Hazlitt was left with neither professional training nor inherited income. To the end his father had hoped to leave him with an independence. At the same time various plans to qualify him for some career had been thought of and abandoned; his father had envisaged him as &#145;a good painter, if such a thing could be hoped&#146;  (Howe, 17.99), while his mother had thought at one time that he might become a singer after lessons with John Braham. In fact he followed his father into the literary trade. With the aid of the radical newspaper editor William Coulson&#151;a member, like his father, of the Lambs' circle&#151;he too became a parliamentary reporter and reviewer on the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>. At the same time he was editing the <span class="italic">Literary Remains of the Late William Hazlitt</span>, to which he contributed a biographical preface; it was published in 1836. In the same year he also brought out a new edition of his father's <span class="italic">Principles of Human Action</span>.<br>
<br>From about 1824 Hazlitt had been frequenting the family of Carew Reynell, one of his father's printers; on 8 September 1833 he married Reynell's daughter Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1860). At first they lived over a cabinet-maker's at 76 Charlotte Street, London, where their son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33780/', "William Carew Hazlitt")</script> was born in 1834, then at various other lodgings until they settled in Ovington Square, Brompton, in 1838. Life was a struggle; William Carew Hazlitt described his father as constantly searching for a permanent post until he was forty-three. In the meantime Hazlitt produced new editions of many of his father's works, as well as writing for a variety of journals, including the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> and <span class="italic">The Times</span> as well as the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>.<br>
<br>In the same period Hazlitt also edited the publisher David Bogue's enterprising <span class="roman">European Library</span> (later taken over by H. G. Bohn) and himself contributed various translations to it, including Alfred de Vigny's <span class="italic">Cinq-Mars</span> (1847) and Luther's <span class="italic">Table Talk</span> (1848). He also translated books for other publishers and edited several, most notably perhaps the <span class="italic">Works</span> of Defoe in three volumes, to which he added a memoir of the author (1840&#150;43). In 1839 he started his own <span class="roman">Romancist and Novelist's Library</span>, whose contents were published first as twopenny numbers and then in book form; translations were to be &#145;a very important feature of the work&#146;, he wrote to Leigh Hunt in March 1839  (Gates, 345). The <span class="roman">Library</span> included works by Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Paul de Kock, Goethe, Schiller, and Ida Pfeiffer, as well as by such historians and travel writers as Fran&ccedil;ois Guizot, Augustin Thierry, Jules Michelet, and &Eacute;variste Huc. His translation of Hugo's <span class="italic">Notre-Dame de Paris</span> was the first in the field, appearing only two years after the original as <span class="italic">Notre Dame: a Tale of the &#145;Ancien R&eacute;gime&#146;</span> (1833), with a &#145;literary and political preface&#146; comparing the lawlessness of <i>ancien r&eacute;gime</i> France with the &#145;regime of conquest&#146; underlying modern British society.<br>
<br>In November 1854 Hazlitt at last achieved an official appointment, becoming registrar of the London bankruptcy court, where he remained until his retirement. In collaboration with H. P. Roche he wrote books on the <span class="roman">Bankruptcy and Debtors' Acts</span> of 1861 and 1869; a further edition, revised by R. Ringwood, covered the act of 1893. Catherine Hazlitt had died in 1860. Hazlitt himself survived until 21 February 1893, when he died at his home, Oakfield, Addlestone, Chertsey, Surrey, of colic and cardiac failure.<br>
