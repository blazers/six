<span class="headword">Lancey, Sir  William Howe  De</span>  (<em>c.</em>1778&#150;1815), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, probably born in New York, was the son of Stephen De Lancey (1747/8&#150;1798), clerk of the city of Albany and later governor of Tobago, and his wife, Cornelia, daughter of the Revd H. Barclay of Trinity Church, New York. The scion of a wealthy and influential loyalist family, he is thought to have attended Harrow School (1789&#150;91) before being commissioned a cornet in the 16th light dragoons in 1792. Despite his youth he did duty with his regiment and by October 1794 was a captain in the new raised 80th regiment, which he joined in Holland in December that year; he first saw action at Tuil on the 28th. On the way to India with the regiment in 1796, his youthful good looks and infectious high spirits caught the attention of General John St Leger who, in March 1797, took him to Calcutta as his aide-de-camp in readiness for an expedition to Manila, an enterprise in which the 33rd foot, under its young colonel, the future duke of Wellington, was also to take part. William Hickey records in his diary two lively occasions when the two men were among his guests.<br>
<br>On returning to England in late 1798 as captain in the 17th light dragoons (a regiment of which his uncle, General Oliver De Lancey, was colonel), De Lancey spent some months in Canterbury before his uncle procured his promotion as major in the 45th, then serving in the West Indies. Granted leave to await its return, he put the interval to good use by entering the Royal Military College at High Wycombe that had been recently established for the education of staff officers. Although he possessed a facility for drawing, he probably took this step at the suggestion of his uncle by marriage, General Sir David Dundas, then quartermaster-general of the forces. He stayed for eighteen months until September 1802 and reached, as few did, the class of the chief instructor, General Fran&ccedil;ois Jarry, an achievement which, in the opinion of Dundas, qualified him to become in 1804 one of the half-dozen officers on the permanent staff of the quartermaster-general, the branch of the staff responsible for troop movements. As such he served in the Yorkshire district (1806) and Ireland (1807) before sailing in 1808 as the senior assistant quartermaster-general first to Sweden and then, in August, to the Iberian peninsula. In Sir John Moore's campaign he had to conduct Sir John Hope's division by a long detour to Salamanca, and he stayed with it during the retreat to Corunna. As lieutenant-colonel on the permanent staff, he returned to Portugal early in April 1809 and became deputy quartermaster-general under Colonel George Murray, a position he held for the remainder of the war. Murray reported to Major-General Alexander Hope on 6 October 1809 that he was: &#145;Intelligent, zealous and anxious to be employed in any way in which he can promote the service&#146;  (Luffness MSS), and a junior officer in the department found him &#145;everything I could wish as a commanding officer&#146;  (Captain Tryon Still to General Le Marchant, 30 June 1810, Le Marchant MSS). In 1812, during Murray's absence, he headed the department until the arrival in August of Colonel James Willoughby Gordon; he headed it again from December 1812 to March 1813. While unable to react to Wellington's wishes quite as Murray had done, De Lancey's operation orders nevertheless satisfactorily interpreted Wellington's memoranda for those bold initiatives that culminated in the battle of Salamanca. Later, after experiencing Gordon's meddlesome methods, Wellington was able to say that De Lancey did the job much better. Murray, upon his return, gave De Lancey in May 1813 the exacting but flattering task of conducting the powerful left wing of the army under Sir Thomas Graham for the advance into Spain, and he continued to act with this wing until the end of the war. He was promoted colonel in June 1813 and on 1 January 1815 he was rewarded with a knighthood in the Order of the Bath.<br>
<br>At the peace De Lancey was appointed head of the department in Scotland. He married in Edinburgh on 4 April 1815 Magdalen, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11965/', "Sir James Hall of Dunglass, fourth baronet (1761&#150;1832)")</script>, and Lady Helen Douglas (1762&#150;1837). A few days later he responded loyally to an appeal to rejoin Wellington who, on assuming command in the Southern Netherlands, had inherited in Sir Hudson Lowe a quartermaster-general whom he could not abide, and whom he succeeded in getting posted elsewhere. Though expressing disappointment at being no more than deputy pending Murray's return, De Lancey hastened to Brussels on 9 May and from 15 June onwards was occupied day and night. He conducted the retreat from Quatre Bras on 17 June and marked out the position the troops were to occupy at Waterloo on the 18th&#151;to the rear, apparently, of the ground originally chosen by the duke. Late in the battle of Waterloo, while talking to Wellington, he was struck in the back by a spent cannon-ball that broke eight ribs. Left for dead on the field for thirty-six hours, he was taken up and carried to a farmhouse in Mont-St Jean where, though devotedly nursed by his young wife, he died on 26 June 1815. His remains were buried on the 28th in the protestant cemetery of St Joost-ten-Node, from where they were removed in 1889 to nearby Evere. His widow, who married Henry Harvey in 1819, died in 1822.<br>
<br>All who spoke of De Lancey testify to his engaging manner and cheerful temper, a character borne out in his letters. If he had a fault as a staff officer, it was in his failure sometimes to distance himself from those to whom he had to give orders, but this was a largely unavoidable consequence of his naturally easy-going disposition.<br>
