<span class="headword">Moody,  Dwight Lyman</span>  (1837&#150;1899), <span class="occ">evangelist</span>, was born in Northfield, Massachusetts, on 5 February 1837, the sixth of nine children of Edwin Moody (1800&#150;1841), a bricklayer, who died early, and his forceful wife, Betsey, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Holton (1805&#150;1895). He was educated at the local grammar school and at Northfield Academy for Boys. Becoming a shoe salesman, he was converted in 1855, joined a Congregational church in the following year, and moved to the rising city of Chicago, where he prospered. There he soon launched an undenominational Sunday school that developed into the unattached Illinois Street Church. In 1860 he abandoned his business to become a full-time employee of the Chicago Young Men's Christian Association, acting chiefly as a zealous city missionary but also visiting troops during the civil war. On 28 August 1862 he married the nineteen-year-old Emma Charlotte Revell (<i>d</i>. 1903), a calm and self-controlled Baptist who was to accompany him on his main trips to Britain. They had one daughter and two sons.<br>
<br>Between 1866 and 1870, while president of the Chicago YMCA, Moody became an experienced convention speaker. In 1867 he crossed the Atlantic, basing himself for four months at the London YMCA. He established contact with the circle of evangelicals associated with the annual Mildmay conference and particularly R. C. Morgan, the Brethren publisher and editor of <span class="italic">The Christian</span>. In 1871 his home, church, and YMCA were destroyed in the great Chicago fire, but a decisive spiritual experience nerved him for fresh ventures. During a brief visit to London in 1872, when he spoke at Mildmay, he discussed with Morgan a plan for an evangelistic tour of Britain. On 17 June 1873 Moody arrived at Liverpool, unannounced, to mount the enterprise. After missions in York, Sunderland, and Newcastle, he opened a campaign in Edinburgh on 23 November that lasted until late January. Boosted by publicity in <span class="italic">The Christian</span>, Moody took Edinburgh by storm. Crowds flocked nightly to the Corn Exchange, which held nearly 6000, attracted in part by the singing of his partner, <a href="#cosubject_53843">Ira D. Sankey [<i>see below</i>]</a>. From 8 February Moody enjoyed even greater celebrity in Glasgow, where until April he regularly spoke four times a day. Missions followed in other Scottish towns, in Belfast, Dublin, and Manchester during the autumn, and in Sheffield, Birmingham, and Liverpool in the new year. The climax took place in London between 9 March and 21 July 1875, when he addressed altogether over 2&frac12; million people at four venues: the Agricultural Hall, Islington; the Royal Opera House, Haymarket; Camberwell Green; and Bow Common. In June an attempted evangelistic visit to Eton College was transferred to an adjacent garden after protests in the House of Lords. Criticized by the secular press for vulgarity, by hyper-Calvinists for distorting the gospel, and by Anglo-Catholics for both, he nevertheless enjoyed enormous popularity and (contrary to some accounts) did make an appreciable impact on non-churchgoers and the working classes.<br>
<br>Moody sustained similar campaigns in America for the rest of his life. He founded a girls' school (1879), a boys' school (1881), an annual <span class="roman">Bible</span> conference (1880) on the Mildmay model (all three at Northfield), and a <span class="roman">Bible</span> institute for lay workers in Chicago (1889). During 1881&#150;3 he was again in the United Kingdom, holding missions in Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and elsewhere, perhaps the most notable being a visit to the University of Cambridge in November 1882. Between November 1883 and June 1884 he preached in temporary iron tabernacles on eleven successive sites in London, receiving less acclaim than in 1875 but quietly meeting many metropolitan notables. On a final visit to Britain in 1891&#150;2 Moody gave addresses briefly in London and more extensively in Scotland. He collapsed in 1899 while conducting a campaign in Kansas City, and died of heart failure on 22 December 1899 in Northfield, where he was buried on 26 December.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_53843"></a><span class="headword">Ira David Sankey</span>  (1840&#150;1908), Moody's singing colleague, was born on 28 August 1840 at Edinburgh, Pennsylvania. He was educated at the high school in Newcastle, Pennsylvania, and entered his father's bank there in 1857. In 1863 he married Fanny, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edwards. A lifelong Methodist, he encountered Moody at a YMCA conference in 1870 and, though without vocal training, joined his missions to &#145;sing the gospel&#146;. After congregational singing, led whenever possible by a mass choir, Sankey accompanied his own baritone solos on a harmonium. Rousing or plaintive melodies possessing memorable choruses reminiscent of the music hall were interspersed with anecdotal sermonettes. His immensely popular <span class="italic">Sacred Songs and Solos</span> (1873 and many subsequent editions) came to include a few of his own compositions, especially &#145;There were Ninety and Nine&#146;. Sankey visited Britain without Moody in 1898&#150;9 and 1901, eventually dying at Brooklyn, New York, on 14 August 1908.<br>
<br>Moody and Sankey successfully adapted the American revivalist tradition to a respectable urban world, dropping the inherited &#145;anxious seat&#146; for potential converts in favour of less threatening enquiry rooms and organizing increasingly careful preparations such as domestic visitation. Moody insisted on interdenominational co-operation, helping to draw together the Free Church and United Presbyterians in Scotland. His preaching was deliberately compatible with both Calvinism and Arminianism, but he did adopt the increasingly widespread belief in a premillennial second advent. Although he normally consorted with businessmen, he encouraged measures of civic responsibility such as temperance efforts, free breakfasts for the poor, and refuges for destitute children. In Britain his message seemed radical because of its democratic populism. Strong, square-shouldered, and sporting a long brown beard, Moody used simple language, homely illustrations, and a dash of Yankee humour to bring <span class="roman">Bible</span> stories alive. His published sermons circulated widely. Moody and Sankey probably represent the chief cultural influence of the United States on Britain during the nineteenth century.<br>
