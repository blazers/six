<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Roberts, Sir  Gareth Gwyn</span>  (1940&#150;2007), <span class="occ">physicist and university administrator</span>, was born on 16 May 1940 at Craig Beuno Nursing Home, Bangor, Caernarvonshire, the son of Edwin Roberts (<i>d</i>. 1974), a wages clerk in the local granite quarry, and his wife, Meri, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones (<i>d</i>. 1959). He was brought up with his twin sister, Gwyneth, and younger sister, Enid, in the family home at 3 St David's Terrace, Penmaenmawr, where Welsh was the spoken language and weekly attendance at chapel compulsory. His mother was a considerable influence, engendering in him a steely determination to succeed that remained with him throughout his life. From John Bright Grammar School in Llandudno he progressed to the University College of North Wales, Bangor, where he gained a first-class honours degree in physics in 1961 and studied for a PhD in the rapidly developing field of semiconductor physics (his thesis was entitled &#145;A theoretical study of space charge currents in solids&#146;) before taking up a lectureship in physics there in 1963. A year earlier, on 15 August 1962, at George Street Congregational Church, Croydon, he had married Charlotte Standen (<i>b</i>. 1942), insurance clerk, and daughter of Albert John Williams Standen, shop manager. They had two sons and one daughter. The marriage ended in divorce in 1993.<br>
<br>In 1966 Roberts moved to the Xerox Corporation in Rochester, New York, working as a senior research scientist on selenium and other materials used in copying machines. The American culture of competitiveness and high expectation suited him admirably, but in 1968 he accepted an invitation from his PhD supervisor, Richard Tredgold, to join him at the New University of Ulster at Coleraine and help establish a department of physics. Roberts went on to become professor and head of the department of physics and dean of the school of physical sciences. His research in this period was aimed at modifying the properties of materials like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide by doping to produce improved semiconductor devices. After eight years at Ulster he took on a fresh academic challenge&#151;the headship of the department of applied physics and electronics at Durham University, which provided the perfect setting for his research at the interface between science and engineering. Following his involvement in a successful visit to Durham by the University Grants Committee he was invited to join its equipment committee, which he subsequently chaired. It was the first of many public and professional bodies to seek his services.<br>
<br>Roberts believed that scientific research and its applications should go hand in hand, and each of his senior academic appointments was combined with a post in industry. During his time in Ulster he worked in ICI's corporate laboratory in Runcorn, with Geoffrey Allen as his mentor, and after the laboratory's relocation to Durham he developed even closer research links with the company. He had no thought of leaving Durham, but when the package of chief scientist (later research director) at Thorn EMI for four days a week and an Oxford visiting professorship in engineering science for one day a week (not to mention a fellowship at Brasenose College) was offered to him in 1985 he felt compelled to accept. Colin Southgate, chief executive of Thorn EMI, was engaged in a major programme of modernization and delegated to Roberts responsibility for reorganizing the company's Central Research Laboratories and devising technology strategies for each of its operating divisions.<br>
<br>At Oxford Roberts established a new research group in the field of molecular electronics, an area in which he had an international reputation. His particular interest was the physical behaviour of Langmuir-Blodgett films&#151;ultra-thin films of organic material deposited sequentially on a solid substrate in layers one molecule thick. Roberts was among the first scientists to appreciate the versatility of these films. Working with ICI researchers in Durham he designed a new type of trough for precisely assembling the monolayers and extended the range of organic materials used in making them. He also investigated their applications in such electronic devices as field-effect transistors. In his Oxford laboratory he focused his energies on the unique sensing properties of Langmuir-Blodgett films and their potential use as heat sensors for security devices and vapour sensors for environmental monitoring. He was the author of over 200 publications and patents, and two books, <span class="italic">Insulating Films on Semiconductors</span> (1979) and <span class="italic">Langmuir-Blodgett Films</span> (1990). His membership of the prime minister's Advisory Council on Science and Technology (1989&#150;92) gave him the opportunity to discuss Langmuir-Blodgett films with Margaret Thatcher, who had worked in this field during her time as a research chemist. Roberts was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1984 and received the Holweck gold medal of the Institute of Physics in 1986.<br>
<br>When the University of Sheffield's chancellor, Lord Dainton, sounded out Roberts for the post of vice-chancellor he faced competition from a number of other universities, but Roberts liked what he saw at Sheffield and moved there in 1991. His tenure was strikingly successful and the university rapidly ascended the league tables for research and teaching on the back of judicious appointments to chairs, which on occasion brought in entire research teams. He led from the front in a campaign of relentless initiative, though his urgency could sometimes offend the university's most collegiate instincts. However, his personal qualities of integrity and fairness, combined with his formidable powers of persuasion, enabled him to implement far-sighted policies (such as multidisciplinary research groupings) that won the support of the academic community. One of his great legacies at Sheffield was the early outreach scheme, lauded by the government, providing a route into higher education for underprivileged pupils in inner-city schools.<br>
<br>Roberts was the networker supreme, adept at founding national and international partnerships, such as the Russell group of leading UK universities; the White Rose University Consortium of Leeds, Sheffield, and York universities; and the Worldwide Universities Network, an alliance of pre-eminent universities in four continents. He was equally committed to the regeneration of Sheffield, serving on the boards of the Sheffield Development Corporation, the Sheffield Health Authority, and the Regional Development Agency for Yorkshire and the Humber, and co-founding the Sheffield First Partnership with the leader of the city council. Many of these enterprises had their origins in &#145;town and gown&#146; dinners held at his formal residence, The Croft, which he shared with his second wife, Carolyn Mary Rich, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Butler (<i>b</i>. 1948), a health service executive and trained nurse (daughter of Albert Edward Butler, musician, and former wife of Stephen Rich), whom he married at Leeds register office on 18 February 1994. She had two daughters by her first marriage.<br>
<br>Roberts's election in 1995 as chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals&#151;the collective voice of the UK higher education system&#151;marked his entry onto the national political stage and almost immediately he was plunged into conflict with the Conservative government over its latest round of cuts in university funding. His refusal to listen to a speech from the minister for higher education, coupled with a vigorous national campaign mounted alongside the unions to highlight the systematic underfunding of higher education, signalled a new way forward for the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals. The outcome was the Dearing report of 1997 (named after the chairman of the national committee of inquiry into higher education, Sir Ronald Dearing), largely accepted by the incoming Labour government, which mirrored many of the recommendations made by the committee to alleviate the funding shortfall, including the introduction of means-tested tuition fees.<br>
<br>Roberts was knighted for his services to higher education in 1997. In the same year he joined the board of the Higher Education Funding Council for England and went on to chair its research committee. He had previously been a member of the Universities Funding Council (1989&#150;92). In 1998 he was elected president of the Institute of Physics and two years later he became founding president of the Science Council, set up to promote the profession of scientist by the designation &#145;chartered scientist&#146;. He also served a four-year term as chairman of the Defence Scientific Advisory Council (1993&#150;7). As a chairman he was practical and pragmatic, always polite and charming, but above all incisive.<br>
<br>The presidency of Wolfson College, Oxford, to which Roberts was appointed in 2001, was described by <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> as &#145;one of the best post-VC jobs in the business&#146;  (30 May 2000). Importantly it afforded him sufficient time to pursue his many national and international initiatives. He was a driving force in the development of UK policy on university research, chairing a critical review of the research assessment exercise and addressing the urgent need for better career opportunities for the growing numbers of contract research staff in universities. In 2001 he was commissioned by the Treasury to investigate ways of increasing the numbers of skilled scientists, engineers, and technologists needed to support a competitive modern economy. His landmark report, &#145;SET for success: the supply of people with science, technology, engineering and mathematical skills&#146;, published in the following year, was commended by the prime minister and fully funded by the government at all levels, from schools through to universities and research councils. Stipends for PhD students were almost doubled and the &#145;Roberts money&#146;, as it became known, enabled universities to provide transferable skills training and career development programmes for all their graduate and postdoctoral researchers.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Roberts took a keen interest in the promotion of science to young people. In 1988 he presented the Royal Institution Christmas lectures, &#145;The home of the future&#146;, on BBC television, and in 2005 he was appointed chairman of SETNET, the government-sponsored body charged with enriching school science. In the following year he took on the presidency of the Association for Science Education and also became chairman of the Engineering and Technology Board. His expertise was sought overseas, most notably in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia, where he advised the government on the best way of assessing the quality of publicly funded research. He retained an active interest in the business community through his visiting professorship in the Sa&iuml;d Business School at Oxford and his directorship of Isis Innovation, Oxford University's technology transfer company. He was also chairman of the healthcare and biotechnology company Medical Solutions. He received honorary degrees and fellowships from ten university institutions.<br>
<br>Roberts was a transformational leader, a man of extraordinary vision, energy, and determination who had a profound impact on science policy and higher education in Britain. At Wolfson College, as in all his other appointments, he was open and accessible to students and staff, and this in turn inspired great loyalty among those who knew him. He was admired as a public speaker and his dinner parties and attendant quizzes were legendary, as too was his warm personality and his support of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. Conceding little to his final illness (and remaining president of Wolfson College), he died from cancer on 6 February 2007 at his home, 10 Chadlington Road, Oxford, and was cremated at Oxford crematorium on 16 February. He was survived by his wife, Carolyn, his two stepdaughters, and the three children of his first marriage.<br>
