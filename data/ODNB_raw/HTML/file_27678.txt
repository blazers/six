<span class="headword">Tredway,  Letice <span class="st"> [Letitia; </span></span> <span class="st"> <em>name in religion </em>Mary]</span>  (1593&#150;1677), <span class="occ">abbess of the Convent of Our Blessed Lady of Syon, Paris</span>, was baptized Letice or Letitia Tredway, and was the daughter of Sir Walter Tredway (<i>d</i>. 1604) of Beaconsfield and his wife, Elizabeth Weyman. After the premature deaths within ten years of both her father and her brother she inherited rights to the family property. By the time of her brother's death in 1615 she had already converted to Catholicism and had entered a Flemish Augustinian convent near Douai, where she remained for some years. At the time there were no English houses in France, although a number had been founded in Flanders. With Thomas Carre, a priest at the English College at Douai, she decided to found the first English house in France. At first, the plan was to open a convent in Douai, but by 1632 she had fixed firmly on Paris as the site of the new house. In spite of a lack of contacts in Paris, in 1633 she obtained letters patent from Louis XIII for the founding of the new house under the direction of English secular clergy, subject to the authority of the archbishop of Paris. However, there were objections, not least because she lacked a foundation fund and had only one professed nun, Margaret de Bury, a Walloon, as a committed supporter. The dowries of five postulants, newly arrived from England, would not contribute financially to the house until they were paid a year later on profession. Mary Tredway settled &pound;3000 from family sources to support the new convent financially and by 1635 the first postulants were professed.<br>
<br>From the beginning the main burden of organization rested on Mary Tredway. However, the reputation of the new convent spread and attracted other entrants from England. By 1640 there were nineteen choir nuns, five lay sisters and three novices; new premises which became the convent's home for the next 220 years had been bought and a school for English girls had been established. Within five years the building programme was completed and she turned her full attention to the spiritual and liturgical life of the convent. She had brought St Augustine's rule with her from Douai and this she applied carefully. By the 1640s the convent of Our Blessed Lady of Syon was a flourishing community which had earned a reputation for excellent music and discipline.<br>
<br>The civil wars in England and France deprived the house of both income and recruits, but its reputation secured financial assistance from Seguier, the chancellor of France, which enabled the convent to survive. In spite of the financial difficulties of this period Mary Tredway and Thomas Carre co-operated in the foundation of a small college, St Gregory's, where English secular priests could stay while they studied at the Sorbonne. Mary Tredway included them in as much of the convent life as she was able to. From the first recruits she found a successor to Thomas Carre, who had acted as financial adviser as well as confessor to the convent. Edward Lutton was an excellent choice, able to sort out a number of serious financial problems for them.<br>
<br>Mary Tredway celebrated her jubilee in 1664 with ceremonies that included special services and music, presentations by the boarders from the school, and dinner with most of the English Catholics in Paris. In old age ill health prevented her carrying out her duties as abbess as she wished and, aged over eighty, she suffered a bad fall in 1672 which left her virtually bedridden for the last five years of her life. Lutton was able to negotiate new constitutions which allowed the election of a new abbess every four years and Mary Tredway resigned after forty years as abbess, spending her last years reading the prayers and devotions of St Thomas &agrave; Kempis. She died on 13 October 1677 and was buried in the convent chapel (demolished in 1860).<br>
<br>At her death Mary Tredway left a convent with forty-three choir nuns and ten lay sisters. She had created and led a community which would prove strong enough to survive the French Revolution, giving the veil to eighty postulants. The convent had a high reputation as a centre of discipline and musical excellence and for its school, which attracted pupils from a wide area.<br>
