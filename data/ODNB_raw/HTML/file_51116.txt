<span class="headword">Levinstein,  Ivan</span>  (1845&#150;1916), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born on 4 July 1845 in Charlottenberg, Berlin, the eighth of seventeen children, eight boys and nine girls, of Levin Jacob Levinstein (1803&#150;1865), and his wife, Bertha Liebermann. Levinstein senior was variously owner of a calico printing factory, political correspondent, and agent of the German branch of the Rothschild Bank. He fell out with Bismarck at the end of the 1850s, and subsequently encouraged his older sons to emigrate. Some of them became established in London as dye merchants, and started the manufacture of aniline dyes. Ivan was educated at the Royal Prussian Gymnasium, Berlin, and then at the Gewerbeinstitut, where he studied aniline dyes. By 1864 he was involved in a family dye-making business at Neu-Sch&ouml;neberg, near Berlin. Later in 1864 he followed in the footsteps of his brothers, and arrived in Salford, Lancashire, where he began the manufacture of the aniline red known as magenta. When the original patent, owned by a London firm, was declared invalid in 1865, Levinstein took up its manufacture on a large scale at Blackley, Manchester, where he set up a works at Hulton House.<br>
<br>In the meantime, Levinstein's brother Hugo in London was sued for patent infringement over the magenta derivative known as aniline blue. Hugo lost the case, but Ivan circumvented the patent monopoly in 1869 by employing the intermediate known as toluidine. With these and similar products, an aniline salt used in aniline black printing on cotton, and the first of what were later known as azo dyes (derived from diazonium intermediates), Ivan Levinstein became a successful manufacturer. In 1871 he launched the trade journal <span class="italic">Chemical News</span>, which he edited for several years, and which was published until 1891. By 1874 his firm had offices and agencies in London, Birmingham, Glasgow, on mainland Europe, and in the United States. Expansion at Blackley continued with the acquisition of the adjacent Crumpsall Vale works, and by 1887 Levinstein's factory had been reconstructed. He employed several German chemists, though few appear to have remained for long periods.<br>
<br>In 1881 Levinstein became engaged in patent litigation with Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik (BASF) over the azo dye fast red AV (Levinstein's version was known as roccelline), patented in London early in 1878 by Heinrich Caro, technical director of the German firm. Though judgement went against Levinstein in 1887, he subsequently developed a close business alliance with BASF, and friendship with Caro. By this time a class of novel azo dyes, the benzopurpurines, which attached directly to cotton without the aid of a mordant, was available. In 1889 Levinstein joined BASF against the powerful benzopurpurine convention of Agfa and Bayer. This failed, and Levinstein was forced into partnership with his adversaries. Agfa and Bayer controlled his firm from 1890 until 1895, during which time it traded as I. Levinstein &amp; Co. Ltd. It came under Levinstein's control again from 1895, and the name changed to Levinstein Ltd. Other business interests included a partnership in the alkali manufacturers Murgatroyd Company Ltd, of Middlewich, and Ammonia Soda Company Ltd, of Northwich.<br>
<br>From about 1880 Levinstein became actively involved in public affairs, especially through the Manchester chamber of commerce. From 1885 he participated in management of the chemical and dyeing and printing departments of the Manchester Technical School, of which he was a councillor during 1888&#150;91. He was also a member of Manchester city council's education committee, and chairman of the technical instruction committee of the Municipal School of Technology (later part of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology). Subsequently Levinstein became a member of the court of the Victoria University and a governor of Owens College. He promoted utilitarian studies, and application of science to industrial problem-solving along German lines, which was opposed by some academics in Manchester. He was chairman of the 1887 Manchester Royal Jubilee Exhibition.<br>
<br>When the Society of Chemical Industry, founded in 1881, set up a Manchester section in 1883, Levinstein became a member of the committee. He was chairman of the section (1883&#150;4 and 1889&#150;94), vice-president of the society (1897&#150;1900 and 1903&#150;6) and president (1901&#150;3), and vice-president of the Society of Dyers and Colourists (1884&#150;1916).<br>
<br>From the end of the 1890s Levinstein lobbied for patent law reform and commercial protectionism. Following the introduction of German synthetic indigo in 1897 he implored dyers and printers of his adoptive country to support the colonial trade in the natural dyestuff. He was a member of Chamberlain's tariff commission and is given much credit for the steps leading to the <span class="roman">Patent Act</span> of 1907. Levinstein published widely in the chemical and dyeing trade literature, especially in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry</span>, on matters relating to new industrial chemical developments, education, and patents. Early in the First World War he joined the Board of Trade's chemical supplies committee.<br>
<br>Levinstein became a British subject on 25 April 1873. About 1874 he married Hedwig Abeles of Vienna; they had three sons, Edgar (<i>b</i>. 1876), <a href="#cosubject_51116">Herbert [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and Edward Gerald (1887&#150;1916). The first of six family homes was Hillside House, Prestwich Park, and Levinstein's final home was Parkfield, Hale Road, Hale, Cheshire, where he died on 15 March 1916. His wife, who suffered from poor health, had previously returned to her family in Austria, where she died in 1908.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_51116"></a><span class="headword">Herbert Levinstein</span>  (1878&#150;1956)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 2 February 1878 at Prestwich Park, Prestwich, Lancashire, took over his father's business on the latter's retirement at the end of 1915. Herbert was educated at Rugby School, Owens College, Manchester, and Z&uuml;rich Polytechnic, where in 1900 he received a PhD in organic chemistry. His name appeared on twenty-five patents, either jointly or alone. Under his direction the first British-made synthetic indigo was produced in 1916 at the sequestered Ellesmere Port factory of Hoechst, where novocain and the antiseptic acriflavine were also produced. During the First World War Levinstein's highly qualified technical team, led by Arthur G. Green, developed close links with academic institutions. The Blackley factory continued with the production of dyes and engaged in the manufacture of mustard gas. Levinstein was a member of the Chemical Warfare Committee, the Hartley mission to Germany, and the economic section of the Paris peace conference. In November 1918 Levinstein Ltd was merged, under government influence, with British Dyes Ltd to form the British Dyestuffs Corporation. Herbert Levinstein was joint managing director, and from 1921 sole managing director. Levinstein was highly critical of the Huddersfield division, his erstwhile rival, and in 1922 was voted off the board. Subsequently he became involved in the manufacture of viscose rayon, as founder director of Neura Art Silk Company Ltd (formed in December 1925) and, from 1928, technical director of Lansil Ltd. From the late 1920s he was closely involved with the successor to the Murgatroyd Company, in which his father had held an interest; in 1950 he was appointed life president of Murgatroyd Salt and Chemical Company Ltd. British Dyestuffs Corporation was one of four major British chemical corporations that merged in 1926 to create Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). The Blackley site later became the regional headquarters of Zeneca plc.<br>
<br>Herbert Levinstein was at various times president of five institutions and societies, and published numerous articles concerning the chemical industry. In 1937 he endowed the Ivan Levinstein memorial lectures, the first two of which were given before the Manchester Chemical Club. The lectures were reintroduced after the Second World War under the aegis of the Society of Chemical Industry, and a further five were given until 1970. In 1949 Levinstein gave the inaugural George Douglas memorial lecture of the Society of Dyers and Colourists. In 1953 he received the Hinchley medal of the British Association of Chemists. His last home was Baddow, Pinkneys Green, Maidenhead. Herbert Levinstein was perhaps the only person to have attended both the 50th and the 100th anniversary celebrations of the discovery of William Perkin's mauve. He died on 3 August 1956 at King Edward VII Hospital, Windsor, Berkshire.<br>
