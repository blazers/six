<span class="headword">Fastolf,  Hugh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1392), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the son of Alexander Fastolf, a member of a rich mercantile family which had dominated the trade and politics of medieval Great Yarmouth since at least 1280. Through his wealth, royal service, and his eventual removal to London he was involved in some of the major political and commercial developments of his age. His family, one of the two richest in Yarmouth, were shipowners, exporters of fish and corn, and importers of wine, and they led the tight mercantile oligarchy that controlled the town. He came to own more than 1000 acres of land in sixteen villages, was bailiff of Great Yarmouth nine times, and its member of parliament in 1361, 1366, 1373, and 1377. He and the rest of the oligarchy were none too scrupulous about how they maintained their wealth and power. With his brother John he was twice in the 1350s indicted for serious assaults and in 1357 for forestalling goods. He was sentenced to outlawry by royal justices two years later.<br>
<br>However, Fastolf's wealth, extensive connections with the local gentry, and above all, his ships and naval expertise, made him indispensable to the royal government. From 1354 he was constantly employed on royal commissions in East Anglia and in royal naval service. By 1362 he was deputy admiral of the north. He conveyed Robert Knolles's expedition to France that year, and in 1372 he escorted the wine fleet to Gascony, importing 80 tuns of wine himself in return. In 1377 he raised his own indentured crews for naval service. He was rewarded by numerous royal grants and appointments, such as that of collector of the customs for Great Yarmouth in the 1360s, wardships, grants of alien priories, the mayoralty of the Yarmouth staple, and the farm of Lowestoft in 1387. He enjoyed business connections with the countess of Pembroke and the duke of Norfolk, and his brother John became squire to the earl of Warwick.<br>
<br>Fastolf's promotion of his own fortunes, and possibly the unpopularity he earned in East Anglia by raising naval contributions for the crown, again threatened his career in the 1370s, when Yarmouth's prosperity suffered from the effects of war on its shipping, from the decline of the herring industry, and the silting-up of its port. The consequence was a bitter conflict between the poorer burgesses and the richer members of the oligarchy who used their partnerships with London merchants to secure an even greater share of the town's trade. Fastolf was a partner of the London fishmonger Walter Sibyl, who in 1375 complained that he had been driven out of Yarmouth by lesser burgesses who had seized the corn he was about to export. The hostility which Fastolf and his associate, William Ellis, excited led to their impeachment by the poorer burgesses in the Good Parliament of 1376 for extortion, maintenance, and oppression. Fastolf claimed that the accusations were malicious, and he was subsequently cleared by an inquisition in East Anglia. None the less, his property in Yarmouth was attacked in a local uprising which was part of the peasant's revolt in 1381.<br>
<br>The effect of the naval war in concentrating foreign trade in London, because of the need to convoy merchant ships, encouraged Fastolf to settle in the capital, where he already had extensive mercantile connections with fishmongers and grocers, although he did not neglect his interests in East Anglia. He was admitted to citizenship apparently as a fishmonger, but after the death of his first wife, Agnes, in 1370, he married Joan, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52180/', "John (III) Gisors (d. 1351)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52181/', "Gisors, John (I) de")</script>], and granddaughter and heir of the pepperer Simon Dolseley and the widow of another pepperer, Thomas Hampstead. This brought him closer to the grocers, who by 1373 had reorganized and expanded their company (originally based upon the fraternity of the pepperers) primarily to protect the wool trade to Calais. Fastolf's naval experience made his membership desirable and he joined the Grocers' Company that year. He was elected as an alderman of London in 1381 and in the same year as one of its members of parliament. In the peasants' revolt he was the victim of a family feud which led his wife's kinsman, Paul Salisbury, to descend with a band of armed ruffians on his house in Thames Street where they ill-treated Joan Fastolf and seized the indenture by which Salisbury's father had leased the house to Fastolf.<br>
<br>Fastolf served on diplomatic trade missions to the Low Countries in 1385 and 1387. He resigned his aldermanry in 1385, but his financial involvement from 1382 with Sir Simon Burley, the tutor and friend of Richard II, made him a natural ally of his fellow grocer Sir Nicholas Brembre, who tried to control London for Richard II in his struggle against the lords appellant. It was undoubtedly Brembre who was responsible for Fastolf's election as sheriff in 1387. After the victory of the appellants a false rumour was spread that Fastolf had been imprisoned in the Tower of London by their order, but he was obliged to purchase a pardon. However, when Richard II regained his authority Fastolf was appointed a justice of the peace and sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk before he was elected to parliament in 1390. He arranged for the disposal of his property in 1391&#150;2 and died intestate in 1392. With his two wives he had six sons. His eldest son, John, was his heir. His widow, Joan, survived until 1417.<br>
