<span class="headword">Shortland,  Edward</span>  (1812&#150;1893), <span class="occ">physician and ethnographer in New Zealand</span>, born at Courtlands, near Lympstone, Devon, and baptized at Charles, Devon, on 19 May 1812, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25467/', "Captain Thomas George Shortland")</script>, of Courtlands, and his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter Tonkin of Plymouth. His brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25468/', "Willoughby Shortland")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25466/', "Peter Frederick Shortland")</script>. He was educated at Exeter grammar school, and Harrow School, and Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1831 and graduated BA in 1835 and MA in 1839. He then studied medicine, and was admitted an extra-licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1839. In 1841 he travelled, apparently at his brother Willoughby's suggestion, to New Zealand, where on 25 June 1841 he became private secretary to the governor, William Hobson. In 1842 he was appointed police magistrate and sub-protector of aborigines. On 10 August 1843 he landed at Akaroa on Banks peninsula, to act as interpreter to Colonel Godfrey's court of inquiry into the land claims of the French company which was then endeavouring to establish itself in that area. After the court was closed he took a census of South Island Maori settlements, travelling extensively in Otago and coastal Canterbury. His authoritative observations on Maori life, traditions, and language were recorded in his journals. He continued in government employment as sub-protector of aborigines and interpreter until his departure for Europe in 1846.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Southern Districts of New Zealand</span> (1851) and <span class="italic">Traditions and Superstitions of the New Zealanders</span> (1854) were published while Shortland was living in Plymouth and practising medicine. In 1860 he served in Garibaldi's Sicilian campaign. In 1862 he returned to New Zealand as civil commissioner appointed to manage Maori affairs in the Hauraki area, and on 14 August 1863 he was appointed native secretary, but he returned to England in 1865. From 1869 to 1873, and from 1880 to 1889, he again resided in New Zealand. During this time he published his major work, <span class="italic">Maori Religion and Mythology</span> (1882), as well as contributing a seminal article to the first volume of <span class="italic">Transactions of the New Zealand Institute</span> and publishing a Maori-language textbook (1883).<br>
<br>On his final departure for England in October 1889 Shortland was described as &#145;the most efficient Maori scholar probably the colony possesses&#146;, and he was competent and far-sighted in his administrative positions. He died at Colguill Villa, Compton Gifford, Devon, on 2 July 1893, survived by his wife, Eugenia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hardie, whom he had married at an unknown date, and with whom he had had four sons and seven daughters.<br>
