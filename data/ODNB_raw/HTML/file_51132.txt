<span class="headword">Hone, Sir  (Herbert) Ralph</span>  (1896&#150;1992), <span class="occ">army officer and colonial official</span>, was born on 3 May 1896 at 89 Sackville Road, Hove, Sussex, the son of Herbert Hone, schoolmaster, and his wife, Miriam Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dracott. He was educated at Varndean Grammar School, Brighton, where he was senior prefect. His mother died while he was still in his teens; his father, who was &#145;a man of character&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>), went on to become mayor of Brighton in 1937.<br>
<br>Hone passed the civil service examination in April 1915 before joining the Inns of Court regiment, from which he was commissioned and gazetted to the London Irish Rifles later that year. He was posted to the 1/18th battalion, a sporting unit which had kicked a rugby football ahead when it attacked in the murderous battle of Loos in autumn 1915. He served in the Notre Dame de Lorette sector and then at Vimy Ridge, where incessant rain made the trenches insanitary, but where everyone was expected to shave every day. Acute trench fever and impetigo put him in hospital, but after discharge he returned to the trenches, and to endless bombardment including by mustard gas shells. He was present when the Germans opened their offensive on 21 March 1918 with 6000 guns. Hone's company checked the first infantry assault near Couillet valley and took twenty-five German prisoners. In the ensuing fighting Hone anticipated and foiled several German attempts to infiltrate their lines, and led several counter-attacks. When the Germans sited a machine-gun where it could enfilade his company lines, he took a Lewis gun on to the parapet and promptly silenced it. In doing so he was badly wounded in the arm. Although losing blood fast, he was sent to walk several miles back to the casualty clearing station, where, with his bones fractured and the ulnar nerve severed, he was registered as &#145;slightly wounded&#146;. However, he was sent back to England and his courage and conduct in the action was recognized by the award of an MC. He ended the war as a captain. On 12 November 1918 he married Elizabeth Daisy (<i>b</i>. 1894/5), daughter of James Herbert Matthews, master tailor of Brighton. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>After the war Hone served as a staff captain in the Ministry of Munitions from 1918 to 1920, when he resigned his commission to join the colonial service as assistant treasurer in Uganda. He used his spare time to qualify as a barrister, and was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1924. He also sat the London LLB externally. From 1924 to 1925 he practised on the south-eastern circuit, but in 1925 he returned to Africa as registrar to the high court (1925&#150;8) and resident magistrate (1928&#150;30) in Zanzibar. In 1930 he was appointed crown counsel in Tanganyika territory. From January to August 1933 he returned to Britain as assistant legal adviser to the colonial and dominions offices. He was then appointed attorney-general in Gibraltar, where he was commissioner for the revision of the laws of Gibraltar in 1934 and chairman of the Gibraltar government commission on slum clearance and rent restriction in 1936. He was also occasionally acting chief justice of Gibraltar. His next posting was as attorney-general of Uganda from 1937 to 1943.<br>
<br>Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, and while still attorney-general of Uganda, Hone was made commandant of the Uganda defence force. In 1941 he was transferred to general headquarters Middle East, first as legal adviser (advising notably on law in the conquered Italian territories) and then (from 1942) as chief political officer. In March 1943 he was promoted to major-general, &#145;to ease his command over the Brigadiers under him&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>); he was also appointed CBE. Later that year he returned to London, where he served on the general staff at the War Office, dealing in particular with the war in Asia. He travelled frequently between London and SEAC headquarters, and struck up a close friendship with Louis Mountbatten, Lord Mountbatten of Burma.<br>
<br>In August 1945 Hone was appointed chief civil affairs officer in Malaya, overseeing the transition to civilian rule. He was present at the Japanese surrender at Singapore on 12 September. On 25 October 1945 (he and his first wife having divorced earlier in the year) Hone married Sybil Mary, daughter of Auguste Alfred Collins, and widow of Wing Commander G. Simond. There was one son of this second marriage. Mountbatten pressed for Hone to be offered the post of governor-general of Malaya in 1946, and was extremely annoyed when the Colonial Office vetoed the appointment on the grounds that divorced people should not become colonial governors. Mountbatten took up the point with George VI, who then abolished the rule about divorce. In consequence Hone, who was appointed KBE in 1946, and served as secretary-general to the governor-general of Malaya from 1946 to 1948, and deputy commissioner-general in south-east Asia from 1948 to 1949, was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of North Borneo in 1949. Mountbatten wrote to him saying that he was sure he would make a great success of the post, &#145;for it will help to establish the principle that the Governorship should be open to all suitable people, irrespective of old-fashioned rules&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). However, the Colonial Office did not bow out gracefully, and in their letter of congratulation on his appointment the deputed official said,<blockquote>It may interest you to know that in this respect you are establishing a precedent and I have been asked to make it clear to you that your appointment will not automatically entitle you to receive an invitation to social entertainments, such as Garden Parties at Buckingham Palace, and this particular embargo is not, I am told, to be waived. (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>)</blockquote>As governor of North Borneo, Hone was, in the event, a great success, encouraging the country's recovery from the ravages of the Japanese occupation, expanding trade in rubber, timber, and copra, and travelling to remote villages which no governor had visited before. He was appointed KCMG in 1951. In 1954 he returned to Britain to become head of the legal division of the Commonwealth Relations Office. He remained there until 1961, advising and producing reports on a wide range of constitutional and legal issues. In 1961 he retired from the civil service, and resumed practice at the bar. Nevertheless, he also held many important advisory posts both at home and overseas, his ability at bringing new ideas to solve apparently intractable problems being very much appreciated. He was constitutional adviser to the Kenyan government from December 1961 to January 1962, to R. A. Butler (on central Africa) from July to October 1962, to the South Arabian government from October 1965 to January 1966, and to the Bermudan government from July to November 1966.<br>
<br>The key to Hone's success was hard work, meticulous attention to detail, and good-humoured leadership. He relaxed with tennis, badminton, and philately. He was an active freemason, and was bailiff grand cross of the order of St John. He died at his home, 56 Kenilworth Court, Lower Richmond Road, Putney, London, on 28 November 1992, of pneumonia; he was survived by his second wife and by his three children. A memorial service was held on 8 February 1993 at the Grand Priory Church, St John's Square, Clerkenwell Road, London.<br>
