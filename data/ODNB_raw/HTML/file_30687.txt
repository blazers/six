<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bell, Sir  (Harold) Idris</span>  (1879&#150;1967), <span class="occ">papyrologist and scholar of Welsh literature</span>, was born on 2 October 1879 at Epworth, Lincolnshire, the son of Charles Christopher Bell (<i>b</i>. 1845), chemist, and his wife, Rachel Hughes (<i>d</i>. 1880). His father's family had been yeoman farmers in the north midlands and had marked literary leanings, his father not least; but the Welsh inheritance from his mother meant more to Bell and was a determining factor in his life. He was educated at Nottingham high school and Oriel College, Oxford, which he entered as an Adam de Brome scholar in 1897; he was placed in the first class in classical moderations in 1899 and two years later narrowly missed a first in <i>literae humaniores</i>. More significant for his future career was the year he subsequently spent in Hanover, Halle, and Berlin learning German and studying Hellenistic history; classical scholarship in Germany was then in its heyday and among the lecturers he heard were Friedrich Blass, Eduard Meyer, and U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf. This experience both deepened his knowledge of the classical world and introduced him to the most rigorous methods of contemporary scholarship, reinforcing a native tendency to painstaking accuracy and objectivity.<br>
<br>If Bell's ancestry and his period of study in Germany were decisive factors in his development, a third was his appointment as an assistant in the department of manuscripts in the British Museum in 1903. Here, more by chance than design, he found himself working before long on Greek papyri with F. G. Kenyon. After he had collaborated with him for the third volume of the museum catalogue on documents of an earlier period, chance again directed him to the department's large holdings of Byzantine papyri. Verbose, complex, and often illiterate and lacking the obvious attractions of many Ptolemaic and Roman texts, documents of this period had been largely ignored both in England and on the continent. Bell's edition of these papyri in volumes 4 and 5 of the catalogue, two massive volumes with an ample commentary (1910 and 1917), which provided a striking picture of the Byzantine empire seen from a provincial standpoint and one to which in an article in the <span class="italic">Journal of Egyptian Archaeology</span> (vol. 4, 1917) he supplied the title &#145;The Byzantine servile state&#146;, both set a new standard for the museum's publications in accuracy of decipherment and in interpretation, and established him as the leading authority on Byzantine and early Arab Egypt.<br>
<br>While Bell always retained his interest in Byzantine studies, Roman Egypt later became his main field of study. Both his <span class="italic">Jews and Christians in Egypt</span> (1924), an elaborate edition of some remarkable and important documents, and <span class="italic">Fragments of an Unknown Gospel and other Early Christian Papyri</span> (1935), jointly edited by him and his colleague T. C. Skeat, long remained indispensable in spite of the numerous re-editions and discussion they occasioned. Bell's achievement was due in part to his technical expertise and capacity for hard work, and in part to the fact that he rightly saw papyrology as a <i>Hilfsdisziplin</i> to be pursued in the wider perspective of the historian; he demonstrated this belief most clearly in the chapters he contributed on Roman Egypt to the <span class="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</span> (in vols. 10 and 11), which were a definitive statement of their subject. His work as editor, writer, and contributor of numerous articles in learned journals was done against the background of, and largely in the intervals from, steadily increasing departmental duties; in 1927 he was promoted to deputy keeper, and on the death of J. P. Gilson in 1929 he became keeper, a post he held until his retirement in 1944. In these years the much-debated <span class="roman">Codex Sinaiticus</span> was acquired, as well as the Luttrell psalter and some of the missing Paston letters; the department also became the centre of international papyrology from which, thanks mainly to Bell's activities, an understanding of Greek papyri extended to an ever wider circle of studies and in which many younger scholars received an invaluable if informal training. In 1935 he was made an honorary reader in papyrology at Oxford where until 1950 he did much to secure the continuity of papyrological studies; in 1936 he became an honorary fellow of Oriel College.<br>
<br>Bell's training and long practice in the school of severely objective scholarship controlled but did not inhibit a mercurial temperament and lively imagination. This found scope in his translations from Welsh poetry in which a lifelong devotion to poetry (especially for that in the tradition of Swinburne) joined with a no less deep and lasting enthusiasm for Welsh language and literature. <span class="italic">Poems from the Welsh</span>, a work of collaboration between Bell and his father, had appeared in 1913 and was followed in 1925 by <span class="italic">Welsh Poems of the Twentieth Century in English Verse</span>, again by father and son. The pattern was continued in a more ambitious venture, an edition of fifty poems of the greatest Welsh poet of the later middle ages, Dafydd ap Gwilym, consisting of text, translation, and introduction, in which Bell collaborated with his son David. Here scholarship had its part to play too, as it did in his admirable <span class="italic">The Development of Welsh Poetry</span> (1936) and in his translation of Thomas Parry's history of Welsh literature down to 1900, to which Bell added an appendix of his own, amounting to a quarter of the whole, on the twentieth century. In this book, which appeared in 1955, and in its predecessors, he was concerned to introduce the English reader to the often unsuspected riches of Welsh literature, just as in much of his papyrological work he was intent on making available to scholars generally the information lurking in the technical publications of papyrologists. For his services to Welsh literature he was awarded the Cymmrodorion medal in 1946 and was president of this society in 1947; he was also admitted to the gorsedd as a druid in 1949.<br>
<br>Bell was appointed OBE in 1920 and CB in 1936, and was knighted in 1946. Elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1932, he served as its president from 1946 to 1950, helping to renew the ties with continental scholarship, a task much after his own heart. He received honorary degrees from the universities of Liverpool, Brussels, Michigan, and Wales, and he was a member of many foreign academies; he was vice-president of several learned societies, and president of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies from 1937 to 1945, of the International Association of Papyrologists from 1947 to 1955, and of the Classical Association in 1955.<br>
<br>Unassuming, courteous, kindly, always accessible, a man of wide sympathies and considerable power of enjoyment, Bell had many friends at all levels. He was a lifelong supporter of the Labour Party and in matters of religion an agnostic for most of his working life. Shortly after the Second World War, however, for reasons he made clear in a volume of essays, <span class="italic">The Crisis of our Time</span> (1954), he returned to the Christian faith. On leaving the British Museum in 1944 he retired to Wales, where he had always spent his holidays, and in his later years played an active part in the intellectual life of the principality and in that of the Church in Wales, of whose governing body he became a member.<br>
<br>Bell married Mabel Winifred, daughter of Ernest Ayling, in 1911; there were three sons of the marriage, of whom the eldest and the youngest survived him. He died on 22 January 1967 at his home, Brogynin, Iorwerth Avenue, Aberystwyth, a week after his wife's death.<br>
