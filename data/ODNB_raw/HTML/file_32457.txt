<span class="headword">Ross,  George  Clunies</span>  (1842&#150;1910), <span class="occ">unofficial ruler and eventual owner of the Cocos Islands</span>, was born on 20 June 1842 on New Selma (now Home Island), one of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the southern Indian Ocean, the eldest of the six sons and three daughters of John George Clunies Ross (<i>d</i>. 1871) and his Javanese wife, S'pia (later, on baptism and marriage, Anglicized to Sophia) Dupong.<br>
<br>The remarkable history of the Clunies Ross family on the Cocos began when John Clunies Ross, a Shetlander of Jacobite ancestry and grandfather of George, visited the then uninhabited islands in December 1825. He decided to settle there with his family and some craftsmen who could double as a ship's crew, and create a trading depot and refitting station. He returned to the islands in February 1827, but unfortunately the eccentric Alexander Hare had preceded him. While Ross wanted publicity, Hare sought seclusion with his entourage of about a hundred, mainly from Java, Borneo, and Malaya. The two men quarrelled, Ross's craftsmen left, and in 1831 Hare also departed. Ross was then responsible for everyone. When neither Hare nor his executors claimed the islands or their people, Ross employed all those who wanted work in collecting and husking the wild coconuts and in making coconut oil. After his death in 1854, his son, John George Clunies Ross, expanded production and paid off his debts.<br>
<br>The Cocos Islands were annexed by Britain (by mistake) in 1857. In 1859 J. G. Clunies Ross made his only visit to Britain, to inquire into the curious annexation and to ask the government for a land title and administrative authority (both were refused); he also purchased milling machinery. He took with him George and some of the other children, to begin their formal education. George was placed in Elizabeth College, Guernsey, and went on to study mechanical and marine engineering in Glasgow, probably at Anderson's University. In 1862 a severe cyclone struck the Cocos; George was recalled to help run his father's estate. He was invaluable, yet was not allowed full discretion. But, athletic, versatile, articulate, and personable, he won admiration from the islands' people and subsequent visitors for his skills, for confronting a man who had run amok, for his keen observation, and for his courage as a sailor.<br>
<br>George Clunies Ross married Inin (<i>d</i>. 1889) from one of the islands' families in 1868; nine of their children survived to adulthood. In 1871 George's father died, leaving the islands, and their plant and buildings, to him. Like his father and grandfather, George Clunies Ross kept law and order over the population by the force of his personality and the co-operation of the heads of the islands' families. There were no police officers, no gaol, no written laws, and an almost complete absence of serious crime. Work was still offered to all. Clunies Ross sought new markets and products, at first unsuccessfully. He disliked compulsion: unless they wished to stay, he returned to the Dutch East Indies the convict labourers in their last years of servitude with whom his father had augmented the Cocos workforce. Instead he imported contract labourers&#151;about thirty at a time&#151;from Bantam, encouraging them to remain and send for their wives (some had married women from the Cocos) when their (at first unwritten) contracts expired. By 1880 Clunies Ross had a new export: copra, the dried and shredded pulp of the coconut. It became the mainstay of the islands' economy. Cocos coconut oil had sold at a premium because of its exceptional sweetness. Cocos copra, sun-dried, did likewise, and copra had an expanding market in Europe.<br>
<br>An era of great prosperity for the Clunies Ross family began. Clunies Ross built new drying sheds and a light railway and jetty, and Oceania House, made from Glasgow bricks, was started. He organized copra shipment, and supervised production carefully. He completed the schooner whose keel had been laid down by his father, naming her the <i>J. G. Clunies Ross</i>. In 1884, with two brothers and seven of his children, he sailed her to Britain, where she was registered A1 at Lloyd's. The children were put in schools and he then pursued his further goal: to acquire the title to the islands' land and the authority denied his father and grandfather. In particular he wanted these to aid his negotiations for a cable station, for which the mid-ocean position of the Cocos was ideal. An official inspection of the islands and the Clunies Ross regime followed. In most respects the islanders and the Clunies Rosses were found satisfactory, even admirable, and George Clunies Ross was given a grant-in-fee of the islands' land and made a magistrate in 1886. He did not use magistrate's powers, however, since they required written laws. An annual supervisory visit was paid to the Cocos from the Straits Settlements for some time. The cable station was opened in 1901. Good income from copra continued, and Clunies Ross made several visits to Britain, enjoying theatres, Cowes week, and London clubs.<br>
<br>Misfortunes had also begun, however. Inin, described as a &#145;good and amiable woman&#146; by a governor of the Straits Settlements at a time when skin colour too often dictated judgement, died in 1889. In 1895 Clunies Ross married Ayesha, also from the islands. They had no children, and she outlived him. Around the time of Inin's death, Clunies Ross's agents failed, wiping out a year's income and a favourable balance; he lost a succession of vessels, only partly insured; and his son and young relatives conducted a harsher regime in his absences, occasionally using corporal punishment to maintain the <i>status quo</i>. This caused unease in Singapore, but was allowed to continue. In contentious rivalry and then in uneasy partnership, and finally as a major shareholder, Clunies Ross benefited from the phosphate mine on the Indian Ocean's Christmas Island. Income from these shares was later essential to the economy of the Cocos.<br>
<br>In 1909 a devastating hurricane struck the islands, demolishing almost every building except Oceania House. George Clunies Ross, in ill health, was in Britain at the time, and he died at Ventnor on the Isle of Wight on 7 July 1910. He was buried at Bonchurch churchyard there. However, his body was disinterred and reburied on the Cocos in 1915. In the last of numerous wills, he left the islands and everything pertaining to running them to his eldest son, John Sydney, as life tenant; only his personal estate was divided. He did not have dominion to compare with that, say, of Brooke of Borneo, but he was an exemplar of energy and enterprise, with no qualms about his right to govern or his right to personal fortune, and was very much a man of his time.<br>
