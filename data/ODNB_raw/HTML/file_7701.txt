<span class="headword">Dixon,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1740&#150;1811), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, the fourth son of Thomas Dixon (<i>d</i>. 1758), a hosier, of Cork Hill, Dublin, was born about 1740, probably in Dublin. He trained at the drawing school of the Dublin Society and possibly then worked for his brother Samuel and on plates for the linen-printing works at Leixlip. In 1760 he engraved John Rocque's four-sheet map of co. Dublin and in 1761 he produced portraits of admirals Boscawen and Granby for the <span class="italic">Dublin Annual Register</span>. In 1763, from Cork Hill, he published his first mezzotint, a portrait of Nicholas, Viscount Taafe, after Robert Hunter. This won him a premium of 5 guineas from the Dublin Society and also inspired admiring verses in <span class="italic">Sleator's Public Gazetter</span>.<br>
<br>Dixon arrived in London about 1765 and was proposed for a fellowship of the Society of Artists in May 1766, when he first exhibited there. This exhibited work (1766&#150;75) was dominated by large portraits after Joshua Reynolds, but Dixon also showed subjects from old masters and after other contemporary painters. In 1769 he was one of those appointed to arrange models at the society's teaching academy in Maiden Lane. He was a director in 1770&#150;71, and again from 1772 to 1775, and regularly attended meetings. His sympathy with the Wilkite cause was signalled by prints of its leading spokesmen: he engraved his own portrait of William Beckford and Robert Edge Pine's portraits of Wilkes and Sir Joseph Mawbey.<br>
<br>Most of Dixon's early plates were published by William Wynne Ryland, among them five of the seven Reynolds mezzotints that he exhibited. His work was distinguished and included several of the most highly rated plates of the day, notably <span class="italic">A Tigress</span>, after George Stubbs (1772), <span class="italic">An Incantation</span>, after John Hamilton Mortimer (1773), Reynolds's most celebrated history painting, <span class="italic">Ugolino</span> (1774), and two plates of David Garrick&#151;as Abel Drugger, after Johann Zoffany (1771), and as Richard III, after Nathaniel Dance (1772). When he published another political design, <span class="italic">The Oracle</span>, in 1774, Dixon was at the height of his powers and his fame. His style was distinctive&#151;featuring dramatic contrasts with marked use of etching and of drypoint burr to create rich blacks. Unusually, he signed his plates in the image, a self-conscious assertion of his prowess as an artist. He also designed and etched a few landscapes and such droll mezzotints as <span class="italic">The Dentist, or, Teeth Drawn with a Touch</span> (1768).<br>
<br>Dixon moved, in 1771, to Kempe's Row, Chelsea, and then, if not before, he must have made the acquaintance of his neighbour and landlord Nicholas Kempe, a bullion porter to the Royal Mint and one of the original proprietors of Ranelagh Gardens, and of his beautiful wife, Ann, the daughter of Henry Meriton of Chelsea. Kempe died in 1774, and on 15 July 1775 the tall, handsome artist married his widow at St George's, Hanover Square. He now enjoyed a life of leisure: in 1776 Johann Georg Wille, a celebrated German engraver living in Paris, noted in his journal that &#145;M. Dixon, formerly an engraver in London, but having become very rich through his marriage and having abandoned his art, came to see me while travelling for pleasure&#146;  (<span class="italic">M&eacute;moires et journal</span>, 2.52). Dixon was on friendly terms with Edmund Burke and Garrick. In 1801 he joined the Society of Arts and wrote a series of pamphlets advocating the improvement of the fisheries in Ireland. He died in December 1811 at Phillimore Place, Kensington, and his will was proved in January 1812. His prints may be found in the British Museum and the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale in Paris.<br>
