<span class="headword">Vandenhoff,  John M.</span>  (1790&#150;1861), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 31 March 1790 in Salisbury, where his family, of Dutch extraction and said to have come to Britain in the train of William of Orange, appear to have been dyers. He was educated at the Jesuits' college in Stonyhurst, Lancashire, with a view to his becoming a priest. For a year he taught classics in a school. His first appearance on the stage was at Salisbury, on 11 May 1808, as Osmond in M. G. Lewis's <span class="italic">The Castle Spectre</span>. After playing at Exeter, Weymouth, and elsewhere with Edmund Kean, and at Swansea with John Cooper, he made his first appearance at Bath in October 1813 as Jaffier in Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>. In 1814 he became a member of the company at the English Opera House (Lyceum) under Arnold, where he was the original Count d'Herleim in <span class="italic">Frederick the Great</span>. The same year he made his first appearance in Liverpool, where he became a great favourite. After playing in Manchester, Dublin, and elsewhere, in December 1820, as Vandenhoff from Liverpool, he made his d&eacute;but at Covent Garden, as King Lear. During the season he was seen as Sir Giles Overreach, Coriolanus, Pizarro, and Rolla. He also played Rob Roy, Gambia in <span class="italic">The Slave</span>, and Mirandola in place of W. C. Macready, who was ill. He was the first Leicester in <span class="italic">Kenilworth</span>.<br>
<br>In 1822 Vandenhoff retired, in some disgust, at the treatment he received from his manager, who seemed inclined to allot the best parts to Charles Young, Macready, or Charles Kemble. Vandenhoff's subsequent decision to perform in Liverpool, however, led to what became known as the &#145;Salter riots&#146;, the object of which was to drive Vandenhoff away and secure his position for Salter, a local actor. The situation was resolved by the managers Banks and Lewis, who engaged both tragedians and alternated them in the leading characters in such plays as <span class="italic">Othello</span>, <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, and <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, until Vandenhoff came to be acknowledged as the better actor and Salter gradually receded. In 1822 Vandenhoff also appeared in Edinburgh as Coriolanus; he returned there in 1826 as Macbeth, and again in February 1830, when he played Cassius and Othello. He was a favourite in the city, where his Coriolanus inspired great enthusiasm. He appears to have played there between the months of January and March for many consecutive years. In 1834 he was seen at the Haymarket in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>. In 1835&#150;6 he played at both Drury Lane and Covent Garden&#151;alternate nights being given to opera. On the transference of Talfourd's <span class="italic">Ion</span> from Covent Garden to the Haymarket in 1836, Vandenhoff played Adrastus, in which, however, he was not very successful. In September 1837 he went to America and made his d&eacute;but at the National Theatre in New York; he went on to play Caius Marcus in <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span> at the Chesnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia.<br>
<br>On his return to England, when Macready opened Covent Garden in September 1838, Vandenhoff became a member of the company, and played Richelieu, Falconbridge, Cassius, Hotspur, and many other parts. After 1839, when Macready's management of Covent Garden ceased, Vandenhoff appeared chiefly in the provinces, although he was seen occasionally at Drury Lane.<br>
<br>In January 1857 Vandenhoff, with his daughter, paid a starring visit to Edinburgh; his last performance there was on 26 February, as Wolsey in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, with Henry Irving playing Surrey. On 29 October 1858, at Liverpool, Vandenhoff took his farewell of the stage as Brutus and Wolsey. He died on 4 October 1861 at his home, 34 North Bank, Regent's Park, London.<br>
<br>Vandenhoff left several children, most of whom also took to the stage. A son, <a name="cosubject_62380"></a><span class="headword">George Vandenhoff</span>  (1820&#150;1885), <span class="occ">actor and lawyer</span>, born on 18 February 1820, made his d&eacute;but at Covent Garden on 14 October 1839, as Leon in Beaumont and Fletcher's <span class="italic">Rule a Wife and Have a Wife</span>. Among other parts later played by him at that theatre was Mercutio in Madame Vestris's production of <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>. In August 1842 he took his farewell of the English stage, as Hamlet, and migrated to America, where he made his d&eacute;but, as Hamlet once again, at the Park Theatre, New York, followed by appearances at the Walnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia. For the next ten years he lived mainly in New York, where he staged a translation of Sophocles' <span class="italic">Antigone</span> with music by Mendelssohn (1845), played Claude Melnotte at Wallack's Theatre (1852), gave poetry readings, and taught elocution. On 20 August 1855, in Boston, he married an actress, Miss Mackean, who had appeared in New York and Philadelphia, but on her marriage decided to retire from the stage. Soon Vandenhoff returned to England. He ceased to act after he was called to the bar in November 1858. He continued to give poetry readings, however, and published a volume of theatrical anecdotes, <span class="italic">Dramatic Reminiscences</span> (1860). His final appearance on stage was with Genevi&egrave;ve Ward in 1878, when he played Wolsey in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> and Gloster in <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>.<br>
<br>The only one of John Vandenhoff's children to attain celebrity status on the English stage was his daughter <a name="cosubject_28064"></a><span class="headword">Charlotte Elizabeth Vandenhoff</span>  (1818&#150;1860)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born in Liverpool and made her first appearance at Drury Lane as Juliet on 11 April 1836. She went from there to Covent Garden and the Haymarket, and succeeded in establishing herself as a capable actress in parts in which delicacy and feeling rather than strength or passion were required. She won acceptance as Imogen, Cordelia, and Pauline in <span class="italic">The Lady of Lyons</span>, and in 1837, at the Haymarket, was the first Lydia in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">The Love Chase</span>. In October 1839 she made her American d&eacute;but at the National Theatre, New York, as Julia in <span class="italic">The Hunchback</span>, a role she repeated in November at the Chesnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia. Her chief triumph was as Antigone in a translation from Sophocles at Covent Garden on 2 January 1845, in which her father played Creon. In January 1855, at the St James's, she was Alcestis in a translation by Spicer from Euripides. She was fair in hair and complexion, symmetrical, with gentle mobile features, and was taxed, perhaps unjustly, with imitating Helen Faucit. Charlotte Vandenhoff retained her maiden name to the last, though she married, on 7 July 1856 by licence at St Mary's Church, Hull, Thomas Swinbourne, an actor well known in the provinces and not unknown in London. This marriage she sought within a month to repudiate. She revisited America in 1858. She was taken ill in Birmingham, and died in Handsworth on 31 July 1860. She was the author of <span class="italic">Woman's Heart</span>, produced in 1852 at the Haymarket, a comedy in which she herself played the heroine.<br>
