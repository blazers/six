<span class="headword">Le Keux family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1800&#150;1885), <span class="occ">engravers</span>, came to prominence with <a name="cosubject_16412"></a><span class="headword">John Le Keux</span>  (1783&#150;1846), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, who was born in Sun Street, Bishopsgate, London, on 4 June 1783, and baptized, at St Botolph without Bishopsgate, in September, the son of Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dyer, and Peter Le Keux, a wholesale pewter manufacturer who came from a large and flourishing Huguenot family. While apprenticed to his father John Le Keux began experiments in engraving on the quart pots of London publicans and, in 1800, turned his attention to copperplate. Some of his drawings were praised by James Basire II (1769&#150;1822), the engraver to whom his younger brother <a href="#cosubject_16411">Henry [<i>see below</i>]</a> was already apprenticed, and he was consequently transferred to Basire by his father for the remaining four years of his apprenticeship. Under Basire he acquired that peculiar skill in architectural engraving which characterized his work, developing a very fine yet free style in the linear manner. John Le Keux married Sara Sophia, daughter of John Lingard, on 27 September 1809, at St Mary's, Lambeth; their son <a href="#cosubject_16413">John Henry Le Keux [<i>see below</i>]</a> inherited his father's skill in engraving.<br>
<br>The publications of John Britton generated much of John Le Keux's best work from the outset of his career, and it in turn contributed very largely to the success of those volumes. He produced several of the plates for <span class="italic">Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain</span> (1807&#150;26), 400 plates for <span class="italic">Cathedral Antiquities of Great Britain</span> (1814&#150;35), and an even greater number, after various artists, for <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the Architecture and Archaeology of the Middle Ages</span> (1836&#150;9). Of equal importance was his contribution to publications illustrated by A. C. Pugin, including <span class="italic">Specimens of Gothic Architecture</span> (1821&#150;3) and <span class="italic">Examples of Gothic Architecture</span> (1831&#150;6), both written by E. J. Willson. With his brother Henry he engraved Pugin's illustrations to <span class="italic">Engraved Specimens of the Architectural Antiquities of Normandy</span>, edited by Britton (1828). Other architectural subjects included engravings after J. P. Neale for <span class="italic">Abbey Church of St Peter, Westminster</span> (1818&#150;23), with a text by E. W. Brayley, and for <span class="italic">Views of the most Interesting Collegiate and Parochial Churches in Great Britain</span>, the first volume of which was co-written by John Le Keux and J. P. Neale (1824&#150;5). His engravings after Frederick Mackenzie for James Ingram's <span class="italic">Memorials of Oxford</span> (1837) sparked his own publication <span class="italic">Memorials of Cambridge</span>, with plates after Mackenzie and J. A. Bell, and a text by Thomas Wright and the Revd Harry Longueville Jones (1841&#150;2); some of these plates were subsequently used for C. H. Cooper's <span class="italic">Memorials of Cambridge</span> (1860&#150;66). Of the <span class="italic">Memorials of Oxford</span> &#145;an early reviewer noted approvingly that the publication of views of Oxford's &#147;halls of learning imposes a check upon future innovators&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hist. U. Oxf.</span> 6: <span class="italic">19th-cent. Oxf.</span>, xvii).<br>
<br>Le Keux also engraved two plates after J. M. W. Turner: <span class="italic">Rome from the Farnese Gardens</span> for James Hakewill's <span class="italic">A Picturesque Tour of Italy</span> (1818&#150;20) and <span class="italic">St Agatha's Abbey, Easby</span>, for T. D. Whitaker's <span class="italic">An History of Richmondshire</span> (1823).<br>
<br>John Le Keux died on 2 April 1846, and was buried at Bunhill Fields cemetery, London. The poet and humorist Thomas Hood was apprenticed to John Le Keux and his brother Henry. Lionel Cust mentioned that John Le Keux &#145;may be considered, perhaps, the best engraver of his day in the somewhat mechanical style then in vogue&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). Le Keux often worked for up to sixteen hours a day. Nineteenth-century commentators had noted the important contribution his atmospheric architectural engravings made to the revival of Gothic architecture in Britain. These have remained popular and are often reproduced. It is for his fine engravings of Gothic and Gothic revival architecture that John Le Keux is chiefly remembered.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_16411"></a><span class="headword">Henry Le Keux</span>  (1787&#150;1868), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born on 13 June 1787, and baptized at St Dunstan's, Stepney, the younger brother of John Le Keux. As apprentice to the younger James Basire, Henry Le Keux worked on the <span class="italic">Oxford Almanack</span> and on plates for the Society of Antiquaries. Then, about 1808, he established himself as an architectural engraver by contributing to such of Britton's publications as <span class="italic">The Beauties of England and Wales</span> (1801&#150;18). Associated with his brother John in some of his architectural work, he contributed to <span class="italic">Cathedral Antiquities of Great Britain</span>, and produced the famed plate <span class="italic">The Interior of Henry VII's Chapel</span> for J. P. Neale's <span class="italic">Westminster Abbey</span>. He also collaborated with Edward Blore, engraving several fine plates for his <span class="italic">Monumental Remains</span> (1826), of which publication he was part proprietor.<br>
<br>Henry Le Keux was equally known as an engraver of illustrations to literary works. His work after J. M. W. Turner includes seven plates for Sir Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Provincial Antiquities</span> (1826) and two for Scott's <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> (1834), two rare steel plates for Samuel Rogers's <span class="italic">Italy</span> (1830), and <span class="italic">St Herbert's Island</span> for Rogers's <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1834), the last of which he considered his finest achievement. His engravings after John Martin appeared in various of the fashionable annuals, including <span class="italic">Forget-me-Not</span> (1829) and <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span> (1832).<br>
<br>As a mature engraver Henry Le Keux returned to work on the <span class="italic">Oxford Almanack</span>, advising on the change to steel engraving and then engraving five issues (1832&#150;9). In 1838 he was consulted by the Bank of England, together with Henry Corbould and William Wyon, regarding a new design of banknote. He then retired from engraving and moved to Bocking in Essex, where he worked for Samuel Courtauld &amp; Co., crape manufacturers, until a short time before his death. As a member of the Associated Society of Engravers he engraved some paintings by Canaletto and Claude in the National Gallery, his last work being after the latter's <span class="italic">Embarkation of St Ursula</span> (1846). He died, apparently unmarried, after a short illness on 11 October 1868, and was buried at Halstead, Essex. While he did not attain quite the same degree of proficiency as his brother, Henry Le Keux engraved the whole of his plates himself, without the assistance of pupils.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_16413"></a><span class="headword">John Henry Le Keux</span>  (1812&#150;1896), <span class="occ">engraver and illustrator</span>, was born in Argyll Street, Euston Road, London, on 23 March 1812, the son of John and Sara Le Keux. He studied under James Basire III (1796&#150;1869) before assisting his father and adopting his style. His first independent plate was engraved in 1832, after Samuel Prout's <span class="italic">City and Bridge of Prague</span>, for the annual <span class="italic">Continental</span>.<br>
<br>J. H. Le Keux made his name as an architectural engraver during the 1830s on such publications as George Godwin's <span class="italic">A Short Account of the Temple Church, London</span> (1837), illustrated by R. W. Billings, and <span class="italic">The Travellers' Club House</span> (1839), illustrated by J. Hewitt. However, his most significant achievements in the medium were produced two decades later, when he began to work with John Ruskin on the author's illustrations to <span class="italic">The Stones of Venice</span> (1851&#150;3) and <span class="italic">Modern Painters</span> (1856&#150;60). Ruskin became friendly with Le Keux and paid him to teach line-engraving to George Allen, his assistant and publisher; in 1890 Allen received Le Keux's engraving tools. During the same period he also engraved plates for C. H. Hartshorne's <span class="italic">Illustrations of Alnwick, Prudhoe, and Warkworth</span> (1857), after T. O. S. Jewitt's illustrations, and J. H. Parker's <span class="italic">Mediaeval Architecture of Chester</span> (1858). At the close of the decade the Norwegian government employed him to execute thirty-one large plates of Trondheim Cathedral, after illustrations by F. W. Schiertz and H. E. Schirmer; they were published in 1859 with an accompanying text by Peter Andreas Munch. A talented draughtsman, J. H. Le Keux exhibited architectural drawings at the Royal Academy (1853&#150;65) and engraved plates after his own designs for the <span class="italic">Oxford Almanack</span> (1855&#150;70). He also wrote several papers on medieval armour and ornamental metalwork, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Archaeological Institute</span> and the proceedings of other antiquarian societies.<br>
<br>On 23 June 1841 J. H. Le Keux patented an improvement in line-engraving whereby two steel or copper plates were employed, one carrying the subject, the other a &#145;ground&#146;. Colour could be used, and two or more plates employed. It is uncertain why he never made use of this commercially, though it has been variously suggested that it was too expensive or time-consuming, and that it would interfere with high-quality engraving.<br>
<br>On 16 April 1863 Le Keux married Frances Andrews, and a year later he moved to Durham. There he acted as manager to a firm of publishers and booksellers with which his wife was connected. He continued to produce engravings and paint in watercolours for his own amusement into his seventies. He died at his home, 26 Old Elvet, Durham, on 4 February 1896, and was buried in St Nicholas's Church in that city.<br>
