<span class="headword">Stokes,  David</span>  (1590<span class="mult">x</span>92&#150;1669), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was a native of Lincolnshire. Having been a scholar of Westminster he matriculated as a pensioner from Trinity College, Cambridge, at Easter 1611, graduating BA in 1615 and proceeding MA in 1618. In that year he was admitted to a fellowship at Peterhouse, holding it until 1625, during which tenure he acted as college bursar in 1621&#150;2. On 17 and 18 March 1622 Stokes was ordained deacon and priest in the diocese of Peterborough, and on 7 June 1624 he was admitted as a fellow of Eton College. On 11 July 1628 he was appointed prebend of the third stall of the collegiate church of Windsor, and installed on the following day. On 23 October 1629 he was collated as precentor of the diocese of Chichester and installed on 26 October, resigning the position by 19 March 1631. In 1630 he was awarded a DD at Cambridge. Stokes was also instituted to three rectories, that of Brinklow, Warwickshire, in 1625, of Binfield, Berkshire, which he held from 1631 to 1638, and of Everdon, Northamptonshire, where he was instituted on 19 September 1638.<br>
<br>By 1634, when their first child, Richard, was born at Aldingbourne, near Chichester, Stokes had married Elizabeth, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19031/', "Richard Mountague (d. 1641)")</script>, then bishop of Chichester, but from May 1638 bishop of Norwich. On 14 November 1639 Mountague wrote to Sir John Lambe about the advowson of West Halton, in Lincolnshire, which he had given to Stokes, but which was also the subject of a long-standing dispute among the higher clergy. &#145;My right is unquestionable, and I hope shall be indefeasible&#146;, claimed Mountague. Whether or not he and Stokes were thwarted, political events quickly rendered the wrangle nugatory. Though Stokes was instituted to the vicarage of Urchfont in Wiltshire in 1644 on presentation of the dean and chapter of Windsor, he had resigned by the time of the admission of his successor, William Shephard.<br>
<br>On 12 August 1645, a few months before the fall of the city, Stokes was incorporated DD at Oxford. Shortly afterwards, the university press issued his <span class="italic">Paraphrastical Explication of the Prophecie of Habakkuk</span>, which reached the London bookseller George Thomason on 8 January 1646. Extolling the &#145;king, whose unwearied patience and clemency, and frequent loving overtures of peace, deserve a greater conquest of hearts than ever was attained by the sword&#146; the author wished<blockquote>that they that have made us so miserable, specially the prime incendiaries, and main fomenters of that under which we groan, could be well chidden out of their new fancies and quarrels and hypocrisies into the old way of true godliness which partakes of that wisdom from above. (D. Stokes, <span class="italic">Paraphrastical Explication of the Prophecie of Habakkuk</span>, 1646, 22&#150;3)</blockquote>The House of Lords summarized his recent biography: Stokes had &#145;for divers year together deserted his fellowship, and adhered to the forces raised against the parliament, and hath resided in the King's quarters and garrisons in open hostility&#146; and it may not be thought especially surprising that on 4 October 1647 they ordered his removal and replacement at Eton by Joseph Symonds  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 9.486).<br>
<br>Stokes's movements during the years of the Commonwealth and protectorate are unknown, but in 1660 he was restored to the canonry of Windsor and the fellowship at Eton. He died on 10 May 1669, aged seventy-seven or seventy-eight, and was survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and children Richard, Anne, Mary, and Frances. He was buried at Windsor.<br>
