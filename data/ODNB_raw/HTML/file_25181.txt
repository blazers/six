<span class="headword">Seymour,  Thomas</span>, Baron Seymour of Sudeley  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1509, <em>d.</em> 1549), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the fourth of six sons of Sir John Seymour (1473/4&#150;1536), landowner and courtier, of Wolf Hall, Wiltshire, and his wife, Margery (<i>d</i>. 1550), daughter of Sir Henry Wentworth of Nettlestead, Suffolk. His elder brothers included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25159/', "Edward Seymour (c.1500&#150;1552), later duke of Somerset")</script> and lord protector, and Sir Henry Seymour (<i>b</i>. in or before 1503, <i>d</i>. 1578) of Marwell in Hampshire, and one of his four sisters was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14647/', "Jane (1508/9&#150;1537)")</script>, third wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12955/', "Henry VIII (1491&#150;1547)")</script>. Sir John Seymour was a minor but reasonably prosperous gentleman with property in Wiltshire and Somerset.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer15301547"></a>Early career, 1530&#150;1547</h2>By 1530 Thomas Seymour was in service to the leading courtier Sir Francis Bryan (<i>b</i>. in or before 1492, <i>d</i>. 1550). He rose to prominence on Henry's marriage to Jane on 30 May 1536; he became a gentleman of the privy chamber by 2 October and was named joint master steward of Chirk and Holt in Denbighshire and of other manors and castles in the Welsh marches the following year. On 18 October 1537, six days after Jane gave birth to Edward, prince of Wales (1537&#150;1553), Seymour was knighted. Further reward came with grants of former monastic land in Essex, Hampshire, and Berkshire in March 1538. Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, was keen for an alliance with the Seymour family and on 14 July suggested to the king that his daughter Mary Fitzroy, duchess of Richmond, marry Seymour. Henry approached Seymour, who preferred Sir Thomas Cromwell to have &#145;the mayning of the matter&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 13/1, no. 1375). Seymour was involved in diplomatic missions to Fran&ccedil;ois I in 1538 and to Ferdinand in Vienna in summer 1542, witnessing campaigning against the Turks in Hungary. With Dr Nicholas Wotton he was sent as resident ambassador to Mary of Hungary, regent of the Low Countries, on 30 April 1543 with a &#145;diet&#146; of &pound;1 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per day. However, he was recalled in mid-July.<br>
<br>Seymour played a more prominent role in social occasions at court, participating in tournaments at Whitehall Palace on 1, 3, and 5 May 1540. In summer 1543 he was marshal of the English army in the Low Countries, serving under Sir John Wallop. This military experience may explain his appointment as master of the ordnance for life on 18 April 1544, a striking mark of royal favour, and he took part in the capture of Boulogne on 14 September. In October of that year he was appointed an admiral of the fleet, and he was much involved in naval action in 1545. On 29 November he was rewarded with Hampton Place outside Temple Bar, which he renamed Seymour Place. He was returned as knight of the shire for Wiltshire in 1545, possibly through the influence of Edward Seymour (now earl of Hertford), but his activities in the House of Commons are unrecorded. Various other local offices, rewards, and commissions followed. By the end of Henry's reign Seymour's annual income was an impressive &pound;458 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. In June 1546 Norfolk again asked Henry to arrange marriage between Seymour and his daughter, but Henry Howard, earl of Surrey, was bitterly opposed to the match, saying it was beneath his sister. Seymour himself would have preferred to marry <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4893/', "Katherine (1512&#150;1548)")</script>, the second child and elder daughter of Sir Thomas Parr of Kendal, Westmorland, and his wife, Maud, and widow of John Neville, third Baron Latimer. He courted Katherine briefly early in 1543 before she caught the king's eye. On 23 January 1547, five days before the king's death, Seymour was sworn of the privy council, possibly despite Henry's objections. Henry named Seymour one of the assistants to the executors of his will and left him &pound;200. According to the principal secretary, Sir William Paget, Henry wished Seymour to be ennobled. He was duly created Baron Seymour of Sudeley on 16 February, with an additional grant of lands valued at &pound;500 per annum, nominated a knight of the Garter the next day, and installed on 23 May.<h2>
<a name="Lordadmiralprivycouncillorandtraitor15471549"></a>Lord admiral, privy councillor, and traitor, 1547&#150;1549</h2>At the beginning of Edward VI's reign Hertford seized power and had himself promoted duke of Somerset and installed as lord protector and governor of the king's person. Although he had been ennobled and appointed lord high admiral on 17 February (and relinquished the office of master of the ordnance on 26 March in return), Seymour was dissatisfied with his place in the new regime and embarked on a series of intrigues that ultimately cost him his life. He was incensed that his brother should be both lord protector and governor: those functions should, he claimed, be divided and he should have one. He confessed that he had searched through chronicles for precedents and found them in the minority of Henry VI. So discontent was he that during the Scottish military campaign in autumn 1547, despite his office of lord admiral, he stayed in London while his brother went north to fight. Somerset won a great victory at the battle of Pinkie on 10 September, but then left the borders very hastily without pursuing his military advantage because &#145;il apprit, par un courier qu'on lui depecha expres, que l'amiral son frere formait a la cour un puissant parti contre lui, et qu'il avait pris des mesures secretes avec le roi meme; pour lui enlever la charge de gouverneur de ce jeune prince&#146;  (Abb&eacute; de Verdot, 1.129&#150;31). It was probably then that Seymour got the king to write a letter in support of his marriage to Katherine, and possibly prepared a letter to be presented in parliament, which he hoped Edward would sign, stating that Seymour should be governor. Generally Somerset succeeded in keeping his brother away from the king, but Seymour exploited his contacts with John Fowler, one of the grooms of the privy chamber, and the royal tutor Sir John Cheke. On several occasions Seymour gave &pound;5 and &pound;10, and as much as &pound;40, to Fowler and Cheke to give to the king. Seymour had told the king, &#145;ye are a beggarly king ye have no monie to play or to geve&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 1729, fol. 9<i>r</i>). He described how Edward moaned, &#145;my Unkel off Sumerset deylyth very hardly with me and kepyth me so strayt that I cane not have mony at my wylle but my lord Admyral both sendes me mony and gyves me mony&#146;  (Hatfield House, Hertfordshire, Cecil MS 150, fol. 112<i>r</i>). Seymour was clearly trying to use the king's understandable desire for more spending money to insinuate himself into his favour. If Seymour and Edward had lived longer, such a relationship might have had significant consequences.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Seymour quickly and secretly married Henry's widow, Katherine, probably in May or June. This action openly defied Somerset and the privy council. It was pointed out that had Katherine soon become pregnant, there would have been uncertainty about whether the child was Seymour's or Henry's. The marriage led to friction between the Seymour brothers and their wives, not least over ceremonial precedence, and over Katherine's jewels. Even before Katherine's death on 5 September 1548, shortly after giving birth to Mary Seymour (1548&#150;1550), Seymour had been flirting with Princess Elizabeth, who was resident in their household at Chelsea and Hanworth in Middlesex. Elizabeth's governess and closest servant, Katherine Astley, testified how:<blockquote>He wold com many mornyngs into the said Lady Elizabeths chamber &hellip; And if she were up, he wold bid her good Morrow, and ax how she did, and strike hir upon the bak, or on the buttocks familiarly &hellip; And if she were in hir bed he wold put open the curteyns, and bid hir good morrow, and make as though he wold come at hir: And she wold go further in the bed, so that he could not com at hir; And one mornyng he strove to have kissed hir in hir Bed. (Hatfield House, Hertfordshire, Cecil MS 150, fol. 85<i>r</i>)</blockquote>&#145;One tyme&#146;, according to Astley, &#145;the [dowager] Quene, suspecting the often accesse of the Admirall to the Lady Elizabeth's Grace, cam sodenly upon them, wher they were all alone, (he having her in his Armes)&#146;  (Hatfield House, Hertfordshire, Cecil MS 150, fol. 80<i>v</i>). After Katherine's death Seymour was clearly interested in proposing to Elizabeth; the tone of Astley's testimony suggests that Elizabeth herself was far from reluctant, though aware of the political sensitivities.<br>
<br>Seymour tried to recruit several noblemen to support his various causes, often speaking with them on their way to or from parliament. Henry Grey, third marquess of Dorset, was won over by Seymour's promise to marry his daughter, Lady Jane Grey, to the king. Thomas Wriothesley, first earl of Southampton, testified how on their way to dinner during parliament, &#145;after a litle comen talk&#146;, Seymour said to him, referring to Southampton's surrender of the office of lord chancellor in early 1547, &#145;ha my lord of Southampton, you were well handeled touching yor office. Why shuld you not have it again?&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 10/6/15). He also attempted to assemble a group of associates and servants in the Commons. In autumn 1547 he threatened to disrupt the parliament. He was accused of saying, &#145;I have herd spekyng of a black parlament and they usse me as they doo begyn by goddes preshios soule I wyll make the blakiste parleament that ever was in England&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 10/6/7).<br>
<br>Seymour was very much aware of the need to build local support. To Dorset he said that he should not trust the gentlemen of the county too much &#145;for they have sumwhat to loose&#146;. Instead:<blockquote>I wold rather advise you to make muche of the head yeomen and frankelyns of the cuntreye, specially those that be the ringleaders, for they be the men that be best hable to perswade the multitude and may best bring the number and therefore I wold wishe you to make muche of them, and to goo to their houses, nowe to oon and nowe to an other, caryeng with you a flagon or two of wyne, and a pasty of veneson, and to use a familiaritie with them, for so shall you cause them to love you, and be assured to have them at your commaundemente.</blockquote>&#145;This maner (I may tel you)&#146;, Seymour continued, &#145;I entende to use miself&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 10/6/7). His &#145;conception of local power was competitive&#146;  (Bernard, 222). He advised Dorset &#145;to kepe my house in Warwikeshire &hellip; because that war a cuntrey full of men, but chiefly to match with my lorde of Warwike [John Dudley, earl of Warwick], so as he should not be hable to matche with me there&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 10/6/7). Sir William Sharington, the under-treasurer of the Bristol mint, testified how Seymour:<blockquote>Hathe divers tymes caused me to loke with him uppon a cart of England in the loking wherof he wold many tymes shewe me howe strong he was, what nombres of men he was able to make, how farre his landes and dominions did stretche, And howe his said landes lay betwene his house of Brouham and the Holtehe. (TNA: PRO, SP 10/6/13)</blockquote>Dorset said that Seymour &#145;used sondry tymes to shewe me as we rodde togithers the cowntrees rounde about sayeng all these which dwell in thes parties be my frendes&#146;. &#145;And so he did vaunt &hellip; that he had as great a nombre of gentlemen that loved hym, as eny noble man in England &hellip; And further said that he thought that he had more gentlemen that louved hym than the Lord Protector had and upon that he said he was happye that hath freends in this world what so ever shuld chaunce&#146;  (Hatfield House, Hertfordshire, Cecil MS 150, fol. 93<i>v</i>). Such evidence was echoed in the charges against him: &#145;he ment to have matched and sett one Noble man against such an other Noble man, as he thought he cowlde never compasse and wynne to assent to his factyon and false conspiracye&#146;  (<span class="italic">Statutes of the Realm</span>, 11 vols., 1810&#150;28, 3.63).<br>
<br>More significantly still, Seymour was fortifying Holt, at a strategic crossing point on the River Dee that commanded access from north to south Wales. He was also trying to secure more money. He was accused of maintaining pirates and taking a share of their spoil. Seymour asked Sharington, who had been coining testoons for himself and was possibly hoping to be protected from the consequences by high-placed friends, whether he could coin money for him. A later French account hinted that what Seymour planned to do was to kidnap the young king and marry Elizabeth, bringing them to Holt. Significantly, when in custody Seymour denied &#145;that ever I went about to take the kyng from my lord my brother by force; I never ment it, nor thought it&#146;  (Hatfield House, Hertfordshire, Cecil MS 150, fol. 99<i>v</i>). Yet Fowler testified how Seymour had once come to St James's Palace at nine o'clock in the morning and voiced his surprise that there were so few people there: &#145;a man might stele away the king now for there cam more with me than is in all the howse besides&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 10/6/10). If Seymour was indeed plotting to kidnap Edward and Elizabeth, to marry the princess, and to have himself made lord protector in place of his brother, it is not surprising that he was arrested and tried once his plans were discovered.<h2>
<a name="Fall1549"></a>Fall, 1549</h2>Seymour was arrested on 17 January 1549. Examined on 25 January, he wrote an abject submission to Somerset on 27 January. Many were interrogated. Some members of the privy council were clearly turning this information into articles against Seymour. He was examined on 18 February; the privy council discussed the matter on 22 February; Seymour was examined again on 23 February, but refused to answer unless his accusers stood before him, and would not even subscribe the answers he had earlier begun to make. On 24 February the privy councillors reported to Edward, Somerset &#145;declaring how sorowfull a case this was unto hym&#146;, but regarding his duty to the king greater than that to his brother. They sent once again to Seymour, who would answer no more than three of the articles. On 25 February a bill of attainder was introduced into parliament, unopposed in the House of Lords (Somerset was allowed for natural pity's sake to be absent), but &#145;very much debated and argued&#146; in the Commons, in which lawyers declared that Seymour's offences &#145;were in the compasse of High Treason&#146;. On 5 March the bill was passed, the Commons &#145;being marvailous full almost to the number of iiii<sup>c</sup> persons, not x or xii at the most giving their nays tharunto&#146;  (<span class="italic">APC</span>, <i>1547&#150;50</i>, 246&#150;7, 256&#150;8, 260). Seymour was beheaded on Tower Hill on 20 March and buried in the Tower, presumably in the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula. It was not any fratricidal bitterness or any factional stirring but quite simply what was found out about his activities and ambitions during the investigations in January and February 1549 that sealed his fate. He had done and said quite enough to have provoked not only his brother but also all his fellow privy councillors. To the end Seymour continued his plotting, for which he was denounced in a sermon by Hugh Latimer. He had allegedly sent papers to Princess Mary and Elizabeth, urging them to conspire against Somerset. These papers had been found in his shoe, sewn between the soles. He had &#145;made his pen of the aglet of a poynte that he plucked from his hosse&#146;. Latimer declaimed how Seymour &#145;died very dangerously, irksomely, horribly &hellip; He was a man the farthest from the fear of God that I knew or heard of in England&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sermons of Hugh Latimer, Sometime Bishop of Worcester, Martyr, 1555</span>, ed. G. E. Corrie, Parker Society, 22, 1844, 161&#150;5).<br>
<br>Seymour tried to do too much too quickly, and there was as much rhetoric as action. He won insufficient support among his fellow privy councillors: even if Dorset, William Parr, marquess of Northampton, Henry Manners, second earl of Rutland, and Southampton were keener than they allowed themselves to appear in their depositions, Seymour never gained any wholehearted commitment. He hardly had any coherent political programme, even if he agreed with his wife's criticism of the distribution of crown lands, or attacked Somerset's Scottish invasion of 1547 for risking the loss of a great number of men and for costing &#145;a great summ of Money in vayn&#146;, or suggested that Somerset would give up Calais to the French, or declared generally that &#145;he mislyked the procedinges of the lord Protector and counsayle&#146; and sought &#145;the alteracion of the state and ordre of the Realme&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 1729, fol. 9<i>r</i>; Hatfield House, Hertfordshire, Cecil MS 150, fol. 60<i>v</i>). Yet, if he had delayed his plots until autumn 1549, he might have gathered more support after the continuing military difficulties and the serious popular rebellions of the summer. Seymour's precipitate approach and consequent failure was as much a matter of temperament. William Wightman, his servant, testified how &#145;if he had oones conceyved opynion by his owne perswasions, neyther Lawyer nor other could tourne him&#146;  (Hatfield House, Hertfordshire, Cecil MS 150, fol. 60<i>v</i>). His fiery nature and his soaring ambition told against him, however attractive and charming his personality was. &#145;This day&#146;, said Elizabeth on hearing of his execution, &#145;died a man with much wit, and very litle judgment&#146;  (E. Dent, <span class="italic">Annals of Winchecombe and Sudeley</span>, 1877, 193).<br>
