<span class="headword">Ouless,  Walter William</span>  (1848&#150;1933), <span class="occ">portrait painter</span>, was born at St Helier, Jersey, on 21 September 1848, the third son of Philip John Ouless (1817&#150;1885), marine painter, and his wife, Caroline Marguette Savage. He was educated at Victoria College, Jersey, and moved to London in 1864, entering the Royal Academy Schools the following year, at sixteen. In 1869, when he was not yet twenty-one, he made his first appearance at a Royal Academy exhibition, with two subject pictures, <span class="italic">Home Again</span> and <span class="italic">A Tender Passage</span>. He continued to exhibit regularly until 1928, when he was represented by a portrait of Sir Arthur Keith, which is now in the Royal College of Surgeons together with his portrait of Lord Lister, painted in 1897. He was elected ARA in 1877, before he was thirty, and RA in 1881, and in 1924 he became a senior academician.<br>
<br>At the beginning of his career Ouless painted subject pictures, and it was on the advice of Sir J. E. Millais that he concentrated on portraiture. Ouless was quickly recognized as one of the most trustworthy portrait painters of the day, sure of getting a good and sympathetic likeness with a high degree of technical skill. At the same time his earlier practice in figure composition enabled him to give to his portraits a broadly pictorial effect combined with veracity in detail. In his academy notes of 1875 Ruskin observed: &#145;Mr Ouless has adopted from Mr Millais what was deserving of imitation, and has used the skill he has learned to better ends. All his portraits here are vigorous and interesting&#146;  (Ruskin, 30&#150;31). He proceeded to build an immensely successful career as a society portraitist, though he has been described as a &#145;competent&#146; artist rather than an &#145;inspired&#146; one  (Wood).<br>
<br>One of Ouless's earliest portraits was of Charles Darwin, painted for the family in 1875. Other commissions soon followed, notably of Cardinal Newman (1880&#150;81), for the Oratory in Birmingham, and Sir Frederick Roberts (1882), for the mess at Woolwich. He painted both Edward VIII (1900) and George V (1905) as prince of Wales, the latter for Lincoln's Inn. Among the other distinguished people who sat for him was Cardinal Manning (1888), a painting destroyed by enemy action in 1940, but represented by a replica at the Oratory, Birmingham. The portraits by Ouless in the National Portrait Gallery include <span class="italic">John Bright</span> (1879), <span class="italic">John Morley</span> (1891), and <span class="italic">Thomas Hardy</span> (1922). Ouless painted a self-portrait for the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, which was exhibited at the academy in 1918. In his later years he painted a few landscapes, mostly in the county of Dorset.<br>
<br>Ouless was for a long time active on the council of the Royal Academy. He was a governor of Dulwich College, and occupied himself a good deal with the affairs of the Dulwich Picture Gallery, which he helped to rehang. For many years he devoted much time to the Artists' General Benevolent Institution, both as honorary secretary and vice-president. Personally he was much liked, although during his later years partial deafness kept him from mixing much in general society. &#145;No man could have had a more loyal and steadfast friend, nor wiser counsellor, while he also possessed the charming courtesy of a great gentleman&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 1 Jan 1934).<br>
<br>Ouless was a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and a member of the order of Leopold, and during his long life he received gold and silver medals for his work at Berlin, Paris, Munich, and Vienna. On 6 November 1878 he married Lucy Maitland (1847/8&#150;1931), daughter of Thomas King Chambers MD, honorary physician to the prince of Wales, of Shrubs Hill House, Sunningdale. The eldest of their three daughters was Catherine Ouless (<i>b</i>. 1879), the landscape and portrait painter. He died after a short illness at his home, 12 Bryanston Square, London, on 25 December 1933.<br>
