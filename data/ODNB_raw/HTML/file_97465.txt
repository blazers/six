<span class="headword">Peacocke,  Arthur Robert</span>  (1924&#150;2006), <span class="occ">biochemist and theologian</span>, was born on 29 November 1924 at 221 Chester Road, Watford, Hertfordshire, the son of Arthur Charles Peacocke, butcher, and his wife, Rose Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lilly. He was educated at Watford grammar school and Exeter College, Oxford, where he gained a first-class degree in chemistry in 1946 before undertaking research for the degree of DPhil (awarded in 1948) under the supervision of Sir Cyril Hinshelwood. He then lectured in biophysical chemistry at Birmingham University from 1948 to 1959. His early scientific interests focused on the physical chemistry of DNA, but later in his long scientific career he concentrated on the study of the general thermodynamics of biological systems. On 7 August 1948 he married Rosemary Winifred Mann, a 22-year-old schoolteacher, later an inspector of schools, and daughter of Edgar Mann, jeweller. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Peacocke had been attracted to Christianity in his youth, but as an undergraduate he became an agnostic. However, a sermon preached in Oxford by William Temple persuaded him that religious belief could be approached with intellectual openness and scrupulosity. He also began to feel that the order and fruitfulness of the world, revealed by science, intimated the possibility of there being a divine mind and will behind the history of the universe. Influenced by the liberal theologian Geoffrey Lampe, a colleague at Birmingham University, he returned to religious belief and took first a diploma in theology (1960) then a degree in theology (1971), both from Birmingham. Later he was to have the unusual distinction of being both a DSc (1962) and a DD (1982) of Oxford University.<br>
<br>In 1959 Peacocke returned to Oxford as university lecturer in biochemistry and a fellow of St Peter's College, combining this from 1964 with a lectureship in chemistry at Mansfield College. In 1971 he was ordained to the Anglican priesthood and began to make a name for himself as a careful and insightful writer on science and religion. His first book on this subject, <span class="italic">Science and the Christian Experiment</span>, was published in 1971. In 1973 he made a decision, which he subsequently described as not having been easy, to move to Cambridge to become the dean of Clare College. At Cambridge he gave lectures both in chemistry and in theology. The invitation to give the Bampton lectures at Oxford in 1978 led to a major work, <span class="italic">Creation and the World of Science</span> (1979), which was widely influential on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1984 he returned again to Oxford to be the first director of the Ian Ramsey Centre, established in St Cross College for the interdisciplinary study of the relationship between theology and contemporary culture. He relinquished the directorship in 1988, but returned in 1996 for a second spell until 1999, in order to help in the establishment of an international programme of workshops in science and religion. In between he served as catechist at his old college, Exeter (1989&#150;93), an appointment he greatly enjoyed. He was made an honorary chaplain at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1988, and an honorary canon in 1995.<br>
<br>The invitation to give the Gifford lectures at St Andrews University in 1993 afforded Peacocke the opportunity to survey his mature position on the relationship between science and religion. The lectures formed the basis of his most important book, <span class="italic">Theology for a Scientific Age</span> (1993). It was followed by <span class="italic">From DNA to Dean</span> (1996), which contains a particularly interesting autobiographical chapter outlining the spiritual pilgrimage of his life. He continued to write on these matters right up to the time of his death, displaying, if anything, an increased anxiety that theology should have the boldness to take scientific insight seriously and be prepared in response to modify its own discourse in the ways that he believed had proved to be necessary. As a biologist he was able to give a positive theological interpretation of evolution, emphasizing that God is no cosmic despot keeping tight control of creation, but one, who in Charles Kingsley's phrase, allows creatures to be themselves and to &#145;make themselves&#146;. The history of the world is to be understood theologically as an unfolding exploration and unending improvisation of great and continuing fruitfulness, in which creator and creatures both participate. Peacocke delighted to illustrate these insights with metaphors drawn from music, which meant much to him in his personal life.<br>
<br>Although Peacocke quite often spoke in a revisionary mode about the need for modifications in theological discourse, he also had respect for the insights of the past, taking with great seriousness the importance of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> witness and expressing his admiration for the truth-seeking stance taken by such thinkers as Origen, Augustine, and Anselm. He was robustly critical of scientistic reductionism, remarking that &#145;atoms and molecules are not more real than cells, or populations of cells, or human communities, or human persons&#146;  (&#145;From DNA to Dean&#146;, <span class="italic">Zygon</span>, 26/4, Dec 1991, 491). Like many scientist&#150;theologians, he took a critical realist view of the nature of human knowledge, both in relation to science and to theology, a position that he defended in <span class="italic">Intimations of Reality</span> (1984).<br>
<br>In addition to his many personal contributions to the dialogue between science and religion Peacocke played an important part in founding a number of organizations that went on to play significant roles in facilitating that dialogue. In the early 1970s he was a leader in the discussions that led to the formation of the Science and Religion Forum in the United Kingdom, and he served as the forum's first chairman (1972&#150;8). Later he participated in moves to found the European Society for the Study of Science and Theology. His most imaginative and fruitful achievement of this kind was the conception and foundation of the Society of Ordained Scientists, a kind of &#145;dispersed religious community&#146;, prayerfully linking together clergy with serious scientific concerns. He was the society's first warden (1987&#150;92). A friendly and modest person, he was a courteous participant in many debates. Throughout his life he manifested a sincere desire to seek for truth without reserve. He received much international recognition for his achievements in the field of science and religion, including honorary degrees from DePauw University, Indiana, and Georgetown University, Washington. He was appointed MBE in 1993 and in 2001 was awarded the Templeton prize for progress in religion. He died of cancer of the prostate at the Westminster Beaumont Nursing Home, Bayworth Lane, Boar's Hill, Oxford, on 21 October 2006, and was survived by his wife, son, a professor of philosophy, and daughter, an Anglican priest.<br>
