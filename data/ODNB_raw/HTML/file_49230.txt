<span class="headword">Laurie,  John Paton</span>  (1897&#150;1980), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 25 March 1897 at 3 Ryedale Terrace, Maxwelltown, Kirkcudbrightshire, the fifth of the six children of William Laurie (1856&#150;1903), a Dumfries tweed mill superintendent and kirk elder, and his wife, Jessie Brown (1858&#150;1935). Although born into a family rooted in covenanting traditions, Laurie soon became a &#145;lapsed Presbyterian&#146;. A more significant childhood influence was Robert Burns's association with Dumfries. Laurie once introduced a Burns broadcast with &#145;His songs and poems were in the air I breathed&#146;  (Laurie MSS).<br>
<br>Leaving Dumfries Academy in 1914, Laurie joined an architect's firm. From 1916 he served with the Honourable Artillery Company at the Somme and Paschendale. Invalided out, he returned to architecture in 1918. However, in 1920, the urge to act took him to a summer school of speech and drama at Stratford. Convinced by the revelation of Bridges-Adam's productions, he abandoned architecture and went to London to study at the Central School of Speech and Drama, where the renowned voice teacher Elsie Fogerty transformed his life.<br>
<br>John Laurie first appeared on stage in Dumfries in 1921 in J. M. Barrie's <span class="italic">What every Woman Knows</span>. Later that year he joined the London Old Vic to play Pistol in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>. He performed regularly with the company until 1925, building an impressive list of credits in Shakespearian and classical roles under the director Robert Atkins. After a spell with the Stratford Festival Society Company in 1926, playing Autolycus in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> and Conrad in <span class="italic">Love's Labours Lost</span>, followed by a period in the West End, he returned to Stratford to play Hamlet in 1927. From 1927 to 1929 leading roles at the Old Vic included both Macbeth and Hamlet. The Old Vic director Harcourt Williams wrote of his incisive diction, his Scottish vigour, and his warm personality  (Williams, 77).<br>
<br>In 1939 Laurie launched his screen career in Alfred Hitchcock's <span class="italic">Juno and the Paycock</span>. He made over a hundred films, including <span class="italic">The 39 Steps</span> (1935), <span class="italic">The Four Feathers</span> (1939), and <span class="italic">Kidnapped</span> (1960). With his dark wavy hair and piercing eyes, he became familiar as the dour miser or the eccentric pessimist&#151;usually Scottish. Until 1939 he alternated between the Old Vic, Stratford, and the West End, playing in Ibsen and in Shakespeare in roles ranging from Feste to Othello and from Malvolio to Richard III. Laurie's work then diversified and he appeared, for example, in Shaw's <span class="italic">Heartbreak House</span> (West End, 1943), <span class="italic">John Knox</span> (Glasgow Citizens' Theatre, 1947), and <span class="italic">Tiger at the Gates</span> (New York, 1955). He toured Australia with J. C. Williamson's Shakespeare Company in 1959, the USSR, America, and Europe with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1964, and he joined the Chichester Festival Company in 1966.<br>
<br>Work increasingly focused on television, mainly in drama series such as <span class="italic">Armchair Theatre</span> and <span class="italic">Play of the Month</span>. In 1968 the BBC broadcast the first episode of the legendary comedy series <span class="italic">Dad's Army</span>. Ironically, Laurie's characterization of Private Fraser, with the catch-phrase &#145;We're all doomed&#146;, bestowed on him unprecedented popular recognition. Such fame tended to obscure his fine reputation as a classical actor of which he was rightly proud. Nevertheless he was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in early 1980. A man of no regrets, he gladly accepted all work offered.<br>
<br>As a founder member of the Apollo Society&#151;dedicated to the performance of music and poetry&#151;he was able to combine his principal relaxation, reading, with his profession. He was a celebrated exponent of Burns and McGonagall. EMI recorded a Burns concert, entitled <span class="italic">The Kindling Fire</span> in 1974. Laurie, with a keen sense of humour and a generous nature, was known for his outspokenness. He was invited to compile an anthology of Scottish literature in 1974 and his introduction to <span class="italic">My Favourite Scottish Stories</span>&#151;&#145;Actors as men of letters are rare birds&#146;&#151;surely revealed how he saw himself.<br>
<br>Laurie's first wife, the Old Vic actress Florence Mary Saunders (<i>b</i>. 1891), died in 1926. He married Oonah Veronica Todd-Naylor (1901&#150;1990), a teacher, in 1928. Their only child, Veronica, was born in 1939. Ties with Scotland notwithstanding, he made his home in England. He died from emphysema and respiratory failure on 23 June 1980 in Chalfont Hospital, Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, and was cremated in July at Amersham cemetery.<br>
