<span class="headword">Reid, Sir  John Watt</span>  (1823&#150;1909), <span class="occ">surgeon and naval officer</span>, born in Edinburgh on 25 February 1823, was the younger son of John Watt Reid, surgeon in the navy, and his wife, Jane, daughter of James Henderson, an Edinburgh merchant. Educated at Edinburgh Academy, at the university there, and at the extra-mural medical school, he qualified LRCS (Edinburgh) in 1844. He entered the navy as an assistant surgeon on 6 February 1845, and spent two years in the Haslar Royal Naval Hospital, Hampshire, before serving a commission on board the <i>Rodney</i> in the channel, where he was commended by his commanders-in-chief. He was appointed in March 1849 to the naval hospital at Plymouth, and received Admiralty approval for his services there during the 1849 cholera epidemic. In January 1852 he was appointed acting surgeon to the sloop <i>Inflexible</i>, in the Mediterranean; on 12 September 1854 he was promoted to surgeon, and in June 1855 appointed to the line-of-battle ship <i>London</i>, on the same station. In these two ships he served in the Black Sea until the fall of Sevastopol; he was thanked by the commander-in-chief, Sir James Dundas, for his services when the crew of the flagship <i>Britannia</i> was stricken with cholera in 1854. On 22 October 1856 he was awarded the MD at Aberdeen, and in April 1857 was appointed to the hospital ship <i>Belleisle</i>, in which he continued during the Second Opium War, in 1857&#150;9.<br>
<br>In January 1860 Reid was appointed to the <i>Nile</i> (90 guns), and served in her for four years on the North American station. On 6 July 1863 Reid married Georgina, daughter of C. J. Hill, of Halifax, Nova Scotia. He earned his captain's commendation for his zeal and professional ability, especially during an epidemic of yellow fever, while he was medical officer in charge of the temporary hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Milne considered him an officer in whom he could invariably place implicit confidence. He served in the Haslar Hospital from 1864 until 1867, being promoted to staff surgeon on 5 September 1866. After further service in the Mediterranean, in the <i>Duncan</i> and the <i>Lord Warden</i>, he was placed in June 1870 in charge of the naval hospital at Haulbowline, co. Cork, where he remained until 1873. During the concluding months of the Second Anglo-Asante War he served in the <i>Active</i> and in the <i>Nebraska</i>, a troopship converted to receive casualties from the naval brigades, at Cape Coast Castle; he was mentioned in dispatches, and on 31 March 1874 was promoted to deputy inspector-general. In that rank he had charge of the medical establishments at Bermuda from 1875 to 1878, when he was appointed to the Haslar Hospital. On 25 February 1880 he was promoted to be inspector-general and was appointed medical director-general of the navy. In this capacity he carried through important and lasting reforms proposed in 1883 by the Hoskins committee, of which he was a member. They included a naval medical school at the Haslar Hospital, the organization of the naval sick-berth branch, and the naval nursing service.<br>
<br>On Reid's retirement in 1888 the Board of Admiralty recorded its high opinion of his zeal and efficiency. He became an honorary physician to Queen Victoria in February 1881 and to Edward VII in 1901. He was created KCB (military) on 24 November 1882, and awarded the LLD of Edinburgh University on 17 April 1884, the jubilee medal in 1897, and a medical good-service pension in July 1888.<br>
<br>Reid died at his London home, 106 Queen's Gate, South Kensington, on 24 February 1909, and was buried on 26 February at Bramshaw, Hampshire.<br>
