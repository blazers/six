<span class="headword">Stewart,  Alexander</span>, earl of Mar  (<em>c.</em>1380&#150;1435), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26451/', "Alexander Stewart, first earl of Buchan (c.1345&#150;1405)")</script>; his mother was probably Buchan's long-standing mistress, Mairead inghean Eachainn (or Eachann). There is considerable uncertainty about the date of the younger Alexander's birth. He must have been at least fourteen by 1404, when he married the widowed Isabella Douglas, countess of Mar (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1408), but was probably older. Indeed, he may have participated in raids on lowland areas, instigated by his father and his brothers Duncan and James in the 1380s and 1390s. However, neither Alexander nor another brother, Andrew, were specifically implicated in these attacks, and although it is often assumed that Alexander was his father's eldest child, it remains possible that he was not born until as late as 1390, when Mairead was already established as Buchan's mistress. Be that as it may, the young Alexander was described by one contemporary as &#145;headstrong and wild and the leader of a band of caterans&#146;  (Bower, 8.293).<br>
<br>Alexander Stewart's marriage has been the cause of much controversy. Traditionally it has been assumed that in 1402, together with Robert, duke of Albany, Stewart instigated the murder of the countess's husband, Sir Malcolm Drummond, and that Stewart then forced Isabella to marry him. This seems unlikely. There is no evidence of collusion between Albany and Stewart at this stage, nor of enmity between Drummond and Stewart. Rather, Stewart's marriage coincided with a revival in his father's political fortunes from 1402 and appears to have been opposed by Albany, who was Buchan's rival. It was presumably at the instigation of Albany, then lieutenant of the kingdom, that the marriage settlement agreed by a charter of 12 August 1404 was denied royal ratification. The agreement stipulated that descent of the earldom would pass to heirs of Stewart and the countess, failing which (a likely event given the countess's advancing years) descent would pass to Stewart's heirs. This arrangement excluded the claims of the Erskine family, which were supported by Albany and his allies. A compromise between Stewart and Albany was reached in December 1404, whereby Stewart was granted a liferent on the earldom, but the subsequent inheritance was to pass to the countess's heirs. A public marriage ceremony between Isabella and Stewart took place outside Kildrummy Castle, the caput of the earldom, on 14 December. From then until his death Stewart was styled earl of Mar, a title indicative of his lordship in central Aberdeenshire and the Garioch.<br>
<br>In the aftermath of his marriage Mar began to play a more prominent role in national affairs. In 1405 he commanded a fleet attempting to blockade Newcastle and Berwick, a prelude to his appointment as admiral of Scotland, perhaps as early as 1407, but certainly by 1414. In 1406 he was chosen to treat with England over breaches of truce, and also for the release of the recently captured James I. Although Mar engaged in other diplomatic activities and foreign visits&#151;he tourneyed in London in 1406, visited Paris and the Low Countries in 1407&#150;8 (where he not only scored a spectacular social success, but also, according to Wyntoun, played a leading part in the campaign by which the dukes of Burgundy and Holland established the latter's brother in the see of Li&egrave;ge), and received another ambassadorial appointment to England in 1416&#151;his principal public activities were closer to home. On 24 July 1411, at the battle of Harlaw, he commanded the government forces that confronted the army which Donald of the Isles, who claimed the earldom of Ross and may also have had an eye to the plunder of Aberdeen, had led into Mar. The hard-fought battle brought Donald's submission only in the short term and prevented his pressing his claim to Ross for barely a decade, but it confirmed Mar's political leadership of the north. The death of David Lindsay, earl of Crawford, in 1407 and the lengthy absences abroad of John Stewart, earl of Buchan, meant that Mar was the only magnate capable of defending the region against highland incursions. His pre-eminence there was remarked upon by Walter Bower, who notes that Mar &#145;ruled with acceptance nearly all the north of the country beyond the Mounth&#146;  (Bower, 8.293). This was a role which he continued to perform, notably by supervising the construction of fortifications at Inverness from 1412, by organizing a maritime expedition against the Islesmen in 1415&#150;16, and by leading the government forces at the battle of Inverlochy in 1431, albeit these were surprised and defeated.<br>
<br>Mar's ability to lead the north stemmed from his careful cultivation of a broadly based affinity. In addition to his brothers and erstwhile Drummond adherents in Mar, the earl courted Angus families, such as the Ogilvys of Auchterhouse and the Scrymgeours, and provided them with lands in the north-east, even though the former, at least, had been bitter opponents of the earl's renegade brothers. Mar also attempted to install friendly clerics in the dioceses of Aberdeen, Moray, Ross, and Dunkeld. These included his secretary, John Inchmartin, whom he sponsored from at least 1409 until 1415 as archdeacon of Ross, and possibly Henry Lichton, who was elected bishop of Moray in 1414. It was Lichton who, while visiting the court of the Avignon pope Benedict XIII at Valencia in 1415, obtained an annulment of Stewart's second marriage.<br>
<br>With burgesses too, especially those from Aberdeen, Mar maintained close relations. Several, among them Provost Robert Davidson, died while serving with the earl's army at Harlaw. After the battle Mar sat briefly on the burgh council of Aberdeen, an extraordinary appointment for an early fifteenth-century magnate. Although his respectability grew at home, however, the earl's collaboration with Davidson in a campaign of piracy waged on Netherlandish, English, and Hanseatic shipping between <i>c</i>.1408 and 1412 won him international notoriety. In response the Hanse imposed an embargo on Scottish trade which was not lifted until 1436. The reasons behind the piracy, initially directed against Dutch shipping, may be connected with the earl's second marriage. Stewart probably met Marie van Hoorn (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1436), heir of Duffel in Brabant, while he was serving with the Burgundian army which defeated the Li&eacute;geois at Oth&eacute;e in 1408 and may have married her that year. She was allegedly still married to Thiery de Lienden, and Mar perhaps blamed his Netherlandish companions for the unfortunate liaison. Permission to annul the marriage was granted in 1415, and again after the end of the schism in 1424, but although Mar obtained a dispensation in 1432 to marry Margaret Seton, widow of James Dunbar, earl of Moray, Marie continued to be styled countess of Mar as late as 1434.<br>
<br>That Mar was not forced by the Scottish government to make amends for his piracy bears witness to his considerable political influence. After 1405 he had achieved a rapprochement with Albany, and in 1420 he made a bond of loyalty with Albany's son Murdoch Stewart, who became governor of the realm in the same year. Mar also survived the restoration of James I in 1424. In part this was due to his continued usefulness to the government in the north, but it may also be connected to his early collaboration with crown loyalists such as Henry Sinclair, earl of Orkney, in the military activity of 1405, and to the visits made by Sir Alexander Forbes, a prominent member of Mar's affinity, to James I during the king's captivity in England. Influence and service brought the substantial rewards which were necessary to bestow patronage on his followers. Between 1412 and 1422 Mar received &pound;4238 in the form of annuities from the customs accounts and in 1420 half the crown's judicial profits from the north, including those from his father's lordship of Badenoch. The size and frequency of such grants declined after 1424, but the grant of a liferent on Badenoch on 9 January 1427 indicates that by this time he had effectively brought that lordship under his own control.<br>
<br>Mar had no legitimate heirs. Of his illegitimate children, Thomas married Elizabeth Douglas, the widow of John Stewart, earl of Buchan, Janet married Lachlan Maclean of Duart, while Walter and David were earmarked for ecclesiastical careers. Mar's attempts to arrange for the succession of Thomas to his earldom were approved by the crown in 1427, but in 1430 Thomas predeceased his father. Following the earl's death on 26 July 1435 and burial in the Dominican friary at Inverness his estates reverted to the crown, though they continued to be the subject of dispute for over twenty years.<br>
