<span class="headword">Lombard,  Daniel</span>  (1678&#150;1746), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born at Angers, France, on 10 April 1678, the eldest son of the Revd John Lombard (<i>d</i>. 1721) and his wife, Francisca. Lombard's family travelled to London following the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685; his father, formerly a French protestant minister in Anjou, ministered in several French churches in London. Daniel Lombard was naturalized in England in January 1688. On 11 September of the following year he entered Merchant Taylors' School, London, and was then educated at St John's College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 7 July 1694; he was elected a scholar soon after. He graduated BA (17 May 1698); MA by diploma, being then abroad (16 March 1702); BD (26 April 1708); and DD (23 April 1714). Between 1697 and March 1718 Lombard was also a fellow at St John's College.<br>
<br>Lombard, ordained deacon by Henry Compton, bishop of London, on 26 May 1700, and priest on 9 January 1701, was appointed chaplain at Hanover to Princess Sophia and the embassy. His first published sermon, addressed to the recently deceased Sophia, appeared in 1714. After the accession of George I, Lombard was made chaplain to the princess of Wales, and on 24 February 1718 he was instituted to the rectory of Lanteglos by Camelford, on the northern side of Bodmin Moor, Cornwall. He retained this living for the rest of his life, but was absent for much of this period. His other published works include a comparison of the lines of Fran&ccedil;ois Eudes de M&eacute;zeray and his father, Daniel, printed in Amsterdam in 1723. The 1745 Jacobite rising prompted Lombard to write his own <span class="italic">Succinct History of Ancient and Modern Persecutions</span> (1747). He also contributed to his friend Francis Gregor's 1737 edition of Sir John Fortescue's <span class="italic">De laudibus legum Angliae</span>. Lombard was known to his parishioners for his learning, his simple lifestyle, and his attachment to French customs. He died at Camelford, Cornwall, on 30 December 1746 and was buried at Lanteglos on 2 January 1747.<br>
