<span class="headword">Atkinson,  Edward Leicester</span>  (1881&#150;1929), <span class="occ">naval medical officer and explorer in Antarctica</span>, was born on 23 November 1881 at Sion Hill, St Vincent, Windward Islands, West Indies, the third of eight children and the second and sole surviving son of Edward Leycester Atkinson, then an accountant at the Colonial Bank, Kingstown, St Vincent, and his wife, Jane Anne Hazell. His paternal grandfather was the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/849/', "Revd John Christopher Atkinson")</script> of Danby-in-Cleveland, Yorkshire. Entering Forest School, Walthamstow, Essex, in October 1895, in the following five years he received prizes for mathematics, chemistry, and form work. In 1900 he went to St Thomas's Hospital to study medicine, qualifying in 1906 as MRCS and LRCP, and he then went for a short time to Brompton Hospital and Convalescent Centre.<br>
<br>Atkinson entered the Royal Navy in 1908 and was recommended by the medical director-general to join as surgeon and helminthologist the 1910 expedition to Antarctica led by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35994/', "Captain Robert Falcon Scott")</script>. In 1912 the leadership of the expedition's remnant at Cape Evans devolved upon Atkinson, the sole remaining officer. He initiated and led the search party which found and buried the bodies of Scott, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36952/', "Edward A. Wilson")</script>, and H. R. Bowers, retrieving the diaries, drawings, and letters that revealed the epic story of their fate. This scene is depicted in bas-relief on the plinth of the Scott memorial, Plymouth. Atkinson also wrote the epitaph to Captain Oates: &#145;Hereabouts died a very gallant gentleman&hellip;&#146;.<br>
<br>On 12 August 1915 at Rochford, Essex, Atkinson married Jessie Hamilton Fowler (<i>d</i>. July 1928), daughter of Peter Ferguson, salesman. They had no children. During the First World War, Atkinson served with the Royal Naval division at Gallipoli in 1915, and the Royal Marine howitzer brigade in France, 1916&#150;18. Mentioned in dispatches and twice wounded, he was appointed to the DSO in 1918. In September 1918 his ship, HMS <i>Glatton</i>, blew up in Dover harbour. Although severely wounded, Atkinson rescued five seamen and was awarded the Albert medal. He was staff surgeon (1913) and surgeon-commander (1918). In 1919 he saw active service in north Russia. Awarded the Chadwick gold medal in 1920, he retired from the navy in 1928, the year he became surgeon-captain. The <span class="italic">Journal</span> of the Royal Naval Medical Service published nineteen articles written by Atkinson.<br>
<br>Physically short and slightly built, Atkinson possessed remarkable attributes. He had a clear scientific mind but was self-effacing, modest, and a man of few words. As a serviceman he was reliable, displaying grit, fearlessness, and devotion to duty, as well as being cheerful and optimistic. During the 1910 Antarctic expedition Scott mentioned Atkinson, Bowers, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35275/', "L. E. G. Oates")</script> as those on whom he particularly relied, describing them as &#145;treasures&#146;.<br>
<br>Atkinson married second, in Glasgow on 15 November 1928, Mary Flint (<i>d</i>. 1954), daughter of John Hunter, of Glasgow. When he retired from the navy Atkinson joined SS <i>City of Sparta</i> as ship's surgeon and sailed to India. During the return voyage he died in the Mediterranean on 20 February 1929 and was buried at sea.<br>
