<span class="headword">Stedman,  Rowland</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1673), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Corfton, in the parish of Diddlebury in Shropshire, the son of Henry and Mary Stedman, who were both still living at the time he signed his will in 1667. He matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, as a plebeian, on 12 March 1649 but migrated to University College on obtaining a scholarship there in the same year. He graduated BA on 16 October 1651 and proceeded MA on 22 March 1656; by the latter date, however, he had already begun his ministerial career. On 18 November 1653 he was presented under the great seal as rector of Pontesbury, Shropshire, but by July of the following year he was at the rectory of Hanwell, Middlesex. In 1659 he was curate of Wokingham, Berkshire, remaining there until his ejection. In his will Stedman would leave books to Mrs Elizabeth Hawes, of Wokingham, in grateful acknowledgement of &#145;her love and care of my welfare during my residence there&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/343, fol. 106<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Probably after his ejection in 1662 Stedman married Margaret, daughter of William and Anne Jemmatt; there were no surviving children of the marriage in 1667, when he drew up his will at Neasden in the parish of Willesden, Middlesex. The following year he published <span class="italic">The Mystical Union of Believers with Christ</span> with an epistle dedicated to Dame Eleanor Roberts of Neasden, and a second preface to &#145;my dearly beloved friends, the inhabitants of the town and parish of Wockingham&#146; from whom he had been separated: &#145;You are, many of you, a people under convictions&#146; in whom &#145;the clear light of the gospel&#146; shone, even though they are &#145;most of you, a people of low estate, and poor in the world&#146;. He asks them not to despair &#145;in the worst times. And think not the worse of religion because it is despised and set against. It is condemned indeed of pride and humour; of faction, sedition and turbulency&#146;. But its opponents are &#145;men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth&#146;; and &#145;will a traveller be turned out of his road, because of some dogs and curs, that bark at him?&#146;  (Stedman, preface). Probably a little later, Stedman was able to move closer to his old congregation while serving as a chaplain to Philip, Lord Wharton (1613&#150;1696), at Wooburn, Buckinghamshire. On 22 July 1672, following receipt of a letter on his behalf from Richard Steele, he was granted a licence as a presbyterian teacher at the house of Samuel Clark (<i>d</i>. 1701) at Winchendon in the same county. Stedman died at Wooburn on 14 September 1673, and was buried on 16 September at Wooburn church; his wife survived him. His will, dated 24 October 1667, was proved on 8 October 1673. In it he let it be known &#145;that in my not conforming to the Ceremonies and other Impositions I have not been led by Humour, faction or any carnal interest whatsoever but as really judging such conformity sinful&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/343, fol. 106).<br>
