<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hassan, Sir  Joshua Abraham</span>  (1915&#150;1997), <span class="occ">chief minister of Gibraltar</span>, was born in Gibraltar on 21 August 1915, the son of Abraham M. Hassan, a cloth merchant, from a distinguished merchant family of Moroccan Sephardi extraction that had first settled in Gibraltar in 1728. He was educated by the Christian brothers of Line Wall College, then studied law in London, and was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1939. For most of his life he managed to combine both law and politics.<br>
<br>Hassan's particular eminence derived from the exceptional circumstances in which Gibraltar found itself during and immediately after the Second World War. After the fall of France in 1940, the early successes of the axis powers in north Africa had an immense impact on the vulnerable but vital crown colony. While the colonial authorities were obliged to stay put, the safety and well-being of the women, children, and elderly could not be guaranteed in the desperate military situation, and they were evacuated. Hassan gained respect for his work on the Gibraltar evacuation committee and by his equally energetic efforts in 1944 to have the evacuees returned, despite severe transport restrictions. His active participation in Gibraltar's defence as a Bofors gunner enhanced his political credentials. Meanwhile, in 1941 he became deputy coroner, and in 1945 he was elected to the city council of Gibraltar. He served as mayor from 1945 to 1950 and from 1953 to 1969 (when the city council was merged with the legislative council to form the house of assembly). He married, in 1945, Daniela Salazar, of La L&iacute;nea de la Concepci&oacute;n, Spain. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>The wartime privations on the Rock demonstrated to authorities and inhabitants alike the limitations of the chaotic multiple administrative systems that had developed in <i>ad hoc</i> fashion. By 1949 the administration of Gibraltar, with its total area of 1360 acres and population of 27,000 civilians and military, was divided among no fewer than five semi-autonomous authorities: the three military services plus the colonial and municipal institutions. Such complexity was &#145;neither intelligible, reasonable, or sensible&#146;, noted a Colonial Office report in 1949, but &#145;foolish, absurd, and extravagant&#146;  (TNA: PRO, CO 91/537&#150;9). As a result a new legislative council was set up in 1950. The elections to the new council held that autumn brought in two conservative independents and three candidates (including Hassan) sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights (AACR). The AACR had been founded by Hassan during the war and was closely linked to the Gibraltar Confederation of Labour, which he had long championed. Two positions on the executive council could be nominated by the governor. The favourite from the shortlist proved unavailable, since the American consulate for which he worked would not release him, and a second, on account of a communist affiliation, was regarded as unsuitable. The Colonial Office wanted at least one position to go to an AACR member. Hassan, though a one-time radical activist, had all the right qualifications. He was a Gibraltarian, he was a lawyer, he was fiercely loyal to Britain, and he had strong links to Gibraltar's workers, whose votes would prove vital in upholding the colony's links with Britain.<br>
<br>Hassan's appointment to the executive council and as chief member of the legislative council marked the beginning of a career dedicated to making clear Gibraltar's rejection of Spanish claims while at the same time minimizing Whitehall's control as much as possible. In this, the international situation was to Hassan's advantage. Of all Britain's colonial possessions during this period of intense decolonization, the escalation of the cold war ensured that Gibraltar remained the most significant strategically and politically. Consequently the Gibraltar question was handled with exceptional tact and co-operation by the Colonial Office and Gibraltarians alike.<br>
<br>Hassan was knighted in 1963 (he had been made LVO in 1954 and CBE in 1957). In 1964, under a new constitution, he became the first chief minister of Gibraltar. He headed petitions in 1963, 1964, and 1966 before the United Nations Committee of Twenty-four, created in November 1961 to examine questions of independence. His aim, contrary to Spanish demands, was for Gibraltar not to relinquish ties with Britain but to have an administration similar to that of the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. This had been suggested in a Colonial Office report of 1949, possibly at the instigation of Hassan himself. The United Nations was unimpressed by the arguments he and his colleague Peter Isola put forward. Nevertheless, a referendum of 10 September 1967 infuriated Spain but vindicated his approach, with a vote of 12,138 (95.8 per cent) in favour of remaining, as he put it, &#145;With Britain, but not under Britain&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 2 July 1997). In 1969 Hassan achieved his aim of a new constitution, which removed the anomaly of separate city and legislative councils, and in which Britain guaranteed that Gibraltar would never be ceded to another state against the wishes of its citizens. For Gibraltarians this proved something of a pyrrhic victory, however, with the closing in June 1969 of Spain's border with Gibraltar. Hassan's private life caused controversy the same year, when he introduced a private member's bill allowing him to divorce his wife, Daniela. Divorce was then otherwise impossible in predominantly Roman Catholic Gibraltar. Following the divorce Hassan married, the same year, Marcelle Bensimon. They, too, had two daughters.<br>
<br>In the election of 1969 Hassan's AACR was narrowly defeated by Robert Peliza's Integration with Britain party. He nevertheless returned as chief minister in 1972, an office he retained through subsequent elections until 1987. Although Spain's claims to Gibraltar and its closure of the border continued after General Franco's death in 1975, the situation could be approached with less tension. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher found the new Spanish premier someone with whom she could converse, if not agree. Thatcher used the threat of a veto on Spanish entry into the EU and NATO to force the reopening of the border; the price, through the Brussels agreement of 1984, was discussion of sovereignty. Hassan's albeit reluctant endorsement of the agreement undermined his position with the people of Gibraltar. The closure of Gibraltar's airport for flights to anywhere but Britain, following the breakdown of a 1983 agreement with Spain, further weakened Hassan's support. He resigned as chief minister on 9 December 1987 and retired from politics at the election the following year. He was appointed KCMG in 1986 and GBE in 1988.<br>
<br>Throughout his years as chief member and chief minister, Hassan continued to work as a practising lawyer, the position of chief member/minister being only part-time. He represented Robert Maxwell, whose holding company was registered in Gibraltar, and following his retirement as chief minister he represented one of the witnesses at the inquest into the shooting by the SAS of three suspected IRA terrorists in Gibraltar in 1987. He was chairman of the Gibraltar bar council from 1992 to 1995.<br>
<br>Hassan was &#145;an open and accessible man, greeting people on the street of his colony, and claiming to know the names of most of them&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 2 July 1997). He enjoyed wide popularity, being fondly known as Salvador&#151;though also, less fondly, as El Pulpo, the octopus, whose tentacles reached into every aspect of Rock life. He died in Gibraltar on 1 July 1997, survived by his wife, Marcelle, their two daughters, and the two daughters of his first marriage.<br>
