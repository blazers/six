<span class="headword">Lickbarrow,  Isabella</span>  (1784&#150;1847), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 5 November 1784 at Market Place, Kendal, Westmorland, the first of four daughters born to James Lickbarrow (1751&#150;1805), schoolmaster, son of Henry and Isabel Lickbarrow of Cautley, in the parish of Sedbergh, and his wife, Mary (1756&#150;1790), daughter of Samuel and Mary Bristo, of Howburn, in the parish of Caldbeck in Cumberland. Her sisters were Rachel (<i>b</i>. 1786), Hannah (<i>b</i>. 1787), and Margaret (<i>b</i>. 1789). The families were all members of the Society of Friends.<br>
<br>Lickbarrow was given an excellent Quaker education, probably at the Friends' school in Kendal where her relative (first cousin once removed) John Dalton, the eminent scientist, taught before going to Manchester. Her mother died when she was five years old, and her father when she was twenty. She states that her first volume of poetry entitled <span class="italic">Poetical Effusions</span> (1814) was published in order to create a fund &#145;to assist the humble labours of herself and her orphan sisters which would increase their family comforts and better their condition in life&#146;. The list of subscribers to <span class="italic">Poetical Effusions</span> included Wordsworth, Southey, and De Quincey. John Dalton bought four copies.<br>
<br>From 1811 to 1815 Lickbarrow wrote prolifically for the <span class="italic">Westmorland Advertiser</span>, a weekly broadsheet published in Kendal first by Isaac Steele, then by M. and R. Branthwaite. The Branthwaites were responsible for arranging the publication of <span class="italic">Poetical Effusions</span>. In 1818 Lickbarrow appeared as the author of another volume of poetry called <span class="italic">Lament upon the Death of Princess Charlotte, and Alfred, a Vision</span>. She continued to write for the <span class="italic">Monthly Repository</span> (1818), the <span class="italic">Lonsdale Magazine</span> (1820), the <span class="italic">Westmorland Advertiser and Kendal Chronicle</span> (1820&#150;23), and the <span class="italic">Kendal Mercury and Westmorland Advertiser</span> (1837&#150;40). Her work shows not only a great appreciation of the beauties of nature in the local countryside, but also contains humanitarian reflections on the Napoleonic war, the slave trade, and contemporary domestic life. The discovery of a letter in her own hand to William Lowther, first earl of Lonsdale, dated 27 November 1818, shows Lickbarrow's integrity and independent spirit. The letter returned a gift of &pound;10 10<i>s</i>., and made clear that to accept such a sum &#145;would be acting ingenuously towards your Lordship and fear that I either incur the imputation of ingratitude or inconsistency.&#146; Her motive may have been political: 1818 was the year when Lord Lonsdale's two sons were the tory candidates returned to parliament having defeated the whig Lord Brougham.<br>
<br>For a time Lickbarrow kept a school in Kendal with her sisters Margaret and Rachel until 1820 when her sisters were admitted to Lancaster Lunatic Asylum, suffering from what was described as hereditary melancholia. Both were discharged as cured in 1822, but Rachel was admitted on a further three occasions over the period 1829&#150;35, having twice attempted suicide. <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> (17 February 1866) suggested that Lickbarrow herself had been admitted to the same asylum, but it has not proved possible to confirm this. Later in their lives their poverty was alleviated; when he died in 1844 John Dalton left in his will one-eighth of his entire estate in trust to the three sisters, &#145;&pound;900 divided in third equal parts to my relations Isabella, Rachel and Margaret Lickbarrow&#146;. It is possible that he helped them financially throughout his life, since there is evidence that the Kendal Society of Friends was supportive.<br>
<br>Lickbarrow lived with her sisters in Greenhow Yard, Highgate, in Kendal; J. F. Curwen's <span class="italic">Kirkbie-Kendal</span> (1900) lists her address as 95/99 Soutergate, the east side&#151;which was later known as Highgate. Curwen wrote that Greenhow Yard &#145;has always been considered one of the nicest in Kendal, the houses not being too rank, and by reason of the tall poplars that used to flourish there&#146;  (pp. 105&#150;6). After Isabella's death in 1847, the 1851 census recorded Rachel and Margaret Lickbarrow still living in Highgate, described as annuitants, and in the <span class="italic">Kendal Directory</span> (1849) they are found in the list comprising the addresses of &#145;Clergy, Gentry, Partners in Firms not arranged under the classifications of Trades and Professions&#146;, and so were not regarded as being &#145;working-class&#146; as has been suggested.<br>
<br>Isabella Lickbarrow died on 10 February 1847 at Underbarrow, Kendal. Her death certificate states that she died of atrophy, which was the contemporary description of an emaciating illness such as tuberculosis. She was buried in Castle Street burial-ground, Kendal, on 15 February 1847.<br>
