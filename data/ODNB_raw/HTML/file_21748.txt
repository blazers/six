<span class="headword">Peckwell,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1746, <em>d.</em> 1787), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Methodist preacher</span>, was the son of Henry Peckwell (<i>d</i>. 1747) of Crane Street, Chichester, Sussex, of a Petworth family, variously described as a gentleman, victualler, innholder, and merchant, and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Palmer (<i>d</i>. 1769), probably his second wife, and was baptized on 29 November 1746 at St Olave's Church, Chichester. About 1765 he entered the house of Samuel Lloyd, an Italian silk merchant in London, with the intention of representing the firm in Italy, but he became a regular attender at George Whitefield's Tabernacle and abandoned plans for a career in trade in favour of the ministry. He matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 17 May 1770, undeterred, like other evangelically minded young men, from going to the hall despite the expulsion of six students in February 1768 for their Methodist sympathies.<br>
<br>After ordination into the Church of England at Oxford in June 1772 Peckwell accepted the curacy of Winterbourne Gunner, Wiltshire, from the Revd Charles Coleman, but it was abruptly terminated after he had preached an evangelical sermon unacceptable to his patron. A curacy at St Martin's, Salisbury, lasted only slightly longer. Meanwhile Peckwell had attracted the notice of Selina, countess of Huntingdon, and soon gained a following as a popular itinerant preacher in south-eastern England within her connexion. Her influence on him was, for a while, paramount. On 23 February 1773 he married Isabella (Bella) Blosset (<i>d</i>. 1816) of co. Meath, from a minor gentry family of French Huguenot extraction, against her mother's initial opposition, because she had been recommended to him as a wife by Lady Huntingdon as &#145;an instrument to help you in your plan&#146;  (letter, 10 or 11 Feb 1772, Cheshunt collection, F1/1352). In April 1774 Peckwell assumed the leadership of the chapel in the New Way, Westminster, perhaps assuming much of the cost of repairing and opening the building himself. In the same year he also began a regular preaching schedule in the Mulberry Gardens, London, and was present at the opening of another chapel in his home town of Chichester. In August he preached the anniversary sermon at Lady Huntingdon's college at Trefeca, and he spoke in chapels as well as outdoors in Brighton, Maidstone, and Tunbridge Wells. His letters are full of fervent desires to serve: &#145;O that I could give up all for the Lord. I am a poor Disciple and all I can say is <i>I wish to follow Jesus</i>&#146;  (Seymour, 2.292).<br>
<br>Relations with Lady Huntingdon deteriorated in 1778 when Peckwell made it clear that he would rather leave the connexion than give up the Westminster chapel, that &#145;&hellip; he would not be under the direction of any Committee or Person whatever, that he would, if employed in the connexion, go where he pleased &amp; stay as long as he pleased&#146;  (Thomas Wills to Lady Huntingdon, 10 March 1778, Cheshunt collection, F1/1823). Although his ample patrimony meant he needed little patronage, he eventually accepted from Lord Robert Manners (whose wife was a regular correspondent of Lady Huntingdon) the rectory of Bloxholm-cum-Digby in Lincolnshire (presented 20 February 1782), which he retained until his death. He was also chaplain to the marchioness of Lothian.<br>
<br>About 1783 Peckwell travelled to Dublin. He delivered sermons at Lady Huntingdon's chapel in Plunket Street, Dublin, and other city churches and drew large congregations by dint of his electrifying preaching. Through the influence of Elizabeth Rawdon, countess of Moira, Lady Huntingdon's eldest daughter, he was permitted to preach in the chapel of the Magdalen Institution. However, his forthright sermons led to complaints from many members of this fashionable congregation. After an application was made requesting the archbishop of Dublin to curtail the spread of Methodism in the Church of Ireland, Peckwell crossed back to England.<br>
<br>Peckwell's last years, spent mainly in London, were distinguished as much for philanthropy as preaching. He was a member of the Humane Society and the Society for the Relief of Persons Imprisoned for Small Debts, and in 1784 he founded an institution called the Sick Man's Friend. It aimed to relieve the sick poor of all denominations, as well as supplying instruction. He studied medicine to make himself personally adept at this work, but died on 18 August 1787 at his house in Princes Street, Westminster, from the effects of pricking his hand while making a post-mortem examination of a consumptive. Mortification had spread too far to make amputation of the swollen limb possible, and his passing was &#145;regretted by thousands&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1787). He was buried in the church of St Peter the Great, Chichester, Sussex, on 23 August. Peckwell was well liked and respected for his combination of gifts. As one funeral eulogy put it: &#145;His heart was deeply impressed by, and had a powerful and sweet experience of those things of which his understanding had so clear a perception&#146;  (Townshend, 15). The sermons which he preached for the benefit of his charity produced as much as &pound;400 p.a. for his widow, who died in her house in Wilmot Street, Brunswick Square, on 28 November 1816.<br>
<br>Peckwell published many sermons as well as <span class="italic">A Collection of Psalms and Hymns</span> (1774?). He had three children. His daughter, Selina Mary (named after her godmother, Lady Huntingdon), married George Grote the banker in 1793, and their son was George Grote the historian. His second son, <a name="cosubject_21748"></a><span class="headword">Sir Robert Henry Peckwell <span class="st"> [<em>later </em>Blosset]</span></span>  (<em>bap. </em>1776, <em>d.</em> 1823)<span class="occ"></span>, was baptized on 10 July 1776 at St Mary's Church, Marylebone. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 23 October 1792, was awarded his BA in 1796 and MA in 1799, and became a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in 1801, and serjeant-at-law in 1809. He was deputy recorder of Cambridge, and a counsel on the Norfolk circuit. In 1822 he was knighted and appointed chief justice of Calcutta, where he died, unmarried, on 1 February 1823 after exercising his office for only two months. He took his mother's name of Blosset. He published <span class="italic">Cases of Controverted Elections in the Second Parliament of the United Kingdom</span>, 2 vols. (1804&#150;6).<br>
