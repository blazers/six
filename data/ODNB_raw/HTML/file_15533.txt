<span class="headword">Killigrew, Sir  Henry</span>  (1525<span class="mult">x</span>8&#150;1603), <span class="occ">diplomat</span>, was the fourth son of John Killigrew (<i>d</i>. 1568), landowner of Arwennack, Cornwall, and his wife, Elizabeth, second daughter of James Trewennard. His brothers included the MPs John Killigrew (<i>d</i>. 1584) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15540/', "Sir William Killigrew (d. 1622)")</script>. Based in Cornwall since the mid-thirteenth century the Killigrews owned land in the parish of St Erme near Truro, although the family seat at Arwennack, where Henry Killigrew was most likely born, was not established until 1385. By the reign of Henry VIII the Killigrews were well placed among the west country gentry, John Killigrew being entrusted by the king with the sensitive office of captain of Pendennis Castle. Henry Killigrew may well have attended Cambridge University, although there is no evidence that he ever obtained a degree. Nevertheless he was certainly educated to a high standard. In addition to a thorough grounding in classical languages and literature and a keen interest in music and painting, he possessed a strong grasp of both Italian and French.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareerandexile15521558"></a>Early career and exile, 1552&#150;1558</h2>Killigrew's career as a public servant began in 1552 with his appointment as harbourmaster for the duchy of Cornwall, the same year that he received the office of collector of rents for the manor of Helston, Cornwall. On 18 February 1553 he was returned as MP for Launceston. No doubt in part this small but useful collection of offices reflected the natural expectations that even a younger son born to a well connected landowning family might reasonably have. It also demonstrated the value of holding the correct religious sympathies under a particular regime. He was already known to John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, for his service to him as a gentleman usher in the mid-1540s, and the strong protestant faith evinced by Killigrew and his family did much to bolster their popularity with the government.<br>
<br>Killigrew's Dudley association did not extend to support for Northumberland's efforts to alter the succession. Killigrew and his family made no effort to oppose Mary's accession. Only when it became clear that a corner-stone of the Counter-Reformation in England would be the queen's marriage to Philip of Spain did Killigrew and his brothers repudiate their allegiance. By December 1553 Killigrew had travelled to the French court to seek the support of Henri II for a planned rising. When this rising failed the French king swiftly distanced himself from the affair, leaving Killigrew and his co-conspirators adrift and exiled. Killigrew remained in Europe until Elizabeth I's accession. By mid-1554 he had joined the household of the protestant Fran&ccedil;ois de Vend&ocirc;me, vidame de Chartres. It was in this capacity that Killigrew gained his first military experience, fighting with the vidame in Italy, experience that was augmented when he once again fought for the French at St Quentin in August 1557. Ironically, another facet of Killigrew's development largely formed during his exile was a strong distrust of the French. For all that he and his fellow exiles were welcomed into the French army, once their usefulness as rebels was exhausted Henri and his advisers treated them with thinly veiled contempt. This poor treatment cemented in Killigrew an enduring dislike of the French that coloured his attitude towards them during his time as a leading Elizabethan diplomat. Most important, it was during this period that he gained invaluable experience of European courts. In addition to the many contacts he made in France he spent time in Italy, not only as part of the vidame's forces, but also in 1556 on a sensitive mission to Edward Courteney, earl of Devonshire, seeking to gain his commitment to lead yet another rebellion against Mary. When this proved unsuccessful, and no doubt heartily disillusioned with his French hosts, Killigrew travelled to Germany and took up residence in Strasbourg. It was there in November 1557 that Thomas Randolph found him, and on Mary's behalf requested that he perform a reconnaissance mission in France. It was significant that this request was apparently made with the full knowledge of Princess Elizabeth. Having completed the mission Killigrew returned to Strasbourg, where he remained until Mary's death. The earlier suggestion that Elizabeth was aware of both Killigrew and his suitability for diplomatic work was confirmed when shortly after her accession the young queen summoned him back to London as a prelude to dispatching him as her envoy to the protestant princes of Germany.<h2>
<a name="FranceandScotlanddiplomatandsoldier15581563"></a>France and Scotland: diplomat and soldier, 1558&#150;1563</h2>Throughout the thirty-five years that Killigrew served Elizabeth as agent and ambassador the focus of his work was to protect England from the encroachment of Catholic Spain and France. By turns ordered to sow dissent among Catholics and forge consensus between protestants, Killigrew's abiding inspiration and succour was his profound protestant faith. Within months of his return to England he was sent on a low-key mission to Otto-Heinrich, the elector palatine, and Christoph, duke of W&uuml;rttemberg, with the aim of re-establishing friendly relations between Germany's protestant princes and England. When he arrived in Heidelberg in December 1558 Killigrew's enthusiasm was such that he may have given the mistaken impression that Elizabeth was actually seeking an alliance with the princes, much to the queen's irritation. Even so, the mission was not entirely fruitless. In addition to signalling England's readiness to reopen communications with Germany's protestant princes, Killigrew also held useful discussions with the new elector palatine, Friedrich III, and his son John Casimir, about the possibility of supplying Elizabeth with mercenaries.<br>
<br>From Germany Killigrew travelled to France to meet his old master, the vidame, now the governor of Calais. His objective was to discuss with him the possibility of the French reinstating Calais to English rule. Killigrew was gulled by the vidames into believing that Henri might entertain such a proposal. He duly forwarded this misinformation both to Elizabeth at court and to her commissioners at C&acirc;teau-Cambr&eacute;sis before arriving at C&acirc;teau-Cambr&eacute;sis himself. There he was promptly detained by the leader of the French negotiators, Anne de Montmorency, constable of France, who took a decidedly dim view of his interference. Killigrew contributed nothing more to the peace talks. He remained in detention until peace was signed after which the constable, no doubt confident that his charge could do no more damage, released him, allowing Killigrew to return home by late March 1559.<br>
<br>Killigrew's homecoming was brief. In May he was dispatched to Paris to serve as secretary to Elizabeth's resident ambassador in France, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton. After Henri died on 10 July 1559 as a result of a jousting accident, leaving the ultra-Catholic Guise faction in control of the French crown, the central aim of the English ambassador and his attach&eacute; was to minimize the ability of France to threaten England through her support of Scotland. To this end they gave what tacit support they could to the Huguenot leaders with the hope of further destabilizing France. Additionally they sought, through the dispatch of reports detailing the dangers of further French involvement in Scotland, to persuade the queen and her advisers of the necessity of lending tangible aid to the lords of the congregation. Given the continued presence of French troops in Scotland and the ongoing efforts to increase their numbers, the reports of Throckmorton and Killigrew were sufficient to convince Elizabeth of the need for action. In March 1560 she ordered William Grey, thirteenth Baron Grey of Wilton, to lead an army to Berwick where it would ready itself to aid the lords of the congregation in their siege of the French garrison in Leith. Ever cautious, however, Elizabeth also attempted to secure a peaceful resolution, acquiescing to the dispatch of a French envoy, Jean de Monluc, bishop of Valence, to Scotland in the hope that he might yet broker an agreement between the regent, Mary de Guise, and the rebels. Both to act as escort, and to ensure that Monluc did not stray from his remit, Killigrew was appointed to accompany him. The two men arrived in Scotland in April, but due largely to the intransigence of both parties the talks came to nothing. In consequence the Anglo-Scottish force assaulted Leith and was duly repulsed with heavy losses. Arriving in London on the same day as the unfortunate news, Killigrew was one of those to bear the queen's wrath. However, his fall from grace was brief. The treaty of Edinburgh and the withdrawal of French troops from Scotland vindicated the hardline policy that Killigrew had so energetically urged upon Elizabeth and the zealous diplomat was once more restored to favour.<br>
<br>For two years Killigrew remained in England, with Sir Robert Dudley acting as his patron. Then in August 1562 he was once again called upon to travel to France. In the aftermath of Henri's death and with the support of the dowager queen, Catherine de' Medici, the Guise opposition to the Huguenot cause was proving implacable. By autumn 1562 the Huguenots had been confined to a handful of strongholds to which their enemies were consistently and successfully laying siege. In sending Killigrew to Normandy, Elizabeth sought to discover the strength of the Huguenot forces and fortifications, and whether, in return for her military and financial support, their leaders would be prepared to cede Calais to the English. With extreme reluctance the French rebels agreed that, in return for an army of 6000 men and a gift of a million crowns, they would permit the English to garrison Newhaven (Le Havre) and Dieppe until such time as they were in a position to restore Calais. At the beginning of October Sir Adrian Poynings sailed with the 1500 strong vanguard of the expeditionary force to Le Havre, where Killigrew awaited him. Without official sanction, but quite possibly with the tacit approval of the queen, Killigrew, in company with Thomas Leighton, immediately set out from Le Havre at the head of a 400 strong Anglo-French force intent upon bringing aid to the Huguenots besieged at Rouen. Their effort proved to be too little too late. Having gained entry to the city Killigrew and Leighton's force could do nothing but forestall the inevitable. Rouen fell on 26 October, and Killigrew was one of the few Englishmen captured who was not subsequently hanged. He became the captive of Henri d'Anville de Montmorency, son of the constable. After the payment of a considerable ransom, Killigrew returned home in May 1563.<h2>
<a name="TriumphinScotland15631575"></a>Triumph in Scotland, 1563&#150;1575</h2>In recognition of Killigrew's work in Scotland he was appointed in June 1561 to the lucrative office of teller of the exchequer. In addition to the salary of &pound;33 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. Killigrew and his three colleagues were responsible for the receipt and dispersal of nearly all the exchequer's revenue, providing them with the opportunity to make considerable profits from short-term speculation. It was another sixteen years before Killigrew received his next appointment, when, in 1577, he was made receiver of piracy fines. Finally, in 1580 Elizabeth appointed him surveyor of the royal armoury. Undoubtedly these offices provided Killigrew with a healthy income, much needed to subsidize the relatively poor diets he received as an ambassador&#151;on average &pound;2 per day; they did not, however, make him an influential figure within the government. He was MP for Saltash in Cornwall in 1563 but did little in parliament. Throughout Elizabeth's reign Killigrew's best hope of exercising influence rested in his relationships with the queen's great favourites, his long time patron, Dudley (now earl of Leicester), and from the later 1560s Killigrew's brother-in-law, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4983/', "Sir William Cecil (1520/21&#150;1598)")</script>. On 4 November 1565 Killigrew married Katherine [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15531/', "Killigrew, Katherine (c.1542&#150;1583)")</script>], fifth daughter of gentleman and scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6155/', "Sir Anthony Cooke (1505/6&#150;1576)")</script>, royal tutor, of Gidea Hall, Essex, and his wife, Anne. The marriage, for all the advantages it conveyed to the young diplomat, was apparently one of love. The couple had four daughters. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1002/', "Sir Nicholas Bacon (1510&#150;1579)")</script>, lord keeper, was an influential brother-in-law, but the most important connection was with Cecil. The link to Cecil, originally little to the principal secretary's liking, ultimately secured for Killigrew the support of the most influential man in England.<br>
<br>Barring two brief missions to Scotland in 1566 and 1567 Killigrew remained in England for more than six years after his ill-starred military escapades in France. His next diplomatic mission, begun in February 1569, took him once again to Heidelberg. In response to an overture made by Friedrich III, Killigrew travelled to Germany to explore the possibility of a defensive alliance and discuss conditions under which the queen might grant a loan of 100,000 crowns in order to finance a protestant military expedition against the Low Countries and France. The mission, to which Killigrew was strongly committed, foundered on the reluctance of Friedrich's German allies to form a confederation with a foreign power, and Elizabeth's fear that too close an association with the protestant princes might well serve simply to draw the wrath of the Catholic powers directly upon her. Killigrew was returned as MP for Truro in 1571 and 1572 and was more active on committees than in previous parliaments, including sitting on one concerned with Mary, queen of Scots (12 May 1572).<br>
<br>On 24 August 1572 thousands of Huguenots were killed in the St Bartholomew's day massacre. This did much to convince Elizabeth and her privy councillors that once free of civil war France might well make a determined effort to restore Catholicism to England, as ever using Scotland to facilitate its efforts. To avoid this it would be vital to ensure that Scotland was united under a strong protestant government. To this end Killigrew, recently returned from France, where for the previous three years he had been serving as secretary to the resident ambassador, Sir Francis Walsingham, was dispatched to Edinburgh. His instructions were to broker a peace between the regency government of James VI, headed by John Erskine, first earl of Mar, and James Douglas, fourth earl of Morton, and the supporters of Mary, Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange and William Maitland of Lethington. He was instructed to persuade the regency government to take custody of Mary, who was then a prisoner in England, and then arrange her execution as expeditiously as possible, thus relieving Elizabeth of the unwholesome task.<br>
<br>The mission, probably the most challenging of Killigrew's career, also witnessed his greatest success. The ambassador could only get Mar and Morton to connive at the judicial murder of Mary if Elizabeth openly supported them in the act. However, Killigrew was considerably more successful in other respects. Mar died on 29 October 1572, leaving a power vacuum in the regency government. His natural successor, Morton, was disinclined to accept the role without financial and, preferably also, military support from England. Killigrew tried to convince Morton in mid-December that the demands the latter had made were about to be met by Elizabeth. However, Morton was dubious and refused to give way to Killigrew's persuasions that he declare himself governor without firm support in money and military aid from England, which he got. On 31 December the ten-month truce between the two Scottish factions expired and the possibility of renewed conflict seemed great. The leaders of the Scottish queen's party, Kirkcaldy and Maitland, from their position of relative strength in Edinburgh Castle, resisted all Killigrew's attempts to make peace. However, the ambassador had considerably more success with their allies beyond the city. In February 1573 he met the leaders of the two parties, excluding Kirkcaldy and Maitland, at Leith and successfully negotiated an agreement by which the Marians accepted the rule of the regency government in return for liberal concessions on the part of the king. Having helped both to secure the appointment of Morton as governor and to isolate the opposition leaders it only remained for Killigrew to secure the English military support necessary to reduce Edinburgh Castle. This he finally gained in April when Sir William Drury, captain of Berwick, led a force of 1500 men and thirty-three pieces of artillery to Edinburgh. Finally, on 26 May the garrison surrendered. Maitland died in prison on 9 June and Kirkcaldy was executed on 3 August. Due in no small part to the unrelenting efforts of Killigrew, opponents of the regency were either broken or won over, and the danger of a Franco-Scottish alliance eliminated. Over the next two years Killigrew performed two further embassies to Scotland in which he made every effort to nurture Anglo-Scottish relations and support Morton's regency. Elizabeth recalled him in September 1575, bringing to an end the most productive period of his diplomatic career.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears15751603"></a>Final years, 1575&#150;1603</h2>Aside from his lucrative work as teller of the exchequer, Killigrew was also called upon to offer advice on diplomatic affairs and to act as interpreter and companion to high-ranking foreign guests. His long service to Elizabeth did not go unrewarded. In recognition of his work in Scotland he was granted the manor of Lanreath, Cornwall, in May 1573. The following year Killigrew added to his Cornish holdings with the purchase of the manor of Bottlet from Henry Hastings, third earl of Huntingdon, for &pound;3600. Additionally, he owned an estate in Hendon in Middlesex and a house next to St Paul's churchyard. His position as a significant landowner was reflected in his involvement in local government. In addition to serving as MP for Truro (elected in 1571 and 1572), between about 1579 and 1587 he served on the quorum of the peace for Cornwall. Much of his personal life seems to have been devoted to the management of his estates and correspondence with his puritan friends such as Elizabeth's resident ambassador to the Netherlands, William Davison, and his patrons Burghley and Leicester. In December 1584 his daughter Anne (<i>d</i>. 1632) married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19940/', "Henry Neville (1561/2&#150;1615)")</script> of Wargrave in Berkshire. He was the first of several sons-in-law with whom Killigrew got on well.<br>
<br>In November 1585 Killigrew was summoned to perform his penultimate foreign mission, as one of Leicester's key advisers in the Netherlands. For all that the earl commanded an English relief force that represented one of the best hopes of the states general to defeat the Spanish, his high-handed manner and divisive policies made bitter opponents of the Dutch leaders. As one of Leicester's most senior advisers Killigrew shared in this odium. His situation became still less comfortable when Leicester appointed him joint head of the new chamber of finance in July 1586. Killigrew's main responsibilities were to investigate corruption among the Dutch leadership and to impede commercial activities between the Provinces and their Spanish enemies. Relief came when in November he followed Leicester back to England. In June 1587 he returned to the Low Countries, but unlike Leicester, who received his final recall in November, Killigrew remained with the Dutch for another year. With Leicester's departure he became the most senior civilian English representative in the Netherlands. This was a somewhat empty honour given the distrust and resentment with which the English were regarded by the Dutch leaders, in particular Paul Buys and Johan Oldenbarnevelt. Much of Killigrew's remaining time in the Netherlands was devoted to undoing Leicester's work and seeking to make peace between the states general and those towns that had rejected its authority. Killigrew's long-sought recall finally came in January 1589, largely the result of his continuing unpopularity with the Dutch leaders; it was also an acknowledgement that one of Elizabeth's longest serving diplomats was now both old and tired.<br>
<br>Killigrew's final foreign mission, begun in July 1591, as part of an English expeditionary force sent to assist Henri of Navarre in his siege of Rouen, saw him serving as adviser to Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, and in company with his old comrade, Leighton, attempting to restrain the incautious young general. He was also responsible for much of the logistical organization of the 3400 strong army. Despite his age and growing infirmity Killigrew seems to have performed this latter duty with considerable competence. He went to great lengths to ensure that the army was fed and discipline maintained, as well as expending much effort and money in arranging for the sick to be transported home. Neither he nor Leighton were able to stop Essex treating the campaign as something of an adventure, nevertheless, the general made clear his gratitude for Killigrew's efforts when he knighted the old diplomat on 20 November, a week before his return to England.<br>
<br>Killigrew largely retired from public service. He retained the tellership of the exchequer until March 1599, and occasionally returned to court to participate in diplomatic negotiations. Katherine Killigrew died on 27 December 1583, and her widower married a Frenchwoman, Ja&eacute;l de Peigne (<i>d</i>. 1617&times;34), on 7 November 1590. The couple had three sons, Joseph, Henry, and Robert, and one daughter. Killigrew intervened on behalf of Neville in early 1601, who had become embroiled in Essex's revolt. Killigrew died on 2 March 1603 and was buried in London at St Margaret, Lothbury. His will, proved on 16 April, provided annuities for his wife and two younger sons totalling &pound;140, as well as further bequests to them with a value of &pound;1700.<br>
