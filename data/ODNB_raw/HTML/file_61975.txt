<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kemeys family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1570&#150;1747), <span class="occ">landowners</span>, were allegedly descended from Stephen de Kemeys who owned land in Monmouthshire about 1234. Between 1576 and 1783 nine members of the Kemeys family were sheriffs of Glamorgan while several represented the borough or the county of Monmouth in parliament. <a name="cosubject_75465"></a><span class="headword">Edward [i] Kemeys</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1607)<span class="occ"></span> held the estate in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. He was married first to Elizabeth, daughter of Rowland Morgan of Machen, and second to Catherine, daughter of William Kemeys of Llanrhymney and widow of Henry Morgan, the second son of Rowland Morgan of Machen. Between 1573 and 1608 he was on the commission of the peace and was four times sheriff of Glamorgan. According to contemporary reports, he was unscrupulous and &#145;abused every function which it was left to him as sheriff to commit&#146;. In 1585, the Star Chamber indicted him for accepting a bribe and releasing a prisoner, selling offices, and imprisoning the county gaoler. In mid-1595 he handpicked a coroner's court jury in a murder case to save the life of a friend, and in 1599 he was fined &pound;500 and 100 marks damages. This action also led to his removal from the commission of the peace &#145;until his right honourable the Lord Keeper should be better satisfied of his behaviour&#146;  (Williams, 107). He died about 1607 and his will was proved in March 1610.<br>
<br>In the seventeenth century the Cefnmabli estate was owned by <a name="cosubject_75466"></a><span class="headword">David Kemeys</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1617)<span class="occ"></span>, a nephew of Edward [i] Kemeys. In 1616 he married Rachel, daughter of Sir Robert Hopton and coheir of her brother, Ralph, Lord Hopton. He was sheriff of Glamorgan in 1616&#150;17. After his death by drowning in 1617 his son <a name="cosubject_75467"></a><span class="headword">Edward [ii] Kemeys</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1637)<span class="occ"></span> gained ownership of the estate. He married Theodosia, daughter of Sir Henry Capel. Theodosia died on 1 January 1636 and Edward died one year later, on 12 January 1637. His daughter Elizabeth briefly succeeded him before dying on 31 January 1637. The title of the estate then passed to Elizabeth's great-uncle <a name="cosubject_75469"></a><span class="headword">Sir Nicholas Kemeys</span>, first baronet  (<em>d.</em> 1648)<span class="occ"></span>, of Llanfair Castle. In 1628 he was elected member of parliament for the borough of Monmouth, and in 1631&#150;2 was appointed sheriff of Monmouthshire, and in 1638&#150;9 high sheriff of Glamorgan. On 13 May 1642 he was created a baronet by Charles I and became the MP for Glamorgan. He was an ardent royalist commander during the first civil war. He raised a regiment of horse and was appointed governor of Cardiff Castle. On 25 May 1648 he died defending Chepstow Castle for three weeks after refusing to surrender to Cromwell's forces. His body was dismembered and parts of it later adorned the hats of his roundhead attackers. A later poem described Kemeys's brave defence of the castle:<blockquote>
<div>Let us Sir Nicholas Kemeys' name rehearse,<br>
</div>
<div>Let not our bards his noble deeds forget!<br>
</div>
<div>Perchance his bright example may be yet<br>
</div>
<div>A beacon to some hero yet unborn!<br>
</div>
<div>Our land may yet by cival war be torn<br>
</div>
<div>Perchance some valiant Welshman yet may rise<br>
</div>
<div>To emulate the deeds of our Kemeys!<br>
</div> (Rowlands, 25)</blockquote>Nicholas's son <a name="cosubject_75468"></a><span class="headword">Sir Charles [i] Kemeys</span>, second baronet  (<em>c.</em>1614&#150;1658)<span class="occ"></span>, studied at Jesus College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 3 February 1632, and in 1634 he was a student at Gray's Inn. On 13 June 1643 he was knighted at Oxford, and on the death of his father in 1648 succeeded him as second baronet. He was similarly a staunch royalist who attacked Cardiff in 1646 and later defended Pembroke Castle. Upon its surrender he was fined &pound;5262 and exiled for two years. He married twice; his first wife was Blanche, daughter of Sir Lewis Mansel of Margam, and his second wife was Margaret, daughter of Sir George Whitmore, lord mayor of London in 1631&#150;2. He died in 1658 and was succeeded by his son <a name="cosubject_75470"></a><span class="headword">Sir Charles [ii] Kemeys</span>, third baronet  (1651/2&#150;1702)<span class="occ"></span>. On 26 May 1669 he matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, and on 9 July 1669 proceeded MA. He was MP for Monmouthshire in 1685&#150;7 and 1695&#150;8, and for Monmouth borough in 1690&#150;95. He also held the office of sheriff of Glamorgan about 1689, and he was the governor of Cardiff Castle in 1702. He married twice, but the indications are that he was a less than affectionate husband as he &#145;worshipped the bottle rather than his wife and proved demonstrably neglectful of her feelings&#146;  (Jenkins, 101). He died on 22 December 1702.<br>
<br>Sir Charles [ii] Kemeys's son <a name="cosubject_75471"></a><span class="headword">Sir Charles [iii] Kemeys</span>, fourth baronet  (1688&#150;1735)<span class="occ"></span>, was born on 23 November 1688. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 17 June 1706. He was sheriff of Glamorgan between 1712 and 1713 and MP for Monmouthshire in 1713&#150;15 and for Glamorgan from 1716 to 1734. There were a number of political intrigues involving Charles [iii] Kemeys, notably concerning election expenses, and there is one tale of his friendship with George, the elector of Hanover, and his reluctance to accept him as the king of Great Britain. In spite of Kemeys' support for the Stuart cause, the king sought to renew his friendship with Sir Charles and allegedly remarked &#145;Send for him&#151;tell him he must come. I long to smoke a pipe with him&#146;. Kemeys nevertheless proved his loyalty to the Stuarts by stating, &#145;I should be happy to smoke a pipe with him as Elector of Hanover, but I cannot think of it as king of England&#146;  (&#145;Cefn Mably&#146;, <span class="italic">South Wales Daily News</span>, Jan&#150;Feb 1910). With his death, without issue, on 29 January 1735 the baronetcy became extinct.<br>
<br>In 1704 <a name="cosubject_75472"></a><span class="headword">Jane Kemeys</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1747)<span class="occ"></span>, the sister of Sir Charles [iii] Kemeys, married Sir John Tynte, second baronet (1683&#150;1710), of Halswell, Somerset. They had three sons, Halswell (1705&#150;1730), John (1707&#150;1740), and Charles (1710&#150;1785), and one daughter, Jane (1708&#150;1741). The early deaths of their male grandchildren meant that the estate devolved to their granddaughter Jane Hassell (1738&#150;1824). On 19 February 1765 she married Lieutenant-Colonel John Johnson of Glaiston, Rutland (<i>d</i>. 1806), and by royal licence granted on 28 October 1785 took the family name of Kemeys-Tynte. Jane Kemeys-Tynte died on 29 January 1824, and the male issue of the Kemeys-Tynte family throughout the nineteenth century then inherited the estate.<br>
