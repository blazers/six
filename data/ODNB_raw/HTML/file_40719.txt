<span class="headword">Pim, Sir  Alan William</span>  (1871&#150;1958), <span class="occ">administrator in India and colonial adviser</span>, was born on 17 May 1871 at Foxrock, co. Dublin, one of at least four children of James Pim and Elizabeth Fayle Evans of Monkstown, co. Dublin. From 1885 Pim attended the Society of Friends school, Bootham, Yorkshire (which took a large number of boys from Ireland), winning the annual old boys' association leaving scholarship on his departure in 1887. He attended both Leipzig University and Trinity College, Dublin, where he matriculated as a scholar in 1891, graduating BA in 1893.<br>
<br>After success in the 1894 Indian Civil Service exams, Pim arrived in India on 4 December 1895. He held various positions in the North Western Provinces and Oudh (later the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh) including, briefly, from May 1898, those as private secretary to the lieutenant-governor, Sir James La Touche, and as assistant settlement, and then settlement, officer. Pim published a monograph on the region's woollen industries in 1898. In 1903 he was appointed to the provincial legislature, and then in 1910 was made the joint secretary of the board of revenue. Remaining in India during the war, Pim served as secretary to the government from April 1912 to August 1917. In 1916 he married Nora Gordon, daughter of Sir J. Scott. Appointed divisional commissioner, in April 1925 he returned to the board of revenue as commissioner. Pim was selected as a temporary member of the United Provinces executive council in December 1928. He retired in July 1930 having been made CIE in June 1918, CSI in January 1926, and KCIE in June 1929. Pim belonged to both the Royal Asiatic Society and the Punjab Historical Society. In 1935 he was made KBE.<br>
<br>His most notable and important work, investigating the financial and economic conditions of British colonies, chiefly African, began in 1932 when the Colonial Office appointed Pim to carry out a financial and economic inquiry in Swaziland. Pim undertook similar commissions in Zanzibar, also in 1932, where he reached the difficult conclusion that the numbers and salaries of European and Indian officials would have to be cut in order to effect an improvement in the government's financial position, in the Bechuanaland protectorate in 1933, British Honduras in 1934, and Basutoland in 1935. In Kenya, Pim investigated the controversial issue of the racial basis of taxation in 1936. His report, recommending a European income tax, was described as a &#145;Mill's bomb&#146; by dismayed white settlers  (Bennett, 326). His last major appointment was as financial and economic commissioner in Northern Rhodesia in 1937, and his painstaking work on these commissions, by highlighting the need for colonial economic reform, contributed to the late 1930s official reassessment of colonial development policy.<br>
<br>The Colonial Office continued thereafter to draw on his expertise, with Pim advising in a report submitted in 1948 against the possibilities of large-scale settlement of European displaced persons in Kenya, Tanganyika, and Northern Rhodesia. Pim also served from 1935 on the colonial development advisory committee. All this experience equipped him for subsequent activities as a speaker and writer concerned with African economic conditions. He gave the 1938 Beit lectures on colonial economic history at the University of Oxford, published in 1940 as <span class="italic">The Financial and Economic History of the African Tropical Territories</span>, paying particular attention to the application of European capital, and produced <span class="italic">Colonial Agricultural Production</span> under the auspices of Chatham House. A draft of a book dated 1953 entitled &#145;The dependent empire&#146; went unpublished.<br>
<br>Little is known about Pim's private life, but he listed his hobbies as &#145;rather indefinite, books generally, and some games; later, travel&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bootham School Register</span>, 183). He died aged eighty-seven at the White House, Headington Hill, Oxford, on 28 June 1958. He was survived by Lady Pim.<br>
