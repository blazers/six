<span class="headword">Williams,  William</span>  (1800&#150;1878), <span class="occ">linguist and first bishop of Waiapu in New Zealand</span>, was born in Nottingham on 18 July 1800, the son of Thomas Williams (1754&#150;1804), hosier, and his wife, Mary Marsh (1758&#150;1831), a school teacher; he was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29510/', "Archdeacon Henry Williams")</script>. Among the best educated and most intellectually accomplished missionaries to New Zealand, he had attended Southwell grammar school, trained as a surgeon, graduated BA from Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1825, and received a DCL on 3 July 1851. He married Jane Nelson (1801&#150;1896), who had been a teacher at his mother's school, at Sheffield on 11 July 1825. William Williams was ordained in 1824, attended the Church Missionary Society (CMS) Training College in London in 1825, and on 12 August of that year embarked, with his wife of four weeks, to join his brother as a missionary in New Zealand. William and Jane Williams arrived at the Bay of Islands on 25 March 1826, after a three-month stay in Sydney, and immediately became part of a close-knit Williams missionary clan. Henry and Marianne Williams contributed eleven children; William and Jane nine.<br>
<br>William Williams remained based at Paihia as mission doctor and superintendent of the English Boys' School until 1835, when the school was relocated to Waimate nearby. In the 1830s he undertook several evangelical journeys, which were more arduous than those of his brother. In 1840 William and his wife established a new station at Turanga, Poverty Bay, where they remained until 1865. William Williams was appointed archdeacon of the East Cape in 1842, and first bishop of Waiapu in 1859. He returned to England in 1851&#150;2 to put his brother's case in a dispute with the CMS. During the New Zealand wars he and his family moved in 1865 back to Paihia for two years. The &#145;native rebellion&#146; reflected badly on its teachers, and Williams published a long defence of the CMS mission to the Maori, <span class="italic">Christianity among the New Zealanders</span>, in London in 1867. Maori victories in 1868 brought him close to despair: &#145;What does this seem to indicate, but that God's hand has been turned against us&#146;  (MS Archives, CN/O 96, c). Nevertheless, Williams returned to his diocese in 1867, taking up residence at Napier. Ill health compelled him to resign as bishop in 1876. He died at Napier on 9 February 1878.<br>
<br>Despite fluency in the language, neither William nor Henry Williams was very tolerant of Maori custom, nor much interested in it for its own sake, in intriguing contrast to their older colleague, Samuel Marsden. William was taller, thinner, less combative, and more scholarly than Henry, and had less immediate impact. William Williams and his family contributed significantly to Maori education. His nephew, Samuel Williams, founded Te Aute Boys' College in 1854, in the Waiapu diocese, and William Williams himself founded Hukarere School for Maori girls, run by his daughters, in 1875. A son and a grandson, W. L. and H. W. Williams, succeeded him both as bishops of Waiapu and as leading Maori linguists. Overall, William Williams's greatest contribution was possibly in the latter field. He made a new translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> into Maori in 1837, from the original Greek, and published <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the Maori Language</span> at Paihia in 1844. Regularly revised by his son and grandson, it was not finally replaced until 1994.<br>
