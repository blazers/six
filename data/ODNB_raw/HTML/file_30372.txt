<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Alexander,  Samuel</span>  (1859&#150;1938), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, the third son and fourth child of Samuel Alexander, an Australian, and his wife, Eliza Sloman, who came from Cape Town, was born at Sydney, New South Wales, on 6 January 1859. His father, a saddler, died of consumption at the age of thirty-eight, shortly before his birth. His mother died in his house at Manchester in 1917, having gone to live with him there, with the rest of her family, in 1903.<br>
<br>About 1863 the family left Sydney for St Kilda, a suburb of Melbourne. Alexander was educated at home and at private schools before entering Wesley College, Melbourne, in 1871. There, and in his two years at the University of Melbourne, where he held an exhibition, he gained all the distinctions open to him. In 1877, without completing his degree, he sailed for Britain on a voyage lasting 108 days, with the express purpose, bold in view of the family finances, of winning a scholarship at Oxford or Cambridge. He was advised that a scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford, might be beyond his reach, and so prudently entered for one at Lincoln College as well, and did not succeed. But he won his scholarship at Balliol, where he graduated BA in 1881. Lincoln made amends by electing him to a fellowship in 1882. Its choice was amply justified by the sustained distinction of Alexander's undergraduate career, for he obtained firsts in mathematical and classical moderations (1879) and in <i>literae humaniores</i> (1881). According to the <span class="italic">Jewish Chronicle</span> this was the first election of a professing Jew to a fellowship in either of the ancient English universities.<br>
<br>Alexander retained his fellowship for eleven years, living in Oxford except for the period between the end of 1888 and June 1891. The break, originally designed to be permanent, was due partly to his desire to mingle with a wider world, partly to his determination to increase his proficiency in experimental psychology. In pursuit of the latter aim he studied under Hugo M&uuml;sterberg at Freiburg im Breisgau; in pursuit of the former, he lectured at Toynbee Hall, Whitechapel, and busied himself in other ways with the popularization of academic subjects. These activities were indicative of firmly held beliefs. In Oxford he was one of the rebels who thought that the course in Greats needed quickening from modern science, especially psychology. He lectured on that subject to any, dons or undergraduates, who were sufficiently interested to attend supernumerary courses. The same policy directed Alexander's occasional writings and his first book, <span class="italic">Moral Order and Progress</span> (1889), an expansion of his essay for the Green moral philosophy prize which he had won in 1887. In its day it was widely believed to be the best systematic general treatise on evolutionary ethics in the English language. In the preface Alexander expressed his &#145;present dissent from [T. H.] Green's fundamental principles&#146;  (Alexander, <span class="italic">Moral Order and Progress</span>, vii) and added: &#145;I have come to the ideas, borrowed from biology and the theory of evolution, which are prevalent in modern ethics, with a training derived from Aristotle and Hegel, and I have found, not antagonism but, on the whole, fulfilment&#146;  (ibid., viii).<br>
<br>In 1893 Alexander became professor of philosophy at the University of Manchester, where he taught for thirty-one years. It was a happy appointment. Even the physical climate of &#145;dear old sooty Manchester&#146; was tolerably congenial to him. In its university, while he had rather too many courses to give, their variety stimulated him, and, his classes being small, he could think aloud as he lectured. His academic influence soon extended far beyond his lecture-room. His width of interests, his unstudied, notorious, picturesque untidiness, his catholic understanding of whatever was young almost compelled this result. Long before he reached the peak of his fame he had become a focus for admiration and for vast affection in the university and in the city. He was prominent in the university's more public activities, especially in the movement for providing university residences for women. In an extra-academic way his feminist principles made him favour the cause, although not always the tactics, of the local advocates of women's suffrage. He was a left-wing Liberal and an early supporter of Zionism. He was a friend of Chaim Weizmann, whom he introduced to A. J. Balfour.<br>
<br>As the years passed, many of his friends began to fear that Alexander's wide knowledge and his highly original powers would never find expression in print. A very few articles and an admirable little book on Locke (1908) were inadequate counter-evidence. By 1907, however, according to his own modest statement, he had come to believe that he might have something to say. He took his cue, in a measure, from the realist principle of G. E. Moore's &#145;Refutation of idealism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mind</span>, 1903) but unlike many contemporary realists he was never content with polemical forays into the theory of knowledge. He was always bent upon a comprehensive system of ontological metaphysics, and this attitude, at the time, raised exceptional interest and expectation in the small world of technical British philosophy. The interest grew as Alexander in a series of presidential addresses to the Aristotelian Society (1908&#150;11: he was again president, 1936&#150;7) and in articles in <span class="italic">Mind</span> (1912&#150;13) attempted the exploratory work which, as he always maintained, should precede the composition of a serious philosophical treatise. When the University of Glasgow, shortly before the First World War, invited him to become its Gifford lecturer, there was a general belief that he would use the opportunity to complete the huge task for which he had been preparing so sedulously for at least seven years.<br>
<br>An elaborate essay, &#145;The basis of realism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the British Academy</span>, 1914), the year after he had been elected a fellow of that body, is an admirable summary of the results that Alexander had reached during this preparatory period. The Gifford lectures themselves, given in the war years 1917 and 1918, were called &#145;Space, time, and deity&#146;. Strenuously revised, but not very much altered, they were published under the same title (although Alexander much preferred the hyphenated form &#145;space-time&#146;) in two substantial volumes in 1920. By that time the issue of realism had become subordinate in the author's philosophy, although he remained a realist, holding that mind takes its place among the differentiated compresents in space-time. Primarily, Alexander was a metaphysician who attempted to describe and &#145;identify in concrete experience&#146; &#145;the ultimates which the sciences left over&#146;. Whatever is, he maintained, is a specification of space-time, either a &#145;categorial&#146; (or wholly pervasive) attribute of space-time, or, like the neural process which is &#145;enjoyed&#146; as personal experience, something &#145;empirical&#146; (that is, non-pervasive) which nevertheless evolves or &#145;emerges&#146; from the &#145;continuum of motions&#146; which is the ultimate matrix space-time. Deity is the stage beyond mind, as yet unaccomplished but descriptive of a <i>nisus</i> in space-time towards a specific accomplishment which, just because it expresses the march of things, should receive the reverent acquiescence of &#145;natural piety&#146;.<br>
<br>The value of the book has to be estimated by the vision, skill, and resolution with which it pursued its sweeping design. It is only accurate to say that, since Hobbes, no English philosopher, before Alexander, had built in accordance with so ambitious an architectural plan or had given comparable attention to the proportion and solidity of all the parts of his edifice. In less than a decade the general opinion was that the book marked the end of an epoch rather than a fresh beginning, and Alexander himself considered that the future was with A. N. Whitehead, rather than with himself, so far as such a philosophy had a future. He preferred to let his book stand with very few published afterthoughts, although his essay <span class="italic">Spinoza and Time</span> (1921) is an important supplement.<br>
<br>Alexander is acknowledged to be the first in a group of Anglo-American philosophers, comprising most notably Whitehead and John Dewey, who wrote in the first half of the twentieth century and who attempted to construct a metaphysics of experience that would resolve the dualisms of modern philosophy&#151;such as mind and body, and subject and object&#151;without resorting to the completed harmonies of idealistic philosophy. The search for an open system that embraces diversity in noncoercive and transmuting unities continues today in such successors of empirical metaphysics as process philosophy and anti-foundationalism. In the period following the Second World War books were written on Alexander's philosophy from the viewpoints of process philosophy, idealism, naturalism, and empirical dualism, reflecting the complexity and the potentialities of his thought for productive reinterpretation. In each case, the commentators drew upon a different strand of Alexander's philosophy and showed its implications, allowing his thought to inform schools with which he had kinship, but with which he could not be fully identified.<br>
<br>Alexander was modest, although not self-depreciating. He wrote and planned in the grand manner simply because no other manner suited this theme. He resigned his chair in 1924, but continued to live in Manchester in honoured and busy tranquillity. Manchester's pride in him seemed to increase with his years. In its university he presented for honorary degrees until 1930, in a memorably delightful way. His fairly frequent public lectures were eagerly attended in Manchester and elsewhere. At philosophical congresses he held as of right the unofficial position of the foremost British philosopher, distinguished in matter, manner, and beauty of voice, sensitive to the meeting's mind, and overcoming the lifelong handicap of his deafness with charm. His striking head, Roman&#150;Jewish profile, and beard gave him an impressive appearance. His main interest in these closing years was in literature and aesthetic theory. This is shown in several of the essays published after his death in <span class="italic">Philosophical and Literary Pieces</span> (1939) and in his last book, <span class="italic">Beauty and other Forms of Value</span> (1933). Often humorous, always beautifully written and vividly informed by his psychological interest, his literary pieces include discussions of Dr Johnson, Jane Austen, Moli&egrave;re, and Pascal. <span class="italic">Beauty and other Forms of Value</span> marks a break with Alexander's interest in speculative, albeit scientifically chastened, metaphysical unity, substituting for it concern with analysing the structure of the finite, partial, and heterogeneous syntheses achieved by such cultural activities as the arts, sciences, and moral disciplines. Here Alexander falls in with the governing tendencies toward analysis in the British philosophy of his time, contributing to them cogently and with clarity and elegance. R. G. Collingwood commented in 1928 that Alexander's late writings on aesthetics were the most significant contribution to the philosophy of art in English philosophy since the eighteenth century.<br>
<br>Alexander's valedictory work, &#145;The historicity of things&#146;, in <span class="italic">Philosophy and History: Essays Presented to Ernst Cassirer</span>, edited by R. Klibansky and H. J. Paton (1936), is a beautiful and fully mature wisdom essay. Surrendering the last vestiges of rationalism in his doctrine of space-time, Alexander embraces Plato's &#145;wandering cause&#146;, which dooms rationalistic systems to failure.<br>
<br>Alexander died at Manchester on 13 September 1938, and his ashes lie in the section reserved for the British Jewish Reform congregation in Manchester southern cemetery. He was unmarried. He received honorary degrees from the universities of St Andrews, Durham, Oxford, Birmingham, Liverpool, and Cambridge, and was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1930. He was elected an honorary fellow of Lincoln College in 1918 and of Balliol College in 1925.<br>
