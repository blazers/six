<span class="headword">Manini,  Antony</span>  (<em>c.</em>1750&#150;1786), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was possibly born in Rome. Manini's early life has been the subject of a great deal of conjecture. Suggestions that he belonged to the Norfolk family of Mann and Italianized his name appear unreliable. It is perhaps more likely, as Sainsbury suggested, that he was related to the Italian composer named Manini who was living in Rome in 1733. This would sit more comfortably with Christopher Hogwood's assertion that he was a pupil of Tartini. It is also possible that the &#145;Signora Manini, a new and obscure singer&#146;  (Burney, 681), who was performing in England in 1712, was connected in some way.<br>
<br>Manini first came to notice in 1770, performing solos by Felice Giardini and Charles Chabran for his own benefit at the New Hall in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. He led the band in the same year at the opening of Christian's new concert room in Norwich, and also performed nearby in Beccles. He also established himself as a teacher in Great Yarmouth during the early 1770s, instructing ladies on the guitar and gentlemen on the violin.<br>
<br>In 1777 Manini appeared for the first time in Cambridge, as leading violinist at Miss Marshall's concert at St John's College, the programme containing music by Paradies (or Paradisi), Boccherini, and Abel. His <span class="italic">Six Divertimentos for Two Violins</span>, perhaps his only works to survive, were published in London around this time. One of Manini's violin pupils was Charles Hague. Manini and Hague enjoyed a fruitful musical partnership in later years. In 1779 and the following year Manini played first violin at Scarborough's annual concert at St Ives, Huntingdonshire, and in 1780 he had two benefit concerts at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. A similar concert was given in 1781 in Emmanuel College, close to where he was living at the time. In 1782 he appeared as leading violinist at Peterborough, Huntingdon, and Stamford, and received another benefit at Trinity. In 1783 he was principal violinist at Mrs Pratt's benefit concert in Caius College; in Trinity once again for his own benefit, on which occasion a member of the Cramer family (probably Johann Baptist) performed; and at Peterhouse for the benefit of Joseph Reinagle. In 1784 he held three subscription concerts on three successive days (1&#150;3 July) in the halls of King's and St John's; played first violin at Huntingdon, Hague appearing in the vocal part; and later played there again for Michael Leoni's benefit. He also gave Leoni a benefit concert at King's, with Leoni and Hague singing and Hague and Manini playing the violin. As well as in Cambridge, Manini and Hague appeared all around East Anglia during the period 1783&#150;4. In 1785, the year in which Gertrud Elisabeth Mara caused a stir in London and Oxford by refusing to stand for the &#145;Hallelujah&#146; chorus when performing Handel's <span class="italic">Messiah</span>, she also sang for Manini's benefit at Trinity. In November of that year a benefit concert was given at King's for the highly precocious William Crotch, then aged ten and later a violin pupil of Hague. On this occasion, the two future professors of music at Oxford and Cambridge respectively, Crotch and Hague, sang, and Hague and Manini played. Manini also performed at musical entertainments staged by John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, at Hinchingbrooke; he died soon after one of them at Huntingdon on 6 January 1786. He was buried in the parish of St Andrew's the Great in Cambridge. Manini was highly esteemed during his lifetime, both personally and as a musician.<br>
