<span class="headword">Ormsby,  John</span>  (1829&#150;1895), <span class="occ">writer and translator</span>, was born at Gortner Abbey, co. Mayo, on 25 April 1829, the eldest child and only son of George Ormsby (<i>d</i>. 1836), of the 3rd dragoon guards, who had fought in the Peninsula and became high sheriff of co. Mayo in 1827, and his wife, Marianne (<i>b</i>. 1801), third daughter of Humphrey Jones of Mullinabro, co. Kilkenny. He was a direct descendant of the Ormsby family which migrated from Lincolnshire to co. Mayo in the reign of Elizabeth I, and, on his mother's side, of Catherine Cromwell, eldest sister of Oliver Cromwell. On the death of both parents during his childhood, he was made the ward of Denis Browne, dean of Emly, sent to Dr Homan's private school at Seapoint, near Dublin, and subsequently educated at Trinity College, Dublin, which he entered as a pensioner in 1845. In 1850 he was admitted at the Middle Temple, and kept his terms, but he was never called to the bar. However, the distinguished Hispanist and friend of Ormsby, James Fitzmaurice-Kelly, observed that &#145;Mr Ormsby took with him into letters an intelligence trained in logical methods, an exact appreciation of the value of evidence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Revue Hispanique</span>, 2, 1895, 364). Leslie Stephen recalled him living amid a book-stacked confusion at 7 King's Bench Walk in the Temple, a &#145;denizen of [&hellip;] the cultivated and scholarlike Bohemia&#146; of London  (<span class="italic">Alpine Journal</span>, 34). He had prints of Hogarth and was very well read in eighteenth-century English literature, especially Defoe and Fielding. T. E. Kebbel remembered him as a convivial and much appreciated fellow-member of the tory Rambler Club, a kindly man with wide sympathies &#145;whom it was refreshing even to look at and [who] had a humour of his own, which was always finding vent, no matter what the subject&#146;  (Kebbel, 198&#150;9).<br>
<br>Ormsby joined the Alpine Club in the first year of its existence&#151;1858&#151;and contributed a vivid account, &#145;The ascent of the Grivola&#146;, about a climb that he made with others in August 1859 to <span class="italic">Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers</span> (1862). In 1864 he published <span class="italic">Autumn Rambles in North Africa</span>, travel sketches illustrated by himself and previously brought out in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> recounting &#145;two seasons' wanderings&#146; starting at Constantine and ending at Tunis. Here a sharp perception of visual detail (as in his account of the Tunis bazaars) and a sympathetic but realistic response to places and people are conveyed with considerable narrative skill. In 1876 he published a volume of pieces (<span class="italic">Stray Papers</span>) he had contributed to the <span class="italic">Saturday Review</span>, the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, and other journals, where his amused eye is turned mainly towards London and features of English life and culture. He also contributed articles to <span class="italic">Chambers' Encyclopaedia</span> and the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
<br>It is not clear when or how Ormsby first took an interest in Spain, its language, and its literature. He is plausibly credited with publishing, in 1872, a work entitled <span class="italic">Mountains of Spain</span>. In any case, it was after an extensive ramble in Spain, following the scenes of the exploits of that country's medieval hero El Cid in Valencia, Aragon, and Castile, with S&aacute;nchez's edition of the epic recounting that hero's story as his only book, that he undertook its translation, published in 1879. It is a much reduced version of the original, the greater part of it rendered into prose and only those passages that Ormsby judged to be the most vivid and dramatic put into English rhyming couplets. Here, however, his concern was &#145;to render [&hellip;] line for line and as literally as was compatible with justice to the original&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Poem of the Cid</span>, ed. and trans. J. Ormsby, 1879, 6). The text is preceded by a lengthy and well-informed introduction based on wide scholarly reading and offering an alert examination of the issues that have continued to preoccupy Cidian scholars. The work is dedicated to the eminent Spanish scholar Gayangos.<br>
<br>In 1885 Ormsby's four-volume translation of <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span> appeared, rounded off with annotated bibliographies of Spanish romances of chivalry and of editions and translations of the <span class="italic">Quixote</span>, where he displays his interests and learning as a literary scholar, and finally with a list of the proverbs contained in that work. U. R. Burke acknowledged his indebtedness to this list in the third edition (p. viii) of his own <span class="italic">Sancho Panza's Proverbs</span> (1892). He also rightly judged Ormsby's translation of the <span class="italic">Quixote</span> to be the best to have been produced in English, an estimate that may be held to remain valid down to the 1990s. The translation is introduced by a discerning evaluation of earlier English versions, an account of Cervantes' life that seeks &#145;to separate what is a matter of fact from what is a matter of conjecture&#146;, and a literary examination of the work itself, written in vigorous reaction against the Romantic idealization of Don Quixote (including &#145;Byron's melodious nonsense&#146; on the subject) that represents a highly perceptive and in some respects remarkable contribution in its time to Cervantine criticism. According to Palau, the &#145;notable edition&#146; of the <span class="italic">Quixote</span> in Spanish published at Edinburgh and London in 1898&#150;9 was the outcome of a scholarly collaboration between Ormsby and Fitzmaurice-Kelly. The latter's edition of 1901 uses Ormsby's 1885 translation as revised in Ormsby's own MS annotations; Fitzmaurice-Kelly comments that &#145;I have known no man who was a sterner critic of himself and of his own writings&#146;  (Cervantes, <span class="italic">Don Quixote</span>, 1.xxxvi). Ormsby lived out his later years much isolated by deafness and died, unmarried, at 19 Nelson Crescent, Ramsgate on 30 October 1895.<br>
