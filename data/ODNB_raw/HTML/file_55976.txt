<span class="headword">Vynne,  Eleanora Mary Susanna <span class="st"> [Nora]</span></span>  (1857&#150;1914), <span class="occ">journalist and political activist</span>, was born at 2 Caroline Cottages, St Ann's Road, Kennington, Surrey, on 31 October 1857, the youngest of three daughters of Charles Vynne (1826/7&#150;1881), accountant, and his wife, Sarah Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clarke (1831/2&#150;1896). The Vynnes were an old Norfolk family, corn merchants based around Swaffham and Narborough, many of whom became active members of the Baptist church. They joined forces with another local Baptist family, the Everetts, and Vynne and Everett became a major agricultural supplier in the area.<br>
<br>During her childhood Nora's family moved to Rickerby, Cumberland, where her father managed a company that manufactured fertilizer. She was educated at home and her youthful artistic talent won her prizes, but she started her working life as a teacher in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire. When her father died she moved to London and immediately started contributing to a variety of newspapers and magazines, including <span class="italic">The Speaker</span>, <span class="italic">Sketch</span>, <span class="italic">Gentlewoman</span>, and <span class="italic">Winter's Weekly</span>. She published her first volume of short stories at the age of twenty-three. <span class="italic">The Blind Artist's Pictures</span> (1893) was dedicated to John Strange Winter, a pseudonym for Mrs Arthur Stannard (Henrietta Stannard), founding editor of <span class="italic">Winter's Weekly</span>, &#145;to whose kindly help and encouragement&#146; Vynne said she owed much. Winter, who was the influential president of the Writer's Club in Fleet Street, published Vynne's stories in her first issues, including one on the front cover with a portrait of the author.<br>
<br>This book was an immediate success and won Vynne excellent reviews. J. M. Barrie described the short stories as the best he had ever read. A year later she published a second collection, <span class="italic">Honey of Aloes and Other Stories</span>, and in 1895 brought out her first full-length novel, <span class="italic">A Man and his Womankind</span>, a story of three women, including a journalist, who sacrifice their own lives to protect one man.<br>
<br>In September 1896 Vynne initiated a postal school of journalism, which ran until January 1898, in the columns of <span class="italic">Atalanta</span>. For 10<i>s</i>. a year subscribers were entitled to compete in monthly competitions and have their efforts criticized by Miss Vynne, who directed their studies and gave practical advice and counselling. This included a warning to women against &#145;indulging your own emotion instead of rousing the emotion of your readers&#146;. But she also advised &#145;spelling need not trouble you, compositors can all spell&#146;. Prize winners of the school were awarded an Oxford scholarship of &pound;20.<br>
<br>By 1900 Vynne was contributing articles to a variety of journals and giving lectures, and her growing reputation as a feminist and political writer led to her being invited in 1903 by the Committee of the Freedom of Labour Defence to write, with Helen Blackburn, <span class="italic">Women under the Factory Act</span>. In it she advised women to stick to the law in case employers decided to hire fewer women, but added:<blockquote>lest their obedience to law should be mistaken for approval of it, let all women who find restrictions cause them loss or inconvenience and all women who claim to enjoy the liberty men would certainly refuse to give up&#151;namely the liberty to earn extra money&#151;consult with each other and lodge protests.</blockquote>Vynne worked for the weekly tabloid <span class="italic">Women's Tribune</span> from its first issue in May 1906, writing chiefly about homeworking and the sweated industries, until it folded later that year. Within two months she had resurrected the paper under a new title&#151;<span class="italic">Women and Progress</span>&#151;and become joint editor with Lady Frances Balfour. Both papers were based on the assumption that all intelligent, tax-paying women desired equal rights of citizenship with male citizens, but they were not primarily suffrage journals: housing reform, temperance reform, and poor-law reform were all considered urgent needs as well. Vynne urged moderation in demanding the suffrage, arguing that an age limit was acceptable as long as it was the same for both sexes. Girls who should forfeit the right to vote included those &#145;who have been found guilty of any fraud or dishonesty, cruelty, or neglect of responsibilities voluntarily undertaken&#146;  (<span class="italic">Women and Progress</span>, 2 Nov 1906). Vynne herself described the paper as &#145;a high-class women's journal dealing with all the questions of the day and chronicling, impartially, all women's movements&#146;. It lasted until June 1914, when it ran out of funds, ironically just as circulation was rising, advertisements coming in, and many of her readers promising to help by becoming shareholders.<br>
<br>Vynne wrote a number of other books: <span class="italic">The Pieces of Silver</span> (1911); a light romance entitled <span class="italic">So it is with the Damsel</span> (1913); <span class="italic">The Priest's Marriage</span> (1899; repr. 1911); and a series of one-act plays which were put on in the provinces, as well as a five-act play produced by the Play Actors. She was a member of the Institute of Journalists and the Society of Women Journalists as well as the Writer's Club, where on one occasion a fellow member described her short stories as &#145;brilliant&#146;  (White). She never married. As she became established as a writer she considerably understated her age, and was wrongly believed to be forty-four at the time of her death, which took place on 18 February 1914 at 3 Cambridge Lodge Villas, Mare Street, Hackney, London, from breast cancer.<br>
