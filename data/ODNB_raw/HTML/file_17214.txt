<span class="headword">Lushington, Sir  Stephen</span>  (1803&#150;1877), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, second son of Sir Henry Lushington, second baronet (1775&#150;1863), who was consul-general at Naples, 1815&#150;32, and his wife, Fanny Maria (<i>d</i>. 26 May 1862), eldest daughter of Matthew Lewis, under-secretary at war, was born at Bedford Square, London, on 12 December 1803. Dr Stephen Lushington (1782&#150;1873) was his uncle. He entered the navy in October 1816 on the frigate <i>Tagus</i> (Captain James Whitley Deans Dundas) in the Mediterranean. From 1817 to 1821 he was with the Hon. Robert Cavendish Spencer in the <i>Ganymede</i> and <i>Owen Glendower</i> on the Mediterranean and South American stations. He was afterwards in the <i>Hind</i>, also in the Mediterranean, with the Hon. Henry John Rous, and in her boats was employed in suppressing piracy in the Greek archipelago until promoted lieutenant on 13 July 1824. In 1825 he was lieutenant of the sloop <i>Zebra</i>, and in 1826&#150;7 of the frigate <i>Cambrian</i>, in which he was present at the battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827. Three days later he was moved by Sir Edward Codrington into his flagship, the <i>Asia</i>, from which, on 13 May 1828, he was promoted to command the bomb-vessel <i>Aetna</i>. In her he had a distinguished part in the capture of Kastro Morea on 30 October 1828, for which he was especially complimented by the French admiral in command and was nominated a knight of the orders of St Louis and the Redeemer of Greece.<br>
<br>On 28 October 1829 Lushington was promoted captain, but had no employment until 19 January 1839, when he was appointed to the <i>Cleopatra</i> (26 guns), fitting for the West Indies. His health broke down, and after a long illness he was invalided home in November 1840. He married in 1841 Henrietta (<i>d</i>. 22 Sept 1875), eldest daughter of Rear-Admiral Henry Prescott; they had two daughters. In 1845&#150;6 Lushington commanded the steam frigate <i>Retribution</i> on the home station, and in 1847&#150;8 the <i>Vengeance</i> (84 guns) on the home station and in the Mediterranean. From November 1848 to March 1852 he was superintendent of the Indian navy. In July 1852 he commissioned the <i>Albion</i> for service in the Mediterranean, and was still in her when the Crimean War broke out in 1854.<br>
<br>At the beginning of the siege of Sevastopol, Lushington was landed in command of the naval brigade, with the services of which his name was throughout most closely associated. He was promoted rear-admiral on 4 July 1855, was nominated a KCB the following day, was made an officer and a commander of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and was awarded the order of the Mejidiye (second class). From May 1862 to December 1865 he was lieutenant-governor of the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich. On resigning he was promoted vice-admiral (1 October 1865), placed on the list according to his original seniority, between April and October 1862. On 2 December 1865 he was made admiral, and on 13 March 1867 a GCB. He died at Oak Lodge, Thornton Heath, Surrey, on 28 May 1877.<br>
