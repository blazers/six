<span class="headword">Monsell <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>O'Brien]</span>,  Harriet</span>  (1811&#150;1883), <span class="occ">founder of the Community of St John Baptist, Clewer</span>, was seventh of the nine children of Sir Edward O'Brien, fourth baronet, of Dromoland in co. Clare, and his wife, Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith, whose father was an attorney. She had three sisters and five brothers, one of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20471/', "William Smith O'Brien MP (1803&#150;1864)")</script>. Like her sisters, she was educated at home by governesses. Following the death of her father in 1837, she married on 21 September 1839 Charles Monsell, third son of the Revd Thomas Bewley Monsell, archdeacon of Derry and rector of Dunboe, and subsequently accompanied her husband to Oxford, where he studied for ordination. Here they were influenced by the Tractarian movement, Dr Pusey becoming a friend. Six years after his ordination Charles Monsell developed consumption, and he and Harriet left Ireland for Italy, where he was to recuperate. While there a friendship with William and Catherine Gladstone flourished, which continued throughout Harriet's life. Charles died in Naples on 20 January 1851, aged thirty-four; Harriet was forty.<br>
<br>A devout woman, Harriet Monsell dedicated her life to God's service at Charles's deathbed, and on returning to England she became companion to her invalid sister Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1865), whose husband the Revd Charles Amyand Harris was a curate in the parish of Clewer. With the support of the rector of Clewer, Thomas Thellusson Carter, Mariquita Tennant had founded in 1849, in the nearby garrison town of Windsor, the Clewer House of Mercy for women seeking moral refuge, but early in 1851 ill health had forced her retirement. Here Harriet Monsell saw her vocation. With Carter she refounded the House of Mercy as a sisterhood dedicated to rescue work. She was clothed as a Sister of Mercy on Ascension day, 29 May 1851&#151;the only member of the sisterhood. Two others soon joined and on 30 November 1852 she was installed as mother superior. The Community of St John Baptist grew rapidly, numbering 200 sisters by the time of her death in 1883. The work came to include orphanages, hospitals, schools, and parish missions in many places, including America and India.<br>
<br>With Carter as warden, Harriet Monsell as mother superior, and Samuel Wilberforce, bishop of Oxford, as visitor, the community developed along soundly Anglican lines. Harriet Monsell's personality drew women to Clewer, many of whom were from titled backgrounds (as indeed was she, having been granted the courtesy title &#145;the Honourable&#146; in 1862). Henry Woodyer's vast Gothic revival buildings which arose between 1855 and 1881 were a testimony to the growing importance of sisterhoods in the church. During her twenty-five years as superior Harriet Monsell grew in stature: her counsel was available to all at Clewer, both sisters and women in the penitentiary, and her opinion was sought and respected by churchmen at all levels, including Gladstone (who referred many &#145;rescue&#146; cases to Clewer), Lord Addington (whose daughter joined the community), and Dr J. M. Neale. She was also widely consulted by those founding other communities. She was cousin by marriage to Archbishop Tait, whose friendship she cherished and whom she admonished more than once for his treatment of high-church clergy. In 1864 Queen Victoria made a private visit to the House of Mercy and was impressed with all she saw, confiding to her journal (6 July 1864) that &#145;Mrs Monsell the Mother Superior is an excellent person&#146;. At a time when sisterhoods were still controversial, Harriet Monsell did much to allay suspicion and win respect.<br>
<br>Age brought increasing ill health, and in 1875 Harriet Monsell resigned as superior and retired to Folkestone, where the sisters had work and where her interest in the community continued. She died peacefully on 25 March (Easter Sunday) 1883 and was buried at Folkestone on 30 March. St Saviour's, Folkestone, a mission church in which she had shown great interest, was eventually completed as her living memorial.<br>
