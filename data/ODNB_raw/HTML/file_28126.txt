<span class="headword">Vaughan <span class="st"> [Fychan]</span>,  Edward</span>  (early 1450s&#150;1522/3), <span class="occ">bishop of St David's</span>, was almost certainly a Welshman, born somewhere in south Wales in the early 1450s. His parentage is unknown. He was educated at Cambridge University, where he was admitted as bachelor of canon law in either 1474 or 1475, and he incepted as doctor of canon law in 1482. He may have stayed on at Cambridge or returned home for a time, for it was not until 1487 that he received his first known preferment, as rector of St Matthew's Church, Friday Street, London, and portioner in the church of St Probus, Cornwall. These were granted presumably in anticipation of his ordination as subdeacon on 1 March, deacon on 22 March, and priest on 5 April 1488. He was made archdeacon of Lewes, Chichester diocese, in the same year. His clerical preferment, mainly in the dioceses of London and Chichester, has been fully recorded by A. B. Emden and in Le Neve's <span class="italic">Fasti ecclesiae Anglicanae</span>. He had already held prebends in St Paul's Cathedral when he was rewarded with the lucrative and prestigious office of treasurer there, together with its prebend of Broomesbury, in 1503. In London he gained a reputation for generosity and public spirit, building a house there for his successors and distributing 500 marks to the poor in time of dearth. In 1504 he became precentor of Abergwili and prebendary of Llanbister.<br>
<br>Vaughan was appointed bishop of St David's by papal provision on 13 July 1509 and consecrated by Archbishop Warham on 22 July the same year. He brought down to St David's, to act as choirmaster, a talented English organist and composer, John Norman, some of whose music has survived. By experience a careful manager, he commissioned a new copy of the <span class="roman">Black Book of St David's</span> (a fourteenth-century survey of the episcopal estates) in 1516, and in 1517 he renewed the appropriation of the church of Llansanffraid, Cardiganshire, to the vicars-choral to help them repair and maintain their houses within the close.<br>
<br>At St David's, however, Vaughan's reputation rests chiefly and securely on his building work. John Leland, who had visited St David's within two decades of the bishop's death, records that he built the chapel of Holy Trinity, the chapel of St Justinian, and the great barn at Lamphey, and that he repaired the castle of Llawhaden and built a new chapel there. Later authorities have attributed to him other building work at his palace at Lamphey, including the chapel, where a perpendicular-style east window has survived. At the cathedral he was responsible for the roof of the lady chapel and its ante-chapel, the south porch, and the third stage of the tower, although neither of the two latter, as W. Basil Jones caustically remarked, &#145;would confer immortality on his taste in architecture&#146;  (Jones and Freeman, 309). This was to be expected, for the diocese was in a depressed state and the money was just not available for lavish, large-scale reparations&#151;witness the long list of tax exemptions that the bishop recorded in his register for 1513 and 1517 to religious houses and churches that had been &#145;diminished, impoverished and destroyed by wars, fires, inundations of rivers and other misfortunes and chances&#146;  (Isaacson, 2.790&#150;803, 818&#150;27). Holy Trinity chapel, however, with its fine ashlar finish and fan vaulting, remains one of the glories of the cathedral. It was constructed in an empty, enclosed, roofless space east of the presbytery, an area described by George Owen as &#145;the most vile and filthy place in the whole church&#146;  (Robson, 58). Built at the bishop's own expense, it was designed to be his resting-place and chantry chapel. It has been acclaimed as &#145;one of the finest pieces of Perpendicular work in the Principality&#146;  (Williams, 433). The same high-quality work can be seen in the traceried east window of the chapel at Lamphey Palace where the bishop seems to have spent his retirement. Here he rationalized the building of the palace in an attempt, as C. A. Ralegh Radford argued, &#145;to concentrate the life of the palace in one block and under one roof, abandoning the extensive establishment laid out in the more spacious days of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries&#146;  (Radford, 12).<br>
<br>Vaughan died in late 1522 or early 1523 (certainly before 27 January 1523 when his will, dated 20 May 1521, was proved), and was buried in Holy Trinity chapel where, in Browne Willis's day, a brass memorial was still attached to his marble grave marker, lauding him as a supporter and ornament of his country who had managed and augmented the talents that God had given him skilfully, wisely, and well. He left numerous bequests to religious houses within his diocese and the large sum of &pound;40 for a priest to sing masses for six years to secure the repose of his soul.<br>
