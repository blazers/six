<span class="headword">McComb,  William</span>  (1793&#150;1873), <span class="occ">poet</span>, son of Thomas McComb, a draper, was born at Coleraine, co. Londonderry, on 17 August 1793. His mother's surname was Foster. After receiving an elementary education in his native town, he was apprenticed to Thomas O'Neill, a Belfast wholesale draper, but after a short time left him, and, after training with the Kildare Place Society, Dublin, became a teacher of Brown Street daily school in Belfast.<br>
<br>In 1816 McComb married Sarah Johnson of Hillsborough, Belfast, and a year later published <span class="italic">The Dirge of O'Neill and other Poems</span> in Belfast. The collection commemorated Arthur O'Neill, a blind harpist considered the last of the Irish itinerant bards, who had died in co. Armagh the previous year. One of the poems, &#145;O Erin my country! although thy harp slumbers&#146; became particularly popular. McComb followed this moderate success with <span class="italic">The School of the Sabbath</span> in 1822, a long poem &#145;adapted to inspire pity for the ignorant poor, and augmented energy for the promotion of Sunday Schools&#146;  (McComb, 402).<br>
<br>In 1827 McComb's wife, Sarah, died, and he abandoned teaching to start business as a bookseller in High Street, Belfast. In 1830 he married Eliza Barkley, the widow of Captain Robert Walkinshaw Campbell of Belfast, and the couple had several children. In 1840 he established <span class="italic">McComb's Presbyterian Almanac</span>, which became a highly popular annual in the north of Ireland. He took a deep interest in many of the charitable institutions of Belfast, and was one of the founders and the first treasurer of the Ulster Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Voice of a Year, or, Recollections of 1848</span>, McComb's third collection of poems, appeared in 1849. &#145;Its theme is Revolution&#146; remarked the <span class="italic">Belfast News-Letter</span>, &#145;and its moral the guilt and misery of attempting to change the institutions of a nation by the prowess of the popular sword, instead of the power of popular opinion&#146;  (McComb, 420).<br>
<br>In 1864 McComb retired from business, and later that year published a collected edition of his poetry, <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span>, to much acclaim from the protestant and unionist press. The <span class="italic">Belfast Protestant Journal</span> claimed &#145;Mr McComb's reputation as a poet is not local, but national&#146;, and compared him to Thomas Moore  (McComb, 404). McComb's &#145;national&#146; appeal was, however, limited by his virulent anti-Catholicism, demonstrable in lines from <span class="italic">The Voice of a Year</span> such as:<blockquote>
<div>Princes and Potentates from thrones were hurled<br>
</div>
<div>Wherever haughty Rome her blood-red flag unfurled<br>
</div> (stanza 41)</blockquote>and &#145;Antichrist, arrayed in papal power&#146;  (stanza 42). On 13 September 1873 McComb died at home, in Colin View Terrace, Belfast. He was interred in Hillsborough churchyard.<br>
