<span class="headword">Clarke, Sir  Richard William Barnes</span>  (1910&#150;1975), <span class="occ">journalist and civil servant</span>, was born in Heanor, Derbyshire, on 13 August 1910, the second child and only son of William Thomas Clarke, chemistry master of the grammar school in Heanor, and his wife, Helen Barnes, also a schoolteacher. Clarke, known throughout his life to his family and friends as Otto, was educated at Christ's Hospital, Horsham, and at Clare College, Cambridge, where he read mathematics and was posted sixth wrangler in 1931; he finally switched to economics in his fourth year and received a second class in part two of the economics tripos in 1932. Then, at the nadir of the depression, came the arduous search for a job. A brief spell (1932&#150;3) with the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association was followed by six years at the <span class="italic">Financial News</span>, later amalgamated with the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, where his most lasting achievement was to devise the ordinary share index&#151;still, as the FT index, the principal measure of its kind. On the outbreak of the Second World War he moved successively through the ministries of Information, Economic Warfare, Supply, and Production, and spent a vital year (1942&#150;3) in Washington in the combined production and resources board.<br>
<br>Clarke's main career as a civil servant can be said to have begun when, in 1945, he joined the Treasury, where he remained for the next twenty-one years. During this time two periods stand out as those in which his contribution was outstanding and of lasting importance. The first was between 1946 and 1952, when he chaired the official programmes committee, the group saddled with the task of wrestling with the management of what became and remained for many years Britain's central economic problem, the chronic tendency to deficit of the United Kingdom's balance of payments. As chairman of the programmes committee he dominated a large group of senior and sophisticated officials, drawn from all government departments, in the preparation for ministers of a unique series of reports. No one who was a member of that body will forget his methods of working, his ability to draft papers while presiding as chairman, his fluency and command of facts and figures. His work on the planning of both the United Kingdom and the whole European response to the Marshall plan, which constituted the key to the salvation of western Europe after the war, was unequalled.<br>
<br>The second of the two periods was the eight years from 1958 to Clarke's departure from the Treasury in 1966. During this time, while holding a number of jobs, which culminated in 1962 with his appointment as second permanent secretary in charge of the public sector group, he more or less single-handedly succeeded in securing the adoption of an entirely new approach to control and management of public expenditure; this was known as PESC, an acronym for the public expenditure survey committee, the inter-departmental instrument employed for administering the new system. It was Clarke who formulated the central ideas contained in the 1961 report of the committee of inquiry into Treasury control of public expenditure chaired by Lord Plowden, which he himself largely drafted. This advocated taking a view of the public sector as a whole&#151;embracing central government, local government, and the public corporations&#151;and the need to look at its progress over time against a background of the development of the national economy. These were seemingly simple ideas but new and indeed revolutionary in their implications. The control system that Clarke advocated and pioneered must be regarded as the principal monument by which he will be remembered.<br>
<br>Clarke always took the architectonic rather than the piecemeal approach to his responsibilities. Thus he regarded the new Ministry of Technology, of which he was permanent secretary from 1966 to 1970 (having been for a short while previously permanent secretary in the Ministry of Aviation) and which expanded greatly in size and scope while he was its official head, as a model for the group of super-departments that he saw as the principal instruments of executive government in the future. This prediction has been only partially fulfilled. Some departments have survived but others, including the Ministry of Technology itself, have disintegrated, their component parts absorbed elsewhere. It could be that Clarke underestimated the difficulties, political, administrative, and indeed human, of holding together such vast conglomerates.<br>
<br>Clarke married on 25 November 1938, in the United States, Joan Edith Barrington Simeon. The marriage was dissolved on 16 November 1945, and in 1950 he married Brenda Pile, daughter of W. J. Skinner of Frosterley, Bishop Auckland. She had represented the Ministry of Transport in the heroic days of the programmes committee and the marriage was outstandingly happy; they had three sons.<br>
<br>Clarke was a man of many parts. He was a first-class chess player and a leading figure in the higher management of British chess. Physically commanding, intellectually pre-eminent, a strong character of decided and passionately held views, he was ruthless in argument and impatient with those who did not share his own convictions and approach to the matter in hand. Clarke's exceptional numeracy also led him to a low opinion of colleagues whose mental arithmetic did not go beyond their twelve-times table. His own writings, particularly in reports to ministers, were interspersed with figures, always relevant, employed to devastating effect in conjunction with a staccato style, the sentences coming at the reader like a succession of pistol shots.<br>
<br>Clarke was appointed OBE in 1944, CB in 1951, and KCB in 1964. Following his retirement from the civil service in 1971 he accepted directorships in a number of large companies, both in industry and finance, where all testified to his deep concern, his detailed knowledge and understanding, and his qualities of judgement.<br>
<br>Not surprisingly for one of his literary talents Clarke's published work was extensive. He wrote numerous articles in learned journals; his more substantial works included <span class="italic">The Socialisation of Iron and Steel</span> (1936), under the pseudonym Ingot, <span class="italic">The Economic Effort of War</span> (1940), <span class="italic">The Management of the Public Sector of the National Economy</span> (the Stamp memorial lecture, 1964), <span class="italic">New Trends in Government</span> (1971), and <span class="italic">Public Expenditure, Management and Control</span> (1978), a posthumously published work meticulously edited by his friend and colleague Sir Alexander Cairncross, which provided fascinating insights into the deeper recesses of the governmental machine.<br>
<br>Clarke died in University College Hospital, London, on 21 June 1975 and was cremated at Golders Green three days later. He was survived by his wife.<br>
