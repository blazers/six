<span class="headword">Powell <span class="st"> [Renaud]</span>,  Jane</span>  (<em>c.</em>1761&#150;1831), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born about 1761. Conflicting stories in contemporary biographies describe her birth in Cranbrook, Kent, and her early life as a series of amorous adventures. Whatever the truth of these she made her first appearance at the Haymarket as Alicia in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>, on 29 August 1788. The following day's <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> identified her as Mrs Farmer, while the <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span> gave her name as Miss Palmer. From the Haymarket she went to Drury Lane in the autumn of 1788. Appearing there as Mrs Farmer, she played Anne Bullen to the Queen Katharine of Sarah Siddons, Virgilia in <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span>, and Leonora in Edward Young's <span class="italic">The Revenge</span>.<br>
<br>During the summer of 1789 she performed in Liverpool, where she married William Powell (1762&#150;1812), a prompter there and at Drury Lane; the two returned to London, where Jane Powell retained her engagement with the Drury Lane company until 1811. As the primary support for Sarah Siddons, her forte lay in heavy and intense tragedy. Among many others, her roles included Andromache in <span class="italic">The Distrest Mother</span>, Mrs Haller in <span class="italic">The Stranger</span>, and Almeria in <span class="italic">The Mourning Bride</span>. When Siddons refused to play Edmunda in Ireland's Shakespearian counterfeit <span class="italic">Vortigern</span>, Powell took the part (2 April 1796). That season she performed Hamlet for her benefit to Dorothy Jordan's Ophelia, and garnered some praise. In addition, she created Matilda in <span class="italic">The Curfew</span> and the title role in <span class="italic">Adelgitha</span>. In the <span class="italic">Dramatic Mirror</span>, Thomas Gilliland described her as &#145;majestically beautiful&#146;, with &#145;a full mellow-toned voice&#146;. He further complimented her brilliant conversation and engaging manner, and mentioned that she had a country house at Norwood. A critic for the <span class="italic">Thespian Dictionary</span> (1805) and other commentators noted her usefulness to the theatre and her tall and elegant figure.<br>
<br>Some time before 1808, Jane Powell separated amicably from her husband. Following his death in 1812, she married John James Renaud (<i>d</i>. 1834), a provincial actor, on 31 January 1813 at St George's, Bloomsbury. They were soon separated, but she continued to perform using his name after 1814.<br>
<br>After travelling for two years in the provinces, Jane Renaud settled in 1818 in Edinburgh, where she had previously acted in the summer of 1802. The parts for which she was chiefly cast were the same intense roles she had made her own in the capital: Meg Merrilies in <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span>, Lady Macbeth, Gertrude in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, and Belvidera in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>. The parts she created in Edinburgh included Helen Macgregor in <span class="italic">Rob Roy</span>, the Queen in <span class="italic">The Heart of Midlothian</span>, Elspat in <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span>, Lady Douglas in <span class="italic">Mary Stuart</span>, and Janet in <span class="italic">The Twa Drovers</span>. She was credited with providing splendid support to Edmund Kean and other great London tragedians who made starring visits to the Scottish capital.<br>
<br>Jane Renaud displayed in her old age a rare dignity of bearing, correct elocution, and a telling voice, although she became increasingly incapacitated. She appeared for the last time on 30 September 1829, when she acted Gertrude to Kean's Hamlet. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> reported that her Edinburgh manager continued to pay her 2 guineas a week until her death, which occurred in London, on 31 December 1831, when she was &#145;aged about 70&#146;.<br>
