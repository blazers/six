<span class="headword">Cross,  Frank Leslie</span>  (1900&#150;1968), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and patristic scholar</span>, was born on 22 January 1900 at home in the High Street, Honiton, Devon, the eldest of three children of Herbert Francis Cross (1868&#150;1957), a pharmacist, and his wife, Louisa Georgina (1869&#150;1946), daughter of William Joseph Randall. His father sold his pharmacy and retired to Bournemouth in 1911. Cross attended Allhallow's School, Honiton (1908&#150;11), and then Bournemouth School (1911&#150;17), from where he won the domus scholarship for natural science at Balliol College, Oxford. After war service, he read the honour school of chemistry, in 1920 obtaining honours in part one with crystallography. He then switched to theology, in which he took a first in 1922. Winning the senior Denyer and Johnson prize enabled him to spend two years in Marburg and Freiburg working on a thesis on Husserl. In 1925 he was ordained deacon to the title of tutor and chaplain of Ripon Hall (priest in 1926). In 1927 he was invited to become a priest&#150;librarian at Pusey House. For a time he combined this office with that of chaplain of Ripon Hall, apparently unworried by differences in churchmanship. He was appointed university lecturer in the philosophy of religion in 1934 and from 1935 to 1938 he was also Wilde lecturer in natural and comparative religion. In 1944 he was elected Lady Margaret professor of divinity. To this chair was attached a canonry in Christ Church and a large house. He tried to persuade the principal of Mirfield College to set up a theological college in the house. After the death of his mother, his father and younger sister came to live there, but he continued to provide cheap lodging for pious students.<br>
<br>Cross's first book was <span class="italic">Religion and the Reign of Science</span> (1930), but his main interest gradually moved from the philosophy of religion to the church fathers. In 1933 he published a study of J. H. Newman; in 1935 (with P. E. More) a collection of extracts from the works of seventeenth-century Anglican divines; and in 1939 a students' edition of Athanasius's <span class="italic">De incarnatione</span>. On the death of Darwell Stone in 1941 he took over for five years the editorship of the future <span class="italic">Patristic Greek Lexicon</span> and wrote a life of Stone (1943). He produced an edition, with English translation, of Cyril of Jerusalem's <span class="italic">Lectures on the Christian Sacraments</span> (1951). He had meanwhile embarked on the book eventually to be published in 1957 as <span class="italic">The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church</span>. This quickly became a standard work of reference. It was formally commissioned by Geoffrey Cumberlege in 1939, but the diaries of Tom Parker (at one time co-editor) suggest that work had begun earlier and that from the start Cross's enthusiasm was the driving force. The final shape was certainly due to his persistence. He wrote many of the entries himself and those he commissioned from others were nearly all reworked by him to give the book uniformity of style. His wide interests and enthusiasms led him to turn from one project to another. The book on Athanasius foreshadowed in his inaugural lecture was never written, and his main contribution to scholarship in the narrower sense lay in articles which drew attention to things which were obvious once they had been pointed out. He had a keen sense of how people behave. Thus he saw how the second recension of Dionysius Exiguus's <span class="italic">Codex canonum</span> had conflated material from different councils of Carthage and by sorting out the documents in a pioneer article  (<span class="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</span>, new ser., 12, 1961, 227&#150;47) he made sense of the history of the African councils from 393 to 419. Similarly, he recognized the difference in character between literary and liturgical manuscripts, comparing the latter to timetables compiled for practical use, not to preserve an archetype  (<span class="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</span>, new ser., 16, 1965, 61&#150;7). He had taken the degrees of DPhil in 1930 and DD in 1950 and in 1967 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy.<br>
<br>At the end of the Second World War, Cross was involved in re-establishing contact with German Christians. He went to Germany and invited German academics to Oxford, arranging seminars and lectures. When Patrick McLaughlin suggested to him that a gathering of scholars interested in the period before the division of Christendom into East and West would foster reunion, he readily agreed to convene such a meeting. The first international conference on patristic studies took place in 1951, to be followed by five others in Cross's lifetime. He arranged publication of their proceedings in <span class="italic">Texte und Untersuchungen</span>, helping many to get their first works in print. A parallel concern to bridge the gap between academic theologians and the parish clergy led to conferences called &#145;Theology and ministry&#146; which developed into international congresses on <span class="roman">New Testament</span> studies held in the years between patristic conferences. Towards the end of his life he arranged conferences for members of religious orders, both active and enclosed.<br>
<br>Intensely shy, Cross was known for his silence. His lectures and sermons were painful. He found social contact difficult, but once the initial barrier was penetrated, his sincerity and goodwill were so apparent that he inspired devotion, and he had a great capacity for persuading people to do things. He was diligent both in work and worship; as a canon he attended every office in the cathedral when he was in Christ Church, and laid on extra services in term time. He was a frequent visitor of religious houses at home and abroad. He was found dead on the morning of 30 December 1968 at the Priory House, Christ Church, Oxford, and his ashes were interred in the cathedral garth.<br>
