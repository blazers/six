<span class="headword">Creak,  Edith Elizabeth Maria</span>  (1855&#150;1919), <span class="occ">headmistress</span>, was born on 26 July 1855 at 118 Lansdowne Place, Hove, Sussex, daughter of Albert Creak, an early graduate of London University, nonconformist minister and successful proprietor of a boys' school in Hove. Her mother was Bertha Creak (formerly Shelly). After a thorough education in her father's school, Edith Creak took the Cambridge higher local examination, set up in 1869 for women intending to teach. Having won a scholarship established by John Stuart Mill and Helen Taylor she was enabled, at only sixteen, to register in 1871 as one of the first five students at what became Newnham College, Cambridge. Although taking a second-class honours in classics and a third in mathematics in 1875, as a woman she was not eligible for a Cambridge degree. In 1878, 1879, and 1880 respectively, she took honours in the London University general examination for women, gained a first class in the intermediate examination, and was in the first batch of women admitted to the London degree.<br>
<br>In teaching, Edith Creak was equally a pioneer. Having been an assistant mistress at Plymouth high school from 1875 to 1876, she was appointed, at the age of only twenty, headmistress of the new Brighton High School for Girls, the tenth school founded by the Girls' Public Day School Company. She appointed the staff and organized the school, which opened in June 1876. Gifted, plump, and jolly, she apparently inspired &#145;lively enthusiasm and sound scholarship&#146;, as she did at King Edward VI's High School for Girls in Birmingham, of which she became the first headmistress in 1883. She grew very proud of this ancient educational foundation which had broken new ground in 1880 by establishing an endowed high school for girls. Her highly praised role in the design and organization of new premises for the girls' high school illustrated her authority over her governors, her perception of the educational needs of her pupils, and her attention to their health. She secured cookery facilities despite the governors' misgivings over teaching domestic subjects in a high school, excellent science facilities, and all-in-one desks which could be adjusted so that the girls need neither stoop nor be uncomfortable.<br>
<br>Miss Creak admired Edward Thring, headmaster of Uppingham, whose conference of headmistresses she had attended in 1887, and emulated him in achieving discipline through pupils' self-respect and the internalization of the school ethos rather than by proliferating formal rules. Her school was known for its serene, quiet order: she was strict, but highly respected. She gave the senior girls in particular much responsibility for their own learning. Like Thring she stressed attention to all pupils whatever their abilities and, accordingly, catered for the development of practical skills, as her &#145;beautiful pendant&#146;, made and designed in 1910 by girls working in the jewellery section (the only girls' school to have one), illustrated. Keenly interested in all subjects, she stimulated a broad, liberal education.<br>
<br>A Congregationalist and deeply religious, Miss Creak was a pioneer in religious education, but it was in science that King Edward's was outstanding. She appointed excellent science teachers, ensured the requisite facilities, and used the local expertise of Dr Crosskey and Mason College. In sport she was less adventurous, allowing gymnastics and tennis but not hockey. Rejecting the athleticism of boys' schools, she paid more attention to the principles of sound bodily health, including proper ventilation, heating, lighting, and sanitary arrangements. She also wanted annual medical inspections. Her dread of pupils overworking led her to issue timetables for homework and wish for an eight-hour bill for both them and staff. She was one of the first headteachers to stop examinations lower than matriculation, yet the school's academic standing steadily rose, and from the early days came a stream of academic distinctions at school and later university, particularly at Newnham and London, and especially in science. She was an associate of Newnham from 1893 to 1900 and she founded the Newnham College Club in Birmingham.<br>
<br>Miss Creak's generous gifts to the library and system of free hours there for the older girls, like her encouragement of art, music, drama, and debates, were a model of high school education for girls. She was, indeed, among a new breed of headmistresses who developed girls' secondary schools with classical ideals of academic excellence and self-realization through public service. In many ways she exemplified the new professionalism of women graduate teachers in her relationships with staff, governors, and parents and in her membership of the Headmistresses Association. She was one of the headmistresses interviewed for the Bryce commission in 1894. In her written submission to this she voiced her particular concerns for the registration and proper training of secondary teachers, for keeping elementary education and secondary education strictly apart, and for closing higher-grade elementary schools.<br>
<br>In some respects, indeed, Miss Creak was quite conservative. Pleased personally with the new areas opening for women's energy and enterprise, she remained, none the less, sure that women's best sphere was in the home. In 1885 she had supported the <span class="roman">Women's Suffrage Bill</span>, but by the 1900s she was adamant in her opposition to both women's suffrage and the educational ladder which could take the poor to secondary education and university. Her patriotism in the South African War was strident, and her character, once humorous, sympathetic, and full of <i>joie de vivre</i>, became irritable, dictatorial, and abrupt as her health deteriorated. This and her lack of adaptability eventually led to her resignation in 1910. Nevertheless, at her best she was clear-sighted, courageous, patient, and innovative, and wielded natural authority. She had wide and keen interests including classics, botany, mountaineering, art, needlework, lace-making, and collecting alpine flowers, which she grew in her beloved garden at Barnt. Edith Creak died at her home, 55 Hagley Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 20 May 1919.<br>
