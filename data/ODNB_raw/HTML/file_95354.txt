<span class="headword">Godolphin,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1663, <em>d.</em> 1726), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was baptized on 5 November 1663 at Coulston church, Wiltshire, the third of the five children of Francis Godolphin (1629&#150;1670) of Spargor and Coulston, and his wife, Elizabeth (1633&#150;1667), one of the four surviving daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10477/', "Sir John Gayer (bap. 1584, d. 1649)")</script>, a London merchant who was lord mayor in 1646, and his wife, Katharine, daughter of Sampson Hopkins of Coventry.<br>
<br>Elizabeth's mother died soon after giving birth to her youngest son, Charles, in 1667, and her two-year-old daughter, Anne, died in the same year. Her husband was married again in 1669, to Dame Elizabeth Mordaunt, widow of Sir Charles Mordaunt of Massingham Parva, but died only a year later. The bulk of Francis Godolphin's estate passed to his eldest son, William (1659&#150;1682). Elizabeth was provided with an annuity, and she and her brother Francis (1661&#150;1702) were placed in the guardianship of their uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10883/', "Sir William Godolphin (bap. 1635, d. 1696)")</script>. But with Sir William having taken up residence in Spain in 1669 as Charles II's ambassador there, the children were looked after by their elderly great-uncle Francis Bluet (<i>d</i>. 1678) and his wife, Elizabeth, and after their deaths by their eldest son. Elizabeth's brother William died following a duel in 1682. Francis succeeded to the estate but committed suicide in 1702, possibly under the strain of legal proceedings against his relatives. The Coulston house, built by Elizabeth's father with his own mother's dowry, was put in the hands of trustees made responsible for Elizabeth's dowry.<br>
<br>In 1687 Elizabeth married her cousin Charles Godolphin (1651&#150;1720), the fifth of the fourteen children of Sir Francis Godolphin (1605&#150;1667) and his wife, Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1668), daughter of Sir Henry Berkeley. The younger brother of Sidney Godolphin, first Earl Godophin (1645&#150;1712) and of Henry Godolphin (1648&#150;1733), dean of St Paul's, Charles was MP for Helston and became a senior commissioner for customs in London. He and Elizabeth bought a house in St James's Street, Piccadilly, in addition to the Coulston residence. Their marriage was happy but marred by the death of both their children, Anne (<i>bap</i>. 12 August 1688, <i>d</i>. 1690) and William (<i>bap</i>. 25 March 1694, <i>d</i>. May 1694). However, Charles's great-niece Frances (Fanny) Quicke, the granddaughter of his sister Elizabeth, Lady Northcote (<i>b</i>. 1635), became a surrogate daughter, living in London with Elizabeth and Charles until her marriage to Francis Hall, a commissioner for customs.<br>
<br>Elizabeth and Francis Godolphin were beneficiaries under the will of their uncle Sir William. The bulk of the latter's estate, valued at &pound;80,000, consisted of lands in Cornwall, chattels in Madrid (where he died), and money in Madrid, Rome, Amsterdam, and Venice. In his first will, of 1669, Sir William bequeathed his estate to charitable causes, in the second (1696) to the Jesuits, and in the third, after Francis visited him on his deathbed in Spain, to Francis and Elizabeth. When Francis and Elizabeth sought to claim the estate, the Jesuits petitioned parliament on 30 December 1697 to rescind the letters of administration granted to Francis and Elizabeth in November 1696; but a bill of 2 April 1698 recognized the claim of the charities endowed by Sir William and required Francis and Elizabeth to pay &pound;1520 each towards charitable purposes. Elizabeth was assigned &pound;4000 and her husband Charles &pound;1000.<br>
<br>Of the &pound;1520 to be devoted to good causes by Elizabeth under Sir William's will, Charles, acting on her behalf, gave &pound;500 to charities at Helston, Cornwall. He also bought land to the west of St James's Street on which houses were subsequently built, and in 1703 this was assigned to trustees for the education, maintenance, and apprenticing of poor scholars, for the relief of decayed gentlefolk, and for other charitable purposes. It continued to be used to these ends until the death of Elizabeth's nephew William in 1781, when the management of the trust was settled by proceedings in chancery. The charity commissioners appointed in 1819 were unable to obtain satisfactory accounts or information from the sole surviving trustee, Robert Long, and recommended that the case should be laid before the attorney-general. The result was a decree by the court of chancery in April 1852, establishing the Godolphin School at Hammersmith. It opened in 1856 in Great Church Lane, Hammersmith, under the Revd Henry Twells, but although initially successful it closed in 1900 in the face of competition from St Paul's (from 1884) and Latymer Upper School. However, a new scheme, drawn up in 1903 and supported by a grant from the Latymer Foundation, created the Godolphin and Latymer School for Girls, which is now an independent day school.<br>
<br>The portion of &pound;1520 that was to be devoted to charitable causes by Francis Godolphin was assigned after his death to the Godolphin School for Girls, founded at Salisbury by his sister Elizabeth. This separate charity, endowed from lands that she had bought in Somerset, was established to maintain and educate eight young orphan gentlewomen, whose parents were required to have been communicants of the Church of England. A prudent mistress was to be appointed to teach the girls to dance, work, read, write, cast accounts, and become proficient in housewifery. The foundation of the school occupied the six years that remained to Elizabeth after Charles's death on 10 July 1720. Neither the dean and chapter of Salisbury nor Samuel Clark, the rector of St James's, Westminster, in whose names Elizabeth wished the lands to be held and whom she wanted to direct the charity, was prepared to act as trustee, and so on 4 July 1721 the matter was placed before the court of chancery. William Godolphin's moneys vested in Venice had depreciated considerably and realized only &pound;3359 7<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. To this sum Elizabeth (who had met the costs of proceedings in chancery and other expenses out of her own pocket) added money left to her by Charles as well as some of her own, altogether realizing &pound;3890 0<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>., which she directed should be invested in government securities. But this sum still fell short of what was necessary to found the school. In her will, however, Elizabeth left still more money to bring the charitable funds up to &pound;5000, and entrusted the foundation of the school to her nephew William Godolphin (1694&#150;1781) and his heirs. The school opened on 9 August 1784 in Rosemary Lane, adjoining Salisbury Cathedral close. Elizabeth's heirs continued to approve the appointment of the mistress and nominate the pupils, until a new scheme for the Godolphin School in 1886 renegotiated the relationship between the trustees and Elizabeth's heirs to the former's satisfaction.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Godolphin died on 29 July 1726 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, alongside her husband and their children. A formidable, tough, and autocratic woman, renowned for her wit, she acted as arbitrator in family disputes but did not suffer fools gladly and could be a difficult neighbour, as her next-door neighbour Thomas Coke discovered when building his own house in St James's Street. Her tendency to sharpness is epitomized in her bequest to Fanny Hall, whom she made both her executor and her residuary legatee &#145;to her own particular separate and peculiar use and exclusive of her said Husband&#146;, with the specific condition that &#145;her said Husband is not to intermedle&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/610, fol. 202<i>v</i>). Her will, drawn up in 1724, and with a codicil dated 22 July 1725, was proved on 18 August 1726.<br>
