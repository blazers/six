<span class="headword">Terry,  Daniel</span>  (1789&#150;1829), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, was born in Bath and educated first at Bath grammar school and then at a private school at Wingfield, Wiltshire, under Revd Edward Spencer. For five years he was a pupil of the architect Samuel Wyatt, but, after acting the part of Heartwell in <span class="italic">The Prize</span> at Bath, Terry left him to join the company at Sheffield under the management of the elder Macready. His first appearance was as Tressel in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, and he went on to play Cromwell in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span> and Edmund in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>. Towards the close of 1805 he joined Stephen Kemble in the north of England. When Kemble's company broke up in 1806 he went to Liverpool. His success there recommended him to Henry Siddons, who brought him out in Edinburgh (29 November 1809) as Bertrand in William Dimond's <span class="italic">The Foundling of the Forest</span>.<br>
<br>At that period Terry's figure is said to have been well formed and graceful, his countenance powerfully expressive, and his voice strong, full, and clear, though not melodious. He is also credited with stage knowledge, energetic and appropriate action, good judgement, and an active mind. On 12 December 1809 he was Antigonus in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span>, on 8 January 1810 Prospero, and on 29 January Argyle in Joanna Baillie's <span class="italic">The Family Legend</span>. Scott, who contributed a prologue which Terry delivered, spoke well of this performance. On 22 November Terry played Falstaff in <span class="italic">Henry IV</span>. On 15 January 1811 he was the first Roderick Dhu in <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>, adapted by Edmund John Eyre; on 6 March he played Polonius; on the 18th he repeated Roderick Dhu in <span class="italic">The Knight of Snowdoun</span>, a second version, by Thomas Morton, of <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>, not much more prosperous than the former; and on the 23rd, for his benefit, was Falstaff in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>. He was Lord Ogleby in <span class="italic">The Clandestine Marriage</span> on 18 November 1811.<br>
<br>Terry made his first appearance in London in this part, at the Haymarket, on 20 May 1812. During that season he played Shylock, Job Thornberry, Sir Anthony Absolute, Major Sturgeon in <span class="italic">The Major of Garratt</span>, Dr Pangloss in <span class="italic">The Heir-at-Law</span>, Don Caesar in <span class="italic">A Bold Stroke for a Husband</span>, Megrim in <span class="italic">Blue Devils</span>, Harmony in <span class="italic">Everyone has his Fault</span>, Sir Edward Mortimer in <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span>, Leon in <span class="italic">Rule a Wife and have a Wife</span>, Gradus in <span class="italic">Who's the Dupe?</span>, Romaldi in <span class="italic">The Tale of Mystery</span>, Barford in <span class="italic">Who Wants a Guinea?</span>, Selico in <span class="italic">The Africans</span>, Heartall in <span class="italic">The Soldier's Daughter</span>, Bustleton in <span class="italic">Manager in Distress</span>, Octavian, and Iago&#151;a remarkable list for a first season. He created some original characters in unimportant plays, the only part of note being Count Salerno in Eyre's <span class="italic">Look at Home</span> (15 August 1812), founded on Moore's <span class="italic">Zeluco</span>. Terry was announced to reopen, on 14 November, the Edinburgh theatre as Lord Ogleby, but was ill and did not appear until the 23rd. The following day he played Shylock.<br>
<br>On 8 September 1813, as Leon in <span class="italic">Rule a Wife and have a Wife</span>, Terry made his first appearance at Covent Garden, where, except for frequent migrations to Edinburgh and summer seasons at the Haymarket, he remained until 1822. Among the parts he played in his first season were Sir Robert Bramble in <span class="italic">The Poor Gentleman</span>, Dornton in <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span>, Ford, Sir Adam Contest in <span class="italic">The Wedding Day</span>, Ventidius in <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>, Shylock, Churlton, an original part in James Kenney's <span class="italic">Debtor and Creditor</span> (26 April 1814), and Sir Oliver in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>.<br>
<br>On 12 March 1816 <span class="italic">Guy Mannering</span>, a musical adaptation by Terry of Scott's novel, was seen for the first time; this appears to have been the first of Terry's adaptations from Scott. At the Haymarket he appeared as Periwinkle in <span class="italic">A Bold Stroke for a Wife</span>, Hardcastle, Hotspur, Sir George Thunder, Sir Pertinax McSycophant, Sir Fretful Plagiary, Eustace de Saint-Pierre, Lord Scratch in <span class="italic">The Dramatist</span>, and in many other parts. In 1815, meanwhile, he had, by permission of the Covent Garden management, supported Sarah Siddons in Edinburgh, where he played Macbeth, Wolsey, King John, and the Earl of Warwick.<br>
<br>On 2 October 1817 his acting at Covent Garden of Frederick William, king of Prussia, in Abbott's <span class="italic">The Youthful Days of Frederick the Great</span> raised Terry's reputation to the highest point it attained, and on 22 April 1818 he was the first Salerno in Shiel's <span class="italic">Bellamira</span>. In Jameson's <span class="italic">Nine Points of the Law</span>, at the Haymarket on 17 July, he was Mr Precise, and in <span class="italic">The Green Man</span>, on 15 August, he exhibited what was called a perfect piece of acting as Mr Green. At Covent Garden on 17 April 1819 he was the first David Deans in his own adaptation of <span class="italic">The Heart of Midlothian</span>. Later that season he played Sir Sampson Legend in <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>, Buckingham in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, Prospero, Sir Amias Paulet in <span class="italic">Mary Stuart</span> (adapted from Schiller), and Lord Glenallan. He was announced for Jonathan Oldbuck in his own and Pocock's adaptation of <span class="italic">The Antiquary</span> on 25 January 1820, but illness seems to have prevented his playing the part, which was assigned to John Liston. On 17 May Terry was the first Dentatus in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">Virginius</span>. At the Haymarket during the summer seasons he played a great round of comic and other characters, including Hardy in <span class="italic">The Belle's Stratagem</span>, Peachum in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>, Falstaff in <span class="italic">1 Henry IV</span>, Old Hardcastle, Sir Peter Teazle, Dr Pangloss, Polonius, Lear, Sir Anthony Absolute, Pierre in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>, and Rob Roy. Among many original parts, in pieces by Kenney, T. J. Dibdin, and others, Terry was Sir Christopher Cranberry in <span class="italic">Exchange No Robbery</span>, by his friend Theodore Hook, on 12 August 1820.<br>
<br>Having quarrelled with the management of Covent Garden on a question of terms, Terry made his first appearance at Drury Lane on 16 October 1822, when he spoke an occasional address by Colman and played Sir Peter. He afterwards acted Crabtree, John Dory in <span class="italic">Wild Oats</span>, Cassio, Belarius in <span class="italic">Cymbeline</span>, Kent in <span class="italic">King Lear</span>, Dougal in <span class="italic">Rob Roy</span>, Solomon in <span class="italic">The Stranger</span>, and Grumio, and on 4 January 1823 was the first Simpson in John Poole's <span class="italic">Simpson and Co</span>. At the Haymarket on 7 July he was the first Admiral Franklin in Kenney's <span class="italic">Sweethearts and Wives</span>, and on 27 September the first Dr Primrose in a new adaptation by T. J. Dibdin of <span class="italic">The Vicar of Wakefield</span>. The season 1823&#150;4 at Drury Lane saw him as Bartolo in <span class="italic">Fazio</span>, Lord Sands, Menenius in <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span>, and the first Antony Foster in a version of <span class="italic">Kenilworth</span> (5 January 1824). The following season he appeared as Orozembo in <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>, Justice Woodcock in <span class="italic">Love in a Village</span>, Adam in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, Moustache in <span class="italic">Henri Quatre</span>, Hubert in <span class="italic">King John</span>, and Rochfort in an adaptation of <span class="italic">The Fatal Dowry</span>. Among his original roles were Zamet in <span class="italic">Massaniello</span> (17 February 1825) and Mephistopheles in <span class="italic">Faustus</span> (16 May), the latter one of his best parts. In 1825, in association with his friend Frederick Henry Yates, he became manager of the Adelphi, and opened on 10 October in a piece called <span class="italic">Killigrew</span>. This was followed on the 31st by Edward Fitzball's successful adaptation of <span class="italic">The Pilot</span>, in which Terry was the Pilot. He also appeared in other parts.<br>
<br>Terry's financial affairs had meanwhile become so involved that he had to retire from management. Under the strain of the collapse which followed, his mental and physical powers gave way. After leaving the Adelphi he retired temporarily to the continent, and was then re-engaged at Drury Lane to play Polonius and Simpson. Finding himself unable to act, and his memory quite gone, he threw up his engagement. On 12 June 1829 he suffered a stroke, and died later that month.<br>
<br>Terry married his first wife in Liverpool and on 25 June 1815 married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75554/', "Elizabeth Wemyss Nasmyth (1793&#150;1862)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75558/', "Nasmyth family")</script>], the daughter of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19797/', "Alexander Nasmyth")</script>. Mrs Terry&#151;who, after Terry's death, married the lexicographer Charles Richardson&#151;was herself an artist, and took some share in the decoration of Scott's home, Abbotsford. Terry left, by his second marriage, a son named Walter, after Scott (who promised to look after the boys' fortunes), and a daughter, Jane.<br>
<br>Terry, who was almost as well known in Edinburgh as in London, was highly respected in both places. His friend Sir Walter Scott thought highly of his acting in tragedy, comedy, pantomine, and farce. While escaping from the charge of ranting, he was best in scenes of vehemence, and was wise enough not to attempt parts of tender emotion. In comedy he excelled in old men, and in characters of amorous dotage, such as Sir Francis Gripe, Don Manuel, or Sir Adam Contest, he was excellent. His Falstaff was good. His chief fault was uneasiness. He disapproved of the starring system, and was conscientious enough not to pose as a star.<br>
<br>Terry's idolatry of Scott led him to imitate both his manner and his calligraphy. Scott, who corresponded freely with him on most subjects, declared that, were he called upon to swear to any document, the most he could do was to attest it was his own writing or Terry's. Terry had caught, according to Lockhart, the very trick of Scott's meditative frown, and imitated his method of speech so as almost to pass for a Scot. Scott lent him money for his theatrical speculations, and gave him excellent advice. Being intimate with the Ballantynes, Terry had a financial stake in their printing and publishing business, and when the firm became bankrupt Scott was saddled with his liability of &pound;1750. Terry's architectural knowledge was of great use to Scott, who consulted him while building Abbotsford; he also consulted Terry on many literary questions, especially in regard to plays, and seems to have trusted him with revising <span class="italic">The Doom of Devorgoil</span> for the stage. It seems likely that Terry was responsible for many of the numerous adaptations of Scott that saw the light between the appearance of <span class="italic">Waverley</span> and the actor's death. He also compiled <span class="italic">The British Theatrical Gallery</span> (1825), a collection of full-length portraits with biographical notes.<br>
