<span class="headword">Birch,  John</span>  (1745<span class="mult">x</span>9&#150;1815), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was the second child and only son of the three children of Thomas Birch, merchant. The family was clearly wealthy as in February 1763 Birch was apprenticed to the surgeon Thomas Smith for the substantial fee of &pound;400. He was admitted to the Surgeons' Company in 1770 and set up practice in London, first in Essex Street, later in Spring Gardens. Birch held a number of prestigious posts: he purchased a commission as surgeon to the Horse Grenadier Guards in 1770, from which he retired on 25 April 1779; from 1784 he served as surgeon at St Thomas's Hospital; he later became surgeon-extraordinary to the prince regent. Birch was conservative in his medical opinions, and at St Thomas's he opposed the new emphasis on anatomy and dissection in its medical teaching, championed by Henry Cline jun. Astley Cooper, another advocate of the new form of training, described Birch as &#145;a sensual man; clever, but a bad surgeon. He had neglected anatomy, and was therefore afraid of all operations which required a knowledge of it&#146;  (Parsons, 3.37&#150;8). Birch certainly resigned his post as lithotomist at the hospital in 1812, but this was probably due to advancing years rather than lack of dexterity.<br>
<br>Birch was an avid supporter of the medical use of electricity, which he believed in many cases offered an alternative to surgery. This form of therapy enjoyed a considerable vogue in the late eighteenth century following the discovery of the electrical nature of the nerve impulse, although it never became a fully accepted part of the therapeutic armamentarium. Treatment involved transmitting electric shocks from a Leyden jar to patients seated in an insulated chair. Single shocks were applied locally to the affected part through a wooden or metal &#145;director&#146;, or, alternatively, multiple shocks, making up an &#145;electrical fluid&#146;, were drawn through the body. The idea was to stimulate weak nerves, muscles, and vessels in the body, encouraging the circulation and the flow of secretions. Birch's four publications on the topic offered no new insights but simply described cases from his private practice and his clinic at St Thomas's. He claimed to have successfully treated a wide variety of acute and chronic disorders&#151;weak and stiff joints, localized paralysis, fevers, skin diseases, impotence, melancholy, kidney and bladder complaints, and particularly amenorrhoea.<br>
<br>Birch also revealed his conservative views in opposing the substitution of vaccination for the older practice of inoculation&#151;deliberate infection with smallpox. He was the most prestigious of the handful of practitioners who stood against Edward Jenner's discovery and offered some of the more moderate and reasoned arguments in a heated debate which lasted throughout the 1800s. In his <span class="italic">Letter Occasioned by the many Failures of the Cow-Pox</span> (1805) and <span class="italic">Serious Reasons for Objecting to the Practice of Vaccination</span> (1806) Birch argued that inoculation offered complete security, while the growing number of reported cases of smallpox after vaccination proved that the procedure was not, as Jenner and his supporters claimed, a certain preventative. Birch ridiculed the pro-vaccinators' attempts to explain away these failures as a result of vaccination with spurious cowpox. Birch also argued that the new practice was dangerous: the operation provoked acute and fatal inflammation or chronic skin complaints. The latter, Birch claimed, were unique to vaccinated children and not, as Jenner's supporters countered, pre-existing cases of scrofula. Birch was one of the few writers to point to the most serious flaw in Jenner's writings&#151;his failure to explain the relationship between cowpox and smallpox, and thus the mechanism by which vaccination could induce immunity.<br>
<br>Birch died on 3 February 1815 at his home in New Street, Spring Gardens, London. He was buried the next day alongside members of his family in the church of St Margaret Pattens, Rood Lane, Eastcheap, where a memorial tablet was placed extolling his professional virtues and enthusiasms.<br>
