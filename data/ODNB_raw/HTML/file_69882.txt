<span class="headword">Scudamore <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Shelton]</span>,  Mary</span>, Lady Scudamore  (<em>c.</em>1550&#150;1603), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/75178/', "Sir John Shelton (b. in or before 1503, d. 1558)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70835/', "Shelton family")</script>] of Shelton, Norfolk, and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70838/', "Margaret Shelton")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70835/', "Shelton family")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21305/', "Henry Parker, tenth Baron Morley")</script>. Nothing is known of her before her appointment as a chamberer of the privy chamber on 1 January 1571, but both her parents had significant connections to Elizabeth I. Her paternal grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70836/', "Sir John Shelton")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70835/', "Shelton family")</script>], who married Anne Boleyn's aunt Anne, was governor of Hatfield when it was Elizabeth's nursery in 1534&#150;6; Sir Henry Parker (<i>c</i>.1514&#150;1552), her mother's brother, was Elizabeth's chamberlain in 1550&#150;52. By January 1574 Mary had married (as his second wife) the gentleman pensioner <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76454/', "Sir John Scudamore (1542&#150;1623)")</script> of Holme Lacy, Herefordshire (<i>see under </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/71878">Scudamore family</a>), becoming as a result one of the best-known victims of Elizabeth's bad temper. In the notorious &#145;scandal letter&#146; of 1584 Mary, queen of Scots, accused Elizabeth of breaking one of Mary Scudamore's fingers and trying to conceal the incident as an accident caused by a falling candlestick. However lurid her account, the Scottish queen's source was the victim's close friend Lady Mary Talbot (wife of the future seventh earl of Shrewsbury), and there is independent confirmation from the maid of honour Eleanor Brydges that Mary Scudamore suffered both &#145;bloes and yevyll words &hellip; never woman bought hir husband more deare than she hath done&#146;  (Tighe, 163). But Elizabeth's hostility to privy chamber marriages has been greatly exaggerated and the marriage did neither Mary nor her husband, with whom she had two sons, any lasting harm. The best explanation is that as a Boleyn relation Elizabeth considered her to be a member of the extended royal family and expected her to seek prior approval of her marriage. She was also one of Elizabeth's favourite sleeping companions. On 9 October 1576 she was hastily summoned back to court from a holiday with her husband when Lady Dorothy Stafford broke her leg: &#145;for I fear untill you come her majestie shall not in the night have for the most part so good rest as she wyll take after your comyng&#146;  (earl of Sussex to Mary Scudamore, TNA: PRO, C115/M19/7543).<br>
<br>Thanks to the survival of the large collection of Scudamore papers in the &#145;duchess of Norfolk's deposit&#146; in the Public Record Office, Mary is one of the few women of the Elizabethan privy chamber to have left more than scraps of correspondence. Among her papers is one of the rare internal records of the privy chamber, the &#145;book of the stuffe of the quenes majestie's wardrobe&#146;, a daybook recording various items of Elizabeth's clothing and jewellery in the keeping of one of the privy chamber women. Since it runs from 1561 to 1585, Mary presumably inherited it from one of her predecessors. It was published by Janet Arnold in 1980 under the title <span class="italic">Lost from Her Majestie's Back</span>. The Cecil and Talbot correspondence reveals that although Mary Scudamore was still a chamberer in 1589, she was by then regarded in some quarters as a particularly effective intermediary with the queen. In 1599 Charles Cornwallis referred to her virtues having advanced her &#145;to that honourable place you are in &amp; therin have continued you to the great good of the house [the Howards] from whence you are descended&#146;  (TNA: PRO, C115/M18/7511). However, her financial exploitation of her influence has been cited by W. J. Tighe as evidence of the increasing rapacity of the privy chamber in the 1590s. In 1602 she was reported as seriously ill, and although she attended Elizabeth's funeral, like several other senior women of Elizabeth's privy chamber she did not survive the queen for very long. The exact date and place of her death are unknown, but she was buried at Holme Lacy on 15 August 1603.<br>
