<span class="headword">Stanwix,  Richard</span>  (1607/8&#150;1656), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Carlisle, the second son of James Stanwyx of Carlisle and his wife, Mary Broderick, and was &#145;educated in the free school there under Mr Thomas Robson, sometime of Queen's college&#146;. It was appropriate then that when Stanwix went up to Oxford University it was to study at Queen's under Charles Robson, the son of his former master. But though &#145;born of an ancient and genteel family&#146; Stanwix began his career at Oxford as &#145;a poor serving child&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.427). He matriculated on 21 November 1628, aged twenty, graduated BA on 12 May 1629, became a fellow of the college, and proceeded MA on 24 January 1632. On the recommendation of the former provost of Queen's, Barnaby Potter, Stanwix was made chaplain to Thomas Coventry, the lord keeper. He proceeded BD on 4 July 1639, and the following year was incorporated at Cambridge in that degree.<br>
<br>After Coventry's death Stanwix was appointed chaplain to his successor as lord keeper, John Finch, Baron Finch. In December 1640, however, following his impeachment by the Long Parliament, Finch found it expedient to retire to the Netherlands, and Stanwix returned for a time to Queen's College, Oxford. On the presentation of Sir Richard Saltonstall, also a graduate of Queen's, he was instituted on 1 May 1643 to the rectory of Chipping Warden in Northamptonshire. On 14 February 1646 at Mollington, Oxfordshire, Stanwix was married to Hester Holbech; they appear to have had no surviving children.<br>
<br>In 1652 Stanwix issued <span class="italic">A Holy Life here, the Only Way to Eternal Life Hereafter</span>. The chief message of the work was that perfection in this life &#145;is neither impossible, nor indeed so hard&#146; but that both &#145;the habitual observing of the laws of God, delivered to us by Christ, and change into a new creature&#146; are essential for salvation, though it was conceded that many would object that this was &#145;too sharp and sour a doctrine&#146;  (Stanwix, 2nd pagination, 69&#150;72). Stanwix held the rectory of Chipping Warden until his death on 8 April 1656; he was buried in the chancel of the parish church on the 10th. In his will of 29 March he bequeathed to his wife land in Weston and Weedon and to an array of relatives and servants sums ranging from &pound;30 to 5<i>s</i>.; to his nephew Robert Dalton, a student at Oxford, he left all the works of Grotius.<br>
