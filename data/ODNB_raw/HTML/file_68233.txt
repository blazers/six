<span class="headword">Plessington,  John</span> <span class="st"> [St John Plessington; <em>alias </em>William Scarisbrick]</span>  (1636&#150;1679), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born at Garstang, Lancashire, the son of Robert Plessington of Dimples Hall, Garstang, and his wife, Alice Rawstone, daughter of Laurence Rawstone of Tottington, Bury. His was an old Lancashire family, originating from Pleasington near Blackburn. He was the youngest brother to Robert, Laurence, and Elizabeth, and grew up during the civil war, in which his father surrendered to parliamentarian troops at the capture of nearby Greenhaigh Castle, and became a prisoner. A chaplain to the family, Thomas Whitaker, who was captured and executed in 1646, had been educated at St Omer and Valladolid and John Plessington followed the same route to the priesthood after his first studies locally at a Jesuit school at Scarisbrick Hall, near Ormskirk.<br>
<br>He studied humanities at St Omer and then theology at Valladolid in 1660, where the college register records his missionary oath, to return to serve in England. He received orders, up to that of deacon, at St Mary Magdalen in Valladolid (under the name Scarisbrick) and was ordained priest in Segovia on 25 March 1662. He returned to England in April 1663 because of ill health. Few details of his life in England are preserved. He was first in Lancashire, possibly at home in Dimples Hall recovering his health, and he seems to have been at Holywell in north Wales for some years before going as chaplain and tutor to the Massey family of Puddington Hall, Burton, Wirral, Cheshire, from about 1669. Edward Massey left him &pound;5 in his will, made on 7 September 1671.<br>
<br>As a result of the Popish Plot of 1678, which was exploited as a highly successful political weapon, Plessington, though far from the hysteria in London, was arrested by Thomas Dutton, who duly received a reward. At his trial in Chester no connection with the alleged plot could be established and he was charged under the, by then, threadbare act of 27 Elizabeth as a Catholic priest. His trial was in May 1679, and a summary was sent to parliament. During his nine weeks in prison some friends, including Sir James Poole of Poole Hall, a leading recusant, visited him. He remained cheerful and when the executioner came to measure him for his coffin was reported to have remarked to Poole that he was now giving orders for his last suit.<br>
<br>Plessington was executed at Gallows Hill, Broughton, Chester, on 19 July 1679. His last speech was taken down and later printed as <span class="italic">The Speech of Mr William Plessington</span> (1679). His quartered remains were brought to Puddington Hall to be exposed, but this was prevented locally, and after resting on an oak table in the hall they were interred secretly in Burton churchyard. The location, though not marked, was known and a later priest, Ralph Platt, asked to be buried in the same grave. In 1902 the vicar, Mr Morrell, transcribed a half-worn inscription from Platt's gravestone and a modern inscription was later placed to both priests. At the time of Plessington's canonization in 1970 as one of the forty martyrs an attempt was made to exhume his remains, but a number of bodies were found to be intermingled. A breviary he used is preserved at Upholland College, Lancashire, and has a number of marginalia giving the names probably of some of the families he served.<br>
