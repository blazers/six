<span class="headword">Lothian,  William</span>  (1740&#150;1783), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and historian</span>, was born in Edinburgh on 5 November 1740, the son of George Lothian, an Edinburgh surgeon, and Elizabeth Hutchison. His mother having died when he was an infant, and his father when he was five years old, he was raised by relatives. After attending Edinburgh high school, he proceeded to the arts and divinity courses at the University of Edinburgh, where he took an active part in the Belles Lettres Society and the Theological Society. Licensed to preach by the presbytery of Edinburgh in October 1762, he was presented to the first charge at the Canongate church on 12 April 1764 and was ordained there on 16 August. A supporter of the moderate party on the controversial subject of church patronage, he represented the presbytery of Edinburgh at the annual general assembly of the church in regular rotation, in 1768, 1773, 1778, and 1783, and earned the respect of his brethren for his &#145;sound understanding&#146; and &#145;firmness of mind&#146; in the assembly and other ecclesiastical courts  (Dalzel, 50).<br>
<br>On 1 October 1776 Lothian married the daughter of an Edinburgh jeweller, his cousin Elizabeth Lothian (<i>d</i>. 1815), with whom he had six children, five of whom survived him. In the same year two of his sermons were published in <span class="italic">The Scotch Preacher</span> (vol. 2). His major work was a large quarto, <span class="italic">The history of the united provinces of the Netherlands, from the death of Philip II, king of Spain, to the truce made with Albert and Isabella</span> (1780), published by James Dodsley and Thomas Longman of London and James Dickson of Edinburgh. John Murray had originally planned to publish it but, in a letter of 29 June 1779, declined to do so, citing unfavourable economic circumstances caused by the Spanish war and the closing of the American trade as factors in his decision. Lothian then approached the Edinburgh bookseller William Creech, who raised the matter with his primary publishing partner in London, William Strahan. Lothian viewed his book as a continuation of Robert Watson's successful <span class="italic">History of the Reign of Philip the Second, King of Spain</span>, which Strahan, Creech, and other partners had published in 1777, and he was apparently unaware that Watson himself was engaged in continuing that work. On 6 August 1779 Strahan informed Creech that they &#145;can have nothing to do&#146; with Lothian's manuscript because the subject infringed on Watson's. While Lothian continued to negotiate with booksellers, he was granted an honorary DD by the University of Edinburgh on 15 October 1779. His work is for the most part a dry narrative of the Dutch struggle for independence that concludes with praise for the &#145;firm and determined spirit&#146; of the Dutch, in opposition to the &#145;oppression&#146; and &#145;tyranny&#146; of Spanish rule  (W. Lothian, <span class="italic">The History of the United Provinces</span>, Dublin edn, 1780, 455).<br>
<br>Elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 17 November 1783, Lothian died one month later on 17 December, after a long and painful illness, and was buried in the Canongate churchyard. A memorial by John Logan was inscribed in the wall behind the church's gallery. On 15 March 1784 Andrew Dalzel read a brief biography of Lothian to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the first eulogy in the history of the society, which was published four years later in its <span class="italic">Transactions</span>.<br>
