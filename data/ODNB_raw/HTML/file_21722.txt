<span class="headword">Pearson, Sir  Richard</span>  (1731&#150;1806), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born in March 1731 at Langton Hall, near Appleby in Westmorland, the eldest son of Richard and Hannah Pearson, and baptized on 8 April 1731 at St Michael's Church, Appleby. After attending Appleby School (about 1740) he entered the navy in 1745 on the <i>Dover</i>, and joined in the Mediterranean the <i>Seaford</i>, commanded by his kinsman, Captain Wilson. Pearson remained in her for three years, and in 1749 joined the <i>Amazon</i> (Captain Arthur Gardiner). In 1750, seeing little prospect of promotion, he took service under the East India Company. He returned to the navy when war was imminent in 1755, passed his examination for lieutenant on 5 November, and on 16 December was promoted fourth lieutenant of the <i>Elizabeth</i>, which during 1756 was commanded by Captain John Montagu, and attached to the fleet employed on the coast of France and in the Bay of Biscay. In 1757 Montagu was superseded by Charles Steevens, who took the <i>Elizabeth</i> to the East Indies. Pearson was present in the actions of 29 April and 3 August 1758, and that of 10 September 1759. In one of these he was severely wounded. He was afterwards first lieutenant of the <i>Norfolk</i> with Steevens and Richard Kempenfelt, and was actually in command during a violent hurricane on 1 January 1761, owing to Kempenfelt's being disabled by an accident. It is said that Steevens was so well satisfied with his conduct that he promised him the first vacancy, and that his commission to command the <i>Tiger</i> (60 guns) was actually made out, but never took effect, as Steevens died before it was signed. At the capture of Manila in 1762 Pearson was first lieutenant of the <i>Lenox</i>; afterwards he returned to England in the <i>Seahorse</i>. On 28 January 1769 he married Margaret (<i>bap</i>. 1744), daughter of Francis Harrison of Appleby. They had two daughters, and four sons, one of whom, Richard Harrison Pearson, achieved the rank of vice-admiral in the navy.<br>
<br>Later in 1769 Pearson went out to Jamaica as first lieutenant of the <i>Dunkirk</i> with Commodore Arthur Forrest, who had promised him the first vacancy. Forrest, however, died before a vacancy occurred. In August 1770 Pearson received an acting order to command the <i>Phoenix</i>, but the appointment was disallowed by Captain Robert Carkett, on whom the command properly devolved. The Admiralty, however, took a favourable view of Pearson's claims, and promoted him on 29 October 1770 to command the sloop <i>Druid</i>. In January 1773 he was appointed to the <i>Speedwell</i>; and on 25 June, being at Spithead when the king reviewed the fleet, he was specially advanced to post rank. In 1776 Pearson was appointed to the <i>Garland</i>, in which he went out to Quebec in charge of convoy, and for the next two years was detained for service in the St Lawrence.<br>
<br>Pearson was appointed to command the <i>Serapis</i> (44 guns) in March 1778, and later he was sent to the Baltic with convoy. He was returning in company with the <i>Countess of Scarborough</i>, a hired ship, and the trade from the Baltic, when on the evening of 23 September 1779, off Flamborough Head, he met the American privateering squadron commanded by John Paul Jones. The <i>Pallas</i>, one of Jones's squadron, engaged and captured the <i>Countess of Scarborough</i>, while Jones's own ship, the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i>, grappled with the <i>Serapis</i>, and between the two one of the most obstinate fights on record took place. It was ended in favour of the <i>Richard</i> when the latter's consort, the <i>Alliance</i>, came under the stern of the <i>Serapis</i> and raked her, though the fire was not effective. Pearson felt unable to withstand a second enemy, and struck his colours. The <i>Richard</i> was on the point of sinking, and did sink a few hours after Jones had taken possession of the <i>Serapis</i>. Jones's cruise was necessarily brought to an end; and the defence of the <i>Serapis</i> against a nominally superior force and his protection of the convoy won for Pearson a very general approval. He was honourably acquitted by a court martial held on 10 March 1780, and was afterwards knighted and presented with the freedom of Hull, Scarborough, Lancaster, and Appleby, and presented with handsome pieces of plate by the Russia Company and the Royal Exchange Assurance Company. Pearson was an honest, brave officer, and no blame was attributable to him for the loss of the <i>Serapis</i>. However, the <i>Serapis</i>'s part in the events of September 1779 did not merit an official reward, and should be regarded more as an encouragement to the numerous officers engaged in convoy duty. Jones's remark on hearing of the honour conferred on him was: &#145;Should I have the good fortune to fall in with him again, I'll make a lord of him.&#146; In April 1780 Pearson was appointed to the <i>Alarm</i>, and afterwards he commanded the <i>Arethusa</i>. In 1790 he retired to the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich, where in 1800 he succeeded Captain William Locker as lieutenant-governor. He died there in January 1806 and was probably buried in the hospital's vault.<br>
