<span class="headword">Pitman, Sir  Henry Alfred</span>  (1808&#150;1908), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 1 July 1808 in London, probably at 41 Howland Street, St Pancras, the youngest of the seven children (four boys and three girls) of Thomas Dix Pitman (<i>d</i>. 1817/18), a solicitor in Furnival's Inn, and his wife, Ann Simmons of Worcester. He was educated at home until aged seven, and then at Dr Lord's school, Tooting, and Dr Nicholas's school, Ealing. From 1824 to 1827 he was tutored privately at Ware, Hertfordshire, and then entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a BA in 1831. After a year's travel abroad he spent six months in his family's own solicitor's office, and thus obtained a training in business methods. He then turned to medicine, studying at Cambridge for a year and then at King's College medical school and St George's Hospital in London. In 1835 he graduated MB and passed in 1838 at Cambridge the necessary additional examination for a licence to practise. In 1840 he became a licentiate and in 1845 a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London. He proceeded to a Cambridge MD in 1841 and commenced practice the following year as attendant physician to the duke of Grafton at Euston Hall, Suffolk. After only nine months he returned to London, where he worked at St George's Hospital. In 1846 he was elected assistant physician at St George's, and in 1857 physician and lecturer on the principles and practice of medicine, a post he retained until 1866, when he was the first there to be elected consulting physician.<br>
<br>While at the hospital Pitman's knowledge of chemistry helped in 1845 to convict John Tawell, who had committed a murder using prussic acid, and in 1854 a cholera outbreak severely tested Pitman's stamina and medical skills. Throughout this period he was also consulting physician at the St Pancras Royal General Dispensary, a post he held for over thirty years. In 1852 Pitman married Frances Wildman (<i>d</i>. 1910), only daughter of Thomas Wildman of Eastbourne, and their family eventually consisted of three sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>Pitman was a great administrator and during a long registrarship guided the Royal College of Physicians of London through many changes. In 1856&#150;7 he was censor, and in 1858 was elected registrar in succession to Dr Francis Hawkins. The <span class="roman">Medical Act</span> of 1858 entailed numerous changes in the organization of the college, which then surrendered the power to confer the exclusive right to practise in London. Pitman was largely responsible for the translation of the old Latin statutes of the college into English by-laws and regulations in harmony with the <span class="roman">Medical Acts</span> of 1858 and 1860. He helped to prepare the first edition of <span class="italic">Nomenclature of Diseases</span> (1869) and, with Francis Anstie, compiled a report for Disraeli on improving housing for the poor. He was also largely responsible for the initiation and organization of the conjoint examining board in England of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons. In recognition of his work on this and the new diplomas (LRCP, MRCS), he was knighted in 1883. He also took an active part in the institution of a special examination and diploma in public health. From 1876 to 1886 he was the college representative on the General Medical Council, and from 1881 chairman of the executive committee of the council. He resigned this post in 1886 and the registrarship of the Royal College of Physicians in 1889, when he was elected emeritus registrar.<br>
<br>Pitman was a deeply religious man with a serious manner about him, although this was moderated by humour and kindliness. He was an excellent administrator and long identified with the management of the Royal College of Physicians, but he should especially be remembered for his work in reorganizing medical education.<br>
<br>In July 1908 Pitman celebrated his hundredth birthday, but then died of heart failure at his home, Cranbrook, 33 Bycullah Road, Enfield, Middlesex, on 6 November 1908. He was buried in Enfield cemetery, Lavender Hill, Enfield, on 11 November.<br>
