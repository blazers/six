<span class="headword">Hartley,  David</span>  (<em>c.</em>1731&#150;1770), <span class="occ">coiner</span>, was born in the parish of Halifax in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the eldest of the three sons of William Hartley (<i>c</i>.1704&#150;1789), a weaver and hill farmer of Erringden, Halifax. Both his mother's identity and the details of his early upbringing remain obscure, but he appears to have left his native Yorkshire during his youth to be apprenticed to an ironworker in the midlands. It was here that he was probably first introduced to the counterfeiting of currency, which had become endemic in the Birmingham area by the mid-eighteenth century. Indeed Hartley's involvement in illicit coining may have prompted his sudden decision to return to the security of his father's remote and inaccessible farmstead late in 1765 or early in 1766 so as to escape the attention of the increasingly vigilant authorities around Birmingham.<br>
<br>There may also have been domestic reasons for Hartley's return since his young wife, Grace, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sutcliffe (<i>c</i>.1742&#150;1802), whom he had married at the parochial chapelry of Heptonstall in the parish of Halifax on 27 December 1764, was pregnant with their first child; Hartley's widowed father may well have offered accommodation to the couple at Bell House, a forest keeper's cottage, which William Hartley had leased since 1752. The first of the couple's three children, David, was born and baptized at Heptonstall on 17 March 1766, followed by a daughter, Mary, on 9 August 1767 and a second son, Isaac, on 2 April 1769. In the baptismal registers their father, David, is described as a weaver, living in the township of Erringden. Hartley continued to reside with his growing family at Bell House, a plain, millstone-grit, square-built farmhouse, until his arrest in 1769. The remote, moorland location of the property with its adjacent, concealed ravine and its abundant supply of wood for fuel offered an ideal base for a counterfeiter seeking to operate beyond the reach of the law.<br>
<br>It is likely that even before Hartley's return to Yorkshire his father and his younger brothers, Isaac (1737&#150;1815) and William (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1738), had already become engaged in the yellow trade, the clipping and remoulding of golden guineas into counterfeit Portuguese moidores, which were in widespread circulation in Yorkshire on account of the shortage and poor quality of the coin of the realm in the 1760s. Subsequently David's activities gained him the sobriquets the Chief of the Coiners and King David, since he had effectively usurped the authority of the Royal Mint in the upper Calder valley; through association with their brother, Isaac and William were designated the duke of York and the duke of Edinburgh. Although the coining activities in which they engaged were neither the first nor the last instances of illegal counterfeiting of currency in the West Riding, it was the vast scale of the operation masterminded by David Hartley that began to attract the attention of the authorities. At its height an estimated 100&#150;200 coiners and their associates were thought to have been engaged in the extensive network for collecting, clipping, and counterfeiting gold coin and returning it into circulation. The operation was served by more than a dozen mints, including Bell Hole, where gold coins were reputedly being diminished by clipping at the rate of 100 guineas per day, and sustained not only by blackmail, protection rackets, violence, and intimidation but also by massive and active popular support. The predisposition of local clothiers to accept the diminished and counterfeit coin was a consequence of an exceptional demand for specie and of the vicissitudes suffered by the region's woollen and worsted industries in those decades.<br>
<br>On 14 October 1769 David Hartley was arrested for clipping and defacing the king's coinage at the Old Cock inn in Halifax, on the evidence of James Broadbent, a charcoal burner and former associate, who was employed as an informer by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101235/', "William Dighton")</script>, the supervisor of excise for Halifax since 1759. Hartley's committal to York Castle on 16 October was widely held to have provoked the assassination of the 51-year-old excise officer on 9 November. The murder, which left his widow with five dependent children, prompted an investigation on behalf of the government by the marquess of Rockingham, the lord lieutenant of the West Riding. Though lack of evidence meant that he was never brought to justice David's younger brother Isaac was widely suspected of having recruited the assassins, Robert Thomas and Matthew Normanton, who were later hanged for their involvement in the crime. A contemporary proclamation issued after David Hartley's arrest includes a detailed description of his brother Isaac as a tall, dark, imposing figure, with black hair and a pock-marked countenance, usually clad in light-coloured clothes. However, no comparable physical description of David survives. Renowned for his conviviality and largess in local taverns, Hartley clearly had a considerable presence within the local community, but was also capable of striking fear into those who attempted to penetrate his clandestine organization.<br>
<br>David Hartley and an accomplice were sentenced to death at the York assizes in early April 1770 for clipping and diminishing the gold coins of the realm. They were hanged at Tyburn near York on the afternoon of Saturday 28 April. &#145;At the fatal tree&#146;, the <span class="italic">Leeds Mercury</span> reported, the convicted criminals &#145;behaved every way suitable to their unhappy circumstances, though we do not hear that they said anything by way of confession&#146;  (1 May 1770). Hartley's body was brought back for burial on 1 May in the churchyard of St Thomas &agrave; Becket at Heptonstall, where a surviving tombstone bears his initials and the year of his death, though the parish register records in Latin the details of his offence and his execution at York. In 1774 the solicitor to the mint, William Chamberlayne, who had visited Halifax in 1769, condemned &#145;King David&#146; to a committee of the House of Commons as &#145;the principal master&#146; of an illicit mint during whose &#145;reign&#146; the clipping of coin had become so firmly established in the neighbourhood of Halifax as almost, in the view of one historian, &#145;to bid defiance to the civil power&#146; (Marsh, 166; Styles, 214).<br>
