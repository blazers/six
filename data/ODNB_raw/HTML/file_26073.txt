</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sowerby,  James</span>  (1757&#150;1822), <span class="occ">natural history artist, publisher, and collector</span>, was born on 21 March 1757, at 2 Bolt-in-Tun Passage, Fleet Street, London, the son of John Sowerby (1719&#150;1766), a lapidary, and his wife, Arabella Goodreed (1725&#150;1782). He was educated at a day school, where he often made models during his lessons that he could sell. When he was fourteen friends provided &pound;100 to indenture him to Richard Wright, the marine painter, who following a paralytic stroke referred him to a Mr (William?) Hodges. Eventually, despite his diffidence in submitting a work to gain admittance, he became a student at the Royal Academy on 1 December 1777.<br>
<br>Initially Sowerby supported himself by teaching drawing or by painting portraits and miniatures, but he disliked the inaccuracy involved in pleasing his subjects and decided to try landscape painting. The resulting sketches persuaded William Curtis to employ him as a botanical illustrator for his publications including the <span class="italic">Flora Londinensis</span> (1783&#150;8) and, in return, to instruct him in botany. Sowerby illustrated many of the plants featured in the <span class="italic">Botanical Magazine</span>. After observing the processes of etching and engraving, he acquired sufficient knowledge to undertake his own publications and began with the abortive <span class="italic">Flora luxurians</span> (1789), which was followed by <span class="italic">An Easy Introduction to Drawing Flowers According to Nature</span> (1788), and its second edition, <span class="italic">A Botanical Drawing Book</span> (1791). When working for William Curtis, he had completed illustrations for several other authors including L'Heritier (1784, 1787, 1788) and Withering (1785).<br>
<br>While a student Sowerby visited the Norwich home of his friend Robert de Carle, and met Anne de Carle (1764&#150;1815), the subject of a portrait he had once drawn solely from her brother's description. At Norwich, he was introduced to several influential botanists and zoologists, including James Edward Smith and Dawson Turner. Through these connections and by soliciting drawing commissions from members of the nobility attracted to natural history pursuits, he was able to increase his income. Ultimately he co-operated with Smith to produce <span class="italic">English Botany</span> (1790&#150;1814)&#151;the first extensive description of the British flora, which owing to Smith's caution over admitting authorship of this work, became known as &#145;Sowerby's Botany&#146;. This enterprise ended his association with Curtis. Its success encouraged him to publish a companion work, <span class="italic">Coloured Figures of English Fungi</span> (1797&#150;1815), for which he was solely responsible, and to produce a series of models of British fungi for display. After becoming a member of the Linnean Society in 1789 (made fellow in 1793), he became involved with the work of Sir Joseph Banks.<br>
<br>In order to obtain material for description in <span class="italic">English Botany</span>, Sowerby requested botanists throughout the country to submit suitable specimens. By appealing to their vanity, or willingness to serve science, he established the network of naturalists that enabled his family to produce a succession of natural history publications. Dawson Turner (1755&#150;1858), an early contributor, joined him on a botanical tour of Cornwall in 1799&#151;one of the few occasions that Sowerby carried out fieldwork and did not use pressure of work as an excuse to hide a dislike of travelling.<br>
<br>Following his marriage to Anne de Carle on 9 February 1786, which produced nine children, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26074/', "James De Carle Sowerby")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26070/', "George Brettingham Sowerby the first")</script>, and the gift of a house in Lambeth by his father-in-law, Robert Brettingham de Carle, Sowerby started to form his own museum and planned to achieve a complete collection of British natural history. Seeking further publishing outlets, he produced the <span class="italic">British Miscellany</span> (1804&#150;6), a work that featured new and rare animal, bird, and insect subjects, many from his own specimens. He then produced a work on crystallography (1805) and, when rheumatism prevented him engraving for a while, published <span class="italic">A New Elucidation of Colours &hellip;</span> (1809). The acquisition and exploitation of the Yorkshire meteorite in 1804 demonstrates his business acumen, persistence, and resourcefulness, while the complete disregard for his fungi drawings when adapting them to unsuitable copper plates indicates his very thrifty nature. The fashion for geology led to the part publications of <span class="italic">British Mineralogy</span> (1802&#150;17), <span class="italic">Exotic Mineralogy</span> (1811&#150;20) and to his commencing <span class="italic">The Mineral Conchology of Great Britain</span> (1812&#150;46). In 1808, he became a fellow of the Geological Society, formed the previous year.<br>
<br>In both his publications and correspondence, Sowerby assisted and encouraged naturalists, or advised uninformed collectors of minerals, fossils, plants, birds, and insects; many maintained that they were completely dependent upon him for such information. Specimens were sent for identification, description, and illustration, or as additions to his museum, and in return he sent duplicate specimens or parts of his various publications. He was often used as a clearing house by distant correspondents or asked to conduct other errands. Fully occupied, he wrote &#145;as one letter &amp;c. &hellip; so frequently comes upon another &hellip; my avocation will not allow me to answer all&#146; and claimed &#145;I have been such a recluse that I scarcely know what is doing out of doors!&#146;  (Wellington, NZ, Mantell Archive, ATL MS 83, folder 90). The publications became irregular or incomplete, or had errors, which caused widespread criticism and dissatisfaction among subscribers. Apart from the <span class="italic">Genera of Recent and Fossil Shells</span> (1820&#150;34), no attempt was made to arrange the contents of his works systematically, but in providing the first scientific description, name, and illustration for many British taxa, they established a framework for several branches of natural history as well as encouraging methodical collection. Sowerby, always fully involved in some aspect of illustration, publication, or communication, regarded pursuits such as the playing of musical instruments, or entertainment, as &#145;a loss of time&#146;  (Simpkins, &#145;Biographical sketch&#146;, 409).<br>
<br>After the death of his wife in September 1815 Sowerby concentrated on increasing his collections but still directed the various members of the family in the continuation of the serial publications. The following year, he published the first part of Smith's <span class="italic">Strata Identified by Organized Fossils</span> (1816&#150;17), a project which had been in hand since 1808. In December 1820 he married the widow of Admiral Reynolds, Maria Catherine, who then upset the rest of the family by trying to interfere with their established publishing procedures.<br>
<br>In his portrait, James Sowerby appears to be small and slight; for most of his life he enjoyed good health, but in the last few years he suffered from the urinary problems commonly experienced in old age and after an illness of some four months, died at his home, 2 Mead Place, Lambeth, on 25 October 1822. Sowerby had a considerable influence on the development of natural history. Although he did not achieve the goal of acquiring a complete collection of the British flora and fauna, he made a substantial contribution to its scientific description. <i>Sowerbaea</i>, an Australian genus known as the &#145;vanilla lily&#146;, was named by J. E. Smith in Sowerby's honour, and the cetacean <i>Mesoplodon bidens</i>, first described in the <span class="italic">British Miscellany</span>, is still commonly known as &#145;Sowerby's whale&#146;.<br>
