<span class="headword">Ord,  Bernhard <span class="st"> [Boris]</span></span>  (1897&#150;1961), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born on 9 July 1897 at Bristol, the youngest of the five children of Clement Ord, a Quaker and head of the German department at Bristol University, and his wife, Johanna, daughter of Hofprediger G. Anthes, who came of a musical German family. Bernhard was educated from 1907 to 1914 at Clifton College, of which he was a scholar and, later, a governor. He took his ARCO diploma while still at school and won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music, London, where he studied the organ under Sir Walter Parratt and also excelled at the pianoforte. He was already a devotee of opera, and his familiar name Boris, by which he became universally known, arose from his enthusiasm for Mussorgsky's <span class="italic">Boris Godunov</span>, introduced to London in 1913 by Thomas Beecham. After war service from 1916 to 1918, first with the Artists' Rifles and then as a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps, during which he was twice wounded, he returned to the Royal College of Music, where he took up choir training.<br>
<br>It was as organ scholar of Corpus Christi College that Ord went to Cambridge, in 1919. The next year he founded the Cambridge University Madrigal Society, later to be known for its May week concerts in massed punts on the river. He became MusB in 1922, and the following year was elected to a fellowship at King's, his father's college, within which as a bachelor he spent the rest of his life. As a freelance musician he was much in demand. Sometimes it was as a continuo player on the piano or harpsichord, as for the staging of works by Purcell and Handel produced by Camille Prior and Cyril Rootham, the organist of St John's College; sometimes as a conductor, as for the Greek play committee's revival in 1921 of Aristophanes' <span class="italic">The Birds</span> with the music of Sir (Charles) Hubert Parry and of Aeschylus' <span class="italic">Oresteia</span> with Cecil Armstrong Gibbs's music (1924). He also conducted a remarkable performance (1928) of Stravinsky's <span class="italic">The Soldier's Tale</span> in which Lydia Lopokova, the wife of the economist J. M. Keynes, was the princess, Michael Redgrave the soldier, and Dennis Arundell the narrator. In 1927 he gained valuable experience by working at Cologne opera house.<br>
<br>On the death of A. H. Mann in 1929 Ord was appointed organist of King's College and also of the university. At King's he joined forces with the dean, the Revd Eric Milner-White, in his policy of broadening the repertory of the chapel music, especially by strengthening the sixteenth-century element. In 1936 he became a university lecturer in music, and in 1938 he succeeded Rootham as conductor of the Cambridge University Musical Society. His work for the society greatly broadened his scope and also revealed the range of his musical sympathies. Continuing Rootham's tradition, he conducted a highly successful stage performance of Handel's <span class="italic">Saul</span> in the Guildhall, with David Franklin in the title role.<br>
<br>The outbreak of war inevitably reduced the number of chapel services at King's. In 1941 Ord handed them over to Dr Harold Darke for the duration and rejoined the air force as a flight lieutenant; he eventually participated in the Normandy landings and the ensuing campaign. Back at Cambridge, he resumed his duties in 1946. His Cambridge University Musical Society concerts included Beethoven's ninth symphony and Stravinsky's <span class="italic">Symphony of Psalms</span>. On the Guildhall stage there were performances of Handel's <span class="italic">Solomon</span> and of <span class="italic">The Pilgrim's Progress</span> by Vaughan Williams, and at the Arts Theatre of Purcell's <span class="italic">Dioclesian</span> and <span class="italic">King Arthur</span>. But early in the 1950s Ord's health weakened, and eventually disseminated sclerosis was diagnosed. He retired from the Cambridge University Musical Society in 1954, but for some time continued to conduct concerts at the Festival Hall, including works for varying numbers of harpsichords. It was a great comfort to him that his former organ scholar and assistant David Willcocks returned from Worcester Cathedral to take over from him in 1957&#150;8. He then resigned his university lectureship also. He was created CBE in 1958. His last public appearance, in a wheelchair, was in the Senate House in June 1960, to receive the honorary doctorate of music. He died at Cambridge on 30 December 1961.<br>
<br>As a musician Ord had exacting professional standards. His score-reading classes were a bracing test. As a choir trainer he inspired a mixture of affection and wholesome fear. Under him the King's choir established, by broadcasting and foreign tours, its international reputation. Durham University made him an honorary MusD in 1955. His abundant geniality was shown in many less serious musical productions, in his generous hospitality, and in his quick sense of humour.<br>
