<span class="headword">Hayes,  John Trevor</span>  (1929&#150;2005), <span class="occ">art historian and museum director</span>, was born on 21 January 1929 at 18 Fursby Avenue, Finchley, London, the elder son of Leslie Thomas Hayes, actuary, and his wife, Gwendoline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Griffiths. He was educated at Ardingly College and at Keble College, Oxford, where he graduated with a second-class degree in modern history in 1951. He went on to the University of London's Courtauld Institute of Art in 1952, where he gained a distinction in the postgraduate diploma in the history of art in 1954. In 1962 he received the degree of PhD from the Courtauld Institute for his thesis on the landscape paintings of Thomas Gainsborough.<br>
<br>Hayes's first post was at the London Museum, where in 1954 he was appointed assistant keeper by the director, Sir Mortimer Wheeler. Four years later he was awarded a Commonwealth Fund fellowship that took him to the Institute of Fine Arts in New York and gave him the opportunity to travel across the United States to see public and private art collections. He forged many friendships during his year there and returned regularly over the following four decades. During his early years at the London Museum he organized a number of exhibitions, including in 1956 one on Anna Pavlova, which reflected his lifelong passion for ballet. In 1970 he was appointed director of the London Museum but the following years were difficult for him, since the proposed amalgamation with the Guildhall Museum and the plans to move from Kensington Palace to new premises, designed by Powell and Moya at London Wall, were not entirely to his liking. As director he appointed younger staff, established a modern department under the direction of Colin Sorensen, and, with very modest resources, continued to organize successful exhibitions such as that devoted to Mary Quant's London in 1973.<br>
<br>When in 1974 he failed to be appointed director of the new Museum of London, Hayes applied successfully to succeed Roy Strong as director of the National Portrait Gallery. His twenty years as director witnessed a highly successful period in the gallery's history. Outstanding monographic exhibitions like those devoted to Van Dyck in England, Sir Peter Lely (both curated by Sir Oliver Millar), Johan Zoffany, and Sir Thomas Lawrence continued to enhance the gallery's burgeoning reputation as a centre for scholarship in historic British portraiture. Shortage of space at the gallery's cramped St Martin's Place premises was an issue that Hayes urgently wished to address and, although plans to move to the South Bank or to Canary Wharf in the later 1980s were not supported by the trustees, in 1987 Hayes persuaded Margaret Thatcher's government to purchase the freeholds on Orange Street, immediately to the north of the gallery, which allowed for expansion to house the gallery's extensive archives, administrative and curatorial offices, and conservation departments. In 1989 the newly remodelled ground floor of the gallery, with new twentieth-century galleries and the Wolfson exhibition gallery providing more space, was opened. Substantial funding for both these projects came from private donations, notably &pound;2 million from the Heinz Foundation, and the new Orange Street extension opened in November 1993, just months before Hayes's retirement.<br>
<br>Hayes was a notable exponent of outstations in the regions for the National Portrait Gallery, believing in the principle of putting on public display as many of the nation's pictures as possible. In 1979 collaboration with the National Trust resulted in the opening of Beningbrough Hall, near York, where many eighteenth-century works not on display at the gallery could be shown. A few years later Bodelwyddan Castle in Denbighshire became available for the display of nineteenth-century portraits. Hayes also pioneered the &#145;acceptance-in-lieu&#146; scheme, which allowed works allocated to public museums in lieu of tax to be retained in their historic setting, such as the fine group of paintings by Mytens and Gainsborough at Arundel Castle.<br>
<br>During Hayes's directorship the National Portrait Gallery made many important acquisitions, especially of eighteenth-century figures, including portraits by Reynolds of Laurence Sterne, by Gainsborough of J. C. Bach, and by Hogarth of the mathematician William Jones, as well as superb marble busts of Lord Chesterfield by Roubiliac and of Alexander Pope by Rysbrack. A subtle shift in policy could be detected in the gallery's attempts to ensure that acquisitions were not only of important historical figures but were high-quality works by leading artists. Hayes also had a profound interest in contemporary portraiture and in 1979 persuaded the trustees to extend the collecting policy to allow commissions. In 1980 he established the annual portrait award, initially sponsored by John Player and then later by BP, which led to the gallery's significant role in the revival of portraiture in the 1980s. In addition to acquiring important modern works like Graham Sutherland's <span class="italic">Self Portrait</span> Hayes commissioned such popular works as Bryan Organ's portrait of Lady Diana Spencer, just before her marriage to the prince of Wales in 1981, and he also encouraged talented young portrait painters like Sarah Raphael.<br>
<br>Throughout his tenure at both the London Museum and the National Portrait Gallery Hayes remained a prolific author. Soon after his arrival at the London Museum he began to publish learned articles in the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span> and <span class="italic">Apollo</span> and he continued his profound interest in the work of the eighteenth-century painter Thomas Gainsborough. In 1960 he organized a small exhibition of the artist's work for the Arts Council and in 1970 he published the first full catalogue, <span class="italic">The Drawings of Thomas Gainsborough</span>. This was followed a year later by <span class="italic">Gainsborough as a Printmaker</span> and in 1982 by a catalogue, <span class="italic">The Landscape Paintings of Thomas Gainsborough</span>. His catalogue entries were of unprecedented thoroughness, despite the lack of hard evidence about the dating of many of Gainsborough's works, and, after the death of Sir Ellis Waterhouse in 1985, Hayes was for some time unchallenged as the leading Gainsborough scholar. He organized two further exhibitions of the artist's work for the Tate and the Grand Palais in Paris in 1980&#150;81 and for Ferrara Arte in Italy in 1998. His last major publication on Gainsborough was an edition of <span class="italic">The Letters of Thomas Gainsborough</span> (2001). His interests were, however, much more wide-ranging and he published books on Rowlandson in 1972 and on Graham Sutherland in 1980. As an accomplished cataloguer he was also in demand internationally and his catalogue of the British paintings in the National Gallery of Art, Washington (1992), was followed by a catalogue of the British paintings in the Cincinnatti Art Museum, which remained unpublished at the time of his death.<br>
<br>Hayes's shy and diffident public manner could be misleading, and he enjoyed the companionship of his friends and the conviviality of the Beefsteak and Garrick clubs. He was a keen tennis player in his youth at Keble and an avid devotee of the opera and ballet. Among his greatest pleasures was foreign travel, especially by train and road. He always claimed his fearlessness as a driver resulted from learning to drive in Manhattan in the late 1950s. Excursions abroad were meticulously planned to ensure stopovers where Michelin-starred restaurants were to be found so that he could indulge his passion for excellent food. He was, however, essentially an intensely private man, and friends were often bemused that despite knowing him for decades he remained as enigmatic as on first meeting. His management style as a museum director was to delegate as much as possible, not only to give his colleagues experience but so that he could continue to pursue his own research and writing. At the time of his death he was preparing a catalogue of the subject pictures of Gainsborough and was honorary editor of the project to produce a full catalogue of Gainsborough's portraits.<br>
<br>Hayes was chairman of the Walpole Society from 1981 to 1996 and vice-president from 1996 until his death. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1971 and was appointed CBE in 1986. He never married and his only brother, Peter, predeceased him. In August 2005 he suffered a severe stroke which left him partially paralysed and with speech difficulties. He died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, from complications related to his condition on Christmas day 2005.<br>
