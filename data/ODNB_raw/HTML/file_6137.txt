<span class="headword">Cook,  George</span>  (1772&#150;1845), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and ecclesiastical historian</span>, was born in December 1772 in St Andrews, the second son of the Revd John Cook, professor of moral philosophy in the University of St Andrews, and Janet, daughter of the Revd John Hill, minister of St Andrews. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6142/', "John Cook (1771&#150;1824)")</script> was his elder brother. Educated at the United College at the University of St Andrews (1786&#150;90), he was awarded an MA in 1790 and spent the next four years studying divinity at St Mary's College at St Andrews. Cook was licensed a preacher in the Church of Scotland by St Andrews presbytery in April 1795 and the following June was presented by the principal and masters of St Mary's College to the living of Laurencekirk. On 23 February 1801 Cook married Diana, daughter of Alexander Shank, minister of St Cyrus, with whom he had seven children.<br>
<br>In 1808 Cook published his first major work, <span class="italic">An Illustration of the General Evidence Establishing the Reality of Christ's Resurrection</span>, and the same year received the degree of DD from St Andrews University. Subsequently he devoted himself to the study of the constitution and history of the Church of Scotland. In 1811 he published the <span class="italic">History of the Reformation in Scotland</span>, which was followed in 1815 by the <span class="italic">History of the Church of Scotland</span>. In 1820 he published <span class="italic">The Life of George Hill</span>, a biography of the long-time leader of the moderate party in the Church of Scotland, who was also his maternal uncle, and in 1822 a <span class="italic">General and Historical View of Christianity</span>. His work was characterized by lucidity and accuracy, although his narrative style was cold and formal.<br>
<br>From an early period Cook took a prominent part in the general assembly, and on the death of George Hill in 1819 he endeavoured to succeed him as leader of the moderate party. Cook had, however, in opposition to the general views of the party, taken a decided stand against pluralities and non-residence&#151;publishing a pamphlet on the importance of a resident parish clergy in 1816. Many moderates therefore distrusted him as a reformer with popular sympathies, and when he was proposed as moderator of the general assembly in 1821 and 1822 he was defeated on both occasions by large majorities. His temperate views, however, won over the party and he was unanimously elected moderator in 1825: from this time he was generally recognized as leader of the moderate party. In 1829 he was appointed professor of moral philosophy at St Andrews University, and demitted his charge at Laurencekirk, though this made no change in his relation to the Church of Scotland.<br>
<br>In 1834 the evangelical party, under the leadership of Thomas Chalmers, gained control of the general assembly and sought to modify the civil law of patronage by passing the <span class="roman">Veto Act</span>. This gave male communicants in a parish the right to veto the presentation of an unacceptable patron's candidate to the ministry of that parish. Cook strenuously opposed the passing of the <span class="roman">Veto Act</span>, claiming that it was an illegal infringement on the civil rights of patrons and presentees, and would involve the church in conflict with the civil courts. It would be more effective and constitutional, he argued, to leave it to presbyteries to judge the fitness of presentees and to refuse to ordain or translate unacceptable ones. When, as he predicted, the <span class="roman">Veto Act</span> did lead to conflict between church and state, Cook maintained that an established church had to accept the decisions of the civil courts with respect to the civil law of patronage, and repeal its <span class="roman">Veto Act</span>. He rejected the evangelical argument that this would compromise the church's &#145;spiritual independence&#146;. Though unable to compete with Chalmers as a popular orator, Cook possessed great readiness of reply, while clear and logical exposition and accurate knowledge of the laws and constitution of the church enabled him to hold his own in technical arguments.<br>
<br>In 1843 the patronage conflict culminated in the Disruption of the Church of Scotland. Cook became leader of the majority, who remained in the established church, and he sought to rebuild trust between the church and state. However, he did not long survive the Disruption. Shortly after the assembly of 1844 he was attacked by heart disease, and he died suddenly at St Andrews on 13 May 1845. Four sons and one daughter survived him, including his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6144/', "John Cook (1807&#150;1874)")</script>, minister at Haddington.<br>
