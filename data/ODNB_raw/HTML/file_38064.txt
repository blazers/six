<span class="headword">Thornton <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Ford]</span>,  Henry</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1750, <em>d.</em> 1818), <span class="occ">theatre manager</span>, was born in Clare, Suffolk, the fifth son of Daniel Ford and his wife, Elizabeth, and baptized there on 6 March 1750. He attended Clare School and later claimed to have resided as a law student at the Inner Temple. However, no formal enrolment was made. At the age of twenty-three, having changed his surname to Thornton, he was leading a band of itinerant players in the west country. John Bernard was among them, and described their life in <span class="italic">Retrospections of the Stage</span> (1830). About 1780 Thornton married Elizabeth Pritchard, the daughter of a provincial theatre manager. They had at least two sons, who died young, and three daughters. After conducting other strolling groups, in the early 1780s Thornton became prompter, a job akin to stage manager, at the Portsmouth theatre.<br>
<br>By 1785 Thornton was the established manager of the theatre at Newbury. Shortly afterwards he added Henley and Andover to his circuit, and in 1788 at Reading he set up his first purpose-built theatre. Early in his career he appears to have had a clear idea of the disposition of his circuit. He leased or bought a number of buildings along the London to Bath road in towns used as overnight rests by the coaching companies. A similar pattern of theatres was acquired along the Chichester road and the Portsmouth road, with the circuit terminating on the Isle of Wight at East Cowes and Ryde.<br>
<br>In 1791 the Windsor theatre, then no more than a shed in a muddy field at the lower end of Peascod Street, was bought from the writer, bookseller, and actor Francis Waldron. Thornton rebuilt it at the foot of the castle ramparts. With its sumptuous furnishings, the playhouse proved to be popular with George III and his family, and a description of their visits is given by Charles Knight in <span class="italic">A Volume of Varieties</span> (1844).<br>
<br>Throughout his management Thornton attracted eminent performers to his theatres. Various members of the Kemble family played in them. Comedians such as John Quick and Richard Suett, both favourites of George III, made regular forays. Dorothy Jordan appeared throughout his management, starring in the first season of the Reading theatre and making her last appearance for Thornton at Ryde in 1813. The circuit was one of the first to stage hippodramas in the provinces, and employed Andrew Ducrow and his horsemen for this purpose.<br>
<br>Thornton was a man with flair but with no eye for detail. Highly forgetful, he is said to have put on all six shirts his wife packed for his tour and removed each as it became too dirty to wear. He had little patience with learning lines, a habit which spread to members of his company. Nevertheless, when staging epics such as Sheridan's <span class="italic">Pizarro</span> he did so with tremendous verve. With such presentations he was helped by one of his sons-in-law, William Hatton, whose own interest lay in the spectacular. Another son-in-law, Edward Barnett, after Thornton's retirement in 1817, took up the reins of management, and cared for the theatres at Newbury, Chelmsford, Guildford, Oxford, and Reading. The last of these Barnett relinquished in 1853 at the age of eighty-three. Thornton died in High Street, Chelmsford, Essex, on 21 April 1818 and was buried on 26 April in the churchyard of St Mary's (later the cathedral). His wife had predeceased him on 11 March 1816.<br>
