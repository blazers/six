<span class="headword">Olivier,  Edith Maud</span>  (1872&#150;1948), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 31 December 1872 at the rectory, Wilton, Wiltshire, the eighth of the ten children of Canon Dacres Olivier (1831&#150;1919), rector of Wilton, and his second wife, Emma Selina (1836&#150;1908), daughter of Bishop Robert Eden, of Moray, Ross, and Caithness. The Olivier family was of Huguenot descent, settling in England in the early eighteenth century. Edith's grandfather Henry Stephen Olivier lived at Potterne, Wiltshire, from about 1830, and was high sheriff of the county in 1843. His eldest son, Henry Arnold, was the grandfather of Laurence Olivier, the actor. Educated at home, Edith attended St Hugh's College, Oxford, for four terms only (1895&#150;6) owing to bronchial asthma. Her early years were dominated by her father, with whom she and her younger sister Mildred lived until his death in 1919. From 1922 Edith lived in the Daye House, on the Wilton estate. In 1916 she was asked by Wiltshire county agricultural committee to form the Women's Land Army, for which she was appointed MBE in 1920. She was a member of the Conservative Party, was involved in parliamentary elections, and held local and county offices in the Women's Institute. A devout Christian all her life, she attended the Anglican church regularly and was secretary to the Bishop's Women's Diocesan Council. In 1934 she became the first woman councillor on Wilton town council and was mayor of the borough from 1938 to 1941. During the Second World War her many extra duties as mayor included being president of the local St John Ambulance Brigade.<br>
<br>After the death of Mildred in 1924 Edith's friendship widened to the younger generation and included much of the artistic circle of the day. She was close to the artist Rex Whistler and frequent hostess to Cecil Beaton, Siegfried Sassoon, William Walton, and many others, but she remained fully involved in the local community. Her books include <span class="italic">The Love Child</span> (1927) and <span class="italic">Four Victorian Ladies of Wiltshire</span> (1945) (the only ones to be republished), <span class="italic">Dwarf's Blood</span> (1931), <span class="italic">The Triumphant Footman</span> (1930), <span class="italic">The Seraphim Room</span> (1932), <span class="italic">Night Thoughts of a Country Landlady</span> (1943), a biography of Alexander Cruden (1934), a book on Wiltshire, and an autobiography, <span class="italic">Without Knowing Mr Walkley</span> (1938). She died on 10 May 1948 following three strokes, and was buried on 14 May in Wilton churchyard, a few yards from where she was born. Cecil Beaton described Edith's funeral thus: &#145;The dignity of Church and Government was there to pay her honour, as was fitting. But that was only part of what was in our hearts. There was honour, indeed, for what she had done; but there was love for what she was and is&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury Journal</span>).<br>
