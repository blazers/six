<span class="headword">Pakington <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Coventry]</span>,  Dorothy</span>, Lady Pakington  (<em>bap. </em>1623, <em>d.</em> 1679), <span class="occ">friend of learned clergy</span>, was baptized on 17 December 1623 at St Bride's, Fleet Street, London, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6483/', "Sir Thomas Coventry (1578&#150;1640)")</script>, lord keeper from 1625 to 1639 and first Baron Coventry from 1628, and his second wife, Elizabeth (1583&#150;1653), daughter of John Aldersey of Spurstow, Cheshire, and widow of William Pitchford. Dorothy Coventry married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21146/', "Sir John Pakington, second baronet (1621&#150;1680)")</script>, of Westwood, Worcestershire. The marriage probably took place in the early 1640s. Sir John Pakington had been Lord Coventry's ward since his father's death in 1624, and the match may have been arranged by Dorothy's parents, but however it was initiated it appears to have been a loving and companionate marriage. It is not known how many children Lady Pakington bore. In 1660 the couple had three children living, all of whom survived her: a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21147/', "John Pakington (c.1649&#150;1688)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21146/', "Pakington, Sir John")</script>], who succeeded as third baronet, and two daughters. Her daughter Elizabeth, who married Anthony Eyre about 1660, was given possession of Lady Pakington's manuscript prayers and other papers.<br>
<br>Like her husband, Lady Pakington was a zealous royalist. Many of her prayers composed during the civil war and interregnum express strong partisanship for the royalist cause, with fervent appeals to God during the trial and execution of Charles I. In early 1649 Lady Pakington begged God to &#145;suffer not the effusion of his [Charles's] blood to be added to the many provocations of a rebellious people &hellip; shew thyself a Lord of power &hellip; in averting this horrible fact&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Add. B.58, fols. 4<i>v</i>&#150;5). Once the king's death was a <i>fait accompli</i>, she drew parallels between Charles's execution and Christ's crucifixion  (ibid., fols. 5&#150;5<i>v</i>). She also beseeched God to give political guidance to the youthful Charles Stuart, whom she considered an unsophisticated player in the game of factional politics: &#145;he is a young unexperienced Pilot to steer to turne a vessel in so impetuous a storme&#146;  (ibid., fol. 2). Lady Pakington pleaded for his restoration to the throne, but not by the &#145;unchristian complyances&#146; Charles had offered to the Scots:<blockquote>Let thy mercy pardon whatever hath already of this kind past from him, and let the unsuccessfullnes of these sinister expedients but most principally the sinn of them, be a perpetuall document to him, to rely no more on such broken reeds &hellip; let not that treacherous party within our own bosomes [those royalists who promoted a Scottish alliance], continue to blast all his Enterprises. (ibid., fols. 2&#150;3)</blockquote>Meanwhile Sir John Pakington had compounded for his estates, which had been sequestered in 1646. In 1649 the lands were conveyed to the regicide Thomas Scott, although the Pakington family continued to live at Westwood throughout the interregnum. At this time Lady Pakington and her husband invited the king's chaplain, Dr Henry Hammond, to stay with them at Westwood, where Dr Hammond remained as an honoured guest until his death in 1660. Lady Pakington's exceptional intellect and her deep interest in theology led to a close friendship with Hammond. She was welcomed into the circle of Hammond's clerical colleagues, including such eminent divines as John Fell (dean of Christ Church and later bishop of Oxford), Richard Allestree, John Dolben (later archbishop of York), Humphrey Henchman (later bishop of London), George Morley (later bishop of Winchester), and other prominent churchmen, many of whom became her personal friends. As well as participating in theological and philosophical discussions Lady Pakington shared in the circulation of manuscripts (some of which were found in her possession at her death) written by Hammond and his coterie. Lady Pakington's friendship with Anglican divines and her scholarly interests were later continued by her son, John. Like his mother, John led a quiet studious life at Westwood, and under the tutelage of the non-juror George Hickes he became an outstanding Anglo-Saxon scholar.<br>
<br>It may have been the close ties between Lady Pakington and the group of learned divines centring on Henry Hammond that led contemporaries to conjecture that she was the anonymous author of <span class="italic">The Whole Duty of Man</span> and other works presumably composed by the same writer. The hypothesis of Pakington's authorship appeared to be supported by a range of contemporary evidence, including her daughter Mary Eyre's alleged possession of a copy of <span class="italic">The Whole Duty</span> in Lady Pakington's autograph, and the statement of Dr Hickes in the dedication of his <span class="italic">Linguarum septentrionalium thesaurus</span> to Lady Pakington's grandson (1697) that Lady Pakington's piety and intellectual talents entitled her to be called author of <span class="italic">The Whole Duty</span>. Citing these and other &#145;witnesses&#146;, George Ballard argued the claim vigorously in his biography of Lady Pakington  (Ballard, 290&#150;300). In 1864, however, the Revd Francis Barham suggested that the author of <span class="italic">The Whole Duty</span> was Hammond's friend Richard Allestree, a theory supported in 1884 in three articles by C. E. Doble, and now accepted virtually unanimously by modern scholarship. Nevertheless, the fact that her scholarly acquaintance were willing to assign authorship of such celebrated works to Lady Pakington gives some idea of her impressive intellectual gifts, and of the general esteem in which she was held during her lifetime.<br>
<br>Lady Pakington died of a stroke at Westwood Manor on 10 May 1679. The cause of death was confirmed by autopsy, whose results are summarized in &#145;An account of the appearances upon dissection in the body of the honorable the Ladie Pakington&#146; (BL, Sloane MS 4034, fol. 363). She was buried in the family vault in the church at Hampton Lovett, near Westwood, on 13 May. A memorial inscribed on the monument erected for her husband declared Lady Pakington &#145;Justly reputed, the Authoress of the <span class="roman">Whole duty of Man</span>; Who was Exemplary for her great Piety and Goodness&#146;  (Ballard, 303).<br>
