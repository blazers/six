<span class="headword">Paine,  James</span>  (1745&#150;1829), <span class="occ">architect, sculptor, and artist</span>, was baptized at Pontefract, Yorkshire, on 28 August 1745, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21131/', "James Paine (bap. 1717?, d. 1789)")</script>, architect, then of Pontefract, subsequently of London, and his first wife, Sarah Jennings. Like his father before him, he studied at the St Martin's Lane Academy and as early as 1761 started exhibiting watercolours at the Society of Artists of Great Britain; and he trained as an architect with his father, assisting the latter in supervising the erection of Thorndon Hall, Essex, which was begun in 1764. He visited Rome on two occasions, the first in 1766&#150;9, when he also spent some time sketching in the Campagna, and in Venice, where he made the acquaintance of the celebrated connoisseur Consul Joseph Smith; the second, with his wife in 1773&#150;5, when he made a number of measured drawings and other studies of buildings in and around the city  (J. Paine sketchbooks, V&amp;A). In 1771 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and he was one of the original members of the Architects' Club, founded in 1791. On 16 August 1773 he married Elizabeth Crow; they had four children, a son who died young and three daughters. Before his marriage, after leaving his father's house in 1772, he had lived in King Street, Covent Garden; and by 1776 he was living in Charlotte Street, Marylebone. By 1788 he had moved to North End, Hammersmith, and by 1809 to a &#145;model cottage&#146; at Sunninghill, Berkshire.<br>
<br>In relation to two of the three media which he essayed, however, Paine's career was essentially a failure. Regarding his work as a sculptor, his friend the artist Joshua Green commented in 1776 that &#145;he cannot now flatter himself of ever getting anything but Chips in the Phidian Art&#146;  (Green to Humphrey, 10 Dec 1776, Royal Academy, Ozias Humphrey MS HU 2/47), and it never amounted to much more than a small group of chimney-pieces and funerary monuments, mainly executed in the 1770s. As an architect, even more starkly, he has only a single executed commission credited unambiguously to his name, a villa called Belmont at Mill Hill, Middlesex, of <i>c</i>.1770, which was evidently deputed to him by his father; and the main reason for this state of affairs was a serious and prolonged estrangement from the latter, which began shortly after the Mill Hill commission. There followed only a sequence of rejected or otherwise abortive proposals and optimistic exhibition projects, and at the most mere scraps of executed work; and by the time the breach was healed, in 1783, his father was virtually in retirement and no longer had an active practice to pass on. So in the 1790s he appears to have abandoned his attempts to establish himself in this field also and turned instead to the third string in his bow, that of topographical painting, in which he seems to have achieved a modest success. A sketchbook inscribed &#145;J. Paine Rome 1776&#146; containing Italian views is in the Victoria and Albert Museum.<br>
<br>Paine's Belmont is nevertheless a building of some interest, a creative variation on his father's manner, notable features of which include a virtuoso sequence of varied room shapes. In his subsequent projects he adopted a rather different idiom, examples being the designs for a stable block and a pavilion at Ugbrooke, Devon (1779), in a visionary neo-classical style, and an ambitious scheme for residential development on the marquess of Salisbury's Thames-side estate at Millbank, Westminster (1787&#150;9). Of his works of sculpture the most substantial are the monument to the actor William Powell in Bristol Cathedral (1771) and an elaborate chimney-piece embellished with caryatids for Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire (<i>c</i>.1773), designed and executed in conjunction with his father's reconstruction of the house. Of his achievement as a topographical artist it is not possible to form a just estimate owing to the dearth of identified examples, but in 1809 Joseph Farington recorded a comment on &#145;Payne's best manner&#146;, that he &#145;has a little too much manner, and does too much&#146;  (Farington, <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 10.3564). A &#145;worthy little man&#146; in Joshua Green's estimation  (Green to Humphrey, 10 Dec 1776, Royal Academy, Ozias Humphrey MS HU 2/47), he died at Sunninghill in May 1829, aged eighty-three, and was buried there on 12 May.<br>
