<span class="headword">Railing, Sir  Harry</span>  (1878&#150;1963), <span class="occ">electrical equipment manufacturer</span>, was born on 10 December 1878, the son of Isaac Railing, a Jewish hop merchant of Munich, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bing. His first name was originally Adolf, which he later changed to Harry when he settled in England. He attended Munich University and graduated as a doctor of engineering in 1901, before acquiring experience in the USA.<br>
<br>Sir Harry's elder brother, <a name="cosubject_48134"></a><span class="headword">Max John Railing</span>  (<em>b. </em>1868), had left Germany for England in 1892 and shortly after his arrival had joined the General Electric Company (GEC) in the accounts department. GEC was then a small but expanding electrical goods business run by two Bavarians, Gustav Byng and Hugo Hirst. With his quick grasp of figures and sound business sense, Max soon won promotion at GEC. He was particularly successful at winning orders from the electricity supply companies for GEC's heavy electrical machinery, and at the age of forty-two he became general manager at the firm's London head office&#151;a post he retained until he was promoted to joint managing director in 1929. Max became the right-hand man of Hugo Hirst, who had emerged as the driving force behind GEC. Hirst described Max Railing as &#145;my alter ego&#146;  (Whyte, 143). They were not only close in business matters; in 1900 Max had married Amanda, daughter of Herman Hirsch, whose sister Leontine had married Hugo (her cousin) in 1892, the year both Leontine and Max had left Germany. Max Railing was the obvious choice as Hirst's successor, but he predeceased Hirst on 14 January 1942, at Whiteknights, Shinfield Road, Reading; he was survived by his wife. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>It was Harry who succeeded Hirst, at the age of sixty-three, having joined GEC in 1905 as chief of the test room at Witton, near Birmingham. His wide American and continental engineering experience marked him out for advancement, and in 1911 he joined the board of GEC. In 1933 he married, as a widower, his second wife, (Charlotte) Clare (1895/6&#150;1959), an architect, and daughter of Joseph Ferdinand Nauheim, a bank clerk. There were no children. Nothing is known of his first wife. In 1942 he became vice-chairman, and then, on Hirst's death in 1942, chairman, of Britain's largest electrical manufacturing enterprise. At that time, the company had a capital of &pound;7.8 million and nearly 40,000 employees. He was well suited to GEC's immediate task of responding to the war effort and, although company profits stagnated, he directed pioneering work on radar. He was knighted in 1944 and became an OBE in 1946.<br>
<br>Once the war was over, Railing greatly expanded the productive capacity of GEC to meet the booming demand for electrical goods of all kinds. Enormous sums of money were expended on re-equipment and extensions. Between 1947 and 1955, the company spent &pound;20 million on plant and buildings alone, and in 1952 its authorized and issued capital was increased to &pound;23.6 million. Much of the increased capital was spent on engineering, which was Harry's chief interest. A completely new generating shop with testing plant was added at Witton and opened in 1950, while at the same time a new heavy turbine shop was completed at Erith. In the mid-1950s, under Railing's guidance, GEC moved into the nuclear power field, not on a consortium basis&#151;the means adopted by other electrical companies&#151;but as an extension of its own heavy engineering interests. When GEC began winning major orders for nuclear power stations (as at Hunterston on the Ayrshire coast for &pound;60 million) its prestige was assured, but more heavy expenditure was incurred, and the company became highly dependent on government contracts.<br>
<br>Harry Railing has been described as essentially a fine engineer, and his commitments outside GEC reflected that fact. He was president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1944, for example, and served on the councils of several other professional bodies. But it has also been said that &#145;he did not have the broad outlook needed in the chairman of a large company&#146;  (Jones and Marriot, 198). Arguments with the other joint manager, Leslie Gamage, the autocratic GEC management style, the poor quality of executives below board level&#151;all a legacy of the Hugo Hirst&#150;Max Railing era&#151;exacerbated these problems. GEC under Harry Railing was allowed to develop into a bloated, inefficient company, which unsuccessfully tried to mix both manufacturing and wholesaling functions. Harry Railing had boosted GEC's turnover to nearly &pound;100 million by 1957, but, ominously, net profits had started to fall from &pound;3.4 million in 1955 to &pound;2.4 million in 1957. This decline was only remedied when the heavy loans of GEC's expansionist phase caused a major crisis and restructuring after Railing's retirement.<br>
<br>In 1957, Harry Railing, now almost seventy-nine, decided to step down. His wife was ill with a brain tumour and died in 1959. He handed over to his seventy-year-old successor, Leslie Gamage. Railing himself died at his London home, 12 Gloucester Square, on 16 October 1963.<br>
