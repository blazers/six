<span class="headword">Verity,  Hedley</span>  (1905&#150;1943), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born at Welton Grove, Headingley, Leeds, on 18 May 1905, the eldest of three children and only son of Hedley Verity (1874&#150;1945), coal merchant, and his wife, Edith Elwick (1873&#150;1964), a Sunday school teacher. After attending Yeadon and Guiseley secondary school, he served a long cricket apprenticeship, playing for ten years in the Yorkshire and Lancashire leagues at Rawdon, Accrington, and Middleton. He was a professional player by the time of his marriage on 7 March 1929 to Kathleen Alice Metcalfe (1903&#150;1957), a bookbinder, daughter of Frederick Metcalfe, sales agent, of Horsforth, Leeds. They had two sons.<br>
<br>In 1930 Verity followed Wilfrid Rhodes in Yorkshire's famed company of slow left-arm bowlers. Rhodes had held sway until his fifty-third year, and his dominance delayed Verity's d&eacute;but for the county until 21 May 1930, the year of Rhodes's retirement. In 1931, his first full season with Yorkshire, Verity was one of the five cricketers of the year in <span class="italic">Wisden</span>, chosen in recognition of bowling performances which included his feat of taking ten wickets in one innings against Warwickshire at Leeds on his twenty-sixth birthday. This was followed in 1932 by his record-breaking figures of 10 wickets for 10 runs, including the hat-trick, against Nottinghamshire. On seven other occasions for Yorkshire he took 9 wickets in an innings, helping the county to win the championship in seven of the ten seasons when he played for them.<br>
<br>Verity made his first test match appearance for England against New Zealand in July 1931. In his forty test match appearances, the last of which was against the West Indies at Lord's in June 1939, he took 144 wickets (at an average of 24.37). His most outstanding test match performance was against Australia at Lord's in June 1934, when he took 14 wickets for 80 runs on the third day, bringing about England's only victory over the Australians at Lord's in the twentieth century. His duels with Don Bradman stood out above all else. He was one of the few bowlers who refused to be overawed by the cricketing genius, whom he dismissed on ten occasions. During the controversial &#145;bodyline&#146; series to Australia in 1932&#150;3 he forged a resolute unity with Douglas Jardine, the England captain, after whom he named his second son.<br>
<br>R. E. S. Wyatt, England's captain in 1934, commented:<blockquote>one of Verity's chief assets was his ability to make the ball lift on a wet wicket and bounce on a dry one. Batsmen frequently found themselves playing the ball in the air when they thought they had got well over the top of it. (Hill, 144)</blockquote>His &#145;perching ball&#146; brought the downfall of many rivals. According to Bill Bowes, a close friend and bowling partner, the essence of his art was a &#145;marvellous control of length&#146; and a direction &#145;as straight as an arrow&#146;  (ibid.). He ran to the crease lightly and decisively over seven strides before delivering the ball at a pace quicker than most left-handers. He could contain batsmen, but was also devastating on helpful wickets. Jardine paid testimony to Verity's ability to place a field and bowl to it. During a decade dominated by batsmen, his ever present guile and acute brain brought a tally of 1956 wickets (average 14.90).<br>
<br>Verity presented a tall figure, with frank, friendly eyes, and a shy fearlessness. Nothing unsettled his dignified bearing; he showed a conspicuous absence of elation in victory, or disappointment in defeat. His conduct was in keeping with his reputation as a conscientious and disciplined professional, who practised a spartan regime. In the Second World War he proved as good a soldier as he was a cricketer. As a captain in the Green Howards he displayed courage of a high order in fierce action against German positions in Catania, Sicily. He sustained chest wounds from which he died, a prisoner of war, at the Italian military hospital at Caserta, near Naples, on 31 July 1943. He was buried in the military cemetery at Caserta, built and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. A memorial match was played at Roundhay Park, Leeds, in 1944, the proceeds going to endow a hospital bed bearing Verity's name at Leeds General Infirmary. In the following year a benefit match between Yorkshire and Lancashire for Verity's dependants took place at Bradford.<br>
