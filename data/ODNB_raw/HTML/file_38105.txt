<span class="headword">Warcup, Sir  Edmund</span>  (1627&#150;1712), <span class="occ">magistrate</span>, was born on 4 July 1627, one of twenty-one children of Samuel Warcup of English, near Henley, Oxfordshire, later bailiff of Southwark, and Anne Lenthall, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16467/', "William Lenthall")</script>, speaker of the Long Parliament. Warcup himself was to have a large family after his marriage to Anne Hudson (1623&#150;1713). It was Speaker Lenthall that (after Warcup's short stay at St Alban Hall, Oxford, and a sojourn aboard) used his influence to make him secretary to the parliamentary commissioners in the Isle of Wight in 1648.<br>
<br>In 1651 Warcup was at Lincoln's Inn, where a number of memoranda show him engaged in litigation, trusts, and Welsh land deals. However in spring 1660 he vainly produced papers to George Monck, first duke of Albemarle, and others to form the basis of a bill setting out terms for the restoration of Charles II. In January 1660 he became a captain in the regiment (formerly Fleetwood's) of Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper (later first earl of Shaftesbury), and the connection continued after the Restoration, when Shaftesbury was chancellor of the exchequer and Warcup, among other financial concessions, was a farmer of the excise in Wiltshire and Dorset, as well as justice of the peace in London. Warcup also availed himself further of his relationship to Monck. In February 1664 he succeeded to his father's office as bailiff of Southwark. In the following years he was active in combating the effects of the plague alongside his fellow justice Sir Edmund Godfrey. Unfortunately, Warcup presumed too much on his use of the name of Henry Bennet, earl of Arlington, to cover his own corrupt financial transactions and in July 1666 he was committed to the Fleet prison. He was eventually released about August 1666. Nevertheless Warcup was soon climbing into office again. Once more on the fringes of the court, he was involved in fruitless attempts to reconcile first John Maitland, first duke of Lauderdale, and then Thomas Osborne, first earl of Danby, with Shaftesbury in 1676 and 1677.<br>
<br>It was in the Popish Plot of 1678 that Warcup found most notoriety. A JP of Middlesex and Westminster for many years, he searched for papists and for popish books. He was noted as having a great zeal for the protestant religion, and his stated political views included a dislike of France and the activities of the duchess of Portsmouth in particular. In the aftermath of Oates's revelations, Warcup was employed by the committee of the House of Lords for the examination of witnesses, dominated by Shaftesbury. He subsequently claimed to have taken the information of over 100 witnesses, both English and Irish. Many of his activities are detailed in his private journal of 1676&#150;84, and he was in contact with most of the major informers of the day. As long as Shaftesbury was lord president of the council, Warcup found no difficulty in reconciling his loyalties, and even after Shaftesbury's dismissal in October 1679 he was used, following an hour's private conversation with the king alone in the royal bedchamber, in trying to bring Charles II and the earl together again. But in February 1681 many witnesses began to see more advantage in making themselves acceptable to the government than to the whigs, and in stating that attempts had been made to suborn them to give evidence. In that same month Warcup had several meetings with the king and his ministers Laurence Hyde, later first earl of Rochester, and Sir Leoline Jenkins; and on 4 March the council ordered him &pound;1500 by privy seal for his expenses. His dealing with the witnesses now had a different purpose, and he was employed to sift their information as they related to the alleged treason of Shaftesbury, sitting alongside the government solicitor Richard Graham.<br>
<br>After Shaftesbury's acquittal it was Warcup's turn to face counter-accusations of conspiracy to suborn witnesses, as well as (he said) being burnt in effigy with the pope, libelled in pamphlets, and assaulted in the streets. Reaction against Warcup's part in such affairs had already led him to make a strategic withdrawal to Oxfordshire in 1682. Indeed he spent most of that year there on his estate, Northmoor, near Eynsham. As compensation for his troubles he was knighted on 15 December 1684. Thereafter he spent most of his time peacefully employed with the expansion of his estates and his family (whose female members often proved quarrelsome), and in supporting the military careers of his two sons, Edmund and Lenthall, both of whom were killed in action at the battle of Steenkerke in 1692. Warcup had welcomed the accession of James II, but given his former politics he applauded the revolution of 1688, emerging politically in the 1690s as a church tory. Edmund Warcup died at Gaunt House, Northmoor, on 1 May 1712, and was buried in the family vault in the church of St Denys, Northmoor, leaving his wealth and estate to his wife, daughters, and grandchildren.<br>
<br>Warcup was typical of the many minor figures of his day in that he all too easily became involved in the Popish Plot and its politics. While he undoubtedly played fast and loose with the plot witnesses during his association with Shaftesbury, he soon switched sides when he thought it prudent. In his youth, about which little is known, Warcup had suffered from scrofula, until he was cured during the 1640s. According to Pepys, the affliction was said to have left Warcup allergic to roses, and for sport he could prove this to companions by touching his nose with the flower and bringing up a number of welts on his skin. In other respects, politics especially, Warcup was to prove equally as sensitive to the ebbs and flows of his age.<br>
