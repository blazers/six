<span class="headword">Vere,  Aubrey  de</span>, tenth earl of Oxford  (1338<span class="mult">x</span>40&#150;1400), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28212/', "John de Vere, the seventh earl (1312&#150;1360)")</script>, and his wife, Maud (<i>d</i>. 1366), one of the four daughters and coheirs of Giles, Lord Badlesmere (<i>d</i>. 1338). Aubrey de Vere had married Alice (<i>d</i>. 11 May 1400), daughter of the Essex landowner John, Lord Fitzwalter (<i>d</i>. 1361), by 1386. On 13 July 1360 Aubrey's mother had granted her son the stewardship of the royal forest of Havering, Essex, for life, and after her death he received her jointure in Sawston, Cambridgeshire, and Calverton, Buckinghamshire, which his father had entailed on him. De Vere sought a career in the service of Edward, the Black Prince, with whom he was in Aquitaine in July 1366. Presumably as a consequence of good service to the prince in the Castilian campaign of 1367, he was knighted, and then in October he was retained by Prince Edward for life with the handsome annuity of &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., later increased to &pound;100. He was acting as the prince's secretary in September 1371. That month his surviving elder brother, Thomas, earl of Oxford, died, leaving a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28218/', "Robert de Vere")</script>, aged nine, as his heir. On 22 July 1375 the Black Prince appointed de Vere constable of Wallingford Castle, Berkshire, and steward both of its honour and that of St Val&eacute;ry. De Vere's annuities were confirmed after the prince's death by the latter's son Richard, first as prince of Wales and afterwards as king.<br>
<br>Highly regarded by Richard's mother, Princess Joan, de Vere was among those servants of her husband (with a number of whom he had close personal links) who were to be at the heart of government in the early years of Richard II's minority. His later prominence had been foreshadowed at the end of Edward III's reign, when in 1377 Princess Joan sent him, with two other mediators, to try to compose the quarrel between her brother-in-law John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and the citizens of London (the mission had little success), and he was also appointed to a mission to negotiate with the French crown. De Vere was appointed to the continual council which was set up to govern the realm in the parliament of 1378, and which functioned from November 1378 to January 1380: he put in 113 days' attendance. By January 1381 he was chamberlain of the household (an office hereditary to the earls of Oxford), and in March was appointed on a commission to negotiate Richard's marriage to Anne of Bohemia. During the peasants' revolt, de Vere was one of those who were in the Tower of London with the king when the rebels seized the city, and he bore the king's sword when Richard went to negotiate with them at Mile End.<br>
<br>De Vere did not exploit his chamberlainship to augment his estates, apparently preferring to see his nephew Robert, heir to the poorly endowed earldom, ascend in royal favour. Indeed, he may have engineered Robert's admission to the royal household. De Vere seems rather to have chosen to concentrate on maintaining the family interest in its main regional sphere, Essex, by securing firm control of royal offices and demesne estates there. On 1 February 1378 he received a grant of the constableship of Hadleigh Castle, in return for the surrender of his earlier Wallingford grant. On 25 June 1379 he received the keepership for life of three royal Essex parks (Rayleigh, Thunderly, and Hadleigh), notwithstanding grants of them to other royal servants, and, on 8 January 1380 he was granted the keeping of Rochford hundred. On 30 November 1381 he was licensed to stay in Hadleigh Castle for life with his household. He was well placed to protect his interests even against the weight of the house of Lancaster. During the peasants' revolt, and again in May 1382, his tenants at Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire, attacked the men of Henry, earl of Derby, at Passenham, but Henry's attempt to gain redress from the king failed. On 4 October 1383 de Vere headed an embassy to negotiate with the French crown, and in 1385 he participated in Richard II's Scottish expedition, with a modest retinue of forty.<br>
<br>In 1387&#150;8 the defeat by the lords appellant of de Vere's nephew, Robert, by now duke of Ireland, Robert's flight abroad, and his subsequent conviction for treason in the Merciless Parliament of 1388, constituted a grave family set-back. De Vere was compelled to give up the chamberlainship, and in January 1388 was expelled from the royal household. However, he was respected by the lords appellant: he was allowed to keep all his royal grants, and was consulted by their leader, the duke of Gloucester, on how to respond to a diplomatic initiative from the duke of Burgundy. When Robert de Vere died in exile in 1392, Richard was able in the 1393 parliament to restore to Aubrey, as his nephew's heir, the forfeited title and estates of the earldom. However, Oxford vainly petitioned in the parliaments of 1394 and January 1397 for the restoration of the chamberlainship, which the king had granted in 1390 to his half-brother John Holland, earl of Huntingdon. The highly partisan Commons in the parliament of 1399 alleged that Oxford had abandoned his hereditary right because of Richard's menaces.<br>
<br>Richard may therefore have regarded Oxford as unimportant, insufficiently supportive in 1387&#150;8, and too closely connected with his opponents. The earl was on good terms with his wife's nephew Walter, Lord Fitzwalter, a friend of the duke of Gloucester, while on 3 August 1394 he was among the nobles who went surety for the earl of Arundel, who had highly offended the king. In 1399, however, the Commons alleged that Oxford's health and ability had grievously declined in the past few years. Henry refused their petition to restore the chamberlainship to him, after its surrender by Huntingdon. Oxford's expectation of his own demise is reflected in the indenture that he made with his feoffees, dated 1 November 1399, laying down the disposition of his properties in the case of Alice's surviving him, and during the minority of his son and heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101270/', "Richard de Vere, later eleventh earl of Oxford")</script>. His own experience as a younger son was reflected in the careful provision for the sustenance of his younger son John, for his education &#145;in the schools&#146;, and entail. In January 1400 Huntingdon (to whose daughter Oxford had married his son Richard) sought refuge at Hadleigh Castle, after the failure of the &#145;Epiphany plot&#146; to topple Henry IV; Oxford and his wife were there. The search was so intense that Huntingdon soon had to leave, to be caught and killed shortly afterwards. Oxford himself died less than two months later, on 23 April, probably at Hadleigh, and is likely to have been interred in the family's burial place, Earls Colne Priory, Essex.<br>
