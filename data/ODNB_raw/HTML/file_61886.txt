<span class="headword">Wrighten <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Pownall]</span>,  Mary Ann</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mary Matthews]</span>  (1751&#150;1796), <span class="occ">singer and actress</span>, was born in Hoxton, London, on 14 September 1751, the daughter of William Matthews (<i>d</i>. 1797) and his wife, Mary. Her father was variously described as a jeweller or a butcher, and at his death reportedly sold newspapers, but in his will he called himself a &#145;dealer in coals&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/1284, sig. 38). In adolescence she rebelled against the control of her parents and left home to live with an aunt. Wishing to become a professional singer, she was apprenticed to Edward Griffes, organist of St Dunstan in the East and a minor composer. She met the actor James Wrighten (1744/5&#150;1793) when they both appeared at the theatre in Birmingham in the summer of 1769 and they were married at St Matthew's, Bethnal Green, on 9 October. David Garrick engaged her for Drury Lane Theatre where, for her d&eacute;but on 8 February 1770, Charles Dibdin reworked his comic opera <span class="italic">Lionel and Clarissa</span> as <span class="italic">The School for Fathers</span>, with a demanding high soprano role for her as Diana. The prompter William Hopkins noted: &#145;a very fine Voice&#151;Aukward &amp; Clumsy figure&#151;Well faced&#146;  (Stone, 1454).<br>
<br>Mrs Wrighten remained a leading singer at Drury Lane for over sixteen years, &#145;the prop of burlettas, and, mistress of mirth&#146;  (Pasquin, 41). During this time she played well over seventy different roles in comic operas, musical afterpieces, and plays. A favourite performer at Vauxhall Gardens, she appeared there every summer from 1777 to 1786 under its musical director James Hook, who wrote many songs for her. Her performance of C. T. Carter's rousing hunting song &#145;Tally Ho&#146; was popular both at Vauxhall and in the theatre. Mrs Wrighten also sang in Handel's <span class="italic">Messiah</span> and Felice Giardini's <span class="italic">Ruth</span> at the Foundling Hospital in March 1774 and in Lent oratorio seasons at the theatres in 1776 and 1778&#150;80. She composed songs which she sang herself; five of these were published in the 1780s, including two ballads for which she also wrote the words, &#145;Kiss me Now or Never&#146; and &#145;Young Willy&#146;.<br>
<br>James Wrighten became the prompter of the Haymarket summer theatre in 1785 and of Drury Lane in autumn 1786 and was considerably more successful in this role than he had been as an actor. The Wrightens had at least six children, of whom three survived childhood, Sarah and the twins Mary Ann and Charlotte Sophia (<i>b</i>. 1778). Childbirth gave Mary Wrighten only brief respites from the stage, and she was seriously ill in May 1784 and January 1786. Her marriage broke down acrimoniously in late December 1786, when she left her husband and daughters, abandoned the theatre and went to live in Tooley Street, Southwark, with Hugh Pownall (<i>d</i>. in or after 1807), a manufacturer of oil of vitriol. There was much gossip in the newspapers and her father cut her off with a shilling in his will, made in June 1787.<br>
<br>In autumn 1792, with Hugh Pownall and their young son Felix (1790/91&#150;1796), she arrived in Philadelphia, and as Mrs Pownall made her d&eacute;but there with the Old American Theatre Company on 10 October. She remained with the company during their extended seasons in New York and briefer ones in Philadelphia until summer 1795. Having broken her leg in autumn 1793, she appeared on crutches on 26 December at the John Street Theatre, New York, to sing several favourite ballads in an afterpiece written for the occasion. Mrs Pownall was much praised for her serious singing in concerts: &#145;Her voice was round, full and deliciously sweet, and her manner grand and impressive&#146;  (<span class="italic">Euterpeiad</span>, 187). Her New York concerts were organized by James Hewitt, a music publisher, and they collaborated in <span class="italic">Six Songs for the Harpsichord or Pianoforte, Composed by Mrs. Pownal and J. Hewitt</span> (1794). Her contributions were &#145;Jemmy of the Glen&#146;, &#145;The Straw Bonnet&#146;, and &#145;Lavinia&#146;. Two more of her songs, &#145;Kisses Sue'd For&#146; and &#145;The Labyrinth of Love&#146;, were published in New York by George Gilfert.<br>
<br>James Wrighten died in April 1793. Hugh Pownall and Mary Ann Wrighten (she seems to have added the extra name in the United States) were married in New York on 17 April 1794. In London, &#145;the Orphan Daughters of the late Mr Wrighten, prompter&#146;  (Hogan, 1542) had been given benefits at both Drury Lane and the Haymarket and the twins sang in the chorus at these theatres in spring and summer 1794. The following year Mary and Charlotte joined their mother in America. In early October 1795 they performed in her concerts in Boston, with their four-year-old half-brother, who made his d&eacute;but singing &#145;Little Felix is my Name&#146;. Mrs Pownall and her daughters were then engaged by John Sollee for the City Theatre, Charleston. After a busy and successful winter at the theatre and in concerts, she gave birth to a daughter, Louisa Delia, in mid-April 1796. The Charleston summer theatre season was cut short by an epidemic of yellow fever and the family planned to return to England, advertising their final concert for 6 August. However, on 1 August the seventeen-year-old Charlotte eloped and married the much older acrobat and dancer Alexandre Placide, who had been living with another woman as his wife, and her distraught mother cancelled the concert.<br>
<br>Mrs Pownall died on 12 August 1796, still at Charleston, South Carolina, reportedly of a broken heart but probably of yellow fever. She was buried at St Philip's Church, Charleston, probably on 13 August. Felix Pownall was buried two days before his mother died and Mary Wrighten succumbed to fever on 24 August. Louisa Delia died the following summer, but Hugh Pownall survived to settle in New York as a druggist, where he was still alive in 1807, and Charlotte Placide became the mother of a famous family of American actors. Mary Ann Pownall was considered &#145;the best vocalist yet heard in America&#146;  (Ireland, 98) and was the first female composer to have music published in the United States.<br>
