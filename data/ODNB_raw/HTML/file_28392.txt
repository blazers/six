<span class="headword">Wafer,  Lionel</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1705), <span class="occ">surgeon and buccaneer</span>, may have been of Huguenot descent. His knowledge of Gaelic, and a boyhood spent in Scotland and Ireland, may indicate that his father was a Scottish soldier quartered in Ireland, or that the family was one of those &#145;planted&#146; in Ireland by James I or Oliver Cromwell. Wafer claimed to have been &#145;very young&#146;  (Wafer, 1) when, in 1677, he embarked as surgeon's assistant on the <i>Great Anne</i>, an East India Company vessel. After transferring into the <i>Bombay Merchant</i> at Sumatra he visited Borneo before returning to England in March 1679. A month later Wafer left for Jamaica to visit his brother; he worked briefly as a surgeon in Port Royal before joining the privateer Captain Edmund Cook. Cook joined a squadron of buccaneering vessels at Golden Island, and it was here that Wafer first met William Dampier. On 5 April 1680 he disembarked as part of a force of some 330 buccaneers who intended to cross the Isthmus of Darien and raid Panama. On entering the Bay of Panama the buccaneers, led by Captain Bartholomew Sharpe, seized several armed vessels, and broke out along the Pacific coast from Costa Rica to southern Chile in search of prizes.<br>
<br>On 17 April 1681, dissatisfied with Sharpe's leadership, Wafer, Dampier, and fifty-two others defected near the Isle of Plate and travelled nearly 600 miles, in three open boats, to reach the coast of Panama. On 5 May, during their subsequent return march overland, Wafer injured his leg when some gunpowder was accidentally ignited. Four days later a slave stole his medicines, his gun, and all his money, and Wafer &#145;was left among the wild Indians&#146;  (Wafer, sig. A3).<br>
<br>The Cuna Indians cured Wafer's injury, and he in turn practised &#145;Physick and Phlebotomy&#146;. After four months it became clear that the Indians intended Wafer to marry among them. On the pretext of travelling to England to fetch hunting dogs, and promising to return, Wafer escaped to the Atlantic coast where he boarded a French vessel commanded by Captain Tristian. Dampier, and others with whom he had defected, were on the vessel but none of them recognized the surgeon. &#145;I sat a while cringing upon my Hams among the <i>Indians</i>, after their Fashion&#146;, he writes in his journal &#145;painted as they were, and all naked but only about the Waist, and with my Nose-piece&#146;  (Wafer, 41&#150;2).<br>
<br>After cruising in the Caribbean with Captain Yanky, Wafer sailed with John Cook in the <i>Revenge</i> to Chesapeake Bay, arriving in April 1683. On 23 August he and Dampier sailed from Virginia for the South Sea under Cook, and later, when off Sierra Leone, they transferred into a prize renamed the <i>Batchelor's Delight</i>. From 19 March 1684 they kept company with the <i>Nicholas</i> and in May they became the first English crews to visit the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands. In October the <i>Batchelor's Delight</i> (Captain Eaton) joined the <i>Cygnet</i> (Captain Swan), and both crews collaborated in an assault on Paita on 2 November. News of the imminent arrival of the silver fleet at Panama prompted both vessels to join nearly 1000 French and English buccaneers assembled at the Pearl Islands, in February 1685. Here Wafer participated in an indecisive action against a superior Spanish fleet at the end of May.<br>
<br>The <i>Batchelor's Delight</i> left the Bay of Panama in July 1685, and cruised north to Cocos Island, south to the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands, and south again to Juan Fernandez, where she spent Christmas 1686. In the autumn of 1687, having replenished once more at the Gal&aacute;pagos, the buccaneers rounded the Horn. As the ship sailed northwards towards the Caribbean, Wafer transferred to a vessel bound for Pennsylvania. After a brief stay in Philadelphia he and two others made for Point Comfort in Virginia where Wafer intended to settle.<br>
<br>On 22 June 1688 Wafer and his companions were arrested by Captain Simon Rowe, commanding officer of HMS <i>Dumbarton</i>, as they crossed Chesapeake Bay in a small boat. They were imprisoned in Jamestown on suspicion of piracy. Wafer declared he had been a trader in the West Indies for seven years. He denied stoutly ever having been a privateer and he signed his depositions &#145;Delawafer&#146;. His defence was weakened, however, by the inventory of his effects taken at the time of his arrest, which included thirty-seven silver plates, some silver lace, and three bags of Spanish money marked with his initials, containing about 1100 dollars. Despite calls by Lord Sutherland of the council of trade and plantation for Wafer to be prosecuted, he was released in September 1689, whereupon he returned to England after an absence of nearly eleven years. In March 1692 it was agreed that Wafer's property should be restored to him, but a royal order withheld &pound;300, plus a quarter of the amount still in Jamestown. The moneys forfeited may have been applied to the building of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. In November 1693 the council of Virginia invited creditors to come forward, perhaps indicating that full restitution had still not taken place at that date.<br>
<br>In England Wafer established himself as the foremost authority on the Darien isthmus. Dampier deferred to Wafer for descriptions of Darien, claiming he &#145;is better able to do it than any man that I know&#146;  (Dampier, 24). On 2 July 1697, following Dampier's recommendation, Wafer was interviewed by John Locke and the other commissioners of the council of trade and plantation concerning Darien and the projected Scots' colony. Wafer's knowledge of Darien was also sought by the directors of the Darien Company, and the advice he gave them almost certainly influenced the siting of the disastrous Scots' colony in 1698.<br>
<br>Wafer was invited to visit the company's directors in Edinburgh in the spring of 1698. He travelled to Scotland as Mr Brown of London, and stayed with Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun where he met the directors before removing to a secret garret in Edinburgh. Having been engaged by the company, Wafer ordered his affairs in preparation for a voyage to Darien, but a mysterious breach dissolved these plans. In the same year he provided the duke of Leeds with a report on the key ports along America's Pacific rim which might be seized from Spain if they remained shut to foreign traders. His analysis of the strategic and commercial advantages of securing the Chilean ports of Coquimbo and Valdivia, for English vessels rounding the Horn, bears striking resemblance to a scheme Daniel Defoe was to lay before Robert Harley in July 1711.<br>
<br>Lionel Wafer is best known today as the author of <span class="italic">A New Voyage and Description of the Isthmus of America</span> (1699), a work which retains interest for modern anthropologists because of its detailed descriptions of Darien and the Cuna Indians. In dedicating the second edition (1704) to the duke of Marlborough, Wafer stressed the feasibility of English settlement in Darien, despite the Scots' disaster. A popular figure among the buccaneers, Wafer was a resilient man of unquestionable intelligence, who may have enjoyed connections with the Royal Society after his return to England. Between 1699 and his death in 1705 he lived in London.<br>
