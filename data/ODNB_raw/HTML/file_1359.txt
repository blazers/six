<span class="headword">Bardolf,  Hugh</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1203), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was the son of Hugh Bardolf (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1176), a Lincolnshire knight, and of Isabel, possibly of the Twist family of South Carlton, Lincolnshire. In 1200 he married Mabel de Limesy, daughter of Gerard de Limesy, and sister and coheir of John de Limesy (<i>d</i>. 1193), baron of Cavendish in Suffolk. Bardolf is first recorded in attendance on the royal court at Chinon on 5 April 1181, where he attested a charter as steward, a post which he retained until the end of Henry II's reign in 1189. He acted as a royal justice almost annually between <i>c</i>.1185 and 1203, more often as a justice in eyre than at Westminster; he sat as a justice following the king during John's early visits to England in 1200&#150;01. He also acted as sheriff of Cornwall (1184&#150;7), Wiltshire (1187&#150;9), Somerset and Dorset (1188&#150;9), Staffordshire, Warwickshire, and Leicestershire (1190&#150;91), Yorkshire (1191&#150;4), Westmorland (1191&#150;9), Northumberland (1194&#150;8), Cumberland (1198&#150;9), Cornwall and Devon (1199&#150;1200), and Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire (1200&#150;03).<br>
<br>Bardolf set out with Richard I on his journey to the Holy Land and was one of Richard's sureties at Messina in November 1190, but returned to England soon afterwards, and was associated in the justiciarship with the bishops of Durham (Hugh du Puiset) and Ely (William Longchamp) while the king was on crusade. He was involved, with Walter de Coutances, in the commission that was to supplant Longchamp; accordingly, he was among those excommunicated by Longchamp, but was offered pardon if he would surrender Scarborough and his counties of Yorkshire and Westmorland. In 1193, as associate justiciar and sheriff of Yorkshire, he assisted the archbishop of York to fortify Doncaster for Richard, but refusing, as John's vassal, to besiege Tickhill, was denounced as a traitor, and on Richard's return, in March 1194, was dismissed from his Yorkshire post. He was at once, however, transferred to Northumberland, and ordered to take it over from the bishop of Durham, then, on the latter's resistance, to seize it (July 1194). At du Puiset's death, on 3 March 1195, the castles of Norham and Durham were surrendered to Bardolf, who, remaining faithful to Richard, retained his counties until John's accession in 1199. From John he received the counties of Nottingham and Derby and the custody of Tickhill Castle.<br>
<br>Bardolf continued to act as an itinerant justice and to sit in the royal court until his death some time before Michaelmas in 1203. He won some reputation as a legal expert, for he was one of the few justices to be mentioned by name in early texts of Glanville. He was also a financial expert, appearing from the rolls to have acted as a baron of the exchequer in all three reigns. He was escheator for the north of England, 1194&#150;7, one of the keepers of the Jews, 1194&#150;7, and responsible for the stannaries, 1199&#150;1200. Bardolf held considerable property at his death, for his brother offered a &pound;1000 fine for his inheritance; and William (III) de Briouze offered &pound;1000 to marry his son to Hugh's widow. Hugh and his wife had no children, and Hugh's heir was his brother Robert Bardolf.<br>
