<span class="headword">Coltman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Todd]</span>,  Constance Mary</span>  (1889&#150;1969), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and the first woman to be ordained to the Christian ministry in Britain</span>, was born in Putney, London, on 23 May 1889, the oldest of the four children of George Todd (1844&#150;1912), headmaster and educational administrator, and Emily Ellerman, one of the first generation of women to study medicine and a member of the wealthy shipping family. She was educated at St Felix School, Southwold, from where she won an exhibition to read history at Somerville College, Oxford (1908&#150;11). The family's love of travel helped to inculcate an early and strong international outlook.<br>
<br>The Todd family were members of the Presbyterian Church of England, and it was to that church that Constance Todd first turned when she became convinced of a vocation to ordained ministry. When that door was closed she visited the principal of Mansfield College, Oxford, W. B. Selbie, and convinced him that her vocation was genuine. She was admitted to Mansfield for preparation for the Congregational ministry in 1913 and completed the course with some distinction within three years. During these years she acquired her deep interest in Hebrew, took an active part in college life, and met and became engaged to a fellow student, Claud Marshall Coltman (1889&#150;1971). She described herself as a &#145;suffragist&#146;, but took no active part in the suffrage movement. Her lifelong abhorrence of violence led her to take a pacifist stance and to active membership of the Fellowship of Reconciliation.<br>
<br>Drawn to the preaching of the Presbyterian pacifist William Edwin Orchard, she became a member of his (Congregational) church, the King's Weigh House, London, in 1917. In the summer of that year she and her fianc&eacute; received a call to take charge of the Weigh House's mission in the East End of London. On 17 September they were both &#145;solemnly ordained to the Holy Ministry by the laying on of hands and invocation of the Holy Ghost&#146;  (King's Weigh House Church meeting minute book). Orchard (who eighteen years later became a Roman Catholic priest) was the presiding minister, assisted by three Congregational ministers. The following day the two were married. Constance Coltman's ordination was officially recognized by the Congregational Union Council two months later, and her name subsequently appeared in the lists of accredited ministers of the Congregational Union of England and Wales. Other women began to follow her example, though very slowly at first.<br>
<br>After three years at Darby Street, east London, the Coltmans had a series of joint ministries at Kilburn; Cowley Road, Oxford; Wolverton, Buckinghamshire; and Haverhill, Suffolk, before a return to the Weigh House in 1946. They shared the ministerial work according to the particular needs and wishes of the church. They also brought up their family of two daughters and a son.<br>
<br>Constance Coltman believed that women had a distinctive contribution to bring to the interpretation and commendation of Christian theology, and to the practice of Christian ministry, especially through the experience of motherhood. She was an active member of the Society of Free Catholics, an ecumenical society founded by J. M. Lloyd Thomas, and contributed to its journal.<br>
<br>In 1927 Coltman was elected president of the new Fellowship of Women Ministers, which arose out of a conference in the previous year, and three years later helped to found the interdenominational Society for the Ministry of Women, of which she was a vice-president, and in which she was active for many years. She offered valuable support to younger women who felt called to ministry not only in Britain but elsewhere in Europe. She was a close friend of the Anglican preacher Maude Royden, with whom she collaborated in writing <span class="italic">The Church and Woman</span> (1924).<br>
<br>Throughout her active life Coltman was involved in peace movements. She was a vice-president of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and one of the founders of the Christian Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. She retired from active ministry in 1949, and after her husband's retirement in 1957 moved to Bexhill for her remaining years. She died on 26 March 1969. A memorial service was held on 26 April at Whitefield Memorial Church in London.<br>
