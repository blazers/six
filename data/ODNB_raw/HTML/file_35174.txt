<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Muybridge,  Eadweard James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Edward James Muggeridge]</span>  (1830&#150;1904), <span class="occ">developer of motion photography</span>, was born on 9 April 1830 at Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, the second of four sons of John Muggeridge (1797&#150;1843), corn chandler, of Kingston, and his wife, Susannah (1807/8&#150;1874), daughter of the Smith barge-owning family of Hampton Wick. Nothing is known of his education and upbringing. By the time he emigrated to New York in the early 1850s, he had changed his name to Eadweard Muybridge (probably inspired by the recent discovery in Kingston of a Saxon coronation stone memorializing two King Eadweards). He soon prospered in the business of importing English books, and by 1855 his befriending of the New York daguerreotypist Silas T. Selleck brought him into contact with the emerging art of photography. In his later <span class="italic">Animals in Motion</span> Muybridge recalled studying with interest during this period the flight of seabirds.<br>
<br>Following Selleck and the gold rush to California, Muybridge moved to the burgeoning city of San Francisco in 1855, establishing a bookstore at 113 Montgomery Street. He became an active member of the literary community, serving on the board of the Mercantile Library Association and also selling photographs in his bookshop. His ingenuity in mechanical devices was demonstrated by his taking out a patent in 1860 for improvements to printing and another in 1861 for machinery for washing cloth. A younger brother George (1833&#150;1858) joined him in business, but George's early death from tuberculosis brought in another brother, Thomas (1835&#150;1923). An 1860 business and vacation trip to Europe was cut short by a stagecoach accident in Texas, in which Muybridge was so seriously injured that his doctor, Sir William Gull, recommended an active outdoor life for recovery.<br>
<br>Between 1860 and 1866 Muybridge travelled between England, New York, and the continent. Some time during this period a Kingston friend, Arthur Brown, taught him wet plate photography, and about 1866 he returned to San Francisco where he joined Silas Selleck in his photography business. By 1868 he offered splendid views of Yosemite under the name of &#145;Helios&#146;.<br>
<br>Muybridge emerged as a highly talented and ingenious photographer, building an extensive catalogue of views of the American west, recording the emerging San Francisco, and accepting various positions as photographer for government boards and expeditions. His reputation as a leading photographer led to an 1872 commission that changed his professional life. Former governor Leland Stanford, the wealthy president of the Central Pacific Railroad and an avid horse racer, hired him to provide scientific evidence whether a horse could ever have all four feet off the ground at once. By contriving a high speed shutter and speeding up his exposure by recording only a silhouette of the horse against white sheets, in May 1872 Muybridge made several negatives of Occident, Stanford's celebrated horse, as it trotted laterally in front of his camera at the speed of 38 feet per second. These experiments, which showed that the horse's four feet were at times all off the ground, were further developed in 1873. In the same year he photographed the Modoc Indian war, and continued his western views.<br>
<br>In 1871 Muybridge married Flora Shallcross Stone (1851&#150;1875), a divorcee half his age. The birth of a son in 1874 led to his discovering that the true father was Harry Larkyns, an English drama critic and adventurer. Enraged, he shot and killed his rival. He was acquitted of the charge of murder in an emotional trial, and quickly escaped to Central America, photographing for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. He was formally divorced in the same year. One of his first efforts on his return to San Francisco early in 1876 was an enormous panoramic view of the city. In 1877 he proposed photographing on a reduced scale the official records of San Jose (an approach directly akin to modern microfilming). He again took up photographing horses in motion, now under Stanford's sponsorship at his stud farm in Palo Alto, California.<br>
<br>The photographs for Muybridge's earliest experiments had been made with a single camera, and required a separate trotting for each exposure. His 1877 experiments carried out a suggestion first made by Oscar Gustav Rejdlander, of employing a number of cameras placed in a line, thus obtaining a succession of exposures at regulated intervals of time. Twelve electrically tripped cameras were arranged in a line, pointing at a measured backdrop. Six views were published in 1878 under the title of <span class="italic">The Horse in Motion</span>. In his analysis of the quadrupedal walk, Muybridge's investigations led to much modification of the treatment of animal movements in the works of painters and sculptors. In 1878 Muybridge patented his &#145;method and apparatus for photographing objects in motion&#146;. His battery of cameras was expanded to twenty-four and his subject matter extended, first to animals other than the horse, and by 1879 to the study of the human figure in motion (the latter possibly inspired by correspondence with the painter, Thomas Eakins). By then Stanford had spent more than $42,000 on supporting Muybridge's studies. Muybridge's work had captured the attention of the French scientist and photographer &Eacute;tienne Jules Marey, professor at the Coll&egrave;ge de France, and his active promotion of Muybridge's pioneering efforts did much to establish him in the scientific world.<br>
<br>In 1878 the editor of the <span class="italic">Scientific American</span> suggested mounting Muybridge's sequence photographs in a zoetrope, a popular children's toy based on the phenakistoscope, that utilized slits to give an illusion of continuous movement to the images inside. In 1869 Sir John Herschel (in the same article in which he coined the term &#145;snapshot&#146;), had prophesied that photographs might one day be used in the phenakistoscope to show continuous motion. A decade later Muybridge, using a device he called the Zo&ouml;praxiscope, became the first to exhibit photographic motion pictures taken from life. It was a direct step towards modern film-making, and was a popular device. By its means horse races were reproduced on a screen with such fidelity as to show the individual characteristics of the motion of each animal, flocks of birds flew with every movement of their wings clearly perceptible, two gladiators contended for victory, athletes turned somersaults, and the like. At Marey's home in Paris in September 1881 Muybridge lectured before the assembled men of science with his newly animated illustrations for the first time in Europe. He then lectured in London, before the Royal Institution, the Royal Academy of Arts, the Royal Society of Arts, and the Royal Society.<br>
<br>With such enthusiastic reception, Muybridge was on the verge of transferring his base of operations to his native England. He was invited to prepare a paper on animal locomotion for the Royal Society. Just days before this was to be published, he was summoned to its rooms and confronted with Dr J. B. Stillman's just released book, <span class="italic">The Horse in Motion</span>, which illustrated Muybridge's photographs through drawings. Published by Muybridge's patron, Leland Stanford, the book made absolutely no mention of Muybridge's contribution, and it is understandable that the society viewed him as a plagiarist. Francis Galton, acting as referee, diplomatically referred to concern about photographs to which Muybridge had &#145;no sure legal claim&#146;, but the immediate damage was done. Muybridge's standing in Britain was destroyed. Stanford's actions were never satisfactorily explained, and legal actions instituted by Muybridge failed to redress the situation.<br>
<br>During a lecture tour of American cities in 1883 Muybridge circulated a prospectus for a massive reference work of animal locomotion. Numerous backers were found in Philadelphia, and the University of Pennsylvania became his scientific home. Specially constructed apparatus allowed the photographing of a living, moving subject from several angles simultaneously. Improved photographic materials finally enabled him to give these photographs full tones, rather than work with the silhouettes he had previously been restricted to. In 1884&#150;5 more than a hundred thousand photographic plates were obtained and embodied in a work published at Philadelphia in 1887 as <span class="italic">Animal locomotion, an electrophotographic investigation of consecutive phases of animal movement, 1872&#150;1885</span>. The work contains over two thousand figures of moving men, women, children, beasts, and birds, in 781 photo-engravings, bound in eleven folio volumes. The great cost of preparing and printing this work restricted its sale to a very few complete sets, and a selection of the most important plates on a reduced scale was published in London in 1899 as <span class="italic">Animals in Motion</span>.<br>
<br>For several years Muybridge, now more respected than ever, alternated between England and America. In 1892 he lectured on animal locomotion in a specially built hall at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Legal problems continued to plague him, but from 1894, apart from a visit to America in 1897, he lived in his native Kingston, residing with a cousin at Park View, 2 Liverpool Road and actively corresponding with publications. He died on 8 May 1904, while digging a miniature scale reproduction of the Great Lakes in his garden. His cremated remains were buried at Woking. He left &pound;300 to Kingston Public Library, together with his lantern slides, Zo&ouml;praxiscope, and a selection from the plates of <span class="italic">Animal Locomotion</span>.<br>
