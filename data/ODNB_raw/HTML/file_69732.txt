<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blyden,  Edward Wilmot</span>  (1832&#150;1912), <span class="occ">advocate of pan-Africanism</span>, was born on 3 August 1832 on the island of St Thomas (then under Danish rule) in the West Indies. He was the third of the seven children of Romeo Blyden, a tailor, and his wife, Judith, a schoolteacher. He later claimed that his background was of &#145;pure Negro&#146; parentage from the Igbo people of eastern Nigeria  (Lynch, 3). Edward Blyden was, however, brought up in a largely Jewish and English-speaking community, and with his family attended services of the integrated Dutch Reformed church. In 1842 the Blydens moved to Venezuela, returning about 1845. Influenced by the Revd John P. Knox and his wife, Edward Blyden applied in 1850 to Rutgers Theological College, USA, but was rejected because of his colour; but he remained in the USA with the Knoxes. He met a number of religious leaders involved in the African Colonization Society. Encouraged by them, he went to Monrovia, in recently independent Liberia. There he became a lay preacher in 1853, and soon after a tutor at Alexander high school.<br>
<br>In 1856 Blyden published his first pamphlet, <span class="italic">A Voice from Bleeding Africa</span>, and married Sarah Yates, the mixed-race niece of G. P. Yates, vice-president of Liberia. The marriage was not happy, Blyden blaming this on his wife's loyalty to the mixed-race community, of which he became a &#145;fanatical opponent&#146;  (Lynch, 39); there may also have been other sources of discord. The Blydens had three children. Blyden was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1858, being promoted at the same time to be principal of the high school. He conducted a considerable correspondence with prominent people in English-speaking countries, among them W. E. Gladstone, who advised him on classical studies and sent him books on Homer. In 1861 Blyden was appointed Liberian educational commissioner, travelling to the USA and Britain on a tour to lecture, fund-raise, and encourage African-Americans to emigrate to Liberia. In Britain he met Gladstone and other prominent persons, Gladstone offering to support him at a British university. Blyden turned down the offer and on his return to Liberia taught classics at Liberia College. He served as secretary of state from 1864 to 1866, but in 1871 left Liberia for Sierra Leone after a quarrel with Edward James Roye, the new president and hitherto his friend, over an expensive British loan to Liberia (Blyden was declared innocent of the charge of adultery with Roye's wife). He was able after Roye's death to return to Liberia again to head the high school, and from 1877 to 1879 was Liberian minister in London. He was disappointed at his failure to gain financial support for his country. He was minister of the interior in 1880&#150;82 and again president of Liberia College in 1880&#150;84. Once more in exile in Sierra Leone, he ran unsuccessfully for the presidency of Liberia in 1885. He was again minister in London in 1892, and was special envoy in Paris and London in 1905. From 1906 to 1910 he was director of Muslim education in Sierra Leone. His health deteriorating, he was operated on for an aneurysm of the knee in the Royal Southern Hospital, Liverpool, in 1909. The Colonial Office arranged a pension of &pound;25 in 1910 (subscribed by the governments of Sierra Leone, Lagos, and the Gold Coast). Blyden died in Sierra Leone, at his home in Rawden Street, Freetown, on 12 February 1912; his coffin was carried by Muslims to the graveyard at Freetown racecourse, where he was given a Christian burial.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Blyden published widely on race and pan-Africanism. In the Liberian context his views were highly controversial because his concept of the &#145;negro&#146; largely excluded people of mixed heritage. His hope was that &#145;pure negroes&#146; would return to Africa and provide an educated &eacute;lite to lead the continent to freedom. He encouraged Christian&#150;Muslim understanding in Africa. Disappointed by the failure of African-Americans to return to west Africa to provide leadership, he came to see European expansionism as a necessary phase in African development. He consequently supported British expansionism in west Africa, hoping that Sierra Leone would develop into a major west African state. He preferred Britain's localist approach to government in Africa, and strongly opposed the French policy of seeing African territory as an integral part of French government and culture. Blyden worked with Mary Kingsley to encourage a better British understanding of African social systems. He was himself a strong defender, in principle as well as practice, of polygamy. From 1876 he lived with Anna Erskine (a black schoolteacher from Louisiana), though still married and spasmodically living with Sarah, from whom he never formally separated; this probably prompted his resignation from the Presbyterian church in 1886.<br>
<br>Blyden's collected articles, <span class="italic">Christianity, Islam and the Negro Race</span> (1886), with an introduction by Sir Samuel Lewis, created a considerable impact, being published just after the Berlin conference which arranged the partition. In all he published some twenty-nine books and pamphlets. Blyden was important in Africa as a person articulating many of its future concerns, both accepting the imperial phase and already looking past it. In Britain he represented African intelligence of a high order, with an imposing physical presence, at a time when a sense of racial superiority was in danger of becoming instinctive.<br>
