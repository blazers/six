<span class="headword">Redding,  (David) Noel</span>  (1945&#150;2003), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born on 25 December 1945 at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Folkestone, Kent, the son of Horace Albert Redding (1906&#150;1970), a tutor at the Midland Bank training school and former flight lieutenant in the RAF, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Berggren (1914&#150;2003). At the time of his birth registration his family lived in Hythe, Kent. He had a brother, Anthony (<i>b</i>. 1942), and a sister, Vicki (<i>b</i>. 1948). He took up guitar at the age of fourteen and turned professional at seventeen. He played in several bands without success, culminating in the Loving Kind, who released three singles on the Piccadilly label in 1966. Ready to leave the music business, in September 1966 his luck changed when an advertisement in <span class="italic">Melody Maker</span> drew him to an audition where he found himself asked to play bass for a new group that would feature an American guitarist, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65770/', "Jimi Hendrix")</script>. It was a much-needed opportunity, though Redding had never played bass before. A second rehearsal in Soho bonded Redding and Hendrix with the drummer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/100588/', "Mitch Mitchell")</script>. By mid-October the Jimi Hendrix Experience were playing concerts, and by December their cover of &#145;Hey Joe&#146; was a hit, giving them television exposure.<br>
<br>&#145;Hey Joe&#146; was followed into the charts by &#145;Purple Haze&#146;, whose stridently dissonant two-bar introduction memorably pitted Redding's bass octave E against an octave B[flat] on guitar, and then by &#145;The Wind Cries Mary&#146;, as well as a d&eacute;but LP, <span class="italic">Are You Experienced</span>. Redding also played on the second album, <span class="italic">Axis: Bold As Love</span> (1967) and on some of <span class="italic">Electric Ladyland</span> (1968), but not on &#145;Voodoo Chile&#146; and &#145;All Along the Watchtower&#146;. Much to his frustration, the Jimi Hendrix Experience released only two songs by Redding, &#145;She's So Fine&#146; and &#145;Little Miss Strange&#146;. Other songs of his were worked on but none was released until the issue of <span class="italic">The Experience Sessions</span> on CD in 2004. The limitations of Redding's guitaristic bass-playing suited the Experience, as he kept things simple, put chords in his parts which filled out the trio's live sound, and functioned as anchor for both Hendrix's and Mitchell's freewheeling playing. But on extended blues like &#145;Hear My Train a-Coming&#146; his task as bassist could be monotonous.<br>
<br>Redding grew increasingly frustrated with his role in the Jimi Hendrix Experience, irritated by protracted recording sessions, hangers-on in the studio, and Hendrix's desire to use guest musicians. When Chas Chandler walked out during the recording of <span class="italic">Electric Ladyland</span> in 1968 he advised Redding to do likewise. Redding later believed that he made himself unpopular by asking too many questions about the band's earnings. Constant touring, drugs, and the stress of fame led to tensions within the band, and increased disillusionment. Redding stayed put, but in late 1968 formed his own group, Fat Mattress, with whom he played lead guitar, and persuaded Hendrix and his management to allow the band to support the Experience on tour. Hendrix took to referring to them as &#145;Thin Pillow&#146;. Redding recorded two albums with Fat Mattress before the group split up in 1970.<br>
<br>Redding played his last gig with the Jimi Hendrix Experience in June 1969 in Denver, when Hendrix announced from the stage that the band was splitting. Redding flew home to London and told the music press that he had resigned. In 1970 Hendrix toyed with reforming the Experience but decided he could not work with Redding again; Redding was not told this until he had flown to the USA for the reunion.<br>
<br>Redding subsequently guested on many records including <span class="italic">Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends</span> (1970). A solo album, &#145;Nervous Breakdown&#146;, was financed by Redding but not released, which, along with the end of his marriage to Susanne M. Fonsby (whom he had married on 6 November 1969), was the start of financial and alcohol problems. Some stability was found with a second partner, Carol Appleby, and a home at Dunowen House in Clonakilty, co. Cork, Ireland, with four acres of gardens and sea views. He continued to play with groups including Road and the Noel Redding Band. On Friday nights he invariably played in De Barra's pub in Clonakilty. Financial difficulties forced the sale of the Fender Jazz bass he had played while performing with Hendrix, and in 1974 he signed away income from future Hendrix releases for a one-off payment of $100,000. In February 2003 he instigated fresh legal proceedings against the Experience Hendrix company for more than &pound;3 million in lost earnings. It was estimated that by that time the royalties from the issue of Jimi Hendrix Experience recordings had earned more than $300 million.<br>
<br>In the 1990s Redding was offered Irish citizenship in recognition of his contribution to Irish music and the arts. In 1992 the Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Cleveland rock and roll hall of fame; Redding described this and playing the Monterey pop festival in June 1967 as the highlights of his life. With Carol Appleby he wrote <span class="italic">Are You Experienced: the Inside Story of the Jimi Hendrix Experience</span> (1990), drawing on his diaries. Carol was killed in a car-crash two days after it was finished. He later formed an enduring partnership with Deborah McNaughton, a Canadian artist. In 2002 Carl Fischer Music Ltd published <span class="italic">The Noel Redding Bass Guitar Method</span>. He died suddenly at home (Dunowen House, Clonakilty) from haemorrhage secondary to cirrhosis of the liver on 11 May 2003. After a funeral at St James's Church, Ardfield, on 18 May, he was cremated, and his ashes scattered in the garden of Dunowen House. He was survived by his partner Deborah and a son from his marriage, Nicolas Noel Redding (<i>b</i>. 1970).<br>
