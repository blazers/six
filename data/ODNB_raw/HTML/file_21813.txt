<span class="headword">Pelham,  Edward</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1630&#150;1631), <span class="occ">sailor</span>, was a gunner's mate on board the <i>Salutation</i> of London in the service of the company of Muscovy merchants. On 1 May 1630 the <i>Salutation</i>, with two other vessels, under the command of Captain William Goodler, sailed for the north-west coast of Greenland on a whaling trip. On reaching the Foreland the <i>Salutation</i> was appointed to station there. When within four leagues of Black Point, Pelham and seven of her crew (William Fakeley, John Wise, Robert Goodfellow, Thomas Ayers, Henry Bett, John Dawes, and Richard Kellet) were dispatched in a shallop to Green harbour to meet the second ship. Missing both points, the shallop was given up as lost, and the Muscovy fleet returned home.<br>
<br>The eight men passed the winter in dire privation at Bell Sound. Having stocked up as best they could with meat, the men retreated to a &#145;tent&#146;, in fact a tiled, timber house used in season by coopers on whaling voyages, within which they erected another &#145;tent&#146; and gathered wood for firing from the debris left by whalers. Pelham wrote:<blockquote>our greatest and chiefest feeding was the whale Frittars, and those mouldie too, the loathsomest meat in the world &hellip; 'twas a measuring cast which should be eaten first, Wee or the Beares, when we first saw one another &hellip; they had as good hopes to devoure us as wee, to kill them. (Pelham, 254&#150;5)</blockquote>Making good use of the materials left by the whalers and the knowledge of the region by at least two of the men, the party managed to stay in reasonable physical and mental health. On 25 May 1631 two ships from Hull came into the sound, followed on the 28th by the Muscovy fleet, again under the command of Captain William Goodler. The eight men were at once taken on board, and on 20 August departed for the Thames.<br>
<br>Pelham wrote an account of his privations in <span class="italic">Gods power and providence shewed in the marvellous preservation and deliverance of eight Englishmen, left by mischance in Greenland, anno 1630, nine moneths and twelve dayes, with a true relation of all their miseries, their shifts, and hardship &hellip; with a map of Green-land</span> (1631), which was later reprinted in 1855 for the Hakluyt Society by Adam White in volume 4 of the <span class="italic">Collection of Voyages and Travels</span> (1732, 1744, 1752) of A. Churchill and J. Churchill and in Edward Arber's <span class="italic">English Garner</span>, volume 8 (1896). The book is dedicated to Alderman Sir Hugh Hammersley, governor of the Muscovy Company, and to the company's assistants and adventurers. The work promises a description of the chief places and rarities of Greenland, but it is largely an account of the ingenious ways in which Pelham and the abandoned crew made shift to over-winter. This in no way detracts from their feat, but makes the book more of a curiosity than an influential geography or travel book.<br>
