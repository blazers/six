<span class="headword">Barnaby, Sir  Nathaniel</span>  (1829&#150;1915), <span class="occ">naval architect</span>, the eldest son of Nathaniel Barnaby, inspector of shipwrights at Sheerness Dockyard, and his wife, Anna (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Fowler), was born at Chatham on 25 February 1829. At the age of fourteen, Barnaby became a shipwright apprentice at Sheerness, and in 1848 he won a scholarship at the Portsmouth central school of mathematics and naval construction. On leaving there in 1852 he was appointed draughtsman in the royal dockyard at Woolwich; in 1854 he became overseer of the <i>Viper</i> and <i>Wrangler</i>, ships being built in the Thames for the Crimean War. Later in 1854 he was appointed to the naval construction department of the Admiralty, where he assisted with the designs for the last wooden sailing line-of-battle ships and for the <i>Warrior</i>, the first British armoured battleship. He married in 1855 Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1910), daughter of John Webber of Birmingham; they had one son and two daughters.<br>
<br>When <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35707/', "Sir Edward James Reed")</script>, who had married Barnaby's sister Rosetta, became chief constructor of the navy in 1863, he made Barnaby head of his staff, and as such Barnaby worked on most of Reed's designs, including that of the <i>Monarch</i>, Reed's fully rigged seagoing turret ship.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the first lord, Hugh Childers, was forcing through the rival design of the <i>Captain</i> over the objections of Reed and Sir S. Robinson, the controller of the navy. In July 1870 Reed resigned, and Childers tried unsuccessfully to persuade Laird, builder of the <i>Captain</i>, to replace him. After the <i>Captain</i> sank on 7 September, Childers, whose son drowned aboard her, blamed Robinson, Reed, and their staff. Although he could not avoid appointing Barnaby, the obvious internal candidate to replace Reed, as a public mark of lack of confidence he was denied his brother-in-law's title and appointed only as &#145;president of the council of construction&#146;. He later became chief naval architect in 1872 and director of naval construction in 1875.<br>
<br>The loss of the <i>Captain</i> aroused intense distrust in new warship designs, especially of turret ships, and Barnaby at once had to cope with the first of several outside committees of inquiry to be appointed during his term of office. The immediate focus of concern was the new turret ships <i>Devastation</i> and <i>Thunderer</i>, then being built to Reed's design. As mastless ironclads mounting their main armament in two turrets fore and aft of the central superstructure, they can now be seen as the prototypes of twenty-five years of steady development, and Barnaby was able to persuade the committee of the essential soundness of the design, as well as suggesting improvements to its immediate successor, the <i>Dreadnought</i>.<br>
<br>Barnaby's first important design for a battleship was that for the <i>Inflexible</i>, laid down in 1874. She had moderate sail power, and a one-calibre armament of four 16 inch 80 ton muzzle-loading guns, two in each of two turrets placed in echelon in a central citadel 110 feet long, protected with armour 24 inches thick. The ends of the vessel were without side armour but were fitted internally with belts of cork upon strong under-water decks. By this time Reed, embittered by his ejection from the Admiralty, had adopted the truculent and unmeasured opposition to all Admiralty designs that he maintained for the next twenty years with all the weight that his professional reputation and a seat in the Commons gave him. His essential point was that all large warships should be unsinkable, and that any sacrifice of armour for some other purpose, such as carrying guns, was unacceptable. Accordingly he attacked the <i>Inflexible's</i> unarmoured ends, but another committee of inquiry rejected his strictures, and four similar but smaller vessels&#151;<i>Ajax</i>, <i>Agamemnon</i>, <i>Colossus</i>, and <i>Edinburgh</i>&#151;followed, the last in 1879.<br>
<br>Barnaby's next design was that for the <i>Collingwood</i>, laid down in 1880. She and five similar vessels&#151;the <i>Admiral</i> class&#151;varied somewhat in gun power, and were without sail. They carried breech-loading guns in barbettes, and a belt of 18 inch armour over nearly half the length of the ship.<br>
<br>Barnaby designed various other armoured vessels, including the cruisers <i>Imp&eacute;rieuse</i>, <i>Warspite</i>, <i>Shannon</i>, <i>Nelson</i>, and <i>Northampton</i>, and some notable unarmoured designs. The cruisers <i>Iris</i> and <i>Mercury</i>, laid down in 1875 and 1876, were the first vessels for the Royal Navy built entirely of steel, which Barnaby advocated and introduced. He designed the cruisers <i>Rover</i> and <i>Bacchante</i>, and the <i>Mersey</i> class and the <i>Comus</i> class, while the <i>Leander</i> class, the navy's first protected cruisers, were designed under his supervision. He also designed the <i>Vesuvius</i>, the first British vessel fitted with a tube for discharging torpedoes under water; the torpedo-ram <i>Polyphemus</i>, armed with underwater torpedo tubes; and the <i>Rattlesnake</i>, the forerunner of the destroyer.<br>
<br>As a naval architect, Barnaby was a brilliant technician, responsible for many important innovations, but he had the misfortune to work in an era of weak and confused naval thinking, under boards of Admiralty more willing to specify design details than to consider what sort of ships the navy required, and for what purposes. He was not the man to supply their deficiencies. His own ideas of naval warfare were at best unrealistic, at worst completely fanciful, and many of his designs lacked such practical qualities as seakeeping, speed, range, and the ability to steer straight. When Lord George Hamilton became first lord in 1885, and immediately discovered that the new cruisers of the <i>Orlando</i> class were completing seriously overweight because of muddle and irresponsibility in the Admiralty, in which Barnaby was greatly implicated, he resolved to seek a new director of naval construction. Barnaby himself, still close to his sister and a near neighbour of the Reeds, was so wearied by his brother-in-law's constant attacks that he was not unwilling to resign.<br>
<br>Barnaby was one of the founders of the Institution of Naval Architects; he presented many papers, and took an active part in discussing those relating to warship design. As a debater he was skilful and convincing. The foundation of the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors was largely due to him, and he became its first head.<br>
<br>Barnaby was made CB in 1876 and KCB in 1885; he also received several foreign decorations. He devoted much time to the Sunday school of the Baptist chapel at Lee, Kent, and wrote several hymns for it. He died at his home, Moray House, Belmont Hill, Lee, on 15 June 1915, and was buried in St Margaret's churchyard at Lee.<br>
