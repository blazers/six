<span class="headword">Erle <span class="st"> [Earle]</span>, Sir  Walter</span>  (1586&#150;1665), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 22 November 1586, the eldest son of Thomas Erle, esquire (<i>d</i>. 1597), of Charborough, Dorset, and his wife, Dorothy, daughter of William Pole of Shute, Devon. Walter was aged ten when his father died and his mother's second husband, Sir Walter Vaughan of Fallersden, Wiltshire, became his guardian. He was educated at Queen's College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1602, and at the Middle Temple, London, where he was admitted in 1604, but he neither graduated nor completed his studies. He was knighted on 4 May 1616, three days before his marriage to Anne (<i>d</i>. 1654), a wealthy heiress, daughter of Francis Dymoke of Erdington, Warwickshire. They had one son, Thomas, who died before them in 1650, and two daughters. Sir Walter sat as MP for Poole in 1614, 1621, 1624, and 1660; for Dorset in 1625, 1628, 1654, and 1659; for Lyme Regis in 1626 and the Short Parliament; and for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis in the Long Parliament.<br>
<br>Up to the mid-1620s Erle made his mark chiefly in local affairs. His family came originally from Devon and had settled at Charborough in 1549 when his grandfather married the heir of Richard Wikes to acquire this and the neighbouring manors of East and West Morden. Charborough became Sir Walter's principal residence, though he also owned Bindon House and extensive landholdings in the area around Axmouth, Devon. He had taken charge of his estates by 1609 when he was reprimanded by Lord Ellesmere, the lord chancellor, for his &#145;hard conscience&#146; in evicting one of his tenants at Axmouth  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He became a JP for Dorset in 1615 and remained so for most of the period up to the outbreak of civil war. He also served as sheriff for the county in 1618&#150;19 and as deputy lieutenant during the 1620s.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Sir Walter Erle was renowned for his staunchly Calvinist religious views; these were probably formed, at least in part, while he was a student at Queen's College which was notably godly. He became a close ally of John White, the puritan patriarch of Dorchester, and between 1624 and 1627 he served as the governor of the Dorchester New England Company, set up by White as a puritan colonizing venture. Erle first came to public notoriety in the 1621 parliament when, after promoting a bill for sabbath observance, he was attacked as a puritan by the MP Thomas Shepherd.<br>
<br>From 1625 onwards Erle emerged as an important spokesman in the Commons and a vociferous critic of crown policy. His principal concern was with defending the Calvinist religion against the threats from popery and Arminianism. In the 1624 parliament he had denounced the Arminian Richard Montagu as a promoter of the ancient heresy of Arianism; in 1625 he led complaints over a letter of pardon which Secretary Conway had issued to a Jesuit priest; and in 1628 he expressed alarm over the prospect of Irish Catholic troops billeted in Kent assisting an invasion from Flanders.<br>
<br>If religion was Erle's priority, however, he was even more active in defending the liberties of the subject. In the 1625 parliament he proposed that the king should be granted tonnage and poundage for one year only instead of for life, ostensibly because he was failing to guard the seas against pirates, but also in the hope of getting it established that customs duties could only be levied with the consent of parliament. In 1626 his attacks on Buckingham and Richard Montagu during the parliament resulted in his removal from the commission of the peace, and when the king levied the forced loan in late 1626 and early 1627 he was one of the ringleaders of the resistance. His refusal to pay in Dorset led to imprisonment in London, where he and other opponents agitated to have their cause heard in the courts. This resulted in their trial&#151;the five knights' case&#151;which eventually led to the safeguards against the crown's imprisoning without showing cause enshrined in the petition of right.<br>
<br>In an important speech in the 1629 parliament Erle made a characteristic connection between the defence of Calvinist doctrine and the liberties of the subject. Both were under threat from &#145;popery and Arminianism joining hand in hand &hellip; to bring in a Spanish tyranny amongst us&#146;. He warned:<blockquote>Take away my religion and you take away my life, and not only mine but the life of the whole state and kingdom. For I may boldly say never was there a more near conjunction between matter of religion and matter of state in any kingdom in the world than there is in this kingdom at this day. (Notestein and Relf, 18&#150;19)</blockquote>This summed up his political priorities.During the 1630s Erle consolidated his links with the leaders of the opposition to Charles's regime. He had been identified as a close ally of Lord Saye and Sele when he was involved with the attempted impeachment of Buckingham in 1626, and the connection was reinforced in May 1639 when his son, Thomas, contracted to marry Saye's daughter, Susanna. In the aftermath of the Short Parliament Sir Walter was threatened with arrest for colluding with the Scots, and in November 1640 he was working closely with John Pym on preparations for the Long Parliament. Erle also continued his opposition to prerogative taxation, resisting payment of the 1636 levy of ship money in Dorset. In 1630 he travelled to the Netherlands and served briefly as a volunteer, under the command of Lord Vere. Thereafter he liked to present himself as an expert in military affairs, claiming in 1641 that he was a &#145;sword man rather than a gown man&#146;  (Keeler, <span class="italic">Long Parliament</span>, 166) and building scale models in his back garden of the sieges he had witnessed.<br>
<br>During the Long Parliament Erle was regarded as something of an elder statesman among those opposed to the crown. He remained vigilant against the threat from popery and Arminianism, taking a prominent role on committees to prepare charges against the Laudian bishops and purge the royal army of Catholics. He was particularly concerned about the dangers posed by the Irish army and in the impeachment proceedings against Strafford took charge of the twenty-fourth article which accused him of intending to bring an army over from Ireland to deal with opposition in England. When the first army plot was discovered in May 1641 he took a prominent role in the investigations and was then sent down to Dorset to organize local defence. He returned to parliament in October, just as news of the Irish rising was breaking and immediately became involved in parliament's efforts to counter this. During November 1641 he helped to draft the grand remonstrance and the following January he urged his Dorset friend William Strode to go into hiding when the house learned of the king's attempt to arrest the five members.<br>
<br>During the early stages of the civil war Erle divided his energies between Dorset and Westminster. In July 1642 he was sent down to the county to execute the militia ordinance. He raised his own troop of horse and supported the earl of Bedford's siege of Sherborne Castle in August. He returned to Westminster in January 1643 and during the negotiations over the treaty of Oxford allied himself with the more hawkish elements who opposed a lenient peace with the king. Back in Dorset in April he became commander of the county's parliamentarian forces. At Corfe Castle in June he organized an elaborate siege, trying out various experimental siege engines before being reduced to making a frontal assault which failed, with heavy casualties. Royalist accounts made much of the fact that, in spite of his boasting about his military prowess, he panicked at the first exposure to gunfire. The siege was abandoned in August, as a large royalist force entered the county, and Erle faced an inquest at Westminster which resulted in his being deprived of his command.<br>
<br>Back in the Commons Erle aligned himself with Pym, St John, and what has become known as the middle group in opposition to the earl of Essex. In February 1644 he was entrusted with the office of lieutenant of the ordnance which gave him control over the provision of artillery and weapons for the parliamentarian forces. He used this, in part, to cut off supplies to Essex's army. He was also closely involved in the setting up of the New Model Army, but lost his lieutenancy in April 1645 under the terms of the self-denying ordinance.<br>
<br>During 1645, while remaining on good terms with Saye personally, Erle drifted away from the Independent leadership and generally sided with the Presbyterians. The main reason for this appears to have been his alarm over the increase in sectaries in the New Model Army. He worked closely with the Scots, took an increasing interest in Presbyterian schemes for reform of the church, and voted with Denzil Holles and his allies. He co-operated with the Scots commissioners over the peace negotiations of 1646 and 1647, supporting a Presbyterian church settlement and acting as one of the four MPs chosen to present the propositions of Newcastle to Charles. He also backed Holles's efforts to disband the New Model Army in 1647, but avoided impeachment in the summer, probably because of his links with Saye. In August 1647, as part of an effort to conciliate moderate Presbyterians, he was restored to the office of lieutenant of the ordnance, and during early 1648 he was gradually drawn back into working with the army. By the start of the second civil war, however, he was once more siding with the Presbyterians over religious matters and became a vigorous supporter of continuing negotiations with the king. At the time of Pride's Purge he was secluded from the house, briefly imprisoned, and stripped of his lieutenancy.<br>
<br>Erle was shut out from further involvement in politics until the first protectorate parliament when he served as MP for Dorset. He made little impact on proceedings, but soon after began to recover his local offices. He returned to the Dorset commission of the peace in 1657, remaining active until his death and becoming a strong opponent of the Quakers. He sat once more as knight of the shire in Richard Cromwell's parliament, but by this stage he was getting a reputation for being a parliamentary bore&#151;one observer noting that he &#145;took a liberty to stand up twenty times a day&#146;  (J. P. Ferris and P. Little, <span class="roman">HoP</span>, <span class="italic">Commons, 1604&#150;29, 1640&#150;60</span>). At the age of seventy-three he represented Poole in the Convention Parliament of 1660. As father of the house, he argued vigorously for a moderate religious settlement and warned of the dangers of the <span class="roman">Militia Bill</span>, as well as sitting on fifty-eight committees.<br>
<br>A staunch Calvinist, an unremitting opponent of popery, and a strong defender of the subject's liberties, Erle was in many respects the archetype of the &#145;patriots&#146; and &#145;public men&#146; who acted as spokesmen for &#145;the country&#146; in the years up to and during the civil war. He died in 1665 and was buried on 1 September at Charborough; his grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8837/', "Thomas Erle")</script>, succeeded to his estate.<br>
