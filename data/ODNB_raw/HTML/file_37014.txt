<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Woodward, Sir  Arthur  Smith</span>  (1864&#150;1944), <span class="occ">palaeontologist</span>, was born on 23 May 1864 at Macclesfield, Cheshire, the elder son of Edward Woodward, silk dyer, and his wife, Margaret Smith, whose maiden name he used as an additional surname. Both families had long been connected with the silk trade in Macclesfield. As a child Woodward collected wild flowers, beetles, and seaweeds; a fossil he was given while on holiday at Llandudno led to an interest in geology.<br>
<br>Woodward was educated at the King Edward VI Grammar School, Macclesfield, which awarded him a scholarship to Owens College, Manchester. There he was taught by, among others, William Boyd Dawkins, the archaeologist and geologist, who became his lifelong friend. In 1882, and before graduation, Woodward obtained a position in the geology department of the British Museum (Natural History), then newly transferred to South Kensington. He worked under the direction of William Davies, arranging the collections of fossil vertebrates for exhibition. The quality of the fishes in the collections of the earl of Enniskillen and Sir Philip Egerton, which the museum had just acquired, turned Woodward to the special study of fossil fishes. He attended the Swiney lectures given in the museum in 1883 by Ramsay Heatley Traquair, then the authority on the subject, and evening classes in comparative anatomy and general biology at King's College. At the suggestion of the keeper, the museum's trustees instructed Woodward to make a catalogue of all the fossil fishes in the department: he thus entered on his life-work, which was to make him the greatest palaeoichthyologist of his time.<br>
<br>The first of the four volumes of the <span class="italic">Catalogue of Fossil Fishes in the British Museum</span> appeared in 1889, the last in 1901. Nearly one hundred years later they were still in great demand. Although Woodward produced over six hundred publications, most of them papers in scientific journals, the catalogue was his <i>magnum opus</i>. A monument of meticulous accuracy and of intense research, it was the first application of evolutionary theory to the whole field. It became the mainspring of Woodward's multifarious activities: he acquired a speaking knowledge of several European languages; travelled widely in quest of new material, both in the field and in public and private collections; made contact with palaeontologists of many nationalities, and entertained them at home; and worked to enrich the collections further, until, by the wealth of its material, his department drew researchers from all parts of the world.<br>
<br>In 1892 Woodward became assistant keeper and in 1901 he succeeded to the keepership. By delegating the supervision of invertebrates to the assistant keeper he was able to concentrate his studies on vertebrates generally, and fossil fishes in particular. In 1894 he married Maud Leonora Ida (1874&#150;1963), daughter of the geologist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36006/', "Harry Govier Seeley")</script>; they had one son, who entered the colonial service and died in 1924, and one daughter.<br>
<br>Woodward received many honours. The Royal Society elected him a fellow in 1901 and awarded him a royal medal (1917); he served as president of a number of scientific societies and received several other medals, including the Lyell (1896) and Wollaston (1924) medals of the Geological Society, the prix Cuvier of the French Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences (1918), and the Mary Clark Thompson medal of the National Academy of Sciences, Washington (1942). He also held honorary doctorates from the universities of Glasgow, St Andrews, Tartu, and Athens. He was knighted in 1924.<br>
<br>Woodward's reputation as a distinguished and successful scientist has been marred, though his fame increased, since exposure of the Piltdown fraud in the 1950s. In 1912 Charles Dawson, a Sussex solicitor, showed Woodward fragments of a human skull said to have come from Pleistocene gravels at Piltdown, Sussex. Woodward joined Dawson in excavations at the site and together they found further hominoid fragments, worked flints, and other mammalian fossils. In 1913 Woodward described &#145;Piltdown man&#146; as <i>Eoanthropus dawsoni</i>, and with Dawson, Teilhard de Chardin, and others he continued to work the Piltdown site. Dawson died in 1916; nothing was found at Piltdown thereafter by Woodward or anyone else. The known parts of Piltdown man&#151;a braincase of human type associated with an apelike lower jaw&#151;became increasingly anomalous in comparison with human fossils found subsequently, and during the 1950s all the Piltdown fossils were shown to have been faked and/or planted at the site. Piltdown man comprises parts of an unusually thick human braincase and of an orang-utan lower jaw, stained and modified in various ways.<br>
<br>Since the Piltdown fakes were uncovered in the 1950s, there have been repeated attempts to identify the forger. Dawson must have been involved; candidates proposed as his co-conspirator include Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, W. J. Sollas, M. A. C. Hinton, Teilhard de Chardin, and Sir Arthur Keith. Whereas the true culprits and their motives may never be identified with certainty, their victim or dupe was certainly Woodward. Between 1912 and his death, he published some twenty-five papers bearing on Piltdown, and his last work, dictated to his wife during his blindness and issued posthumously in 1948, was <span class="italic">The Earliest Englishman</span>, a book on Piltdown man. Whether the forger's motives were self-advancement or spite, Woodward was completely taken in; the acuity displayed in his work on fishes and other vertebrates deserted him.<br>
<br>Woodward was a strict disciplinarian, and has been described as a humourless martinet. Although perhaps not easily approachable, he could be very kind and considerate to his junior staff. During his forty-two years at the museum he was absent through sickness for only one half-day&#151;with a broken arm. His outside interests were few and this perhaps made it difficult for him to understand the wider outlook of his colleagues, to whom his single-minded zeal and devotion to duty were nevertheless an inspiration. Yet he appreciated music, and, surprisingly, enjoyed taking his children to the pantomime.<br>
<br>Following his early retirement in 1924, Woodward never again entered the British Museum, but he continued to work and travel until blindness overtook him in his final years. Apparently he was piqued at having been passed over for the directorship in 1919. Woodward died at his home, Hill Place, Balcombe Road, Haywards Heath, Sussex, on 2 September 1944. He was cremated at Brighton crematorium on 6 September; a memorial service was held at All Saints' Church, Lindfield, Sussex, on 8 September. His library of nearly 10,000 works was purchased by University College, London.<br>
