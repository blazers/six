<span class="headword">Swinderby,  William</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1382&#150;1392), <span class="occ">heretic</span>, was a disciple of John Wyclif during the 1380s and 1390s. His origins, date of birth, and education are unknown. He is first recorded in Leicester in 1382, but was apparently not a native of the town; he was called a priest, but doubts about his ordination were later expressed. Late in his recorded career he described himself as &#145;only simply lettered&#146;  (Capes, 262), but his extensive citation of biblical, patristic, and canonistic authorities, in both Latin and English, suggests that he must have been familiar with academic sources.<br>
<br>Before his association with William Smith and other Lollards of Leicester, Swinderby had been a preacher and for a time a hermit, with varied reception, but some support, from the Augustinian canons at Leicester Abbey. He then began preaching Wycliffite views to enthusiastic congregations in and near the town. After an attempt to silence him failed, John Buckingham, bishop of Lincoln, in May 1382 ordered the investigation of sixteen articles brought by three friars; in July Swinderby abjured six heresies and five errors. Punishment was allegedly mitigated by the intercession of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and of his son. Swinderby was freed, but prohibited from further preaching without licence; he returned to Leicester briefly but soon left for Coventry. Little is known of his activities there, but he seems to have resumed the preaching of similar views, and to have been forced to leave the town.<br>
<br>Swinderby's next certain appearance was in the diocese of Hereford, where Bishop John Trefnant in 1390 obtained a transcript of the condemnation of 1382; evidently Swinderby's preaching was notorious along the Welsh border. In June 1391 Swinderby appeared before Trefnant, and produced a justification of his position on the articles in the Buckingham condemnation and other charges; because of a safe conduct he was allowed to depart unharmed. In the following months he was summoned to appear before Trefnant; this he repeatedly failed to do, although he sent a further document. In October Swinderby appeared and submitted another defence of a longer set of opinions; on these he was adjudged heretical, but he managed to escape from custody. He appealed in writing from Trefnant's condemnation to the king and parliament, but this went unheard, and by early March 1392 he was being sought in Wales. No more is known of his history.<br>
<br>The charges against Swinderby reveal him to have taught characteristic Wycliffite doctrines concerning the eucharist, absolution, tithes, preaching, and ecclesiastical temporalities; he seems to have gone further than some Wycliffites in urging the spiritual incompetence of clerics in mortal sin. It would seem that, despite the obscurity of much of his career, Swinderby was a considerable influence in the early spread of Lollardy.<br>
