<span class="headword">Roberts,  Robert Davies</span>  (1851&#150;1911), <span class="occ">adult educationist</span>, was born at Aberystwyth on 5 March 1851, the eldest child of Richard Davies Roberts, a timber merchant and shipowner, and his wife, Sara Davies. His background was strictly Calvinistic Methodist. He received his early education in Aberystwyth and then at Oswestry grammar school and the Liverpool Institute. In October 1867 he went to University College, London, taking a first class BSc in geology three years later. In 1871 he entered Clare College, Cambridge, as a scholar, and obtained first class honours in natural sciences in 1874, despite having interrupted his studies to run the family business following the death of his father. He received a London DSc in 1878 (which Cambridge University refused to recognize). He was a fellow of Clare College from 1884 to 1890.<br>
<br>At Cambridge, Roberts met James Stuart, who soon brought him into the university extension movement, which was to become the principal interest of his life. In the autumn of 1875 he opened the York extension centre with morning and evening classes on physical geography. His enthusiasm was such that he offered to give a third class for schoolchildren gratis. A temporary lectureship in chemistry at the recently founded University College in Aberystwyth during 1877 gave him the opportunity to promote university extension in mid-Wales. He returned to Cambridge in 1878 and became a lecturer in various centres throughout England for the local examinations and lectures syndicate.<br>
<br>In March 1881 the syndicate appointed Roberts assistant secretary for lectures. The movement was weak at this time: only London and Cambridge organized courses of lectures; the syndicate secretary, G. F. Browne (who had taken over from James Stuart), had little interest in the lectures; and the first assistant secretary for lectures, William Cunningham, had been hampered by ill health. Roberts immediately began to expand the number of centres and spent much time visiting them, as Stuart had done. His enthusiasm was such that after his first year the syndicate found it necessary to publish his long reports on the lectures separately from the annual report to the university. However, Roberts found it difficult to persuade Cambridge to recognize the need for training extension lecturers (who were usually recent graduates) and for giving proper recognition to the examinations that the syndicate had initiated.<br>
<br>Roberts was university lecturer in geology at Cambridge in 1883&#150;6, and subsequently published <span class="italic">Earth's History: an Introduction to Modern Geology</span> (1893). But he gave up his scientific career on his appointment in 1885 as secretary to the London Society for the Extension of University Teaching. He soon increased the number of centres in the Greater London area and introduced some of the reforms that he had failed to carry through at Cambridge. In 1889 he also became secretary of the Gilchrist Trust, which provided the funds for short courses of three lectures, and which he used to encourage the formation of new extension centres throughout the country. Roberts resigned his Cambridge appointment in 1890 and concentrated his energies on London, which he hoped to make a teaching university and so provide diplomas and degrees for extension students. He wrote and spoke extensively on the subject, and brought together a large quantity of information about the movement in different countries (later in the Cambridge University archives). In 1888 he married Mary, eldest daughter of Philip S. King of Brighton; they had no children.<br>
<br>In 1894 Roberts returned to Cambridge as secretary to the extension syndicate, whose early work he had described in <span class="italic">Eighteen Years of University Extension</span> (1891). This was a time of considerable expansion, when county and borough councils received powers to provide adult education, and Roberts encouraged them to use the university's services. However, the reorganized University of London appointed him registrar of the university extension board in 1902 and he left Cambridge for the last time. He was by now a leading figure in the movement and advised other universities, including the University of Wales, on the subject. He was junior deputy chancellor (1903&#150;5) and chairman (1910&#150;11) of the executive committee of the court of the new federal University of Wales. The Congress of the Universities of the Empire, held in London in 1912 was planned and organized by him but he died suddenly at his home, 55 Bedford Gardens, Kensington, London, on 14 November 1911, before the congress met.<br>
<br>Roberts spent his life promoting the idea that a university education should be available to everyone. In his official positions, and as editor of the <span class="italic">University Extension Journal</span> and its successors, he took every opportunity to forward his plans and opposed attempts to water down his ideal. On these grounds he objected to Oxford University's short courses of six lectures which departed from Stuart's plan of &#145;a peripatetic university&#146;, and felt that the proposal of Albert Mansbridge to limit working men to non-graduate university courses was a retrograde step. These opinions, and his deafness, led some to object to him as an autocrat and a pedant, but his vision of an open university was achieved long after his death.<br>
