<span class="headword">Scaglia,  Alessandro Cesare</span>  (1592&#150;1641), <span class="occ">diplomat and art collector</span>, was born in Piedmont, part of the duchy of Savoy, the second son of Filiberto Gherado, count of Verrua (1561/2&#150;1619), and his wife, Bianca. He was probably raised at court in Turin through his father's position as court chamberlain, and in 1603 journeyed with his father and elder brother to the Spanish court with the Savoyard duke's sons and Giovanni Botero, the Jesuit political theorist and tutor to the princes. Through his father Scaglia obtained three commendatory abbeys, Santa Maria di Staffarda (1603), San Pietro di Muleggio (1613), and San Giusto di Susa (1616), but he was never ordained priest.<br>
<br>In 1614 Scaglia was dispatched as a diplomat to Rome, where, over a decade of service, he also acquired expertise in collecting art. The second phase of his career, from 1624 to 1632, began as he replaced his brother, Augusto Manfredo, as Savoy's ordinary ambassador in Paris. In the context of continuing close contact between the duke of Savoy and England's ambassador to Turin and Venice, Sir Isaac Wake, this initiated another significant Anglo-Savoyard relationship, especially with George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham, when he travelled to France to finalize the negotiations for Prince Charles's marriage to Louis XIII's sister Henrietta Maria. With the eye of an astute diplomat and courtier, Scaglia wooed the favourite with a gift of paintings. That Scaglia had won Buckingham's ear was demonstrated when in January 1626 he travelled to London to mediate in the dispute over English support for rebellious French Huguenots, enjoying a remarkably warm welcome from Charles I and Buckingham, as well as another court friend, James Hay, first earl of Carlisle.<br>
<br>The high point of Scaglia's career came in the years 1626&#150;32, when, against the backdrop of the wider conflict of the Thirty Years' War, England was at war with both Spain and France. Buckingham's control of foreign policy became the key to Scaglia's aim of using England as a lever to extract benefits for Savoy from the leading Catholic powers in north Italy, by playing the wars with France and Spain against each other. While Scaglia had arrived in Paris opposing Spain, French betrayal of Savoy by the treaty of Monz&oacute;n, signed by the chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, in March 1626, altered Scaglia's diplomatic strategy. He shifted from pursuing an anti-Habsburg alliance to mediating an Anglo-Spanish peace, at least initially to force Richelieu back to the alliance. Buckingham proved reluctant to support Scaglia's deliberately equivocal strategy, though by the beginning of 1627 his position also changed as his agent, Balthasar Gerbier, opened informal negotiations with the painter&#150;diplomat Peter Paul Rubens, representing the Spanish. There followed a complex three-way diplomatic process involving Scaglia that lasted through 1627 as he left Paris for Brussels, The Hague, and, by November, London.<br>
<br>By the close of 1627 Scaglia's efforts to sustain the Anglo-French war while settling the Spanish conflict became an end in itself. War broke out in north Italy over the succession to Mantua and Monferrato, where the Savoyard duke, supported by Spain, pushed for his claim to Monferrato. Scaglia reasoned that the continuation of Huguenot unrest in France would ensure that French troops would not intervene against Savoy. This strategy, however, was dramatically undone by Buckingham's murder in 1628, not least as this paved the way to an Anglo-French peace and thus France's entry into north Italy. Scaglia still persevered with a Spanish peace, and his contribution was recorded in the treaty of Madrid, signed in November 1630. A year later he returned to London, for the last time, as Savoy's extraordinary ambassador, and seemingly as an official Spanish representative, though by then his influence over English foreign policies had significantly waned.<br>
<br>The last phase of Scaglia's career began with his recall to Turin, though ill health apparently prevented him from complying. In March 1632 he left London to take the curative waters at Spa in the Spanish Netherlands and, by disobeying his sovereign, effectively entered self-imposed exile. But Scaglia's exile was as much a reaction to what he regarded as excessive Savoyard concessions to Richelieu. Such was their mutual dislike that the cardinal accused Scaglia of trying to assassinate him, while Scaglia's illness was put down to Richelieu's machinations. As an exile, Scaglia operated informally for the Spanish regimes in Brussels and Madrid, collecting intelligence through an international network of contacts in the hope of removing Richelieu. The presence in Brussels of the French queen mother, Marie de' Medici, and her younger son, Gaston d'Orl&eacute;ans, certainly bolstered this hope, and Scaglia carefully maintained a visible public presence to sustain the momentum of his political career. It was in this context that he commissioned up to ten paintings from Anthony Van Dyck, including two portraits now in the National Gallery, London, emphasizing that his political career was never separated from his artistic interests. However, nothing came of Scaglia's strategies, as the French exiles bickered and duelled among themselves.<br>
<br>During the later 1630s Scaglia gradually retired from politics. His last significant task appropriately involved both an artistic commission and the English court. Following the completion in 1635 of the queen's house at Greenwich, Balthasar Gerbier approached his old friend Scaglia to mediate the commission for the decoration of Henrietta Maria's apartments. Scaglia then contracted Jacob Jordaens for the task, though without informing him of the royal patron. Unfortunately, the twenty-two projected canvases were never completed, as Charles I faced civil strife, and on 21 May 1641 Scaglia died at Antwerp, where he was buried in the habit of a Franciscan friar in the convent of the Recollects. To the end Jordaens believed that Scaglia was the patron, and even took legal action against the executors of his will for unpaid money.<br>
