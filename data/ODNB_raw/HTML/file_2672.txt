<span class="headword">Blood,  Holcroft</span>  (<em>c.</em>1657&#150;1707), <span class="occ">army officer and military engineer</span>, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2673/', "Colonel Thomas Blood (1617/18&#150;1680)")</script> and his wife, Mary (<i>fl</i>. 1650&#150;1670), the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel John Holcroft of Holcroft, Lancashire, was born in Sarney, co. Meath, Ireland. In 1672, unknown to his father, he enlisted in the navy and served during the Third Dutch War. Later, under the false name Leture, he joined the French guards as a cadet and studied engineering.<br>
<br>In April 1676, at the request of his father, who was employed at court in spying on the king's enemies, Charles II granted Blood the offices of clerk of the crown and peace in co. Clare. The Blood family had originally settled in co. Clare in the 1590s, where they were now well established. Blood did not in fact take up this office, which was assigned to a deputy. In 1678 Charles II granted him a licence of absence on the grounds that &#145;he has been so absent by the King's command and has remained in England on the King's service&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1678</i>, 241).<br>
<br>Holcroft was now living in London and, it would appear, was closely connected with his father's intrigues. In 1686 he married Elizabeth Fowler, the daughter of Richard King, a barrister, at St Pancras Church. In 1688, as a result of the imminent threat of invasion, he was employed, together with Jacob Richards, in strengthening the fortifications at Sheerness. In early October, under orders from Lord Dartmouth, he was busy pressing a number of men employed on the works to serve in James II's hastily gathered fleet. Later that month, through family influence, he achieved his first important step, being appointed captain of the pioneers in James II's train of artillery; Elizabeth Blood's cousin Richard Biddulph secured Blood's appointment with Lord Dartmouth, master of the ordnance. Following the successful landing of William of Orange at Torbay, the train accompanied James's infantry under the command of Faversham down to Salisbury. In contrast to the widespread defections and disarray which affected other regiments, the train returned in good order to the Tower&#151;much to the satisfaction of the newly convened council of peers.<br>
<br>Notwithstanding his service under the old regime, Blood remained on the establishment after William's accession. In May 1689 he was promoted second engineer on the train of artillery bound for Ireland, his salary raised from 5<i>s</i>. to 10<i>s</i>. per day. He served in all the major sieges and battles of the campaign in Ireland and was wounded at Cavan in February 1690. In 1693 he was in receipt of a Treasury payment for demolishing the fortifications at Cashel by the king's direct order.<br>
<br>During the mid-1690s Blood's relations with the Board of Ordnance deteriorated; he was not appointed to either of the two artillery trains sent to Flanders in 1692. However, it was still a widespread practice for regiments to appoint their own engineer officers, and Blood was promoted captain in Colonel John Foulkes's regiment, then serving in Flanders with King William. In 1693 he was accused of robbing the post boy of mails from Spain, but after a trial at the Old Bailey was acquitted. The incident worked out rather to his advantage, for the king, convinced of his innocence and having first-hand experience of his abilities as a siege engineer in Ireland, secured his rapid advancement. In October 1693 he was promoted major and in 1694 received a commission in Lord Cutts's regiment. After being promoted lieutenant-colonel in Sir George St George's regiment, he served as an engineer at the siege of Namur in 1695.<br>
<br>Blood continued to enjoy royal patronage. By warrant of January 1696 he was raised to the position of second engineer of England, passing over Jacob Richards, his senior, under whom he had served in Ireland. According to Porter the Board of Ordnance, much displeased with this royal interference with precedent, put off the appointment for as long as possible but was eventually forced to comply. In May of the same year Blood was paid &pound;180 as reward for his part in apprehending the leaders of a conspiracy to assassinate the king. Later, in October, William moved to circumvent the functions of the board further by appointing Blood commander of the King's company of engineers, a little-known body under the monarch's direct control, paid by special warrant from the Treasury. Blood had twenty-eight engineers under his command, paid between 5<i>s</i>. and 10<i>s</i>. a day, although several were also on the establishment of the board at the same time. The company was active in the autumn of 1696, preparing fixed defensive lines in front of the British army's winter quarters near Bruges. On 18 October Blood wrote to the king with plans of his retrenchments, together with troop dispositions &#145;to cover Bruges from the insults of the French&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1696</i>, 418&#150;19).<br>
<br>However, the war in Flanders was drawing to a close, and the evolution of an independent company of engineers was ended with the treaty of Ryswick (1697). While the army was rapidly disbanded, the Board of Ordnance moved to increase its establishment, and the first artillery train in peacetime was formed under Jacob Richards, although it soon fell foul of cries for economy. Similarly, in March 1700 the King's company of engineers was finally broken. Blood, however, remained on the establishment as second engineer of England with a salary of &pound;250; he also retained his commission as a lieutenant-colonel, with a salary of &pound;365.<br>
<br>The dispute between the board and Blood continued with the resumption of hostilities against France in 1702. When offered command of the train for Flanders he at first declined, on the grounds that the board's practice of granting short temporary commissions undermined the commander's authority when &#145;the confusion and disorder which always happens in new corps, seems in my humble opinion to require a greater power and authority to bring them into good order&#146;. Blood's anticipation of the arguments for a permanent corps was not well received by the board, who wrote to the earl of Romney calling for his immediate discharge from &#145;the employment of the office&#146;  (correspondence, 16 April 1702, BL, Add. MS 61298, fols. 1&#150;3). With the appointment of the duke of Marlborough as master of the ordnance in late June 1702 matters appear to have been resolved, for Blood did in fact take up the post of colonel of the train. He saw distinguished service in that capacity under the duke in the following years. At the siege of Venloo in September 1702 Lord Cutts led a foolhardy but successful assault on the fortifications, commending Blood in his dispatch; a party of 300 workmen and a number of engineers:<blockquote>under Colonel Blood who acted as First Engineer under Mr Coehorne and was to have made the lodgement continuous. When he saw that I had quitted that design he shew'd the part of a brave officer, charging with the men sword in hand and killing an officer of grenadiers who made a vigorous opposition with his party. (Porter, 1.111)</blockquote>In July 1702 Blood was appointed lieutenant-colonel of Sir Matthew Bridge's regiment, and took over the regiment on Bridge's death the following year. The regiment saw service in Spain and Portugal, being present at Almanza in 1707 and at Saragossa and Brihuega in 1710. Blood remained in Flanders, and it was as colonel of the train during Marlborough's campaign of 1704 that he achieved his greatest feats of gunnery, engineering, and logistics. Transporting a train of thirty-eight field pieces and four howitzers a distance of 250 miles from the Meuse to the Danube in six weeks, partly by boat up the Rhine, then on foot through rolling country from Mainz to Heidelberg, and finally over the passes of the Jura mountains in continuous rain and deteriorating tracks, Blood arrived at the town of Donauw&ouml;rth on 2 July. Here he was able to bring several batteries of guns immediately to bear on the slopes between the town and the fortified heights of the Schellenberg in support of a sudden and successful assault by Marlborough's infantry.<br>
<br>At Blenheim, Blood's artillery played an important role throughout the course of the battle. Arriving at dawn on the day of the battle, the combined allied artillery was positioned by Marlborough on the heights covering the Nebel Stream and surrounding marshes. In the morning the battle commenced as Blood's artillery directed its barrage on the opposing French cannon, in support of the advancing allied forces. Later Marlborough sent Blood forward with several batteries to stiffen the wavering assault by Holstein Beck's forces in the vicinity of Oberglau. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon Blood was ordered to bring a battery of nine field pieces across the marshes by pontoon bridge to support the allied advance in the centre. Under heavy fire he brought up the guns and proceeded to decimate the nine brigades of the French centre at close range with partridge shot before the main body of allied cavalry succeeded in cutting the French army in two. For his distinguished action during the battle Blood was promoted to brigadier-general.<br>
<br>The campaign of 1704 continued long into December in an attempt to maximize allied gains. Desiring to secure the lower Moselle before moving into winter quarters, and being delayed by sturdy resistance at Landau, on 22 October Marlborough sent Colonel Blood, with three regiments of foot, fourteen cannon, and four howitzers, ahead of the main column towards Homburg in preparation for an attack upon the fortress at Treves (Trier). After a rapid march through densely wooded hills, made possible by unseasonably good weather, Marlborough arrived with all his forces at Treves on 29 October. The advance enjoyed complete surprise, and the French garrison withdrew, offering no resistance. The subsequent siege of Trabach, which was opened on 4 November, was not so easy, however; Blood was kept busy with siege work until 20 December, when the garrison pleaded for terms.<br>
<br>Blood's military career had reached its zenith, yet professional success and public acclaim were accompanied by increasing turbulence in his private life. His relationship with his wife, Elizabeth, had deteriorated, largely as a consequence of sexual infidelity on his part&#151;principally, but not solely, his long-standing affair with Mrs Mary Andrews, a chief witness for the defence at his trial for robbing the mails. Elizabeth left the marital home in 1700, together with a large quantity of household goods, having run up significant debts. In October Blood attempted a reconciliation which ended in a public brawl. Elizabeth's attempts to have warrants issued against him for assault were deflected by a combination of social influence and legal trickery&#151;his brother Charles was a barrister. In 1702 Elizabeth turned to the consistory court of London with a suit for separation with alimony on grounds of cruelty and adultery. Her accusations appeared wild and uncorroborated, and Blood was able to call on friends of social standing for character witness. On account of his absences in the field the case dragged on until 1704. However, before judgment could be given Blood produced evidence of adultery on his wife's part and her suit was thrown out. Despite her refutation of this charge on appeal to the court of arches, Blood's public position and military career proved decisive. Separated from his independent and resourceful wife, he returned to Flanders in 1705.<br>
<br>Under Marlborough's command, artillery was playing an increasingly important role, and consequently trains of artillery were becoming bigger; in 1705 Blood commanded a train of forty-six guns, including twenty 24-pounders, in addition to sixty mortars. In 1706 he commanded a similar sized train at Ramillies, perhaps Marlborough's most decisive victory. Moreover, Blood's relations with the board appear to have improved. In early June the board thanked him for his report on the victory at Ramillies and later advances and again in September for his account of the siege of Menin, where Blood was in charge of the engineering works.<br>
<br>This was to prove the last action in which Blood served. The army shortly went into winter quarters. At the start of the campaign of 1707 he was lying ill in Brussels, where he died on 19 August 1707, aged fifty. He left an illegitimate son, Holcroft, of St Anne's, Soho, whose mother was Dorothy Cooke of Dort, Holland. The son died unmarried about 1724. Both were main beneficiaries of his will, which he made shortly before his death. His wife, Elizabeth, received a small payment.<br>
<br>In an age when artillery was heavy, cumbersome, slow, usually late to the battle and rather inaccurate, Blood's endeavours as commander of the train in Marlborough's campaigns appear herculean. It was an age when the commander of the train combined the demanding roles of gunnery officer, siege engineer, and logistical support. More particularly Blood's career reflects the transition in the use of artillery in warfare during the early eighteenth century: a movement away from the static, defensive encounters of the seventeenth century, with an emphasis on siege warfare and territorial occupation, towards the strategy of decisive offensive action through the destruction of the enemy's army on the battlefield. This required not only greater mobility in the movement of armies and supporting artillery but also mobility in terms of the tactical requirements of the battlefield. This was exemplified by Marlborough's campaign of 1704, in which Blood's artillery played such an important part.<br>
