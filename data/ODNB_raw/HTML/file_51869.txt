<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Emel&eacute;us,  Harry Julius</span>  (1903&#150;1993), <span class="occ">inorganic chemist</span>, was born on 22 June 1903 in Poplar, London, the second of three sons and the second of the five children of Karl Henry Emel&eacute;us (1869&#150;1948), pharmacist, and his wife, Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Biggs (1873&#150;1965), a secretary at the Scandinavian Sailors' Home near the West India docks in London. His father, a Swedish speaking Finn, was born in Vaas&auml;, Finland, but eventually settled in England at the turn of the century. His mother was the daughter of George Biggs, an engineer in charge of the dock gates. Three months after Emel&eacute;us was born the family moved to the Old Pharmacy in Battle, Sussex, and this was to remain the family home. Emel&eacute;us's older brother, Karl George (1901&#150;1989), later became professor of physics at the Queen's University of Belfast.<br>
<br>Emel&eacute;us attended St Leonards Collegiate School, Hastings, and Hastings grammar school (1914&#150;21) before going up to the Royal College of Science, Imperial College, London, graduating ARCS with first-class honours in chemistry in 1923. At that time this did not automatically qualify for the University of London BSc, so he took the London External BSc with a different syllabus later in the same year, again obtaining first-class honours. He was awarded his PhD (London) for work on the luminescent oxidation of phosphorus in 1926 and DSc three years later. An Exhibition of 1851 senior studentship in 1927 enabled him to spend some time in Karlsruhe with Alfred Stock, one of the world's greatest exponents of preparative inorganic chemistry, and this had a profound influence on his subsequent research. He also became fluent in German and an expert glassblower. Then as a Commonwealth Fund fellow (1929&#150;31) he spent two highly productive years at Princeton University working on various aspects of photochemistry with Professor Hugh Stott Taylor. It was also at Princeton that he met his future wife, (Mary) Catherine Horton (1906&#150;1991) of Richmond, Virginia, who was working in the university library, and who shared Emel&eacute;us's interest in folk dancing. They married in New York on 26 May 1931. The marriage was a long and happy one and they had four children: George Cowling (1934), Sidney Carlstrum (1938), Frances Virginia (1943) and Martha Ann (1950).<br>
<br>Returning to England, Emel&eacute;us was appointed as a junior demonstrator / assistant lecturer in the chemistry department at Imperial College, where he set up an active research group studying the chemistry of several main group elements. He also collaborated with his colleague J. S. Anderson in writing a renowned textbook, <span class="italic">Modern Aspects of Inorganic Chemistry</span> (1938), which ran through several editions and was to change the perception of the subject throughout the world. Defence related studies at Imperial College occupied most of 1939&#150;45, except for a short period at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as part of the British contingent working on the atomic bomb project. Emel&eacute;us also held a commission in the Home Guard, as battalion gas officer, and, with Ewart Jones, was senior gas adviser for London. Fortunately gas was never used, and his responsibilities were limited to lecturing to gas officers.<br>
<br>In October 1945 Emel&eacute;us took up a permanent appointment at Cambridge, first as reader and then, after a few months, as a personal professor in inorganic chemistry and fellow of Sidney Sussex College. He remained in Cambridge for the rest of his life. At the old university chemical laboratory in Pembroke Street there was virtually no research in inorganic chemistry. Alexander Todd had recently been appointed as head of the department and had already begun a drastic reorganization of the labs, which were still lit by gas and were very poorly serviced. By mutual agreement Emel&eacute;us was able to concentrate on teaching and research without being greatly burdened by matters of finance and administration. He always acknowledged his good fortune in this respect and it undoubtedly contributed to his happiness and productivity in Cambridge.<br>
<br>Several research groups on preparative inorganic chemistry were set up under Emel&eacute;us's general leadership to study new volatile compounds of silicon and the preparation of novel metal fluorides. He also opened up a fertile new field which exploited the use of highly reactive halogen fluorides as non-aqueous solvents. His most extensive series of investigations was the development over some twenty-five years of the chemistry of the extraordinarily versatile trifluoromethyl group. This resulted in more than sixty papers (one third of his total output) and involved some thirty-seven co-workers, more than half of them from a dozen different countries overseas. With these and other similar studies he succeeded in building up an internationally acclaimed school of inorganic chemistry at Cambridge, which dominated the subject for several decades. Indeed, an astonishing number of his research students and collaborators went on to distinguished careers and to senior academic positions both in Britain and abroad.<br>
<br>Emel&eacute;us was closely involved with the Ministry of Defence's Chemical Defence Advisory Board during the Second World War, and for several years after served as its chairman. He was a member of the technical committee concerned with the development of the first British nuclear power plant at Windscale, and was a consultant for many years to several major chemical firms. He was particularly active in the learned societies and served as president both of the Chemical Society (1958&#150;60) and of the Royal Institute of Chemistry (1963&#150;5); he was also president of the inorganic chemistry division of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (1955&#150;60). He served as a trustee of the British Museum (1963&#150;72) and was chairman of its committee for the research laboratory, whose work included the development of conservation treatments and techniques.<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1970 Emel&eacute;us continued to do experimental work until he was over eighty. Throughout his long career he was awarded many scholarships and prizes and received a remarkable number of international honours and awards. These included the Harrison memorial prize (1932), Tilden lectureship (1942) and Liversidge lectureship (1954) of the Chemical Society; fellowship of the Royal Society (1946); CBE (1958); the Davy medal of the Royal Society (1962); the Henri Moissan prize for fluorine chemistry, Germany (1991); the Lavoisier medal of the French Chemical Society; Alfred Stock memorial prize and medal of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker; honorary doctorates from seven universities; honorary membership of six chemical societies worldwide; and honorary membership of eight overseas academies of science. Despite this panoply of honours Emel&eacute;us remained a quiet, modest man, always appearing at ease with himself. His kindly manner, abiding courtesy and gentle sense of humour endeared him to colleagues and students alike. He had a passion for fly-fishing and it was said that he did much of his chemical thinking with a rod in his hand. His legacy was a rejuvenated academic discipline in the UK and a worldwide network of disciples who were enriched both by him and by the southern charm and generous hospitality of his wife who kept open house for them in Cambridge. He died peacefully of heart failure at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, on 2 December 1993. The funeral was held in Trumpington church, Cambridge, a week later, followed by cremation. His ashes were interred in Battle churchyard. A memorial service was held in Sidney Sussex chapel on 30 April 1994. He was survived by his four children, his wife having died in January 1991.<br>
