<span class="headword">Bevan,  Silvanus</span>  (1691&#150;1765), <span class="occ">apothecary</span>, was born in Swansea on 28 October 1691, the second son of Silvanus Bevan (1661&#150;1727) and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Phillips. The descendant of influential and prosperous Welsh Quakers (his grandfather had been a Swansea alderman and a merchant), Silvanus moved to London as a young man and was apprenticed as an apothecary to a Mr Mayleigh. In July 1715, after serving his seven years' apprenticeship, Bevan gained his freedom of the Society of Apothecaries, and in December of the same year set up his own apothecary's shop at Plough Court, a cul-de-sac off Lombard Street. Bevan made the most of the Quaker reputation for honest dealing, which was an important consideration for purchasers of medicines at that time. His Quaker linkages were strengthened when he married Elizabeth Quare, daughter of the royal clockmaker Daniel Quare, at a Friends' meeting-house in the City on 9 November 1715.<br>
<br>Bevan had a laboratory, with a still for preparing his medicines, which were usually compounded according to recipes in the various published pharmacopoeias. Bevan's catalogues listed such exotic remedies as <i>mumia</i> (or Egyptian mummy), human skull, and a Venice treacle, which contained vipers. The business was well situated and Bevan&#151;joined in partnership by his younger brother, Timothy Bevan (1704&#150;1786)&#151;prospered. Bevan increasingly practised medicine as well as pharmacy and became known as Dr Bevan. His interest in medicine is shown by a letter he sent in 1743 to the Royal Society (of which he had been elected a fellow in 1725), entitled &#145;An account of the extraordinary case of the bones of a woman growing soft and flexible&#146;. He also took a keen interest in smallpox inoculation, corresponding on the subject with James Jurin, a well-known physician, who supported the practice of inoculation.<br>
<br>Silvanus Bevan became a rich man and later lived in some style in Hackney. When he was seventy in 1761, a visitor described him in his retirement as &#145;living well on good food and drinks &hellip; [surrounded by a ] &hellip; variety of curious paintings and rich old china, and a large library containing books on most subjects&#146;. He was described as &#145;one of the principal leading men among the Quakers&#146;  (Davies, 2.336&#150;7). By then Bevan had relinquished his Plough Court partnership to his brother, Timothy, who continued the business (which in the nineteenth century, under William Allen and the Hanburys, became one of the leading chemists and druggists in London).<br>
<br>Bevan's first marriage produced a son, but both mother and infant did not long survive. He later married Martha, daughter of Gilbert Heathcote of Derbyshire, but they had no children. Bevan died at Hackney on 8 June 1765 and was buried at the Bunhill Fields burial-ground.<br>
