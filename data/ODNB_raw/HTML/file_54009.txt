<span class="headword">Rutter,  Francis Vane Phipson <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1876&#150;1937), <span class="occ">art critic and museum curator</span>, was born on 17 February 1876 at 4 The Cedars, Putney, the youngest son of Henry Rutter (<i>d</i>. 1896), a solicitor, and his wife, Emmeline Claridge Phipson. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and at Queens' College, Cambridge, graduating in 1899 with a BA degree in Semitic languages. After minor successes as a journalist, in 1901 Rutter became sub-editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> and then editor of <span class="italic">To-Day</span> (1902&#150;4). Leonard Rees, recognizing his versatility, had appointed him art critic of the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> in 1903, and he learnt his trade on the job and in Paris, where caf&eacute; life in the Latin quarter facilitated discussions with the leaders of the fast changing new art movements. When the French art dealers Durand-Ruel staged a superb impressionist exhibition in London in 1905, Rutter initiated a <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> fund to buy for the National Gallery. The gallery rejected a Monet; however, a Boudin, <span class="italic">The Entrance to Trouville Harbour</span> (National Gallery), was later accepted, following the intervention of Sir Claude Philips and D. S. McColl.<br>
<br>In Paris in 1907 Rutter was persuaded that French-based artists would exhibit in London under a non-juried society similar to the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Artistes Ind&eacute;pendents and persuaded his progressively minded friends from the Fitzroy Street Group (founded in the same year), Walter Sickert, Harold Gilman, and Spencer Gore, to back the formation of the Allied Artists' Association. With Lucien Pissarro advising, Rutter, a born organizer, collected some eighty members, and in July 1908 exhibited over 3000 works in the Albert Hall. For four years he ran this successful but unprofitable international London salon which &#145;discovered&#146; Walter Bayes, Robert Bevan, and Charles Ginner, and gave Brancusi, Epstein, and Kandinsky their first London showings. He also edited its mouthpiece, the <span class="italic">Art News</span>, until financial pressures caused his resignation. On 30 August 1909 he had married Thirza Sarah 
    (Trixie; <i>b</i>. 1887/8)
  ; she was the daughter of James Henry Tiernan of the New Zealand constabulary. In 1912 he accepted the &pound;300 a year curatorship of Leeds City Art Gallery.<br>
<br>Encouraged by G. B. Shaw, Rutter became a Fabian Society member; he was also a supporter of the suffragettes. In 1910 his efforts to end the isolation of British art were eclipsed by an establishment figure, Roger Fry, who had &#145;an immense <i>succ&egrave;s d'ex&eacute;cration</i>&#146; with his &#145;Manet and the post-impressionists&#146; exhibition, which introduced C&eacute;zanne, Gauguin, and Van Gogh to an outraged public  (Rutter, <span class="italic">Art in my Time</span>, 145). In support, Rutter rushed out a small book, <span class="italic">Revolution in Art</span> (expanded in 1926 into <span class="italic">Evolution in Modern Art</span>); the title was inspired by Gauguin's declaration that &#145;in art there are only revolutionists or plagiarists&#146;  (F. Rutter, <span class="italic">Revolution in Art</span>, 1910, 30). From Leeds, Rutter continued to champion innovation in his <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> &#145;Round the galleries&#146; column, and in October 1913 the Dor&eacute; Gallery in Bond Street commissioned him to organize the Post-Impressionist and Futurist Exhibition. Arranged chronologically from Camille Pissarro to the vorticists, led by Wyndham Lewis (who had quarrelled with Fry), Rutter's selection showed his unrivalled knowledge of European developments in modern art; his foreword to the exhibition catalogue explained the variety of work that had been loosely labelled &#145;post-impressionist&#146;.<br>
<br>In Leeds, Rutter's intention to build a modern art collection had already been dashed by the attitude of &#145;boorish&#146; ruling councillors, and his standing slumped in June 1913 after his wife (whom he was to divorce about 1920) connived in the escape of a suffragette arsonist, Lilian Lenton. Before he resigned in 1917 to work at the Admiralty in London, he combined with Michael Sadler&#151;a collector of Gauguins and Kandinskys and vice-chancellor of Leeds University&#151;to found a Leeds Art Collections Fund. This assisted with purchases and exhibitions, including the first major Constable exhibition and a post-impressionist exhibition in June 1913 which was held at the Leeds Art Club. The two outsiders had reinvigorated the club, originated by Holbrook Jackson and A. R. Orage, who now edited the <span class="italic">New Age</span>. Young Herbert Read, critic and theorist of modern art, was greatly influenced by Rutter and by club discussion of new art movements; in 1917 he joined Rutter as co-editor of <span class="italic">Art and Letters</span>. This quarterly failed in 1920, despite support from Osbert Sitwell. Read was also attracted by Rutter's plan for an authors' co-operative on the lines of the Allied Artists' Association, where Rutter resumed the reins from 1915 to 1919. Rutter opened his Adelphi Gallery in London in 1919, showing small works by David Bomberg, Edward Wadsworth, and Ginner, but, valuing above all his &#145;liberty and leisure&#146;, he soon turned to concentrate on writing, publishing some twenty books and numerous additional articles in <span class="italic">Apollo</span>, the <span class="italic">Burlington Magazine</span>, <span class="italic">The Studio</span>, <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span>.<br>
<br>Tall, with an emphatic manner, Rutter cared passionately about art and artists. Before his death from bronchitis at his home, 5 Litchfield Way, London, on 18 April 1937, he owned some eighty paintings, the finest by his friends, the &#145;lovable&#146; Gore, Gilman, Ginner, and Lucien Pissarro, who all supported his Leeds activities. He left his estate to his second wife, Ethel Dorothy (<i>b</i>. 1894/5), daughter of William Robert Bunce, a coal merchant, whom he had married on 29 March 1920. Rutter was buried on 21 April 1937 at Hampstead.<br>
