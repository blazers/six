<span class="headword">Hope,  John</span>  (1739&#150;1785), <span class="occ">writer and politician</span>, was born on 7 April 1739, the second son of Charles Hope (afterwards Hope-Vere) and Catherine Weir, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13716/', "Charles Hope, first earl of Hopetoun")</script>. He was educated at the Revd Andrew Kinross's academy at Enfield, Middlesex, and was sent to Holland in 1752 to learn business with distant kinsmen, the Hopes of Amsterdam. He returned in 1759 and engaged in mercantile pursuits in London, apparently with no great success. On 2 June 1762 Hope married Mary (1741/2&#150;1767), only daughter of Eliab Breton of Forty Hill, Middlesex. Mary committed suicide at Brockhall, Northamptonshire, on 25 June 1767, at the age of twenty-five, and was buried nearby at Norton. Her husband erected a monument with a rhyming epitaph to her memory in the south transept of Westminster Abbey  (Neale, 2.257). Their three sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13717/', "Charles Hope (1763&#150;1851)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13732/', "John Hope (1765&#150;1836)")</script>, afterwards knighted; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13739/', "William Johnstone Hope (1766&#150;1831)")</script>, also afterwards knighted, are separately noticed.<br>
<br>In 1768 Hope was chosen by the influence of his uncle, John Hope, second earl of Hopetoun, to succeed his father as MP for Linlithgowshire. The earl allowed him an annuity of &pound;400 to defray his expenses. In 1770 he was unseated on the petition of his opponent, James Dundas. He had lost favour, both with his patron and with the majority of the House of Commons, for his equivocal support for the government in the Wilkes affair. This was demonstrated by his voting for Wilkes on the question of the Middlesex election on 8 May 1769, and to this he attributed the loss of his seat. &#145;It was chiefly in your cause I suffered&#146;, he wrote to Wilkes  (letter to John Wilkes, BL, Add. MS 30871, fol. 132).<br>
<br>The majority of Hope's writing appeared in print after the end of his political career&#151;although his first book of poetry and his first contributions to periodicals are dated as early as 1769. He wrote on a variety of contemporary issues in a wide range of genres, but was primarily an essayist and a poet. Almost all of Hope's work originally appeared unsigned, under his initials, or pseudonymously, in popular periodicals of the day&#151;in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> (1769&#150;72), <span class="italic">Town and Country Magazine</span> (1769&#150;84), <span class="italic">Westminster Magazine</span> (1773&#150;81, under the name The Leveller), and the <span class="italic">Lady's Magazine</span> (1776&#150;8). Some of these contributions he later reprinted under his own name in his <span class="italic">Thoughts in Prose and Verse Started in his Walks</span> (1780). Pitcher notes, however, that Hope &#145;contributed more to the magazines than he cared to preserve&#146; and attributes to him the anonymously published satire <span class="italic">Sketches from Nature in High Preservation</span> (1779)  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, new ser., 45/1, 1998, 77&#150;81). In this work, which went through fourteen editions in its first year in print, a sketch of &#145;John H&#151;e, esq.&#146; appears in two scenes, representing &#145;Patience&#146; and &#145;Paul Writing to the Ephesians and Philippians, while Prisoner at Rome&#146;. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> also credits Hope with the authorship of the <span class="italic">New Margate Guide</span> (1780). Hope died on 21 May 1785 at Newcastle upon Tyne of a &#145;mortification in his bowels&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 55/2, 1785, 665).<br>
