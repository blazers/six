<span class="headword">Owen,  Goronwy</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Gronwy Ddu]</span>  (1723&#150;1769), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 1 January 1723 in the parish of Llanfair Mathafarn Eithaf, Anglesey, the fifth son of Owen or Owain Gronw (<i>b</i>. 1690), a labourer, and Jane Parry (<i>d</i>. 1741). He received very little primary education but is known to have attended a school at Llanallgo, near his home, <i>c</i>.1733&#150;1734, probably run by an itinerant or local schoolmaster. A strong tradition exists that Owen was educated between 1734 and 1737 at Pwllheli, in the Ll&#375;n peninsula, but conclusive proof is lacking. Between 1737 and 1741, however, he was a pupil at Friars School, Bangor, where he received a rigorous education in Greek and Latin. Born into a poor family, he was probably aided in his education by an unknown benefactor, possibly Edward Wynne of Bodewryd, possibly the influential Morris family of Pentre-eiriannell in the neighbouring parish of Llanfihangel Tre'r-beirdd. He entered Jesus College, Oxford, on 3 June 1742 but left after a week, probably because he was unable to support himself financially.<br>
<br>Owen had expressed his ambition to pursue an ecclesiastical career in a series of <i>englynion</i> written before entering Oxford, and he was admitted to priest's orders in 1747, after working as an usher at the Pwllheli school (1742&#150;4) which he was supposed to have attended as a pupil, and Denbigh grammar school (1745). After a brief provisional curacy at the parish church of Llanfair Mathafarn Eithaf he obtained a curacy near Oswestry, and then at Oswestry itself in 1746. Owen married Elinor or Elin Hughes (1717&#150;1757/8), seventh child of Owen Hughes, a merchant and an alderman of Oswestry, and his wife, Margaret, on 21 August 1747. They had four children: Robert (<i>b</i>. 1749), Gronwy or Gronw (<i>b</i>. 1751), Elin (<i>b</i>. 1753), and Owen (<i>b</i>. 1757). In 1748 Owen was arrested for debt and trespass, and was taken to Shrewsbury gaol. Debts and financial difficulties were to plague him for years to come.<br>
<br>Released from gaol through the benevolence of a local draper, Owen left Oswestry in September 1748 and moved to Donnington, near Shrewsbury, after procuring the curacy at Uppington which also involved running the school at Donnington. It was at Donnington that his interest in poetry was revived. He began to write once more, after neglecting his craft since he was usher at Pwllheli. Two factors were responsible for this renewed interest. John Douglas, his vicar at Uppington, who had written a pamphlet in 1751 to vindicate John Milton of the charge of plagiarism brought against him by William Lauder, introduced Owen to Milton's poetry. At Donnington, Owen also re-established contact and began correspondence with the three Morris brothers of Pentre-eiriannell, Richard, Lewis, and William, antiquaries, scholars, and men of letters, who encouraged him to write. It was Douglas, however, who was responsible for stimulating Owen's ambition to write an epic in Welsh, thus emulating Milton's great contribution to English literature with his epic masterpieces, <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> and <span class="italic">Paradise Regained</span>.<br>
<br>Unhappy with his lot at Donnington, and after a dispute with one of his parishioners, Owen accepted a curacy at Walton, near Liverpool, in 1753. Ill health, overwork, and the death of his daughter Elin in April 1755 prompted him to leave Walton unexpectedly and with no future prospects. Owen's gradual decline towards alcoholism probably began at Walton.<br>
<br>Owen removed himself and his family to London hoping that Richard Morris would employ him as secretary and translator of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, a cultural society for the protection and enhancement of the Welsh language founded by Richard Morris himself, and also secure an ecclesiastical position for him. Richard Morris, however, was unable to employ Goronwy. A curacy at Northolt, Middlesex, in 1755 rescued Owen and his family from starvation and deprivation. He eventually became an active member of the Society of Cymmrodorion, but he quarrelled with some of the society's most prominent members, and with Lewis Morris himself. He was also often in debt during his Northolt period.<br>
<br>Goronwy was offered a teaching post at the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1757. He set sail for America in December 1757 on a convict ship. Both his wife and his youngest child, Owen, died during the passage, probably of gaol fever. He married Anne Clayton, housekeeper of the college, widow of James Clayton and sister of Thomas Dawson, president of the college, in 1758, a few months after arriving at the college, but she died within a year of the marriage. Her death disrupted his newly found security, and he soon reverted to his old ways. He was involved in an affray in 1760, when he and another professor of the college, Jacob Rowe, led their students in a drunken revolt against the youths of Williamsburg. Both Owen and Rowe were summoned to appear before the board of the college for causing public disruption, and were also charged with drunkenness and swearing within college bounds. Rowe was dismissed; Owen was forced to resign. Thomas Jefferson had enrolled at the college when Owen was one of the masters there, and was probably one of his students.<br>
<br>Owen left Williamsburg and took up the living of St Andrews, Brunswick county. In 1763 he married Jean or Iona or Janey Simmons, with whom he had four children: John Lloyd (<i>b</i>. 1763), Gronow (<i>b</i>. 1765), Robert Brown (<i>b</i>. 1767), and Jane (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1768). He also acquired a tobacco plantation of some 400 acres. Robert was by then the only surviving child of his first family. Owen was often in trouble with the vestrymen of his parish for debt and drunkenness. He died in 1769 at Blandford, Brunswick county, Virginia, and was buried on his own plantation near Dolphin in Brunswick county.<br>
<br>Owen's poetry first appeared in an anthology entitled <span class="italic">Diddanwch teuluaidd</span> (1763), edited by Huw Jones, and published with the approval and the assistance of the Cymmrodorion Society. Owen, much influenced by the poetry and literary principles of the Augustan period, wrote a highly polished, sophisticated verse, classical in outlook and intellectual in tone. He did much to widen the scope of Welsh poetry thematically. Several popular editions of his work appeared in the nineteenth century and at the beginning of the twentieth century. The most complete and the most popular, in spite of numerous factual and textual errors, was <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of the Rev. Goronwy Owen with his Life and Correspondence</span>, edited by Robert Jones, published in two volumes in 1876. Owen was an enormous influence on Welsh poetry throughout the nineteenth century.<br>
