<span class="headword">Blake,  Charles</span>  (1664&#150;1730), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was born on 31 October 1664 at Reading, Berkshire, the son of John Blake, wharfinger, and his wife, Mary, who were later described as &#145;parents of the highest rank, even for such a town&#146;  (Brown and others, 15). He was baptized at St Giles's Church, Reading, on 1 November 1664 and educated at Merchant Taylors' School, London, from 1677/1678 to 1683 and then at St John's College, Oxford, where he &#145;completely surrendered himself to sound learning&#146;  (ibid.): he graduated BA in 1687, and proceeded MA in 1694, BD in 1696, and DD in 1712. He was an accomplished classical linguist and theologian, and acquired &#145;an outstanding reputation among academics&#146; for his &#145;intellect and learning&#146; and &#145;love of piety&#146;  (ibid.). He also developed a love of poetry, and composed in 1688 an elegy on the death of Frederick, the great elector, founder of Brandenburg-Prussia and champion of European protestantism, and in 1689 a poem in the style of Virgil's <span class="italic">Eclogues</span>, &#145;Hibernia plorans&#146;, which empathized with the besieged protestant stronghold of Londonderry. Both poems were published in 1693 in a sixpenny pamphlet, together with Blake's translation from Greek into Latin of the epic poem of Musaeus on Hero and Leander and an extract from Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span>.<br>
<br>Blake became domestic chaplain in 1710 to Sir William Dawes, a high-church tory who achieved episcopal preferment under Queen Anne, and served him while he was bishop of Chester and archbishop of York. Dawes, a younger contemporary of Blake at Merchant Taylors' and St John's College, shared his academic interests and love of poetry and remained a close personal friend until his death in 1724. Blake was appointed successively prebendary of Chester in 1710 and York in 1715, subdean of York in 1716, and archdeacon of York in 1720, and held the benefices of St Sepulchre, London, St Mary the Virgin, Hull, and St Helen, Wheldrake, a substantial living in the gift of the archbishop of York. Unassuming and unambitious, he declined several other preferments and voluntarily resigned others.<br>
<br>Blake appears to have been an efficient ecclesiastical administrator as archdeacon of York and with the archdeacons of the East Riding and Cleveland undertook a major survey of the fabric of the churches in the diocese in 1721&#150;2. However, the foundations, walls, and roofs of the nave and tower of the medieval church at Wheldrake, an open field village in the Vale of York, where he was rector from 1719 until 1730, remained &#145;in so ruinous a condition&#146; that the congregation later petitioned that they were unable to assemble for &#145;public worship of Almighty God without manifest danger of their lives&#146;  (Brown and others, 6) and the church had to be almost completely rebuilt in 1778. The old timber-framed rectory was also pronounced old-fashioned in 1764 and subsequently extensively altered, but Blake's legacy to the poor of the parish, in the form of bequests amounting to &pound;200, proved more enduring.<br>
<br>The diary of Henry Prescott, deputy registrar of the diocese of Chester, reveals Blake as a devoted scholar, meticulous liturgist, and a genial companion, who occasionally enjoyed a very spruce dinner and more frequently a domestic glass of wine. In the closing years of his life he became &#145;racked by the pains of gout&#146;, until, &#145;finally overcome&#146;, he died, a bachelor, on 22 November 1730 at Wheldrake. He was buried in the churchyard at Wheldrake in the same month and two large marble plaques were placed in the sanctuary of the church recording his own epitaph on his life, together with tributes from his friends, &#145;since those who were joined to him by nearness of blood had died&#146;  (Brown and others, 15).<br>
