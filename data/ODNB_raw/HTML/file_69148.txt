<span class="headword">Gosson,  Stephen</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1554, <em>d.</em> 1625), <span class="occ">anti-theatrical polemicist and Church of England clergyman</span>, was baptized as the eldest son and second child of Cornelius Gosson and Agnes Oxenbridge on 17 April 1554 in the church of St George the Martyr, Canterbury, Kent. His father was a joiner who emigrated from the Low Countries; a leading craftsman of the city, he was later asked to fashion a huge wooden cross to be placed in the town centre to honour Elizabeth I when she made her first visit as queen to Canterbury. Gosson's mother was the daughter of a grocer, Thomas Oxenbridge (or Oxynbregge), who earned his freedom in Canterbury in 1519. The family resided over Cornelius's shop in the parish of St George, a crowded part of the city that housed about eighty families along the south-east side of the cathedral close. Stephen entered the cathedral school as a scholar at the age of fourteen, where he was taught by John Gresshop, an MA from Christ Church, Oxford. Archbishop Matthew Parker, then the head of the school, provided the scholarship for Gosson to proceed to Corpus Christi College, Oxford.<br>
<br>At eighteen Gosson went up to Oxford, two years after John Lyly, another Canterbury boy, entered Magdalen College there. Gosson went as a sizar&#151;one of two financed by Parker for boys from Kent, and this probably determined his college and date of entry, though there was little competition for such positions. Corpus was known as &#145;the fountain head of pure Canterbury doctrine&#146;, and several of Gosson's schoolmates, including Richard Hooker and Henry Parry, were later important figures in the Elizabethan church. Gosson also learned the euphuistic style from lectures by John Rainoldes, just as George Pettie and Lyly did. But limited financial resources seem to have hampered him: although he requested graduation and was granted application on 31 October and 17 December 1576 and was admitted to the BA degree provided he could determine the following Lent, he never signed the matriculation book and never made his final disputation. Later in <span class="italic">Playes Confuted</span> he would complain that he was &#145;pulled from the University before I was ripe&#146;  (sig. G7<i>v</i>) and in his dedicatory letter he confesses a keen sense of inferiority to scholars from Oxford, Cambridge, and the inns of court. Gosson then apparently went to London, where he wrote four extant didactic and commissioned dedicatory poems. He also tried his hand at plays, although none is extant: in <span class="italic">The Schoole of Abuse</span> he refers to <span class="italic">Catalins Conspiracies</span>, designed to teach good government and show the evils of tyranny, and in <span class="italic">Playes Confuted</span> he talks of another moral play, <span class="italic">Praise of Parting</span>. But he also mentions there <span class="italic">The Comedy of Captain Mario</span>, &#145;a cast of Italian devices&#146;, and Thomas Lodge refers to a fourth play with &#145;<i>Muscovian</i> strangers&#146; and &#145;<i>Scythian</i> monsters&#146; and &#145;one <i>Eurus</i> brought upon one stage in ships made of Sheepskins&#146;. None succeeded.<br>
<br>By 1579 Gosson began a euphuistic romance, <span class="italic">The Ephemerides of Phialo</span>, but he interrupted this in September to write, fairly rapidly, a euphuistic attack on the misuse of art, <span class="italic">The Schoole of Abuse</span> (1579). Here he argues that poetry, music, and plays should present models of virtuous action, and that bad art subjects men's and women's reason to passions. In a pamphlet interlocking epideictic, forensic, and deliberative forms of argument, he urges the lord mayor to refuse all letters patent to players and urges women to remain at home. In a now famous description of the Southwark playhouses, he talks of petty crime and prostitution, but that passage closely imitates Ovid and should not be taken as wholly contemporary. Nevertheless, Gosson's most telling point&#151;that the judgement of art necessarily relies on an understanding of human nature&#151;would become the key issue of dramatic criticism until the Restoration. The fact that Gosson attacked plays aroused instant responses. The most famous is the partially extant work of Thomas Lodge published without title-page in 1579, causing Gosson to reply in <span class="italic">An Apology of &#145;The Schoole of Abuse&#146;</span> appended to <span class="italic">The Ephemerides</span> (October 1579). There Gosson combines moral argument with personal experience and claims the final test of the efficacy of drama is in the results of performances. By the age of twenty-four, then, Gosson had become famous to some&#151;and notorious to others (including Sidney, whose <span class="italic">Defence of Poesie</span> cited Gosson's specific arguments in his refutation, and who may have been annoyed by Gosson's dedication of <span class="italic">The Schoole</span> to him). Gosson, meantime, retired to the country as a tutor and began working on an unfinished Latin treatise that is no longer extant.<br>
<br>In late 1580 Gosson received a copy of Lodge's rebuttal and spent another fourteen months reading Plato, patristic commentary, and Vives's work on Augustine, and mastering a new Attic style for more decisive argumentation. The result was <span class="italic">Playes Confuted in Five Actions</span> (1582). Concentrating solely on drama, Gosson defines plays by the four Aristotelian causes in <span class="italic">Physics</span>, 194&#150;5: efficient (the cause of plays is the devil); material (actors must necessarily counterfeit); formal (dramatic conventions violate nature); and final (plays cause the overflow of powerful affections). To these, in analogy to the five actions of a play, he adds a fifth cause of unification, showing that all four causes reinforce one another. Along the way he becomes the first Elizabethan anti-theatrical polemicist to cite the sanction against cross-dressing in <span class="roman">Deuteronomy</span>. Thus where <span class="italic">The Schoole</span> had argued that playgoers falter by imitating performers, <span class="italic">Playes Confuted</span> argues that both playgoers and players are transformed&#151;not actions but dispositions of the soul are corrupted. <span class="italic">Playes Confuted</span> was sold by <a name="cosubject_11121"></a><span class="headword">Thomas Gosson</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1577&#150;1598), a London <span class="occ">bookseller</span> in St Paul's Churchyard and later in Cheapside, who was admitted to the Stationers' Company on 4 February 1577, and who may have been Stephen's younger brother, although there is no documentary evidence to support this. Thomas's son, <a name="cosubject_69148"></a><span class="headword">Henry Gosson</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1601&#150;1630)<span class="occ"></span>, succeeded to the business and was admitted to the Stationers' Company on 3 August 1601. Henry's earliest publication entered on the Stationers' register was <span class="italic">A Recantacon of a Browniste</span> (1 July 1606). During the early seventeenth century he had a shop on London Bridge and was busy producing broadsides until 1630.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Stephen's increasing pious rigidity seems to have taken a strange turn: the next extant record is his registration in the <span class="roman">Pilgrim Book</span> of the English College at Rome on 15 April 1584, a Jesuit training ground for Catholics and converts meant to carry the Roman mission back to England. Two months later Gosson resigned, dispensed by Cardinal Severinus and departing for reasons of bad eyesight. The only satisfactory explanation is that Gosson was acting as an agent for Walsingham, and this seems borne out by the rest of Gosson's career. He returned to England and at thirty was appointed lecturer at St Martin Ludgate, a few hundred yards from St Paul's Cathedral. In 1585 he was made lecturer at St Dunstan and All Saints, Stepney, a far wealthier parish just east of London, where the parson, Humphrey Cole, was a former classmate of Gosson's at Corpus Christi. In October 1586 Gosson was appointed vicar of St Alban's Church, Sandridge, Hertfordshire, at the extraordinary salary of &pound;80. While St Dunstan was clearly protestant, it was surely not puritan: extant records show Gosson was loyal to the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, wore a surplice, used the sign of the cross at baptism, and conducted the service at a proper font in the front of the church&#151;easy assumptions that he was a puritan have no foundation in fact. He left St Alban's in December 1591 to become parson at Great Wigborough, Essex, at the bestowal of the queen, about 7 miles from Colchester. In 1596 he was called to Paul's Cross to preach; the sermon, <span class="italic">The Trumpet of War</span>, was published in 1598. This sermon may have led to his final appointment: on 8 April 1600 he was inducted as rector of St Botolph without Bishopsgate, London, one of England's wealthiest church livings, serving the Moorfields to the north and east of the city. Here he pursued his parishioners tirelessly for unpaid tithes, and conducted correspondence with the retired actor Edward Alleyn, founder of Dulwich College, with whom he set up a charity for three poor brethren of St Botolph.<br>
<br>Gosson married Elizabeth Acton (1554/5&#150;1615) of London on 25 April 1587, at St Dunstan; they had two sons and a daughter. Elizabeth died on 2 December 1615 at the age of sixty and was buried in the choir of old St Botolph. Their daughter, Elizabeth, who married Paul Bassano, died little more than a year later, on 23 March 1617. Nothing more is known of Gosson's sons, which suggests that they may have predeceased him. Gosson carried on alone, dying on 13 February 1625 in his parish. Four days later he was buried at his request in the chancel of St Botolph, near to his wife and daughter, and at night, to save costs. He was survived by a sister, a niece, and a cousin, as well as by his brother William, by then a gentleman and drum-major to James I. He left each of them bequests, the largest to William, but he also remembered his curate, his maidservant, his parish clerk, and the poor of each parish in which he had served.<br>
