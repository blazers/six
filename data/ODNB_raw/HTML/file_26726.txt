<span class="headword">Stuart,  Robert</span>  (1812&#150;1848), <span class="occ">historian</span>, eldest son of William Stuart, was born on 21 January 1812 in Glasgow, where his father was a merchant. When he was about a year old, because of his father's absence abroad on business, he was placed with his maternal grandfather, George Meliss, resident near Perth, and was strongly influenced by his grandmother, a descendant of the Stewarts of Invernahyle. In 1819 he joined his parents at Nice, thereafter accompanying them to Gibraltar. In 1821 he was sent to a boarding-school near Perth, and in 1825 his parents returned to Glasgow, where he settled with them and attended school.<br>
<br>The business depression of 1826 led Stuart's father to become a bookseller and publisher, with his son as assistant. In 1836 he turned to some new enterprise, and Stuart undertook the business himself and married; his wife's name is not known. He wrote Byronic verses for his father's <span class="italic">Literary Rambler</span> and edited his own <span class="italic">Scottish Monthly Magazine</span>, issued during 1836. In 1841 his friend John Buchanan of Glasgow showed him inscribed altars and other memorials of the Roman occupation of Scotland and expressed surprise that authors should have neglected such a fascinating subject. The result was Stuart's chief work, <span class="italic">Caledonia Romana: Roman Antiquities in Scotland</span> (1845), a work well regarded in its day, which ran to a posthumous second edition, with a memoir by David Thomson (1852). In 1848 Stuart published an antiquarian study of Glasgow. He died in Glasgow of cholera on 23 December 1848, and was survived by his wife and family.<br>
