<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cruickshank,  Andrew John Maxton</span>  (1907&#150;1988), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 25 December 1907 at 1A Castlehill, Aberdeen, the son of Andrew Cruickshank, a hall porter, and his wife, Ann Morrison Cadger, a stocking knitter. Cruickshank was educated at Aberdeen grammar school, which he left with the intention of becoming a civil engineer. He had been drawn to the theatre, however, and, having found his way into provincial repertory, spent eighteen months there before his London d&eacute;but in 1930, when he had a non-speaking part in the Paul Robeson <span class="italic">Othello</span>. Thereafter he built a career which encompassed both classical drama and less demanding West End fare. He performed in both Britain and America, notably in <span class="italic">Lysistrata</span> in 1936 at the Gate in London, and in a Shakespearian season at the Old Vic from 1937 to 1940, where he played a range of parts including Banquo to Laurence Olivier's Macbeth. He was one of the cast that performed John Gielgud's <span class="italic">Hamlet</span> at Elsinore in Denmark. After a first marriage to Stella Bickerton in 1934, which ended tragically the same year when she died of meningitis while pregnant, on 12 August 1939 Cruickshank married another actress, (Martha) Curigwen Lewis. They had one son and two daughters; one daughter, Marty, followed her father into the acting profession.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Cruickshank served in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, rising to the rank of major. He was appointed MBE in 1945. After the war he played Wolsey, Kent, and Julius Caesar at Stratford in 1950. In London he appeared in a variety of plays including Frederick Knott's <span class="italic">Dial M for Murder</span> (1952), Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee's <span class="italic">Inherit the Wind</span> (1960), Felicity Douglas and Henry Cecil's <span class="italic">Alibi for a Judge</span> (1965), and William Douglas-Home's <span class="italic">Lloyd George Knew my Father</span> (1973). He straddled with ease the two worlds of commercial theatre and art theatre: as far as the latter was concerned, he had a particular affinity for Ibsen, and performed with distinction in several of his major works, including <span class="italic">The Master Builder</span> (1963), <span class="italic">When We Dead Awaken</span> (1975), and <span class="italic">The Wild Duck</span> (1980). Cruickshank continued to move happily from one sphere to the other until the end of his career: he was at the National Theatre from 1978 to 1980, appeared in a revival of Sir David Lindsay's (or Lyndsay's) <span class="italic">The Thrie Estatis</span>, at the Edinburgh Festival in 1984, and in 1987 he was in the West End production of Jeffrey Archer's <span class="italic">Beyond Reasonable Doubt</span>. Cruickshank was taken ill during the run of this play and died of bronchopneumonia and heart failure on 29 April 1988 in Westminster Hospital, London.<br>
<br>Andrew Cruickshank learned his trade in the English theatre, but observers of his performances were rarely in any doubt as to his Scottishness, which manifested itself in mannerisms, and in the inflections of his voice, which owed not a little to the pulpit. Cruickshank himself commented &#145;There is a greater toughness in Scottish acting than I could find in my English colleagues&#146;  (Cruickshank, 101). However by the time he came to prominence with television audiences, he had acquired a genial, if crusty, benignity that belied a darker side of his professional persona. That could be seen in several of his stage performances, particularly in his Ibsen roles. <span class="italic">Dr Finlay's Casebook</span> (1962&#150;71), a BBC television series based on stories by A. J. Cronin, teamed Cruickshank as the older and wiser Dr Cameron with the enthusiastic but much brasher Dr Finlay (Bill Simpson). Together, with the help of their housekeeper, Janet (Barbara Mullen), they ministered to the medical&#151;and often non-medical&#151;needs of a pre-Second World War Scottish small town. In the course of over 150 episodes, Cruickshank was able to offer the most sustained Scottish characterization of his career. It was one which generated an enormous surge of popular affection both in Scotland and beyond. The series was later reprised on radio with the same cast, but to much less effect.<br>
<br>Cruickshank wrote a number of books on philosophical and religious matters, which he felt deserved rather more serious attention than they were given. At the height of his fame as Dr Cameron he appeared on a number of occasions on the airwaves discussing the work of the Danish philosopher S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard. His autobiography, published posthumously, alternates constantly between accounts of his professional activities, and meditations driven by a desire to apprehend &#145;the harmony of all things&#146;  (Cruickshank, 77). Although latterly he described himself as a &#145;protestant Anglican&#146;, in religion&#151;and in politics&#151;Cruickshank was an individualist and a freethinker rather than an orthodox believer.<br>
