<span class="headword">Taylor <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Martin]</span>,  Ann</span>  (1757&#150;1830), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 20 June 1757 in London, the daughter of Thomas Martin (1734/5&#150;1764), a disciple of George Whitefield, and his wife, Mary Plaxton (<i>d</i>. 1798?), daughter of a clergyman's son (or grandson) from Yorkshire. Her childhood was not happy. Her father, whom she adored despite his being a religious fundamentalist whose beliefs bordered on the deranged, died when she was six; her mother married again twice and Ann was neglected by her stepfather, a Mr Hewitt, and treated contemptuously by her half-siblings. At her day school in London, however, an enquiring mind and a flair for writing quickly marked her out; her &#145;poetic and often satirical effusions soon gained her a local celebrity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.15).<br>
<br>On 18 April 1781 at St Andrew's, Holborn, Ann married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27033/', "Isaac Taylor (1759&#150;1829)")</script>, a young engraver and committed dissenter whom she had known since childhood. He had initiated his courtship by secreting a poem in a teapot of hers that he had been commissioned to engrave. She responded indignantly in kind and there ensued a &#145;paper war, which, for a time, made the gossip of the little circle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiography</span>, 1.16), but which ended in their engagement. Isaac and Ann were singularly well matched&#151;in intelligence, in outlook, and in talents&#151;and remained deeply in love throughout their life together. There were eleven children, six of whom survived to adulthood: three girls (Ann, Jane, and Jemima) and three boys (Isaac, Martin, and Jefferys). Four became writers: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10681/', "Ann Gilbert (1782&#150;1866)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27039/', "Taylor, Jane")</script>], <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27039/', "Jane Taylor (1783&#150;1824)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27034/', "Isaac Taylor (1787&#150;1865)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27040/', "Jefferys Taylor (1792&#150;1853)")</script>.<br>
<br>Ann Taylor found the early years of her marriage hard; money was short and the responsibilities of motherhood were exacerbated by the frail health of her children. Constitutionally a worrier, she became so weighed down with cares that a friend was moved to warn her to take action to retain her husband's interest and affection. Since she had no other time to spare, her response was to institute a practice of reading aloud to him at mealtimes, thereby keeping her own mind active and providing material for subsequent discussion. This practice continued for over forty years and in due course made an important contribution to her children's education too&#151;though her daughter Ann believed that it also played havoc with her mother's digestion and hindered the children's acquiring the art of conversation.<br>
<br>Ann Taylor participated fully in her children's remarkable education, which was carried out almost exclusively at home. Her influence upon the characters and mental habits of her talented children was very considerable and gratefully acknowledged. However, despite her own early predilections she did not encourage her daughters Ann and Jane to write, being wont to declare that female authors &#145;would have done better to employ themselves in mending the family stockings&#146;  (Taylor, &#145;Memoirs&#146;, 1.28). It was a nice irony that she later became the first female member of the family to publish in her own name.<br>
<br>Ann Taylor's health was never strong and she suffered from deafness from quite an early age. The strain of nursing her husband through a near fatal illness in 1793 further undermined her constitution and she contended with frailty, and perhaps with migraines, for the rest of her life. Her character was not overshadowed by these infirmities. As her youngest child, Jemima, remembered in a letter of 26 January 1869, &#145;though an anxious temper, [she] had much native sprightliness, which sparkled beautifully sometimes&#146;  (Taylor collection, HD 588/6/107). Her daughter Ann annotated a portrait of her mother thus: &#145;She always wore a turban &hellip; The face and features generally give the idea of a larger woman than she was, but they retain the impression of constant pain, almost extreme deafness, and deep retired thought and feeling&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann Taylor Gilbert's Album</span>, 81).<br>
<br>Ann Taylor was a prolific and lively correspondent, writing regularly to her children whenever they were apart. The texts of many of these letters survive; in them the spirit of the youthful satirist gleams through the pages of sound maternal advice, together with an eye for detail and a striking gift for narrative. About 1811 she composed for Jemima, then thirteen, a manual of instruction&#151;a blend of spiritual, behavioural, and practical advice. The method was apparently chosen because Ann's increasing deafness made conversation difficult. She had originally no thought of its being published but was later persuaded that it would benefit a wider readership; in 1814 it was published as <span class="italic">Maternal Solicitude for a Daughter's Best Interests</span>. It sold extremely well, going into fifteen editions (two of them American) over the next sixteen years. There followed other works in the same vein: <span class="italic">Practical Hints to Young Females</span> (1815); <span class="italic">The Present of a Mistress to a Young Servant</span> (1816); <span class="italic">Reciprocal Duties of Parents and Children</span> (1818); and, in collaboration with her daughter Jane, <span class="italic">Correspondence between a Mother and her Daughter at School</span> (1817). Most proved equally popular and influential. Their tone was moral but lacking in sanctimony, and the advice on parenthood and education strikingly permissive for its time. Ann also published two moralistic novellas, or &#145;tales&#146;, for the young&#151;<span class="italic">The Family Mansion</span> (1819) and <span class="italic">Retrospection: a Tale</span> (1821)&#151;and a collection of moral essays, <span class="italic">The Itinerary of a Traveller in the Wilderness</span> (1825), a work much preoccupied with death and the afterlife.<br>
<br>In her own eyes, however, Ann Taylor's true monument was her family, to whom, after God, her life was devoted. An unidentified visitor to the Taylor household in 1824 declared, &#145;I never met with a person so truly great and yet so affectionately tender as Mrs Taylor&#146;  (Armitage, 85). Yet the tenderness was spiced with an acerbic wit. Her husband's death on 12 December 1829 apparently deprived her of the will to live; having survived him by less than six months she died at her home in Ongar on 27 May 1830. She was buried at the Independent burial-ground in Ongar on 4 June; her grave, beside that of her husband, now lies under the vestry floor of the United Reformed church in Ongar.<br>
