<span class="headword">Kennedy,  Gilbert</span>, second earl of Cassillis  (<em>c.</em>1492&#150;1527), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54248/', "David Kennedy, first earl of Cassillis (d. 1513)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54242/', "Kennedy family (per. c.1350&#150;1513)")</script>], and his wife, Agnes Borthwick (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1460, <i>d</i>. in or before 1509), daughter of William, third Lord Borthwick. He was the chief of a kindred which had been prominent in southern Ayrshire since the mid-fourteenth century. When his father was killed at Flodden in 1513, Gilbert, who was almost certainly already of age and married to Isobella Campbell (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1495, <i>d</i>. in or after 1533), daughter of the second earl of Argyll, succeeded as second earl of Cassillis and fourth Lord Kennedy. He and Isobella had seven sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15368/', "Gilbert Kennedy, third earl of Cassillis")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15389/', "Quintin Kennedy")</script>, abbot of Crossraguel, and at least three daughters. Gilbert supported the duke of Albany, governor of Scotland during the earlier years of James V's minority, and in 1515 was among the forces besieging the queen dowager in Stirling Castle. He was one of the ambassadors sent to England in February 1516 and on 14 November that year the town of Maybole was created a free burgh in barony for him. In March 1523 he was paid &pound;150 by parliament for remaining for three months with the young king during Albany's second absence in France.<br>
<br>When Albany finally quit Scotland in May 1524, Cassillis joined the earl of Arran's party, and during the winters of 1524 and 1525 he was again in England negotiating peace. He was acquitted of the murder of Martin Kennedy of Lochland and Gilbert Makilwraith by an assize presided over by his brother-in-law the third earl of Argyll on 13 June 1525 and on 18 June 1526 he was granted a respite, along with many of his kindred and dependants, for the murder of Cornelius Machtema, a Dutch merchant killed during the sitting of parliament, and other offences. In August, as the Douglases tightened their hold on government, Cassillis withdrew from council. He backed the earl of Lennox's efforts to wrest James V from the control of the sixth earl of Angus and on 4 September was with the army that unsuccessfully opposed Angus and Arran at Linlithgow. His estates were subsequently forfeited and nominally awarded to Arran, but on 25 November he was discharged of treason&#151;a letter from James V enlisting his support was produced in his defence.<br>
<br>A dispute over the ownership of Turnberry and other lands in Carrick caused relations between Cassillis and his territorial rival Sir Hugh Campbell of Loudoun, sheriff of Ayr, to deteriorate. On 11 July 1527 the case was submitted before the lords of council, but on 23 July Cassillis complained that Loudoun, a follower of Angus, had privately persuaded members of council to subscribe a decreet in his favour. Before due process could be exhausted the earl was murdered, at Loudoun's instigation, on the sands beside Prestwick some time between 24 and 31 August 1527. Loudoun was outlawed for the crime on 5 October, but escaped punishment through crown patronage. By tradition the Kennedys swore beneath the dule tree of Cassillis to revenge his death, and in actuality retaliated by killing Robert Campbell of Lochfergus. The second earl was buried in Maybole collegiate church.<br>
