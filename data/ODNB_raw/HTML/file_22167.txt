<span class="headword">Phillips, Sir  Richard</span>  (1767&#150;1840), <span class="occ">author and publisher</span>, the son of a Leicestershire farmer, was born in London; his name at birth may have been Philip Richards. He was sent to schools in Soho Square and at Chiswick by his uncle, a brewer in Oxford Street, but his home surroundings were distasteful to him, and in 1786 he started on his own account as usher in a school at Chester. In 1788 he moved to Leicester, where he invested his small means in a commercial academy in Bond Street. A year later he opened a hosier's shop, which he stocked with borrowed capital; but it was not until the summer of 1790, when he commenced business as a stationer, bookseller, and patent medicine vendor, that he found his proper vocation. He soon added a printing press, and, when his already heterogeneous business began to prosper, he expanded by selling pianofortes, music, caricatures, and prints, and running a circulating library.<br>
<br>Phillips held unorthodox opinions in matters of literature and science; he conceived at an early stage a rooted idea that the theory of gravitation had no foundation, and he developed strong radical and republican views in politics. His shop became a depot for the advanced democratic literature of the revolutionary epoch, and, to give further expression to his views, Phillips founded in May 1792 the <span class="italic">Leicester Herald</span>. His paper proved a success, and as editor he showed considerable skill in avoiding prosecutions; but in January 1793, on the evidence of a paid informer named Jackson, he was found guilty of selling Thomas Paine's <span class="italic">Rights of Man</span>, and was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment. From Leicester gaol, then under the control of Daniel Lambert, he continued to edit the <span class="italic">Leicester Herald</span>, and succeeded in obtaining the co-operation of Dr Joseph Priestley of Birmingham. In 1795 he married Elizabeth Griffiths, a milliner's assistant, the daughter of Captain John Griffiths of Tenby. They had four daughters and three sons: Richard, Alfred (later a vicar of Kilmersdon), and Horatio (later a bookseller in Paris).<br>
<br>In May 1795 Phillips added to his other ventures a fortnightly magazine of a semi-scientific nature, entitled <span class="italic">The Museum</span>, but a disastrous fire put an end to both this and the <span class="italic">Herald</span>. With the funds derived from his insurance policy Phillips moved to London, and opened business in St Paul's Churchyard, establishing the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, the first number of which appeared on 1 July 1796. It was edited by John Aikin (1747&#150;1822), and among the contributors were John Wolcot (Peter Pindar), Capel Lofft, and Dr Mavor, while Phillips himself wrote trenchant articles against the government, under the signature Common Sense. In 1806 he quarrelled with Aikin, whose place was taken by George Gregory, and in the next year he founded the short-lived <span class="italic">Antiquary's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>In the meantime, in spite of his peculiarities and irascible temper, Phillips's business prospered, and he moved in 1806 to larger premises in Little Bridge Street, Blackfriars. His publications included vast numbers of elementary school books and cheap manuals, issued under a variety of pseudonyms. French, Italian, and Latin dictionaries and phrase books, for instance, appeared as by the Abb&eacute; Bossuet; and geographical and scientific works by the Revd J. Goldsmith. Some of these works were compiled by Mavor, Watkins, Gregory, and others of Phillips's assistants; in others, however, such as <span class="italic">A Popular Dictionary of Facts and Knowledge</span> (1827?), <span class="italic">A Dictionary of the Arts of Life and Civilisation</span>, and <span class="italic">A Million of Facts</span> (1832?), Phillips seems to have been the primary author. Several of these works passed through numerous editions. At midsummer 1807 Phillips was elected a sheriff of London, and as the bearer of an address from the corporation to George III, he was knighted by the king on 30 March 1808. During his shrievalty Phillips established the sheriff's fund for the relief of poor debtors, and placed the sponging-houses under better regulations. In this capacity he wrote and published <span class="italic">A Letter to the Livery of London Relative to the Duties and Office of Sheriff</span> (1808), and <span class="italic">A Treatise on the Powers and Duties of Juries, and on the Criminal Laws of England</span> (1811).<br>
<br>Subsequently Phillips's affairs went into decline, but through the generosity of a former apprentice he was enabled to repurchase the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> and many of his best copyrights, and continued his publisher's business on a somewhat more restricted scale, until in 1823 he retired to Brighton. He died there on 2 April 1840.<br>
<br>John Wilson (Christopher North) called Phillips &#145;a dirty little Jacobin&#146;, with no literary ability and absurd scientific views; but he later allowed him the virtue of political consistency, and confessed the <span class="italic">Monthly</span> to be a valuable periodical. Tom Moore considered Phillips a bore, and laughed at his &#145;Pythagorean diet&#146;, for from an early date Phillips practised strict vegetarianism; his devotion to its tenets is depicted by George Borrow in his <span class="italic">Lavengro</span>, and is also seen in Phillips's publication of John Ritson's <span class="italic">An Essay on Abstinence from Animal Food, as a Moral Duty</span> in 1802. Augustus De Morgan credited him with honesty, zeal, ability, and courage, but adds that &#145;he applied them all in teaching matters about which he knew nothing&#146;, and so made himself ridiculous. Particularly irritating to De Morgan was Phillips's pretentious work on the principles of universal causation, entitled <span class="italic">The Proximate Causes of Material Phenomena</span> (1821, 1824). Phillips was a patron of Samuel Bamford and other radical contemporaries, and it was he who, after hearing Coleridge talk at a dinner party, exclaimed that he wished he had him in a garret without a coat to his back. Despite his authorship of works such as <span class="italic">A Morning's Walk from London to Kew</span> (1817) and <span class="italic">Golden Rules of Social Philosophy</span> (1826), his chief importance was as a purveyor of cheap miscellaneous literature designed for popular instruction, and in this vein as the predecessor of the brothers Chambers and of Charles Knight.<br>
