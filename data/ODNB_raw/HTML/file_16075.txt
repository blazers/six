<span class="headword">Larpent,  Francis Seymour</span>  (1776&#150;1845), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 15 September 1776, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16077/', "John Larpent (1741&#150;1824)")</script>, inspector of plays, and his first wife, Frances (<i>d</i>. 1777), daughter of Maximilian Western of Cokethorpe Park, Oxfordshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16076/', "Sir George Gerard Larpent")</script> was his half-brother. He was educated at Cheam School under William Gilpin. He graduated BA from St John's College, Cambridge, as sixth wrangler in 1799, was elected fellow, and proceeded MA in 1802. In 1799 he was admitted at Lincoln's Inn, and studied for some time under John Bayley, the eminent special pleader, before being called to the bar (1803). He went the western circuit but did little business, though he made some useful friendships. Charles Manners Sutton, judge-advocate-general, selected him in 1812 to go as deputy judge-advocate-general to the forces engaged in the Peninsular War, where his task was to make the procedure of the courts martial more efficient. He remained until 1814 at headquarters with Wellington, who thought highly of his services  (<span class="italic">The Dispatches of Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington</span>, ed. J. Gurwood, 6, 1836, 360). In August 1813 he was taken prisoner, but was exchanged almost immediately  (ibid., 737, 761).<br>
<br>In 1814 Larpent was made a commissioner of customs. About the same time he was appointed civil and Admiralty judge for Gibraltar, where a new code was being prepared. He took part in arranging the court martial on General Sir John Murray at Winchester and was a member of the commission which investigated the escape of American prisoners from Dartmoor. He married on 15 March 1815 Catherine Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1822), second daughter of Frederick Reeves of East Sheen, Surrey.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1815 Larpent was invited by the prince regent to inquire into the improprieties that the Princess Caroline was alleged to have committed abroad, but he wisely insisted that his appointment should proceed from the government directly, and that he should be employed to sift the facts rather than gather partisan evidence. Although he nominally set out to take up his work at Gibraltar, he went to Vienna, where he was accredited to Count M&uuml;nster, and began his investigations into the princess's conduct, with the result that he dissuaded the prince regent's advisers from bringing her to public trial. He travelled from there to Gibraltar, where he remained until 1820, when he was again employed in secret service inquiries into Princess Caroline.<br>
<br>In 1821 Lord Liverpool made Larpent one of the commissioners of the board of audit of the public accounts. In 1826 he became its chairman, and in 1843 he retired. Following the death of his first wife, he married secondly, on 10 December 1829, Charlotte Rosamund (<i>d</i>. 1879), daughter of George Arnold Arnold of Halstead Place, Kent. Both marriages were childless. Larpent died at Holmwood, near Dorking, Surrey, on 21 May 1845, and was buried in the family vault there. When in the Peninsula, Larpent wrote descriptive letters to his stepmother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65588/', "Anna Margaretta Larpent")</script>. Publication of this important first-hand account of Wellington's headquarters was deferred until after Wellington's death. The letters were edited, with a biographical preface by Larpent's half-brother, Sir George Larpent, first baronet (1786&#150;1855), in 1853 and passed through three editions in the same year. A facsimile reprint of the third, one-volume, edition, with a new introduction, appeared in 2000.<br>
