<span class="headword">Renison, Sir  Patrick Muir</span>  (1911&#150;1965), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was born on 24 March 1911 at 14 Cavendish Drive, Tranmere, Birkenhead, Cheshire, the son of William John Henry Renison, a marine insurance company assistant secretary, and his wife, Violet Douglas, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Willoughby. He was educated at Uppingham School and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. A large, rather rubicund individual, he excelled on the rugby field but was a mediocre student.<br>
<br>On graduation in 1932 Renison entered the colonial service, and was seconded for his first three years to the Colonial Office in Downing Street as an assistant principal. In 1935 he went to Ceylon, and in the following year he married Eleanor Hope Gibb. They had one daughter. Renison served in Ceylon until 1944, before returning for another four years to the Colonial Office. This was an unusual career, as few overseas administrators ever served in the Colonial Office in London, which was staffed by members of the home civil service, selected by competitive examination. Ceylon, moreover, with the possible exception of Palestine and Malta, was the most &#145;advanced&#146; of Britain's colonial territories, already well on the way to dominion status with the full panoply of responsible government and semi-ministerial powers.<br>
<br>In 1948 Renison became colonial secretary in Trinidad and Tobago. Four years later he was appointed governor of British Honduras, a quiet backwater, and then in 1955 governor of British Guiana, a much more demanding position. In the previous year his predecessor had suspended the left-wing government of Cheddi Jagan, reinstituting direct rule. Renison proved adept at sidestepping political land-mines and made some progress in improving relations between the East Asian and African communities, while reducing suspected communist influence and gradually restoring some power to the elected members of the legislative council. He was made CMG in 1950 and KCMG in 1955.<br>
<br>Renison's success in British Guiana led to his appointment as governor of Kenya in 1959, during the closing days of the Mau Mau emergency, despite the fact that he had never served in Africa. Iain Macleod, the new secretary of state, was determined to transfer power to African moderates as quickly as possible, and decided that there were political advantages in appointing a non-Africanist to this demanding post. He was soon disappointed, as Renison was quickly &#145;captured&#146; by the Kenya administration and, unlike Macleod, persuaded of the need to proceed slowly. Although Renison remained governor until the end of 1962, policy was increasingly determined in London, driven by Whitehall's response to the demands of African nationalists, and the governor and his advisers in the Kenya administration found themselves increasingly bypassed. The first Lancaster House conference in January 1960 saw the acceptance of African primacy and rapid progress to independence under an African government. This was confirmed by the 1961 election, which centred on Jomo Kenyatta's release from detention, and by the second and third Lancaster House conferences in 1962 and 1963 which devised the new independence constitution.<br>
<br>Renison is best remembered in Kenya for dismissing Kenyatta, still in detention, in a radio broadcast after the election of 1961 as &#145;the leader to darkness and death&#146;  (Kyle, 114). The governor appears to have accepted uncritically the results of an investigation into the origins of Mau Mau, which defended Kenyatta's detention as the organizer of Mau Mau. This report, by F. C. Corfield, was belatedly published in 1960 as part of an attempt by elements in the Kenyan administration to prevent Kenyatta's political rehabilitation. In the end, however, Renison had to back down, first accepting Kenyatta's release, then his election to the legislative council, and finally his appointment as joint leader of government business with Ronald Ngala, leader of the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU). Renison managed to survive both these changes and the appointment of Reginald Maudling as secretary of state in 1961, but he soon fell out with Maudling's acerbic successor, Duncan Sandys. Many observers had not expected the governor to return from the second Lancaster House conference in spring 1962, which led to the formation of a coalition government between Kenyatta's Kenya African National Union (KANU) and Ngala's KADU, but he had soldiered on, attempting to establish a relationship of trust with the Kikuyu leader.<br>
<br>The marriage of Renison's daughter to the son of the Kenya National Farmers' Union leader, Lord Delamere, did little to reassure Africans, all too vividly highlighting the ties between Government House and the colony's settler aristocracy. Sandys, moreover, quickly became dissatisfied with the pace of progress and disliked Renison's low-profile manner. The new secretary of state wanted a more political, pro-nationalist, and publicity-seeking proconsul to preside over the final stages of the transfer of power. In November 1962 he recalled Renison to London for consultations and then abruptly sacked him to make way for the politically adept Malcolm MacDonald.<br>
<br>Renison was made a GCMG but, at the age of fifty-one, his career was effectively over. A former rugby player, he served briefly in 1963 as adviser to Lord Hailsham on sport and physical recreation before becoming the following year joint vice-chairman of the British Red Cross Society. He was also a governor of Queen Elizabeth House at Oxford. Shattered by his dismissal, Renison's health rapidly deteriorated, and he died in a London hospital, Beaumont House, Beaumont Street, Marylebone, on 11 November 1965.<br>
