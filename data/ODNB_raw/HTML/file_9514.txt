<span class="headword">Fisk,  William Henry</span>  (1827&#150;1884), <span class="occ">landscape and historical genre painter and drawing teacher</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9513/', "William Fisk (1796&#150;1872)")</script>, a painter of portraits and historical subjects, and his wife, Margaret Thomas; he was baptized on 23 June 1827 at St Mary's, Marylebone Road, Middlesex. Fisk studied with his father, and attended the Royal Academy Schools. He first exhibited at the Society of British Artists, Suffolk Street, in 1846, and continued to show there until 1862. He also exhibited at the Royal Academy (1850&#150;73), and the British Institution (1856&#150;63). Among the works exhibited at the Royal Academy were a number of scenes from the history of the French Revolution.<br>
<br>In 1849 Fisk was one of the first of several watercolour painters invited to Balmoral to paint for Queen Victoria. He produced a folio of &#145;Finished Water-Colours Copied from Nature&#146; from which the queen chose four paintings: <span class="italic">Abergeldie Castle: Distant View</span>, <span class="italic">Birkhall</span>, <span class="italic">Crathie Church: Distant View</span>, and <span class="italic">Loch Muick: the East End at Noon</span> (all Royal Collection). These were added to one of the souvenir albums which the queen and the prince consort had compiled after their marriage in 1840. The paintings are not particularly original, but they do have noteworthy and attractive qualities. Both <span class="italic">Abergeldie Castle</span> and <span class="italic">Loch Muick</span> show that Fisk handled the effects of light and shade particularly well, and in the former work there is a pleasing use of colour in the hills in the distance, where soft shades of green and brown are blended with sensitivity. The composition and perspective in all four paintings are well executed, and the colours used in <span class="italic">Birkhall</span> convey the freshness and brightness of the outdoors. The obituaries for Fisk in <span class="italic">The Times</span> (21 November 1884) and <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> (22 November 1884) both comment upon his having produced a series of drawings of trees for Victoria which were &#145;much admired&#146;, but their whereabouts are unknown.<br>
<br>Fisk's <span class="italic">Ben Nevis from above Navin</span> (1868; V&amp;A) is a more assured and skilful example of his work but shares qualities with those he painted at Balmoral nineteen years earlier. In 1868, however, his use of colours, rendering of sunlight, and wide composition (as in <span class="italic">Crathie Church</span>) to include as much of the surrounding landscape as possible have been developed and refined. It was not only as a landscape painter that Fisk found success. He designed the figures, in oil on canvas on a gold ground, of Albrecht D&uuml;rer and Lorenzo Ghiberti for a series of mosaics which were installed in the South Kensington Museum grill room in 1869. His masterpiece was considered to be the <span class="italic">Last Night of Christ in his Nazarene Home</span>, painted in a detailed style influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1864, and at the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1867.<br>
<br>Fisk taught drawing and painting at University College, London, for nearly forty years. He was remembered as an &#145;extremely active, conscientious, and successful&#146; teacher whose services as head drawing-master were of &#145;manifest benefit to the establishment&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 22 Nov 1884). Fisk used his skills as a draughtsman well, being appointed anatomical draughtsman to the Royal College of Surgeons, and teaching the study of &#145;living and draped models&#146;  (Millar, 322) at the Society of Female Artists in 1868. He wanted to improve the standard of drawing &#145;in our great Public Schools&#146;  (ibid.) and with this in mind he obtained permission to study the old master drawings in the Royal Collection in November 1871. He occasionally contributed articles on painting to national newspapers and journals, and was also a lecturer on the practical aspects of art whose &#145;clear and logical&#146; style attracted large audiences in London and the provinces  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 22 Nov 1884).<br>
<br>Fisk died suddenly of heart disease on 13 November 1884 at his London home, 27 Church Row, Hampstead. His obituary in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> states that his paintings &#145;attained considerable popularity about forty-five years ago&#146; and notes that it was as a very able teacher of drawing and painting that he &#145;became best known&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 22 Nov 1884).<br>
