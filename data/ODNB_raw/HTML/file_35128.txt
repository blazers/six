<span class="headword">Moule,  George Evans</span>  (1828&#150;1912), <span class="occ">bishop of mid-China</span>, was born on 28 January 1828 at Gillingham, Dorset, the second of the eight sons of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19426/', "Revd Henry Moule (1801&#150;1880)")</script>, then curate-in-charge at Gillingham and from 1829 to 1880 vicar of Fordington, Dorchester, and his wife, Mary Mullett, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Evans (1801&#150;1877). He was the brother of <a href="#cosubject_56160">Arthur Evans Moule [<i>see below</i>]</a> and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35129/', "Handley Carr Glyn Moule")</script>. He was educated at home until 1844, in which year he underwent a sudden conversion, the result of a sermon on <span class="roman">Acts</span> 28: 24, by Augustus Handley, his father's curate. The effect never passed away: it conditioned his whole subsequent life. In 1844 he was admitted sizar at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and in 1850 he graduated with mathematical and classical honours. James Scholefield, the regius professor of Greek, and Frederick Foster Gough helped to turn his thoughts to work abroad. He was ordained deacon at Salisbury in 1851 as curate to his father, and priest in 1852, and he acted as tutor to his father's pupils. From 1855 to 1857 he was also chaplain of the Dorset County Hospital.<br>
<br>In 1857 Moule offered his services to the Church Missionary Society, and in the December of that year he sailed for Shanghai. On the way, at Hong Kong, he married Adelaide Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1909), daughter of Frederick Moule, of Melksham, Wiltshire, and widow of Captain Griffiths; she accompanied him in his missionary travels and the couple had seven children. He was stationed at Ningpo (Ningbo) from 1857 to 1864; in the latter year he began a mission in Hangchow (Hangzhou), in Chekiang (Zhejiang) province, then practically destroyed by the Taiping insurgents. From 1865 to the end of his life the house in Hangchow was his only home. In 1864 he became a member of the Royal Asiatic Society, China branch, and most of his writings were papers in its journal. On the death of Bishop William Armstrong Russell, of north China, he was consecrated (on 28 October 1880 in London) first bishop of the new diocese of mid-China, a post which he held until his resignation in 1906. In 1905 he was elected an honorary fellow by his Cambridge college. He continued to work under the Church Missionary Society until his death, which took place at Auckland Castle, Bishop Auckland, co. Durham, on 3 March 1912, while he was on a visit to England. He was buried in Bow cemetery at Durham.<br>
<br>George Moule was a man of wide interests: music, drawing, woodturning, medicine, swimming, botany (he introduced some hitherto unknown plants to science), and especially literature; all attracted him, and he attained exceptional command of the Chinese language, literary and colloquial. All this, however, was secondary to his missionary work, at which he laboured incessantly by prayer, preaching, teaching, translating, and church administration. During his time in China he had considerable success relative to that of his colleagues: the church membership in Chekiang increased from fewer than 100 to more than 4000. It was a son of one of his early pupils who became the first Chinese bishop&#151;Tsaeseng Sing, assistant bishop in Chekiang. Gentleness, reverence, humour, courage, and diligence were conspicuous in Moule, endearing him to a wide and varied circle of friends.<br>
<br>His brother <a name="cosubject_56160"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Evans Moule</span>  (1836&#150;1918)<span class="occ"></span> was ordained in London in 1861 and went as a missionary to Ningpo in the same year; he served there until 1869, witnessing in 1861 and 1862 the various attempts of the Taipings to capture the city. He returned to Britain in 1869 and from 1871 to 1876 was again at Ningpo. From 1876 to 1879 he was at Hangchow, and from 1882 he was secretary of the mission at Shanghai; he became archdeacon of Shanghai in 1890. Ill health required his return to Britain in April 1894. Moule published widely on Chinese affairs and translated works into Chinese. He took an especial interest in the opium trade, publishing <span class="italic">The Opium Question</span> (1877) and addressing the church congress at Newcastle on it in 1881. He was married in 1861 to Eliza Agnes Bernau, younger daughter of John Henry Bernau, of Pomerania, also a missionary; three of their children&#151;Walter Stephen Moule, Arthur John Henry Moule, and William Augustus Handley Moule&#151;were missionaries in China. After returning to Britain, Moule was rector of Compton Valence, Dorset, from 1898 to 1902. He was then again in China until 1910. He died on 26 August 1918.<br>
