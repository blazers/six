<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lampe,  John Frederick</span>  (1702/3&#150;1751), <span class="occ">composer and bassoonist</span>, of unknown parentage, was said to be a native of Saxony  (Burney, <span class="italic">Hist. mus.</span>, 2.1001), and, according to his tombstone epitaph, was born in late 1702 or early 1703. Lampe's treatise <span class="italic">A Plain and Compendious Method of Teaching Thorough Bass</span> (1737) states he was &#145;Sometime Student at <i>HELMSTAD</i> in <i>SAXONY</i>&#146;; he was therefore assumed to have been born in Helmst&auml;dt, but his birth is not recorded in Helmst&auml;dt archives. Record of Lampe's 1718 matriculation as a law student at the university there, however, links him to nearby Brunswick, and he has also been connected with St Catherine's School in that city. Nothing is known of his career before he arrived in London about 1725, when he became a bassoon player in the opera band. According to Burney, Handel had the first British contrabassoon made for Lampe to play for George II's 1727 coronation  (Burney, <span class="italic">Account</span>, &#145;Introduction&#146;, 7).<br>
<br>The pantomime <span class="italic">Diana and Acteon</span> (1730), written for the Drury Lane dancing-master Roger, is the earliest theatre work attributed to Lampe. <span class="italic">Wit Musically Embellish'd</span> (1731), a collection of original ballads, was his first musical publication; in it he says that most of the songs were written for his students or patrons. The poet Henry Carey may have numbered among those students  (Hawkins, 2.895). In 1732, as part of a concerted English opera &#145;revival&#146;, Lampe set Carey's <span class="italic">Amelia</span> for the Little Theatre in the Haymarket. The following season Lampe wrote music for Thomas Lediard's masque-like <span class="italic">Britannia</span> and arranged John Gay's <span class="italic">Dione</span> and also Henry Fielding's <span class="italic">Tragedy of Tragedies</span> as <span class="italic">The Opera of Operas</span>. For the 1733&#150;4 season he was employed at Drury Lane, where he achieved his first major success with the pantomime <span class="italic">Cupid and Psyche, or, Columbine Courtezan</span>. Theatre politics meant Lampe wrote little theatrical music from 1734 to 1737, and he instead completed his thorough-bass treatise.<br>
<br>In 1737 Lampe returned to the Haymarket Theatre with his enormously successful <span class="italic">Dragon of Wantley</span>, a burlesque opera by Carey. Reputedly a favourite with Handel and with George II, it was performed every season until Lampe's death and its popularity continued throughout the century, though its 1738 sequel, <span class="italic">Margery, or, A Worse Plague than the Dragon</span>, was less successful. The composer married his leading lady, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65896/', "Isabella Young (bap. 1716?, d. 1795)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69663/', "Young family")</script>], on 31 January 1737. Lampe continued to work in satirical and comic vein, writing music for pantomimes and mock operas such as <span class="italic">Pyramus and Thisbe</span> (1745). He wrote another treatise, <span class="italic">The Art of Musick</span> (1740), and composed many songs, published in the collections of others&#151;such as <span class="italic">British Melody</span> (1739) and <span class="italic">The Musical Entertainer</span> (1737&#150;40)&#151;and in collections of his own, for instance <span class="italic">Lyra Britannica</span> (1741). Lampe's two hymn collections set to words by Charles Wesley demonstrate the Wesleys' influence on him from 1745 onwards. John Wesley's diary for 29 October 1745 reveals that Lampe &#145;had been a deist for many years, till it pleased God, by the <i>Earnest Appeal</i>, to bring him to a better mind&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 3.226).<br>
<br>In September 1748 Lampe, Isabella, and a small company went to Dublin at Thomas Sheridan's invitation, where he conducted theatrical performances and concerts. Benjamin Victor called the musicians Sheridan's &#145;woeful Bargains&#146;, as &#145;the Tot of their Salaries &hellip; was near fourteen hundred Pounds a Year&#146;  (Victor, 1.143). In November 1750 Lampe moved to Edinburgh for a similar engagement at the Canongate Theatre. He died in Edinburgh on 25 July 1751, and was buried on 28 July in Canongate churchyard, where his monument predicted, somewhat over-optimistically, that his &#145;harmonious compositions shall outlive monumental registers, and, with melodious notes, through future ages, perpetuate his fame&#146;.<br>
