<span class="headword">Hussey <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Reed]</span>,  Anna Maria</span>  (1805&#150;1853), <span class="occ">mycologist and botanical illustrator</span>, was born at Leckhampstead, Buckinghamshire, on 5 June 1805, the eldest of seven children of John Theodore Archibald Reed (1758/9&#150;1830), curate and later rector of Leckhampstead, and his second wife, Anna Maria, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dayrell (1777&#150;1848). Nothing is known of Hussey's formal education, and she may have been educated at home. Her interest in natural history was perhaps encouraged by her father, a champion of vaccination. Her sisters Henrietta (1807&#150;1860) and Frances (1810&#150;1872) were keen botanists; Frances was also an accomplished botanical illustrator. Anna Maria's journal of a holiday in Dover, in 1836, written for Henrietta, suggests that her first love was geology, but on this holiday she developed an interest in botany, in order to answer the questions of her youngest sister, Catherine (1817&#150;1852), who accompanied her.<br>
<br>On 18 August 1831 Anna Maria married Thomas John Hussey (<i>b</i>. 1797), rector of Hayes in north Kent from 1831 to 1854, who was son of John Hussey, of Lamberhurst, Kent. They had six children between 1832 and 1842, only two of whom survived to adulthood. Her husband was both a theologian and an astronomer and corresponded with, among others, Charles Darwin, Charles Babbage, Sir John Herschel, William Henry Fox Talbot, and the jurist and mathematician John Thomas Graves. The Hussey family also knew the Darwins at Downe and one of Anna Maria's younger brothers, George Varenne Reed (1814&#150;1886), who succeeded her husband as rector of Hayes, was tutor to Darwin's sons.<br>
<br>Hussey's own interest was in the field of mycology, and from at least 1843 she corresponded with the clergyman and mycologist Miles Joseph Berkeley. These letters are the main source of information about her. She sent him specimens and drawings to comment on, often asking his help and advice. Although she regarded him as a mentor she was willing to disagree with him in the light of her own experience or observations. Berkeley, in turn, had a high regard for her abilities, naming the genus of fungi <i>Husseia</i> &#145;after my friend Mrs Hussey, whose talents well deserve such a distinction&#146;  (Berkeley correspondence). Her other friendships among mycologists included Charles David Badham (1805&#150;1857), to whom Berkeley introduced her.<br>
<br>Hussey is best known for her <span class="italic">Illustrations of British mycology: containing figures and descriptions of the funguses of interest and novelty indigenous to Britain</span>, published in two series in 1847 and 1855 under the authorship of Mrs T. J. Hussey. The work consists of two series of coloured lithographic plates, numbering ninety and fifty plates respectively, both series being originally issued in parts. The second series was probably intended to contain sixty plates, but was cut short by her death; the final plate was contributed by Berkeley. Hussey herself expressed dissatisfaction at the work of the lithographers, regarding engraving as better suited to ensuring the &#145;great exactness&#146; needed for her subject matter  (Berkeley correspondence). The plates are prefaced by an introduction on collecting and studying fungi, accompanied by detailed commentaries. These combine scientific description with information from history, literature, and folklore, and also contain advice on cooking fungi together with personal observations and anecdotes, all written in a lively and amusing style. The work was intended especially for mothers wanting to teach their children about the study of fungi. She felt strongly that children should be taught to appreciate the natural world at an early age, and that the study of natural history was a particularly appropriate pursuit for young women.<br>
<br>In addition to her mycological writing and illustration Hussey contributed in 1845 and 1846 to <span class="italic">The Surplice</span>, a Church of England periodical edited by her husband, and which from October 1846 carried advertisements for her series on British mycology. Only a few of her contributions have been identified, though she probably wrote the anonymous romantic serial &#145;Leaves of Life&#146;. In May and June 1849 <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span> published her anonymous story &#145;Matrimony&#146;, which, she explained to Berkeley, was written as a way of relieving &#145;personal feeling of the most painful kind&#146;  (Berkeley correspondence); it is a strange tale of illegitimacy, bigamy, and adultery.<br>
<br>Hussey's last years were clouded by the sudden death, in 1852, of her sister Catherine, whose husband, Benjamin Hill, took up a chaplaincy at Valpara&iacute;so, accompanied by his children and Hussey's two remaining sisters. She died in Paris on 26 August 1853, where she was said to have been &#145;left alone by her husband, the Revd Dr Hussey, who was last heard of in Algiers&#146;  (biographical note, diary of a holiday to Dover, 2). Thomas Hussey resigned the living of Hayes in 1854.<br>
<br>Reviewers praised the beauty, detail, and accuracy of <span class="italic">Illustrations of British Mycology</span>, though the work's cost, and quarto size, made it an impractical companion for field work. In 1886 William Phillips described the text as &#145;suggestive of the drawing-room&#146;, but rated the illustrations as standing &#145;in the first rank of excellence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of Botany</span>, 24 1886, 252). Hussey never claimed to make a serious scientific contribution to the study of fungi, but her work deserves to be better known, both for the beauty of the illustrations and for the lively and entertaining text.<br>
