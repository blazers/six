<span class="headword">Fulton,  Margaret Barr</span>  (1900&#150;1989), <span class="occ">occupational therapist</span>, was born on 14 February 1900 at Bank House, Cheetham Hill, Manchester, the youngest of the five children of Dr Andrew Boyd Fulton (1862&#150;1919), a medical practitioner, and his wife, Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Barr (1867&#150;1946); both parents were Scottish. After receiving private tuition at home she was educated at Manchester High School for Girls. She became interested in occupational therapy following a chance encounter on a ship to the United States, and trained at the Philadelphia School of Occupational Therapy (1922&#150;3) where she gained her diploma. The school had been set up in 1919, initially to instruct practitioners in working with soldiers who had been physically and psychologically traumatized during the First World War. It was associated with two of the founders of occupational therapy in the United States, Eleanor Clarke Slagle and Thomas B. Kidner, who were involved with the National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy, established in 1917. Fulton also worked for six months at the Metropolitan Hospital in New York, developing her interest in psychiatry, before returning to Britain, where occupational therapy was virtually unknown.<br>
<br>After some months looking for work, Fulton was introduced to Dr Robert Dods Brown, superintendent of the Aberdeen Royal Asylum, who persuaded the hospital board of directors to appoint her at an annual salary of &pound;120 per year, living out. She was employed at the hospital from 1925 to 1963, being the first qualified occupational therapist to practise in the United Kingdom. By 1932, there were ten craft instructors employed in Scottish mental hospitals, who, together with Fulton, formed the Scottish Association of Occupational Therapists; Fulton was elected secretary and treasurer. The association was suspended during the Second World War, and when it was reconstituted in 1946 Fulton was elected to the chair, a position she held until 1949. She remained on the council, in various offices, almost continuously until 1971.<br>
<br>In 1952 Fulton was a member of the preparatory commission which drew up the constitution for the World Federation of Occupational Therapists; she was elected its first president and served for the first eight years of its existence. She was involved in the organization of the first international congress of the federation, which was held in Edinburgh in August 1954, after which she was appointed MBE for services to her profession. She was made an honorary fellow of the World Federation of Occupational Therapists in 1960.<br>
<br>Fulton was a strikingly handsome woman. She never married, but supported her mother until her death in 1946. As well as being an accomplished craftswoman, she was a gifted pianist. She published very little, though she was an effective, witty speaker and a prolific letter writer. She played a prominent role in the Soroptomists, an international association for professional women, through which she extended her worldwide circle of friends. After her retirement in 1963, she lived in Edinburgh, where she died after a short illness on 16 December 1989. Her body was cremated at Warriston crematorium, Edinburgh.<br>
