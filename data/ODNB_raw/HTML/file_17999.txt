<span class="headword">Manson,  David</span>  (1726&#150;1792), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, was born in the parish of Cairncastle, co. Antrim, the son of John Manson and Agnes Jamieson. As his parents were poor he worked as a farmer's servant-boy, but was allowed by his employer to attend a school kept by the Revd Robert White in the neighbouring town of Larne. There he made such good progress that he himself opened a school in his native parish&#151;according to tradition, in a cowhouse. He next became tutor to the Shaw family of Ballygally Castle, and then taught at a school in Ballycastle. It was probably at this time that he married Miss Lynn, of Ballycastle; they had no children.<br>
<br>In 1752 Manson moved to Belfast, where he started a brewery, and in 1755 he opened an evening school in his house in Clugston's Entry, where he taught English grammar, reading, and spelling. The school grew, so that in 1760 he moved to larger premises in High Street and employed three assistants. He advertised that his pupils would be taught &#145;without the Discipline of the Rod by intermixing pleasurable and healthful exercise with Instruction&#146;  (Benn, 452), and instead used a complex system of rewards to encourage them in their studies. In 1768 he built a still larger schoolhouse, in Donegall Street, where he was able to accommodate boarders for the first time. He taught both boys and girls; one of his pupils was Mary Anne McCracken. To amuse his pupils he devised various machines, one a primitive kind of velocipede. He wrote and published a number of school books, which enjoyed a long-lasting reputation in the north of Ireland and elsewhere. These were a spelling book, a primer, a pocket English dictionary, and a pronouncing dictionary. <span class="italic">Manson's Spelling Primer</span> continued to be published in the 1840s, and a new edition of his pronouncing dictionary was printed in Belfast in 1823. He set out his methods of teaching in &#145;A plan for the improvement of children in virtue and learning&#146;, printed in <span class="italic">A New Pocket Dictionary</span> (1762). He also published a small treatise in which he advised Irish handloom weavers to live in the countryside, where they could supplement their income by cultivating the soil. He invented an improved machine for spinning yarn.<br>
<br>In 1775 Manson was listed among the seatholders in the First Presbyterian Church, Belfast, and in 1779 he was admitted a freeman of the borough. He died on 2 March 1792 at Lillyput, a house which he had built near Belfast, and was buried at night, by torchlight, in the churchyard at the foot of High Street.<br>
