<span class="headword">Jones,  John</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1585, <em>d.</em> in or before 1658), <span class="occ">copyist and manuscript collector</span>, was born in Gellilyfdy in the parish of Ysgeifiog, Flintshire, the eldest of six sons and three daughters born to William Jones (1527/8&#150;1622) and his wife, Margaret, daughter of Thomas ap Hywel. His father and his grandfather, Si&ocirc;n ap William, were also copyists and patrons of poets. Nothing is known about his education except his year in Shrewsbury School (1595&#150;6). The copying of an arithmetical treatise onto legal documents dated 1598 suggests that he may have been apprenticed to an attorney in Shrewsbury; he may also be the &#145;John Jones, clerck&#146; mentioned in April 1600 in Llanfair Dyffryn Clwyd. Between 1603 and 1610 he was in Gellilyfdy and the gentry houses of the nearby Vale of Clwyd copying the bulk of twenty-five manuscripts belonging either to members of his family or to neighbouring gentry, clergymen, and scholars.<br>
<br>In 1611&#150;12 Jones compiled a list of the names of owners of manuscripts and books. In September 1612 he was in Glamorgan copying <span class="italic">Liber landavensis</span>, compiling another catalogue of the owners of manuscripts in that area, and locating Welsh manuscripts and books on both sides of the border. After that he was in Ludlow, reputedly practising as an attorney; there he would have been ideally placed for hearing about the location of manuscripts from Anglesey to Warwickshire, since it was the seat of the council in the marches and the focus of political and legal life in the principality. In 1617 he was imprisoned by the council and copying again. The pattern of copying between <i>c</i>.1613 and 1621 is revealing and establishes a pattern that remained to the end of his life&#151;he did little while at liberty, but copied extensively during his frequent periods of incarceration. Consequently there was much copying in 1618 but little in 1620 and 1621, when he was in London dealing with a case in the court of common pleas; back in Ludlow prison by August 1622, the copying began again. But during these years, 1622&#150;4, Jones was only rearranging and recopying manuscripts such as his massive dictionaries, unlike the period before 1610 when he borrowed new manuscripts from other scholars. The apparently obsessive rearranging may simply indicate that he had no new materials at hand.<br>
<br>His father died in August 1622, and after various bequests the residue of the estate went to Jones, which resulted in almost continuous litigation with his siblings and others between 1624 and 1632, in chancery, the Star Chamber, and other courts. He incurred a fine of &pound;200 in the Star Chamber and was committed to the Fleet prison between 1632 and 1639. Very few manuscripts were copied during 1624&#150;32, but during the Fleet years, 1632&#150;9, Jones worked on fifteen literary manuscripts and put the finishing touches to two others which he had compiled years previously. Some of these are his most accomplished work, but unfortunately many of the most ornamental manuscripts are disfigured by an excess of gall in the ink, which has destroyed the paper, especially where it has been laid on thickly in the ornate capitals. The facility to copy in this period raises the question of his precise status as a prisoner. He always referred to himself as a &#145;close prisoner&#146; in the Fleet, but those men were usually political prisoners, denied access to pen and paper except to write petitions concerning their cases; such a prohibition did not apply to Jones. However, there are extant drafts of petitions by him to members of the privy council and House of Commons outlining his own grievances and suggesting remedies for general defects of the body politic.<br>
<br>After 1641 the copying virtually stopped, although Jones may have remained in the Fleet until 1643 when he was released from an unnamed prison and returned to Gellilyfdy. During the civil war Jones was in Flint gaol for refusing to pay a levy of the commissioners of array, and he petitioned the king in June 1643 on behalf of the people of Flintshire about the oppression of the commissioners. He had manuscripts in boxes and bags with him in gaol which were stolen by the parliamentary army. He remained at liberty in Gellilyfdy from the end of 1647 until 1653. In 1648 he started an action in the court of chancery for the recovery of stolen books and manuscripts, and in October 1649 another action in the same court against a Thomas Edwards which dragged on until his death. Meanwhile he was petitioning parliament obsessively.<br>
<br>In 1651 Jones married Elizabeth, daughter of Peter Griffiths, of Caerwys, Flintshire. Typically, the details of the marriage are known from a chancery case of 1657. In January 1654 he was again in the Fleet, but was home by September. He has left a vivid account of the night of 9 November 1654 when Thomas Edwards, on the pretext of a chancery warrant, broke into Gellilyfdy with five armed soldiers and &#145;theeves&#146; and attacked Jones and his pregnant wife. He was first taken to Cheshire and afterwards to the Fleet, where he remained until he died intestate, before 6 April 1658. Elizabeth Jones was granted letters of administration in 1659, which revealed that she and her husband had had three girls, referred to as &#145;infants of 6 yeares or thereabouts&#146;. His grave is unknown and there is no memorial to him save the manuscripts he copied.<br>
<br>Over eighty manuscripts wholly or partly in Jones's hand survive in various repositories; it is impossible to be more precise since some manuscripts have been broken up and the parts separated. The topics cover all aspects of Welsh history and literature up to the seventeenth century, for example: poetry, from copies of the earliest poems to contemporary collections, often with anecdotes about the poets and/or the circumstances of composition; bardic grammars; vaticinatory poetry and prose works; historical texts, law texts, and religious works of all kinds, including several collections of saints' lives; prose romances and ancillary materials such as triads and folk tales; genealogies and materials for family history; astrological, mathematical, and pseudo-scientific and musical texts, word-lists and dictionaries of Welsh and several other European languages, plus anything and everything else that came his way and that he could copy. Jones was the most prolific and most skilled of all the Welsh copyists.<br>
