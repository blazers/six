<span class="headword">Bradstreet,  Simon</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1604, <em>d.</em> 1697), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, was baptized on 18 March 1604 at Horbling, Lincolnshire, the son of Simon Bradstreet (<i>d</i>. 1621), puritan clergyman, and his wife, Margaret. The Revd Bradstreet had been one of the overseers of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Simon remained at grammar school until the age of fourteen, at which time he was taken into the family of Theophilus Clinton, fourth earl of Lincoln. Eight or nine years later Dr John Preston persuaded Lord Lincoln to allow Simon to go to Emmanuel and serve as a tutor to Lord Rich. When Rich failed to arrive, according to Cotton Mather, Bradstreet returned briefly to the household of the earl of Lincoln, and then became steward to the dowager countess of Warwick.<br>
<br>Bradstreet joined the group planning a puritan colony in New England, and in March 1630 was named secretary of the Massachusetts Bay Company. He was chosen an assistant in the following month, shortly before he accompanied Governor John Winthrop to the New World on the <i>Arbella</i>. He served as an assistant (councillor and justice of the peace) in the Massachusetts Bay colony for the next forty-nine years. Though an assistant himself, he generally stood against exercises of discretionary magisterial authority. He served on important committees and helped to organize the United Colonies of New England, a confederation of the Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Haven, and Plymouth colonies. Bradstreet was one of the commissioners of the United Colonies, serving for thirty-three years. In 1662 he represented Massachusetts as an agent to Charles II. He received confirmation of the colony's charter, but the king demanded greater religious toleration and Bradstreet temporarily lost some of his popularity in Massachusetts when he returned as the bearer of these tidings. But in 1678 he was chosen deputy governor, and in the following year he was elected governor of the colony.<br>
<br>Bradstreet was a moderate who became increasingly unpopular with those who wished to resist royal attacks on the colony's charter. Despite this he was re-elected governor annually until the charter was revoked in 1684. When the colony was subsumed into the dominion of New England in 1686, he refused a seat on the dominion council on the grounds that the new government lacked a representative assembly. Following the revolt that overthrew the dominion in April 1689, he was made a member of the council of safety that ran the colony's affairs until a popular convention voted to resume the old charter government. Bradstreet again served as governor until the arrival in May 1692 of William Phipps, the first governor appointed under a new royal charter.<br>
<br>Bradstreet's first wife was Anne Dudley [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3209/', "Bradstreet, Anne (1612/&#150;1672)")</script>], daughter of Thomas Dudley, head steward of the earl of Lincoln's estates, whom he married in 1628. She achieved note as a distinguished poet. Much of her poetry described aspects of their family life, most famously the poem &#145;To my Dear and Loving Husband&#146;, which begins with the lines &#145;If ever two were one, then surely we&#146;. The couple had four sons and four daughters. After Anne's death on 16 September 1672 Bradstreet moved to Boston, and on 6 June 1676 he married Anne Gardner (<i>bap</i>. 1633, <i>d</i>. 1713), the daughter of Emanuel Downing and niece of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29779/', "John Winthrop")</script>. Following the establishment of the new charter government they moved to Salem, where Bradstreet died on 27 March 1697 and was buried.<br>
<br>A moderate in matters of both religion and politics, Bradstreet became a symbol of continuity with the founders in his last decades. The longest-surviving member of the colony's original leadership, he was referred to by Cotton Mather as &#145;the Nestor of New England&#146;.<br>
