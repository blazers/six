<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Abercrombie, Sir  (Leslie) Patrick</span>  (1879&#150;1957), <span class="occ">town planner</span>, was born on 6 June 1879 at Green Bank, Sale, Altrincham, one of a family of nine. His father, William Abercrombie (1838&#150;1908), born in Bradford, was a Manchester stockbroker and businessman, with literary and artistic interests; his mother, Sarah Ann Heron (1842&#150;1916), was from Dewsbury. Among his siblings was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30321/', "Lascelles Abercrombie (1881&#150;1938)")</script>, the poet. In 1887 Lynngarth, a new family home, was built in Brooklands Road, Ashton. It was designed by a Leicester architect, Joseph Goddard, and decorated with the advice of J. Aldam Heaton, who frequently worked with Richard Norman Shaw. The arts and crafts interiors left a strong impression on the young Patrick Abercrombie, and inculcated a love of architecture. With his two younger brothers, he was educated at Locker's Park preparatory school, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire (1891&#150;3), before attending Uppingham School, Leicestershire (1893&#150;6), and the Realschule, Lucerne, Switzerland (1896&#150;7).<h2>
<a name="Trainingandearlycareer"></a>Training and early career</h2>On 11 May 1897 Abercrombie was articled to a Manchester architect, Charles Henry Heathcote, for four years, at a premium of &pound;300; at the same time he also attended evening classes at Manchester School of Art. On completion of his articles he worked for three years in the Liverpool office of Sir Arnold Thornely. His Liverpool post prompted his move to Birkenhead, on the Wirral, which he described as &#145;a complete break, possibly the most complete in my life&#146;  (Abercrombie, pt I, chap. 2, 1). The area remained his home until 1936. In 1906 he worked for the Chester architect Philip Lockwood for a year, but was disappointed in his hopes of a partnership. However, the historic walled town&#151;then under transformation by the Grosvenors, the major landholders&#151;left a lasting impression upon him. In 1907 C. H. Reilly, head of the Liverpool University school of architecture, offered him an appointment as junior lecturer and studio instructor. This was a defining moment in Abercrombie's career, and began his long involvement with civic design and town planning.<br>
<br>When W. H. Lever (subsequently the first Lord Leverhulme) endowed the chair of civic design at Liverpool University in 1909, initially filled by Stanley Davenport Adshead, he also provided sufficient resources to fund a research fellowship and the publication of <span class="italic">Town Planning Review</span>, the first journal to be devoted to this subject in Great Britain. Abercrombie was appointed by Adshead to fill the fellowship and to edit the <span class="italic">Review</span>: his literary inclinations and growing knowledge of town planning, a subject which commanded increasing public attention, and which had become a local government function under the <span class="roman">Housing and Town Planning Act</span> of 1909, made him the obvious choice as editor. With Adshead, he was the chief contributor to the early volumes, providing many suggestions for the development of Merseyside, chronicling the contemporary growth of the garden city movement, and publishing articles on planning and civic design in continental cities. Abercrombie's fellowship took him abroad every year, and he visited Rome, Florence, Paris, Vienna, Brussels, and Berlin. His breadth of vision was influenced by, and matched, that of Patrick Geddes, in emphasizing the symbiotic cultural and social interdependence of the city&#150;region. This underlay his subsequent writing, teaching, and practice. Following Adshead's resignation in 1915, Abercrombie was appointed his successor as Lever professor of civic design, a post he held for twenty years.<br>
<br>Initially, Abercrombie's practice involved modest projects including housing schemes at Chester and Mouldsworth, built before 1914. Although his early architectural education was influenced by the arts and crafts movement, he developed a simplified Georgian style, which was reflected in his subsequent planning work, particularly at Dormanstown. This rational style represented the English equivalent of emergent modernism in architecture, and became widely influential through its use by Louis de Soissons at Welwyn Garden City from the early 1920s. In 1914, in association with Sydney and Arthur Kelly, Abercrombie entered the Dublin town planning competition, at the prompting of Patrick Geddes. Owing to the outbreak of the First World War, the assessors (who included Geddes) were unable to confer. Announcement of the award of the first prize to Abercrombie and the Kellys was deferred until 1916, and the plan was not published in full until 1922. Nevertheless, it established Abercrombie's international reputation. In 1914 he collaborated with Sydney Kelly and Manning Robertson on a sketch development plan for Dublin county borough. In 1920, in conjunction with Adshead and Stanley Ramsey, Abercrombie designed Dormanstown, an industrial village to house the employees of Dorman Long, the Middlesbrough steel-founders. The same year he was appointed, with Henry Johnson, to prepare a regional planning scheme for 169 square miles around Doncaster, centre of the expanding south Yorkshire coalfield. Approved in 1922, this was the first plan of its type to be published in Britain, and included proposals for ten satellite communities, separated from each other and Doncaster by a green belt, with a 120 foot reservation for the improved A1 road, the major highway from London to the north.<h2>
<a name="Theinterwaryears"></a>The inter-war years</h2>Abercrombie was a leading consultant throughout the inter-war period, and worked prolifically. In 1923 he and his brother Lascelles were asked to report on the preservation of Stratford upon Avon. He produced the Sheffield civic survey (1924), the east Kent regional planning scheme (1925, with John Archibald), the Bristol and Bath regional planning scheme (1930, with B. F. Brueton), the Cumbrian regional report (1932), the east Suffolk regional planning scheme (1935), and the Gloucestershire rural development scheme (all with Sydney Kelly). In many of his plans preservation of rural amenity and landscape was a common thread. In 1929, with the earl of Mayo and Adshead, he prepared a report on the Thames valley, from Cricklade to Staines, presenting a survey of the existing situation, and suggestions for preservation. Regrettably, the scope of many of his plans of the 1920s lay beyond the narrow confines of statutory town planning, which was largely concerned with the regulation of suburban development. Abercrombie was a leading advocate of the broader perspective, reflected to a degree in the 1932 <span class="roman">Town and Country Planning Act</span>. In 1933 his book <span class="italic">Town and Country Planning</span>, published in the <span class="roman">Home University Library</span>, brought the subject to a growing middle-class readership.<br>
<br>Abercrombie's love of the traditional English landscapes and historic country towns found a broader expression in the 1920s. In May 1926 his article &#145;The preservation of rural England&#146; in the <span class="italic">Town Planning Review</span> acted as catalyst for the foundation of the Council for the Preservation of Rural England; Abercrombie was also co-founder with Clough Williams-Ellis of the council's Welsh equivalent. As chairman of the executive committee of the council, Abercrombie undertook much advisory work on their behalf. In 1935 he succeeded Adshead as professor of town planning at University College, London, which post he held until 1946. From 1936 he was also consultant architect to the Department of Health for Scotland.<br>
<br>In 1937 Abercrombie was appointed a member of the royal commission on the distribution of the industrial population, chaired by Sir Montagu Barlow. This sought to analyse the causes of concentration of population in London and the industrial conurbations, and to recommend possible changes to redress regional imbalance. Abercrombie set out a critique of planning under the 1932 act in his &#145;Dissentient memorandum&#146;, which appeared in the <span class="italic">Report</span>, published in 1940, a few months after the outbreak of the Second World War. He called for national strategic policy guidance and the interlocking of plans at regional and local level. As a consultant, he had long been concerned by the lack of consistency between advisory regional plans and the statutory local authority plans, where individual councils were motivated by local self-interest, rather than a broader perspective. As Lord Holford wrote, &#145;if any one man had a truly synoptic view of the physical planning problems of the British Isles, that man was Abercrombie&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In May 1940 Abercrombie travelled to Ceylon, where, with A. Clifford Holliday, his former student, he planned a new site and buildings for the University of Ceylon at Peradinya. The blitz bombing of London and other cities in 1940 revealed the urgency of planning for reconstruction, promoted by Lord Reith, minister-designate of works. Upon his return to Britain, Abercrombie became involved with two major plans for London.<h2>
<a name="PlansforLondonandothercities"></a>Plans for London and other cities</h2>The London plans were probably Abercrombie's greatest achievement. The <span class="italic">County of London Plan</span>, published in 1943, covered inner London&#151;the area administrated by the London county council with the exception of the City. It was prepared in collaboration with J. H. Forshaw, architect to the council. Wesley Dougill, who had been senior lecturer at Liverpool, made a significant contribution to the preparation of the plan, but died a few months before its publication. Abercrombie also brought in Arthur Ling, who prepared a functional analysis of land uses and open spaces. The key problems addressed were traffic congestion, poor housing, inadequate and haphazardly distributed open space, and conflicting land uses. Redevelopment of slum neighbourhoods would entail mixed development, which also included some high-rise housing, set in open space: an English reworking of Le Corbusier's &#145;radiant city&#146; of the 1920s, which shaped the post-war housing response by the London county council and the London boroughs. Influenced by the contemporary &#145;precinct theory&#146; of the traffic expert and theorist Alker Tripp, Abercrombie proposed traffic-free areas for the university area in Bloomsbury, around St Paul's, and the Temple. In addition to the technical innovation of the proposals, the plan also strongly emphasized the need to preserve and underpin the traditional character of each locality, based on the peripheral market towns and villages which had been absorbed into the metropolis. Abercrombie's recurrent preoccupation with the human side of his profession&#151;his concept of a town as primarily the setting for human life, rather than a mere pattern of roads and land uses&#151;was updated from Geddes; however, it tended to be overlooked by those responsible for implementation in the post-war political arena. In his 1933 book <span class="italic">Town and Country Planning</span> Abercrombie commended the comprehensive analytical approach found in the privately funded <span class="italic">Regional Plan for New York and its Environs</span> (1929), for which Thomas Adams had been consultant. American analytical methods and techniques such as height-zoning were advocated in the plan.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Greater London Plan, 1944</span>, which covered the outer area of London and parts of the home counties, was commissioned by the standing conference on London regional planning, at the request of the minister for town and country planning. Its preparation overlapped with, and was complementary to, the county of London plan. With Abercrombie, Gordon Stephenson and Peter Shepheard also worked on the plan. Its context recognized the spreading influence of the capital city beyond its immediate local government unit. Abercrombie drew four rings, beginning with consolidation of the urban core of the county, through the suburban ring, the green belt, and an outer country ring. The green belt was intended to curb the further spread of suburbs; codified as the metropolitan green belt in 1955, it effectively halted London at its 1939 limits. Within the green belt, new development unrelated to agriculture was to be strictly controlled. The county of London plan had suggested the necessity for planned decentralization of more than a million people and associated industry, and this was to be accommodated in a ring of new towns beyond the green belt. The eight &#145;first generation&#146; new towns were commenced, following legislation in 1946, by state-created development corporations: although only two were built on the sites proposed by Abercrombie, they have been recognized as a major planning achievement. The road plan, of major motorway radials and rings, was implemented only in modified form, and not completed until the mid-1980s, with the M25. Abercrombie saw London continuing as a world port and manufacturing centre, and failed to anticipate the startling expansion of the service sector and office employment. Nevertheless, his strategy guided the planning of London and the home counties for a half-century after its publication in 1945, despite the lack of a regional executive to co-ordinate the constituent local authorities.<br>
<br>Another important plan by Abercrombie, for Plymouth, was commissioned in the autumn of 1941 by Viscount Astor, lord mayor of the city, which had been intensively bombed, virtually obliterating the city centre. In the plan for Plymouth (1943) comprehensive replanning created a traffic-free shopping centre, based on Tripp's precincts, with a grand central axis&#151;Armada Way&#151;sweeping from the railway station, across Royal Parade, where the guildhall and rebuilt civic centre were located, and onwards to the hoe. Unfortunately the architecture failed to match the boldness of the concept, with Abercrombie opting for the safety of the stripped Georgian style, which was carried through with little imagination or flair. In the broader context of the plan, as usual, Abercrombie declined to be constrained by administrative boundaries, but the adjoining authorities failed to participate actively in the plan, and the proposed regional dimension was lost. He subsequently collaborated with Edwin Lutyens on the plan for Kingston upon Hull, published in 1945, but little of it was implemented.<br>
<br>Before the war's end Abercrombie began work on a major regional plan for the Clyde valley, with Robert Matthew. This was published in 1946, and was followed by a west midlands plan in 1948, and a plan for Edinburgh in 1949. The 1947 <span class="roman">Town and Country Planning Act</span> placed emphasis on statutory development planning by local authorities, but Abercrombie took no direct role in statutory planning (nor in the implementation of his Greater London proposals through the 1946 <span class="roman">New Towns Act</span>). The post-war period witnessed the expansion of his consultancy work, with no diminution of his energy or enthusiasm in his sixties and seventies. He travelled widely, to Addis Ababa, Hong Kong, and Cyprus. As late as 1956 he returned to Addis Ababa, to spend six weeks putting the finishing touches to his plan for that city.<h2>
<a name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>Abercrombie was knighted in 1945, and was also an officer of the order of the crown of Belgium, and of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur of France. Among professional honours he received were the Ebenezer Howard memorial medal (1943), the royal gold medal for architecture (1946), the gold medal of the American Institute of Architects (1949), and the gold medal of the Town Planning Institute (1955). He had been president of the Town Planning Institute in 1925, and vice-president of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1937&#150;9. He was a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission and of the royal commission on the location of industry. After retirement from London University in 1946, Abercrombie gave much time to the Union Internationale des Architectes, established following conferences in London and Brussels in 1947 and 1948. He served as the union's president from 1951 to 1956, and gained the support of the USSR, the United States, and South American republics, in addition to western European countries. He received honorary degrees from the universities of London, Liverpool, and Melbourne.<br>
<br>Abercrombie's written style was elegant, and he was a meticulous draughtsman. His interests were wide-ranging, and he had a close-clipped manner of speech and a ready wit. Patrician in appearance, with sharp features, and wearing a monocle (having lost the sight of his left eye in his youth), he enjoyed the finer things of life. In 1944, after an air raid had seriously damaged the offices in which the Greater London plan was under preparation, Abercrombie braved the wrath of the wardens to retrieve a case of vintage claret from the cellar, which he opened there and then to boost the morale of his staff before getting down to the task of sorting through the debris. A great believer in co-operation, he invariably acknowledged the contribution of partners and collaborators. He was a sympathetic mentor to several generations of students, some of whom collaborated with him later in their careers.<br>
<br>On 5 August 1908 Abercrombie married (Emily) Maud (1886&#150;1942), daughter of Robert Gordon, a corn merchant; the couple had a son and a daughter. The death of his wife in 1942 was a grievous loss for Abercrombie. He himself died at his Berkshire home, the Red House at Aston, on 23 March 1957. He had retained a summer home, Penrhos Bach, Holy Island, Anglesey, and he was buried on 27 March at Rhoscolyn, Anglesey. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 24 April 1957, when the address was given by Clough Williams-Ellis. He stated, &#145;I feel that one of Patrick's great services was that he gave wings to planning, never letting its ultimate end&#151;more happiness for more people&#151;be obscured by its solemn technical processes&#146;  (C. Williams-Ellis, &#145;Address &hellip; at the memorial service for Sir Patrick Abercrombie&#146;, RIBA BAL, biography file, 1). Abercrombie's embracing vision was predicated upon acceptance of the planner as an expert, a characteristic rejected by the community participation movement of the 1960s, and scarcely possible under the statutory process of the late twentieth century.<br>
