<span class="headword">Turner,  Richard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1798&#150;1881), <span class="occ">iron manufacturer and engineer</span>, was the third son of Timothy Turner (<i>d</i>. 1822) and his wife, Catherine Sisson. The Turners had long been associated with the ironmongery trade in Dublin. His great-grandfather was &#145;iron smith&#146; to the Irish House of Commons and Trinity College in the mid-eighteenth century. Turner inherited from his uncle the family ironmongery business which was located at 4 St Stephen's Green.<br>
<br>About 1816 he married Jane, daughter of Thomas Goodshaw of Collams Well, Leixlip. They had four sons and four daughters, as well as three children who died in infancy. Two of his sons, Thomas and William, were later to work with him.<br>
<br>In 1833 Turner erected large premises called the Hammersmith Iron Works, south of Dublin in Ballsbridge. During this time he expanded the ironmongery business to include the manufacture of wrought-iron conservatories like those advocated by John Claudius Loudon, who invented the first wrought-iron glazing bar in 1816 (manufactured and later patented in 1818 by W. and D. Bailey of Holborn in London). Turner's earliest glasshouses closely followed the curvilinear designs illustrated in Loudon's <span class="italic">An Encyclopedia of Gardening</span> (1822). One of Turner's earliest known wrought-iron conservatories was the range erected in 1836&#150;7 at the vice-regal lodge in Phoenix Park, Dublin. Over the following four decades, his firm specialized in the manufacture of these buildings and erected many examples throughout Britain, including those at Marlfield, co. Tipperary; the wings of the palm house at Belfast Botanic Gardens (1839&#150;40); the range at Killakee, co. Dublin; the curvilinear range in the Botanic Gardens (now the National Botanic Gardens), Dublin (1843&#150;8 and 1868&#150;9); the winter garden in the Inner Circle, Regent's Park, London (1845&#150;6, 1870&#150;71, and 1875&#150;6, demolished 1932); the range at Haddo House, Aberdeenshire (1844&#150;5); the Victoria Regia House, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (1852), and Woodstock, co. Kilkenny.<br>
<br>The palm house at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, 1844&#150;8, was Turner's greatest achievement. Designed in collaboration with Decimus Burton, it was based on Loudon's ideas for the best form and construction of a glasshouse. Its scale surpassed all other iron and glass structures at that time and it is famous as the finest example of a curvilinear wrought-iron and glass conservatory. Turner's significant contribution was the use of wrought iron, and in particular the adoption of a single rolled wrought-iron &#145;I&#146; section of &#145;deck beam&#146; as the primary structural member; the palm house was the first building to be erected in England with this type of section. The deck beam had been developed for use in shipbuilding and was patented in 1844 by James Kennedy and Thomas Vernon of Liverpool. In 1846 Turner patented its use in buildings and later incorporated different depths of deck beam in other buildings.<br>
<br>The largest structure designed and erected by Turner was the station roof at Liverpool's Lime Street Station, 1849&#150;50. It was the largest iron roof-span erected at that time, with arches composed of wrought-iron deck-beam spanning 153 feet 6 inches. Turner also utilized deck-beam sections in the roofs of Broadstone Station, Dublin (1847), York Road Station, Belfast (1848), and Galway Station (1851). With his architect son, Thomas, he entered the competition for the building for the Great Exhibition of 1851, receiving an honourable mention along with Hector Horeau.<br>
<br>In the 1830s Turner had been in partnership with William Walker, and in the early 1860s the firm was known as Turner and Gibson. Turner's third son, William, worked with him from the 1840s and in 1863 assumed control of the Hammersmith Iron Works. Turner remained involved in the business until 1880, in particular over the additions to the winter garden at Regent's Park and those to the curvilinear range at the Botanic Gardens, Dublin. In 1872 Hammersmith Iron Works was closed and William Turner continued the business from the Oxmantown foundry on the north side of Dublin, until 1888 when it closed. Turner died in Dublin on 31 October 1881.<br>
