<span class="headword">Armstrong,  John</span>  (1674&#150;1742), <span class="occ">military engineer</span>, was born on 31 March 1674 the eldest son of Robert Armstrong (<i>c</i>.1651&#150;1716) of Ballyan, King's county (co. Offaly), Ireland and Lydia (<i>c</i>.1649&#150;1715), daughter of Michael Howard of Ballyard, King's county. Armstrong entered young into a military life, serving as a volunteer in the Williamite army in Ireland in 1691 when he was taken prisoner and sent to Limerick. In 1695 he went to Flanders and entered himself in his kinsman Philip Armstrong's troop in Wood's regiment of horse. After the regiment returned to England in 1697 Armstrong came to the attention of the duke of Ormond who chose him to join the second troop of Horse Guards under his command. Ormond employed Major Wybault, a French engineer, to instruct his young officers in mathematics and engineering and under his tutelage Armstrong applied himself assiduously. In 1702 he served as a volunteer on the Vigo expedition with Ormond when the Spanish treasure fleet was destroyed. In 1703 he returned to the army in Flanders with a recommendation from Ormond to Brigadier Holcroft Blood who was colonel of artillery and chief engineer. Armstrong again applied himself and so impressed Blood with his diligence that Blood presented him to the duke of Marlborough. Ever short of capable engineers Marlborough was quick to appreciate young Armstrong's talents and he and Thomas Lascelles were given the pay of an engineer (&pound;100 p.a.) to share between them, Armstrong being appointed sub-engineer on 17 March 1704. In that year he served as an engineer at Hochstadt and behaved so well that Marlborough appointed him a lieutenant of grenadiers in How's regiment of foot. In 1707 he was advanced to be an engineer on the new establishment and in 1709 was appointed lieutenant quartermaster-general of the army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. At the siege of Bouchain in August 1711 Armstrong threw up overnight a substantial battery with which the enemy works were bombarded at daylight. This feat won him Marlborough's undying gratitude: the duke later commissioned a portrait of himself with Armstrong (now in Blenheim Palace), the latter holding a plan of Bouchain. At one time thought to be by Kneller, it is now attributed to Enoch Seeman.<br>
<br>Armstrong was promoted in 1712 to quartermaster-general of the army with the rank of colonel and after the conclusion of the treaty of Utrecht he was appointed one of the commissioners for overseeing the demolition of the harbour and fortifications of Dunkirk. With Colonel Lascelles, who had also been appointed, Armstrong spent most of 1713 and 1714 at Dunkirk wrestling with the reluctant French. However, on 20 September 1714 he married Anna Priscilla Burroughs (1688/9&#150;1725), daughter of Major Burroughs and sister of Colonel William Burroughs. They had five daughters; Anna Armstrong died giving birth to the fifth daughter on 27 March 1725.<br>
<br>After the accession of George I, Armstrong was confirmed in all his appointments and was additionally appointed, on 2 December 1714, chief engineer of England with provision for him to sit and act at the Board of Ordnance. Armstrong's assumption of a senior post with the board coincided with significant changes in the relationship between the engineers and the artillery and in the way in which the engineers were organized. Brigadier Michael Richards, who had been appointed surveyor-general of the ordnance at the same time that Armstrong had stepped into his shoes as chief engineer, was the prime mover in the reforms, but there is no doubt he was ably seconded by Armstrong. From May 1716 the engineers and the artillery became separate corps within the ordnance service, thus ending the subordinate status the artillery had chafed under until that time. The engineers, for whom Armstrong now had direct responsibility, felt a wind of change that included more rigorous requirements for entry to its ranks, a more structured progression for those already employed, and opportunities for the younger officers to move stations more frequently and improve their knowledge of military engineering.<br>
<br>Armstrong was present at the royal foundry, near Moorfields, on 10 May 1716 when, owing to dampness in the moulds, an explosion occurred that killed seventeen people. Stories to the effect that he received early warning of the impending disaster via Andrew Schalch and then absented himself before the firing appear to be without substance.<br>
<br>Demolition of the defensive works and sluices at Dunkirk was one of the provisions of the triple alliance signed in January 1717, the work having not been carried out to Britain's satisfaction in the period 1713&#150;16. Armstrong, Jacob Acworth, and Thomas Lascelles were appointed commissaries to inspect and monitor progress in June 1717 at which time Armstrong was petitioning the king for the sum of &pound;730 unpaid for earlier duties at Dunkirk. He claims the French attempted to bribe him during his residence there &#145;with a promise of a great sum of money&#146; should he remain silent about &#145;the new Channell&#146; and so on  (memorial of Colonel John Armstrong to the king, 13 June 1717, TNA: PRO, SP 76/2).<br>
<br>At this time Armstrong still held the posts of quartermaster-general and chief engineer and in July 1717 was made colonel of the regiment of foot previously commanded by Brigadier-General Stanwix. James Craggs, writing to inform him of his new command, congratulated him &#145;upon the justice is done you now, in which I can assure you, you are entirely obliged to the King himself&#146;  (Craggs to Armstrong, 20 July 1717, TNA: PRO, SP 76/2). The regiment was disbanded the following year and Armstrong was to remain without regimental command for many years thereafter. In 1719 he went as quartermaster-general on the Vigo expedition under Lord Cobham.<br>
<br>In 1722 Armstrong was made surveyor-general of the ordnance in succession to Brigadier Michael Richards, deceased. In this capacity he was deputy to the lieutenant-general of the ordnance. He was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society on 23 May 1723. In 1725 Armstrong's report on the state of the fens and the port of Lynn and his proposals for draining the fens and amending the harbour appeared as an appendix to <span class="italic">The history of the ancient and present state of the navigation of the port of King's Lyn, and of Cambridge</span>, by Thomas Badeslade. His engineering skills were called upon by the duchess of Marlborough, who needed a water feature to add interest to the parkland before Blenheim. His design of a canal and circular basin was constructed in the mid-1720s only to be covered later by a Capability Brown lake.<br>
<br>In April 1727 the duke of Newcastle sent Armstrong to Paris to participate as adviser on military matters in the negotiations then proceeding with the French and the Dutch. He accompanied Britain's envoy, Horace Walpole, in discussions with Cardinal Fleury and is referred to by Newcastle as the &#145;author&#146; of a plan to station an army of observation, composed of French troops, at Nijmegen to protect Holland and encourage the Rhine principalities to maintain their neutrality. Armstrong remained at Paris until shortly before the preliminaries were signed on 31 May 1727. His part in the negotiations, highly thought of by his associates and by the king, was characterized as &#145;procuring the Emperor's signing articles for peace, by negotiating a plan for war&#146;  (Charles Delafaye to Stephen Poyntz, 6 Feb 1730, BL, Althorp papers, E5).<br>
<br>The squabbling over Dunkirk rumbled on with Armstrong, for long the acknowledged expert on the subject, frequently consulted. George I had instructed Newcastle to send all papers concerning Dunkirk to Armstrong as a matter of course. In July 1728 Armstrong was for a third time appointed to inspect Dunkirk, which, it was feared, the French had been secretly repairing. He experienced a serious bout of illness while there in October and when his health was sufficiently recovered he made his way home.<br>
<br>In February 1730 Armstrong was again in Paris as adviser on military matters in negotiations with the French, Dutch, and Spanish and was specifically asked to work on the &#145;mutual military defence plan&#146;. Within a fortnight he had been recalled to London to give evidence before the House of Commons in support of the ministry over allegations by the opposition concerning French reconstruction at Dunkirk. His presence at Paris could only with difficulty be dispensed with for his standing with the representatives of the allies, particularly the Spaniards, was high, and Newcastle directed Armstrong to assure them that &#145;nothing but an absolute necessity would have induced His Majesty to have sent for you at this time &hellip;&#146;  (Newcastle to Armstrong, 12 Feb 1730, BL, Add. MS 32765, fol. 366). Armstrong's presence at Paris was pressed for and he returned there after a short period and remained until April 1731.<br>
<br>In May 1735 Armstrong was given the colonelcy of the Royal regiment of Ireland (18th foot) and in December was advanced to brigadier-general. He was made major-general in July 1739.<br>
<br>On 10 March 1741 the principal officers of the Board of Ordnance, including Major-General Armstrong, wrote to the master-general, the second duke of Montagu, recommending the setting up of an academy or school at Woolwich. This led to the establishment of the Royal Military Academy in 1741, an event that Armstrong barely lived to see. He died at the Tower of a paralytic complaint on 15 April 1742 and was buried in the chapel there.<br>
<br>Major-General Armstrong was over 6 feet in height and well proportioned. &#145;He had a large steady eye well set in and a countenance that rather excited respect than encouraged familiarity&#146;  (Armstrong). He was diligent in his application to the business of his profession and was said never to have bought an employment nor sold one. Armstrong was highly thought of by the duke of Ormond and the duke of Marlborough and was well known to George I and George II. He had a less happy relationship with the duke of Argyll, under whom he served many years while Argyll was master-general of the ordnance. As a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Marlborough Armstrong was anathema to Argyll. The animus between the two men extended, in the case of Argyll, beyond Armstrong himself to those in the ordnance service who were dependent on him. As for Armstrong his deep-seated mistrust of the duke prompted him, on the succession of George II in 1727, to obtain letters patent for his reappointment to the office of chief engineer of England privately from the king shortly before Argyll's appointment as master-general. This procedure must have enraged Argyll whose prerogative it was to appoint officers of the ordnance. The duke of Montagu opined that Armstrong's motivation was &#145;a greater security to himself lest the Master General should not have thought proper to have reappointed him by his Warrant, and also to be the more independent of the Master General&#146;  (Montagu to Newcastle, 8 June 1742, TNA: PRO, SP41/36).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54190"></a><span class="headword">John Armstrong</span>  (1706&#150;1758), <span class="occ">military engineer and author</span>, was born on 2 February 1706 in Ballycumber, King's county, the fourth son of Andrew Armstrong (1669&#150;1717) of Ballycumber, and his wife, Lucy (<i>d</i>. 1733), widow of William Mason and elder daughter of George Charnock. He was cousin to Major-General Armstrong to whom he was indebted for his entr&eacute;e to, and subsequent progress in the service of, the Board of Ordnance, as well as for his commission in the Royal regiment of Ireland (18th foot). Armstrong reached the rank of engineer-in-ordinary and saw service in England and New York. Falling foul of the duke of Argyll while serving at Portsmouth in 1738 Armstrong was removed from his post and left without any ordnance appointment, a situation that obtained until after Argyll was replaced as master-general in 1740. During the period 1738&#150;42 Armstrong saw service with his regiment at Minorca, where he recorded his observations on the island's history, customs, religion, and people. These notes he later arranged for publication, the first London edition of <span class="italic">The History of the Island of Minorca</span> appearing in 1752. A second edition appeared in 1756 and was followed by a Dublin edition. Armstrong's book was the first history of Minorca in any language and translations into French (1769) and Spanish (1781) followed. Various works in German drew on his studies, the earliest in 1754 and others in 1771 and 1781. Armstrong died in impecunious circumstances at the Swan tavern, Chelsea, on 27 March 1758 and was buried on 31 March 1758 at Chelsea Old Church. He never married.<br>
