<span class="headword">O'Brien,  John</span>  (1701&#150;1769), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop of Cloyne and Ross and lexicographer</span>, was born in Ballyvoddy, near Glanworth, co. Cork, the son of Thomas O'Brien, a farmer, and his wife, Eleanor McEniry. His parents, both of good descent, were well connected both at home and on the continent. By 1720 he had already left for France to study for the priesthood, principally at the Irish College in Toulouse, where he was permitted to hear confessions in April 1727, evidence of his recent ordination. At the University of Toulouse he graduated bachelor of divinity in 1733, being already a doctor of both civil and canon law. From 1733 to 1737 he travelled widely in France and Spain as tutor to the sons of several aristocratic Irish expatriates, namely Simon Connock, governor in the Spanish service; Thomas Fitzgerald, the Spanish ambassador in London; and Arthur Dillon, lieutenant-general in the Irish brigade.<br>
<br>On O'Brien's return to Ireland in 1738, his first employment was as parish priest of Castlelyons and Rathcormack, co. Cork. These parishes belonged to Cloyne, a diocese then subject to the bishop of Cork. Very soon he was also named archdeacon and vicar-general. He was to reside at Castlelyons, close to the still thriving centre of Gaelic literature Carraig na bFear, for most of his life.<br>
<br>By papal brief dated 10 January 1748, O'Brien became bishop of Cloyne and Ross, two areas physically separated by the diocese of Cork. To repair church structure and discipline undermined by penal laws over the preceding fifty years, he published in 1756 an elaborate set of diocesan statutes entitled <span class="italic">Monita pastoralia et statuta ecclesiastica</span>. Their aim was to foster a well-trained and zealous body of priests whose first duty would be to preach and catechize. The statutes also sought to improve the behaviour of the laity with regard both to their religious duties and to some aspects of their social behaviour: superstitions, faction-fighting even at funerals, and meetings by night at holy wells. Clandestine marriages were severely condemned. A second and shorter work, <span class="italic">Vindiciae quarundum consuetudinum</span>, published with the <span class="italic">Monita</span>, was sent to Rome as a spirited defence of Irish bishops, accused of non-residence and neglect of their duties, against their hidden slanderers.<br>
<br>O'Brien's work of diocesan renewal was hampered for twenty years by the unhelpful interference of James Butler, the coadjutor-bishop of Cashel from 1750 and archbishop from 1757; sometimes he was delated to the civil authorities by unworthy priests whom he had tried to discipline. He also had to grapple with problems arising from the activities of the Whiteboys, a secret and supposedly Catholic network of agrarian terrorists. To counteract the Whiteboys he issued a stern pastoral letter to his clergy in 1762. To improve clerical education he established bursaries in 1764 at the Irish colleges of Paris and Louvain. Despite his reputation as a disciplinarian, he retained the loyalty of his priests. During the years 1765 and 1766 he personally conducted a general mission for his two dioceses, spending four months in the field each autumn with a band of confessors. Ireland had seldom seen missions of this kind before, nor would it often see them again.<br>
<br>O'Brien wrote a treatise on the history of Munster, thought to have been that published by Charles Vallancey under his own name in the fourth volume of his <span class="italic">Collectanea</span> in 1774. With the help of a scholar named &Oacute; Conaire he also compiled the manuscript generally known as the &#145;Dublin annals of Inisfallen&#146;. His great work, however, was as general editor of an Irish dictionary, <span class="italic">Focal&oacute;ir Gaoidhilge&#150;Sax-Bh&eacute;arla, or, An Irish&#150;English Dictionary</span>, compiled by other scholars under his supervision before 1762, and eventually printed at Paris in 1768. This too was intended to help the church, for O'Brien believed that the preservation of the faith in Ireland depended essentially on the preservation of the native language. Inspired by the works of Edward Lluyd and Conor O'Begly, he drew on earlier compilations but omitted several thousand words then in use. His dictionary contains valuable historical and genealogical information and useful definitions, but is marred by fanciful etymologies and a lack of grammatical detail.<br>
<br>Partly because of ill health and partly to escape the powerful Nagle family, protectors of a dissolute priest accused of using the confessional to seduce female tenants of the Nagles, O'Brien left Ireland for ever in the summer of 1767. Having first made his way to Paris to oversee the printing of his dictionary in 1768, he died on 13 March 1769 at Lyons, where he was buried in the church of St Martin d'Ainay.<br>
