<span class="headword">Peche,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1182), <span class="occ">bishop of Coventry</span>, was almost certainly the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95151/', "Bishop Robert Peche")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95150/', "Limesey, Robert de")</script>], who occupied that see from 1121 to 1126. He was made archdeacon of Coventry, presumably the most lucrative of the archdeaconries of the see at that time, probably by his father, but there are no certain references to him as archdeacon before about 1140. There were obviously objections to his elevation in 1161, as the son of a priest, to the episcopate; indeed, in a famous passage concerning him, written near the end of the twelfth century, the chronicler Ralph de Diceto was moved to quote at length from Ivo of Chartres to justify the appointment of the son of a priest as a bishop. The fourteenth-century chronicle of Lichfield Cathedral, once attributed to Thomas Chesterfield, records a tradition that Bishop Richard's election met with universal acclaim. In reality this probably meant that neither the monks of Coventry nor the canons of Lichfield were actually opposed to his appointment (there had been disputes during and following the election of his predecessor, Bishop Walter Durdene). Whether Richard was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the king, or merely a local man too strong to be ignored, is uncertain, but the chronicler also claims that he was elected <i>voluntate regis Henrici mediante</i> (&#145;by the intervention of King Henry's will&#146;)  (Wharton, 1.435). The sources disagree as to whether he was consecrated, on 18 April 1161, by Archbishop Theobald, or by Walter, bishop of Rochester (<i>d</i>. 1182); it is clear, however, that the former was so near to death at that time that he might well have been too ill to perform the ceremony of consecration. Bishop Richard's place in the Becket dispute is by no means clear: David Knowles, vexed by Richard's apparent escapism in what he perceived as the church's time of peril, wrote icily of him as a man of no consequence. It seems, however, that he was a most active diocesan, and, although this may have been initially a papal initiative, he was concerned particularly to restore the finances of the church of Lichfield. The Lichfield Cathedral cartulary contains ten relevant charters of Bishop Richard's, some in favour of the common fund, some the precentorship, and some the deanery. Richard seems to have been a man of fairly conventional piety and was remembered, erroneously as it happens, as the founder of the Augustinian house in Stafford dedicated to the memory of St Thomas, to which he retired, having become a canon, shortly before his death on 6 or 7 October 1182.<br>
