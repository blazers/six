<span class="headword">Baker, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1489&#150;1558), <span class="occ">administrator and speaker of the House of Commons</span>, was born <i>c</i>.1489, being about sixty-two in 1551, the eldest of four sons of Richard Baker (<i>d</i>. 1504), landowner, of Cranbrook, Kent, and his wife, Joan (<i>d</i>. in or after 1504). He was bequeathed property in 1496 by his grandfather Thomas Baker of Cranbrook. However, in 1504 his father revoked this legacy and substituted it for an annuity of &pound;10 until the age of twenty-four, in order to have his son educated in the law.<br>
<br>Baker was in chambers at the Inner Temple by June 1506, and became a bencher in 1517. He somehow managed to contribute to the cost of some chambers under the library in which he was given a perpetual interest in 1506. A series of offices at the inn followed, including frequent service as governor, and he gave his first reading in 1522 and his second in 1530. In the meantime he was subsidy commissioner in Kent in 1514, and JP for the county from 1515 to 1558. By 1547, although the longest-serving JP, he was less active, despite appointment as <i>custos rotulorum</i>, because of his commitments in central government. The rising lawyer served as counsel in the court of requests in 1519, and in the following year secured appointment as under-sheriff of London. This led, in 1526, to the post of recorder of London, the principal legal office in the city. In the same year Baker began a career-long relationship with the duchy of Lancaster, being retained of counsel. His first wife was probably called Katherine (<i>d</i>. before 1530), and was the daughter of Richard Sackville of Withyham, Sussex. They had no children. By 1530 he had married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1558), daughter and heir of Thomas Dingeley of Stanford Dingley, Berkshire, and Middle Aston, Oxfordshire, and widow of his close friend George Barrett of Aveley, Essex. The couple had two sons, Sir Richard Baker (<i>b</i>. in or before 1530, <i>d</i>. 1594), and John Baker (<i>b</i>. in or before 1531, <i>d</i>. 1604&times;6), father of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1131/', "Sir Richard Baker (c.1568&#150;1645)")</script>, the religious writer and historian, and three daughters. In 1535 Baker surrendered the recordership upon appointment as attorney-general of the duchy of Lancaster on 13 May. However, he only held office for a year, being named attorney-general in 1536, which he remained until 1540. There followed a succession of high offices of state: chancellor of the court of first fruits and tenths (1540&#150;54); chancellor of the exchequer (1540&#150;58); and under-treasurer of England (1543&#150;58). Baker was the first to hold simultaneously the offices of chancellor and under-treasurer, thus beginning a process leading to the eventual rise of the chancellorship. He was a privy councillor from 1540 to 1558. Baker was knighted by 18 June 1540. His parliamentary career was long, active, and distinguished, beginning with representation of London in the Reformation Parliament of 1529, and concluding with service as knight for the shire of Kent in four parliaments (April and November 1554, 1555, 1558). Baker was MP for an unknown constituency in 1536, for Guildford, Surrey, in 1542, Lancaster in 1545, Huntingdonshire in 1547, and Bramber, Sussex, in October 1553. He was one of the most eminent speakers of the House of Commons, filling the post in 1545 and 1547.<br>
<br>Baker's success can be attributed to a shrewd legal mind, a capacity for hard work, and the ability to form enduring friendships among the prominent and influential men of his day. His legal expertise was much sought after, and he sat on innumerable committees and commissions, keeping in close touch with Kent, the civic authorities in London, and the royal administration. He was on the quorum of the peace in Kent and Middlesex from 1547. Baker's offices were staffed with a growing retinue of dependants, many from the vicinity of Cranbrook, and several were highly capable. His friendships, of which there were many, were drawn exclusively from the religious conservatives of the period, both ecclesiastical and lay. Baker's closest friends and associates were Sir John Gage, of West Firle, Sussex, William Fitzwilliam, earl of Southampton, and Sir William Petre, of Ingatestone, Essex. He was also close to the Sackville family of Sussex. From the affair surrounding Elizabeth Barton (the Holy Maid of Kent), to the Marian martyrdoms he was active in religious affairs. While he demonstrated a remarkable ability to work with those of opposing viewpoints, Baker was, nevertheless, a purposeful politician: he was one of the leading voices on the privy council for religious conservatism in the final years of Henry VIII's reign, and he was one of the first to oppose Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, lord protector to Edward VI.<br>
<br>Baker's continued service under Henry, Edward, and Mary I is remarkable, especially given that he signed the engagement for the alteration of the succession to Lady Jane Grey, despite his reluctance, and provided legal advice on the subject on 11 June and signed the letters patent for the limitation of the crown on 21 June 1553. He demurred over the whole proceedings. Under Mary, however, he earned an unsavoury reputation for undue zeal in the suppression of heresy, in his capacity as a commissioner for the diocese of Canterbury, and received from John Foxe the unpleasant sobriquet &#145;Butcher Baker&#146;. In that connection Sir Robert Brooke reported him as having given the opinion in 1555 that a writ <i>de haeretico comburendo</i> was not necessary for the sheriff to burn a heretic if present at the conviction. Like Sir Thomas More, who in the previous generation was equally fond of burning heretics, his ferocity towards those of different beliefs may be contrasted with a generally cultivated character. The Catholic writer Robert Wingfield of Brantham, Suffolk, at any rate, described him as gravely serious and deeply learned in the law. He seems to have been a bibliophile and left to the Inner Temple a unique manuscript year-book, described by John Selden, which contained civilian glosses. It has not been noticed since the seventeenth century; but another manuscript year-book of his is now in the British Library (Harley MS 452). Mary held him in particularly high regard for his services to Katherine of Aragon and, when he retired as chancellor of the court of first fruits and tenths in 1554, he was granted a generous annuity of &pound;233.<br>
<br>Baker's other talent lay in family aggrandizement. He inherited but a single tenement; at his death he possessed one of the largest estates in the Weald of Kent. He began investing in property well before the dissolution of the monasteries. Planning for the long term, he purchased reversionary interests for relatively modest amounts, and skilfully built up an estate around his residence at Sissinghurst, Kent. By 1547 his annual income from land and fees was &pound;420, making him one of the richer gentlemen in Kent. With talent, resources, and connections, he was ideally suited to benefit from the dissolutions of the monasteries and chantries, and the state confiscations that marked the political turmoil of the mid-sixteenth century. In the parliament of 1539 Baker had his estates disgavelled, the principal beneficiary being his heir. He made his will on 16 October 1555. He died on 23 December 1558 in London and was buried the following month under a monument in Cranbrook church beside his second wife.<br>
