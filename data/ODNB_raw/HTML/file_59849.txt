<span class="headword">Blunden,  Humphrey</span>  (<em>b. </em>1609, <em>d.</em> in or after 1654), <span class="occ">publisher and bookseller</span>, was born on 12 November 1609, the son of Richard Blunden (<i>d</i>. 1621?), gentleman, of Chelton, Shropshire. He was bound apprentice on 4 September 1626 to Philemon Stephens, bookseller, and made free of the London Stationers' Company on 22 June 1635. Richard Baxter fondly recalled his acquaintance with Blunden, remarking that he was &#145;a sober godly, understanding Apprentice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.11). In April 1636 Blunden took out a loan from his company, doubtless using the money to help finance a publishing venture. In the following year he paid for the copyright of his first two publications, James Day's <span class="italic">A New Spring for Divine Poetry</span> (1637) and a Latin narrative of the Leipzig colloquy of 1631 by the Saxon court preacher, Matthias Ho&euml; von Ho&euml;negg, entitled <span class="italic">Colloquii inter praecipuos aliquot Germaniae theologos, de conciliandis ecclesiarum evangelicarum dissidiis. Anno MDCXXXI</span> (1637). Blunden's shop was at The Castle in Cornhill near the Royal Exchange and all his known future imprints bore a variation of this address.<br>
<br>By October 1638 Blunden had been admitted to the yeomanry of the Stationers and in the coming years he became actively involved in company politics. In January 1642 Blunden published one issue of <span class="italic">A Continuation of the True Diurnall of Passages in Parliament</span> (printed for &#145;Humphry Blunden&#146; in <span class="italic">Cornhill</span>). The events surrounding the outbreak of civil war saw his productivity soar and in August 1642 he published <span class="italic">Certain Information from Devon and Dorset: concerning the Commission of Array</span> (printed for &#145;H. Blunden&#146;, 1642) and the third number of <span class="italic">Speciall Passages and Certain Informations from Severall Places</span> (printed for &#145;H. Blunden&#146;, 1642); one writer mockingly termed the latter newsbook &#145;Blunden's Passages&#146;  (<span class="italic">Mercurius Civicus</span>, 25, 1 May&#150;8 June 1643, 40). On 19 August 1644 Blunden signed the Stationers' Company petition to the House of Commons protesting at the &#145;monopolies&#146; held by royal patent to print English bibles and &#145;sundry Bookes of generall use&#146;  (Stationers' Company, Liber A: letter-book of the Stationers' Company, fol. 149<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>During the latter half of the 1640s Blunden entered into partnership with the bookseller John Partridge (<i>d</i>. 1649) and the printer Thomas Brudnell to issue the writings of the astrologer William Lilly. On Partridge's death Brudnell presented his executors, the booksellers Philemon Stephens and Luke Fawne, with a bill for &pound;368 18<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. This included a schedule of expenses incurred in the printing of Lilly's almanac <span class="italic">Merlini Anglici Ephemeris</span> (13,500 copies in 1646, 17,000 copies in 1647, and 18,500 copies in 1648). The last edition of Lilly's almanac issued by Blunden was for the year 1655. Blunden also published six works by Thomas Vaughan, and may be the H. B. who appended an encomium to &#145;his ever honour'd&#146; friend's <span class="italic">Magia Adamica, or, The Antiquity of Magick</span> (1650). Blunden himself was accounted &#145;an extraordinary Chymist&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.11). He was known to Samuel Hartlib, and also corresponded with the alchemist Johan Rudolph Glauber. Blunden had &#145;gotten an Instrument for curing of deafnes from Glauber which hee purposed to apply to his wife, but hee was faine to pay for it 5 lib.&#146;  (Sheffield University, Hartlib papers, 31/22/4A), and was the same Mr Blunden who queried &#145;some passages&#146; in Glauber's books  (Sheffield University, Hartlib papers, &#145;Ephemerides&#146;, Jan&#150;June 1648, 60/3/6A). Baxter, moreover, noted that it was Blunden who &#145;got Jacob Behmen his Books translated and printed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.11). Indeed, such was Blunden's enthusiasm for that &#145;deep illuminated man of God&#146; that he supplied the Yorkshire JP Durand Hotham with material for the latter's brief memoir of the German mystic (J. Boehme, <span class="italic">Four Tables of Divine Revelation</span>, trans. H. B., 1654, sig.H3; D. Hotham, <span class="italic">The Life of Jacob Behmen</span>, 1654, sig.B2). In all Blunden published ten works by or derived from the writings of Jacob Boehme, several in association with the printer Matthew Simmons. He is most likely the H. Blunden who supplied a prefatory epistle to Boehme's <span class="italic">Four Tables of Divine Revelation</span> (1654), a work rendered into English by H. B.&#151;either Blunden, a namesake licensed to practise medicine, or Humphrey Blundell (educated in Shropshire and a former pupil of Charles Hotham's) may be identified with this translator's monogram.<br>
<br>In his ephemeris for 1654 Hartlib noted that the servant of one White, a stationer near Aldgate, was &#145;very active&#146; and &#145;comes to dwel in Blundens-shop&#146;  (Sheffield University, Hartlib papers, &#145;Ephemerides&#146;, 1 Jan&#150;24 April 1654, 29/4/6A). Little else is known of Blunden's activities, though in March 1657 Johann Moriaen, a former minister at Cologne with interests in Helmontian medicine and chemistry, informed Hartlib that Blunden had corresponded with Petrus Serrarius, a millenarian resident in Amsterdam and an enthusiastic student of iatrochemistry and mystical theology. Another of Blunden's correspondents was the Bohemian-born chiliast and visionary Paul Felgenhauer (1563&#150;1661), with whom he discussed magic. In October 1671 a Mrs Blunden, widow, began receiving money from the Stationers' Company poor fund. Richard Baxter &#145;very much loved&#146; Blunden, &#145;who by his Consolotary Letters and Directions for Books, did afterwards do me the Offices of an useful Friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 1.11).<br>
