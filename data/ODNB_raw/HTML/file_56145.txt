<span class="headword">Mellor,  Joseph William</span>  (1869&#150;1938), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born on 9 July 1869 at Lindley, Huddersfield, the son of Job Mellor, a draper, and his wife, Emma Smith. When he was ten years old, the family emigrated to New Zealand, where his father found work in the woollen mills of Kaiapoi and later Dunedin on the South Island. His working-class background ruled out any thoughts of higher education, and at the age of thirteen he left school to take employment in boot manufacturing. In the evenings, however, by light of a kerosene lamp, he read second-hand or borrowed books and performed some chemical experiments.<br>
<br>Mellor's remarkable efforts at self-education eventually came to the attention of the director of the local technical school, who arranged for him to attend classes. In 1892 he was assisted by his school director to become a part-time student at the University of Otago in Dunedin. In 1898 he graduated with first-class honours and then took a teaching post at Lincoln Agricultural College. In the same year he married the organist at Mornington Methodist Church, Emma Cranwell Bakes. A few months later he resigned his post at the agricultural college and sailed from Port Chalmers to take up an 1851 Exhibition scholarship in Manchester, England.<br>
<br>In 1902 Mellor obtained the degree of DSc from the Victoria University, Manchester. He then accepted a teaching position at Newcastle under Lyme, Staffordshire. In 1904, the local pottery industry started a pottery school which soon became part of the North Staffordshire Technical College. Mellor lectured there and later became the principal. He was also secretary of the newly formed Ceramic Society. During the First World War he directed a modest research programme on refractories, which became the first stage in the formation of the British Ceramic Research Association. In 1921 the British Refractories Research Association was formed with Mellor as director. In 1927 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.<br>
<br>The Mellors had no children but he had four sisters in New Zealand and several nieces and nephews. He used to write to them amusing letters, illustrated with cartoons. Some of these were collected together by friends and published in 1934 under the title <span class="italic">Uncle Joe's Nonsense</span>. In addition he described his trip to the United States in 1929 (when the Ceramic Society travelled to New York on board the Cunard Line <i>Laconia</i>) in a 36-page brochure illustrated by witty cartoons and comments; three of the cartoons were also published in the <span class="italic">Journal of Chemical Education</span>. Two more cartoons were published a few years later in the same journal, in which Mellor showed himself fainting on the floor, and then recovering in hospital.<br>
<br>Mellor published 116 papers and obtained six patents, nearly all of which were on clays, ceramics, and refractories. He also published five books on inorganic chemistry (1912&#150;30), and pioneering texts on mathematics for chemists (1902) and chemical kinetics (1904), as well as on quantitative chemical analysis (1914), clay and pottery (1914), and metallography (1916). His major work, however, is a monumental sixteen-volume book on inorganic chemistry entitled <span class="italic">Comprehensive Treatise on Theoretical and Inorganic Chemistry</span> published between 1927 and 1937 in 15,320 pages, complete with extensive references to the original literature&#151;a characteristic of all Mellor's books. The book also contains numerous quotations from famous writers and poets. It is difficult to believe that a work of this scale was produced by one person working alone. He dedicated it to: &#145;the privates in the great army of workers in chemistry &hellip; [whose] names have been forgotten, [but whose] work remains&#146;. In his 1927 election certificate for the Royal Society his proposers for membership described this reference work as &#145;so valuable to chemists that its importance can hardly be over-estimated&#146;. Mellor himself was described as &#145;the leading authority on the scientific principles underlying the Pottery Industry&#146;.<br>
<br>Mellor retired in 1934 and died four years later at his home, 132 Highlands Heath, Portsmouth Road, Putney, on 24 May 1938. He was cremated in London. Some pieces from his pottery collection and other archive material were donated by his widow to the University of Otago. He left behind a wealth of books that form an important source for research in the history of chemistry, and which his widow donated to the public library in Dunedin. In 1949 the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry created an annual Mellor lecture in his honour and in 1954 a plaque in his memory was unveiled at the University of Otago in the presence of the duke of Edinburgh.<br>
