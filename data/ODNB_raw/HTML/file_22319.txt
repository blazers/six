<span class="headword">Pitcairn,  William</span>  (1712&#150;1791), <span class="occ">physician</span>, eldest son of David Pitcairn, minister of Dysart, Fife, and Catherine Hamilton, was born at Dysart on 9 May 1712. He studied at the University of Leiden, where he entered on the physic line on 15 October 1734, and attended the lectures of Boerhaave. He took the degree of MD at Rheims. His mother belonged to the Hamilton family, and Pitcairn became private tutor to James, sixth duke of Hamilton. He stayed with him at Oxford, and travelled abroad with him in 1742. The University of Oxford awarded Pitcairn the degree of MD at the opening of the Radcliffe Library in April 1749. Soon afterwards he began to practise in London, and was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians on 25 June 1750. In 1752 he was Goulstonian lecturer, and in 1753, 1755, 1759, and 1762 a censor. He was elected president in 1775, and continued to be elected until he resigned in 1785. He was elected physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital on 22 February 1750, and resigned on 3 February 1780. He was also physician to Christ's Hospital.<br>
<br>Pitcairn lived in Warwick Court, near the old College of Physicians in Warwick Lane, in the City of London, and had a very large practice as a physician. On 4 March 1784 he was elected treasurer of St Bartholomew's Hospital, and from then on he lived in the treasurer's house in the hospital. In 1770 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Pitcairn had a country residence, with a botanical garden of 5 acres, in Upper Street, Islington, and was an accomplished botanist who employed collectors in the East and West Indies. He was remembered at St Bartholomew's by having a ward named after him. He had great faith in the use of opium for fevers and particularly for enteric fever; the value of this treatment was not then recognized. Pitcairn received Radcliffe's gold-headed cane from Anthony Askew and his arms are engraved on it. The cane was passed on to his nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22315/', "David Pitcairn")</script>, who became physician at St Bartholomew's after his uncle's retirement.<br>
<br>Pitcairn's portrait by Joshua Reynolds was hung in the censor's room at the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Upper Street, Islington, on 25 November 1791, and was buried in a vault in the church of St Bartholomew-the-Less, within the hospital walls, on 1 December 1791. The contents of his garden and part of his library were sold by auction in 1792.<br>
