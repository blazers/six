<span class="headword">Macdonell,  Alexander Ranaldson, of Glengarry</span>  (1773&#150;1828), <span class="occ">chief of clan Macdonell or Macdonnell of Glengarry and soldier</span>, was born on 15 September 1773 at Invergarry, Inverness-shire, the first of nine children of Duncan Macdonell (<i>c</i>.1744&#150;1788), chief of clan Macdonell of Glengarry, and Marjory Grant (1744&#150;1792), of Dalvey. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17454/', "General Sir James Macdonell GCB (d. 1857)")</script> was his brother. In July 1788 he succeeded as chief of clan Macdonell, one of the great branches of clan Donald, inheriting estates stretching from Glengarry in the Great Glen to Knoydart on the Atlantic coast. Traditionally his clan was Roman Catholic but the chiefly house had become protestant, allowing Macdonell to matriculate at University College, Oxford, in October 1790.<br>
<br>In February 1793, following the outbreak of war with France, Macdonell received a captain's commission to recruit a company for the Strathspey fencibles, raised by his kinsman Sir James Grant. In August 1794, while still only twenty, he received a colonel's commission to raise the first fencible regiment of Glengarry Highlanders. Recruits were drawn principally from the Glengarry estates, threats of eviction being used where persuasion failed. His earlier attempt to raise an avowedly Catholic regiment failed because of official concern about whether such a unit would be publicly acceptable. Macdonell served with his regiment on garrison duty in Guernsey until August 1796, when he resigned command. His ambition for a career in the regular army was frustrated by opposition from the commander-in-chief, the duke of York&#151;possibly inspired by adverse reports from Macdonell's service with the Grant fencibles and by concerns about his character.<br>
<br>When the Glengarry fencibles were disbanded in 1802 Macdonell's failure to honour his earlier pledge to find land for the men resulted in a mass emigration to Canada led by Father Alexander Macdonell, the regimental chaplain, later first bishop of Upper Canada. In 1803 Macdonell raised the 4th Inverness volunteer battalion, later to become the 2nd Inverness-shire local militia. He continued in command until the local militia units were stood down in 1814.<br>
<br>Macdonell, whose Gaelic nickname Alasdair Fiadhaich (wild, or fierce, Alasdair) persuasively suggests his nature, was a man of violent disposition. In May 1798, following a quarrel at a ball, he fought a duel near Fort George, Inverness-shire, with Lieutenant Norman MacLeod of the 42nd foot. MacLeod died of his wounds and Macdonell stood trial for murder at the high court in Edinburgh in August 1798. He was acquitted, the jury's justification being his attempt to be reconciled to MacLeod before the exchange of shots. In 1807 he was found guilty of assaulting a tenant and ordered to pay &pound;2000 damages, the court also questioning his fitness to continue as a justice of the peace and deputy lord lieutenant of Inverness-shire.<br>
<br>Macdonell travelled on the continent in 1799&#150;1800 and suffered a mental breakdown in Vienna, resulting in his temporary confinement in the Narrenturm, the city's asylum. Following his return home, on 20 January 1802 he married Rebecca (1779&#150;1841), the second daughter of Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo, an Edinburgh banker. They had thirteen children; six of their seven sons died in infancy. The family homes were at Invergarry House, near Fort Augustus; Inverie, in Knoydart; and Garry Cottage, Perth.<br>
<br>Macdonell of Glengarry&#151;Mac Mhic Alasdair to give him his Gaelic patronymic&#151;was a passionate advocate of a fast-vanishing traditional highland way of life, travelling with his &#145;tail&#146;&#151;the traditional highland chief's band of retainers. He maintained a family bard, and in 1815 founded the Society of True Highlanders, a coterie of like-minded highland grandees. His apparently genuine attachment to Gaeldom and tradition did not however preclude his clearing much of his land for the introduction of large-scale sheep farming&#151;a policy inimical to preserving the traditional way of life for his tenants, whose numbers fell sharply during his period of control. Walter Scott, who knew him well and probably modelled the figure of Fergus MacIvor in <span class="italic">Waverley</span> on him, described him as &#145;a kind of Quixote in our age &hellip; He seems to have lived a century too late&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Journal of Sir Walter Scott</span>, ed. D. Douglas, 2 vols., 1891, 1.120).<br>
<br>Macdonell pursued a bitter dispute over the title of chief of Clanranald with Ranald George MacDonald of Clanranald&#151;a controversy centring on the alleged illegitimacy of a sixteenth-century Clanranald. Macdonell vainly applied to the Court of Session to have Clanranald's arms declared invalid, and frequently signed himself Macdonell of Glengarry and Clanranald, asserting his house's claim to the headship of clan Donald.<br>
<br>Although aggressive estate management had increased his rents, an extravagant lifestyle faced Macdonell with serious financial problems. On 17 January 1828 he was travelling to Edinburgh on the steamship <i>Stirling Castle</i>, to take legal advice about his finances, when it ran aground in Loch Linnhe. Macdonell, anxious for the safety of his two daughters, who had been taken ashore, jumped overboard, struck his head on a rock, and died later that day at Inverscaddle. He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kilfinnan, Inverness-shire, on 1 February.<br>
<br>The trustees for his son, &AElig;neas Ranaldson, a nineteen-year-old Edinburgh University student, found debts amounting to &pound;80,000. Invergarry House was let; Garry Cottage in Perth was sold. In 1836 the Glengarry estate was sold, and later the adjacent Glen Quoich estate also was sold. Such was the complexity of Macdonell's finances that it was not until 1847 that an inventory of his personal estate was completed.<br>
