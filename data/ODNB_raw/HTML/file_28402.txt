<span class="headword">Wagstaffe,  William</span>  (1683/4&#150;1725), <span class="occ">physician and satirist</span>, was born at Cublington, Buckinghamshire, the only son of the Revd Thomas Wagstaffe, rector of Cublington. He was related to the Wagstaffes of Knightcote in Warwickshire, and was a relation of Sir Joseph Wagstaffe. He went to school in Northampton, and in 1700 entered Lincoln College, Oxford, where he graduated BA (1704) and MA (1707).<br>
<br>In 1707 Wagstaffe moved to London, where his relative the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28400/', "Revd Thomas Wagstaffe (1645&#150;1712)")</script> was a nonjuror, one of the Church of England clergy who refused to swear allegiance to William and Mary and who were deprived of a living. Although unlicensed, Thomas Wagstaffe practised physic without interference from the College of Physicians. William Wagstaffe acquired a taste for medical studies, and he also married Thomas Wagstaffe's daughter. She died soon afterwards and he married, secondly, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2238/', "Charles Bernard")</script>, surgeon to St Bartholomew's Hospital. Wagstaffe graduated BM and DM at Oxford in 1714; he was elected a fellow of the College of Physicians in 1718, and was a censor in 1720. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1718. A reader in anatomy to the barber&#150;surgeons since 1715, he was elected physician to St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1720, on the death of Salisbury Cade. He wrote &#145;A letter showing the danger and uncertainty of inoculating the small pox&#146; (1722), and edited James Drake's anatomical manual.<br>
<br>Wagstaffe's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works</span> (1725) contains a biographical preface, suggesting that Henry Levett, a physician at St Bartholomew's, was its author. The pieces had appeared separately and it was thought by Dilke and Sir Henry Craik that Swift might have been their author, though the Revd Whitwell Elwin did not agree. The various pieces ridicule the praise of Chevy Chase in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span> (nos. 70 and 74), and they attack Benjamin Hoadly, Marlborough, John Woodward, and Richard Steele, who credited Swift with this piece. Wagstaffe had no personal enmity against Steele, whom he did not know by sight. Daniel Turner, who had met Wagstaffe in consultation, praised his honesty and good nature. Wagstaffe was also a friend of John Freind, and may have met Swift at Charles Bernard's. He approved of Henry Sacheverell, and was a high-churchman and a hater of the whigs.<br>
<br>Wagstaffe was a lover of good company but, spending more time in society than in study, he became impoverished and, in consequence, melancholy. The weight upon his spirits led to illness from which a contemporary said he &#145;might have recovered if he had unburdened his mind to some who had a more than ordinary value for him&#146;  (Nichols, 324). In March 1725 he obtained formal leave of absence from St Bartholomew's, and went to Bath for his health. He died there on 5 May 1725.<br>
