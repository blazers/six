<span class="headword">Linge,  Bernard  van</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Berent  van Lingen]</span>  (<em>b. </em>1598, <em>d.</em> in or after 1644), <span class="occ">glass painter</span>, was born in Emden, East Friesland, close to the United Provinces, the eldest child of Bernard van Lingen (<i>fl</i>. 1595&#150;1627) and his wife, Gerret Jacobs van Damn. He learned his trade from his father and possibly his grandfather, both of whom were masters of the Emden glaziers' guild.<br>
<br>Bernard worked in Paris &#145;upon great or history work&#146;  (Jackson, 163) from 1617 to 1621. That year religious conflict broke out again in France and Bernard's protestant sympathies led him to flee to London. He utilized family connections within the Dutch stranger community to obtain employment in the studio of a glazier, Thomas Langton. However, the traditional rivalry between English and Dutch glaziers made it difficult to find work in the capital and that July Langton recommended him to the warden and fellows of Wadham College, Oxford, as being &#145;an excellent pencil man and of sober and good carriage not given to drink&#146;  (ibid.) for the execution of their chapel's east window. The scheme, completed in 1622, depicts in the main lights ten scenes from Christ's passion. These were modelled on engravings by Hieronymus Wierix (after Maarten de Vos) in a work of Jesuit theology, Hieronymus Natalis's <span class="italic">Adnotationes et meditationes in evangelia</span> (2nd edn, Antwerp, 1595), and featured <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> anti-types awkwardly crammed into the upper tracery lights in a manner similar to that of a 1530s scheme at Balliol College. The choice of precedents was probably dictated by the strong Catholic influences then current at Wadham. Further undocumented prophet figures in van Linge's style occur in the chapel's north windows, and are perhaps inspired by the medieval antechapel windows at New College. The project's cartoons were later reused on a smaller scale for the passion cycle at Wroxton Abbey, near Banbury, though whether this work was by Bernard or by his younger brother <a href="#cosubject_53512">Abraham [<i>see below</i>]</a> is unclear.<br>
<br>Apostle figures bearing Bernard van Linge's signature also survive on the south side of Lincoln's Inn chapel, London, facing a set of prophets which is stylistically attributable to Abraham; the latter has been incomplete since air-raid damage in 1915. Other pieces, including decorative quarries at Gorhambury, Hertfordshire (<i>c</i>.1622&#150;1626), ornamental, heraldic, and figure work at Lydiard Park and Lydiard Tregoze, Wiltshire (<i>c</i>.1628&#150;1631), and the glass portrait of the doctrinal trimmer Bishop Robert King (<i>d</i>. 1557) in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, have been attributed to Bernard, but he left England in 1623, and the style of the pieces is more reminiscent of his brother's work. In 1625 Bernard was admitted a master in the glaziers' guild at Emden, where he fathered three daughters and a son between 1629 and 1644. The family remained active in both the guild and civic government for the rest of the century.<br>
<br>Bernard's brother <a name="cosubject_53512"></a><span class="headword">Abraham  van Linge</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1623&#150;1642), <span class="occ">glass painter</span>, the fourth child of Bernard van Lingen and Gerret Jacobs van Damn, probably arrived in England in 1623, and although less well documented is better represented in surviving work. Apart from projects on which he collaborated or in which he has been confused with his brother, he has been convincingly connected to a number of schemes, of which the most accomplished and extensive were <span class="italic">The Deposition from the Cross</span> (1629), originally at Hampton Court, Herefordshire, but now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; a cycle of biblical themes in Christ Church Cathedral (1630&#150;40), of which only the <span class="italic">Jonah</span> window remains <i>in situ</i>; prophet and apostle side windows, closely related to his Lincoln's Inn work, and a typological east window at Lincoln College, Oxford (1631); <span class="italic">The Life of Christ</span>, <span class="italic">Last Judgment</span>, and a portrait group at Queen's College, Oxford (1635&#150;7); and an <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New Testament</span> programme at University College, Oxford (1641). Abraham is last mentioned in correspondence relating to the final project in 1642. As the religious and political establishment (together with its art patronage) came under ever-increasing attack, care was taken to arrange for payment in the event of involuntary incompletion and Abraham's hasty departure for the continent. Although he fulfilled his contract, it appears that he emigrated in that year: no further record of him survives.<br>
<br>Abraham's work, more stylistically accomplished than his brother's, also provides a glimpse into the complex relationship of developments in art and in religious sentiment through the 1630s. On the one hand the work exemplified the genesis of a new, distinctly protestant iconography, which substituted biblical figures for Catholic saints. Abraham's Hampton Court <span class="italic">Deposition</span> inscription boldly proclaims that &#145;The truth hereof is historicall devine and not superstissious&#146;  (N. Tyacke, <span class="italic">Anti-Calvinists: the Rise of English Arminianism, c.1590&#150;1640</span>, 1987, 219). On the other hand, especially in the context of an Oxford bitterly divided under Archbishop William Laud's authoritarian chancellorship, while van Linge's Christ Church glass was eulogized by poets in the circle of the dean (and from 1628 to 1632 bishop of Oxford), Richard Corbett, it encountered the hostility of those who found in the drive to beautify churches and chapels evidence of creeping cryptopopery. Like some other examples of church decoration in the city, his University College pieces were hidden in the 1640s and 1650s for fear of iconophobic vandalism.<br>
<br>From the end of the seventeenth century Joshua Price and William Price the elder carried out with unusual sensitivity extensive repairs and reordering of the van Linge brothers' work at Wadham, Queen's, and Wroxton. This perhaps indicates the esteem in which they were then held. The nineteenth and twentieth centuries were more critical, their work being at one point described as &#145;remembered but not with much kindness&#146;  (Garrod, 30). However, Abraham's work is now appreciated as the most sophisticated of his generation, although a detailed study of his iconography remains to be written. At one time nearly all the seventeenth-century glass surviving in England was attributed to the van Linge brothers. The corpus remains fluid, with debate continuing over a number of works, including the glazing of Peterhouse chapel, Cambridge. In 2002 significant lost fragments of the Christ Church scheme were rediscovered; electronic reconstruction was still in progress in 2004.<br>
