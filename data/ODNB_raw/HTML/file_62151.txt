<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Faithfull,  Lucy</span>, Baroness Faithfull  (1910&#150;1996), <span class="occ">social worker and children's campaigner</span>, was born on 26 October 1910 in South Africa, the only daughter and elder child of Sydney Leigh Faithfull, a lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, and his wife, Elizabeth Adie Algie, a nurse. After her father was killed in action in 1916, the family returned to England where, in straitened circumstances, her mother found residential employment. From the age of seven Faithfull was sent to boarding-school, an unhappy experience which was later to influence strongly her determination to confront childhood suffering in all its manifestations. For many years there was no settled family home, as Faithfull and her brother followed their mother to her successive places of employment. In later life she told few of this early deprivation; indeed, many thought that wider family connections had meant privilege which had eased her way into the House of Lords. After her education at Talbot Heath School, Bournemouth, she attended the Sorbonne in Paris and Birmingham University, graduating with a diploma in social sciences from the latter in 1933. Her subsequent career was largely in the field of child care. She was club leader and sub-warden, Birmingham settlement, from 1932 to 1935; assistant organizer of child care, London county council education department, 1935&#150;40; regional welfare officer (evacuation), Ministry of Health, 1940&#150;48; inspector, children's branch, Home Office, 1948&#150;58; and children's officer (1958&#150;70), and then director of social services (1970&#150;74), Oxford city council. She was made OBE in 1972.<br>
<br>In 1975 Faithfull was created Baroness Faithfull of Wolvercote; it was an ironic commentary on political priorities of the period that it was left to a septuagenarian, and subsequently octogenarian, tory peer to take the lead on so many social policy campaigns between 1980 and 1996. She was the only social worker of her generation to be created a life peer, and there were some who felt at the time that she was a curious choice, Oxford city being one of the smallest local authorities, which had just disappeared in the latest reorganization. She was to prove them wrong, for it was in parliament, and in particular in her last decade, that she really flowered. During most of her time in the Lords, she was almost the only member with direct professional experience of services for children in need and social work. She felt that she had an absolute responsibility to act as the voice in parliament of those who worked with and for children, and to advise and educate her colleague peers. She was proud of voting according to a conscience, rather than the party line, often to the despair of tory whips, to some of whom she became known as Lady Faithless; for them the problem was not just her vote, but the numbers of her colleagues that she persuaded to follow her into the opposition lobbies.<br>
<br>For much of her time in parliament, Faithfull chaired the all-party group on children; from this base she co-ordinated the cross-party campaign for parliamentary time for the <span class="roman">Children Act</span> of 1989. Much of the groundwork which had exposed the need for this act had been done in a succession of select committees with which she had a close direct or indirect association in the late 1970s and early 1980s. As the bill was regarded as politically uncontentious (a strange judgement, since it anticipated many of what were to become the social exclusion policies of the 1997 Labour administration), it was introduced in the Lords, where much of the detailed work was done.<br>
<br>One great cause of Faithfull's was to alleviate the brutality with which the criminal justice system could treat children. She was a passionate advocate of the superior approach of the Scottish system of children's panels, and when the possibility of introducing similar reforms into England presented itself in the bill which was to become the <span class="roman">Prosecution of Offences Act</span> of 1985, she lobbied energetically throughout. She met the responsible senior Home Office minister, who was unwise enough to patronize her; he, as a barrister, recognized her case, but said that there was no way that it could be a political priority. The faces of the condescending civil servants sheltering behind their minister looked a little different four days later when they sought to negotiate for terms during the tea break as an alternative to her defeating the government. She had persuaded most of the cross-benchers to support her, law lords, bishops, and all.<br>
<br>Faithfull had other campaigns&#151;in particular for mental health and more effective care in the community. She was also most concerned about the resources for social work training, and once used her direct access to the prime minister to lead a delegation of social workers to meet with her. Theirs was not a popular cause of Mrs Thatcher's, but Faithfull, fearless of the handbag, told her at the start of the allotted hour that she should listen and not interrupt. A few days later a discreet announcement eased the crisis of resources. Her last campaign was against the Conservative government's plans to establish a network of commercially managed secure training centres for young offenders under the age of fifteen. She found the idea of profits being made from these children offensive, and challenged the need for more of these expensive facilities when inefficient use was being made of those that already existed. She also played an active role in many voluntary organizations. She was a vice-president of Barnardos; had been a founder, and for many years president, of the National Children's Bureau; was chair of Council of Caldecott, a therapeutic community for children; and gave her name to the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, which pioneered advanced child protection strategies in its work with abusers.<br>
<br>A small, trim figure, usually moving at a brisk trot from one meeting to another, weighed down with at least two briefcases overflowing with paper, Faithfull was, until the end, a very familiar sight in the House of Lords, and to the host of those whom she invited to the succession of campaigning meetings she convened there. Indeed, on the day before her death she hosted a meeting of nearly a hundred friends and colleagues to discuss how the fiftieth anniversary of the <span class="roman">Children Act</span> of 1948, to which they had all contributed so much, should be marked. Taken ill at the end of the meeting, and on her way to hospital, she passed the House's electronic screens announcing the order that would require every local authority to prepare a statutory plan for its children services. This had been a missing component of the <span class="roman">Children Act</span> of 1989, which had been a major cause of hers all through the 1980s, and she had campaigned ceaselessly for this later 1996 legislation.<br>
<br>Faithfull's last day in the House of Lords was a vignette of her life and summed up both her continuity and her persistence. She made no claims to intellectual brilliance, and could at times be impatient of detail and see or describe things in a broad-brush way. Often, this apparent vagueness could be deceptive, as many a minister found to his cost. She was remorseless in seeking briefing from those from whom she sought advice&#151;successions of notes in indecipherable handwriting would arrive. She died at St Thomas's Hospital, London, on 13 March 1996, following a stroke, and was cremated in Oxford. She was unmarried.<br>
