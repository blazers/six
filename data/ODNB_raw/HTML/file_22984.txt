<span class="headword">Ratcliffe <span class="st"> [Radcliffe]</span>,  John</span>, sixth Baron Fitzwalter  (1452&#150;1496), <span class="occ">rebel</span>, of Attleborough, Norfolk, was nine years old when his father, John, was killed on 28 March 1461, the day before the battle of Towton. At three his mother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65123/', "Elizabeth Fitzwalter (1430&#150;c.1485)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54522/', "Fitzwalter family (per. c.1200&#150;c.1500)")</script>], had been acquired as ward by his grandfather to secure the ennoblement of the Ratcliffes via the Fitzwalter barony. Although, in 1467, Lady Fitzwalter married John Dynham, who ultimately became Henry VII's lord treasurer, her first husband's death deprived the family of the status accruing from a successful baronial career. It is possible that, in the 1460s, Ratcliffe was brought up partly in Devon; but his first public duty was as JP in Norfolk during Henry VI's government of 1470&#150;71.<br>
<br>The coincidence from which Ratcliffe's career sprang happened in Calais in 1476. He may already have been serving in Calais, for among Calais's officers was his uncle Robert. John led a retinue to fight in France in 1475, and, in that year or early 1476, married Margaret, the daughter of the lieutenant of Gu&icirc;nes Castle, Sir Richard Whetehill. The couple returned to England in the summer of 1476. Through family friendship with the Pastons, Ratcliffe supplied William, Lord Hastings, lieutenant of Calais, with a cook, a talented man who had worked for both himself and his father-in-law. Instantly Ratcliffe was JP and MP for Norfolk, and afterwards assuredly powerful in Norfolk and East Anglia. Hastings's execution in 1483 ended his sense of secure political place. Ratcliffe quickly accommodated himself with the new king. On 6 July, three weeks after Hastings's death, he was a sewer (server of dishes) at Richard III's coronation, and by the end of the year associated with Richard's comptroller of the household. Yet he may have been dabbling treasonably with Henry Tudor. On Henry's accession Ratcliffe was showered with offices: steward and receiver of the honour of Richmond in Norfolk; steward of the duchy of Lancaster in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridge; feodary in Norfolk and Suffolk; chief justice and warden of forests south of the Trent and then of all forests. Perhaps his stewardship of the household was reward for his commitment to Tudor before Bosworth; a commitment similar to his promise to Warbeck in 1493.<br>
<br>From 1485 to 1492 Fitzwalter played a key role in East Anglia; but almost all records show him in conflict with his neighbours: in the winter of 1484&#150;5 he quarrelled with Sir Robert Chamberlain; as steward of the duchy of Lancaster he reprimanded the Pastons. In politics, and personally, he was duplicitous. In October 1485 he charged the servants of Elizabeth, countess of Surrey, with making treasonable remarks about the new king. Fitzwalter had already promised the earl of Oxford and Elizabeth that he would be a good lord to her and her imprisoned husband, Thomas Howard. The countess besought Fitzwalter's Paston friends to remind him of his promise, and expressed amazement at his behaviour; he was a near relation as well as neighbour. Two years later similarly disingenuous behaviour occurred before the battle of East Stoke. In April 1487 Fitzwalter was empowered to repair beacons and array troops in Norfolk and Essex; but in May the earl of Oxford was given wide-ranging powers to raise troops in East Anglia. Fitzwalter summoned several important gentry to Attleborough and told them that Oxford's commission was illegal, and that as steward of the household he had precedence: they should not march with Oxford. John Paston (he lied) was considering not marching with Oxford, and was in touch with the rebel Francis, Lord Lovell. Fitzwalter's lack of wealth may have contributed to his recklessness. In the late 1480s he forcibly took Normans Manor, Norfolk, from William Doget and his wife. When in 1492 he lost the case arising in the king's council, he relaunched it in the court of common pleas. This provoked Henry VII's angry intervention in Star Chamber. Fitzwalter's political ambition was doomed. The earl of Surrey had re-entered national politics and was about to be restored in East Anglia as equal in power with Oxford. Although Fitzwalter was still in local government between 1488 and 1491, he lost his stewardship of the duchy, and in 1490 he was judged to be in contempt of the king's council in Doget's case. He remained on the bench in Essex until 1495; elsewhere he had lost his positions in the administration of East Anglia.<br>
<br>This failing career coincided with the Perkin Warbeck conspiracy. On 12 and 14 January 1493 Fitzwalter, with Sir Robert Clifford, decided to offer support to Margaret of Burgundy. Fitzwalter allegedly promised fifty men-at-arms to fight for Warbeck, wherever he landed. Members of Fitzwalter's family may have been drawn into the conspiracy: his uncle Robert, former porter of Calais, and his steward and cousin Thomas Cressener. He was also said to have sent to Warbeck three men who later took part in his landing at Deal in 1495. Despite maintaining an outward show of loyalty, notably at the creation of the king's son Henry as duke of York in December 1493, Fitzwalter was exposed when Sir Robert Clifford, who had fled to Flanders, returned to England in 1494. Fitzwalter was arrested and delivered to court, on 20 January 1495, by servants of the earl of Oxford. Unlike Sir William Stanley, Henry VII's chamberlain, Fitzwalter was not immediately executed. He was tried, on 23 February 1495, and then transported to Gu&icirc;nes, previously familiar to him and near his Whetehill brother-in-law, then comptroller of Calais. Fitzwalter, however, did not learn his lesson, and in the autumn of 1496 tried to escape from Gu&icirc;nes. By now England and Scotland were at war, with Warbeck as the cause. Fitzwalter's behaviour was not to be tolerated and he was executed that November, either at Gu&icirc;nes or at Calais; he was buried in the December following. The judgment might seem harsh, but it received a sort of vindication three years later, when a last pretender, Ralph Wilford, emerged in Fitzwalter's home territory of East Anglia to trouble the king's peace.<br>
