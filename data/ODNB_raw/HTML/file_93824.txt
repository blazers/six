<span class="headword">Hatton,  Murray Edward Gordon  Finch-</span>, twelfth earl of Winchilsea and seventh earl of Nottingham  (1851&#150;1898), <span class="occ">politician and agriculturist</span>, was born on 28 March 1851 at Wilton Crescent, London, the second son of the ultra-tory, anti-Catholic politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9447/', "George William Finch-Hatton, tenth earl of Winchilsea and fifth earl of Nottingham (1791&#150;1858)")</script>, and his third wife, Fanny Margaretta (<i>d</i>. 1909), daughter of Edward Royd Rice of Dane Court, Kent. He spent his early years (until his father's death) at the family seat in Eastwell Park, near Ashford in Kent, and was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford (1870&#150;74), where he developed a lasting admiration for Benjamin Jowett, the college's famous master. In later life the two exchanged visits and correspondence. Independent of spirit, Finch-Hatton combined academic excellence with mild eccentricity: he cultivated bell ringing as a hobby, kept an organ in his rooms, and in 1874 took first-class honours in modern history. There followed in 1875 election to a fellowship at the newly refounded Hertford College, which he relinquished later that year on his marriage, on 27 October 1875, to Edith (1855&#150;1944), daughter of Edward William Harcourt of Nuneham Park, Conservative MP for Oxfordshire.<br>
<br>A Conservative, Finch-Hatton unsuccessfully contested Newark at the general election of 1880. In 1884 he won a by-election in Lincolnshire South and was returned for Lincolnshire, Spalding, at the general elections of 1885 and 1886. In the House of Commons, Finch-Hatton showed considerable interest in imperial affairs. This was perhaps partly because his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33131/', "Harold Heneage Finch-Hatton")</script>, author of <span class="italic">Advance Australia!</span> and a boomerang expert, had lived in Queensland for some years. His maiden speech, in March 1884, dealt with the Liberal government's Egypt policy. A firm imperialist, Finch-Hatton supported the Imperial Federation League in the 1880s and remained an advocate of imperial federation throughout his life.<br>
<br>Finch-Hatton remained an MP until 1887, when he succeeded his half-brother to the peerage. In the House of Lords, Winchilsea (as he had become) made agriculture, rather than empire, the particular focus of his politics. Significantly, in 1889 he turned down the offer of the governorship of Cape Colony. As the inheritor of nearly 12,900 acres of heavily mortgaged estates, he experienced at first hand the late nineteenth-century depression in agriculture. In 1892, not long after he came into possession, falling income forced him to sell Eastwell Park, his childhood home. Appalled by the state of agriculture, which he regarded as England's &#145;national industry&#146;, Winchilsea conceived the idea of a popular, cross-class, non-partisan pressure group to champion the interests of all those who lived by the land. In December 1892, at a congress held in London to draw attention to the depressed condition of agriculture, he unveiled his plan. Encouraged by the positive reception it received, he set about establishing a working organization. By March 1893 a governing council had been formed, a newspaper (<span class="italic">The Cable</span>) launched, and the National Agricultural Union (NAU) had come into being, with Winchilsea as its president.<br>
<br>Open to &#145;all persons interested in agriculture&#146;, the NAU sought to mobilize mass support behind a programme of legislative action. At the outset the programme consisted of six items: tax relief for agricultural land; reduction of railway rates; state-aided old age pensions for agricultural labourers; land tenure reform; extension of the merchandizing marks and food adulteration laws; and state funding for landlord provision of smallholdings. This remained unchanged until April 1897, which saw reform of the beer duties, bimetallism, and other measures added to the list. The NAU and its programme attracted significant support. By December 1894 it claimed 365 local branches and over 50,000 members, four-fifths of whom were said to be agricultural labourers. At the general election of 1895, 283 candidates gave their backing to the full NAU programme, and 81 to parts of it. Of these 364 candidates, 217 were elected, comprising 160 tories, 28 Liberal Unionists, and 29 Liberals.<br>
<br>Winchilsea made strenuous efforts to organize his parliamentary supporters into a coherent &#145;agricultural party&#146; to push for the enactment of NAU proposals. These efforts, however, foundered on the rock of established party loyalties, with the NAU never securing much influence at Westminster. Outside parliament the extent of Winchilsea's success was also limited. Despite NAU claims, membership probably never exceeded about 30,000, the spread of local branches was extremely uneven (being concentrated in the south and midlands), and many members were reluctant to contribute time or funds to the cause. Following three years of growth the NAU began to stagnate, and after 1896 slipped into gradual decline&#151;not the least reason for this being Winchilsea's incapacitation through illness from January 1897. The NAU finally disappeared in January 1901, when it was amalgamated with R. A. Yerburgh's Agricultural Organisation Society, a body that promoted co-operative methods of agriculture.<br>
<br>Co-operation was one of Winchilsea's main concerns in his last years. In March 1896 he set up the British Produce Supply Association (BPSA) as a commercial co-operative. The BPSA aimed at establishing a network of depots to receive and distribute agricultural produce. However, the BPSA was ill run and proved a failure, folding after three years of heavy losses. The problems of the BPSA (which were apparent early on) placed strain on Winchilsea. Early in 1897 his health collapsed, and despite trips to France and South Africa in an attempt to recover he died at his Lincolnshire estate, Haverholme Priory, Sleaford, on 7 September 1898. He was buried on 12 September at Ewerby in Lincolnshire. He was survived by his wife and their only daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35357/', "Lady Muriel Evelyn Vernon Paget")</script>; their only son, Viscount Maidstone, had died in 1891, aged nine.<br>
<br>Until his final illness Winchilsea was a restlessly energetic man, frequently working eighteen-hour days for the NAU and <span class="italic">The Cable</span> (for which he wrote all leading articles). Aside from matters agricultural and political, his energy found an outlet in an eclectic range of pastimes. These included bricklaying, glazing, dyke digging, shorthand writing, climbing (often up cliffs in pursuit of eagles' eggs, which he collected), and motoring. He was a prominent participant in the famous motor-car procession from London to Brighton on 14 November 1896, presiding at the celebratory dinner that evening.<br>
