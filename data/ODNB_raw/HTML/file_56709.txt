<span class="headword">Praed <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> Murray-Prior]</span>,  Rosa Caroline</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Mrs Campbell Praed]</span>  (1851&#150;1935), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 27 March 1851 on her father's cattle property, Bromelton, near Brisbane, New South Wales, Australia, the third of eleven children of Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior (1819&#150;1892), pastoralist and MP, and his first wife, Matilda (1828&#150;1868), daughter of Thomas Harpur and his wife, Rosa Adams. Educated mostly by her mother and by governesses, Rosa Murray-Prior lived on a succession of pastoral and farm properties and in Brisbane, where her father became postmaster-general and a member of the legislative council of the newly declared state of Queensland. Experience of both pioneering bush conditions and Brisbane's &eacute;lite social and political circles was stored for later use in fiction. In 1872 she married Arthur Campbell Bulkley Praed (1846&#150;1901), known as Campbell Praed, a younger son of an English brewing and banking family, and went with him to live on his cattle run, Monte Christo, on Curtis Island off the Queensland coast. Lonely and unhappy there, Praed was delighted when in 1875 Campbell Praed decided to sell up and return to England.<br>
<br>Encouraged by her mother to write, Praed as a teenager had produced a number of romance novelettes for the family's handwritten, monthly &#145;Maroon Magazine&#146;. On arrival in England she resumed writing and submitted Australian sketches to various publishers. Encouragement from George Meredith and Frank Chapman led to the publication of her first novel, <span class="italic">An Australian Heroine</span>, in 1880. Over the next thirty-five years Praed published almost fifty books, including four in collaboration with the Irish politician and author Justin McCarthy. Their attempt to produce a novel, <span class="italic">&#145;The Right Honourable&#146;</span> (1886), which combined the insights of male and female, led to a close friendship terminated by McCarthy's death in 1912. Praed edited his letters to her as <span class="italic">Our Book of Memories</span> (1912).<br>
<br>Praed had a lifelong interest in the supernatural. She was involved with the Theosophical Society in London in the early 1880s and hosted meetings of the society in her house. Occult themes appear in her novels of this period such as <span class="italic">The Brother of the Shadow</span> (1887) and <span class="italic">The Soul of Countess Adrian</span> (1892), and continue throughout her later books. In 1899 she left her husband to live with another writer, Anne (Nancy) Harward (1864&#150;1927). Praed believed Nancy to be the reincarnation of a Roman slave girl whom Praed herself, in an earlier life, had oppressed. The Roman past revealed by Nancy in a series of s&eacute;ances was fictionalized as <span class="italic">Nyria</span> (1904) and recounted in more documentary form as <span class="italic">Soul of Nyria</span> (1931). Although not as committed to astrology as Nancy, Praed was convinced of the reality and importance of the spiritual plane. An unpublished book consists of the teachings of nature spirits with whom Praed communicated.<br>
<br>Praed's literary reputation peaked about 1890 on the basis of her Australian stories such as <span class="italic">Policy and Passion</span> (1881), which describes the tensions between a self-made Australian politician and his Anglophile daughter, <span class="italic">The Head Station</span> (1885), and <span class="italic">Outlaw and Lawmaker</span> (1893). She also achieved a reputation for sensational psychological studies of victimized or tragic women, as in <span class="italic">Nadine</span> (1882), <span class="italic">Moloch</span> (1883), <span class="italic">The Bond of Wedlock</span> (1887; dramatized in London as <span class="italic">Ariane</span>), and <span class="italic">Christina Chard</span> (1893). <span class="italic">Affinities</span> (1885), with its protagonist based on Oscar Wilde, reflects the prominent social and artistic circles in which she moved at this time. After revisiting Australia in the mid-1890s she published an autobiographical account of her Australian days in <span class="italic">My Australian Girlhood</span> (1902), in which she bids farewell to the pioneer era, her own youth, and the Australian Aborigines, then believed to be dying out. Praed thought the lasting value of her work was in its investigations of the supernatural. Fitfully reprinted since the 1980s, she is now valued for her energetic Anglo-Australian literary sensibility, as a critic of female oppression, and as a complex example of late Victorian sexual ambiguity.<br>
<br>An unenthusiastic mother, Praed bore four children before separating from her husband in 1899. Three sons predeceased her, one dying in a car crash in California, one in a hunting accident in South Africa, and one, racked by terminal cancer, shooting himself. Her daughter was placed in a mental asylum. All died childless. Praed herself died on 10 April 1935 at her home, 12 Lower Erith Road, Torquay, Devon, and was buried with Nancy in Kensal Green cemetery, London.<br>
