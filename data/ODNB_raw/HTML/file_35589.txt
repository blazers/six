</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Powell,  Frederick York</span>  (1850&#150;1904), <span class="occ">historian</span>, born on 14 January 1850 at 43 Woburn Place, Bloomsbury, was the eldest child and only son of Frederick Powell and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1910), daughter of Dr James York (<i>d</i>. 1882), a physician who was also a Spanish scholar. His father, a commissariat merchant, who had an office in Mincing Lane, came of a south Wales family. Much of Powell's early life was spent at Sandgate, Kent, where he learned to love the sea and formed lifelong friendships with some fishermen. In the autumn of 1859 he went to the Manor House preparatory school at Hastings. In 1864 he entered Dr Jex Blake's house at Rugby, but though he gained a name for esoteric learning he never rose above the lower fifth and left, chiefly for reasons of health, in July 1866. The next two years were fruitfully spent in travel and self-education. There was a visit to Biarritz, and a tour in Sweden which gave Powell, who had read Sir George Webbe Dasent's translation of <span class="italic">Burnt Njal</span> at Rugby, occasion to learn and practise a Scandinavian language. At eighteen he began to work on Old French, German, and Icelandic with Henry Tull Rhoades at Bonchurch. He was already a strong socialist and agnostic, and had formed most of the tastes and prejudices which accompanied him through life&#151;an interest in old armour, a special attraction for the art of William Blake, a passion for northern and medieval literature, and an aversion to philosophy, except for Kant and Schopenhauer.<br>
<br>Powell went to Oxford in 1868, and after a year spent with the non-collegiate students migrated to Christ Church. He gained a first class in law and modern history in the Trinity term of 1872. After graduating, he spent two years (1872&#150;4) at his father's house in Lancaster Gate in London. He entered the Middle Temple on 8 November 1870, and was called to the bar on 6 June 1874.<br>
<br>Powell's first academic appointment was to teach one of the few subjects in which he had no enthusiastic interest. In 1874 he was appointed to a lecturership in law at Christ Church, and save for a year's interlude as history lecturer at Trinity College, where his teaching method was felt to be &#145;too irregular and haphazard&#146; by some of the students  (Elton, 1.27), his official teaching in Oxford was, until 1894, confined to the uncongenial subjects of law and political economy. He had, however, attracted the attention of Mandell Creighton, who invited him to contribute a volume on early English history to Longman's <span class="roman">Epochs of English History</span>, of which Creighton was editor. The book, <span class="italic">Early England to the Norman Conquest</span>, published in 1876, delighted Creighton, who praised its clarity of style. These were to be the years of Powell's best work. In 1869 he had met Gudbrandur Vigf&uacute;sson, who had come to Oxford in 1866 to edit the <span class="italic">Icelandic&#150;English Dictionary</span> for the Oxford press. In 1877 Powell engaged with Vigf&uacute;sson upon the prolegomena to an edition of <span class="italic">Sturlunga saga</span>, &#145;taking down across the table&#146;, said Vigf&uacute;sson, &#145;my thoughts and theories, so that though the substance and drift of the arguments are mine, the English with the exception of bits and phrases here and there is Mr. Powell's throughout.&#146; An <span class="italic">Icelandic Prose Reader</span>, the notes to which were mainly the work of Powell, followed in 1879, and two years later the <span class="italic">Corpus poeticum boreale</span>, an edition of the whole of <span class="italic">Ancient Northern Poetry</span>, with translations and a full commentary. The translations were provided by Powell and exhibited his command of a style reminiscent of Dasent's early work.<br>
<br>The first volume contains the old mythological and heroic poetry: the poems of the <span class="italic">Poetic Edda</span> and similar texts. The second volume is a collection of the poems composed, chiefly by Icelanders, in honour of successive kings of Norway and other important figures. Powell here brought to bear his knowledge of Scandinavian history. These poems were used as authorities by the early historians of Norway (such as Snorri Sturluson); the introductions to the different sections, in the second volume of the <span class="italic">Corpus</span>, containing biographical information about the poets, formed the only original work in English on this portion of Scandinavian history at that time. It is hardly possible to describe the extraordinary variety of contents in the editorial part of the two volumes&#151;essays on mythology and points of literary history. They show an unsurpassed breadth of imagination, even if they are too unreliable to form any foundation for subsequent scholarship.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Corpus poeticum boreale</span> at once made Powell's name as a northern scholar and was intended to be the prelude to an even more ambitious work. In August 1884 he spent a fortnight with Vigf&uacute;sson in Copenhagen examining Icelandic manuscripts, with the aim of producing an edition and translation of the classics of northern prose, a proposal for which had been submitted to the Clarendon Press. The work advanced steadily and most of the <span class="italic">Origines Islandic&aelig;</span> was already in proof when Vigf&uacute;sson died in 1889. So long as Vigf&uacute;sson was alive Powell was kept steadily working at his Scandinavian task, but with the loss of his friend and associate his study was no longer directed and he gave himself up to miscellaneous reading; &#145;he missed the double harness in which he had pulled so long&#146;  (Elton, 1.106). The result was that the work was never concluded and was only published in 1905 after Powell's death. The Clarendon Press would only allow a list of corrigenda rather than the substantial revision which Craigie felt it needed; consequently it is unusable for serious scholarly purposes. Powell's procrastination was typical of the later period of his life&#151;projects were initiated but never brought to conclusion. The text of the prose sagas is substantially the work of Vigf&uacute;sson, &#145;the ordering, the English, and many of the literary criticisms, portraits, and parallels are Powell's&#146;  (Elton, 1.101). Powell seems to have deferred to the Icelander's fine, technical scholarship; but he did not check Vigf&uacute;sson's wilder speculations nor was he able to provide much philological method. The translation remains readable, if error prone, only occasionally lapsing into archaism; but the notes are &#145;littered with York Powell's inspired but deluded guesses&#146;  (Sutcliffe, 81).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1884, through the influence of Dean H. G. Liddell, Powell had been made a student of Christ Church. His official duties as law lecturer were to teach for the law school, to look after Indian Civil Service candidates, and to lecture on political economy for the pass school. His real and congenial avocations extended far beyond this narrow circuit. Besides his work on Scandinavian literature, he taught Old English, Old French, and even for a time Old German, for the Association for Education of Women in Oxford, took a leading share in founding the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span> (1885), and published a history of <span class="italic">England from the Earliest Times to the Death of Henry VII</span> (1885), designed for &#145;the middle forms of schools&#146;. A series of little books, <span class="italic">English History from Contemporary Writers</span>, was begun under his editorship in 1885.<br>
<br>Powell built for himself a contemporary reputation as one of the most profound scholars in medieval history and literature in England. When J. A. Froude died in 1894, and S. R. Gardiner, the prime minister's first choice, declined the chair, the regius professorship of modern history was conferred on Powell on the recommendation of Lord Rosebery (December 1894). Powell's scout identified the prime minister's letter as a tradesman's bill and put it aside for a while until enquiries from Downing Street brought it to light. The post was accepted with misgivings. Powell had no gift either for public lecturing or for organization. His inaugural lecture was only thirty minutes long and virtually inaudible. He was shy of an audience which he did not know, and although both in his inaugural lecture and upon subsequent occasions he pleaded for the scientific treatment of history, for the training of public archivists, and for the divorce of history and ethics, his practice differed from his theory; in his journalism he frequently relied on opinion and moral feeling rather than historical fact.<br>
<br>As professor of history, Powell was a disappointment. He made no special contribution to the advance of historical knowledge or method and failed to make any general impression upon the undergraduates as a teacher. Indeed, from the age of forty until the end of his life he published only two works: a translation of the <span class="italic">F&aelig;reyinga saga</span> (1896), dedicated jointly to H. G. Liddell, dean of Christ Church, and Henry Stone, an old fisherman at Sandgate; and a rendering of some quatrains from &#145;Umar Khayyam (1901). Powell was, however, the most generous as well as the most unambitious of men. His time was his friends' time, and the hours which might have been spent upon his own work were squandered on helping and advising others. Oliver Elton translated the first nine books of Saxo Grammaticus at his suggestion, and the bulk of the introduction was Powell's work. Again, as delegate of the Clarendon Press, an office which he held from 1885 until his death, Powell was able to render some service to the advancement of learning, though his procrastination and failure to answer letters hindered some projects; his interference with Q's editing of the <span class="italic">Oxford Book of English Verse</span> caused the other delegates considerable irritation.<br>
<br>As professor Powell regularly lectured in his rooms at Christ Church on the sources of English history, and on every Thursday evening was at home to undergraduates. In his pleasant rooms in the Meadow Buildings of Christ Church, with their stacks of books and Japanese prints, he would discourse freely on any subject which came up, from boxing and fencing to the latest Portuguese novel. His knowledge of foreign, especially of Romance, literature was singularly wide. A founder of the Rabelais Club, he had a rich fund of Rabelais stories which he recounted at its monthly dinners. He brought Verlaine to lecture in Oxford in 1891, and as a curator of the Taylor Institution (from 1887) procured an invitation to St&eacute;phane Mallarm&eacute; to give a lecture there on 28 February 1894. Powell found Mallarm&eacute; most congenial and translated his lecture into English in a single evening. The Belgian poet Verhaeren and the French sculptor Rodin were likewise at different times Powell's guests at Christ Church. He had also studied Old Irish, and was one of the presidents of the Irish Texts Society. On 7 April 1902 he lectured in Dublin to the Irish Literary Society on Irish influence in English literature, and in December of the same year went to Liverpool to speak for the endowment of Celtic studies in the university. Meanwhile, he learned Persian, had dabbled in Maori and Romani, and had assembled a valuable collection of Japanese prints. Robert Bridges described Powell's rooms as &#145;a veritable knick-knackatory of Japanese carvings, old Psalters, Parisian advertisements, etc. etc.&#146;  (Sutcliffe, 82). He wrote numerous reviews for the daily and weekly press, principally for the <span class="italic">Academy</span>, and after 1890 for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>.<br>
<br>The radical side of Powell's versatile nature is illustrated by the preface which he wrote to <span class="italic">A Penny Garland of Songs of Labour</span>, published in 1893 and written by his Oxford friend William Hines, chimney sweeper, herbalist, and radical agitator, and by the active share which he took in the foundation of Ruskin College, an institution devised to bring working men to Oxford. Powell presided over the inaugural meeting at the town hall on 22 February 1899, and acted from the first as a member of the council of the college. In religion Powell described himself as a &#145;decent heathen Aryan&#146;, in politics as &#145;a socialist and a jingo&#146;. He was an advocate of home rule, and of the South African War, and the first president of the Oxford Tariff Reform League. He was made an honorary LLD of Glasgow in 1901.<br>
<br>In 1874 Powell married Florence Batten, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Silke (<i>d</i>. 1888), a widow with two young daughters. Mrs Powell did not live in Oxford; for many years Powell spent the middle of the week during term time in Oxford and the weekend with his family in London. In January 1881 he moved from 6 Stamford Grove West, Upper Clapton, to Bedford Park, an aesthetic urban development in the Queen Anne style, popular with painters, actors, poets, and journalists. Here he resided until 1902; his only child, a daughter, Mariella, was born there in 1884. Four years later Powell's wife died. In the summer of 1894 he visited Ambleteuse on the coast of Normandy for the first time, and for the next ten years spent much of his summers there. In December 1902 Powell gave up his London house and settled in north Oxford with his daughter. The next year came warnings of heart trouble. He died on 8 May 1904 at his home, Staverton Grange, Banbury Road, Oxford. He was buried at Wolvercote cemetery, Oxford, without religious rites by his own desire; the delegates of the Clarendon Press processed from Walton Street to pay their respects. His large library was sold by Blackwells bookshop, which issued three special sale catalogues.<br>
<br>In appearance Powell resembled a sea captain. He was broad, burly, and bearded, brusque in manner, with dark hair and eyes, and a deep rich laugh, &#145;a big, untidy, generous man&#146;  (Starkie, 22). In the sphere of learning he is chiefly remembered for his services to northern literature, for his support of Vigf&uacute;sson, and for the general stimulus which he gave to the study of medieval literature in Great Britain, rather than for outstanding or lasting scholarship.<br>
