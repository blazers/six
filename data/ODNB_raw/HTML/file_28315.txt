<span class="headword">Vincent,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [T. V.]</span>  (1634&#150;1678), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born in May 1634 in Hertford (where he was baptized on 18 October), the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28310/', "John Vincent (1590/91&#150;1646)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28312/', "Vincent, Nathaniel")</script>]. The name of Vincent's mother is uncertain: John's widow Sarah petitioned in 1656 for repayment of loans that he had made to parliament but she may have been a second wife. His father was a puritan clergyman whose lack of conformity led to his being harried by the ecclesiastical authorities. Indeed, Thomas's childhood was unsettled, his father being &#145;so harrassed, and forc'd upon so many Removes for his Nonconformity&#146; that, Calamy claimed, Vincent and his many siblings were each born in different counties  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 1.30). Thomas's younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28312/', "Nathaniel Vincent")</script> became a Presbyterian minister.<br>
<br>Vincent was educated first at Westminster School, and then at Felsted School, Great Dunmow, Essex, the latter a strongly puritan institution under the mastership of Martin Holbeach. Admitted to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1648, he matriculated in February 1651, graduating BA in March 1652, and MA in June 1654. At this point, exceptionally for a junior member, he was elected catechist. He subsequently became chaplain to Robert Sidney, second earl of Leicester, and in 1656 was incorporated into the University of Cambridge. No surviving evidence indicates Vincent's formal ordination. In July 1657 he was nevertheless appointed rector by sequestration of St Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, London. Ejected in 1662 under the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, he assisted Thomas Doolittle for the next few years at his nonconformist academy in Bunhill Fields, continuing to preach privately and opportunistically. Vincent's address at this time is unknown; he was certainly living in Spitalfields in 1671&#150;2.<br>
<br>Upon the outbreak of the plague in 1665 Vincent was among a number of silenced nonconformists who emerged, as conforming ministers fled the city, to attend to the congregations they left behind. Vincent preached in churches throughout London and, undeterred by the risk of infection, ministered to the sick and dying in their homes. &#145;Void of all fear of death&#146;  (Neal, 451), he won interdenominational respect; his sermons also accumulated a multitudinous following, their peculiar intensity honed by the extreme circumstances. His printed meditation on the plague, <span class="italic">Gods Terrible Voice in the City</span> (1667), ran to sixteen editions within just eight years.<br>
<br>After 1665 Vincent preached more openly without licence, and was thus regarded with suspicion by the Restoration authorities. He had gathered together a congregation, for which a large meeting-house, seating 500, was built in 1669 in Hand Alley, off Bishopsgate Street. This meeting-house was allegedly among those seized by conformists who had lost their own churches to the fire of 1666; while Vincent reclaimed his premises, he remained subject to harassment and prosecution, and in 1672 was fined &pound;20 for preaching. He was nevertheless granted a licence under the declaration of indulgence in 1672, and ministered to a devoted congregation until his death. Throughout his final decade he published a number of writings, most notably the popular <span class="italic">Explicatory Catechism</span> (1673). While his works were predominantly doctrinal and devotional, he also published polemical challenges to William Penn and William Sherlock. Towards the end of his life he moved to Hoxton, Middlesex.<br>
<br>There are few extant details of Vincent's immediate family. At some point he married, and with his wife, Mary, who survived him, had at least four children. He died on 15 October 1678 in Hoxton, and was buried on 27 October at the church of St Giles Cripplegate. His funeral sermon, subsequently published, was preached by Samuel Slater. Vincent was apparently of comfortable means at the time of his death, leaving property and assets of unknown value to his family, and a number of monetary gifts to individual beneficiaries and the parish poor. While no visual likeness survives of him, a clear impression of his character and reputation emerges from the many eulogistic sketches of his life. A formidably eloquent and learned man, who reputedly knew the entire <span class="roman">New Testament</span> and <span class="roman">Psalms</span> by heart, Vincent was at once selfless and single-minded in his ministry, his &#145;Zeal and Diligence&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.95) unwavering in the face of both plague and persecution. He does indeed seem, as Slater states, to have been &#145;freely willing to venture his life for the salvation of souls&#146;  (Slater, 41).<br>
