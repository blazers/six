<span class="headword">Copland,  Patrick</span>  (1748&#150;1822), <span class="occ">natural philosopher and university teacher</span>, was born early in 1748 in the parish of Fintray, Aberdeenshire, and baptized there on 22 March 1748. He was the first of three children and the only son of Samuel Copland (<i>c</i>.1716&#150;1795), minister of the parish of Fintray, originally from nearby Tough, and his wife, Jean (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Copland), a distant relative from Aberdeen.<br>
<br>Copland entered Marischal College, Aberdeen, with a minor bursary in 1762. There he was taught natural philosophy by George Skene and moral philosophy by James Beattie; both were members of the philosophical society of Aberdeen that was responsible for the common-sense school of philosophy. After graduating AM in 1766, Copland went back home to pursue natural philosophy, in particular mechanical science. In 1774 he was asked by Skene to return as his assistant. Skene resigned six months later, and on 25 February 1775 Copland was appointed regent and professor of philosophy at Marischal College. He remained a professor there until a month before his death in 1822; though from 1779 until 1817 he held the title of professor of mathematics.<br>
<br>Professor Copland was a tall, handsome man, and when young was regarded as the principal beau in Aberdeen. Nevertheless, he remained a bachelor until he was thirty-nine. On 27 September 1787 he married Elizabeth Ogilvie (1767&#150;1852), almost twenty years his junior, the eldest daughter of Dr David Ogilvie, a surgeon in the Royal Navy. The Coplands had three sons: Alexander (<i>b</i>. 1788), John (<i>b</i>. 1789), and Charles (<i>b</i>. 1791), followed eight years later by Mary (<i>b</i>. 1799), who married Dr Alexander Murchison in 1821. In 1803 Copland purchased Fountainhall House, Aberdeen, from the estate of George Skene. Copland was a mild and unassuming man. He had a taste for pictures, a love of the theatre, and an ear for music that led him to build his own large pipe organ in 1789. Above all, he was devoted to natural philosophy. For services to Marischal College he was awarded an honorary LLD in 1817.<br>
<br>Copland introduced into university education the large-scale use of demonstration apparatus in teaching natural philosophy, a trend that lasted for almost 200 years. He gave extensive education to tradesmen, especially in mechanics, and he acted as an academic consultant to the municipality, to industrial contacts, and to members of the aristocracy. In 1782 he was elected a corresponding member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. In 1785 he was one of the non-resident founding members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1807 was elected a member of the Linnean Society. These interests remained peripheral: Copland was exceptional for specializing in mechanical science. He built up in the college his own workshop, which he equipped with lathes and many hand tools, including taps and dies by Ramsden, whom he knew personally. There Copland himself made to a high professional standard a great many pieces of demonstration equipment in wood and metals. Just before his death his collection and his tools were sold to Marischal College, and a number of items survive there. In 1783 Copland obtained a grant to employ a mechanic, John King, to make models of machinery; he may be the earliest university technician in the country. King stayed at Marischal for about eight years before returning to clock making.<br>
<br>Copland was acknowledged to be the best teacher in the university in his day. About 2000 students benefited from his lectures, which were planned around his exceptional collection of demonstration equipment covering almost all of the disciplines within natural philosophy. Among his students was James Stephen, grandfather of Leslie Stephen, the founder of the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. Copland's demonstration equipment was also the basis for his extramural adult education classes. These preceded by many years and were deeper in content than those of better-known &#145;pioneers&#146; such as George Birkbeck and others who promoted the rise of mechanics institutions in the 1820s. Copland's classes began in 1785 and continued for twenty-eight years, being given approximately biennially. Each course consisted of about eighty lectures of one and a half to two hours. The success of these efforts to educate tradesmen has been considered a significant influence in the founding of London's Royal Institution in 1800. Partly for this initiative and partly for his consultative work he received a royal pension in 1803.<br>
<br>Copland raised a public subscription in 1780 to construct the first publicly funded astronomical observatory in Scotland equipped with modern instruments. The observatory was situated on the Castlehill, near Marischal College, and was furnished with instruments by Dollond, Ramsden, and Troughton. Copland excited popular imagination when at the observatory site he released hydrogen balloons as early as March 1784. With John King he constructed to an unusual design by James Ferguson an elaborate astronomical clock, which survives at the university. He appointed as assistant keeper Andrew Mackay, who became a notable teacher and writer on navigation.<br>
<br>Copland's interests in applied natural philosophy led him to become an early example of what would now be called a consultant physicist. He advised the town on obtaining improved fresh water supplies, and in 1804 put forward proposals for what would have been one of the very first municipal sand and gravel slow filtration beds, had it been implemented. He also gave advice on standards of length, weight, and volume measure, and made accurate comparative determinations for them. He advised town and county on matters of surveying, and made the earliest measurements of the height of the Deeside hills by barometric means. He probably introduced the process of liquid chlorine bleaching into Britain. After seeing the process demonstrated by Saussure in his laboratory in Geneva in May 1787, Copland explained it to Aberdeen industrial chemists. They developed the process into a commercially viable technique, which prevented the grant of a restrictive patent to a Liverpool company in 1788 and thereby aided the spread of modern bleaching methods.<br>
<br>Copland achieved a national reputation. Although he left no scientific papers or patents as tangible records of his work, in his own way he influenced many contemporaries through his actions and his teaching. He died on 10 November 1822 at his home, Fountainhall House, from a large growth, probably throat cancer. He was buried in St Nicholas's churchyard, Aberdeen, on 20 November.<br>
