<span class="headword">Killen,  James Bryce</span>  (1845&#150;1916), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist and journalist</span>, was born in Kells, co. Antrim, the fourth son of Samuel Killen and Mabel Shaw. He took a BA in 1863 at the Queen's University in Ireland, though it is not clear whether this was at Belfast, Cork, or Galway. He went on to read logic, metaphysics, and political economy at the Queen's University in Ireland at Galway and gained a poor MA in 1868. He was admitted to the King's Inns, Dublin, in 1865, and in 1869 he gained a first-class LLB at the Queen's University in Ireland at Galway.<br>
<br>Killen was on three occasions in trouble with the authorities. In May 1869 he addressed the Queen's College, Belfast, Literary and Scientific Society on &#145;The spirit of Irish history&#146;. He concluded that England could not rule Ireland because it had no idea of the concept of nationality, and the fact of union divided the two nations even more deeply. His speech precipitated a question in parliament by R. Peel Dawson, Conservative MP for Londonderry County, who accused Killen of &#145;very questionable expressions&#146; and invited the authorities to prosecute him. There had been fears that the literary and scientific societies at both Belfast and Galway were being used by extremists, but in the case of Killen both the college council and the chief secretary for Ireland, Chichester Fortescue, decided to take no action.<br>
<br>Killen was briefly editor of the <span class="italic">Northern Star</span>, a short-lived Belfast liberal Catholic newspaper founded in 1868, which was thought to hold &#145;advanced views&#146;. By the opening of the land war he had become a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and with Michael Davitt and James Daly he was one of the founding members of the Land League. In November 1879 he was arrested with Davitt and Daly for making seditious speeches at a land meeting at Gurteen, co. Sligo. In his speech Killen hoped that those present were armed with rifles and that &#145;the days of namby-pamby speaking were over&#146;. The prosecution received enormous publicity, both in Ireland and abroad. However, the accused were released and the case was abandoned in January 1880.<br>
<br>Killen was temporarily editor of <span class="italic">United Ireland</span> after the arrests of William O'Brien and Edward O'Donovan in 1881. Killen himself was arrested in November 1881 and sent to Dundalk gaol on suspicion of inciting refusal to pay rent. Of his arrest <span class="italic">The Nation</span> commented that the warrants had said that these arbitrary arrests and imprisonment were intended to be used for<blockquote>certain &#145;dissolute ruffians and blackguards&#146; whom it was impossible to make amenable to &#145;the ordinary law&#146;; but not even by the wildest stretch of imagination can any one consider such a man as &hellip; Mr Killen &hellip; either a ruffian or a blackguard. (<span class="italic">The Nation</span>, 3 Dec 1881)</blockquote>Killen frequently appeared as counsel to defendants prosecuted during the land war. He went to America some time in the 1890s and contributed to nationalist newspapers both in Ireland and America. He died in poverty in a Dublin lodging house on 26 December 1916. His obituary in the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span> spoke of his knowledge of the early stages of the land agitation as &#145;unrivalled, and his descriptions of scenes and personages of the time &hellip; intensely entertaining&#146;. He wrote a number of pamphlets, including <span class="italic">The Incompatibles: &#145;Sister&#146; England and the Irish Cinderella</span> (1882) and <span class="italic">A Sketch of Irish History</span> (1886), which includes the text of &#145;The spirit of Irish history&#146;.<br>
