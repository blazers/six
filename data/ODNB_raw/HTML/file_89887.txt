<span class="headword">Greenhill,  Basil Jack</span>  (1920&#150;2003), <span class="occ">diplomatist, maritime historian, and museum director</span>, was born on 26 February 1920 at 169 Moorland Road, Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, the only child of Basil Jack Greenhill, insurance salesman, and his wife, Edith, formerly Mitchell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Holmes. He was educated at Bristol grammar school and the University of Bristol, where he was a T. H. Green scholar. In 1941 he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, but with his eyesight precluding him from active service he was involved with the direction of air operations. In 1944&#150;5 he was on the staff of the director of naval air radio.<br>
<br>Demobilized with the rank of lieutenant, in 1946 Greenhill joined the Dominions Office. Marked out for rapid promotion, he served as private secretary to the parliamentary under-secretary of state and then to the permanent under-secretary in 1948, before being posted as first secretary at the high commission in Pakistan from 1950 to 1954, serving in Dacca, Peshawar, and Karachi. In the latter year he was part of the UK delegation to the general assembly of the United Nations in New York. After two years' secondment to the foreign service as first secretary in Tokyo, 1955&#150;7, he was UK delegate to the Conference on the Law of the Sea at Geneva in 1958. Then followed postings as deputy high commissioner in East Pakistan (1958&#150;9); assistant secretary at the Commonwealth Relations Office (1959&#150;61); counsellor and head of chancery in Ottawa (1961&#150;4); and finally head of the west African department in the Commonwealth Office (1965&#150;6).<br>
<br>On 29 July 1950 Greenhill married Gillian Stratton, eldest daughter of Captain Ralph Tyzacke Stratton, army officer. She died in East Pakistan in 1959, leaving him with a young son. On 2 June 1961 Greenhill married (May Elizabeth) Ann Giffard, artist, and daughter of Walter Ernest Giffard, farmer; they also had one son.<br>
<br>Greenhill's boyhood love of the sea and of sailing ships had developed during his diplomatic career into a parallel occupation as maritime historian. His two-volume work, <span class="italic">The Merchant Schooners</span> (1951 and 1957), was widely acclaimed, and among his other publications were an edition of W. J. Slade's <span class="italic">Out of Appledore</span> (1959) and <span class="italic">Sailing for a Living</span> (1962). When in 1966 the directorship of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, became vacant, he applied, was duly appointed, and so resigned from the Commonwealth Office, being made CMG on his retirement.<br>
<br>Greenhill arrived at the museum in 1967 with a new broom to bring it into the latter half of the twentieth century. Dusty showcases, containing dated and poorly labelled exhibits, were refurbished to become more appealing to the eyes of visitors. One of his proudest achievements was the creation of a polar gallery in the museum basement, where were displayed much clothing and equipment from nineteenth-century Arctic expeditions, including that of 1875&#150;6 in which Rear-Admiral George A. Giffard, his wife's uncle, had taken part as a young lieutenant. (Among special lectures in the painted hall that Greenhill arranged was one on the British Arctic expedition of 1875&#150;6.) The gallery's most famous exhibit for a number of years was Sir Ernest Shackleton's ship's boat, <i>James Caird</i>, later housed at Dulwich College. As a further example of Greenhill's eclectic interests and initiatives, in 1974 he invited from Norway Major Tryggve Gran, the last surviving officer of Captain Scott's last expedition, to give a lecture at the museum. Gran, then aged eighty-five, held a rapt audience for two hours. Greenhill then arranged for Gran's journal to be translated and edited for publication as <span class="italic">The Norwegian with Scott</span> (1984).<br>
<br>Greenhill ran a tight ship at the museum for sixteen years, and was a hard man to serve. He expected his senior staff to produce research books and papers, just as he did over the years&#151;his message was to publish or perish. Among his publications in this period were <span class="italic">Westcountrymen in Prince Edward's Isle</span> (1967, with Ann Giffard), <span class="italic">Boats and Boatmen of Pakistan</span> (1971), and <span class="italic">The British Seafarer</span> (1980, with Michael Mason, also a BBC radio series). He was held in high respect by all his staff, but with little real affection. His stock internationally was such that he was elected first president of the International Congress of Maritime Museums (1975&#150;81). He was also chairman of the National Museum Directors' Conference from 1980 to 1983, the year in which he retired. He had been made CB in 1981, but must be considered unlucky not to have been knighted on his retirement. Budgetary restrictions shortly afterwards forced his successor to dismantle the polar gallery, and Greenhill never entered the museum again.<br>
<br>On his retirement Greenhill and his wife rented a small National Trust farmhouse at St Dominic, near Saltash, Cornwall, while retaining their house in London for a time. Both were accomplished maritime historians, and collaborated on a number of books. In 1980 Greenhill was awarded a PhD by the University of Bristol for further research. He continued to produce a stream of naval or maritime books until 1997, by which time he had published (either solely or jointly) more than forty books. In 1981 a new project claimed much of his time and driving force when, through the munificence of the British businessman Jack Hayward, the SS <i>Great Britain</i> was brought back to her home port of Bristol to be conserved in dry dock in the Great Western Dockyard. She had been launched in 1843 as the first iron-hulled, ocean-going steamship to Brunel's design, but after being dismasted while sailing around Cape Horn in 1886 had lain stranded in Stanley harbour, Falkland Islands, where she was used for storage. From fragmentary evidence, Greenhill's expertise allowed him to deduce how the ship's masts must have been rigged. From 1982 to 1992 he was chairman of the SS <i>Great Britain</i> project, and from 1992 vice-president. He was also chairman of the Centre for Maritime Historical Studies at the University of Exeter, 1991&#150;8, and at one time or another held other prestigious appointments such as membership of the Ancient Monuments Board for England (1972&#150;84). He was a tireless and talented lecturer, travelling widely to plug the campaign of the moment. During his long career several fellowships and honorary doctorates came his way.<br>
<br>Greenhill died at his home, West Boetheric Farm House, St Dominic, on 8 April 2003, of cancer of the prostate. He was remembered as an austere person dedicated to his profession and to his writing, and a loyal friend to those he respected or admired. He was survived by his second wife and by the two sons of his two marriages. Following his death, his widow, Ann, organized a commemoration and celebration of his life, held aboard SS <i>Great Britain</i> on 25 September 2003.<br>
