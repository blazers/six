<span class="headword">Forster,  Mark  Arnold-</span>  (1920&#150;1981), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born on 16 April 1920 at Cheriton Nursing Home, Westlecott Road, Swindon, the only son of William Edward Arnold-Forster (1886&#150;1951), painter, publicist, and gardener, and his wife Katharine (Ka) Laird, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cox (1887&#150;1938). Though nothing in his low-keyed adult manner was to advertise it, his parents' families included leading politicians and writers, among them Matthew Arnold and W. E. Forster; his mother had been close to Rupert Brooke and his group as well as to Virginia Woolf. Shortly after his birth his parents went to live in a picturesque Cornish house, Eagle's Nest, Zennor, Cornwall. Seared by their experiences in the First World War, they saw a paramount need for international understanding; they therefore placed their son, aged seven, in a boarding-school in French Switzerland, and at nine in Kurt Hahn's school at Salem in Germany. When Hitler's coming to power in 1933 drove Hahn into exile, Arnold-Forster was one of two British boys who followed the headmaster to a new school in Scotland at Gordonstoun, Moray, and he stayed on until 1937. This upbringing made him fluent in French and German; Hahn's stress on hard living and ethical aspiration rather than on academic achievement meant that he had to cram at a technical college to win a place in mechanical engineering at Trinity Hall, Cambridge (which he never took up), but it also prepared him for the war just ahead.<br>
<br>After a year's apprenticeship (1938&#150;9) with the Blue Funnel Line, involving a voyage to Manchuria, Arnold-Forster went into the Royal Navy. He served on a destroyer on the Murmansk convoy and then (1942&#150;4) on motor torpedo boats in the channel; ultimately a lieutenant in command of a flotilla, he won the DSO, DSC, and three mentions in dispatches&#151;awards essentially for leadership, earned by a very young man who at the time looked about sixteen. His tasks included engaging the <i>Scharnhorst</i>, <i>Gneisenau</i>, and <i>Prinz Eugen</i> and their enemy boat escort; torpedoing a tanker; limping home from a battle with a broken-down engine and enemy boats for a time (as he radioed) &#145;still in company&#146;; being nearly rammed by a German destroyer; laying mines under fire off the French coast; and working for naval intelligence. These experiences shaped his personality. The humorously understated wartime manner clung to him; to experience his kindness and sense of responsibility in peacetime&#151;a later colleague wrote&#151;made one &#145;understand why he was a great commander in war&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 28 Dec 1981). As a reservist (holder of a seagoing mate's ticket and an inland waters captain's ticket) he was, for a few months in the mid-1950s, to undertake &#145;special duties&#146; in the Mediterranean. Did his wartime experiences somehow burn him out, not then but after a lapse of years? His own view was that he enjoyed the war, especially its absurd side, and learned the need for prudence and self-control.<br>
<br>After an awkward interlude spent lecturing to German prisoners of war, Arnold-Forster in 1946 joined the editorial staff of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, then about to add to its international prestige a growing circulation in London and the south such as to make it by the 1960s a national newspaper. He worked first in Manchester and then in Germany, where he wrote sensitively about the miseries of the immediate post-war period and about the Berlin blockade; the well-researched account of the blockade which he wrote much later  (<span class="italic">The Siege of Berlin</span>, 1979) shows his respect for the Social Democratic and Christian Democratic leaders who did much to uphold morale. In 1949 he became labour correspondent, a key job he did for eight years, at a time when trade unions were an estate of the realm as well as a pillar of the Labour Party; in 1955&#150;7 he doubled this with deputizing for the London editor, in charge of the small office where most of the specialist writers and the few London reporters worked, covering what on other papers required large staffs.<br>
<br>This was Arnold-Forster's finest period as a journalist. His coverage not only of industrial disputes but of the Bevanite split in the Labour Party showed enterprise, knowledge, and insight; his distrust of the Bevanites (anyhow less than that of the editor, A. P. Wadsworth) hardly showed in his sober reports. Colleagues held him in deep respect and affection as a man of utter integrity, personal and professional, considerate, soft-spoken, yet determined to get the best out of himself and others. His personality was bound up with a physique slight but wiry, high forehead, pointed chin and nose, subdued colouring; he looked almost as if he had been pressed between the pages of a book. He dressed anyhow; new clothes looked rumpled as soon as he put them on. On 12 January 1955 he married Valentine Harriet Isabella Digne Mitchison (<i>b</i>. 1930), also a journalist, daughter of the Labour politician G. R. Mitchison and the novelist Naomi Mitchison. Both were descended from the &#145;intellectual aristocracy&#146;  (Annan, 269) and kin to successive secretaries of state for war, H. O. Arnold-Forster and R. B. Haldane. They had five children; their house, large and much lived-in, was a place of hospitality and warmth.<br>
<br>Many colleagues thought Arnold-Forster a potentially ideal editor of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, but when the editorship fell vacant in 1956 it went to his exact contemporary Alastair Hetherington. Partly because of this, Arnold-Forster agreed to join the then new Independent Television News as deputy to the editor, Geoffrey Cox; more impelling reasons were his interest in the new medium and, with a growing family, a need for more money. Cox, however, wanted Ian Trethowan (not at once available) and sacked his deputy after a year. Arnold-Forster then worked for <span class="italic">The Observer</span> as chief reporter, later as news editor and political correspondent. He won some scoops (one, characteristically, because the Liberal leader Jo Grimond liked him and said more than he had intended) but disliked the weekly rhythm of production; he raged when he correctly forecast Lord Home as the next leader of the Conservative Party and the editor, David Astor, inserted R. A. Butler's name instead. In 1963 he and Astor agreed to part.<br>
<br>After an anxious, uncertain period Hetherington offered Arnold-Forster a way back to the <span class="italic">Guardian</span> as chief leader writer, later as diplomatic editor. Here, as on <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, Arnold-Forster did serious investigative work, particularly on defence and on the European Economic Community. He was &#145;a thorn in the flesh of the Foreign Office&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 28 Dec 1981); though not ultimately opposed to Britain's joining &#145;Europe&#146;, he concentrated, like many others, on the detailed absurdities he uncovered in the common agricultural policy and in Brussels directives, and easily gave the impression of niggling rather than of having made a fundamental choice. He took time off to write <span class="italic">The World at War</span> (1973), a lucid account of the Second World War to accompany the award-winning television series; it became a best-seller. When Hetherington retired in 1975, Arnold-Forster, though aware that he might be thought too old for the editorship, was hurt not to be consulted, let alone considered. This sidelining, which grew under the next editor, Peter Preston, probably contributed to the persistent ill health which he suffered in his fifties, a series of minor strokes in particular. In 1979 he developed cancer of the upper colon; he died of it at his home, 50 Clarendon Road, Notting Hill, London, on Christmas day 1981, and was cremated at West London crematorium on 5 January 1982.<br>
