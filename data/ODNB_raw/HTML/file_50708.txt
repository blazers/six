<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Scott, Sir  Terence Charles Stuart  Morrison-</span>  (1908&#150;1991), <span class="occ">zoologist and museum director</span>, was born on 24 October 1908 in Paris, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Charles Stuart Morrison-Scott (<i>d</i>. 1938), barrister, and his wife, Amy A. Mosselmans. After Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, he entered the Royal College of Science, London, in 1931 to study zoology, where he graduated BSc with first-class honours in 1935 and proceeded MSc in 1939. For a short while he researched bird behaviour at London Zoo, and he was briefly an assistant master at Eton. He married on 19 December 1935 Rita Layton (<i>b</i>. 1905), daughter of Edwin James Layton; they had no children.<br>
<br>On 1 October 1936 Morrison-Scott was appointed to the scientific staff of the British Museum (Natural History), as assistant keeper (second class), and assigned to the mammal room. His scientific papers of 1937&#150;9 reported on his work at the zoo, and subsequent studies on material in the museum's mammal collections. In pursuit of a detailed investigation of elephant molars, in March 1938 he visited the Zoological Museum, Berlin, where he measured some sixty African elephant skulls; he also observed curatorial and exhibition techniques there and at the Hamburg Museum.<br>
<br>With the outbreak of war, as an officer of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, Morrison-Scott was called up on 6 October 1939. After leading a mixed fleet of private yachts hurriedly mustered to protect the Solent, he served two years as signals officer at Dartmouth. In 1944, with the rank of lieutenant-commander, he was given command of the 12th flotilla of tank landing craft. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for gallantry during the invasion of Normandy.<br>
<br>In September 1945 the director of the British Museum (Natural History) made an urgent plea to the Admiralty for the return of Morrison-Scott to take charge of the mammal galleries. He was released on 24 December, initially as assistant keeper (first class), but was promoted to senior scientific officer on 1 January 1948 and to principal scientific officer on 1 November 1948. He became an active member of the Scientific Officers' Association, formed in 1949. His scientific productivity was now channelled into preparing three definitive reference works in collaboration with Sir John Reeves Ellerman, bt: first, the massive <span class="italic">Checklist of Palaearctic and Indian Mammals</span> (1951, second edition 1966), then <span class="italic">Southern African Mammals: a Reclassification</span> (1953), which also involved R. W. Hayman, a colleague at the museum, and finally <span class="italic">Supplement to F. N. Chasen (1940): Handlist of Malaysian Mammals</span> (1955). This taxonomic research concentrated his attention on the need for stability in systematic names. At the 1958 London meeting of the International Congress of Zoology, the successful ratification of the definitive text of the <span class="italic">International Rules of Zoological Nomenclature</span> was attributed to his perseverance as chairman of the relevant section. All but one of his fifteen scientific papers from 1954 to 1965 (his last) were devoted to nomenclatural issues.<br>
<br>Elected to the council of the Zoological Society of London in 1947, Morrison-Scott served as honorary treasurer from 1950 until 1976. During these years he also became a trustee of the Imperial War Museum (1956&#150;60) and a governor of the Imperial College of Science and Technology (1956&#150;72). In 1952 he was awarded the degree of DSc (London).<br>
<br>In May 1956, after the death of Frank Sherwood Taylor, director of the Science Museum, Morrison-Scott was chosen to succeed him. He carried forward existing plans to develop the new centre block, and to enhance education facilities for children. He managed to retain substantial financial support from industry, but struggled with the parsimony of government funding. Finally, in 1960, the annual purchase grant (static since 1945) was raised from &pound;2000 to &pound;8000, but Morrison-Scott was frustrated in his wish to improve the status (and pay) of skilled craftsmen at the museum.<br>
<br>In 1960, on the retirement of Sir Gavin de Beer, Morrison-Scott returned to the British Museum (Natural History) as director on 1 May. Here he faced entrenched compartmentalism, with each departmental keeper defending his own fief. In addition he inherited a staff disciplinary problem which became protracted and public, ultimately being debated on four separate occasions in parliament. His decision to dismiss the scientist in question was endorsed by all ministers concerned, including three successive chancellors of the exchequer. He also managed the complex legislative and administrative process, culminating in the <span class="roman">British Museum Act</span> of 1963, which finally severed the outmoded historic connection with Bloomsbury.<br>
<br>In 1963, for the guidance of the museum's trustees, Morrison-Scott presented a policy paper on the functions of the British Museum (Natural History)&#151;he was adamant in retaining the name, which was later replaced by the name Natural History Museum. He recognized the significance of the museum's roles in education and exhibition, but placed greater weight on the science performed, unseen by the public. His highest priority was for new building to house the vast and increasing collections and to provide working space for staff and visitors. Over the next decade, this aspiration was progressively advanced. In 1965 he was knighted.<br>
<br>Initially the museum was in competition with the other national museums for Treasury funds allocated on the advice of the Museums and Galleries Commission. In 1966, however, Morrison-Scott obtained transfer to the Department of Education and Science, and comparability with the research councils. Thenceforward (until 1987) the council for scientific policy and its successors became the arbiter of the museum's objectives and the resources needed to achieve them. The construction of a new north-east tower within the South Kensington site was agreed (formally opened in 1973), as was the removal of the bird room to a purpose-built wing of the Rothschild Museum at Tring, Hertfordshire, completed in 1971. Thus, when Morrison-Scott retired at the end of November 1968, he had negotiated significant new resources for the attainment of the museum's scientific objectives.<br>
<br>A tall, handsome man, a natural leader and administrator, a lover of the classics, and a craftsman in stone (who learned lettering from David Gill), Morrison-Scott had been a successful oarsman at school and university, and he enjoyed sailing, skiing, shooting, and flying, achieving his solo licence in 1975. He was a deputy lieutenant for West Sussex, and was a fellow of the Zoological Society of London, the Linnean Society, and the Institute of Biology. In retirement he served on the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries (1973&#150;6), and as a National Trust council member (1968&#150;83).<br>
<br>Morrison-Scott died at his home, Upperfold House, Fernhurst, Sussex, near Haslemere, on 25 November 1991, and was cremated at Chichester crematorium; his wife survived him. A circular plaque in the cloisters of Chichester Cathedral records the restoration of one bay in his memory; so, too, does a plaque on the restored console table in the Stone Hall of Uppark, a National Trust property.<br>
