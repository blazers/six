<span class="headword">Samuel,  Walter Horace</span>, second Viscount Bearsted  (1882&#150;1948), <span class="occ">art collector and philanthropist</span>, was born on 13 March 1882 in London, the eldest child and only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35929/', "Marcus Samuel, first Viscount Bearsted (1853&#150;1927)")</script>, and his wife, Fanny Elizabeth Benjamin (1857&#150;1927). Educated at Eton College and at New College, Oxford, Walter Samuel's childhood coincided with the rapid expansion of his father's family trading business, M. Samuel &amp; Co., into the sale of petroleum. In 1904 he joined the staff of the Shell Transport and Trading Company (founded by his father and uncle in 1897), becoming a director in 1907 and succeeding his father as chairman in 1921, a post which he held until his own retirement in 1946. Samuel's marriage on 23 July 1908 to Dorothea 
    (Dorothy; 1882/3&#150;1949)
  , daughter of Edward Montefiore Micholls, gave him a family of three sons: Marcus Richard, subsequently third Viscount Bearsted (1909&#150;1986), Peter Montefiore, who became fourth Viscount Bearsted (1911&#150;1996), and Anthony Gerald (<i>b</i>. 1917). In the First World War, Samuel served with the West Kent yeomanry on the general staff, ending the war as a captain with the Military Cross. In the Second World War he served in the intelligence corps with the rank of colonel.<br>
<br>His position and great wealth gave Samuel the opportunity to pursue the interests for which he is best remembered: philanthropy and art collecting. An observant Jew of the United Synagogue, he supported many Jewish charities, including the Bearsted Memorial Hospital at Stoke Newington and the Bearsted maternity home at Hampton Court, both in London. He worked for the emigration of Jews from Nazi Germany in the 1930s and, although no Zionist himself, for a peaceful accommodation in Palestine. He was an art collector and public benefactor even before succeeding to his father's titles in 1927. The first viscount had financed a new wing for Maidstone Museum to house his son's Japanese collection, which reflected the family's oriental trading activities. Samuel had started collecting paintings by European old masters before the First World War and purchases, inspired by his fine eye and personal tastes, continued unabated until the year of his death, forming one of the most important collections of the century. In 1927 he acquired Upton House on Edge Hill in Warwickshire where he could indulge his passion for hunting. He transformed the house into a suitable setting for his growing collection, which included the original versions of <span class="italic">The Haymakers</span> and <span class="italic">The Reapers</span> (both 1783) by George Stubbs, El Greco's <span class="italic">Disrobing of Christ</span>, and <span class="italic">The Dormition of the Virgin</span> by Pieter Bruegel the elder; works by other masters such as Hogarth, George Romney, Giovanni di Paolo, Guardi, Steen, and Metsu also featured. Acquired individually, mainly through dealers and with the benefit of advice from such experts as Sir Alec Martin of Christies, the paintings chosen by Samuel also included masterpieces by lesser known artists. Combining his philanthropy with his love of art, in 1948 he gave this internationally important collection, together with Upton House, its fine garden, and a large endowment, to the National Trust.<br>
<br>Samuel was chairman of the trustees of the National Gallery, a trustee of the Tate Gallery, a major benefactor of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (with a donation of &pound;18,000 in 1938), and in the last years of his life chairman of the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London. Reserved and private in character, Samuel spoke in the House of Lords only on the subjects of petroleum and Jewish affairs. He died at Upton House on 8 November 1948.<br>
