<span class="headword">Stewart,  Andrew</span>, second Lord Ochiltree  (1521?&#150;1594?), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the second son of Andrew Stewart, third Lord Avondale, afterwards first Lord Ochiltree (<i>d</i>. 1548), and Margaret Hamilton, an illegitimate daughter of James Hamilton, first earl of Arran. A family pedigree of 1618 (BL, Harley MS 245) gives the date of his birth as 1521, but this account may not be entirely accurate. The family was descended from Murdoch Stewart, duke of Albany, grandson of King Robert II. By the time Andrew Stewart succeeded his father in 1548, his elder brother having already died, the family had moved its base from Lanarkshire into Ayrshire. His father exchanged the barony of Avondale with Sir James Hamilton of Finnart for that of Ochiltree in Ayrshire, the transaction being confirmed by the crown on 2 September 1534, and on 15 March 1543 was recognized as a lord of parliament with the title, Lord Stewart of Ochiltree.<br>
<br>The second Lord Ochiltree came to political prominence in the 1550s as one of the lords of the congregation, the political leaders of the movement for religious reform who also favoured alliance between Scotland and England. His family had been associated with religious protest since the 1530s; in 1533 his elder brother, Walter, was tried at Glasgow for heresy, and was accidentally drowned when crossing the River Calder on his way home&#151;presumably to Avondale Castle&#151;after his public recantation; and his cousin John Stewart, son of Henry, first Lord Methven, was also accused of holding heretical opinions. In 1556 Ochiltree invited John Knox to preach at his house during the reformer's visit to Ayrshire that year. The two men remained close friends. Ochiltree accompanied Knox to the palace of Holyroodhouse on the famous occasion in 1563 when her altercation with Knox so upset Queen Mary, while in 1564 Knox married Ochiltree's daughter Margaret as his second wife.<br>
<br>Ochiltree had earlier taken a prominent part in the events that led to confrontation between the queen regent, Mary of Guise, and the lords of the congregation. He joined the Ayrshire contingent under the earl of Glencairn that marched to Perth in May 1559 in support of the other leaders of the congregation and their preachers, and he subscribed the band of Perth (31 May 1559) for the mutual support of the congregation and the advancement of the reformed religion. He was a delegate to the queen regent on behalf of his party that summer, and he subscribed both the congregation's first letter to William Cecil (19 July) asking for English military help, and the letter to the regent of 19 September protesting against the fortification of Leith by French troops. On 10 February 1560 he endorsed the instructions to the congregation's commissioners who met the duke of Norfolk at Berwick to discuss English military assistance, and he subscribed the ratification of the subsequent contract drawn up at Berwick on 27 February. He was among those leaders who met the English army when it entered Scotland in April 1560 and he was a signatory to the so-called &#145;last band of Leith&#146; on 27 April, which promised to defend the reformed faith and, with English military help, expel the French from Scotland.<br>
<br>During Queen Mary's personal reign (1561&#150;7) Ochiltree was a staunch supporter of the reformed religious establishment. In January 1561 he voted for the adoption of the <span class="roman">Book of Discipline</span>, the blueprint for the structure and provision of the new church. He sat on the privy council in December 1561. On 4 September 1562 he was one of seventy-seven individuals who subscribed the band of Ayr in defence of the reformed faith, at a time when it was feared that Archbishop John Hamilton of St Andrews and others were organizing a Catholic backlash in the west. In 1565 he joined those, led by the earl of Moray, who rebelled briefly against the queen's marriage to Lord Darnley and with them was outlawed for some time, taking refuge in England. He returned to Scotland after the murder of the queen's Italian secretary David Riccio (9 March 1566) and with other pardoned noblemen attended the council at which the queen was advised to accept the fact of her secretary's death and make the most of the support of so many nobles. He attended the meetings of the council in June and July 1567, and was among those summoned to the general assembly of June 1567 to discuss the settlement of reformed worship and church order and provision for the ministers, subscribing the subsequent articles agreed.<br>
<br>Ochiltree attended James VI's coronation on 29 July 1567, and fought in the army of the king's party at Langside on 13 May 1568, when he was wounded by Lord Herries. He attended the convention of the estates held by Moray, now regent, at Perth in July 1569, and voted against the proposal of a divorce for Mary and Bothwell. He was a consistent supporter of Moray's regency, and in February 1570 attended the latter's burial in St Giles's, Edinburgh, after his assassination in January. Ochiltree continued to attend the privy council, but his involvement in public affairs in his later years was largely associated with the somewhat erratic careers of his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26481/', "James Stewart")</script>, made earl of Arran in 1581, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26517/', "Sir William Stewart of Monkton (c.1550&#150;1588)")</script>, who was killed by Francis Stewart, earl of Bothwell, James VI's cousin, in 1588. Lord Ochiltree persistently tried to bring Bothwell to justice, but without success. In 1592 he is said to have mediated in the feud between the earl of Huntly and the second earl of Moray at the request of the king, and to have made efforts to bring Huntly to justice for his murder of Moray at Donibristle that year.<br>
<br>Since the precise date of Ochiltree's death has not been verified, confusion has arisen as to whether it was he or his grandson and successor James, third Lord Ochiltree, who was involved in the subsequent vendetta against Huntly; it was probably the latter. Ochiltree was twice married. His first wife, whom he married before 27 March 1549, was Agnes, daughter of Sir John Cunningham of Caprington; they had five sons and three daughters: Andrew, master of Ochiltree (<i>d</i>. before 10 Sept 1578), James, earl of Arran, Sir William of Monkton, Henry of Barskimming, and Robert of Pittheveles, who obtained land in Ulster in 1609, Isabel, who married (as his second wife) Thomas Kennedy of Bargany, Margaret, who first, in 1564, married (as his second wife) John Knox, and second, in 1574, Sir Andrew Ker of Faldonside and Bethia. Ochiltree's second wife was Margaret Cunningham (<i>d</i>. 1574), widow of John Wallace of Craigie. He had a natural daughter Margaret who was legitimated on 31 March 1585. He was alive on 26 December 1593, and probably died at some time in the following year.<br>
