<span class="headword">Bosanquet,  James Whatman</span>  (1804&#150;1877), <span class="occ">banker and biblical historian</span>, was born on 10 January 1804, the second son of Samuel Bosanquet (1768&#150;1843), banker, and his wife, Laetitia Philippa (1774&#150;1855), daughter of James Whatman of Kent. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2930/', "Samuel Richard Bosanquet")</script> was his elder brother. The Bosanquets were a numerous Huguenot family descended through intermarriage from several ancestors who had fled the C&eacute;vennes region of France to avoid religious persecutions. Samuel's prosperity derived in part from his bank, founded in 1796 as Bosanquet, Beechroft, and Reeves, of Lombard Street, in the City of London, and although he owned various properties, he was well known as a philanthropist. His own children grew up in the lordly setting of Dingestow Court, Monmouthshire.<br>
<br>James Bosanquet entered Westminster School in 1814 and left in 1817. In 1822 he became a partner in his father's bank, then known as Bosanquet, Pitt, Anderson, and Franks. He subsequently became a governor of the Bank of England and chairman of the income tax commission under Sir Robert Peel, and his earlier publications related to these matters. They included <span class="italic">Metallic, Paper, and Credit Currency</span> (1842), as well as a <span class="italic">Letter to the Right Hon. G. Cornewall Lewis on the Bank Charter Act of 1844</span> (1857).<br>
<br>Bosanquet's other interest lay in biblical and Assyrian chronology, reflected in his later writings for the Society of Biblical Archaeology, to which he gave generous financial support, serving as a member of council and treasurer. His third wife and several close relatives were also members of this society. His <span class="italic">Chronology of the Times of Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah</span> appeared in 1848, and was followed by other works, on the fall of Nineveh, the prophecies of Daniel, and the dating of Assurbanipal and Lachish. Bosanquet was described by the president of the society as &#145;the Maecenas of Assyriology&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He was also a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and communicated his findings on solar eclipses in biblical times to the Astronomer Royal.<br>
<br>Bosanquet was married three times, first, on 16 May 1840, to Merelina (1815&#150;1852), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27464/', "Sir Nicholas Conyngham Tindal MP")</script>, in a major society wedding, the service being conducted by the bishop of London. The couple had five sons and three daughters. His second marriage, on 15 July 1854 to Frances Georgiana Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1817&#150;1862), elder daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47305/', "Lord John Thomas Henry Somerset")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26007/', "Somerset, FitzRoy James Henry, first Baron Raglan")</script>], was childless. His third marriage, on 25 August 1864, to Emily Dorothy, daughter of James Best of Kent, produced three daughters. They resided at Claysmore, Enfield, Middlesex, where he died of enteric fever and bronchitis on 22 December 1877.<br>
