<span class="headword">Patrick,  James McIntosh</span>  (1907&#150;1998), <span class="occ">painter and etcher</span>, was born on 4 February 1907 at 12 Muirfield Crescent, Dundee, the second son and youngest of four children of Andrew Graham Patrick (1864&#150;1951), architect, and his wife, Helen Moncur McIntosh, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Anderson (1866&#150;1953). He was educated at the Morgan Academy, Dundee (1912&#150;24), where he began drawing seriously and experimenting with etching before going to Glasgow School of Art (1924&#150;8). Owing to his precocity, he was admitted immediately into the second year of the four-year course, which he then followed with a year's postgraduate diploma study. He won many prizes at the college. These, coupled with work during the 1926 general strike, helped to finance a summer in Provence. The on-the-spot sketches made at this time became the source for an impressive group of etchings of Carcassonne, Avignon, N&icirc;mes, and other medieval hilltowns: <span class="italic">Les Baux</span> was exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, in 1928. The assured design and strength of draughtsmanship displayed in these works attracted attention, and by the time he left Glasgow Patrick had signed a contract with Harold Dickins, one of London's leading print dealers and publishers. The Proven&ccedil;al etchings, strongly influenced by Patrick's admiration for the Italian Quattrocento, were followed by a series based on the Scottish landscape, most notably the dramatic scenery of Glencoe, in which nature is depicted with awesome grandeur.<br>
<br>The etching market collapsed in 1929 with the Wall Street crash, and did not revive for half a century, so Patrick, like other young etchers of his generation&#151;such as Sutherland, Badmin, and Tunnicliffe&#151;was forced to seek alternative sources of income. He found a ready market for drawings of local landmarks, which were published in the <span class="italic">Dundee Courier</span>, and in 1930 became a part-time teacher at Dundee College of Art. He also turned to oil painting, and recycled some of his earlier subject matter by exhibiting <span class="italic">The Church of St Francis, Assisi</span> (National Gallery of South Africa) at the Royal Academy in 1931, his most ambitious work to date. Three years later the academy inexplicably rejected one of his finest early works, <span class="italic">The Pass of Glencoe</span> (1933&#150;4), as a result of which Harold Dickins introduced him to E. P. Dawbarn, managing director of the Fine Art Society in London's New Bond Street, who remained his principal dealers for the rest of his life. This first essay into Scottish landscape painting was followed by a successful series of the four seasons, each of which found a permanent home in a public gallery: <span class="italic">Winter in Angus</span>, painted in 1935, was purchased by the Chantrey Bequest for the Tate Gallery, followed by <span class="italic">Springtime in Eskdale</span> (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), <span class="italic">Midsummer in East Fife</span> (Aberdeen Art Gallery) and <span class="italic">Autumn in Kinordy</span> (McManus Gallery, Dundee). Although <span class="italic">The Pass of Glencoe</span>, a snow-bound and desolate scene, is starved of human life, the landscapes which followed were of a more pastoral nature and celebrated the impact that man had had on nature: the influence of Breughel was now mixed with that of the earlier Italians.<br>
<br>On 4 July 1933, with his reputation increasing and his income underpinned by part-time teaching, Patrick married Janet Rosalind Winifred Watterston (1904&#150;1983). They had two children: Andrew (<i>b</i>. 1935), who joined the Fine Art Society and later became its managing director and Ann (<i>b</i>. 1937), who became a painter. The steady flow of fine Scottish landscapes painted throughout the decade enabled Patrick in 1939 to purchase The Shrubbery, 67 Magdalen Yard Road, Dundee, a handsome Georgian house overlooking the Tay Bridge. The price was affordable because other potential buyers regarded the area as a prime target for German bombs. The house remained Patrick's home for the rest of his life, and from its windows he painted two of his most celebrated canvases: <span class="italic">A City Garden</span> (1939) and <span class="italic">The Tay Bridge from my Studio Window</span> (1948), both now in the McManus Gallery, Dundee. Called up in 1940, Patrick was trained initially as a tank driver before being commissioned in the camouflage corps, where his knowledge of the countryside was appreciated more than his artistic ability. He spent much time close to the fighting in north Africa and Italy, latterly at Capua, where he helped train other camouflage officers. Never employed as an official war artist, he was given no facilities for painting; sketchbook, pen, ink, and watercolour, rather than oils and canvas, became his constant companions, with the result that a new and direct naturalism superseded the studied studio painting of earlier years. One hundred of these watercolours&#151;depicting views in north Africa, Italy, Scotland, and Yorkshire&#151;were exhibited at the Fine Art Society in 1946, and well over half were sold.<br>
<br>In post-war Scotland Patrick resumed landscape painting, but his approach had changed dramatically; this, coupled with the visual stimulation of Glasgow's 1948 Van Gogh exhibition, confirmed his decision to paint out of doors. From then on, Patrick and his easel became a familiar sight in lanes and fields around Dundee. He was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1949, and a full member eight years later, but for much of the next thirty years he had to endure critical neglect, though Dundee University awarded him an honorary doctorate of laws in 1973. The public, however, remained sympathetic and in tune with his vision, as was handsomely borne out by his retrospective exhibition in 1987, mounted by Dundee Art Gallery to celebrate his eightieth birthday; this travelled to Aberdeen and Liverpool, attracting 100,000 visitors. Patrick's ninetieth birthday was marked by an equally popular exhibition, this time at the National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of arts by Abertay University in 1995 and created OBE in the 1997 new year honours list. He died at his home, The Shrubbery, on 7 April 1998 and was cremated eight days later: his ashes were scattered in the Carse of Gowrie, the subject of many of his paintings. He was survived by his son and daughter, his wife having predeceased him.<br>
