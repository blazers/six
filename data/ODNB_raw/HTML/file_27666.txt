<span class="headword">Trapp,  Joseph</span>  (1679&#150;1747), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was born at Cherrington, Gloucestershire, in November 1679, the second son of Joseph Trapp (1638&#150;1698), rector of Cherrington from 1662, and his wife, Elizabeth. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27665/', "John Trapp (1601&#150;1669)")</script>, a parliamentary chaplain. One of six surviving children he was baptized on 18 December 1679 at Cherrington. Educated at first by his father and later at New College School in Oxford, he matriculated on 14 July 1695 at Wadham College, Oxford, where he held a Goodridge exhibition from 1695 to 1700. Elected to a scholarship in 1696 he graduated BA on 22 April 1699 and MA on 19 May 1702. He became a fellow of Wadham in 1703. His early reputation was that of a minor poet: some Latin hexameters, <span class="italic">Fraus nummi Anglicani</span> (1696), appeared in the <span class="italic">Musae Anglicanae</span> (2.211), and his work was included in Oxford verse collections commemorating the duke of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1700) and William III (<i>d</i>. 1702). During this time Trapp developed a connection with the London theatre world; his anonymous <span class="italic">Prologue to the University of Oxford</span>, delivered at the Act in July 1703, was spoken by Thomas Betterton, and his Turkish tragedy, <span class="italic">Abramul&egrave;, or, Love and Empire</span>, which was first performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1704, secured lasting critical acclaim. In 1708 he became the first professor of poetry at Oxford and in 1709 he served as pro-proctor. His appointment to the poetry chair, which he held until 1718, gave &#145;great satisfaction [to] the whole university&#146;, according to Thomas Hearne, the diarist, who regarded him as &#145;a most ingenious honest gent. and every ways deserving&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 2.120). Opinion was divided on the merit of Trapp's lectures, which were mainly concerned with the classical poets, particularly those of Rome. Hearne thought that the first lecture, delivered in January 1711, displayed &#145;much conceit&#146; but others found Trapp's criticisms &#145;sound and clear&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 2nd ser., 11.194). The lectures were well attended and their original Latin text, <span class="italic">Praelectiones poeticae</span> (3 vols., 1711&#150;19), was reissued in translation, with additional notes, in 1742. However, Trapp's greatest literary endeavour, a translation into blank verse of the complete works of Virgil (1731), was less successful. Accurate but dull it deserved Dr Johnson's verdict that it &#145;may continue its existence as long as it is the clandestine refuge of schoolboys&#146;  (Johnson, 1.453), although the merit of its explanatory notes and critical observations brought the work to a fourth edition in 1737. Another epic undertaking, <span class="italic">Paradisus amissus Latine redditus</span>, published by Trapp at his own expense, in two volumes (1741&#150;4), proved a costly failure.<br>
<br>Among his contemporaries Trapp was noted less for his literary endeavours than as a political writer and as a churchman. From an early age he manifested combative high-church qualities inherited from his father, whose epitaph at Cherrington recorded him thus:<blockquote>
<div>schismaticis &hellip; insensus<br>
</div>
<div>Disciplinae fideique ecclesiae Anglicanae tenax.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 381)</blockquote>In 1701 he dedicated a flattering poem, <span class="italic">Aedes Badmintoniae</span>, to the high tory Henry Somerset, second duke of Beaufort, and at about the same time he became a friend of the high-church champion Dr Henry Sacheverell. This association endured for many years. Trapp acted as a manager for Sacheverell during his celebrated trial before the House of Lords in Westminster Hall in March 1710 and afterwards succeeded him in his lectureship in the parish of Newington, Surrey. Trapp used his talent as a pamphleteer on Sacheverell's behalf more than once with, for example, <span class="italic">An Ordinary Journey No Progress, or, A Man doing his Own Business No mover of Sedition</span> (1710) and <span class="italic">The case of the patron and rector of St Andrew's, Houlbourn, in answer to a pamphlet entitled, The case of the erectors of a chapel &hellip; in the said parish</span> (1722). When Sacheverell died, in 1724, Trapp inherited the greater part of his library, together with a legacy of &pound;200 and instructions to destroy most of his papers.<br>
<br>Trapp's polemical energies were frequently employed on behalf of the tory administration that came to power in 1710, following Sacheverell's trial. Pamphlets, such as <span class="italic">Most Faults on One Side</span> (1710) and <span class="italic">The True Genuine Tory-Address, and the True Genuine Whig-Address, Set Against one another</span> (1710), drew responses. As chaplain to the new lord chancellor of Ireland, Sir Constantine Phipps, the leading counsel for Dr Sacheverell at his trial, Trapp followed him to Dublin in 1711, where he generated controversy with a high-flying sermon on Restoration day, 29 May. In the same year he addressed a poem <span class="italic">To Mr Harley, on his First Appearing in Publick, after the Wound Given him by Guiscard</span>, and published a satirical pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Character and Principles of the Present Set of Whigs</span>. Although Swift thought this &#145;a very scurvy piece&#146;  (Swift, 269), it reached a third edition in 1712, by which time Swift was claiming credit for having secured the post of chaplain to Viscount Bolingbroke for Trapp, who was said to be &#145;mighty happy and thankfull for it&#146;  (ibid., 550). In 1713 Bolingbroke received the dedication of Trapp's poem <span class="italic">Peace</span>. This partisan celebration of the treaty of Utrecht served primarily as a vehicle for a collection of eulogistic portraits of the tory leaders; Swift thought it &#145;dull&#146;  (ibid., 650n.).<br>
<br>Trapp shared his party's disappointment at the accession of George I. He played a leading part in the tory counter-demonstration at Oxford on coronation day, 20 October 1714, when he presented Sir Constantine Phipps, his former patron, for the honorary degree of DCL, but afterwards concentrated on his ecclesiastical career. Having failed to become a lecturer in the high-church parish of St Clement Danes, London, in November 1712, he became lecturer of St Olave Jewry and of St Martin, Ironmonger Lane, in 1714, and lecturer of St Martin-in-the-Fields in 1715. He was presented by the earl of Peterborough to the rectory of Dauntsey, Wiltshire, in 1714, and exchanged this for the London parishes of Christ Church Greyfriars and St Leonard, Foster Lane, in 1722 on the presentation of the high tory governors of St Bartholomew's Hospital. He held this appointment until his death, in 1747, adding to it, in 1733, the rectory of Harlington, Middlesex, a living in the gift of Lord Bolingbroke.<br>
<br>Trapp was a devout and energetic minister. He officiated unfailingly at public daily prayers and was noted for his strict adherence to correct standards of clerical dress. As &#145;little Parson <i>Dapper</i>&#146; his accomplished pulpit manner earned him an honourable mention in <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>  (1.457) and he was frequently invited to preach on major occasions, such as before the lord mayor, the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy, and the charity schools of London and Westminster. He dedicated a tract, entitled <span class="italic">Duties of Private, Domestic, and Public Devotion</span>, to his parishioners at Dauntsey, and presented every member of his London congregations with a copy of <span class="italic">Thoughts upon the Four Last Things: Death, Judgment, Heaven, Hell, a Poem</span> (1734&#150;5; 3rd edn, 1749). In this latter work Trapp indicated the sense of urgency with which he had come to regard his pastoral vocation and commented: &#145;I have lived in six reigns, but for about twenty years past, the English nation has been so prodigiously debauched that I am almost a foreigner in my own country&#146;  (&#145;Advertisement&#146;). His epitaph included the arresting lines:<blockquote>
<div>Death! Judgment! Heaven! Hell! think, Christian, think!<br>
</div>
<div>You stand on vast Eternity's dread Brink!<br>
</div>
</blockquote>and concluded with the earnest hope that his flock might &#145;Hear me at least, oh! hear me from my grave&#146;. After his death a selection of Trapp's parochial sermons were published in a two-volume edition (1752), which afforded further evidence of his efforts to guard his flock against the enticements of both overt and concealed infidelity. Anxious in particular to repudiate deistical claims that a mere &#145;religion of Nature&#146; furnished a sufficient guide for conduct Trapp condemned the &#145;absurd presumption&#146; of &#145;our new <i>Philosophers</i>&#146;, whose &#145;short-sighted <i>Reason</i>&#146; blinded them to the &#145;Glory of God in his Works of Creation and Providence&#146;  (Trapp, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 1.xi&#150;xii). He also wrote sadly about those who &#145;make no other Use of Flowers, Herbs, Fruits and Animals, than to see, smell, and eat them; when, if due Reflection were made upon them, they would serve to the noblest Purposes of &hellip; Morality&#146;  (ibid., 266). In 1729 and 1730 he gave the lectures on Lady Moyer's foundation, published as <span class="italic">The Doctrine of the most Holy, and Ever-Blessed Trinity, Briefly Stated and Proved</span>, and his <span class="italic">Explanatory Notes upon the Four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles</span> (2 vols., 1747&#150;8) were reprinted in 1775 and 1805.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Trapp remained a strong high-churchman who exemplified all the characteristics of his party. Ever mindful of the experience of the church during the civil war, and the Commonwealth and protectorate that followed, he revered the memory of Charles I and deplored his &#145;most horrid Murder and Parricide&#146;  (Trapp, <span class="italic">Sermons</span>, 22). He sympathized with some of the nonjurors, particularly Roger Laurence, author of <span class="italic">Lay Baptism Invalid</span>, whom he presented at Oxford for an honorary MA in 1713  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 4.212). Believing that the Church of England was a divinely commissioned part of the church catholic Trapp repudiated the Erastian doctrines advanced by Benjamin Hoadly, bishop of Bangor, and noted pointedly that &#145;in the Primitive Church some of the most noted Heresiarchs were Bishops&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Real Nature of the Church or Kingdom of Christ</span>, 1717, 5). Using texts such as <span class="roman">Numbers</span> 16 and <span class="roman">Hebrews</span> 5: 4 he maintained a high notion of the divine authority of the regularly constituted ministry and lamented that the &#145;temporal condition of Spiritual Persons, and of their families &hellip; is, upon the whole, very hard and unequal&#146;. This he believed was a consequence of &#145;unconscionable pillage&#146; during the Reformation  (<span class="italic">The Dignity and Benefit of the Priesthood</span>, 1721, 28, 43). He regarded the dissenters, who had no regular ministerial succession, as dangerous schismatics and attacked plans to comprehend them within the Church of England as &#145;absurd&#146; and &#145;wicked&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Preservative Against Unsettled Notions, and Want of Principles in Religion</span>, 1715, xix). In the late 1730s, predictably, Trapp was deeply alarmed by the emergence of the Methodists, whom he likened to the Puritans of the 1640s. In his best-remembered work, <span class="italic">The Nature, Folly, Sin and Danger, of being Righteous over-much</span>, which went through four editions in 1739, Trapp attacked the mortifications practised by the followers of George Whitefield, who responded, along with others, including William Law and the anonymous author of the satirical <span class="italic">Dr Trapp Vindicated from the Imputation of being a Christian</span>. Trapp was undeterred and returned to the charge. In an assize sermon preached at Oxford, entitled <span class="italic">The Nature, Usefulness and Regulation of Religious Zeal</span> (1739), he glanced slightingly at Law: &#145;to eat nothing but bread and herbs, and drink nothing but water, unless there be a particular reason for it, is folly at best&#146;  (p. 7). This sermon was received with marked respect by the vice-chancellor, Dr Theophilus Leigh, who &#145;stood up all the time of his preaching &hellip; to manifest his high sense of so respectable a character&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 660). A further piece, <span class="italic">The true spirit of the Methodists and their allies (whether other enthusiasts, papists, deists, Quakers, or atheists) fully laid open</span> (1740), provided a comprehensive response to Trapp's antagonists, including Whitefield, who was accused of &#145;Quakerism, Enthusiastic Madness and Malice&#146;  (26), and Law, whose <span class="italic">Grounds and Reasons of Christian Regeneration</span> was dismissed as an &#145;Enthusiastical Rhapsody&#146;  (p. 38). In common with other high-churchmen Trapp was also a decided critic of the Roman Catholic church. He published <span class="italic">Popery Truly Stated, and Briefly Confuted</span> (1726; 3rd edn, 1745) in response to &#145;the late unusual Growth of Popery&#146;  (p. 2); it rehearsed familiar arguments in favour of private judgement, as guided by scripture, and against papal supremacy, novel doctrines, and superstitious practices. This work, together with <span class="italic">The Church of England defended against the calumnies and false reasonings of the church of Rome</span> (1727), a response to <span class="italic">England's Conversion and Reformation Compar'd</span> by the Catholic controversialist Robert Manning, secured for Trapp the degree of DD by diploma at Oxford in February 1728.<br>
<br>In person Trapp was &#145;of a middle stature, slender habit, olive complexion, and a countenance of uncommon openness and animation&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 383). The three-quarter-length portrait presented to the Bodleian Library in 1755 was considered an excellent likeness. He was naturally irascible but made efforts to control his temper when provoked, &#145;compressing his lips as he retired, like a true Christian philosopher&#146;. Although it was said that he &#145;studied harder than any man in England&#146; he could be diverted in convivial company; one memorialist recalled &#145;his giving us the good old song of <span class="italic">Celebrate this Festival &amp; c</span>, for which, even in an advanced age, he was not ill-qualified, by the possession of an agreeable tenor-base voice&#146;  (ibid., 384). He married, on 7 December 1714, &#145;Mrs White, a young Girl of about 18 years of age, Daughter of a Widdow in Oxford&#146;  (<span class="italic">Remarks</span>, 5.4), with whom he had two sons. The first, Henry, for whom Lord Bolingbroke stood godfather, died in infancy. The second, Joseph (<i>d</i>. 1769), became a fellow of New College, Oxford, in 1734 and rector of Stratfield Saye in Hampshire.<br>
<br>Trapp died at Harlington, of pleurisy, on 22 November 1747 and was buried in the parish church there, at the north side of the entry into the chancel, where he is commemorated by a monument. Another monument, engraved as the frontispiece to the second volume of his <span class="italic">Sermons</span> (1752), was erected on the east wall of the chancel of Christ Church Greyfriars and paid for by the parishioners.<br>
