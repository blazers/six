<span class="headword">Bowdler,  Henrietta Maria <span class="st"> [Harriet]</span></span>  (1750&#150;1830), <span class="occ">writer and literary editor</span>, was born in Conington, Huntingdonshire, the daughter of Thomas Bowdler (<i>bap</i>. 1719, <i>d</i>. 1785), and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74743/', "Elizabeth Stuart Bowdler, n&#233;e Cotton (d. 1797)")</script>. She was one of six children, all of whom were raised in Bath and educated by their literary mother; their father's carefully excised readings of Shakespeare in the evenings also had a considerable influence on the minds of the Bowdler children. Her siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3029/', "Jane Bowdler (1743&#150;1784)")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3031/', "John Bowdler (1746&#150;1823)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3032/', "Thomas Bowdler (1754&#150;1825)")</script>, the last of whom possessed, until late in the twentieth century, the entire credit (or blame) for the expurgation of Shakespeare that Henrietta Bowdler had in fact originated. <br>
<br>Henrietta Bowdler's first publication was her edition of her sister Jane's <span class="italic">Poems and Essays, by a Lady Lately Deceased</span> (1786). Jane's health had been ruined by bouts of measles and smallpox, and the volume was originally published for the benefit of the hospital at Bath. It was popular in the region, and had run into seventeen further editions by 1830. It was the <span class="italic">Sermons on the Doctrines and Duties of Christianity</span> (1801), however, which established Henrietta Bowdler's literary reputation. Beilby Porteus, bishop of London, &#145;was so struck with their merit&#146;, that, believing the volume to have been written by a clergyman, he &#145;offered through the publisher to confer a benefice on the author&#146;  (Gorton). This work passed through nearly fifty editions in almost as many years, and Henrietta Bowdler soon became something of a force in contemporary literary and religious circles: &#145;half the leaders of high-minded thought in England were in correspondence with her, and many had visited the salon she kept in Bath&#146;  (Perrin, 69). <br>
<br>Gilbert Elliot, earl of Minto, describes the young Henrietta Bowdler:<blockquote>She is, I believe, a blue-stocking, but what the colour of that part of her dress is must be mere conjecture, as you will easily believe when I tell you that &hellip; she said she never looked at [the dancers in operas] but always kept her eyes shut the whole time, and when I asked her why, she said it was so <i>indelicate</i> she could not bear to look. (Perrin, 69)</blockquote>It was this delicacy of mind that led Henrietta Bowdler to produce the work for which her brother assumed the credit, and for which she is known today, <span class="italic">The Family Shakespeare</span> (1807). Originally published at Bath in four volumes, it contained expurgated versions of twenty Shakespeare plays, from which the editor had &#145;endeavoured to remove every thing that could give just offence to the religious and virtuous mind&#146;  (&#145;Preface&#146;, <span class="italic">The Family Shakespeare</span>, 1807). Henrietta also cut scenes that she deemed trivial or uninteresting, but the excisions primarily consisted of sexual material, or those Roman Catholic references which a good protestant might find distasteful or disturbing. Thomas Bowdler, who later produced a fuller edition of his sister's expurgation in 1818, was in many ways more faithful to the original, restoring the unobjectionable scenes, and confining himself to sexual and religious allusions (although he detected many more of these than his sister had felt necessary to expunge). Henrietta Bowdler's edition of 1807 was published anonymously, but her brother had taken on the mantle of editorship by 1809: an unmarried woman of her stature and beliefs could hardly then acknowledge publicly that she knew enough about sexual impropriety to edit Shakespeare effectively. The later edition of the complete plays that he produced reinforced the notion that he had originated the idea. <br>
<br>Henrietta Bowdler turned to literary projects of other kinds. She edited the <span class="italic">Fragments in Prose and Verse by the Late Elizabeth Smith</span> (1810), and attached to it a memoir of Smith, an impressive scholar and translator with whom Henrietta Bowdler had shared a long-standing correspondence. The volume was popular in religious circles, and ran into several editions. Henrietta Bowdler has also been credited with the anonymously published <span class="italic">Creation</span> (1818). She later wrote a novel, <span class="italic">Pen Tamar, or, The History of an Old Maid</span> (1831), a work that while &#145;ostensibly defending both virtue and single women, &hellip; excuses the hero's prejudice against old maids with one hateful example and harshly penalizes him and the heroine for their filial obedience&#146;  (Blain, Clements &amp; Grundy, <span class="italic">Feminist comp.</span>). Henrietta Bowdler died at Bath on 25 February 1830. She never married. <br>
<br>Henrietta Bowdler's creation of <span class="italic">The Family Shakespeare</span> brought a more general movement of literary expurgation into play. It is true that her small provincial edition caused little immediate stir on its publication, and her brother's substantive ten-volume revision (retitled <span class="italic">The Family Shakspeare</span>) also passed largely without comment in 1818. But three years after this second edition appeared, a war of words concerning its merit between <span class="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</span> and the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> caused sales of <span class="italic">The Family Shakspeare</span> to soar, and the revised work passed into general circulation. The delicacy of mind that had in the late eighteenth century been an object of gentle ridicule from such as the earl of Minto found a more appreciative forum in a growing and varied nineteenth-century reading public, an audience for whom a certain responsibility was felt by the class to which the Bowdlers belonged. As Noel Perrin puts it: &#145;the gentleman, moved by <i>noblesse oblige</i>, kindly sets out to save his inferiors from temptation. <i>He</i> can be trusted to read <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, but a newly educated grocer will pick up bad ideas&#146;  (Perrin, 20). <span class="italic">The Family Shakspeare</span> ran into many editions and for generations influenced how Shakespeare was edited and read. By 1850 there were seven expurgated editions of Shakespeare on the market, and by 1900 that number had increased to fifty  (ibid., xiii). Although the verb that resulted from the Bowdler surname, along with all of its negative connotations, was linked to Thomas Bowdler alone for almost 150 years, it must also be associated with Henrietta Bowdler's literary legacy.<br>
