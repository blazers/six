<span class="headword">Bailey, Sir  Edward Battersby</span>  (1881&#150;1965), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born in Marsden, Kent, on 1 July 1881, the third of six sons of James Battersby Bailey, medical practitioner, and his wife, Louise Florence, daughter of Isaac Carr, a Cumberland farmer. Bailey was educated at Kendal grammar school and went by open scholarship from there to Clare College, Cambridge. He gained first-class honours in both parts one (1901) and two (1902, geology and physics) of the natural sciences tripos and gained the Harkness scholarship (1902).<br>
<br>Bailey joined the geological survey as a field geologist in 1902. His studies of igneous rocks in the Scottish lowlands soon identified him as a skilled interpreter of the composition and history of ancient volcanoes. He enjoyed writing, and with Charles Thomas Clough and H. B. Maufe he described the geological mapping of Glencoe, demonstrating the relics of a large sunken volcano, called a &#145;cauldron-subsidence&#146;, surrounded by ring fractures, some occupied by igneous rocks later termed &#145;ring-dykes&#146;. This fostered the recognition and study of ring-dykes elsewhere in the world. In 1910 came his revolutionary description of the general geological structure of the western Grampians as strata, some transported great distances, bent into recumbent folds of which the limbs were partly replaced by low-angled faults or slides. Bailey was uncertain of the depositional order of the strata within the folds but in 1930, after other workers had demonstrated the significance of current-bedding and graded bedding, he showed that the Ballachulish Slide was developed in the lower limb of a syncline. Later it was realized that the concept of recumbent folding applied to the whole of the Grampians.<br>
<br>In 1914 Bailey married Alice (<i>d</i>. 1956), daughter of David Meason of Kirkwall, and a sister of the wife of Sir John Flett; they later had a son and a daughter. The following year, Bailey's geological work was interrupted by the First World War; he served from 1915 to 1919 with the Royal Garrison Artillery. Wounded twice, losing his left eye and much use of his left arm, he was awarded the Military Cross and the French Croix de Guerre with palms. He was also made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur and he retired from the army with the rank of lieutenant.<br>
<br>Bailey's fertile brain was unaffected by his war wounds and in 1919 he was given charge of west highland fieldwork and he saw through the press the complex geological map of Mull (1923) which he had helped to construct and which depicts the results of two great cauldron-subsidences and of gravitational differentiation of Tertiary magma; also there are crater lakes, pillow lavas, and ring-dykes. During the mapping, in 1922, Bailey studied a very pure white sandstone by Loch Aline, on the mainland opposite Mull; this, he inferred, formed the desert shores of the same sea that deposited the chalk of the English Downs. In the Second World War, when normal shipments of optical glass from overseas ceased, the purity of the Loch Aline sands was recalled and they were extensively mined and used.<br>
<br>In 1930 Bailey took up his appointment as professor of geology at Glasgow University. Some of his lectures to his Glasgow undergraduates were incorporated into his <span class="italic">Introduction to Geology</span> (1939), written with his colleagues J. Weir and W. J. McCallien. His book <span class="italic">Tectonic Essays, Mainly Alpine</span> (1935), also written during his years in Glasgow, still proves good reading. Among his researches were inferences concerning ancient submarine earthquakes and the accompanying tidal waves affecting sedimentation. These led other workers subsequently to develop the concept of turbidity-currents of high density and their effects on present-day ocean configuration.<br>
<br>Bailey's stay in Glasgow ended in 1937 when he was offered the directorship of the geological survey and its newly sited museum at South Kensington. The war, which occupied six of the eight years of his directorate, caused a change in his plans for the survey; these are outlined in his book <span class="italic">Geological Survey of Great Britain</span> (1952), as are the activities of his staff, diverted from regional geological mapping to successful work on minerals associated with the war effort. The museum was evacuated and became the headquarters of London region civil defence; from 1940 to 1942 Bailey was lieutenant commanding the geological survey and London region section of the Home Guard. In 1943 he visited Malta to advise on water resources there. He also worked extensively on the production of the two sheets of the 10-mile-to-1-inch geological map of Great Britain, which, however, was not published until 1948, whereas he retired in 1945, the year in which he was knighted.<br>
<br>Following his retirement, in collaboration with McCallien, Bailey then started researches into the origin of associated serpentine, pillow lava, and radiolarian chert in Scotland, Turkey, and Italy. He also prepared a second edition of the <span class="italic">Geology of Ben Nevis and Glen Coe</span> (1960) and he wrote biographies of Sir Charles Lyell (1962) and of James Hutton (1967). Bailey's first wife died in 1956, and in December 1962 he married Mary M. W. Young, who survived him.<br>
<br>Bailey was a tallish man of excellent physique; he had gained a freshman's heavyweight boxing medal at Cambridge. Always a keen walker, he had spartan habits and a strong personality. Dedicated to his work, he inspired others but at times he was over-enthusiastic or even intolerant, thus antagonizing some. Honorary doctorates were given to him by the universities of Belfast, Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Harvard. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1930 and awarded a royal medal in 1943. A foreign member of the national academies of Belgium, India, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States, he was also an honorary member of many geological societies and received several prestigious medals, including the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society (1948). One of the best-known and most colourful geologists of his time, he died in the Royal Free Hospital, London, on 19 March 1965 and was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
