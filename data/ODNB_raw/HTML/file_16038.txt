<span class="headword">Langton,  Bennet</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1736, <em>d.</em> 1801), <span class="occ">friend of Samuel Johnson</span>, son of the Revd Bennet Langton (1696&#150;1769) and his wife, Diana, daughter of Edmund Turner of Stoke Rochford, Lincolnshire, and descendant of the old family of the Langtons of Langton, near Spilsby in Lincolnshire, was baptized at St Cuthbert's, York, on 11 January 1736. As a young man he was so interested by <span class="italic">The Rambler</span> (1750&#150;52) that he obtained an introduction to Johnson, who at once took a liking to him. On 7 July 1757 Langton matriculated from Trinity College, Oxford, where he became friendly with Topham Beauclerk. The two youths took Johnson for his famous &#145;frisk&#146; to Billingsgate. Johnson later visited the Langtons, and declined the offer of a good living from Langton's father. Langton took the degrees of MA in 1765 and DCL 1790. He was an original member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/49211', "Literary Club")</script> (about 1764). Johnson, however, was provoked to the laughter which echoed from Fleet Ditch to Temple Bar by Langton's will in 1773, and soon afterwards caused a quarrel, which apparently lasted for some months, by censuring Langton for introducing religious questions in a mixed company.<br>
<br>On 24 May 1770  (<span class="italic">Annual Register</span>, p. 180) Langton married Mary (1743&#150;1820), daughter of Gresham Lloyd, and widow of John Leslie, tenth earl of Rothes (1698&#150;1767), with whom he had four sons and five daughters. According to Johnson, he rather spoilt them  (Fanny D'Arblay, <span class="italic">Diary</span>). His eldest son, George (1772&#150;1819), succeeded him in his estate; Peregrine, the second, married Miss Massingberd of Gunby, and took her name. His second daughter, Jane (<i>b</i>. 1776), was Johnson's goddaughter. She died on 12 August 1854, having always worn a &#145;beautiful miniature&#146; of Johnson  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1854).<br>
<br>Langton became a captain, and ultimately major, in the Lincolnshire militia. Johnson visited him in camp at Warley Common in 1778, and in 1783 at Rochester, where Langton was quartered for some time. Johnson once requested Langton to tell him in what his life was faulty, and was greatly irritated when Langton brought him some texts enjoining mildness of speech. Johnson's permanent feeling, however, was expressed in the words, &#145;Sit anima mea cum Langtono&#146; (&#145;May my soul be with Langton&#146;; Boswell, 1282).<br>
<br>During Johnson's last illness Langton came to attend his friend; Johnson left him a book, and Langton undertook to pay an annuity to Francis Barber, Johnson's black servant, in consideration of a sum of &pound;750 left in his hands. Langton was famous for his Greek scholarship, but wrote nothing except some anecdotes about Johnson, published by Boswell in his <span class="italic">Life</span> under the year 1780. Johnson and Boswell frequently discussed Langton's incapacity for properly managing his estates. He was too indolent, it appears, to keep accounts, in spite of exhortations from his mentor. Langton was very tall and thin; his gentle and amiable nature made him universally popular. According to Sir William Jones, Langton's conservative political opinions made him &#145;vehement against the lovers of freedom in all countries&#146;, while Hester Thrale confirmed that Langton was &#145;a Tory and a high Churchman up to the Eyes&#146;  (Rogers, 222). He was appointed in April 1788 to succeed Johnson as professor of ancient literature at the Royal Academy. Langton died at Southampton on 18 December 1801.<br>
