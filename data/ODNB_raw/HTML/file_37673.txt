<span class="headword">Lewis,  Ted</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Kid Lewis, Ted Kid Lewis]</span>  (1894&#150;1970), <span class="occ">boxer</span>, was born Gershon Mendaloff at 56 Umberston Street, St George-in-the-East, Aldgate, London, on 28 October 1894, the third of eight children and eldest son of Harris Mendaloff (<i>d</i>. 1939), cabinet-maker, and his wife, Leah (<i>d</i>. 1938). He was educated at the Jewish Free School in Bell Lane, Spitalfields, and followed his father's trade. Shortly before his fifteenth birthday he began boxing professionally as Kid Lewis at the Judaean social and athletic club, Whitechapel, where he had nearly fifty contests, and when Premierland opened he boxed there thirty-five times in 1912. The largest boxing saloon in the East End, this was a Jewish institution for twenty years. In October 1913 he won the British featherweight championship at the national sporting club, and the European title four months later.<br>
<br>In 1914 an offer from Australia took Lewis and his trainer, Alec &#145;Zalig&#146; Goodman, to Sydney and five matches in three months, from where they sailed to the USA on business which lasted five years. It was here that &#145;Ted&#146; was added to his name. Boxing mostly on the east coast, Lewis had half his fights restricted by law to no-decision contests. He won the world welterweight championship in Boston in August 1915 from Jack Britton and lost the title to the same man eight months later. Lewis regained the title from the Irish-American in June 1917, and lost it back to him in March 1919. They had met nineteen times.<br>
<br>Lewis returned to Britain for a contest on Boxing day 1919 at the Royal Albert Hall. He won the British and European welterweight titles in March and June respectively of 1920, and the British middleweight championship a year later. In May 1922 he lost by a knockout in the first round to Georges Carpentier in his challenge for the world's light-heavyweight crown. Lewis lost all his boxing titles during 1923&#150;4, and had his last contest in 1929. In over 270 boxing matches he lost only thirty times. He never refused to fight and earned money voraciously, spent it excessively, and gave hand-outs endlessly. He was sentimental and politically na&iuml;ve, and the outstanding British boxer at the heavier weights in the first half of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>In January 1917 Lewis married Elsie Schneider (<i>d</i>. 1962) in New York; she was from a Jewish family. They had one child, a son. Lewis died on 20 October 1970 at 105 Nightingale Lane, Balham, London, and was buried five days later.<br>
