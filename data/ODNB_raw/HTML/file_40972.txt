<span class="headword">Venn,  John Archibald</span>  (1883&#150;1958), <span class="occ">historian and college head</span>, was born at Cambridge on 10 November 1883, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36639/', "John Venn (1834&#150;1923)")</script> of Gonville and Caius College and his wife, Susanna Carnegie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Edmonstone. He was educated at Eastbourne College, admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1902, took a third class in both parts of the historical tripos, and proceeded BA 1905, MA 1909, and LittD 1929. In 1906 he married Lucy Marion (1882/3&#150;1958), only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35752/', "Professor William Ridgeway")</script>. They adopted a daughter in 1932. For several years Venn and his father, than whom he could not have had a more experienced teacher in prosopography, compiled historical data on members of the university, and their <span class="italic">Book of Matriculations and Degrees &hellip; 1544 to 1659</span> appeared in 1913. He also helped to edit five volumes published between 1911 and 1916 of an admissions register of his own college to 1900, and completed the second volume of John Peile's expansive and unfinished <span class="italic">Biographical Register of Christ's College</span> (1913). He played tennis and enjoyed ornithology and motoring; though not a player of the game he invented a bowling machine which bowled out the Australian cricketer V. T. Trumper in three successive deliveries.<br>
<br>After army service in the First World War, Venn worked as a statistician in the food production department from 1917 and he remained an adviser to the Ministry of Agriculture while pursuing an academic career. From 1921 until 1949 he held the Gilbey lectureship in the history and economics of agriculture at Cambridge, and also served on many international, national, and local committees and the councils of academic bodies such as the British Association for the Advancement of Science. His last major position of that kind was as chairman of a government commission on the sugar industry in British Guiana in 1948&#150;9. Such appointments are listed in <span class="italic">Who Was Who, 1951&#150;1960</span>. He was made a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and in recognition of the wartime evacuation of the medical school from London to Queens' a &#145;perpetual student of Bart's&#146;, a title which delighted him. Venn's interest in farming was almost exclusively academic and confined to its history and organization, but he contributed useful counsel when agriculture was the object of several experiments between the wars, and was not reluctant to expose economic fallacies and practical obstacles. He wrote a standard book, <span class="italic">Foundations of Agricultural Economics</span> (1923), enlarged in 1933, and other papers in the subject.<br>
<br>Venn was elected fellow of Queens' College, with which his family had been associated since the eighteenth century, in 1927, served as junior bursar, and while still junior fellow was elected its president in March 1932, when he became the youngest head of a Cambridge college. He was generous to Queens' in his lifetime and by his will, and with his wife was a hospitable host despite his own teetotalism. He was ambitious for Queens' and ready to delegate responsibilities to its officers and to support them. He also served on the council of the senate and as vice-chancellor during the exacting disruption of war (1941&#150;3). His high sense of the traditional dignity of his offices as president and vice-chancellor and of the respect due to them rather than to himself personally meant that those who did not know him sometimes mistook formality for aloofness. After the war the university appointed him its first honorary keeper of the archives, and he largely established the post on a permanent footing. He was awarded a Coronation Medal in 1953 and was made CMG in 1956 for public services. He died at the president's lodge on 15 March 1958 after being in poor health for a year, and was buried on 20 March. His wife survived him by only ten days.<br>
<br>At heart Venn was always a historian. He published meticulous statistics of Oxford and Cambridge matriculations since 1544 in 1908 and 1930. Yet the work which occupied him for most of his life and for which he has been best remembered, the <span class="italic">Alumni Cantabrigienses: a biographical list of all known students, graduates and holders of office at the University of Cambridge from the earliest times to 1900</span>, was planned with his father. Two volumes of the first part to 1751 appeared before John Venn's death, and his son saw the series through to completion in a further eight massive, closely printed volumes between 1924 and 1954. He had many amanuenses but carefully controlled the entire labour of abstracting millions of facts from a wide variety of manuscript and published sources, and scrutinized all the proofs. He had the subject at his fingertips and, perhaps not surprisingly for one whose favourite author was Sir Thomas Browne, it provided him with endless anecdotes. The <span class="italic">Alumni</span> project was befriended and heavily subsidized by the syndics of the university press whose secretary, Sir Sydney Roberts, wrote of Venn's &#145;immense courage and determination&#146; in accomplishing his vast plan  (letter of 24 Jan 1959, registry file 3580/59). He was not a medievalist and his biographies down to 1500 were superseded by A. B. Emden's <span class="italic">Biographical Register</span> of 1963, but the bulk of the work, comprising more than 125,000 entries, has not been paralleled, let alone surpassed. Without them the social and academic history of Cambridge and of the English establishment at large written since the 1940s would have been much poorer.<br>
