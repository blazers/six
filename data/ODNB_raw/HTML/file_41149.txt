<span class="headword">Whitchester,  Roger  of</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1258), <span class="occ">clerk and justice</span>, was the son of Robert of Whitchester and his wife, Isabel, who were tenants at Whitchester in Northumberland of the Crauden family, of which Isabel was probably a member; they held the manor of Whitchester from the Bolbec barony. Robert served as sheriff of Northumberland from 1221 to 1223, and was also a commissioner of assize and gaol delivery in that county from 1229 to 1238; he held land in Benwell and Heddon on the Wall as well as Whitchester. Roger inherited from his father between October 1243 and April 1244. He clearly had no wish to become a knight, being unsuccessfully distrained to do so in 1244, and in 1253 secured life exemption from all the local duties for which knights were liable; he retained his minor clerical orders until his death. In 1226 he became rector of Elsdon, but had ceased to be so by 1245; he became rector of Ovingdean, Sussex, about 1248. His main career was as a clerk&#151;and later a justice&#151;of the bench at Westminster, where he was at first in the service of the justice William of York, probably by 1230, certainly by 1236; he also served as an attorney there.<br>
<br>On 28 May 1246 Whitchester was granted an annual salary of &pound;10 as keeper of the writs and rolls of the bench, the first man known to have held such an office. He also received an annual robe as a member of the royal household. In 1247 he went on eyre circuit with Henry of Bath, as keeper of the writs and rolls, returning to the bench in 1249 and remaining there as keeper until Trinity term 1254. It seems likely that he was involved in administrative changes which brought about improvements in the arrangement of the eyre rolls, with the development of special sections for foreign pleas and the appointment of attorneys, and a tendency for the bench rolls to become the impersonal record of the court, rather than the personal records of the justices for whom they were produced. From 1251 onwards he received frequent appointments as an assize commissioner, after 1252 invariably alone. The great majority of them were for cases in Essex and Kent, where he had acquired property. One such commission, involving a dispute at St Albans in Hertfordshire, seems to have earned him the animosity of Matthew Paris. None of his assize rolls has survived, however. Early in Michaelmas term 1254 Whitchester sat for a few days as a bench justice, and then went on eyre circuit as a justice with Gilbert of Preston, returning to Westminster to sit as a bench justice for the whole of Easter term 1255, before continuing as an eyre justice until the spring of 1258, after which he seems to have carried out assize commissions until his death later that year.<br>
<br>Whitchester's career as a royal servant provided him with the means of acquiring landed wealth in a number of counties in southern England from about 1235 onwards, including Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and Hertfordshire in addition to those already mentioned. He continued to acquire interests in Northumberland, some of which he gave as benefactions to the nuns of St Bartholomew's Priory at Newcastle between 1253 and 1257, when he was preparing for death. He had brothers, Robert and Master Nicholas, and sisters, Mabel and Joan, all but the last predeceasing him. He died about September 1258, Matthew Paris describing him in his obituary as a king's clerk and special counsellor, who in bearing the burden of judicial office strove wholly to please the royal will.<br>
