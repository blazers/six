<span class="headword">Six,  James</span>  (1730&#150;1793), <span class="occ">silk weaver and natural philosopher</span>, was born in Canterbury, Kent, on 30 January 1730, and baptized there in the Walloon church on 26 February. He was the son of James Six (1695&#150;1743) and his wife, Ester, daughter of Louis Ducaufour, and descended from the Huguenot refugee families who came to Britain in the sixteenth century and settled in Canterbury, where they engaged in the silk weaving trade. Six was brought up in the family business but declining trade prompted him to retire early and devote himself to the wide range of interests typical of an eighteenth-century intellectual, though there is no evidence that he ever received any formal training. He was a good artist, and he was certainly a competent amateur astronomer: he sent several observations of comets and of the planet Uranus to William Herschel, to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, and to the American Philosophical Society, which enrolled him as a foreign member in 1787.<br>
<br>Six is best remembered for the self-registering thermometer which he invented, the first to record maximum and minimum temperatures on a single instrument. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1792 for this invention and his own temperature observations. His book on these subjects was published posthumously as <span class="italic">The Construction and Use of a Thermometer</span> (1794); twenty-five experimental forms of air and marine thermometer made by him have been preserved. Six never patented his designs. He sent examples of the air thermometer to friends at home and abroad, and soon after his death it was adopted by the Royal Society and Kew observatory. Versions of his marine thermometer served for deep-sea measurements throughout the nineteenth century. Two centuries after its invention, &#145;Six's&#146; remained a popular house and garden thermometer.<br>
<br>All accounts of Six describe him as a competent yet modest and unassuming man of great integrity, and a devout Christian. With Robert Deane he founded and supported a Sunday school in the parish of Holy Cross in Kent, which offered religious instruction and taught reading and singing to poor children, and much of his time was devoted to this cause. On 21 May 1754 Six married Mary Riquebourg (1733&#150;1801) of Canterbury; they had four sons, three of whom died in infancy and one in 1786, and a daughter. Six died on 25 August 1793 and was buried at Holy Cross, Westgate, Canterbury. He and his wife, who was also buried at Holy Cross, were commemorated in a tablet within the chancel.<br>
