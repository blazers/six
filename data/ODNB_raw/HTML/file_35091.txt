<span class="headword">Moore,  Stuart Archibald</span>  (1842&#150;1907), <span class="occ">antiquary and barrister</span>, was born in September 1842, the fourth son of Barlow Brass Moore of The Lawn, South Lambeth, Surrey, and his wife, Harriet Adcock. Educated at the Philological School, Marylebone Road, Marylebone, London, he became secretary to Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy, deputy keeper of the public records, and afterwards practised as a record agent. Elected FSA on 2 May 1869, he contributed in 1886 a paper&#151;&#145;The death and burial of King Edward II&#146;&#151;to <span class="italic">Archaeologia</span>. Moore's services were retained in legal disputes relating in particular to foreshore, fishery, and cognate matters. On 24 January 1880, when well established in this career, he became a student of the Inner Temple, and was called to the bar on 25 June 1884.<br>
<br>Moore came to the bar at a time when the crown, through the office of woods, forests, and land revenues, and after 1866 the Board of Trade, had consistently asserted over the past fifty years a claim to presumptive ownership of the foreshore of most of the United Kingdom, excluding the duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster, putting lords of coastal manors in England and Wales, and owners of coastal baronies in Scotland, to strict proof of their alleged titles. The crown's assertion was supported in particular by Robert Gream Hall's essay <span class="italic">Rights of the Crown and the Privileges of the Subject in the Sea Shore of the Realm</span> (1830), re-edited by Loveland in 1875. Moore accepted an invitation from its publishers to produce a third edition. He observed that on starting this task he became aware of the unfairness and bias of Hall's arguments and obtained the publisher's permission to preface the new edition with a &#145;brief treatise&#146; of his own. The result, in 1888, was a single volume comprising a treatise of over 600 pages, <span class="italic">A History of the Foreshore and the Law Relating Thereto</span>, which included the text of Sir Matthew Hale's &#145;Touchinge the customes&#146; and &#145;De jure maris&#146; printed from the Hargrave manuscripts, together with Loveland's edition of Hall's essay with additional footnotes by Moore, mostly critical of Hall's text. The thesis of Moore's treatise, described by a reviewer as a &#145;crusade&#146;  (<span class="italic">Solicitors' Journal</span>, 313), was that before the conquest most of the English foreshore had been granted to subjects and thereafter formed part of the waste of coastal manors; furthermore, the crown's assertion of presumptive ownership had been advanced for political reasons as late as Elizabethan times by &#145;title hunters&#146;, in particular Thomas Digges, and had been endorsed by compliant Stuart judges. Moore considered that not until 1849 did the crown's presumptive title acquire authority in Scotland, through statements by Anglocentric judges in the House of Lords. Moore, who described his treatise as a &#145;counterblast&#146; against Digges, Hall, and government officials, and as &#145;a brief for the subject against the Crown&#146;  (<span class="italic">A History of the Foreshore and the Law Relating Thereto</span>, xlv), sought to support his case by a wealth of citation from medieval rolls, charters, and manorial records. Moore's historical theory was not original, for in 1849 Henry Merewether had argued at length before the court of chancery that the crown's claim was unsupported by authority. This address was reproduced in Loveland's edition, but not by Moore.<br>
<br>Moore's treatise was published while he was engaged as counsel to the lord of the manors of Great and Little Wakering in Essex, against whom the crown claimed ownership of the Maplin Sands. However, Moore's theory was not put to the test as the lord was able to win the case on the ground that he could prove a good title from the crown. Moore's satisfaction at his client's victory must have been tempered by the unanimous statement of the House of Lords that &#145;it is beyond dispute that the Crown is prima facie entitled to every part of the foreshore between high and low-water mark&#146;  (<i>Attorney-General v. Emerson</i>, 1891). Moore continued a lucrative practice in foreshore disputes, defending the subject against the crown, to the extent that he was described in one obituary as &#145;a thorn in the side of Government officers&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 July 1907).<br>
<br>Moore loved yachting, and was one of the finest amateur seamen of his time; he commanded his own 80 ton fishing ketch, in which he carried the vice-commodore's flag of the Royal Cruising Club all round Great Britain and the greater part of Ireland, with little regard for weather. He was a frequent correspondent of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, chiefly on yachting and other seafaring matters. He married Isabel Kate, daughter of John Knight Higgins of Northamptonshire, and had two sons; the elder, Hubert Stuart Moore (1869&#150;1951), followed him both into chambers and into scholarship as a writer and editor on matters of water, land drainage, and fishery law.<br>
<br>Besides his treatise, Moore also published <span class="italic">The Thames Estuary: its Tides, Channels, &amp;c., a Practical Guide for Yachts</span> (1894) and (with Hubert Stuart Moore) <span class="italic">The History and Law of Fisheries</span> (1903). He edited <span class="italic">The Letters and Papers of J. Shillingford, 1447&#150;50</span>, for the Camden Society (1871), and <span class="italic">Cartularium monasterii sancti Johannis Baptiste in Colecestria</span>, for the Roxburghe Club (1897), as well as <span class="italic">The Domesday Book for Northamptonshire, Extended and Translated</span> (1863). The library of the Inner Temple has a collection of his professional papers, including extensive notes and transcripts for his foreshore research.<br>
<br>About two years before his death Moore was seized with paralysis of his lower limbs and retired to his vessel, where he continued to be a genial host. Shortly before his death he wrote two letters to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, on secret commissions (8 January 1907) and on the channel tunnel (8 February 1907). He died on 29 June 1907, on board his yacht <i>Gwalia</i> at Southwick, near Hove, and was buried at Southwick on 2 July.<br>
