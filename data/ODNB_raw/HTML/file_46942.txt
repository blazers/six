<span class="headword">Gimson,  Alfred Charles</span> <span class="st"> [Gim]</span>  (1917&#150;1985), <span class="occ">phonetician</span>, was born on 7 June 1917 at 587 Garratt Lane, Wandsworth, London, the son of Charles Edmund Gimson, munition factory fireman, and his wife, Kate Louise Derbyshire. He was educated at Earlsfield primary school in Wandsworth, London, and, from 1928 to 1936, at Emanuel School, Wandsworth, where he was school captain, editor of the school magazine, and captain of tennis. He entered University College, London (UCL), in October 1936 to study for a BA degree in French; he graduated with first-class honours in 1939. As part of his course he took classes in French and English phonetics under the tutelage of H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Coustenoble (1894&#150;1963) and Daniel Jones&#151;events that were to shape his future career. Gimson spent the Second World War in the army intelligence corps, mainly as a liaison officer with the French and Polish allied forces, and rose to the rank of major. He was known familiarly as Gim.<br>
<br>In 1945 Gimson was appointed to a temporary lectureship in phonetics at UCL, the post being made permanent the following year. In 1961 he was appointed reader, and in 1966 professor. Between 1971 and 1983 (the year of his retirement) he was head of department. In 1973 he was made a fellow of UCL. His published work focused mainly on the pronunciation of modern English, though his range of expertise included French, Serbo-Croat, Norwegian, and the history of English. His most significant publication, the <span class="italic">Introduction to the Pronunciation of English</span>, first published in 1962 and revised on several occasions since, remains the standard authoritative work on the pronunciation of British English, written, as the title indicates, ostensibly for the beginner, but including a good deal of more advanced material as well. His <span class="italic">Practical Course of English Pronunciation</span> (1975) is a well-respected course, especially among teachers of English as a foreign language.<br>
<br>The International Phonetic Association benefited greatly from Gimson's administrative and managerial support from 1949 onwards, when he took on the post of secretary and, later, treasurer. He was made a life president of the association in 1984. His involvement with the profession of speech and language therapy was marked by his appointment to the examinations board of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists in 1949, and by the award of an honorary fellowship of the college in 1958. He acted as chairman of the college from 1965 to 1972.<br>
<br>Gimson was a founding member in 1967 of the academic advisory committee of Linguaphone, and his name is associated with many self-study language courses produced by the company. His skills as a phonetician came to the attention of a wider public with his short talks on BBC radio on aspects of current English pronunciation (&#145;Changing English&#146;), and his role as the pronunciation adviser to the <span class="italic">Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English</span> (Proctor and others, 1978) and to the <span class="italic">Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English</span> (Hornby and others, 1974). In 1967 Gimson took over the editorship of the <span class="italic">English Pronouncing Dictionary</span>, begun by Daniel Jones in 1917, and made various necessary changes to its content and style of presentation. It is still one of the standard academic reference works on British pronunciation.<br>
<br>Gimson was regarded by students and colleagues worldwide as not only a talented lecturer and tutor, but also a humane, kind-hearted, and supportive person. He and his wife, Margaret Dilys Muir, had a daughter. Gimson died suddenly of a heart attack in his sleep at his home, 50 Princes Avenue, Petts Wood, Orpington, Kent, on 22 April 1985; his wife survived him.<br>
