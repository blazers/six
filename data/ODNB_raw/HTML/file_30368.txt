</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Alexander,  Albert Victor</span>, Earl Alexander of Hillsborough  (1885&#150;1965), <span class="occ">politician and co-operator</span>, was born at 59 George Street, Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, on 1 May 1885, the son of Albert Alexander (<i>d</i>. 1886), a blacksmith, and his wife, Eliza Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Thatcher. On his father's death his mother moved back to her parents' house in Bristol, and provided for her four children by returning to her trade as a maker of surgical belts and corsets. For several years times were difficult, but eventually this determined and energetic woman owned a successful business.<h2>
<a name="Localgovernmentofficer"></a>Local government officer</h2>Alexander was educated at Barton Hill elementary school in Bristol, but ended his formal education at the age of thirteen to supplement the family income. His first job was in the office of a leather merchant, but he soon became employed as a boy clerk in the office of the Bristol school board. In 1903 he shifted to the school management department of the Somerset county council and returned to live at Weston-super-Mare. Apart from war service he remained in educational administration until 1920.<br>
<br>Alexander's marriage on 6 June 1908 to Esther Ellen (1877/8&#150;1969), a schoolteacher, daughter of George Chapple of Tiverton, Devon, was the prelude to some significant shifts in his activities. His first religious affiliation had been to the Church of England; under his wife's influence, he became a Baptist. As a lay preacher he became an exponent of militant protestantism. &#145;If you want salvation, you have to be born again. You have to go to the life-giving Word of God; the Word made flesh&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5L</span>, 231, 1961, 242). His religious shift was accompanied by support for the Liberal Party, in contrast to his mother who was a stalwart Conservative. He joined the Weston Co-operative Society and became active in the National Association of Local Government Officers. In addition he continued his education at evening classes. Such activities located him very much in the culture of respectable Edwardian Liberalism. As an activist he developed political skills; his work as a lay preacher made him an effective public speaker. In this last field he emulated his maternal grandfather, Francis Thatcher, a well-known Bristol evangelist.<br>
<br>This stability was broken, perhaps decisively, by the First World War. Alexander volunteered in 1914, but was not called up until 1916, when he joined the Artists' Rifles. Military training affected his health and he saw no active service. Instead he became a posting officer, allocated recruits to their units, and following the armistice served as an education officer. He was demobilized with the rank of captain. A return to Weston-super-Mare and the Somerset education department perhaps seemed a move back to a narrower world. On holiday in London in 1920 he read an advertisement for a parliamentary secretary to the Co-operative Congress. In September 1920 he accepted the post; in November he began work in London.<h2>
<a name="CooperatorandLabourMP"></a>Co-operator and Labour MP</h2>Within a year Alexander was associated with a great parliamentary victory. The Lloyd George coalition proposed to impose a corporation profit tax on the undistributed dividends of co-operative societies. Alexander's patient lobbying influenced some government back-benchers. On 19 July 1921 the tax proposal was defeated by 137 votes to 135. This parliamentary success raised Alexander's political status. He was approached by the Co-operative Party in Sheffield to be their parliamentary candidate. The Co-operative Party had emerged in 1917&#150;18; its candidates normally enjoyed Labour Party support. In the general election of November 1922 Alexander was returned as the Labour and Co-operative member for Sheffield Hillsborough.<br>
<br>Alexander's achievement was distinctive. He had not been a member of any trade union affiliated to the Labour Party, nor had he been active in any socialist organization. Arguably his beliefs showed much continuity with his pre-war Liberalism; he proved a competent and well-informed parliamentary speaker. His administrative skills were evident, and in January 1924 he obtained a junior post in the first Labour government. As parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade, he worked under another dedicated administrator, Sidney Webb. Beatrice Webb described him as<blockquote>a new discovery&#151;a hard-headed administrative socialist, graduating in municipal service and recently identified with the Consumers' Co-operative Movement. He is a singularly good-tempered, sane-minded, direct-speaking person, alike in private and on the platform, with a strain of intellectual curiosity, of great value in social reconstruction. (22 March 1924, <span class="italic">The Diary of Beatrice Webb</span>, ed. N. I. MacKenzie and J. MacKenzie, 4, 1985, 22)</blockquote>In the years of opposition from 1924 to 1929 Alexander never stood for election to the executive committee of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). Dividing his time between parliament and the Co-operative Congress, he stood therefore outside the formal leadership group. But as an effective parliamentarian he was tipped increasingly for high office in any future Labour government.<h2>
<a name="BoardofAdmiralty"></a>Board of Admiralty</h2>Whatever the distinctive character of his route to Labour politics, Alexander participated enthusiastically in the Sheffield labour movement. From 1922 the city had three Labour MPs, rising to five in 1929; Labour gained control of the city council in 1926. Alexander's campaigns in Sheffield included a strong co-operative element, but his work there and at Westminster was dominated by the depression in the Sheffield steel industry. It might have been expected that any ministerial advancement for Alexander might reflect his economic and social concerns; but the formation of the second Labour government in June 1929 saw him enter the cabinet as first lord of the Admiralty. Cabinet membership indicated his reputation for competence both in parliament and in administration. Beatrice Webb, an admirer, summarized the assessment that brought him to high office: &#145;a vigorous and masterful personality; with good physique, alert mind, straightforward manner, but without charm or brilliance. Somewhat of the Arthur Henderson build and temperament&#146;  (14 Sept 1929, <span class="italic">Beatrice Webb's Diaries</span>, ed. Cole, 219).<br>
<br>Alexander's appointment to the Admiralty did not arise from any prior interest in naval matters. Yet this became his specialism for over two decades. Contemporary and historical judgements have varied on how far Alexander acted as much more than the political representative of naval interests. Yet he rapidly developed a mastery over detail&#151;so much so, that after a meeting in Rome with Mussolini in 1930, the latter assumed that Alexander had been a naval officer. Moreover he was an effective advocate for his case both in cabinet and in the Commons. Within his first year at the Admiralty he was involved in the London Naval Conference. The resulting treaty between Britain, the United States, and Japan presented agreement on both numerical and qualitative limitations on construction. He replied effectively to opposition criticism that the outcome would result in an erosion of British naval supremacy.<br>
<br>Alexander's departmental commitments meant that he had little involvement in the Labour government's desperate attempts to deal with rapidly rising unemployment. In August 1931, along with other cabinet members, he confronted the crisis precipitated by the publication of the May report on public expenditure and the flight of Britain's gold reserves. His basically liberal sentiments remained powerful. When the cabinet debated the possibility of a revenue tariff, Alexander was one of the five free-traders who backed the thorough opposition of the chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Snowden. He did not question the need for a balanced budget and cuts in public expenditure. A paper from him accepted cuts in naval pay provided that equivalent reductions were made elsewhere in the public services and in unemployment benefit. Alexander seemed impeccably orthodox; and yet in the symbolic cabinet vote on a 10 per cent cut in unemployment benefit he stood with Arthur Henderson and the dissenting minority.<br>
<br>With the formation of the National Government, Alexander became a prominent member of the Labour opposition. He was elected to the executive committee of the PLP and made a notably vigorous Commons speech opposing the new government's economy measures. Like other former members of the Labour cabinet, he distanced himself from any suggestion that they had been prepared to endorse many of the economies that they now criticized. Together with most of his colleagues Alexander was defeated in the October 1931 general election, and for the next four years concentrated on his work for the co-operative movement. In contrast to his success in 1921, he failed to persuade the National Government not to tax the surpluses of co-operative societies, a change introduced in 1933.<br>
<br>Prior to his election defeat in 1931 Alexander had been seen, for example by Arthur Henderson, as a possible future leader of the Labour Party. Yet when he regained his Sheffield seat in the general election of 1935 he did not stand for the leadership, and instead backed Herbert Morrison. During his years out of parliament he had tended to concentrate on co-operative affairs at a time when Attlee had strengthened his own position in the parliamentary party, and Morrison had been prominent both as a party policy maker and as leader of the successful Labour group on the London county council. In contrast, Alexander never established a dominant role in the broader Labour Party. He was not a star at party conferences and his increasing concentration on defence issues struck few chords with back-benchers and party activists. From 1935 he was a valued member of the party's Commons leadership; he played a significant part along with Hugh Dalton in shifting the PLP away from its opposition to defence estimates. Within the controversies of the late 1930s he endorsed collective security through the League of Nations, criticized the Munich settlement and the application of the non-intervention policy in Spain, and attacked any hint of a popular front.<h2>
<a name="ReturntotheAdmiralty"></a>Return to the Admiralty</h2>The formation of the Churchill coalition in May 1940 brought Alexander back to the Admiralty. He succeeded the new prime minister, with whom he had been in regular contact on naval matters since the latter's return to the Admiralty in September 1939. Churchill and the chiefs of staff continued to direct operations, and Alexander was denied access to the most secret materials. However, within his allotted sphere he acted with his customary energy and competence. His relationship with the sea lords was good, and his knowledge and zeal made him an effective advocate of the navy's case in the battle for resources. He was also an effective propagandist, speaking at &#145;warship weeks&#146; to maintain public enthusiasm for the war. Critics suggested that he was too enamoured of naval tradition and too responsive to flattery by the sea lords, but his wartime ministerial career was generally reckoned a success.<br>
<br>Alexander would have preferred a continuation of the coalition until the defeat of Japan, but the Labour victory in the 1945 election meant that his absence from the Admiralty was brief. His final stint covered the transition from a war to a peace footing. It also involved his absence from Whitehall between March and June 1946 as a member of the cabinet mission to India. His two colleagues were the secretary of state, Lord Pethick-Lawrence, and Sir Stafford Cripps, who had been involved in an earlier Indian initiative in 1942. Alexander was involved as the custodian of British defence interests; he began with slight knowledge of Indian affairs and was at first largely silent. As he became more familiar with the issues his interventions became vigorous, and he tended to side with the viceroy, Lord Wavell, sometimes in opposition to his cabinet colleagues. His responses could be thoroughly imperialist as he encountered Congress politicians. &#145;I was not prepared to sit down under the humiliation of my country and therefore something better than a policy of scuttle would have to be thought up&#146;  (Alexander, diary, 20 May 1946, quoted in Morgan, 221). Along with Ernest Bevin he was unhappy about the eventual decision to withdraw.<h2>
<a name="Ministerofdefence"></a>Minister of defence</h2>Alexander finally left the Admiralty in October 1946; until December he sat in the cabinet as minister without portfolio, but then became minister of defence in charge of a new department created to reorganize the direction of defence policy. In general he was less successful at defence than at the Admiralty. His old post had harnessed his talents for vigorous advocacy of a departmental case. The strategic perspective necessitated by his new responsibility proved more difficult. He also faced problems in arbitrating between the competing claims of the services. This friction over resources meant that his relationships with the service chiefs were more problematic than had been the case at the Admiralty. This was particularly the case with the chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Montgomery, who felt that Alexander &#145;always sat on the fence&#146;  (Montgomery, 483). Away from the recriminations Alexander was a member of the secret cabinet committee concerned with the development of a British atomic bomb.<br>
<br>Some of Alexander's problems reflected broader political and economic pressures upon the government. He was a thorough supporter of Bevin's foreign policy, a position that provoked criticism among some co-operators, but military spending was necessarily constrained by economic difficulties, not least in summer 1947, when Alexander fought a long battle to limit cuts in defence expenditure. There were also problems with Labour back-benchers. Legislation to introduce peacetime national service for an eighteen-month period was introduced by the government in spring 1947. Opposition came not only from customary Labour critics of government foreign policy but from those influenced by pacifist or broader anti-militarist sentiments. The government responded by reducing the period of service from eighteen months to twelve, an announcement made by Alexander during the bill's committee stage  (<span class="italic">Hansard 5C</span>, 437, 1947, 441&#150;53). However, the intensification of the cold war produced a reversal of the policy; further legislation in December 1948 restored the eighteen-month requirement.<br>
<br>Alexander expressed firm positions in some cabinet debates beyond his own ministerial responsibilities. His constituency interests helped to ensure that he initially supported the early nationalization of the iron and steel industry. On this divisive issue he stood at first, unusually, with what could broadly be characterized as the left within the cabinet. Subsequently, however, he favoured a compromise that fell short of full nationalization. In discussions on the National Health Service he was critical of the proposed dependence of hospitals on central government funds. His support of municipal involvement perhaps indicated the decentralizing strand within the co-operative tradition.<h2>
<a name="HouseofLords"></a>House of Lords</h2>Alexander took a peerage in the new year's honours list of 1950 and became chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster until the government lost office in the 1951 election. In this last ministerial phase he was a strong supporter of United States policy during the Korean War. He backed American moves to brand China as an aggressor in a United Nations resolution. A Foreign Office minister noted that Alexander and another supporter of the American line, Lord Jowitt, were &#145;like good old High Tories&#146;  (Kenneth Younger, quoted in Morgan, 431). In opposition, Alexander became deputy leader of the Labour group in the Lords and succeeded Jowitt as leader in 1955. He was a regular and conscientious participant in Lords debates until his retirement in autumn 1964. He died in Manor House Hospital, Hendon, Middlesex, on 11 January 1965, and was buried three days later at West Mersea, Essex. He was survived by his wife (who was made CBE in 1947) and by a daughter. A son died in infancy, and his title therefore became extinct.<br>
<br>Alexander was a committed co-operator, a fervent protestant, an energetic administrator, an uncomplicated patriot, and an enthusiast for traditions, especially those of the navy. His route into the upper echelons of the Labour Party was unusual; his contribution above all was to help make the party credible as a potential government, especially in an area such as defence, where Conservatives had traditionally claimed a special competence. Apart from his commitment to co-operation, he articulated little that was ideologically distinctive to the Labour cause. He retained legacies of his Liberal past, and in his later career his views on foreign policy and defence were little different from those of the Conservative leadership.<br>
<br>Beyond his extensive political activities Alexander was a convivial figure, with several friendships outside the labour movement. A self-taught pianist, his repertory of music-hall tunes provided the basis for relaxation in diverse settings, not least the vice-regal lodge. A second enthusiasm was football. In December 1946 Lord Wavell, increasingly at odds with the Attlee government over Indian policy, visited London. Towards the end of his visit Wavell went with Alexander to watch the minister's team, Chelsea, at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers. The viceroy, in his official discussions, had seen Alexander the defender of empire; at Stamford Bridge he saw Alexander as everyman: &#145;He is an enthusiastic football fan, shouting &#147;foul&#148;, &#147;play the game&#148;, &#147;don't mess about&#148; etc as loudly as anyone&#146;  (24 Dec 1946, <span class="italic">Wavell: the Viceroy's Journal</span>, 399).<br>
