<span class="headword">Gairy, Sir  Eric Matthew</span>  (1922&#150;1997), <span class="occ">prime minister of Grenada</span>, was born on 18 February 1922 near Grenville, Grenada, the son of an estate foreman and his wife, a domestic servant. He was educated at a Catholic elementary school. He emigrated to Aruba, where he worked as a clerk in the oil refinery before returning home at the end of 1949. He first came to public attention in 1950, when he negotiated a cash compensation for estate tenants evicted by a new owner. With this intervention he was viewed as the champion of rural workers. He capitalized on this goodwill by establishing the first trade union for agricultural workers, the Grenada Manual and Mental Workers' Union (GMMWU), in July 1950. Within a month of the union's registration Gairy launched a strike on behalf of the sugar workers which resulted in substantial wage increases. His efforts to secure wage increases for workers on the cocoa and nutmeg estates succeeded only after a month-long, island-wide general strike in 1951.<br>
<br>The loyal following of rural workers created by Gairy's trade union militancy formed the core of support for his Grenada People's Party (by 1953 the Grenada United Labour Party), which he established in 1951. In the first general elections under adult suffrage in October that year Gairy's party won six of the eight seats. By 1951 he had emerged as the major trade unionist and political figure in Grenada. His success challenged the prevailing economic and political order. As a trade unionist he established the power of organized labour in its confrontation with capital. His electoral victory represented a shift of political power from the white and brown &eacute;lite that had controlled government under a restrictive franchise. The basis of his popular appeal was his identification with the interests of the working class. Thus he presented himself as &#145;the little black boy&#146; who had forced the &#145;upper brackets&#146; to come to terms with him  (Thorndike, 33). To his supporters he brought a new level of class consciousness by drawing their attention to the domination of a small economic &eacute;lite in the main export industries, the inadequate compensation of workers, and the existence of colour prejudice which shaped employment practices.<br>
<br>In his first term in office as minister of trade and production from 1956 to 1957 (following an increased measure of self-government granted by Britain) Gairy introduced reforms which benefited his rural constituency, including land reform and security of tenure for tenants. There were, however, signs that the purpose of the organizations that he led was to sustain his political career rather than to promote social and economic change. The GMMWU lost its early momentum as Gairy used his trade union mainly for political support. He made, moreover, no attempt to develop a party organization, but relied instead on his personal appeal. In the period 1954&#150;7 his electoral support declined with the formation in 1954 of the Grenada National Party (GNP), led by Herbert Blaize. In 1957 the GNP won the general elections, and shortly afterwards Gairy was disfranchised after disrupting a GNP meeting. His franchise was restored in 1961, when he became chief minister under a new constitution with a ministerial system. Gairy's tenure had lasted only ten months when the British government suspended the constitution after a 1962 commission of inquiry charged him with violating the regulations governing expenditure. He subsequently lost the 1962 election.<br>
<br>On his return to office as chief minister in 1967 Gairy consolidated his power by dispensing concessions to a new class of businessmen and benefiting from their loyalty and financial kickbacks. He centralized decision making in the cabinet, assumed control over civil service appointments, and suppressed dissent by making it difficult for a parliamentary opposition to operate. He thus established an alternative power base to the rural workers, from whom he distanced himself. By the early 1970s organized opposition to his rule grew with the return of professionals who had studied abroad. These individuals emphasized political mobilization outside the electoral cycle. In March 1973 the New Jewel Movement (NJM) was established and by 1973&#150;4 had co-ordinated a broad alliance of political, trade union, business, and religious organizations in opposition to Gairy, who became prime minister of Grenada, and minister of external affairs, planning and development, lands, tourism, information service, public relations, and natural resources, following independence, in 1974.<br>
<br>Gairy responded to this growing opposition by repression and intimidation. He relied increasingly on the use of paramilitary forces (including the notorious &#145;Mongoose Gang&#146;) to terrorize opponents, and on legislation to close the opposition's access to the media. By 1979 his government had alienated important sections of Grenadian society, including the businessmen, who regarded his corrupt and authoritarian government as a hindrance to economic activity. On 13 March 1979 the NJM seized control of the government during his absence in New York, where he had gone to address the United Nations on one of his favourite topics, unidentified flying objects. He remained in the United States for the four years of the NJM's Marxist regime. After American forces invaded the island in October 1983 and established control, he returned to Grenada and contested the December 1984 elections. His party won only one seat but gained 36 per cent of the popular vote. However, he failed to regain power in the 1990 and 1995 elections. Gairy, who was knighted in 1977, died at Grand Anse, Grenada, on 23 August 1997. He was survived by his wife, Cynthia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Clyne, whom he had married in 1949 and who had served as a minister in his cabinet, and two daughters. He had begun his public career as a champion of the working class, but by the late 1970s he had become a repressive tyrant, having used his popular support to advance his political ambitions and financial interests.<br>
