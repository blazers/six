<span class="headword">Dacre,  William</span>, third Baron Dacre of Gilsland and seventh Baron Greystoke  (1500&#150;1563), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the eldest son and heir of Elizabeth Greystoke, Baroness Greystoke (1471&#150;1516), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50220/', "Thomas Dacre, second Baron Dacre of Gilsland (1467&#150;1525)")</script>, her husband. Born on 29 April 1500, he succeeded to the barony of Greystoke on his mother's death in August 1516, and to the barony of Gilsland on his father's death in October 1525. He married Elizabeth Talbot (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1559), the fourth earl of Shrewsbury's daughter, probably about 1520. Towards the end of his father's long rule of the borders, Lord Greystoke served successively as his captain of Norham and Carlisle and deputy warden of the west marches. Yet the king's decision in mid-1525 to promote as earl of Cumberland a relative outsider to the county, Lord Clifford, and then to appoint the new earl as deputy warden, was hardly likely to commend him to the Dacres. Trouble ensued after Lord William refused to surrender Carlisle Castle or to relinquish farms of land traditionally associated with the wardenry. Cumberland found it impossible to rule without Dacre's co-operation: in 1527 the king finally agreed to appoint Dacre as warden, but further trouble followed over custody of Carlisle, which Cumberland retained until 1529. And whereas the earl of Northumberland, as incoming warden across the Pennines, received an enhanced salary and fee'd retainers to help him restore order, Dacre's salary remained the now traditional early Tudor &pound;153 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. a year, far less than fifteenth-century wardens.<br>
<br>Anglo-Scottish hostilities recommenced in 1532&#150;3, but the English military effort was concentrated on the opposite march&#151;even though the <i>casus belli</i> was possession of the &#145;debateable land&#146;, north of Carlisle&#151;so leaving Dacre to shift for himself. When peace was finally concluded in May 1534, Dacre was suddenly arrested while in London to attend parliament. Concurrently, royal commissioners seized his property and vainly searched his residences for incriminating papers. None the less, Dacre was charged with treason for holding secret meetings and making private treaties with Scottish enemies in wartime for mutual indemnity from raids and invasions. These charges reflected the world of cross-border connections in which a conscientious warden necessarily moved so as to discharge his office. Dacre, for instance, generally enjoyed good relations with his Scottish counterpart and distant kinsman, Lord Maxwell. Yet in the process he risked accusations of getting too close to the king's enemies. Lady Dacre, who had come to London to plead for her husband, was ordered by the king to cease her intercessions until after his trial, on 9 July. There Dacre defended himself for seven hours and was eventually found not guilty. A great cheer went up in Westminster Hall when the verdict was announced. Apparently, the lords triers dismissed as proceeding from malice the evidence of the chief witness, Sir William Musgrave, formerly Dacre's household servant. Dacre was the only nobleman to be so acquitted during Henry VIII's reign, but the king none the less tried to cripple his influence in the west march. Dacre's subsequent pardon for misprision of treason cost &pound;10,000: he paid 7000 marks of it within three months (the plate and ready money seized by the commissioners), the rest in instalments by 1541. He had also to surrender all letters patent and leases and live near London (later at Henderskelf, near the northern council's seat at Sheriff Hutton). Cumberland replaced him as warden, thereby further exacerbating the tensions between them arising out of the circumstances of Dacre's arrest, and Dacre was left to try to rebuild his credit by studious loyalty for the remainder of the reign.<br>
<br>After recovering most of his property&#151;disputes with Cumberland, Musgrave, and Sir Thomas Wharton dragged on into the 1550s&#151;Dacre instituted a survey in 1536 of his Cumberland estates. Despite his pressing need for money, military service remained a priority: he ordered his officials not to take more than three years' rent for gressum (entry fine), and to let any vacant tenement to &#145;a good archer &hellip; and rather to him for lesse gryssome then to ane oder being none archer&#146;  (University of Durham, Howard of Naworth MS C/201/5, fols. 4<i>r</i>&#150;4<i>v</i>). When the Pilgrimage of Grace began in October 1536, the rebels approached Dacre to lead them, but he rode instead to Naworth to stay the country. Only after his departure in early November did his Cumberland tenants join the pilgrimage. Finally, the following February, he hurried northwards again upon news of the siege of Carlisle, but his uncle, Sir Christopher, had already dispersed the rebels before his arrival.<br>
<br>Dacre's loyalty was rewarded by appointment to the king's council in the north, but the king ignored the duke of Norfolk's recommendation concerning the wardenries, noting that Dacre's reappointment would stoke the feud with Cumberland. Instead, he appointed Wharton as deputy warden, supported by crown pensioners. Unsurprisingly, Dacre declined the lesser post as keeper of turbulent Tynedale: &#145;he had rather loose one fynger of every hande then to medle therwith&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers, Henry VIII</span>, 5.108). The king also pointedly withheld Lanercost Priory, the traditional Dacre burial place, after its dissolution, granting it in 1542 to Dacre's illegitimate half-brother, Sir Thomas Dacre, a crown pensioner and follower of Wharton in the Dacre heartland and later a staunch protestant. The quarrelsome Wharton soon realized the difficulties of ruling without Dacre's co-operation. Even after Wharton's extensive landed acquisitions, Dacre's Cumberland estates (worth approximately &pound;750 annually <i>c</i>.1537&#150;47 in a total rental of about &pound;2500 per annum) were still worth more than Wharton's entire holdings, and Wharton's modest Cumberland possessions (former Percy estates around Cockermouth) were also in the strategically less important west of the county. Effectively, therefore, Wharton's suggestion in 1543 that the king exchange Dacre's three baronies of Burgh, Gilsland, and Greystoke for lands elsewhere was an admission of failure; but it was only after the old king's death that Protector Somerset had Dacre reappointed warden, on 17 April 1549.<br>
<br>Dacre had commanded the rearguard in Somerset's Scottish expedition of 1547, but Somerset's Scottish adventures held fewer attractions for the succeeding Dudley regime, which distrusted both Dacre's regional dominance and also his religious conservatism. Dacre was ousted again in February 1551 and imprisoned in London for his feud with the Musgraves. He was finally reconciled with the Cliffords through the mediation of his brother-in-law, Shrewsbury: in 1554 Dacre's daughter Anne married Henry Clifford, second earl of Cumberland. Queen Mary reappointed him on 2 January 1554 (also briefly, as warden of the middle marches to May 1555), a reward for loyalty against Lady Jane Grey. Thereafter he served continuously, despite increasing age, infirmity, and complaints of misrule by local rivals, until April 1563. Elizabeth's distrust of Catholic nobles in sensitive posts was probably the main reason for his removal and replacement by the protestant Lord Scrope. His religious conservatism was well known: he had denounced the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> in the Lords during Edward VI's reign. In November he fell ill just before Sunday dinner at Kirkoswald and retired to the great chamber, saying: &#145;Thomas [his heir], take my place, for I am sick.&#146; After lingering for three days he died about 4 or 5 a.m. on Thursday 18 November 1563, and following procession and funeral&#151;kept as traditional as possible&#151;he was buried in Carlisle Cathedral on 14 December. He had four sons, as well as his daughters, Anne and Magdalen [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71781/', "Browne, Magdalen, Viscountess Montagu")</script>]: Thomas, fourth Baron Dacre, whom Dacre matched with the earl of Westmorland's daughter; and Edward, Francis, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6994/', "Leonard Dacre")</script>.<br>
<br>Dacre's chequered career epitomized the difficulty encountered by Tudor marcher lords in trying both to meet the crown's increased expectations about what constituted acceptable conduct, and concurrently to preserve their estates and regional connection at a time when Tudor policy and economic pressures were steadily undermining traditional methods of border defence. In the face of Tudor notions of an ordered society, a more traditional aristocratic concept of order, focused on loyalty to the family lineage, pervaded the Dacre household. Dacre's son noted his father's concern &#145;for the continuance of his house in honour&#146; and also &#145;his great foresight of the stay of his name&#146; on the borders  (Summerson, 2.519). Yet, without the steady royal backing his father had enjoyed as warden, Dacre's rule of the borders was undistinguished. His lifestyle was appropriately lavish: Naworth Castle was sumptuously furnished with large quantities of gold and silver plate, numerous carpets, cushions, and hangings, including eight &#145;large peaces of hanginges of the story of Julius Caesar&#146;, and others in red &#145;set with my lordes armes and cognysaunce&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/84, p. 6). In 1541/2 Dacre bought 104 yards of &#145;London tawny&#146; red cloth for the livery of his servants. His table was similarly supplied with all manner of fish, meat, and wine: in 1529/30 Dacre purchased pepper, sugar, currants, green ginger, &#145;suketts&#146;, biscuits, &#145;marmulet&#146;, comfits, and nutmegs in London, and his household accounts for 1541/2 also list prunes, almonds, cinnamon, and liquorice. No wonder, then, that Bishop Best of Carlisle could describe him as &#145;something too mighty in this country and as it were a prince&#146;  (Bouch, 200&#150;01).<br>
