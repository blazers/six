<span class="headword">Venables,  Clare Rosamund</span>  (1943&#150;2003), <span class="occ">theatre director</span>, was born on 17 March 1943 at 33 Lindisfarne Avenue, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, the younger daughter and third of the four children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31786/', "Sir Percy Frederick Ronald (Peter) Venables (1904&#150;1979)")</script>, educationist, and first pro-chancellor of the Open University, and his wife, Ethel Craig, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Howell (<i>b</i>. 1906), educational psychologist, and first chair of the Marriage Guidance Council. She was educated at Manchester high school and King Edward VI School, Camp Hill, Birmingham, before going to Manchester University. She initially read English but changed to drama after a year, was awarded a first, and was immediately employed as an assistant lecturer in the department. She worked there alongside Stephen Joseph for three years before leaving to begin a career in theatre in 1968, first working in repertory at the Leicester Phoenix, then getting her first directing job at the Theatre Royal, Lincoln, under Philip Hedley. Her success in the theatre every bit as swift as her success in academia, she took over from Hedley as artistic director in the early 1970s before moving on to the Library Theatre, Manchester, in 1973. On 27 May 1971 she married Robert Norman Whelan, a 24-year-old actor, and son of Ronald Whelan, civil servant. They had one son, Joe (<i>b</i>. 1978).<br>
<br>Venables became artistic director of the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, in 1977. Inevitably her appointment drew comparisons with Joan Littlewood. Indeed, Venables shared her predecessor's indomitable spirit and her determination to engage with the community. As well as being an inspired director, Venables was an astute manager, administrator, and committee member, and during her brief tenure at Stratford East she negotiated a huge rise in local authority subsidy (from &pound;3000 to &pound;30,000) and supervised the sale of the theatre building from Joan Littlewood to the theatre board.<br>
<br>On leaving Stratford East in 1979, Venables pursued a freelance career, before becoming artistic director of the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield in 1981. On her appointment she told <span class="italic">The Guardian</span>: &#145;I'll be working with the community and for young people, which is what I like doing. I'll also be doing big shows&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 14 Dec 1981). At the Crucible she was able to put into practice her passion for establishing performance at the heart of community life without being constantly compared to Littlewood. She engineered collaborations with the local art gallery and trade unions, as well as continuing the tradition of welcoming amateur dramatics groups and incorporating amateur operatics and youth theatre. The Crucible's repertoire included little-known European plays, American musicals, and new writing. With Steven Pimlott she directed the British premi&egrave;re of <span class="italic">Carmen Jones</span>, and Botho Strauss's <span class="italic">The Park</span>, and brought <span class="italic">Lennon</span> from Liverpool, adapted it for Sheffield, then took it into the West End. She also found space for a range of touring companies: Paines Plough, Shared Experience, Hull Truck, and the feminist theatre group Monstrous Regiment (the start of an association with the latter that saw Venables translate the Finnish play <span class="italic">The Love Story of the Century</span> for the company and ended with her becoming artistic director in 1991 when she left the Crucible). The range of writers and companies for whom she provided a platform was matched only by the new generation of theatre workers she encouraged, among them Michael Boyd, Stephen Daldry, Martin Duncan, Tom Cairns, and Steven Pimlott. During her time at Sheffield she also served on the Arts Council drama panel with fellow regional theatre mavericks Peter Cheeseman, Alan Ayckbourn, and Philip Hedley, constantly pushing for more investment in, and recognition of, the work done by the regions.<br>
<br>Venables was involved in the 1986 Arts Council's inquiry into professional theatre in England which led to the report &#145;Theatre is for all&#146;, a sentiment that sums up Venables's belief in the inclusive and enriching properties of participation in the performing arts. After she left Sheffield she continued to act on this belief, as founding director of the Actors Training Centre, and as principal of the BRIT School of Performing Arts (1995&#150;9). At the same time she adapted and translated classical plays and embarked on a career directing opera: <span class="italic">The Magic Flute</span> for Opera Northern Ireland (where the chorus consisted of forty protestant and forty Catholic children), <span class="italic">Cos&igrave; fan tutte</span> for English Touring Opera in 1995, <span class="italic">The Marriage of Figaro</span> in Sweden, and an operatic adaptation of Steven Berkoff's <span class="italic">Greek</span> at the Barbican in 2003. In 1999 she became director of education at the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). As well as implementing the digitization of the company's archives and introducing online resources for teachers and students, she brokered the creation of groundbreaking partnerships with the universities of Michigan and Columbia and the Kennedy Centre in Washington, running summer schools with RSC staff and American students. She also engineered the RSC's collaboration with the homeless people's theatre company Cardboard Citizens on a production of <span class="italic">Pericles</span> in 2003 which she described as &#145;a wonderful way for us to put together the artist at the centre of British culture with those who are most marginalised by that culture&#146;  (<span class="italic">Arts Hub</span>).<br>
<br>Venables died of breast cancer at Myton Hamlet Hospice, Myton Lane, Warwick, on 17 October 2003. A month before she died she was the first recipient of the Young Vic award, honouring theatre professionals who had inspired a generation of young theatre practitioners. David Lan, artistic director of the Young Vic, paid tribute to Venables's dedication and passion for theatre and education: &#145;A whole generation of theatre makers are the children of Clare's wit, compassion and adventurousness, her strength of purpose and her tremendous, unquenchable sense of fun&#146;  (Young Vic press release). She was survived by her son, Joe.<br>
