<span class="headword">Hurst,  John Gilbert</span>  (1927&#150;2003), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 15 August 1927 at the Brunswick Nursing Home, Cambridge, the only son of Charles Chamberlain Hurst (1870&#150;1947), a plant geneticist (who had served as a major with the Royal Engineers during the First World War) and his wife and cousin, Rona, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hurst, a botanist. At the time of his birth his parents lived at Annesley House, Union Road, Cambridge. From them he acquired a lifelong interest in plants and gardening, and a practice of scientific record-keeping. He was educated in Horsham (Sussex), at Harrow School, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He had first read about the archaeology of the Middle East as a schoolboy, and before going up to Cambridge his period of national service took him to that region. His Cambridge archaeology degree course (in 1948&#150;51) was focused principally on prehistory, without much emphasis on practical skills. Enterprising students, Hurst among them, excavated on their own initiative, and especially on sites of the medieval period, which were not then academically fashionable. At Cambridge he met (Dorothy) Gillian Duckett (1931&#150;1971), daughter of John Arthur Duckett, civil servant, and they married on 26 April 1955. She excavated sites and assisted in the early development of the Society for Medieval Archaeology. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>From 1952 to 1987 Hurst worked in the inspectorate of ancient monuments, first as part of the Ministry of Works, but latterly within English Heritage. He became inspector (medieval rescue excavations) in 1964, principal inspector (rescue excavations) in 1973, and assistant chief inspector in 1980. In the inspectorate he exercised great influence over the development of medieval archaeology, by selecting the most important sites for excavation, and by recruiting talented excavators who could recognize and recover the evidence, such as the often flimsy traces of timber buildings. His constant round of visits enabled him to observe different sites over the whole country, and to acquire an encyclopaedic knowledge (recorded on index cards) of medieval and post-medieval pottery. Alongside his official duties he pursued a parallel career as a researcher into pottery, and he also directed excavations at Northolt manor house near London (1950&#150;70), and at Wharram Percy in Yorkshire. The programme of research at Wharram, a medieval village, which began in 1952, was part of the work of the Deserted Medieval Village Research Group. Under the leadership of Hurst (who served as secretary from 1952 to 1986) and the historian Maurice Beresford this organization pursued the goal of listing every deserted village in England.<br>
<br>Much of Hurst's research was carried out as part of some collective enquiry. While many of his papers in learned journals (often studies of pottery) were written solely by him, lengthier works appeared under joint authorship. In the field of village research the two best-known were produced in conjunction with Maurice Beresford, his collaborator for half a century: <span class="italic">Deserted Medieval Villages: Studies</span> (1971), and <span class="italic">Wharram Percy: Deserted Medieval Village</span> (1990). In pottery studies, <span class="italic">Medieval Pottery from Excavations</span> (1974) was edited jointly with Vera Evison and Henry Hodges, and <span class="italic">Pottery Produced and Traded in North-West Europe, 1350&#150;1650</span> (1986) with David Neal and H. J. E. van Beuningen.<br>
<br>Hurst gave numerous lectures for university adult education departments. His long-running series of seminars at Goldsmiths College in London provided a unique training in medieval archaeology and especially medieval pottery. His style of teaching was rather formal, but he had important things to say, and his enthusiasm and learning ensured that students valued the experience. Although his work as an inspector, his research, excavations, and teaching imposed heavy demands on him, he made the time to be active in many societies. He played a key role in organizing the Society for Medieval Archaeology (founded in 1957) and the Society for Post-Medieval Archaeology (in 1967), and later served as president of both societies. He promoted archaeology within the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He had many contacts in continental Europe, and went on tours to meet colleagues with similar interests. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1958, and of the British Academy in 1987. The Society of Antiquaries, which he served as vice-president in 1969&#150;73, awarded him its society medal in the year that he died. The University of York made him an honorary DPhil in 1995. He was presented on retirement with two collections of essays, one on rural settlements (shared with Maurice Beresford), and the other on pottery studies.<br>
<br>Although he was a private and quiet man, and at meetings or conferences often made few (but always pertinent) comments, Hurst's work was carried out in co-operation with others, and he played an important role in a number of academic movements of the second half of the twentieth century. With his help, medieval and post-medieval archaeology were accepted as integral, even indispensable parts of a discipline which before 1950 had been dominated by classicists and prehistorians. His influence brought to the forefront of medieval archaeology the material culture of the peasant and the potter, the ordinary people of the time rather than the inhabitants of the castles and monasteries. He saw himself as a scientist, and applied to medieval sites the methods used to investigate prehistory. He realized, partly through contact with Danish scholars, that the open area method of excavation enabled medieval sites to be better understood, and within a short time this was accepted universally. He applied systematic and rigorous analysis to pottery studies, and early in his career he identified the main types of pre-conquest pottery in eastern England, which enabled sites of all kinds to be dated. His approach was cautious and measured, and he was reluctant to arrive at a conclusion until he was sure of his ground. Like a true scientist, if an old hypothesis was not supported by the evidence, he abandoned it and put forward a new one. In the fifty years of the Wharram research project&#151;which was a test bed for ideas about medieval settlement in general&#151;the interpretation changed more than once, and Hurst would recall ruefully the outmoded thinking of the past. He set in motion fruitful debates about peasant houses, the origins and evolution of villages, and the landscape of settlement.<br>
<br>After retirement from English Heritage Hurst moved to Great Casterton in Lincolnshire, and was still very active in research when in March 2003 he was attacked in the street. He died from head injuries at Peterborough District Hospital after six weeks in intensive care, on 29 April 2003. A cremation service was held in Leicester on 30 May 2003. He was survived by his two daughters.<br>
