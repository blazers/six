<span class="headword">O'Hagan,  Henry Osborne</span>  (1853&#150;1930), <span class="occ">company promoter</span>, was born on 18 March 1853 at Blackburn, Lancashire, one of at least two sons of Henry O'Hagan, a civil engineer of Ulster origins, who had married at Chatham in 1846 Emily, daughter of Charles Buchanan, bootmaker. He was educated at Rochester grammar school and privately at Streatham. At the age of fifteen Osborne O'Hagan (as he was usually known) began his City career as a clerk at a weekly salary of 10<i>s</i>. in a firm promoting private acts of parliament for railways and other public works. In 1874, when just twenty-one, he was prosecuted with J. S. Muir on a charge of obtaining &pound;30,000 by false pretences by attempting to sell a colliery in Cumberland for &pound;90,000 when the asking price was &pound;60,000. He claimed that there were other intermediaries in the deal, to whom &pound;30,000 was to be paid. <span class="italic">The Times</span> reported on 9 June: &#145;The Foreman of the Jury, addressing the Bench, said they could not say the prisoners were not guilty. The Recorder said there was no evidence to prove their guilt, the jury had no option but to acquit them.&#146;<br>
<br>Afterwards O'Hagan became a company promoter specializing in tramways, collieries, and breweries. He does not seem to have gulled investors flagrantly: he converted mainly worthwhile concerns into public companies and tried to ensure a capital structure which would not wreck the prospects of each business by imposing a burden of long-term indebtedness on profits. His reputation for shrewd even-handedness was such that he was employed as an arbitrator in financial disputes involving such major figures as Weetman Pearson (later Lord Cowdray). For his part in the flotation of International Tea Stores in 1895 for H. E. Kearley, later Viscount Devonport, he typically received commission of &pound;40,000.<br>
<br>In 1882 O'Hagan founded the City of London Contract Corporation, which was henceforth the main vehicle for his promotions. Although O'Hagan was chairman, most of the company's shares were held by discerning ordinary investors, as the company paid annual dividends varying from 15 to 60 per cent. Having become interested in various American businesses, particularly railroads, stockyards, cold storage, and meat wholesaling, O'Hagan formed the London and Chicago Contract Corporation in 1890. A convivial man, with a taste for music and theatricals of the cheerier sort, in 1889 he took a shareholding in Ronaschers, which controlled a Viennese hotel, restaurant, caf&eacute;, ballroom, and concert hall. This was one of many of his investments which suffered during the First World War.<br>
<br>O'Hagan's most important contribution to financial history was his popularization of underwriting for home industrial issues. This meant that he and his corporation acted as an issuing house in the public flotation of companies. Adapting the system prevalent in the foreign loan market since the 1860s, the capital to be underwritten in each promotion was put out by O'Hagan on a commission basis to brokers. As a result, the vendor was safeguarded from losses if the public failed to take up the issue of shares. With the removal of this risk for the vendor, many companies were encouraged to seek capital from the investing public. O'Hagan's system was important because until 1900 legislation precluded companies from issuing shares at a discount or paying commission to anyone taking up their shares.<br>
<br>In 1900 O'Hagan attempted what was to be a final master stroke before retirement, the amalgamation of all Britain's cement companies. By mischance the flotation of Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers coincided with a market crash on receiving the news of the Boxer uprising in China. As a result, &pound;2.2 million of the shares were not subscribed, and O'Hagan himself claimed to have been left responsible for &pound;1.25 million. He took five months to cover this amount: friends took &pound;400,000 of debentures and preference shares and he took &pound;840,000 in ordinary shares. Although he had hitherto usually refused the distraction of outside directorships, he became vice-chairman of Associated Portland Cement and a managing director of British Portland Cement. These companies took most of his attention for twenty years, but he severed his links after vainly opposing a bold post-war expansion.<br>
<br>O'Hagan married in 1878 Elizabeth, daughter of John Philpot Jones, architect. He had one son, Henry Osborne O'Hagan (1882&#150;1938), and an adopted daughter, Gladys; but his liking for the company of actresses, and interest in rescuing prostitutes, suggest a loud and restless bonhomie little suited to domestic happiness. It can be presumed that in later years he was estranged from his wife. For many years O'Hagan kept apartments at The Albany, and a villa, &#145;Riverhome&#146;, near Hampton Court, where he stored his collection of ancient coins, snuff boxes, and medals. Until 1919 he was president of the Thames Angling Preservation Society. He retired in 1924 to a villa at Roquebrune Cap Martin on the French riviera, where he indulged his taste for yachting. John Lane published two volumes of O'Hagan's memoirs entitled <span class="italic">Leaves from my Life</span> in 1929. They were written from memory, and may contain inaccuracies, but they constitute a rich, vivid source on a crucial epoch of British financial history: his feel for people and events was astute, even when self-serving. O'Hagan died suddenly after a long illness on 3 May 1930 at his French villa, Casa del Mare, Roquebrune Cap Martin, Alpes Maritimes.<br>
<br>Osborne O'Hagan was an energetic, domineering, obese, vainglorious man who enjoyed his luxuries and was a hearty trencherman. He was a wily and tenacious litigant, and could be an implacable enemy, but there are many signs of sly good nature in his memoirs. He was full of little jokes, often premeditated, to jolly along his business dealings, and had few illusions about his fellow men.<br>
