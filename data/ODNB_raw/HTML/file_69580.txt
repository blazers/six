<span class="headword">Fenning,  Daniel</span>  (1714/15&#150;1767), <span class="occ">grammarian and textbook writer</span>, is of unknown parentage. On 3 July 1735 he married Mary Mott (<i>d</i>. 1780) at Great Cornard in Suffolk, and the couple lived at nearby Bures, where Fenning was licensed to teach on 25 October 1740. There were twelve children, of whom seven were born at Bures. About 1747 or 1748 the family moved to Whitechapel, London. Fenning seems to have given up schoolmastering to work for the Royal Exchange Assurance Company, to the governors and directors of which he dedicated <span class="italic">The Young Algebraist's Companion</span> (1750), the earliest of his textbooks that can be dated with any certainty.<br>
<br>Altogether Fenning wrote or contributed to some fourteen books on various subjects, including algebra, arithmetic, and geography. He is best remembered for his textbooks on the English language. He began to compile <span class="italic">The Universal Spelling Book, or, A New and Easy Guide to the English Language</span> (1756) as early as 1739, while still teaching at Bures, though it was not published for nearly twenty years. It contained a short grammar, as did <span class="italic">The Royal Dictionary, or, A Treasury of the English Language</span> (1761), dedicated to George III and published by his &#145;authority&#146;. These two brief grammars are not identical, and different again is the fuller grammar prefixed to <span class="italic">The New and Complete Spelling Dictionary and Sure Guide to the English Language</span> (1767). The grammar in <span class="italic">The Royal English Dictionary</span> is, however, identical with three grammars published later in the 1760s, whose authors seem to have copied Fenning.<br>
<br>Fenning's major linguistic work, <span class="italic">A New Grammar of the English Language</span> (1771), which was published posthumously, refers to the grammars of both Priestley and Lowth, indicating that he kept abreast of recent studies. He followed the tradition of the time in avoiding a too rigid imposition of Latin structure on English, and he continued to revise and refine his ideas about the English language throughout his life. In his own day Fenning was probably best-known for his <span class="italic">Universal Spelling Book</span>. It was reprinted in about 100 editions up to 1860, and was used extensively in America. Many of Fenning's other textbooks also continued to be printed and revised well into the nineteenth century. He died of consumption aged fifty-two at Great Garden Street, Whitechapel, and was buried on 31 August 1767 at St Mary's Church, Whitechapel.<br>
