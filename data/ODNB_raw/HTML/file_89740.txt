</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Amies, Sir  (Edwin) Hardy</span>  (1909&#150;2003), <span class="occ">dressmaker and fashion designer</span>, was born on 17 July 1909 at 70 Delaware Mansions, Elgin Avenue, Maida Vale, London, the elder son and eldest of the three children of Herbert William Amies, a surveyor for London county council who later became the council's principal resident agent for the Beacontree housing estate, and his first wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hardy (<i>d</i>. 1938), who worked as a saleswoman for London court dressmakers until the birth of her daughter and second child in 1915.<h2>
<a name="Familyeducationandearlycareer"></a>Family, education, and early career</h2>Hardy Amies came from a modest middle-class background and grew up in a suburban environment. His early years, when the family lived in Middlesex, were uneventful. He was close to his maternal grandmother, whom he credited with an artistic sensibility and admired for her energy and resourcefulness, and to his mother, who he felt had a natural sense of quality and had enjoyed a successful business career in spite of her shyness and lack of confidence. He attended Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith as a day boy from 1918 to 1920, when his family moved to Barking for his father to take up his appointment at Beacontree. He then became a boarding pupil at Brentwood School until 1926. His schooling left a favourable impression on him and although he had no talent for field sports he made his mark on the stage in school theatricals and learned what he considered the invaluable knack of getting on with people. English was his best subject.<br>
<br>When he left school Amies wanted to become a journalist and on the advice of R. D. Blumenfeld, the editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Express</span>, he went abroad to learn French and German from 1927 until mid-1930 instead of taking a university degree. He mastered both languages and came back from Germany, where he worked as a sales agent for a small but ambitious ceramic wall tile factory, with an enthusiasm for travel and music, and an interest in business. He then joined W. and T. Avery in Birmingham, selling industrial weighing machines in the hope that he might be posted abroad, but three years later an unexpected job offer changed the direction of his career. A vivid description of a dress written by Amies prompted a former employer of his mother to offer him the post of designer at Lachasse, a sportswear shop in Mayfair. Undeterred by his complete ignorance of practical dressmaking, Amies boldly seized the opportunity.<h2>
<a name="DesigningatLachasse"></a>Designing at Lachasse</h2>Lachasse had been set up in 1928 as an offshoot of Gray and Paulette Ltd. The firm specialized in made-to-measure tailoring and classic casual clothes. When Amies joined in January 1934 he replaced the designer Digby Morton, whom Amies credited with reformulating the suit, creating a versatile and feminine garment chic enough to wear in London but sufficiently sporty and understated for smart country events. Amies followed his lead and was promoted to managing designer in 1935. He learned from Morton and from the skilled workforce at Lachasse and was soon rewarded by export orders from the United States of America, where London-designed clothes were in demand. British <span class="italic">Vogue</span> (in April 1937) praised Amies's use of traditional woollen fabrics and his facility with colour and pattern, which injected wit and novelty into his designs, but noted the comparatively static line of his suits which by the late 1930s incorporated the slightly low waist that became a characteristic of his style.<br>
<br>Amies's evolutionary approach was just what his upper-class English customers wanted. They were looking for clothes that were in tune with fashion but would work for them over a number of years, that were smart and stylish but not ostentatious, and that were perfectly fitted and immaculately made, comfortable, and hard-wearing. In order to sustain and build Lachasse, Amies had to understand the values and lifestyle of the firm's clientele. He was helped by his friends Alexis and Ann ffrench, who, he said, &#145;guided [him] out of the styles and habits of [his] middle-class upbringing into the idiom of English upper-class life&#146; (<span class="italic">Still Here</span>, 166), and by the interior decorator and eighteenth-century specialist, John Fowler. Social acceptability was important to Amies professionally and personally. Clients at Lachasse included society figures such as Mrs Ernest Guinness and the actresses Celia Johnson, Heather Thatcher, and Virginia Cherrill.<br>
<br>The designer whom Hardy Amies most admired was Captain Edward Molyneux, whose meticulously constructed clothes were characterized by their severe elegance and expensive-looking simplicity, lightened by a subtle use of colour and detail. Molyneux was good-looking and socially as well as professionally successful. His strikingly decorated Paris flat was featured in the news media and he enjoyed the luxuries of a wealthy man. Amies was also elegant and debonair, with a taste for good living, and like Molyneux he was to prove a highly successful businessman.<h2>
<a name="Thewaryears"></a>The war years</h2>By 1939 turnover at Lachasse had doubled, but Amies's request to design under his own name was rebuffed. Restless and frustrated, he found that the Second World War offered an escape and a new challenge. In 1939 he joined the intelligence corps before transferring in 1941 to the Special Operations Executive, where in November he joined the Belgian section as training and recruiting officer. He was promoted major in 1942, and became acting section head in August 1943 and head in January 1944, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Although aware that his was a &#145;soft&#146; war in comparison with that of others, it was still a &#145;bitter&#146; experience that he felt affected his character  (<span class="italic">Just So Far</span>, 91, 94, 99). In 1946 he was nominated an officier de l'ordre de la Couronne by the Belgian government for his war service.<br>
<br>Amies had left Lachasse in 1941 but maintained a commercial presence in London during the war selling under his own name through the house of Worth, and designing for projects that fed into the war effort to raise money through exports. The Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers, which was set up in 1942 to promote and support the interests of London couture, and of which Amies was a founding member, played a key role in the export drive. Membership of the society would later offer him important public relations and export opportunities. He was co-vice-chairman of the society with Victor Stiebel in 1954 and with Digby Morton in 1955, and chairman in 1959&#150;60.<h2>
<a name="SavileRow"></a>Savile Row</h2>Following his demobilization, Amies lost no time in setting up his own fashion house, buying the lease of 14 Savile Row, which had once been home to the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan, and which lay in the heart of London's West End tailoring district. Hardy Amies Ltd was incorporated on 28 December 1945. Amies recruited experienced staff from Lachasse and Worth, and in 1947 he was the first London couturier to employ a press officer. The publicity material generated by the house emphasized its Englishness and its youthful, progressive approach, qualities that Amies personified in his appearance and attitude.<br>
<br>In the immediate post-war years Amies concentrated on developing his business in London and bolstering his commercial links with department stores in the USA and Canada. Acutely aware of the competition couture faced from high quality ready-to-wear, he launched a boutique line in 1950 with a three-point selling plan aimed at export buyers, selected retail provincial buyers, and the general public. The boutique line included ready-wear coats, suits, dresses, and jackets that were offered with one fitting instead of the traditional three included in the price. Although made from similar materials to a couture suit, a boutique suit was designed with fewer details and less handwork and cost approximately 50 per cent less. By 1952 the boutique line accounted for a third of the company's turnover. Three years later Amies moved into ready-to-wear, offering tailored clothes in traditional fabrics but at a lower price point. In 1958 Kenneth (Ken) Fleetwood (1934&#150;1996), who was a graduate of St Martin's School of Art and Design, joined the house. He eventually became head designer, specializing in romantic evening gowns and bridal wear. In 1968 he and Amies designed the costumes for Stanley Kubrick's film <span class="italic">2001, a Space Odyssey</span>. In his private life he was Amies's partner.<h2>
<a name="Designingforthequeen"></a>Designing for the queen</h2>Amies received his first orders from Princess Elizabeth, the future Queen Elizabeth II, in 1950, when she selected a small group of clothes for her Canadian tour. He went on to make clothes for her 1951 and 1953 overseas tours and in 1955 he successfully applied for a royal warrant. This was the start of a long relationship that brought immense prestige to the house and gave Amies enormous personal satisfaction. The queen's patronage brought him international standing, attracted clients at home and abroad, and guaranteed his acceptability in the highest echelons of society. He created a lasting image for the queen that reflected her rank and dignity and enhanced her presence without distancing her from the public. His patriotism and knowledge of history served him well in his role as royal dressmaker. His services to the queen were recognized in 1977 with appointment as CVO and in 1989 with a knighthood (as KCVO). He also designed for Diana, princess of Wales, and Princess Michael of Kent. Other clients included the duchess of Buccleuch, the duchess of Marlborough, Lady Diana Cooper, Diana, Lady Delamere, Vivien Leigh, Mrs Julian Fellowes, and Sally Burton.<br>
<br>The longevity of Amies's career, which encompassed a huge shift in women's fashion from the polite, well-mannered clothes of the 1950s to the fast changing, youth-oriented styles of later decades, was rightly seen as one of the designer's greatest achievements. He owed his survival to his shrewd business sense and to his willingness to innovate and diversify. He continued to make the occasion-specific, refined, classic couture clothes that his core clientele demanded, but he capitalized on the skills of his staff to build up a thriving ready-to-wear business and, crucially, to move into menswear.<h2>
<a name="Menswear"></a>Menswear</h2>Menswear was also changing in the 1950s and 1960s and there was an increasing demand for more informal, youthful styles with a fashionable edge. In 1958 Amies started designing silk ties for Michelsons. He went on to work for such firms as Radiac, designing high-quality cotton shirts, but his breakthrough came in 1961 when he was invited to become a design consultant for Hepworths, the Leeds-based, middle-market, multiple tailoring group. Designing menswear gave Amies more freedom to express his taste and the opportunity to design for men born into a socio-economic class similar to his own. He wanted men to enjoy clothes and feel confident and at ease in them, and he wrote his short but pithy <span class="italic">ABC of Men's Fashion</span> (1964) to help them, and especially young men, achieve this. Amies admired the casual, athletic styles sold in America and the body conscious but tasteful clothing the Italians excelled at, and he tried to incorporate these qualities into the classic English suits he designed for Hepworths. His aim, which he felt he achieved, was to bridge the gap between Savile Row and the high street. By 1964 the annual turnover of his menswear was about &pound;15 million, compared with &pound;0.75 million for womenswear. His success led to a string of licensee agreements selling menswear and some womenswear across the world from Canada and the USA to Australia and the Far East.<br>
<br>In 1973 Amies sold Hardy Amies Ltd to Debenhams to generate capital and to develop the ready-to-wear business. The venture was not a success, and Amies bought the business back in 1980. He continued to play an active role in the company into his late eighties but in May 2001 he sold Hardy Amies Ltd to Cardington plc (the company was subsequently re-named the Luxury Brands Group). The couture house came with licences in forty-four product categories and 160 trademarks around the world. Amies finally retired at the end of 2001, aged ninety-two.<h2>
<a name="Acareerinfashion"></a>A career in fashion</h2>Amies believed that his contribution to the history of women's fashion was to &#145;help create the British suit, the London suit, when it was a fashion commodity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 January 1984). His design aesthetic reflected his respect for tradition and the controlled informality and understated elegance of English style, but Amies lived for the present. The greatest influences on his work were sportswear and athleticism, and while appearance and manners were important to him, he had a very rational approach to dress. When the straight jacket came back into fashion for women in the early 1950s, he commented, &#145;Underneath that straight jacket there is an impression of a very youthful and lithe body, but also a feeling of freedom, of being able to get around and cope with life, with shopping and housing and husband problems, and so on. In other words it is an expression of this day and age&#146;  (H. Amies, <span class="italic">Wool in Fashion</span>, 1954). In his old age he lost touch with the pulse of contemporary fashion, misunderstanding the creative drivers that informed it, and disliking what he considered the blatant over-exposure of the body.<br>
<br>Amies was internationally recognized, and during his long career he received many honours. He won the <span class="italic">Harper's Bazaar</span> award in 1962 and in 1964 he received the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> special award, the <span class="italic">Ambassador Magazine</span> award, and was elected a royal designer for industry. He became a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1965 and in 1989 he won the British Fashion Council hall of fame award. He was a talented writer and published two engaging and informative autobiographies, <span class="italic">Just So Far</span> (1954) and <span class="italic">Still Here</span> (1984), which he followed in 1994 with <span class="italic">The Englishman's Suit</span>. He had great curiosity and was well read, teaching himself about history, art, and music. He also took great pleasure in his homes, particularly the Old School at Langford, his house in the Cotswolds, where he created a beautiful garden planted to reflect the seasons like &#145;an opera in four acts&#146;  (<span class="italic">World of Interiors</span>, April 2002). He was a keen and competitive tennis player, but also enjoyed the more reflective pastime of needlepoint.<br>
<br>Hardy Amies had a complex personality. He was patronizing, arrogant, pompous, and notoriously snobbish, but he was also quick-witted and intelligent, thoughtful, amusing, and excellent company. He was not an innovative designer and he set style above fashion. He was primarily a businessman with the intelligence, vigour, and discipline to be alert to change and to embrace new markets. His achievement was to run a profitable and professional global business on the back of his well-deserved reputation for creating refined, wearable, and skilfully made couture clothes. Known to the world as the queen's dressmaker and (by the end of his career) London's longest-surviving couturier, his contribution to the menswear industry was equally significant. He died of old age on 5 March 2003 at his home, The Old School, Langford, near Lechlade, Gloucestershire. He was cremated and his ashes interred in a plot at St Matthew's Church, Langford. His partner, Ken Fleetwood, predeceased him.<br>
