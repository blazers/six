<span class="headword">Stewart,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1490&#150;1545), <span class="occ">ecclesiastical administrator and bishop of Aberdeen</span>, was the son of Sir Thomas Stewart of Minto, Roxburghshire, and Isabella, daughter of Sir Walter Stewart and Janet Cameron of Arthurlie, Renfrewshire. He was born in Glasgow and educated at its university, before proceeding abroad to study canon law and theology. Successively vicar of Lochmaben and rector of Ayr, he was elected dean of Glasgow on 21 January 1531, being then described as about forty years old. He had, however, already been called to parliament by then as a lord of council, and had been appointed lord high treasurer of Scotland on 2 October 1530, which office he held until 4 June 1537, and with it the provostry of Lincluden, to which he had been presented in expectation in 1529. On the death of Gavin Dunbar, bishop of Aberdeen, on 10 March 1532, James V urged Clement VII to appoint Stewart as his successor. Accordingly the pope provided him to the see on 13 November of that year, and Stewart was consecrated at St Machar's Cathedral some time between 22 March and 10 April 1533. From the sources still available it is clear that the confidence placed in his abilities by the crown and papacy at this time was justified: his accounts throughout his treasurership were scrupulously presented, and he regularly attended parliamentary sessions and served prudently on the committees to which he was assigned. Despite the unstable political relationship between James V and Henry VIII throughout the whole of this period, he successfully concluded a peace treaty between their respective countries in London on 11 May 1534. The treaty was ratified by both monarchs in June and August of that year, and in December 1541 Stewart was again called by James to arrange a meeting between the two kings in York on 15 January 1542 to resolve the continuing depredations being committed on the English border. Stewart also served as ambassador to France, on 6 March 1536 being one of the commissioners who drew up the contract for King James's marriage to Mary of Guise.<br>
<br>As for his work as bishop of Aberdeen, the same integrity and careful attention to detail may equally be discerned throughout the twelve difficult years of Stewart's episcopate. He firmly resisted heresy in his diocese, and is recorded as attending the condemnation of heretics in 1534 and 1540. His constitutions of 1537 and 1540 for his cathedral clergy reinforced those meticulously laid down by Bishop William Elphinstone in 1506. He was a friend to the Franciscans of Aberdeen, but for reasons of jurisdiction his relations with the Benedictines and Augustinians in his diocese were often troubled. As chancellor of the University of Aberdeen, Stewart completed the building programme at King's College planned by his predecessors, and added its library, sacristy, and jewel house; he was a generous benefactor to its chapel, and actively encouraged the advancement of humanist studies within the university. Writing in March 1532, James V described Stewart as &#145;a man whose qualities and industry speak for themselves&#146;  (Hannay, <span class="italic">Letters</span>, 217). Stewart died on 10 April 1545 and was buried in the south transept of St Machar's Cathedral.<br>
