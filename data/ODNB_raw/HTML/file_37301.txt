<span class="headword">Colebrooke, Sir  George</span>, second baronet  (1729&#150;1809), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born on 14 June 1729 in Chilham, Kent, the youngest in the family of three sons and seven daughters of James Colebrooke, a London banker, and his wife, Mary Hudson. He was educated at the University of Leiden between 1747 and 1749, and then entered the family's banking business, where he was left in sole control after the deaths of his father and brother James. He inherited a large fortune from them and succeeded his brother James as second baronet in 1761. In 1754 he married Mary, daughter of Patrick Gaynor of Antigua. They had three sons and three daughters, the youngest son being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5866/', "Henry Thomas Colebrooke")</script>, who became a noted Sanskrit scholar. George Colebrook gained election as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and was appointed as chirographer to the court of common pleas in 1766.<br>
<br>A key figure in the world of high finance, Colebrooke sat in the Commons as MP for Arundel between 1754 and 1774, and close links with Thomas Pelham-Holles, first duke of Newcastle, secured him a number of lucrative government contracts. This led to involvement in a wide range of speculative projects throughout Europe, North America, and the West Indies, and the huge resources at his disposal enabled him to embark on a vigorous attempt to secure control over the affairs of the East India Company. He was elected a director of the rapidly expanding company in 1767, and was appointed deputy chairman the following year. He served as chairman in 1769, 1770, and 1772, and was thus at the centre of public attention at a crucial stage in Anglo-Asian relations. His decisions and negotiations with the government shaped the manner in which the British crown extended its control over both the company and its Indian possessions, a process which culminated in the passing of the <span class="roman">Regulating Act</span> of 1773. But this success was tempered by the fact that Colebrooke's period in office coincided with the company's financial collapse, and for this he was heavily criticized. At the same time his own business affairs fell into disarray. He became financially involved on his own account in lead and alum mines and speculated heavily and unwisely in raw materials, principally hemp, flax, and logwood. In 1771 he lost &pound;190,000 on a speculation in hemp and then failed in an attempt to corner the world market in alum. His bank closed its doors on 31 March 1773, much of his property was sold in 1774, to be followed by his extensive library and print collection. In 1777 he was declared bankrupt and he departed to live in Boulogne, where his poverty was charitably relieved by a small East India Company pension.<br>
<br>By 1789 Colebrooke was back in England, living in Bath, with some of his property having been restored. He died on 5 August 1809 in Batheaston. Much lampooned in the press, Colebrooke was a rather pompous, self-important man who considered himself to be the second most influential politician in England. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his second son, James Edward (<i>b</i>. 1761), his eldest son having died in April 1809.<br>
