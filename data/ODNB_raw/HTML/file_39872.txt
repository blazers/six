<span class="headword">Kirkley, Sir  (Howard) Leslie</span>  (1911&#150;1989), <span class="occ">charity director</span>, was born on 13 March 1911 in Manchester, the youngest in the family of two sons and one daughter of Albert Kirkley, a Manchester schoolmaster, and his wife, Elizabeth Winifred Harris. He matriculated from Manchester Central High School, qualified in Manchester's local government examinations, and became an associate of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries. His early career in local government stirred a growing interest in politics which was reinforced by his staunchly Liberal father and by visits to the Rhondda, which was then suffering from the depression. His consequent involvement with social welfare issues at home was matched by concern for peace abroad. An active organizer for the Peace Pledge Union, he registered as a conscientious objector with unconditional exemption. In 1940 Manchester council decided to sack registered conscientious objectors and Kirkley lost his job. It was a moment of truth which revealed his commitment, courage, and unyielding refusal to compromise on matters of principle.<br>
<br>A number of jobs followed before Kirkley's appointment in 1942 as regional secretary for the Fellowship of Reconciliation based in Leeds. Here he became a founder member and honorary secretary to the Leeds European relief committee, sending food to war-torn Greece and, following the war, clothing to Germany and Austria. After the war came his first direct and successful experience of running a business, for the Quaker painting and decorating firm of Harry Seel. A secure future seemed assured when, in 1951, recruited by Cecil Jackson-Cole, he moved to Oxford to become general secretary to the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief, one of whose founders was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40000/', "T. R. Milford")</script>. Over the next twenty-four years he transformed this small local committee into a leading national and international organization.<br>
<br>The transformation began with the committee's involvement in disaster relief after the Greek earthquake in 1953. There followed help to refugees: victims of the Korean war, the Chinese civil war, the Hungarian uprising, and the Algerian war, and displaced Palestinians. Kirkley's personal visits to disaster areas, and the committee's high-profile role, together with the pioneering use of professional fund-raising methods, achieved rapid growth. As chairman of the World Refugee Year's public relations and publicity committee, Kirkley visited Congo (1961), and the huge public response which the plight of the starving refugees invoked catapulted his organization&#151;which in 1961 became Oxfam, with Kirkley as its first director&#151;into the role of a major medium for prompt disaster relief.<br>
<br>The 1960s saw Oxfam move into long-term development work with a network of field staff. Kirkley played a key role within the freedom from hunger campaign (1960&#150;65) and consequently became interested in the causes of poverty. He began to campaign for a new interpretation of charity to include the examination of the causes of hunger and poverty as well as their relief. This soon brought complaints from the Charity Commission. Kirkley doggedly stood firm and successfully moved the frontier forward with his skilful and non-confrontational approach. His leadership also achieved a growing network of Oxfam shops, establishment of Oxfam Trading, encouragement of independent Oxfams overseas, provision of development education for schools, and establishment of the World Development Movement to campaign on issues which charity law prevented Oxfam from pursuing. Kirkley had succeeded handsomely in his aim &#145;to professionalize the whole business of charity without losing its soul in the process&#146;. When he left Oxfam in 1974 it was a high-profile and flourishing organization of international renown and in the United Kingdom the antiquated concept of charity had been challenged.<br>
<br>Departure from Oxfam did not mean retirement. A further decade of involvement with voluntary and public organizations was to follow: as a member of the Board of Crown Agents (1974&#150;80), chairman of the standing conference on refugees and the British Refugee Council (1974&#150;81), chairman of the disasters' emergency committee (1977&#150;81), and chief executive of the Voluntary and Christian Service Trust, the parent body of Help the Aged and Action Aid (1979&#150;84). Here Kirkley's organizational talents provided a cost-effective management structure which enabled Help the Aged to become a mainstream charity and to encourage an international network of similar indigenous organizations: Help the Aged International.<br>
<br>Colleagues from all stages of his working life remembered Kirkley for his particular blend of warmth, optimism, energy, obstinacy, grit, and practical business sense. His efficient administrative skills were self-evident, but he was never a bureaucrat, disliking committees and preferring to work through personal contact. His were political skills. His management strengths lay in his ability to pick people of talent and commitment and motivate them to give of their best, allowing them freedom to operate creatively while, with his quiet style of leadership, he retained ultimate control.<br>
<br>Kirkley became a knight commander of the order of St Sylvester in 1963, and in 1974 was given the Victor Gollancz humanity award. He was appointed CBE in 1966 and knighted in 1977. Honorary MAs came from the universities of Oxford (1969), Leeds (1970), and Bradford (1974), and an honorary fellowship from Manchester Polytechnic (1971). He was also head shepherd of the Greek village of Livaderon.<br>
<br>Stocky in build, informal in dress and manner, with straightforward northern bluntness and a quizzical smile, Kirkley was outwardly easy-going, with a Quaker preference for compromise over confrontation. But the relaxed manner masked a steely determination, and his courage and tenacity could appear as obstinacy to frustrated colleagues. He had been raised an Anglican but his pacifism during the war led him to join the Quakers, and the deep sense of service which motivated him sprang from his Christian socialist commitment.<br>
<br>A lover of music, theatre, and country walks, Kirkley drew rich pleasure from life. Devoted to his dogs and to his family&#151;who had none the less to take their place&#151;he was twice married, first in 1936 to Elsie May (<i>d</i>. 1956), daughter of John Rothwell, accountant, and second to (Constance Nina) Mary, daughter of Thomas Bannister-Jones, clergyman. His family comprised three sons and two daughters, one daughter and one son being from the first marriage. Despite a serious heart attack in 1986 he continued to work for the things in which he believed. He died in the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, on 9 January 1989.<br>
