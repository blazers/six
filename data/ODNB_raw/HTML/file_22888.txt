<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pulteney,  Richard</span>  (1730&#150;1801), <span class="occ">botanist and physician</span>, was born on 17 February 1730 at Loughborough, Leicestershire, the sole survivor of the eleven children of Samuel Pulteney (1674&#150;1754), a prosperous tailor, and Mary Tomlinson (1692&#150;1759), a native of the nearby village of Hathern. The family belonged to a sect known as Old Anabaptists. As a pupil at the Old Free School, Loughborough, he already displayed an enthusiasm for botany and natural history, encouraged by the example of his uncle George Tomlinson. At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed for seven years to an apothecary of Loughborough. In 1752 he settled as a surgeon and apothecary in Leicester, but as a dissenter he met with a degree of hostility and prejudice which compromised the success of his practice.<br>
<br>More encouraging was Pulteney's increasing acceptance as a respected botanist by a widening circle of friends and correspondents. Prominent among these was William Watson, who became an influential friend and mentor, and by the loan of books such as the <span class="italic">Flora Anglica</span> of Linnaeus enabled the young apothecary to further his study of botany. In 1750 Pulteney began to publish articles in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, mainly on botanical topics such as the new Linnaean system of botanical classification. With typical modesty he left these early writings unsigned or merely initialled. These papers were sent for correction and comment to Watson who then passed them on to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> or to the Royal Society for publication in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. In 1756 Pulteney was thanked by Lord Macclesfield, president of the Royal Society, for his <span class="italic">Account of the More Rare Plants Observed in Leicestershire</span>.<br>
<br>A turning point in Pulteney's career came in 1764, when, in spite of his natural diffidence, he was persuaded to take a medical degree at Edinburgh University. Although he had already been elected FRS in 1762, he realized that a medical qualification was vital to his advancement. Accompanied by his friend Maxwell Garthshore he took the necessary examinations and graduated in May 1764. His inaugural dissertation, on the medicinal properties of Peruvian bark (<i>Cinchona officinalis</i>) enabled him to display both his medical and botanical knowledge. The graduation of Pulteney and Garthshore after barely three months' residence aroused deep resentment among less favoured students, particularly Americans and fellow botanists. Their protest caused Pulteney much anguish, but friends rallied round, notably John Hope, professor of medicine and botany at Edinburgh University. That same year also brought disappointment to hopes of aristocratic patronage with the death of Lord Macclesfield, to whom Pulteney had intended to dedicate his thesis. A further setback came with the death in July of William Pulteney, earl of Bath, who had acknowledged Pulteney as a relative and appointed him as his domestic physician; Pulteney then had the task of finding a new situation, for absence had destroyed his prospects in Leicester. Financial considerations made his ambition to live in London and travel to Leiden or Paris impossible, but in 1765, assisted by letters of recommendation from Watson and George Baker, he secured the practice of physician in Blandford, Dorset, a position he vainly hoped would be temporary.<br>
<br>After initial difficulties, Pulteney established himself as a successful and popular physician but he regretted that he could not devote himself wholly to the study of botany. In an undated letter to John Hope written shortly after the move he commented bitterly on the low esteem in which botany was held; display of any knowledge of it, he claimed, would harm his reputation as a medical man. In spite of this intellectual exile, however, he found it possible, through an expanding network of correspondents such as Thomas Martyn and William Withering, to keep up with developments in medicine and natural science. In 1767 he became acquainted with Margaret Cavendish Bentinck, dowager duchess of Portland, an enthusiastic conchologist, who would visit him on her way to collect shells at Weymouth. He sent the duchess plants and she provided him with shells for his own collection, some brought over in 1771 from New Zealand on Captain James Cook's ship <i>Endeavour</i>.<br>
<br>In 1779 Pulteney married Elizabeth Galton of Blandford (1739&#150;1820); they had no children. Three years later he published his most significant work, <span class="italic">A General View of the Writings of Linnaeus</span>, which contained the first biography of Linnaeus in English. In his memoir of Pulteney in Rees's <span class="italic">Cyclopaedia</span> (vol. 23, 1813) Sir James Edward Smith stated that this book &#145;has contributed more than any work, except perhaps the <span class="italic">Tracts of Stillingfleet</span>, to diffuse a taste for Linnaean knowledge in this country&#146;. The Royal Academy of Sciences of Stockholm presented Pulteney with two medals struck in honour of Linnaeus as a mark of appreciation and a French translation of the book by L. A. Millin de Grandmaison (1789) drew favourable comments on the continent. His second book, <span class="italic">Historical and Biographical Sketches of the Progress of Botany in England</span> (1790), was less popular, but it was still valued by historians two centuries later.<br>
<br>In 1790 Pulteney was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society which had been instituted by Smith, its first president, in 1788. He published several papers in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> and bequeathed his herbarium and collections of shells and minerals to the society.<br>
<br>Pulteney is remembered as a zealous promoter of the methods and nomenclature of Linnaeus and as a historian of botany in Britain. His benevolence, integrity, and tolerance endeared him to his contemporaries. His papers, preserved in the archives of the Linnean Society library, incorporate a lifetime's correspondence with most of the eminent botanists and physicians of his day and provide an important and fascinating commentary on the history of natural science in the latter half of the eighteenth century. He died of pneumonia at Langton near Blandford on 13 October 1801 and was buried in Langton churchyard. His wife placed a memorial tablet to him in Blandford church engraved with a sprig of <i>Pultenaea stipularis</i>, an Australian shrub named by J. E. Smith in his honour.<br>
