</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pugin,  Auguste Charles</span>  (1768/9&#150;1832), <span class="occ">artist and architectural draughtsman</span>, was born in the parish of St Sulpice, Paris, one of the seven children of Fran&ccedil;ois Joseph Pugin (<i>fl</i>. 1765&#150;1794), who was probably in the service of a German aristocrat resident in Paris, and of Margu&eacute;rite Duch&ecirc;ne (<i>fl</i>. 1768&#150;<i>c</i>.1800). Most of what is known of Pugin's French origins is in the form of uncorroborated notes collected from Madame Antonia Molineux, Pugin's only niece, by Benjamin Ferrey, in preparation for his biography of Pugin and his son, A. W. N. Pugin.<h2>
<a name="Familybackgroundandeducation"></a>Family background and education</h2>Pugin's father was apparently the youngest of a large family in Switzerland, probably Fribourg. He came to France <i>c</i>.1765 and was, according to Madame Molineux, &#145;first gentleman to the Prince de Selm&#146;, who was probably Frederick John Otto, prince de Salm-Kyrbourg (1745&#150;1794), who served in the French army. Pugin is described as &#145;fils de laboureur&#146; on the certificate of his first marriage, but the family's claim to nobility relates to their presumed descent from a noble medieval Fribourg family, one of whom, Louis De Corbi&egrave;res, fought at the battle of Morat in 1477, an incident recounted by Ferrey and corroborated in the <span class="italic">Dictionnaire historique et biographique de la Suisse</span> (2, 1924, 579). His father's second marriage, to Pugin's mother, seems to have brought some prosperity, which was lost under the French Revolution, during which period he appears to have died and the prince de Salm-Kyrbourg was guillotined. How many of Pugin's six brothers and sisters survived is unknown, but only two sisters, Jeanne Ad&eacute;la&iuml;de Lafitte and Sophie Bernard, are mentioned in family papers. The family clearly prospered in France under the restoration and by 1827 was reusing the family coat of arms, which had been taken from that of the De Corbi&egrave;res family. The arms also appear as Pugin in the early nineteenth-century <span class="italic">Armorial combaz</span>  (Biblioth&egrave;que cantonale et universitaire de Fribourg, fol. 43). Pugin does not appear to have used the arms but his son, A. W. N. Pugin, made them widely known in his publications, with slight changes and the addition of the motto &#145;en avant&#146;, which he no doubt intended to be provocative. It seems clear that Pugin believed himself to be a gentleman, though always an impecunious one.<br>
<br>Also nothing is known of Pugin's education, but among his lifelong friends were Louis Lafitte (1770&#150;1828), a neo-classical painter who became his brother-in-law, and C. P. J. Normand (1765&#150;1840), a neo-classical architect, both of whom studied at the Acad&eacute;mie Royale. It has been suggested that he may have been the artist of illustrations signed &#145;Pugin&#146; which appeared in the magazine <span class="italic">Le Cabinet des Modes</span> between April 1776 and November 1789  (Hill, 12&#150;13). This seems a reasonable conjecture, suggesting a struggling young artist seeking to make a little money in such a way.<br>
<br>On 27 March 1792 Pugin entered the Royal Academy Schools in London, when his age was given in the register as twenty-four. His reasons for leaving France have not been established although various glamorous stories circulated among his pupils. He did not remain in London long, however, but soon had a position as a draughtsman to the architect John Nash. Nash was then working in Wales, where he developed his picturesque style. Pugin acknowledged his debt to Nash in the dedication of his first volume of <span class="italic">Specimens of Gothic Architecture</span> (1821), where he wrote: &#145;Soon after my arrival in this country, I was fortunately introduced to you, and prosecuted my architectural studies in your office with much gratification and advantage to myself&#146;. Signed drawings of this period show Pugin's style to be typical of late eighteenth-century topography, with a heavy outline and a somewhat na&iuml;ve approach.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Nash returned to London <i>c</i>.1796 and it must be presumed that Pugin came with him and continued to work for him. By this time Pugin felt himself to be a qualified architect and in 1799 he exhibited at the Royal Academy an <span class="italic">Intended Villa in the North of England</span>, but in the same year he was also listed as a member of the Royal Academy life class. It seems that he quickly gave up the attempt to establish himself as an architect, unlike the eldest son of Humphry Repton, J. A. Repton (1775&#150;1860), who had also been with Nash in Wales, and concentrated on improving his artistic skills. In London Pugin found companions among the artistic &eacute;migr&eacute; community, such as J. Merigot, Pierre Cond&eacute;, and J. C. Nattes. During this period his style and technique, in particular his handling of watercolour, developed a long way from its previous stiffness. As importantly, on 2 February 1802 he married Catherine Welby (<i>c</i>.1772&#150;1833), an interesting and intelligent lady who was related to a prominent landowning family in Lincolnshire. She set about the organization and promotion of her easy-going husband, which proved to be a slow process at first. They began their married life in her father's house, 3 Pullens Row, Islington.<br>
<br>The turning point in Pugin's career was the forming of a connection with Rudolph Ackermann, the German publisher who played such an important role in the formation of the taste of the Regency period, particularly with his shop on the Strand and his magazine, both called the <span class="italic">Repository of the Arts</span>. The most famous joint production of Pugin and Ackermann, <span class="italic">The Microcosm of London</span>, appeared between 1808 and 1810. The project seems to have originated in an idea of the Pugins  (Hill, 16): a draft prospectus survives for a publication entitled &#145;Views of London and Westminster&#146;, which was to contain plates combining &#145;the most interesting public edifices &hellip; with the characteristics peculiar to each part of the town&#146;  (Yale Center for British Art, Pugin 176). Perhaps they intended the text to be by Catherine Pugin, but the work was realized in all its editorial and technical complexity by Ackermann, who used professional writers for the text and for the coloured aquatints crucially brought in the artist Thomas Rowlandson, whose rumbustious figures were the perfect foil to Pugin's clear and accurate architectural settings. The result was an acknowledged masterpiece and was followed by Ackermann's <span class="italic">History of Westminster Abbey</span> (1812), to which Pugin contributed eighteen plates, the <span class="italic">History of the University of Oxford</span> (1814), with thirty plates by Pugin, the <span class="italic">History of the University of Cambridge</span> (1815), with twenty-two plates by Pugin, and finally the <span class="italic">History of the Colleges of Winchester etc.</span> (1816), with fourteen plates by Pugin. These books, widely held to be among the most beautiful illustrated books of the first half of the nineteenth century, established Pugin's reputation and in 1809, helped by a bequest from Catherine's father, they were established at 39 Keppel Street, Bloomsbury, where, in March 1812, their only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22869/', "Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin")</script>, was born.<br>
<br>This period marks the high point of Pugin's skill as an artist. He had been elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1807 and had a great mastery of that medium, in which he liked to explore the effects of light. He became a full member in 1812 and was a regular contributor to their exhibitions. He also continued to exhibit occasionally at the Royal Academy. Among his best pictures are the <span class="italic">View of Louth</span> (<i>c</i>.1817, Louth Naturalists' Antiquarian and Literary Society, Lincolnshire) and <span class="italic">View from the Excavated Ground of the Highgate Archway</span> (1812, Highgate Literary and Scientific Institute, London). His architectural interests at this period seem to have been concentrated on helping friends, particularly with Gothic details, in which he was by then considered an expert. An important example, which may be attributed to Pugin in 1817, was the gothicizing of a garden building at Claremont, Surrey, as a mausoleum to Princess Charlotte, a work which was executed by J. B. Papworth, the acknowledged architect.<br>
<br>As well as these two activities, Pugin carried out a number of miscellaneous commissions, no doubt to make ends meet, including in 1810 the supervising of the erection of a Coade stone statue of George III at Nocton, Lincolnshire. From 1814 his French connections were revived: immediately following the peace treaty with France, Louis Lafitte, his wife, and daughter, joined the Pugins in London. Lafitte had been a court painter to the Empress Josephine and then to Napoleon, and no doubt felt that a period of absence from France would benefit his career. Pugin was able, principally through Nash, to help Lafitte obtain commissions to provide decorations for the victory celebrations. The family stayed in England until the battle of Waterloo had clarified the political situation, and &#145;the visit established a pattern of mutual assistance and co-operation between the brothers-in-law which continued until Lafitte's death&#146;  (Hill, 18). It is not known whether Lafitte ever returned to England, but from that time onwards the Pugins made regular visits to Paris, where Lafitte soon held another court position under Louis XVIII. This connection must have helped him set up a minor cross-channel business dealing in prints, books, and probably antiques.<h2>
<a name="Majorworks"></a>Major works</h2>Pugin continued to work for Ackermann, for whom in the <span class="italic">Repository of the Arts</span> he produced a series of remarkable designs for Gothic furniture, first published between 1825 and 1827, and then gathered into a book, <span class="italic">Gothic Furniture</span>, published by Ackermann with no date but presumably 1828. Pugin's major occupation became his production of illustrated architectural books, which were overwhelmingly devoted to medieval architecture. In his obituary in <span class="italic">Arnold's Library of the Fine Arts</span> it was acknowledged that he had &#145;performed for gothic architecture services similar to those which [James] Stuart and his fellow-labourers effected for that of Greece&#146;  (<span class="italic">Arnold's Library</span>, 323).<br>
<br>It is not surprising that with all his experience Pugin soon attracted the attention of the antiquary and topographer John Britton (1771&#150;1857) in his enormous publishing enterprises, and in 1818 Pugin was in Lincoln making illustrations for Britton's fifth volume of the <span class="italic">Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain</span> (1826). Pugin went to Lincoln often, perhaps to visit Welby relations, and frequently exhibited paintings of the city and its surroundings. Here he was approached by a local Catholic architect, E. J. Willson (1787&#150;1854), with the idea of producing a book useful to builders and architects, with measured drawings of details of the different parts of Gothic architecture. The scheme was taken up swiftly and the two volumes of <span class="italic">Specimens of Gothic Architecture</span> were published in 1821 and 1823, with the text by Willson. Britton said: &#145;I declined to place my name in the title-page&#146; but &#145;I soon found that nearly the whole of the business department devolved on me&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Builder</span>, 13, 1855, 5). These volumes were successful and widely recognized as a new departure. In contrast to Britton's earlier enterprises, which were illustrated with densely hatched etchings, this one used steel-engravings. This new technique, combined with an emphasis on practical construction, by showing a large number of mouldings and other details, and with Pugin's own genius for creating an attractive plate, produced architectural drawings of unrivalled elegance, clarity, and accuracy. The absence of picturesque views and dedicated plates must have added to the impression of modernity. The publication was not a commercial success, and in order to undertake <span class="italic">Specimens</span> Pugin took on pupils and established a flourishing school of architectural drawing in his own house at 105 Great Russell Street. Among his first pupils were Charles Moore (<i>fl</i>. 1820s) and Charles James Mathews (1803&#150;1878), who left an affectionate account of his time in Pugin's office. His father, the actor Charles Mathews, who had met Pugin in Wales, is supposed to have based his character of M. Mallet on his knowledge of Pugin and his experiences as a newly arrived foreigner in England. Pugin and his pupils made extended tours in Britain, and also to Paris and in Normandy to find the material for his books. After <span class="italic">Specimens</span>, Pugin and Britton used the same formula to produce <span class="italic">Specimens of the Architectural Antiquities of Normandy</span> (1827), with text by Britton. At the same time they were working on <span class="italic">Illustrations of the Public Buildings of London</span>, which appeared in two volumes in 1825 and 1828. The books were modelled on a French prototype, <span class="italic">Description de Paris et de ses &eacute;difices</span> (1806&#150;9), by J. G. Legrand and C. P. Landon. They are not pretty books in the sense that the <span class="italic">Microcosm</span> volumes were, but they are invaluable to architectural historians and &#145;nearly one and a half centuries later, Britton and Pugin are still our most reliable guides to Regency London&#146;  (Crook, 117). Sadly, the collaboration came to an unhappy conclusion and Pugin and Taylor (the printer) involved Britton in a lawsuit. Britton wrote to Soane:<blockquote>I am now endeavouring to seperate [<i>sic</i>] all accounts and connection with Pugin and Taylor, both of whom have acted meanly and dishonourably towards me. The Normandy and London Buildings being finished, I shall never again have connection with either. (John Britton to John Soane, 22 Nov 1828, London, Soane Museum, III B.1.68)</blockquote>An alternative point of view is hinted at in Pugin's obituary  (<span class="italic">Arnold's Library</span>, 324).<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">London</span> volumes actually recorded a loss of &pound;460, but Pugin and his pupils continued with his schemes undaunted. The next books to appear were <span class="italic">Paris and its Environs</span>, in two volumes (1829 and 1831), with the text by L. T. Ventouillac, and a series of attractive books, aimed for a different market, which imaginatively explored the new medium of lithography. These were: <span class="italic">A Series of Views Illustrative of Pugin's Examples of Gothic Architecture</span> (1830), with the text by W. H. Leeds and lithography by Joseph Nash; <span class="italic">Gothic Ornaments from Ancient Buildings in England and France</span> (1828&#150;31), with lithographs by J. D. Harding; and <span class="italic">A series of ornamental timber gables from existing examples in England and France of the sixteenth century</span> (1831), with text by E. J. Willson and lithographs by B. Ferrey. These works were brought out with the second wave of Pugin's pupils, who were approximately the same age as Pugin's son. Among the best-known are T. T. Bury, Benjamin Ferrey, Joseph Nash, and James Pennethorne. In his account of Pugin's drawing school, Ferrey gave a particularly unfair description of Mrs Pugin's management of the household.<h2>
<a name="Laterworks"></a>Later works</h2>Of other important commissions that came Pugin's way during this period, one was from John Nash for the splendid plates for his book, <span class="italic">The Royal Pavilion at Brighton</span> (1826), on which Pugin worked between 1819 and 1824. He also continued to practise occasionally as an architect: in 1823 he designed the interior of the Diorama in Regent's Park, together with James Morgan (<i>fl</i>. 1806&#150;1834). Between 1826 and 1827 he exhibited three designs for cemeteries, and early in 1830 he was associated with Sir Marc Isambard Brunel in the layout of the cemetery at Kensal Green. Pugin's knowledge and advocacy of the Gothic styles were continued in his final publication, the first volume of <span class="italic">Examples of Gothic Architecture</span> (1831), in which the examples were taken from &#145;habitable&#146; buildings, &#145;civil architecture being much less understood than ecclesiastical&#146;. The text was once more by E. J. Willson, whose late delivery delayed the publication. Pugin was working on the second volume at the time of his death in his home at 105 Great Russell Street on 19 December 1832. He was buried on 27 December in St Mary's Church, Islington.<br>
<br>Pugin's character was clearly delightful, charming, and relaxed, appealing to all kinds of people, from his pupils to his aristocratic patrons. He also seems to have enjoyed a happy family life with his clever wife and precocious son, whose spectacular early successes and failures must have caused him considerable uneasiness from time to time. A. W. N. Pugin paid an affectionate tribute to his father in the frontispiece to the second volume of <span class="italic">Examples</span> which, again greatly delayed by Willson, eventually appeared in 1836, although it was one of his pupils, Thomas Larkins Walker, that Pugin made his literary executor, and it was he who wrote the text and supervised the third volume of <span class="italic">Examples</span>. Pugin was never affluent at any period of his life and always had to husband his income. After his death his extensive library of architectural books was sold at Wheatleys on 4 June 1833.<br>
