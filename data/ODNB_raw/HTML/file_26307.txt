</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stapleton,  Thomas</span>  (1535&#150;1598), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic theologian</span>, was born at Henfield, Sussex, in July 1535. His father, William, a man of some substance and prominence in the county as steward to the bishop of Winchester, did not sympathize with the religious changes then being introduced into the realm. Although he kept his misgivings to himself, the forename he chose for his son may have had some significance: Thomas More had been executed only days before. The younger Stapleton in any case considered the name he shared with More &#145;a good omen&#146;, and when, toward the end of his life, he composed his <span class="italic">Tres Thomae</span>, which included a brief biography of the great chancellor, he observed: &#145;I remember well, and numberless people can testify with me, that the fame of this man and the memory of his martyrdom acted as a stimulus to us young people who wanted to hold fast to the Catholic faith&#146;  (<span class="italic">Opera</span>, 4.935).<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearsandeducation15531563"></a>Early years and education, 1553&#150;1563</h2>Stapleton the boy learned his grammar at Canterbury School and passed from there to Winchester College where, he said, he found the regimen &#145;more rewarding&#146;. At the age of fifteen he went up to Oxford, and on 18 January 1553 he was elected fellow of New College. At the end of 1556 he was awarded his bachelor's degree. Because of his association with the latter two institutions (&#145;splendid colleges&#146;, he called them many years later), Stapleton could assume the proud title &#145;Wiccamite&#146; (Wykehamist), and he liked to boast that the alumni of William of Wykeham's schools had played a lively role in resisting the Elizabethan religious settlement.<br>
<br>The need for such resistance, however, was not yet apparent to the young scholar when, early in 1558, he was ordained priest and collated to a prebend in Chichester Cathedral. The change, swift and dramatic, was not long in coming. The unhappy Queen Mary died on 17 November 1558, and by the end of the year it was clear that the new monarch, Elizabeth, had no intention of maintaining the connection with Rome that her sister had re-established. The parliament that assembled in January 1559 passed in due course the <span class="roman">Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity</span>, which revived the state church and the protestant worship as they had developed in the days of the queen's father and brother. But in contrast to the similar situation created by Henry VIII twenty-five years before, this time more than a few prominent Catholics declined to conform. Some of them, in imitation of the protestants at the beginning of Mary's reign, decided to retire abroad and wait for better times.<h2>
<a name="Deprivationandexile15631571"></a>Deprivation and exile, 1563&#150;1571</h2>Among these latter was Thomas Stapleton who, late in 1559, departed England for the Low Countries, then under the dynastic sway of the king of Spain. The details of his going are obscure. &#145;Fearing the contagion of schism in my tender years&#146;, he explained vaguely in his <span class="italic">Compendium</span>, &#145;I came a fugitive to the learned benches of Louvain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Compendium</span>). Clearly the new protestant bishop of Chichester, William Barlow, considered the flight illegal: &#145;Misliking the proceedings of the realm, [Stapleton] conveyed himself over the seas without license under the wings of Count Feria&#146;  (Birt, 424&#150;5). It is indeed possible that Stapleton left England in the company of the Spanish ambassador, who had married an English wife, Jane Dormer, and included several English clerics in his retinue. Once in Belgium, at any rate, Stapleton obtained the necessary royal warrant which permitted him to reside outside the kingdom for three years. The time was spent, characteristically, in study&#151;theology at Louvain and linguistics at the University of Paris. Toward the end of this sojourn, he made a pilgrimage to Rome, after which, once back in Belgium, he found letters from his father urgently requesting him to return to England. Whether domestic crisis, government pressure, or some other reason prompted William Stapleton's summons remains uncertain. &#145;I was scarcely home&#146;, his son wrote in his <span class="italic">Counterblast</span>, &#145;when I was called before the mock tribunal of the heretic jester to whom fair Chichester had become subject&#146;. He told Bishop Barlow that he would swear that part of the oath of supremacy which acknowledged the queen as &#145;supreme governor&#146; in temporal affairs, but &#145;upon refusal of the other [religious] part, he deprived me (as much as lay in him) of my prebend in Chichester Church&#146;. If Stapleton had hoped that during his absence on the continent the clouds of heresy would pass away, and with them the threat to his own career, by early 1563 he knew better. Accompanied by his father and the rest of his family (&#145;all of them very good Catholics, pious and devout&#146;), he emigrated to Louvain. He never saw England again.<br>
<br>Stapleton spent the rest of his life in the Low Countries. Except for an occasional trip to France and one to Italy, he never left them. He kept in close contact therefore with his fellow English refugees, the bulk of whom had settled in one Belgian town or another and waited, in the pathetic tradition of political exiles, for the day when their enemies at home would be turned out. At first they were sanguine that that day might come soon. After all, the faith that the Tudor family had originally disavowed it had later restored, and perhaps it could be persuaded to restore it again. This optimism, so completely out of tune with reality, inspired an avalanche of polemical writing in English, most of it emanating from presses located in the Netherlands. In this endeavour Stapleton made his controversial d&eacute;but, or, as he expressed it, &#145;At this time I began to write my first books against the heretics, but in the vernacular tongue only&#146;  (<span class="italic">Compendium</span>). Indeed, his <span class="italic">The Fortresse of the Faith</span> (1565), <span class="italic">A Returne of Untruthes upon M. Jewelles Replie</span> (1566), and <span class="italic">A Counterblast to M. Hornes Vayne Blaste</span> (1567) earned an honourable place within that recusant literature of the 1560s, which, taken as a whole, was so astonishingly erudite and stylish. Perhaps Stapleton's most enduring contribution to this sparkling collection of prose was his least controversial, a translation (1565) of Bede's <span class="italic">Historia ecclesiastica</span>.<br>
<br>But this literary offensive did not last; warriors, even verbal warriors, need more solid nourishment than dreams. As the first decade of their exile neared its end, the recusants had ruefully to admit that the Elizabethan regime gave no signs of collapse or amendment. Quite to the contrary, the failure of the rising launched by the northern earls (1569) and Pope Pius V's ill-advised excommunication of the queen (1570) appeared to have left her government stronger than ever. Moreover, the very land where the exiles had taken refuge became, after 1566, itself a pivotal battleground in the unhappy wars of religion. Stapleton was an eyewitness of one of the incidents that ignited this deadly contest. &#145;Coming by chance to town that afternoon&#146;, he left a vivid account of the sacking of the Catholic churches in Antwerp on the night of 19&#150;20 August 1566: &#145;To describe particularly the horrible and outrageous sacrileges of that night, an eternal document of the gospellike zeal of this sacred brotherhood, would require a full treatise of itself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Counterblast</span>, fols. 18&#150;21). A result of these hostilities, crucial to the English intellectuals in exile, was the upheaval worked upon the Belgian printing industry. The recusant propaganda effort was thus stifled at its mechanical source, and after 1567 Stapleton never again published a work written in his native language. Given his remarkable literary skills, his decision to compose thereafter only in a rather ornate Renaissance Latin was a loss to English letters at a moment when the language had begun to approach the apogee it would reach in the next generation, with Shakespeare, Spenser, and the King James <span class="roman">Bible</span>. But Stapleton knew and cared nothing about such matters; he was absorbed in the great ideological struggle of his time, and, like any author, he needed a public if he were to enjoy any satisfaction from his art. His readers would be thereafter the theological literati of Europe.<br>
<br>In 1569 Stapleton took up residence in Douai. There, the year before, William Allen had opened the Coll&egrave;ge des Pr&ecirc;tres Anglais, an institution intended to prepare missionaries to serve in England the moment the old faith had been restored there. The four original students took their courses in the local university and received their spiritual formation in the two houses provided for them nearby. Ultimately the college became the nursery of heroes: once Allen was convinced that Catholicism at home could not long survive without priestly ministrations, he began to send the young men, variously disguised, into England, even though, if anything, the government's hostility had intensified. By the time Queen Elizabeth died, 450 Douai priests had served on the English mission, and 110 of them had been executed.<h2>
<a name="Publicprofessorofdivinity15711590"></a>Public professor of divinity, 1571&#150;1590</h2>Stapleton's retiring nature and bookish habits inclined him to work within the larger sphere of Douai University rather than in the single-minded ambience of the college. He was an admirer of Allen, but never an intimate or a prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Both of them received doctorates from the university (10 July 1571), and both of them, once elevated to the faculty, were considered by academic colleagues <i>professeurs distingu&eacute;s</i>. In 1580, however, when the wars in the Low Countries prompted Allen to move the college to Rheims, Stapleton remained behind. &#145;I am convinced&#146;, he wrote in the <span class="italic">Compendium</span>, &#145;that I must devote myself to study and literary labour in which alone I can be of service to the Church of God&#146;  (<span class="italic">Compendium</span>). Allen appreciated this attitude and never attempted to draw Stapleton either into the routine work of formation of the college or into the web of political intrigue, that, as the frustrating years passed, came gradually to preoccupy him. Already by 1576 plots were afoot to mount an &#145;enterprise of England&#146;, to enlist foreign intervention, that is, to topple the Elizabethan regime by force. When Stapleton that year departed for Rome, he carried with him a letter from Allen to a fellow conspirator. &#145;Our master, Dr. Stapleton&#146;, Allen wrote, &#145;is of himself quite eager to undertake the pilgrimage to Rome for the sake of devotion, but he knows nothing at all about the enterprise&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries of the English College</span>, 307).<br>
<br>From the time of his arrival in Douai&#151;during an era in which the European mind was obsessed with religious controversy&#151;Stapleton established a reputation as a foremost practitioner of the craft. In tract after enormous Latin tract&#151;his <span class="italic">De universa justificationis doctrina, hodie controversa</span> (1581) ran to 350,000 words&#151;he addressed virtually all the theological issues that so bleakly divided Catholics and protestants. (These works are contained in four large folio volumes, published at Paris in 1620.) His books were verbose, repetitive, and unrelievedly harsh in the language directed against his opponents&#151;he titled one of them <span class="italic">Speculum pravitatis haereticae</span> (1580) and to this &#145;mirror of heretical depravity&#146; he added later a series of <span class="italic">Antidota</span> to &#145;the poison of Calvin and [Theodore] Beza&#146; (1595, 1598). But they manifested also enormous erudition; Stapleton knew the requisite classical languages, which opened to him the lore of the ecclesiastical past and present. Scripture, the fathers of the early church, the decrees of popes and councils, medieval divines as well as contemporary Catholic thinkers were all mobilized for the struggle. And, despite the verbal abuse he routinely heaped upon them, he paid his Lutheran, Calvinist, and Church of England adversaries the compliment of taking their arguments seriously. What he practised was the new style &#145;positive&#146; theology; not the deductive, Aristotelian-inspired reasoning favoured by the scholastics but the inductive method of accumulation of evidence, made possible by the rediscovery of long-lost or neglected texts and precedents. The Oxford antiquary Anthony Wood may have reflected local bias when he called Stapleton &#145;the most learned Roman Catholic of all his time&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 1.669), but the claim was by no means indefensible.<br>
<br>The relentless intellectual campaign, however, left psychological wounds. &#145;Year followed year&#146;, Stapleton recalled in the <span class="italic">Compendium</span>, &#145;and I grew weary of studies spoiled by contention&#146;. Not that he failed to find an occasional literary diversion, most notably his charming <span class="italic">Tres Thomae</span> (1588), biographical sketches of the trio of saintly patrons who bore his own name: Thomas the Apostle, Thomas Becket, and Thomas More. Even so, in 1585, at the age of fifty, he resigned his professorship and:<blockquote>longing for a kind of life in which the things of this world count for nothing, I fled to the cool shadows and hid myself in the cloisters of those fathers whom we call by the blessed name of Jesus.</blockquote>The Jesuits at Douai received the famous theologian kindly though, considering his age, with reservations, which proved justified. &#145;For almost two years I put my powers to the test&#146;, Stapleton declared, but in the end he had to admit an inability to adjust to an entirely different mode of life. His departure caused no bitterness, and Stapleton remained, as he had always been, a stalwart supporter of the Society of Jesus.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears15901598"></a>Final years, 1590&#150;1598</h2>In 1590 Thomas Stapleton resumed his formal academic career by way of appointment to the chair of sacred scripture in the University of Louvain. This prestigious professorship he owed to King Philip of Spain, in whose defence the grateful theologian wrote a stirring pamphlet &#145;against the calumnies of Elizabeth, Queen of England&#146; (1592). During his tenure in this his last office he published many controversial treatises as before, including the celebrated anti-Calvinist <span class="italic">Antidota</span>, and most of his equally pugnacious lectures. Yet he also turned his attention to more devotional and liturgical works, such as commentaries on the gospel passages designated to be read at mass on Sundays and feast days. Pope Clement VIII, elected in 1592, was a particular admirer of Stapleton's works and regularly had portions of them read to him. Meanwhile Cardinal Allen's long-delayed &#145;enterprise of England&#146; had failed with the defeat of the Spanish Armada, and Allen himself died in 1594. From that date rumours began to circulate that Stapleton might be elevated to the Sacred College, now without an English incumbent. Stapleton put little stock in the gossip: &#145;The favour of his Holiness toward me now seemeth great, but what it may be hereafter is very uncertain, and I build not a jot thereupon&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diaries of the English College</span>, 390). The pontiff did indeed promote him to a minor prelacy, but before a final decision could be made about a cardinal's hat, Stapleton died at Louvain on 12 October 1598. He was buried in St Peter's Church there beneath an appropriately fulsome Latin epitaph. Perhaps a better testament he wrote himself in his native tongue when a young man:<blockquote>I trust the queen's majesty, once well considering, will graciously bear with the Catholics that do not envy [her titles], but only desire that their consciences may not be straitened for one of them. Which they upon great grounds and they verily think without impairing of her worldly estate, cannot by oath assuredly avouch; which thing they trust they may do without any just suspicion of sedition or rebellion. (<span class="italic">Counterblast</span>, fols. 26&#150;7)</blockquote>
