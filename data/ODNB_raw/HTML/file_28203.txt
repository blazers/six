<span class="headword">Vere,  Aubrey (II)  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1141), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the son and successor of Aubrey (I) de Vere and Beatrice, his wife. While the family was from Ver, south of Coutances in Normandy, there is no evidence that Aubrey senior or his descendants held lands either there or in Brittany, with which they retained ties. The elder Aubrey was most probably the younger son of a Norman lord who prospered in England after the conquest, becoming a royal chamberlain. Probably born in the early 1080s, Aubrey junior married Alice (<i>d</i>. 1163?), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5436/', "Gilbert de Clare")</script>, before 1107. He was to become one of the most prominent royal administrators of the later years of the reign of Henry I and the early years of Stephen. It is likely that Aubrey (II) began his administrative career as royal chamberlain, possibly inheriting that office from his father when the latter died <i>c</i>.1112. By 1121 he was sheriff of Essex, and, later in that decade, of London and Middlesex. The extent of the king's confidence in de Vere is evident in his appointment as joint sheriff, with Richard Basset, to the custody of eleven counties in 1129&#150;30. This unprecedented situation was probably part of an effort to collect arrears and to adjust the shrieval farms. While the king had levied one fine of 550 marks and four war-horses against him for having allowed a prisoner to escape, and another of at least 100 marks for permission to resign the shrievalty of Essex and Hertfordshire, these fines had gone largely uncollected&#151;another sign of royal favour. In 1133 Henry I bestowed the hereditary office of master chamberlain of England on de Vere; the office was to remain in the de Vere family until 1703. Although his royal service was primarily confined to England, he was at least twice with Henry I in Normandy.<br>
<br>When Aubrey de Vere's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/95042/', "William de Vere")</script> asserted that his father was &#145;justiciar of all England&#146;, and privy to important royal secrets, he seems to have meant that his father had travelled extensively as a justice, rather than that he had been chief justiciar of the realm. William of Malmesbury describes him as <i>causidicus</i>&#151;a pleader or advocate&#151;and skilled in the law. De Vere may have served as an itinerant justice under Henry I; he certainly did so in Stephen's reign. He had accepted Stephen's rule by Easter 1136, and when the king was summoned before an ecclesiastical council after his arrest of Roger of Salisbury and other bishops in 1139, he sent de Vere as his advocate. Aubrey de Vere was killed in a London riot on 15 May 1141, perhaps while supporting his son-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17927/', "Geoffrey de Mandeville, first earl of Essex (d. 1144)")</script>.<br>
<br>Aubrey de Vere had at least nine children with Alice, who survived him for twenty-two years; as a widow she retired to St Osyth's Priory. They had five sons: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28204/', "Aubrey (III) de Vere")</script>, his successor; Robert, who held a small Northamptonshire fief in 1166; Geoffrey, who served as sheriff of Shropshire from 1165 to 1170; William, who held the prebend of Nesden in St Paul's, London, before becoming a canon of St Osyth's Priory, Essex, and then bishop of Hereford (1186&#150;98), and who wrote a life of St Osgyth; and Gilbert, prior of the order of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England (1195&#150;7). Two of their four daughters became countesses: Rohese (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61195/', "Rohese de Beauchamp")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54497/', "Beauchamp, de, family")</script>]) married successively Geoffrey de Mandeville, first earl of Essex, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61194/', "Payn de Beauchamp of Bedford")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54497/', "Beauchamp, de, family")</script>]; and Juliana, divorced by Hugh (I) Bigod, earl of Norfolk, married Walchelin Maminot of West Greenwich. Alice married Robert of Essex, then Roger fitz Richard of Warkworth; their fourth daughter was wife to Roger of Raimes.<br>
<br>De Vere inherited the barony of Castle Hedingham, with twenty-nine manors located mostly in the eastern counties. Like many Normans of the second generation in England, he expanded his patrimony, but did so primarily by acquiring mesne tenancies. He founded a Benedictine cell of St Melaine, Rennes, at Hatfield Broadoak, Essex, <i>c</i>.1135, and patronized his father's foundation, also Benedictine, of Earls Colne Priory, Essex. He also began construction of a stone keep at Hedingham, Essex, modelled upon the royal keep at Rochester. It survives relatively intact. His family was to prove one of the longest lasting in the history of the English aristocracy. His eldest son was made earl of Oxford in the year of Aubrey (II)'s death, and although its descent was several times transmitted through collaterals, and twice interrupted by forfeitures, the title nevertheless passed to no fewer than nineteen successive descendants, until the twentieth earl, also Aubrey de Vere, died without a male heir in 1703.<br>
