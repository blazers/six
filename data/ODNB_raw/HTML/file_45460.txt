<span class="headword">Martin <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bullock]</span>,  Emma</span>  (1811/12&#150;1851), <span class="occ">socialist and freethinker</span>, was born in Bristol, the fourth child of William Bullock, a cooper, and his wife, Hannah Jones, whose family owned a tea-dealing business in the city. Emma's father died in her infancy, and a year later her mother married her second husband, John Gwyn, and the family moved into the middle-class area of Clifton.<br>
<br>In later years Emma wrote of the strong Christian faith of her youth &#145;to which a naturally sedate &hellip; and a melancholy turn of mind greatly inclined me&#146;  (Martin, <span class="italic">A Few Reasons</span>, 4). This resulted in her decision, at the age of seventeen, to join the Particular Baptists&#151;a sternly Calvinist wing of the Baptist church then undergoing a revival. She remained in the church as a &#145;<i>zealous</i> disciple of Jesus&#146;  (Martin, <span class="italic">God's Gifts</span>, 14) for twelve years, busy distributing evangelical tracts and collecting for the Bible Society. In 1830, at the age of eighteen, she also became the proprietor of a short-lived ladies' seminary and later a ladies' boarding-school which survived for several years; in 1835 she became the editor of the unsuccessful <span class="italic">Bristol Literary Magazine</span>. She married Isaac Luther Martin, also a Baptist, in 1831; they had three daughters. He was, however, &#145;a husband &hellip; whose company it was a humiliation to endure&#146;  (Holyoake, 4), and in the years after their marriage, despite all her religious and educational activities, Emma Martin became miserable and restless. She began delivering lectures on women's social status. In 1839 she attended her first Owenite socialist meeting and&#151;astounded to hear &#145;so close a transcript of many of the thoughts that had passed in my mind&#146;  (Martin, <span class="italic">A Few Reasons</span>, 7)&#151;prepared to embrace the socialist cause, only to discover that the socialists denied the divine origins of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Infuriated by this, she challenged the socialists to public debates on the validity of Christianity. Several accepted, only to find themselves in verbal combat with a very capable opponent. &#145;She is a lady of considerable talent&#146;, one such opponent wrote to the Owenite central board in May 1839, adding a plea that &#145;some able advocate of the Rational System&#146; be sent to tackle her  (<span class="italic">Proceedings of the Fourth Congress</span>, 28).<br>
<br>By this time, however, Emma Martin's religious beliefs were also beginning to crumble. Faced with the arguments of the freethinking Owenites&#151;whose ideas on women's rights so strongly echoed her own&#151;and made wretched by her personal circumstances, she felt the ground of Christian conviction begin to give way beneath her. Finally the crisis came. In the winter of 1839 Isaac Martin moved his family to London and Emma, seeing her opportunity, bolted, leaving behind not only her husband but also her church, her respectability, and the God in whom she no longer believed. She took the leap of faith and joined the socialists as a declared freethinker. Within a year she was one of the movement's best-known women adherents, lecturing, writing, and debating anti-socialists, particularly clerical ones, all over Britain. From having been a vigorous campaigner in Christ's cause, she became one of the church's most vociferous opponents, notorious for her knockabout style of free-thought polemic and for her hostility to conventional Christian views on women and marriage. It was as a patriarchal institution that the church particularly attracted her opprobrium, and it was the Owenites' commitment to non-patriarchal social institutions which won her strongest support. In 1841 the Owenite annual congress was addressed by one leading member, a man, who reminded those present that Owenism &#145;claimed for woman full, free and equal enjoyment of all those privileges which belonged to her as a human being&#146;  (<span class="italic">New Moral World</span>). He was followed in the speakers' list by Emma Martin, who rose to say that &#145;she had grown up from infancy with high thoughts and strong hopes of an improvement in the condition of her sex&#146;, but that:<blockquote>all institutions for mental improvement were confined to males, and that even the morals of the female sex were of a different stamp to those of the male. She saw no remedy for this till she saw the remedy of Socialism. When all should labour for each, and each be expected to labour for the whole, then would woman be placed in a position in which she would not sell her liberties. (ibid.)</blockquote>In the years that followed, Emma Martin's struggle to win others to this creed became inseparably bound up with her personal fight for an independent life. Any property which she would have had at the time of leaving her marriage was lost, and raising her children on the small salary paid by the Owenite central board must have been very difficult. When she went on lecture tours she usually left her daughters with friends, but this too must have had an emotional and financial cost. She did take one of her daughters with her on one occasion, but they encountered an anti-Owenite mob who began stoning them, and were forced to flee.<br>
<br>Emma Martin's years in Owenism coincided with the peak of the movement's ideological war against what they regarded as ignorance and error. Between 1839 and 1845 Owenites all over Britain confronted their opponents in person and in print, hammering out their message of utopian-communist ideals in the teeth of increasingly hysterical responses from political and religious conservatives. Newspaper reports of Emma's lectures described audiences of up to 3000, strongly divided in their views and expressing their opinions in raucous and sometimes violent forms. Emma's strident atheism was particularly provocative&#151;so much so that even some of her fellow socialists objected. In 1842, angered by this lack of support from the movement, she and her fellow atheist George Jacob Holyoake set up the Anti-Persecution Union to defend freethinkers charged with blasphemy. Emma herself ended up in court on several occasions, and was forced to hide from the police on others; but unlike many militant atheists, she avoided imprisonment.<br>
<br>During these years Emma Martin was also one of Owenism's more prolific pamphleteers, producing tracts with titles such as <span class="italic">The Bible No Revelation</span> (1845?), <span class="italic">Religion Superseded</span> (1844?), and <span class="italic">Baptism a Pagan Rite</span> (1844)&#151;all calculated to inflame clerical opinion. Unlike most other women Owenites she did not write pamphlets specifically on women's issues, but her style of feminist argument can be gauged from newspaper reports in the Owenite press and elsewhere. Like other campaigners for women's rights, Emma assigned great importance to the role of education in women's advancement, but in common with other socialists she also believed that only a propertyless, communal society would provide the conditions for genuine sexual equality. Appropriately for such a fierce freethinker, she frequently took issue with scriptural representations of women (the story of the fall was a favourite target). Her language in these lectures was usually quite measured, but under provocation could become much less so. In 1844 a particularly savage confrontation between Emma Martin and the police in Manchester was reported in the Manchester press accompanied by descriptions of her as &#145;a humiliating spectacle of human form &hellip; and of woman's character&#146;  (Martin, <span class="italic">The Missionary Jubilee Panic</span>, 16). Emma's response was explosive:<blockquote>and what is woman's most glorious character? Is it not to kiss the hand that strikes her, to honour and obey her lord and master, and be the tame servant of the priest? To have no will of her own. To be the football of society thankful for its kicking. You know it is! Is it not dreadful when one of the sex begins to think for herself? Why others will follow the horrible example! and where will it end? &hellip; Common sense will usurp the place of spiritualism, and liberty and love will replace priestcraft. I fear I shall live to see that dreadful day! (ibid., 16&#150;17)</blockquote>By the time this episode occurred, however, Emma Martin was tiring of the battle. Before leaving on a Scottish tour in 1845 she had begun living with Joshua Hopkins (<i>d</i>. 1852), an engineer. Returning from the tour, ill and exhausted, she found that the Owenite leadership&#151;itself weakened and divided by internal feuding&#151;were accusing her of alienating support through her extremism. Emma Martin had had enough. She left the movement to begin training as a midwife. In 1847, the year in which her fourth daughter was born, she graduated in midwifery and, having been refused hospital positions because of her atheism, began practising privately from her home at 100 Long Acre, Covent Garden, London, where her daughters also ran a surgical bandage shop. She lectured to women in gynaecology, gave courses in midwifery, and probably offered contraceptive advice. Life was financially hard, but quiet, and her common-law union with Hopkins (who called himself Martin) seems to have been a happy one.<br>
<br>Emma Martin died of tuberculosis at Holly Vill, Finchley Common, Whetstone, Middlesex, on 8 October 1851. &#145;We have lost the most important woman &hellip; on our side&#146;, her friend Holyoake wrote  (Holyoake, 2), and called for subscriptions for her gravestone for which hundreds gave, including many women who offered remembrance of &#145;that advocacy of women's social elevation which Mrs Martin so ably rendered&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Reasoner</span>, 12, 1852, 4). She was buried in Highgate cemetery. &#145;Ah!&#146;, Holyoake wrote after the quiet secular ceremony at the grave, &#145;what do we not owe to a woman who, like Emma Martin, takes the heroic side and teaches us &hellip; the truth of a gentler faith?&#146;  (Holyoake, 7).<br>
