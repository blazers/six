<span class="headword">Kirke,  Percy</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1691), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15662/', "George Kirke (d. 1675)")</script>, groom of the bedchamber and keeper of Whitehall Palace to Charles II, and Mary Townshend (1626&#150;1701), a daughter of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27608/', "Aurelian Townshend")</script>. While a teenager Kirke joined the Admiralty regiment as an ensign in 1666, and in 1670 the earl of Oxford, who had married one of Kirke's sisters, made him cornet of his own troop in his regiment of horse. In 1673 he took a temporary commission in the duke of Monmouth's regiment, then serving as part of the French army under Marshal Turenne in Flanders. He fought at the victory over the imperialists at Enzheim (4 October 1674), in which he was wounded in three places. After the battle Louis Duras wrote to Monmouth that Kirke &#145;is certainly one of the bravest lads in the world and is much esteemed as is also his brother&#146;  (Atkinson, 43). His younger brother Charles also fought at Enzheim, but received a fatal wound. In July the next year Kirke challenged and wounded Lord Mulgrave in a duel &#145;for having debauch'd and abus'd his sister&#146;  (Morrison, 304).<br>
<br>Kirke married Lady Mary Howard (<i>d</i>. 1707), a daughter of the fourth earl of Suffolk, with whom he had at least one son and two daughters. Lord Oxford promoted Kirke to captain-lieutenant in 1675 and Duras, impressed with him since Enzheim, promoted him to lieutenant-colonel of his regiment of dragoons in 1678. Two years later he took over the command of Lord Plymouth's regiment of foot, which was posted to Tangier in the summer of 1680. He took part in the last and most successful battle against the Moors (27 October 1680), in which he and Thomas Tollemache were praised for having &#145;behaved themselves like brave and gallant men&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Particular Relation</span>). In January 1681 he undertook a three-month mission to the court of the Moroccan sultan Mawlay Isma&#145;il at Meknes, where he was promised a four-year peace. Later that year he succeeded Edward Sackville as governor of Tangier and remained so until relieved by George Legge, Lord Dartmouth, in August 1683.<br>
<br>Samuel Pepys stayed in Tangier between August and December 1683 during the last months of the garrison. He was disgusted by Kirke's fast and violent temper, his high-handedness, his bawdy table talk, his boasts of his sexual conquests, his keeping of a mistress in a bathhouse (notwithstanding his wife being in Tangier), his &#145;damns and curses&#146;, his placing himself above the law, his expulsion of the Jews from Tangier, his flagrant corruption (&#145;nothing being sold in the town without his licence&#146;), and his intimidation of all who crossed him. It was even rumoured that Kirke had arranged the murder of two of his creditors. &#145;The tyranny and vice of Kirke in his way is stupendous.&#146; He was &#145;a very brute&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tangier Papers</span>).<br>
<br>After the evacuation of Tangier, Kirke arrived in England in early 1684, where his Tangier regiment was renamed the Queen's regiment of foot. The regiment retained its colours depicting a paschal lamb, from which it was nicknamed Kirke's Lambs. During Monmouth's western rebellion of 1685 he commanded his regiment at the battle of Sedgemoor on 6 July 1685, in which the Lambs were one of the four infantry regiments present in the royal army. Three days after the battle, in which Monmouth's men were scattered, Kirke:<blockquote>ordered several prisoners at Taunton to be hanged up; and being then at an entertainment, as every new health was drunk he had a fresh man turned off; and observing how they shaked their legs in the agonies of death, he called it dancing, and ordered music to play to them. (Stackhouse, 234)</blockquote>This signalled the start of a six-week campaign of pacification that has since become notorious, although at the time he was censured by the government not so much for brutality but for selling pardons to suspected rebels before they could be brought to the assizes. In August that year he was promoted to brigadier. According to Bishop Burnet, Kirke gave &#145;as smart a reply as any&#146; when it was suggested that he change his religion by embracing Catholicism. &#145;He told them that he was unhappily pre-engaged, for that if ever he changed he had promised the King of Morocco to turn Mahometam&#146;  (Stackhouse, 249). In the autumn of 1688 he was one of the chief plotters in the army against King James, but was nevertheless sent on ahead of the main forces to Warminster to block the advance of the prince of Orange's invading army. On 19 November 1688 he sent Patrick Sarsfield off towards the enemy, which resulted in the bloody skirmish at Wincanton, but shortly afterwards was himself arrested in Salisbury for attempting to desert to William. He was sent back to London, but was released by the privy council, who claimed to find no evidence against him.<br>
<br>After the revolution Kirke was promoted by William III to major-general, and on 29 April 1689 was placed in charge of the Londonderry relief force. Delays and bad weather prevented him from arriving in Lough Foyle until 11 June. Having seen that there was a boom across the river below the city, he called a council of war and made the much criticized decision to wait for reinforcements so that Londonderry might be relieved from the land. He detached 600 men from the fleet to set up a fort on the Isle of Inch on Lough Swilly, which had the effect of dividing the Jacobite forces then threatening Enniskillen. On 14 July he sent a message to Londonderry advising the defenders to &#145;be good husbands to your victuals and by God's help we shall overcome these barbarous people&#146;  (Milligan, 324), and then sailed to Inch. He arrived to find a message from the city that the garrison was down to its last provisions, and another from Schomberg ordering him to attempt the relief. He sailed back to Lough Foyle and ordered three ships to sail up to the city. On 28 July the boom across the river was broken and all three vessels reached the quayside in Londonderry. On 31 July the Irish army raised the siege and marched away.<br>
<br>On 4 August Kirke processed through Londonderry with Walker and Michelburne and was f&ecirc;ted as the city's deliverer. Three days later he re-formed the forces in Londonderry by halving the number of regiments and officers, an act which was greatly resented in the city. His response was to erect a new gallows, on which he threatened to hang those who complained, and to issue orders to the sentries to disarm everyone leaving the city. Writing of Kirke at this time, Sir James Caldwell asked &#145;whether profest atheism and debauchery are fit weapons to beat down popery?&#146;  (Cunningham and Whalley, 211). From Londonderry Kirke marched to Coleraine, which was abandoned by the Irish on his approach, and then to Dundalk, where he joined Schomberg's army in early September. He took an active part in the battle of the Boyne (1 July 1690), where he &#145;went from one place to another, as the posture of affairs required&#146;  (Story, 82). After the fall of Dublin he was sent on ahead to summon Waterford, which surrendered to him on 25 July.<br>
<br>Kirke took part in the unsuccessful siege of Limerick in August 1690, where he was involved in directing the fighting in which the outlying forts were captured. After the raising of the siege he led a relief force in September 1690 to Birr, which was being attacked by the duke of Berwick. Kirke had most of the town pulled down for firewood, garrisoned and fortified the castle, and ordered that all houses between Birr and Banagher be burnt. He spent the following winter based in Mullingar, from where he led a raid towards Athlone in March 1691.<br>
<br>In April 1691 Kirke was one of three generals relieved of their commands in Ireland and posted to the continent. He arrived in England on 30 May 1691, was promoted to lieutenant-general, and joined King William's army in Flanders. He served under the prince of Waldeck for the rest of that year's campaign against the French, but fell ill while in the camp at Ninove. He was taken to Brussels to recuperate but died there on 31 October 1691. According to Bishop Wilson  (<span class="italic">Works of Thomas Wilson</span>, 7 vols., 1847&#150;63, 6.372) Kirke's final sufferings were the same as those of King Antiochus: &#145;Whiles he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell away, and the filthiness of his smell was noisome to all his army&#146;  (<span class="roman">2 Maccabees</span> 9:9). His successor as colonel of the Queen's regiment in 1696 petitioned the Treasury for &pound;1000 because Kirke &#145;had received the pay of the regiment and applied it to his own use&#146;  (Redington, 524).<br>
<br>His eldest surviving son, <a name="cosubject_15665"></a><span class="headword">Percy Kirke</span>  (1683&#150;1741), was commissioned as an ensign at the age of one, a <span class="occ">lieutenant</span> in his father's regiment at the age of five, and a captain when he was six (and was placed on the sick list by his father when the regiment was reviewed in Dundalk in October 1689). At the age of nineteen he took part in the raid on Vigo (1702) and at twenty-four commanded his father's old regiment at the battle of Almanza (1707), where he was captured. He purchased the colonelcy in 1710 and commanded his regiment in the disastrous Canadian expedition of 1711. From 1730 his regiment was stationed in Gibraltar. He was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1739. He died a bachelor and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his niece raised an elaborate monument to him.<br>
