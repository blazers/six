<span class="headword">Whitworth, Sir  Joseph</span>, baronet  (1803&#150;1887), <span class="occ">mechanical engineer and machine tool manufacturer</span>, was born at Stockport on 21 December 1803, the son of Charles Whitworth (1782&#150;1870) and Sarah (1780&#150;1814), daughter of Joseph Hulse. His father was a loom framemaker in the textile industry who, when his wife died in 1814, put his three young children in the care of foster parents and took advantage of an offer to train for the Congregationalist ministry. Joseph, who was eleven at the time, seems never to have spoken to his father again.<h2>
<a name="Educationearlycareerandmarriage"></a>Education, early career, and marriage</h2>Whitworth's childhood was extremely hard, but he appears early to have shown aptitude in working with machinery. He formed the conviction that he would be best able to develop this skill in Manchester, and took the first opportunity to move there in search of engineering employment. There in 1821 he was employed by Crighton &amp; Co., a leading firm of textile machine-makers, as a working mechanic. His first ambition was to be a good workman, and he often in later years said that the happiest day he ever had was when he first earned journeyman's wages.<br>
<br>In February 1825 Whitworth married Fanny Ankers (1800&#150;1870), the daughter of a bargemaster of Tarvin in Cheshire, and shortly afterwards entered the workshop of Maudslay and Field in the Westminster Bridge Road, London. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18357/', "Henry Maudslay")</script> recognized his exceptional talent, and placed him next to one of his most capable mechanics, John Hampson, a Yorkshireman. It was while working for Maudslay that, after intensive effort, Whitworth discovered the means of creating a truly plane surface, by means of which for all kinds of sliding tools frictional resistance might be reduced to a minimum.<br>
<br>The most accurate planes, which were essential in the manufacture of steam engine valves, printing press tables, and in lathes and planing machines, had hitherto been obtained by first planing and then grinding the surface. &#145;My first step&#146;, Whitworth said, <blockquote>was to abandon grinding for scraping. Taking two surfaces as accurate as the planing tool could make them, I coated one of them thinly with colouring matter and rubbed the other over it. Had the two surfaces been true the colouring matter would have spread itself uniformly over the upper one. It never did so, but appeared in spots and patches. These marked the eminences, which I removed with a scraping tool till the surfaces became gradually more coincident. But the coincidence of two surfaces would not prove them to be planes. If the one were concave and the other convex they might still coincide. I got over this difficulty by taking a third surface and adjusting it to both of the others. Were one of the latter concave and the other convex, the third plane could not coincide with both of them. By a series of comparisons and adjustments I made all three surfaces coincide, and then, and not before, knew that I had true planes.</blockquote>This account gave less credit than was due to Maudslay, who had previously insisted on his workmen using good plane surfaces. But the importance of Whitworth's improvement can hardly be overestimated, for it laid the foundation of an entirely new standard of accuracy in mechanical construction.<br>
<br>On leaving Maudslay's Whitworth worked at Holtzapffel's, and afterwards at the workshop of Joseph Clement, where Whitworth's aptitude for accurate mechanical work was put to good use in the construction of Charles Babbage's calculating machine. In 1833 he returned to Manchester, where he rented a room with steam power in Chorlton Street, and put up a sign, &#145;Joseph Whitworth, tool-maker, from London&#146;, thus founding a workshop which soon became a model of a mechanical manufacturing establishment. The next twenty years were devoted mainly to the improvement of machine tools, including the duplex lathe, the hollow-box structure, and the quick-return motion and reversing tool in planing machines. These were all displayed and highly commended at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Between 1839 and 1849 he took out fifteen patents for machine tools.<h2>
<a name="Whitworthsmeasuringmachineandotherinventions"></a>Whitworth's measuring machine and other inventions</h2>A natural sequel to the discovery of the true plane was the introduction of a system of measurement of ideal exactness. This was effected between 1840 and 1850 by the conception and development of Whitworth's famous measuring machine. A system of planes was so arranged that of two parallel surfaces the one could be moved nearer to or further from the other by means of a screw, the turns of which measured the distance over which the moving plane advanced or retired. Experience showed that a steel bar held between the two planes would fall if the distance between the surfaces were increased by an extremely small amount. For moving the planes Whitworth used a screw with twenty threads to an inch, forming the axle of a large wheel divided along its circumference into five hundred parts. By this means if the wheel were turned one division, the movable surface was advanced or retired 1/500 of a turn of the screw&#151;that is by 1/10,000 of an inch. This slight difference was found successfully to make the difference between the steel bar being firmly held and dropping. A more delicate machine, made in 1859, made perceptible a difference of one two-millionth of an inch.<br>
<br>As this device was gradually perfected, Whitworth was able to elaborate a system of standard measures and gauges, which soon proved of such enormous utility to engineers and opened the way for the production of standardized parts in tools and machinery. But of all the standards introduced by Whitworth, that of the greatest immediate practical utility was his uniform system of screw threads. He explained this system in a paper read to the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1841, entitled &#145;On a uniform system of screw threads&#146;. Hitherto the screws used in fitting machinery had been manufactured upon no recognized principle or system: each workshop had a type of its own. By collecting an extensive assortment of screw bolts from the different English workshops, Whitworth deduced as a compromise an average pitch of thread for different diameters, and also a mean angle of 55&deg;, which he adopted all through the scale of sizes. The advantages of uniformity could not be resisted, and by 1860 the Whitworth system was in general use. The efficacy of Whitworth's innovations was first generally recognized at the Great Exhibition of 1851, where his exhibit of patented tools and inventions gained him the reputation of being the leading mechanical constructor of the time. He also won praise for his invention of a street cleaning machine, which was widely adopted in British towns.<h2>
<a name="Publiclife"></a>Public life</h2>In 1853 Whitworth was appointed a member of the royal commission to the New York Industrial Exhibition. The incomplete state of the machinery department prevented his reporting upon it, but he made a journey through the industrial districts of the United States, and published upon his return, in conjunction with George Wallis, <span class="italic">The Industry of the United States in Machinery, Manufactures, and Useful and Ornamental Arts</span> (1854). In this he drew special attention to the suitability of the machinery which he had seen at the state armoury, Springfield, Massachusetts, for the production of firearms.<br>
<br>In 1856 Whitworth was president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and at the Glasgow meeting delivered an address in which his favourite projects were ably set forth. He deplored the tendency to excessive size and weight in the moving parts of machines and the national loss by over-multiplication of sizes and patterns. He contemplated the advantage that might be derived from decimalizing weights and measures, and this concern led in 1857 to his paper &#145;On a standard decimal measure of length for engineering work&#146;, delivered at the institution. His papers, five in number, each one of which represented a revolution in its subject, were collected in 1858 as a thin volume, <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Papers on Mechanical Subjects, by Joseph Whitworth, F.R.S.</span>. Whitworth had been elected to the Royal Society in 1857; he was created LLD of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1863, and DCL Oxford on 17 June 1868.<h2>
<a name="Armamentsandfurtherinventions"></a>Armaments and further inventions</h2>Meanwhile, the course of Whitworth's career had been changed by the Crimean War. In 1854 he had been requested by the Board of Ordnance to design and give an estimate for a complete set of machinery for manufacturing rifled muskets. This Whitworth declined to do, as he considered that experiments were required in order to determine what caused the difference between good and bad rifles, what was the proper diameter of the bore, what was the best form of bore, and what the best mode of rifling, before any adequate machinery could be made. Ultimately the government were induced to erect a shooting gallery for Whitworth's use near his home at Fallowfield, Manchester, and experiments began there in March 1855. These showed that the recently adopted Enfield rifle was untrue in almost every particular. In April 1857 Whitworth submitted to official trial a rifle with a hexagonal barrel and .45 inch bore, which in accuracy of fire, in penetration, and in range, &#145;excelled the Enfield to a degree which hardly leaves room for comparison&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 April 1857). Whitworth's rifle was not only far superior to any small arm then existing, but it also embodied the principles upon which subsequent improvements were based, namely, reduction of bore (to .45 inch calibre), an elongated projectile, more rapid twist, and extreme accuracy of manufacture. This rifle, after distancing all others in competition, was rejected by a War Office committee as being of too small calibre for a military weapon. Yet in 1869 a similar committee recommended the .45 inch bore as most suitable for military use.<br>
<br>The inventor found some consolation for the procrastinations of official procedure in the fact that at the open competition promoted by the National Rifle Association in 1860 the Whitworth rifle was adopted as the best-known, and on 2 July 1860 the queen opened the first Wimbledon meeting by firing a Whitworth rifle from a mechanical rest at a range of 400 yards and hitting the bull's-eye. The new rifle was adopted by the French government, and was generally used for target-shooting until the introduction of the Martini-Henry, a rifle in which several of Whitworth's principles were embodied.<br>
<br>In the construction of cannon Whitworth was equally successful, but again failed to secure their adoption by the British military authorities. In 1862 he made a rifled gun of high power (a 6 mile range with a 250 lb shell). But this gun, despite its unrivalled ballistic power, was rejected by the Ordnance board in 1865. It seems likely that the keen rivalry between Whitworth and Sir William (later Lord) Armstrong in the manufacture of artillery, and the ambivalent attitude of the War Office towards both, substantially retarded the progress of British artillery for nearly twenty years.<br>
<br>It was after the termination of this &#145;battle of the guns&#146; that Whitworth made the greatest of his later discoveries. Experience had taught him that hard steel guns were unsafe, and that the safeguard consisted in employing ductile steel. A gun of hard steel, in case of unsoundness, explodes, whereas a gun of ductile steel indicates wear by losing its shape, but does not fly to pieces. When ductile steel, however, is cast into an ingot, its liability to &#145;honeycomb&#146; or form air-cells is so great as almost to neutralize its superiority. Whitworth now found that the difficulty of obtaining a large and sound casting of ductile steel might be successfully overcome by applying extreme pressure to the fluid metal, while he further discovered that such pressure could best be applied, not by the steam hammer but by means of a hydraulic press. Whitworth steel, as it was styled, was produced in this manner from about 1870, and the virtue of its special application in the manufacture of guns was soon exploited. In 1883 the gun-foundry board of the United States, after paying a visit to Whitworth's large works at Openshaw, near Manchester, gave it as their opinion that the system carried on there surpassed all other methods of forging.<br>
<br>At the Paris Exhibition of 1867 Whitworth was awarded one of the five &#145;grands prix&#146; allotted to Great Britain. In September 1868, after witnessing the performance of one of the Whitworth field-guns at Ch&acirc;lons, Napoleon III made him a member of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur, and about the same time he received the Albert medal of the Society of Arts for his instruments of measurement and uniform standards.<br>
<br>Whitworth's interest in artillery did not flag, and he continued to make new experiments. He was the first to penetrate armour-plating upwards of 4 inches in thickness, and the first to demonstrate the possibility of exploding shells without using any kind of fuse. In 1873 he gave to the world his own version of the points at issue with the Ordnance department in <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Papers on Practical Subjects: Guns and Steel</span>. The unfortunate treatment to which he was subjected was due in part, no doubt, to his plain and inflexible determination. Whitworth always refused to modify a model which he knew to be right out of deference to committees whom he regarded as incomparably his inferiors in technical knowledge.<br>
<br>Whitworth appears to have become increasingly irascible and domineering as he grew older, but he was always attentive to the welfare of his own workers. In 1874 he converted his extensive works at Manchester into a limited liability company. Whitworth, his foremen, and others in the concern, twenty-three in number, held 92 per cent of the shares, and had practical control; no goodwill was charged, and the plant was taken at a low valuation. At the same time the clerks, draughtsmen, and workmen were encouraged and assisted to take shares of &pound;25 each. Ironically, ten years after his death, on 1 January 1897, the firm was united with that of his great rival Sir William Armstrong at Elswick, with an authorized capital of upwards of &pound;4,000,000.<h2>
<a name="Recreationdeathandassessment"></a>Recreation, death, and assessment</h2>As early as 18 March 1868 Whitworth wrote to Disraeli, offering to found thirty scholarships of the annual value of &pound;100 each, to be competed for upon a basis of proficiency in the theory and practice of mechanics. In the following year his generous action and his merits as an inventor were publicly recognized by his being created a baronet. Whitworth's first wife, from whom he appears to have become estranged, died in October 1870, and on 12 April 1871 he married Mary Louisa (1829&#150;1896), daughter of Daniel Broadhurst, and widow of Alfred Orrell of Cheadle. Shortly before his second marriage (though still retaining The Firs, Fallowfield, as his Manchester residence) he purchased an estate at Stancliffe, near Matlock. There, upon an unpromising site, amid a number of quarries, he constructed a wonderful park, and he acquired much local celebrity for his gardens, his trotting horses, and his herd of shorthorns. His iron billiard table (remarkable for its true surface), his lawns, cattle pens, and stables were all &#145;models&#146;. As he advanced in age Whitworth formed the habit of wintering in the Riviera; but he was not fond of going abroad, and in 1885 he made for himself at Stancliffe a large winter-garden, hoping to spend the winters at home. He passed one winter successfully in Derbyshire, but in October 1886 he went out to Monte Carlo, and there he died on 22 January 1887. Lady Whitworth survived her husband, dying on 26 May 1896 and, there being no children from either marriage, the baronetcy became extinct. The second Lady Whitworth was buried beside her husband in a vault in Darley Dale churchyard.<br>
<br>For many years before his death Whitworth made no secret of his intention to devote the bulk of his fortune to public and especially educational purposes. But when he died he left the apportionment of his considerable fortune to his wife and trustees. After paying &pound;100,000 to the Department of Science and Art in fulfilment of Whitworth's intention expressed in 1868 of permanently endowing thirty scholarships, the legatees, during the twelve years that elapsed after the testator's death, devoted various sums, amounting in all to &pound;594,416, to educational and charitable purposes. A number of bodies in Manchester benefited especially, including the Whitworth Park and Institute as well as Owens College and the Manchester Technical School.<br>
<br>Whitworth was a pioneer of modern production engineering, outstanding for his refinement and systemization of engineering methods. His mind was that of an experimentalist. A man of few words, he encountered each problem in mechanics by the remark &#145;Let us try.&#146; His pioneering experiments with rifles were a striking example of this. While drawing heavily upon the earlier achievements of others in the development of precision engineering, &#145;he did more than anyone else to bring these standards of accuracy into general engineering practice&#146;  (Musson, &#145;Whitworth and the growth of mass-production engineering&#146;, 126).<br>
