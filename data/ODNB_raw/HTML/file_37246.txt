<span class="headword">Burlamachi,  Philip</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1644), <span class="occ">financier</span>, was born in Sedan, France, of Italian stock. Before settling in London around 1605 he had been active in the Netherlands. He became an English denizen in 1614, and was naturalized by statute in 1624. His marriage to Elizabeth Calandrini cemented important business ties with her family, and one of her brothers, Philip Calandrini, was to be particularly closely associated with him, acting frequently as his agent in Amsterdam in a variety of business, including the pawning of jewels for Charles I in 1625.<br>
<br>Burlamachi's prime corresponds with the period of more active English involvement in continental affairs from about 1618 to 1630. Both the scale of his operations and the degree of his specialization in financial business made him a unique figure in early Stuart England, though he did have a few other economic irons in the fire: among these were a share in the tobacco monopoly, the export of iron ordnance in the 1620s, and huge purchases of East India Company pepper in 1623 and 1628. In 1619, together with other merchants of alien extraction, he was fined in Star Chamber for illegally exporting gold. Both the smallness of his fine of &pound;2000 and the fact that it was later remitted in return for a loan of &pound;10,000 to James I provide early testimony of his value to the government. Beginning with a modest advance of &pound;6000 to James I in 1613, his formal loans culminated in his truly massive advances of the war years 1624&#150;9, amounting to more than &pound;127,000, much of it to finance English and foreign military operations; and this sum does not include the &pound;55,000 which he and the Russia Company magnate Sir Ralph Freeman advanced in 1624. His last recorded loan was &pound;5000 in July 1631.<br>
<br>Impressive though the scale of such formal loans was, they were not the most substantial of Burlamachi's financial services. Hardly less important was his willingness to lend his credit to the government by standing security for its borrowings. Here, his skill in playing the bill market was often of crucial importance, as it was in providing funds abroad for such purposes as the payment of English ambassadors, the purchase of art treasures for the Royal Collection, and, above all, the transmission of subsidies for Charles I's foreign allies. Most spectacular of all were Burlamachi's services as a sort of unofficial paymaster, notably of English and English-financed expeditions abroad, which provided the occasion for a multitude of ways and means advances in anticipation of slowly and irregularly mobilized government funds. His occasional demands for &#145;surplusage&#146; respecting the extent to which his disbursements exceeded his receipts on particular accounts are eloquent illustrations of the scale of these activities: for example, &pound;26,000 for operations in the Palatinate in 1624, and &pound;30,000 on another account in 1630. Both sums were repaid, but by 1631 a further &#145;surplusage&#146; of &pound;12,000 had arisen on the latter account.<br>
<br>By this time the coming of peace had ended Burlamachi's usefulness to the government, but not his own indebtedness, notably for recurring interest, reckoned by him at &pound;14,763 in 1632. His bankruptcy in 1633 was the result of his inability to meet such charges due to the failure of the undertaking from the lord treasurer, Richard Weston, first earl of Portland, to keep up payments due to him. In the meantime he was accorded royal protection from his creditors and the crown's principal debt to him was discharged in 1637. Interest and miscellaneous expenses were, however, quite a different matter, and the fact that it had been in the nature of his employment to disburse vast and unspecified amounts, as he put it, &#145;upon the simple word of the treasurer&#146;, who had died in 1635, did not help matters. He was ultimately allowed &pound;49,752 of such &#145;pretences&#146;, but as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment which did not take in further claims of &pound;46,803. It is perhaps ironic that a financier whose fortunes had foundered on the unreliability of the royal credit should have busied himself three years after his bankruptcy with devising a project for a national bank, the impracticability of which his own fate had spectacularly demonstrated. In 1640 he was given the minor office of master of the posts, but did not retain it beyond 1641, at the end of which year he suffered a short spell of prison for alleged defiance of a parliamentary order. He died in penury in 1644, and it was said that his daughters had to enter into service as paid gentlewomen in order to live.<br>
