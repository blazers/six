<span class="headword">Aylmer,  Matthew</span>, first Baron Aylmer of Balrath  (<em>d.</em> 1720), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, was the second son of Sir Christopher Aylmer (<i>c</i>.1615&#150;1671), first baronet, of Balrath, co. Meath, and his wife, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Plunkett (<i>d</i>. 1671). In 1672 he entered the regiment of the duke of Buckingham, whose page he was&#151;at least, according to tradition, which also claims that he subsequently raised troops in Munster to fight for the Dutch against the French. In January 1677 he was appointed an ensign in the Tangier regiment and became a lieutenant in the earl of Inchiquin's regiment of foot at Tangier in August 1678. Aylmer began his naval career in the Mediterranean Fleet at much the same time, becoming a midshipman aboard the galley <i>Charles</i> in October 1677 and her lieutenant in April 1678; he served in her until 9 January 1679 when he was appointed captain of the double sloop <i>Chatham</i> by Arthur Herbert, the admiral on the station and Aylmer's patron. He subsequently held the commands of the prize <i>Date Tree</i> (1679) and the fireship <i>Castle</i> (1679&#150;80) in the Mediterranean, and of the <i>Swan</i> on the Irish coast from July 1680 to 10 January 1682, when he was given command of the prize <i>Tiger</i> by &#145;his majesty's special command&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 3/278, pt 2, p. 5), and returned to the Mediterranean to rejoin Herbert.<br>
<br>In 1682 Aylmer carried to England the news of Herbert's successful conclusion of a treaty with Algiers. Samuel Pepys encountered him in the Mediterranean in 1683&#150;4, where he was still commanding the <i>Tiger</i>, and was distinctly unimpressed. Aylmer's carpenter told Pepys that his captain made &#145;good voyages&#146; (transporting merchant goods in a warship for a commission) and had also &#145;made love to a young woman and lain both with her and her mother, and borrowed a great many hundred pounds of them&#146;  (Chappell, 137). Aylmer was described as one of Herbert's &#145;creatures&#146; and one of &#145;the greatest libertines of the fleet&#146;, who regularly badgered his patron for &#145;good voyages&#146; but was &#145;a very coward&#146; who would &#145;stay in the Navy [no] longer than till he has got two or three thousand pounds in his pocket&#146;  (ibid., 186&#150;7, 236). Pepys believed that Aylmer, a man of &#145;mean mind&#146;, &#145;deserved &hellip; to be hanged&#146; for striking his flag to the Spanish at Cadiz on 5&#150;6 July 1683, though he and his fellow captain Cloudesley Shovell had been heavily outnumbered  (ibid., 167, 184). In the late 1670s or 1680s Aylmer married Sarah Ellis (<i>d</i>. 1710); they had at least four children.<br>
<br>Pepys's hostility (born of his hatred of Aylmer's patron, Herbert), and the groundless charge of being an Irish papist levelled against Aylmer in September 1680 during the Popish Plot crisis, had no discernible effect on his career. From 21 June to 14 July 1685 he commanded the <i>Mediterranean</i>, a hired vessel placed in the Severn estuary to search ships during the duke of Monmouth's rebellion, and on 27 September 1685 he was given command of the galley <i>Charles</i>. He held this position alongside a captaincy in the Queen Dowager's regiment of horse, to which he was commissioned on 1 June 1686. On 1 October 1688 Aylmer became captain of the <i>Swallow</i>, part of the fleet intended to repel William of Orange's invasion force. Aylmer quickly became one of the heads of the Orangist conspiracy in the fleet, having been recruited by the army officers Percy Kirke (an old Tangier colleague) and the second duke of Ormond. In turn Aylmer became an active recruiter for William among the captains of the fleet, and was described as one of eight who were prepared to defect with their ships to the prince's side. Aylmer smuggled William's letter to James II's admiral, Lord Dartmouth, into the admiral's toilet, and carried back to the prince Dartmouth's reply, effectively surrendering the fleet and praising Aylmer as a man &#145;entirely devoted to your highness&#146;  (Davies, &#145;Admirals&#146;, 86).<br>
<br>The success of the revolution made Aylmer's career. He was promoted to command the <i>Mary</i> on 22 December 1688 and was subsequently warmly recommended in particular by Herbert's rival, Edward Russell, who said of him in February 1690 that &#145;I am not biased with friendship to him though I love him extremely, but he is really a very useful man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 2.271). Aylmer commanded the <i>Mary</i> at the battle of Bantry Bay on 1 May 1689; she sustained severe damage to her rigging and sails, as well as taking fourteen shots in the hull, having three guns split, and losing one man dead and seven wounded. He subsequently moved to the <i>Suffolk</i> in Russell's division of the Blue squadron, and in 1690 commanded the <i>Royal Katherine</i> at the battle of Beachy Head. Over the winter of 1690&#150;91 he took fourteen ships to the Mediterranean to confirm the treaties with the Barbary corsairs and to convoy English trade there. In September 1691, in command of the <i>Monck</i> in the North Sea, he took a large Dunkirk privateer off Scarborough. In spring 1692 he took command of the first-rate <i>London</i>, serving in her at the battle of Barfleur as second to Russell's flagship, the <i>Britannia</i>.<br>
<br>Aylmer became a rear-admiral on 8 February 1693 and a vice-admiral following Sir John Ashby's death in June; he was also a commissioner of the navy from 25 March 1694 to 16 July 1702. Throughout the 1690s Aylmer clearly relied heavily on the continuing patronage of Russell, whose whig politics he shared: in 1692 another admiral complained that &#145;Mr Russell has been tampering with [the earl of Portland] and others on the score of some favourite of his, and I believe it to be Mr Elmour [<i>sic</i>]&#146;  (<span class="italic">Finch MSS</span>, 4.192). In 1694 he was Russell's second-in-command in the Mediterranean, assuming acting command in September when the admiral was struck with dysentery. Following the treaty of Ryswick, Aylmer was elected MP for Dover on 15 December 1697 in the interest of Russell's whig junto, and continued to serve as such, apart from an interruption in 1713&#150;15, until his death; additionally, he became governor of Deal Castle in 1701.<br>
<br>In 1698&#150;9 Aylmer went again to the Mediterranean to confirm the treaties, flying his flag in the <i>Boyne</i>, but his animosity towards George Churchill caused his retirement from active service in November 1699 following the latter's appointment to the Admiralty board. The death of the queen's husband, Prince George, in 1708 permitted Russell's return to the Admiralty, and Churchill's retirement in November 1709 allowed Aylmer to become commander-in-chief. However, a comparatively unsuccessful engagement with a French squadron in July 1710 (only one warship and one merchantman were taken) contributed to his displacement in January 1711. George I's accession, and the consequent return of the whigs to favour, led in 1714 to Aylmer's reappointment as commander-in-chief, in addition to appointments as governor of Greenwich Hospital (6 November 1714) and ranger of Greenwich Park. He was primarily responsible for the establishment of what was to become the Royal Hospital school. He was appointed to the Admiralty board on 16 April 1717, resigning on 19 March 1718 following his appointment on the previous day as rear-admiral of Great Britain. On 1 May 1718 he was created Baron Aylmer of Balrath in the Irish peerage. Aylmer's and his wife's children included a son Henry, who succeeded to the title, and who, along with his son-in-law Sir John Norris and his nephew Sir Peter Warren, also became an admiral; their daughters were Elizabeth, Sarah, and Lucy, the last of whom received a portion of &pound;4000 in Aylmer's will, dated 7 June 1720. A contemporary said of him that he had &#145;a very good head, indefatigable and designing; is very zealous for the liberties of the people; makes a good figure in the parliament, as well as the fleet; is handsome in his person, a brown man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of the Secret Services</span>, 107). However, Jonathan Swift was as uncharitable as Pepys had once been, describing Aylmer as &#145;a virulent party man, born in Ireland&#146;  (<span class="italic">Prose Works</span>, 10.285). Aylmer's brother George was also a prominent naval captain and another of the leading lights in the Williamite conspiracy in the fleet in 1688: originally a page to the earl of Arlington, he became a captain in 1680, was described by Pepys as &#145;a swearing, idle fellow&#146;  (Chappell, 194&#150;5), and was killed as captain of the <i>Portland</i> at the battle of Bantry Bay (1 May 1689). Matthew Aylmer died in the Queen's House at Greenwich on 18 August 1720 and was buried five days later in St Alfege's Church, Greenwich.<br>
