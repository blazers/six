<span class="headword">Henry</span> <span class="st"> [Henry de Reyns; <em>called </em>Master Henry]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1243&#150;1253), <span class="occ">master mason</span>, was invariably called &#145;Henry&#146; or &#145;Master Henry&#146; during his lifetime. However, a charter issued by his son Hugh in 1261 refers to him as &#145;de Reyns&#146;; and following much discussion it is now generally agreed that this refers to Rheims in Champagne, whose cathedral was a major influence on Henry's most important work, the rebuilding of the abbey church of Westminster. Despite that church's many French-derived features, it seems clear that it is the design of an architect trained in the English Gothic tradition. The most likely significance of Henry's sobriquet is therefore that it commemorates a period of work at Rheims, perhaps as a journeyman in the 1220s or 1230s. He disappears from the records after June 1253 and the brevity of his <i>floruit</i> suggests that he may have died young.<br>
<br>The earliest mention of Henry occurs in 1243, when he was granted a robe of office as master mason at Windsor Castle. The work in hand was a complex of buildings in the lower ward which had been begun in 1240. These comprised chambers for the king and queen, a large chapel dedicated to St Edward, and a cloister linking the chambers and chapel. Only the north wall and west porch of the chapel survive, the former sufficient to indicate that the chapel proper was rectangular in plan and divided into five bays. In a letter of August 1243 Henry III ordered that the vault was to be of timber simulating stonework. Clearly, a chapel which lacked a stone vault and an apse was no slavish copy of any French prototype; however, the treatment of the bases in the arcading on the external face of the north wall derives specifically from Rheims Cathedral. A hint that the windows of the chapel anticipated those of Westminster Abbey in containing Rheims-derived bar tracery is the reference in a 1295 schedule of glazing repairs to at least one circular cusped opening.<br>
<br>In March 1245 Henry was sent to York to inspect the castle defences. The outcome was the building from 1246 of the existing keep on the motte (Clifford's Tower). Its quatrefoil plan, which has no English precedent but resembles the hundred-year-old towers at &Eacute;tampes and Ambl&eacute;ny, presumably reflects Henry's knowledge of French architecture. Its detailing includes English Gothic ornaments not found in Henry's documented works and was doubtless due to a locally recruited master. Apart from acting as &#145;viewer&#146; (inspector) of a tower built at the Tower of London in 1250, the remainder of Henry's career seems to have been devoted entirely to the greatest enterprise of Henry III's reign, the rebuilding of Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Demolition of the eastern parts of the Romanesque abbey church began in July 1245, by which time Henry must have produced a design for the king's approval. The progression to the more space-demanding activity of drawing the full-size details needed for the execution of the masonry is probably reflected in the king's grants of May and June 1246 of two houses in Westminster to be used for Henry's work. Since Henry III did not see for himself any of the Gothic cathedrals of northern France until 1254, he may well have imagined that he was about to become the patron of a great church in the French style. If so, he was mistaken. Admittedly, the basic format and many of Westminster's details were fairly authentically French and would have registered as novel to someone familiar with only English architecture, but Henry, whether at his royal master's prompting or not, was clearly attempting a synthesis of the two national traditions. The great height, the elongated proportions of the bays, the apsidal plan of the east end, the tracery&#151;especially that of the rose windows in the transepts&#151;and the cavernous portals of the north transept fa&ccedil;ade all bespeak a determination to emulate French prototypes; yet their effect is transformed by Henry's adherence to the key characteristics of English Gothic, namely thick-wall structure and its concomitant ornamental complexity. The one feature of the abbey which suggests that Henry III had an informed knowledge of French Gothic is the use throughout the upper and lower levels of the lateral elevations of two-light-and-oculus windows. Their purpose was evidently to evoke the French church functionally analogous to Westminster, the coronation cathedral of Rheims (begun 1211), a building which was out of date in stylistic terms. Left to himself, it is likely that Master Henry would have made more prominent use of recent Parisian tracery patterns, which the chapter house and the north part of the east cloister walk show that he knew. Although Henry's work was impossible to imitate wholesale, by virtue of its exceptional size and sumptuousness, its influence proved sufficient to end the insularity hitherto characteristic of thirteenth-century English Gothic architecture.<br>
