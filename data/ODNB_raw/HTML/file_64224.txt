<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bell,  (Frank) Graham</span>  (1910&#150;1943), <span class="occ">painter and writer</span>, was born on 21 November 1910 near Brakpan, Johannesburg, Transvaal, the eldest of the three sons of Frank Graham Bell (1874&#150;1948), a British mining engineer, and his wife, Marjorie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hewitt (1888&#150;1979). The family spent from 1915 to 1922 in England, where Bell attended schools in Berkshire and Dorset, then went back to South Africa and settled in or near Durban. From 1923 Bell, a strong and intelligent boy, was at Michaelhouse School, Balgowan, Natal, leaving in 1926 with unrealistic dreams of being an artist. He intermittently attended art classes at the Natal Technical College and exhibited pictures in Durban; but under family pressure he took work in a bank, then in 1929 undertook to manage a sugar farm in Zululand bought by his father. Within a year, however, he decamped to Durban, where he subsisted precariously, living with friends and devoting himself to painting to such effect that he could exhibit some forty oils at the Durban Art Gallery in March 1931. These post-impressionist essays were thought daringly &#145;modern&#146;; public attention ensured enough sales to enable Bell, aged twenty, to sail for England that April, accompanied by Eileen (known as Anne) Bilbrough (1909&#150;2001), a designer and gallery assistant, who contributed substantially to their support. They married in London on 23 February 1937, when it was stated that they had been previously married in South Africa on 5 March 1931. Their daughter was born later in 1937; however, increasing discord culminated in a separation in January 1938.<br>
<br>In London, Bell encountered paintings previously known to him only through reproductions, becoming temporarily infatuated with Duncan Grant's work. Hoping to paint and exhibit, he sought friends among fellow painters, many of them former students of the Slade School of Fine Art. But chronic lack of money deflected him: he decorated pottery for Phyllis Keyes, served as an assistant at the Contemporary Arts Society, helped to edit the short-lived journal <span class="italic">London Week</span>, and, increasingly, reviewed for the <span class="italic">New Statesman and Nation</span>. Aesthetic speculations shared by his friends Rodrigo Moynihan and Geoffrey Tibble led him in March 1934 to contribute three amorphous canvases to the exhibition &#145;Objective abstractions&#146; at the Zwemmer Gallery in London; but sensing that this constituted a dead end, he virtually abandoned painting for the next two years.<br>
<br>Discussions with his friend William Coldstream, who was in a similar quandary, eventually rekindled Bell's belief in painting. The two devised &#145;A Plan for Artists&#146;, submitting it early in 1937 to Kenneth Clark, the young (and wealthy) director of the National Gallery. Clark responded by creating a fund offering painters in their situation modest financial support. Artistically, the plan proposed&#151;against the contemporary prevalence of abstraction and surrealism&#151;a return to the exploration and expression, through observation, of the visible world. This approach, corresponding to that of their friends Victor Pasmore and Claude Rogers, led to the opening in October 1937 of a school of drawing and painting. Although Bell was not formally a director of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64717/', "Euston Road School")</script> (as it was later known), its strength, according to Pasmore, largely stemmed from his conviction and sense of purpose.<br>
<br>Following this renewal of confidence, Bell's painting prospered during the next years, albeit against a background of the gathering menace of reactionary political and military forces, which concerned him deeply. He was active in anti-fascist initiatives through exhibitions and his writing; his pamphlet <span class="italic">The Artist and his Public</span> was published in 1939. While effectively homeless (in London he was given house room by Clark, his patron and now his friend), he shared studios with Coldstream and worked frequently with students at the school; he spent weeks at a time painting in Bolton, Lancashire (the seat of the Mass-Observation movement), Dover, Hampshire, Dublin, France, and Suffolk, producing landscapes, portraits, and still lifes. When war came he awaited his call up with undeceived impatience, being finally accepted for aircrew training in September 1940. He passed much of the next year marooned by the RAF on Anglesey with his leg badly broken as a result of playing football. Subsequent training took him back to South Africa, where he was reunited with his parents and gained his commission as an observer. Further intensive training in England was brought to an end on 9 August 1943, when his Wellington bomber crashed on landing at RAF Ossington, near Newark, Nottinghamshire, killing the entire crew. His funeral took place at Golders Green crematorium, London, on 13 August. The one fixed point in these six final itinerant years was his attachment to the art historian (Anne) Olivier Popham (<i>b</i>. 1916)&#151;the subject of a 1938 portrait in the Tate collection&#151;whom, owing to the divorce laws and the disruptions of wartime, he was never free to marry.<br>
<br>The force of Graham Bell's personality and the combative vigour of his writing contrasts with the sensitive restraint and scrupulous tenderness of his painting; yet both uphold realist values with lean, self-critical distinction. In his death British art lost a cohesive and potentially commanding figure.<br>
