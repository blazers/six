<span class="headword">Storer,  James Sargant</span>  (1771&#150;1853), <span class="occ">draughtsman and engraver</span>, was born in Clerkenwell, London, on 28 December 1771, the second child and eldest son in the family of at least three daughters and six sons (some of whom did not survive infancy) of Robert Storer (1746&#150;1833), who belonged to his family's firm of watch and clock makers in Berkeley Court, Clerkenwell, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sargant. He devoted himself to the production of works on topography and architecture, the plates in which, drawn and engraved by himself on a small scale, were distinguished for extreme accuracy and beauty of finish. For some years he was associated with John Greig, another topographical artist, in collaboration with whom he published <span class="italic">Cowper Illustrated by a Series of Views</span> (1803), <span class="italic">Views in North Britain Illustrative of the Works of Burns</span> (1805), <span class="italic">Views Illustrative of the Works of Robert Bloomfield</span> (1806), <span class="italic">Select Views of London and its Environs</span> (1804&#150;5), <span class="italic">The Antiquarian and Topographical Cabinet</span> (1807&#150;11), and <span class="italic">Ancient Reliques</span> (1812). He was one of the artists employed to illustrate J. Britton and E. W. Brayley's <span class="italic">Beauties of England and Wales</span> (1801&#150;16). From 1814 he worked wholly in conjunction with his eldest son<a href="#cosubject_26592"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>, whom he outlived. In religion, James Storer was, like other members of the family, an adherent of Lady Huntingdon's Connexion. On 4 February 1795 he married Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Coe (1775/6&#150;1824), with whom he had at least eleven children (eight sons and three daughters), all of whom were baptized at the connexion's Spa Fields Chapel in Clerkenwell. He lived with his family for some time in Cambridge but died at his house at Islington, London, on 23 December 1853, and was buried beside his son at St James's Chapel, Pentonville. His wife predeceased him. A watercolour by him of St David's Cathedral is in the National Gallery of Wales.<br>
<br>Storer's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_26592"></a><span class="headword">Henry Sargant Storer</span>  (1796&#150;1837)<span class="occ"></span>, born in Clerkenwell on 13 February 1796, was baptized at Spa Fields on 6 March 1796, and educated at High Wycombe (probably at the grammar school). He produced with his father <span class="italic">The Cathedrals of Great Britain</span> (1814&#150;19), pronounced by Pugin to be the most accurate views of those buildings in existence, <span class="italic">Delineations of Fountains Abbey</span> (1820), a work of great excellence, <span class="italic">Views in Edinburgh and its Vicinity</span> (1820), <span class="italic">The University and City of Oxford Displayed</span> (1821), <span class="italic">Delineations of Gloucestershire</span> (1824), and <span class="italic">The Portfolio: a Collection of Engravings from Antiquarian, Architectural, and Topographical Subjects</span> (1823&#150;4). The letterpress of some of these works is believed to have been written by the elder Storer. He and his father also engraved the plates to Thomas Kitson Cromwell's <span class="italic">History of Clerkenwell</span> (1828) and <span class="italic">Walks through Islington</span> (1835) and other similar publications. They issued several sets of views of the town and university of Cambridge, the latest being <span class="italic">Collegiorum portae apud Cantabrigiam</span>. Henry Storer engraved, independently of his father, the plates to Pierce Egan's <span class="italic">Walks through Bath</span> (1819) and a view of Christ's College for the <span class="italic">Cambridge Almanack</span> (1822). He exhibited drawings at the Royal Academy from 1814 to 1836. He died, unmarried, in London on 8 January 1837 and was buried at St James's Chapel, Pentonville.<br>
