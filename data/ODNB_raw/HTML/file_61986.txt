<span class="headword">Veitch family</span>  (<em>per. </em>1768&#150;1929), <span class="occ">horticulturists</span>, ran important nurseries in Devon and London and commissioned several notable plant hunting expeditions. The first family member to come to notice was <a name="cosubject_61373"></a><span class="headword">John Veitch</span>  (1752&#150;1839)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born in Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, in October 1752, the eldest of the five children of Thomas Veitch, gardener to Sir William Scott at Ancrum House, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1780). Apprenticed aged fourteen into the horticultural trade at the nursery of Robert Dickson &amp; Son at Hassendean, he continued his apprenticeship at the Vineyard nursery of James Lee in Hammersmith. He then went to be steward to the estate of Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, ninth baronet, at Killerton, near Exeter, Devon, and in 1780 he married Anna Davidson, with whom he had three sons and three daughters. About 1800 he founded a tree nursery at Budlake, near Killerton. He was also responsible for tree plantings at Luscombe Castle and Poltimore House in Devon. In 1832 he moved to Mount Radford, Exeter, where his son <a href="#cosubject_61374">James [i] Veitch [<i>see below</i>]</a> had recently bought land for a new nursery. John Veitch died at Killerton nursery, Broad Clyst, Devon, on 22 November 1839.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_61374"></a><span class="headword">James [i] Veitch</span>  (1792&#150;1863)<span class="occ"></span>, youngest son of John Veitch, born at Killerton on 25 January 1792, was trained in his father's nursery at Budlake from 1800 to 1810. In 1814 he married Mary Tosswill (<i>d</i>. 1826), with whom he had four sons and a daughter; after her death he married, in 1831, her sister Rebeca Tosswill (<i>d</i>. 1863), who looked after her dead sister's children. He developed the new nursery at Mount Radford from about 1830 and, in partnership with his son <a href="#cosubject_61375">James [ii] Veitch [<i>see below</i>]</a>, acquired the Exotic Nursery of Joseph Knight and Thomas A. Perry, on the King's Road, Chelsea, in 1853. In the 1840s he employed as plant collectors William Lobb in South America and his brother Thomas Lobb in Asia. James died suddenly of heart failure at Buckerel Villa, Heavitree, Exeter, on 14 May 1863, shortly after the death of his wife. He was buried at Broad Clyst<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_61375"></a><span class="headword">James [ii] Veitch</span>  (1815&#150;1869)<span class="occ"></span>, eldest son of James [i] Veitch, was born at Exeter on 24 May 1815. He was apprenticed at Alfred Chandler's nursery in Vauxhall and then with William Rollison, an orchid specialist, at Tooting before returning to Exeter, where in 1838 he married Harriot Reynolds Gould (<i>d</i>. 1879), the daughter of a farmer. They had three sons and four daughters. He moved to Chelsea in 1853 as business partner to his father; the following year he relinquished his interest in the Exeter nursery, which was thenceforth run separately. He also acquired a large site for a nursery at Coombe Wood on Kingston Hill in Surrey. Orchids were his particular interest, and he sponsored several collecting expeditions to South America. He died of a heart attack at his home, Stanley House, King's Road, Chelsea, on 10 September 1869, and was buried in Brompton cemetery. The Veitch memorial medal was instituted in his honour from the proceeds of a subscription raised by nurserymen and members of the Royal Horticultural Society, of whose council he had been a member.<br>
<br>Shortly after James [ii] Veitch became involved with the Chelsea nursery, about 1856 or 1857, his younger brother, <a name="cosubject_61376"></a><span class="headword">Robert Tosswill Veitch</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1821, <em>d.</em> 1885)<span class="occ"></span>, baptized at Broad Clyst on 18 August 1821, returned from the Cape of Good Hope, where he had been an apple farmer, to take charge of the Exeter nursery. In 1864 he established nurseries at New North Road and High Street, Exeter, trading as Robert Veitch &amp; Son. Married to Sarah Jacoba, who was from the Cape, he had four sons and five daughters. He died at Torre, Torquay, Devon, on 18 January 1885.<br>
<br>Robert Tosswill's son <a name="cosubject_61377"></a><span class="headword">Peter Christian Massyn Veitch</span>  (1850&#150;1929)<span class="occ"></span> was born at the Cape of Good Hope. He collected plants for the Veitch firm in Australasia between 1875 and 1878 before going to Britain to succeed his father in charge of the Exeter branch of the business. In 1881 he married Harriette Drew, with whom he three sons and two daughters. He received the Victoria medal of honour of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1916. He died in Exeter, Devon, on 9 March 1929. His daughter, Anna Mildred (1889&#150;1949), became managing director of Robert Veitch &amp; Son Ltd.<br>
<br>Meanwhile in the running of the Chelsea nursery James [ii] Veitch was succeeded after 1865 by his three sons, <a href="#cosubject_61378">John Gould [i] Veitch, [<i>see below</i>]</a> <a href="#cosubject_36637">Harry James Veitch [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and <a name="cosubject_61380"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Veitch</span>  (1844&#150;1880)<span class="occ"></span>. Arthur was born in Exeter on 24 February 1844 and became a partner in the family firm. In 1867 he maried Emily Eliza Drew, with whom he had at least two sons, but he died young on 25 September 1880 at 16 Edith Grove, Fulham Road, London.<br>
<br>Arthur Veitch's eldest brother, <a name="cosubject_61378"></a><span class="headword">John Gould [i] Veitch</span>  (1839&#150;1870)<span class="occ"></span>, was born at Exeter on 17 April 1839. He visited the Far East in 1860 and Australasia in 1864, bringing back many trees which were new to Britain. He was elected fellow of the Linnean Society in 1866. In 1867 he married Jane Hodge; they had two sons, <a href="#cosubject_36638">James Herbert Veitch [<i>see below</i>]</a> and <a href="#cosubject_61381">John Gould [ii] Veitch [<i>see below</i>]</a>. He died at the nursery, Coombe Wood, Kingston Hill, Surrey, on 13 August 1870, aged only thirty-one, when his sons were still in their early infancy.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_61381"></a><span class="headword">John Gould [ii] Veitch</span>, second son of John Gould [i] Veitch, was born on 19 July 1869 at Kingston Hill, Surrey. After attending Westminster School he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated BA in 1890 and MA in 1894. He won soccer blues at Cambridge in 1888&#150;91 and went on to play for England in the Corinthians' (gentlemen amateurs') game against Wales in 1894. He was described as &#145;an ivory-faced hero with a black moustache&#146;  (Grayson, 119) and &#145;a brilliant dribbler in the best Westminster tradition, with a deadly shot that brought him 60 goals in 68 games for the Corinthians&#146;  (ibid.). On 16 December 1894 he married Dorothy Maud, widow of Carl Richard G. Le Doux. He lived at 22 Homefield Road, Wimbledon, Surrey, and died at Wimbledon on 3 October 1914.<br>
<br>John Gould [ii] was a partner in the family firm, but far more important to the business was his elder brother, <a name="cosubject_36638"></a><span class="headword">James Herbert Veitch</span>  (1868&#150;1907)<span class="occ"></span>, eldest son of John Gould [i] Veitch, who was born at Chelsea on 1 May 1868. He was educated at Crawford College, Maidenhead, and in technical subjects in Germany and France before starting work at the Chelsea nursery in 1885. He continued to work there and at Coombe Wood, Surrey, at Langley, Buckinghamshire, and at Feltham, Middlesex. He was elected fellow of the Linnean Society in 1889 and the Horticultural Society. From 1891 to 1893 he toured the world collecting plants for the nursery and published accounts of his travels in the <span class="italic">Gardener's Chronicle</span> (1892&#150;4) and as <span class="italic">A Traveller's Notes</span> (1896). In 1898 James Veitch &amp; Sons was formed into a limited company of which James Herbert became managing director. James Herbert prepared <span class="italic">Hortus Veitchii</span>, privately published in 1906, an invaluable history of the family firm. Shortly after this poor health obliged him to retire from business and his uncle Harry James came out of retirement to take over from him. He died of paralysis at Exeter on 13 November 1907. He was survived by his widow, Lucy Elizabeth Wood, whom he had married in 1898. They had no children.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_36637"></a><span class="headword">Sir Harry James Veitch</span>  (1840&#150;1924)<span class="occ"></span>, the second son of James [ii] Veitch, was born at Exeter on 29 June 1840. He was educated at Exeter grammar school and continued his training at Altona, near Hamburg, and at Paris with the firm of Vilmorin-Andrieux. He joined the Chelsea branch of the firm in 1858 or 1859 and worked at Chelsea, Coombe Wood, and Langley. He took a particular interest in plant hunting and was instrumental in commissioning the notable expeditions of Richard Pearce, a gardener at the Exeter Veitch nursery, to China, Peru, and Bolivia in 1859 and afterwards; of Frederick William Burbidge to Borneo in 1877; and of Ernest Henry Wilson to China and Tibet in 1899&#150;1902 and 1903&#150;5. (Appropriately Wilson received the Veitch memorial medal in 1906.) During Harry James's time at the nursery it established its reputation for orchid hybridization and the successful introduction to British gardens of many exotics. He retired from the firm in 1900, but came out of retirement to manage the firm between 1906 and 1914. (In the years immediately preceding 1914 the firm declined rapidly, and in 1914 much stock had to be sold off.) He was elected fellow of the Linnean Society in 1886. He received the Victoria medal of honour of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1906, and later served as the society's treasurer and vice-president. He was knighted in 1912. He published a manual of Coniferae in 1881 and of orchidaceous plants (1887&#150;94), both of which contain much information about the plants brought to Britain by the firm's collectors. He died at East Burnham Park, Slough, on 6 July 1924. In 1867 he had married Louisa Mary (<i>d</i>. 1921), daughter of Frederick W. Johnston of Stoke Newington. Like James Herbert and his wife they had no children, and, as there was no successor in the family to take over the business, the nursery at Coombe Wood was sold.<br>
