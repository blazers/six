<span class="headword">Musker,  Harold</span>  (1897&#150;1970), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born in Bootle, Lancashire, on 10 March 1897, to Charles Musker, a civil and mechanical engineer, and his wife, Lizzie Ethel. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School until the age of seventeen, when he joined London County and Westminster Bank in December 1914. He was married twice: first to Julia Agnes Draddy in 1927, from whom he was divorced, and then, on 26 December 1946, to Bertha Keith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Strachan, a widow with two young sons. He had at least a daughter.<br>
<br>Between November 1915 and May 1919, Musker served in the Royal Artillery, winning the Military Cross in France. He then spent a year working in London, studying shorthand, and working in Greece for the United States shipping board.<br>
<br>In December 1920 Musker joined the Imperial Bank of Persia, later called the British Bank of the Middle East (BBME), and he was soon posted to Bombay. When he left in 1923, he worked for nearly two years in the bank's London office, before becoming manager of the small Barforush branch in Persia in March 1925. Reputedly one of the brightest of the bank's juniors, he rose rapidly in its service, despite an apparently abrasive and argumentative manner.<br>
<br>After experience in Duzdab, Basrah, Khorramshahr, Kermanshah, Shiraz, and Tehran, where he was assistant and later travelling inspector, Musker became acting deputy chief manager in April 1939. Confirmed in this post in July 1939, he spent the war years in London, serving as acting chief manager between May and October of 1945. In June 1946 he requested a transfer from the bank's foreign service to the London office for personal reasons. Normally this would have blighted his career prospects, but he was by then an experienced member of staff, and was within reach of the chief managership. As a result, Musker joined the London office in April 1947, becoming sub-manager in October of that year. The manager-secretary was a sick man, and over the next few years Musker's influence grew. In January 1951, he was appointed acting London manager and secretary, being confirmed as such in October of that year. He became the bank's first general manager and secretary in July 1952.<br>
<br>Musker has been described as a &#145;short, plump and introspective man, who was both decisive and dictatorial&#146;  (Jones, 38). He exerted great influence over the affairs of the bank, because of his autocratic inclinations and the fact that the average age of the board was relatively high. He was not a great innovator, however. His banking and political judgements were no different from those of most men of his time. Nor did he move in overseas banking circles. His significance lay rather in the fact that he supported and continued the expansion of the bank, which had already started, and which transformed it from a purely Persian into a Middle Eastern institution following the discovery of oil. He was prepared to take the risks of expansion in spite of the political uncertainties of the Middle East, a policy which reaped its reward when the bank was forced out of Iran in 1952. During his time as general manager, thirteen new branches were opened, and the bank went back in to Iran with a joint-venture subsidiary.<br>
<br>Musker quickly established his authority over the bank's board. Members were told only enough for them to come to the decision that he wanted, and he usually got his own way. Indeed, when the then chairman espoused the cause of amalgamation with Chartered Bank, and Musker, finding out at the last minute, objected, it was the chairman who resigned, and Musker who orchestrated the failure of the plan. Musker was furious, C. F. Warr thought, &#145;chiefly because he had not been consulted and second because he did not like the Chartered Bank&#146;  (Jones, 76).<br>
<br>Musker was, however, as enthusiastic about merger with the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank as he was obstructive over that with Chartered. He considered that Chartered, on merger with BBME, would get rid of him and other senior staff, whereas the Hong Kong Bank had had close links with BBME since the 1890s  (Jones, 78). Musker's preferred option materialized and, circulating the staff the day before the merger was announced, he assured them that the BBME would keep its identity and nobody would lose their job. Musker's own position was secure, and indeed he was elected to the BBME's board in July 1960.<br>
<br>Musker retired as general manager in December 1961, and from BBME's board in 1966, settling at Riverlea, Newtown Road, Warwash, Fareham, Hampshire. He died on 30 July 1970 at the General Hospital, Southampton; he was survived by his second wife.<br>
