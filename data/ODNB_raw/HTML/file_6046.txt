<span class="headword">Comyn, Sir  John</span>, lord of Badenoch  (<em>d.</em> 1306), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6045/', "John Comyn, known as the Competitor (d. c.1302)")</script>, and his wife, Eleanor (Marjory in Scottish sources), sister of John de Balliol, later king of Scots. He married Joan de Valence, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29481/', "William de Valence, earl of Pembroke (d. 1296)")</script>, a cousin of Edward I, and had three children&#151;John (<i>d</i>. 1314), Elizabeth (married Richard Talbot), and Joan (married David, earl of Atholl). He was known as &#145;the younger&#146; or &#145;the son&#146; until he inherited his father's extensive estates&#151;the last reference to him as &#145;the son&#146; appears to have been in 1301. He was made a knight by King John (de Balliol) probably soon after 1292.<br>
<br>John Comyn had received the gift of the important manors of Walwick, Thornton, and Henshaw in Tynedale by <i>c</i>.1295 but on his father's death he inherited wide-ranging and vast estates in the Scottish highlands (Badenoch and Lochaber), in Roxburghshire (Bedrule and Scraesburgh), in Dumfriesshire (Dalswinton), in Perthshire (Findogask and Ochtertyre), in the Clyde valley (Machan), in Dunbartonshire (Lenzie and Kirkintilloch), and in Atholl. Lands in England included important estates in Tynedale (Tarset and Thornton) and Lincolnshire (Ulseby). The castles of Lochindorb, Ruthven, Inverlochy, and Blair Atholl made a formidable defence to his power in northern Scotland, while the castle of Dalswinton, and probable castle sites at Machan and Kirkintilloch, added weight to his influence further south. Apart from this substantial landed base, John Comyn inherited powerful family support and a long tradition of involvement at the centre of Scottish politics. His family links&#151;<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6047/', "John Comyn, earl of Buchan (d. 1308)")</script>, who dominated north-east Scotland, was his cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1209/', "King John")</script> was his uncle, and William, earl of Pembroke, was his brother-in-law&#151;had a significant influence on his key role at the forefront of Scottish political affairs from 1296 to 1306.<br>
<br>As a relative of John de Balliol, and one of the leading supporters of his kingship, John Comyn the younger took a prominent role when open rebellion broke out in Scotland against English overlordship in 1296. On 26 March, with seven Scottish earls, he crossed the Solway from Annandale (which had been given to him by King John), burning villages to the suburbs of Carlisle itself before trying unsuccessfully to take the city by storm. He was also present when Hexham Priory was burnt two weeks later, before retreating northwards on news of Edward I's imminent arrival, and he helped to capture Dunbar Castle on 22 April. However, this castle was forced to surrender to Edward I on the 28th, John Comyn having been handed over as a hostage to the English king on the previous day. His wife, Joan, was already in England, having been given letters of safe conduct to go to London as soon as her husband came out in open rebellion. In September 1296 she was given lands worth 200 marks in Tynedale for her support. Along with other Scottish nobles taken into captivity at Dunbar, John Comyn was taken to England where he became a prisoner at the Tower of London. In 1297 he promised to go with the king overseas, and to serve him well and faithfully against the king of France, but by 1298 he was back in Scotland.<br>
<br>The years 1296 to 1298 had been significant for the Badenoch branch of the family. Not only did they have their valuable Northumberland lands confiscated, but the Comyn leadership of the Scottish political community, little challenged since the mid-thirteenth century, no longer went unquestioned after the enforced absence of the chief members of the family from 1296 to 1298. James Stewart (<i>d</i>. 1309), Bishop Robert Wishart (<i>d</i>. 1316), and William Wallace (<i>d</i>. 1305) came to the fore in these years, and Wallace became sole guardian early in 1298. By then John Comyn was once more in opposition to Edward I, as is indicated by the English king's peremptory command on 26 March of that year to Comyn's wife, Joan, to come to London with her children without delay. After the defeat of an English army at Stirling Bridge by William Wallace and Andrew Murray (<i>d</i>. 1297) on 11 September 1297, Edward I had taken the Scottish threat more seriously. He set up headquarters at York in the summer of 1298, and on 22 July defeated the Scots at the battle of Falkirk. John Comyn probably contributed cavalry to the Scottish forces, led by Wallace. According to the fourteenth-century Scottish historian John Fordun, Wallace's defeat was caused by the flight of the cavalry, and he blamed the Comyns for this. However, it is more probable that panic rather than cowardice was the cause of defeat, and it seems unlikely that the Comyns were blamed at the time. Following his defeat, Wallace resigned as guardian, and between July and December 1298 John Comyn the younger and Robert Bruce, earl of Carrick, the future king, were elected joint guardians of Scotland. It is possible that there had been tension between the Comyns and Wallace, who had risen to prominence in their absence. And there was certainly tension between John Comyn and Robert Bruce, probably resulting from the Bruce claim to the Scottish crown, and the strong Comyn championing of Balliol's kingship, during the Great Cause.<br>
<br>These resentments came into the open at a council held at Peebles on 19 August 1299, when an argument over claims to William Wallace's lands led to a brawl between Comyn and Bruce supporters, in the course of which &#145;John Comyn leaped at the earl of Carrick and seized him by the throat&#146;  (Barrow, 107). The bishop of St Andrews, William Lamberton (<i>d</i>. 1328), was elected as guardian alongside Comyn and Bruce to help preserve unity in government, but this unity lasted only until May 1300, when Bruce was forced from office. At a parliament held in Rutherglen on 10 May, Comyn argued with Lamberton, saying that he would no longer serve with him. Another reorganization of the guardianship led to the preservation of unity with Comyn and Lamberton remaining in office, but being joined by Sir Ingram de Umfraville, an ally of the Comyns and Balliol's kinsman. This alliance appears to have dissolved between December 1300 and May 1301, with John Soulis (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1310) appearing as sole guardian at that time. It seems, from official record sources, that Comyn resigned for a short time, although, according to John Fordun, John Comyn remained in office continuously from 1298 to 1304, with John Soulis being associated with the guardianship by John de Balliol's express wish in 1301 and 1302. John Comyn was sole guardian in the autumn of 1302, however, when Soulis went with an embassy to France. Early in 1303 Comyn's leadership of the Scottish political community was again apparent, since on 24 February he was &#145;leader and captain&#146; of the Scottish army which defeated an English force at Roslin. After this victory the Scots, led by Comyn, described by the chronicler Bower as chief guardian of Scotland, and Simon Fraser (<i>d</i>. 1305), harassed the English king's officers as well as the English king's supporters in southern Scotland. They were still active in the autumn of 1303 when they raised Lennox, causing Margaret, countess of Lennox, to ask Edward I's help against John Comyn. Edward's retaliation had already started in the summer of 1303. He marched north to assert English authority, and in October 1303 stayed for a while at Lochindorb, a castle at the heart of John Comyn's northern power base.<br>
<br>A combination of the peace made between France, hitherto Scotland's ally, and England on 20 May 1303, and the realization that the Scots could not muster an army big enough to match the English in pitched battle, led to all the leading Scottish magnates, except William Wallace, Simon Fraser, and John Soulis, submitting to Edward I on 9 February 1304. John Comyn, no doubt in his capacity as sole guardian, negotiated conditions for surrender on behalf of the community of Scotland. Negotiations had begun between the earl of Ulster, the royal commander in the west of Scotland, and Comyn on 6 February. Comyn refused to surrender unconditionally. He demanded firstly an amnesty and restoration of estates for those who had fought against Edward, and secondly that the Scottish people should be &#145;protected in all their laws, customs and liberties in every particular as they existed in the time of King Alexander III&#146;  (Barrow, 130). There was no disinheritance, but not all of Comyn's demands were met&#151;the good old days of Alexander III could not be restored, and varying degrees of exile were imposed on the leading men. Robert Wishart, bishop of Glasgow, for instance, was initially required to leave Scotland for two to three years; in addition, John Comyn, Alexander Lindsay, David Graham, and Simon Fraser were ordered to capture William Wallace and hand him over to Edward. Edward I took over the government of Scotland, appointing his nephew, John of Brittany (<i>d</i>. 1334), as lieutenant of Scotland. John Comyn was one of a council of twenty-two Scots (including Robert Bruce) appointed to advise the new lieutenant.<br>
<br>The savage execution of William Wallace on 23 August 1305 may have raised the level of indignation in Scotland at English overlordship. This forms the background to the infamous murder of John Comyn by Robert Bruce in the Greyfriars Church at Dumfries on 10 February 1306 and Robert Bruce's inauguration as king of Scots six weeks later. According to tradition, first recounted by Scottish chroniclers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, Bruce and Comyn, rivals and the two most powerful nobles in Scotland, made an agreement that Bruce should take the Scottish crown and Comyn should take Bruce's lands in return. Comyn, however, betrayed Bruce and told Edward I of Bruce's plans. After being confronted with his treachery in the church at Dumfries, Comyn quarrelled with Bruce and was murdered along with his uncle, Robert.<br>
<br>More contemporary, though still biased, English accounts give a different angle to the murder, and the narrative of Walter of Guisborough deserves some precedence. According to Guisborough, Bruce feared that Comyn would hinder him in his attempt to gain the Scottish crown, and sent two of his brothers, Thomas and Nigel, from his own castle at Lochmaben to Comyn's castle at Dalswinton, 10 miles away, asking Comyn to meet him at the Greyfriars Church, Dumfries, to discuss &#145;certain business&#146;. It seemed that Bruce wanted to put a plan to Comyn, no doubt involving the revival of Scottish kingship with Bruce on the throne. After initially friendly words, Bruce turned on Comyn and accused him of treacherously reporting to Edward I that he, Bruce, was plotting against him. It seems probable that their bitter antagonisms of the past were instantly revived and that in a heated argument mutual charges of treachery were made. Bruce struck Comyn with a dagger and his men attacked him with swords. Mortally wounded, Comyn was left for dead. Comyn's uncle, Robert, was killed by Christopher Seton (<i>d</i>. 1306) as he tried to defend his nephew.<br>
<br>According to tradition in both Scotland and England, John Comyn was killed in two stages, with Bruce's men returning to the church to finish off the deed. According to Bower, Bruce returned to Lochmaben Castle and reported to his kinsmen James Lindsay and Roger Kirkpatrick &#145;I think I have killed John the Red Comyn&#146;  (Bower, 6.311). Bruce's men returned to the church to make sure that the deed was done, with Roger Kirkpatrick, according to a wholly fabulous tale, exclaiming &#145;I mak siccar&#146;.<br>
<br>What is clear is that Comyn's rivalry with Bruce must have been intense since 1286. The Comyns had suppressed Bruce rebellions in 1286 and 1287, and were strong supporters both of John de Balliol's candidature for the Scottish crown in the Great Cause, 1291&#150;2, and of Balliol's kingship after 1292. John Comyn represented a long tradition of Comyn leadership of the Scottish political community during most of the thirteenth century. He was a major obstacle to Robert Bruce's ambitions, especially as he could make a double claim to the Scottish crown himself, as heir to John de Balliol as well as in his own right. Contemporary English sources like Guisborough emphasize John Comyn's refusal to support Robert Bruce's treachery by overturning the lawful sovereign, Balliol.<br>
<br>The importance of John Comyn's murder was soon recognized in both Scotland and England. Edward I's initial response was phlegmatic, but by 5 April he had appointed Aymer de Valence (<i>d</i>. 1324), Comyn's brother-in-law, as his special lieutenant in Scotland with wide-ranging and drastic powers against Bruce and the alliance between the English and the remaining members of the Comyn family continued until the battle of Bannockburn in 1314. In Scotland, Bruce was forced to follow up the murder by destroying the Comyn power base in the north before being fully assured of his kingship. A civil war thus accompanied the Anglo-Scottish war. In 1306 Edward I ordered Joan de Valence to send her son, John, John Comyn's son and heir, to England where he was to be in the care of Sir John Weston, master and guardian of the royal children. His father's vast landholding was divided up among Bruce's supporters. This John Comyn lost his life, and any hope of retrieving the vast Scottish inheritance of the Comyns of Badenoch, at the battle of Bannockburn, when he fought on the side of Edward II.<br>
