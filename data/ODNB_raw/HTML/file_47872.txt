<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jamieson,  George Auldjo</span>  (1828&#150;1900), <span class="occ">accountant</span>, was born at Castle Hill, Aberdeen, on 1 May 1828, the son of James Jamieson MD, a former naval surgeon. He was educated at Aberdeen grammar school and he graduated from Aberdeen University in 1846. After working in an Aberdeen law firm, he moved to Edinburgh, around 1849, to join his uncle, George Auldjo Esson, in the accountancy firm Lindsay and Esson. Jamieson was soon made a partner and his rapid progress was confirmed when, in 1854, he became a founder member of the Society of Accountants in Edinburgh. In 1879 he was appointed judicial factor in the Orr-Ewing case, notable for its resolution of conflicts between Scots and English law. Jamieson's adept handling of the issues, as well as his appointment as one of the liquidators of the City of Glasgow Bank in 1878, enhanced his growing reputation as one of Scotland's leading chartered accountants.<br>
<br>During the 1880s and 1890s, with Edinburgh maturing as an international financial centre, Jamieson and many of his fellow chartered accountants led the way in directing Scottish capital abroad. Jamieson's personal involvement in foreign investment also grew at this time, and by his death he owned shares in overseas enterprises probated at &pound;51,500.<br>
<br>A significant aspect of Jamieson's business career was his involvement with the Arizona Copper Company, formed in 1882 to purchase mines in a desolate part of the south-western United States. Despite initial optimism, difficulties mounted, and amid rumours of share-rigging by the original board, calls for a man of proven integrity to head the firm led to Jamieson being appointed chairman in November 1883. He guided the firm through a major financial reconstruction and modernization programme, and by 1892, when he toured America, it was firmly set on a course of rising profitability, with accumulated dividends amounting to more than &pound;6 million by 1918.<br>
<br>Jamieson was undoubtedly one of the most successful and influential Scottish chartered accountants in the late nineteenth century. He was a director of numerous companies by the late 1890s, including the Royal Bank of Scotland and the North British and Mercantile Insurance Company, both at the heart of Scotland's close-knit financial community, and was president of the Society of Accountants in Edinburgh, 1882&#150;8. He appears to have been conservative in many respects, and deliberated long over complex issues, but he was also capable of great energy and acumen, as displayed in his overseas investment activities.<br>
<br>A wide knowledge of financial affairs brought him on to a number of royal commissions, including those on mining royalties (1889) and on company law (1895). In 1860 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1887 he attended the Manchester meeting of the British Association, contributing two papers on finance.<br>
<br>Jamieson was for a long period chairman of Edinburgh West Conservative Association, and in 1885 unsuccessfully stood as parliamentary candidate for Edinburgh West. In 1889 he entered Edinburgh city council as member for St Luke's ward, a seat he held until his death, and at various times was chairman of the council's law committee. He was also a commissioner of supply for the city and county of Edinburgh, in which capacity he was an ardent opponent of the municipal takeover of gas, tramway, and electric lighting operations.<br>
<br>Jamieson was married twice&#151;to Mary Jane Souter Robertson, and afterwards to Susan Helena Oliphant. He had five sons (one of whom died in the South African War) and two daughters. Religion played a strong part in his life and he was a member and office bearer of St John's Episcopal Church, Edinburgh, as well as chancellor of the episcopal diocese of Aberdeen. He also supported a number of charitable organizations such as the Edinburgh Association for Incurables.<br>
<br>Jamieson died suddenly at the New Club, Edinburgh, on the evening of 18 July 1900, following an influenza attack. He was buried on 21 July at Dean cemetery, Edinburgh, in a ceremony attended by the earls of Aberdeen and Haddington, and the municipal corporation of Edinburgh. He was survived by his second wife.<br>
