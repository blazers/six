<span class="headword">Butler,  Edmund</span>, earl of Carrick  (<em>d.</em> 1321), <span class="occ">justiciar of Ireland</span>, was a younger son of Theobald Butler (<i>d</i>. 1285), butler of Ireland, and Joan, daughter of John Fitzgeoffrey. He may have visited England as early as 1289, and was certainly of age at the death of his childless elder brother, Theobald (V), in 1299. The death of his mother in 1303 brought him a share of the Fitzjohn lands in England and Ireland, and he also acquired some of the English and Irish estates of the Pippards. In 1302 he married Joan, a daughter of John fitz Thomas Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1316), later first earl of Kildare.<br>
<br>In 1303 Butler was ready to join an Irish expeditionary force to Scotland, but was asked to remain in Ireland for its security. He acted as deputy justiciar from November 1304 to May 1305, when John Wogan was out of the country. During a visit to England in 1309&#150;10 he was knighted by Edward II. He was deputy again from August 1312 to June 1314. In the winter of 1312&#150;13 he organized a major campaign in Leinster which brought the U&iacute; Bhroin of Wicklow to the peace. At a Michaelmas feast in Dublin in 1313 he is said to have dubbed thirty knights. He served once more as justiciar from February 1315 to April 1318, for the last year under Roger Mortimer, who had been appointed king's lieutenant. His period of office coincided both with the invasion of Ireland by the Scots under Edward Bruce and with the great famine of 1316&#150;17. He brought the magnates of Ireland to Dundalk to confront Bruce in July 1315. When the Scots retreated north, he did not follow, assuming (reasonably but wrongly) that the earl of Ulster was capable of defeating them. When Bruce came south early in 1316, he was present at an inconclusive battle at Skerries in Kildare, after which he and other magnates gave hostages and assurances of loyalty to John Hotham, the king's emissary. A year later, when Robert Bruce had joined his brother in Ireland, Butler left Dublin to its own devices and concentrated upon mustering Munster against the Scots. The army he raised confronted them near Limerick in April 1317, leaving King Robert's forces no choice but to retreat, starving. Shortly before Butler died, Edward II issued a declaration &#145;to clear the fair fame of Edmund le Botiller who has been accused of having assisted the Scots in Ireland, that he has borne himself well and faithfully towards the king&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1317&#150;21</i>, 535). Any suspicions seem groundless. It fell to Butler to organize a highly regionalized country in the most difficult circumstances; if his performance was not glorious, it compared favourably with that of Edward II himself and of those who defended the north of England at the same period.<br>
<br>On 1 September 1315 Edward II had granted Butler the manors of Carrick-on-Suir and Roscrea in Tipperary, with the title of earl of Carrick. He was also given return of writs in three Tipperary cantreds, a grant that foreshadowed the later liberty of Tipperary. He was occasionally referred to as earl by the king (and in April 1317 by Pope John XXII); but, perhaps because of its limited endowment, his comital status failed to gain acceptance, and he did not normally use the title. In 1320 the pope released him from a vow to undertake a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela because of the state of Ireland. He spent his last months in England, in March 1321 arranging a marriage (which was outrun by events) between his daughter, Joan, and Roger, the second son of Roger Mortimer, involving the settlement of the Mortimer lands in Ireland on the couple. He died in London on or shortly before 13 September 1321, and was buried the following November at Gowran (Kilkenny), where the bishop of Ossory and the prior of the hospitallers had earlier agreed to supply four priests to pray for his soul and those of members of his family. He was succeeded by his son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50021/', "James Butler")</script>, who in 1328 became first earl of Ormond.<br>
