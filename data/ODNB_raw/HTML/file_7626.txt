<span class="headword">Digby, Sir  Everard</span>  (<em>c.</em>1578&#150;1606), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was the son of Everard Digby (<i>d</i>. 1592) and Maria Digby (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Neale) of Stoke Dry, Rutland. Maria Digby was daughter and coheir of Francis Neale of Keythorpe, Leicestershire. John Gerard the Jesuit says in his account of the Gunpowder Plot that Digby, upon the early death of his Catholic father, was brought up &#145;at the University by his guardians, as other young gentlemen use to be&#146;, but his name does not appear in any surviving record for Oxford or Cambridge  (<span class="italic">Catholics under James I</span>, 88). Gerard, in a glowing portrait, also describes Digby as handsome, 6 feet tall, a complete sportsman and gentleman, skilled at riding and at arms, an accomplished musician and generous patron  (ibid., 87&#150;90). In 1596 he married Mary (<i>c</i>.1581&#150;1653), only daughter of William Mulsho of Gayhurst or Gotehurst, Buckinghamshire. He was appointed to a household office at the court of Queen Elizabeth, and by his own admission &#145;was a pencioner to Quene Elizabeth aboute six yeres, and tooke the othe belonging to the place of a pencioner and no other&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/216/135). The historian of the Elizabethan gentleman pensioners, however, explains that although Digby was associated with the band he was never formally a pensioner  (Tighe, 358). Towards the end of the century he made the acquaintance of Father Gerard, who effected the conversion of both husband and wife. Nevertheless Digby was knighted by the new king, James I, at Belvoir Castle on 24 April 1603, during his journey south to London. Four days afterwards he appears as a gentleman pensioner extraordinary at the queen's funeral.<br>
<br>Little more than two years later, however, Digby's friendship for Robert Catesby, and the latter's need of money to underpin his enterprise, resulted in the admission of Digby to the Gunpowder Plot, early in October 1605, as the two men rode together from Harrowden to Gothurst. He was one of the last to be recruited, and the motive was clearly financial. Sworn to secrecy before, as he insisted, he was told the details of Catesby's secret, he scrupled against the sweeping nature of the design, but took his friend's bland guarantees at face value. &#145;Assure your selfe&#146;, said Catesby, &#145;that such of the nobilitie as are worth the saving shalbe preserved and yet knowe not of the matter&#146;. No one they regarded as a friend, he went on, would suffer in the explosion  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/216/135).<br>
<br>That was sufficient. There can be no doubt that Digby entered into the conspiracy heart and soul. On 4 November he travelled to Dunchurch, the planned rendezvous in Northamptonshire, sending his hounds on ahead&#151;the lure of a day's hunting drew together many of the local Catholic gentry. After supper, however, the arrival of Catesby, Thomas Percy, and other confederates brought news of Guy Fawkes's arrest, and the frustration of all their hopes. Catesby tried a final, desperate lie&#151;the king, he said, had indeed died, now was the time to rise on behalf of the Catholic cause. But no one believed him, and the panic-stricken majority, wishing no part in treason, fled into the night. Digby's brother George was among those at Dunchurch on 5 November, and like so many others he declined to join in an open rebellion against the crown.<br>
<br>Buoyed by desperation, Sir Everard still felt that there was a chance of success; he remained with Catesby, Percy, and their associates, some eighty in number, all told. At eleven that same night the rebels raided Warwick Castle, seizing fresh horses from the stables. But thereafter the tale is a dismal succession of desertions and ultimate disillusion. At Hewell Grange, plundering weapons, the conspirators tried to recruit curious bystanders, announcing that they were &#145;for God and the countrie&#146;. The response underlined the futility of their cause. &#145;One of the countrimen sett his backe to the wall and sett his staff before him saying he was for King James for whome he would live and die and would not goe against him&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/216/119). Digby afterwards recalled how the hopelessness of their predicament gradually dawned on the rebel band. At his examination on 2 December he said &#145;that they in the whole when they had most were not above fiftie horse. And that not one man cam in to take there parte thoughe they expected for verie many&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/216/135).<br>
<br>Perhaps the keenest blow, so far as Digby himself was concerned, was the denunciation of their actions by senior Jesuits. He wrote to the superior, Henry Garnett, on 6 November, asking his pardon for these rash actions and, optimistically, seeking Garnett's support. But Garnett wrote back from Coughton saying that he &#145;marvelled they would enter into so wicked actions, and not be ruled by the advice of frends&#146;  (Nicholls, 63). Digby's wife was also at Coughton at the time, and she came into the room while Garnett and his fellow Jesuit Oswald Tesimond were discussing Digby's letter with the messenger, Thomas Bate. Her reaction is recorded simply and movingly in a letter from Garnett, smuggled out of the Tower of London the following year: &#145;what did shee? Alas what but cry&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/216/241). Some of Garnett's colleagues were slower to condemn the rebels. Tesimond visited the plotters at Huddington that day, with Garnett's knowledge, while another priest, Father Hammond, comforted his co-religionists in their extremity, saying mass at Huddington on 7 November.<br>
<br>At daybreak on Friday 8 November, shortly before his colleagues made their final stand against the sheriff of Worcestershire's men at Holbeach House, Digby rode off with two servants, by his own account to find further reinforcements. Reading between the lines this amounted to desertion, or common sense woefully delayed. No one now truly believed that new recruits were to be found. After trying to outrun the hue and cry he was eventually arrested near Halesowen, at about nine in the morning. Gerard tells how Digby tried to hide in a wood, waiting for nightfall, and how he was tracked to a dry ditch by the pursuing forces, following his horse's hoofmarks. &#145;Here he is, here he is&#146;, cried the excited posse. Digby rode out to meet them. &#145;Here he is indeed, what then?&#146; he answered. At first he hoped to break through them, drawing on superior horsemanship, but recognizing at last the overwhelming odds he surrendered, in order, says Gerard:<blockquote>to have some time before his death for his better preparation, and withal out of a desire (as it afterwards appeared) to have done some service to the Catholic cause by word, sith he saw he could not do it by the sword. (<span class="italic">Catholics under James I</span>, 111)</blockquote>He was taken to London and lodged in the Tower, where to begin with he tried to insist that he had first heard of the plot on 5 November. But the investigators had Guy Fawkes's and Thomas Winter's evidence to hand, and confronted with this Digby admitted prior knowledge.<br>
<br>Digby remained a prisoner while all the evidence was sifted carefully by the privy council and its agents. A series of letters to his family was smuggled out of the Tower, preserved by his sons as precious relics, and rediscovered among the papers of his eldest child only in 1675. Written over the two and a half months between arrest and trial they prove that he was never, despite many lurid stories spread down the years, subjected to torture, although in one letter he fancied that torture had been &#145;in a fashion, offered&#146; to him  (Barlow, 248). The truth is that after the initial panic and confusion in the days immediately after 5 November the prisoners were well looked after in the Tower, to the extent that they wondered at the motives behind their treatment. Digby's letters make painful reading, for they show an idealistic, poetic, faithful young man distracted by the dreadful fate he has brought upon himself and his family. He tries to defend Gerard and other Jesuits, attempts to excuse the savagery of Catesby's design, but also offers in one bizarre letter to secure the services of a priest who might visit Rome and obtain from the pope guarantees that any Catholic setting out &#145;to disturbe the kinges quiet and hapie raygne&#146; will be excommunicated. He mixes the offer with threats, warning that Catholics will not stand quietly by and let James treat them as Elizabeth had done. Not surprisingly the earl of Salisbury rejected the proposal out of hand (TNA: PRO, SP 14/17/10; Barlow, 245).<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Digby's wife was facing up to the vindictiveness of local authorities in Buckinghamshire. She petitioned Salisbury for relief from the depredations of the sheriff, who had permitted her house to be ransacked. The lord chief baron of the exchequer, Sir Thomas Fleming, supported her, censuring the sheriff's actions in uncompromising terms, and the council ordered measures for her relief, somewhat ineffectively implemented.<br>
<br>Digby was arraigned with seven others in Westminster Hall on 27 January 1606. Because his treason was first committed in Northamptonshire he was tried upon a separate indictment at the end of the day. Alone among the eight accused he pleaded guilty. At the same time he insisted that the king had reneged upon promises of toleration for Catholics, and mitigated his offence by maintaining that affection for Catesby and love of the Catholic cause had prompted his actions. The earls of Northampton and Salisbury refuted these statements at some length. His arguments entirely failed to sway the court, but Digby's gallantry nevertheless impressed many in the packed hall. He sought a gentleman's death by the axe, begged mercy from the king for his young family, and left the court with a grand flourish, bowing to the lords commissioners and asking their forgiveness. &#145;God forgive you,&#146; they replied, &#145;and we do&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 2.194).<br>
<br>No place of execution was specified at the trial, and the matter may have been given further consideration over the next forty-eight hours. However, on 30 January Digby and his co-conspirators Robert Winter, John Grant, and Thomas Bate were drawn on traitors' hurdles through streets lined with guards recruited from among the householders of London. Their destination was St Paul's Churchyard, where a gallows had been erected. All four were hanged, drawn, and quartered. The first to suffer, Digby met his death bravely.<br>
<br>Everard and Mary Digby had two sons. Digby took an affecting farewell of his children in his last surviving letter, dated 23 January. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7629/', "Sir Kenelm Digby")</script> was the elder. The younger boy, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24540/', "John Digby")</script>, knighted in 1635, died while fighting for his king in 1645.<br>
