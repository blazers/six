<span class="headword">Swinhoe,  Robert</span>  (1836&#150;1877), <span class="occ">diplomatist and naturalist</span>, was born on 1 September 1836 in Calcutta. His family had served British interests in India for several generations; his father, Robert, was a lawyer in Calcutta. The Swinhoe family (variously spelt Swinho, Swinhow, Swindhoe or even Swynnow) originally came from Northumberland. Robert returned to England with his parents while still an infant. He studied at King's College, London, before matriculating at the University of London in 1853. In 1854 he was given a temporary position as interpreter in the foreign service in Hong Kong; he travelled out with his wife, Christina (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lockie). In 1855 he was transferred to the British consulate at Amoy (Xiamen); he was promoted second assistant there in 1856 and he later worked in Shanghai.<br>
<br>In March 1856 Swinhoe visited Taiwan and, as well as performing his official duties, he amassed the first ornithological collection ever made there. With collections he made later in China and Taiwan, it is of considerable scientific importance. His first scientific paper, &#145;Remarks on the fauna of Amoy&#146;, appeared in <span class="italic">The Zoologist</span> in 1858.<br>
<br>In 1858 HMS <i>Inflexible</i> sailed from Amoy to Taiwan, with Swinhoe as interpreter. They explored the entire coast, and penetrated considerable distances inland. Swinhoe made important collections of animals and plants. In 1860 he was recalled from leave to act as staff interpreter for General Napier and the combined English and French forces during the north China campaign, of which he published a <span class="italic">Narrative</span> in 1861.<br>
<br>In December 1860, at the age of twenty-four, Swinhoe was appointed vice-consul in Taiwan, the first foreign diplomatist to be based there. He became ill in November 1861 and went back to Amoy for treatment, returning to Taiwan a month later. For the next year the British consulate was based on the SS <i>Adventure</i>, moored in the Tamsui (Danshui) River, after which it was moved to San Domingo, the old Spanish fort in Tamsui.<br>
<br>Swinhoe returned to London in May 1862 due to illness. In Britain he was elected honorary member of the British Ornithologists' Union. His highly praised paper &#145;On the mammals of the island of Formosa&#146; was published in 1862. In 1863 he compiled the first list of Chinese birds, updated in 1871, which increased the known species of that country from 474 to 675.<br>
<br>In 1863 Swinhoe returned to Tamsui to resume his duties. Here he built an aviary for captive breeding of the rare, endemic Swinhoe's pheasant. In spring 1864 he explored the Keeling and Suao areas, and later visited the Pescadores and the Kaohsiung&#150;Hengchun coast. In August 1864 he was transferred to Kaohsiung, being promoted to consul in 1865. In 1866 he became consul at Amoy, then at Ningpo (Ningbo) in 1867. Here he began to suffer from paralysis, and was transferred to the healthier station of Chefoo (Yantai) in 1873. Ill health did not stop Swinhoe's ornithological studies, for he arranged to be carried about the countryside in an assortment of wheelbarrows and sedan chairs.<br>
<br>In October 1875 Swinhoe was retired on medical grounds and returned to London, where he was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1876 and continued to work on his extensive natural history collections. He died at his home at 33 Carlyle Square, Chelsea, on 28 October 1877; his mortal paralysis is thought to have been caused by syphilis. Very little is known of his personal life, although he mentions a child in an official letter dated 1862. Swinhoe left his estate, valued at under &pound;3000, to his widow. He had at least two younger brothers, Peter and Charles (1836&#150;1923). The latter also became a famous naturalist; a colonel in the Indian army, he collected an important series of birds in Afghanistan between 1880 and 1881, and was a world expert on Indian lepidoptera.<br>
<br>Swinhoe's extensive travels in China, and particularly Taiwan, resulted in the discovery of many new forms of animals and plants. He published over 120 articles on natural history, and left extensive collections (the birds alone numbering 3700), most of which are at the Natural History or Liverpool museums. Among the many forms named after him, probably the most famous are Swinhoe's pheasant <i>Hierophasis swinhoii</i>, Swinhoe's snipe <i>Gallinago megala</i>, and Swinhoe's storm petrel <i>Oceanodroma monorhis</i>&#151;the last two of which Swinhoe himself scientifically described.<br>
