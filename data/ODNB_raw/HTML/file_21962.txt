<span class="headword">Percy,  William</span>  (1574&#150;1648), <span class="occ">poet and playwright</span>, probably born in Tynemouth, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21938/', "Henry Percy, eighth earl of Northumberland (c.1532&#150;1585)")</script>, and Katharine Neville (1545/6&#150;1596). In mid-1583, with two of his brothers, he was sent to Paris where Robert Persons hoped that the children would be &#145;made firm in the Catholic religion&#146;  (<span class="italic">Miscellanea</span>, 99), but the earl insisted they return to England. On 13 June 1589 Percy matriculated from Gloucester Hall, Oxford, where he studied under Dr John Case, &#145;the great tutor for Roman Catholic scholars&#146;  (Wood, MS top. Oxon. C.10.232, interleaf <i>v</i>). Percy studied Italian and Latin but his primary interest was contemporary literature, including the works of Peele, Dekker, Gabriel Harvey, Sidney, and Spenser.<br>
<br>At Oxford, Percy belonged to a Catholic literary coterie which included Barnaby Barnes, whose <span class="italic">Parthenophil and Parthenope: Sonnettes, Madrigals, Eligies, and Odes</span> (1593) was dedicated &#145;To the right noble and virtuous gentleman&#146; William Percy &#145;his dearest friend&#146;. Percy published his own collection <span class="italic">Sonnets to the Fairest Coelia</span> in 1594. In the preface he promises: &#145;ere long I will impart unto the world another Poem which shall be both more fruitfull and ponderous&#146;. He includes a sonnet dedicated to Barnes (Parthenophil). Although Percy's sonnets show no real talent, he was favourably reviewed by William Clerke, in <span class="italic">Polimenteia</span> (1595), who describes the sweet singers of Oxford as &#145;Britten, Percie, Willobie, Fraunce, Lodge, Master Davies of L. I., Drayton, Learned M. Prat&#146;  (sig. Q3<i>v</i>). Percy's circle included Charles Fitzgeoffrey, author of <span class="italic">Sir Francis Drake</span> (1596), who, in his <span class="italic">Caroli Fitzgeoaffridi Affaniae</span> (1601), praises Percy as a poet. The coterie also included the Mychelbourne brothers, Edward, Lawrence, and Thomas, all of whom feature in Percy's poems. A later member was Thomas Campion, a Cambridge man, who praises Percy in his <span class="italic">Epigrammatum II</span> (1619) for his wit. One of Percy's six extant plays, <span class="italic">The Cuck-Queanes and Cuckolds Errants, or, The Bearing Down the Inn</span> concerns the adventures of two Oxford undergraduates, has a prologue spoken by Tarlton, and is set in the year of the Armada (1588); it concludes with a panegyric to Sir Francis Drake.<br>
<br>Percy had moved from Oxford to London by 1595 for on 25 January in that year he, along with the earl of Northumberland, acknowledged a debt to Arthur Medleycote, merchant taylor, for &pound;2400. The debtors were required to repay &pound;1226 by 29 February 1596; by 9 July 1600 Medleycote declared himself satisfied. There is no indication as to how Percy incurred such huge debts. In February 1596 he fought a duel with one Henry Denny, who was wounded 2 inches deep under the chin. Denny seemed to make a full recovery but sickened and died on 19 March. The inquest, however, declared Denny died &#145;by reason of &hellip; sickness and by the visitation of God&#146;  (Alnwick Castle, Percy papers, 5, fol. 108<i>v</i>). By August 1599 Percy was again in debt in the sum of &pound;50 to one Valentine Browne of Crofte in Lincolnshire. By 5 July 1604, however, this debt was vacated.<br>
<br>Percy wrote six plays, which he continually revised. He may have produced a version of <span class="italic">The Faery Pastoral, or, Forest of Elves</span> for the visit of James I to Syon House on 8 June 1603, but he seems to have most especially aspired to have his plays performed by either or both of the Children of Paul's and the Children of the Revels. All three extant autographs of his plays have modifications to devise suitable variants for performance by children. <span class="italic">Arabia sitiens, or, A Dreame of a Drye Yeare: a Tragaecomodye</span> (1601), <span class="italic">A Country Tragaedye in Vacunium</span> (1602), and <span class="italic">The Aphrodysial, or, Sea Feast: a Marinall</span> (1602) are dedicated &#145;unto the children of the Revells and of Poules&#146;. At the end of one autograph there is a note:<blockquote>to the Master of the Children of Poules. Memorandum, that if any of &hellip; these Pastoralls and Comoedyes &hellip; shall but over reach in length (the children not to begin before foure, after prayers, and the gates of Pawles shutting at sixe) the tyme of supper, that then in tyme and place convenient, you do let passe some of the songs, and make the consort the shorter, for I suppose these plaies to be somewhat too long for that place. (Reynolds, 259)</blockquote>A version of these plays could possibly have been played at Paul's in the early phase of their revival (1599&#150;1603). His last play, <span class="italic">Necromantes, or, The Two Supposed Heds: a Comicall Invention</span> (1632) is designated &#145;For Actors onely&#146;  (Hillebrand, 401).<br>
<br>By late 1603 Percy may have been living near Bamber Rape, Sussex, for, at the end of <span class="italic">The Faery Pastoral</span> he writes &#145;Finis 1603 Wolves Hill my Parnassus which is in Sussex&#146;  (Hillebrand, 401); by 1611 he was in prison in Oxford for on 12 February 1612 the earl of Northumberland's accounts speak of &#145;Owing by Mr. Wm. Percy viz. To Mr. Bagwell the keeper of Oxford Castle for the charges of Mr. Percy's diet there &pound;11. 19<i>s</i>.&#146;  (ibid., 399). In 1638 the Reverend Garrard describes Percy living obscurely in Oxford, where he &#145;drinks nothing but Ale&#146;  (G. Radcliffe, <span class="italic">The Earl of Strafforde's Letters and Dispatches</span>, ed. W. Knowler, 1739, 2.168) and eventually he died &#145;an aged Bachelor, in Penny Farthing St. &hellip; after he had lived a melancholy and retired life many years; and was buried in the Cathedral of Christ Church, near to the grave of Sir Henry Gage, the 28th of May 1648&#146;  (Wood, MS top. Oxon. F.4, fol. 83).<br>
