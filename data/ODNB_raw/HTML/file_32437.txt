<span class="headword">Claxton,  (Brian) Brooke</span>  (1898&#150;1960), <span class="occ">politician in Canada</span>, was born on 23 August 1898 in Montreal, the only child of Alfred George Brooke Claxton (1866&#150;1945) and his wife, Blanche Lovat Simpson. The young Brooke Claxton was born to a privileged family in the rather conservative protestant circles of English Montreal. His childhood was, however, disrupted by the divorce of his parents and subsequent controversy between them. He attended the &eacute;lite Lower Canada College from the age of seven and McGill University where, after interrupting his studies during the First World War, he completed a degree in law and was called to the Quebec bar in 1921. He joined his father's law firm, specializing in insurance law, and married on 19 June 1925 Helen Galt, daughter of John G. Savage, of Westmount, Quebec, with whom he had two sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>Claxton was destined for a much more active and reformist life than might have been expected from his early upbringing. Two things conspired to change his conservative early outlook and to focus him on public service. The first was the First World War. Claxton interrupted his studies at McGill in 1916 to join the Royal Canadian Artillery. He served honourably in France (as a battery sergeant-major he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal) and returned at war's end to recommence his studies at McGill. For him, as for so many of his generation, however, the war was disillusioning. He believed his generation had been sacrificed by the &#145;diplomats (not statesmen) of Europe&#146;  (letter to his uncle, 20 Nov 1920, Claxton MSS, vol. 18). He returned to Canada determined that his generation must quickly assert its place in the shattered world of the 1920s.<br>
<br>This resolution fostered the second trend which was to shape Claxton. As he moved into public associations and clubs he came into contact with like-minded reformers&#151;young, well educated, and ambitious. They argued for a new kind of government, based on intellectual expertise rather than party connections. Only with such a transformation, they believed, could Canada overcome the problems of modern industrial society. It was also a generation whose memories of the war gave it definite nationalist overtones. Indeed, Claxton emerged as a public figure as a nationalist and then progressed to reform.<br>
<br>Through the 1920s Claxton participated in a range of clubs and volunteer activities which moved in the effervescent zones in which politics, volunteerism, and intellectual debate overlapped. By the early 1930s he had become known for his work with the association of Canadian clubs and the Canadian Radio League, a body promoting a publicly owned radio network in Canada. In May 1931 he took the cause of federally regulated broadcasting to the supreme court of Canada. The depression of the 1930s reinforced his political activism and pragmatic reformism. Throughout the decade he acted as a critic of all parties, though common cause with fellow reformers and the times gradually led him to identify with the Liberal Party of William Lyon Mackenzie King. When war came in 1939 he felt he could no longer stand outside the system. In 1940 he ran for office as a Liberal and was handily elected for the Montreal constituency of St Lawrence&#150;St George.<br>
<br>Claxton's strong network of activists, intellectuals, and politicians gave him an unusual degree of influence as a new member of parliament. Two decades of public activity had linked him to the new breed of politicians and civil servants who were now scattered through key positions in the government. They were believers in the importance of effective government and the power of Keynesian thinking at a time when war made both more acceptable than ever before. Claxton was everywhere, pushing labour reform, procedural change for the House of Commons, and a more effective Canadian broadcasting system. His aggressive style may actually have slowed his rise to a cabinet post but the more likely reason lies in the complex regional politics of Canadian cabinet representation. There was just no need for an additional English Montrealer at the cabinet table. In 1943 he was, however, given the new post of parliamentary assistant to the privy council, reporting directly to the prime minister.<br>
<br>By 1944 the Liberal government was turning its attention to the post-war world. Alternative parties were gaining in favour and both public and government feared a repeat of the sharp recession which had marked the end of the First World War. Part of the new attention to reform involved the creation of the new department of national health and welfare, a revolutionary step because both areas were constitutionally the responsibility of the provinces. Claxton and other reformers were convinced of the need for decisive federal action, however, and Claxton was one of the primary architects of the new department. His contributions were recognized when, in September 1944, he was elevated to the cabinet as Canada's first minister of national health and welfare. His time in the portfolio was relatively short-lived but while there he was involved in the implementation of several major reform measures, including the massive family allowance scheme. He also took an active role in the peace conferences at war's end, travelling to the Paris peace conference of 1946 as part of the Canadian delegation.<br>
<br>Claxton's active reformism seemed to make him a natural choice for a social portfolio such as health and welfare. However, that was not where he was to spend most of his time in cabinet. In December 1946 he was appointed minister of national defence. Initially it was not an auspicious appointment. The portfolio that had been so important in war now seemed destined for cuts and relative obscurity. As it turned out, however, the cold war made the portfolio more important than at any other time in peace in Canadian history. After a brief period of reductions, Claxton was faced with the challenge of rebuilding the forces in the face of commitments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Korean War. He supported the former but was sceptical about involvement in the latter. He was especially hostile to the hawkish attitudes of American General Douglas MacArthur.<br>
<br>Claxton remained in defence from 1946 to 1954. He found King's successor, Louis St Laurent, a congenial superior and became a trusted confidant of St Laurent's inner circle. He also took on an increasingly active role as a party organizer. The truth, though, was that while national defence was more important than expected it was still a cul-de-sac for an ambitious politician. Canadians were not very interested in military matters, especially as so much of defence policy rested upon the power of the United States. A mixture of overwork and frustration led to recurring periods of exhaustion and reports of overdrinking. Claxton was a competent minister and cabinet stalwart but he appears not to have been very happy in his role as minister of defence. When, in 1954, he was offered the vice-presidency of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company at double his ministerial salary, he accepted. On 1 July 1954 he resigned his portfolio and returned to Montreal.<br>
<br>Claxton was successful in his role at Metropolitan Life but he had one more role to play in public life. In 1957 the government created the Canada Council to support research and creative activity in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Claxton was instrumental in establishing this important new public body and served as chairman until illness forced him to resign in 1959. He died of cancer at 112 Acacia Street, Ottawa, on 13 June 1960 and was buried in Ottawa three days later.<br>
