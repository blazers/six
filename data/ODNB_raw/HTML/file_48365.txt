<span class="headword">Wates,  Norman Edward</span>  (1905&#150;1969), <span class="occ">builder and contractor</span>, was born on 12 January 1905 in Streatham, London, the eldest of the three sons of Edward Wates, house furnisher and builder, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Holmes. His younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40124/', "Sir Ronald Wallace Wates")</script>. He was educated at Emmanuel School, Wandsworth, leaving in 1922 to spend a year with a firm of chartered accountants before joining the building firm started by his father and three uncles. The firm had expanded rapidly after the First World War, building housing estates in south London, and in 1926 it embarked on an estate of 1000 houses in Streatham Vale, which took five years to complete. On 25 April 1929 Wates married Margot Irene (<i>b</i>. 1906/7), daughter of James Sidwell; they had three sons, the eldest of whom was the builder and environmentalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31808/', "Neil Edward Wates")</script>, and three daughters.<br>
<br>By 1930 Wates had been joined by his two younger brothers. This younger generation soon took charge of the firm and, in 1935, began to look beyond the building of houses to public works, including libraries, fire stations, and drill halls. Wates made several trips to the United States in the 1930s to study American building methods and business and management techniques, and he was one of the first builders to reduce the amount of casual labour, leading to the Wates staff-man scheme for qualified site workers, which provided security of employment.<br>
<br>As war approached Wates took on a number of government contracts, and by 1939 had over 100 contracts with the War Office, the Admiralty, and the London boroughs, including contracts for air raid shelters, lining units for trenches, and the construction of army camps and airfields. Wates advised the Admiralty on specialist concrete structures; during the war the firm made pre-cast concrete barges and the first pre-cast concrete floating dock. It was also involved in the construction of units for the Mulberry harbours used for the Normandy landings in 1944.<br>
<br>With the post-war housing shortage and the shortage of traditional building materials, including bricks, timber, and steel, as well as that of skilled site labour, the government subsidized the building of houses using non-traditional materials. The Wates firm was one of the leading builders of temporary, prefabricated bungalows for local authorities all over England, as part of the temporary housing programme from 1945 to 1948. Wates built on experience acquired during the war and, using the precasting works built for production of war materials, he developed a system of making large load-bearing concrete slabs, one storey high, for bungalows. This was especially useful in areas where there was a shortage of site labour. When the subsidies ended, and the prohibition on building for private ownership was lifted, Wates built permanent pre-cast concrete houses; between 1945 and 1955 the firm built nearly 20,000 of these, 9.6% of the total output in the country.<br>
<br>In the 1950s Wates set up a separate division in the midlands. The company built various styles of house, including over a thousand of the detached Dormy houses. In 1953 they were the first to import the tower crane from France, for use in high construction work. They were also one of the first contractors to move into urban redevelopment in the 1950s, working with the charitable foundation of Alleyn's College to redevelop Dulwich; with the Church Commissioners they embarked on the Parkhill development in Croydon, and the Hyde Park estate in Bayswater, where the firm built 763 flats and 112 houses. In the early 1960s the pre-cast concrete division made and put up many of the buildings at the new universities of Sussex and Essex. The Wates Group remained a private company, one of the largest family businesses in the construction industry, with Norman Wates as chairman.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Wates sat on many committees concerned with housing standards. He was a founder member of the National Housebuilders Registration Committee in 1935. After the war he was one of a team sent to Germany by the government to study methods of pre-fabrication. He served for twelve years on the Central Housing Advisory Committee, set up by the minister of housing and local government in 1957; he was also on the Parker Morris committee, set up to establish minimum specifications for local authority housing, whose report, <span class="italic">Homes for Today and Tomorrow</span>, appeared in 1961.<br>
<br>Always interested in education Wates started an indentured student scheme in the company in 1947. He was a foundation governor of the United Westminster Schools foundation, a member of the council of King's College Hospital medical school, and on the court of governors of the London School of Economics. With his brothers he set up the Wates Foundation to encourage the arts and sciences. His main recreation was ocean racing. He died at King's College Hospital, Denmark Hill, Lambeth, London, on 21 July 1969.<br>
