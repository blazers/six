<span class="headword">Magrath,  Cornelius</span>  (1737&#150;1760), <span class="occ">giant</span>, was born on 10 January 1737, near Silvermines, co. Tipperary. This date is recorded on the only known image of Magrath, an etching made in 1756 by a German engraver named Maag. Nothing is known of Macgrath's parents except that they were both of normal stature and that it is likely he was orphaned by the age of fifteen or sixteen. He is known to have suffered from acromegaly, a disease that causes abnormal growth in the extremities as well as an enlarged jaw. The beginnings of Magrath's career as a touring giant began in July 1752, when, on a visit to the city of Cork, his extraordinary height attracted the attention of many passers-by. A report in the <span class="italic">London Daily Advertiser</span> (4 Aug 1752), headed &#145;Cork, July 24th&#146;, describes the sixteen-year-old's arrival in the city, having travelled there from the coastal town of Youghal, where he had sought relief from the pains caused by his medical condition. Even at this age he was, reportedly, already slightly over 6 feet 9 inches tall.<br>
<br>The attention he attracted in Cork was evidently sufficient to convince Magrath that a living might be made by exhibiting himself publicly so that, by 1753, he had made his way to London, via Bristol. Like many human oddities of the pre-circus period, Magrath appeared at public houses and fairs around London, while local advertising publicity made much of his relative youth (still only sixteen), as well as his superior height and proportion to his older contemporary Cajanus (1703&#150;1749), a Swedish giant. An extensive tour followed, which included Paris and several other European capital cities, but Magrath's physical strength soon weakened and he returned to his native Ireland in 1760, to Dublin, where he died within two months, on 20 May 1760.<br>
<br>Magrath's final height has been variously reported as being between 7 feet 3 inches and 7 feet 10 inches, but his skeleton, which is now held in the anatomy museum at Trinity College, Dublin, is 7 feet 6 inches long. It was alleged in contemporary newspapers that Magrath's body was stolen during his wake by students from Trinity College for the purpose of a public medical dissection. Successive writers have disputed these allegations. Edward J. Wood reported in <span class="italic">Giants and Dwarfs</span> (1868) that Magrath's body reached the museum as a result of the friendship struck up between him and several students from the medical faculty, and D. J. Cunningham, in his detailed and authoritative lecture on Magrath (1903), and T. P. C. Kirkpatrick in his <span class="italic">History of the Medical Teaching in Trinity College, Dublin</span> (1912) were also sceptical about reports of theft.<br>
<br>Doubt has also been cast upon reports that accumulated following Magrath's death and which reached fruition in Thomas Campbell's <span class="italic">A Philosophical Survey of the South of Ireland, in a Series of Letters to John Watkinson, M.D.</span> (1777), concerning the relationship between the young Magrath and the cleric and philosopher Dr George Berkeley (1685&#150;1753), bishop of Cloyne. Campbell alleged that Berkeley came upon Magrath as a fifteen-year-old orphan and saw in him the opportunity to indulge &#145;a strange fancy whether it was not in the power of art to increase the human stature&#146;  (Campbell, 188). Wood regarded Berkeley's careful tending to the boy's diet and welfare, for the period of one month, as an expression of his philanthropy. Whatever its basis, this remains one of the few indications of human interest in Magrath, since those accounts of his life that exist give little indication of his family, character, the nature of his public appearances, or his responses to others. Indeed, the most detailed account that endures is Cunningham's analysis of Magrath's skeleton, still a source of spectacle long after his death.<br>
