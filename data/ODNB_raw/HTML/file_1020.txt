<span class="headword">Badew,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1361), <span class="occ">university principal and founder of University Hall, Cambridge</span>, was born, towards the close of the thirteenth century, into an established knightly family which took its name from Great Baddow, near Chelmsford, Essex, where it had estates dispersed among several neighbouring villages. According to Philip Morant (<i>d</i>. 1770), the Essex historian, Richard was probably the third son of Richard Badew and his wife, Isabel, daughter of Peter Marshall, although the matter is not conclusive. Nothing definite is known of his early education. In view of his subsequent career, however, it is to be presumed that he acquired his university education at Cambridge. By 1316 Badew had attained the title of <i>magister</i>, and he was described as a deputy chancellor of Cambridge University in August and October 1320. Between 1316 and 1321 Richard Badew, together with Saer Ros, parson of Magna Samford, was involved in a lawsuit against Joan Mareschall, a Cambridge prostitute, who, after an earlier acquittal, had accused Badew, Ros, and Robert Branketre of bringing a false charge against her at Cambridge. The case ended in 1321 in favour of the defendants when Joan was declared to have been excommunicated and was thereby ineligible to plead. In 1322 Badew was one of six masters who, supported by twenty-two clerks, accused the mayor of Cambridge, his bailiffs, and some 250 prominent townsmen of perpetrating serious assaults on the masters and scholars and on their hostels.<br>
<br>In February 1325 Badew is recorded as chancellor of Cambridge University, and still held that office in 1326. During the latter year, while he was still chancellor, the university obtained a licence for the incorporation of University Hall, the predecessor of Clare College. University Hall had its origins in two houses acquired by the university in 1298, and it had probably been used as a hostel for graduates before 1326; it had attracted as benefactors Gilbert Rothbury (<i>d</i>. 1321), a royal justice, John Salmon (<i>d</i>. 1325), bishop of Norwich, and Thomas Cobham (<i>d</i>. 1327), bishop of Worcester. Badew probably did not have the means to give much in the way of endowment to University Hall, but he was regarded as its founder and patron. However, a worsening in his financial situation was paralleled by a growing realization that the endowment for University Hall was wholly inadequate. Badew's small properties were dispersed over Essex, Huntingdonshire, and Cambridgeshire, and between 1325 and 1343 he engaged in costly lawsuits with his bailiffs and rectors for default of payments. Moreover, he fought extensive litigation with university colleagues&#151;in 1332 alone he was involved in eight separate lawsuits. Badew's straitened finances prevented him from aiding University Hall in a material sense; furthermore he was in dispute with at least two of its fellows, John Bokenham and William Thorpe.<br>
<br>By 1336 University Hall was in a parlous state, and the master of the hall, William Thaxted, appealed for assistance to Lady Elizabeth de Clare, widow of John de Burgh and youngest daughter of Gilbert, earl of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1295), and Joan of Acre, daughter of Edward I. Elizabeth responded by transferring the advowson of the church of Litlington, Cambridgeshire, to the master and fellows. But Badew was seemingly reluctant to relinquish his rights as founder and patron, and it was only by deeds of 6 April 1338 and 28 March 1346 that his complete extrication from University Hall was effected, leaving the way open to Lady Elizabeth to establish Clare College. In the meantime, as already indicated, the 1330s witnessed a series of disputes between the former chancellor Badew and members of the university. For instance, in 1331 the chancellor, John Langele, brought an action against Badew, demanding that he give an account of the money received by him when keeper of the university chest, and that he return nine charters that he had kept in his possession. The case led to a sentence of outlawry being passed on Badew in 1334. The sentence was revoked the following year, and the quarrelling parties seem to have reached a settlement in court. Badew held the rectorship of Braintree, Essex, from at least 1316 until 1333, and the rectorship of Somersham, Huntingdonshire, from 1335 until his death. He founded a chantry in Bicknacre Priory, Essex, in 1337, and a chantry in the church of Great Baddow, Essex, in 1361, the year of his death.<br>
