<span class="headword">Marsh,  George</span>  (<em>c.</em>1515&#150;1555), <span class="occ">clergyman and protestant martyr</span>, was born at Dean, Lancashire, probably the son of George Marsh of Dean. He became a farmer, and married when he was about twenty-five years old. Upon the death of his wife, and having made arrangements for the care of his children, he went to study at Cambridge, where he matriculated at Christ's College in 1551 and petitioned for a degree. He probably converted to protestantism while at Cambridge, and was ordained a deacon by Nicholas Ridley, bishop of London, in 1552. Early in 1553 Marsh became the curate for both of the livings (Church Langton, Leicestershire, and All Hallows, Bread Street, London) held by Laurence Saunders, a clear indication that Marsh's career was being fostered by zealous protestants in the Edwardian church. Marsh appears to have remained at Cambridge for the next few years and from this base he conducted preaching forays into his native Lancashire; he may very well have done so in the company of Saunders, who is known to have preached in the area in 1552 or early 1553.<br>
<br>Marsh's missionary efforts seem to have made an impression: the earl of Derby later claimed that he had heard of Marsh while in London and had resolved to arrest him either in London or Lancashire, while (as letters printed by Foxe reveal) Marsh had become one of the leaders of the tiny minority of protestants in Lancashire. Among his converts were Geoffrey Hurst, a nail maker from Shakerley, Lancashire, who was married to Marsh's sister Alice. (Only Queen Mary's death prevented Hurst from meeting the same grisly end as his brother-in-law.) At the beginning of 1554 Marsh returned to Lancashire. He later claimed that he had returned in order to visit his family and friends before going into exile in Germany or Denmark. In fact his activities were less innocuous than this would suggest; he was charged with having preached heresy publicly in Dean, Eccles, Bolton, Bury, and other Lancashire parishes in January and February 1554. Marsh did not deny this charge but merely claimed that what he had preached had been orthodox doctrine under Edward VI.<br>
<br>In early March 1554, while staying at his mother's house, Marsh was informed that the servants of a local JP were searching for him. His family advised him to flee, but Marsh was afraid that his flight would discredit his previous preaching and undermine his missionary work. A few days later, after anxious soul-searching and prayer, Marsh surrendered to the authorities and was sent to the earl of Derby. Marsh was interrogated about his religious beliefs but initially declined to answer questions about the sacrament, claiming that his accusers sought his death by asking him such questions. Marsh was held in the earl's custody, and was examined again by Derby on Palm Sunday. On being informed by a cleric who had questioned Marsh that the prisoner could be brought to conform, Derby had Marsh held in less rigorous conditions. But Marsh was conscience-stricken by his lack of &#145;boldness&#146; and resisted further efforts to persuade him to recant. These efforts were intensive&#151;throughout Marsh's ordeal the authorities sought his submission, not his death. Marsh was asked to endorse articles that Edward Crome, the celebrated evangelical preacher, had subscribed to in one of his recantations; Marsh refused to sign them, even when they were reduced to only four articles covering the sacrament and confession.<br>
<br>After Easter, Derby abandoned his attempts to convert Marsh and had his prisoner taken to Lancaster Castle, where he was brought before the quarter sessions. Marsh was held in Lancaster, in secular custody, for nearly a year (probably because the authorities did not want to put him on trial in a spiritual court until statutes against heresy were enacted by parliament). During this time Marsh had many visitors, both priests trying to convert him and sympathizers offering him money and encouragement. Together with Thomas Warberton, a fellow prisoner who would later join the English protestant exiles at Aarau, Marsh read every day from the prayer book and the <span class="roman">Bible</span> to townspeople gathered outside the window of his cell. Bishop George Coates of Chester upbraided the gaoler for the lax conditions of Marsh's imprisonment and ordered that he be more strictly confined. In March 1555 Marsh was transferred to Chester, where he was repeatedly examined by Bishop Coates. During these examinations Marsh remained obdurate in his refusal to renounce his beliefs. At Marsh's condemnation the vicar-general of the diocese twice interrupted Coates, while the bishop was passing sentence on Marsh, in futile efforts to give him a final chance to recant and save his life.<br>
<br>On 24 April 1555 Marsh was taken outside the walls of Chester and, after refusing the offer of a royal pardon if he would recant, he was burnt in the adjacent district of Spital Boughton. According to Foxe's informant the people were impressed by Marsh's stoicism and acclaimed him as a martyr. In response Bishop Coates preached a sermon in Chester Cathedral denouncing Marsh as a heretic who met his deserved end and was eternally damned.<br>
