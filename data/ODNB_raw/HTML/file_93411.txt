<span class="headword">Boffa, Sir  Paul</span>  (1890&#150;1962), <span class="occ">prime minister of Malta</span>, was born in Vittoriosa, Malta, on 30 June 1890, the son of Carmelo Boffa and his wife, Carmela, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Serracino. After attending the lyceum in Valletta and the University of Malta he graduated as a medical doctor in 1913. During the First World War he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps in Malta, in Salonika, and on hospital ships. He quickly became a busy GP in the southern, more working-class, part of Malta and in 1921 married Genoveffa (Genevi&egrave;ve) Cecy, daughter of Daniel Cecy, medical doctor; they had four children (two sons and two daughters).<br>
<br>Boffa started his political career in 1923, when he joined the newly formed Maltese Labour Party, originally known as La Camera del Lavoro. Although not one of the party's founder members of 1920, he may justly be considered one of its pioneers. He successfully contested his first election in 1924, became involved in the party's organization, and in 1928, when he had been again returned to parliament, was chosen party leader.<br>
<br>Boffa's leadership and the party's fortunes were both helped and hindered by the ascendancy of Sir Gerald Strickland, a more powerful and better-established personality. In 1926 Strickland's Constitutional Party formed a pre-electoral &#145;compact&#146; with Boffa's party and it was by means of this that Strickland could form a majority in the legislative assembly and head the government from 1927 to 1930. Although Sir Ugo Mifsud's Nationalists obtained a slightly higher percentage of the vote for the legislative assembly and one seat more than the &#145;Stricklandians&#146;, the latter could add Boffa's three seats to form a two-seat majority. The Nationalists still retained a majority in the senate in a bicameral legislature that proved to be increasingly unworkable. Boffa, however, did not accept a cabinet post. His party's interest was to force through some social legislation, such as the <span class="roman">Workmen's Compensation Act</span>, as well as to push for a greater recognition of the Maltese language, since Italian, still prevalent even in the courts, was regarded as a bourgeois imposition on working men, many of whom neither spoke nor understood it. Although progress was registered in this direction, the political path was beset with constitutional strife, with Strickland trying to have the constitution changed to weaken the upper house. Not only was there constitutional wrangling; Strickland picked a fight with the Roman Catholic church in Malta, purportedly over ecclesiastical jurisdiction involving a friar who was one of his supporters, after vetoing the disciplinary action proposed by the order. As a result of the ensuing politico-religious conflict, the hitherto Anglophile archbishop Mauro Caruana was led to clash bitterly with Strickland's administration and, inevitably, its junior Labour ally.<br>
<br>By the time that another election was due in 1932 Labour's support had dwindled and the party would have been wiped out had Boffa not been returned, the only successful candidate on its list. Boffa accepted nomination by the governor to the executive council under a non-representative constitution in 1936, after self-government had been revoked in 1933. When elections again became possible in 1939 (albeit with the elected representatives on the council in a minority) he was again the only Labour candidate to be returned. Labour obtained 10 per cent of the vote compared to 14 per cent in 1927. In 1942 Boffa went along with the six Stricklandian deputies and voted in favour of the unconstitutional deportation ordinance permitting the exile of scores of Maltese from Malta on a suspicion of possible disloyalty in wartime.<br>
<br>As in the First World War so too during the Second World War Boffa put his medical know-how unreservedly at the service of all those who needed it. He served as a district commissioner on the Cottonera district, and with ARP in the worst hit, most dangerous towns around the grand harbour, which were subjected to fierce axis bombardment, especially by the Luftwaffe in the devastating battle for Malta. For these services in 1941 he was appointed OBE. True to his party's calling, in the council of government Boffa supported the right to universal suffrage, with education and property qualifications abolished. He eventually resigned his seat, only to contest it again in November 1945 when all men over twenty-one became entitled to vote, increasing the electorate by 30 per cent. For various reasons the other main parties boycotted this election, such as it was, so Boffa actually (and ridiculously) led the poll with 76 per cent of the votes cast, Labour obtaining nine of the ten seats on 90 per cent of the vote. However, he was narrowly beaten by the ophthalmologist Sir Luigi Preziosi in a contest to chair the national assembly formed in 1945 to formulate a constitution for self-government, as had happened in 1919.<br>
<br>In 1947 Boffa led Labour to an altogether unprecedented electoral victory in the first general election held under the constitution of that year. With reconstruction of every shape and form a crying need, and several Nationalists, such as Enrico Mizzi, just returning from exile, Boffa's party presented a timely manifesto centred around social legislation&#151;income tax, old-age pensions, housing, and emigration&#151;and won twenty-four out of the forty seats, with 60 per cent of the vote, a feat unparalleled in Maltese electoral history. Boffa himself was returned on the first count from two districts. Malta's first prime minister to be a medical doctor&#151;all his predecessors since 1923 had been lawyers&#151;Boffa appointed a talented cabinet possessing the highest credentials. One of his new young ministers was Dominic (Dom) Mintoff, an architect who had been to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. In the space of two years Mintoff, an ambitious, energetic, and charismatic personality, would topple and replace Boffa as party leader, effectively bring down his administration, and have him expelled from the Labour Party, purportedly for having been too soft in his manner of dealing with London in the face of dockyard lay-offs and pressing post-war socio-economic needs requiring greater financial assistance than was being made available to Malta by Britain.<br>
<br>Boffa resigned the party leadership in 1949 but remained prime minister until the general election of 1950. He then went briefly into opposition but entered two coalition administrations with the Nationalist Party, led first by Mizzi (who died in harness as prime minister in 1950) and subsequently by his successor, Borg Olivier. Initially the Labour Party was split in half, with Boffa's &#145;Workers' Party&#146; and Mintoff's &#145;Labour Party&#146; each electing eleven MPs, and with most Labour ministers having sided with Boffa; but gradually Mintoff eroded Boffa's standing until, in 1955, Mintoff's party won an absolute majority at the polls.<br>
<br>Boffa retired from politics after the election of 1955 and was knighted in 1956. His retirement was marred by ill health, and he died at Paola, Malta, on 6 July 1962. He was survived by his wife and four children. After his death he remained an icon for many stalwart Labourites and party pioneers, many of whom moved to support the Nationalists against Mintoff, with Lady Boffa herself once taking the stand during a Nationalist mass meeting after Mintoff's return to power in the 1970s. Probably more than that of any other former premier, Boffa's memory continued to be recalled periodically in letters to the local press by veterans. As late as 25 May 2008 an elderly &#145;Boffist&#146; remembered his mentor &#145;with profound respect&#146;: &#145;He wore his erudition lightly and was indeed an upright politician and a gentleman endowed with Christian principles &hellip; He was a national figure of high values and impeccable character. He also suffered because of his ideals&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, Malta, 25 May 2008). Many years after his death a life-size bronze monument to Boffa was erected in Valletta by the governing Malta Labour Party, while a public garden was named after him in Paola, his district, by a later Nationalist administration.<br>
