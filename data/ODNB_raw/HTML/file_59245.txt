<span class="headword">Wilkinson,  Joshua Lucock</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1769, <em>d.</em> in or after 1802), <span class="occ">travel writer</span>, was baptized on 9 August 1769 in the parish of St Nicholas, Liverpool, the son of George Wilkinson (<i>d</i>. 1783), captain in the Royal Navy, and his wife, Rebecca (<i>d</i>. 1801), whom he had married on 24 September 1767. His maternal grandfather, Joshua Lucock, had resided in Cockermouth and at Lorton Hall (just outside that town) in Cumberland, and had in 1745 built the Cockermouth house in which William Wordsworth was born and lived until 1783. Part of Wilkinson's youth was spent at Cockermouth&#151;he recalls that in his &#145;school-boy&#146; days he had &#145;frequently seen the mountains and lakes&#146; of &#145;Cumberland&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Wanderer</span>, 2.131)&#151;and he may have attended Hawkshead grammar school with Wordsworth. Captain Wilkinson seems to have been often at sea, and was drowned in 1783 when the <i>Ville de Paris</i>, sailing with &#145;the homeward-bound fleet from Jamaica&#146;, was crippled by a heavy gale off Newfoundland and later sank in the North Sea (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 52, 499; <span class="italic">GM</span>, 53, 267). Thereafter his widow seems to have made Cockermouth her permanent residence, and Wilkinson probably lived with her until in 1790 or 1791 he moved to London, where he was eventually enrolled (on 2 May 1793) at Gray's Inn.<br>
<br>Wilkinson may already have been acquainted with Wordsworth's brother Richard; in any case, the two became friendly when they both entered Gray's Inn in the early 1790s, and shared rooms as well as chambers. They probably did so until the summer of 1793 (shortly after Wilkinson's enrolment at Gray's Inn), when Richard Wordsworth moved to set up his own office at Staple Inn. In September 1792, William Wordsworth, returning from France, wrote to his brother that:<blockquote>I look forward to the time of seeing you Wilkinson and my other friends with pleasure. I am very happy you have got into Chambers, as I shall perhaps be obliged to stay a few weeks in town about my publication you will I hope with Wilkinson's permission find me a place for a bed. Give Wilkinson my best Complts I have apologies to make for not having written to him, as also to almost all my other friends. (<span class="italic">Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth</span>, 81)</blockquote>In 1791 Wilkinson had returned from a continental tour similar to that undertaken by Wordsworth. In 1795 he published a two-volume account of this and of a 1793 tour (which took in the Low Countries, France, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy), as <span class="italic">The Wanderer, or, A Collection of Anecdotes and Incidents</span>. Meanwhile, in 1793 he had published a short, polemical work entitled <span class="italic">Political facts, collected in a tour, in the months of August, September, and October, 1793, along the frontiers of France</span>. This outspoken volume&#151;part travelogue, part reportage&#151;is critical of the conduct of the German allies of the British in the war against republican France, and concludes with an appeal for British neutrality. In 1794 Wilkinson translated a pamphlet by the comte de Montgaillard, a French &eacute;migr&eacute;, entitled <span class="italic">The State of France, in May 1794</span>, which displays an ambivalent attitude to the revolutionary war.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Wanderer</span> is a long, reflective work, describing Wilkinson's travels on foot around Europe during the separate excursions of 1791 and 1793. As with <span class="italic">Political Facts</span>, the pedestrian mode of travel facilitates intimate contact with a wide range of people, and Wilkinson presents a fascinating tapestry of European characters and attitudes. He narrowly escapes being pressed into the imperial army on several occasions, and at one point is mistaken for Louis XVI, who has just escaped to Varennes. He consistently displays contempt not only for Catholic superstition, but for religious belief in general, and contemporary reviews of <span class="italic">The Wanderer</span> criticized this &#145;grossly indecent&#146; tendency  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 115). In the second volume, he alludes to an incident which is later developed by Wordsworth into the story of Vaudracour and Julia in <span class="italic">The Prelude</span> (book 9), and he may well have discussed this story with the poet. In any case, it is almost certain that Wordsworth during late 1792 read the first part of the manuscript of <span class="italic">The Wanderer</span>. Wilkinson's travelogue provides an interesting prose counterpart to the European books of <span class="italic">The Prelude</span>, and may have suggested to Wordsworth several of the motifs of solitary travel, reflection, and revisiting which characterize his poem.<br>
<br>In October 1794 Wilkinson witnessed Richard Wordsworth's signature on an important bond drawn up to protect from the claims of creditors the &pound;600 bequeathed to the poet by Raisley Calvert. He may have married: there is a record of a marriage between a Joshua Wilkinson and Alice Ashworth on 14 December 1796 in Rossendale, Lancashire. Thereafter the letters and papers of the Wordsworth household provide only brief glimpses of Wilkinson. Early in 1802 Dorothy reports that she and William met him at Keswick during Christmas 1801, and that William and Wilkinson supped at the Royal Oak inn together. Wilkinson's presence in the Lakes at this time was necessitated by the recent death of his mother, who had died at Lorton Hall on 1 December 1801 (her death is noted in <span class="italic">GM</span>, 71, 1154). He was back in London by 19 January 1802, when he proved her will. Nothing is known of his subsequent life and career.<br>
