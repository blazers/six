<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Peto, Sir  (Samuel) Morton</span>, first baronet  (1809&#150;1889), <span class="occ">contractor for railways and public works</span>, was born on 4 August 1809 at Whitmoor House, Woking, Surrey, the eldest son of William Peto (<i>d</i>. 1849) of Cookham, Berkshire, farmer, and his wife, Sophia, daughter of Ralph Alloway of Dorking. Educated first at a Cobham village school, he then spent two years at Jardine's boarding-school at Brixton Hill, Surrey.<h2>
<a name="Apprenticeship"></a>Apprenticeship</h2>When he was fourteen he was apprenticed to his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51927/', "Henry Peto")</script>, public works contractor, with whom he lived at 31 Little Britain, City of London. He also attended a technical school. His talent for drawing was developed by a draughtsman, George Maddox of Furnival's Inn, and an architect, either Charles or Samuel Beazley. Under his uncle, he learnt the practical side of building in the carpenter's shop and as a bricklayer and mason, before acting as a superintendent, work that gave him &#145;an insight into the mechanism of labour &hellip; [and] the idiosyncrasy of the English mechanic&#146;  (<span class="italic">Men of the time</span>).<br>
<br>On his uncle's death in 1830, Peto and his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49437/', "Thomas Grissell")</script> each inherited a half share in his business and heavily mortgaged estate. As partners they conducted one of the leading firms of public works contractors, in a period when competitive tendering for lump-sum contracts was becoming the norm for major building works. Their control of a wide range of building trades, even leasing their own stone quarries, enabled them to win contracts on terms that their close site controls made profitable to them. Their 1832 tender for Hungerford Market, London (designed by Charles Fowler) was, at &pound;42,400, only &pound;400 below their nearest competitor. It was the first in a notable series that included Charles Barry's Birmingham grammar school (1833), the Reform (also Barry, 1836), Conservative (1840), and Oxford and Cambridge (1836&#150;8) clubs, Samuel Beazley's Lyceum (1831&#150;4, in sixteen weeks) and St James's (1835, in thirteen weeks) theatres, and his Studley Castle, Warwickshire (1834), Bushall's Olympic Theatre (1849), and Nelson's Column (1843). They also constructed Fowler's St John's Church, Hyde Park Crescent (1830&#150;31).<br>
<br>Peto recalled that:<blockquote>our <i>ordinary</i> business coming regularly from the large breweries and fire offices, and the work of our own connection with the architects, netted on the average &pound;11,000 or &pound;12,000 a year, and with only &pound;50,000 capital engaged in that department. (Peto, 13)</blockquote>Well placed to benefit from new contracting opportunities, they engaged in railway construction, beginning with two stations in Birmingham, followed by the Hanwell to Langley section of the Great Western (1840)&#151;where Peto successfully referred his disputed &pound;162,000 account directly to the determination of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the engineer&#151;as well as the Woolwich graving dock. But their most celebrated work was the superstructure of Barry's houses of parliament, begun in 1840 on a lump-sum contract for the river front, and continued in a series of contracts based on their schedule of prices. Young men in their employ included George Gilbert Scott and the Lucas brothers, Charles Thomas and Thomas.<h2>
<a name="Railwaybuilding"></a>Railway building</h2>Peto was more enthusiastic than Grissell about developing the risky but profitable railway-building side of the business, which had the added advantage that he would then be able to stand for parliament, from which as a government contractor he was barred. He dissolved the partnership on 2 March 1846, taking over the railway works (including some in Norfolk), a substantial &#145;clear capital&#146; and &pound;25,000 worth of plant. He was returned as MP for Norwich in July 1847. Among his contracts were those for portions of the South Eastern Railway adjoining others being executed by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49433/', "Edward Ladd Betts")</script>, who in 1843 had married Peto's sister. Having run into difficulties with the Saltwood Tunnel, where Betts had the contract for the permanent way, in 1846 they agreed to join forces, and subsequently formed a partnership that lasted until Betts's death in 1872. Peto worked on securing contracts, raising finance, and carrying out a modern company chairman's role, while Betts performed that of chief executive, actually conducting the works.<br>
<br>Peto and Betts's highly organized operations covered many parts of England, but especially the east, with contracts for the Great Northern loop line through Boston to Doncaster, the East Lincolnshire, and the Eastern Counties Railway for which alone their several contracts totalled over &pound;1.12 million. Writing from Boston in 1847, Peto referred to the thirteen engines and 8000 men they had on the works. As a feeder for East Anglia, they developed the London, Tilbury, and Southend Railway (1854&#150;6), which they also leased as operators, a costly speculation. They were also responsible for the London, Cambridge, and Ely line; the Oxford and Birmingham Railway (contracts including the Harbury cuttings, the largest in the country, requiring the removal of 1.5 million cu. yd of soil); and the Oxford, Worcester, and Wolverhampton. Other contracts included the Dorset sections of the London and South Western (at a cost of &pound;420,000, partly paid in shares), and the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester, as well as for the Severn Valley and the Chester and Holyhead railway companies of which Peto was chairman. In the 1840s Peto had thirty-three railway contracts worth &pound;20 million, the largest number held in the kingdom; according to Brunel he was the largest contractor in the world.<br>
<br>Beyond the scale of his operations, Peto's insistence on paying his men weekly in cash was unusual. He recommended this practice to the select committee on railway labourers in 1846, and it was endorsed in their report. In 1854 Peto, supporting an amendment of the <span class="roman">Truck Act</span>, claimed always to have paid in cash the wages of the 30,000 men his firm had employed throughout the world. Peto was also interested in the physical and moral well-being of his employees, building barrack huts for them where necessary, each under the charge of a married couple, and paying for chaplains, <span class="roman">Bibles</span>, and uplifting tracts. His system of management combined &#145;discipline, personal freedom, moral admonition reduced to practice, and a total avoidance of ostentatious pietism&#146;  (<span class="italic">Men of the time</span>).<br>
<br>Several of Peto's undertakings were &#145;contractors' lines&#146;, projected &#145;not because the district wanted a railway, but because the contractor wanted a job&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 April 1868, 9). Such companies paid their contractors by issuing them with stock at a discount, to sell at a profit when possible. Peto's name was a byword for this practice. In 1857, after parliament sanctioned the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, an author going under the pseudonym &#145;Tooth of the Dragon&#146; published a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Petovia</span>, attacking &#145;Petoism&#146;: &#145;There was concoction of companies by contractors in order to make their own terms for construction of the works, or, bribery of directors in order to sacrifice the shareholders&#146;  (Popplewell, 9). As early as 1847, having been paid extensively in securities, Peto was experiencing serious cash flow difficulties, eventually resolved by the connection he developed with the Quaker Gurney banks in Norfolk and thence with the discounting house of Overend Gurney. In the late 1840s and early 1850s Peto's plans were largely focused on developing Lowestoft as a port for Norwich and its hinterland, and its establishment as a holiday resort.<br>
<br>When the major domestic routes had been completed, Peto and Betts looked abroad: in co-operation with Thomas Brassey, their only equal, they extended their operations into Norway (1851) and Denmark (in 1853, 1860, and 1863, totalling 350 miles). They even undertook projects in Canada from 1852, embarking on the Grand Trunk Railway (539 miles in length); this required the bridging of the St Lawrence River at Montreal, which proved so expensive that they had to be rescued by the Canadian government. Peto found one-third of the &pound;270,000 capital for their Birkenhead Canada works to provide the metal parts and rolling stock needed. Other enterprises in which they joined Brassey included the Lyons and Avignon Railway (1852) and extensive lines in Australia (from 1859), and at home, the Victoria docks, London, in 1852 at a cost of &pound;870,000. In the Crimean War, Peto offered to construct a railway at Balaklava at cost, but this necessitated his resignation of his parliamentary seat in December 1854; he was compensated with a baronetcy the following February. Peto and Betts were also responsible for the Algiers to Blidah line, the first railway in Algeria, and the Algiers quays; the D&uuml;naberg and Vitebsk Railway in Russia (220 miles long); the Buenos Aires to Rosario; and a land drainage scheme in the Netherlands. At Sir John Rennie's suggestion, the firm made an agreement in 1857 for building the Coimbra to Porto line, abandoned after disputes with the Portuguese government; Rennie thought that the real cause &#145;was that their resources were swallowed up by a great variety of speculations&#146;  (Rennie, 366).<h2>
<a name="Bankruptcy"></a>Bankruptcy</h2>It was, however, essentially their involvement at home with the controversial and insecure London, Chatham, and Dover Railway (LCDR) that brought about their collapse. Peto and Betts, in partnership with the engineer T. R. Crampton from 1862, concluded a lump-sum contract at &pound;5.979 million (including more than &pound;1 million for land) for its metropolitan extension into Victoria Station. They were to be paid not in cash, but in shares and debentures of the heavily indebted company, to which in December 1863 Peto offered his services as financial adviser. He undertook to fund a floating debt of &pound;1.25 million which enabled the company to issue more stock, taken by Peto at a heavy discount. By improperly certifying that the majority of this stock had been subscribed for, the company was then able to raise cash on debentures, a not unusual, but illegal, proceeding. It was exposed by Peto's borrowings, and on 11 May 1866 the partners went down, following their bankers, Overend, Gurney &amp; Co., with liabilities estimated at &pound;4 million. Though denouncing the essential unsoundness of &#145;contractors' lines&#146;, <span class="italic">The Times</span> lamented:<blockquote>It is not without a sense of national humiliation that we contemplate the failure of a house which is identified with some of the grandest mechanical achievements of the present century. Perhaps no one, save Mr Brassey, has filled so high a position among English contractors as Sir Morton Peto &hellip; a leading pioneer of the railway system, and a great master in the art of organizing labour. (26 July 1867, 9)</blockquote>Gladstone and Disraeli alike paid him similar tributes in the Commons.<br>
<br>In the subsequent bankruptcy proceedings, the transactions between Peto and the LCDR were left undetermined: although the firm's books &#145;had been admirably kept&#146; according to the LCDR's solicitor  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 7 July 1868, 11), another viewpoint was that the accounts &#145;were both contradictory and most difficult to unravel&#146;  (Peto, 47). The firm claimed a balance due to them of &pound;380,000, and the LCDR counter-claimed for &pound;6,661,941. The affairs of the partners, too, were almost inextricable: &pound;800,000 belonging to Peto, Betts, and Crampton had been applied to discharge Peto and Betts's liabilities, leaving a deficiency of over &pound;1 million. The LCDR received a dividend of 1<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. from the bankrupts' estate on their discharge. Peto had meanwhile resumed his parliamentary activities, being returned first for Finsbury in 1859 and then becoming member for Bristol in 1865, but as a bankrupt was once again obliged to step down, which he did in April 1868. Nevertheless he evidently had hopes of re-election, and his election committee in June 1868 rejected his offer to resign as a candidate; his subsequent &#145;involved and prolix exposition&#146; to his former constituents of his affairs &#145;obscured rather than elucidated&#146; in the view of <span class="italic">The Times</span> (7 July 1868), which thought that the ordinary reader would conclude that in Peto's opinion there were people involved who were more to blame than himself (a view shared by <span class="italic">The Builder</span>); but he could not &#145;be held as irresponsible as he claims&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 Oct 1868, 6). Peto did not, however, again contest Bristol.<h2>
<a name="Familylifeandreligiousactivities"></a>Family life and religious activities</h2>On 18 May 1831 Peto married Thomas Grissell's oldest sister, Mary (<i>c</i>.1811&#150;1842); the couple, who had two sons and three daughters, lived in Albany Terrace, York Road, Lambeth. After her death he married, on 12 July 1843, Sarah Ainsworth (1821&#150;1892), eldest daughter of Henry Kelsall of Rochdale, a textile manufacturer and leading Baptist layman; they had another six sons, of whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/96721/', "Harold Ainsworth Peto")</script> became a partner in the leading architectural practice of Sir Ernest George and Peto, and four daughters.<br>
<br>Peto, who had been brought up an evangelical Anglican, joined the Baptists about 1844, influenced by his second wife; from the mid-1840s until his bankruptcy he was the leading Baptist layman, serving in 1853&#150;5 and again in 1863&#150;7 as chairman of the dissenting deputies. He was treasurer of the Baptist Missionary Society from 1846 to 1867. Peto's omnibus, conveying family and servants (the sexes segregated) to worship in Bloomsbury, was a familiar Sunday sight between 1849 and 1873. He was in favour of complete religious freedom for every denomination, and this was one of the few topics on which he spoke in the Commons.<br>
<br>As an MP, Peto acted independently on the radical wing of the Liberal Party, expressing his confidence in the fourth earl of Aberdeen's coalition ministry in June 1854, during the Crimean War. Membership of the Commons for him offered a means of promoting his interests; he did not seek a career in politics. Peto was naturally active in discussion of religious questions: in 1850 he secured a non-contentious <span class="roman">Trustee Act</span> to safeguard nonconformist chapel trusts, but in 1861 his <span class="roman">Burials Bill</span> (to allow nonconformist services in parochial graveyards) was rejected. He encouraged a non-aggressive attitude towards the Church of England but attacked compulsory church rates, arguing that they were unnecessary. Apart from religious and public works topics, his speeches principally concerned the condition of the working classes, on which he regarded himself as peculiarly well informed: he &#145;believed he had been more extensively engaged with the industrious classes of this country than any Member&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hansard 3</span>, 121, 1862, 698). He was indeed seen as a philanthropic employer, endeavouring to make all in his employ &#145;feel that the interests of employer and employed are identical, &hellip; that the master cares for the comfort and welfare of his men, and is really &hellip; anxious that they should be helped in every way to rise in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cassell's Illustrated Family Paper</span>, 39&#150;40). Peto set out his political views in seconding the Address in the Commons on 4 February 1851, when he praised the reduction of import duties and the repeal of the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span>; pointed to the thriving state of stock farming as a result of the consequent improved working-class living standards; urged the building of more railways to benefit Ireland, and to open up India as a market for cotton manufactures; approved anti-papal legislation; and recommended the universal registration of property deeds. He served on a number of select committees (including that on masters and operatives, 1860) and official commissions, particularly the metropolitan commission of sewers (1849), of which he was deputy chairman in 1851&#150;2, and the royal commission for the 1851 exhibition.<br>
<br>Peto published, in addition to religious tracts, <span class="italic">Observations on the Report of the Defence Commissioners, with an Analysis of the Evidence</span> (1862); <span class="italic">Taxation, its Levy and Expenditure, Past and Future</span> (1863)&#151;a 400 page criticism of British financial policy; and <span class="italic">Resources and prospects of America ascertained during a visit to the States in the Autumn of 1865</span> (1866), a lengthy, generally admiring, analysis, but advocating the merits of free trade.<br>
<br>Although Peto spent liberally, his income was not as large as might be expected. In 1861 he said &pound;10,000 was his best for seven years past, and in 1862 he realized assets in real estate worth several thousands annually. He was a generous benefactor to charity, funding the building of Bloomsbury Baptist Chapel (at a cost of &pound;18,000) and, when repaid, buying the Regent's Park diorama for conversion to a chapel; he also restored the parish church on the estate he had bought at Somerleyton, Lowestoft, Suffolk, where he built a model village, with a school for the children of the men in his Lowestoft works. In 1850 he came forward as guarantor of the &pound;50,000 required for the Great Exhibition of 1851.<br>
<br>In London, Peto and his family lived at 47 Russell Square, and then in 1853&#150;63 in great style at 12 Kensington Palace Gardens (built by Thomas Grissell), supported by a governess, three male and twelve female indoor servants. In 1863&#150;5, while he was temporarily living at 9 Great George Street, Lucas Brothers built him a new mansion on the adjoining garden plot, at a cost of nearly &pound;50,000, complete with remarkable stables that accommodated nine coaches and twelve stalls. In consequence of Peto's bankruptcy, this house was bought by Thomas Lucas. At Lowestoft, Peto employed John Thomas to rebuild Somerleyton Hall for him (1844), described by Pevsner as &#145;more Jacobean than any original Jacobean house&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buildings of England, Suffolk</span>, 1961, 390). He became a JP and deputy lieutenant for Suffolk (and JP for Norfolk, and later Middlesex), but in 1862 moved to Chipstead, Sevenoaks, Kent. After his bankruptcy, Peto moved almost annually, until settling at Eastcote House, Pinner, Middlesex, in 1877. He moved for the last time in 1884, to Blackhurst, Tunbridge Wells, Kent.<br>
<br>After their discharge from bankruptcy in July 1868, the only contract undertaken by Peto and Betts was for minor works on the Metropolitan Railway. However, they had hopes of an abortive scheme for regulating the Danube at Budapest, where Peto spent much of 1868&#150;9, moving on to Paris in hope of French contracts. After Betts's death he undertook construction of the Cornish mineral railways. His health deteriorated in the mid-1880s and he spent two winters at Cannes, but from November 1888 became increasingly ill. He died at Blackhurst on 13 November 1889, and was buried in Pembury churchyard, Kent. He was survived by his wife.<br>
