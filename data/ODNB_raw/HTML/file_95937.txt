<span class="headword">Ridley <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Mosley]</span>, Dame  (Mildred) Betty</span>  (1909&#150;2005), <span class="occ">church administrator</span>, was born on 10 September 1909 at the rectory, Newby Place, Poplar, London, the daughter of Henry Mosley (1868&#150;1948), rector of Poplar, later bishop of Stepney and then bishop of Southwell, and his wife, Mildred, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Willis (<i>d</i>. 1963). She was educated at the North London Collegiate School and Cheltenham Ladies' College. She won a place at the Royal College of Music (her love of music never left her and she sang with the Bach Choir for many years) but, aged nineteen, she fell in love with her father's chaplain, Michael Ridley (1899/1900&#150;1953), and married him on 3 September 1929. After a brief spell in Hampshire (to which she returned in retirement) they moved to London where he became incumbent of St Gabriel's, Pimlico, and then rector of Finchley. She was an active vice-chairman of St Hilda's Settlement in Bethnal Green. Before her husband's untimely death in 1953 they had four children: Clare (<i>b</i>. 1930), Simon (<i>b</i>. 1933), Adam (<i>b</i>. 1937), and Giles (<i>b</i>. 1946).<br>
<br>Widowed at forty-four and with her three elder children moving into adult life, Betty Ridley directed her full energies toward the central councils of the Church of England, in which she had been moving with increasing confidence. She had been elected to the church assembly in 1945 and became vice-president of the British Council of Churches in 1954&#150;6. She served on the central board of finance of the church assembly (from 1970 the general synod) for twenty-two years (1955&#150;79). It was a mark of her rapidly won reputation that she was invited to assume the chairmanship of an important committee set up to rationalize the convoluted, politicized, and overlapping internal committee structure of the assembly. The committee had originally been chaired by Sir Peter Agnew MP, but he had found it impossible to combine the workload with his parliamentary duties. The Ridley report, which she introduced in a two-hour speech, carried the house and established a revised structure which lasted for many years both in assembly and general synod. She was made an honorary MA (Lambeth) in 1958.<br>
<br>Ridley served as a church commissioner from 1959 to 1981. She became the first chairman of the newly established redundant churches committee in 1968 and then, in 1972, was appointed by Archbishop Ramsey to be third church estates commissioner, the first woman to hold that post. In parallel she became, when the assembly metamorphosed into the general synod, a member of its highly influential (and highly political) standing and business committees, serving from 1971 to 1981. This decade, in which she held leading positions in both church commission and synod, saw her at the height of her reputation and powers. She was appointed DBE in 1975 and, upon retirement in 1982, was asked to chair the appointments committee that made recommendations leading to the appointment of John Habgood as archbishop of York.<br>
<br>Ridley's continuous and growing influence in the central structures of the Church of England sprang from a number of sources. Her personal qualities were many and formidable: maternal instincts, expressed through a warm and responsive manner, which attracted wide confidence; complete self-assurance and social ease; a good brain; common sense; keen perception and sound political judgement; and, although sometimes hidden, determination of purpose. Her energies were unflagging. Also of crucial importance was her familiarity with (by birth, education, and marriage), and her acceptance of, the prevailing customs, manners, and inherent assumptions of her (still largely male) colleagues in the assembly, synod, and commission at that time. By friends and opponents alike her gender was perceived as a source of strength (indeed comfort), never as a threat. It was no surprise that when the Reform Club elected women she should become the first woman to sit on its general committee.<br>
<br>These attributes informed Ridley's handling of her lifelong belief in and support for the ordination of women to the priesthood. Aged twenty she had expressed this view to the Council for Women's Church Work, of which her father was chairman. She was promptly invited to join them. When in 1950 the Lambeth conference of bishops reiterated the view that it was impossible for a woman to be ordained priest, she became a founder member of the influential Anglican Group for the Ordination of Women. The cause prospered and in 1992 when the general synod voted that there were no &#145;fundamental objections&#146; to the principle of women's ordination, she heard the news, in retirement, &#145;with tears of joy&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Aug 2005). Earlier, in 1975, her political judgement (characterized by some as too warm an attachment to the establishment) led her to urge some delay in the process; nevertheless, in 1979 she readily joined with other (more vociferous) colleagues in the foundation of the Movement for the Ordination of Women.<br>
<br>Her work as a leading church commissioner brought her, especially through her chairmanship of the houses and redundant churches committees, into close contact with the practicalities of dealing with much loved churches, often of historic and architectural value. They no longer had the congregations or patrons able to maintain them, to the distress of faithful parishioners faced with their &#145;redundancy&#146;. Her understanding and personal experience of the economic realities of clerical family life made her uniquely effective in dealing with the commissioners' financial assistance for rectories and vicarages, and for their administration of the diocesan bishops' houses for which they were directly responsible. It was such qualities that marked her work as a leading figure in the life of the Church of England for over thirty years.<br>
<br>After her retirement in 1982 Ridley moved to St Swithun Street, Winchester. She was made an honorary DSC of Southampton University and served as a governor of King Alfred's College, Winchester (later Winchester University), and as chairman of the Hampshire Churches Preservation Trust. Her final years were spent at Brendon Nursing Home, Park Road, Winchester. She died at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital, Winchester, on 1 August 2005. She was survived by her four children.<br>
