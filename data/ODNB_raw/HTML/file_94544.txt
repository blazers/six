<span class="headword">Fyncheden, Sir  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1374), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was a native of the West Riding of Yorkshire, taking his name from Finsdale in Morley parish (the place name was still recorded as Fincheden in the early seventeenth century). He was presumably the William son of Henry Fincheden who on 20 July 1340 conveyed a 10<i>s</i>. rent in Woolley, Royston parish, to Sir John Darcy (<i>d</i>. 1347), a powerful figure both in Yorkshire and at court, where he was successively steward of the household and king's chamberlain. The Master William Fyncheden recorded as Darcy's steward in 1343 was doubtless a kinsman, one close enough for the two Williams to be recorded as &#145;elder&#146; and &#145;younger&#146; when they witnessed a deed together in 1354. By then, perhaps with Darcy's assistance, William Fyncheden junior was practising as a lawyer. He is first recorded as an advocate in the Westminster courts in 1350, and in the same year he was named to a commission of embankments in Yorkshire. Thereafter he was a regular appointee to special commissions of oyer and terminer during the 1350s, mostly in Yorkshire but some also in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and Lincolnshire. In March 1351 he was made a peace commissioner in the West Riding, an appointment that was regularly repeated thereafter. He was also several times appointed a justice of labourers, in both Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.<br>
<br>By the mid-1350s Fyncheden's judicial and administrative activities were visibly expanding. In February 1355 he was appointed to investigate all unauthorized alienation from royal lands in the four northernmost counties, along with Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. Then in February 1359 he was named to a commission to investigate trespasses against the king and queen and their tenants within the lordship of Richmondshire. The high standing that Fyncheden had gained in the king's eyes is further shown by his appointment in July 1360 to inquire whether lands belonging to the late Roger Mortimer, second earl of March, had been held of the king or were part of the principality of Wales: Fyncheden and his colleagues found for the latter. In June 1362 he was made a king's serjeant.<br>
<br>Fyncheden's career continued to develop in the 1360s. The geographical scope of his commissions expanded, to include commissions of oyer and terminer from Sussex, Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire, Kent, and Gloucestershire, as well as Yorkshire. On 29 October 1365 he was raised to the bench of common pleas, and later that year he was knighted, receiving a grant of &pound;40 a year. His new position on the bench probably led to his first attendance at parliament, in May 1366. In this parliament, and all subsequent assemblies until 1373, Fyncheden is recorded as a trier of petitions, always (except once) handling cases from England, Ireland, Wales, and Scotland. He received personal summonses to parliament in 1368, 1369, 1371, and 1373. He acted repeatedly as a justice of assize and of gaol delivery; in the former capacity he was mainly employed in the home counties and west midlands, but in the latter he most often visited the northern counties. His appointments to peace commissions were restricted to single regions&#151;either Lancashire or the West Riding&#151;until 1368, when his duties took him to all three Yorkshire ridings, Northumberland, Cumberland, Gloucestershire, and Newcastle. During these years Fyncheden had also been acquiring an estate, nearly all of it in the West Riding. By 24 July 1364 he was married to a woman named Alice (her surname is unknown), with whom he received a joint grant of land in Methley; he also secured, either for life or in fee, the manors of Wrenthorpe, Barnby Dun, Slaithwaite, and Woodsome, three-quarters of the manor of Hickleton, and property in Doncaster, Bentley, Wheatley, Woolley, and Notton. It was doubtless for professional reasons that he bought a house in London.<br>
<br>On 14 April 1371 Fyncheden was appointed chief justice of the common bench. He had long been associated with John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, whom he served both as a lawyer and as steward of Pontefract and Tickhill, and it seems likely that he owed his elevation to the duke's influence. His tenure was uncontroversial, however, and in any case relatively brief. He was still in office in Trinity term 1374, but the appointment of Sir Robert Bealknap to succeed him on 10 October that year suggests that Fyncheden died during the summer. He is not known to have had any children. His wife survived him.<br>
