<span class="headword">Thorne,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1573), <span class="occ">composer and poet</span>, is of obscure origins; nothing is known about his parents or the place and date of his birth. From 1550 he resided in the York parish of St Michael-le-Belfry; he was wealthy and had lands at Clifton and leases of the tithes of two parsonages. He is probably to be identified with John Thorne, singing-man of the choir of the parish church of St Mary-at-Hill, London, in 1539&#150;40.<br>
<br>Thorne was appointed organist at York Minster on 24 July 1542, having received payment the previous year as &#145;organist within the choir&#146;. When the minster organs were temporarily silenced in 1552, Thorne, as master of the choristers, was ordered to &#145;helpe to sing Divyne Service within the quere of the churche&#146;  (Raine, <span class="italic">Statutes</span>, 77), though his stipend as organist continued without interruption until 1573. He also served as keeper of the fabric from 1567; his account for the year 1567&#150;8 reflects the zeal with which the Marian decorations were swept away under orders from the new dean, Matthew Hutton, and includes the entry &#145;for making playne and washyng over with whyte the places where the altar stood&#146;  (Raine, <span class="italic">Fabric Rolls</span>, 113&#150;14).<br>
<br>Thomas Morley cited Thorne, with Redford, Tallis, and others, as a composer particularly skilled in writing upon plainsong. In view of this high opinion of his abilities it is unfortunate that so little of Thorne's music has survived. In the Bodleian Library, Oxford, there is a four-part <span class="roman">In nomine</span>  (MSS mus. sch. D.212&#150;216), and a manuscript in the British Library  (Add. MS 29996) contains the organ score of a motet, <span class="italic">Exultabant sancti</span>. Both works are in the imitative polyphonic style of the mid-century, as is the three-part Marian motet <span class="italic">Stella coeli</span>, included by Baldwin in his commonplace book of <i>c</i>.1600  (BL, Royal Music MS 24.d.2, fols. 161<i>v</i>&#150;163<i>r</i>) and later printed by Hawkins. The text of this motet pleads for deliverance from pestilence, making it probable that the work was composed in one of the years in which York suffered a particularly severe plague. The setting is hardly comparable to the best work of Redford or Tallis, but the counterpoint is technically assured and there is considerable rhythmic subtlety. Thorne's willingness to adapt to changing circumstances is evident from his setting of the <span class="roman">Te Deum</span> (English words), of which only the tenor part is extant. The underlay is predominantly syllabic, no doubt to fulfil Archbishop Holgate's requirement in 1552 that music sung at York should be &#145;withoute any reportes or repetinges which may induce any obscurenes to the herers&#146;  (Raine, <span class="italic">Statutes</span>, 74).<br>
<br>Three poems by Thorne are in a manuscript once thought to be in John Redford's hand  (BL, Add. MS 15233). One, &#145;The Hunt ys up&#146; (fols. 33<i>r</i>&#150;34<i>v</i>), is a religious parody of Gray's popular ballad; the others were subsequently printed in Richard Edwards's <span class="italic">Paradyse of Daynty Devises</span> (1576). Another poem in this collection (no. 21) is signed &#145;M. T.&#146; and is probably also by Thorne.<br>
<br>Thorne died in York on 7 December 1573 and was buried in York Minster. His epitaph, recorded by Drake, celebrated his skill in logic as well as in music. He was succeeded as organist and master of the choristers by his son Henry Thorne, who continued in office until his death in 1597.<br>
