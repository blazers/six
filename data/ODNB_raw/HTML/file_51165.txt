<span class="headword">Pinney, Sir  Reginald John</span>  (1863&#150;1943), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born at Camp House, Clifton, Bristol, on 2 August 1863, the eldest son of the Revd John Charles Pinney (1835&#150;1911), vicar of Coleshill, Warwickshire; he was thus grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22303/', "Charles Pinney")</script>, mayor of Bristol. He had five brothers and a sister. His mother, Harriet Margaretta Wingfield-Digby, died in 1877 during his time at Winchester College (1877&#150;81). Pinney entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1882 and was gazetted in 1884 into the 7th foot (Royal Fusiliers); he entered the Staff College, Camberley, in 1889 and graduated in 1890.<br>
<br>Pinney was deputy assistant adjutant-general at Quetta, India, from 1896 to 1901, and assistant adjutant-general to the Egyptian army in 1909&#150;13. On 28 August 1900 he had married Hester (<i>b</i>. 1874/5), only daughter of Henry Head JP, of Shoreham, Sussex; they had three sons and three daughters. In the period between his two imperial postings, he fought in the South African War as a major in 1901&#150;2, and commanded the 4th battalion of his regiment in 1903&#150;7, being promoted brevet colonel in 1906.<br>
<br>In 1913 Pinney was appointed brigadier-general in command of the Devon and Cornwall brigade, and in August 1914 he was appointed to command 23rd infantry brigade in 8th division: four regular battalions, just returned from overseas&#151;strangers to him and to one another. They reached France on 6 November. Two battalions were put straight into the line at Ypres. Pinney led his brigade, going well forward at moments of difficulty, in the capture of Neuve Chapelle (10&#150;12 March) and on Aubers Ridge (9 May 1915). Shortly afterwards (8 June) he was promoted major-general, and he took 35th division to France in January 1916. This was nicknamed the bantam division; its infantry soldiers, all volunteers for Kitchener's army, ranged in height from 5 feet to 5 feet 3 inches (the army's pre-war minimum). Pinney took them in mid-July into the struggle for High Wood on the Somme, where they suffered many casualties for small gains.<br>
<br>In September 1916 Pinney was transferred to command 33rd division, composed of regulars, Territorials, and Kitchener's army volunteers. Again there were many casualties for small gains on the Somme. In the following spring Pinney led them in the battle of Arras, where novel tactics secured some advance. He is supposed to have been the original on whom Siegfried Sassoon based his &#145;cheery old card&#146; of a general whose staff were &#145;incompetent swine&#146;  (private information).<br>
<br>While 33rd division was holding the extreme left of the allied line, on the coast at Nieuport, Pinney was injured; he thus missed most of the battle of Passchendaele, in which his division suffered heavily. It was called out of army reserve when, in mid-April 1918, Pinney fought a decisive minor action round Meteren. Ludendorff's second main attack, at the hinge of the French and British armies which was held by a Portuguese formation, broke clean through a gap 2 miles wide. Pinney, who had a sound eye for country, reconnoitred it with his divisional machine-gun officer, who had twelve guns with him. On 12 and 13 April 1918 this machine-gun company, aided by stragglers&#151;the best were Australian&#151;held the gap against six good German divisions; by 20 April Ludendorff had admitted defeat.<br>
<br>33rd division took part in the subsequent advance to the German border that brought the war to an end; and in February 1919 Pinney retired. He had been made CB in 1917 and advanced to KCB in 1918: &#145;the true knight whose spurs were won in battle&#146;, as a friend put it  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 10 March 1943). He settled at Racedown Manor, Broadwindsor, in west Dorset, once home to William Wordsworth. He was high sheriff for the county in 1923, and a deputy lieutenant; colonel of the Royal Fusiliers (1924&#150;33); and a benign influence on the neighbourhood. His eldest son, Bernard, was killed in November 1941, in heroic circumstances, commanding an anti-tank battery in Libya. Pinney died in Dorset County Hospital, Dorchester, on 18 February 1943, survived by his wife. He was buried at Broadwindsor.<br>
