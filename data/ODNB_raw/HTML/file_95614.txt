<span class="headword">Carrington,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1798, <em>d.</em> 1870), <span class="occ">geologist and archaeologist</span>, was born at Wetton, Staffordshire, where he was baptized on 25 November 1798, the son of Samuel Carrington (1772/3&#150;1840), leader of a team of miners (&#145;copers&#146;) in the duke of Devonshire's copper mines at Ecton, and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1829). He attended the village school at Wetton, and at the age of twenty-one emigrated with his father to America but &#145;was dissatisfied with that country and gladly returned home with the intention of never quitting again his native parish&#146;  (Briggs). He became master of Wetton School, and was parish clerk, positions he held until his death, while also keeping a small farm in the village. On 29 December 1823 he married Olive (1802&#150;1884), eldest child of Thomas Chadwick of Grindon, Staffordshire, with whom he had nine children.<br>
<br>As village schoolmaster in Wetton, Carrington gained a reputation as the local &#145;wise man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, repr. in Zoeteweij, 282). He had remarkable physical and mental energy, and was a keen observer of natural phenomena, whether rock forms, fauna, or insect life, interpreting their characteristics in the light of natural theology as &#145;proofs of design&#146;  (ibid.) by a divine creator. He was also a skilled draughtsman, carefully recording his observations. His archaeological enthusiasms might well have lain dormant but for a meeting in 1845 with Thomas Bateman, the Derbyshire archaeologist and collector. On Bateman's behalf he excavated, between that date and 1852, over 100 burial mounds, mainly in the area around his native village. The contents of the tumuli were passed on to the Bateman Museum at Middleton by Youlgrave, Derbyshire, together with accounts of the openings which were sent to his patron in a series of letters. Carrington's excavations form a complete section in Bateman's <span class="italic">Ten Years' Diggings in Celtic and Saxon Grave Hills</span> (1861).<br>
<br>After Bateman's death in 1861 Carrington continued his investigation of local archaeological sites with John Lucas of Fenny Bentley, Derbyshire. In 1864&#150;5, under the auspices of the Midland Scientific Association, he directed the clearing out of Thor's Cave, Wetton, where evidence was found of Celtic, Romano-British, and Anglo-Saxon occupation. He also dug over, in a somewhat desultory fashion, the site of a Romano-British farmstead at Borough Holes adjacent to his smallholding in Wetton, which reinforced his claim that his native village had been a &#145;North Staffordshire Pompeii&#146;  (Roberts, 14).<br>
<br>Carrington's interest in geology led him to range over the Carboniferous limestone country around his home, often in the company of his daughter Ann (<i>d</i>. 1874), who helped him to gather specimens. He amassed thousands of fossils, some of which were sold during his lifetime and are preserved in a number of repositories, including the British Geological Survey at Keyworth, the Natural History Museum, London, the Passmore Edwards Museum, London, and Sheffield City Museum. His remaining assemblage, which he displayed in the pantry of his home in Wetton, was purchased in 1870 by the Nottingham Natural History Museum, and is now preserved at Wollaton Hall, Nottingham. Among his many geological finds were six species that he was the first to identify in the local limestone; four were named either after him or his native village. Notable examples of brachiopods that he collected were cited in the writings of the palaeontologist Thomas Davidson.<br>
<br>Carrington contributed geological and archaeological papers to the <span class="italic">Reliquary</span>, edited by Llewellynn Jewitt, the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Midland Scientific Association</span>, and the <span class="italic">Transactions of the North Staffordshire Field Club</span>. He also wrote a curious play called &#145;The Barrow-Digger's Restitution of the Lost Archives of Ancient Britain&#146;, which survives in manuscript, embellished with numerous pen-and-ink sketches of barrows, burials, artefacts, and cartoons relating to the action of the work, which takes place in and around Wetton. The main characters are clearly Thomas Bateman and Carrington himself. He is also depicted as one of the characters in Eliza Meteyard's story for children <span class="italic">Dora and Her Papa</span> (1869).<br>
<br>Carrington died on 8 October 1870 in Wetton, where he was buried in St Margaret's churchyard. In 1874, following a public subscription organized by Thomas Wardle, president of the North Staffordshire Naturalists' Field Club, and headed by the duke of Devonshire, an elaborate tombstone, designed by George Gilbert Scott, was erected over his grave. The memorial stone was decorated with characteristic fossils native to the district, including the six types that he was the first to discover on the north Staffordshire limestone. Carrington was recalled by the antiquary Charles Roach Smith as &#145;a very intelligent man; a good geologist; and an enthusiastic excavator of tumuli. Seldom are such men appreciated; and I fear he was not an exception from the common fate of the worthy, unselfish poor&#146;  (<span class="italic">Retrospections, Social and Archaeological</span>, vol. 1, 1883, 19).<br>
