<span class="headword">Medwin,  Thomas</span>  (1788&#150;1869), <span class="occ">writer and biographer</span>, was born on 20 March 1788 in Horsham, Sussex, the second child of Thomas Charles Medwin (1752/3&#150;1829), a solicitor and steward to the duke of Norfolk, and his wife, Mary (<i>c</i>.1760&#150;<i>c</i>.1850), daughter of John Pilfold and first cousin to Shelley's mother, Elizabeth Pilfold. Like Shelley, who was four years younger, Medwin attended Syon House Academy, entering about 1798 and leaving in 1804 to attend an unidentified &#145;public&#146; school before matriculating at Oxford on 2 December 1805. Although Medwin's veracity as a biographer has been questioned, his close relationship with his young cousin in these early years is attested to by Shelley's earliest extant letter and by later correspondence showing the poet's continuing respect and affection for his &#145;old friend and fellow-townsman&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>, 2.240).<br>
<br>In 1807 or 1808 Medwin visited Wales, where he met the fourteen-year-old Felicia Dorothea Browne (later Hemans). On his return he incited Shelley's interest in Felicia's poetry, initiating a brief correspondence between the two young poets. During this period the boys collaborated on a novel, &#145;The Nightmare&#146; (no longer extant). Before Shelley's arrival at Oxford in October 1810, Medwin had left the university without a degree and was living at Lincoln's Inn, perhaps studying law independently at his father's behest. Whether he or Shelley or anyone really picked up a scrap of German poetry in Lincoln's Inn Fields and whether that scrap later became the seed of &#145;The Wandering Jew&#146; remains a subject of heated debate among Shelley biographers and critics, along with the extent of Medwin's contribution to the poem. But, as Medwin remembered vividly thirty-six years later, Shelley's career at Oxford was about to come to an abrupt and unpleasant end. At four o'clock in the morning of 27 March 1811, Medwin was awakened by Shelley's high-pitched voice excitedly crying out that he had been expelled for atheism. After Shelley's elopement with Harriet Westbrook in August 1811 (during which time he borrowed money from Medwin's father and sought his legal advice), the lives of the two young men diverged and they did not meet again until 1820.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Medwin incurred his father's displeasure by rejecting a legal career. According to his biographer Ernest J. Lovell jun., his father's affluence and his mother's connections with the Sussex gentry had bred in Medwin expensive tastes and an aversion to earning his living. Now the eldest surviving son, his brother John having died in a fall in 1806, he persuaded his father to purchase him first a cornetcy and then a lieutenantcy in the army. Sent to India, he joined the 24th light dragoons on 12 November 1813, arriving at Cawnpore after a 1200-mile journey up the Ganges. Less than a year after his arrival, probably in June 1814, he contracted dysentery, resulting in lifelong disease of the liver. Of his four and a half years with the regiment, twelve months were spent on leave of absence. Although Medwin spent much of his tour of duty hunting, attending parties, and writing in his journal, he probably participated in the siege of the fort at Hathras in February&#150;March 1817. At some point during his enlistment, he met and befriended Edward Ellerker Williams, then serving in another regiment.<br>
<br>On 8 May 1818 Medwin received permission to return to England on an eighteen-month leave of absence. Despite his ill health, however, he did not leave India until October. The day before he sailed, Medwin felicitously discovered a copy of Shelley's <span class="italic">Revolt of Islam</span> &#145;at a Parsee bookstall&#146;  (Medwin, ed. Buxton Forman, 230), rekindling his interest in the young genius he had half forgotten. On 24 May 1819 the 24th light dragoons disbanded, and in July Medwin went on the half-pay of a lieutenant. (Though he is frequently referred to as Captain Medwin, Mary Shelley disputed his claim to this title and the issue remains unresolved.)<br>
<br>After a brief stay in England, Medwin travelled to the continent, still sporting a magnificent military moustache lubricated with bear grease. He arrived in Geneva on 20 September 1819 and was soon joined by Edward Williams and Jane Cleveland Johnson (who was known as Jane Williams though the couple were not married). In the autumn of 1820 Medwin accepted Shelley's invitation to join him in Italy and spent many contented hours reading, writing, and conversing with Shelley and Lord Byron. After the deaths of Shelley and Williams in July 1822 and of Byron two years later, these conversations, which Medwin had recorded in his journal, became the basis for the highly popular but controversial <span class="italic">Conversations of Lord Byron</span> (1824).<br>
<br>Medwin's reputation and social position were sufficient to enable him on 2 November 1824 to marry Anne Henrietta Starnford, countess of Starnford (1788&#150;1868), born Baroness Hamilton of Sweden. At first the marriage was happy and Medwin lived in high style, &#145;moving in the most exclusive circles&#146;  (Lovell, 220). Their first daughter, ostentatiously baptized Catherine Mary Anne Pilfold Hamilton Medwin, was born in Florence on 3 November 1825. But before the birth of his second daughter, Henriette, in 1829, lavish spending coupled with speculation in art had resulted in financial ruin. In September 1829 the destitute Medwin hurried to England for the reading of his father's will, only to find that the elder Medwin, exasperated by his son's extravagance, had left him only 10 guineas for a memorial ring. Unable to support the wife whose fortune he had squandered, Medwin returned to Italy determined to live alone and supplement his scanty income through his writing, leaving his wife and their two small daughters in Florence. In 1831 he returned to England where he sold his commission (apparently at a profit) and, according to Lovell, &#145;set about again trying to clear his name&#146; of the attacks on the authenticity of his <span class="italic">Conversations</span>  (ibid., 252). The publication in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> of his &#145;Memoir of Shelley&#146; (1832) and &#145;The Shelley papers&#146; (1832&#150;3) established him (along with Thomas Jefferson Hogg, whose &#145;Shelley at Oxford&#146; articles appeared almost simultaneously) as one of the few living authorities on the poet (the articles were published together in 1833 as <span class="italic">The Shelley Papers. Memoir of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span>). Medwin also published a substantial amount of literary criticism and poetry; one play; a novel, <span class="italic">Lady Singleton</span>, attacking England's stringent divorce laws; and the semi-autobiographical <span class="italic">Angler in Wales</span> (1834), incorporating material from his Indian journals. In 1846 he returned to England to visit his ageing mother and to obtain letters for his most important work, <span class="italic">The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley</span> (2 vols., 1847), the first full-length biography of the poet.<br>
<br>Though Medwin was working abroad from limited sources and his faulty memory sometimes led to misquotations or errors in dates, he seems to be guilty of only two deliberate distortions in his writings on Shelley: the implication in the <span class="italic">Conversations</span> that he had been present at Shelley's cremation and the conflation in the &#145;Memoir of Shelley&#146; of two trips abroad into one to disguise the married poet's elopement with young Mary Godwin.<br>
<br>Well aware that such mendacity was no longer feasible and fearful of adverse publicity, Mary Shelley strenuously opposed the publication of Medwin's biography and condemned it unread, interpreting Medwin's request for reimbursement of his expenses in exchange for withdrawal from publication as an attempt at blackmail. Her reaction, perpetuated in Lady Jane Shelley's <span class="italic">Shelley Memorials</span> and in H. Buxton Forman's introduction to the 1913 edition of Medwin's <span class="italic">Life</span>, is largely responsible for the general disrepute in which Medwin's biography has long been held. Admittedly the book is riddled with small inaccuracies such as his reference to Claire Clairmont as Mary Shelley's &#145;half sister&#146;  (p. 129), but his depiction of Shelley is straightforward, undistorted by the conflicting emotions that led Hogg to exaggerate Shelley's eccentricities and even deliberately to alter documents. An ardent admirer and astute critic of Shelley's poetry, Medwin had neither the motive nor the inclination to harm his cousin's reputation as Mary Shelley feared.<br>
<br>Medwin's last years were spent in the company of fellow poet Caroline Champion de Crespigny, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bathurst (1798&#150;1858&times;62), whom he had met about 1843. Accepted into &eacute;lite social circles in Germany and elsewhere, he seems to have been respected as a critic and forgiven, at least on the continent, for the abandonment of his wife. He returned to England in 1862 and continued to write and to annotate his <span class="italic">Life of Shelley</span>. After an extended illness that prevented him from accepting Sir Percy Shelley's invitation to visit Boscombe Manor, he died on 2 August 1869 in the Carfax, North Horsham, aged eighty-one. He was buried a few days later in Denne Road cemetery, also in the Carfax.<br>
