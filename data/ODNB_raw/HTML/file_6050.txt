<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Comyns, Sir  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1667&#150;1740), <span class="occ">judge and legal writer</span>, was the eldest surviving son of William Comyns of Lincoln's Inn, barrister, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Matthew Rudd, of Little Baddow, Essex. The Comyns or Cummins were a well established Essex family. He was admitted a student at Lincoln's Inn in May 1683, probably commencing his law studies in 1684, since he also matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1683. He was called to the bar in 1690, and practised in king's bench until 1705, when he took the degree of serjeant-at-law (8 June) and moved to common pleas practice. He was junior MP for Maldon in the tory interest from 1701 to 1708, and from 1710 to 1715, when he was unseated on petition. In 1711&#150;12 he acted as temporary chairman of the elections committee.<br>
<br>After 1715 Comyns was by his own account &#145;discarded by all but the Tories&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>, 569); in 1719 he acted for high-church defendants accused of riot and vagrancy for making a charity collection without a begging licence  (&#145;Trial of the Rev. Wm Hendley and others&#146;, <span class="italic">State trials</span>, 15.1407). In 1722 Comyns was again returned to parliament for Maldon, standing at the solicitation of Sir Robert Raymond, who had crossed to the government in 1717 and risen with Sir Robert Walpole. Raymond was also responsible for Comyns's appointment (on 7 September 1726) as a baron of the exchequer, when he was also knighted. In January 1736 he was transferred to the common pleas, and two years later (in July 1738) was appointed lord chief baron of the exchequer by Lord Hardwicke. Comyns was married three times, on 21 April 1693 to Anne Gurdon (<i>d</i>. 1705), on 20 October 1708 to Elizabeth Courthope, and in 1726 to Anne Wilbraham; a son from his first marriage predeceased him and he left no children. He died on 13 November 1740, and was buried in the parish church of Writtle, near Chelmsford. His estate of Highlands, Widford, near Chelmsford, passed to his nephew, John Comyns. Comyns's tory background is visible to only a limited extent in his judicial work: he was less inclined to favour the tithe-payer over the tithe-owner than Sir Geoffrey Gilbert and Sir Thomas Pengelly, and more willing than some contemporary judges to use patriarchalist arguments in gender-related litigation. On the other hand, like other, mostly whig, contemporary judges, he made considerable and quite sophisticated use of civil and canon law sources, and displayed explicit commitment both to freedom of contract and of disposition of property, and to strict construction against the crown of criminal law and procedure.<br>
<br>Two legal works were published after Comyns's death. His <span class="italic">Reports of Cases Adjudged in the Courts of King's Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer</span> was translated from the original law French by his nephew and heir, John, and published in one volume in 1744. A second edition by Samuel Rose appeared in 1792. The <span class="italic">Reports</span> tracks Comyns's career, covering mainly king's bench cases to 1705, mainly common pleas cases to 1726, exchequer cases to 1736, common pleas to 1738, and exchequer again to 1739. Those from his judicial work in the exchequer are much fuller and more valuable than the earlier reports. A translation of Comyns's <span class="italic">Digest of the Laws of England</span> was published in five instalments between 1762 and 1767, and a supplement in one volume was added by &#145;a gentleman of the Inner Temple&#146; in 1776. Subsequent editions appeared in 1800 and 1822, and an American version in New York and Philadelphia in 1824&#150;6. The <span class="italic">Digest</span> clearly originated as a student abridgement or commonplace. Its quality is variable, with the section on pleading exceptionally well developed; its legal thought is generally conservative. These features led to the work's acquiring high authority in the period of tory ascendancy on the bench in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century; thus, for example, Lord Ellenborough described the <span class="italic">Digest</span> as a &#145;book of very excellent authority&#146;  (<i>Kingdon v. Nottle</i>, 1813).<br>
