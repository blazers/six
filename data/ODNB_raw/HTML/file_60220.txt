<span class="headword">Clark <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Carswell]</span>,  Elizabeth Thomson</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Joan Ure]</span>  (1918&#150;1978), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 22 June 1918 at 31 Fenham Road, Wallsend, near Newcastle upon Tyne, of Scottish parents, John MacFie Carswell and Janet (Jenny) Love Thomson. Her father was an engineering draughtsman for Vickers Armstrong. Elizabeth was the eldest in a family of two sisters and a brother, and spent most of her life in and around Glasgow. When she was twelve her mother developed tuberculosis, and she assumed the multiple role of daughter, housewife, and surrogate mother to her siblings. Despite the wishes of her teachers, she left school (Langside Academy) at fourteen and combined her domestic duties with work as a clerk. On 15 July 1939 she married a Glasgow businessman, John Lochhead Clark (<i>b</i>. 1912/13), with whom she had a daughter, Frances, the same year. She raised her single-handedly while her husband fought in the Second World War.<br>
<br>Her brother, Ian, recalled that in childhood Elizabeth would write and narrate stories and poems for him and his sister. He also remembered her as typically being last home from school, dreamily walking backwards along the pavement, mulling over the day's discoveries, and recalled weekend visits to their grandmother's home where there was much singing led by several aunts and uncles from the Greenock Gaelic Choir. When she began to write publicly in the 1950s, Elizabeth adopted a pseudonym, Joan, the name of her sister, who had committed suicide soon after the war, and Ure, because she liked the sound.<br>
<br>Ploughing a lonely furrow in the Scotland of the 1950s, Elizabeth veered more and more towards the particular challenge of playwriting, one especially daunting for a woman in a heavily male-orientated society. Strikingly beautiful, but physically fragile from the tuberculosis and the anorexia nervosa which were to lead to her comparatively early death, and constantly aware of the conflicting demands of conventional marriage and deeply committed writing, she gradually found, or created, platforms for her work. <span class="italic">Punctuated Rhythms</span> was staged at the Falcon Theatre, Glasgow, in 1962, <span class="italic">I See myself as this Young Girl</span> at Glasgow Citizens' Close Theatre in 1965, several plays by the Arts Theatre Group at Glasgow University from 1965 to 1971 and then by the touring Stage Company (Scotland), which she helped to found, through to 1973. Thereafter her plays were presented at theatres throughout Scotland, and several broadcast by BBC Radio Scotland.<br>
<br>Given Elizabeth's personal history and the climate of the times, the plays may initially appear examples of conscious, even didactic, feminism. But they transcend rigid categorization, ranging over such areas as love, its end, the role of the artist, the state of Scotland, religion, marriage, the Scottish mother, the Scottish father, even the Scottish soldier. Like her poems and essays they display an affectionate though measured appreciation of male attitudes and responsibilities, an awareness of the price women may pay for asserting their independence. Generally short and moderately cast, partly for economic reasons but also reflecting the elegant conciseness of her rhetoric, they dance off the page with wit, subtlety, sheer fun, and a poet's precision. She was, though, a poet who exploited the additional possibilities of the stage: she incorporates a jazz combo in <span class="italic">Punctuated Rhythms</span>, a dancer in <span class="italic">Scarlet Mood</span>, a blues singer in <span class="italic">Nothing may Come of it</span>, a solitary double bed (and two actors) in <span class="italic">My Year for being Rich and Famous is Nearly over</span>. Of more than thirty plays, perhaps the two which best encapsulate her art are <span class="italic">The Hard Case</span>, originating in the Ibrox Stadium football disaster of 1971 when sixty-six mainly young Glaswegians died in a crowd stampede, and <span class="italic">Seven characters out of the dream (a comedy for 7 costumes left over from a Shakespearean production&#151;made in one piece)</span>. Elizabeth Clark died of respiratory failure caused by asthma on 24 February 1978 in Ballochmyle Hospital, Mauchline, Ayrshire, and was cremated at Linn crematorium, Glasgow.<br>
