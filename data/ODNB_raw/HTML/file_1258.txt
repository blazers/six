<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bampfield,  Francis</span>  (1614&#150;1684), <span class="occ">Seventh Day Baptist minister</span>, was probably born at Poltimore, Devon, the third son of John Bampfield (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1650), who served as sheriff of Devon, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Drake of Buckland Monachorum, Devon; Thomas's brother was Sir Francis Drake. Intended for the ministry by his pious parents, Bampfield received his early education in godly families. In 1631, aged sixteen, he entered Wadham College, Oxford, as a commoner, matriculating on 16 May 1634 and graduating BA on 4 July 1635 and MA on 7 July 1638. Reflecting on his Oxford years in 1681 he wrote of &#145;that void space of his time&#146; in which he had made little advancement in &#145;Scripture-Learning&#146;  (Bampfield, 2, 36) and mocked puritan students.<br>
<br>Bampfield was ordained deacon by Bishop Joseph Hall of Exeter, and priest by Bishop Robert Skinner of Bristol. Appointed rector of Rampisham, Dorset, on 25 July 1639, he used the income of nearly &pound;100 p.a. to provide hospitality, assist the poor, and purchase bibles. He was appointed a prebendary of Exeter Cathedral on 15 May 1641. When civil war erupted Bampfield supported the royalists and consulted Dr Gilbert Ironside about the legality of paying taxes levied by parliament. An opponent of the solemn league and covenant, he drafted a statement explaining his position. In May 1645 he took a horse and weapons to royalist troops at Berry Pomeroy, Devon. As late as 1674, according to Richard Baxter, Bampfield was still speaking against the parliamentary cause. He used the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> longer than any minister in Dorset, stopping only when compelled by troops. Bampfield had had a change of heart by January 1647, for on 19 January his father, with the Dorset committee's approval, presented him with the rectory of Wraxall. His parting gift to the parishioners at Rampisham was a new parsonage worth approximately &pound;300. In his new living he supported himself on an annuity of &pound;80 p.a. provided by his father, much of which Bampfield used for charitable purposes. When his congregation resisted his efforts to impose greater discipline he began to preach at Sherborne about 1653, following William Lyford's death. He was formally admitted as its vicar on 28 April 1657 in a service led by an Independent and a presbyterian minister and attended by 2000 people. Bampfield had the triers' approval, though he neither sought it nor appeared before them. Nor did he take the engagement, contrary to Edmund Calamy's claim. Indeed, for preaching against the engagement he was briefly imprisoned; he may have been the Bamfield released on a &pound;1000 recognizance on 19 September 1659. Bampfield's assistant at Sherborne was Humphrey Philips, formerly chaplain to Bampfield's father and now a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Bampfield regained his prebend, but he declined an invitation to become rector of Trinity, Dorchester. On 1 November 1660 Baxter recommended him for a bishopric to Chancellor Hyde, but nothing came of this. About 1661, when Bampfield became very ill, he sought the anointing of the sick mentioned in <span class="roman">James</span> 5. After neighbouring clergy refused this ministration he anointed himself, claiming the authority of a secret voice, and subsequently recovered. About this time he voluntarily paid the exchequer &pound;30 to compensate for augmentations from the royal revenue Philips had received as his assistant. The Sunday before St Bartholomew's day 1662 Bampfield preached a farewell sermon at Sherborne, from which he and Philips were shortly ejected; Bampfield also lost his prebend. The <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span> to which he had once been so faithful was, he now opined, an &#145;unclean Constitution of humanely invented Worship&#146;  (Bampfield, 4). While conducting a service for a small group of neighbours in his home on 19 September 1662 Bampfield, with Philips and approximately twenty-five others, was arrested and detained for five days. Summoned before the deputy lieutenants Bampfield, insisting his activities were not seditious, was released after providing sureties and agreeing to appear at the next assizes. With Philips, Bampfield went to his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1260/', "Thomas Bampfield's")</script> house at Dunkerton, near Bath, where they held more conventicles. For illegally preaching at Shaftesbury, Dorset, Bampfield and John Westley were arrested on 23 July 1663 and imprisoned in Dorchester. The two were fined 40 marks apiece, but this was reduced by half, with a provision to compound for 1 <i>s</i>. per pound. Although Westley was released after three months Bampfield remained in prison with other dissenting clergy&#151;Peter Ince, Thomas Hallet, Josiah Banger, and John Sacheverell. About a year later Bampfield wrote to Charles II, denouncing sedition, promising not to oppose lawful authority, and affirming his willingness to suffer rather than cease preaching. After he had been incarcerated a year and a half, Bampfield and his associates were offered freedom if they provided security for good behaviour, but Bampfield refused because he deemed this tantamount to acknowledging guilt.<br>
<br>During the early part of his imprisonment Bampfield preached every day and twice on Sunday until the gaoler received orders to curtail him. In prison Bampfield gathered a congregation to whom he preached as much as sixteen times a week near the end of his confinement. About 1664, after concluding that all ministers in the <span class="roman">Bible</span> had known the scriptural languages, he resolved to acquire greater facility &#145;in the inner knowledg of the Hebrew Significations by the Holy Spirits Teachings&#146;  (Bampfield, 8). About a year later Bampfield concluded that both scripture and nature prescribed Saturday as the sabbath for Christians as well as Jews. When two ministers failed to dissuade him he began holding services on Saturday. Bampfield's conviction that Saturday was the proper day for Christians to worship and rest was intimately related to the millenarian outlook of the Seventh Day Baptists. The papal Antichrist, the little horn of the apocalyptic prophecy in <span class="roman">Daniel</span> 8, was adjudged responsible for denigrating the fourth commandment by altering the sabbath and urging respect for unscriptural holy days. Approximately a year later Bampfield had a vision in which he was seemingly transported to heaven, where he &#145;had a clear view of Christ in his Glorified Humanity&#146;  (Bampfield, 4). He recorded other visions, one of which he deemed the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Such experiences, including the marriage of his body, soul, and spirit to the Trinity, were essentially mystical. Bampfield's sabbatarian views elicited refutations from Baxter in <span class="italic">The Divine Appointment of the Lord's Day</span> (1671), and William Benn in <span class="italic">The Judgment of Mr. Francis Bampfield</span> (1672), which includes Bampfield's account of his position.<br>
<br>The earl of Arlington issued a warrant for Bampfield's release on 17 May 1672, and on 29 June he received a general licence to preach under the declaration of indulgence. During his imprisonment he had embraced the doctrine of believers' baptism, and he and a companion now went to Salisbury, where Bampfield was baptized in the Avon &#145;as by the Hand of Christ himself&#146;  (Bampfield, 17). While in gaol Bampfield had met Damaris Town (<i>d</i>. 1694), who provided relief to prisoners; her father, a doctor of divinity in Limerick, had lost his estate in the Irish rising. For a time she accompanied Bampfield on his preaching itineraries, and he finally married her on 23 September 1673 to avoid scandal. Because she had no dowry Bampfield was criticized for marrying beneath his station, but he retorted that he preferred grace to earthly riches. Later the same year he went to London, settling in Bethnal Green. Before founding his own church in 1674 he preached to Seventh Day Baptist congregations in Mill Yard and Bell Lane. In 1675 he preached to churches in Salisbury (where he was imprisoned for eighteen weeks), Hampshire, Dorset, Gloucestershire, and Berkshire. From Salisbury gaol he defended himself in <span class="italic">The Open Confessor and the Free Prisoner</span> (1675). After schism rent his congregation he organized the remnants into a new church on 5 March 1676. The following year he published two substantive volumes, the first of which, <span class="italic">All in One</span>, averred that proper teaching of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> was the way to perfect the arts and sciences. On this foundation he proposed erecting a new educational system, with lecturers in every county, teaching geared to students' abilities, instruction in Hebrew for all students, an end to traditional philosophy and astrology, and the study of scriptural geography. The second work, <span class="italic">Septima dies</span>, was an exposition of the works of creation, including a defence of the seventh day sabbath and an explication of covenant theology. During the Popish Plot scare Bampfield forwarded a prophecy from Elizabeth Hooker to the king, urging him to establish Christ's laws.<br>
<br>In 1681 Bampfield moved his expanding congregation to Pinners' Hall, Broad Street, a decision made by lot. After the move increasing numbers of young men and women joined the congregation. Bampfield founded several (unidentified) congregations in several counties, though his attempt to establish an association of sabbatarian churches in England, Wales, the Netherlands, and New England failed for unexplained reasons. In part Bampfield had wanted an association to train ministers, provide better education for children, relieve the indigent, and convert Jews. He offered a blueprint for his proposed educational reforms in <span class="italic">The House of Wisdom</span> (1681), in which he repeated his call for instruction in Hebrew and a curriculum shaped by scripture. The academy he envisioned in this work would provide instruction in a variety of subjects, accommodating students' interests and abilities. Pupils could study for the magistracy or ministry as well as for other occupations. Most of the instruction was utilitarian in nature, dealing with such subjects as husbandry, seamanship, the military arts, and artisanry. Due attention was accorded to geometry, medicine, and astronomy, but Bampfield insisted that Christ must be the principal subject of the curriculum, that the <span class="roman">Bible</span> must be the only authoritative book, and that all subjects should be studied in biblical words and phrases wherever possible. If teachers spoke Hebrew, Bampfield thought deaf people could learn to speak by observing the movements of the instructors' mouths and tongues. Such attention to education set Bampfield apart from most Seventh Day Baptists. In 1681 he also published his autobiography, <span class="italic">A Name, an After-one</span>, in which he compared himself to St Paul.<br>
<br>Bampfield again found himself in legal trouble when, on 13 February 1683, he was arrested while preaching at Pinners' Hall. He and some six of his congregation were taken before the lord mayor, who fined several of them &pound;10 before releasing them. A week later Bampfield was rearrested and incarcerated in Newgate prison, where he remained after refusing to take the oath of allegiance. His refusal stemmed from principled opposition to oaths, not hostility to the regime in general; although he knew something about the Monmouth cabal's consideration of a proposed insurrection through his contact with the printer Francis Smith, he did not endorse such action. When he again rejected the oath at his trial in the Old Bailey on 17 March the judge directed the jury to find him guilty, and on 28 March his chattels were forfeited and he was sentenced to imprisonment for life or during the king's pleasure. Bampfield published an account of these events in <span class="italic">The Lords Free Prisoner</span> (1683). Before Lord Chief Justice Edmund Saunders and three other judges he again rejected the oath on 18 April. He remained steadfast in further appearances at the Old Bailey on 12 and 13 October, and twice in January 1684, which he recounted in <span class="italic">A Just Appeal from Lower Courts</span> (1683) and <span class="italic">A Continuation of a Former Just Appeal</span> (1684). While in prison he also wrote <span class="italic">The Holy Scripture</span> (1684), in which he reiterated his call for schools to educate pupils in Hebrew and biblically based arts and sciences. He was also in communication with radical printers; in May 1683 he received a letter from Francis Smith which he was asked to forward to Mr Culliford, a printer with ties to the plotter Robert Ferguson. Bampfield passed the letter to Jane Curtis who, with her husband, Langley, printed dissident material. Aged seventy, Bampfield died in Newgate prison on 16 February 1684 and was buried three days later in the Baptists' graveyard in Glasshouse Yard, near Aldersgate Street. His wife survived him. Many nonconformists of varying persuasions attended his funeral, and several elegies, including <span class="italic">Counsel for the Living</span> and <span class="italic">An Elegy on that Special Messenger</span> (both 1684) commemorated his life. His religious pilgrimage had been one of the most extensive in seventeenth-century England, taking him from the conformists to the Seventh Day Baptists.<br>
<br>Francis Bampfield's brother Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1693), recorder of Exeter and MP (1654&#150;60; speaker in 1659), had embraced Seventh Day Baptist tenets by 1667, defending them in <span class="italic">A Reply to Doctor Wallis</span> (1693); he also wrote <span class="italic">An Enquiry whether the Lord Jesus Christ Made the World</span> (1692). The oldest brother, Sir John Bampfield (<i>c</i>.1610&#150;1650), served in the Long Parliament and the parliamentary army.<br>
