<span class="headword">Cameron,  Violet</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Violet Lydia Thompson]</span>  (1862&#150;1919), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 7 December 1862. The birth of a Violet Lydia Thompson, at 38 Argyle Street, St Pancras, London, the daughter of William Melfington Thompson, linen merchant, and his wife, Mary Josephine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Brougham, was registered for that date, though on her marriage certificate Violet gave her father's name as Frederick Thompson. She was the niece of the celebrated actress and dancer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36494/', "Lydia Thompson")</script>, who, with her husband Alexander Henderson, manager of the Comedy Theatre, played a major part in her upbringing. Violet made her stage d&eacute;but on 10 April 1871 as Karl in a revival of Dion Boucicault's <span class="italic">Faust and Marguerite</span>, with the veteran actor Samuel Phelps, at the Princess's Theatre. Such was her success that she obtained a three-year engagement for children's parts in the Drury Lane pantomime. In 1876 Miss Cameron (her stage name) appeared as Perdita in <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> in Liverpool, but when later asked why she did not &#145;go in&#146; for Shakespeare she replied, &#145;Oh, when one has a voice, I suppose it pays to cultivate that talent&#146;, recognizing that big salaries were then paid for &#145;opera bouffe&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 26 Aug 1893). In addition to her vocal gifts Violet Cameron was blessed with extremely blond hair, a fine figure, and of course the support of Lydia Thompson, with whom she appeared in burlesque and opera bouffe at the Folly (subsequently Toole's) Theatre. In 1878 she triumphed at the Folly as Germaine in <span class="italic">Les cloches de Corneville</span> by Henry Brougham Farnie and R. Reece, and she acknowledged her debt to Farnie, who, in his capacity as stage manager, helped her to &#145;work up&#146; these pieces.<br>
<br>It was at the Gaiety Theatre on 14 October 1882 that Violet Cameron scored a tremendous personal success in the dual role of Gretchen and Alice in Farnie's treatment of Robert Planquette's light opera <span class="italic">Rip Van Winkle</span>. The cast included Fred Leslie, Frederick Storey, W. S. Penley, and Lionel Brough. Following further success in <span class="italic">Falka</span> in October 1883 Cameron left the stage. On 20 September 1884, at the register office in the district of St George, Hanover Square, she married David de Bensaude, a native Moroccan of Spanish descent and a tea taster by trade. They had one child, probably born in 1885. In that year Cameron reappeared on stage with Lionel Brough in Audran's <span class="italic">La mascotte</span>, the play with which Alexander Henderson opened the Comedy Theatre: it enjoyed an enormous success and established opera bouffe at the Comedy for some time.<br>
<br>In 1886 Cameron and her husband were befriended by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34613/', "Hugh Cecil Lowther, fifth earl of Lonsdale (1857&#150;1944)")</script>, who offered to finance their plan to take a theatre company to America that autumn. Lonsdale was an old acquaintance of Cameron's and the attention that he paid to her soon aroused the resentment and suspicion of her husband. In July 1886 she sought a judicial separation from Bensaude on the grounds of his violent and threatening language, while he in turn sought a divorce on the ground of her alleged adultery with Lonsdale. On 30 July there was an altercation between the two men at Newcastle, and Lonsdale was fined for assault. The following month the weekly paper <span class="italic">The Umpire</span> published an interview with Lonsdale that, in the words of the judge who presided over the subsequent libel case, depicted Bensaude as &#145;a thief, a liar, and a drunkard, and as having sponged on his wife's earnings and pawned her jewellery&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 23 May 1887). Bensaude won damages for this &#145;atrocious&#146; libel.<br>
<br>In these fraught circumstances the planned American tour went ahead, with Lonsdale in attendance as business manager. The production of the musical plays <span class="italic">Kenilworth</span> and <span class="italic">The Commodore</span> was judged a success, but further scandalous stories about Bensaude, Cameron, and Lonsdale crossed the Atlantic and appeared in the British press. Husband and wife were by now totally estranged and in July 1887 the parties reached an agreement whereby Bensaude signed a separation deed and withdrew divorce proceedings in return for a settlement of &pound;750. He soon renounced this agreement, however, after discovering that in May 1887 his wife had given birth to a daughter, of whom Lord Lonsdale was the father. Cameron's counsel subsequently admitted that there had after all been &#145;immoral relations&#146; between the actress and the earl, but it was also claimed that Bensaude had known of all of the circumstances, including the illegitimate child, before signing the separation deed, and that he was motivated purely by money  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 Nov 1887). The scandal obliged Lonsdale to leave London for a time&#151;in February 1888 he set off on a lengthy expedition to the Canadian Arctic&#151;while Bensaude, who was prevented by the courts from further confronting his wife, faded into a background of indigence, living in rented rooms in London. He died some time before his wife, whom he never divorced.<br>
<br>The scandal seems hardly to have affected Cameron's career. On her return from America, she performed in Alfred Cellier's comic opera <span class="italic">The Sultan of Mocha</span> at the Strand Theatre (21 September 1887). This was followed by several successes culminating in Alan-a-Dale in <span class="italic">Maid Marian</span> at the Prince of Wales (5 February 1891), after which she left the stage for two years. Asked whether she preferred appearing as a boy or a girl Cameron replied emphatically the latter, explaining that &#145;it was Mr Farnie who used to insist on casting her for boys' parts, because he thought she was rarely gifted therefor in figure and deportment&#146;, a view from which her many admirers did not dissent  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 26 Aug 1893). In 1893 Violet Cameron caught public taste in <span class="italic">Morocco Bound</span>, a musical farce by Arthur Branscombe which enjoyed great success at the Shaftesbury Theatre (13 April). Thereafter her stage appearances were few. She returned to Drury Lane in January 1901 to take over as principal boy in <span class="italic">Jack and the Beanstalk</span> making &#145;a comely figure in her handsome costumes &hellip; all she does in a part, that cannot be said to help her much, bears the mark of refinement, and her singing is as bright and cultural as ever&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Stage</span>, 30 Oct 1919).<br>
<br>Violet Cameron's last performance was as the Abbess (Mother Superior) in Henry Hamilton's and Paul Potter's musical play <span class="italic">The School Girl</span> at the Prince of Wales's Theatre (9 May 1903). She died after a short illness at Holindale, Madeira Avenue, Worthing, Sussex, on 25 October 1919, and was buried on 30 October at Broadwater cemetery, Worthing. Though only fifty-six when she died, she had long since departed from the London stage: she was admiringly recalled by a diminishing few who had witnessed her brilliant though intermittent career in comic opera and opera bouffe.<br>
