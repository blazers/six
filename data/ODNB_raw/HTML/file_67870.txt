<span class="headword">Grimes,  William Francis</span>  (1905&#150;1988), <span class="occ">archaeologist</span>, was born on 31 October 1905 at Glyn House, Woodbine Terrace, Pembroke, the eldest son of four children of Thomas George Grimes, a draughtsman who worked for the Pembroke Docks Board, and his wife, Edith May Williams. His parents were both Welsh. Grimes was educated at Pembroke county school&#151;where apparently his love for archaeology was first kindled by a teacher&#151;and, after his father moved to Bedford to work on airships, subsequently at Bedford modern school.<br>
<br>Grimes returned to Wales to read Latin at the University College of Wales, Cardiff, graduating in 1926 with first-class honours. Characteristically he went straight from his graduation ceremony to the National Museum of Wales, where he took up office as assistant keeper of archaeology. He worked under the newly appointed keeper of archaeology, V. E. Nash-Williams, who had himself just replaced Cyril Fox, who had been appointed director to succeed Mortimer Wheeler after his move to the London Museum. At the National Museum Grimes studied the material from the Roman pottery works at Holt, Denbighshire. For this work he was awarded the degree of MA by the University of Wales in 1930; it was published as <span class="italic">Holt, Denbighshire: the Works Depot of the Twentieth Legion at Castle Lyons</span> (1930). In spite of this research, stemming in part from his classical training, Grimes's main interest was in the prehistory of Wales and he regularly published on this topic in <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span> and the <span class="italic">Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies</span>; he also provided summaries for the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society</span>.<br>
<br>In recognition of this work Grimes was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on St David's day 1934, and was admitted the following week when he travelled to London to hear the Wheelers give a lecture on their excavations at Verulamium. In 1939 the National Museum of Wales published Grimes's <span class="italic">Guide to the Collection Illustrating the Prehistory of Wales</span>. In 1949 this was to win him the G. T. Clark prize, awarded for research on the archaeology of Wales and the marches; Professor V. Gordon Childe was the assessor for the prehistory section. This work was republished in 1951, with a second edition in 1959, as <span class="italic">The Prehistory of Wales</span>.<br>
<br>In 1928 Grimes married Barbara Lilian Morgan (1905&#150;<i>c</i>.1961), whom he had known in his boyhood in Pembroke. There were two children, Rosemary and Roger. In 1935, to celebrate the centenary of the Royal Institution of South Wales in Swansea, Grimes helped to mount a special exhibition in the antiquities department. It was during these visits that he met his future wife, Mrs Audrey Williams (1902&#150;1978), who had read English at Somerville College in Oxford, and who was then honorary assistant and later honorary secretary and curator of the Royal Institution. Audrey, who was active in excavating a number of prehistoric sites on the Gower peninsula, was to become a close family friend, and she was to work with Grimes on a number of excavations including those at the Dan-yr-Ogof caves at the head of the Swansea valley. Grimes always acknowledged Audrey as the better excavator.<br>
<br>It was Grimes's skill as an excavator that led to his appointment as an assistant archaeology officer to the Ordnance Survey in Southampton. He took up the position in October 1938, and was to work alongside O. G. S. Crawford. Grimes edited a collection of essays, <span class="italic">Aspects of Archaeology in Britain and Beyond</span>, in Crawford's honour (1951). Both Crawford and Grimes responded to the call for help when the Sutton Hoo ship burial was discovered in Suffolk in the early summer of 1939. A contemporary report noted that Grimes's &#145;work in dissecting and removing the majority of the buried deposits was invaluable&#146;  (<span class="italic">Antiquaries Journal</span>, 20, 1940, 192).<br>
<br>With the outbreak of war, Grimes was seconded to the Ministry of Works to excavate in advance of the construction of defence sites. Audrey Williams was one of his colleagues through the war years. This &#145;rescue&#146; archaeological fieldwork took Grimes round Britain, and it was noted that he was &#145;continuously in the field without more than one week free at any time between excavations&#146;  (B. H. St J. O'Neil, &#145;War and archaeology in Britain&#146;, <span class="italic">Antiquaries Journal</span>, 28, 1948, 23). One of these wartime excavations was at Heathrow, where he uncovered an Iron Age religious site.<br>
<br>Grimes had a strong vision of the role of museums in post-war Britain, presenting his views in <span class="italic">Antiquity</span> (1944). In 1945 he was appointed director of the London Museum, succeeding Mortimer Wheeler. The blitz had wrought considerable damage to the heart of the capital, and in 1946 Grimes was appointed honorary director of excavations for the Roman and Medieval London excavation council. As a result of this work, Grimes was granted freedom of the City of London in 1952, and was made a CBE in 1955. The excavation which captured the public's imagination was the discovery of a Roman temple of Mithras at Walbrook in 1954. This work had been conducted with Audrey Williams, who had joined the staff of the Verulamium Museum after the war. Grimes also excavated on the site of a number of City churches including St Bride's, Fleet Street.<br>
<br>In 1956 Grimes was appointed director of the Institute of Archaeology and professor of archaeology in the University of London as successor to V. Gordon Childe. Childe vacated the chair early to allow his successor to oversee the move of the institute to Gordon Square; he had in fact revealed to Grimes his intention to commit suicide. In 1959 Grimes's marriage was dissolved, and he married Audrey Williams, who had in the mean time remarried and become divorced.<br>
<br>In spite of his move to London, Grimes retained strong links with Wales, serving as president of the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1963&#150;4. In 1961 he was awarded an honorary degree of DLitt from the University of Wales, based on a portfolio of published work on the archaeology of Wales with special reference to prehistoric burial monuments. Further recognition was made by his appointment as an honorary professorial fellow of the University College of Swansea (1975), and his election as fellow of the University College of Cardiff (1981). Grimes was a member of the royal commissions on the ancient monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire (1948&#150;78), and on historical monuments (England) (1964&#150;78). He was also actively involved with numerous national archaeological societies and organizations, such as the Society of Antiquaries, the Royal Archaeological Institute, and the Council for British Archaeology. On Grimes's retirement, Lord Fletcher commented, &#145;it has become almost trite to observe that no committee on an archaeological subject is complete unless graced with the presence of Professor Grimes&#146;  (D. E. Strong, ed., <span class="italic">Archaeological Theory and Practice: Essays Presented to Professor William Francis Grimes</span>, 1973, x). This was especially true of his commitment to amateur local societies; particular mention should be made of his work with the field studies centre at Dale in Pembrokeshire.<br>
<br>Grimes was a skilled artist and draughtsman. He was an accomplished violinist as a student at Cardiff, although he ceased to play upon graduation in case it distracted him from his archaeology. He was known by his nickname, Peter, which had been applied to him by Audrey. As a young man he had flaming red hair, and in later life he invariably sported a red carnation in the lapel of his jacket. Ralph Merrifield remembered Grimes as &#145;single-minded and conscientious in his pursuit of truth, with a preference for solving problems by orderly, logical steps, and a distrust of hypotheses that had not been thoroughly tested&#146;  (Merrifield, 278).<br>
<br>Grimes retired in 1973 to Swansea, living in Audrey's house in Brynmill. Audrey died in Aberystwyth in 1978, immediately prior to the presentation to Grimes on his retirement from the royal commission. In 1980 Grimes married his third wife, Mrs Molly Waverley Sholto Douglas (<i>b</i>. 1926), a friend since his retirement to Swansea. In the final two years of his life he became increasingly disabled by Parkinson's disease, dying at his home, 29 Bryn Road, Brynmill, Swansea, on Christmas day 1988. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered, like those of his beloved Audrey's, at Pwlldu Bay at the foot of the Bishopston valley on the Gower peninsula.<br>
