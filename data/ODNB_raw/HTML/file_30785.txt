<span class="headword">Baker, Sir  George Gillespie</span>  (1910&#150;1984), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born in Stirling on 25 April 1910, the only child of Captain John Kilgour Baker, of Stirling, and his wife, Jane Gillespie. Baker's mother, whom he did not remember, died in 1914. His father, a captain in the Cameron Highlanders, was killed in 1918. He had remarried shortly before his death. Baker's upbringing thus became the task of relatives who, though devoted, were unable to afford him the advantages of normal family life. His childhood was lonely. This gave him a lasting sensitivity to the needs of children, a quality which served him well in later years when it became his lot to deal with the child casualties of broken marriages. He was in due course sent to Glasgow Academy and thence to Strathallan School in Perthshire. For his further education he moved south to Oxford, but he retained throughout his life a gentle Scottish accent which led to his nickname of Scottie. He became a senior Hulme scholar at Brasenose College and a pupil of the redoubtable W. T. S. Stallybrass, later principal of Brasenose. He obtained a first class in jurisprudence (1930) and a second class in the BCL (1931). He attempted but failed to obtain a fellowship at All Souls.<br>
<br>Baker had always wanted a career at the bar. He joined the Middle Temple, of which he was elected a Harmsworth scholar, and was called to the bar in 1932. His resources other than his own abilities were limited. Work in London was then scarce. He joined the Oxford circuit and there sought and gradually acquired a small, good general practice.<br>
<br>But, as with those of almost all his generation, Baker's prospects of steady professional advancement were shattered in 1939 by the outbreak of war. Baker, though by this time married and a father, at once volunteered and joined the Royal West Kent regiment as a private. He was later commissioned into the Cameronians. He served successively in Africa, Italy, and Germany, his services winning him a military OBE in 1945. After an unsuccessful foray into politics as Conservative candidate for Southall in the 1945 election and a short spell of service at Nuremberg on the British War Crimes Executive, he returned to the uncertainties of post-war practice at the bar, by this time the father of three sons. His determination never faltered. His work returned and indeed increased so rapidly, again largely on circuit, that he was well justified in taking silk in 1952. Two small recorderships had already come his way: Bridgnorth and Smethwick. Then in 1952 he became recorder of Wolverhampton, an important appointment.<br>
<br>In 1954 Baker was elected leader of the Oxford circuit, a post which he greatly valued, discharged with great tact and skill, and held until his appointment to the High Court bench in 1961, when he was knighted. By that time his judicial qualities had manifested themselves not only in his recorderships but in his chairmanships of successive government committees between 1956 and 1961. His practice had lain mainly in the fields of criminal and general common-law work. He had done some but not a great deal of divorce work. His appointment to the High Court bench came as no surprise, but his assignment to the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division did. His qualities, thus already manifested, soon justified the appointment. He was patient, courteous, sensitive, and above all decisive. But, as with many of his judicial contemporaries in that division, he found the state of the law cruel and the hard-fought, bitter, defended divorce cases of the time exceedingly unattractive. He welcomed the changes in the law of divorce in 1969, especially the abolition of the concept of matrimonial offence. He also welcomed the changes made in 1970 regarding the redistribution of matrimonial property on divorce. Little did he then realize that it would fall to him as president of the newly created Family Division to secure the smooth transition from the old law to the new.<br>
<br>Baker's appointment to that post in 1971 came more as a surprise to him than to his friends, though there were other contenders. At the same time he was sworn of the privy council. He proved a superb administrator and with the support of a younger generation of judges soon welded the new division into an effective and efficient unit. Though technically he had no control over divorce work done in the county courts, the deep respect which he commanded enabled him to improve their efficiency. He, like others, was disappointed in his ambition to see the creation of a unified family court and also by the bitterness with which disputes over custody, access, and the division of matrimonial property continued to be conducted.<br>
<br>Baker retired in 1979, giving tiredness as his reason. That this was true was not surprising. He in fact retired to nurse his wife, Jessie Raphael McCall, whom he had married on 30 August 1935, and to whom he showed lasting devotion. She was the daughter of Thomas Scott Findlay, nurseryman, of Glasgow. The marriage was one of great happiness and produced three sons (one of whom became a High Court judge). Baker was deeply devoted to his children and grandchildren. The breakdown in his wife's health some years before his retirement laid a great and continuous burden on him until her death in 1983. Thereafter he sought to mitigate his loneliness by accepting a government invitation to investigate the operation of the emergency laws in Northern Ireland, a task not without danger to himself but which he discharged with characteristic thoroughness, courageously criticizing some aspects of that policy.<br>
<br>Baker's deep personal integrity was founded on his staunch Presbyterian faith. He sometimes seemed shy and diffident, but was a profoundly kind man. Amid all his activities he found time for innumerable interests outside the law, especially in the field of education. His college made him an honorary fellow in 1966. He became a governor of Strathallan School, of Epsom College, and of Wycombe Abbey. He was an active bencher (1961) of the Middle Temple and was appointed treasurer in 1976. His recreations included golf and latterly fishing. But the heavy burdens he had carried for so long eventually took their toll. Early in June 1984 he suffered a stroke and he died on 13 June 1984 at Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex.<br>
