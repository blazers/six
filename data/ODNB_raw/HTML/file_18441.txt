<span class="headword">Mayne,  Jasper</span>  (1604&#150;1672), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was born in Hatherleigh, Devon, in November 1604, and baptized in the parish church there on 23 November, the fourth of five children of Jasper Maine and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1632). Cuthbert Mayne, the Roman Catholic seminary priest executed in 1577, came from Youlston, about 10 miles away, but Jasper Mayne's family cannot definitely be connected to the martyr. However, the Hatherleigh Maynes were local prominent Roman Catholic gentry, their once considerable property gradually wasted away by recusancy fines during the first half of the seventeenth century. By 1648 Jasper's eldest brother, John, suffered sequestration of the family's estate and was listed with other Devon papists as &#145;delinquent, notorious, poor&#146;  (Abell, 260).<br>
<br>Mayne himself conformed, if not when he was admitted to Westminster School, at least in 1623 when he proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, as a servitor. When he matriculated on 10 October 1624 it was as a student: his election that year was for him the defining achievement of his career; ever after his signature was &#145;Jasper Mayne, Student&#146;. He graduated BA on 21 October 1628 and proceeded MA on 18 June 1631. Favoured by deans Richard Corbett and (from 1628) Brian Duppa, he became &#145;a quaint preacher and a noted poet&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.971). Among his contemporaries at both Westminster and Christ Church were the poet Thomas Randolph, John Donne the younger (son of the dean of St Paul's), and the poet William Cartwright, with whom Mayne joined in an effort to retain threatened privileges traditionally enjoyed by Westminster scholars at Christ Church, the Westminster suppers. With Cartwright and others Mayne also contributed his earliest poems to collections of Latin and English commemorative verse instigated by Corbett and Duppa, verses chiefly composed on various occasions in the lives of the royal family. In such trivial academic flattery Mayne showed himself no worse and sometimes better than other contributors.<br>
<br>Mayne applied his poetic talent to much better effect in several commendatory poems contributed to editions of poetry by some of the finest English writers of his time. Earliest among these was &#145;On Worthy Master Shakespeare and his Poems&#146;, prefaced to the second folio edition of the plays (1632), in which Mayne, with critical originality, praised the playwright for his ability to make ancient and medieval history vibrant on the stage. Mayne also wrote &#145;On Dr. Donne's Death&#146; for the 1633 edition of John Donne's <span class="italic">Poems</span>. Here Mayne recalled being present when Donne preached, contrasting Donne's sermons to those of puritan divines. &#145;To the Memory of Ben. Jonson&#146; was Mayne's contribution to <span class="italic">Jonsonus virbius</span>, the 1638 collection of poems by various hands published after Jonson's death. Mayne praised the runic toughness of Jonson's poetry, faithful to classical models. In all three poems Mayne honoured his subjects with discriminating parody of each characteristic style, a wit of imitation combining poetic skill with critical acumen. Mayne's reputation as a poet is virtually nil; he has been best known for his plays, which are amusing. His more noteworthy poems and translations, rarely republished, have on insufficient grounds been slighted, ignored as misattributions, or branded as forgeries. But if some of his work was mediocre, Mayne was capable and did on several occasions rise to first-rate poetry.<br>
<br>Diversifying his literary production, in 1639 Mayne published (anonymously) his play <span class="italic">The Citye Match</span>, which had been performed before the king and queen at Whitehall the same year. His translation of some dialogues of Lucian in 1638, under the patronage of William Cavendish, earl of Newcastle, remained unpublished for years, Newcastle having turned from patronage of the arts to defence of the monarchy in the civil war. It was eventually published in 1664, dedicated to Cavendish as, by then, duke of Newcastle. Mayne also preached a Good Friday sermon at Christ Church in 1638, evidently without sufficient regard to royal regulations, an offence for which he submitted to censure by Archbishop William Laud, chancellor of the university.<br>
<br>In 1639 Mayne succeeded Richard Corbett as vicar of Cassington, a Christ Church benefice near Oxford, and on 1 or 2 November 1642 he proceeded BD. He continued to publish occasional poems in Oxford collections of commemorative verse through the 1640s, but the circumstances of civil war gradually prompted his withdrawal from literary pursuits to take part in ideological struggle for the cause of royalism. Following the king's arrival in the city in October 1642 and the setting up of his headquarters at Christ Church, Oxford became a garrison. It is not clear whether, like his fellow student Cartwright, Mayne formed part of the band of &#145;loyal schollers&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 1.55) who took up training in arms for the defence of the university, but he certainly engaged in the propaganda war. Having proceeded DD on 17 June 1646 during the last weeks of royalist occupation, following the city's surrender to the parliamentarian army Mayne preached &#145;shortly after&#146; at St Mary's <span class="italic">A Sermon Against False Prophets</span> (not published until 1647) and on 9 August at Carfax church <span class="italic">A Sermon Concerning Unity and Agreement</span> (1646); peacemaking was the avowed intent of his other publication of that year, <span class="italic">The Difference about Church Government Ended</span>, which argued for civil rather than ecclesiastical governance of the church. <span class="italic">Ochlo-machia, or, The Peoples War</span> (1647) opposed the taking up of arms against the king.<br>
<br>Having failed to answer a summons to appear before the parliamentary visitors to the university in May 1648, Mayne abandoned Oxford and Cassington for a second Christ Church living at Pyrton, given to him just two months previously. In November he was expelled from his scholarship at Christ Church. While living at Pyrton, Mayne again anonymously published a play&#151;<span class="italic">The Amorous Warre</span> (1648), a very complicated piece of plotting that apparently was never produced on the stage. In 1651 he published another of his commemorative elegies on deceased poets, this time for a posthumous edition of Cartwright's poetry. &#145;To the deceased author of these poems&#146; is as much an elegy for Mayne's own career in literature as for Cartwright, who emerges here the lamented embodiment of Mayne's aspirations as a poet, scholar, and preacher. The desolation Mayne felt, surrounded by the evident demise of his own war-torn career, is here assimilated to his grief for Cartwright.<br>
<br>In 1652 Mayne was ejected from his Cassington living. His predicament under the Commonwealth is illustrated by an incident when, about this time, he engaged in a futile disputation at nearby Watlington parish. Wood records that one <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21830/', "John Pendarves")</script>, whom he describes as an Anabaptist &#145;preaching in houses, barns, under trees, hedges, &amp;c.&#146;, but who was at that time actually vicar of St Helen's, Abingdon and minister of Wantage, had provoked Mayne to preach at Watlington to a largely hostile congregation. Mayne's eloquent and learned sermon addressed the needs of that small portion of the auditory who felt inundated by the followers of Pendarves and craved the traditional ministrations of the Church of England. However, the sermon was brutally interrupted, Wood alleged, by &#145;a great party of anabaptists and the scum of the people&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.419). Mayne published his full text as <span class="italic">A Sermon Against Schisme, or, The Separations of these Times</span> (1652); preached in the style of Cartwright and Donne it bemoaned the losses for English society caused by the civil war. The same year he also published his translations of Donne's Latin epigrams in a volume of Donne's fugitive prose and poetry edited by Mayne's college friend John Donne the younger. The Latin epigrams seem to have been translated earlier, probably before 1632, although no earlier edition of the poems is extant. Since the original Latin poems have been lost, Mayne's translations constitute the only surviving record of Donne's earliest work as a poet.<br>
<br>In 1653 Mayne published <span class="italic">Certaine sermons and letters of defence and resolution, to some of the late controversies of our times</span> and wrote a prose letter to preface Richard Whitlock's <span class="italic">Zootomia, or, Observations on the Present Manners of the English</span>, published in 1654. In his letter he explained why he could no longer muster commendatory verse: &#145;the <i>Rudeness</i> of the <i>place</i> where I dwell, and my weekly <i>Thoughts</i> compelled to <i>size themselves</i> to a plain <i>Countrey Congregation</i>, have abated much of that <i>Fancie</i> which should do honour, either to your <i>Book</i> or my self&#146;. He went on to complain in addition that &#145;all my <i>publike Poetry</i> hath and still is, <i>objected</i> to me as a piece of <i>Lightnesse</i>, not befitting the <i>Profession</i> or <i>Degree</i> of&#146; a clergyman  (R. Whitlock, <span class="italic">Zootomia</span>, 1654, sig. A4<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Finally deprived of his Pyrton living, before 21 May 1656, Mayne retreated to Chatsworth, the estate of a second William Cavendish, third earl of Devonshire, where he served as a chaplain and renewed his old acquaintance with the earl's secretary, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes. According to Wood, &#145;between them there never was a right understanding&#146;, presumably in theological if not in political discussions  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 3.972).<br>
<br>At the Restoration in 1660 Mayne was reinstated in his college benefices at Cassington and Pyrton and was also appointed canon of Christ Church Cathedral, archdeacon of Chichester, and a chaplain-in-ordinary to the king, in which capacity he preached at the consecration of Herbert Croft as bishop of Hereford a sermon which was later published. He could never reconcile himself to the changes a decade of parliamentary domination had brought to Oxford. In <span class="italic">Concio ad academiam Oxoniensem</span>, preached on 27 May 1662, he blasted the faculty as dull, leaden politicians: &#145;&#147;<i>plumbeos aldermannos</i>&#148; and &#147;<i>aldermannos plumbeos</i>&#148; all one&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Times of Anthony Wood</span>, 1.441). Nevertheless he supported the activities of students, such as a play of 1664 after which the actors seem to have caroused excessively with the encouragement of Mayne and some other dons. According to Wood &#145;Dr. Mayne spoke them a speech commending them for their ingenuity, and told them he liked well an acting student&#146;  (ibid., 2.2).<br>
<br>Mayne now became a rich man, and contributed money for restoring a building at Christ Church. At his death in Oxford, unmarried, on 6 December 1672 he willed a large sum for the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral and additional bequests to the poor people of his parishes at Cassington and Pyrton, but he left nothing to Christ Church, whose atmosphere and administration on the whole he had come to find offensive. A related gesture perhaps was Mayne's promise to one of his servants at the college of &#145;<i>Somewhat</i> (as he said) <i>that would make him Drink after his Death</i>&#146;  (Langbaine, 338). The bequest turned out to be a salted herring (not mentioned in the will). Mayne was buried in Christ Church Cathedral.<br>
