<span class="headword">Cameron, Sir  James Clark</span>  (1905&#150;1991), <span class="occ">general practitioner and medical administrator</span>, was born on 8 April 1905 at Bridge of Earn, Perthshire, Scotland, the only son and elder child of Malcolm Clark Cameron (1872&#150;1917), police officer, and his wife, Grace (1879&#150;1963), seamstress, daughter of James Clark and his wife, Isabella, <i>n&eacute;e</i> MacArthur of Aberfeldy. The family had roots in Rannoch, Perthshire.<h2>
<a name="Earlyexperiencesasdoctorandprisonerofwar"></a>Early experiences as doctor and prisoner of war</h2>Cameron was educated at Glencarse School, Acharn School (near Kenmore), Breadalbane Academy, and Perth Academy. Leaving school in 1923 he took a gap year working in a pharmacy, an experience which persuaded him to study medicine. He then attended University College, Dundee (then part of St Andrews University), graduating MB and ChB in 1929. This was followed by a hospital residency in Arbroath.<br>
<br>Like many of Scotland's medical graduates Cameron migrated south after qualification. Settling in general practice in Croydon in 1931 he proved a popular doctor and soon opened a second surgery in his home, near Wallington. This early expansion in a flourishing London suburb no doubt prompted his subsequent advice to aspiring general practitioners, quoted by a local colleague Trevor Silver: &#145;Always count the chimney pots before setting up your plate&#146;  (Silver, 1131). On 25 February 1933 he married Irene Ferguson (1905&#150;1986), daughter of Arthur Ferguson of Perth, an Edinburgh graduate who, until her death, provided staunch support. He was deeply attached to her and to their three children: Hamish, who became a consultant child psychiatrist; Sheila, who became a QC; and Jennifer, who became a magistrate.<br>
<br>Cameron's group practice in Wallington remained his professional base for forty-five years, and throughout his post-war career in medico-politics he maintained this strong clinical foundation, holding large Saturday surgeries to compensate for the hours spent in weekday committees. He kept close links with local colleagues, successfully chairing the south-west London and Surrey local medical committee. A firm believer in democracy, Cameron practised it assiduously throughout two decades of representing doctors. Indeed, his chairmanship of local and national committees was sometimes marked by a surfeit of democracy as he allowed fractious colleagues to talk themselves out in his pursuit of an agreed solution to a controversial problem. On occasions he displayed a Nelsonian disregard for an inquorate meeting, and some of his most effective work was done when subsequently socializing late into the night with committee members after formal proceedings had ended.<br>
<br>Cameron had joined the Officers' Training Corps at university, and in 1939 was commissioned into the Territorial Army. By the spring of 1940 he was a battalion medical officer in the King's Royal Rifle Brigade. His unit was deployed to hold Calais against the advancing Germans, to give time for the British expeditionary force's evacuation to England from nearby Dunkirk. His gallantry in this fierce battle, during which, under fire, he amputated a wounded soldier's forearm with a rusty hacksaw, earned him a mention in dispatches. He was, inevitably, captured and sent to Stalag Luft 21 in Germany. There, as well as caring for many nationalities in the prison's hospital, he worked hard to maintain prisoners' morale, organizing camp shows, taking church services, learning German, and negotiating on the prisoners' behalf with the camp authorities. Such was his command of German and ability to represent prisoners' interests that on one occasion the authorities locked him up as a suspected spy. In October 1944 he was moved to a camp in Poland with American prisoners of war. From there he wrote home: &#145;Everyone is very optimistic &hellip; but I have given up prophesying&#146;  (private information, J. Isaacs). This was an understandable sentiment after five years of incarceration.<br>
<br>Cameron later remained reticent about his wartime experiences, which ended with his leading a gruelling trek of fellow prisoners to Odessa after their release by the Russian army. Certainly, the years in camps coloured the remainder of his life, although fortunately his natural affability, gregariousness, and common sense survived intact. He kept in touch with former comrades, but an enduring hatred of his captors was manifest over twenty years later when he refused to enter a car hired to take him to negotiations in Whitehall because it was a Mercedes. A positive outcome of his camp experiences was his abiding support for the Red Cross, with which he had worked when organizing the repatriation of sick prisoners. Back in general practice he regularly lectured Red Cross volunteers, and in 1958 was awarded the organization's badge of honour and was made a life member.<h2>
<a name="NegotiatorfortheBritishMedicalAssociation"></a>Negotiator for the British Medical Association</h2>As well as great stamina Cameron had a well disguised inner toughness, products, no doubt, of his strict Presbyterian upbringing and the war. These traits were coupled with a shrewd intelligence, an unusual empathy with people, a remarkable memory, and the ability to identify the sentence that mattered in a mass of text. It was no surprise that he became a skilful negotiator as well as an effective family doctor. One quirk for such a successful medico-politician was a reluctance to put pen to paper: listening and talking were his strengths. He could, however, be an uncompromising opponent of anyone he believed had let him down; nor did he suffer fools gladly, though his kindness to friends and to the British Medical Association (BMA) staff was legendary.<br>
<br>A champion of principles he held dear, Cameron's belief in and deep anxieties about general practice in the National Health Service (NHS) prompted his entry into medico-politics in the early years of the service. &#145;I came back from five years in a prisoner of war camp to find general practice in a mess and my gut feeling was that it was a branch of medicine with no future&#146;  (Macpherson, 26). It was Cameron's determination to help revive general practice&#151;for the benefit of patients as well as doctors&#151;rather than any desire for personal aggrandizement that motivated his medico-political activities.<br>
<br>In 1956 Cameron was elected to the BMA's general medical services committee, which represented nearly all family doctors via a network of active local committees, and on 19 March 1964&#151;when still relatively unknown outside the BMA&#151;he was elected its chairman. A modest man, he was as surprised as many others when he beat the two fancied, high-profile candidates in what was an unexpected election for the chair. The committee's previous chairman, A. B. Davies, had resigned following an angry national conference of representatives of general practitioners (GPs) which had castigated the committee's proposed evidence for a pay rise to the doctors' and dentists' independent pay review body. As someone who epitomized the value of patients having a personal doctor, Cameron was to prove an ideal leader for Britain's family doctors. In the period after his election he judged the main hope for general practice to be with the government-initiated Fraser inquiry. This was, however, overtaken by events in February 1965, when the review body recommended &#145;such a tiny pay award that GPs exploded&#146;  (Timmins, 220). Cameron's abilities were tested to their limits at local and national meetings where he and his committee colleagues struggled to channel doctors' anger into a constructive policy.<br>
<br>The task was formidable. As well as having to persuade a financially beleaguered government to accept potentially expensive reforms, Cameron had to combat militant rival GP organizations and unite general practitioners, many of whom hankered nostalgically for pre-NHS practice and fees for items of service in place of remuneration based on patient list size&#151;a change that the government deemed non-negotiable. As general medical services committee chairman, however, Cameron was determined also to improve standards of training and practice, a necessary quid pro quo for better pay and conditions of service. Furthermore, more well qualified recruits were needed urgently to offset a debilitating loss of disillusioned, experienced doctors from the NHS. The level of anger among family doctors was such that in February 1965 the BMA decided to collect GPs' undated resignations from the NHS, for possible use later. An overwhelming majority responded and, whatever personal reservations Cameron may have had about industrial action by doctors, he recognized the <i>realpolitik</i> of the situation. As the committee chairman he had both to placate alarmed consultants' leaders, fearful that hospitals would be overwhelmed, and to persuade an angry minister of health, Kenneth Robinson, to stay at the negotiating table.<br>
<br>Drawing on many professional and governmental sources, including ideas from the progressive Royal College of General Practitioners (of which he was later elected an honorary fellow) and the Medical Practitioners Union, Cameron and his negotiating team of elected GPs and BMA secretariat staff set out to turn the crisis to the advantage of patients and doctors. He never pretended to be an original thinker, but he could spot a good idea, and he had the leadership qualities to weld a group of informed, independent, often prickly individuals into an effective team. The negotiators' proposals, <span class="italic">A Charter for the Family Doctor Service</span>, hammered out during a hectic weekend in Brighton in February 1965, were the basis of negotiations with the government. Robinson, the minister of health and the son of a family doctor, recognized the parlous state of general practice and the risk this posed for the NHS, and saw in Cameron someone with whom he could deal. Their mutual empathy&#151;and willingness to communicate informally to test their respective positions&#151;contributed to resolving the crisis. Indeed, Cameron sometimes had more trouble with militants in the profession than with the minister and his civil service team. Interestingly, Robinson admitted privately many years later that the net loss of 600 GPs from the NHS in 1963&#150;4 worried him more than the threat of mass resignations or the BMA's attempt to launch an insurance-based scheme for general practice. For his part Cameron saw the resignation threat as being as much a safety valve for the profession as a credible weapon in negotiations.<br>
<br>Cameron, &#145;a dead straight but artful Scot&#146;  (Timmins, 220), handled acrimonious professional meetings and intense negotiations with skill, courtesy, and determination. &#145;When rarely and deliberately, he was terse, the result was dramatically effective&#146;  (Gullick). Certainly, when necessary he faced down the profession's militants, and on one occasion refused to accept a ministerial letter. Many months of tense and complex negotiations finally resulted in 1966 in Cameron and Robinson agreeing a vastly improved contract. Timmins later wrote: &#145;The deal not only stopped the rot. It produced a renaissance in general practice&#146;  (Timmins, 223). Cameron would surely have been proud of this judgement.<br>
<br>After the agreement was implemented Cameron wanted to resign as chairman of the general medical services committee, but members asked him to stay on. So, despite illness, he led Britain's GPs for ten years, until a serious operation obliged him to resign in 1974. During that time he contributed greatly to the development of postgraduate education for family doctors. GPs honoured him by naming a charity for GPs and their families after him. The money came from a government-held practice compensation fund set up in 1948, and his memory of a ministerial chance remark, made seven years earlier, secured the return of the money to the profession. The committee made him its only life member on his retirement. He was appointed CBE in 1974, and in 1975 the BMA awarded him its gold medal for distinguished merit.<h2>
<a name="ChairmanoftheBMAcouncil"></a>Chairman of the BMA council</h2>In 1971 Cameron had failed by one vote to get elected chairman of the BMA council. The defeat hit him hard, even though the result may have been in part because the previous chairman had been a general practitioner, and members wanted a consultant. Restored to health by 1976 he was elected to the chair of the BMA council in that year, serving until 1979, the year in which he was knighted for services to medicine.<br>
<br>Cameron's three years as council chairman were not as memorable as his time with the general medical services committee. The NHS was, with difficulty, trying to cope with the consequences of reorganization, a lack of resources, and rising militancy among its staff, including senior and junior doctors. Cameron wanted fundamental change in the NHS to prevent its recurring crises. He did not, however, have the empathy with the diverse medical groupings on the council that he had enjoyed with his GP colleagues on the general medical services committee. In any case the medico-political issues were complex and messy, without the intense focus of the GP contract crisis. They were not susceptible to fundamental solutions, at least not under the existing Labour administration. In addition, the BMA secretariat, upon whom Cameron had relied heavily during the 1960s, was under strain, struggling to respond to BMA members' &#145;union&#146; needs without damaging the association's professional role. Organizational reform was not the chairman's forte, and the intraprofessional stresses within the association taxed even his patience: late-night convivial socializing was no longer the effective problem-solver that it had been in the 1960s. Indeed, it was on occasions counterproductive. Even so, he presided over a reorientation of the BMA's activities that strengthened its regional services to individual members, a necessary response to the challenge of an NHS that had moved from being an administered service to a managed one. He was also active in promoting the interests of GPs in the European Community as a member of the advisory committee on medical training of the European Commission from 1976 to 1982.<br>
<br>Medico-politically, Cameron's time as council chairman could best be described as a holding operation. But this in no way detracted from his pivotal contribution to the renaissance of general practice. Had that rescue operation failed it was probable that the NHS itself would have failed. Ironically, in his final speech to the BMA's annual meeting in June 1979, Cameron warned of the failing state of the NHS: &#145;It suffers from chronic underfinancing &hellip; an overblown administration &hellip; bad personnel management and &hellip; poor industrial relations. &hellip; So far none of these fundamental problems have been realistically tackled&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 1979/2, 1803). At the previous annual meeting he had declared his belief that &#145;if the care of the patient is to be paramount&#151;and that after all is what the NHS is about&#151;then the doctor's authority in all matters affecting the patient's welfare must be recognised and his clinical judgement accepted&#146;. Aneurin Bevan had set out, Cameron said, &#145;to provide the facilities and the circumstances in which doctors could exercise their skills for the benefit of the patient. The basic concept has become corrupted&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 1978/2, 297). It was to be further corrupted during the remaining years of Cameron's life, when he observed the radical policies of successive Conservative governments converting patients into customers, with clinical priorities too often being subordinated to management and accounting objectives. Such a cultural change was anathema to him.<br>
<br>Cameron retired from clinical practice in 1977. After his wife's death in 1986 he moved to a flat in Haven Green, Ealing. He died of leukaemia at the Royal Marsden Hospital, London, on 22 October 1991. He was cremated six days later and his ashes were interred in the family grave at Aberfeldy. Had this complex, friendly, caring man&#151;the archetypal family doctor&#151;survived the decade, he would surely have grieved to see his family doctors' charter crushed by the management mills of the NHS internal market.<br>
