<span class="headword">Bayly,  Ada Ellen</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Edna Lyall]</span>  (1857&#150;1903), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, born at 5 Montpelier Villas, Brighton, Sussex, on 25 March 1857, was the youngest of the four daughters and a son of Robert Bayly, barrister of the Inner Temple, and his wife, Mary Winter. Her father died when she was eleven, and her mother three years later. A delicate child, she was first educated at home, then in the house of her uncle and guardian, T. B. Winter of Caterham, Surrey, and finally at private schools at Brighton. After leaving school Bayly lived successively with her three married sisters. Until 1880 she lived at Lincoln with her eldest sister, Mary Elizabeth, who had married John Henchman Crowfoot, canon of the cathedral. From 1880 until her death her home was with her third sister, Amy Agnes, wife of the Revd Hampden Gurney Jameson&#151;in London until 1881, in Lincoln from 1881 to 1884, and after 1884 at Eastbourne, where she devoted much time and money to charitable and religious causes. Bayly combined throughout her life strong religious feeling with an earnest faith in political and social liberalism. She was sometime president of the Eastbourne branch of the Women's Liberal Association, and a warm supporter of women's suffrage.<br>
<br>Under the pseudonym of Edna Lyall, which she formed by transposing nine letters of her three names, in 1879 Bayly published her first book, <span class="italic">Won by Waiting</span>, a juvenile story of a girl's life, which initially attracted no attention, but was reissued, to her annoyance, in 1886, after she became known, and by 1894 was in a thirteenth edition. In 1882 her second novel, <span class="italic">Donovan, a Modern Englishman</span>, was published. It dealt with her religious beliefs and spiritual experiences, and had a redeemed agnostic, Donovan Farrant, as its hero. Although only 320 copies were sold, the book won the admiration of Gladstone, who wrote to Bayly in 1883 describing its first volume as &#145;a very delicate and refined work of art&#146;. An intelligent review in the <span class="italic">National Reformer</span> led to a correspondence with the freethinker Charles Bradlaugh, many of whose political convictions she shared. In spite of their religious differences, her liberal sentiments resented his exclusion on religious grounds from the House of Commons (1880&#150;85). She subscribed three times to the fund for defraying his electoral expenses. After his death on 30 January 1891 she published an appeal for a memorial fund, and subscribed to it her royalties for the half-year, amounting to &pound;200. With Bradlaugh's daughter, Hypatia Bradlaugh Bonner, she formed a lasting friendship. Bayly based her novel <span class="italic">We Two</span> (1884), a sequel to <span class="italic">Donovan</span>, on some notes supplied by Bradlaugh. The secularist hero, Luke Raeburn, resembles Bradlaugh, although the novel centres on the conversion of his daughter to Christianity. With <span class="italic">We Two</span> Bayly's reputation was established, although for the copyright of these two books she received no more than &pound;50. But with the publication in 1885 of <span class="italic">In the Golden Days</span>, an able historical novel of the seventeenth century, her profits became substantial. <span class="italic">In the Golden Days</span> was the last book read to Ruskin on his deathbed  (W. G. Collingwood, <span class="italic">Life of John Ruskin</span>, 1900, 403). Contemporary opinion held <span class="italic">Donovan</span>, <span class="italic">We Two</span>, and <span class="italic">In the Golden Days</span> to be Bayly's best books.<br>
<br>In 1886 a stranger falsely claimed in public to be Edna Lyall, and a report also circulated that the author was in a lunatic asylum. Bayly met the falsehood by announcing her identity, and the experience suggested her <span class="italic">Autobiography of a Slander</span> (1887), which enjoyed an immense vogue and was translated into French, German, and Norwegian. This was followed in 1889 by <span class="italic">Derrick Vaughan: Novelist</span>, which is partly autobiographical.<br>
<br>Bayly's next novels primarily displayed her political convictions. An ardent home ruler, in <span class="italic">Doreen</span> (1894) she presented the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Davitt in the guise of her hero, Donal Moore. Gladstone, writing to her on 25 November 1894, commended &#145;the singular courage with which you stake your wide public reputation upon the Irish cause&#146;. She supported the Armenian cause in <span class="italic">The Autobiography of a Truth</span> (1896), the profits of which she gave to the Armenian Relief Fund. Strongly opposed to the South African War, she spoke out with customary frankness in her last novel, <span class="italic">The Hinderers</span> (1902). Also in 1902, Bayly published <span class="italic">The Burges Letters</span>, her autobiography.<br>
<br>Slight in build and of medium height, with dark brown hair and dark grey-blue eyes, Bayly was fond of music and of travelling, and described her tours in vivacious letters. Contemporaries felt that her earnest political purpose prevented her mastery of the whole art of fiction, and her apolitical romances such as <span class="italic">Wayfaring Men</span> (1897) and <span class="italic">In Spite of All</span> (1901) were more to their taste.<br>
<br>An attack of pericarditis in 1889 left permanent ill effects. Ada Ellen Bayly died on 8 February 1903 at her home, 6 College Road, Eastbourne. Following cremation, her ashes were buried at the foot of the old cross in Bosbury churchyard, near Bosbury Hill, Herefordshire, a place which figures in her novel <span class="italic">In Spite of All</span>, and of which her brother, the Revd R. Burges Bayly, was vicar.<br>
<br>In 1906 a memorial window by Kempe was placed in St Peter's Church, Eastbourne (built 1896), where Bayly had worshipped and to which she had presented the seats. She had given to St Saviour's Church in 1887 a peal of three bells named Donovan, Erica, and Hugo, after leading characters in her three chief books.<br>
