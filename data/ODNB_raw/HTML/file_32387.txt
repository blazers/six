<span class="headword">Cheatle,  Arthur Henry</span>  (1866&#150;1929), <span class="occ">otologist</span>, was born at Belvedere, Kent, on 4 December 1866, the second son of George Cheatle, solicitor, of Belvedere, and of Burford, Oxfordshire, and his wife, Mary Anne, daughter of James Allen, of Dartford, Kent. He was educated in London at Merchant Taylors' School and at King's College Hospital, and in Vienna. After qualification he was one of Joseph Lister's house surgeons at King's College Hospital. From 1893 he held an appointment at the Royal Ear Hospital. In 1899 he became assistant aural surgeon at King's medical school, and in 1910 aural surgeon and lecturer in aural surgery at King's College Hospital.<br>
<br>Cheatle began practice in London when otology both in Great Britain and on the continent was at a low ebb. By his original investigations he developed this branch of surgery and made otology of more general appeal both to British and foreign surgeons. Under his influence otological surgery became the province of specialists. Cheatle's original work correlated the anatomy of the temporal bone and its intimate pathological connection with the spread of infective processes to mastoid cells, petrosquamosal and lateral sinuses, and the meninges of the skull and brain. At the sixth International Congress of Otology, held in London in 1899, Cheatle's specimens impressed the visitors, and demonstrated the importance of otology as a special study.<br>
<br>In 1912 Cheatle was awarded the Adam Politzer prize for his histological work, which brought his name into international prominence. He was elected an honorary member of the New York Otological Society and of the Italian Otological Society. He was also elected Hunterian professor of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1906, and lectured on points in the surgical anatomy of the temporal bone. With Urban Pritchard he founded in 1899 the Otological Society of Great Britain, which became a special section of the Royal Society of Medicine. He was elected second president of this section in 1910.<br>
<br>In Cheatle's hospital and private practice, extensive operations on the temporal bone and its neighbouring structures became ordinary routine procedure. Cheatle dissected and mounted hundreds of normal and abnormal temporal bones, classified mastoid bones into cellular and acellular, and showed the latter to be a normal development and not, as previously believed, the product of suppuration. In 1911 he presented his own collection of some 700 temporal bones to the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Cheatle was appointed lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Air Force, then in its infancy. He initiated tests to determine the fitness of aviators. For this and his other work during the war he was made CBE in 1919.<br>
<br>In addition to articles in the transactions of various otological congresses and societies Cheatle published, with R. B. Carter, <span class="italic">Sight and Hearing in Childhood</span> (1903) and his Hunterian lectures, <span class="italic">Some Points in the Surgical Anatomy of the Temporal Bone</span> (1907). Cheatle, who was unmarried, died at his practice, 29 Wimpole Street, Marylebone, London, on 11 May 1929.<br>
