<span class="headword">Despenser,  Hugh, the elder</span>, earl of Winchester  (1261&#150;1326), <span class="occ">administrator and courtier</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7552/', "Sir Hugh Despenser")</script>, the justiciar who was killed at Evesham in 1265, and his wife, Alina, daughter of Philip Basset. Born on 1 March 1261, in May 1281 he was granted full administration of his father's forfeited lands, and in August received livery of his mother's lands, although he was not yet of age. In March 1282 he received the manor of Martley in Worcester as heir to his uncle John Despenser. Later in 1282 Despenser paid 1600 marks to William de Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1296), for his own marriage. In 1287 he was fined 2000 marks by the king for his marriage without licence to Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1306), daughter of William de Beauchamp and widow of Payn Chaworth. Despenser might be said to have recovered this sum in 1306, when the king paid &pound;2000 for the marriage of his only son, the younger <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7554/', "Hugh Despenser")</script>, who became the husband of the king's eldest granddaughter, Eleanor de Clare, sister of the earl of Gloucester.<br>
<br>In the reign of Edward I, Despenser made a career for himself through service both at home and abroad, where he was frequently employed on diplomatic missions. In 1287 he was with the king in Gascony, and in 1289 he went abroad with Roger (IV) Bigod, earl of Norfolk and marshal (<i>d</i>. 1306). In June 1294 he was appointed constable of Odiham Castle, and at about the same time was named one of the king's envoys to the German king, Adolf of Nassau, and the archbishop of Cologne. Late in 1294 he served in Gascony, and in 1295 he was summoned for the first time to parliament. In 1296&#150;7 Despenser again served as a diplomat, and was one of the king's proxies to the treaty sealed with the count of Flanders on 5 February 1297. A week later he was appointed justice of the forest south of Trent, and in June of that year was named as a member of the royal council. In the summer of 1300 he accompanied the king on his Scottish campaign, one of only three men of baronial status to do so, and in November he went on an embassy to Rome with the earl of Lincoln. He was one of the envoys sent to France to restore peace in April 1302. In January 1303 he was made keeper of all rivers in defence on this side of Trent (north, at this time), while he continued to serve as justice of the forest. In October 1305 he was sent to Clement V (<i>r</i>. 1305&#150;14) at Lyons to treat with the pope both for a possible crusade and concerning relations between the kings of England and France. He obtained a bull absolving the king from the oaths that he had taken to his people in 1297 and later. Interspersed with these various diplomatic missions were periods of service with the king in Scotland in 1303, 1304, and 1306. Despenser was rewarded for his constant service by Edward I with the Oxfordshire manors of Kirtlington (1296) and Great Haselese (1301), and with numerous lesser favours such as permission to enclose 30 acres of forest on one estate, and a weekly market and annual fair for another.<br>
<br>From the outset of Edward II's reign the elder Despenser was an ardent royalist. Indeed, even before the prince became king, as early as 1301, he referred to Despenser as &#145;one of our friends&#146;  (Johnstone, 102). It should not therefore be surprising to find that in the first year of the reign alone he appears in the charter rolls as a witness to some twenty-one of the thirty-eight acts enrolled there. At the coronation he carried part of the royal insignia. During the baronial crisis of 1308 Despenser was granted custody of Devizes, Marlborough, and Striguil castles, as well as of the town of Chepstow. In March 1308 he was again appointed a justice of the forest south of Trent, an appointment that was renewed for life in August 1309. In the later attacks on Piers Gaveston (<i>d</i>. 1312) he stood virtually alone in defending the Gascon favourite. For this reason he had been one of the courtiers singled out at the Northampton parliament of October 1307 who were to be dismissed from the council. His support for Gaveston was undoubtedly an important cause of the king's growing reliance on Despenser, as well as of the personal animosity increasingly felt for him by Thomas of Lancaster and others of the king's antagonists, not to mention Queen Isabella, throughout the reign.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, by November 1308 Despenser was back at court, as attested by his ubiquitous presence in the charter rolls throughout the rest of the second year of the reign, and indeed until the summer of 1314. In May 1313 he accompanied the king to France for the knighting of the sons of Philippe IV, a service for which he drew wages of 100<i>s</i>. a day, and he again accompanied the king to his meeting with Philippe IV at Montreuil in December of the same year. By that time he was considered to be an enemy of Thomas of Lancaster who had emerged as the leader of the baronial opposition. In the period of Lancaster's ascendancy following Bannockburn, Despenser, who had been present at the disastrous battle, is seldom if ever found at court, although he continued to serve as justice of the forest and in other capacities. He was among those present at the burial of Gaveston at Kings Langley on 3 January 1315, but shortly afterward was removed from the council by the king's enemies. In July 1315 a commission was appointed to hear complaints regarding his conduct as keeper of the forest south of Trent.<br>
<br>In the spring of 1316 Despenser once again became prominent at court and in the royal council, this time alongside his son and namesake. In 1317 he served with the king in Scotland. At this point, as record sources demonstrate even more clearly than earlier in the reign, he was at odds with the earl of Lancaster. Ironically, the appointment of the younger Despenser as chamberlain of the household was arranged in 1318 as part of the settlement between the king and Lancaster, and this appointment seems to have propelled the Despensers into the period of their greatest prominence. While the younger Despenser became ever more powerful at court and consolidated his territorial holdings in the Welsh march, his father continued his career of royal service. In 1320 he was sent to Gascony with Bartholomew Badlesmere (<i>d</i>. 1322) in order to consider reforms there and to visit the curia. From there he travelled to Amiens to join the king. By the following year, however, animosity towards the Despensers had grown to such a degree among the marcher lords and their ally Lancaster that even the king was unable to prevent the outbreak of violence.<br>
<br>On 4 May 1321 the ravaging of Despenser lands began. In August the baronial opposition met with the king in parliament and laid their charges against the Despensers, father and son. On 14 August the king capitulated to baronial demands for the exile of the Despensers, and on 20 August he pardoned those involved for their attacks on the royal favourites. The elder Despenser spent his exile in Bordeaux, within relatively close reach in the event of a recall. The king duly engineered this through a convocation held at Canterbury, which agreed on 1 December 1321 that the exile was invalid and should be annulled. A formal announcement to that effect was made on 1 January 1322, by which time a safe conduct had already been sent to Despenser. In the most effective military undertaking of his reign, in late 1321 and early 1322 Edward II routed the baronial opposition, the final blow being delivered at Boroughbridge on 16 March 1322. The earl of Hereford was killed in the battle, and the earl of Lancaster was executed six days later. Despenser is said to have been present at the latter's trial.<br>
<br>The period from 1322 to 1326 saw the Despensers rise to an unprecedented level of wealth and power. On 10 May 1322 the father was elevated to the peerage as earl of Winchester. Along with centres of power in the midlands and Wiltshire, Despenser now also built up a substantial holding near London based on the manor of Kennington. He received numerous grants of lands recently forfeited by the king's enemies, by members of the Bohun, Badlesmere, Damory, Giffard, and other families. From the great Lacy lordship he acquired the manor of Denbigh. In all, his lands were valued at &pound;3884 at his death. The elder Despenser may not have been as aggressively acquisitive as his son, but an accumulation of other men's property on this scale ensured that he came to share the hatred felt for the latter. Opposition to their regime became widespread and reached to the highest levels of English society, in the person of the queen. By 1326 the queen, who was in France on a diplomatic mission to her brother Charles IV, refused to return to England until the Despensers had been removed from the court. In the event she led an armed invasion in September of that year, and the king and his favourites were driven westward before her. On 26 October the garrison at Bristol capitulated to Queen Isabella, and the elder Despenser was forced to surrender. He was tried in a court of chivalry before William Trussell on the following day. He was denounced, and sentenced to death, for offences that included usurpation of royal power, depriving the church of its rights, and complicity in the illegal execution of Thomas of Lancaster. He was condemned to be drawn for treason, hanged for robbery, and decapitated for his crimes against the church, his head to be taken to Winchester, &#145;where you were earl against law and reason&#146;  (Stubbs, 1.317).<br>
