<span class="headword">Russ,  Sidney</span>  (1879&#150;1963), <span class="occ">physicist</span>, was born on 2 December 1879 at 27 Clifton Hill, St John's Wood, London, the fourth son of Charles Russ, a furrier, and his wife, Emily, formerly Callaway. He went to Shebbear College, north Devon, and graduated BSc with first-class honours from University College, London, in 1905, after which he became a demonstrator at the University of Manchester, working under Rutherford after the latter arrived there in 1907. In 1909 he obtained a DSc from University College, London, in 1910 he became Beit memorial fellow at the cancer research laboratories, Middlesex Hospital, and in 1913 he was appointed physicist to the hospital. In 1919 he changed to the medical school and in 1920 he accepted the newly instituted Joel chair of physics which he held to his retirement in 1946. He joined the R&ouml;ntgen Society in 1910, of which he was president in 1919&#150;20. Russ was a member of the British radium and X-ray protection committee, secretary of the Medical Research Council radiology committee, and scientific secretary of the National Radium Commission from 1928 to 1934. He was an original member of the King Edward's Hospital Fund radium committee which kept a stock of radium at the Middlesex in the care of Russ. This was loaned to other hospitals in London as required, together with help and advice on applications and dosimetry. The Medical Research Council also put Russ in charge of a radon organization which supplied nine facilities in the United Kingdom from 1924 to 1939. Russ served on various committees of the British Empire Cancer Campaign in its early years. He was appointed CBE in 1931 for his services to radium work, and he became the first chairman of the Hospital Physicists' Association, which was launched in 1943. Russ was married to Mary Priestley, eldest daughter of Major F. N. Priestley of Leeds; they had three children.<br>
<br>When diploma courses were established for radiology after the First World War, Russ became responsible for the physics syllabus of the courses at Cambridge University and the University of London, thus teaching a substantial part of a generation of British radiologists. He wrote two textbooks, <span class="italic">Physics for Medical Students</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Physics in Medical Radiology</span> (1928). He has been called a hard taskmaster, and his teaching style has been called conscientious, concise, pedantic, firm but always sympathetic, precise and autocratic but genuinely kind and understanding.<br>
<br>Russ's main role was in certification of radiation and people. He worked to spread precision measurement throughout medicine in general, and radiology in particular. Dosage problems and radiation protection were the immediate motivations for precision measurement, creating a need for quality instrumentation, safe practices, and constant control and calibration. Before the age of clinical trials this kind of work can be seen as facilitating the replication of clinical practices and the communication of clinical results. However, Russ, along with most physicists working in medicine, thought of his work not merely as a handmaiden for clinicians but rather as bringing science to bear upon the whimsical and unmethodical work of medical doctors. Russ's ambitions for the role of medical physics must be said to have failed in the sense that it is now a mere tool upon which clinical medicine can draw.<br>
<br>Russ was a driving force at the centre of the diffusion of precision measurement of radiation in Britain both of X-rays and of radioactive radiation. The two were very different. When contained in airtight vials radioactive samples were known to radiate constantly (or at least to come to do so after radioactive equilibrium was achieved). Thus they had to be measured only once, after which they could travel with a certificate designating the value. A certificate was meaningful only if this singular measurement was not doubted; the onus was on Russ to inspire trust. X-ray dosage was necessarily different because X-ray tubes do not emit unchanging radiation. Trustworthy measurement in any given location required the presence on the ground of reliable instruments and people. Russ measured, educated people in measurement, and lobbied for routine calibration of instruments, centred upon the National Physical Laboratory (this is one of the points of the co-authored book with Hector Colwell: <span class="italic">X-Ray and Radium Injuries</span>, 1934). His research, teaching, and committee work were all a part of this building of an infrastructure.<br>
<br>Early on Russ also did research on irradiation of human tissue, especially cancer. He attempted to categorize the clinical effect of particular kinds of radiation (different wavelengths and intensities of X-rays; different intensities of gamma rays). His collaboration with Hector Colwell, <span class="italic">Radium, X-Rays, and the Living Cell</span> (1915 and 1924), is an indication that work could still span both physics and medicine. By contrast the foundation of the Hospital Physicists' Association was symptomatic of a division of labour where physicists deal with measurement of radiation only and not with diagnosis, therapy, or clinical research.<br>
<br>After his retirement to Bognor Regis in 1946 Russ wrote popular books on cancer. <span class="italic">Cancer: Where we Stand</span> (1950) was supported by the British Empire Cancer Campaign. It was thought to reduce the resistance in the public to cancer examinations, and thus to the application of therapy at an earlier stage when chances of success would be markedly increased. <span class="italic">Smoking and its Effects</span> (1955) is an argument that a strict causation of lung cancer by tobacco had not been proven. In it Russ declared himself a keen smoker, marshalled statistical evidence, and discussed the problems of statistical inference at length. Russ died of carcinoma of the bronchus at his home, The Hut, Fish Lane, on 27 July 1963.<br>
