<span class="headword">Ross,  Sylvia Hope  Leith-</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Sylvia Hope Ruxton]</span>  (1884&#150;1980), <span class="occ">anthropologist and writer</span>, was born on 30 September 1884 in London, the second daughter and last of three children of Admiral William Fitzherbert Ruxton (1831&#150;1895) of the Royal Navy and his American wife, Sylvia Howland Grinnell, whose parents came from leading Boston and New York families. After Admiral Ruxton's death in 1895, when Sylvia was twelve, Mrs Ruxton settled in Paris. Although raised a protestant, Sylvia attended a convent school for a year, until her older sister was expelled; she then went to a finishing school in Fontainebleau. Her brother, Upton Fitzherbert Ruxton, an army officer ten years her senior, served under Sir Frederick Lugard in the newly established British protectorate of Northern Nigeria. He befriended and brought home on leave a young Canadian officer, Arthur Leith-Ross, who became engaged to Sylvia. In 1907, when the married couple set off for Zungeru, where he was chief transport officer of the protectorate, she was one of the few British wives permitted to accompany their husbands to Northern Nigeria. A year later he died of blackwater fever. She noted succinctly in her memoirs, &#145;Of our party of five who had sailed from Liverpool thirteen months before, I was the only one left&#146;  (Leith-Ross, 58).<br>
<br>During this first brief stay Sylvia Leith-Ross developed a deep attachment to Nigeria and, as a widow for the next seventy years, she dedicated herself to various projects among its peoples. In 1910 she gained permission to stay with her brother, who was in charge of Muri province on the River Benue. With his French wife, she compiled a cookbook, <span class="italic">Practical West African Cookery</span> (1908), which was published locally, went into several editions, and gained a reputation as &#145;a permanent contribution to the well-being of young bachelors new to the country, its greatest value being its emphasis on the value of local foods&#146;  (Smith, 8). During this visit, and again in 1913, she collected materials on the Fulani language in various parts of Northern Nigeria and, in the interval, attended the &Eacute;cole des Langues Orientales in Paris. Her <span class="italic">Fulani Grammar</span> (1921), published after the First World War, included texts and translations of Fulani folk-tales and brief vocabularies, both English&#150;Fulani and Fulani&#150;English. When the war broke out, she volunteered with the French Red Cross and worked for the duration in military hospitals. She returned to London and for the next five years, from 1920 to 1925, worked as secretary of the Tavistock Clinic under its founder, H. Crichton-Miller, who wrote, &#145;without her the Clinic would never have seen the light of day&#146;  (Crowder, 17).<br>
<br>Sylvia Leith-Ross returned to Nigeria in 1925, when her brother became lieutenant-governor of the southern provinces in Lagos. Recruited by the education service as its first lady superintendent of education, she helped to set up Queen's College in Lagos, advised the government of Northern Nigeria on the prospects for women's education in Ilorin, and became founding headmistress of the girls' centre in Kano before being invalided home in 1931. Her next project, supported by a Leverhulme research fellowship, came in response to the &#145;women's war&#146; of 1929. Sparked by rumours of impending taxation, women throughout eastern Nigeria rose in a mass movement to express their grievances and protest against various impositions of British rule, including specific warrant chiefs who abused their power. Misunderstandings on both sides led to violence; at several locations, British-led police and troops fired on the crowd, leaving a total of more than fifty women dead and fifty wounded (Gailey, 125; Afigbo, 241). To understand these women's views, Leith-Ross conducted an anthropological survey of their lives and their attitudes to change brought about by the colonial presence. Her resulting book, <span class="italic">African Women: a Study of the Ibo of Nigeria</span> (1939), concluded that the notable economic power and organizational abilities of these women had not been understood and in the future must be taken into account in the framing of new legislation or the creation of new social or economic situations. She gave engaging vignettes of people and incidents during her investigations in Igbo Ora in two books of memoirs, <span class="italic">African Conversation Piece</span> (1944) and <span class="italic">Beyond the Niger</span> (1951).<br>
<br>During the Spanish Civil War, Sylvia Leith-Ross went to Perpignan to care for refugees and, with the onset of the Second World War, worked in French military hospitals until the fall of France to the Germans. She expressed her love for France in her memoir <span class="italic">Cocks in the Dawn</span> (1944), relating her experiences there since childhood. The remaining years of the war she spent in Nigeria working with the Political and Economic Research Organization, which, among other intelligence duties, monitored activities in the Vichy-ruled French colonies immediately adjacent to Nigeria. Her final project in Nigeria, begun when she was over seventy and continuing for a decade (1956&#150;66), took her on bush roads throughout the country to collect pottery while it was still a vital enterprise in rural economies. This work resulted in a magnificent exhibition at the Nigerian Museum in Jos and a book, <span class="italic">Nigerian Pottery</span> (1970), with photographs and detailed explanatory material about the craftwork of Nigerian potters, both men and women. In 1966 she was made an MBE for her work.<br>
<br>Sylvia Leith-Ross's last visit to Nigeria took place in 1968, sixty-one years after her arrival in the country as a young wife. She lived in a convent during her last years. She died at the age of ninety-five, on 12 February 1980, at 67 Holland Park, London. Although her amateur ventures in linguistics and anthropology have become dated, her painstaking collection of Nigerian pottery stands as an enduring record of a disappearing art. Her autobiography, <span class="italic">Stepping Stones: Memoirs of Colonial Nigeria, 1907&#150;1960</span>, published posthumously in 1983, gives candid insights into her experience during her years in Nigeria. It provides an unusual record of British involvement in Nigeria, from the perspective of a woman holding colonial ideals but not uncritical of colonial society and what she considered its shortcomings.<br>
