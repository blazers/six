<span class="headword">Chute,  John</span>  (1701&#150;1776), <span class="occ">architect and connoisseur of the arts and literature</span>, was born on 30 December 1701, the youngest in the family of five sons and five daughters of Edward Chute (1658&#150;1722) of The Vyne, Sherborne, Hampshire, and his wife, Catherine, daughter of the lawyer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15235/', "Sir Anthony Keck (bap. 1630, d. 1695)")</script>, and widow of Ferdinand Tracy. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68305/', "Francis Chute")</script> was his brother. His education included a year at Eton College. For a period of seven years, from 1740 to 1746, he lived in Italy, where at the beginning of his stay he met and formed a close and lasting friendship with Horace Walpole. As a youngest son Chute's prospects had been poor&#151;his sojourn abroad had been in the company of his rich younger cousin Francis Whithead, to whom he may initially have acted as tutor&#151;but on the death of his only surviving brother, Anthony, in 1754 he unexpectedly succeeded to the family estates.<br>
<br>Chute's activity as an architect was confined to a small number of projects only but in them he established a distinct contribution in two different directions: one was as a significant figure in the early Gothic revival, the other as a classical designer of marked independence. As a member of Walpole's &#145;committee of taste&#146; he played a leading role in the creation of the latter's celebrated Gothic villa of Strawberry Hill. Walpole later described him as &#145;an able geometrician and an exquisite architect, and of the purest taste both in the Grecian and Gothic styles&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 21.263), and as &#145;my oracle in taste, the standard to whom I submitted my trifles, the genius that presided over poor Strawberry!&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 24.209); and from about 1753 onwards he designed much of the exterior, as well as a number of the interiors. Other works in the Gothic style included the tomb chamber he added to the sixteenth-century chapel at his own house of The Vyne (<i>c</i>.1756), to receive a monument to his ancestor Chaloner Chute (<i>d</i>. 1659), and Donnington Grove, near Newbury, Berkshire, built in 1763 for the antiquary James Pettit Andrews.<br>
<br>Of Chute's designs in a classical manner the first identified was a proposal of 1752&#151;in the form of an Italianate <i>palazzo</i> and based in part on an elevation in book 7 of Sebastiano Serlio's <span class="italic">Tutte l'opere et prospectiva d'architettura</span>&#151;for rebuilding Hagley Hall, Worcestershire, for Sir George Lyttelton; but this was rejected in favour of a conventionally Palladian one by Sanderson Miller. At The Vyne in 1770, however, he constructed a spectacular staircase within the former great hall, a <i>tour de force</i> which Walpole accurately described as &#145;theatric&#146;&#151;meaning after the manner of stage design&#151;and which has no parallels in English country-house architecture. The monument to Chaloner Chute, also designed by him and in a seventeenth-century classical style, was eventually erected after his death by his cousin T. L. Chute.<br>
<br>Chute was a man of unimpressive appearance, frail and near-sighted, and although abstemious he was a lifelong sufferer from gout. Like Walpole he was a vivid and witty correspondent and conversationalist and a discriminating connoisseur of literature and the arts. In 1757, like his father before him, he served as high sheriff of Hampshire. He died, unmarried, on 26 May 1776 and was buried in Sherborne St John, Hampshire.<br>
