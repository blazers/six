<span class="headword">Haliburton family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1375&#150;<em>c.</em>1500), <span class="occ">nobility of Dirleton</span>, enjoyed a brief period of power as servants to the Scottish crown, especially before 1450. The first prominent family member was <a name="cosubject_54220"></a><span class="headword">Sir Walter Haliburton</span>  (<em>c.</em>1375&#150;1446?)<span class="occ"></span>, the eldest son of probably Sir John Haliburton (<i>fl</i>. 1378&#150;1402) and his spouse, Margaret Cameron. Although Sir Walter had no known public career before his father's death, he was permitted to marry Isobel, daughter of Robert Stewart, duke of Albany (<i>d</i>. 1420), and widow of Alexander Leslie, earl of Ross (<i>d</i>. 1402), probably shortly after the latter's death. (The Walter Haliburton who <i>c</i>.1403 married Mary, daughter of Archibald, third earl of Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1400), and widow of David Stewart, duke of Rothesay (<i>d</i>. 1402), seems to have been a different man.) Despite this apparently advantageous marriage Haliburton made only sporadic appearances at court in the next thirty-five years (perhaps becoming more frequent as time passed). He was present at the battle of Long Hermiston Moor (14 February 1406) at which Sir David Fleming, a guardian of Prince James, heir to the throne, was killed. The evidence does not make it clear if he was a companion of Fleming or of James Douglas of Balvenie, who ambushed him.<br>
<br>A usually reliable contemporary chronicle states that Haliburton was knighted at the coronation of James I in May 1424, but he was a hostage in England for the ransom demanded for the king in 1424&#150;5. It would seem significant that he is not styled as a knight in any other document until after the coronation of James II in March 1437. As Albany's son-in-law he was in fact unlikely to have found favour with James I, and advancement came only after the king's murder in 1437. He was created treasurer by June 1438, a post he held for about two years. This elevation reflects the power of a patron&#151;probably Archibald, fifth earl of Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1439)&#151;and undoubtedly also the depletion of the Scottish nobility following the deaths or forfeitures of many nobles in the previous fourteen years.<br>
<br>The Haliburton family held land in Edinburghshire, Berwickshire, Perthshire, and Angus, but the main estate became Dirleton in Haddingtonshire, where there was considerable building work in the fifteenth century on the very imposing castle (which may have caused the mortgaging of part of the estate). Sir Walter, whose income in 1424 was estimated at 800 merks, also founded Dirleton collegiate church. He died certainly after July 1444, and probably in late 1446. His spouse, Isobel, is thought to have been the mother of his four sons and one daughter, although he may have had at least one further son. One possible son of his, <a name="cosubject_77134"></a><span class="headword">Mark Haliburton</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1456), briefly entered the limelight <i>c</i>.1449 as a result of association with the eighth and ninth earls of Douglas. Although apparently a layman, Haliburton was secretary to the latter. He escaped at first the forfeiture of the earl and his associates in 1455 through a display of loyalty to James II, and began to develop a career at court, even being rewarded with land forfeited by Douglas; but for some unknown reason he was himself forfeited, and perhaps executed, <i>c</i>.1456.<br>
<br>It is possible that before his death Sir Walter Haliburton assumed (simultaneously with some other Scottish landed families) a peerage title, but the evidence is uncertain. It is more likely that it was his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_54221"></a><span class="headword">John Haliburton</span>  (<em>c.</em>1405&#150;<em>c.</em>1454)<span class="occ"></span>, who became the first Lord Haliburton, shortly after his father's death. He was sheriff of Berwick by 1448, a post probably inherited from his father, whom he did not long outlive. He married Janet, daughter of William Seton and sister of George, Lord Seton (<i>d</i>. 1478). She was the mother of at least four of Haliburton's six sons. All but one&#151;George, third lord (<i>c</i>.1435&#150;1492)&#151;of the next four lords Haliburton were short-lived and the family went into eclipse, appearances at court being confined to attendance at parliament. They had little authority independent of their principal patron, the earl of Douglas, and after 1455 the Haliburtons mainly confined themselves to local affairs.<br>
