<span class="headword">Marsden,  Betty</span>  (1919&#150;1998), <span class="occ">actress and comedian</span>, was born on 24 February 1919 at 12 Southall Street, Walton, Liverpool, the daughter of John Marsden, a bombardier in the Royal Garrison Artillery, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Atkinson. Her parents were too poor to raise her and when she was six she left home for Somerset, where a music teacher, Betty Allen, became her guardian and mentor. She saw the child's potential as an entertainer, as did Betty herself who, aged seven, told her sister: &#145;One day I will be an actress in London with my name in lights and people will know about me&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>). After meeting the upper-crust mother of a schoolfellow in Fortt's teashop in Milsom Street, Bath, she started giving recitations at f&ecirc;tes and local Conservative clubs; when she was eleven she was the First Fairy in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span> at Bath's Pavilion Theatre. She made her London d&eacute;but on 26 December 1931 in a musical fairy tale, <span class="italic">The Windmill Man</span>, as the Prince. At the age of twelve she won a scholarship to the Italia Conti Stage School, where she studied for six years.<br>
<br>Marsden's first big West End role came in 1935, when she played Pamela in <span class="italic">Closing at Sunrise</span> at the Royalty, followed by roles in Basil Dean's production of <span class="italic">Autumn</span> (1937), in Ivor Novello's <span class="italic">Comedienne</span> (1938), and in a revival of J. B. Priestley's <span class="italic">Johnson over Jordan</span> (1939). She also appeared at the Malvern festival. She joined the Entertainments National Service Association for the duration of the Second World War, entertaining the troops in productions including <span class="italic">Gaslight</span> and <span class="italic">In Good King Charles' Golden Days</span>. During the war she married, in a Nigerian bamboo hut, Dr James Wilson Muggoch (<i>d</i>. 1975), a consultant anaesthetist whom she had met on a troopship. Theirs was a happy marriage, and they had a son and daughter and grandchildren to whom she was devoted.<br>
<br>After the war Marsden won critical praise as an amorous lady in James Bridie's <span class="italic">Doctor Angelus</span> (1947) with Alistair Sim, and in Sacha Guitry's <span class="italic">Don't Listen, Ladies</span> (1948). For years colleagues had been greatly amused by her off-stage sense of the ridiculous and gift for mimicry, but it was only when she entered the world of intimate revue that these qualities surfaced professionally. She started at the tiny Irving Club (1950&#150;51) and went to the Edinburgh festival with <span class="italic">After the Show</span>, but was dropped from the London production. No&euml;l Coward, meeting her at the first night, was indignant. He swore he would go and see her whenever she was in a play, and he did. She was in <span class="italic">Airs on a Shoestring</span> (1953&#150;5), its successor <span class="italic">From Here and There</span>, and <span class="italic">On the Brighter Side</span> with Stanley Baxter. Her versatility and wicked sense of burlesque in these shows led to the radio work for which she became nationally famous.<br>
<br>Marsden continued to work in the theatre through the 1970s to the 1990s, playing Lady Bracknell at the Shaw Theatre and the nymphomaniac wife in Lindsay Anderson's revival of <span class="italic">What the Butler Saw</span>. At the Oxford festival (1979) she gave two renditions of Wildean dowagers in <span class="italic">An Ideal Husband</span> and <span class="italic">Lady Windermere's Fan</span>, parts in which her slow basso profundo delivery and daring pauses produced laughs which might even have surprised Wilde himself. She was also a hilariously stupid, snobbish, yet not wholly unlikeable Mrs Hardcastle in <span class="italic">She Stoops to Conquer</span> (1983). Towards the end she played some effective National Theatre roles.<br>
<br>Marsden never much enjoyed film work, which included <span class="italic">The Young Lovers</span> (1954) and <span class="italic">Carry on Camping</span> (1969)&#151;feeling uneasy before a camera and without an audience. Her television work was rather more distinguished, and included parts in such series as <span class="italic">The Bill</span>, <span class="italic">Inspector Morse</span>, and <span class="italic">The Darling Buds of May</span>, but a restrained Betty Marsden was almost a contradiction in terms.<br>
<br>Although her audience missed seeing her round eyes and cheeks, expressive mouth, and robust figure, Marsden, with her inimitable vocal range, was a consummate broadcaster. The two series <span class="italic">Beyond our Ken</span> (1958&#150;64) and <span class="italic">Round the Horne</span> (1965&#150;8) gave superlative entertainment&#151;combining the anarchy of the Goons (better controlled), the wit and satire of <span class="italic">Take it From Here</span>, and an outrageous line in camp innuendo which was part risqu&eacute; revue, part sixties permissiveness. The benign, ultra-respectable Kenneth Horne was an inspired anchor man, off whom the hysterical Kenneth Williams, the more slyly camp Hugh Paddick, and the astonishingly versatile Betty Marsden&#151;the show's only female&#151;could play to perfection. Among her characterizations were the reminiscing ex-Gaiety girl, Lady Counterblast (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Bea Clissold), with her near-salacious catchphrase &#145;Many times, many, <i>many</i>, times&#146;; Dame Celia Molestrangler, who with ageing juvenile Binkie Huckaback (Paddick) played wonderfully hushed <span class="italic">Brief Encounter</span> burlesques; Daphne Whitethigh, the husky-voiced domestic adviser; ing&eacute;nues, vamps, and a hilariously sex-obsessed Australian, Judy Koolibar. As Barry Took, one of the writers, said, &#145;Nothing was beyond her, nothing escaped her&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). Behind the caricature there was always a recognizable person&#151;sometimes almost poignantly so.<br>
<br>Marsden had a mischievous, raucous sense of humour and also a profound seriousness about her craft. Playing in the theatre night after night, she never stopped exploring the possibilities of a scene. A mistress of timing, she made superb exits, drawing applause from the thinnest of houses. She was extraordinarily generous in giving advice to fellow players&#151;especially young ones&#151;provided she thought them talented. Ninety per cent of her suggestions were excellent; just occasionally she encouraged people to overplay. She was endearingly aware of this tendency in her own work: &#145;Tell me darling&#151;am I going too far?&#146;, she would say  (personal knowledge). At times overbearing, she was generous-hearted, bringing enormous pleasure to friends and public alike. For many years she, her family, and dogs lived on an 80 foot converted coal barge, <i>Chilham</i>, moored in Brentford; there she entertained lavishly. She died on 18 July 1998 at Denville Hall, 62 Duck's Hill Road, Northwood, of a heart attack, while enjoying a drink and a laugh with friends. She was survived by her son and daughter.<br>
