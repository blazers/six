<span class="headword">Wemyss,  David</span>, styled sixth earl of Wemyss <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Lord Elcho]</span>  (1721&#150;1787), <span class="occ">Jacobite army officer</span>, was born on 21 August 1721, probably at Wemyss Castle, Fife, the first son and heir of James, fifth earl of Wemyss (1699&#150;1756), and his wife, Janet (<i>d</i>. 1778), daughter of the notorious Colonel Francis Charteris and Helen Swinton. The parents of Wemyss, who was known by his father's subsidiary title Lord Elcho, separated in 1732. Educated at Winchester College, which he attended from 1734 to 1738, and at the military academy at Angers, Elcho was in Rome from October 1740 until April 1741. There, like many young visitors to the city, he met James Stuart (Stuart claimant to the throne). However, unlike the audiences obtained by many such visitors, Elcho's sprang not from mere curiosity nor a wish to experience the frisson arising from the knowledge that he was committing an act of treason. Rather his two interviews were an expression of his family's traditional loyalty to the house of Stuart. Elcho's commitment had at one time in his youth wavered under the influence of the master of Sinclair, a third cousin of his father, who tried to persuade him to abandon the Jacobite cause and obtain a government post. It seems that Elcho considered this idea but was dissuaded from it by Sir James Stuart of Coltness and Goodtrees. The Pretender's response to Elcho's visits was to appoint him a colonel of dragoons in February 1744, having already admitted him a member of the Royal Company of Archers on 12 July 1741. He returned to England in October 1741 but was back in France again from September 1743 to April 1744, during which time orders were &#145;sent to Scotland to take up the earl of Wemys' son, and 'tis said, some others will be seized, to the number of 15&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 3.287).<br>
<br>Elcho's Jacobitism led him to join Prince Charles Edward at Gray's Mill, near Edinburgh, on 16 September 1745, when he became the prince's first aide-de-camp and an original member of his council. Elcho fought at the battle of Prestonpans on 21 September 1745 and was very likely in command of the 1st troop of the Horse Guards, which he had raised and then commanded throughout the time Charles was campaigning in England. Consisting of about 100 &#145;gentleman of family and fortune &hellip; their uniform all blew and reed and all extreamly well mounted&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials of John Murray</span>, 226), these Horse Guards formed the prince's personal bodyguard. Elcho was one of the majority who at a council of war held at Derby in December 1745 advised the prince to return to Scotland rather than advance further into England and face almost certain death. Later Elcho was present on 17 January 1746 at the siege of Falkirk and on 16 April 1745 at the battle of Culloden, at which Charles's army was defeated by English forces under the command of the duke of Cumberland. Elcho was of the same mind as Lord George Murray, lieutenant-general in the Jacobite army and Charles's second in command, in attributing this defeat to the prince's lack of military acumen. While there appears to be little basis for the story that Elcho vilified the prince as he left the field of battle as &#145;a damned cowardly Italian&#146;  (Marshall, 146), Elcho clearly had little regard for him and believed that he placed too great a trust in Irish advisers such as Sir Thomas Sheridan. Whatever the truth of this, the defeat marked for the time being the end of the hope that Charles would secure his father's succession to the British throne, and Elcho, together with the duke of Perth and other leaders of the Jacobite forces, escaped to France in the frigate <i>Mars</i> on 3 May 1746. Elcho's <span class="italic">Short Account of the Affairs of Scotland in the Years 1744, 1745, 1746</span>, based on his manuscript journal, was published in 1907.<br>
<br>Elcho never returned to England, and for his part in the rising he was subject to the act of attainder passed in 1746 and his titles and lands were forfeited. In spite of this legal bar, he assumed the title of sixth earl of Wemyss on his father's death on 21 March 1756, although he continued generally to be known as Lord Elcho.<br>
<br>Elcho continued his military career in France, where he entered the service of Louis XV and held two unpaid offices. On 3 May 1756 he became a captain in Fitzjames's regiment, and from July 1756 until some time in 1763 held the rank of colonel in the Royal Scots. In the latter post Elcho was with his regiment at Gravelines from June to October 1757 and then at Dunkirk in 1758. Although he held no other military command, Louis XV conferred the order of military merit upon him in July 1770. Elcho divided his time between France and Switzerland, becoming naturalized in Ne&ucirc;chatel and purchasing a property there named La Prie. Although he had settled in France Elcho tried at various times to have his name removed from the act of attainder, and wrote from Paris on 27 June 1747 to the lord justice clerk &#145;if his Majesty will allow me to come home, I will give any assurance whatever for my making his Majesty a most loyall subject for the future&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials of John Murray</span>, 414). These unsuccessful attempts to have the attainder lifted created an enduring sense of bitterness between the prince and Elcho. This feeling was reinforced on Elcho's side by the prince's failure to repay the moneys he had advanced to him in support of his campaign in England.<br>
<br>On 9 September 1776 Elcho married at Be&ucirc;tal in Switzerland the daughter (<i>b</i>. 1756) of Baron d'Uxhull. She died in childbirth on 26 November 1777. Elcho himself died in Paris on 29 April 1787, aged sixty-five, and was buried with his wife at B&ocirc;le in Switzerland.<br>
