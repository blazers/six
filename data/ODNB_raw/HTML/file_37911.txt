<span class="headword">Rolt,  (Lionel) Thomas Caswall</span>  (1910&#150;1974), <span class="occ">engineering historian</span>, was born on 11 February 1910 at Eaton Road, Chester, the only child of Lionel Caswall Rolt, a minor country gentleman, and his wife, Jemima Clarke (subsequently Timperley). He was distantly related to Kyrle Willans, the son of Peter Willans, inventor of the enclosed vertical central valve steam engine, and himself a mechanical engineer. Willans advised Rolt's parents to apprentice him as a mechanical engineer, and it was with great enthusiasm that in 1926 the boy left Cheltenham College, where he had been miserable, to serve as a pupil at Bomfords, an agricultural engineering firm at Pitchill, near Evesham. In 1928 he began a three-year apprenticeship at Kerr, Stuart &amp; Co. Ltd, locomotive engineers of Stoke-on-Trent, but the firm collapsed before his term had been completed, and he finished his apprenticeship with R. A. Lister &amp; Co. Ltd of Dursley. He then moved to a succession of short-term jobs until in 1934 he joined some friends in establishing a garage near Basingstoke specializing in veteran and vintage cars. By now he had become an enthusiastic car owner and repairer, and with his colleagues he formed the Vintage Sports Car Club. This was his first substantial contribution to the preservation of the artefacts of industrial history. In 1939 he married Angela Orred, daughter of a retired army major. She left him in 1951 and joined Billy Smart's circus. His second wife was Sonia (1919&#150;2014), former wife of George Smith, a working canal boatman, and daughter of a colonial civil servant. She had worked on the canals during the Second World War. They had two sons.<br>
<br>Rolt had acquired an affection for canals as a result of joining the Willans family for holidays on their narrow boat <i>Cressy</i>. In 1939 he bought the <i>Cressy</i> and abandoned his career as a practising engineer in favour of a life spent writing on board a canal narrow boat. He and his first wife lived on the <i>Cressy</i> until 1951. The voyage which they made in 1939 resulted in the publication in 1944 of <span class="italic">Narrow Boat</span>, a passionate evocation of the British canals and of the lives of those who lived and worked upon them. It was largely responsible for the formation of the Inland Waterways Association in 1946, with Rolt as its first secretary. The <i>Cressy</i> had been moored at Tardebigge for four years while Rolt undertook various forms of engineering war work, but when peace returned he threw himself into the task of preserving the canal system. He envisaged a restoration of commercial activity on the canals, and was not at first sympathetic to their conversion into a leisure amenity. This and other more personal disagreements among the founders of the Inland Waterways Association led in 1951 to his withdrawal from the association.<br>
<br>In 1950 Rolt became involved in the effort to revive a narrow gauge quarry railway in north Wales&#151;the Talyllyn Railway. This was a great success, setting the pattern for many other preservation schemes. He and his second wife settled in the family house at Stanley Pontlarge, Gloucestershire, and here he resumed his literary programme, writing over forty books, covering canals, railways, motor cars, and many other aspects of engineering history. His most impressive works were biographies of the great engineers, especially the outstanding <span class="italic">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</span> (1957). All these books were lucidly written, illuminating the technical principles of engineering in a way which was comprehensible to the non-technical reader.<br>
<br>Rolt was not content to pursue only a literary career, but took an active part in the burgeoning preservation movements of the 1950s and 1960s. He became a vice-president of the Newcomen Society for the study of the history of engineering and technology; he became a member of the Science Museum advisory council, and helped to establish the Railway Museum in York; he advised the National Trust on industrial archaeology; and he was chairman of the Council for British Archaeology research committee on industrial archaeology. The discipline of industrial archaeology, which emerged in the 1950s, was largely inspired by his writings, and it was entirely appropriate that he should become the first president of the Association for Industrial Archaeology in 1973. His work was a formidable contribution to the growth of interest in the conservation of industrial buildings and machines. He died at Stanley Pontlarge on 9 May 1974, and was buried there on 14 May.<br>
