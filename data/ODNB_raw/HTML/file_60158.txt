<span class="headword">Singleton,  John</span>  (1715&#150;1795), <span class="occ">jockey and racehorse trainer</span>, was born at Melbourne, near Pocklington in Yorkshire. Details of his parents are unknown. His early working life was spent in Ross Moor (Yorkshire), first as a cattleherd and then tending horses in Mr Read's stables. Although barely in adolescence he was so skilled that a particularly fine piece of work prompted his employer to reward him with a ewe. Showing great business acumen Singleton sold the ewe's offspring, using the money to pay for a racehorse, Smiling Tom, to cover a mare belonging to Mr Read. The resulting foal proved to be an excellent horse which Singleton rode to victory in numerous races throughout the north. By then Mr Read was employing him to ride his best mounts, and in 1732 Singleton won His Majesty's Hundred Guineas race at Hambleton. This proved to be the first of many triumphs for Singleton, who established himself as one of the best jockeys of his day.<br>
<br>Typically for his time, Singleton was not sparing in his use of the whip, and Mr Read's horse Jack-come-tickle-me was so named because Singleton had informed him that the animal &#145;ran better for being tickled (whipped)&#146;  (Cook, 1.207). Singleton's expertise attracted the attention of the second marquess of Rockingham, who made him both his rider and trainer, and was rewarded by victories in a string of major races. Throughout his career, which spanned over fifty years, Singleton rode for only two owners, Mr Read and Rockingham. An indication of his status can be gleaned from the remarks of the Jockey Club's historian, Robert Black, who declared that although Mr Read was one of the founder members of the club &#145;his chief title to commemoration is that he introduced to the turf the celebrated jockey John Singleton&#146;  (Black, 130).<br>
<br>In 1769 Singleton married the widow of the jockey Peter Jackson; they had one son, John. Singleton took immense trouble to preserve his health, and remained very fit. At the age of fifty-seven he had a riding weight of just 8 stone 7 lb. Towards the end of his life contemporaries recorded that &#145;old John could lift a full glass of port without a tremor, for his head and nerves remained as cool as his chest and arms strong and solid&#146;  (Cook, 2.353). He made a significant amount of money from horseracing and &#145;founded the fortunes of his family at Great Givendale, where he was universally loved&#146;  (ibid.). He died at Ross Moor in 1795 and was buried in the same church there as his deceased employer, Mr Read. This was in accordance with both their wishes.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_64812"></a><span class="headword">John Singleton</span>  (1775/6&#150;1802), <span class="occ">jockey</span>, was the son of a nephew of the first John Singleton, also named John, and who had also ridden successfully for Lord Rockingham. Although the life and career of the third John Singleton were much briefer than his great-uncle's he rivalled him in fame. His greatest successes came in 1797 when he won both the Derby, riding the duke of Bedford's mount, and the St Leger, on a horse belonging to Lord Fitzwilliam. He was very well regarded by both the nobles and gentlemen who employed him, and his death in an accident at Newmarket at the age of twenty-six was &#145;sincerely lamented by those who had the pleasure of his acquaintance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sporting Magazine</span>, 255). While the first and the third John Singletons were the most successful jockeys of the dynasty, they were followed by three other Singleton brothers, Thomas Jackson, Kirton, and Leonard Jewison. Although all three were successful, Leonard Singleton, despite having only one eye, won more Gold Cup races than the others. Also, &#145;in spite of heavy &#147;wasting&#148;, not only in the saddle but in a chancery suit as well, he lived till he was 93&#146;  (The Druid, 200).<br>
