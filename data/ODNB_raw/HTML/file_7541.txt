<span class="headword">Des Barres,  Joseph Frederick Wallet</span>  (1721&#150;1824), <span class="occ">hydrographer and colonial official</span>, was born in November 1721, either in Basel, Switzerland, or in Paris, the eldest child of Joseph-L&eacute;onard Vallet des Barres, a Huguenot, and his wife, Anne-Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cuvier. He was baptized Joseph-Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Vallet and was educated at Basel under the Bernouillis. In 1752 or 1753, under the patronage of William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, he entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. In February 1756 he was commissioned lieutenant in the Royal Americans (62nd, later 60th foot), and that March embarked for North America. In 1758 he served as an assistant engineer at the siege of Louisbourg, Cape Breton Island, where he impressed his superior officers. He prepared a chart of the St Lawrence River, which was used by James Wolfe. He served as an assistant engineer in the 1759 and 1760 campaigns and worked on the Halifax defences in 1761. In 1762 he was an assistant engineer at the recapture of St John's, and after the French surrender he surveyed in Newfoundland with James Cook.<br>
<br>Recommended by the commanding officer of the Royal Navy in North America, from 1764 to 1773 Des Barres, with a small team and risking drowning, painstakingly surveyed the coast of Nova Scotia and beyond. He returned to England in 1774, and for several years prepared his and other charts and views for publication. His <span class="italic">The Atlantic Neptune, Published for the Use of the Royal Navy of Great Britain</span> (1774&#150;84) comprised charts and views of Nova Scotia, New England, the Gulf of St Lawrence including Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island, and the coast south of New York. Largely accurate and aesthetically pleasing, these continued to be standard works well into the nineteenth century. Des Barres had a protracted dispute with the Admiralty over payment for the <span class="italic">Atlantic Neptune</span>. His other publications included <span class="italic">Nautical Remarks and Observations on the Coasts and Harbours of Nova Scotia</span> (1778).<br>
<br>Des Barres acquired by grant and purchase much land in the maritime colonies, becoming one of their largest landowners. He was promoted captain in September 1775 and major in March 1783. In August 1784 he was appointed lieutenant-governor of Cape Breton, where he arrived in January 1785. He encouraged immigration and economic development, including coalmining and whaling, and founded and planned the colony's capital, Sydney. However, he quarrelled with the military commander and others, largely over supplies. In November 1786 Thomas Townshend, Viscount Sydney, the home secretary, recalled Des Barres, and in 1787 the latter handed over to his successor, left Cape Breton, and returned to England. Following the appointment in 1794 of his friend William Windham as secretary at war, the government paid most of the expenses he claimed for the <span class="italic">Atlantic Neptune</span> and Cape Breton. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel in March 1794 and colonel in January 1798. He pressed for another colonial appointment and in May 1804, aged eighty-two, was appointed lieutenant-governor of Prince Edward Island, where he arrived in July 1805. Though hampered by the legislature's unwillingness to provide revenue, he built roads and public buildings and improved defence, but became involved in local political disputes, being associated with James Bardin Palmer and his &#145;loyal electors&#146; against the rival &#145;old party&#146;. Pressed by the landed proprietors, in August 1812 Henry, third Earl Bathurst, the colonial secretary, recalled Des Barres.<br>
<br>Des Barres moved to Amherst, Nova Scotia, and in 1817 to Halifax. He had six children with a mistress, Mary Cannon, whom he met in 1764 and whom in 1776 he made agent for his estates. Later they were estranged, and in 1809, alleging she had &#145;fraudulently and corruptly betrayed [his] trust and confidence&#146;  (<span class="italic">DCB</span>, 196), he sued her in the court of chancery in Halifax, but the case was still undecided when he died. He also had eleven children with Martha Williams of Shrewsbury, whom he may have married. He was a man of ability and vision, but pushy, selfish, and callous. His greatest achievement was the <span class="italic">Atlantic Neptune</span>. He died, aged 102, on 27 October 1824 at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and was buried there.<br>
