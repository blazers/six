<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Carpenter,  (Joseph) Estlin</span>  (1844&#150;1927), <span class="occ">Unitarian minister and college head</span>, the second of the five sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4742/', "William Benjamin Carpenter (1813&#150;1885)")</script>, a prominent naturalist, and Louisa Powell (1812&#150;1887), was born on 5 October 1844, in Ripley, Surrey. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4731/', "Lant Carpenter")</script> and the nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4733/', "Mary Carpenter")</script>, both honoured names in the annals of Unitarianism; his uncles, Russell Carpenter and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4736/', "Philip Pearsall Carpenter")</script>, were also Unitarian ministers. William Carpenter was, at the time of his son's birth, tutor to the children of Lord Lovelace, but the family moved soon afterwards to London. Known throughout his life as Estlin, rather than Joseph, Carpenter grew up in a home where rational religious faith and puritan austerity (which included abstinence from alcohol) were balanced by scientific, literary, and musical enthusiasms. Among the family's treasured possessions were an organ (always whimsically known as &#145;Dagon&#146;) and a microscope. They were committed members of Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel, Hampstead, and William Carpenter served for a time as organist and choirmaster.<br>
<br>Estlin was educated first at University College School, and then, in 1860, having decided to follow his uncles into the Unitarian ministry, he moved to University College, London, where he studied mental and moral philosophy. In 1863 he proceeded to Manchester New College, the noted inheritor of the tradition of the dissenting academies, which by that time had moved from Manchester to London. Here, his intellectual ability and personal charm made a great impression on his fellow students. One of them, Philip Henry Wicksteed, was destined to become his lifelong friend and comrade, and his equal in academic eminence. Somewhat unexpectedly, during his student days Carpenter experienced a brief period of spiritual aridity. But this was resolved by a mystical experience in north Wales, described some years later, in graphic terms, in a letter to a friend. He left Manchester New College in June 1866 and spent the rest of the summer enjoying an extended holiday in Z&uuml;rich. This enabled him to perfect his knowledge of the German language&#151;an important factor in his later competence in critical scholarship. His stay in Switzerland also provided him with welcome opportunities for rowing and mountaineering, always his favourite recreations.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1866 Carpenter was appointed minister of Oakfield Road Church, Bristol, and in 1869 he moved to Mill Hill Chapel, Leeds, where Joseph Priestley had once ministered. At both places he was much admired, not only for the spirituality of his preaching, sustained by a well-grounded intellectual faith, but also for his wide interests. At Leeds in particular, his Sunday services were supplemented by regular academic lectures on many different topics, and he also found time to translate and edit (from the original German) a large part of G. H. A. von Ewald's <span class="italic">History of Israel</span> (1871&#150;8). But his career in the pastoral ministry was cut short by the onset of a curious speech defect, not finally eradicated until some nine years later, which seriously affected his preaching and lecturing.<br>
<br>In 1875 Carpenter accepted, not without some initial reluctance, an invitation to return to Manchester New College as professor in ecclesiastical history, comparative religion, and Hebrew. Though his initial qualifications for such an appointment were questionable, he threw himself into the work of ministerial training with great enthusiasm, devoting much time and energy to improving the range of his knowledge. He also showed, from the first, a special pastoral concern for the welfare of his students, offering them regularly the hospitality of his home in Hampstead, where he held frequent literary and musical evenings, and occasionally taking them on outings to cathedral cities and other places of interest. On 12 July 1878 he married Alice Mary (1854&#150;1931), the daughter of George Buckton, a leading member of his former congregation at Leeds. Though no children were born to them, their union was to prove in every respect a &#145;marriage of true minds&#146;, and throughout the rest of his life Alice remained his beloved helpmate and companion.<br>
<br>Thanks to the zealous and methodical dedication to study which was to mark Carpenter's entire career, his fame soon spread beyond the college, and in the wider academic world he eventually became an acknowledged authority in two spheres in particular&#151;biblical criticism and comparative religion. In the latter field he learned the Pali language with the assistance of Thomas Rhys Davis, the leading Buddhist scholar of the day, and in association with him he later undertook the onerous task of transliterating and editing some of the Pali Buddhist texts.<br>
<br>In 1885 James Martineau, always very highly esteemed by Carpenter, retired from the principalship of Manchester New College; he was succeeded by James Drummond, and Carpenter became vice-principal. Four years later, not without some controversy, the college moved to Oxford, subsequently dropping &#145;New&#146; from its name, and Carpenter moved with it. For the rest of his life he was to remain closely linked with Oxford, and his reputation and personality probably did much to secure the successful establishment of the college in its new home. In 1899, under somewhat obscure circumstances, Carpenter resigned from the vice-principalship, retaining only the Case lectureship in comparative religion. But this probably merely reflected a desire on his part to devote himself more earnestly to academic pursuits, and in 1906 he resumed a full involvement in the work of the college upon his appointment as principal in succession to Drummond. He retired in 1915 on attaining the age of seventy, but he continued as principal-emeritus, and from 1920 to 1925 he held the honorary office of president of the college. From 1914 until 1924 he was the Wilde lecturer in comparative religion at Oxford University.<br>
<br>Carpenter lived an extraordinarily busy and well-filled life. His very considerable literary output, which included some major works in both biblical criticism and comparative religion, is listed in full in C. H. Herford's <span class="italic">Memoir</span>. In the field of biblical criticism perhaps his most famous work was what came to be known as <span class="italic">The Oxford Hexateuch</span> (1900). Though this was originally a composite production, edited by Carpenter and G. Harford Battersby, it was Carpenter who was most closely involved in the enterprise, and the one-volume second edition (1902) was almost entirely his responsibility. The work did much to secure a general acceptance of the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis&#151;the theory that the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>, and possibly other parts of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, were an untidy combination of four separate sources, designated by the symbols J, E, D, and P. He also wrote some important books on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, such as <span class="italic">The First Three Gospels, their Origin and Relations</span> (1890), and in his eighty-third year he published <span class="italic">The Johannine Writings, a Study of the Apocalypse and the Fourth Gospel</span> (1927). In comparative religion perhaps his best works, apart from the editions of the Pali texts, were <span class="italic">Theism in Medieval India</span> (Hibbert lectures, 1921) and <span class="italic">Buddhism and Christianity, a Contrast and a Parallel</span> (Jowett lectures, 1923). His small comprehensive manual entitled <span class="italic">Comparative Religion</span>, a contribution to the <span class="roman">Home University Library</span> series, published in 1913, though much admired in some quarters, was probably one of his less successful efforts. He also wrote definitive biographies of his revered teacher James Martineau (1905) and his aunt Mary Carpenter (1879).<br>
<br>Carpenter was always an assiduous organizer of conferences and summer schools, especially during his time at Oxford. This brought him into contact with many of the leading academics of the day, both at home and abroad. It also led to new collaborations and friendships, notably with F. Max M&uuml;ller, A. S. Peake, and L. R. Farnell. When Peake came to compile his famous one-volume <span class="italic">Commentary on the Bible</span>, he asked Carpenter to contribute an introductory article on the <span class="roman">Pentateuch</span>. His intellectual eminence earned him honorary degrees from several universities, including a DLitt and a DD from Oxford. Passages in the many letters which he received underline the extent to which his contemporaries acknowledged his competence and expertise. Max M&uuml;ller once said to him, in a brief note: &#145;Could you, without much trouble, tell me the latest date that can safely be assigned to Exodus 3.14?&#146; A. J. Edmunds, another academic, wrote to him as follows: &#145;There are hundreds of scholars who know more about the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> than I do, and scores who know more about the <span class="roman">Pali Texts</span>; but I know of only one man on earth who is equally well acquainted with the two, and that man is Estlin Carpenter&#146;  (Carpenter MSS, Manchester College, Oxford).<br>
<br>But Carpenter was also from first to last a dedicated Unitarian. In spite of his multifarious academic activities, he seems nevertheless to have found time to involve himself, to quite a surprising degree, in the practical affairs of the Unitarian denomination. He devoted much energy, for example, to a personal campaign for the establishment of a pension fund for ministers. His abilities as lecturer and preacher were occasionally instrumental in the founding of new Unitarian causes&#151;most notably at Cambridge, where a congregation, founded in 1908, was the eventual outcome of regular weekly services held during university term time, which had been inaugurated after a series of lectures by Carpenter in 1903. In addition, throughout his life&#151;true to a family tradition&#151;he showed an active concern for social service, and always retained a special interest in such causes as temperance, international peace, and the relief of poverty. In pursuit of the latter he was from 1880 to 1889 the secretary of the London Domestic Mission Society, a pioneer Unitarian organization with a practical concern for the problems of urban deprivation.<br>
<br>Always firmly committed to the Unitarian tradition in all its aspects, Carpenter was an untiring advocate of friendly relations with all the great world faiths, and especially with the religions of the East, of which he had an astonishingly detailed knowledge. He also fostered and encouraged close contacts with liberal churches in India and Japan. In his own personal life, as was always evident from his conduct of worship, he possessed a rich and emphatically Christian spirituality, characterized by a deep assurance of an all-embracing divine love. Here, perhaps, was the source of his unswerving belief in a universal revelation.<br>
<br>To those who did not know him well, Carpenter sometimes seemed a rather shy and austere figure. Someone is supposed to have said of him, rather unkindly, that &#145;he had no redeeming vices&#146;  (Herford and others, 102). But he was in reality an unusually friendly individual who always took a close personal interest in the lives of all his former students. The enterprising house parties at his country cottage in the Lake District, to which students and colleagues both past and present were regularly invited, were at one time quite legendary. With his full beard and handsome face Carpenter was an imposing figure, and for most of his life he was endowed with robust health and much given to vigorous exercise, especially rowing and hill walking. His final years, however, were marred by painful illness, and at an earlier period he had had to endure some tragic experiences, the details of which his biographer does not disclose. But nothing could shake the serenity of his personal faith. A month before his death, in a letter to a former student, he wrote: &#145;A recent attack has made me an old man, and my walking days are over. But from my windows I can still enjoy the glories of spring, and even in bed I can say &#147;How beautiful it is to be alive!&#148;&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>, 25 June 1927).<br>
<br>Carpenter died at his home, 11 Marston Ferry Road, Oxford, on 2 June 1927, and was buried at Wolvercote cemetery on 7 June. The public orator at Oxford University, in sonorous Latin, mourned the passing of &#145;a learned, gentle, and most Christian soul&#146;  (Herford and others, 90). After his death the memory of Carpenter's saintly life eventually faded&#151;even within his own denomination&#151;and his academic reputation suffered a marked eclipse. In biblical scholarship, some at least of his conclusions have stood the test of time, and his books, especially those on the <span class="roman">New Testament</span>, can still be read with profit. But the world of comparative religion is no longer in tune with his essentially evolutionary approach, and his obvious Christian commitment, despite his wider sympathies, makes him suspect. But in both of the fields in which he excelled he undoubtedly deserves an honourable place as a remarkable pioneer in objective critical study, and the Carpenter Library of Comparative Religion, established at Manchester College (now incorporated into the university as Harris Manchester College) constitutes a unique and lasting memorial to his genius.<br>
