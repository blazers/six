</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hollar,  Wenceslaus</span>  (1607&#150;1677), <span class="occ">etcher</span>, was born in Clothmakers' Street, Prague, Bohemia, on 23 July 1607, the eldest of the three sons of Jan Hollar (<i>d</i>. 1630), an official of the land registry in Prague, and his wife, Marketa (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1613), the daughter of David L&ouml;w of L&ouml;wengr&uuml;n and Bareyt in the upper Palatinate. His father, from Hora&#382;d'ovice in southern Bohemia, was knighted by the emperor Rudolf II in 1600 and given the right to bear arms and style himself &#145;of Pr&aacute;che&#328;&#146;. The family were protestants connected with the evangelical Bohemian Brethren.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Although intended for a bureaucratic or legal career, the young Hollar turned, against his father's wishes, to the arts. Beneath his etching (<i>c</i>.1649) of his portrait by Meyssens he is described as &#145;de nature fort inclin p[ou]r l'art de meniature principalement pour esclaircir, mais beaucoup retard&eacute; par son pere&#146;. The few surviving early etchings and drawings, including copies after D&uuml;rer and Beham, show the influence of the etcher Aegidius Sadeler, but it is unlikely that Hollar had any formal training.<br>
<br>In 1627, aged twenty, Hollar left Prague, probably prompted by the edict of the emperor Ferdinand II of 31 July requiring the Bohemian nobility to convert to Catholicism or emigrate. From about November 1627 to Spring 1629 he was based at Stuttgart, from 1629 to 1630 at Strasbourg, and in 1631 at Frankfurt am Main, where he worked for Matth&auml;us Merian. For four years from 1632 he lived in Cologne, whence he made extended tours up the Rhine to Mainz in 1632 and downstream to Amsterdam in 1634. Many drawings survive from these years, including a sketchbook now in the John Rylands University Library at Manchester. The Cologne publisher Abraham Hogenberg issued Hollar's first major productions, a set of views from Prague to the Dutch coast titled <span class="italic">Amoenissimae aliquot locorum in diversis provinciis iacentium effigies</span> (&#145;Delightful likenesses of some places lying in various countries&#146;) (1635) and a set of small portraits entitled <span class="italic">Reisbuchlein</span> (&#145;Little travel book&#146;) (1636).<br>
<br>Although Hollar must have left Prague with means sufficient to maintain his standing as a gentleman and had since become an accomplished landscape artist and proficient etcher, his work cannot have been remunerative. The arrival of Thomas Howard, second earl of Arundel, at Cologne on 2 May 1636 on an embassy to the emperor Ferdinand II was to change his life. On his departure on 8 May Arundel had, as he wrote to William Petty, &#145;one Hollarse wth me, whoe drawes and eches printes in strong water quickely, and wth a pretty spiritte&#146; (BL, Add. MS 15970, fol. 26; Springell, 143). For eight months Hollar travelled in Arundel's retinue&#151;he made a final visit to Prague and received confirmation of his father's grant of arms and the right to style himself &#145;Prachenberger von L&ouml;wengr&uuml;n und Bareyt&#146; from the emperor at Regensburg on 16 October&#151;before arriving in London on 28 December 1636.<br>
<br>It was intended that Hollar, who had lodgings in Arundel House, should reproduce paintings and drawings belonging to the earl and countess of Arundel, but the project never developed, and only four prints from his early years in London are based on their collections. From the start he courted other patrons, and his first major production in England, a panoramic view of Greenwich (1637), was dedicated to Queen Henrietta Maria and proudly signed &#145;Coelator&#146; (<i>recte caelator</i>, engraver) to Arundel. A copy of the Wilton diptych (1639), dedicated to the king, is one of a few prints by Hollar bearing a royal privilege providing protection from copyists. At some time (according to Meyssens' portrait) he was appointed to the household of the young duke of York, presumably as a drawing master. Among Hollar's most ambitious early projects was a set of twenty-six plates of women's costumes, some deriving from Van Dyck, entitled <span class="italic">Ornatus muliebris Anglicanus, or, The severall habits of English women from the nobilitie to the country woman</span> (1640). He also made numerous portraits of political and religious figures, such as Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford, after Van Dyck (1640), whose trial and execution he also depicted (1641).<br>
<br>On 4 July 1641 Hollar married Margaret Tracy (<i>d</i>. 1653), a servant of the countess of Arundel and probably a daughter of Anthony Tracy, an agent of the earl's. She died in 1653 and was buried at St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, on 10 March. A son, James, was born on 8 April 1643 at Tart Hall, the countess's house in St James's Park. John Aubrey noted that he &#145;dyed in the Plague, an ingeniose youth, drew delicately&#146; and that a daughter was &#145;one of the greatest Beauties I have seen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 163).<h2>
<a name="Middlecareer"></a>Middle career</h2>In February 1642 the earl and countess of Arundel left England for Antwerp. Hollar, now wholly dependent on his own means, continued to concentrate on women's costumes. A dark fur double muff was the first of nine versions of a favourite subject, and he also began work on a set of smaller female figures entitled <span class="italic">Aula Veneris</span>, or <span class="italic">Theatrum mulierum</span>. A set of full-length female figures as the four seasons (1643, 1644) are among his most famous prints and bring to an end his first English period, for, some time in 1644 he moved to Antwerp. There he joined the artists' Guild of St Luke as a free master, and by 1648 his friend from Frankfurt, the Arundels' art curator Hendrick van der Borcht the younger, was able to write to John Evelyn that Hollar &#145;is very much esteemd in these parts and Especially in Antwerp where he is nouw dwelling. Many Lovers of arts make Collections of all his worckes&#146;  (Harding, 41). To meet this demand Hollar turned for inspiration to his sketchbooks and the Arundel collections, now being dispersed. He produced copies of paintings and drawings by Holbein, Adam Elsheimer, D&uuml;rer, and Leonardo da Vinci, topographical and architectural prints&#151;including, most importantly, the <span class="italic">Long View of London from Bankside</span> (1647) and the <span class="italic">Long View of Prague</span> (1649)&#151;portraits, ships, a rare set of shells, sets of butterflies, and much more.<br>
<br>In late 1651 or early 1652 Hollar returned to London, where he was to be largely dependent on two men, the publisher John Ogilby and the antiquary and herald Sir William Dugdale. Ogilby's luxury edition of Virgil, with illustrations after Francis Cleyn (1654), and <span class="italic">Aesop's Fables</span> (1665) and Dugdale's <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span> (1655), <span class="italic">Antiquities of Warwickshire</span> (1656), and <span class="italic">History of St Paul's Cathedral</span> (1658) all have numerous plates by Hollar.<br>
<br>At some time Hollar converted to Roman Catholicism. Evelyn noted that he &#145;was perverted at last by the Jesuits at Antwerp to chang his Religion&#146;  (Evelyn, 1.21), and Aubrey mentioned that he &#145;dyed a Catholique, of which religion, I suppose, he might be ever since he came to Arundel-howse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 163). In January 1656 he was bound over in the sum of &pound;40 at the Middlesex sessions for hearing mass at the lodgings of the Venetian ambassador. On 3 July 1656 he married Honora Roberts at St Giles-in-the-Fields. Aubrey reported that they had several children. In 1658 Hollar was living in Holborn, near Gifford's buildings, and about 1661 he wrote to Aubrey that he was lodging &#145;without St Clemen[t]s Inne back doore&#146; and to ask for &#145;the Frenchman Limmner for they know not my name perfectly&#146; (Bodl. Oxf., MS Aubrey 12, fol. 175; Pennington, xli).<h2>
<a name="Latercareer"></a>Later career</h2>In 1660 Hollar issued a prospectus for a large-scale map of London which he hoped would be his financial salvation, but the great fire of London in 1666 rendered his work obsolete. He quickly produced smaller maps and views depicting the damage, but he did not abandon his great map; its remains may be seen in Ogilby and Morgan's <span class="italic">Large Map of London</span> (1677). On 31 October 1666 he successfully petitioned the king for the &#145;Honour &amp; Tittle of your Majesties Scenographer; or Designer of Prospects&#146;  (Godfrey, 29).<br>
<br>In March 1669 the sixty-two year old Hollar turned again to his old patrons and petitioned the king for permission to accompany Lord Henry Howard, Baron Howard of Castle Rising, on his embassy to Tangier as official artist. Some thirty-one drawings, including large panoramic watercolours, survive, and Overton issued a set of fifteen etchings by Hollar entitled <span class="italic">Divers Prospects in and about Tangier</span> (1673). On a voyage from Tangier to Salli in December 1669 they escaped an attack by Algerian pirates, which Hollar depicted in Ogilby's <span class="italic">Africa</span> (1670).<br>
<br>During all these years Hollar produced frontispieces, portraits, and maps for the book and print publishers, but the last years of his life were again filled by work for antiquaries: Elias Ashmole's <span class="italic">Institutions, Laws &amp; Ceremonies of the Most Noble Order of the Garter</span> appeared in 1672 and the second and third volumes of Dugdale's <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span> in 1661 and 1673. Francis Sandford's <span class="italic">Genealogical History of the Kings of England</span> and Robert Thoroton's <span class="italic">Antiquities of Nottinghamshire</span> appeared in 1677, after Hollar's death.<br>
<br>The recipe for Hollar's &#145;Ground for Etching in Copper or Brass; with his Directions how to use it&#146; appeared in a number of artists' handbooks and was reprinted by Vertue  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Description</span>, 133&#150;6). The antiquary Richard Symonds &#145;saw Mr. Hollar etching&#146; on 20 February 1649 and described his method of laying on the wax and acid  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.112). His friend Francis Place, an amateur artist, recalled that &#145;he did all by the hour, in which he was very exact, for if any body came that kep him from his business he always laid the hour glass on one side, till they were gone. he always recev'd 12d an hour&#146;  (ibid., 1.34). Hollar's only personal comments on his working methods are contained in a letter to Hendrick van der Borcht the elder in Frankfurt, on a proof of his copy of Holbein's <span class="italic">Solomon and the Queen of Sheba</span> (1642):<blockquote>Der Herr muss aber nicht denken dass das der beste abstrukh ist, von wegen dass ich sobal[d] als ich das Etzwasser abgeschitt had, disse Probe lassen truken, und es muss noch dz gantze Stuck nach dem Principal gekorrigirt werden, &hellip; Dan was der Herr hier sihet, dass ist nur dz wass dass Etzwasser gethan hatt, es wird aber noch mitt dem grabeissen verholffen werden. (But you must not think this is the best impression, because I had it printed as soon as I had shaken off the etching fluid, and the whole thing has still to be corrected according to the master. &hellip; For what you see here is only what the etching fluid has done, and now further work will be done with the graver.)(British Museum, department of prints &amp; drawings, 1870&#150;6&#150;25&#150;39; Griffiths, 167)</blockquote>Contemporaries described Hollar as &#145;a very friendly good-natured man as could be, but Shiftlesse to the Worlde&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 163) and &#145;a very passionate man easily moved&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.34&#150;5). Aubrey reported that he &#145;was very short-sighted&#146; and &#145;When he tooke his Landskapes, he, then, had a glasse to helpe his Sight&#146;  (<span class="italic">Brief Lives</span>, 163). His portrait by Meyssens depicting him with his etching tools and an etched self-portrait (1647) show him with a neat moustache and small imperial beard.<br>
<br>Hollar died on 25 March 1677 at the age of seventy at his house in Gardener's Lane, Westminster, and was buried three days later at St Margaret's, Westminster. According to Francis Place's letter of 20 May 1719 to George Vertue he died &#145;of a Parraletick [or Apoplextick] fitt. &amp; before his departure. the Bayliffs came and seiz'd all that he had, which gave him a great disturbance &amp; he was heard to say they might have stayed till he was dead&#146;  (Vertue, <span class="italic">Note books</span>, 1.35). This cannot be strictly true, as an inventory of his possessions taken on 6 April valued the contents of the modestly furnished house and &#145;prints belonging to the decds: trade&#146; (&#145;Inventory of all the goods&#146;)  (Westminster City Archives, inventories act book 6, no. 298) at &pound;22. He died intestate, and administration of his estate was granted to his widow, Honora, on 25 May 1677. The date of her death is unknown, but she was apparently alive in 1701, when Sir Hans Sloane noted the purchase of a volume of Hollar's prints from her. Place said he left two daughters.<br>
<br>The variety of Hollar's work, his huge output (Pennington's <span class="italic">Descriptive Catalogue</span> runs to 2717 numbers), and his technical skill have ensured that his prints have always been keenly collected. Comprehensive collections are at the British Museum (based on Sir Hans Sloane's collection), the Royal Library in Windsor Castle (partly traceable to Queen Charlotte), University of Toronto Library (S. T. Fisher collection), and the National Gallery, Prague (Kinsky Palace). Some 400 drawings have survived, and important collections are at the British Museum, the Staatsmuseum, Berlin, the National Gallery, Prague, and the Royal Library, Windsor Castle.<br>
