<span class="headword">Coddington,  William</span>  (1601?&#150;1678), <span class="occ">merchant and official in America</span>, was born in Lincolnshire and may have been the son of Robert Coddington (<i>d</i>. 1615) of Marston, Lincolnshire. At the tender age of twenty-nine, while still in England, he was elected an assistant or magistrate of Massachusetts Bay Colony. He arrived in Salem in June 1630 with Governor John Winthrop and the first company of settlers, including his first wife, Mary, who died that winter. He married Mary Moseley (<i>d</i>. 1647) on 2 September 1631. During the next six years he was elected to numerous town and colony offices, including colony treasurer (1634&#150;6). The upward trajectory of his Massachusetts political career was halted in 1637 when he supported Anne Hutchinson during the antinomian controversy. After her trial and banishment he moved in 1638, along with other religious dissenters, to Rhode Island, where, with Roger Williams's help, he purchased the island of Aquidneck from the Narragansett Indians. Accustomed to exercising political authority, he expected once again to occupy high office. Rhode Islanders, however, were far more fractious than Massachusetts settlers, and his path to power was not smooth. At Portsmouth, a town he founded on the northern end of Aquidneck, inhabitants organized the community according to a biblical model and selected him as judge, a powerful position based on an ancient Hebrew office. But just a year later, in 1639, he was ousted because of political and theological disputes with a faction led by Anne and William Hutchinson. Fed up with such contentiousness, he moved in 1640 with his supporters to the southern end of the island, where he established Newport. That same year, after Portsmouth and Newport united under a common administration, he served as governor. When those towns joined with Warwick and Providence in 1647, he was chosen the second president of the new political entity, serving from May 1648 to May 1649. While in office he attempted, unsuccessfully, to have Rhode Island included in the New England confederation, created by the other New England colonies for defence against the American Indians. He also evidently failed to establish his authority within Rhode Island with as much force as he would have liked. In January 1649 he departed for England; he returned two years later with a new spouse, Ann Brinley (<i>c</i>.1628&#150;1708), an infant son, and a commission from the council of state naming him governor of Aquidneck for life, with complete judicial power. Other officials in Rhode Island were scarcely pleased, and years of political turmoil ensued. Finally, in 1654, Roger Williams negotiated an uneasy peace among the various factions, and Coddington abandoned his independent rule of Aquidneck, agreeing to serve as Newport's representative in the court of commissioners. His political career subsequently waned, in part perhaps because of his growing interest in spiritual matters. He eventually embraced Quakerism, and even entertained George Fox in his home in 1672. Towards the end of his life he was called again to public service, elected deputy governor in 1674 and governor in 1678.<br>
<br>Politics and government dominated Coddington's life, but family matters and economic interests likewise engaged him. He had thirteen children, six of whom survived to adulthood. A wealthy merchant and self-styled gentleman, he prospered in Rhode Island, despite losing property worth &pound;400 in a fire in 1644. He was one of Rhode Island's most prominent stockmen, raising sheep on offshore islands and horses for sale to West Indies sugar planters; he also experimented with tobacco production. He owned one of the grandest mansion houses in Newport. It was in that town that he died in November 1678, in the middle of his term as governor. He was buried in Newport on 6 November 1678.<br>
