<span class="headword">Wittleseye <span class="st"> [Whittlesey]</span>,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1374), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was nephew to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14493/', "Simon Islep")</script>, likewise archbishop, a kinship that provided the foundation for much of Wittleseye's ecclesiastical career. His family possibly had Northamptonshire associations; his will mentions his chapel at Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire. His date of birth is unrecorded. In 1351 he named an illegitimate brother, Roger Elingdon, and identified Reginald Neuton and Roger Herleston as kinsmen. His will names William and Ralph (the latter his chamberlain) as relatives; the former was probably the William Wittleseye the elder, who died before 1363.<br>
<br>The first secure references to Wittleseye appear in the 1330s. He was master of arts, probably of Oxford, by 1335, when he acquired his first known benefice, the rectory of Meesdon, Hertfordshire. Others followed, some of them cathedral canonries (at Lincoln, Exeter, Lichfield, and Chichester), others rectories and canonries in lesser collegiate churches. The most significant was the archdeaconry of Huntingdon, held from 1337. His early ecclesiastical career was interspersed with continued activity as a scholar, but no known writings survive. In 1348 Pope Clement VI granted him permission to study civil law at a university for three years. This he presumably did at Cambridge, where he had lodgings that year. In 1349 he was described as bachelor of both laws, and probably then incepted for his doctorate in civil law at Cambridge. On 10 September 1349 he was admitted as master of Peterhouse, Cambridge; he remained in post until 1352, but later moved to Oxford, where he was apparently teaching in 1360. By then he was a professor and doctor of both laws.<br>
<br>Wittleseye's university connections continued after his elevation to the episcopate. In 1367 he obtained a papal bull freeing Oxford University from the obligation to obtain confirmation of the chancellor's election from the bishop of Lincoln. As archbishop of Canterbury he was embroiled in the affairs of Canterbury College. In October 1370 he and his &#145;satraps&#146; were considered hostile to the monastic hold there; nevertheless, in July 1371 Wittleseye appointed a monk as college warden, and in 1372 confirmed the appropriation of Pagham church to the foundation. His debt to Cambridge was acknowledged with the bequest of his books to Peterhouse.<br>
<br>Wittleseye's links with his archiepiscopal uncle were critical. In late 1350 he was Islep's envoy to the curia at Avignon, and was among the archbishop's proctors for <i>ad limina</i> visits in 1352 and 1358; in 1351 Islep appointed him proctor before the <i>parlement</i> of Paris. From 1353 until 1359 he appears as the archbishop's chancellor; he also acted as commissary-general, and received numerous specific commissions. He became official of the court of Canterbury on 25 July 1360, remaining in post until his consecration as bishop of Rochester. There is little sign of involvement with secular administration, although he acted as Edward III's emissary to Avignon in 1353. In 1351 he was described as a councillor of both Mary de St Pol, countess of Pembroke (<i>d</i>. 1377), and of the abbot and convent of Spalding (who supported his request for a papal provision). By then he was also petitioning the pope on his own behalf, and as patron of other clerics.<br>
<br>On 23 October 1360 Wittleseye was elected bishop of Rochester, to succeed John Sheppey. Rochester's dependence on Canterbury suggests that Islep had a hand in the appointment. Nevertheless, formal confirmation took time. Papal provision was delayed until 3 July 1361. Spiritualities were released on 28 November, the temporalities held from the crown on 13 December; those held from the archbishopric probably followed on 25 December with his profession of obedience. Consecration occurred at Otford, Kent, on 6 February 1362.<br>
<br>Wittleseye's tenure of Rochester was uneventful. He spent much of his time with Archbishop Islep, for whom he celebrated all Canterbury ordinations until shortly after his translation to Worcester. The papal bull for that appointment was issued on 6 March 1364, temporalities being released on 28 June. His enthronement was, however, delayed until 11 May 1365. Again, the register suggests an uneventful pontificate, during which he apparently spent most of his time in the diocese. On 11 October 1368 another translation occurred, to succeed Simon Langham at Canterbury after Edward III had forced his resignation following his nomination as a cardinal. The bull was received on 13 January 1369, temporalities were restored on the 15th, and enthronement took place on 17 June. Wittleseye held the primacy until his death at Lambeth Palace on 5 or 6 June 1374. He apparently fell ill soon after his translation, and remained an invalid thereafter. Whatever hopes were held of him must soon have faded. Nevertheless, he did not totally avoid controversy. The <span class="italic">Eulogium historiarum</span> records a confrontation with Edward, the Black Prince, at a great council which, if not fictitious (as sometimes alleged), probably occurred in June 1373. In a debate on papal authority in England, notably concerned with King John's submission, and perhaps linked to papal claims to taxation, Wittleseye is first recorded as supporting the papal stance, but then as backing down after a heated exchange with the prince.<br>
<br>Wittleseye's will, made on his deathbed, was proved on 13 June 1374. To Peterhouse he left his books on theology and both laws, and also those acquired from his kinsman William; some remain there. He was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, his monumental tomb remaining until 1787. On 2 February 1371 he had founded a chantry in the hospital of St Nicholas, Harbledown, Kent, which continued until 1548.<br>
<br>Little evidence of Wittleseye's character remains. The records of his administration are unremarkable, at Canterbury perhaps because of his illness. Despite being Islep's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, he must have had qualities that made him more acceptable as an archbishop than other candidates; but they are no longer immediately identifiable.<br>
