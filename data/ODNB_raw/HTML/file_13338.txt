<span class="headword">Hincks,  Thomas Dix</span>  (1767&#150;1857), <span class="occ">non-subscribing Presbyterian minister and academic</span>, was born at Bachelor's Quay, Dublin, on 24 June 1767. His father, Edward Hincks (<i>d</i>. 1772), had moved in that year to Dublin from Chester. Dix was his mother's maiden name. On her husband's early death she retained his post in the Dublin customs. Hincks went to school in Nantwich, Cheshire, and Dublin. Originally intended for medicine, he was apprenticed in 1782 to a Dublin apothecary, but after two years he entered Trinity College, Dublin. He did not finish his course, but in September 1788 entered Hackney New College, under Drs Price, Kippis, and Rees. Kippis recommended him as assistant to Samuel Perrott at Cork. He began his ministry there in 1790, but was not ordained until 1792 by the southern presbytery. In September 1791 he married Anne (1767&#150;1835), eldest daughter of William Boult of Chester, the grandfather of Swinton Boult, director of the London, Liverpool, and Globe insurance company. They had seven children.<br>
<br>Meanwhile in 1791 Hincks opened a school, which he continued until 1803, when he became a member of the Royal Irish Academy, and a salaried officer of the Royal Cork Institution, of which he was the planner. He lectured on chemistry and natural philosophy (1810&#150;13). He left his church and the institution and moved to Fermoy, co. Cork, in 1815, succeeding Dr Adair as tutor of the Fermoy Academy. There in 1818 he formed a small Presbyterian congregation which met in the court house. He resigned his positions and from 1821 to 1836 he was classical headmaster in the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, filling also the chair of Hebrew in the collegiate department of the institution until the establishment of the Queen's College in 1849.<br>
<br>Hincks was a member of most of the scientific societies of Ireland. His published works include several school textbooks and while in Cork he edited the <span class="italic">Munster Agricultural Magazine</span>. After settling in Belfast he was admitted a member of the Antrim presbytery and attended the church of William Bruce, who was a friend and colleague. His theology was Arian, but he avoided polemics, and got on well with clergy from all denominations. In 1834 he was made LLD of Glasgow. He died on 24 February 1857 in Murray's Terrace, Belfast, and was buried in the churchyard of Killyleagh, co. Down, his eldest son's parish. There is a memorial window to him in the First Presbyterian Church, Belfast. Three of his sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13335/', "Edward Hincks")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13336/', "Francis Hincks")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13339/', "William Hincks")</script>, attained distinction. Thomas (1796&#150;1882) was archdeacon of Connor from 1865. John (1804&#150;1831) was minister at Renshaw Street, Liverpool (1827&#150;31). A daughter, Anne, died unmarried in 1877 at Montreal.<br>
