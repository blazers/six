<span class="headword">Emslie,  George Carlyle</span>, Baron Emslie  (1919&#150;2002), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at 8 Carlton Gardens, Glasgow, on 6 December 1919, the eldest child of Alexander Emslie (1888&#150;1972), an insurance company manager, and his wife, Jessie Blair, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carlyle (1890&#150;1976). His parents were both Scottish, his father being descended from an Aberdeenshire farming family. He attended Albert Road Academy and Glasgow high school and went on to Glasgow University, graduating MA in 1940. On the outbreak of the Second World War he volunteered for active service and, after an initial posting to the Manchester regiment, he was commissioned in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. He fought in north Africa, Italy, Greece, and Austria. In 1944 he passed out from the staff college at Haifa and became one of the youngest brigade majors in the army. He was mentioned in dispatches and appointed MBE (military division) for his war service in 1946. On 2 October 1942 he had married Lilias Ann Mailer Hannington (<i>d</i>. 1998), whom he had met at university and who was then serving as a chief petty officer in the Women's Royal Naval Service. She was the daughter of Robert Hannington, company director. They had three sons, Nigel, Derek, and Richard.<br>
<br>After the war, although encouraged to stay in the army, Emslie returned to Glasgow to take his law degree and complete his apprenticeship with Marshall and McLachlan, solicitors. Moving to Edinburgh, he devilled for Harald Leslie and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates, the Scottish bar, in 1948. For the next twenty years his work at the court of session was dominated by personal injury cases. With his capacity for hard work and clear thinking, Emslie soon established himself in the field and, after he took silk in 1957, he was recognized as one of the outstanding counsel at the bar. Acting mostly for defenders, he regularly used his skill in courteous cross-examination to expose the weaknesses and contradictions in his opponent's position. This skill was on display in 1963 when he successfully represented the eleventh duke of Argyll in his divorce action against the duchess, a prominent figure in London society, on the ground of her adultery. Despite opposition, Emslie destroyed her credibility in the witness box by taxing her with diary entries about various sexual partners and a notorious photograph of her engaging in a sexual act with an unidentified man&#151;which later featured in the report by Lord Denning on the Profumo affair.<br>
<br>In 1963 Emslie was appointed sheriff of Perth and Angus. Two years later he was elected dean of the Faculty of Advocates. With the active encouragement of the vice-dean and the clerk of faculty, he presided over much needed reforms which, in particular, reduced the financial barriers that had hitherto prevented many people from joining the faculty. In 1970 he became a judge of the court of session and in March 1972 he was appointed to succeed Lord Clyde as lord president of the court of session and lord justice general of Scotland. He held the combined offices until his retirement in September 1989.<br>
<br>Although his practice had been almost exclusively civil, it was in criminal law that Emslie made his greatest impact. Under Lord Clyde and his predecessors criminal appeals had been actively discouraged; the appeal court sat little and produced few judgments. Under Emslie the atmosphere changed completely. With the advent of legal aid, more appellants had counsel to represent them. He listened courteously to the arguments, whether from counsel or from the appellants themselves, and would then usually deliver an extempore judgment that presented the rival contentions with a clarity that made them almost unrecognizable to counsel who had just advanced them. This remarkable feat depended on long and meticulous preparation beforehand. Being decisive, and taking no delight in legal technicalities, he was able to state the law in succinct, uncluttered propositions, which proved invaluable to later judges. His judgments on the burden of proof of self-defence (in <i>Lambie v. HM Advocate</i>, 1973) and on oppression in bar of trial (in <i>Stuurman v. HM Advocate</i>, 1980) are examples. In civil cases, proceedings in the first division were equally courteous and fair. His judgments were rarely appealed against&#151;and even more rarely reversed by the House of Lords&#151;but, because the field was more developed, the impact of his decisions was inevitably less dramatic. Even so, later judges frequently relied on his typically forthright statements in cases such as <i>Wordie Property Co. Ltd v. Secretary of State for Scotland</i>, 1984 (on reasons in administrative decisions).<br>
<br>During Emslie's time as lord president, the work of the court changed. To his regret, many fewer decisions in personal injury actions were taken to appeal, so that he somewhat lacked opportunities to deploy his expertise in the field. Since he was convinced of the inherent superiority of most aspects of Scots law and practice, he resisted changes that he considered to be unnecessary or harmful. Notably, provision for temporary judges in the court of session was not made until after his retirement. But his confidence and authority, combined with his mastery of the rules of procedure, made him an effective innovator when required. He amalgamated the separate civil and criminal administrations of the supreme courts, and so helped ease the strains imposed by the increased demands of criminal work. He presided over the smooth disappearance of undefended divorce proofs from the court of session. Somewhat reluctantly, and under pressure from the House of Lords, in 1985 he introduced new rules for judicial review of the decisions of public bodies, and so set in motion the development of Scottish public law. Although he was made a life peer in 1980, as Baron Emslie of Potterton, he went to sit judicially in the House of Lords only twice and did not make his maiden speech until 1990.<br>
<br>Emslie was a tall man of military bearing whose general appearance and dress were never anything but immaculate. In some circles a supposed resemblance to the Kaiser earned him the affectionate nickname German George. By his very presence he dominated his court. To the casual observer he might seem remote, but experienced counsel could detect, by the stroking of his moustache or the twinkle in his eye, whether he was displeased or amused, whether an argument was finding favour or not. Outside the law, he was an elder of Cramond kirk and, for many years, the assiduous vice-chairman of the board of trustees of the National Library of Scotland. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh from 1987 and took an active interest in its affairs. An essentially private man, however, he was devoted to his wife and sons, two of whom were to follow him onto the Scottish bench. He liked to holiday on Bute and latterly, with his wife, at Appin, where he could pursue his interest in bird-watching. In his youth he played football for Glasgow University and Scottish Universities and always maintained a keen interest in the game. He was also a fine cricketer and, even as lord president, would turn out for the bench and bar in an annual match. But his principal relaxation was (highly competitive) golf, and he much enjoyed the annual match with the English bench and bar. Whenever possible, at weekends he would play at Muirfield, which offered him a congenial setting in which to relax with friends.<br>
<br>After his wife's death in 1998 Emslie successfully looked after himself and took up new interests, visiting his youngest son in South Africa and playing the piano every day. Despite suffering a slight stroke he lived independently right up until his sudden death on 20 November 2002 at his home, 47 Heriot Row, Edinburgh, following a heart attack. He was survived by his three sons.<br>
