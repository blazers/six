<span class="headword">Hobart,  John</span>, second earl of Buckinghamshire  (1723&#150;1793), <span class="occ">politician</span>, second, and first surviving, son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13393/', "John Hobart, first earl of Buckinghamshire (1693&#150;1756)")</script>, politician, and his first wife, Judith Britiffe (<i>d</i>. 1727), was born in Greenwich, Kent, on 17 August 1723. He was educated at Westminster School (1732&#150;9) and at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he was admitted in October 1739, but did not take any degree. On 4 October 1745 he was appointed a deputy lieutenant for the county of Norfolk, and at the general election in June 1747 was returned as a whig to parliament for the city of Norwich and the borough of St Ives, Cornwall, on his family's interest. He elected to sit for Norwich and was again returned for that city at the general election in April 1754. In December 1755 he was appointed comptroller of the household to George II, and on 27 January 1756 was sworn of the privy council. He succeeded his father as second earl of Buckinghamshire on 22 September 1756 and took his seat in the House of Lords on 14 December. Resigning the comptrollership he was appointed a lord of the bedchamber on 15 November 1756. He held the post until dismissed in November 1767 for having supported the duke of Bedford's motion of April 1767 for a Lords' address to the king to take into consideration a Massachusetts Bay act pardoning rioters in the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> disturbances.<br>
<br>By this date Buckinghamshire, who on 14 July 1761 had married Mary Anne Drury (1740&#150;1769), daughter and heir of Sir Thomas Drury, baronet, of Overstone, Northamptonshire, had served as ambassador and minister-plenipotentiary to Russia. He accepted the responsibility of concluding a new treaty with Russia on 17 July 1762. The difficulty was that the Russians' priority was a political treaty, whereas Britain desired a treaty of commerce. He commenced negotiating in Moscow in December 1762 but the draft treaty proposed by the Russians in August 1763, which committed Britain to support Russia's interests in Sweden, Poland, and, in the event of war, Turkey, was unacceptable. By his own account Buckinghamshire was made very welcome at the Russian court, but his high social profile did not compensate for the lack of initiative and imagination he displayed in negotiation, and it was clear by August 1764, when Lord Sandwich effectively directed him to get the stalled negotiations moving or return to Britain, that he was not the man to bring a treaty into being. He left Russia in January 1765, having handed over the negotiating responsibility to Sir George Macartney. In October 1766, shortly after the establishment of the Chatham administration, Buckinghamshire refused Lord Shelburne's request for him to become ambassador to Spain. Despite this, he remained eager for governmental employment, but he was neither sufficiently well liked nor sufficiently able to command notice, and this dovetailed with his alienation of the king to ensure a wait of ten years for his next appointment. Indeed, it was only because Lord Dartmouth and Lord Rochford could not be prevailed upon to accept the lord lieutenancy of Ireland that Lord North and George III agreed to grant him the &#145;very important charge&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 3.363) that was Ireland. He was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland on 18 December 1776 and arrived in Dublin on 25 January 1777.<br>
<br>As a consequence of the augmented role carved out for the lord lieutenant by Lord Townshend (1767&#150;72), sympathy for the cause of the American colonists, and the higher profile of the patriots in the Irish House of Commons, Buckinghamshire took charge of Ireland at a difficult moment. He began badly by choosing a family friend, Richard Heron, who &#145;was totally unacquainted with politics and parliament&#146;  (Rosse MS C/12/1), for the crucial position of chief secretary. He compounded matters by accepting the advice of the duke of Leinster and Thomas Conolly that he should abandon those upon whom his predecessor had relied. One consequence of this was that experienced figures like John Hely-Hutchinson, John Beresford, and Henry Flood were passed over in favour of Philip Tisdall, Hussey Burgh, John Scott, and John Foster. These were not without skill or experience, but they did not possess the same authority as those they replaced in the House of Commons and were not always reliable. Despite this and the problems engendered by the unexpected death of Tisdall in September 1777, Buckinghamshire was able to negotiate the vigorous challenge offered by the patriots during the 1777&#150;8 session with reasonable comfort. Furthermore, the ratification of a measure of Catholic relief and the vote of a record amount of taxes permitted him to put a more positive gloss on the session than a close analysis of proceedings sustains.<br>
<br>One of the factors that helped the lord lieutenant in early 1778 was the conclusion of a treaty between France and the American colonies. However, privateer activity off the Irish coast and rumours of a planned French invasion in the summer of 1778 prompted the anxious protestant population to found volunteer corps to aid with the defence of the kingdom. The volunteers, as these corps were known, were entirely independent of government, and Buckinghamshire's attempt to establish a modicum of control over them by granting temporary commissions to the officers was repulsed. Irish resentment at the modest trade concessions agreed at Westminster in 1778 combined with the downturn in economic activity due to war gave rise to a non-importation campaign aimed at British goods and a powerful demand for the removal of restrictions on Ireland's right to trade with Britain and the empire in 1779. Buckinghamshire appealed to London to be allowed to respond with commercial concessions when the Irish parliament met again in October 1779, but Lord North, whose preference was for a union, tergiversated, with the result that when MPs reassembled the lord lieutenant found he could not carry the House of Commons. His most difficult moments were the spectacular volunteer protest at College Green on 4 November and the Commons' refusal to sanction other than a six months' money bill. Compelled to agree with Buckinghamshire that the only option was concession, Lord North yielded &#145;free trade&#146; and it was given legislative effect in 1780. Buckinghamshire was able only then to achieve a measure of control over the House of Commons and to defeat a number of motions on constitutional points in 1780, but his earlier failures and the general frailty of English government in Ireland under his leadership ensured that he was not to be allowed to remain in his Irish posting. He felt so &#145;slighted and insulted&#146;  (J. Hobart to Lord G. Germain, 2 Nov 1780, <span class="italic">Lothian MSS</span>, 375) by what he regarded as Lord North's mistreatment when news of his replacement was announced that he prepared a lengthy &#145;vindication&#146; of his conduct during his time in Ireland  (<span class="italic">Lothian MSS</span>). He had grounds in that North was both inattentive and inconsistent with his advice to him. At the same time it is clear that Buckinghamshire was ill-equipped personally and politically to cope with the difficulties he faced in Ireland. Subsequently he had to be content with a minor political role. He supported the Fox&#150;North coalition in 1783 and opposed Pitt's <span class="roman">Regency Bill</span> in 1788&#150;9. He was elected FSA on 1 April 1784.<br>
<br>Following the death of his first wife on 30 December 1769 Buckinghamshire married on 24 September 1770 Caroline Conolly (<i>c</i>.1755&#150;1817), third daughter of William Conolly of Stratton Hall, Staffordshire, and Anne Wentworth. She was the sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6096/', "Thomas Conolly (1738&#150;1803)")</script>. They had four children: three sons, all of whom died in infancy, and one daughter, Lady Amelia Anne, who survived together with the four daughters from his first marriage. Buckinghamshire died at his home, Blickling Hall, Norfolk, on 3 September 1793, aged seventy, and was buried in 1794 under the pyramidal mausoleum on the Blickling estate. He was succeeded by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13390/', "George Hobart, third earl of Buckinghamshire (1731&#150;1804)")</script>, politician. His youngest daughter, Lady Amelia Anne Hobart (<i>d</i>. 1829), married on 9 June 1794 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26507/', "Robert Stewart, later second marquess of Londonderry, but better known as Viscount Castlereagh (1769&#150;1822)")</script>, politician.<br>
