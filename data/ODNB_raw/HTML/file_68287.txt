<span class="headword">Galliardello,  Mark Anthony</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1585), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was born in or near Venice into a Jewish musical dynasty whose Italian surname was probably Alberti. When at the end of the 1530s Henry VIII authorized Thomas Cromwell to effect an improvement in his musical establishment at court, Cromwell recruited a branch of the Lanier family from France and many musicians from the Venetian families of Lupo, Ferrabosco, Bassano, and (as they came to be known in England) Galliardello.<br>
<br>The Galliardellos specialized in playing, and probably also making, viols and violins. Mark Anthony &#145;Gagiardell&#146; entered the royal service on 1 May 1545 and was in 1549 living in a large alien colony in East Smithfield. By the beginning of Elizabeth's reign he had moved to the liberty of Holy Trinity Minories, next to the city parish of St Botolph Aldgate, having apparently just married his wife, Margery. A daughter, Lucretia, was baptized at Holy Trinity on 8 April 1563, followed by Mark Anthony in 1565 (<i>d</i>. 1566), Frances in 1566, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68288/', "Caesar Galliardello")</script> in 1568. One month before Caesar's birth Mark Anthony was granted letters of denization as queen's servant, born a subject of the duke of Venice.<br>
<br>By this time Galliardello had abandoned his Jewish faith and espoused protestantism&#151;with a vengeance, it may be said. He became churchwarden of Holy Trinity Minories in December 1568, keeping scrupulous accounts and carefully compiling a list of visiting preachers and the sums paid to them. His conscientious drudgery provides historians with vital clues to the development of nonconformist activity in London in the aftermath of the vestiarian controversy which divided the capital after March 1566. It is plain that he was prominent in encouraging the activities of such radical clergymen as John Field, William Bonham, and Nicholas Crane.<br>
<br>Although Galliardello's successors after 1570 did not continue the tradition of listing their visiting preachers, one of them noted in 1575 that he and others were to be thanked for their &#145;liberality towards the preachers &hellip; or else it would cost us more money&#146;  (Tomlinson, 398). Galliardello served again as churchwarden for two years from December 1576 and was associated with Crane and Thomas Wilcox in the regulation of poor relief.<br>
<br>Galliardello's daughter Lucretia married another royal musician, Henry Troches, in 1580 and gave birth to three children before dying aged twenty-one in September 1584. Mark Anthony did not long survive her, dying on 15 June 1585 in Holy Trinity Minories. He was buried at the church two days later, in &#145;most good name and fame and godly report of all his neighbours&#146;  (ibid.), a comment unique in the Minories' records. He was survived by Margery, by Caesar, and by Frances, who on 12 October 1585 married the musician John Lanier (<i>d</i>. 1616). Their son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16052/', "Nicholas Lanier")</script>, first master of the king's music, was baptized in the parish on 10 November 1588. Margery Galliardello long survived her husband, dying in 1611.<br>
