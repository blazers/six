<span class="headword">Heitland <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Bateson]</span>,  Margaret</span>  (1860&#150;1938), <span class="occ">journalist and social activist</span>, was born in Cambridge on 27 February 1860 in the master's lodge, St John's College. Daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1685/', "William Henry Bateson (1812&#150;1881)")</script>, master of the college, and his wife, Anna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Aikin (1829&#150;1918), she had three sisters and two brothers; among them were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30641/', "William Bateson")</script>, a biologist, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30640/', "Mary Bateson")</script>, a historian. Margaret was educated at Highfield Finishing School in Hendon, and at Heidelberg. She was fluent in French and German, and for a time coached pupils for the Cambridge higher local examinations. Inheriting her parents' concern for the advancement of women, in 1884 she became assistant secretary of the Cambridge Women's Suffrage Association, which her mother founded with Millicent Garrett Fawcett in that year. Finding in Cambridge inadequate scope for her energies, she took the unusual step of moving to London in 1886 to work as a journalist. In 1888 she began to write for <span class="italic">The Queen</span>, at that time a leading journal for women; she founded in 1889 its &#145;Women's employment department&#146; feature, edited it until 1914, and made it a pioneering and powerful voice for the increase of opportunities for middle-class women. Gathering into a book, <span class="italic">Professional Women upon their Professions</span> (1895), her journal accounts of twenty-five interviews, she regretted that the choice given to young women was often &#145;between complete domestic obscurity on the one hand and the very highest distinctions that art and letters can offer on the other&#146;; instead, she suggested &#145;the intense happiness that merely being and doing <i>something</i> yields&#146;&#151;a phrase typical of her writing in its enlightened yet practical helpfulness  (M. Heitland, <span class="italic">Professional Women</span>, 1895, v&#150;vi).<br>
<br>On her return to Cambridge after her marriage in 1901, Margaret was tireless in the suffragist cause, serving from 1905 until 1918 as chair of the Cambridge society, which at its height had 550 members; she was prominent with Mrs Fawcett and others in the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, founded in 1897 to co-ordinate the work of associations like Cambridge's in a non-violent and constitutionalist campaign. Her acuteness of mind, sense of humour, and capacity to work with others were further tested during the First World War; within a few months of its outbreak over 250 refugees from Belgium arrived in Cambridge, and as chair of the town's hospitality committee she had to arrange for their accommodation, support, and employment, and to do so in conjunction with two other committees representing the university and the county. Among the other societies with which she was involved was the Cambridge and District Women Citizens' Association, of which in 1918 she was one of the founders and the first chair; its aims were &#145;to stir up in women a sense of the community spirit&#146; and to press for the removal of inequalities  (<span class="italic">Annual Report of the Cambridge and District Women Citizens' Association: Jubilee Year 1919&#150;1969</span>, 1969, 7).<br>
<br>A vigorous, self-confident, and forthright woman of independent mind, Margaret Bateson remarked that &#145;compassion acts like a strong poison upon those who have no need of it&#146;. Thus &#145;the happiest and busiest spinster &hellip; if compassionated for her lot by a woman bound to a tedious husband and a family of troublesome children&#146; was likely to feel on the margins of society. In contrast, she urged the joy and unselfishness of the spinster's home. &#145;It will be a school of training for your servants&#146; and &#145;an oasis of peace to numbers of people in trouble and perplexity. The married woman cannot compete with you here, in her home distracted by family cares&#146;. Admitting that &#145;all roads lead to the altar&#146;, she was glad (in 1895) that the professional woman &#145;is often in no hurry to reach the bourne&#146;  (M. Heitland, <span class="italic">Professional Women</span>, 1895, 130&#150;33). She herself was in no hurry, and it was not until 2 July 1901 that she married W. E. Heitland, a fellow of her late father's college<a href="#cosubject_58368"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_58368"></a><span class="headword">William Emerton Heitland</span>  (1847&#150;1935), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born on 21 December 1847 at Colkirk, Norfolk, the eldest child of Arthur Allan Heitland, an unsuccessful gentleman farmer, and his wife, Mary. They had two other sons and four daughters, of whom one son and three daughters reached full age. William was educated at Dedham grammar school and Shrewsbury School, where the classical teaching of the headmaster, Benjamin Hall Kennedy, was a lasting influence upon him. Relying on scholarships because of his family's straitened circumstances, he proceeded in 1867 to St John's College, Cambridge, and in 1871 graduated BA, being the most distinguished examinee (senior classic) in the classical tripos. He was immediately elected a fellow of St John's, which he remained until death. He was college lecturer in classics 1871&#150;85 and tutor 1883&#150;93.<br>
<br>Among Heitland's prolific writings on the classical world the most distinguished were <span class="italic">Agricola</span> (1921), on agricultural labour in antiquity, and the <span class="italic">History of the Roman Republic</span> (1909), which in its day was compared to Mommsen's great work. Heitland's scholarship was said to be &#145;consumed with a passionate desire to attain the truth&#146;  (Winstanley, 6&#150;7). His judiciousness led, in his advancing years, to an excessive balancing of arguments in his speeches in the senate and his writings on issues of the day; despite his occasional prophetic voice, he was ineffective in essays on the menace of class war and the value of eugenicist planning, or the need to construct a league of peace after the First World War, or, within Cambridge, to transfer resources from colleges to the university. His most capable polemic was <span class="italic">A Letter to a Lady, or, A Word with the Female Anti-Suffragists</span> (1915), directed against a local audience in a cause to which Heitland was committed for many years.<br>
<br>Heitland was a stimulating and kindly, though pernickety, teacher, discerning and encouraging talents hidden from others. He was also renowned for his freakish and often mordant humour, his fidelity to close friends and the strength of his aversions, and his insistence on a changeless college routine. Departure from the expected led his &#145;irritable and sensitive&#146; nature to take offence, and &#145;he found it difficult to forgive, and impossible to forget, wrongs which he thought he had suffered&#146;  (Winstanley).<br>
<br>Both Heitlands died at their home, Carmefield, Wordsworth Grove, Cambridge, William on 23 June 1935 and Margaret on 31 May 1938. He was buried in St Giles's cemetery, Cambridge, on 26 June 1935, she on 3 June 1938. Margaret Heitland's devotion to the cause of women manifested itself at the last in her will, under which she made Newnham College, Cambridge, her residuary legatee.<br>
