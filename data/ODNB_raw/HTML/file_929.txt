<span class="headword">Aylesbury, Sir  Thomas</span>, baronet  (1579/80&#150;1658), <span class="occ">patron of mathematics</span>, was born probably in early 1580, possibly in London, where some of his siblings were later baptized at St Andrew's, Holborn. He was the second son among at least eight children of William Aylesbury (<i>c</i>.1536&#150;1620) and his first wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1596), daughter of John Poole and niece of Sir Henry Poole of Saperton. His father's occupation is unknown, though descent from the Warwickshire branch of the ancient Aylesbury family is certain. A queen's scholar at Westminster School in 1596, he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in November 1598, aged eighteen, taking his BA in June 1602 and his MA on 19 June 1605. College records evidence his pursuit of mathematical and other studies at Christ Church until 1611, when he married, by licence issued on 3 October, Anne (1589&#150;1661), daughter of Francis Denman, rector of West Retford, Nottinghamshire, and widow of William Darell (<i>d</i>. 1610). They had six known children, of whom <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/931/', "William Aylesbury (bap. 1612, d. 1656)")</script> died in Jamaica, Barbara died at Antwerp in 1652, and Frances (<i>bap</i>. 1617, <i>d</i>. 1667) married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14328/', "Edward Hyde, later earl of Clarendon")</script>, in 1634 and became mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14325/', "Anne")</script>, first wife of James II and mother of the two queens Mary and Anne. On their mutual offspring's marriage, Aylesbury wrote a warm letter to Hyde's father describing Frances as &#145;a child that none could have from me but a good man&#146;  (MS Clarendon 129).<br>
<br>After leaving Oxford, Aylesbury became secretary to Charles Howard, earl of Nottingham and lord high admiral of England. Aylesbury was a friend of Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, and frequently visited him during his fourteen-year confinement in the Tower. His contemporary Richard Corbet admired his studious nature  (Corbet, 54&#150;7), noting his friendship with Thomas Harriot, pioneer of modern algebra and perhaps &#145;the greatest mathematician Oxford has produced&#146;  (Fauvel, Flood, and Wilson, 56), whose manuscripts were left to Aylesbury and Robert Sidney, Viscount Lisle, in 1621. Aylesbury was instrumental in the eventual publication of Harriot's <span class="italic">Artis analyticae praxis</span> (1631), engaging Walter Warner's work and the patronage of Algernon Percy, by then earl of Northumberland. Warner, with Harriot and Robert Hues, had enjoyed the hospitality and patronage of Henry Percy while he was imprisoned, and together they were known as his &#145;magi&#146;. Aylesbury took significant part in Edmund Bolton's plans, frustrated by the king's death in 1625, for a royal academy.<br>
<br>Aylesbury continued as secretary to George Villiers, marquess of Buckingham, when he became lord high admiral, and in 1625 was appointed surveyor-general, being acknowledged six years later by King Charles for &#145;his good, faithful &amp; acceptable service in the affair of the navy &amp; other ways, before he was Surveyor &amp; since&#146;  (Burton). Already a master of requests, Aylesbury was created baronet on 19 April 1627 and warden of Cranborne Chase, in Windsor Great Park. He usually spent the summer at Cranborne Lodge, welcoming men of science and giving, or finding, them patronage. Sadly, his accumulated collection of precious manuscripts and rare books was to be lost during the civil war. Aylesbury's involvement with the Northumberland circle and his Oxford connections, taken with his own employment and learning, combined to place him in a particularly significant position as a channel of communication between, and on behalf of, mathematicians of the period.<br>
<br>In 1631 Aylesbury was involved in trials of new machinery for improving the coinage by stamping rather than hammering. In 1632 he was granted a patent for life (renewed to him and his son William in 1637) for making and issuing weights and counterpoises for coinage. A small treatise by Aylesbury on the fineness of silver survives with some mathematical notes among Ussher's manuscripts  (TCD, MS 794, fols. 51&#150;61). Appointed as a commissioner of the mint in 1635, and later that year incorporated as MA by royal mandate at Cambridge, Aylesbury continued to work on improvements in the uniformity of the coinage. On 11 July 1640 he appears as a master of the mint in the warrant issued for a new standard coinage.<br>
<br>On 13 January 1643 Aylesbury was given leave to attend on the king as master of requests at Oxford, where his wife and family joined him a few months later. It seems likely that, as Burton conjectures, he took part in meetings while in Oxford which later led to the formation of the Royal Society. Having received on 26 June 1646 Fairfax's pass to leave Oxford with his family, Aylesbury petitioned the commission for compounding of delinquents to compound upon the articles for its surrender, being &#145;aged and sickly&#146;. He held little property at the time: apart from Cranborne Lodge and another small cottage also in the forest of Windsor, together worth about &pound;22 p.a., held for life and not compounded for, he had only a couple of decayed properties to compound for, together with goods and personal effects worth &pound;80, and the lease of a house in Dean's Yard in Westminster. In December 1646 he was fined &pound;59 and retired to Cranborne Lodge. Just before Aylesbury left England in 1649, he wrote a letter of encouragement to the young Christopher Wren.<br>
<br>Aylesbury moved first to Antwerp, and then in 1652, after his daughter, Barbara, was buried at Loosduyn, he settled in Breda, where he died on 29 June 1658 and was buried in the Great Church. Without surviving male issue, the baronetcy thus became extinct. The <i>rouwbord</i> (wooden memorial) erected in his honour at Breda by his son-in-law, Edward Hyde, was removed in 1798 but a transcript of the substantial Latin text survives  (see Bakker). Wood  (1.306) describes Aylesbury as: &#145;a learned man, and as great a lover and encourager of learning and learned men, especially of mathematicians, as any man in his time&#146;, and Burton notes that: &#145;in more than one instance, the publication of works of Science may justly be attributed to him, which but for his patronage &amp; encouragement would probably never have appeared&#146;.<br>
