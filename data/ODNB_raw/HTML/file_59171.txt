<span class="headword">Scott <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Middleton]</span>,  Jane Margaret</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1779, <em>d.</em> 1839), <span class="occ">theatre manager and actress</span>, one of at least four children of John Scott (1752&#150;1838) and his wife, Elizabeth (1750&#150;1829), was baptized at St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, on 6 June 1779. Her father was a prosperous London &#145;watercolour preparer&#146; who also sold optical instruments at 417 Strand. She was educated in music, and began her working life giving singing lessons. In 1804 John Scott converted a warehouse behind his shop for the performances of her and her pupils, and then demolished twelve properties in an adjoining alley, Bailey's Court, to erect the Sans Pareil Theatre (which later became the Adelphi). Here Jane Scott, like Charles Dibdin at his Sans Souci Theatre, offered a solo entertainment, singing her own compositions to her own piano accompaniment, varied with her father's light shows. They soon gathered a theatrical company; in 1806 the theatre was licensed for entertainments, in 1807 for pantomime, and by 1809 for burletta.<br>
<br>Jane Scott's artistic ambition met the challenge of modern entertainment. She encouraged performers who went on to substantial careers, such as Caroline Giroux (Mrs Serle), George Davidge, and Richard Flexmore, and with her core company she participated in the development of new kinds of theatre. Almost the only personal information we have from a contemporary is that she was generous towards the work of others. She was artistic director, she performed leading roles, and she wrote prolifically: the bills often boasted that the whole evening's entertainment was written by her. In 1809 came her first burletta, <span class="italic">Mary the Maid of the Inn</span>, and in December 1810 a melodrama, <span class="italic">Disappointments</span>; in 1811 she produced her first farce, <span class="italic">The Animated Effigy</span>, and a comic operetta, <span class="italic">The Lowland Romp</span>. Between 1806 and 1819 she wrote more than fifty stage pieces, comic and serious, spectacular and simple. These included translations from the French (<span class="italic">The Conjuror</span>, 1815) and French-style vaudeville (<span class="italic">The Dinner of Madelon</span>, 1816), but also English farces (<span class="italic">Whackham and Windham</span>, 1814), adaptations from the fiction of Maria Edgeworth and Walter Scott (<span class="italic">The Row of Ballynavogue</span>, 1817; <span class="italic">The Fire Goblin</span>, 1819), history plays (<span class="italic">The Forest Knight</span>, 1813), fairy plays (<span class="italic">Fairy Legends</span>, 1818), topical plays (<span class="italic">The Fortunate Youth</span> 1818), and Gothic melodramas&#151;one with a subplot for the dancer Giroux (<span class="italic">Asgard the Demon Hunter</span>, 1812), another with a leading role for herself (<span class="italic">Camilla the Amazon</span>, 1817)&#151;and at least one pantomime each year, accommodating the skills of rope-walking monkeys and juvenile clog dancers. She wrote one melodrama, <span class="italic">The Old Oak Chest</span> (1816), that was printed and widely staged beyond her own theatre. This play, a story of oppressive rulers and heroic pirates, was popular in the illegal cheap theatres that sprang up to challenge the beleaguered theatres royal.<br>
<br>The Sans Pareil was itself politically significant: it was sanctioned by the lord chamberlain, Lord Dartmouth, and challenged the long-standing duopoly of the stage in London with new providers of entertainment. Jane Scott and her father, coming from outside the established theatrical networks, thus became participants in the battle for a &#145;free&#146; stage. Jane Scott's theatre is also embedded in the artistic developments of her time, mediating Gothic and Romantic sensibility to pleasure-seekers in the nascent West End. She had her finger on the pulse of a new world of entertainment for all, and her management of the theatre she created is important for its responsive and intelligent reading of the new audiences and the provision of exciting work for them to enjoy.<br>
<br>It is indicative of her practical, self-sufficient relationship to her work that Jane Scott never appeared elsewhere than in her own theatre, and when she retired in April 1819 (her father having sold the theatre at a handsome profit) she never appeared again, nor published any of her writing. On 11 April 1822 she married a half-pay naval officer, John Davies Middleton (1790&#150;1867), and by the terms of her settlement was able to retire on a comfortable personal income to her own house, Mole House, Hersham, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. Her father went on to buy the Olympic Theatre and thus to invest, from 1830, in the managerial talents of another woman, Madame Vestris. When he died in 1838 he left the Olympic (and an inn in Hersham) to his daughter. Jane Scott had no children. She died of breast cancer on 6 December 1839 in Walton-on-Thames and was buried in the family vault in the parish church of St Mary with St John. Her legacy of a model of theatre work radically different from the pompous vacuities of the &#145;legitimate&#146; stage was long either vilified or ignored by critics and historians, and only began to be recognized at the end of the twentieth century.<br>
