<span class="headword">Kirwan,  Walter Blake</span>  (1754&#150;1805), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland dean of Killala</span>, was born at Gortha, co. Galway, into a Roman Catholic family. He was the elder son of Patrick Fitz Thomas Kirwan of Galway and Mary, second daughter of Walter Blake of Carrowbrowne. He was educated at the English College at St Omer. At the age of seventeen he accompanied a relative to St Croix in the West Indies. Much affected by the climate and by the cruelty of that society he left after six years and went to the University of Louvain, where he took holy orders and was appointed professor of natural and moral philosophy. In 1778 he became chaplain to the Neapolitan ambassador at the British court, and the eloquence of the sermons which he preached in London in this capacity attracted marked attention.<br>
<br>In 1787 Kirwan left the Roman Catholic church, and on 24 June preached his first sermon to a protestant congregation in St Peter's Church, Dublin. He continued to officiate at St Peter's, where he proved to be an immensely popular speaker, for several years. His services were eagerly sought for charity sermons, and churches where he preached were often overrun by crowds eager to attend. It was not uncommon for collections of up to &pound;1200 to be taken on such occasions. In 1789 Kirwan was collated by the archbishop of Dublin to the prebend of Howth, co. Dublin; in the same year he was preferred to the living of St Nicholas Without in the city of Dublin. On 22 September 1798 Kirwan married Wilhelmina, the youngest daughter of Goddard Richards of Grange, co. Wexford; the couple had two daughters and two sons, one of whom, Antony la Touche Kirwan, later became dean of Limerick.<br>
<br>In 1800 Kirwan was appointed dean of Killala. He died at his house, Mount Pleasant, near Dublin, on 27 October 1805. He was survived by his wife, who was granted a crown pension of &pound;300 per annum for life, with reversion to her daughters. A volume of Kirwan's sermons was published posthumously in 1816, reaching a second edition later that year.<br>
