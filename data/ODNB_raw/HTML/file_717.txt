<span class="headword">Arundell,  Humphrey</span>  (1512/13&#150;1550), <span class="occ">rebel</span>, was born in 1512 or 1513, being twenty-three in 1536, the son and heir of Roger Arundell (<i>d</i>. 1536), landowner, of Helland, Cornwall, and his wife, Joanne or Joan (<i>d</i>. 1537), daughter of Humphrey Calwodely. Roger Arundell was a younger brother of the military commander and receiver of the duchy of Cornwall, Sir John Arundell of Lanherne (<i>d</i>. 1545). No family in pre-Reformation Cornwall outranked the Lanherne Arundells. They were seised of extensive estates across the western counties, and their status was marked in 1525 by the offer of a barony, which Sir John Arundell declined. The traditional piety of the Lanherne Arundells was reflected in their association with the Carthusian order, and in the chantry at St Mawgan endowed by Sir John Arundell. On the death of his father on 12 June 1536, Humphrey Arundell came into a substantial landed inheritance in Cornwall and Devon. He may have seen some service in the French war, and certainly had an association with St Michael's Mount in Cornwall: John Hooker and John Foxe both describe Arundell as governor, presumably of the small garrison stationed there. He married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1565), daughter of Sir John Fulford; they had two sons, Humphrey and Richard, and a daughter. Arundell also had an illegitimate son, Giles, on whose behalf in 1544 he leased some land from John Winslade, his future comrade-in-arms.<br>
<br>Arundell made little impact upon his native shire before becoming a rebel leader in 1549. He did not serve as a JP; the highest official position he achieved was as collector of taxes in Pydar and Powder hundreds, at a time when gentle status was increasingly defined by a place on the magistrates' bench. His sense of resentment would have been compounded by the exclusion of his two cousins, Sir John Arundell of Lanherne (<i>d</i>. 1557) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/725/', "Sir Thomas Arundell of Wardour (c.1502&#150;1552)")</script>, from the commission of the peace by the evangelical regime of Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, in 1547. What is known of Humphrey Arundell before the 1549 western rising is culled largely from proceedings in chancery and Star Chamber. In 1543, for instance, he was accused of assembling an armed gang that forcibly entered property belonging to Walter Kendall in order to steal cattle. However, the modern verdicts on Arundell, that he was &#145;an unquiet person&#146;  (Rowse, 263) and &#145;clearly a troublemaker&#146;  (Fletcher and MacCulloch, 51), are unfair. Such allegations of riotous behaviour were very common among the Tudor gentry, often signifying little more than the formal initiation of a legal process to recover land. Had the crown entertained serious doubts about Arundell, it would hardly have appointed him to the grand jury arraigned in the aftermath of the 1548 religious disturbances in Cornwall.<br>
<br>Arundell earned his place in history by his leadership of the Cornish host during the great rebellion in the western counties in summer 1549. According to their official indictments, Arundell and Winslade were jointly responsible for gathering a thousand of the commons together at Bodmin on 6 June 1549. Though not of the top flight among the local gentry, Arundell was well known there, since his seat at Helland lay within a league (about 3 miles) of the town. The Bodmin demonstration anticipated by three days the introduction of the first English <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, and the defence of the traditional liturgy was its primary inspiration. Over the previous two years, a series of royal injunctions virtually outlawed the saint veneration that suffused popular religion. At Bodmin this meant an end to the cult of St Petroc, evangelist of the Cornish, whose shrine apparently survived Henry VIII's own campaign against holy relics. The rebel petitions signed by Arundell demanded that the church be returned to the liturgically conservative position defined by the 1539 <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span>. An earlier, lost, set of grievances indicates that certain of the Cornish also desired a prayer book in their own language. It seems that Arundell was able to muster support from the remote western and southern hundreds of Cornwall, where Cornish was still spoken, as well as from his own country.<br>
<br>On Whit Monday, four days after Arundell and Winslade marshalled the popular protests at Bodmin, the Devon village of Sampford Courtenay defied the crown and compelled its priest to repudiate the new English prayer book. The demonstrators were soon to be joined by the Cornish under the common leadership of Arundell and other local gentlemen and priests. The major rebellion that ensued is most fully described by the protestant antiquary, John Hooker of Exeter. Hooker mentions Arundell only in passing, preferring to concentrate on Robert Welsh, the Devon priest who probably co-ordinated the siege of Exeter. Nevertheless, Arundell was the first of the &#145;chief captaynes&#146; to sign the list of grievances, implying precedence among the commanders of the rebel army. Correspondence between the privy council and the king's lieutenant in the west parts, John Russell, first Baron Russell, also indicates that Arundell was the ringleader of the revolt. As such, he was singled out for the harshest of punishments in its wake.<br>
<br>After flirting with a policy of conciliation, Somerset at last determined on a military solution to the crisis in the south-west. Cavalry and mercenaries were deployed against the insurrection, and the privy council threatened with forfeiture of goods any subject who spread rebel propaganda or &#145;Humfrey Arundell's poyson&#146;  (Pocock, 37). The protesters had not sought a fight; but when the government forced the issue, Arundell responded with courage and a degree of military skill. His men were well disciplined, marching under the banner of the five wounds of Christ, with the consecrated host in their midst. Exeter was besieged for six weeks, and a mine was laid under the city wall. East of the city, an estimated six thousand rebels defended Clyst St Mary on 4 August. Judging by Hooker's account, they put up stout resistance, but were unable to withstand a royal army that included Italian gunners and German landsknechts under William Grey, thirteenth Baron Grey of Wilton. The town was fired, and perhaps a thousand insurgents slaughtered. Even now, Arundell was able to effect a retreat to Sampford Courtenay, where he reorganized his forces; Russell, who had thought the campaign won, was taken by surprise. The last stand of the rebels was on 17 August. Outnumbered four to one, they were defeated, but not before Arundell led a counter-attack that caused great fear among royal troops. On Russell's own arrival in the field, the insurgents broke camp and fled, Arundell among them. Though many escaped, their commander was apprehended at Launceston in Cornwall.<br>
<br>Arundell had levied war against Edward VI, and thus his fate was sealed. Under close guard, he was sent to the Tower of London to be examined. A transcript of his interrogation on 22 October survives in the state papers. It is a valuable document, because it illuminates one of the paradoxes of early modern rebellion: that popular insurrections were frequently led by the gentry. According to Arundell's own admission, he was exceedingly reluctant to become involved in the Bodmin protest; so much so that, on hearing of the unquiet temper of the people, he took refuge in a nearby wood. When his pregnant wife summoned him home again, he was intercepted by the rebels and compelled to become their leader. Whether or not Arundell was telling the truth, his confession illustrates the desire of the commons to win over the gentry to their cause. A more damning account of Arundell's conduct was offered by one Kestell, his secretary, who informed on his master during the uprising. In any case, Arundell's protestations cut no ice with the new regime of John Dudley, earl of Warwick, which found him guilty of treason. On 27 January 1550 he was taken to Tyburn and hanged as a traitor. The rebel leaders dying beside him included Thomas Holmes, a servant of Sir John Arundell; John Bury, a servant of Sir Thomas Denys; and Winslade. Their heads and quarters were displayed on London's city gates.<br>
<br>Arundell's motivations for involving himself in the 1549 rebellion were mixed. His family&#151;ancient, pious, and Catholic&#151;viewed the evangelical faction surrounding the young king with suspicion and distaste. As the commissions of the peace in Cornwall and Devon came to be dominated by Godolphins and Carews, protestants and <i>arrivistes</i>, the Arundells of Lanherne were frozen out of local government. In part, Humphrey Arundell's was a political protest. Chance also played its part. At the critical moment in 1549, Sir John Arundell of Lanherne, head of the family, was absent from Cornwall. In other circumstances, the rebels might well have turned to him for leadership. As it was, they appealed to his cousin Humphrey Arundell. It was not a bad choice, since Humphrey had military experience to back his traditional understanding of the Catholic faith. His stoicism in battle bears comparison with the Cornish rebel leader of 1497, Michael Joseph an Gof. Mustering the people in a great demonstration against innovations in religion enabled Arundell to reclaim lost family pride. It also allowed him to pursue a personal grudge against Sir Richard Grenville, in the eyes of the government the principal gentleman of east Cornwall. Grenville epitomized the new protestant order prevailing in court and country under Edward VI, and was a particular focus of popular hatred in 1549. According to Arundell's Tower confession, the rebel commander made his way to Launceston after the battle of Sampford Courtenay only to declare himself to Grenville, where the latter was imprisoned. Russell told a different story, of Arundell's last-ditch attempt to persuade the people of Launceston to murder Grenville and the other gentlemen incarcerated there.<br>
<br>Arundell's act of rebellion meant that his lands were forfeit to the crown. Russell acted swiftly to redistribute confiscated rebel property among his affinity of loyal protestant gentry. Arundell's lordships, manors, and advowsons in Cornwall and Devon, worth &pound;108 18<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. annually, were granted to Sir Gawen Carew before the rebel leader had even been captured. Carew's tenure was confirmed by the king in March 1550, thus denying the rights of Arundell's widow, Elizabeth. She took Thomas Cary as her second husband, and died on 24 November 1565.<br>
