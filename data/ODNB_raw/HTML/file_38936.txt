<span class="headword">Bull,  Hedley Norman</span>  (1932&#150;1985), <span class="occ">scholar of international relations</span>, was born on 10 June 1932 in Englewood Hospital, Burwood, Sydney, New South Wales, the third and youngest child of (Joseph) Norman Bull (1891&#150;1972), insurance broker, and his wife, Doris Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hordern (1893&#150;1967), whose family had developed a chain of department stores in Australia. He had a stable childhood in Sydney, attending Burwood primary school (<i>c</i>.1937&#150;43) and Fort Street high school, Petersham (<i>c</i>.1944&#150;8), one of the most prominent in the New South Wales state system.<br>
<br>At Sydney University (1949&#150;52) Bull read history and philosophy, took an active part in student journalism and societies, and had a busy social life. Exceptionally, he completed both honours courses in four calendar years, gaining a first in philosophy and a second in history. The most important influence on his thinking was John Anderson, Challis professor of philosophy: his iconoclasm, tough realism, devotion to teaching, and love of grappling with statements of a contrary position in their strongest form, all left their mark on him. Bull later wrote: &#145;My greatest intellectual debt is to John Anderson &hellip; the impact of his mind and his example have been the deepest factors in shaping the outlook of many of us whom he taught&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Anarchical Society: a Study of Order in World Politics</span>, 1977, x). While at Sydney, he became engaged to a fellow history student, Frances Mary Lawes (<i>b</i>. 1930). On 13 March 1954 they married at Oxford. Mary Bull developed an expertise in Commonwealth history, becoming a research assistant to Margery Perham. They had three adopted children.<br>
<br>Bull arrived at University College, Oxford, in 1953 with the help of a Woolley travelling fellowship. He had intended to do the BPhil in philosophy, but was discouraged by the emphasis on linguistic analysis. Instead he did the BPhil in politics under a galaxy of teachers, including Herbert Hart, Isaiah Berlin, Kenneth Wheare, John Plamenatz, and Norman Chester. He showed no interest in the academic field of international relations, not well developed at Oxford at the time. After Oxford he intended to teach in Britain for some years before returning to Australia. About to take up a post in political philosophy at Aberdeen, he was unexpectedly offered an assistant lectureship in international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) by Charles Manning, Montague Burton professor of international relations there since 1930. The future shape of Bull's career and intellectual interests was settled.<br>
<br>At the LSE, learning his trade while practising it, Bull was particularly influenced by his colleague Martin Wight, whose lectures on international theory he attended. As Bull wrote in 1976: &#145;Ever since that time I have felt in the shadow of Martin Wight's thought&#151;humbled by it, a constant borrower from it, always hoping to transcend it but never able to escape from it&#146;  (&#145;Martin Wight and the theory of international relations&#146;, <span class="italic">British Journal of International Studies</span>, 2/2, July 1976, 101). He was impressed by Wight's exposition of three distinctive traditions of thought (labelled realist, rationalist, and revolutionist) in terms of which debates about international relations in any era could be understood.<br>
<br>Bull's first published academic work was on disarmament, on which he was critical but also constructive. In 1957&#150;8 he was reinforced in this approach when, with the help of a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, he visited the main centres in the USA of new thinking about arms control. In 1959&#150;60 he acted as rapporteur for a study group on arms control of the newly formed Institute for Strategic Studies in London. The resulting book, <span class="italic">The Control of the Arms Race</span> (1961), quickly gained worldwide recognition as a rigorous exposition of the view that selective measures of arms limitation had a better chance of contributing to international order than did the utopian pursuit of general and complete disarmament.<br>
<br>Much of Bull's subsequent writing was on the nature of international society and the appropriate means of studying it. In a celebrated article in <span class="italic">World Politics</span> in April 1966, under the deceptively mild title &#145;International theory: the case for a classical approach&#146;, he attacked certain aspirants to the &#145;scientific&#146; study of international relations with characteristic gusto. Although his controversialism could occasionally hurt, it was never vicious or mean-spirited, but rather reflected a love of intellectual combat. Tall, well built, and self-assured, he assaulted political cant and academic folly with a twinkle in the eye, a smile, and a real appreciation of outlandish viewpoints.<br>
<br>The remarkable course of his sadly brief career reflected the quality of Bull's published work. After being promoted to a readership at LSE in 1963, in 1965&#150;7 he was appointed the first director of the newly formed arms control and disarmament unit at the Foreign Office in London. In May 1965 he took up UK citizenship.<br>
<br>In 1967 Bull was tempted back to Australia, to the professorship of international relations at the Australian National University, Canberra. It was there, helped by study visits to India, the USA, and Oxford, that he wrote his major work, <span class="italic">The Anarchical Society: a Study of Order in World Politics</span> (1977). This is a magisterially clear statement of the view that the system of sovereign states, although lacking a strong central authority, constitutes a society with common norms and institutions. Force, law, revolutionary and conservative perspectives all have a part to play. The book displayed an understanding of &#145;third-world&#146; criticisms of Western dominance that was to be the theme of later studies, including <span class="italic">The Expansion of International Society</span>, which he edited with Adam Watson (1984).<br>
<br>In 1977 Bull returned to Oxford, taking up the Montague Burton professorship of international relations and a fellowship at Balliol College. In both Canberra and Oxford he played a key part in building up departments of international relations: his evident intellectual distinction helped make the subject academically respectable, he gained a formidable reputation as a supervisor of graduate students, and he managed to continue with his own research and writing. In 1984 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy. He died at his home at 5 Warnborough Road, Oxford, on 18 May 1985 after a long fight against cancer, and was cremated four days later at Oxford crematorium. His wife survived him.<br>
