<span class="headword">Standidge, Sir  Samuel</span>  (1725&#150;1801), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was born in relatively comfortable circumstances in Bridlington Quay of old Hull mercantile stock. Little is known of his family life beyond nineteenth century gossip. He was a younger son of a second marriage, cast adrift, it was said, with nothing but his father's assurance that &#145;Samuel had brains enough to work his own way&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). In fact he was sent to Hull and trained for a lucrative captaincy in transatlantic trade, where his undoubted adventures&#151;captured by privateers off Hispaniola in 1744, storm bound on the Nantucket coast in 1749&#151;were less important than mercantile skills acquired as master or owner serving Hull's America merchants, making enough in one voyage to purchase a 130-acre farm, renamed New York, in Preston (Holderness). More significantly, he became acquainted with the whale fishery while importing oil from Nantucket, its principal source. Although not an owner&#151;though he may have been a captain&#151;during Hull's first whaling ventures in 1754, when war in America disrupted supplies, it was he who revived the industry by sending the old whaler <i>Berry</i> to Greenland in 1766 after colonial-caught oil was taxed, and proved the importance of seal skins as supplementary income. By 1769 he had three whalers&#151;<i>Berry</i>, <i>Britannia</i>, and <i>British Queen</i>&#151;and his enterprise so encouraged others that Hull dominated British whaling into the nineteenth century. His knowledge of the Arctic was acknowledged when he was consulted by Daines Barrington and he tried, unsuccessfully, to mount an Arctic expedition of his own in 1775.<br>
<br>Standidge owned six whalers altogether, continuing in the trade until the 1780s, though he retired from the sea about 1770 as one of the first generation of specialist shipowners. Though out-of-season Baltic voyages were common to gain maximum deployment for whalers, Standidge preferred long-term government charters for moving troops and supplies. In his most lucrative venture <i>Berry</i> was sent to New York in 1775 and earned &pound;17,000 in seven years' service, but his most prestigious charter took three vessels to the Russo&#150;Turkish war in 1789, when their part in defeating the Turkish fleet brought him a Russian &#145;knighthood&#146; and a fabulous gold and topaz jewel containing a lock of Catherine the Great's hair.<br>
<br>Throughout his business life Standidge was variously called&#151;or called himself&#151;master mariner, merchant, shipowner, and shipbuilder, though this latter may have stemmed from his granddaughter's marriage into the Walton shipbuilding family. How far he practised these professions concurrently is unclear, but he was certainly an all-round maritime man, latterly designated &#145;gentleman&#146;. It was natural that he was involved in Hull Trinity House, of which he was five times warden, and took an active part (with William Hammond) in establishing its navigation school in 1787 to ease the shortage of competent master mariners as trade boomed in response to industrialization. He held all the senior borough offices starting with high sheriff in 1775, but was not mayor until 1795, a fortuitous year since he was knighted for delivering a loyal address following an attack on the king. He retired from business three years later.<br>
<br>Standidge was a dissenter who lived quietly and devoted himself to his whaling fleet, of which he was proud enough to have a panoramic view painted in 1769. He married on 15 October 1767 Mary Spooner, daughter of a York mercer who died in 1803, but had only one daughter and very few relations. He did not figure largely in the town's social life or, so far as is known, enter into mercantile partnerships. He bought scattered properties in the East Riding of Yorkshire and a country house at Thorngumbald (where he built a dissenting chapel), but died at his High Street house in Hull on 10 February 1801 and was buried in St Mary's Church. He left &pound;76,000 to his great-grandson, Samuel Standidge Walton, and the Standidge mercantile line died out.<br>
