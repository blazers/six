<span class="headword">Fenwick, Sir  John</span>, third baronet  (<em>c.</em>1644&#150;1697), <span class="occ">army officer and Jacobite conspirator</span>, was born at Wallington, Northumberland, the only son (with two sisters) of Sir William Fenwick, second baronet (<i>c</i>.1617&#150;1676), of Wallington, Northumberland, and his first wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1665), daughter of Henry Stapilton of Wighill, Yorkshire. His grandfather was the parliamentarian MP <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9302/', "Sir John Fenwick (1579&#150;c.1658)")</script>, and his father was a moderate parliamentarian MP as well.<h2>
<a name="Marriageandearlycareer"></a>Marriage and early career</h2>Fenwick was a delicate child, whose mother's excessive devotion caused his father's lifelong hatred. On 14 July 1663, aged about nineteen, he married at St James's Clerkenwell Lady Mary [<a name="cosubject_74441"></a><span class="headword">Lady Mary Fenwick</span>  (<em>c.</em>1646/1650&#150;1708)<span class="occ"></span>], eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13886/', "Charles Howard, first earl of Carlisle (d. 1685)")</script>, and Anne Howard (<i>d</i>. 1703), daughter of Edward, first Baron Howard of Escrick. Carlisle's non-royalist past, like that of Fenwick's father, encouraged the couple's reaction into extreme loyalism. Sir William embezzled and wasted Lady Mary's dowry of &pound;5000; most of the family's financial troubles, publicly blamed on Sir John, were his father's fault. When alleged to be enjoying a lavish lifestyle in London, they were actually struggling on &pound;200 a year. Nevertheless, according to Thomas Bruce, second earl of Ailesbury, &#145;neither he nor she taking any care of their affairs &hellip; they burned their candles at both ends&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Ailesbury</span>, 1.389). Though Ailesbury, who would save his own life at Fenwick's expense, always denigrated him, Lady Mary herself admitted that he &#145;never saw his estate in many years but when he went to choose a Parliament man&#146;  (Hampson). They lived in the new West End, with a house in St James's Street from 1682 to 1693. Their three sons and daughter died young.<br>
<br>Fenwick began an army career. He was a captain in a short-lived regiment in 1667, obtained a cornetcy in the queen's Life Guards in 1672, and was gradually promoted to lieutenant-colonel by 1681, while serving in higher temporary ranks elsewhere. He combined his military career with a reputation for dissipation. In February 1671 he fought a duel with John Churchill, later first duke of Marlborough, after a quarrel at a masquerade, and was one of a party of drunken courtiers, headed by two dukes, who murdered a beadle outside a brothel. This behaviour was perhaps appropriate to a gentleman of Charles II's privy chamber, an appointment Fenwick received in 1671 and retained until Charles's death. One particularly ill-informed lampoon claimed that Charles had knighted Fenwick after seducing Lady Mary, but Fenwick was never knighted. His letters written from prison in 1696 show their underlying devotion. However, he retained the manners of a Restoration courtier, and in 1686 was still trailing ludicrously after the reigning court beauty. Fenwick was a good horse-breeder, but the legend which makes him a major introducer of foreign stocks at Charles's behest confuses him with his grandfather and namesake, Charles I's master of the stud.<br>
<br>Fenwick saw service abroad when from 1672 to 1674 he was a captain in the Royal English infantry regiment serving with the French army against the Dutch and empire, campaigning under Turenne. After England left the Third Anglo-Dutch War, he went in 1675 to the Netherlands, having been strongly recommended by James, duke of York, to William of Orange, and was made colonel on 3 September <span class="smallcap">NS</span> of an under-strength English regiment in the Anglo-Dutch brigade. Fenwick attempted in vain to recruit for it in England over the winter, as he had been unable to match the better terms offered by French recruiters, and early in 1676 he suggested to William that he might raise the English regiments' pay. The wanton insult with which William replied, determining their future relations, is recorded in several versions: Lady Mary's is: &#145;&#147;I make their pay better,[?] I would not, Sir, go to that door to oblige an Englishman&#148; &hellip; &#147;Then, Sir, I am sorry I am in your service&#148; &hellip; &#147;You may quit it when you please &hellip;&#148;&#146;  (&#145;Life of Fenwick&#146;, BL, Add. MS 47608, fol. 168). Fenwick determined to campaign that summer for his own reputation, further alienating William. He served with distinction, but was abruptly called home by his father's death, about June 1676.<h2>
<a name="Baronetandcourtier"></a>Baronet and courtier</h2>Fenwick found that Sir William had burdened the estate with &pound;4000 debt and &pound;1900 annuities. He was driven to sell his lead mines for absurdly low prices to the younger William Blackett (1657&#150;1705), who made his fortune by them.<br>
<br>Fenwick was returned in his father's place for Northumberland on 15 March 1677, probably without a contest. On 19 February 1678 he was made colonel of a new infantry regiment, which he raised among his northern gentry neighbours; it served in Flanders, but was disbanded in March 1679. In the exclusion crisis Fenwick was a tory, but represented the views of the Northumberland gentry, including their suspicion of papists, rather than those of the court. In 1679 he not only refused to support for the other county seat a servant of James's suspected of popery, but contributed &pound;1000 for his successful rival's campaign. He was re-elected for the three Exclusion Parliaments, and was a JP and deputy lieutenant in Northumberland. The continuing factional dispute set him against the lord lieutenant, Henry Cavendish, second duke of Newcastle; but he was made governor of Holy Island on 1 May 1681, and was re-elected to the Commons in 1685 amid local rejoicing. During the rising of Archibald Campbell, ninth earl of Argyll, in Scotland following the accession of James II and VII he left parliament and went north as a brigadier-general to command the regular and local militia forces against a possible extension of Argyll's campaign to the borders. The claim that he carried up Monmouth's attainder from the Commons to the Lords was invented to justify his own attainder.<br>
<br>Fenwick, while maintaining his independent line in the county during James II's Catholicizing campaign, was probably more compliant before James himself. He became colonel of a regiment of horse (the later 3rd dragoon guards) on 6 November 1687, and was recommended as court candidate for Northumberland in 1688. During the campaign against William, Fenwick, promoted major-general on 6 November 1688, led westwards a force intended to protect Bristol, but in the panic over officers' defections he was recalled. In early December he commanded 5000 men around Windsor, but was beset by desertions among his men and plots to seize him among his officers. After James's first flight, he refused to head the provisional government's military force. He escorted James back from Faversham with his life guards. As the king prepared to flee again, he surrendered to him his commissions, prompting at some point William's sneer that he would not make him a corporal though James had made him a brigadier. Parting from him at Rochester, James urged him to seek re-election and support his rights. However, Fenwick's solvency collapsed once he lost government office. He had to sell Wallington to Blackett for &pound;4000 and a &pound;2000 annuity for his and Lady Mary's lives. As he was still pursued by his and Sir William's creditors&#151;Slingsby Bethel the republican was the most troublesome&#151;little was available for him.<h2>
<a name="Jacobiteconspirator"></a>Jacobite conspirator</h2>In March 1689 Fenwick and other former courtiers of James II were fomenting disturbances in the Borders near Carlisle to assist the invasion of Scotland which, James had written, he would shortly be mounting from Ireland. When this did not take place, and government troops appeared, they surrendered or drifted away. Fenwick was arrested in the north in April and committed to the Tower on 13 May. He was bailed in October and discharged on 28 November. He apparently never strayed far from London again. Meanwhile, Lady Mary had begun involving herself in every Jacobite intrigue from encouraging weavers' riots to exhorting the French to invade. The turncoat songwriter Thomas D'Urfey caricatured her as &#145;Lady Addleplot&#146; in the 1691 play <span class="italic">Love for Money</span>. The two other main former soldier-courtiers prominent in Jacobite conspiracy, Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe and Edward Sackville, also had active wives.<br>
<br>Fenwick was intended for military command in any Jacobite rising to be held in 1689&#150;90. His own former court position enabled Williamite military officers to approach him with protestations of continuing secret loyalty, real or feigned; he was not good at discriminating. During the 1690 invasion crisis, he was again temporarily sent to the Tower.<br>
<br>After James returned from Ireland to St Germain, he appointed a &#145;select Number&#146;&#151;this was apparently the group's actual title (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 11.577; BL, Add. MS 47608, fol. 120)&#151;of six Jacobites to manage his affairs and send him information of political events and secret military and naval intelligence, the most prominent of whom was probably the earl of Ailesbury. Fenwick was distinctly a second-rank figure in the &#145;select number&#146;, and his imprudent conduct sometimes justified this. In April and May 1691 Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe and he displayed overt and sometimes indecent rudeness to Queen Mary in St James's Park, openly mocking her when the French captured Mons almost under William's eyes, until they were forbidden access. William, indignant that anyone else should insult her, declared (as in several of his quarrels) that, were he a private man, he would challenge Fenwick; and remembered the incident vindictively.<br>
<br>Fenwick and the &#145;select number&#146; were expected to try to win back leading Williamites to assist in restoring James, but disagreements over methods and implications divided leading Jacobites into two factions. The &#145;compounders&#146; believed that major concessions must be made in negotiations with politicians supporting William's government in order to restore James peacefully. Fenwick and most of the &#145;select number&#146; became &#145;non-compounders&#146;, who thought that these concessions would place James and his supporters in their enemies' hands, and believed that only a large-scale French invasion could bring a successful restoration. Personal hostilities reinforced distrust: one important contact of the compounders was Marlborough, but Fenwick distrusted him and his main Jacobite go-between, Edward Sackville. As relations worsened, the conspirators &#145;had no Communication one with another: There was a Distinction made between Compounders and Non-compounders; and so we had no Conversation together&#146;  (Fenwick's second confession, <span class="italic">JHC</span>, 11.579). Most of Fenwick's information on compounding negotiations was secondhand, out of context, and sometimes inaccurate: this would make confirming it difficult when his life depended on this.<br>
<br>If the non-compounders' strategy was to be plausible, the English Jacobites must rise to support the French invasion. At the most promising opportunity, the French invasion attempt from La Hogue in May 1692, the &#145;select number&#146; failed to provide an urgently needed overall organizing authority in London. Quarrels between Fenwick and Sackville over which was the elder major-general with the right to command the force helped paralyse preparations. As the crisis approached Fenwick, Sackville, and Oglethorpe met; &#145;but all we considered of, was how to save ourselves from being taken up&#146;  (Fenwick's second confession, <span class="italic">JHC</span>, 11.579). When it came Fenwick, put in the proclamation of 9 May, just escaped arrest, losing his breeches, and hid successfully.<br>
<br>The disaster at La Hogue threw the initiative to the compounders. In April 1693 Charles Middleton, second earl of Middleton, crossed over to become a Jacobite secretary of state, eclipsing his colleague, John Drummond, earl of Melfort. Middleton prepared to have James issue a declaration containing major concessions. Too late, the &#145;select number&#146; secretly sent over Ailesbury with an offer from tory admirals to connive at an invasion. Once the declaration had been issued, the &#145;select number&#146; were wrong-footed. They met at Fenwick's house to send out agents to stir up corn riots, following Lady Mary's example in exploiting social discontent, but without support from the Jacobite court their appeals for a further invasion attempt were fruitless.<h2>
<a name="Theassassinationplot"></a>The assassination plot</h2>The death of Mary II in December 1694, leaving the unpopular William alone, revived the enthusiasm of the &#145;select number&#146;. In April 1695 they sent over a carefully prepared scheme to finance the Jacobite cause by large-scale coining in France, in which several rich men were ready to invest &pound;20,000. That month Fenwick found that Robert Charnock and other officers of Colonel John Parker's secret Jacobite regiment were planning William's assassination (under the euphemism kidnapping), misled into supposing that James would soon send a warrant for it. Fenwick declared his (justified) disbelief in this and violently opposed the scheme. However, one of his subsequent confessions, claiming that his arguments and trickery alone had prevented the attempt, was clearly exaggerated: Charnock would not have become so absorbed by Fenwick's conversation as to forget he had a regicide prepared. Fenwick and three others of the &#145;select number&#146;, the brewer Sir John Friend and several officers of Parker's, meeting twice in May 1695 (just after the Act of Grace pardoned most earlier Jacobite intrigue), sent Charnock to France with a memorial arguing that a French invasion 10,000 strong, launched that summer before William's return from the continent, would be sufficient to take advantage of English disillusion with William. Yet only Charnock's repeated emphasis that the mission would be futile without it drove them to add a promise that they would have 2000 Jacobite horse raised and ready to join the landing. Their immediate willingness to swell the number to 4000 or even 10,000, and their argument, when prosecuted, that such a small offer could not be made seriously, shows their unreliability. Fenwick added a request for a new commission as major-general.<br>
<br>Charnock, returning, found the point he had insisted upon compromised. After Parker had fled to France, his officers had looked to Fenwick to command them in a sudden crisis. On 10 June 1695 Fenwick joined several of them in what was intended as a formal propaganda celebration in Drury Lane for the birthday of James Francis Edward, prince of Wales. It became a drunken riot in which they were routed by local butchers and arrested. Rather than preparing the promised help for the invasion, they were now awaiting fines or imprisonment. Fenwick was acquitted on proving, humiliatingly, that when the serious rioting began he was already too drunk to stand.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, when James that winter did receive a small French force with which to launch an invasion, according to James Fitzjames, duke of Berwick, overall general of the intended English risings, Fenwick was to command the putative 2000 horse in London and the south-east, though Brigadier-General Sir George Barclay was sent over as his second in command. Fenwick complained that he and his &#145;select number&#146; colleagues received no warning of the coming invasion. Barclay swiftly concluded that the London Jacobites were hopelessly unready to rise, and turned to plotting assassination. Since Fenwick had so opposed the previous spring's plot, Barclay avoided approaching him. The assassination plot was exposed on 23 February 1696, before the invasion was quite ready&#151;though, Ailesbury claimed, Fenwick had a brief outburst of wild optimism. Virtually all Jacobites had to go into hiding.<h2>
<a name="Arrestandimprisonment"></a>Arrest and imprisonment</h2>George Porter, a leading assassin who turned king's evidence, had attended the meetings which sent Charnock to France; and he persuaded the actor Cardell Goodman, who had not been there at the crucial moments, to be the necessary second witness. This, by contemporary convention, would allow Fenwick to deny the mission in his last speech. Fenwick and his fellow of the &#145;select number&#146; William Herbert, Viscount Montgomery, later second marquess of Powis, remained in hiding while their wives tried to bribe Porter to cross to France, but on 6 May he entrapped their agent. In mid-June Fenwick fled from London through Kent, hoping to escape to France. However, Charles Talbot, duke of Shrewsbury, secretary of state to William III, had him under observation, and, although a messenger's recognition at Canterbury caused him to swerve aside, he was captured on 12 June at New Romney, and a compromising note to Lady Mary was intercepted. On 19 June the lords justices sent him to the Tower.<br>
<br>To escape trial and execution without infringing his honour, Fenwick applied to the lord steward, William Cavendish, first duke of Devonshire, offering, if he were pardoned and not made a witness, to confess some vital secrets to William alone&#151;something several respectable politicians had done. Devonshire wrote to William on 7 July. Shrewsbury later added that Sir John was &#145;generally reputed a fearful man&#146;, and might confess enough to save his life: &#145;if he were well managed he might &hellip; facilitate the business in the next session&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private and Original Correspondence of &hellip; Shrewsbury</span>, 131&#150;2) by exposing crypto-Jacobite opposition MPs. However, when Devonshire, under strict promises of confidentiality (afterwards ignored), interviewed him on William's orders on 11 August, his &#145;confession&#146; dealt almost entirely with the dealings of the major &#145;compounding&#146; politicians, Shrewsbury himself, Admiral Edward Russell, and Sidney, Lord Godolphin, all then in office, and Marlborough, with Middleton: their failure to keep their promises to James, he considered, justified this limited exposure. Devonshire, though he told Fenwick he believed William had heard most of this before, was shaken, and secretly sent William the confession. Fenwick soon added the tale of saving William from assassination in 1695.<br>
<br>William probably believed most, but not all, of Fenwick's charges, but was angered that he had said so little on the non-compounders' intrigues. Fenwick was told that his paper was unsatisfactory and that his trial would proceed. He was arraigned on 17 September. Lady Mary, driven both by desire to save her husband and the hope of overthrowing the compounders, approached his fellow prisoner Ailesbury, urging him to confirm Fenwick's account. When Ailesbury refused, Lady Mary threatened that Fenwick would testify against Ailesbury in court to justify his truthfulness. Either then or after a similar later approach Ailesbury applied obliquely to the men Fenwick had attacked, and they promised that if Ailesbury remained silent they would protect him. Excusing himself that, if unsigned and unsworn, a paper could harm nobody, Fenwick on 23 September made a further confession of the doings of the &#145;select number&#146;. The trial was again postponed.<br>
<br>The delays, meanwhile, allowed wild speculation to spread publicly as to whom Fenwick had named. The eccentric whig Charles Mordaunt, earl of Monmouth (later third earl of Peterborough), at first feared that Fenwick had revealed his many Jacobite plots; on finding that he had not, he began demanding that Fenwick's allegations be investigated. Shrewsbury had originally lied unhesitatingly dismissing the paper. Early in October, however, a hunting accident triggered a serious illness which prevented him from returning to London. Hostile observers (including Fenwick) and false witnesses assumed that this was either a trick or psychosomatic guilt. Foreseeing such attacks, he tried to resign, which only confirmed his critics' suspicions. The government realized that Fenwick's papers must be brought into parliament and denounced, and made careful preparations. However, ministers failed to stop Jacobites hired by Ailesbury, Montgomery, and Lady Mary from carrying Goodman off to France about 1 November. They now lacked the second witness necessary for a trial.<br>
<br>William reluctantly agreed to see Fenwick, just transferred to Newgate, before the cabinet on 2 November. It was probably not Goodman's escape that made Fenwick again refuse to speak, for he showed no confidence, but repeatedly begged to consult Devonshire. He declared that his knowledge was only for William's ear. &#145;You shall trust where I trust&#146;, he replied  (cabinet minute, 2 Nov 1696, BL, Add. MS 72567). Fenwick would not either withdraw his accusations or further confess his own activities. As he refused to say anything more without further time to consider, William finally said: &#145;Be it so, I will neither hear you nor hear from you any more&#146;  (<span class="italic">Private and Original Correspondence of &hellip; Shrewsbury</span>, 421).<h2>
<a name="Attainder"></a>Attainder</h2>On 6 November Fenwick's two main papers were read before the Commons. Fenwick, called in, refused several times to speak out. The papers were voted false and scandalous; then, in a thinning house, the whigs obtained a surprise vote for a bill of attainder by 179 to 61. Fenwick's letters to his wife help explain his ineffectiveness over the next crucial weeks. Disorientated and sickened by pipe-smoking soldiers in his cell, he was denied pen and ink and almost totally cut off from outside contact. He had never had the promised copies of his papers, and was uncertain what they contained. He did not know which of them had been read out&#151;that, for instance, his paper on saving William's life had been suppressed before Commons and Lords. He did not know about the attainder until he was hurried to answer it. His morale was unsurprisingly low: any hope at the start of a letter can be seen draining away during it.<br>
<br>Support and opposition for the attainder produced odd allies. Some knew his claims were largely true. &#145;Damn him!&#146;, said Marlborough's brother George Churchill, &#145;thrust a billet down his throat. Dead men tell no tales&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Ailesbury</span>, 1.412). But some whigs saw features&#151;sentences implying that the compounders were behind the assassination plot, for instance&#151;which did suggest a plot-forger denigrating their whole party. Many strong opponents thought badly of Fenwick&#151;worse than he deserved, since the government rumour mill was busy&#151;but were shocked at the procedure against such an inconsiderable man: in particular, the reliance on one notoriously criminal witness and the past testimony of another. The destruction of Jacobite communications after the assassination plot meant that St Germain hardly intervened directly. Once the sponsors considered dropping the bill, and the Commons third reading passed only by 189 to 156, with some government supporters opposing or abstaining. Beneath the surface convention that Fenwick was lying, there was deep unease and curiosity.<br>
<br>Lady Mary was meanwhile approached by Monmouth, via the duchess of Norfolk and other intermediaries, all with their own agenda. Monmouth's aim was revenge on William and on Shrewsbury. Fenwick received from Monmouth papers suggesting lines of defence, hostile or friendly witnesses to be called, and documents to be unearthed. Although much of this was mistaken in detail, acting on it boldly provided his best chance of escape. He failed yet again to act, from a general distrust of Monmouth, a particular fear that he might be acting in concert with the persons Fenwick had named to entrap Lady Mary, and growing despair. Monmouth in revenge threw himself into supporting the bill in the Lords. His energy may have been decisive, for the third reading, on 23 December, passed by only 68 to 61. The peers and the bishops William's government had made were the bulk of its majority. Marlborough got Princess Anne's court to support the bill; Godolphin, by then out of office, opposed it throughout. Lady Mary and the duchess of Norfolk in revenge exposed Monmouth's double dealing. The Lords' inquiry in January sent Monmouth briefly to the Tower. The revelations might have helped Fenwick a month earlier; but the bill had been passed. Lady Mary's petitions, mentioning the supposed saving of William's life, had no effect.<br>
<br>William passed the act of attainder on 12 January 1697. Fenwick's connections to so many noble families, his former military rank, and, perhaps, the irregular means through which he was condemned led him to be beheaded, like a peer. Gilbert Burnet, bishop of Salisbury, had been one of the most violent of the bill's clerical supporters, possibly hoping for preferment. Now he obtained permission for the aged nonjuring bishop Thomas White, former bishop of Peterborough, to attend Fenwick on the scaffold on Tower Hill on 28 January 1697. Fenwick died composedly and bravely. He left a paper protesting at the injustice of his attainder and proclaiming his loyalty to King James. White, denying authorship, said that he would have included stronger reproaches, particularly against Devonshire. Ailesbury's tale that he left a letter reproaching Lady Mary with his loss of life and honour fairly certainly merely reflects Ailesbury's uneasy conscience. Fenwick's body was placed in a rich coffin and buried in the early hours of 29 January by torchlight beside his children in St Martin-in-the-Fields Church.<br>
<br>On 27 March 1700 Fenwick's forfeited personal estate was granted to his wife's nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13887/', "Charles Howard, third earl of Carlisle")</script>, to satisfy Carlisle's own claims and those of Fenwick's creditors. Lady Mary Fenwick devoted her remaining years to commemorating her husband (though her biography remained incomplete) and paying off his debts from her annuity. She settled in York Minster close, in part of the Treasurer's House. She died on 27 October 1708, and was buried in York Minster under a monument she had erected to her husband and father.<h2>
<a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h2>In his early life there would appear to be two Sir John Fenwicks: the able young soldier and MP defying his patrons to support local wishes; and the court debauch&eacute;. Incidents like the Drury Lane riot suggest that the second took over. &#145;His temper was most good&#146;, wrote Ailesbury, &#145;but his headpiece was none of the best&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Ailesbury</span>, 1.273). He broke the convention that some political secrets, however widely shared, must not be publicly mentioned, and suffered for it. The Jacobites viewed Sir John Fenwick as a martyr. Objectively, his lack of the steadfastness much lesser figures had shown, and his willingness to confess matters liable to damage the cause, made him undeserving. What attracted sympathy was the sight of the basic rules of law being laid aside, and the whole cumbersome machinery of government and patronage being set in motion to destroy one unimportant man, against whom the king had one of his many personal vendettas. Disgust over this gave added fury to the parliamentary reaction against William after the peace of 1697. It was generally believed, after his horse Sorrel stumbled and threw him in 1702, precipitating his death, that Sorrel was formerly Fenwick's, confiscated on his attainder&#151;perhaps truly, but, when there remained a general belief in a guiding providence, the story indicates what many besides Jacobites thought of William's treatment of Fenwick.<br>
<br>Acts of attainder were discredited by their employment against such small fry. They continued to be used, but not as substitutes for trials unlikely to produce a guilty verdict. However, his condemnation, and the imprisonment without trial of assassination plot suspects, in most cases for life, by acts automatically renewed, indicated a shift in method. The Stuarts, when they wished to strain the law, had employed the judges and courts; governments after the revolution employed parliament.<br>
<br>In attainting Fenwick, the whig ministers failed to deter further allegations against members of the government. Professional false witnesses swarmed to execute variations on Fenwick's story, and, being without regard for truth, they were far harder to silence. Success in one of their false claims might have made possible a re-examination of the whole case, with the possibility of showing that William himself had suppressed knowledge of treason in high places: there were great possibilities for blackmail. Until ill health drove Shrewsbury from the country in 1700, his colleagues had to spend much time protecting him against them. Even from his enemies' viewpoint, Fenwick died largely in vain.<br>
