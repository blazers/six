<span class="headword">MacLeod, Dame  Flora Louisa Cecilia</span>  (1878&#150;1976), <span class="occ">chief of clan MacLeod</span>, was born on 3 February 1878 at 12 Downing Street, Westminster, London, the elder of the two daughters of Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847&#150;1935), twenty-seventh chief, and his wife, Agnes Mary Cecilia (<i>d</i>. 1921), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20328/', "Sir Stafford Northcote")</script>, chancellor of the exchequer. Her younger sister was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/63622/', "Olive Susan Miranda Temple (1880&#150;1936)")</script>. Flora was born at the chancellor's official residence, her mother having returned there for the birth. Her early years were spent in London before moving to Edinburgh when her father was under-secretary for Scotland. Agnes MacLeod was an invalid for thirty-two years, and partially blind, but as a child Flora led an active life, playing croquet and cricket and displaying a fondness for music: she played the viola and piano and performed with the Edinburgh Ladies' Orchestra. Her interest in politics and literary matters was stimulated by her father, who was accustomed to play intellectual games with his family and guests. In 1896 she was presented at Buckingham Palace. She spent the summer of 1904 in India with her aunt Alice Northcote, and learned some Hindustani as she could not bear not to be able to ask for what she wanted.<br>
<br>Flora married on 5 June 1901 Hubert (1870&#150;1933), the ninth son and tenth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28638/', "John Walter (1818&#150;1894)")</script>, chief proprietor of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and his second wife, Flora MacNabb. They had two daughters: Alice (1902&#150;1980) and Joan (1905&#150;1977). In 1907 Flora accompanied her husband to Brussels when he was a correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span>; her language skills enabled her to assist him (notably she sent the telegram stating that Belgium had taken the Congo, as Hubert was in the press gallery at Westminster at the time), and two years later they moved on a posting to Berlin. In 1914 she accompanied her father to Canada and the USA. He lived with Flora after her mother died, and she acted as his hostess on the four annual visits to Dunvegan.<br>
<br>The family lived first in Devonshire Terrace, moving in 1916 to 19 Cheyne Place, Chelsea. The marriage was not particularly happy, as Flora was far more able and ambitious than Hubert, although he was known as a sparkling raconteur. During the First World War, Flora served as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse and in the infant welfare service. She was chairman of Chelsea welfare service, medical secretary of a school in Battersea, and secretary of Chelsea war savings committee. She also became involved in local politics, being asked by Sir Samuel Hoare MP to chair a women's auxiliary branch, and she was one of six women elected to Chelsea borough council. She was a founding member of Chelsea Housing Improvement Society and later chairman of the Chelsea branch of the League of Nations. From 1921 she spent more time on Skye and became aware of the harsh living conditions for the local people. She started an egg depot in Dunvegan and a tweed industry among settlers from the outer isles in Portnalong. In 1929 she was elected a district councillor for Skye, and was co-opted onto the education and public health committees of Inverness county council and of the county nursing association. By 1931 Flora had given up her work in Chelsea and was committed to Skye. She had been brought up as an episcopalian but now joined the Church of Scotland. In 1932 she was elected county councillor for Bracadale.<br>
<br>In 1929 Flora resumed her maiden name, and on her father's death in 1935 she succeeded to the chiefship of clan MacLeod as well as to the estate of Dunvegan and Dunvegan Castle. This was in accordance with the terms of the entail stating that should the male line fail, the estate should pass to the eldest daughter of the last chief. The lord Lyon approved her change of name to MacLeod of MacLeod in 1935. She was accepted as chief by the Clan MacLeod Society in 1936 and in the following year met 200 clansmen in Edinburgh, welcoming some 300 overseas clansmen at the castle in 1937 as part of the coronation celebrations. A serious fire destroyed the south wing of the castle in 1938, but swift action by local people saved its treasures and the rebuilding programme, completed by Christmas 1940, incorporated some modernization.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Flora offered the castle for the rehabilitation of wounded servicemen but it was not accepted, as Skye was part of the exclusion zone. She was, however, able to entertain many MacLeod servicemen on leave, and wrote to many others held as prisoners of war. A branch of the Home Guard was formed, and Flora was responsible for an emergency store of food in the castle, to be distributed locally in the event of a German invasion. Flora's elder daughter, Alice, married to Archie MacNab, changed her name to MacLeod in 1943 as she was Flora's heir; however, it was discovered that the entail could easily be broken, and this was done in favour of Flora's second grandson, John, son of Joan and Robert Wolrige Gordon (whereupon the MacNabs reverted to their original name).<br>
<br>After the war Flora laboured to boost tourism on Skye; she joined the Scottish Tourist Board in 1950 and worked with Major Iain Hilleary to set up Skye Week in late May to extend the tourist season. She made several high-profile visits to Canada and the USA, founding clan societies and generating publicity for tourism. These contacts proved useful when, shortly after her return from the USA in 1953, the roof of Dunvegan Castle was found to be in a very bad condition and an American Dunvegan foundation was set up to help raise money for repairs. Also in 1953 she became DBE. Flora then departed for Australia and New Zealand, where again she founded several clan societies, bringing all these together as a worldwide clan organization. This became the most important thing in her life&#151;and became her memorial.<br>
<br>To celebrate the coming of age of her twin grandsons, John and Patrick, in August 1956 Flora laid on a generous hospitality programme, coinciding with the first clan parliament and a lunch for Elizabeth II and representatives of the distant clan societies. She featured in several television documentaries, and in 1967 portrayed her ancestor in a BBC film about Boswell and Johnson. She continued to travel abroad almost every year, and in the 1960s accompanied Peter Howard, leader of Moral Re-Armament. These tours were interrupted briefly by a spell in hospital following a car accident. In 1965 she made over the castle and estate to John, her heir, but the castle remained her home, where she was cared for by her daughter Joan. By 1972 this had become too difficult for her and she moved to Ythan Lodge in Aberdeenshire, although still living in London for much of the year. On 4 November 1976 she took her usual daily walk from Ythan, and having reached the far point she sat down on a bank and died.<br>
