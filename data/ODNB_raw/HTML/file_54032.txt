<span class="headword">Knowles,  Matilda Cullen</span>  (1864&#150;1933), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 31 January 1864 at Ballymena, co. Antrim, one of three daughters of William James Knowles, an insurance agent and amateur archaeologist. From an early age she was interested in botany, and as a girl she became friendly with Robert Lloyd Praeger (1865&#150;1953). They botanized together in Antrim and Londonderry, and in the late 1890s Miss Knowles undertook the survey of co. Tyrone for Praeger's <span class="italic">Irish Topographical Botany</span> (1901). She published her first paper in 1897 on the plants of co. Tyrone.<br>
<br>Subsequently, with her sister Catherine, Matilda Knowles went to Dublin and attended the natural history classes at the Royal College of Science. By June 1902 she had joined the staff of the Science and Art Museum, Dublin, on a temporary basis to assist Professor Thomas Johnson (1863&#150;1954); in 1907 she was promoted to assistant in the botany section, working at first, under the direction of Johnson, on listing the flowering plants and ferns (vascular plants) native and naturalized in Ireland. In the preface to <span class="italic">Hand List of Irish Flowering Plants and Ferns</span> (1910), Johnson acknowledged that &#145;Though I am responsible for the List, and the form it takes, its preparation is due to my assistant, Miss M. C. Knowles&#146;. When Johnson retired as custodian of the botany department in 1923, Miss Knowles was placed in charge of the collections, and although she was due to retire in 1929 she was granted extensions until her death.<br>
<br>Miss Knowles is highly regarded as a student of lichens, non-flowering, often microscopic plants formed by symbiotic fungi and algae. The stimulus that led her to study lichens was the Clare Island survey, initiated in 1908, during which she assisted Annie Lorrain Smith (1854&#150;1937) of the British Museum (Natural History), London. They visited the island, situated off the south-west coast of co. Mayo, collecting and cataloguing lichens in 1909 and 1910. Smith's report on the island's lichen flora was published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy</span> (1911).<br>
<br>Miss Knowles published her first paper on Irish lichens in 1912. She studied the zonation of the maritime and marine lichens on the rocky coast at Howth, co. Dublin, and in 1913 published her work in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Dublin Society</span>. This paper is now recognized as a pioneering ecological study because Knowles defined for the first time three zones characterized by lichens of conspicuously different colours, grey highest up the shore, then orange, and black nearest the sea. Praeger prompted Matilda Knowles to list all Irish lichen species and record their distribution according to the vice-counties scheme of his <span class="italic">Irish Topographical Botany</span>. With the collaboration of about thirty naturalists she assembled data on 802 lichens, including about twenty new to Ireland. <span class="italic">Lichens of Ireland</span>, her principal work, was published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy</span> in 1929.<br>
<br>Miss Knowles named three new species in her paper on the Howth lichen zones: <i>Acarospora benedarensis</i> (its name is derived from Ben Edar, the Irish name for Howth) is a synonym of <i>Acarospora smaragdula</i>; <i>Verrucaria lorrain-smithiae</i> is a synonym of <i>Verrucaria sandstedei</i>; <i>Lecania atrynoides</i> is accepted as distinct. While she received no academic recognition during her lifetime, two lichens, <i>Lecidea matildae</i>, named by A. H. Magnusson in 1956, and <i>Verrucaria knowlesiae</i> named by P. M. McCarthy in 1988, honour her. She was regarded as an &#145;accurate and energetic botanist, a charming companion, and a wise and trusty friend&#146;  (Praeger, <span class="italic">Irish Naturalists' Journal</span>, 193; <span class="italic">Journal of Botany</span>, 231). Following a short illness, Matilda Knowles died at the Mercer's Hospital, Dublin, on 27 April 1933.<br>
