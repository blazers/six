<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Menzies, Sir  Robert Gordon</span>  (1894&#150;1978), <span class="occ">prime minister of Australia</span>, was born on 20 December 1894 at Jeparit, in the Wimmera district of Victoria, the fourth of the five children of James Menzies and his wife, Kate Sampson. The forebears were Scots on the paternal side and Cornish on the maternal. James was Jeparit's general storekeeper and local community leader, a lay preacher and prominent in activities ranging from sporting clubs to the district shire council.<h2>
<a name="Earlylifeandcareer"></a>Early life and career</h2>Though themselves not formally well educated, Menzies' parents were well read and anxious that their children should have the best instruction that could be arranged. They were accordingly sent to school in the nearby city of Ballarat. Bob did best, topping the state scholarship examination in 1907, studying subsequently at Wesley College, Melbourne, and on an exhibition at the University of Melbourne. In an outstanding undergraduate career he won a galaxy of prizes and the award in 1918 of the degree of master of laws.<br>
<br>Admitted to the bar, Menzies read with Owen Dixon, the leading Victorian junior and later chief justice of Australia. In 1920, as advocate for the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, Menzies won in the high court a case which proved a landmark in the augmentation of commonwealth powers over those of the states. The court's verdict brought Menzies &#145;sudden fame&#146; professionally: more important personally, it gave him, as a young man of twenty-five, the means to marry. His bride was <a href="#cosubject_57034">Pattie Maie (Pat) Leckie (1899&#150;1995) [<i>see below</i>]</a>, daughter of J. W. Leckie, a manufacturer who had served in the Victorian parliament. They were married on 27 September 1920 at the Kew Presbyterian Church.<br>
<br>This was a period of political ferment in Melbourne, principally among young and respectable men. They wanted to bring a new sense of public responsibility to state politics, then notoriously moribund, even corrupt, and in organizations such as the Constitutional Club promoted speaking classes, a library, and a model parliament. Menzies imbibed the atmosphere of the time and, as a successful young professional, felt obliged to undertake &#145;a certain amount of public work&#146;. He drifted into the service of the Nationalist Party, the conservative political formation spawned when Labor split over conscription during the late war. As a member of this party he entered the Victorian upper house, the legislative council, in 1928 at a by-election, and then, in the lower house, captured the Nunawading seat at the general election of the following year. He was soon a founder and leader of the &#145;Young Nationals&#146;, a ginger group dedicated to revitalizing the Nationalist Party, and as such had won by 1931 the presidency of the national federation, the governing body of the party apparatus. After the defeat of the ruling state Labor government in 1932 he was the first &#145;young nat.&#146; to receive full cabinet rank when he became attorney-general and minister for railways in the Nationalist ministry headed by Sir Stanley Argyle.<br>
<br>Menzies was meanwhile being progressively drawn into federal politics by the crisis of the great depression. In the early 1930s the depression brought suffering to split James Scullin's ruling Labor government between those who thought salvation lay in balanced budgets and those for whom unusual troubles required unusual remedies, most particularly the expansion of credit. &#145;Honest Joe&#146; Lyons, by late 1930 Scullin's acting treasurer, took the former attitude, as did Menzies and a &#145;Group of Six&#146; prominent non-Labor men, who took the lead in virtually establishing a new political party to replace the existing Nationalists. The new organization, the United Australia Party (UAP), which altered the whole structure of Australian politics, was in fact largely the product of a powerful coalition of forces triggered by a mushrooming of citizens' leagues through which responsible elements from many levels of society gave expression to their fears of civil dislocation as depression conditions bit. Menzies and his compatriots persuaded Lyons to leave the Labor Party and become leader of the non-Labor federal opposition. The existing opposition leader, J. G. Latham, resigned and Lyons, at the head of the new party of redemption, became opposition leader. A federal election late in 1931 installed him as prime minister of Australia, after a sweeping victory in which eight Labor ministers lost their seats. In 1934 Menzies was persuaded to stand for the federal seat of Kooyong, which became vacant when its incumbent, Latham, left politics altogether. Elected with ease, Menzies took Latham's place, as attorney-general, in Lyons's cabinet. He was to hold the Kooyong seat until his voluntary retirement from parliament in 1966.<br>
<br>In 1935, at the age of forty-one, and accompanied by his wife, Menzies made his first trip to England, one of a small party of Australian ministers visiting London to take part in the silver jubilee celebration of George V's reign. As attorney-general he was also involved in official trade talks. He found these tedious but nothing could dim his joy in experiencing, as he put it in his diary, the reflections which &#145;can so strangely move the souls of those who go &#147;home&#148; to a land they have never seen&#146;  (Martin and Hardy, 1.148). For weeks he revelled in the actuality&#151;in stones and architecture, countryside and ceremony&#151;of the Britain that his education had taught him was also his. He met political notables, travelled widely, was entertained at Buckingham Palace, and won plaudits as a public speaker. Subsequent official visits, again largely for trade talks, enhanced his reputation and confirmed his affection for British culture, but evoked further aversion at what he saw as the ruthlessness of British businessmen.<h2>
<a name="Primeminister"></a>Prime minister</h2>On Lyons's death in 1939 the UAP elected Menzies to party leadership. Page, leader of the Country Party, announced that his party would no longer work in coalition with the UAP, and launched on Menzies an attack described by the <span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span> as &#145;a violation of the decencies of debate without parallel in the annals of the Federal Parliament&#146;  (Martin and Hardy, 1.274). Page asserted that, with war threatening, Menzies was incapable of leading the nation, because he had been disloyal to Lyons and because he had failed to enlist in the First World War. Though the full reasons for this animus are not altogether clear, Page&#151;a simple if pompous soul&#151;was well known as a butt for Menzies' often cutting wit and uncanny gifts as a mimic. Menzies perforce formed a new, all-UAP cabinet, which in September 1939 became a war cabinet when Menzies and his ministers assumed, without dissent, that since Britain had declared war on Germany after the latter's invasion of Poland, Australia would do so too.<br>
<br>The government took steps at once to put Australia on a war footing. <span class="roman">War Precautions Acts</span> gave new powers over industry and civil life, and recruitment of a second Australian Imperial Force began. Menzies resisted as long as he could &#145;minds &hellip; heavily indoctrinated by the &#147;old soldiers' point of view&#148;&#146;  (Martin and Hardy, 1.289) which pressed for rapid deployment of an expeditionary force to come to Britain's aid. Equally, he was worried about the Japanese threat. Late in 1940 he decided to visit London to remonstrate at Britain's failure to strengthen Singapore, which was then seen as the key bastion in Australia's Pacific defence. But even before he left, a general election had reduced his majority in the federal parliament to two (and independents at that), and already Labor was refusing to take part in a national government. When he arrived in England the first, &#145;phoney&#146;, stage of the European war was over: Britain was facing aerial blitz and daily fear of invasion from the continent. Assisting Australia, as Menzies asked, was out of the question. Invited by courtesy to sit while in London in the British cabinet, Menzies developed a curious love&#150;hate relationship with Churchill whom he privately blamed for many of the disasters of this stage of the war, including the heavy losses Australian and New Zealand expeditionary troops suffered in the abortive Greek and Cretan campaigns.<br>
<br>It was an open secret that during Menzies' absence plotting took place against his leadership. He was not universally popular, not being good&#151;as his political opponent but personal friend John Curtin once put it&#151;&#145;at handling his men&#146;  (Martin and Hardy, 1.385), and having alienated sections of the electorate through his social position, intelligence, and sometimes arrogant ways. Though welcomed on his return to Australia by great public meetings, to which he gave rousing patriotic addresses, Menzies soon came to feel that under his leadership the UAP could not prosper and the war effort might suffer. He offered Labor more proposals for a national government. When these were rejected, he called an emergency cabinet meeting at which a majority of his ministers agreed that a new leader was needed. Menzies forthwith resigned, to offer what he called &#145;real prospects of unity in the ranks of the Government parties&#146;  (ibid., 1.383). For him it was a deep personal blow; for the government parties it proved an ineffectual move. Before 1941 was out Labor, under John Curtin, was in office and Menzies on the opposition benches.<br>
<br>Menzies showed remarkable resilience after the first shock of resignation. The aged W. M. Hughes was elected party leader but proved ineffectual when Labor swept the polls in 1943, and Menzies was re-elected. With the passing of the crisis which had given it birth, the UAP was evidently in decline, and a series of &#145;post-mortems&#146; on the 1943 defeat counselled a new start. Thus in 1944&#150;5 was formed the Liberal Party, in whose gestation Menzies' influence was prominent.<br>
<br>Though elected leader of the new party, Menzies' position remained for some time uncertain. He was still not universally trusted and when defeated badly in the 1946 election toyed with the idea of leaving politics altogether. What saved him was the decision of Curtin's successor, Ben Chifley, to nationalize the Australian banks in 1947. Menzies took the lead in fighting this move, using it as symbolic of what he saw as the key issue of post-war politics: a struggle between socialism and planning for social justice on the one hand and the growth of freedom and prosperity through spontaneous, especially economic, development on the other.<br>
<br>In 1948 Menzies' party, after long argument, decided to dissolve the Communist Party of Australia if it came to office. The early cold war was taking shape. The Australian Liberal Party had been deeply moved by the communist coup in Prague and the death of Jan Masaryk. Menzies himself was in London in 1948, when the first Berlin blockade so stirred fears, only three years from the end of the Second World War, that another conflagration was about to break out.<h2>
<a name="TheMenziesera"></a>The Menzies era</h2>The 1949 election fanned the flames of anti-communism and told against a Labor government which stood on a record of austerity whose virtues were not cherished on every side. The Liberals won and so began that period of ascendancy known as the &#145;Menzies era&#146;. It lasted a record sixteen years and involved his winning seven general elections in a row. Not all were unequivocal victories: close calls were registered in 1954 and 1961 and, particularly after the formation of the Democratic Labor Party, the Liberals sometimes benefited fortuitously from their opponents' disarray. For all that, Menzies enjoyed formidable support in his own right. Occasional complaints about his leadership style notwithstanding, experience brought mellowness, and none could gainsay the extraordinary skill he developed over years of experience in handling the arts and mechanisms of politics. There was also the comfortable assumption he and some of his supporters cultivated that he was the &#145;natural&#146; leader of the respectable, middle-of-the-road elements of the post-war community. His own early &#145;fireside talk&#146; broadcasts, his concern, from the beginning, that women&#151;most particularly the country's sound matrons&#151;should be well represented in the new Liberal organization, and the relative permanence and autonomy of that organization itself were further factors in the development of this atmosphere.<br>
<br>The period of Menzies' ascendancy was marked by extraordinary economic growth. This &#145;long boom&#146; was experienced in most advanced economies, but the Menzies governments' stability, their declared policies of &#145;development&#146;, and their continuance of the ambitious immigration programme initiated by Labor helped to transform Australian material life, as indicated by markers as various as growth in population and home ownership, the ubiquity of white goods, and a great jump in motor-vehicle ownership.<br>
<br>Predictably, communism and cold war fears dominated in the first years of Menzies' ascendancy. After one false start, the government carried legislation to dissolve the Communist Party, but this was declared invalid by the high court. Having successfully engineered a dissolution of both houses of parliament, the government won a second election and asked at referendum for constitutional powers to deal with communism in the same terms as had the nullified act. The opposition, under H. V. Evatt, narrowly defeated the referendum, depicted by its detractors as an attack on civil liberties. Menzies travelled extensively in his first year or so of office, consulted many politicians and men of affairs, and decided as early as 1951 that Australia faced the danger of war in three years' time. Legislation established a National Security Resources Board to advise on the stockpiling of strategic materials, compulsory military training for eighteen-year-olds was instituted, and new equipment was planned for the army and navy. These measures were meant to accompany and strengthen the new anti-communist powers asked for at referendum. But, together with loans contracted abroad to give extensive stimulation to economic development (the other declared objective of the Liberals), they involved sometimes crippling expenditure which countered efforts to hold a lid on inflation.<br>
<br>Menzies benefited vicariously from the extraordinarily popular Australian tour of the young Queen Elizabeth in 1954, but sourness supervened when, on the eve of the election in that year, Vladimir Petrov and his wife defected from the Soviet embassy with alleged evidence of Russian spying activities. Some pundits, watching electoral trends, had thought Evatt a likely winner of the coming contest, but he behaved erratically before a royal commission appointed to inquire into the affair and soon gave evidence of a decaying mind, alleging that the Petrovs were not genuine witnesses and that the episode was a plot hatched by Menzies and the head of the secret service, Brigadier Spry, to keep him out of office. Though the allegation passed into Labor mythology, it has frequently been disproven.<br>
<br>In 1950 Menzies had believed that the chief communist threat was to Europe, and that in the event of world war Australia would provide forces to guard the Middle East. His first two ministers for external affairs, Percy Spender and Richard Casey, however, saw south-east Asia as the crucial area for Australian defence, and were chiefly responsible for the Australia&#150;New Zealand&#150;United States treaty (1951) and the formation of the South-East Asia Treaty Organization (1954). Menzies accepted the aim of such agreements: to sustain the commitment of the United States to the region and to look for security through &#145;great and powerful friends&#146;. He also formally agreed in 1955 to Australian participation in the British-organized Far East Strategic Reserve; in consequence Australia was involved in conflicts arising from the Malayan emergency and Indonesia's policy of confrontation. Henceforth the Menzies administrations were committed to the concept of &#145;forward defence&#146;, a notion which, combined with increasing dependence on the United States, led almost inexorably to involvement, near the end of Menzies' prime ministership, in the Vietnam War.<br>
<br>In the years after 1958, when the minister for trade and industry, John McEwen, was leader of the Country Party, the fear of communism was a less important political imperative, and promotion of Australian exports through protection, tariff manipulation, and aggressive trade negotiations became characteristics of the Menzies era. McEwen's department was sometimes at odds with the treasury, occasionally to Menzies' displeasure. Nevertheless, though temperamentally different Menzies and McEwen saw eye to eye on most matters. On the eve of one federal election in the 1960s Menzies could write to McEwen: &#145;There never has been such a partnership as this in the political history of Australia.&#146;<h2>
<a name="Achievements"></a>Achievements</h2>Preservation of the Liberal&#150;Country Party coalition was in fact one of the three achievements on which, near the end of his parliamentary career, Menzies looked back with most pride. Given the natural tension that had always existed between the two parties, this accomplishment reflected the great political acumen and prestige of the mature Menzies. The other two feats he thought memorable were the extension of federal involvement in education and the physical development of Canberra as the national capital. The highlight of the first was the appointment in 1956 of Sir Keith Murray's committee to inquire into the then financial plight of Australia's universities, and Menzies' insistence that the committee's recommendations be fully implemented. The highlight of the second was his insistence in 1960 that funds be appropriated for the construction of the long-delayed lake that Walter Burley Griffin had originally made the centrepiece of his design for Canberra.<br>
<br>Menzies belonged to the generation for whom to be Australian was automatically to be British. It was an outlook that involved veneration for inherited institutions such as parliament and the courts because they were the creation of time and history, and respect for the crown as the focus of loyalty which held a family of disparate British societies together. In the 1950s and 1960s Menzies became something of the &#145;grand old man&#146; at Commonwealth prime ministers' conferences, but he was privately unhappy at a scenario in which hitherto subject peoples increasingly became equals of the old &#145;white&#146; self-governing dominions. His good friend Harold Macmillan tried gently to get him to accept &#145;the winds of change&#146;, but personally Menzies never quite did so. His almost sentimental old-fashioned Britishness led him into a few stances that had regrettable overtones, the prime example, perhaps, being his support of the Eden government's policies in the Suez crisis of 1956.<br>
<br>Menzies retired from politics at the peak of his power, in January 1966. He subsequently delivered by invitation at the University of Virginia a series of lectures later published as <span class="italic">Central Power in the Australian Commonwealth</span> (1967). In 1965 Harold Wilson had nominated him to succeed Winston Churchill as warden of the Cinque Ports, and on his annual trips to fulfil consequent honorific duties he was able to keep up with old friends in England. Among Menzies' many honorary degrees were those from Melbourne, Oxford, and Cambridge universities. His other honours included CH (1951) and FRS (1965). He was sworn of the privy council in 1937, and became a knight of the Thistle (1963) and a knight of the Order of Australia (1976).<br>
<br>Menzies wrote two volumes of reminiscences, <span class="italic">Afternoon Light</span> (1967) and <span class="italic">The Measure of the Years</span> (1970). In 1971 he suffered a severe stroke which incapacitated him physically and put limits on his public appearances. He died on 15 May 1978 at his home, 2 Hayerbrack Avenue, Malvern, Victoria, and was accorded a state funeral. He was privately cremated, and in June 1996 his ashes were interred, with those of his wife, in a newly established prime ministers' memorial garden in Melbourne general cemetery.<br>
<br>Large-framed and handsome, Menzies had a ready wit and superb command of language. His outward mien suggested a tendency towards imperiousness but it also covered a certain shyness. Intimates knew a man of great good humour and kindness. Life for him was a gift to be enjoyed with gusto; he took pleasure in food and drink, revelled in letting his hair down at his favourite Savage and West Brighton clubs in Melbourne, and enjoyed watching sports, being a connoisseur of the art of cricket. After Alfred Deakin and before Gough Whitlam, Menzies was probably the most well-read prime minister Australia has had, though he was not given to parading his erudition. He enjoyed nineteenth-century classical novels, could quote hundreds of lines of Shakespeare and of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and on boring train and aeroplane trips was given to probing &#145;who-dunnits&#146;. An intensely private man, he strictly separated personal matters, such as his family life, from public affairs. Paul Hasluck, who knew Menzies well, wrote of him: &#145;I think the sort of tribute he would have appreciated most would not have been praise of his great talents or a recital of what he had accomplished but rather a statement that he was a man of character, honourable in conduct and decent in behaviour. He was that and I offer the tribute&#146;  (Martin, &#145;Menzies, Sir Robert Gordon&#146;, 15.361).<br>

<a name="cosubject_57034"></a><span class="headword">Dame Pattie Maie <span class="st"> [Pat]</span> Menzies</span>  (1899&#150;1995)<span class="occ"></span> was born on 2 March 1899 at Alexandria in Victoria. Her father, John William Leckie, of Scottish descent, was Australian-born. Her mother, May Beatrix, died when Pattie was eleven, and as a growing girl she was close to and shared politics with her father, for a time a member of the Victorian parliament. She married Robert Menzies in 1920, and after he entered federal politics took part in most of his electioneering campaigns. In 1954 she was appointed by Queen Elizabeth II dame grand cross in the Order of the British Empire for her public work in hospitals and her representation of Australia on a number of occasions overseas. She died at Canberra on 30 August 1995.<br>
