<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cook,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1608, <em>d.</em> 1660), <span class="occ">judge and regicide</span>, was the eldest son of the landowner Isaac Cook (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1658) and his wife, Elizabeth Twigden, of Burbage and Husbands Bosworth, Leicestershire; he was baptized on 18 September 1608 at Husbands Bosworth. Cook matriculated as a commoner from Wadham College, Oxford, in January 1623, although he was apparently in residence as early as March 1621, and left without a degree in June 1624. His father is styled esquire in the record of John's admission to Gray's Inn on 1 November 1623, where he came under the influence of the puritan preacher Richard Sibbes. Cook also benefited from the advice of an older barrister, Thomas Brickenden, in his early struggles with the <span class="italic">Tenures</span> of Littleton, &#145;undoubtedly the most crabbed Author to begin with any Science in the world&#146;  (J. Cook, <span class="italic">Vindication of the Professors and Profession of the Law</span>, 1646, 94), and later advocated the appointment of two law professors at each inn of court. He was nevertheless called to the bar in November 1631, and even hostile witnesses later expressed respect &#145;for his profession-sake, being learned therein&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 5.1082).<br>
<br>The difficulty of building a practice in Westminster Hall may well explain Cook's next career move, signalled by his admission to King's Inns, Dublin, in November 1634. During this first stay in Dublin of &#145;almost two years&#146;  (Firth, 15) he attracted the patronage of Lord Deputy Wentworth, who may have commissioned him to prepare a printed edition of the Irish statutes. If so, the project seemingly failed; Cook later refers obliquely to his own personal shortcomings as having obliged him to leave Ireland, but no other evidence corroborates the suggestion of a royalist journalist that he had embezzled moneys provided by Wentworth. Whatever his reasons, Cook certainly travelled widely on the continent during the later 1630s. Visits to France and Italy gave him a fund of useful knowledge about the history and institutions of Counter-Reformation Europe, as well as the experience of dining at the English College, Rome, in April 1638  (Chaney, 276). In Geneva he lodged with the eminent liberal Calvinist theologian Giovanni Diodati, signing the &#145;Album amicorum&#146; of the Neapolitan protestant noble Camillo Cerdogni in August 1638. While staying with some English congregational exiles, probably in the Netherlands, he began to read the works of Henry Ainsworth and other separatists, and to question the validity of the Church of England's episcopal administration.<br>
<br>Cook next appears in 1641 in the persona of a young lawyer, addressing his former patron Strafford, now imprisoned in the Tower. In a document transcribed by William Knowler and printed by Charles Firth, the original of which seems to have disappeared, Cook paid his respects in elaborately obsequious terms, while offering Strafford a series of legal arguments for his defence. Thereafter he vanishes from view, until his assignment by the House of Lords on 12 February 1646 as counsel for John Lilburne at the rehearing of the latter's conviction in Star Chamber nearly ten years before. Cook at his own trial in 1660 would claim to be &#145;no swordsman&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 5.1094), and in 1646 referred to &#145;us that have been London Residentes&#146; during the civil war  (<span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 76). As for what had prompted him &#145;to adhere so cordially and constantly to the Parliament against the late Oxford party&#146;, he himself asserted that &#145;Scripture grounds and reasons of state&#146;, as distinct from legal points or precedents, were the &#145;Arguments and motives which swayed me&#146;  (Cook, <span class="italic">Redintegratio amoris</span>, 17).<br>
<br>Early in 1646 Cook also launched his career as a public commentator on current issues. <span class="italic">The Vindication of the Professors and Profession of the Law</span> was written in response to an anonymous pamphlet of the previous year which had urged the rejection of common lawyers as recruiter MPs. Defending his occupation against various conventional charges, Cook maintained that England's laws were &#145;either actually, or potentially, the best in the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vindication</span>, 35), even if changes were needed to ensure that existing legal institutions contradicted neither God's word nor the dictates of reason. In detailing numerous desirable innovations and reforms, such as a national land registry, Cook na&iuml;vely assumed that acceptance in principle would more or less guarantee legislative implementation. His far-sighted and original proposals for reconstituting legal education similarly foundered on the indifference or hostility of the rulers of the inns of court. Cook married about this time: the principal candidates for his wife are Frances (surname unknown but beginning Barr&hellip; or possibly Farr&hellip;), who married &#145;Mr John Cooke, counsellor&#146; at St Peter, Cornhill, on 19 May 1646, and Frances Cutler, who married a John Cook at St Olave, Hart Street, on 12 September 1646. They had one daughter, Free-love.<br>
<br>Over the next four years Cook published a further five tracts, and wrote others which remained unprinted. Addressing the political crisis arising from the army's occupation of London, <span class="italic">Redintegratio amoris, or, A Union of Hearts</span> and <span class="italic">What the Independents would Have</span> both appeared in the autumn of 1647. The former argued that the army alone could secure liberty of conscience and reform the courts of justice, both preconditions of a peaceful settlement, while the latter provides a succinct apologia for limited religious toleration. In February 1648 his <span class="italic">Unum necessarium, or, The Poore Mans Case</span> advocated numerous measures to relieve social distress, including diversion of grain from beer to bread by suppressing alehouses, and the provision of subsidized loans and medical services to the poor (the latter an issue arising from the College of Physicians' prosecution of the empiric Dr William Trigg, who had retained Cook as counsel).<br>
<br>Whatever notice Cook's writings had already attracted was overshadowed in January 1649 when he took on the invidious task of prosecuting Charles I [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. The king's refusal to plead largely confined Cook's public role as solicitor-general for the Commonwealth to reading the indictment which he had drafted. A version of his intended speech for the prosecution, published shortly after the king's execution as <span class="italic">King Charls his Case, or, An Appeal to All Rational Men</span>, characterized the trial as &#145;the most comprehensive, impartial, and glorious piece of justice that ever was acted&#146; and claimed &#145;I went as cheerfully about it, as to a Wedding&#146;  (p. 39). Yet Cook's zeal earned him little material reward other than the mastership of St Cross Hospital, Winchester, and then appointment as chief justice of Munster. Having accompanied Oliver Cromwell to Ireland in the summer of 1649, he took up the latter post in March 1650, after prosecuting his former client Lilburne and other Leveller leaders, and serving on the court which convicted the royalist duke of Hamilton. Cook's visionary experience during a sea passage from Wexford to Kinsale forms the centrepiece of his <span class="italic">A True Relation</span>, and also figures in his wife's shorter account ([F. Cook], <span class="italic">Mris Cookes Meditations</span>), both appearing in the spring of 1650.<br>
<br>Cook sought with some success to provide cheap, accessible, and summary justice in Munster by reducing fees, office-holders, and professional lawyers, amalgamating law and equity, and proceeding on circuit through the province. These initiatives were understandably more popular with tenants than landlords, against whom he may have consciously discriminated. Cook's judicial role in Munster became increasingly circumscribed as he antagonized powerful political and religious interests, and in 1655 he was offered a judgeship in Dublin. A letter of refusal addressed to Lord Deputy Henry Cromwell eloquently expresses his conscientious scruples, deprecating at some length the &#145;Grand Cheat and Abominable Idoll Call'd the Course of the Courts&#146;  (Maclysaght, 443&#150;4). But after returning to England in 1657, Cook was again offered an Irish judge's place, which he accepted early in 1659, possibly for financial reasons. Besides a defence of the civilian republican Edmund Ludlow, he may have published later that year a broadsheet propounding a series of measures designed to restore &#145;these poor shaken and shattered Nations&#146; (Ludlow, 87; J. C., <span class="italic">Magna Charta</span>, 1659).<br>
<br>As the prospects of a Stuart restoration strengthened, Monck's Irish ally Sir Charles Coote seized Cook in February 1660. Sent a prisoner to the Tower of London, in early June Cook was exempted by name from the proposed parliamentary act of indemnity and oblivion. While its outcome was inevitable, his trial for treason at the Old Bailey lasted longer than that of any other indicted regicide, thanks to both his skilful self-defence, and the legally anomalous nature of the crown's case. After conviction and sentencing Cook abandoned any attempt to mitigate his role in the king's trial. Protesting in a letter to his daughter that &#145;thou art the Child of one whom God counted worthy to suffer for his sake&#146;, his confident avowals of spiritual assurance may also have helped comfort his wife, to whose tearful last farewell on the morning of 16 October he reportedly responded &#145;My dear Lamb, let us not part in a showre, God hath wiped away all tears&#146;  (<span class="italic">Speeches and Prayers</span>, 81, 82). Cook's scaffold speech at Tyburn asserted that &#145;I am not convinced of any thing I have done amisse, as to that I have been charged with&#146;  (ibid., 31). However, in a series of articles in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> (1913) J. B. Williams questioned the authenticity of <span class="italic">Speeches and Prayers</span>  (&#145;The forged &#147;Speeches and prayers&#148; of the regicides&#146;, <span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 11th ser. 7, 301&#150;2, and 8, 22&#150;3). As G. E. Aylmer has noted, &#145;John Cook, that epitome of honest Independency and frustrated reforming zeal, remains <i>sui generis</i>&#146;  (G. E. Aylmer, <span class="italic">The State's Servants</span>, 1973, 276). Samuel Pepys saw Cook's head in Westminster Hall on 21 October; it is unclear when or if his remains were buried. His widow, Frances, petitioned Charles II about 1664 for the recovery of land in Ireland bought with her marriage portion. She may have married William Proctor, army officer, about 1670, and after his death Acquilla Stoughton (<i>d. c.</i>1690) of Antigua. Free-love, her daughter, married John Gunthorpe, also of Antigua, in 1675. The suggestion in the 2004 edition of this article that Frances had died by 1659, when Cook married, second, Mary, daughter of Henry Chawner, of Barwell, Leicestershire, is based on a reference in John Nichols's <span class="italic">History of Leicestershire</span>, which probably refers to another John Cook.<br>
