<span class="headword">Perry,  John</span>  (1669/70&#150;1733), <span class="occ">hydraulic engineer and writer</span>, was born at Sinklow farmhouse in Rodborough, Gloucestershire, the second eldest son of Samuel Perry (1638?&#150;<i>c</i>.1690) and his wife, Sarah, daughter of Sir Thomas Nott. He joined the Royal Navy in his teens and was commissioned lieutenant in April 1689. While serving with the <i>Montague</i> in January 1690 he lost his right arm after remaining at his post for over an hour with an undressed wound during combat with a French privateer off Ushant. Over the next two years Perry designed a dry dock for large ships at Portsmouth Dockyard, constructing a powerful engine to pump water from it, and made a technically proficient dam gate which was tested in August 1691. Although the results are not clear, his efforts secured him the captaincy in February 1692 of the <i>Owner's Love</i> fireship, whose activities he described in eleven letters to the Navy Board.<br>
<br>After sailing to the West Indies early in 1693 under Admiral Sir Francis Wheler, Perry transferred to the <i>Cygnet</i> fireship attached to the <i>Diamond</i>, a frigate commanded by Captain Wickham, his superior officer. Cruising near Cape Clear on 20 September 1693, the <i>Diamond</i> was attacked and captured by two French privateers and Perry surrendered the <i>Cygnet</i>. On 30 April 1694 both captains were sentenced by court martial to ten years' imprisonment and a &pound;1000 fine for dereliction of duties. At the Marshalsea prison Perry wrote <span class="italic">A Regulation for Seamen</span> (1695), advocating the replacement of impressment by registering men as naval and merchant seamen for a maximum year's paid service followed by immunity from recall. In an appendix to this pamphlet, in his July 1694 petition to the Board of Admiralty, and in his court martial evidence  (ADM 1/5254), he defended his actions on the <i>Cygnet</i>: Wickham's swift capitulation and failure to signal orders had left him with no alternative but to surrender. Pardoned and acquitted by the lords justices in June 1697, he immediately designed a dry dock for Flushing port. In April 1698 Lord Carmarthen and the navy's surveyor-general introduced him to the visiting tsar of Russia, who recruited him for hydraulic engineering projects. Perry made a verbal agreement with the Russian ambassador for an annual salary of &pound;300, his expenses, and a bonus for each work completed. Arriving in Holland with the tsar on 26 April, he spent a week studying Dutch technology before travelling to Moscow.<br>
<br>Perry's first assignment, at Astrakhan, was to build a canal between the rivers Volga and Don to link the Caspian with the Black Sea. He surveyed a new cut through dry land, and work on the Volga&#150;Don Canal continued for three years. Hampered by a shortage of materials and manpower, it was finally halted by war in 1701. Perry was recalled to Moscow and appointed comptroller of the Russian maritime works. His next two projects centred on Voronezh: first between 1702 and 1703 he built a dam across the Voronezh River, above its junction with the Don, with a lock and draw-doors to float warships onto the bank for reconditioning. Then, between 1704 and 1705, he constructed a large lock further upstream, rendering the river navigable for even larger ships into the Don. While laying the foundations for his locks and sluices, he made an improved version of his Portsmouth pump to overcome problems of spring flooding. Perry's proposal (BL, Add. MS 37359, fols. 132&#150;5) for dry-docking and rot-proofing different classes of ships at Voronezh was initially approved and he carried out a survey in September 1706. In October that year Charles Whitworth, Britain's envoy to Russia, forwarded a similar scheme adapted by Perry for the British navy (BL, Add. MS 37359, fols. 136&#150;7 and 37355, fol. 133) to the Admiralty in London, via the secretary of state  (ADM 1/4091, fols. 89&#150;95). During 1710 Perry prospected a canal to link the rivers Neva and Volga so that corn and timber could be shipped from Kazan to St Petersburg. His proposed route followed the great lakes and interconnecting riverways, with a 3 mile cut which he proposed for the river watershed between lakes Onega and Beloye, down to the River Sheksna flowing into the Volga at Rybinsk (BL, Add. MS 37359, fols. 248&#150;52). The project faltered when Perry's petition for salary arrears was blocked by unreasonable conditions and dire threats, resulting in his departure from Russia at the end of June 1712 under the protection of Whitworth, then ambassador-extraordinary and -plenipotentiary, without &#145;Money, Pass or Discharge&#146;, as he explains in his book, <span class="italic">The State of Russia, under the Present Czar</span> (1716, 55). Widely read and translated into several European languages in numerous editions (1717&#150;36 and 1871), this uniquely influential work is of great interest in reflecting the contemporary views of a foreigner directly engaged in Peter the Great's attempts to reform and Westernize Russia. Written originally in hopes of employment and redress for thirteen years' unpaid Russian service, which he describes in detail, Perry's wide-ranging account paints a vivid picture of Russian life, dynamically contrasting the tsar's progressive, expansionist aims with the reactionary opposition of bureaucratic officialdom, the Orthodox church, and a corrupt nobility.<br>
<br>In 1716 Perry secured a contract to stem the breach in the Thames Embankment at Dagenham with a scheme characterized by innovative use of dovetailed piles. Perry's book <span class="italic">An Account of the Stopping of Daggenham Breach</span> (1721), graphically describes his epic feat of engineering and his outstanding technical success in surmounting two breaches, caused by a storm and by a negligent watchman, between 1716 and 18 June 1719, when the tide was finally removed from the levels. The &pound;15,000 granted him by parliament in 1721 for additional costs barely covered his expenses. Moreover, in February 1725 the House of Lords upheld a chancery ruling that Perry should pay William Boswell, the previous contract holder, &pound;1720, and costs, for his disputed use of materials from Boswell's abandoned Dagenham works. Perry's precarious financial position induced him to write four petitions to the privy council for a captain's half-pay allowance and for &pound;456 surplus money for the Dagenham fund, referred respectively to the Admiralty and Treasury in April 1725  (TNA: PRO, PC 1/4/9, 1, 3, 5, 7), but evidently without success.<br>
<br>In 1724 Perry moved from London to Rye, where he was appointed engineer to the planned new harbour works; his proposed works there were partly executed, but suspended for lack of funds. His more ambitious consulting and contracting engineering work for Dover harbour is evidenced by his 1718 survey, extensive correspondence (1722&#150;4) with the duke of Dorset, lord warden of the Cinque Ports, and the Dover harbour commissioners, as well as by his detailed and costed reports, proposals, maps, and assignments (BL, Add. MS 42075, fols. 43&#150;52).<br>
<br>Perry spent over eighteen months in Dublin between 1713 and 1726, planning to improve its harbour. Despite an offer to work for a foreign prince he renewed his proposals during 1721 on the recommendation of an Irish House of Commons' harbour committee, revisiting Dublin in 1725 at Lord Carteret's invitation, when he carried out a further survey for the port's ballast office with Thomas Burgh, surveyor-general of the ordnance, costing the projected works at &pound;13,001. He published an account in his Dagenham book, three pamphlets (1721 and 1725), and his map of Dublin Bay and harbour, reproduced in Gerry Daly's <span class="italic">Early Maps from the Dublin Port Board Collection</span> (Dublin port and docks board, pp. 5, 7&#150;8). Nevertheless nothing tangible seems to have resulted from his endeavours, and Perry continued to be perilously short of money.<br>
<br>In 1727 Perry was paid for his recommendations to make the Yorkshire Ouse navigable as far as York. From 1724 until 1729 when he settled in Spalding, Lincolnshire, as engineer to the Adventurers of Deeping Fen, Perry issued reports and published proposals in 1725 and 1727 for draining the fens. On 16 April 1730, when nearly 6000 acres of fenland were conveyed to him for financing his enterprises, Perry was elected an honorary member of the Spalding Gentlemen's Society. &#145;Some account of the works done by Captain Perry&#146; (1796), a substantial and fully indexed manuscript by its treasurer, Thomas Hawkes, documents more of Perry's activities during his last years. He died, unmarried, aged sixty-three, on 11 February 1733 and was buried two days later in Spalding's parish church where he was commemorated by a monumental inscription. An exceptionally able engineer, with views ahead of his times, Perry stands out for his indomitable spirit and resilience.<br>
