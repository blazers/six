<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lane,  Geoffrey Dawson</span>, Baron Lane  (1918&#150;2005), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 17 July 1918, at Crantock, Farley Road, Derby, the only son and youngest of the four children of Percy Albert Lane (1880&#150;1964), manager of Smith's Bank in Lincoln, and his wife, Polly, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dawson (1880&#150;1961), who had graduated in classics from Royal Holloway College, London.<h2>
<a name="Educationwarserviceandmarriage"></a>Education, war service, and marriage</h2>Lane was educated at Shrewsbury School, where he was head of school and a keen cricketer. He was awarded a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he achieved a first in part one of the classical tripos, when his education was interrupted by the Second World War. He joined the Royal Air Force and served throughout the war, initially as a pilot in Bomber Command, flying Wellington aircraft. His experiences were varied and highly dangerous. Apart from missions over Germany and occupied France his skills as a pilot were recognized when he was chosen to set up the RAF's first dedicated air postal services, using first the notoriously unstable Albermarle aircraft, and later the C47 Dakota. The purpose of the service was to ensure that British soldiers serving under General Montgomery in north Africa would receive their mail from home, an important contribution to morale. In February 1943, as a young squadron leader, he was entrusted by Winston Churchill with correspondence to be taken and flown south-west out over the Atlantic and then south-east, via Gibraltar, to Montgomery in north Africa. After Montgomery had read the documents he explained to Lane that the German army would attack the following morning at a specific time and place. It was only many years later that Lane realized that this intelligence must have been gathered through allied code-breaking achievements at Bletchley Park. Next morning Lane flew out of north Africa carrying Montgomery's hand-written response to Churchill, which Lane duly delivered, personally, to 10 Downing Street. For his work in Transport Command flying long-range aircraft to north Africa he was awarded the Air Force Cross in 1943.<br>
<br>On D-day and subsequent operations in 1944 Lane flew paratroops and supplies behind enemy lines, and once the bridgehead was established he flew supplies into and serious casualties out of France and back to England for treatment at the Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. In September 1944 he towed gliders on the Arnhem expedition and thereafter flew supplies in to support that doomed force. By 1945 he was stationed in India as part of the RAF contingent preparing for the invasion of Japan. He never spoke about his wartime experiences but those who served with him remembered him as an inspirational leader. His experiences were later put to good use when, as a QC, he led the investigation into the Vanguard crash at Heathrow in 1965 and, as a High Court judge, he was the chairman of the public inquiry into the Trident crash at Staines in 1972.<br>
<br>On 25 January 1944 Lane married, at North Wraxall church, Wiltshire, Jessie (Jan) Macdonald (1914&#150;2006), daughter of Donald Macdonald, farmer, of Tulloch, Aviemore. They had met in 1942 when Lane was a patient in an RAF hospital in Buckinghamshire and she was a nurse responsible for his care. Thus began a wartime romance that, for both of them, lasted a lifetime. They had one son.<h2>
<a name="Thebarandearlyjudicialcareer"></a>The bar, and early judicial career</h2>After demobilization Lane returned to Cambridge, again taking firsts, this time in parts one and two of the law tripos. He was called to the bar by Gray's Inn in 1946, became a pupil to Richard Elwes, and joined the midland circuit. Before his practice developed he supplemented his income by giving tutorials at Cambridge. However, his skills as an advocate, allied to his robust common sense, were immediately and obviously attractive, and he developed a huge and varied junior practice. A little unusually at that time he believed that however busy he was, the service to solicitors should be rapid. As his handwriting was always legible and tidy he dealt with relatively routine papers almost immediately, in handwriting, by return of post whenever possible.<br>
<br>One of Lane's last cases before he took silk in 1962 was the notorious trial of James Hanratty at Bedford assizes. Lane was junior counsel to the crown. After many years of controversy and passionate contention that Hanratty had suffered the supreme penalty when he was innocent it was a relief to Lane that in 2002 the development of DNA demonstrated beyond question that Hanratty was indeed guilty and rightly convicted of murder. In 1965 he acted for the Metropolitan Police in the inquiry conducted by Sir Daniel Brabin into the conviction and execution of Timothy Evans for a murder committed by the main prosecution witness against him, John Christie. These two cases reinforced Lane's strongly held views about capital punishment, to which he was opposed.<br>
<br>In 1965 Lane addressed a constitution of five judges on the vexed and complicated problem of joint enterprise by defendants resulting in death. His encapsulation of authorities from 1830 onwards was summarized in a single sentence, and his analysis of the principle was adopted virtually verbatim in the judgment of the court given by the lord chief justice, Hubert Parker, Baron Parker of Waddington. What is more, over forty years later this principle remained the source to which the courts dealing with the problem of joint enterprise returned time and again when doubt and uncertainty appeared to have crept into the law (<i>R. v. Rahman</i>, 2008).<br>
<br>Those who knew Lane as a barrister remembered in particular his generosity with his own limited time. Advice and help were always available. He was not prone to indulge younger barristers, or to allow them to be self-indulgent. His advice was always clear, and the language never left any doubt about his meaning. He then expected his interlocutors to consider what he had said, wished them luck, and left them to make up their own minds. Thereafter, throughout his judicial career, Lane was always tolerant of the young and the inexperienced, but he had no time for the idle and those who failed to prepare their cases properly. They were failing both their clients and their responsibility to the court. He had huge faith in the jury system, and confidence in the ability of the jury to decide when it was appropriate to convict and when to acquit. This loyal adherence to the constitutional primacy of the jury in criminal matters was later to expose him to vituperative and often ill-informed criticism.<br>
<br>Lane's first judicial appointment was as deputy chairman of Bedfordshire quarter sessions, in 1960. He was later deputy chairman of Lindsey quarter sessions and Rutland quarter sessions (becoming chairman of the latter when the previous incumbent stood down), and recorder of Bedford (1963&#150;6). After a glittering career at the bar, and only four short years in silk, and no doubt in part because of the extraordinary quality of his submission to Lord Parker in 1965, he was appointed as a judge of the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, in 1966. He was knighted the same year.<br>
<br>One memorable observation by Lane when, as a judge of the Queen's Bench Division, holding that quite considerable force was justified to prevent an obstruction of the highway by a violent and abusive driver, was that &#145;one did not use jewellers' scales to measure reasonable force&#146;  (<i>Reed v. Wastie</i>, 1972). This provided an early demonstration that his capacity as an advocate to capture the essence of a complicated legal problem in a few short words was undiminished by the assumption of his new office.<br>
<br>In 1974 Lane was promoted to the Court of Appeal and sworn of the privy council. Within a few months he identified the principle that applied when drunkenness and its possible effect on the defendant's state of mind was in issue: &#145;A drunken intent is nevertheless an intent&#146;  (<i>R. v. Sheehan and Moore</i>, 1975). More than thirty years later this simple, unequivocal direction continued to be used to direct juries whenever this issue arose.<br>
<br>Five years later, in 1979, Lane was appointed a lord of appeal in ordinary, taking the title Baron Lane, of St Ippollitts in the county of Hertford. In 1980, after only six months as a law lord, he was appointed lord chief justice. Many had thought that his elevation to the House of Lords might preclude this appointment, and his return to the Court of Appeal was enthusiastically welcomed. One wit summed up the general mood, &#145;Geoffrey Dawson, Baron Lane, nice to have you back again&#146;  (personal knowledge).<br>
<br>Lane had not sought office as lord chief justice. He and his wife were a private couple, hugely happy with each other and content with the company of friends. Neither wished for limelight. They realized that he was exchanging the low-key, intellectually stimulating, but essentially peaceful life of a law lord for a high-profile office. It was only his sense of public duty that led him to accept the appointment. He was, and for the rest of his life remained, modest, unpretentious, and unassuming. In a speech to his old circuit, at a dinner when his appointment was honoured, he explained that he had discovered that the first holder of the office of chief justiciar was Odo. With his marvellous ability to explode pomposity and bring his audience down to earth he continued, &#145;now you have got Thicko!&#146;  (personal knowledge). With his characteristic moral courage he went on to declare that the bar could not shuffle off responsibility for the inefficiencies of the criminal justice system, which he, as lord chief justice, would now have to address.<h2>
<a name="Lordchiefjustice"></a>Lord chief justice</h2>Lane was lord chief justice for twelve years. Two principles guided his own approach to the extra-judicial problems of his office. The maintenance of the independence of the judiciary was an absolute. In a speech in Malta in February 1990 he spoke of judicial independence as the &#145;foundation stone of freedom&#146; and &#145;something which it is never prudent to take for granted&#146;. He spoke of the judge as a &#145;vital part of the constitutional jigsaw puzzle&#146;. He continued:<blockquote>And what is the nature of that puzzle? It is surely this: how best to balance the rights and duties of the individual against the powers which the State must necessarily have if it is going effectively to govern &hellip; the duty of upholding the balance, in civilised communities passed on the judges, is of no value unless the judge is in a position to act according to his conscience without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.</blockquote>In his speech he made clear that he was &#145;truly&#146;, indeed &#145;avidly&#146;, non-political, &#145;both by reason of my profession and by reason of my own inclination&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sunday Times of Malta</span>, 11 Feb 1990). By then he had expressed himself in trenchant terms on the separate but equally critical principle of individual liberty for which so many of his generation had fought and died. He once said that<blockquote>loss of freedom seldom happens over night &hellip; oppression does not stand on the doorstep with a toothbrush moustache and a swastika armband. It creeps up step by step, and all of a sudden the unfortunate citizen realises that freedom has gone. (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 23 Aug 2005)</blockquote>This particular observation, reflective of his own deeply held personal commitment to the principle of individual freedom, was made in response to proposals to reform the legal profession advanced by the then lord chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. Treated as a reaction to intended legislation this was, and at the time was regarded as, intemperate and over-blown language. As a warning against the insidious effect of what appear at first to be only small encroachments on individual freedom it was salutary.<br>
<br>Lane's commitment to these overarching principles had some important practical consequences. He limited his contacts with politicians to the absolute minimum necessary to enable the business of the courts to be done. Shortly after his appointment he rejected attempts by the Home Office to involve the judiciary in the administrative aspect of sentencing policy and strategy on the basis that, in the long term, it would undermine the independence of the sentencing judge. In his last speech as lord chief justice, at the lord mayor's banquet on 9 July 1991, he drew attention to the vast increase in applications for judicial review which had taken place during his period of office and which, he suggested, demonstrated the need for an independent judiciary to resolve disputes between the individual citizen and the increasingly mighty executive. Without an independent judiciary the rights of the citizen would evaporate.<br>
<br>Within three months of his appointment Lane addressed the problem of dangerously overcrowded prisons and identified the principles that were subsequently repeated and continued throughout a plethora of statutes which addressed sentencing issues. His very first suggestion, in the context of dangerously overcrowded prisons, attempted &#145;to ensure, if an immediate custodial sentence is necessary, that the sentence is as short as possible, consistent only with the duty to protect the interests of the public and to punish and deter the criminal&#146;  (<i>R. v. Bibi</i>, 1980). This principle was repeated by successive lord chief justices. The decision in <i>R. v. Bibi</i> (1980) foreshadowed another of Lane's reforms of the sentencing process. &#145;We are not aiming at uniformity of sentence; that would be impossible. We are aiming at uniformity of approach&#146;  (ibid.). The sentencing decision was for the trial judge, but in Lane's view an endeavour to achieve a coherent approach to sentencing did not constitute an interference with judicial independence. This led to a series of new &#145;guideline&#146; cases, designed to address sentencing problems whenever what Lane described as a &#145;divergence&#146; of judicial approach had become apparent. Such cases included cases involving breach of trust, drugs, death by dangerous driving, incest, and rape. It became commonplace for the Court of Appeal criminal division to provide guidance to sentencers, and in 2003 the <span class="roman">Criminal Justice Act</span> created the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which represented the logical conclusion of Lane's belief that there should be a consistency of approach to similar sentencing problems throughout the country. The <span class="roman">Criminal Justice Act</span> 1988 granted the attorney-general the power to refer &#145;unduly lenient&#146; sentences to the Court of Appeal. Subsequent legislation significantly increased the types of case to which these powers applied. Again it was Lane who identified the applicable principles and commented: &#145;that mercy should season justice is a proposition as soundly based in law as it is in literature&#146;  (<i>Attorney-general's reference no. 4 of 1989</i>).<br>
<br>In short, from the beginning to the end of his period in office one of Lane's continuing concerns and major achievements within the criminal justice system was to keep the hugely complex issue of sentencing in individual cases constantly in mind, and to achieve a cohesive series of guiding principles which remained the foundation for subsequent legislative changes and judicial decision.<br>
<br>Another troublesome feature when Lane took office was that a number of serving judges did not appear to understand the difference between acting robustly and behaving discourteously and unfairly. Lane's sense of fairness was innate, and he well understood the importance of ensuring that the trial process should not only be fair, but should be perceived by the defendant, the jury, and anyone who happened to be in court, to be fair. He was quick to criticize judges who were unfair to defendants:<blockquote>however distasteful the offence, however repulsive the defendant, however laughable his defence, he was entitled to have his case fairly presented both by counsel and by the judge. Where the cards seemed to be stacked most heavily against a defendant, the judge should be most scrupulous to ensure that nothing untoward occurred. (<i>R. v. Marr</i>, 1989)</blockquote>Not least because Lane made clear that judicial misconduct taking the form of bullying and unfairness would not be tolerated it became very rare indeed.<br>
<br>A more intractable problem that Lane sought to address was the problem of unprepared, discursive summings up that confused rather than elucidated the issues. This type of summing up was described by him as &#145;hornswoggle&#146;. No judge hearing a summing up of his own described in this way would have regarded it as a compliment. Subsequent developments of the criminal law after his retirement meant that the lengthy summing up was not eradicated, but Lane's objective, that the summing up should be as short as possible consistent with the judge's duty, was universally understood.<br>
<br>It was in relation to the substantive criminal law that the brilliance of Lane's mind can best be appreciated. When dealing with appeals against conviction said to have arisen from errors of law his technique was to gather together all the relevant statutes and decided cases and to reduce huge and often difficult, sometimes irreconcilable, judicial statements into a sentence or two that encapsulated the essence of the principle. The technique that had served him so well as a QC in 1965 was revived time and again. Examples of these landmark judgments abound. They include dishonesty throughout the criminal law, duress, and mistake, where Lane expressed &#145;the utmost sympathy&#146; for the &#145;unfortunate recorder&#146; because the case &#145;raised issues of law which have been the subject of debate for more years than one likes to think and the subject of more learned academic articles than one would care to read&#146;  (<i>Gladstone Williams</i>, 1984). Typically, Lane's judgment covered a few brief pages. As a result of his determination to establish principle in easily understood English innumerable summings up were made more understandable and more readily understood.<br>
<br>Perhaps the most remarkable judgment produced by Lane involved the examination and discarding of the fiction that a husband who had sexual intercourse with his wife without her consent could not be guilty of rape:<blockquote>The idea that a wife by marriage consents in advance to her husband having sexual intercourse with her whatever her state of health and however proper her objections &hellip; is no longer acceptable. It can never have been other than a fiction, and fiction is a poor basis for the criminal law &hellip; where the common law rule no longer even remotely represents what is the true position of a wife in present day society, the duty of the court is to take steps to alter the rule if it can legitimately do so &hellip; the time has now arrived when the law should declare that a rapist remains a rapist subject to the criminal law, irrespective of his relationship with his victim &hellip; this is not the creation of a new offence, it is the removal of a common law fiction which has become anachronistic and offensive. (<i>R. v. R.</i>, 1992)</blockquote>Lane was distinctly media-unfriendly. In his view communication skills outside the terms of the judgment in court were unnecessary. Everything appropriate for a judge to say should be said in court. He would not accept that a less rigid (he would have contended, a less principled) approach would not have undermined the independence of the judiciary but rather would have produced a better understanding of what judicial independence means and why it matters. One consequence of his rigid self-denying ordinance never at any time, even after his retirement, to answer personal criticism was that he came to be known most widely as one of the three judges who, in January 1988, dismissed the appeals of the six men convicted of a terrorist bombing attack in Birmingham in 1975.<br>
<br>The judgment in this notorious case was massive, running to well over 150 pages of typescript. At the very end the judgment observed that, &#145;as with many cases referred by the Home Secretary to the Court of Appeal, the longer this case has gone on, the more convinced this court has become that the verdict of the jury was correct&#146;  (<i>R. v. Callaghan and others</i>, 28 Jan 1988). An analysis of the judgment shows that the court dismissed the appeals on the basis of the evidence available to it during the course of the lengthy hearing in late 1987, disregarding the campaigning and out-of-court comments by supporters and opponents of the appellants. The observation at the end of the judgment was no doubt intended to address and bring the controversy the case had generated to a conclusion. It was an uncharacteristic mistake for Lane to make, not least because one of the constant refrains throughout his judicial career was that allowance should always be made for the unforeseen and the unforeseeable. When, in 1991, the case returned to the Court of Appeal, although the issues before that court were not the same as those before the court in the first appeal, attention naturally focused on the last sentence in the judgment, which had attracted much attention at the time when it was spoken. The decision of the court in the second appeal demonstrated that the convictions were unsafe and unsatisfactory, and accordingly they were quashed. The criticism of Lane was immediate and personal. A hundred and forty MPs signed an early day motion, in effect urging that the lord chief justice should resign immediately. The royal commission on criminal justice, chaired by Viscount Runciman, was appointed, not least because public confidence in the administration of criminal justice was inevitably undermined by concern that six men had been imprisoned for so many years before their convictions were eventually quashed. Lane was the focal point for these criticisms and concerns, and in the immediate aftermath he was treated as if he were the embodiment of all the perceived deficiencies in the criminal justice system. History will lend a kinder perspective, and Lane's many remarkable achievements as lord chief justice will come to be more widely appreciated.<br>
<br>It was later suggested that, as a result of the second Birmingham six appeal, Lane retired early. He did not. Despite the hostility of the personal criticism directed against him he remained in office, continuing to provide judgments of the highest quality and offering encouragement and support to his colleagues. In one of his very last judgments, Stefan Kiszko's appeal against his conviction for murdering a young girl, after he had served many years in prison, was quashed. Later scientific advances led to the conviction of another man for this murder. Lane's fortitude during this difficult period reinforced the warm admiration and respect of his judicial colleagues. When, at his valedictory, in April 1992, Lord Donaldson, the master of the rolls, spoke of giving voice &#145;to the anger and disgust which we have felt at the campaign of calumny waged against you in recent months&#146;  (personal knowledge), he was accurately reflecting the views of the judicial bench as a whole that an outstanding lord chief justice had been unfairly traduced.<br>
<br>Lane was made an honorary bencher of the Inner Temple in 1980 and an honorary fellow of his old college in 1981, and was made an honorary LLD of Cambridge in 1984. After his retirement to Hitchin, Hertfordshire, he became a trustee of the Prison Reform Trust, and chaired the committee on the penalty for homicide, which in 1993 urged the abolition of the mandatory life sentence for murder. He died at the Lister Hospital, Stevenage, on 21 August 2005, of heart failure, and was survived by his wife and son. After his death Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC, who in his time represented many clients associated with unpopular causes, observed that &#145;by common consent of the legal profession, Lane was a very great Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Guardian</span>, 23 Aug 2005). Perhaps in Lane's case truth may indeed be the daughter of time.<br>
