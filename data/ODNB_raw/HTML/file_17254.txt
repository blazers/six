<span class="headword">Lynch,  Henry Blosse</span>  (1807&#150;1873), <span class="occ">explorer in Mesopotamia</span>, born on 24 November 1807, was one of the eleven sons of Major Henry Blosse Lynch (1778&#150;1823) of Partry House, Ballinrobe, co. Mayo, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1845), daughter of Robert Finnis of Hythe, Kent. Among his brothers were <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17261/', "Thomas Kerr Lynch")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17257/', "Patrick Edward Lynch")</script>. Henry Blosse joined the Indian navy as a volunteer, under the name of Henry Lynch, in 1823, and was rated as midshipman on 27 March the same year. He was employed for several years on the survey of the Persian Gulf. He had a talent for languages, and made a close study of Persian and Arabic. On his promotion to lieutenant in 1829 he was appointed Persian and Arabic interpreter to the Gulf squadron, a post he held until 1832. During that time he was repeatedly employed in negotiations with the sheikhs of the Arab peoples of the gulf. He obtained leave from India in 1832 and was shipwrecked in the East India Company brig <i>Nautilus</i> in the Red Sea; after leaving his shipmates, he crossed the Nubian Desert north of Abyssinia, descended the Nile to Egypt, and thence shipped home.<br>
<br>In 1834, owing to his great local knowledge and general abilities, Lynch was selected as second in command of the expedition under Colonel Francis Rawdon Chesney to explore the Euphrates route to India, as well as to extend British political and commercial influences in the area. Lynch made preparations for the landing of the expedition in the Bay of Antioch, and chose a site near Bir or Birecik, on the Euphrates, for slips, in which the two steam vessels sent out from England in pieces were put together. He was constantly employed in delicate negotiations with neighbouring sheikhs, displaying much tact and judgement. When the two steamers were launched, Lynch received command of the <i>Tigris</i>, and surveyed over 500 miles along the River Euphrates. On 21 May 1836 the <i>Tigris</i> foundered in a hurricane, with the loss of twenty lives, including Lynch's brother Richard Blosse, lieutenant in the 21st Bengal native infantry. This episode underlined the difficulty of riverine transport and suggested that seagoing steamships were still the best means of communication with India. After Chesney's return to England in 1837, Lynch was given command of the expedition, and ascended the Tigris to a higher point than had ever before been reached, carried out extensive surveys, and completed the Tigris map in 1839. He was a useful source of intelligence to the British government during a politically tense period.<br>
<br>Lynch was promoted commander on 1 July 1839. The court of directors of the East India Company, anticipating important results from the navigation of the rivers of Mesopotamia, sent out that year, round the Cape, in pieces, under charge of Michael Lynch, Henry Blosse's brother and a lieutenant in the Indian navy, three river-steamers. They were specially constructed by McGregor Laird, whose company had provided Chesney's steamers and was to develop close ties with the Royal Geographical Society and government. The steamers were put together at Basrah, near the delta, and in 1840 four steamers were regularly sailing between Baghdad in the interior and Basrah. During Lynch's absence in 1841 two of his party steamed up the River Euphrates as far as Beles. Lynch resumed command at Beles in the autumn of 1841, when a base-line for the Mesopotamian survey was measured on the plain between Beles and Jiber, and connected by chronometric measurements with the Mediterranean. Ironically, the result of the two Euphrates surveys was to reveal the superiority of the sea compared with the river route to India. Lynch proceeded to Baghdad, and remained there in charge of the postal service between Baghdad and Damascus until late in 1842. He continued to advocate the importance of the riverine link and, writing to the Royal Geographical Society and Admiralty, pointed out the strategic and political advantages which would accrue to Britain if she exerted her influence in the area.<br>
<br>Lynch commanded a flotilla off the mouth of the Indus in 1843, keeping open communication with Sir Charles James Napier's army in Sind. From that time until 1851 he was employed as assistant to the superintendent of the Indian navy, and a member of the oriental examination committee at Bombay, where he was a very active member of the Bombay Geographical Society. He became captain on 13 September 1847, and was appointed master attendant in Bombay dockyard in 1849. In 1851&#150;3, as commodore, he commanded a small squadron of vessels of the Indian navy, which served with the Royal Navy during the Second Anglo-Burmese War, at the conclusion of which he was made CB. He returned to Britain, and on 13 April 1856 retired from the service.<br>
<br>Lynch established himself in Paris. At the end of the Anglo-Persian War of 1856&#150;7 he was delegated by Lord Palmerston to conduct the negotiations with the Persian plenipotentiary, which resulted in the treaty of Paris of 4 March 1857. The shah, in recognition of his services, nominated him to the highest class of the Lion and Sun. Henry was probably the brother with whom Thomas Kerr Lynch founded the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, which operated under the protection of the Foreign Office, in 1862. Lynch should not be confused with Captain William Francis Lynch, United States navy, whose surveys of the Jordan and Dead Sea were made a few years later, and were, like Lynch's, reported in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</span>. Lynch died at his home at 6 rue Royale, Faubourg St Honor&eacute;, Paris, on 14 April 1873. He left a widow, Caroline Ann, whom he had married in August 1838, daughter of Colonel Robert Taylor, at one time political resident at Baghdad.<br>
