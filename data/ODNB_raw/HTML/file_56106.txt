<span class="headword">Cooke,  Mary Lamley</span>  (1841&#150;1916), <span class="occ">peace campaigner</span>, was born on 3 August 1841 at Gastard in Wiltshire, eldest of the three children of James Cooke (1809&#150;1888), schoolmaster and private tutor, and his wife, Phoebe (1811&#150;1890). By the age of twenty-one James Cooke was headmaster of the Friends' school at Wigton, but he preferred private tutoring. The family moved to Darlington, where he taught the family of Joseph Pease, and then, after a short period in Manchester, to Cork. In her early years Mary Cooke also taught, though she devoted most of her time to taking care of her parents. She did, however, develop an early interest in the peace cause and was secretary of the Cork Peace Association. After her father's death in 1888, she moved with her mother to Wandsworth, to live with her brother's family, and embarked upon a career of peace advocacy.<br>
<br>In 1890 Cooke became the assistant secretary of the Peace Union, the central association of a network of more than thirty local Christian absolute pacifist groups set up by Priscilla Hannah Peckover and run mostly by Quaker women. The secretary at the time was another Quaker activist, Ellen Robinson (1840&#150;1912), with whom Cooke travelled around the country addressing meetings in favour of international arbitration, mutual disarmament, and the involvement of women in the peace cause (Cooke took over as secretary in 1903 after Robinson retired). In 1896 she began to edit a peace journal, <span class="italic">War or Brotherhood?</span> (begun in 1889 as <span class="italic">Messiah's Kingdom</span>, the organ of the short-lived interdenominational Christian Union for Promoting International Concord). <span class="italic">War or Brotherhood?</span> was often more outspoken on political events than the peace committee of the Society of Friends, of which Mary Cooke was also a core member. In 1899, for example, the journal called for an immediate and specific protest against the South African War when the Society of Friends was unwilling to make such a protest. Although she had no party political influence, Cooke, along with influential Friends such as Edward Grubb and J. W. Graham, played a part in reminding Quakers of the importance to their faith of pacifism, at a time when the peace testimony was not central to the identity of many Friends and when the largely Quaker-funded Peace Society was increasingly moribund. <span class="italic">War or Brotherhood?</span> ceased publication in 1909, but Cooke continued to write pamphlets, in particular for use in schools.<br>
<br>With Joseph Frederick Green (1855&#150;1932) Cooke was joint honorary secretary of the first four occasions of the National Peace Congress (1904&#150;7) and of the National Peace Council, which was originally set up to organize the congresses. The initial impetus for these gatherings came from the Friends' peace committee, which proclaimed &#145;the desirability of more closely uniting those interested in the promotion of Peace in the United Kingdom, with the object of a national growth of the Peace Movement&#146;. During the Edwardian period the National Peace Council and the National Peace Congress were successful in co-opting many representatives and bodies of progressive opinion into the specifically organized peace movement. As this demonstrates, Mary Cooke, though an absolute pacifist, was keen to collaborate with non-absolutist peace activists both in Britain and abroad: as a delegate from the Peace Union and the Friends' peace committee she attended the international peace congresses which were held most years from 1889 to 1913, and at which were aired a variety of peace ideologies.<br>
<br>A frail, slight figure with a pronounced stoop, Mary Cooke was quiet and lacked a natural buoyancy of temperament. She was, however, a highly respected minister at the Kingston monthly meeting and sat on Friends' committees dealing with a variety of social subjects. Her pacifism was unshaken by the war, and she was soon to travel to a women's international congress at The Hague when laid low by illness. She died in Letchworth on 4 January 1916.<br>
