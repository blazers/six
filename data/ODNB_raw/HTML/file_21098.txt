<span class="headword">Page,  William</span>  (1590&#150;1664), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex, and probably baptized there on 20 December 1590, one of at least two sons of Richard Page, and his wife, possibly Frances Mudge. His father's profession is unknown, but several members of the family were barristers of the Inner and Middle temples; a brother, John, was a master in chancery. Page entered Balliol College, Oxford, on 7 November 1606, graduated BA in 1610, and proceeded MA in 1614 (incorporated at Cambridge in 1615). In 1618 he became a fellow of All Souls, becoming bachelor of divinity in 1621 and attaining the doctorate in 1634. He was known within the university as a preacher and polemicist, tending towards the Arminian side in the then current disputes within the Anglican church.<br>
<br>His first published work, <span class="italic">A Treatise Justifying Bowing</span> (1631), was a 266 page treatise defending, against the attacks of William Prynne, the Arminian practice of bowing at the name of Jesus during prayer. Archbishop Abbot attempted to prevent its printing as unnecessarily provocative, but was overruled by his nominal subordinate, William Laud, then bishop of London; the Calvinist professor of divinity, John Prideaux, was obliged to issue an imprimatur. From 1634 Page was rector of Hannington, Hampshire, and at some point he became chaplain to Walter Curll, bishop of Winchester from late 1632, whose ecclesiological outlook he evidently shared. Page's translation in 1639 of Thomas &agrave; Kempis's <span class="italic">De imitatio Christi</span> was noteworthy mainly for its introduction, which followed the fashionable eirenic line that the different churches ought to practise charity towards one another, and chided the Catholics for their insistence that salvation was impossible outside their version of the faith. A suggestion that all Christians, from papists to Socinians, should find unity in a crusade against the Turks says little for his sense of political reality. While ready to admit that all sides of the current religious disputes were sincere in their beliefs, he saw this as an argument for settled authority within the church, and was unable to accept the conclusions of John Hales and William Chillingworth that reason could be a valid criterion. In his 1642 <span class="italic">Animadversions</span> to Hales's <span class="italic">Tract Concerning Schism</span> he was concerned to register his dissent from Hales's attack on hierarchical authority; this, he argued, was dangerous, and there was no knowing where it might lead.<br>
<br>In addition to his published works Page left a number of manuscripts, preserved in the Bodleian and various Oxford college libraries. Two are on the special merits of women and of widows, a genre popular in the 1620s; others deal with more esoteric themes&#151;the existence of paradise, and the state of the soul when separated from the body. In 1635 he wrote an opinion for the warden and fellows of All Souls that praying for the soul of their founder, Henry V, did not necessarily imply a papistical belief in purgatory.<br>
<br>Sequestered from his rectory at Hannington in 1646 by the committee for plundered ministers, apparently more for absence than for any doctrinal reasons, Page was appointed in January 1647 by All Souls to the vacant rectory of East Lockinge, then in Berkshire. His name does not appear as a fellow at the time of the parliamentary visitation in 1648, but is mentioned in connection with a college election in 1657. Anthony Wood and various later writers have erroneously conflated him with another William Page MA and later BM of St John's College, Oxford, sometime schoolmaster at Reading. Page does not seem to have married. He died in 1664 and was buried at East Lockinge on 19 February, leaving goods to an inventory value of &pound;67 14<i>s</i>. and, in a will dated 20 November 1661, naming a nephew, Nathaniel Page, as residual legatee.<br>
