<span class="headword">Watson,  William John Ross</span>  (1865&#150;1948), <span class="occ">Gaelic scholar</span>, was born in the parish of Kilmuir-Easter, in Ross-shire, on 17 February 1865, the son of Hugh Watson, blacksmith, and his wife, Maria Ross; he was a native speaker of the Gaelic of that area. He graduated in classics at Aberdeen University in 1886, and repeated the first class he had achieved there at Merton College, Oxford, in 1889 and 1891. He was rector of Inverness Royal Academy from 1894 to 1909, and head of the Royal High School in Edinburgh from 1909 to 1914, when he was appointed to the chair of Celtic in the University of Edinburgh. At Oxford he had attended the classes of Sir John Rhys, and during his Inverness years he was friendly with Alexander MacBain. These influences helped to focus his scholarly gifts on Celtic, and especially Scottish Gaelic, studies. In 1904 he published <span class="italic">The Place-Names of Ross and Cromarty</span>, and place-name study remained an abiding preoccupation. In 1916 he delivered the Rhind lectures on archaeology, and from these there ultimately came his most extensive and ambitious book, <span class="italic">The History of the Celtic Place-Names of Scotland</span> (1926). The study of place names in Scotland had never been organized under the detailed county-by-county system used in England, and Watson had to break new ground in many different ways: as collector, organizer, and philologist. He was well aware of the tentative nature of some of his conclusions, especially on names of Welsh, Pictish, and Norse origin, and he may have relied overmuch at first on MacBain's etymological findings. Some of the detail in his explanations of names has been challenged, but his book is still widely consulted, and Watson deserves great credit and lasting recognition for this monumental achievement.<br>
<br>In the course of his own schooling, and especially during his rectorship at Inverness, Watson must have been acutely aware of the inadequate range of textbooks for Gaelic students, and he made two important contributions in this area, publishing an anthology of Gaelic prose from the twelfth century to the twentieth in <span class="italic">Rosg G&agrave;idhlig</span> (1915) and of Gaelic verse from the sixteenth century to <i>c</i>.1900 in <span class="italic">B&agrave;rdachd Gh&agrave;idhlig</span> (1918). These anthologies were long used in school and university teaching, and helped to create more rigorous editorial procedures.<br>
<br>Watson now expanded his literary studies very purposefully, studying the surviving body of classical Gaelic verse dating from medieval and early modern times. He published editions of individual poems and discussions of this genre as practised in Scotland, in 1917, 1922, and 1931, and in 1937 there appeared his major contribution to such researches, <span class="italic">Scottish Verse from the Book of the Dean of Lismore</span>. Here he presented the first scrupulously edited text of many poems from this sixteenth-century manuscript, which includes a large range of classical verse and heroic balladry. It was a daunting task, and one which could not be definitively completed by any one individual, but there were few advances on his work in the succeeding half-century. Appropriately, this was the first volume in the series published by the Scottish Gaelic Texts Society, a society which owed its establishment largely to Watson. He had published regularly in the <span class="italic">Celtic Review</span> and also in the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness</span>, and he edited the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> for many years. In 1913 and 1915 he published articles in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</span> on circular forts in Lorn and Perthshire. Hugh Watson, a son of his first marriage and a prominent lawyer in Edinburgh, continued the family connection with the Scottish Gaelic Texts Society, acting as secretary into the 1960s.<br>
<br>Watson retired from the chair of Celtic in 1938 after a distinguished career which established new parameters in several fields of Celtic study. After the death of his first wife, he married, in 1906, Elizabeth Catherine (Ella) Carmichael, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48849/', "Alexander Carmichael")</script>. Their only son, James Carmichael Watson, succeeded his father in the chair of Celtic in 1938, and edited two volumes of Alexander Carmichael's <span class="italic">Carmina Gadelica</span> before losing his life in 1942 during World War Two. Watson died in Edinburgh on 9 March 1948, and was still a positive influence on Gaelic scholarship at the end of the twentieth century.<br>
