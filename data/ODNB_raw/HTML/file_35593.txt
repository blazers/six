<span class="headword">Power, Sir  D'Arcy</span>  (1855&#150;1941), <span class="occ">surgeon and historian</span>, was born at 3 Grosvenor Terrace, Pimlico, London, on 11 November 1855, the eldest of six sons and five daughters of Henry Power, then assistant surgeon at the Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital, and his wife and first cousin, Anne, daughter of Thomas Simpson, a banker and shipowner of Whitby, Yorkshire. Power was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and entered New College, Oxford, in 1874 as a commoner. As biology was not taught at New College he transferred to Exeter College, in 1877, with an open exhibition; he obtained his BA with first-class honours in natural science (physiology) in 1878. That year he entered St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school, and he qualified BM in 1882. Power married in 1883, Eleanor (<i>d</i>. 1923), younger daughter of George Haynes Fosbroke, a medical practitioner of Bidford, Warwickshire. They had two sons, the younger of whom died of wounds received in action at the second battle of Ypres in 1915, and one daughter, who died aged two of whooping cough. The elder son became an air vice-marshal in the Royal Air Force Medical Service.<br>
<br>Power spent the whole of his surgical professional life at St Bartholomew's. He was house surgeon to W. S. Savory, and ophthalmic house surgeon to his father. He served as curator of the museum, as demonstrator in operative surgery, and as demonstrator in surgical pathology. He was appointed assistant surgeon in 1898, surgeon in charge of the throat and nose department from 1902 to 1904, and full surgeon in 1904. He resigned this last appointment in 1920, when he was elected consultant surgeon and a governor to the hospital. In 1934 he was appointed the hospital archivist and began a systematic survey of the hospital's medieval muniments. At the Royal College of Surgeons, Power became a fellow in 1883, served as examiner, was a member of council from 1912 to 1928, and was vice-president in 1921 and 1922. He gave the Bradshaw lecture for 1919, the Vicary lecture for 1920, and was the Hunterian orator in 1925. He was appointed honorary librarian in 1929 and a trustee of the Hunterian Museum in 1930. Power joined the Volunteer Medical Staff Corps in 1888 and was commissioned major on formation of the Royal Army Medical Corps's Territorial Force in 1908. During the First World War he was lieutenant-colonel and surgeon to the officers hospital at Fishmongers' Hall from 1914 to 1916, and then at the 1st London General Hospital until 1920. He published <span class="italic">Wounds in War</span> in 1915 and was appointed KBE in the peace gazette of June 1919.<br>
<br>Power took a leading part in many professional and learned societies. At various times he was president of the section of the history of medicine and of the section of comparative medicine at the Royal Society of Medicine (1926&#150;8), president of the Bibliographical Society (1926&#150;8) and of the Harveian Society, chairman of the Royal Medical Benevolent Fund, and the holder of various offices in the Pathological Society. He was a corresponding member or honorary fellow of many learned societies both at home and overseas. A keen freemason, he served as consultant surgeon to the Freemasons' Hospital (later the Royal Masonic Hospital). He was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1897. Power visited the USA in 1924 and 1930, lecturing on the foundations of medical history, and he went to Australia in 1935.<br>
<br>As a surgeon Power was a rapid and skilful operator, and an early pioneer of abdominal and paediatric surgery in this country. He was at his best in emergency operations. Power wrote extensively on surgery, including a number of textbooks, but his real mark was as a scholar and historian of medicine. He contributed a historical article to almost every number of the <span class="italic">British Journal of Surgery</span> from its beginning in 1913; some 200 &#145;lives&#146; to the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>; numerous historical articles (many unsigned) to the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>; and he edited the <span class="italic">Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of England</span>, published in 1930. He also wrote the entries for the subsequent (1930&#150;51) volume of the <span class="italic">Lives</span>, between 1930 and 1940, almost up to his death; it was published in 1953. Among his historical publications are <span class="italic">William Harvey</span> (1897), one of the best short studies of this subject, <span class="italic">Portraits of Dr William Harvey</span> (1913), <span class="italic">Foundations of Medical History</span> (1931), <span class="italic">A Short History of Surgery</span> (1933), and <span class="italic">Mirror for Surgeons</span>, an anthology (1939). Power edited and in 1910 published the manuscripts of the English works of the fourteenth-century surgeon, John of Arderne; he also translated his Latin treatises (published in 1922).<br>
<br>Power was a modest unselfish man. Having been poor in his early life, he remained simple and approachable. He was widely loved and trusted for his integrity and friendliness. Power was of middle height, small featured, wore a moustache, and had keen blue eyes. During the second half of his life, he lived in a small house in Chandos Street, Cavendish Square, next door to the Medical Society of London. His home contained his large collection of books, including a remarkable collection of editions of the <span class="italic">Regimen of Salerno</span>. He developed heart failure soon after his eighty-fifth birthday; his house had been damaged in air raids in the autumn of 1940, and he moved to his son's home, 53 Murray Road, Northwood, Middlesex, where he died on 18 May 1941. He was cremated and his ashes were buried in his wife's grave at Bidford, Warwickshire. The following month his library was sold at Sothebys.<br>
