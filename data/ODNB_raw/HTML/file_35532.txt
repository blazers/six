<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pippard,  (Alfred John) Sutton</span>  (1891&#150;1969), <span class="occ">civil and aeronautical engineer</span>, was born on 6 April 1891 at Yeovil, the eldest child in the family of three sons and two daughters of Alfred Pippard (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1908), a building contractor, and his wife, Alice, the daughter of John Sutton, a glover. He attended Yeovil School (1899&#150;1907) and then Merchant Venturers' College at Bristol where, in 1911, he graduated with first-class honours in civil engineering. (In 1909 the college had become the faculty of engineering of the university.) He then worked as an articled pupil with the consulting engineer A. P. I. Cotterell, and subsequently as assistant engineer with the Pontypridd and Rhondda Valley Joint Water Board. While there he wrote in his spare time an MSc dissertation on &#145;The masonry dam&#146; which was accepted by Bristol University in 1914.<br>
<br>Soon after the outbreak of the First World War, having learned that his sight would bar him from a commission in the Royal Engineers, Pippard joined the newly formed technical section of the air department of the Admiralty, to work on aircraft structures and stressing. With men such as Alec Ogilvie, Henry Tizard, and J. L. Pritchard, Pippard made significant contributions to the improvement and safety of aircraft, for which in 1918 he was appointed MBE. He married, in January 1918, (Frances Louisa) Olive Field (1892&#150;1964); they had two sons: Dr John Pippard and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/99761/', "Sir A. Brian Pippard")</script>, professor of physics at Cambridge. In 1919 Pippard and Pritchard published their well-known book, <span class="italic">Aeroplane Structures</span>, and in 1920 Pippard gained the DSc degree of Bristol University. From 1919 to 1922 he was in partnership with Ogilvie in the latter's firm of consulting aeronautical engineers and also gave lectures at Imperial College under Leonard Bairstow. This experience convinced Pippard that his proper sphere lay in the academic world. In 1922 he was appointed professor of engineering at University College, Cardiff. Understaffed, with restricted laboratory facilities, the engineering department at Cardiff differed little from those of other British provincial universities at that time. Pippard transformed this situation, turning the teaching of the theory of structures into a scientific discipline, actively promoting and participating in research, and generally raising the intellectual level of civil engineering courses in the country. These activities he continued while professor of civil engineering at Bristol from 1928 to 1933. Pippard was by early training and inclination a civil engineer. So when opportunity arose to go to Imperial College, a large department with close connections with the Institution of Civil Engineers and the profession, he accepted without hesitation. He was professor of civil engineering and head of department there from 1933 until his retirement in 1956.<br>
<br>During this period chairs were established under his guidance in hydraulics and concrete technology, four readerships were created, flourishing postgraduate courses were set up, and research was undertaken on an unprecedented scale. Pippard himself continued lecturing and directing research in theoretical and experimental structural analysis, notably on arch dams. His work in 1952&#150;4 for Binnie &amp; Partners on the design of the 116 metre high Dokan Dam in Iraq was of special importance and opened a new era in a field to which his research assistant, Letitia Chitty, later Telford gold medallist and fellow of Imperial College, went on to make notable contributions. He also gave much attention to public health engineering, so that a readership in this subject was founded in 1950; he was chairman (1951&#150;61) of the influential government investigating committee on pollution of the tidal Thames.<br>
<br>His publications include eighty papers and five books. Of these, <span class="italic">The Analysis of Engineering Structures</span> (with J. F. Baker, 1936) became a classic in engineering literature.<br>
<br>Pippard was elected FRS in 1954. He served on the council of the Institution of Civil Engineers from 1944 and was president in 1958&#150;9. In 1964 he received the Ewing gold medal for exceptionally distinguished engineering research. He held honorary degrees from Bristol, Birmingham, and Brunel, and was pro-rector of Imperial College (1955&#150;6) and visiting professor at Northwestern University, USA (1956&#150;7). He died at his home, 1 Dorset House, St Johns Avenue, Putney, London, on 2 November 1969.<br>
