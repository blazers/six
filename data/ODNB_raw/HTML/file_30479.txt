<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Asquith,  Anthony</span>  (1902&#150;1968), <span class="occ">film director and aesthete</span>, was born on 9 November 1902 in London, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30483/', "Herbert Henry Asquith, first earl of Oxford and Asquith (1852&#150;1928)")</script>, the Liberal statesman and future prime minister, and his second wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30482/', "Margaret Emma Alice (Margot) Asquith (1864&#150;1945)")</script>, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36455/', "Sir Charles Tennant")</script>, merchant and art patron. There were five children of this marriage, two of whom survived. Of these two, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1945) was six years older than Anthony (who was universally known by his childhood name of Puffin). There were also five children of H. H. Asquith's first marriage.<br>
<br>Anthony Asquith was educated at Summer Fields, Oxford, Winchester College, and Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained second classes in both classical moderations (1923) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1925). He had a passionate love of music from an early age but, deciding that he was not talented enough for a professional career, concentrated on his other great interest, the cinema. After leaving Oxford in 1925, Asquith, a founder member of the Film Society in London, was invited to study the American industry in Hollywood, as a guest of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford.<br>
<br>On returning home after six months Asquith joined H. Bruce Woolfe's British Instructional Film Company in 1926. Thereafter, unlike Alfred J. Hitchcock and many other leading figures in British cinema, Asquith never left London to work in Hollywood. He was essentially English in his tastes and his style, a characteristic that was his greatest strength but also, owing to the restricted nature of the native industry, one that imposed technical and financial limitations on his work. Most of his best films were screen adaptations of West End plays, opened out for the cinema, but with a limited conventional use of the flexibility that technical developments brought to film-makers in his lifetime. His artistic and personal integrity, coupled with a sensitive literary and visual imagination, won the respect of all his studio associates from the leading international film stars to the humblest technicians, and enabled him to create a wholehearted devotion for any feature he made. In an industry whose outstanding directors were often flamboyant hectoring egotists, Asquith was modest and undemonstrative, and got his way by persuasion and attention to his craft. It was not surprising that when the Association of Cinematographic Technicians was created in 1937, Asquith was invited to become the first president and retained this position until his death in 1968, a fitting tribute to the &#145;technicians' director&#146;.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Shooting Stars</span> (1927), for which he was scriptwriter and assistant director, began a decade in which Asquith was a film <i>auteur</i>, who directed from his own scripts. His first independent success was <span class="italic">A Cottage on Dartmoor</span> (1929)&#151;one of the last, and best, British silent films. A growing reputation was enhanced by <span class="italic">Tell England</span> (1930&#150;31), based on the 1915 Gallipoli campaign, but this was unfortunately followed by six years of making less distinguished films for uncongenial company producers. Asquith's service in Alexander Korda's studio at Denham ended after one film, <span class="italic">Moscow Nights</span> (1935), remarkable only for an early screen appearance by Laurence Olivier. Few men could have been more unalike than the gentle Asquith and the overbearing Korda.<br>
<br>This frustrating period ended with <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span> (1938), probably Asquith's greatest achievement. He wrote the script, in consultation with George Bernard Shaw, author of the successful play of that name, and encouraged the experienced Leslie Howard and the comparatively unknown Wendy Hiller to give outstanding performances as Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolittle. Asquith had discovered his m&eacute;tier, the transformation of plays written for middle-class London theatre audiences into films that would appeal to the much wider cinema-going public. He managed to popularize the material without debasing its quality.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Pygmalion</span> was followed by <span class="italic">French without Tears</span> (1939) with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31586/', "Terence Rattigan")</script>, the author of many of his films over the next twenty years. One of the few breaks in this partnership linked Asquith with a very different playwright, Samuel Beckett, in the creation of a short film, <span class="italic">Zero</span> (1960). During the war Asquith directed two documentaries, one an introduction to Britain for American servicemen entitled <span class="italic">Welcome to Britain</span> (1943), successful feature films such as <span class="italic">Quiet Wedding</span> (1940) and <span class="italic">Fanny by Gaslight</span> (1944), and films with a political or war interest&#151;<span class="italic">The Demi-Paradise</span> (1943) and <span class="italic">The Way to the Stars</span> (1945). After 1945 Asquith formed a company with Terence Rattigan to film the latter's stage successes <span class="italic">While the Sun Shines</span> (1947), <span class="italic">The Winslow Boy</span> (1948), <span class="italic">The Browning Version</span> (1950), and a tribute to English cricket, <span class="italic">The Final Test</span> (1952). He also supervised brilliant screen versions of Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">The Importance of being Earnest</span> (1951) and Shaw's <span class="italic">The Doctor's Dilemma</span> (1958).<br>
<br>Surprisingly, and sadly, Asquith's one professional excursion into the musical world which he loved so much, as producer of <span class="italic">Carmen</span> for Covent Garden in 1953, was not very successful. He was more at ease with films that combined a fictional story with shots of stage performances of ballet, as in <span class="italic">The Young Lovers</span> (1945) and the earlier <span class="italic">Dance Pretty Lady</span> (1931), and of opera, with <span class="italic">On such a Night</span> (1955)&#151;devoted to an evening of Mozart at Glyndebourne. In the mid-1950s he directed several successful television films of ballets danced by Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev. The greater appreciation of ballet and opera by British television audiences in the 1960s and 1970s came unfortunately too late for Asquith, who would have been exceptionally well suited to make such productions.<br>
<br>In the last years of his career Asquith was employed by the big international companies who dominated the industry to direct expensive films for the world market, such as <span class="italic">The VIPs</span> (1963) and <span class="italic">The Yellow Rolls-Royce</span> (1964), very different from the restrained, essentially English works with which he had made his name. In December 1963 he had a serious automobile accident. Although he recovered, and within four months was directing the last film he was able to complete, he was never again fully fit. While working in Italy on a film of <span class="italic">The Shoes of the Fisherman</span>, he was taken ill and died in London of cancer on 21 February 1968. He never married. He was buried in All Saints' churchyard, Sutton Courtenay, Berkshire.<br>
<br>Asquith is best remembered for his early contributions to British cinema when it was seeking to evolve a distinctive style to compete with the American domination of the market. Although he helped to achieve this in the 1930s and 1940s, the British industry, like Asquith himself, was too delicate to flourish long in the face of the superior resources of the United States. He will be remembered also for his modesty, charm, and sincere concern for all who worked with him and for him. His dress was casual, wayward at times, and endeared him to his many friends, who ranged from distinguished figures in public affairs, banking, and the arts, to working men and women. Having been brought up in 10 Downing Street, he was at home and happy in stately homes or in lorry drivers' caf&eacute;s. Asquith's outstanding physical features were the long, delicate fingers of a pianist, always gesticulating, as though they were trying to keep up with the quickness of his thought and speech. His strong, finely cut features seemed sometimes at odds with his careless dress, and suggested that he was in too much of a hurry to meet and help people to waste much time on external appearances. Lord David Cecil wrote &#145;There are people in this confused and distracted age who question the possibility of human goodness. No one could do so who knew Anthony Asquith&#146;  (Minney, 229).<br>
