<span class="headword">Davidson,  John Thain</span>  (1833&#150;1904), <span class="occ">minister of the Presbyterian Church of England</span>, was born on 25 April 1833 at Broughty Ferry, near Dundee, one of the twin sons of David Davidson (<i>d</i>. 1843), parish minister of Broughty Ferry, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Dr Ireland of Leith. His grandfather, Dr David Davidson of Dundee, and his great-grandfather were also ministers of the Church of Scotland. John's father left the established church in 1843, and, after his death a few months later, his mother moved to Edinburgh, where many leaders of the Free Church visited their house. Davidson was educated at Edinburgh high school and at Edinburgh University, and studied for the ministry at the Free Church Theological College.<br>
<br>After a few months in charge of a mission station at Craigmill in Perthshire, and as a probationer in Free St George's, Montrose, Davidson was ordained on 19 February 1857 a minister of the Free Church at Maryton, near Montrose, and remained there until 1859, when he was inducted minister of the Presbyterian church at Salford. On 4 October 1859 he married Isabella, daughter of M. M'Callum of Glasgow. They had two sons and six daughters.<br>
<br>In 1862 Davidson moved to the Presbyterian church, Colebrooke Row, Islington, where he greatly increased the size of the congregation. He then turned his attention to non-churchgoers, and from 1868 held services in the Agricultural Hall every Sunday afternoon, for twenty-three years. Speakers included the earls of Shaftesbury, Aberdeen, and Kintore, the bishops of Ballarat and Bedford, Canon Fleming, the vicars of Islington, Holloway, and Clerkenwell, Dr Guthrie, and Dr Talmage; the meetings were soon attracting regular attendances of 4000. From 1878 he also delivered monthly sermons to young men in Islington, and published some of these in <span class="italic">Talks with Young Men</span> (1884), <span class="italic">Forewarned, Forearmed</span> (1885), <span class="italic">The City Youth</span> (1886), <span class="italic">Sure to Succeed</span> (1888), <span class="italic">A Good Start</span> (1890), and <span class="italic">Thoroughness</span> (1892).<br>
<br>In 1872 Davidson was elected moderator of the synod of the Presbyterian church of England, and was awarded a DD by Montgomery College, Alabama. After nearly thirty years in Islington, in 1891 he became minister of St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Ealing. Davidson died at his home, 23 Park Hill, Ealing, on 7 November 1904, and was buried in the churchyard at Stoke Poges.<br>
