<span class="headword">Stewart,  John</span>, tenth or first earl of Lennox  (1424<span class="mult">x</span>9&#150;1495), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Sir Allan Stewart of Darnley (<i>d</i>. 1438). His mother was probably Catherine Seton (<i>d</i>. 1468&times;76), a daughter of the Sir William Seton killed at the battle of Verneuil in 1424. John was born some time between 1424 and 1429, given the terms of a marriage contract of 15 May 1438 describing him as under the lawful age for matrimony. The contract of 1438 suggests that he was then outside Scotland, probably in France, where his father, like numerous members of the Darnley Stewart family, spent many years in military service to the French crown.<br>
<br>John Stewart is first recorded as active in politics on 22 February 1452, when he was one of the courtiers of James II involved in the killing of William, eighth earl of Douglas, in Stirling Castle. According to the Auchinleck chronicle, John was created a lord of parliament as Lord Darnley in June 1452, and he was using this title by 13 March 1453. His elevation to the parliamentary peerage was probably a reward for his role in the killing of Douglas and for his support of the king during the ensuing political crisis.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Darnley's overriding ambition was to validate his claim to all or part of the earldom of Lennox. He was the grandson of John Stewart of Darnley and Elizabeth of Lennox, who were married shortly after 23 September 1406. Elizabeth was one of the three daughters of Duncan, earl of Lennox (executed in 1425). After 1437 Lennox had been held by Earl Duncan's eldest daughter, Isabella, duchess of Albany and countess of Lennox, the widow of Murdoch, duke of Albany. Isabella died without any legitimate heirs and in the years following her death Darnley pursued a claim to half of Lennox as the grandson of Countess Isabella's sister Elizabeth. The other half of the earldom was claimed by Sir John Haldane of Gleneagles and John Napier of Merchiston, husbands of the granddaughters of Earl Duncan's third daughter, Margaret of Lennox. Darnley's most serious rival, however, was Andrew Stewart, Lord Avondale, chancellor of the kingdom, who was the illegitimate son of Countess Isabella's son Walter.<br>
<br>On 12 October 1463 Darnley petitioned parliament asking to be recognized as heir to the lands of half the earldom of Lennox and offering to supply the crown with a force of 100 spearmen and 50 bowmen for one year if his claims were allowed. James III's minority government did not respond to this petition, perhaps because of Avondale's influence, though on 4 February 1465 Darnley was given custody of the royal fortress of Rothesay on Bute. He continued to pursue his claims in the Lennox, but on 4 April 1471 his ambitions received a setback when James III granted the liferent, or life ownership, of Lennox to Avondale. Darnley's heritable right to half the lands of the earldom and the comital title was eventually acknowledged by James III when on 27 July 1473, after prolonged litigation, he granted Darnley an instrument of sasine. By 6 August 1473 Darnley had adopted the title of earl of Lennox; there was little material benefit for him since James III insisted that Avondale's liferent of the earldom should be honoured.<br>
<br>Worse was to follow for Darnley on 12 January 1476: the king revoked the earlier grants in his favour and instead recognized Sir John Haldane of Gleneagles as the senior coheir to the earldom of Lennox on the basis that Margaret of Lennox, the grandmother of Haldane's wife, was senior to Elizabeth of Lennox, Darnley's grandmother. After the king's decision Darnley was forced to cede the comital title&#151;this despite his recent service to the crown in the suppression of the rebellion of John, lord of the Isles, for which on 4 December 1475, Darnley was given the powers of a royal lieutenant in Renfrew, Ayr, Wigtown, Kirkcudbright, Clydesdale, and the islands of Bute and Arran.<br>
<br>On 8 May 1477 Darnley was shown some royal favour when he was reconfirmed as keeper of Rothesay Castle, while in March 1482 he received the wardenship of the west marches. He also played a significant, if rather enigmatic, role in the political crisis which followed the arrest of James III by his half-uncles John, earl of Atholl, and James, earl of Buchan, at Lauder on 22 July 1482. Custody of the captured king, who was held in Edinburgh Castle, was assigned to Darnley. On 19 October 1482, after he had been released, James III issued a letter of remission in Darnley's favour, saying that he had protected the king during his captivity from those who wished him harm. This suggests that Darnley, although involved in the king's incarceration, was not inclined to support any extreme action to remove James III from the political scene.<br>
<br>In 1488, however, Darnley took an active part against the king in a rebellion under the nominal leadership of the king's son and heir, James (the future James IV). Darnley's son Matthew was associated with the rebel lords by May 1488, and he and his father were probably both members of the host which defeated the king's army at Sauchieburn on 11 June 1488. The death of James III at Sauchieburn and the accession of the young James IV allowed Darnley to renew his claims to the earldom of Lennox, while the death of Lord Avondale, who had the liferent of the earldom, during the summer of 1488 cleared another obstacle.<br>
<br>Darnley had readopted the title of earl of Lennox before 6 October 1488, and on 20 October he and his son Matthew were given custody of Dumbarton Castle by James IV's minority government. Yet by April 1489 the new earl of Lennox was in rebellion against the regime he had helped install. He, Matthew, and Robert, Lord Lyle, were forfeited in parliament in June 1489, and by July the earl was besieged in Dumbarton Castle. In September Lennox was reinforced by another force from the north-east, led by Alexander Gordon, master of Huntly, but on 11 October the rebels were defeated by James IV's army at the battle of Gartloaning, near Aberfoyle. Lennox retreated to Dumbarton and his rebellion was eventually ended by negotiation in December 1489. On 5 February 1490 the forfeitures imposed on Lennox, Matthew Stewart, and Lord Lyle were annulled in parliament. Shortly after the battle of Gartloaning the rebels explained their action in a petition to the new king complaining about the way in which James IV's government was dominated by a number of named lords who had risen to power and authority as a result of James III's unavenged death, and who now shamelessly misused their influence in the minority regime to further their own ends. Lennox now occupied a position of political strength, and he exploited this to secure agreements (18 May 1490 and 11 July 1493 respectively) whereby the Napier and Haldane claims to the comital title were abandoned in return for uncontested possession of a quarter of the comital estates. He died in 1495, between 31 August and 11 September.<br>
<br>Lennox is usually said to have been married to Margaret Montgomery, the eldest daughter of Alexander Montgomery, lord of Ardrossan, by the terms of a marriage contract of 15 May 1438. He was certainly married to a Margaret Montgomery by 20 July 1461. There is, however, no conclusive evidence that his wife in 1461 was the same as the Margaret mentioned in the 1438 contract, and an alternative identification of Margaret as a daughter of Alexander, master of Montgomery, and hence a niece of the Margaret of 1438, has recently been suggested. Lennox and Margaret had a number of children, including: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26496/', "Matthew Stewart")</script>, who succeeded his father as earl of Lennox and died at Flodden on 9 September 1513; William, lord of Oizon and de Grey in France, who spent most of his career as a soldier in France and died before 1503; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26503/', "Robert Stewart")</script>, lord of Aubigny, who served in the French army and attained the rank of mareschal, and died without heirs in 1543; John, lord of Oizon, another career soldier in French service, who died in 1512; Elizabeth, who married Archibald Campbell, second earl of Argyll; Marion, who married Robert Crichton, son of Lord Crichton of Sanquhar (contract dated 8 May 1472); Janet, who married Ninian, Lord Ross of Halkhead; and Elizabeth, who married Sir John Colquhoun of Luss.<br>
