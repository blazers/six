<span class="headword">Lawraunce,  Ane</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1610), <span class="occ">gentlewoman</span>, is known only for a letter she wrote in May 1610 to Thomas Sutton, a businessman and moneylender, proposing that he name her as a beneficiary in his will. The letter is currently lodged with the other Sutton documents (LMA, ACC 1876 F3 351) and, transcribed by Joseph Crowley, is reproduced in <span class="italic">&#145;The Muses Females Are&#146;: Martha Moulsworth and other Women Writers of the English Renaissance</span>, edited by Robert Evans and Anne Little (1995). Lawraunce describes herself as &#145;a poore gentelwoman and a maide&#146;, &#145;youndge&#146;, living in Battersea, Surrey. Her father could not provide for her, while her own &#145;infirmyties in my heade and eyes&#146; prevent her employment. The manner of her argument and its intertextual references to biblical and classical sources suggest that Lawraunce was both intelligent and very well educated.<br>
<br>Lawraunce had previously sought to borrow &pound;200 from Sutton, renowned for lending credit, meeting him twice. Despite her undoubted eloquence, which can be gauged in the letter itself, Sutton stuck to sound business principles and refused to lend the money without security. Her commentary on his decision displays her personal determination and perspective on their potential business arrangement, which provides a counterbalance to Sutton's business and worldly ethics:<blockquote>I coulde not give yow sitch security wich worldly wise men to mutche staundes upon; yet by godes healpe I woulde with all possible speade as justly have paide that mony againe and interest for it as if the Excheacor of Einglaunde had bin my Seaurety. (&#145;&#147;A sutor for my selfe&#148;&#146;, 271)</blockquote>This binary opposition, between his worldly ethics and her view of charity, informs the tenor and rationale of Lawraunce's letter to Sutton: her beneficiary request is postponed until the last two paragraphs of the letter, while the main part is a sermon-like exhortation on the need for charity and repentance before death. Her letter displays a sophisticated use of literary and rhetorical tools. Its structure clearly follows the seven-part Ciceronian oratory model and she includes classical, Christian, and native English literary modes and sources within this rhetorical structure. She frames her argument within a Christian <i>memento mori</i> tradition; she interweaves quotations and language from <span class="roman">Proverbs</span> and the gospels, and includes secular stories. The interlinking of the secular and the Christian both promises Sutton that redemption is possible and argues that this will be through charity to her. The whole argument is an intellectual <i>tour de force</i>, which unfortunately did not convince Sutton to name her as a beneficiary.<br>
