<span class="headword">Rawley,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1588&#150;1667), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and literary editor</span>, was born in Norwich, of unknown parentage. On 22 January 1600 he was admitted <span class="roman">Bible</span> clerk of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he was tutored by a Mr Chapman, and, after graduating BA in 1605 and MA in 1608, was elected fellow and tutor on 19 March 1610. Ordained at Peterborough on 18 April 1611, on 10 December 1612 he was instituted by the university to St Michael's in Bowthorpe, Norfolk, a post he held until his death, the church being &#145;neglected and laid in decay, without any Service, it being esteemed as a Sine-Cure&#146;  (Blomefield, 1.638). He proceeded BD in 1615. His fellowship was briefly suspended in April 1616, after he protested against the enforced appointment of the master's son as fellow.<br>
<br>By this time Rawley was chaplain and &#145;amanuensis, or daily instrument&#146; to Sir Francis Bacon  (Bacon, <span class="italic">Opuscula</span>, (a) 2<i>r</i>), aiding him in preparing texts for publication; Bacon's influence caused Corpus Christi to give Rawley the Cambridgeshire rectory of All Saints, Landbeach, in 1616. After his fall in 1621 Bacon recommended Rawley, who that year proceeded DD, to his successor as lord keeper, John Williams, but Rawley remained with Bacon. In <span class="italic">A Sermon of Meekenesse, Preached at the Spittle upon Easter Tuesday</span> (1623), he claimed that &#145;whatsoever is any way eminent either in my Estate, or Name, I am ready to ascribe it to your Lordship, from whence I have received it&#146;  (A2<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). After Bacon's death Rawley devoted his life to creating an unblemished portrait of his master, compiling a volume of commemorative verse, and editing, translating, and publishing selections of his work, culminating in the <span class="italic">Resuscitatio</span> (1657) and <span class="italic">Opuscula varia posthuma</span> (1658), which contained (in English and Latin respectively) his hagiographical but highly influential life of Bacon. His editorial endeavours led to correspondence with intellectuals including John Selden, Isaac Gruter, and Elie Diodati.<br>
<br>During much of this period Rawley served as chaplain to Charles I, and attracted the patronage of Elizabeth of Bohemia. He returned to Landbeach in 1638, and married Barbara Weld, widow, daughter of a former Cambridge alderman, John Wicksted; they had two children, Mary, who died in infancy, and William. During the civil war Rawley encountered dissent within his flock, perhaps on political grounds: in 1644 twelve Landbeach men petitioned at Cambridge against him, and in 1652 he leased the rectory, presumably leaving the village.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Rawley was appointed chaplain to Charles II. In 1661 he was elected to convocation as proctor of clergy for the Ely diocese, and subscribed the revised <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>. His son, who had graduated BA from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in 1660 and been elected a fellow there in 1663, forfeited his fellowship in 1666 by failing to take deacon's orders, but the king intervened to persuade Corpus Christi &#145;to suffer William Rawley still to employ his fellowship there&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1665&#150;6</i>, 386). However, William the younger, Barbara Rawley, and several servants of the family died of the plague the same year. Rawley himself died at Landbeach on 18 June 1667, and was buried in his church there. Beneficiaries of his will, drawn up on 12 January 1667, included his brother, Alderman Rawley of Norwich, numerous nieces and nephews, his stepsons Wicksted, Martin, John, and Matthew Weld, and Corpus Christi College, which received several of his books.<br>
