<span class="headword">Thomas,  Samuel</span>  (1626/7&#150;1693), <span class="occ">nonjuring Church of England clergyman</span>, was born at Ubley in Somerset, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27243/', "William Thomas (1592/3&#150;1667)")</script>, the rector there, and his wife, Thomasine (<i>d</i>. in or after 1667). A student at both Cambridge and Oxford during the interregnum, Samuel Thomas matriculated pensioner at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in Lent term 1646 and graduated BA in 1649, before moving in 1651 to St John's College, Oxford, where he was made a fellow. Incorporated at Oxford on 20 August 1651, he proceeded MA on 17 December 1651.<br>
<br>Though his father was a presbyterian who was ejected from Ubley in 1662 Samuel Thomas was a devoted episcopalian from early on in his life. In the early 1650s, much to the displeasure of his father, he encouraged George Bull, the future bishop of St David's and at that time William Thomas's student, to read episcopalian writers such as Henry Hammond and Richard Hooker in the hope of winning Bull over to Anglicanism. In October 1658 William Thomas complained to Richard Baxter how his son was &#145;in a dangerous condition &hellip; being now 30 year old &amp; yet unsetled in divers more material points of religion, &amp; propending &hellip; in things controverted to the worse side of the controversie&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.351). Samuel was sent to live with or near Baxter, but the hope that their regular conversation would set Samuel &#145;in the right way&#146; was disappointed  (ibid., 1.405). Baxter sent him back to his father in August 1659. Samuel, he wrote, was unwilling to dispute &#145;originall sin, &amp; speciall grace &amp; many of the rest in which we differ&#146; either orally or &#145;expeditiously&#146; in writing. Baxter could &#145;live comfortably&#146; with Samuel, &#145;he being of a quiet disposition, &amp; a blamelesse disposition&#146;, but as a busy man he simply did not have time &#145;to follow him any further in his way of copious &amp; long deliberated writings&#146;. That form of debate could as well be done without Samuel's living with him, and indeed the two do seem to have maintained a correspondence for a while  (ibid., 1.404). The errors which William Thomas deplored in his son&#151;his &#145;Exaltation of natural (which is ever corrupt) reason above its due pitch&#146;, a preference for &#145;natural Theology&#146; and &#145;presumption &hellip; upon natural parts&#146;&#151;all suggest the influence of an important strand developing within Anglican theology  (ibid., 1.405). In early 1660 Samuel sought the advice of Henry Hammond on the question of original sin.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Samuel Thomas was deprived of his fellowship at St John's by the royal commissioners, despite his episcopal leanings. However, John Fell, dean of Christ Church, Oxford, appointed him as chaplain or petty canon there. He held this position until his appointment in 1672 as chantour of Christ Church, vicar of St Thomas, Oxford, and curate of Holywell. The people of Oxford frequently visited these two suburban parishes because of &#145;his edifying way of preaching&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.908). Then, in 1681, he was made vicar of Chard, Somerset, and prebendary of Compton Bishop (3 August 1681) by Peter Mew, bishop of Bath and Wells. His refusal of the oath of allegiance to William and Mary after the revolution of 1688 led to the loss of both ecclesiastical posts on 1 February 1691. Never an active nonjuror Thomas died suddenly on 4 November 1693 at Chard aged sixty-six, and was buried in the chancel of the church on 15 November 1693. There is no evidence that he ever married.<br>
<br>Despite his presbyterian roots Thomas became a strong apologist for the episcopal establishment and an outspoken opponent of Calvinism, leading Anthony Wood to speak of the &#145;unblameableness of our author's deportment and strictness and regularity of his life&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2.908). His books included <span class="italic">The presbyterians unmask'd, or, Animadversions upon a nonconformist book called the &#145;Interest of England in the matter of religion&#146;</span> (1676). In 1680 he wrote a preface to the second edition of Thomas Tompkins's <span class="italic">The New Distemper</span>, republished in 1681 under the title <span class="italic">The dissenter disarmed, or, A melius inquirendum upon a nonconformist book; viz, the &#145;Interest of England in the matter of religion&#146;</span>, where he rejected any attempts at conciliation with the dissenters, stating that the &#145;Presbyterian Party ought not in justice or reason of state to be protected and (much less encouraged), but to be rejected and depressed&#146;  (p. 195). His other works included <span class="italic">The charge of schism renewed against the separatists, in an answer to the renewer (John Humphrey) of that pretended peaceable design, which is falsely called, &#145;An answer to Dr. Stillingfleet's sermon&#146;</span> (1680); <span class="italic">Remarks on the Preface to the &#145;Protestant Reconciler&#146;, in a Letter to a Friend</span> (1683); and possibly the anonymous <span class="italic">Animadversions upon a Late Treatise Entit. &#145;The Protestant Reconciler&#146;</span> (1683). These works earned him the enmity of his dissenting opponents, not least Richard Baxter, who referred to him as a &#145;shameless writer&#146;  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>, 3.2389).<br>
