<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Petit, Sir  Dinshaw Manockjee</span>, first baronet  (1823&#150;1901), <span class="occ">cotton merchant and philanthropist in India</span>, was born at Bombay on 30 June 1823, the elder of two sons of Manockjee Nasarwanji Petit (1803&#150;1859), a Parsi merchant, and his wife, Bai Humabai (1809&#150;1851), daughter of J. D. Mooghna. In 1805 his grandfather, Nasarwanji Cowasjee Bomanjee, migrated from Surat to Bombay, where he acted as agent to French vessels and those of the East India Company. On account of his small stature, his French clients gave him the cognomen of Petit, and, in accordance with Parsi custom, this, pronounced in the English manner, became the family surname. Dinshaw was educated in Bombay. He went, at the age of nine, to a school run by a pensioned sergeant named Sykes, and later to a more ambitious seminary kept by messrs Mainwaring and Corbet. At the age of seventeen he became a clerk on a monthly salary of 15 rupees (then the equivalent of &pound;1 10<i>s</i>.) in the mercantile office of Dirom, Richmond &amp; Co., of which his father was Indian manager. He married on 27 February 1837 Sakerbai (<i>d</i>. 1890), daughter of Framjee Bhikhajee Panday, of Bombay, and they had three sons and eight daughters. Subsequently his father built up a large broker's business, in which Dinshaw and his younger brother, Nasarwanjee, became partners in 1852, carrying it on after their father's death in May 1859 until 1864, when they divided a fortune of about Rs 2.5 million and separated by mutual consent.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Dinshaw inaugurated the cotton manufacturing industry which made Bombay the Manchester of India. A cotton mill was started for the first time in Bombay in 1854 by another Parsi, Cowasjee Nanabhai Davur, but it spun yarns only. In 1855 Dinshaw persuaded his father to erect a similar mill with additional machinery for weaving cloth. This mill commenced work as the Oriental Spinning and Weaving Mill in 1857. In 1860 he and his brother started the Manockjee Petit mill, which they converted into a joint-stock company.<br>
<br>The problems encountered by the Lancashire cotton industry during the cotton famine of 1861&#150;5 encouraged wild speculation in Bombay, but Dinshaw Petit maintained his self-control and reaped colossal gains. Other mills were soon built by him, or came under his management, and he led the way in the manufacture of hosiery, damask, other fancy cloths, sewing thread, and also in machine dyeing on a large scale. Before his death he had the major shareholding in six joint-stock mills, aggregating nearly a quarter of a million spindles and 2340 looms, and employing 10,000 workers. He was thus mainly responsible for the conversion of the town and island of Bombay into a great industrial centre.<br>
<br>In addition to his entrepreneurial activities, Dinshaw Petit played a prominent role in early nationalist politics in Bombay. He was a founder member of the influential Bombay Presidency Association in 1869 and became its president in 1883. In 1888 the association split, with radicals supporting the newly formed Indian National Congress, and moderates, including Petit and most of the Parsi merchant community, maintaining a more pro-British stance.<br>
<br>Dinshaw Petit was also a co-founder of the powerful Bombay Mill-Owners' Association in 1874, of which he became chairman from 1878 until 1883. This body, composed, unusually, of both Indian and European businessmen, was formed to represent employers' views on industrial relations. Petit had conservative opinions on this subject and opposed the introduction of factory legislation to regulate the Bombay mill industry in 1875.<br>
<br>Dinshaw Petit served on the board of the Bank of Bombay; he was a justice of the peace for the city, and for a short time a member of the municipal corporation; he was sheriff of the city, 1886&#150;7. He served on the legislative council of the governor-general, 1886&#150;8, being the first Parsi to receive that honour. Knighted in February 1887, he was created a baronet of the United Kingdom on 1 September 1890, with special limitation to his second son. Petit was the second native Indian to receive this hereditary title, the first being Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy.<br>
<br>Throughout western India, Dinshaw Petit showed public spirit in the disposal of his great wealth. He arranged for the housing of the Bombay technical institute&#151;a memorial of Queen Victoria's jubilee of 1887&#151;in the manufacturing district of the city. He founded the Petit Hospital for Women and Children; gave 100,000 rupees (equivalent to nearly &pound;7000) towards building a home for lepers; erected a hospital for animals as a memorial to his wife; and presented property both in Bombay and Poona for research laboratories. A devout Parsi, he was always attentive to the claims of his own community, and in various places where small colonies of them were to be found, he erected for their use fire temples and towers of silence (places for the disposal of the dead).<br>
<br>Petit died at his Bombay residence, Petit Hall, on 5 May 1901, and his remains were committed to the towers of silence, Hill, the same day. At the <i>oothumna</i>, or third day obsequies, charities were announced amounting to Rs 638,551. Petit's second son, Framjee Dinshaw, on whom the baronetcy had been entailed, predeceased his father on 8 August 1895, and his eldest son, Jeejeebhoy Framjee (<i>b</i>. 7 June 1873), became second baronet under the name of Sir Dinshaw Manockjee Petit.<br>
