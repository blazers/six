<span class="headword">Osler,  Abraham Follett</span>  (1808&#150;1903), <span class="occ">glass manufacturer and meteorologist</span>, was born on 22 March 1808, the eldest son of Thomas Osler, glass manufacturer of Birmingham, and his wife, Fanny Follett. From 1816 to 1824 he was educated at Hazelwood School, near Birmingham, which had been established on progressive lines by Thomas Wright Hill. On leaving school Osler joined his father's firm. In 1831 he took over its management and developed it with energy and ability, especially in the manufacture of fine decorative crystal glass. He married, in 1832, Mary, daughter of Thomas Clark, a Birmingham merchant and manufacturer. Three of their eight children survived him.<br>
<br>In 1835 the Birmingham Philosophical Institution purchased a set of conventional meteorological instruments which required an observer to take readings at certain times. Osler, recognizing the need for reliable self-recording instruments, designed and constructed an apparatus combining a pressure plate anemometer to register wind speed, a vane to register wind direction, and a siphon gauge to register rainfall. The working parts of each instrument were linked to pencils which traced their records continuously on a sheet of paper moved along by clockwork. Earlier attempts to record the meteorological elements had been ineffective, whereas Osler's apparatus, erected at the institution (where it ran for sixty-five years) and publicized at the British Association meeting of 1837, was recognized to be both cheap and effective, its records of considerable value to meteorology. Examples were installed in the temporary magnetic observatories established in 1840 at St Helena, Toronto, and the Cape of Good Hope. Osler continued to improve it and versions of his anemometer were installed at Greenwich observatory in 1841, at London's Royal Exchange, at Plymouth, Inverness, and Liverpool observatory. When Robinson cup anemometers came into use, after 1846, Osler fitted a self-recording mechanism, thus obtaining mean hourly velocities as well as total mileage of wind. Later, records of pressure, direction, velocity, and rainfall were caused to register on the same timed chart.<br>
<br>Encouraged and supported by the British Association, Osler developed the way in which the records were drawn, enhancing their characteristic features and pointing up the interaction of the meteorological elements. Thus he was able to show, by a series of monthly, quarterly, annual, and mean diurnal wind records, the average distribution of winds during each part of the day and for the different seasons. He also demonstrated the similar nature of the mean diurnal wind and temperature records, a feature which Sir David Brewster had independently discovered in 1840. Brewster paid tribute to Osler's labours, describing his results concerning anemometry as the most important since meteorology had taken its place among the physical sciences.<br>
<br>Osler himself urged the establishment of observatories in different latitudes, which he believed would show the importance of the sun in creating atmospheric turbulence. To the British Association meeting in 1865 he showed the interesting and valuable results that could be obtained by close comparisons of air movements recorded at Wrottesley, Liverpool, and Birmingham. On the grand scale, he showed the relation of atmospheric disturbances to the trade wind systems and the effect of the earth's rotation on northerly and southerly wind flows.<br>
<br>Other interests also occupied Osler: after delivering three lectures on chronometry and its history at the Birmingham Philosophical Institution in January 1842 he collected funds and set up a standard clock for Birmingham in front of the institution, and to regulate it he provided a transit instrument and an astronomical clock for its rooftop observatory. Subsequently, without telling anyone, he altered the clock from Birmingham to Greenwich time, and, though the difference was remarked on, one by one church and private clocks were adjusted to match it, while the rest of the country was keeping local time. Craniometry also attracted him: he devised and constructed an accurate instrument for brain measurements, which gave full-sized diagrams of the exact form of the skull.<br>
<br>Osler was elected FRS in 1855. He retired from business in 1876, devoting himself thereafter to scientific pursuits. He was elected fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society only in 1882. Osler was a generous benefactor to his native city, to which he presented a clock and bells, matching those on the law courts in London, for the new municipal buildings. His donations of &pound;5000 to the Birmingham and Midland Institute, and a like sum to Mason's College, later Birmingham University, were anonymous. Osler died at his home, South Bank, Harborne Road, Edgbaston, on 26 April 1903, and was buried at Birmingham.<br>
