<span class="headword">Burrows,  Herbert</span>  (1845&#150;1922), <span class="occ">socialist organizer</span>, was born on 12 June 1845 in Redgrave, Suffolk, the son of Amos Burrows, tailor and Chartist leader, and his wife, Ann, formerly Thompson, a dressmaker. He educated himself using Cassell's shilling handbooks, and became a pupil teacher at the age of thirteen. He then became an excise officer in the Inland Revenue, serving in Norwich, Barnet, Blackburn, and Chatham. In 1869 he married Mary Hannah (1845&#150;1889), daughter of Charles Musk, engineer; they had a daughter and a son. In 1872 he entered Cambridge University as a non-collegiate student but did not take a degree. He continued in the Inland Revenue service until 1907, when he resigned to concentrate on voluntary activities.<br>
<br>Burrows moved to London in 1877, and by the early 1880s was active in the National Secular Society and the Social and Political Education League, for which he lectured regularly to radical and working men's clubs. He became vice-president of the Manhood Suffrage League, the most important of these clubs. In 1881 he joined H. M. Hyndman in forming the Democratic Federation, which in 1884 became the Social Democratic Federation, the first important socialist organization in Britain. He was appointed its treasurer in 1883, supported its overt commitment to socialism in 1884, and was one of its best-known propagandists. He wrote articles for its newspaper, <span class="italic">Justice</span>, often using the pseudonym C. V. He helped the federation to organize demonstrations against unemployment throughout the mid-1880s, and, when these climaxed in clashes with police during the riots of 1887, he represented it on the executive of the Law and Liberty League, formed to promote popular control of the police. There were moments of light relief. In December 1887 he wrote a sermon which socialists wanted the bishop of London to preach; as the sermon was reprinted in the labour and national press of America, so its origin was lost, and the impression given that the bishop really had resigned to commit himself to socialism. Burrows played a particularly important role within the federation because of his links with radicals and secularists, its main recruiting grounds. These links were especially notable in Tower Hamlets, where he stood unsuccessfully as a candidate in the 1885 election to the London school board.<br>
<br>Throughout the 1880s Burrows complained about wage levels and working conditions for unskilled women. In July 1888 he and Annie Besant organized a successful strike of match girls at Bryant and May, which attracted much publicity and widespread sympathy. The strike led to the formation of the Union of Women Matchmakers, with Burrows as its treasurer. The union, with 800 members, was the largest women's trade union in England at the time. Furthermore, the success of the strike, and the emergence of the union, helped to inspire the new unionism of the 1890s. Here too Burrows was not idle; he promoted unionization among chain makers, mat makers, omnibusmen, silk weavers, and others. He remained active in the Women's Trade Union League and the Women's Industrial Council until 1917.<br>
<br>Within the federation Burrows stood out for the peculiarly ethical nature of his socialism. He came from a nonconformist family, and helped found a Unitarian church in Cambridge, before drifting towards secularism. His socialism incorporated aspects of his search for a spiritual and moral basis to life. He thought the weakness of most socialism lay in its crude materialism and consequent overemphasis on social conditions. He wanted to temper this crude materialism with an ethical revolt against individualism: a revolt to inspire a genuine, social democracy characterized by the abolition of class interests, and the recognition of the duties of individuals to the social whole. He pursued his spiritual and ethical concerns as an Appointed Lecturer for the South Place Ethical Society; as a member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/47827', "Rainbow Circle")</script>, a discussion group of social reformers concerned with the ethical basis of progressivism; and, from 1889 onwards, as an active member of the Theosophical Society, and later treasurer of its European section.<br>
<br>Burrows was a fairly tall man, who sported a moustache but was otherwise closely shaven. He usually dressed in a flannel shirt and a tweed suit. Most reports record him being gentle and sympathetic with a naturally graceful manner but a noticeably pessimistic streak. He was a teetotaller, non-smoker, vegetarian, and committed pacifist&#151;a member of the committee of the International Arbitration and Peace Association and the International Arbitration League. He enjoyed travelling, and visited, among other places, France in 1879, America in 1893, south-eastern Europe in 1899, and Bosnia in 1901. Usually he was accompanied by William Clarke, radical journalist and Fabian socialist, a friend from his Cambridge days. Widowed in 1889, he married an American woman whose health was poor, and who died in April 1899. His son and daughter survived him.<br>
<br>The federation was committed to electoral participation. In 1908, and again in 1910, Burrows contested the parliamentary seat of Haggerston, Shoreditch, but he was unsuccessful, polling respectively 986 and 701 votes, behind both the Conservative and Liberal candidates. In 1911 he resigned from the federation (by then the Social Democratic Party) in protest at its adopting resolutions supporting the maintenance of a navy and citizens' army. Besides, his experiences as a parliamentary candidate had convinced him the federation was becoming politically irrelevant because it refused to affiliate to the Labour Party. He intended to spend his last years writing a history of the federation but could not do so because he was stricken with paralysis in April 1917. He died at his home, 90 Sotheby Road, Highbury Park, London, on 14 December 1922.<br>
