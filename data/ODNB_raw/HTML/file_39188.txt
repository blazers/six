<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Allinson,  Thomas Richard</span>  (1858&#150;1918), <span class="occ">dietitian and businessman</span>, was born at 43 Rumford Street, Hulme, Lancashire, on 29 March 1858, the son of Thomas Allinson, a bookkeeper, and his wife, Ellen (formerly Sims). He left school at fifteen and, aiming to be a doctor, he subsidized his studies by becoming a chemist's assistant. In 1879 he graduated LRCP (Edinburgh) and LRCS (Edinburgh). Over the next six years Allinson gained an unusually broad medical experience, in hospitals and country practice, in the poor-law system, in club practice and the police service, and on board ship. In 1885 he set up his own practice in Spanish Place, near Manchester Square in London's West End; the practice was linked with a private hospital that treated patients according to Allinson's ideas. That year he also began writing a column for the <span class="italic">Weekly Times and Echo</span>; some of his articles were reprinted in his <span class="italic">Medical Essays</span> (2 vols., 1887) and revised in five volumes between 1889 and 1893.<br>
<br>In 1886 Allinson published <span class="italic">A System of Hygienic Medicine</span>. His philosophy sprang from the notion that the body contained a vital force which, if nourished by fresh air, exercise, and appropriate diet, would yield its owner good health. Allinson believed that meat, tea, coffee, tobacco, and alcohol on the other hand weakened the life force. As bread formed an important part of ordinary people's subsistence fare, he insisted that white bread, with its noxious additives, should be avoided, in favour of the wholemeal kind, containing the bran fibre. His <span class="italic">Advantages of Wholemeal Bread</span> appeared in 1893. To produce and market wholewheat flour of the desired purity, Allinson established the Natural Food Company, later incorporated under his chairmanship. Allinson bread products continue to be sold today.<br>
<br>Allinson was a fierce critic of certain current medical practices. In a pamphlet of 1888, <span class="italic">How to Avoid Vaccination</span>, he condemned this &#145;nasty rite&#146; (by then compulsory) and explained ways of circumventing the law. The medical authorities in Edinburgh at once compelled him to remove his name from the pamphlet, which none the less continued to circulate anonymously. Allinson also opposed surgical operations, and the wholesale prescribing of drugs, which he considered dealt merely with local areas of illness instead of paying regard to the body's entire system. In thirteen books, in his weekly column, and in more than 1000 pamphlets, as well as in lectures throughout the country, Allinson advocated some sensible ideas about hygiene, but incurred the hostility of the medical establishment.<br>
<br>After disregarding a caution by the Edinburgh authorities, in 1892 Allinson was charged by the General Medical Council in London with infamous conduct, namely advertising both his services as a doctor and his commercial products. He took his case to the Court of Appeal, but lost. In 1895 he was fined &pound;20 for continuing to style himself LRCP. Five years later he was censured at the inquest on a small child who had died of malnutrition after being fed Dr Allinson's Food for Babies and Invalids, which was shown to consist mainly of pearl barley. In 1910 Allinson was convicted for sending indecent material through the post, though he won the case on appeal. This was probably a birth-control pamphlet, which argued that it was individually and socially wrong for too many children to be born. As early as 1891 he had fallen out over this issue with editors of <span class="italic">The Vegetarian</span>.<br>
<br>During the First World War, Allinson had the satisfaction of seeing the introduction of &#145;war bread&#146; with a low rate of extraction that benefited health. Despite his love of a good scrap, he presented a sympathetic bedside manner towards the thousands who passed through what he claimed to be the largest medical practice in England. With a lofty brow and twinkly bespectacled eyes above a full beard, he dressed well in black jacket, striped trousers, and fancy waistcoat adorned with a thick, gold fob-chain. His only known pastime was stamp collecting.<br>
<br>In the final two years of his life Allinson suffered from chronic bronchitis, and he died of tuberculosis at his home at 4 Spanish Place, on 29 November 1918; he was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex, on 2 December. He left a wife, Anna, with whom he had three sons and a daughter, and his estate was valued at &pound;26,048. One son, Dr Bertrand Allinson, a dietetic guru in London, remained in good standing with his medical colleagues; another son, Adrian Paul Allinson (1890&#150;1959), designed posters for the Southern Railway.<br>
