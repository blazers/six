<span class="headword">Spottiswood <span class="st"> [Spottiswoode]</span>, Sir  Robert</span>, Lord Dunipace  (1596&#150;1646), <span class="occ">judge and politician</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26167/', "John Spottiswoode (1565&#150;1639)")</script>, archbishop of St Andrews, and Rachel, daughter of David Lindsay, bishop of Ross. He was educated at grammar school in Glasgow and at the University of Glasgow (1609&#150;13), where he graduated as master of arts. He then moved to Exeter College, Oxford, becoming a fellow, before embarking on nine years of travel and study in France, Italy, and Germany. During this period he greatly helped his father's work on the history of the church in Scotland by recovering many documents carried abroad by Roman Catholic refugees after the Scottish Reformation. It was presumably on his return to Scotland that he married Bethia (<i>d</i>. 1639), daughter of Sir Alexander Morison of Prestongrange.<br>
<br>Spottiswood's abilities, and his father's position, brought him quick advancement. He was admitted to the privy council of Scotland on 11 July 1622, and was appointed the next day to be an extraordinary lord of the court of session, in place of his father. He took the judicial title Lord New Abbey from lands bought for him by his father, and was knighted in 1624. On 14 February 1626 he was made an ordinary lord of session, and in 1634 changed his title to Lord Dunipace when the New Abbey lands were restored to the crown as a patrimony for the new bishopric of Edinburgh. In October 1633 he was elected president of the court of session, having been nominated by Charles I. After 1625 he never took his seat on the privy council, preferring to concentrate on his judicial duties, and he was omitted from the new council appointed in 1631.<br>
<br>When open resistance to the king began in Scotland in 1637 Spottiswood became a hated figure, as much because he was the son of an archbishop as because of his political views. Late in that year he travelled to court in England, and it was rumoured that he had gone to inform the king of the incompetence of his officials, being regarded as &#145;almost a professed enemie&#146; to the noble councillors and &#145;an agent for the bishops&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie</span>, 1.47). He was back in Scotland by 28 February 1638, when he took his seat on the session, and he continued to sit in court until 22 March 1639, by which time the country was on the verge of civil war between the king's supporters and the covenanters. He withdrew eventually to England, but returned to Scotland with Charles I in 1641. Denounced by the Scottish parliament as an &#145;incendiary&#146; responsible for sowing discord between king and people, he was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle by parliament on 17 August, but was released on 16 November. The threat to bring him to trial at a later date was abandoned, and, omitted from the new commission to the court of session in October, he returned to England with the king.<br>
<br>In January 1644 Spottiswood was appointed secretary of state for Scotland by Charles at Oxford, his civil war headquarters, but the Scottish parliament, which had just allied itself with its English counterpart against the king, refused to recognize the appointment, denouncing him as a usurper on 22 July. Spottiswood had formed a close friendship with the marquess of Montrose and in May 1645, having sealed the king's commission to the marquess to be the king's lieutenant-governor and captain-general of Scotland, he set out to deliver the document to Montrose himself. His role was no doubt intended to be much more than that of a messenger. Montrose had raised hopes that his army would soon win control of Scotland from the covenanters, and if that happened moves would need to be made to establish a royalist regime under the powers granted in the new commission. Spottiswood's presence as secretary of state would lend credibility to this transition from conquest to administration. Travelling by way of Wales and the Isle of Man, Spottiswood landed in Lochaber, finally joining Montrose's army at the beginning of September. The timing seemed perfect, for Montrose's victory at Kilsyth a few weeks earlier had left no army in Scotland to oppose him, and he was indeed preparing to establish a regime. But the failure of lowland royalists to rally to Montrose, desertions from his army, and the news of the approach of the cavalry of the Scottish army in England made the situation perilous. As Spottiswood wrote on 10 September, &#145;All these were great Disheartenings to any other but to him [Montrose], whom nothing of this kind can amate [deject]&#146;  (Spottiswoode, xxxvi). When Montrose's forces were crushed at Philiphaugh on 13 September, Spottiswood fled, but was captured, and the fact that he had drawn his sword was used as evidence that he had been &#145;in arms&#146;.<br>
<br>Spottiswood was at first imprisoned in Glasgow, where a list of charges against him was delivered to him on 5 November. The main accusations were having accepted office as secretary without parliamentary consent and having served in arms against the state. His defences that he owed natural allegiance to his king, that he had not been in arms, and that he had been promised quarter were rejected in a debate in parliament at St Andrews, and he was found guilty of high treason. He was sentenced to death on 16 January 1646, orders being issued for bringing &#145;the maiden&#146;&#151;the Scottish beheading machine&#151;to St Andrews. On 19 January, the day before his death, Spottiswood wrote to Montrose reaffirming his loyalty, and on the day itself he wrote to his children: all he had to bequeath to them was &#145;the example of my loyalty, which as yow looke for a blessing from heaven or will have mine to light on you I command you to imitate&#146;  (NL Scot., MS 2933, 24<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>On 20 January 1646, on the scaffold, Spottiswood's attempt to make a speech was interrupted by covenanting ministers, who &#145;tormented him in the last moments of his life with their officious exhortations and rhapsodies&#146;  (Maidment, 1.223). Another account speaks of one of the ministers, Robert Blair, being white with fury and breaking &#145;out into scurrilous abuse&#146; of Spottiswood and his archbishop father, which he bore in &#145;serene silence&#146;  (Wishart, 171). Blair on the other hand records Spottiswood's &#145;railing discourse&#146;, and his own comment that it was no surprise to find the son of a &#145;false prophet&#146; slandering faithful servants of Christ. Spottiswood, says Blair, &#145;died railing and raging&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life of Mr Robert Blair</span>, 180). Finally, there is the story that he &#145;died as he lived, full of malice against the cause and the Covenant&#146;, affirming his support for Montrose, &#145;that matchless mirrour of all true worth and nobility&#146;  (Maidment, 1.203&#150;4, 208). On balance, it seems he died with spirit rather than serenity.<br>
<br>Laying aside unsubstantiated charges of corruption as a judge hurled at him by his enemies, Spottiswood seems to have been a scholarly, diligent, and well-liked man. That his father was an archbishop advanced both his career and his death, for in the covenanters' determination to obtain revenge on their enemies Spottiswood was almost a symbolic victim. In hailing him as a &#145;great man&#146; George Wishart treated him as a symbol of loyalty and martyrdom, but whether he was also &#145;remarkable for his knowledge of things both human and divine&#146;, outstanding as a linguist, and &#145;deeply versed in history, law and politics&#146;  (Wishart, 171) it is impossible to decide through lack of evidence.<br>
