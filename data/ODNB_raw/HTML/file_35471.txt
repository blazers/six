<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Percival,  John</span>  (1834&#150;1918), <span class="occ">headmaster and bishop of Hereford</span>, was born at Brough Sowerby, Westmorland, on 27 September 1834, the eldest son of William Percival, a &#145;statesman&#146; (that is, a farmer who owned his own land), and his wife, Jane (<i>d</i>. 1838), daughter of William Longmire (also a farmer) of Bolton, Westmorland. His boyhood was tough. Following the death of his mother he was brought up by her relatives, helping his uncle on the farm. He attended village schools at Winton and Hackthorpe before going to Appleby grammar school (1846&#150;54), trudging to and from school in his studded clogs with a blue linen bag over his shoulder. To the end of his life he retained his broad Westmorland accent.<br>
<br>In 1854 Percival won an open scholarship to Queen's College, Oxford, where his intellectual qualities were quickly recognized. He gained the university junior mathematical scholarship and took firsts in classics and mathematics before being elected a fellow of Queen's in 1858. Long periods of intense study led to a breakdown in his health, and he spent the winter of 1858&#150;9 recuperating at Pau in the south of France. There he met Louisa, daughter of James Holland. They married in 1862 and subsequently had a family of six children. In 1860 he was ordained deacon and accepted Frederick Temple's offer of a mastership at Rugby School. This began a lifelong friendship with the Temple family, especially with William Temple, Percival's godson and later his biographer.<br>
<br>On Frederick Temple's recommendation Percival was appointed in 1862 as the first headmaster of the newly founded Clifton College, Bristol. A born leader and pioneer he made Clifton into one of the leading public schools, largely because of his shrewd choice of masters. His sermons at Clifton, <span class="italic">Some Helps for School Life</span>, were published in 1880. Bristol gave him the opportunity to engage in other educational developments. He promoted a ragged school in the city, gave active support to the ideals and implementation of the <span class="roman">Elementary Education Act</span> of 1870, and with his wife was one of the organizers in 1868 of a committee to promote the higher education of women. In 1877 he helped to found Clifton High School for Girls and subsequently became president of the girls' high school at Redland. In his influential pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Connection of the Universities and the Great Towns</span> (1873), he urged Oxford and Cambridge to provide university teaching in provincial towns and cities, and with Gilbert Elliot, dean of Bristol, he was a leader in the movement to establish University College, Bristol, which opened in 1877.<br>
<br>In January 1879 Percival left Clifton College to become president of Trinity College, Oxford, where he remained until 1886. His time at Trinity was not the happiest of his life, largely because his manner and temperament suited that of a headmaster of a school more than head of a college. However, his work outside the college gave him the greatest satisfaction and opportunity. He was chairman of the committee which in 1879 founded Somerville Hall, Oxford, the non-denominational college for women, and he was instrumental in recruiting Madeleine Shaw Lefevre as its first principal. He was also a vigorous promoter of the university adult education movement and played an influential part in Michael Sadler's appointment as secretary of the Oxford Extension Delegacy. From 1882 to 1887 he was a canon of Bristol Cathedral, residing there in university vacations, where he started Sunday evening services.<br>
<br>In May 1887 Percival became headmaster of Rugby School. There was a feeling that the school had slackened under his cultivated predecessor, Jex-Blake, and he set about a moral crusade with a relentless and puritanical fervour. He terrified new boys by his dour warning, &#145;There are many bad boys here, there is a lot of evil in the place. Eh, I shall be watching you every day of your lives&#146;  (Temple, 113). He attacked &#145;idleness&#146; and &#145;loafing&#146;, while signifying his anxiety about &#145;impurity&#146; by his insistence that boys' football shorts should be worn below the knee and secured by elastic (hence his nickname, &#145;Percival of the Knees&#146;). Within a short time the prestige of the school rose under his stern moral, spiritual, and intellectual leadership.<br>
<br>In January 1895 Lord Rosebery, the Liberal prime minister, nominated Percival to the bishopric of Hereford. The queen attempted to resist the recommendation on the ground that Percival, a strong Liberal in politics, was a known supporter of disestablishment of the Welsh church (having written to <span class="italic">The Times</span> on the subject in May 1894). Rosebery prevailed, insisting that he could not appoint a supporter of the establishment to a diocese which included thirteen Welsh parishes. The Hereford years were lonely ones for Percival, who lost his wife in 1896. He missed the fellowship of school and university life, though his marriage in 1899 to an old family friend, Mary Georgina, daughter of Frederick Symonds, brought him solace and affection. He found the large sprawling rural diocese difficult to administer; nor was it easy to create a sense of fellowship within it. He appointed distinguished scholars to the cathedral canonries, but they were largely out of touch with the parishes. In an agricultural and predominantly Conservative region Percival's radical views on social and political issues did not always go down well; he chaired the 1897 Lambeth conference's committee on industrial problems, supported the Liberal government's 1906 <span class="roman">Education Bill</span>, and attacked slum landlords in 1909. He was a broad-churchman, suspicious of ritualists. His invitation to nonconformists to join holy communion at Hereford Cathedral to mark the coronation of George V attracted strong protests from Lord Halifax and the English Church Union.<br>
<br>His successor, Hensley Henson, commented that Percival's &#145;interest and his influence were national rather than diocesan, educational rather than ecclesiastical&#146;  (H. H. Henson, <span class="italic">Retrospect of an Unimportant Life</span>, 1, 1942, 273). The early years of the twentieth century saw Percival once more involved in movements concerned with educational development and reform. He chaired the founding meeting of the Workers' Educational Association at Oxford in 1903 and gave its founder, Albert Mansbridge, unstinting help in its early years. He saw the development of working-class adult education as one of the great pioneering achievements of the time. In 1907 he spoke in the House of Lords in favour of Bishop Gore's motion for reforming the ancient universities, voicing the demand that Oxford should play a full part in the working-class educational movements then developing. His vision of education was to develop the faculties of all children as a matter of Christian love and social justice, believing that it was through education that men and women of all classes could rise and reach their fulfilment. This vision Percival shared with Albert Mansbridge, William Temple, R. H. Tawney (the two latter having been pupils under him at Rugby), and others who pioneered the course of national and adult education in the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Percival announced his retirement from Hereford in 1917. He retired to Oxford, where he died at his home, 64 Banbury Road, on 3 December 1918. He was buried in the crypt of the chapel of Clifton College, Bristol. Memorial services were held in Hereford Cathedral, at Trinity College, Oxford, and in St James's, Piccadilly, where William Temple, the rector, spoke of him as &#145;one of the pre-eminent figures of the nineteenth century, a century rich in educators&#146;.<br>
