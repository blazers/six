<span class="headword">Davies,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1511&#150;1573), <span class="occ">bishop of St Asaph</span>, was born possibly at Llanbedr-y-cennin, Caernarvonshire, the son of Dafydd ap Robert, a gentleman of substantial means of Caerhun in Arllechwedd Isaf and descendant of Sir Gruffudd Llwyd of Dinorwig and Tregarnedd, and Margaret, daughter of Rhys ap Wiliam, a descendant of Iarddur. He came from a family that served prominently in local administration, and was educated at Oxford, where he was influenced by religious reforms and obtained sinecure benefices in the dioceses of Bangor and St Asaph. He graduated LLD from St John's College, Cambridge, in 1548.<br>
<br>Davies was appointed chancellor of Bangor Cathedral (1546), archdeacon of St Asaph (probably in 1558&#150;61), and, on Bishop William Glyn's death in 1558, was granted by Cardinal Pole the custodianship of the spiritualities of Bangor diocese until 21 December 1559 when Rowland Meyrick was elected to the see. He accepted Mary I's changes and kept his preferments on her death. On Richard Davies's removal from St Asaph to St David's in 1561 he was elected bishop of that see. He was confirmed on 23 May, consecrated at Croydon on 26 May, and the temporalities were restored on 2 April 1562. Davies made sixteen presentations to livings, most of them of resident, hospitable, and scholarly Welsh clergy, such as Thomas Powell, rector of Llanfechain (1562) and the historian and antiquary David Powel, vicar of Rhiwabon (1576).<br>
<br>Thomas Davies proceeded to establish a learned ministry in his diocese and emphasized the need to educate children in the protestant faith. In 1561 he issued diocesan council orders which stipulated that the catechism, the epistles, and the gospel were to be read in English and then in Welsh every Sunday to educate parishioners and children. The litany was to be sung or said on Wednesdays and Fridays and all &#145;feyned relyques and other superstycyons&#146; were to be discarded. Also, after the ordination of priests and deacons on 31 October 1568, it was ordered that they were not to minister outside the diocese without the bishop's licence and were to use the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> in Latin and English and Erasmus's paraphrase of them. They were also required to learn chapter 1 of St Paul's epistle to the <span class="roman">Romans</span> and chapter 6 of the gospel of <span class="roman">St John</span>, to recite them in the bishop's presence, and to say morning and evening prayers daily.<br>
<br>In 1563 Davies informed the privy council of the poor condition of his diocese owing to an ill-endowed clergy, non-residence, and pluralism, but proceeded to improve clerical standards and appoint schoolmasters. In 1570 he informed William Cecil that he had succeeded in reorganizing the diocese but requested that an ecclesiastical commission be appointed to review it. He held several sinecures but kept the rectories of Llanbedr-y-cennin and Trefriw, the comportionary rectory of Llandinam, and the living of Caerhun. He also retained the archdeaconry of St Asaph and the chancellorship of Bangor. These preferments were necessary in order that he might maintain a standard of living worthy of a bishop and be able to offer hospitality. Although William Salesbury lived in the diocese Davies seems not to have befriended him nor to have taken any part in his translation of the scriptures. However, with Bishop Richard Davies of St David's and Humphrey Llwyd, MP for Denbigh borough, he formed a Welsh lobby in parliament and was present in the House of Lords for the first two of three readings of the bill for a Welsh <span class="roman">Bible</span> in 1563. He supported the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> in convocation (1563) and the disciplinary canons (1571).<br>
<br>Thomas Davies was an administrator rather than a theologian and contributed significantly to the organization of his see under the new protestant order. In 1565 he sat on a commission for the suppression of piracy on the Flintshire coast, and on the Lords' committee dealing with the bill for keeping records in the shires of Wales (1563). He was bequeathed books in the will of Arthur Bulkeley, bishop of Bangor, and in turn left books and &pound;10 in his will (19 April 1570) to Friars School, Bangor, and to Queens' College, Cambridge. He bequeathed his interest in a mill and lands at Abergele to that college towards maintaining a scholarship which, however, was not administered. His estate was divided between his wife and executor, Margaret (of whom no other details are known), and his daughter Katherine, wife of William Holland of Abergele. He was a supporter of the classical bards, and laudatory odes were composed for him by Robert ap Dafydd Llwyd, Si&ocirc;n Tudur, and Wiliam Cynwal. So highly regarded was hospitality at his palace that Si&ocirc;n Tudur and Si&ocirc;n Phylip disputed in verse their respective claims to enjoy his bountiful patronage. Davies died a rich man at Abergele, Denbighshire, on 16 October 1573, after completing his will, and was probably buried there.<br>
