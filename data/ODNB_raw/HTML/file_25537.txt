<span class="headword">Sigfrid</span>  (<em>d.</em> 689), <span class="occ">co-abbot of St Peter's, Wearmouth</span>, was a monk and deacon of that house and was elected abbot during the absence of Benedict Biscop on his fifth journey to Rome. Bede gives a contemporary account of Sigfrid in his <span class="italic">Historia abbatum</span> of Wearmouth and Jarrow. On his departure Benedict had left the monastery under the charge of Eosterwine, who, together with a large number of the brethren, died of the plague about 686. Those who were left, on the advice of Ceolfrith, abbot of the daughter monastery at Jarrow, elected Sigfrid in his place. Sigfrid was well versed in the scriptures, but he suffered from an incurable disease of the lungs. On his return Benedict was pleased at his election and confirmed it, assigning to him the active charge of the monastery, and devoting himself to teaching and prayer. Before long Sigfrid's health became much worse, and, Benedict also falling sick, the two lay helpless in their separate cells until one day both desired to be brought together, and Sigfrid was carried into Benedict's cell, where the brethren supported the two abbots so as to enable them to give each other a farewell kiss, and Benedict, with the consent of all, appointed Ceolfrith abbot of Wearmouth as well as of Jarrow. The anonymous historian of Wearmouth and Jarrow, who closely followed Bede's account, states that Sigfrid died on 22 August 689. After the death of Benedict, apparently on 12 January following, the bodies of Sigfrid and Eosterwine were laid with his body in the church of Wearmouth.<br>
