<span class="headword">Mahomed, Frederick Henry Horatio Akbar</span>  (1849&#150;1884), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born at 2 Black Lion Street, Brighton, on 11 April 1849, the son of Frederick Mahomed (1818&#150;1888), the keeper of a turkish bath, professor of gymnastics, and fencing master, and his wife, Sarah (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Hodgkinson). He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53351/', "Sake Deen Mahomed (1759&#150;1851)")</script>. He began medical studies at an early age at the Sussex County Hospital, and from there went to Guy's Hospital, London, where he won several prizes. He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1872, and soon after became resident medical officer at the London Fever Hospital. He married Ellen Chalk (<i>b</i>. 1847/8), daughter of Charles Chalk, solicitor, in Brighton on 14 June 1873. In 1875 he gained the degree of MD at Brussels and was elected medical tutor at St Mary's Hospital, before returning to Guy's as medical registrar in 1877. Realizing that further progress in the medical profession would not be achieved without a degree from an English university, he matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1877 and travelled to Cambridge every evening by the last train in order to perform the pernoctation essential for keeping a term, returning to London by an early morning train. In 1881 he graduated MB at Cambridge, taking no other degree, and in the same year he was elected assistant physician to Guy's Hospital. In 1880 he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.<br>
<br>Employed by the British Association, Mahomed became involved in organizing a system for the registration of diseases, and worked laboriously at this collective investigation. He made many contributions to the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Pathological Society</span> (vols. 26, 28, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38), the most important being the sphygmographic evidence of arterio-capillary fibrosis; and he wrote a long series of papers on the results of the use of the sphygmograph in the investigation of disease in the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span>. To the <span class="italic">Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society</span> he contributed a valuable paper on the early stages of scarlatinal nephritis (vol. 57, 1874), and also published many observations in the <span class="italic">Guy's Hospital Reports</span>.<br>
<br>Mahomed was a tall, muscular man, of dark complexion, and possessed an enormous enthusiasm for his work, which sometimes led him to act impulsively. He died of typhoid on 22 November 1884 at his house, 24 Manchester Square, London.<br>
