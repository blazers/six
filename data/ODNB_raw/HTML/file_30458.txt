<span class="headword">Arnold,  William Thomas</span>  (1852&#150;1904), <span class="occ">journalist and author</span>, was born at Hobart, Tasmania, on 18 September 1852, the eldest son and second child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/687/', "Thomas Arnold (1823&#150;1900)")</script>, sometime administrator, schoolmaster, and university professor, and Julia Sorell (1826&#150;1888). &#145;Willie&#146; was a gentle, sensitive, academically gifted child. He was born into one of England's most distinguished, middle-class, Liberal families. His grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/686/', "Thomas Arnold")</script>, was the famed headmaster of Rugby School; an uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/679/', "Matthew Arnold")</script>, was the poet; and another uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9926/', "W. E. Forster")</script>, a minister in two of Gladstone's cabinets. His elder sister, Mary, later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36736/', "Mrs Humphry Ward")</script>, became a best-selling, highly respected novelist and his younger sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58174/', "Ethel Margaret Arnold")</script> became a journalist and lecturer on female suffrage. Yet all his life he was happiest when not having to be an Arnold, with all the relentless striving and ambition that implied. His early years and education were in some part influenced and shaped by his mother's mental instability and, more fundamentally, by his father's sudden conversions from and to Roman Catholicism. Arnold was baptized an Anglican at birth, was rebaptized as a Roman Catholic at five, only to be confirmed in the Church of England at twelve. From 1862 to 1865 he was a pupil at the Oratory School, Birmingham; from 1865 to 1871, he attended Rugby School. Apparently unruffled by this eclectic religious denominationalism, and the sudden changes in domestic arrangements forced upon the family by his father's quixotic behaviour, Arnold earned golden opinions at school, and proceeded to University College, Oxford, as a scholar. There, in 1876, to everyone's surprise but his own, he graduated, not with a first but a good second-class honours degree. Nevertheless, he revealed his true scholarly potential subsequently with an outstanding study of Roman provincial administration, which won the Arnold prize in 1879.<br>
<br>In 1873 Arnold had fallen in love with Henrietta Wale, daughter of Charles Wale JP, of Little Shelford, near Cambridge. His family were opposed to the match, but they were married on 26 June 1877, at Lee, Kent. Arnold loved his wife dearly, but Henrietta was always highly-strung and nervous; they had no children. In 1879, on the advice of Humphry Ward, C. P. Scott recruited Arnold for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. Arnold liked Manchester and enjoyed the companionship afforded by his newspaper colleagues. He worked six afternoons and evenings a week at the <span class="italic">Guardian</span> office, writing leaders, reviews, and theatre notices. His leisure hours he devoted to research in Roman history, English literature, particularly the poetry of Keats, publishing a scholarly edition of the poet's works in 1884, and to long country walks with his wife and their dogs.<br>
<br>To journalism Arnold brought real academic distinction and pronounced Liberal sympathies. His searching, powerful intellect coupled with impressive imaginative powers made him an accomplished and persuasive writer. Almost immediately it was his writing on Ireland that set the tone and made possible the future &#145;leap of faith&#146; by the <span class="italic">Guardian</span> when, in the mid 1880s, whiggism was abandoned for Liberal radicalism. Between 1879 and 1896 it was Arnold, not Scott, who was the true architect of the <span class="italic">Guardian</span>'s style, and his the personality more strongly expressed both in the leader and the critical columns. To the acute vexation of his family, but to his own deep and entire satisfaction, few people were aware of Arnold's crucial contribution. It has been said that he gave himself to the <span class="italic">Guardian</span> &#145;as a Jesuit to the order&#146;. He would quote: &#145;There is no limit to what a man can do when he does not care who gains the credit for it&#146;  (Nichols, 113&#150;14). He refused a number of tempting offers to become a member of parliament and a don; he was content with his life as a journalist.<br>
<br>For someone who was such a talented political writer Arnold attached no overwhelming importance to politics, insisting it was criticism that gave to any newspaper its true cachet. He wrote particularly well on the theatre and painting; he always encouraged local artists and played an active part in establishing the Manchester School of Art. It was Arnold's interest in individuality and his respect for intellectual authority that shaped his political journalism. This was most directly relevant concerning Ireland. He was responsible for the <span class="italic">Guardian</span>'s Irish policy, committing it to the support of home rule in a debate that for so long excited extremes of public opinion. Sympathetic to the unionization of unskilled labour, he presented and defended the claims of the dockers in their 1889 strike. Much as he admired German culture and scholarship, towards the end of his life he became increasingly concerned about Prussian chauvinism. A series of articles originally written for the <span class="italic">Spectator</span> was republished as <span class="italic">German Ambitions as they Affect Britain and the United States</span> (1903).<br>
<br>From 1896 Arnold was increasingly incapacitated by what at first he supposed was rheumatism. His physical and nervous deterioration proved altogether too much for his wife, who collapsed under the strain and thereafter was hopelessly disabled by hysterics. Arnold's elder sister, Mary, nursed him and took charge of his affairs during the last dreadful years. His suffering, caused by locomotor ataxia (syphilitic in origin), was agonizing, and the partial relief afforded by morphia ended in inevitable addiction. A cerebral thrombosis eventually brought merciful release on 29 May 1904; he was buried at Little Shelford. Arnold was undoubtedly one of the greatest journalists of his day. Although his active working life was short, only seventeen years, his influence upon the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span> was as immeasurably great as it was long-lasting.<br>
