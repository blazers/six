<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Percy <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Smithson]</span>,  Hugh</span>, first duke of Northumberland  (<em>bap. </em>1712, <em>d.</em> 1786), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the only son of Langdale Smithson (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1682) and Philadelphia Reveley (<i>bap</i>. 1688, <i>d</i>. 1764), the daughter of William Reveley. He was baptized on 10 December 1712 at Kirby Wiske, near Northallerton, Yorkshire, and very close to Newby Wiske, which was the home of his mother, whose family had moved there from Northumberland. The Smithsons had made their money as haberdashers in Cheapside; they purchased Stanwick, near Catterick, in 1638, supported the king in the civil war, and obtained a baronetcy from Charles II in 1663. Brought up as a Catholic, Smithson conformed at the time of his father's death in the 1720s.<br>
<br>Smithson's genealogical luck was phenomenal. His father died early and he inherited the baronetcy from his grandfather Sir Hugh Smithson, third baronet, in 1729, at the age of seventeen. He was admitted to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1730. In 1734 his sister Dorothy died, leaving him &pound;10,000. By 1738 he was sheriff of Yorkshire. In 1740, a cousin, Michael Godfrey Smithson, having died, he inherited estates in Middlesex and at Armin, near Goole, from Hugh Smithson MP, his grandfather's first cousin. In the same year he was elected MP for Middlesex (which Hugh Smithson had represented), defeating Henry Barker, a whig, with little difficulty. Meanwhile, in 1739 at Swillington, he had become acquainted with Elizabeth Seymour (1716&#150;1776) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59609/', "Percy, Elizabeth")</script>], the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25156/', "Algernon Seymour, seventh duke of Somerset (1684&#150;1750)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25158/', "Seymour, Charles, sixth duke of Somerset")</script>], and his wife, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53787/', "Frances Seymour, n&#233;e Thynne (1699&#150;1754)")</script>. Her grandmother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21925/', "Elizabeth Seymour (1667&#150;1722)")</script>, had been heir to all the Percy estates in Middlesex and Northumberland, being the only surviving child of Josceline Percy, eleventh earl of Northumberland, who died in 1670. Smithson's estate at this time was said to be worth &pound;4000 per annum, with &pound;3000 per annum more to come by inheritance. Despite opposition from Elizabeth's grandfather, Charles Seymour, sixth duke of Somerset (&#145;the proud duke&#146;), their marriage took place on 16 July 1740. They had two sons and one daughter. In 1744 Elizabeth's brother George Seymour died of smallpox on the grand tour, leaving her sole heir.<br>
<br>Smithson's political career began in opposition to Walpole, and he voted with the tories against the employment of Hanoverian troops in 1742 and 1744. The Jacobite rising of 1745, during which he displayed zeal for the Hanoverian succession, gave him the chance to transfer to the Pelhamite whigs. He spoke on the government side in April 1747 on the bill to abolish hereditable jursidictions in Scotland and at the general election of 1747 was once more returned for Middlesex, this time as a government candidate.<br>
<br>Smithson's first objective was to safeguard his wife's inheritance. In 1744 the duke of Somerset asked George II for the earldom of Northumberland, with a special remainder to his grandson Sir Charles Wyndham, thus cutting out his granddaughter. At an audience with the king, Smithson protested successfully on behalf of his father-in-law, Lord Hertford. On Somerset's death in 1748, the seventh duke of Somerset persuaded the king to grant him the earldom of Northumberland, with a special remainder to Smithson and his heirs by Lady Elizabeth. The Wyndhams were bought off with the earldom of Egremont. Smithson succeeded to the title in February 1750 and assumed the name Percy by act of parliament. &#145;Earl Smithson&#146; was a predictable sneer, yet honours now crowded upon him. He took his seat in the Lords on 1 March 1750 and in January 1751 moved the address to the throne. In January 1753 he was appointed a lord of the bedchamber, in March 1753 he was made lord lieutenant of Northumberland, and in 1756 he was given the Garter. He steered clear of party commitments. During the struggle between Fox, Pitt, and Newcastle in June 1757 he was reported to have said: &#145;Let who will resign; he would not, but would support whatever minister the king appointed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Eighth Report</span>, HMC, 1.225a).<br>
<br>Northumberland's next task was to build up his political base. The estates of the family, which had been neglected by the sixth duke of Somerset, were taken in hand, and an income of some &pound;8000 per annum was raised to &pound;50,000 per annum, largely by exploiting coal measures. He also bought up advowsons and by the end of his life held more than a dozen. His electoral interest, which was little more than one seat for Northumberland in 1750, was increased to seven seats, mainly by the purchase in the 1770s of three boroughs in Cornwall and Devon with two seats apiece. He overreached himself at the general election of 1774 when an attempt to carry both seats in Northumberland failed, but by the 1780s he commanded one of the largest parliamentary groups.<br>
<br>Northumberland's progress continued in the next reign. George III at once appointed him a lord of the bedchamber in November 1760. He became lord chamberlain to Queen Charlotte in May 1762, was sworn of the privy council in November, and succeeded Newcastle as lord lieutenant of Middlesex in December 1762. He was on close terms with the king's minister Lord Bute, and his son married Bute's daughter in 1764. In the reorganization that followed Bute's decision to retire in 1763, Northumberland came up as a possible replacement: John Calcraft wrote to Shelburne in March 1763 that, &#145;with our hold on Lord Northumberland, is it possible to think of placing him as a great lord &hellip; at the head of the Treasury, either for some short time, or till you could take it?&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 1.195&#150;6). Fox's proposal was to make him lord privy seal, but in the end George Grenville became first minister and Northumberland went to Ireland as lord lieutenant, arriving on 21 September 1763.<br>
<br>Northumberland remained in that post from April 1763 until May 1765. His wealth enabled him to entertain lavishly, much to his wife's liking; Horace Walpole called her &#145;junketaceous&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 38.59). Halifax, the secretary of state, however, was not an easy man to work with, and Northumberland complained of his incivility. The political situation at Dublin was difficult, with Edmund Pery and the patriots pressing for constitutional concessions&#151;habeas corpus, a septennial act, and restrictions on the Irish pensions list. Ministers at Westminster were irritated at the Irish address on the peace treaty, which was pointedly unenthusiastic. On 10 November, Northumberland wrote urgently for instructions whether he should punish unreliable placemen or &#145;temporize&#146;: Halifax, in reply, though exasperated, recommended mildness and offered some pension concessions. The award of a grand title, vice-admiral of all America, in December 1764 was a sop&#151;&#145;a mere feather&#146; in Walpole's phrase  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 38.492, 497).<br>
<br>As early as January 1765 Northumberland was indicating reluctance to continue, pleading ill health. Grenville's suspicions of his Bute connections were reinforced in April 1765 when the king asked him to sound out a change of government, bringing in Pitt and the Rockinghams. Northumberland approached Cumberland, who was to act as broker, at a meeting in the stables at Newmarket. The proposal that Northumberland might act as first lord of the Treasury was raised, but Lord Temple, Pitt's brother-in-law, angrily refused to serve under &#145;Bute's Lieutenant&#146;. The negotiations broke down, Grenville stayed in office, and Northumberland was replaced as lord lieutenant by Lord Weymouth.<br>
<br>When Rockingham replaced Grenville in July 1765, the king hoped that a place would be found for Northumberland. At one stage he was considered for the French embassy. But though he remained on friendly terms and voted for the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>, the Bute connection held him back. In May 1766, when the king had tired of the Rockinghams, Northumberland was again involved in negotiations to change the ministry. This time he did not emerge empty handed. Pitt agreed to take office. When the lord chamberlainship and the mastership of the horse, which he had wanted, went elsewhere, Northumberland complained that he had received no mark of favour for his Irish exertions. Pitt suggested a step up in the peerage to a marquessate, but Northumberland held out for a dukedom, which the king, plainly disconcerted, granted with some reluctance rather than offend Pitt at the outset.<br>
<br>Although Northumberland had assured the king that he would not again solicit office, his political aspirations were by no means extinguished. In May 1767, with Chatham mysteriously ill, Walpole reported that opposition hoped Northumberland would be called upon to preside over a ministry of Lord Bute's friends [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/92864', "King's friends")</script>]. A year later, Burke told Rockingham that the Bedfords named the duke &#145;for a proper person for the Treasury&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Correspondence of Edmund Burke</span>, ed. T. W. Copeland and others, 10 vols., 1958&#150;78, 2.5). In October 1769 Rockingham, in another conversation at Newmarket, found the duke &#145;very hostile to the present administration&#146;  (ibid., 2.91). When Grafton and Camden resigned in January 1770, Northumberland moved into opposition, joining in a number of protests over the Middlesex election issue. He fought hard to retain his position in Middlesex and Westminster. The first was lost to the Wilkite radicals, but Westminster, which his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21944/', "Hugh Percy")</script>, had represented since 1763, was retained in 1768 and 1774. In 1776 Northumberland was joined in the Lords by his son, who succeeded to his mother's barony, becoming Lord Percy. Each of them toyed with opposition, but in February 1778 Northumberland was once more employed by the king to discover whether Chatham would join North's ministry. The negotiation failed, but in December 1778 Northumberland resumed office as master of the horse, though Walpole wrote that he had gout and was too lame to ride, and even the king admitted that he was &#145;not capable of attending much&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of George III</span>, 4.209, letter no. 2436). He held the post until December 1780, when he retired on grounds of ill health.<br>
<br>It was no more than an indication of the king's desperation that he should mention Northumberland in March 1783 to head a ministry to save him from the Fox&#150;North coalition. Nothing came of it, but later that year Northumberland had one more card to play. He voted in December against Fox's <span class="roman">India Bill</span>, as the king wished, and the following month, while Pitt's new ministry faced a hostile House of Commons, his seven votes were at a premium. The price of his &#145;zeal&#146; was the barony of Lovaine, to descend to his second son, Lord Algernon, raised in 1790 to the earldom of Beverley. Northumberland died at Sion House, Middlesex, on 6 June 1786 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 21 June.<br>
<br>Northumberland's remarkable rise drew upon him envy and scorn. Walpole maintained a battery of sneers against his pretensions and &#145;Percy blood&#146;. George III's impression of him was not, at first, very flattering: of the proposal to make him lord chamberlain to the Queen, he wrote to Bute in 1762: &#145;I think him quite cut out for the nothingness of the employment&#146;  (George III, <span class="italic">Letters &hellip; to Lord Bute, 1756&#150;1766</span>, ed. R. Sedgwick, 1939, no. 229). But Northumberland was a handsome man of good presence, his property gave him a certain independence of mind, and he was far from foolish. His position as lord lieutenant of Middlesex brought him considerable unpopularity. During the Wilkite riots of 1769 he was accused of hiring an election mob and threatened with a prosecution. In 1780 the Gordon rioters remembered his family's Catholic origins: he was assaulted and had his pocket picked, and the windows of Northumberland House were broken. His great wealth meant that office was not essential to him and he seems soon to have tired of the routine of attendance and administration. He was FRS, a trustee of the new British Museum, a discerning patron of the arts, and courteous to Johnson, Goldsmith, Thomas Percy, and the botanist John Hill. Northumberland House and Sion House were greatly embellished, and he employed James Paine, Robert Adam, and Capability Brown on a massive rehabilitation of Alnwick Castle. In 1756 he was reported to be &#145;making fine things there&#146;, and in 1768 it was said that &#145;the old naked castle is now the noblest seat I think in the kingdom&#146;  (<span class="italic">Buckinghamshire MSS</span>, 261, 264&#150;5).<br>
<br>Northumberland's eldest son, Lord Hugh, had a distinguished army career: his second son, Lord Algernon, represented Northumberland from 1774 until 1786 but was in poor health and of a retiring disposition. The duchess, regarded as a peeress in her own right, was prominent in society&#151;&#145;constantly wagging&#146; (running around), in George Selwyn's phrase; parts of her journal were published in 1926 as <span class="italic">The Diaries of a Duchess</span>. She was a lady of the bedchamber to Queen Charlotte until 1770, when her husband's temporary move into opposition prompted her to resign. One of the duke's illegitimate children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25944/', "James Smithson (1764&#150;1829)")</script>, was a chemist and mineralogist and left money to found the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.<br>
