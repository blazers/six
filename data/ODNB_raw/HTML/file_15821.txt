<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Kynaston,  Edward</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1643, <em>d.</em> 1712?), <span class="occ">actor</span>, the son of Thomas Kynaston, was baptized at Oswestry, Shropshire, on 20 April 1643. One source suggests that Edward &#145;was well descended. The Kynastons were anciently possessed of a genteel estate at Oteley in Shropshire&#146;  (Betterton, 116). On 5 July 1654 he was bound as an apprentice to John Rhodes in the Company of Drapers for nine years. With Thomas Betterton, Kynaston was introduced to the stage in Rhodes's troupe at the Cockpit, Drury Lane, in March 1660. In the first season Edward played several female parts, including the title role in John Suckling's <span class="italic">Aglaura</span>, Ismena in Beaumont's and Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Maid in the Mill</span>, and Arthiope in William Davenant's <span class="italic">The Unfortunate Lovers</span>:<blockquote>he being then very Young made a Compleat Stage Beauty, performing his Parts so well &hellip; that it has since been Disputeable among the Judicious, whether any Woman that succeeded him so Sensibly touch'd the Audience as he. (Downes, 19)</blockquote>How far Kynaston was successful in these roles, even in a theatrical world infected by the continental preference for actresses, is hinted at by his performance as the Duke's Sister in John Fletcher's <span class="italic">The Loyal Subject</span> on 18 August 1660, where Pepys thought him &#145;the loveliest lady that ever I saw in my life, only her voice not very good&#146;  (Pepys). Cibber recalls that &#145;Ladies of Quality prided themselves on taking him with them in their Coaches to Hyde-Park in his Theatrical Habit, after the play&#146;  (Cibber, 67). When the Rhodes company was absorbed into the two patent house monopoly, Kynaston became a player with Thomas Killigrew's King's Company at the Vere Street Theatre. He was sworn in on 6 October 1660, and for the first season continued to play these female roles, mixing them with young male parts, such as Otto in Fletcher's and Massinger's <span class="italic">The Bloody Brother</span>, Corporal Cocke in Heywood's <span class="italic">The Royal King</span>, and the more troubling title role in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Epicoene</span>, a woman who turns out to be a boy in disguise.<br>
<br>The Burney collection notes record that Edward married Maria in 1661, which might be the marriage registered in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, between Edward Kynaston and Mary Carter on 6 March 1662. According to the parish registers, this Edward and Mary had five surviving children, John, Elizabeth, Arabella, Sarah, and Anne. Kynaston quickly became a leading player within the King's Company and had the means to acquire a whole acting share by 1663. His roles at Vere Street and the new theatre in Bridges Street, Covent Garden, where the company moved in 1663, included Roseilli and Caraffa in John Ford's <span class="italic">Love's Sacrifice</span>, the idealistic Acacis in John Dryden's and Robert Howard's <span class="italic">Indian Queen</span>, the flawed leader Mahomet Boabdelin in both parts of Dryden's <span class="italic">The Conquest of Granada</span>, and the excessively honourable Guymor in his <span class="italic">The Indian Emperor</span>, and the title role in Orrery's <span class="italic">The Black Prince</span>. He also managed young comedic leads such as Peregrine in Jonson's <span class="italic">Volpone</span>, Valentine in William Wycherley's <span class="italic">Love in a Wood</span>, and probably Volscius in the duke of Buckingham's <span class="italic">The Rehearsal</span>.<br>
<br>Edward's involvement in the scandalous <span class="italic">Rehearsal</span> play was not his only foray into satirical personation. Pepys records that a performance of William Cavendish's <span class="italic">The Heiress</span> was cancelled because &#145;Kinaston, that did act a part therein, in abuse to Sir Charles Sedley, being last night exceedingly beaten with sticks, by two or three that assaulted him, so as he is mightily bruised and forced to keep his bed&#146;  (<span class="italic">Pepys</span>, 1 Feb 1669). Kynaston had recovered enough to act by 9 February and the incident did no harm to his reputation. After the disastrous burning of the Bridges Street Theatre in 1672, the King's Company occupied the old Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre and then moved into the rebuilt Drury Lane playhouse in March 1674. Kynaston continued to take important, theatrically demanding roles such as the powerful, controlling Scipio in Lee's <span class="italic">Sophonisba</span>, Harcourt in Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Country Wife</span>, Freeman in his <span class="italic">Plain Dealer</span>, the villainous Morat in Dryden's <span class="italic">Aureng-Zebe</span>, and Leonidas in his <span class="italic">Marriage &agrave; la mode</span>.<br>
<br>As well as being a key player in the company, Kynaston had become involved in the management of the troupe: by May 1676 he held 1&frac14; shares, worth 6<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. every acting day for life, with &pound;100 to his executors. After a breakdown in company management in September 1676 the lord chamberlain appointed Kynaston and three other leading actors, Charles Hart, William Cartwright, and Michael Mohun, to lead the group. This management committee did not take adequate steps to right the company's difficulties, and Hart was appointed with sole responsibility shortly after this, although Kynaston continued to figure on the many documents related to the company's battle with its patent holder, Charles Killigrew. Kynaston announced his decision to retire in 1677 and no new roles are recorded for him, although the King's Company roster was in great disarray during this period. Matters came to a head when, on 14 October 1681, Kynaston and Hart signed a secret agreement with the rival Duke's Company. The King's Company was in dire financial straits by the early 1680s with poor returns for shareholders. All the same, the terms the fifth columnists were prepared to accept are startling. For 5<i>s</i>. a day each they agreed not to &#145;play among or effectually assist the King's Company of Actors&#146; and to make over to the Duke's Company &#145;all the Right, Title and Claim which they or either of them may have to any Plays, Books, Cloaths, and Scenes in the King's Playhouse&#146;. In addition they promised to:<blockquote>promote with all their Power and Interest an Agreement between both playhouses, and Mr Kynaston for himself, promises to endeavour, as much as he can, to get free, that he may act at the Duke's Playhouse, but he is not obliged to play unless he have ten Shillings per Day allowed for his Acting, and his Pension then to cease. (Gildon, 8&#150;9)</blockquote>The companies merged in 1682 and moved into the Drury Lane Theatre. Kynaston appears to have maintained a position as shareholder within the new company and in September that year Charles Hart died and bequeathed his share to Kynaston. Edward was clearly not without means and he may have been the Edward Keynaston of the fashionable Great Queen Street, listed in the baptism registers of St Giles-in-the-Fields on 1 March 1684, and the Kinnaston with property in St Martin's Lane, St Paul, Covent Garden.<br>
<br>In the enlarged United Company it was a sign of how highly Kynaston was regarded that he was immediately encouraged to perform, adding a range of new roles, the first of which was the King in Dryden's and Lee's <span class="italic">The Duke of Guise</span>, a late tory contribution to the Exclusion crisis, on 28 November 1682. Roles he originated included the domestic despot Lord Bellguard in John Crowne's <span class="italic">Sir Courtly Nice</span>, Don Antonio in Thomas D'Urfey's <span class="italic">Banditti</span>, and the faithful lover Bellmour in Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">The Lucky Chance</span>. In his playing of Muley Moloch in Dryden's <span class="italic">Don Sebastian</span>, Cibber thought &#145;he had a fierce Lion-like Majesty in his Port and Utterance that gave the Spectator a kind of trembling Admiration&#146;  (Cibber, 68). Cibber recalls his &#145;piercing eye, and in characters of heroick life, a quick imperious vivacity, in his tone of voice, that painted the tyrant truly terrible&#146;. He found him particularly noteworthy as the King in <span class="italic">Henry IV</span> where &#145;every sentiment came from him, as if it had been his own, as if he had himself, that instant, conceiv'd it, as if he had lost the player and were the real king he personated&#146;  (Cibber, 69). Kynaston's range as a performer is illustrated by the roles he tackled, and Cibber also praised the variety Kynaston could offer within roles, finding moments of bathetic laughter as the villain in <span class="italic">Aureng-Zebe</span> and quiet menace in <span class="italic">Henry IV</span>, where lesser actors might have chosen bullying volume.<br>
<br>By the 1690s Kynaston was earning &pound;3 a week but acting less frequently, according to a complaint filed by Christopher Rich and Thomas Skipwith, who were trying to stop the older players from defecting to form a new company in 1695  (Milhous, 244). However, Kynaston continued to take on new roles in the Actors' Company including Hystaspes in John Banks's <span class="italic">Cyrus the Great</span>, Friendly in fellow actor Doggett's <span class="italic">The Country Wake</span>, the avenging prince of Libardian in Delariviere Manley's <span class="italic">The Royal Mischief</span>, Paulinus in Charles Hopkins's <span class="italic">Boadicea</span>, and the earl of Warwick in Mary Pix's <span class="italic">Queen Catherine</span>. A manuscript cast of Southerne's <span class="italic">Fatal Marriage</span> lists Kynaston as the heartless father-in-law, Count Baldwin, which might indicate that Kynaston was still playing as late as 24 April 1701. Little is known of the last years of his life, although he remained a ground rent shareholder at the Drury Lane Theatre. He is probably the Edward Kynaston who was buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden, London, on 30 July 1712.<br>
