<span class="headword">Phillips,  Augustine</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1605), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was the son of Agnes Phillips and her second husband. Nothing else is known of his antecedents or of the route along which he entered the emergent professional theatre, but the wording of his will makes it clear that he considered himself a gentleman, and he was one of a number of players who applied for, and may have acquired, a coat of arms. There is an intriguing reference to this in a complaint by William Smith, a pursuivant in the College of Heralds, that &#145;Phillips the player had graven in a gold ring armes of Sr Wm Phillipp, Lord Bardolph, with the said L. Bardolph's cote quartred&#146;  (Nungezer, 282). It may well be that Phillips claimed kinship, fraudulently or authentically, with Lord Bardolph, perhaps furnishing Shakespeare with an in-house joke in the naming of characters in <span class="italic">Henry IV</span>. He was one of the first generation of actors to claim social status for the profession.<br>
<br>Phillips is first mentioned in the surviving playhouse synopsis of the lost play <span class="italic">The Seven Deadly Sins</span>. Probably written by Richard Tarlton, this play was in the repertory of Lord Strange's Men between 1590 and 1592, when the synopsis was prepared. Phillips had already high standing as an actor when <span class="italic">The Seven Deadly Sins</span> was played. Cast as Sardanapalus, he was one of only two players not required to take more than one part. His name appears again on the travelling licence granted by the privy council to Strange's Men on 6 May 1593. After touring the provinces through the summer and autumn of 1593, when Londoners were dying of the plague, Lord Strange's Men returned to the city in time for the reopening of the playhouses in December. Perhaps because touring had unduly strained company relationships, they were in some disarray, and the untimely death of their aristocratic patron in April 1594 confirmed the company's dissolution. Almost certainly Phillips was among the small band of actors who regrouped under the patronage of Henry Carey, Lord Hunsdon. As the Lord Chamberlain's Men, they rose to supremacy between 1594 and 1603, performing initially at the Theatre and then, after 1599, at the Globe. There is only presumptive evidence that Phillips was a founder member, with William Shakespeare and others, of this outstanding company. The 1616 folio edition of Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">Works</span> names him third among the &#145;principall Comoedians&#146; who performed <span class="italic">Every Man in his Humour</span> in 1598, and that is the earliest dated reference to his prominent place in the company, in which he may have been a shareholder. He was certainly one of five actors (Shakespeare was another) to have purchased a 10 per cent share in the Globe enterprise in 1599, and to have remained a sharer until his death.<br>
<br>Since Sardanapalus is the only part with which he is certainly identified, attempts to categorize Phillips's acting style are necessarily speculative. His profound involvement in and with the company is, however, certain. Among the legatees named in his will, eleven were fellow actors. In an uncommonly generous gesture he also bequeathed &pound;5 to be shared among the unnamed hired men. Of particular interest is the gift of theatrical costumes to &#145;my late apprentice&#146; Samuel Gilburne, and of musical instruments to James Sands &#145;at thexpiracon of his yeares in his Indentur or Aprenticehood&#146;  (Honigmann and Brock, 73). This is the best evidence we have of an established apprenticeship system in the Elizabethan theatre.<br>
<br>On the reasonable assumption that Phillips could himself play the instruments he left to Sands, it can fairly be claimed that he was a versatile performer, skilled enough to sing and dance in the popular post-play jigs (&#145;Phillips his Gigg of the Slyppers&#146; was entered in the Stationers' register on 26 May 1595) and effective in both tragedy and comedy. He was also sufficiently authoritative in the company to have been the negotiator with the earl of Essex's party over the notorious revival of <span class="italic">Richard II</span> at the Globe on 7 February 1601, the eve of Essex's ill-fated uprising. Phillips's protestations of innocence at the Essex trial, which may have helped to save the Chamberlain's Men from punishment, are not entirely convincing, but they provide additional evidence of his loyalty to his colleagues.<br>
<br>Phillips's professional life exemplifies the intricate network of Elizabethan theatrical connections, an intricacy reflected in his own domestic circumstance. Through the first of his mother's four marriages he was probably a stepbrother of the clown Thomas Pope. His sister was married to Robert Goughe, who joined the company shortly after James I had taken it into his patronage as the King's Men. The apprentices named in his will were brought up as members of his household, a contrast if not an antidote to female dominance. Of the several children born to Phillips and his wife, Anne, only daughters (and not all of them) survived infancy. The three eldest are named in his will. The firstborn, Magdalen, was baptized in St Saviour's Church, Southwark, on 29 September 1594, when her perhaps recently married parents were living in Horseshoe Court.<br>
<br>For the next ten years, as the family grew, Phillips continued to live close to the playhouse where he worked. He handled his increasing wealth wisely and in 1604 was able to purchase a country house in Mortlake, not far from Richmond Palace. Andrew Gurr has plausibly argued that the King's Men assembled there, out of reach of the plague, before making their visit to Wilton House to perform before the new king, who had not yet risked entering the disease-ridden capital  (Gurr, 54). It was in his Mortlake home that Phillips, &#145;sick and weake in body, but of good and perfecte mynde and Remembraunce&#146;, made his will on 4 May 1605, instructing that his body be buried in the chancel of the parish church. By 13 May he was dead. The will, proved by his widow on that day, testifies to the warmth of his playhouse friendships. From the little available evidence, Phillips seems to have merited the description of &#145;deserving man&#146; accorded to him by his fellow sharer Cuthbert Burbage in 1635  (Bentley, 136). His widow made an unfortunate second marriage, to John Witter, who squandered her inheritance. After litigation Phillips's share in the Globe reverted to his former associates, Heminges and Condell, the first of whom was one of his executors. Condell, like Shakespeare, was one of the King's Men to be made 30<i>s</i>. richer by Phillips's will.<br>
