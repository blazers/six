<span class="headword">Sanders,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1610, <em>d.</em> 1695), <span class="occ">parliamentarian soldier and politician</span>, was baptized on 19 August 1610 at All Saints' Church, Caldwell, Derbyshire, the first son of Collingwood Sanders (1578&#150;1653) of Caldwell, and his wife, Elizabeth Sleigh, daughter of Edmund Sleigh, of Little Ireton, Derbyshire. His great-grandfather&#151;the scion of a Surrey gentry family&#151;had settled in Derbyshire by the early sixteenth century, and his grandfather had acquired the manor of Caldwell in Elizabeth's reign, and Little Ireton and other nearby properties in the early seventeenth century. Sanders was educated at Derby and Repton grammar schools, before being admitted to the Inner Temple on 12 July 1633. In 1640 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Goring of Booth, Staffordshire, with whom he had five sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Early in 1642 Sanders signed a petition from the Derbyshire gentry, urging the king to return to Westminster &#145;for the Reformation of those great grievances which had crept both into the Church and Common Wealth&#146;  (Sitwell, 22&#150;3). In February he and his father signed a petition from the county to the Commons, calling for the advancement of the &#145;blessed work of Reformation&#146;  (Parl. Arch., 26 March 1642, Main papers, fol. 65). That autumn he was commissioned as a captain of dragoons in the regiment of Derbyshire's parliamentarian commander, Sir John Gell. Among the men Sanders recruited for his troop was the godly minister Nathaniel Barton. Friction between Sanders and Gell prompted Sanders to accept a commission in April 1643 as a lieutenant-colonel in the foot regiment of the Staffordshire parliamentarian Richard Haughton. When Derby was threatened the following month by the king's forces, Sanders allegedly sent back his colours and commission to Gell and refused to come to his assistance. In autumn 1643, he raised a regiment of horse in Derbyshire of which Gell was made colonel, but on the understanding that Sanders, as major, should exercise actual command so long as he observed Gell's &#145;reasonable desires&#146;  (Derbys. RO, D1232/O/30). Sanders commissioned Barton as one of his captains. In October 1643 Sanders was added to the Derbyshire county committee, of which he became a leading member. Predictably, the confused command structure between Sanders and Gell soon collapsed. Sanders and his officers complained to parliament that Gell was using his influence on the county committee to favour his own troops. Sanders was also critical of the appointment of Gell's brother, Thomas, as recorder of Derby in December 1644, declaring him deficient in legal knowledge and honesty, and a favourer of &#145;malignants&#146;  (ibid., D1232/O/9a). Sir John Gell hit back by traducing Sanders as a &#145;Brownist&#146; and a coward  (ibid., D1232/O/9b). The Gells presented charges against Sanders to the earl of Essex early in 1645, and placed him, briefly, under house arrest for refusing a new commission from the earl that would have left him entirely under Gell's command. For their part, Sanders and his friends solicited the help of Ferdinando, Lord Fairfax, and his son Sir Thomas Fairfax, the commander of the New Model Army. As a result of this quarrel, Nathaniel Barton was effectively driven out of Derbyshire and joined the New Model, while Sanders himself took service under Sir William Brereton in Cheshire. Brereton tried to enlist the help of the Independent grandees Oliver St John and Sir Henry Vane junior on Sanders's behalf, praising his regiment as &#145;most serviceable &hellip; and worthy of encouragement, many of the officers and men being godly men and such as serve out of conscience &hellip; there is not any regiment that I know in the kingdom which might be more useful and faithful to you&#146;  (Dore, 126). Although Sanders has been labelled a religious Independent, the evidence suggests that he favoured a national presbyterian church with toleration for tender consciences. His friends in the ministry were willing to certify in 1645 that he was neither an Independent nor a separatist.<br>
<br>Having failed in 1646 to take his regiment into the New Model, Sanders was serving by September 1647 as a major in Francis Thornhagh's regiment of Nottinghamshire horse. In spring and summer 1648 he assisted Cromwell in suppressing royalist uprisings along the Welsh border, and in securing the region for parliament. It is very likely that he fought at the battle of Preston on 17 August; and when Thornhagh was killed in action the next day, Sanders was appointed colonel in his place.<br>
<br>Sanders, like Barton, attended the Whitehall debates on the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span> in December 1648. His voting pattern indicates that while he agreed with Henry Ireton and other &#145;conservative&#146; officers in allowing parliament to have the final word on moral issues, he desired &#145;a reserve concerning religion&#146;  (Taft, &#145;Voting lists&#146;, 148)&#151;a concession to the Levellers' demand that toleration and other key liberties were inalienable rights. Early in December, his regiment petitioned Fairfax, requesting that &#145;justice might take place upon all, from the highest to the lowest, from the King to the meanest Subject&#146;  (<span class="italic">Declarations and humble representations</span>, 7 Dec 1648). It was reported in January 1649 that Sanders and Barton &#145;censure the king deeply&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ninth Report</span>, 3 vols., HMC, 8, 1883&#150;4, pt 2, 394). Sanders saw active service again in the Worcester campaign in 1651, and he and his regiment served a brief tour of duty in Scotland during the early 1650s. Sanders was evidently an admirer of Cromwell at this stage, telling him that &#145;God hath made you the man of his right hand, stronge and successeful for himself, [His] cause, and saints&#146;  (Nickolls, 22).<br>
<br>In the elections to the first protectoral parliament in 1654, Sanders and Barton were among the four men returned for Derbyshire. In mid-September 1654, however, following the protectoral council's efforts to exclude opponents of the government, Sanders joined Colonel Matthew Alured, Colonel John Okey, Colonel Francis Hacker, the former Leveller John Wildman, and Vice-Admiral John Lawson in plotting the overthrow of the protectorate. The conspiracy was quickly broken by Secretary John Thurloe, and its only upshot was a petition, drafted by Wildman, attacking the protectoral settlement. Intended for general circulation in the army, the petition had only been signed by Alured, Okey, and Sanders when it was seized by the government.<br>
<br>Addressed to the protector, <span class="italic">The Petition of Several Colonels</span>, as it came to be known, declaimed against Cromwell's king-like control over a standing army and his negative voice upon the legislature, and demanded &#145;constant successive Parliaments, to be equally and freely chosen by the People &hellip; And that nothing should be imposed upon or taken from the People but by their Parliaments&#146;  (Saunders, Okey, and Allured). The petition concluded by asking for a &#145;full and truly free Parliament&#146; to settle the government according to the &#145;Fundamental Rights &hellip; proposed to the late Parliament [the Rump] by the General Councel of the Army in the <span class="italic">Agreement of the People</span>&#146;  (ibid.)&#151;the version of the <span class="italic">Agreement</span> that emerged from the Whitehall debates in the winter of 1648&#150;9. The petition's discovery resulted in the cashiering or resignation of the three colonels who had signed it.<br>
<br>Despite his opposition to the Cromwellian r&eacute;gime, Sanders retained his place on the Derbyshire and Staffordshire benches. In autumn 1655 he was appointed to the Derbyshire commission to assist Major-General Edward Whalley in administering the decimation tax, but he refused to serve. Whalley believed that Sanders was &#145;a good man, but too much over-persuaded by Col. Barton&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 4.241). Returned for one of the county seats in the elections to the second protectoral parliament in 1656, he was excluded from the house as an opponent of the protectorate. In the elections to Richard Cromwell's parliament of 1659, he was returned for Derbyshire again, but there is no evidence that he ever took his seat. He apparently approved of the army's dissolution of the protectorate in April 1659, and by the end of that month he had been restored to the command of his horse regiment. In July the restored Rump agreed to his request that Barton serve as his major.<br>
<br>In August 1659 Sanders and Barton helped to suppress the Derbyshire component of Sir George Boothe's royalist&#150;presbyterian rebellion. However, Sanders's lenient treatment of the insurgents prompted suspicion that he was complicit in their design, or at least sympathetic to their demands for a &#145;free&#146; parliament. In September Sanders and Barton joined Okey, Hacker, and other officers in denouncing a petition that Lambert's forces had sent to parliament, demanding the establishment of a senate to offset the power of the legislature. This same group opposed the army's dissolution of the restored Rump in mid-October 1659. In a petition to Lieutenant-General Charles Fleetwood on 1 November, Sanders, Barton, Alured, Okey, and several other officers remonstrated that it had never been part of the good old cause &#145;to wrest all power and authority out of the hands of the people's representatives in parliament, and to fix it in the army&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 7.773). They insisted that the army should be subordinate to parliament, and demanded the holding of new elections on as broad a franchise &#145;as the safety of the cause will bear&#146;  (ibid., 7.774). The petitioners were removed from their commands, and Sanders's estate was seized pending his trial on charges of abetting Boothe's rebellion. The committee of safety evidently regarded Sanders and Barton as a security threat, for at some point in November or December they were imprisoned at Coventry. When the Rump was restored again late in December 1659, it gave order for the two men's release, whereupon Sanders took charge of disarming the opponents of parliament in Derbyshire and Staffordshire. With the approval of General George Monck, the Rump gave Sanders a new regiment of horse and restored Barton as his major. Sanders and Barton had joined Monck in London by 10 February 1660, when, &#145;as two Officers that very much inclined to Admission of the Secluded Members [the MPs secluded at Pride's Purge]&#146;  (Baker, 685), they were consulted by the general about whether to pressure the Rump into issuing writs for new elections.<br>
<br>Sanders lost all his offices at the Restoration, but having retained only a &#145;few small rents&#146; of the crown lands he had purchased with army debentures in the 1650s, he was required to relinquish very little of his estate  (TNA: PRO, E 113/11, unfol.). Allegations that he and Barton were involved in fomenting rebellion in 1664 were not substantiated. In 1672 Sanders's houses at Little Ireton and Caldwell were licensed as presbyterian meeting places, and the ejected presbyterian minister Samuel Ogden was licensed to preach at Little Ireton. In the wake of the Rye House plot in 1683, Sanders was required to enter a &pound;2000 bond for his good behaviour. He died in summer 1695, and was buried at Mugginton, Derbyshire, on 15 August 1695. In his will he charged his estate&#151;which included the manors of Caldwell and Little Ireton, lands in the surrounding parishes, and a messuage in the parish of All Saints, Derby&#151;with portions of &pound;3300 for his younger daughters. He was succeeded by his only surviving son, Thomas.<br>
