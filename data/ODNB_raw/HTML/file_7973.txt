<span class="headword">Downes,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1609, <em>d.</em> in or after 1666), <span class="occ">regicide</span>, was baptized on 16 July 1609 at Manby, Lincolnshire, the eldest surviving son of Richard Downes (<i>d</i>. 1618/19) of Manby and his wife, Elizabeth. Although characterized as having come from a &#145;mean family&#146;  (Noble, 191), the family's fortunes were probably rising. Downes was admitted to the Inner Temple in November 1631 and called to the bar on 1 May 1642. By that stage he had married twice; his first marriage was to Joanna, daughter of Richard Mosely of Tunstall in Staffordshire, and his second, by a licence of 11 April 1634, was to Catherine (<i>d</i>. before 1653), daughter of Francis Townley of Littleton in Middlesex. <br>
<br>In October 1633 Downes became one of the two auditors of the duchy of Cornwall, and the contacts made in connection with his employment probably included the patron who secured his return to parliament for Arundel, in a county to which he had no prior connection, in a by-election in December 1641. Downes was returned amid controversy and opposition from the secretary to Thomas Howard, fourteenth earl of Arundel, a Catholic, but was able to take his seat with support from prominent godly MPs. He made little impact in the house before Pride's Purge, and was reported as having said that &#145;I do not often trouble you with speeches&#146;  (Fry, 18). Nevertheless, he became one of the most zealous parliamentarians in Sussex during the civil war, and helped ensure that parliament, rather than the king, secured the income from duchy lands. By 1647 he was aligned with the independents at Westminster, and became more active after the purge. He was involved in suppressing pamphlets by the secluded members, joined the powerful army committee, and was appointed to the high court of justice to try Charles I. He later claimed that his name was inserted in the act late in the day, and that he was pressurized into taking part in the trial, and succumbed &#145;through weakness and fear&#146;  (Downes), although he attended ten of the meetings in the painted chamber. It was in one of these that Downes clashed with another MP, John Fry, whom he accused of blasphemy for his unitarian views. Downes subsequently attacked Fry in the Commons, and was instrumental in securing his suspension from the house. Furthermore, Downes developed reservations about the proceedings against the king, and on 27 January, having attended all four days of the trial, expressed his objections to fellow commissioners. As the sentence was about to be read Downes rose to declare his dissent and demanded an adjournment, in which he said that the king ought to be allowed to speak. Cromwell, who called Downes a &#145;peevish man&#146;, said that &#145;he would fain save his old master&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 5.1213). Downes refused to return to the high court, and although he signed the death warrant he later claimed to have done so only under duress. He also claimed to have hoped that the trial would force a settlement rather than result in Charles's execution. <br>
<br>Although Downes faced hostility for his actions, including a pamphlet attack by John Fry entitled <span class="italic">The Accuser Sham'd</span>, he continued to fulfil his duties on committees and in relation to the duchy of Cornwall. He re-emerged in the Commons in July and was awarded &pound;3000 when he resigned his post as auditor, and thereafter government finances and the affairs of the army came to dominate his career. Although he later claimed that he was &#145;never of any junto or cabal&#146;  (Downes), Downes worked closely with the civilian republicans, with whom he shared a religious and social conservatism. A member of the committee for plundered ministers from July 1650, Downes was a religious independent but zealous against sectarians, although he later claimed to have protected a group of presbyterian divines who faced the death penalty for their part in the &#145;Love plot&#146; during the early 1650s. <br>
<br>In recognition of his hard work as an administrator Downes was elected to the council of state in November 1651, although his activity was slight, and his career continued to be dominated by his work as chairman of the army committee and in matters regarding the treasury, which eventually resulted in his nomination to the powerful revenue committee in October 1652. He was obviously an important figure during the Anglo-Dutch War, although this perhaps resulted in his removal from the council of state in November 1652. Although he played little part in the political machinations in the dying days of the Rump, he appears to have acquiesced to its dissolution, and continued to fulfil his responsibilities in the weeks which followed. However, during both Barebone's Parliament and the protectorate Downes withdrew from political and administrative affairs, and apparently retired to his estate at Hampstead. Some time before 1653 he married for the third time, although the background of his wife, Hannah, is unknown. <br>
<br>Downes re-emerged during 1659, and resumed his position of influence in the Commons when the Rump was recalled in May as an ally of the civilian republicans and in relation to financial affairs. He was also named to the council of state, although he withdrew from the house shortly before its sittings were interrupted by the army in October, returning to Westminster in December and to membership of the army committee. He appears to have withdrawn from the Commons in early February 1660, shortly after the arrival of General Monck and shortly before the readmission of the secluded members. Downes faced arrest as a regicide in May 1660, which prompted his publication of a vindication of his career and actions. This failed to prevent his arrest in June or his trial in the following October, at which he &#145;pleaded ignorance, and acknowledged the guilt, but denied the malice&#146;  (Ludlow, 267). He denied being instrumental in the proceedings, and pleaded that he had signed the death warrant only after death threats. He was found guilty, but was reprieved from execution and sent to the Tower. Although considered for release in February 1662, he remained in prison and in poverty. In April 1663 he appealed to John Robinson, the lord mayor, begging to be &#145;thrust into some hole where he might silently be slain&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 29/71, fol. 20). The date of Downes's death is unknown, although it was after November 1666, when he was still listed among the prisoners in the Tower.<br>
