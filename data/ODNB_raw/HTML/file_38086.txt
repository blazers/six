<span class="headword">Valera,  Cipriano  de</span>  (<em>c.</em>1532&#150;<em>c.</em>1606), <span class="occ">theologian and translator</span>, was probably born in Valera la Vieja in the Badajoz province of Spain; he graduated in logic and philosophy from the University of Seville and then entered the monastery of the Observant Hieronymites at San Isidoro del Campo near Seville. In the 1550s monks at San Isidoro, including Cassiodoro de Reina, as well as Valera, were taking up a protestant position. Faced with an investigation by the Inquisition in 1557, Valera and fellow protestants fled to Geneva, where they joined the Italian church in the city but were later given a place of worship of their own. Following Elizabeth's accession, Valera left Geneva for England, where he probably joined the Spanish congregation which met under the ministry of Reina in the London church of St Mary Axe. He was incorporated as BA at Cambridge on 9 February 1560. A royal mandate of 12 January 1561 made him a fellow of Magdalene.<br>
<br>In Spain Valera was burnt in effigy by the Inquisition in April 1562 and he came to be listed in the Index as &#145;the Spanish heretic&#146;. On 12 June 1563 at Cambridge he took the degree of MA, incorporated at Oxford on 21 February 1566. He served as college treasurer at Magdalene from 1564 to 1566, but between 1561 and 1568 he registered many more absences from college than any other fellow, and in 1568 he settled in London, where in January 1569 he was recorded as a member of the French protestant church. He married a woman named Anne, with whom he had a son, baptized Isaac, and two other children, one of them perhaps a daughter named Judith. He was listed as a schoolmaster in May 1571, and again in 1573, when he was named in the will of a Spanish refugee. He was poor, and he and his family received doles of money during the 1570s and early 1580s. By 1583 Valera, his wife, and son Isaac were recorded as members of the London Italian church and he was listed as a preacher in that year.<br>
<br>In 1588, the Armada year, Valera published his first work, the anti-Catholic <span class="italic">Dos tratados: el primo es del papa, &hellip; el segundo es de la missa</span> (&#145;Two treatises, the first on the pope, the second on the mass&#146;). It is possible that the earl of Leicester was the patron for this work. The fact that London was omitted as the place of publication and the name of the English printer Hispanicized suggests that the book was intended for import into Spain. In 1594 he published another <i>tratado</i> (<span class="italic">Tratado para confirmar los pobres cativos de Berveria en la catolica fe</span>) which, ostensibly intended to offer consolation to captives of the Barbary pirates, may have alluded to the persecution of religious dissidents in Spain. Some copies of this treatise also carry an attack, aimed at a Spanish-speaking readership, on bogus miracles that Valera alleged against the prioress of a convent in Lisbon. In 1596 came Valera's tribute to Calvin&#151;a translation into Spanish of Calvin's <span class="italic">Catechism</span>&#151;and in the same year his <span class="italic">El Testamento Nuevo de nuestro Se&ntilde;or Jesu Christo</span> (1596). This &#145;New Testament of our Lord Jesus Christ&#146;, with its publishing details once more concealed so as to reach a readership within Spain, was the first instalment of a revision of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Spanish published by Reina at Basel in 1569.<br>
<br>During the late 1590s Valera extended his work as a mediator of Calvinist protestantism in Spanish with his version of Calvin's <span class="italic">Institutes</span>, <span class="italic">Institucion de la religion Christiana</span>, published in London in 1597 and amended for Spanish readers. In 1599 he composed the preface for <span class="italic">Catholico reformado</span>, a Spanish translation of a work by William Perkins, and in 1600, anonymously, <span class="italic">Aviso a los de la iglesia Romana sobre la indiccion del jubileo</span>, an attack on the papal holy year then being celebrated in Rome. Finally he completed his revision of Reina, published in Holland as <span class="italic">La Biblia, que es los sacros libros del Vieio y Nueuo Testamento, segunda edicion, revisita y conferida con los textos Hebreos y Griegos y con diversas translaciones, por Cypriano de Valera</span> (&#145;The Bible, that is, the holy books of the Old and New Testament, revised and compared with the Hebrew and Greek texts and with various translations&#146;, 1602). The publication costs may have been met by Prince Christian I of Anhalt-Bernberg; the work was dedicated to Count Maurice of Nassau, the stadholder of Holland. Valera travelled to Amsterdam in November 1602 to supervise the printing and went on to Middleburg, but most probably returned to London where he died, probably about 1606. His work on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Spanish can be considered his most lasting achievement.<br>
