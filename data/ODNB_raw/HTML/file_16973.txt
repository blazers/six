<span class="headword">Long, Sir  Robert</span>, first baronet  (<em>c.</em>1602&#150;1673), <span class="occ">politician and exchequer official</span>, came from an old Wiltshire family. His father, Sir Walter Long (1560&#150;1610), married twice and left his principal estate to the son of his first marriage; but he was still able to settle property at Draycot Cerne on Long's eldest brother of the whole blood. Long was the eighth (but fourth surviving) son, being the youngest son of Sir Walter and his second wife, Katherine (<i>d</i>. 1613), daughter of Sir John Thynne of Longleat. As a widow she married into a Shropshire family called Fox, and her eldest son and two of her six daughters settled in that county without much &eacute;clat. Long was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1619 and called to the bar eight years later. By then he was acting as secretary to his brother's father-in-law, the decrepit lord treasurer, the first earl of Marlborough, on whose interest he was elected for Devizes to the parliaments of 1626 and 1628&#150;9. A totally inactive member and none too reliable an administrator, he devoted his energies to ingratiating himself with the newly arrived queen, Henrietta Maria, whose creature he became. After Marlborough's long-overdue resignation, Long entered the royal service, though for many years under the personal government of Charles I he had to be content with minor commissions and reversions. He was chiefly engaged as undertaker in a Lincolnshire drainage project, a work sufficiently important to excuse him from military service against the Scots in 1639. One of his reversions as receiver of recusant revenue south of the Trent fell in at this juncture, and the queen made him her surveyor-general. From her jointure he acquired an interest in the forest of Galtres, between York and Boroughbridge, and he became a gentleman of the chamber. He sat for Midhurst in the Short Parliament on the interest of the Roman Catholic Viscount Montagu, but he stood down at the autumn election.<br>
<br>During the civil war Long joined the king at Oxford, where, as reversioner to the parliamentarian Sir Robert Pye, he was appointed writer of tallies in the exchequer. More significant to his career was his appointment as secretary to the young prince of Wales, whom he attended in the west country. Long was accused of precipitating the final royalist collapse here by providing parliament with intelligence about divisions among the commanders. He himself made his way to London, and thence to Paris, where he was welcomed by the queen and sent to rejoin the prince in Jersey, primarily to manage correspondence with royalist conspirators. Nevertheless on 19 November 1646 the parliamentary authorities received a petition from Long, offering to compound for his estates; but all the papers are missing from their records. When a part of the parliamentary fleet placed itself at the prince's disposal in 1648, Long went aboard to replenish the royalist coffers from a blockade of the Thames. Prizes were taken, but the results were disappointing, and Long, who was &#145;thought to love money too well&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.415), was accused of lining his own pockets.<br>
<br>The execution of Charles I left the Louvre faction, controlled by Henrietta Maria and her favourite Henry Jermyn, dominant in royalist counsels. They relied on Long to keep the prince steady and fast to the presbyterian alliance, and accordingly he warmly supported the move to Scotland. But Long was himself unacceptable to the Scots and had to return to the continent, while his property in England was included in the <span class="roman">Act of Sale</span> of 16 July 1651. On the surrender of Jersey at the end of the year, the Commonwealth government came into possession of a trunkful of compromising letters. Long &#145;had not the good fortune to be generally well thought of&#146;  (Clarendon, <span class="italic">Hist. rebellion</span>, 4.323). His duties as secretary of state were transferred to Sir Edward Hyde, and Long left the court, though he still tried to make trouble for his supplanter by supporting an absurd allegation of a secret interview with Cromwell in London.<br>
<br>At the Restoration, Long wrote from Rouen to beg Hyde's forgiveness, urging compassion on his &#145;destitute condition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarendon State Papers</span>, 4.676), from which he was to emerge, after thirteen years of office, as owner of &#145;a very vast estate&#146;  (Christie, <span class="italic">Letters to Williamson</span>, 118). Giving his triumphant rival no further trouble, he regained his post as the queen's surveyor-general, acquiring from her Worcester Park in Surrey and Higham Ferrars Park in Northamptonshire, and ultimately became receiver-general of her revenues. It was on her interest that Long was elected for Boroughbridge in 1661, but in the first ten sessions of the Cavalier Parliament he was named to only forty-three committees, none of them of much political significance. When in 1662 he at last succeeded Pye as auditor of the lower exchequer, he was made a baronet. Much matured from the incompetent young secretary of 1626, Long now showed himself &#145;exceptional among 17th century Exchequer officials in having a conscientious devotion to the personal performance of his duties&#146;  (Roseveare, 30). Perhaps the mistrustful nature shown in his will left him incapable of delegating responsibility. Even more unexpectedly, while eschewing politics, he became a vocal supporter of the reforms introduced by the niggardly Sir George Downing, on whose behalf he had regularly to entertain officials from other departments, such as Samuel Pepys. This modest expense he was well able to afford while purchasing three Yorkshire manors and Athelhampton in Dorset, and spending &pound;2500 on repairs to Worcester Park. With the collapse of Downing's &#145;payment in course&#146; on the stop of the exchequer in 1672, Long could no longer avoid involvement in politics. He was restored to the privy council in July, and on 21 December attended a small meeting in Lord Arlington's lodgings to prepare for a stormy session in parliament. But he was not to face it after the recess of 29 March 1673. Weak of body with a long and lingering disease, Long was under the care of the Shropshire-born Dr Walter Needham. A lifelong bachelor, Long had secured a special remainder to his baronetcy for his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16968/', "Sir James Long")</script> of Draycot Cerne. The other executor was Sir Richard Mason, a household official from a minor Shropshire family who had married James Long's daughter. But the bulk of the estate was entailed on his great-nephew James Long junior, who had made a much grander match with a daughter of a prominent Dorset churchman, Giles Strangways. A codicil added two months later, however, might be interpreted as evidence of a different spiritual allegiance, for he left &pound;600, half of which consisted of a debt due from an English merchant in Rouen, &#145;for the good and benefitt of my Soule&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/341/236), as privately communicated to Mason. Long died on 13 July 1673, and was buried on 28 July in Westminster Abbey according to the Anglican rite.<br>
