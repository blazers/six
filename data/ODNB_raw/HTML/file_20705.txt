<span class="headword">Oliphant,  Francis Wilson <span class="st"> [Frank]</span></span>  (1818&#150;1859), <span class="occ">painter and designer of stained glass</span>, was born on 28 September 1818 at Gateshead, co. Durham, and baptized at St Mary's Church there on 15 September 1819, the son of Thomas Oliphant (<i>c</i>.1787&#150;1856), a glass cutter, and his wife, Margery. He studied drawing at the Trustees' Academy, Edinburgh, under Sir William Allan and was involved from an early age in the stained-glass industry, which was undergoing rapid expansion. The revival of Gothic style and ornament led him to make a profound study of ecclesiastical art, visiting many of the great northern European cathedrals. He worked first for the firm of Ballantine and Allan, Edinburgh, and then as chief designer for William Wailes, Newcastle, who supplied glass to Augustus Welby Pugin. About 1847 he moved to London and worked as Pugin's second designer, especially upon the painted windows in the new houses of parliament. He also sent in a cartoon to the competition for the decoration of Westminster Hall, which was not successful. During this period Oliphant exhibited several pictures in the Royal Academy, the chief being a large Shakespearian study of the interview between Richard II and John of Gaunt, and a striking picture of the prodigal son, <span class="italic">Nearing Home</span>. On 4 May 1852 he married his cousin, Margaret Oliphant Wilson (1828&#150;1897) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20712/', "Oliphant, Margaret Oliphant Wilson")</script>], who was beginning to be known as a writer. They seem to have had a troubled relationship, and the couple soon became dependent on her earnings.<br>
<br>By his mid-thirties Oliphant was able to write, &#145;the number of windows that have been executed from my designs is past counting and are in nearly every county and cathedral in England&#146;  (Letter to Major William Blackwood, 26 March 1856, NL Scot., Blackwood MS 4119). But he was not satisfied with the way his designs were carried out. In 1854 he set up a small stained-glass workshop, hoping to create better quality windows, and also to have more time for his painting. This workshop produced the windows in the ante-chapel of King's College, Cambridge, those in the chancel of Aylesbury church, Buckinghamshire, and several in Ely Cathedral. The famous choristers' window at Ely was the joint work of Oliphant and William Dyce RA, the former being responsible for the original design.<br>
<br>But owing to Oliphant's lack of business sense, the project made heavy losses. In 1857 he developed tuberculosis and was eventually forced to give up work. He left England in January 1859 with his family to seek a warmer climate and died at via Babuino 56 in Rome on 20 October 1859, and was buried in the English cemetery there. He left a daughter and two sons, one born after his death.<br>
<br>Mrs Oliphant was always reserved about her husband. His friend William Bell Scott thought that he became &#145;an idle and aimless man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell Scott</span>, ed. W. Minto, 1892, 1.188). &#145;He had the ability and the knowledge to imitate the medieval glass of the successive periods of architecture, and yet his ambition was to be a painter of history, which ambition was fatal to him&#146;  (ibid.). His only book, <span class="italic">A Plea for Painted Glass</span> (1855), shows him to have been an idealist who dreamed of competing with the great artists of the middle ages. He was capable of generous but reckless acts, like presenting a window to Aylesbury church when no one could be found to pay for it. None of his paintings is known to have survived, but his stained glass is excellent.<br>
