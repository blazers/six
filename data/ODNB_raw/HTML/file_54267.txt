<span class="headword">Lindsay family</span>, earls of Crawford  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1380&#150;1495), <span class="occ">nobility</span>, became important in the history of north-east Scotland, and especially Angus, in the fourteenth century.<h2>
<a name="Thebasisforanearldom"></a>The basis for an earldom</h2>Originating in the twelfth century, the family rose through service to the crown and a series of profitable marriages. Two other branches had died out, but the Lindsays of Crawford, Lanarkshire, still flourished in the mid-fourteenth century. <a name="cosubject_16689"></a><span class="headword">David Lindsay</span>, first earl of Crawford  (<em>d.</em> 1407)<span class="occ"></span>, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/74925/', "Sir Alexander Lindsay")</script> of Glenesk, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54261/', "Sir David Lindsay")</script> of Crawford [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54260/', "Lindsay family (per. c.1250&#150;c.1400)")</script>], and his first wife, Katherine, daughter of Sir John Stirling of Glenesk. Alexander died in Crete, probably early in 1382, while undertaking a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Yet it was not before Martinmas 1382, and in some instances not until 1384, that Sir David (who seems to have been knighted by the early 1380s) gained title to his father's legacy. This was composed of various heritable annuities (drawn from the burgh fermes of Aberdeen, Crail, and Forfar) and a disparate collection of lands: Glenesk and Finavon in Angus; Newdosk in Kincardineshire; Cambo in Fife; and possibly also Balindoch and Earl's Ruthven in Perthshire and Inverarity and Ethiebeton in Angus, lands which were certainly in David's possession before his death. By 1381 he also held nominal title to the barony of Strathnairn, Inverness-shire, which may have constituted the dowry of his wife, Elizabeth Stewart, a daughter of King Robert II. The date of their marriage is unknown, though a papal dispensation for it was granted on 22 February 1375. It underlines the extent to which the Lindsays, already influential under David II, were able to consolidate their position in the reign of Robert II. In 1381/2 the income from Strathnairn was granted by the crown to Elizabeth's brother Alexander, earl of Buchan, but Lindsay was compensated from the customs revenues of Dundee.<br>
<br>Lindsay's income from paternal and perhaps marital sources was substantially augmented following the deaths first of his cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16700/', "Sir James Lindsay of Crawford")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54260/', "Lindsay family (per. c.1250&#150;c.1400)")</script>] between 5 April 1395 and 6 March 1396, and then of his brother, Alexander, between June 1397 and May 1398. From James, in accordance with the terms of an entail confirmed by Robert II in 1384 or 1385, Sir David acquired Crawford in Lanarkshire and Kirkmichael and perhaps also Ewesdale, both in Dumfriesshire. From his brother he probably obtained Baltrody in Perthshire and Downie in Angus, which had both belonged to his father; Alyth in Perthshire, which had previously belonged to his cousin; and Urie in Kincardineshire, which Alexander had obtained in 1390. These multifariously acquired lands and pensions were to form the basis of the earldom of Crawford, to which Sir David was elevated on 21 April 1398. In subsequent years further lands and pensions were to come his way. In 1403 he acquired Megginch in Perthshire and Clova in Angus from the countess of Mar, and the following year William Megill resigned his Perthshire barony of Meigle to the earl. At an unknown date he also obtained Kineff in Kincardineshire, which, although regranted to his half-brother Walter, reverted to the comital line on the death of Walter's son Walter some time after 1438. While the income from the earl's lands remains unquantifiable, annuities which he drew from various towns ensured that he was a wealthy man. These included &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>., drawn from the Aberdeen customs, in return for service to David, duke of Rothesay, from 1391/2; a further &pound;44 8<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>., drawn from the Dundee customs, inherited from his cousin James from 1396/7, which rose to &pound;66 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. from 1403/4, following the death of the latter's wife; and &pound;26 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. from 1397/8, drawn from the Montrose customs.<h2>
<a name="Domesticandforeignaffairs"></a>Domestic and foreign affairs</h2>As the leading magnate in north-east Scotland and also, it would seem, a responsible and diligent nobleman, David Lindsay played a prominent part in regional and local politics. He worked in collaboration with the dukes of both Rothesay (of whose council he was a member) and Albany, guardians of the realm for most of the period between 1388 and 1420, to curtail the recalcitrant earl of Buchan's influence. In 1391 he participated in the highland campaign led by Albany which was directed against Buchan. On or about 18 January 1392 he took part in a skirmish at either Glen Brerachan or Glasclune; his adversaries are variously reported as Buchan's illegitimate sons and members of clan Donnchaidh. During this encounter Walter Ogilvy, sheriff of Angus, was killed and Lindsay was wounded. Further encounters with highland caterans and Buchan's family were to follow. Lindsay was involved in arranging the famous judicial combat between members of clan Quhele and clan Kay which was staged before King Robert III at Perth on 28 September 1396. His promotion to the rank of earl in 1398 should probably be regarded as part of the crown's programme of strengthening its position in the north at this time. By November 1400 he had aligned himself with the Erskine family in its claim to the earldom of Mar, advanced in anticipation of the death of Countess Isabella. In 1402, following the death of Isabella's second husband, Sir Malcolm Drummond, Crawford became a member of the countess's council, but his plans for an Erskine succession were thwarted two years later by Isabella's unexpected third marriage to Buchan's son Alexander. Crawford was, however, instrumental in brokering a deal between the new earl and Erskine's principal supporter, Albany, at Kildrummy on 1 December 1404, which left Alexander in possession of Mar for life.<br>
<br>Well before he became an earl Lindsay had acquired an international reputation, one secured during a visit in 1390 to London, where on 4 or 6 May he defeated Lord Welles in a tournament, to be rewarded with gifts from Richard II. Chivalric interests and a family tradition of crusading probably explain why he and his brother, Alexander, enrolled in the order of the Passion, a crusading order established by Philippe de M&eacute;zi&egrave;res in 1395, though neither is known to have engaged the infidel. Instead Lindsay became increasingly involved in governmental matters. Although he was appointed deputy chamberlain north of the Forth in 1405, his chief responsibility concerned foreign affairs. In March 1394 he was named a conservator of the Anglo-Scottish truce and he participated in further Anglo-Scottish truce negotiations between 1397 and 1400. Probably in 1401 and certainly by 1403 he had been made admiral. In December 1401, in the hope of winning French military assistance for Scottish campaigns against England, Crawford arrived in Paris, apparently spreading the falsehood that the by now deposed Richard II was alive and well in Scotland, and on 3 January 1402 he entered the service of Louis, duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, the leader of the French war party. By 22 March Crawford was at Harfleur, in command of a predominantly French fleet, which in the subsequent four months captured at least twenty-five English merchant vessels in the channel. Some of the spoils were taken to Corunna in Spain, where Crawford donated an anchor and a boat to Jean de B&eacute;thencourt, seigneur de Grainville, in furtherance of the latter's attempt to conquer the Canary Islands. As the fleet reached Scotland only late in July, Crawford was absent during the time of the removal from power and subsequent death of Rothesay, his former patron, though his half-brother Sir William Lindsay of Rossie had been one of the duke's captors. Nor is he recorded as having fought at Homildon Hill on 14 September following.<h2>
<a name="Politicaldoldrums"></a>Political doldrums</h2>Crawford died in 1407, probably in February, and was reportedly buried in the Franciscan church in Dundee. He was succeeded by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_54266"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Lindsay</span>, second earl of Crawford  (<em>d.</em> 1438/9)<span class="occ"></span>, who was much less prominent in public life than his father. In part this was the result of two spells in captivity, in 1406&#150;7 as a hostage for the fourth earl of Douglas and in 1424&#150;7 as a hostage for James I. In 1407 Henry IV of England granted him a safe conduct for travel to Amiens, an early indication of a long-standing family devotion to St John the Baptist, whose head was venerated there. He received a safe conduct for travel to England in 1416 and again in 1421, when he was one of the commissioners appointed to negotiate the release of James I from English captivity. In December of the same year he arranged a male entail for the Crawford lands. In 1424 he met James at Durham with hostages for the king's release. Although Crawford is said to have been knighted at James's coronation on 21 May 1424, on 25 March he had taken oath as a hostage for the king, his own ransom set at 1000 merks. During this second period of captivity he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, York, and finally Pontefract. Two years after his release in 1427 he endowed a chaplaincy in the parish church of Dundee with an annual grant of 12 merks. He received another safe conduct in January 1430, to meet English envoys at Hawdenstank, and in January 1431 he was again nominated as an ambassador to England. In 1438 he was appointed a commissioner of the Anglo-Scottish truce. Little else is known of Crawford, but he was said to have been active in the capture of James I's assassins. He and his wife Marjory, whose identity is unrecorded, had five sons and two daughters. When the second earl died, between 31 March 1438 and 8 September 1439, he was succeeded by his eldest son, David.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_54267"></a><span class="headword">David Lindsay</span>, third earl of Crawford  (<em>d.</em> 1446)<span class="occ"></span>, had been knighted by 17 September 1425 and witnessed a royal charter as earl on 1 February 1440. During the minority of James II he was associated politically with the Douglas family and he was among those who ravaged the lands of James Kennedy, bishop of St Andrews, in 1445. As a result he was excommunicated; according to a later source, this did not bother him greatly. He died at Finavon Castle on 17 January 1446, having been mortally wounded while attempting to prevent a battle at Arbroath between Lindsay kinsmen and the Ogilvy family, to which his wife, Marjory, belonged. Friction between the two families had arisen after the earl's son Alexander was replaced as justiciar of Arbroath Abbey by Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity. Countess Marjory, the daughter of Alexander Ogilvy of Auchterhouse, outlived her husband and endowed a mass on his behalf in the Franciscan church at Dundee. Later chroniclers stated that she smothered her wounded cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20590/', "Alexander Ogilvy")</script> as revenge for the death of her husband. He had died excommunicate and was not buried until his erstwhile foe Bishop Kennedy lifted the sentence. The couple had two sons, of whom the elder, Alexander, succeeded as fourth earl. The younger, Walter of the Aird and Beaufort, Inverness-shire, possessed estates at Edzell and Kynblethmont in Angus. They also had at least one daughter, Johanna, who married Sir Alexander Seton of Tullibody.<h2>
<a name="Thetigerearl"></a>The tiger earl</h2>
<a name="cosubject_16678"></a><span class="headword">Alexander Lindsay</span>, fourth earl of Crawford  (<em>d.</em> 1453)<span class="occ"></span>, who had been knighted during his father's lifetime, was nicknamed both the Tiger (because of his fierce character) and Beardie (for obvious facial reasons). He had been appointed sheriff of Aberdeenshire by 1450 and as an envoy to England and commissioner of the truce the following year. From 1453 he was also a guardian of the march. Despite his border interests he was also active in the north-east, and probably in the early 1450s entered into a bond with the eighth earl of Douglas and John Macdonald, lord of the Isles. Its terms do not survive, but it was most likely intended to resolve tensions in the region while securing the interests of the subscribers. This alliance of three of the most powerful magnates in the kingdom aroused the suspicion of James II, however, and was the immediate cause of his slaying of Douglas on 22 February 1452. Shortly afterwards, on 18 May, Crawford was defeated by the earl of Huntly at Brechin and fled to Finavon. Although Huntly is said to have &#145;displayit the kingis banere&#146;  (McGladdery, 173), the battle may have been as much an extension of a private feud (Huntly had been involved in the hostilities at Arbroath in which Crawford's father was fatally wounded) as a consequence of James's hostility to Crawford. Crawford was forfeited in the parliament which assembled at Edinburgh on 12 June, but he subsequently reconciled his differences with Huntly and his father's foe Bishop Kennedy and, helped by their intercession on his behalf, had been restored to the king's favour by 23 May 1453, when he was made a conservator of a truce with England.<br>
<br>Crawford married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1498&times;1500), daughter and heir of Sir David Dunbar. James II had granted the lands of Auchtermonzie and Cairnie to Dunbar. These estates passed to Margaret and then to her second son, also named Alexander, who ultimately became seventh earl of Crawford. The fourth earl's other children included a daughter, Elizabeth (who married John, first Lord Drummond), and an illegitimate son, yet another Alexander, who became rector of Belhelvie and a canon of Aberdeen Cathedral. The earl died in September 1453 and was buried at the Greyfriars church in Dundee, the resting place of his predecessors. After his death Margaret married Sir William Wallace of Craigie.<h2>
<a name="Earlandduke"></a>Earl and duke</h2>The fourth earl's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_16690"></a><span class="headword">David Lindsay</span>, fifth earl of Crawford and duke of Montrose  (1440&#150;1495)<span class="occ"></span>, was still a minor at the time of his father's death. His great-uncle Walter, the third earl's brother, was appointed as his tutor and also acted, along with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54270/', "John Lindsay, Lord Lindsay of the Byres")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54268/', "Lindsay family of the Byres")</script>], as sheriff of Aberdeenshire. David's ward and marriage were granted to James, Lord Hamilton, in 1459. Perhaps aged about eighteen, David married Hamilton's daughter, Elizabeth. His minority came to an end in 1462. In January 1464 he granted his mother the barony of Kirkmichael for life and in 1466 he became hereditary sheriff of Angus, following the resignation from that position of Alexander Ogilvy of Auchterhouse, nephew of the third earl's wife.<br>
<br>Politically the fifth earl was closely associated with James III. He may have been in England on diplomatic business in 1466, when members of the Boyd family abducted the king. He remained aloof from the Boyd regime and in 1469 headed the assize which sentenced Sir Alexander Boyd to death for his role in the royal kidnapping. Thereafter he was a regular witness of royal charters and frequently attended parliament. The earl's attachment to James III was further demonstrated by his endowment in 1474 of a perpetual chaplaincy for the king's soul, and that of Queen Margaret, at the church of Meigle. By then the king had already shown him considerable favour. In 1473 he was granted the lordship of Brechin and made keeper of Berwick, a position which he held for three years. In 1474 he was involved in the unsuccessful negotiations for the king's marriage to Cecilia, daughter of Edward IV of England. By 1482 Crawford was master of the royal household and the following year he was appointed royal chamberlain and, together with the second earl of Huntly, justiciar of the north. Loyal service to the crown was rewarded on 18 May 1488, when he was created duke of Montrose. This was the first instance of ducal rank accorded to a man who was not a member of the royal family and it was accompanied by the award of additional lands, including the castle and burgh of Montrose and the lordship of Kinclaven in Perthshire, to be held in full regality. The new duke's fortunes declined temporarily after the defeat of James III at the battle of Sauchieburn on 11 June; he was imprisoned and removed from public office, resigning the sheriffdom of Angus. He was not, however, charged with treason and was soon pardoned by the new king, James IV. His ducal title was confirmed, but only for life, by royal charter of 19 September 1489. Appointment to the privy council in 1490 appeared to confirm his rehabilitation.<br>
<br>Crawford and his first wife, Elizabeth, who was the only child of James, first Lord Hamilton, and his first wife, Euphemia, daughter of Patrick Graham, earl of Strathearn, had four children. The elder son, Alexander, quarrelled with and was killed by the younger son, John (<i>d</i>. 1513), who succeeded as sixth earl. One daughter, Margaret, was married to John Blair of Balmyle, while the other, Elizabeth, married David Lyon of Baky. By 1484 the earl's first marriage had been dissolved on the grounds of consanguinity, and he then married Margaret Carmichael of Meadowflat, who was later styled duchess of Montrose. In 1488 she was granted the lands of Cockburn in Berwickshire, previously held by James III's brother Alexander, duke of Albany. The duke of Montrose died at Finavon Castle on Christmas day 1495 and was buried in the church of the Dundee Greyfriars. The dowager duchess later endowed a mass for her husband's soul at Brechin Cathedral; she died in 1534.<br>
