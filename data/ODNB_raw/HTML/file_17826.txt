<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Maitland,  John</span>, first Lord Maitland of Thirlestane  (1543&#150;1595), <span class="occ">lord chancellor of Scotland</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17831/', "Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington (1496&#150;1586)")</script> and Mary or Mariota Cranstoun (<i>d</i>. 1586); his older brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17838/', "William Maitland of Lethington (1525x30&#150;1573)")</script>, one of the most powerful politicians in Scotland while he held the office of secretary between 1558 and 1571. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68146/', "Mary Maitland")</script> was his sister. Like his father and brother, Maitland was trained in the law. He probably attended Haddington grammar school; he is listed on the rolls of St Salvator's College of the University of St Andrews for the year 1555. Thereafter he completed his education in France; it is not known when he went or for how long he stayed. In 1563 Queen Mary made him joint factor, with his father, of the lands of the Cistercian nunnery of Haddington. In 1567 he became, quite suddenly, a person of importance. In February of that year he became commendator of the priory of Coldingham through a collusive arrangement by which Francis Stewart, the nephew of Mary's all-powerful favourite, James Hepburn, fourth earl of Bothwell, became commendator of the much richer abbey of Kelso. Two months later he became lord privy seal when his father resigned that office in his favour.<h2>
<a name="Hisbrothersman"></a>His brother's man</h2>The keeper of the privy seal was not a powerful official, nor was there much to do: Sir Richard Maitland had held the office for almost five years although he was blind. Secretary Maitland undoubtedly arranged the transfer: he needed an active political supporter, and John Maitland was exactly that, following his brother loyally until the end came for William in 1573. Like William, John Maitland joined the ranks of the queen's opponents in 1567, and was confirmed in his office by the Regent Moray on 26 August, four days after Moray's assumption of the regency. A year later, in June 1568, he became a member of the court of session. Like William, John broke with Moray over Mary's request for a divorce from Bothwell; they were among the few who voted for the divorce at the convention of estates of August 1569. When the fighting between the supporters of the queen and those of the young James VI began in 1570, an English army seized Coldingham. In May 1571 the Regent Lennox's parliament forfeited the Maitland brothers; the privy seal was bestowed on the king's tutor, the famous humanist George Buchanan. The brothers took refuge in Edinburgh Castle, which surrendered to a combined Anglo-Scottish force on 28 May 1573. Sir William Drury, the English commander, took charge of the important prisoners, including the Maitlands. William died within two weeks, possibly a suicide. John was turned over to the Regent Morton, who kept him for a time in his grim fortress at Tantallon. Fortunately for John, Morton did not regard him as worth hanging. In February 1574 the regent permitted him to live with his cousin Lord Somerville at Cowthally, at the western end of the Pentland Hills, under what amounted to house arrest. He did not regain his liberty until 15 September 1578, several months after a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> put an end to Morton's regency.<br>
<br>John Maitland's policies and behaviour during his years of power indicate that he had absorbed the lessons of his brother's spectacular and tragic career. Like William he was a <i>politique</i>, but he came to understand that William had seriously underestimated the extent to which religious passion determined people's political conduct and, in consequence, the political influence of the spokesmen of the kirk. Making good the Stewart claim to the English succession became William's primary political purpose from the time of Queen Mary's return to Scotland in 1561. He failed to see that in a religious age Anglo-Scottish union could come about only on the basis of a common religion, and so he backed Mary to the end in spite of her Catholicism, which made her unacceptable to the English establishment and, as time went on, to more and more Scots as well. The succession question did not obsess John Maitland, though of course he supported the claims of his master, King James, whom it did obsess. Good relations with England were very important to him, but for domestic political reasons, rather than on account of the succession. Finally, Maitland did not share his brother's, and their father's, view that the upper aristocracy was the only class that counted for anything in Scotland. For him the upper aristocracy was part of the political problem, not the indispensable element in the solution.<h2>
<a name="Risetopower"></a>Rise to power</h2>John Maitland's rise to power began with the arrival in Scotland of Esm&eacute; Stuart in September 1579. Esm&eacute; quickly became a favourite of his cousin the king, who made him first duke of Lennox. In 1580 Lennox brought Maitland and other supporters of the fallen queen to court. James always valued such men for their loyalty to his mother, provided they transferred their loyalty to himself, and he came to like and trust Maitland, who, like James, was a poet of modest talents. On 17 February 1581 Maitland was formally rehabilitated; in April he resumed his seat on the court of session. He survived the fall of Lennox in 1582, though the ultra-protestant Ruthven raiders drove him from the king's presence. In January 1583, at the age of thirty-nine, he married Jane Fleming (1554&#150;1609), daughter of James, fourth Lord Fleming, and the niece of his brother William's wife. Jane Fleming's mother was a sister of Lord John Hamilton, the effective head of that great family, an important political connection for Maitland. Two children were born of the marriage: John, born in 1594, who ultimately became first earl of Lauderdale, and Anne, born in 1590, whose husband, Robert Seton, second earl of Winton, whom she married at thirteen, went mad on their wedding night. Anne died six years later, still a virgin.<br>
<br>With the fall of the Ruthven raiders and the rise to power of James Stewart, fourth earl of Arran, in the summer of 1583, Maitland returned to court. He became a privy councillor in August, and a regular attendant at the council's meetings. Arran had his suspicions about Maitland, who supported a proposal to allow Lord John Hamilton to return from exile: Arran held the Hamilton earldom. But shortly after the suppression of an attempted coup in April 1584 Maitland was knighted and provided with the opportunity to exercise real power, in the future if not now, by being made secretary. Parliament confirmed the grant in May, and at the same time annulled Maitland's forfeiture and restored him to all his honours and estates, save Coldingham. At this parliament Maitland helped to draft the Erastian church legislation known as the <span class="roman">Black Acts</span>, which explicitly approved episcopacy and the crown's jurisdiction over all persons and all cases; to deny that jurisdiction, as some ministers had done, was declared to be treasonable. Several ministers refused to accept the acts of 1584. Maitland helped to devise a formula that split the clerical opposition: the clergy would obey the laws in so far as they agreed with the word of God. Maitland also became a member of a commission to adjust ministers' stipends: the carrot for the clerical donkey. The clerical extremists bitterly denounced him in a libel &#145;wherein Justice is brought in lamenting, that one of Cameleon's clan, one of the disciples of Matchiavell, had so great place in the commonwealth, to the ruin of justice&#146;  (Calderwood, 4.349). Another commission on which Maitland served was charged with reforming the court of session, in other words, with replacing politically unreliable members. Maitland thereupon began the process of placing his political allies on the court, which was a matter of great importance for the future.<br>
<br>Maitland also began to try to undermine the seemingly all-powerful Arran, whose violence and greed had never appealed to him. He was not sufficiently well connected and influential to accomplish this by himself, so he became a supporter of Patrick, master of Gray, an ambitious and attractive young man in whom King James was showing a marked interest. James sent Gray to London in the autumn of 1584 to discuss, among other things, a possible Anglo-Scottish league; while he was there Gray persuaded Elizabeth's officials, who disliked Arran, to provide underhand support for his schemes against the favourite. The ensuing intrigue was enormously complicated, one of the complications being the negotiations for the league, in which Maitland as secretary was deeply involved. In the end Gray achieved complete success. He undermined James's confidence in Arran, and leached away the latter's support among the people who counted, so that when the conspirators struck in November 1585 Arran could offer no resistance. He lost his title, his offices, and the property he had accumulated during his two years of power and faded into obscurity.<br>
<br>The overthrow of Arran marked the beginning of the personal rule of James VI, now aged nineteen. It also marked the beginning of Maitland's years of power. His office gave him constant access to the king; he was diligent and capable; English officialdom thought well of him&#151;the English ambassador Sir Edward Wotton, with whom Maitland was negotiating over the proposed league, called him &#145;the wisest man in Scotland&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1584&#150;5</i>, 681&#150;2). The grant of the keepership of the great seal for life, with the title of vice-chancellor, on 31 May 1586 was an indication of his growing influence and importance. He also received a pension of &pound;1000 Scots. His one dangerous political rival, Gray, was ruined by his involvement in the negotiations preceding the execution of Queen Mary in 1587. From 1587 to 1592 Maitland was the king's chief minister and political tutor, the most powerful man in Scotland after the king.<h2>
<a name="Strengtheningthemonarchy"></a>Strengthening the monarchy</h2>That Maitland had an agenda quickly became evident. As early as April 1586 Archibald Douglas, one of his enemies, wrote to Walsingham that the Scottish secretary's &#145;greatness with the king did consist in this, that he had set down certain platts unto the king, how he might preserve his state in obedience&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1585&#150;6</i>, 346&#150;7). At first Maitland moved a little uncertainly. He realized, however, that a further clarification of relations between crown and kirk was necessary, and helped to work out an acceptable compromise which acknowledged the pre-eminence of the general assembly and the legality of the recently established system of presbyteries. In return the kirk accepted the existence of the office of bishop and the crown's view that the kirk's jurisdictional authority was limited to matters of doctrine, discipline, and religious offences such as blasphemy and sexual misbehaviour; it did not embrace politics. But it was clear throughout the negotiations, which lasted until May 1586, that Maitland was still very uneasy about the kirk's power and influence. The same uneasiness and uncertainty influenced his attitude during the negotiations for the league with England, which concluded in July 1586. Maitland supported the alliance in principle, but he believed that the English offer was inadequate, and saw no reason to hurry the negotiations to a conclusion. The young king overruled him, however, and agreed to the English terms, after Elizabeth wrote a letter agreeing to do nothing in derogation of James's claim to the succession without just cause. Maitland became even more acutely aware that the succession was uppermost in the king's mind from his reaction to the disclosure of the Babington plot in August 1586, followed, six months later, by the execution of his mother. Maitland prudently avoided involvement in this business. At one point, in November 1586, he did persuade James to threaten to break the league if Mary's life were taken. Elizabeth exploded with rage, and James reverted to his acquiescent stance, which Elizabeth helped him to maintain by ostentatiously denying responsibility for Mary's death and making Secretary William Davison her scapegoat.<br>
<br>The execution of their former queen outraged large numbers of Scots, who put pressure on the king to retaliate in some way. The leadership of the kirk, which did not in the least regret Mary's death, was very helpful in enabling James to resist this pressure and preserve the English alliance. By the middle of 1587 Maitland saw how existing circumstances could be turned to the crown's advantage. The league had turned the English government into a supporter of royal authority instead of a threat to it. The large moderate party in the kirk was supportive also, provided that the king withdrew his favour from the detested Archbishop Patrick Adamson of St Andrews, which James was prepared to do. There remained the upper aristocracy. Although the nobles constituted a group that would follow a decisive royal leader who shared their outlook, Maitland believed that the authority of the crown should not depend upon the uncertain goodwill of this class. So he set out to lessen its power by creating a central government independent of these men, responsible to, and responsive to, the king and only the king. The institution through which Maitland worked was the privy council, which gradually filled with his administrative and judicial colleagues, upon whom he could usually rely for political support.<h2>
<a name="Reforminglegislation"></a>Reforming legislation</h2>The legislation of the parliament of 1587 embodied Maitland's and James's vision in a series of important enactments. The act of James I (1428) authorizing the lairds to elect representatives to parliament, hitherto a dead letter, was revived: Maitland, himself a laird, counted on this class for support. The annexation of the temporalities of benefices to the crown put a great deal of land at the crown's disposal. James used it to reward both the men who comprised the new class of government servants&#151;lairds, lawyers, cadets of aristocratic families, whom Maitland recruited&#151;and those members of the upper aristocracy who were prepared to support Maitland's regime. The revival of justice ayres and the appointment of local gentry to hold quarter sessions on the English model to handle minor crimes, though not very successful, and the expansion of the government's right to prosecute criminal cases, were efforts to eat into the near monopoly of criminal justice enjoyed by the lords of regality. The revival of the general band made landlords responsible for the production in court of any accused resident of their lands; their property was subject to seizure if they failed to meet their obligations. An effort was made, with some success, to meet some of the complaints of the burghs. All these measures were designed to strengthen the crown by creating a <i>noblesse de robe</i> and chipping away at the independent power of the magnates&#151;in the phrase of the English ambassador William Ashby in October 1588, to &#145;bridle the earls&#146; with the support of the lairds and burghs  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1586&#150;9</i>, 623&#150;4)&#151;and of the kirk. At the end of the parliament, on 29 July, James raised Maitland to the chancellorship.<br>
<br>These measures met with varying degrees of success. The electoral machinery of the act reintroducing the lairds to parliament, which specified an annual election of representatives whether or not parliament met, was too complicated and did not function well. Its main purpose, however, was not to revivify parliament, which did not meet during the years of Maitland's greatest power, but rather to bring the lairds into contact with government and alliance with it. In this respect it resembled the acts reorganizing criminal justice, which also worked less than perfectly. The annexation of church lands, however, accomplished what Maitland had intended. The kirk, although it complained that it gained little financially, saw the act as a death knell for episcopacy as a system of church government, and became Maitland's ally&#151;&#145;he kept true and honest till the day of his death&#146;, wrote James Melville, one of King James's severest critics  (<span class="italic">Autobiography and Diary</span>, 271). James later denounced the act because it limited his ability to restore the authority of bishops, but during Maitland's years of power he used it effectively to reward political supporters and build a <i>noblesse de robe</i>. Maitland himself received the lordship of Musselburgh, which belonged to the abbey of Dunfermline. The policy of the general band also worked effectively, especially on the borders, where it was combined with crackdowns on recalcitrant landlords like Lord Maxwell and co-operation with English officials to bring border reivers to justice.<h2>
<a name="Backlash"></a>Backlash</h2>The thrust of James's and Maitland's policy was clear enough to the upper aristocracy, and Maitland was held responsible for it. &#145;All matters whatsoever, both domestic and foreign, rests [<i>sic</i>] only upon the chancellor's shoulders&#146;, wrote one observer in September 1587  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 1583&#150;9, 282&#150;3). Inevitably Maitland and his policy provoked resentment. Many aristocrats bitterly hated him, not only for what he planned to do but also for who he was, an upstart and a parvenu&#151;&#145;a puddock-stool of a night&#146;, in the phrase of his greatest enemy, Francis Stewart, earl of Bothwell  (Calderwood, 5.156). His appointment as lord chancellor offended the most aristocratic of his administrative colleagues, Treasurer Thomas Lyon, the master of Glamis, whose brother had been chancellor and who wanted the office for himself&#151;Maitland was the first chancellor who was neither an aristocrat nor a bishop since the reign of James II. The Catholic earls, led by George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly, one of James's favourites, also disliked Maitland because of his alliance with the kirk. In the autumn of 1588 they planned to assassinate him, or so Maitland was told. In 1589, following the revelation of Huntly's correspondence with Spain, Maitland, by threatening to resign, persuaded James to remove Huntly as captain of the guard. Huntly, together with the other Catholic earls and Bothwell, now planned to seize the king and compel him to dismiss Maitland, who, said Bothwell in a flamboyant speech, was in English pay and was arranging for an English army to enter Scotland, overthrow the nobility, and reduce Scotland to slavery.<br>
<br>The coup misfired and led to a rebellion on Huntly's part which James easily put down. The king, who believed in showing a certain amount of favour to the Catholics so as to forestall Catholic opposition to his succession to the English throne, punished no one very severely. He was about to get married, and was determined that no domestic broils mar his bride's arrival. When he decided in October 1589 to go to Denmark to fetch Anne home himself, he took Maitland with him, partly to ensure Maitland's safety. He left behind a remarkable proclamation denying the truth of the general assumption that Maitland was &#145;leading me, by the nose as it were, to all his appetites, as if I were an unreasonable creature, or a bairn that could do nothing of myself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 4.428&#150;9).<br>
<br>The royal party landed in Norway in October, James was married in November, and went on to Denmark in December, where he remained until spring, enjoying his holiday, meeting with Tycho Brahe, to whom Maitland wrote two Latin epigrams, and holding political discussions with Maitland. Rumours abounded concerning these discussions: Maitland would have the nobility barred from the privy council and not permitted to come to court except on summons. These were canards; what was genuine was a quarrel between the Earl Marischal, James's ambassador to Denmark, and Maitland, which James settled in Maitland's favour. Furthermore, Maitland was unwilling to pay Marischal's (and others') expenses out of Queen Anne's dowry, though he accepted part of a cupboard of plate to cover his own. When the royal party returned to Scotland, and Anne was crowned on 19 May 1590, James raised him to the peerage as Lord Maitland of Thirlestane, the only person so honoured. His colleague the lord treasurer received no more than a knighthood, which further irritated him. Maitland was becoming dangerously isolated, and dangerously unpopular.<br>
<br>As long as Maitland enjoyed James's wholehearted support, however, he was secure enough. He was now at the peak of his influence with the king. He used his position to create a special committee to enforce the policy of the general band in both the highlands and the borders, and to improve the procedure for filling vacancies on the court of session by requiring that the judges examine the qualifications of any nominee before the king formally made the appointment. He also undertook some financial retrenchment. His measures, which included husbanding the queen's dowry, raised a host of new enemies for Maitland among the courtiers. Queen Anne herself turned hostile: James had given her the temporalities of the abbey of Dunfermline, and she wanted them all, including Maitland's lordship of Musselburgh, which was not part of the gift. The allegation in April 1591 that Bothwell had been consorting with witches turned James permanently against the earl, who blamed Maitland, quite unjustly, for the king's implacability. Bothwell was imprisoned, escaped, evaded capture, and on 27 December 1591, with the aid of some disgruntled courtiers, entered Holyroodhouse itself in order to seize the king and kill Maitland. He failed, narrowly. Two months later Huntly, toward whom Maitland had been making friendly gestures, murdered James Stewart, second earl of Moray, who was his rival for local influence in north-eastern Scotland. Maitland was blamed for this by all those who wanted Huntly punished, notably the Stewart family, the kirk, and the English government. Huntly's enemies attributed James's inaction to Maitland rather than to its real cause, James's obsessive hatred of Bothwell, who was, in the king's view, a far more dangerous offender than Huntly. The political pressure became so great that on 30 March 1592 James ordered Maitland to leave the court. His great days were over.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>The last three and a half years of Maitland's life were anticlimactic. He was able to persuade the king to use the parliament of May 1592 to give legal recognition to the existing presbyterian structure of the kirk and repeal the act of 1584 that gave administrative jurisdiction to bishops. This legislation followed logically from Maitland's previous policy toward the kirk. Presbyterian commentators, while giving him credit, declared that his purpose was &#145;to win the hearts of the ministers and people, alienated from him for his hounding out of Huntly against the earl of Moray&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.162), which does Maitland less than justice. It was, in fact, his last act of constructive statesmanship.<br>
<br>During his final years Maitland spent much time at Lethington, and then at his new house, Thirlestane Castle, in Lauder, which was finished in the year of his death. The king often rode out to consult him, and he returned frequently to court, where he manoeuvred among the various factions in order to recover his political footing. In September 1592 James appointed him ambassador to France, partly for his own safety: he was in real danger from Bothwell. He never went; he decided that, if he left, he was likely to lose his offices and property. As it was, he surrendered Musselburgh to the queen in July 1593 to recover her favour. The most significant development of these years was that the administrative machine Maitland and James had built withstood the attacks made on Maitland by Bothwell and the Catholic earls, whose dealings with Spain came to light with the discovery of the so-called Spanish blanks in December 1592. By 1595, after many vicissitudes, Huntly, Erroll, and Bothwell were all driven into exile; Bothwell would never return. This was a milestone: never again would a handful of disgruntled aristocrats threaten royal authority. And the crown had won through without outside aid, apart from a little English money. Thanks to Maitland's work Scotland now had an administration as distinct from a congeries of aristocratic office-holders.<br>
<br>Maitland died on 3 October 1595 at Thirlestane Castle. &#145;He granted at his death&#146;, wrote Calderwood, &#145;that he had greatly offended that man of God, Mr. Knox; wished often that he had builded a hospital when he builded his castle at Lauder, and cried often for mercy.&#146; Nevertheless he was &#145;in a very good estate, as appeared, for a life to come&#146;  (Calderwood, 5.382). King James wrote a stiff and conventional sonnet of regret; when asked about a successor, he &#145;said he will well ken who [<i>sic</i>] he chooses for that place, adding that he can have none but in short time they will presume to be equal with himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Scot.</span>, <i>1595&#150;7</i>, 39&#150;41). James in fact had no more such equals; Maitland had not only created an administration but also trained his own successor, in the person of the king himself. The chancellor's portrait, of unknown date, hangs in Thirlestane Castle. His splendid tomb, with a recumbent effigy, is in St Mary's Church, Haddington.<br>
