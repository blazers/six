<span class="headword">Spence,  (James) Lewis Thomas Chalmers</span>  (1874&#150;1955), <span class="occ">poet and Scottish nationalist</span>, was born at Darlington Cottage, Seafield, Broughty Ferry, Forfarshire, on 25 November 1874, the eldest of four children of James Edward Kendall Spence, insurance agent and house proprietor, and his wife, Barbara Charlotte Chalmers. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26110/', "James Spence")</script>, professor of surgery at the University of Edinburgh. Other relatives included Thomas Chalmers, leader of the Free Church of Scotland, and James Spence, inventor of the adhesive postal stamp. Spence was educated at the collegiate school, Broughty Ferry, and privately at Ongar School, Essex, before studying dentistry at the University of Edinburgh, where he took his MA. He chose journalism as a career, and from 1899 to 1904 was a sub-editor on <span class="italic">The Scotsman</span>. On 25 November 1899 he married Helen (1876/7&#150;1942), daughter of George Bruce, cabinet-maker, of Edinburgh. They had a son and three daughters. He edited a short-lived <span class="italic">Edinburgh Magazine</span> before moving in 1906 to London to work for the <span class="italic">British Weekly</span> which, under William Robertson Nicoll, was a vehicle for the kailyard school of Scottish writing.<br>
<br>In 1909 Spence returned to Edinburgh to work as a freelance, as he would do for the rest of his life. He prospered best from feeding public taste for the occult and supernatural, with a special sideline on the lost continent of Atlantis. But he was also a genuine, scholarly expert on mythology and folklore, especially of Central and South America, and became a fellow of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. He wrote many books on these matters, notably <span class="italic">Myths and Legends of Mexico and Peru</span> (1913), <span class="italic">An Encyclopaedia of Occultism</span> (1920), <span class="italic">An Introduction to Mythology</span> (1923), and <span class="italic">The Magic Arts in Celtic Britain</span> (1945).<br>
<br>Poetry was less lucrative but more satisfying. After publishing two early, somewhat precious, volumes of verse Spence started composing in Scots. He was thus among the first to set about raising the modern language to the literary stature it had lost, by enriching it with archaic words and phrases. In doing so, he reacted against what he called the &#145;gutter Scots&#146; of some vernacular verse, such as Charles Murray's, which sought to echo the voice of the people in sub-Burnsian fashion. His borrowings from the past also extended to poetic forms such as sonnets or roundels, though his range of themes was conventional and generally limited to nature or mythology. He aimed at a magical quality, such as he thought to find in the English romantics and in Scottish ballads. The praises he sang to various suburbs of Edinburgh, &#145;Ae dawin, frae Corstorphine lea&#146;, &#145;The Fute Fa's Kind at Craigentinnie&#146;, &#145;Now June has hid Craigmillar's wa&#146;, did not always hit the elevated note he sought. Near the end of his life he brought out his <span class="italic">Collected Verse</span> (1953) and there&#151;though it by no means contained his whole output&#151;he let the English outnumber the Scots poems by two to one. His efforts had once been praised by Christopher Murray Grieve (Hugh MacDiarmid) for their exquisite sensory and intellectual quality. But bitter argument on art and politics afterwards destroyed the early friendship of the pair.<br>
<br>As a youth Spence had already become a member of the Scottish Home Rule Association and he wrote numerous articles or essays about its cause. Feeling, like other contemporary writers, the need for a deeper political commitment, he joined the Scots National League in the 1920s. It came together with three other bodies to form in 1926 the Scottish National Movement, of which he was elected president. In 1928 this in turn combined with remaining splinter groups into the National Party of Scotland, parent of the Scottish National Party. Spence became a vice-chairman. He was the first to try its strength at the hustings. As candidate in a four-cornered by-election in North Midlothian in January 1929, he polled 842 votes and lost his deposit. The party remained fissile. In 1932 Spence made a public avowal of his personal convictions, including unreserved loyalty to the crown. The consequence was a motion of censure on him in the party's national council, which he forestalled by resigning his post. He took the chance to denounce tendencies distasteful to him, the utopianism of the pan-Celticists round Compton Mackenzie and the socialist leanings, as he saw them, of adherents of the social credit propounded by Major C. H. Douglas. Before long he left the party altogether. He played no further role in politics, but devoted himself exclusively to writing. In later years he turned to short stories and plays, and also edited the <span class="italic">Atlantean Journal</span>.<br>
<br>Spence attached high importance to the revival of Scots poetry, but his own work seldom rose above an undemanding, often historical romanticism. He died on 3 March 1955 at his home, 34 Howard Place, Edinburgh.<br>
