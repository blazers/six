<span class="headword">McCluskie,  Samuel Joseph</span>  (1932&#150;1995), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born into a Roman Catholic family at 97 St Andrew Street, Leith, on 11 August 1932, son of James McCluskie, riveter and later barman, and his wife, Agnes McHenry. Sent to the local St Mary's primary school and to Holy Cross Academy, Edinburgh, he left without academic qualifications. &#145;I played truant because I hated school&#146;, he explained. &#145;We received corporal punishment for truancy so I decided the only way to avoid punishment was not to go back to school at all&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 18 Sept 1995). He began an apprenticeship with George Gibson of Leith, and worked in trawler engine rooms before doing his national service with the army (the navy found him &#145;too fat&#146;) and going to Korea. On demobilization, he spent a year &#145;mucking about in Japan&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 18 Sept 1995)&#151;a formative experience which bred a passionate belief in workers' co-operation, and co-operation with well-intentioned employers. He returned home to nine months' unemployment, before joining the Union Castle Line in 1955 as a ship's steward, soon becoming ship's chef instead. His travels were a political education: South African apartheid, Latin American right-wing dictatorships, and eastern bloc left-wing ones all earned his suspicion and dislike. On 29 September 1961 he married Alice Lowrie Fletcher, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Potter (<i>b</i>. 1925/6), a widowed bonded warehouse worker. They had a daughter and two sons, one of whom died young.<br>
<br>McCluskie was first spotted by the National Union of Seamen (NUS) in 1960 when he was involved in an unofficial strike. He was persuaded to become a branch delegate in 1963 after complaining about an increase in union dues, and in 1964 he became a land-based full-time official, living in Bo'ness, West Lothian, and representing Grangemouth and the east coast of Scotland. He spent some years as a branch secretary in ports around the country, from Plymouth, to Liverpool (where he consolidated his position during the strike of 1966), to Hull (where he spotted the young John Prescott), before arriving at Maritime House, Clapham, the union's headquarters, as a national organizer in 1969. Supported by Catholic moderates and soft left Tribunites, he made an early bid for the general secretaryship of the union in 1974, but was beaten by the hard left candidate, Jim Slater. He became assistant general secretary in 1976.<br>
<br>Baulked of the job he wanted, McCluskie threw himself into Labour Party politics, and won a seat on the party's national executive committee in the same year, which he kept until his death, also serving as treasurer (1984&#150;92). He was party chairman in 1983 at the nadir of the Labour Party's fortunes, and chaired the party conference in Brighton that year. Bullying, cajoling, charming the delegates by turn, with all the skills accumulated during interminable rough trade-union meetings, McCluskie played an important part in bringing the party back from the edge of oblivion. He was an authentic working-class leader, whose style was breezy, blunt, and unmalicious, although he could be blazingly angry, whereupon his language became both picturesque and unprintable.<br>
<br>In 1986 McCluskie achieved his old ambition, and was elected general secretary of the NUS. &#145;Sam the Man&#146; was a skilled fixer and classic operator in &#145;smoke-filled rooms&#146;; he was viewed by employers and arbitrators as a moderate, a man with whom business could be done, despite his public stance of unbending socialism and contempt for shipowners. Behind the scenes he sought to avoid confrontation with P. &amp; O. in 1988, but when the strike began, he took a high-profile role. The protracted and increasingly bitter strike began after 2000 members of the NUS in Belfast and Dover rejected new contracts and were served with dismissal notices. The British merchant shipping industry was in trouble, and the P. &amp; O. chairman, Sir Jeffrey Stirling (a friend of the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher), took advantage of the anti-union legislation of recent years to force a confrontation with the NUS. When McCluskie announced a ballot of his members for a national strike in support of the sacked men, a High Court judge ruled that the union's assets could be seized. McCluskie insisted on holding the ballot, a strike was called, and in May 1988 the union was fined heavily. The union's assets were sequestered, and it was evicted from Maritime House: McCluskie then conducted the strike from the Prince of Wales pub (which he called &#145;our annexe&#146;) opposite Maritime House. In July the threat of a second, heavier fine forced the NUS to withdraw support from its members' main picket at Dover, and the strike collapsed. Within two years, the financial state of the NUS and dwindling membership led the union into a merger with the National Union of Railwaymen. McCluskie served as executive officer of the amalgamated Rail, Maritime and Transport Union for a year (1990&#150;91) before he retired quietly, having suffered poor health for some time. He died from cancer in St Columba's Hospice, Edinburgh, on 15 September 1995, survived by his wife.<br>
