<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Shinwell,  Emanuel</span>, Baron Shinwell  (1884&#150;1986), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 18 October 1884 in Spitalfields, London, the eldest in a family of thirteen children of Samuel Shinwell, a clothing manufacturer of Polish-Jewish origin, and his Dutch wife, Rose Konigswinter. The family moved to Glasgow but Shinwell left school at the age of eleven to be apprenticed to the tailoring trade. He joined his first trade union, the Amalgamated Society of Clothing Operatives, at the age of seventeen and was elected to Glasgow Trades Council in 1906. He was to serve twice as its president. He became an early member of the Independent Labour Party and was an active socialist crusader. In 1911 he was prominent on the Clyde during the national dock strike.<br>
<br>Shinwell continued his militant union activities during the war and was wrongly alleged to have been involved in the disturbances in George Square, Glasgow, between striking workers and the police on Red Friday (31 January 1919). As a result, he spent over five months in Calton gaol, Edinburgh. He was now turning to thoughts of a political career. In the 1918 general election, he stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate for Linlithgow (West Lothian); in 1922 he was elected to parliament there.<br>
<br>Shinwell served as parliamentary secretary to the mines department in the first Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald in 1924. Defeated in the 1924 general election, he was re-elected in a by-election in 1928 and served in junior offices in the second Labour government, as financial secretary to the War Office in 1929&#150;30, and again in the mines department in 1930&#150;31. He had an immense admiration for MacDonald and tried in vain to persuade him not to head the National Government in August 1931. In the subsequent general election, Shinwell was defeated again.<br>
<br>Shinwell now decided to challenge MacDonald directly and in the 1935 general election handsomely defeated his old leader at Seaham Harbour. After a redistribution of seats, the constituency was later renamed Easington. Shinwell was always a pugnacious member of parliament. In 1938 he caused a sensation by striking a Conservative, Commander Robert Bower (as it happened, a former naval boxing champion), when the latter made a hostile interjection in debate. During the war years Shinwell was a vigorous, though always patriotic, critic of Winston Churchill's coalition government. He and the tory sixth Earl Winterton were popularly christened Arsenic and Old Lace. Shinwell was also prominent in Labour's policy making committees, notably those dealing with coal and energy.<br>
<br>When Labour won the 1945 general election, Attlee appointed Shinwell to the cabinet as minister of fuel and power. Here he achieved the nationalization of coal in 1946 and also negotiated the so-called miners' charter with the National Union of Mineworkers. He caused much controversy by declaring that the middle class was &#145;not worth a tinker's cuss&#146;. He served as chairman of the Labour Party in 1947&#150;8. However, his reputation slumped during the acute fuel crisis of January&#150;March 1947, at a time of an exceptionally severe winter. He was accused of complacency and failing to plan to deal with basic problems of coal production. That October, much to his chagrin, Shinwell was demoted by Attlee to the War Office, outside the cabinet. Hugh Gaitskell took his place and thereby earned Shinwell's undying enmity, reinforced by Gaitskell's public-school background. Shinwell was also attacked by younger men such as James Callaghan for being less than ardent over nationalization. However, Shinwell proved to be a vigorous war minister, in tune with army sentiment, and Attlee reappointed him to the cabinet in March 1950 as minister of defence. Here Shinwell dealt energetically with the emergency in Malaya and war in Korea. In the summer of 1951 he urged the cabinet to send British troops to protect the oil refineries at Abadan, which the Persian government had nationalized, but he was successfully resisted by other ministers.<br>
<br>After Labour fell from office in 1951, Shinwell lost ground. He was defeated in elections for the party national executive in 1952 and left the shadow cabinet in 1955. Gaitskell was elected party leader that year; Shinwell had backed his fellow veteran, Herbert Morrison. However, despite being in his seventies, he continued to play a lively role in politics. He changed his stance on nuclear weapons and campaigned against the stationing of American Polaris submarines at Holy Loch. The election of Harold Wilson as party leader after Gaitskell's death gave Shinwell new opportunities. Although now eighty, he was appointed by Wilson as chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party in October 1964, and worked hard to secure support for a government whose initial majority was only four. However, he came into conflict with ministers from 1966, especially with the equally aggressive foreign secretary, George Brown, since Shinwell was a vehement enemy of British entry into the European Common Market. He resigned as party chairman in 1967; in 1970 he became a life peer.<br>
<br>Shinwell's career was still far from over. He became chairman of the all-party Lords' defence study group. He voted against his own Labour government in 1976 and in March 1982 resigned the party whip in protest against left-wing militancy, though he remained a Labour Party member. He was now a legendary figure, and his hundredth birthday was celebrated in the House of Lords in 1984 (during a national miners' strike) with considerable enthusiasm.<br>
<br>With his stocky figure and Glaswegian accent, Manny Shinwell was pugnacious in parliament and on the platform. Appropriately, his enthusiasms included professional boxing. Though not religious, he was also much involved with the Jewish community. His performance in office was marred by the 1947 fuel crisis, while as a service minister he showed a jingoism some thought inappropriate. However, he had the gift of striking up friendships across the spectrum, including with the first Viscount Montgomery of Alamein and the editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>, Sir John Junor. He was kindly towards the young. He was a major personality over sixty years, and a notable pioneer in Labour's long march to power in 1945. He wrote several autobiographical works, of which <span class="italic">Conflict without Malice</span> (1955) is the most important. He was married (and widowed) three times. In 1903 he married Fay (Fanny) Freeman (<i>d</i>. 1954); they had two sons and a daughter. In 1956 he married Dinah (<i>d</i>. 1971), daughter of Carol Ludwig Meyer, of Denmark. In 1972 he married Sarah, former wife of Alfred Hurst and daughter of Solomon Stungo. She died in 1977. Shinwell himself died on 8 May 1986 at the age of 101, at his St John's Wood flat in London, and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
