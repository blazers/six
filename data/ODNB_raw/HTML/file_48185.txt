<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Robinson, Sir  (Edward) Stanley Gotch</span>  (1887&#150;1976), <span class="occ">numismatist</span>, was born on 4 July 1887 at 23 Westfield Park, Clifton, Bristol, the sixth of the seven children of Edward Robinson, paper merchant, and his wife, Katherine Frances, the daughter of the Revd Dr Gotch. He was born into a large and well-established Baptist, Bristol family, whose fortune was founded on paper manufacture. Of a gentle and retiring nature, Robinson developed an early stammer: he was consequently sent to London to stay in the house of a speech therapist, E. J. Seltman, who was by chance also a dealer in coins. Thereafter, Robinson attended Clifton College before winning a scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1906. At Oxford his formative academic influences were Professor Percy Gardner and his college Greek history tutor, Robin Dundas. Robinson won firsts in moderations and in Greats in 1910, and then visited Greece, staying at the British School in Athens. In 1911 he travelled for some months on horseback in Lycia, Turkey, and his diary from this time survives. This experience fitted him well to take up the post of assistant keeper in the department of coins and medals at the British Museum in June 1912, but his life's work there was soon interrupted by the outbreak of war. He joined the Northamptonshire regiment in 1914 and served in France in 1915&#150;16, until he was incapacitated by a very severe leg wound. This put a stop to the riding and dancing of his youth, and in later life seriously limited his mobility. In convalescence on 27 October 1917 he married Pamela Comfrey, the daughter of Sir Victor Horsley, an eminent surgeon. The marriage was to provide the foundation of a deeply happy and satisfying family life with two sons and four daughters.<br>
<br>In the course of the 1930s Robinson established himself as an authority of international renown on Greek coinage. In 1938 he succeeded to the post of reader in numismatics at Oxford, which he held simultaneously with his post in the British Museum. He used to stay the night with Dundas in Christ Church, allowing him to spend almost two days a week in the Heberden coin room of the Ashmolean Museum. Colin Kraay and Kenneth Jenkins, later keepers in Oxford and at the British Museum, were both taught by Robinson in this way. Pupils recalled that tutorials often seemed like the preparatory study for a learned article, as the evidence for a particular topic was weighed from every viewpoint, and in the light of the most up-to-date research. Robinson certainly combined a life of hugely influential teaching with a scholarly output of the highest quality. He produced a stream of monographs and papers on coinage that are listed in the bibliography of the Festschrift presented to him in 1968: his Cyrenaica volume of the British Museum catalogue of Greek coins, and the development of the <span class="roman">Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum</span> project were his most outstanding achievements.<br>
<br>Robinson was made deputy keeper of the department at the British Museum in 1936, and he spent the Second World War, together with the evacuated collections, in the Warwickshire house of Compton Wynyates. In 1948 his scholarly contribution was recognized by his election to a fellowship of the British Academy and he was made keeper at the British Museum in 1949. In 1951&#151;shortly before his retirement and his appointment as CBE in 1952&#151;he took up a house at Stepleton Iwerne, near Blandford Forum, Dorset. The home and gardens he made there were to provide the focus of his long and extremely happy retirement. In 1955 he was made an honorary DLitt and an honorary student of Christ Church, and he continued to hold his Oxford readership until 1958. An outstanding portrait by Anthony Devas (1954) captures much of the spirit of the man about this time: a scholar with his coins, regarding the spectator with a relaxed, humane, and kindly gaze. Robinson was also an enormously distinguished collector of coins in his own right&#151;his collecting grew from his experience that there is no substitute for handling and examining the coins themselves. Often the British Museum benefited directly from his personal collecting, but it is his gifts to the Heberden coin room which reveal the full extent of his extraordinary generosity. In all he gave over 5500 Greek coins of the first importance to the Heberden coin room during his lifetime. In addition, the family trust that he established continues to donate funds to the Ashmolean Museum for the purchase of Greek coins and the promotion of numismatics.<br>
<br>Stanley Robinson was unquestionably the greatest Greek numismatist of his time, and he was knighted for &#145;services to numismatics and the Ashmolean Museum&#146; in 1972. He was also a deeply patient and serene human being. As immobility and deafness began to limit his world, he returned to 89 Great Russell Street, his house near the British Museum, where he died on 13 June 1976. He was buried in the little churchyard at Stepleton within yards of his former home.<br>
