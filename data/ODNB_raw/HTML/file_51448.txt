<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Blanchflower,  Robert Dennis <span class="st"> [Danny]</span></span>  (1926&#150;1993), <span class="occ">footballer and journalist</span>, was born on 10 February 1926 at 7 Elmdale Street in the Bloomfield district of east Belfast, the eldest child in the family of three sons and two daughters of John Blanchflower, an iron turner in the Belfast shipyards, and his wife, Selina, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Ellison. His working-class, Presbyterian family had little interest in sport, though his mother had played football in her youth, for the Roebucks factory team during that brief moment between 1915 and 1923 when women's football threatened to become almost as much an obsession as the male version.<br>
<br>Danny Blanchflower was educated at Ravenscroft public elementary school and did well enough to be awarded a scholarship to Belfast College of Technology. He joined the air training corps there but left early to become an apprentice electrician at the Gallachers' cigarette factory. He also joined the air-raid precautions (ARP) and in 1943 lied about his age in order to join the RAF. As a trainee navigator he was sent on a course to St Andrews University (where he acquired a lifelong love of golf) and in the spring of 1945 was posted to Canada for further training. By April 1946 he was back in Belfast, back at Gallachers, and building a reputation as an outstanding footballer.<br>
<br>Like many working-class boys of his generation, Blanchflower learned to play football at school and on the streets and waste ground of his home town. He was good enough to be chosen for the Belfast Wolf Cub team against their Dublin counterparts in 1937. When the time of year allowed, he could play three times on a Saturday: for the school in the morning, the Boys' Brigade in the afternoon, and a local league team in the evening. During the early part of the war he characteristically formed his own club, Bloomfield United. He was establishing a reputation for himself within the local football subculture and in 1942, shortly before his sixteenth birthday, he was signed as an amateur by the local professional team Glentoran. He returned from military service fitter and stronger and soon won a place in the Glentoran first team, who played in the Irish league. He had thought of returning to St Andrews University, but the offer of a &pound;50 signing-on fee and &pound;3 for playing a game he loved and was good at proved too tempting.<br>
<br>In February 1947 Blanchflower played for the Irish league against the English league. As the opposition included Stanley Matthews, Tommy Lawton, Tom Finney, and Billy Wright and the Irish only lost 4&#150;2 it is hardly surprising that it stimulated his ambition to go east. By now he was playing on the right-hand side of midfield, where his ability to make the telling pass and to see how the game was going far outweighed his shortage of pace. He fell out with Glentoran about money, and in 1948&#150;9 their directors agreed that if an English club wanted him he could have one-third of the transfer fee. Only second-division Barnsley made an offer, because other English clubs thought him neither strong enough nor quick enough to succeed in the faster English game. The fee was &pound;6000, of which Blanchflower collected &pound;700, which did nothing to appease his low opinion of football's ruling &eacute;lite.<br>
<br>At Barnsley, Blanchflower replaced a local hero, Sidney (Skinner) Normanton, for whom the phrase &#145;Get stuck in&#146; could have been invented. Blanchflower could tackle too, but his anticipation, interceptions, and perceptive passes soon won over the hard-nosed Oakwell crowd. Certainly the local paper had never seen such a skilful player. As its football correspondent put it, &#145;the girth of his skill is immense&#146;  (Bowler, 53). On 1 October 1949 he won the first of fifty-six caps for Northern Ireland. While playing for Barnsley he lived in Darfield in a bungalow owned by the club and travelled to home matches on public transport with his boots in a brown paper bag. But he wasn't happy. What disappointed him was the lack of thought, of serious preparation, of any plan or method on the field. He was desperate to practise with the ball but the trainer would not even allow him to return in the afternoon for ball practice because if he did, he said, all the other players would want to do the same. He was impatient for a move to the first division, where more sophisticated attitudes would be found. In March 1951 he was transferred to Aston Villa for &pound;15,000. But he was intensely frustrated to find that things were little different there. The older players did much as they liked and were far from impressed by this incessantly talkative young man who thought he knew much more than they did.<br>
<br>In 1954 Blanchflower seemed on the verge of signing for Arsenal for a then record fee but at the last moment the deal fell through. Instead he went to Tottenham Hotspur for &pound;30,000. It was the best move of his life. Not that it seemed so at first. For one thing Arthur Rowe, who had built the stylish Tottenham team of the early 1950s, had to retire from the manager's job owing to illness. Jimmy Anderson was a much more old-fashioned manager and soon fell out with Blanchflower, from whom he removed the captaincy. A championship team was nevertheless being built up&#151;at least, once Bill Nicholson replaced Anderson as manager in October 1958. It was Nicholson who made the inspired signings of Les Allen, Bill Brown, Dave Mackay, and John White. He disciplined the argumentative Blanchflower by dropping him, but in 1959 reinstated him as captain. Although very different in character, they were both keen on new ways of playing based on what they had seen of the control, passing, movement, and possession of the Brazilians and the Hungarians.<br>
<br>Blanchflower had captained Northern Ireland to the last eight of the world cup in 1958 and in the same year was voted footballer of the year by the football writers. In his early thirties he was at the height of his powers and an intelligent creator of time and space. Tottenham finished third in the first division in 1959&#150;60, having finished eighteenth in 1958&#150;9. On the eve of the 1960&#150;61 season the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span>'s Bernard Joy reported a conversation with Blanchflower in which the latter had told him that football was not really about winning, goals, saves, or supporters: &#145;It's about doing things in style, doing them with a flourish. It's about going out to beat the other lot, not waiting for them to die of boredom. It's about dreaming of the glory of the double&#146;  (Bowler, 13). By the end of the season both cup and league had been won (the first time in the twentieth century that any team had won the double), the league with an average of almost three goals a game. But it was the style in which it was done that made Spurs the second-favourite team of most football enthusiasts. An almost certain record of 2&frac12; million people watched their matches. And for Blanchflower it was a personal triumph recognized by a second award as footballer of the year. The FA cup was won again the next year and the European cup winners' cup the year after that, but the glory of 1960&#150;61 could never be recaptured.<br>
<br>Blanchflower was that rare bird, someone who could think and talk about the game as effectively as he played it. He had been writing columns in various papers since his Villa days for the <span class="italic">Birmingham Evening Mail</span> and then, after his move south, for the <span class="italic">London Evening News</span>. He had even published in <span class="italic">The Observer</span> and the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>. By the time of retirement in 1964 he had ten years' experience, and he worked for the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span> as a columnist from 1964 until 1988.<br>
<br>Like many complicated personalities, Blanchflower had his contradictions. He was a private man, and refused to take part in the television programme <span class="italic">This is your Life</span> in 1961; but he wanted people to know who he was, and he was the first professional footballer to appear on <span class="italic">Desert Island Discs</span> (in 1960). He could be charming but also determined to have his own way, opinionated and witty but sometimes intolerant of the views of others. He could be unwilling to change his ideas or compromise. Even in football he was both progressive and romantic: he was a pioneer of more imaginative systems of play, but could be very critical of modern coaches, whom he accused of using tactics to stifle invention. He was articulate but not always easy for young footballers to understand, and this may have partly accounted for his failure to succeed as a manager when he eventually tried, first with Northern Ireland from January 1976 to the summer of 1978, and then when he failed to save Chelsea from relegation in 1978&#150;9. He probably would have liked to manage Tottenham&#151;he had been assistant manager there while still a player&#151;but when Nicholson resigned in 1974 the board shied away from appointing someone so brilliant but unpredictable and outspoken.<br>
<br>Blanchflower was married three times. He and his first wife, Denise (whom he had married in Belfast), divorced in 1953. His second marriage was to Betty Lawson, with whom he had a son and two daughters. That marriage ended in divorce in 1963, the year in which he married Avrille Margaret Dean Hunter. There were two further daughters by this marriage, which ended in divorce in 1976.<br>
<br>Money was a frequent worry for Blanchflower, and he was grateful for a testimonial which brought him &pound;40,000. Towards the end of his life he suffered from Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. He died at Woodlands Nursing Home, Rookery Road, Staines, Middlesex, on 9 December 1993, of bronchopneumonia after suffering a fall which broke his hip. As his biographer shrewdly noted, he was remembered with more affection than was sometimes bestowed on him in his life. A memorial service was held in St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast, on 14 February 1994.<br>
