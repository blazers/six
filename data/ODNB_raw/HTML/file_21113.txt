</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Paget, Sir  James</span>, first baronet  (1814&#150;1899), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, was born on 11 January 1814 at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, the eighth of seventeen children of Samuel Paget (1774&#150;1857), brewer and shipowner, and his wife, Sarah Elizabeth 
    (Betsey; 1778&#150;1843)
  , daughter of Thomas Tolver and Sarah Elizabeth Applewhite (only nine of the children survived to adulthood). His oldest brother, Frederick, migrated to Vienna and established himself in business there. Another brother entered the medical profession: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21109/', "Sir George Paget")</script> became regius professor of physic in Cambridge. His brother Arthur, a student at the inns of court and a friend of W. M. Thackeray, died of consumption at the age of twenty-five. Another brother, the Revd Alfred Paget, was a schoolmaster at Shrewsbury and later rector of Kirstead. Two brothers worked in their father's brewery. These last two, Alfred, and his sisters Martha and Katherine never married.<br>
<br>After attending a local private school James Paget served an apprenticeship in Great Yarmouth with Charles Costerton, who had trained at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. With introductions from Costerton and his brother George, Paget moved to London in 1834, where he enrolled at St Bartholomew's to continue his medical education. There he met Henry Wentworth Acland, who became a very close friend. Acland later became regius professor of medicine at Oxford. After a prize-winning student career, Paget qualified as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons on 13 May 1836, and he was elected one of the original group of fellows when that rank was created in 1843. After qualifying he visited Paris on a short medical tour and then returned to London to establish himself in his profession.<br>
<br>Even before qualifying Paget began publishing scientific and medical letters. While living in Great Yarmouth, he and his brother Charles studied the local flora and fauna and produced <span class="italic">A Sketch of the Natural History of Yarmouth and its Neighbourhood</span> (1834). Paget contributed a number of biographies of famous medical practitioners to Knight's <span class="italic">Penny Cyclopedia</span> between 1833 and 1844, and from 1837 to 1842 he was sub-editor of, and contributor to, the <span class="italic">London Medical Gazette</span>. He also contributed articles to the <span class="italic">British and Foreign Medical Quarterly</span> and the <span class="italic">Biographical Dictionary</span>.<br>
<br>Remaining in London was a clear sign that Paget meant to make a career for himself in the metropolis, and the first rung of the ladder was his appointment in 1837 as curator of the museum at St Bartholomew's Hospital. A second step was his teaching appointment from 1839, as demonstrator of morbid anatomy at Bart's, a post he held for four years. His excellence as a teacher led to his promotion to lecturer on general anatomy and physiology in May 1843. This, together with his appointment as the first warden of the college for students of St Bartholomew's Hospital medical school in August of the same year led Paget to believe that &#145;all was changed&#146;  (Paget MS 236), for it signalled the possibility of a bright professional future. The students admired and respected him, and he stayed on as warden until October 1851. Writing, teaching, and administration were essential sources of livelihood in these early years, for Paget's practice brought in &pound;8 a year in the first two years and had not reached &pound;50 even a decade later; he lived on meagre earnings and money borrowed from his brother George.<br>
<br>In 1836 Paget had engaged himself to Lydia North (1815&#150;1895), daughter of the Revd Henry North, domestic chaplain to the duke of Kent, despite the limited prospects he then had. She was a pious and talented young woman. As a girl she studied at the Royal Academy of Music, where she won prizes. Her musical talents included both composition and playing the piano. But the collapse of Paget's father's businesses, and James and George Paget's commitment to pay their father's debts and those of their brother Arthur, meant that family life had to be postponed. James and Lydia finally married on 23 May 1844; they had two daughters and four sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35355/', "Francis Paget")</script>, and enjoyed a tender and affectionate relationship for more than fifty years of married life.<br>
<br>In 1841 Paget had been appointed surgeon to the Finsbury Dispensary, but real professional opportunities came only with an appointment to one of the teaching hospitals, and in 1847 the chance for a post at Bart's arose. In a hotly contested election Paget won appointment as assistant surgeon&#151;contested perhaps because of his lack of experience as a surgical dresser and houseman, and perhaps because of the opposition of one senior member of the hospital staff. He became a full surgeon at Bart's in July 1861, a position he resigned in May 1871 to become consulting surgeon to the hospital. He continued his teaching at the medical school, as lecturer in physiology from 1859 to 1861 and as lecturer in surgery from 1865 to 1869.<br>
<br>Benefiting from his links with St Bartholomew's, Paget's practice as a surgeon blossomed. At the height of his career he travelled two, three, or even four thousand miles within Britain each year to confer with other medical practitioners and to operate. Among his patients were many medical and public figures, as well as ordinary sufferers. His most famous patients were members of the royal family. In 1858 he became surgeon-extraordinary to Queen Victoria, and at various times he treated members of the royal family, including Princess Alexandra. He was named serjeant-surgeon-extraordinary in 1867 and a decade later was appointed serjeant-surgeon to Queen Victoria. He left the poverty of his early professional days behind and was able to afford excellent education for his sons; he estimated that it cost some &pound;19,000 to establish them in life  (Paget MS 223). At his death his personal estate was valued at almost &pound;75,000.<br>
<br>In the emerging environment of medico-scientific inquiry in the 1840s and 1850s Paget found a place congenial to his scientific interests, his fine abilities as an observer, and his desire to launch a successful professional career. His acute observational powers were applied to medical pathology throughout his working life. Early in his London studies in the hospital dissecting room, he noticed that what others were seeing as specks in the muscle tissue of a cadaver were, in fact, spiral worms enclosed in cysts. He presented a paper before the Abernethian Society on <span class="italic">Trichina spiralis</span> in February of 1835, though with his agreement the first publication credit went to his senior, the anatomist Richard Owen.<br>
<br>The opportunity to make his name in pathology was not lost, however. Indeed, Paget made the most of his early appointments at St Bartholomew's. In 1846 he published <span class="italic">A Descriptive Catalogue of the Anatomical Museum of St Bartholomew's Hospital</span> (2 vols.); a third volume was edited by W. S. Savory. This, together with his <span class="italic">Descriptive catalogue of the pathological specimens contained in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England</span> (5 vols., 1846&#150;9), established, some believe, the basis for his reputation in medical science.<br>
<br>Appointed Arris and Gale lecturer at the Royal College of Surgeons from 1847 to 1852, Paget carried out research in the Hunterian museum of the college and then delivered a series of lectures in pathology. He published these as <span class="italic">Lectures on Surgical Pathology</span> (2 vols., 1853), and the next generation credited Paget with reviving, thereby, the neglected study of pathology.<br>
<br>Paget was an indefatigable writer, publishing nearly two hundred books and papers. He researched, delivered speeches, and wrote articles on a range of topics in addition to medicine, surgery, and pathology&#151;on alcohol, science and religion, medical education, and medical history&#151;many of which remain documents of the medical, moral, and social life of his times. A few of his papers have become medical classics.<br>
<br>In 1874 Paget published &#145;On disease of the mammary areola producing cancer of the mammary gland&#146;  (<span class="italic">St Bartholomew's Hospital Reports</span>, 10, 1874, 87&#150;90). This classic paper described a skin eruption associated with breast cancer which was subsequently called Paget's disease of the mammary nipple and areola. Paget's most famous paper, a description of a long-known disease, was &#145;On a form of chronic inflammation of bones (osteitis deformans)&#146;  (<span class="italic">Medico-Chirurgical Transactions</span>, 60, 1877, 37&#150;63), in which he identified an inflammatory disease characterized by thickened bones and lesions in the neck and skull. This disease came to be known as Paget's disease of the bone.<br>
<br>Paget's name has been attached to other medical processes and syndromes, among them Paget's cell, Paget-von Schroetter syndrome (a form of thrombosis), Paget's abscess (a residual abscess), Paget's test (to differentiate between solid and cystic tumours), and Paget's quiet necrosis (bone disease without signs of inflammation). In the twentieth century he was credited by B. V. Shenoy and W. B. Scheithauer with original observations regarding dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans in Paget's article &#145;Recurring fibroid and fibro-nucleated tumors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Lectures in Surgical Pathology</span>, 1853).<br>
<br>Paget's wardenship of Bart's was only the first of his long series of positions of influence and leadership in the medical profession. He also served on the council of the Royal College of Surgeons from 1865 to 1889 and was vice-president in 1873 and 1874, examiner on the midwifery board in 1874, and president in 1875. He went on to serve as the college's representative on the General Medical Council from 1876 to 1881. At the college he delivered the Hunterian oration in 1877, the Bradshaw lecture in 1882, and the Morton lecture in 1887. He held many other professional positions, including chairmanship of the Clinical Society (1869), the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society (1875), and the Pathological Society of London (1887), and the presidency of the International Medical Congress in 1881. Honours were many, among them election as fellow of the Royal Society (1851) and honorary degrees at Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Dublin, Bonn, and W&uuml;rzburg. Paget was created a baronet in 1871.<br>
<br>The relationship between the hospital medical schools and the University of London was a complex and vexed one for most of the century. In 1860 Paget was elected to the senate of the university, where he served until 1895. He served as vice-chancellor of the University of London from 1884 to 1895. During this period tensions between the university (in its examining role) and the teaching faculty led to proposals for changes in the university or, alternatively, to the creation of other degree-granting institutions in London. Paget's governance of the university senate in these years was &#145;gentle and considerate&#146; but might have been more effective if he had been more forceful  (Harte, 142). Two royal commissions (Selborne, 1888&#150;9, and Gresham, 1892&#150;4) examined the situation of university education in London.<br>
<br>Paget was known for the clarity and eloquence of his speech and for his courteous but reserved manner. At the end of his life colleagues remembered his &#145;self-restraint, self-judgment, reserve, self-discipline&#146;. To some &#145;he seemed an austere man &hellip; rather hard on soft people. &hellip; But to all men who were strong enough to feel his strength, and good enough to see his goodness, he was guide and master and friend&#146;  (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>, 6 Jan 1900). His lack of a classical and Oxbridge education and his family's financial collapse may have contributed to his reserve, seriousness, and caution. But he rarely took absolute moral positions (for instance, on the use of alcohol), and he did not use medical arguments to sustain moral positions (for example, on masturbation). He supported the entrance of women into the medical profession.<br>
<br>Paget was a devoted and perhaps demanding father. The Pagets' eldest child, Catherine Paget, married the Revd H. L. Thompson, schoolmaster and later vicar of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford. Their eldest son and heir to the baronetcy, John Rahere Paget, was a barrister and the author of <span class="italic">The Law of Banking</span> (1904; 10th edn, 1989). Their second and third sons, Francis and Henry Luke, were churchmen: one was dean of Christ Church and later bishop of Oxford and the other was bishop of Chester. Their fourth son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35360/', "Stephen Paget")</script>, became a surgeon but then turned to writing and to campaigning for medical research. The Pagets' youngest child, Mary Maud, lived with her parents throughout their lives. She was a musician, wrote articles on music history, and engaged in philanthropic activity. Lady Paget died on 7 January 1895.<br>
<br>Paget died of pneumonia on 30 December 1899 at his home, 5 Park Square West, Regent's Park, London. He was buried in Finchley cemetery after a funeral service on 4 January 1900 in Westminster Abbey.<br>
