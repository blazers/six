<span class="headword">Knighton,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> <em>c.</em>1396), <span class="occ">chronicler and Augustinian canon</span>, of the abbey of St Mary de Pratis, Leicester, most probably took his name from the abbey's own manor of Knighton, on the southern boundary of the borough of Leicester. The date of his birth and his parentage are unrecorded, and all that is known of his life comes from the content of his chronicle, which he wrote between 1379 and 1396, and some references from archival sources. He was apparently a member of the house in 1363, when he saw Edward III at Leicester; his residence is attested in the 1370s, and he was still active in 1389. He probably went blind in his later years, and he wrote nothing later than 1396. He bequeathed three books&#151;two devotional works and an encyclopaedia&#151;to the abbey library. He almost certainly died and was buried at St Mary de Pratis.<br>
<br>Knighton's chronicle survives in two manuscripts in the Cottonian collection in the British Library. The earlier, BL, Cotton MS Tiberius C.vii, is clearly close to the author, though none of its scribes' hands (some six in all) can be confidently attributed to him. It is certainly this copy of the work that was catalogued in the abbey library <i>c</i>.1490 by William Charite. The second manuscript, BL, Cotton MS Claudius E.iii, is wholly derivative, and was probably made in Leicester early in the fifteenth century.<br>
<br>The chronicle is a history of England from the Norman conquest to the last decade of the fourteenth century, with some introductory passages on events before 1066, including the legend of Guy of Warwick. Knighton explains his purpose in the opening chapters, and identifies himself by spelling out his name (as Henricus Cnitthon) in their initial letters, after the style of his model, Ranulf Higden (<i>d</i>. 1364). He planned a text in four books, but feared that he might not be able to complete it, a misgiving that probably refers both to his failing sight and to the unusual structure of the narrative.<br>
<br>The chronicle ends inconsequentially in 1396, but there is a break in the narrative between 1372 and 1376 that has caused much confusion. It appears that Knighton set out to write an account of his own times, beginning soon after the death of Abbot Clowne of Leicester in 1378, and then resolved to expand it into a general history from 1066. To that end he conflated the seventh book of Higden's <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span> and the early fourteenth-century chronicle of Walter of Guisborough, which took him as far as 1340. He then launched upon his own composition, from the beginning of the war in 1337. During the 1380s he was therefore engaged in two works, one a history of Richard II's reign as it unfolded, and the other substantially a history of the Hundred Years' War. In the event he was unable to connect the two, though he came very close to doing so: a matter of four years.<br>
<br>J. R. Lumby, who edited the Claudius manuscript for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span>, was familiar with the <span class="italic">Polychronicon</span>, but failed to identify Guisborough, and attributed his oversight to deceit on Knighton's part. He also propounded a theory that Knighton, whom he regarded as a plagiarist and fraud, had written only the first half of the chronicle, and that the section from 1376 onwards was the work of an anonymous continuator. The error, attested by references to &#145;<i>Cont.</i> <i>Knighton</i>&#146; in the works of T. F. Tout and others, was finally corrected by V. H. Galbraith in 1957.<br>
<br>The chronicle does nevertheless fall into two parts. In his account of the opening phases of the French war Knighton is writing at some remove in time from his material, though he shows himself a resourceful editor and narrator. His great hero was Henry of Grosmont, first duke of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1361), and though it is not clear that he knew Lancaster personally, he drew much of his material from the Lancastrian household at Leicester and elsewhere. The second part of the narrative is concerned with contemporary events, running from the onset of the great schism (1378) and the peasants' revolt in 1381 to the rise of Lollardy, and the parliamentary crisis of 1387&#150;8.<br>
<br>There again Knighton enjoyed particular sources of information. He speaks familiarly of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and his son Henry Bolingbroke, and he quotes the duke's officials when he reports the sack of the Savoy in 1381 and Gaunt's expedition to Spain in 1386&#150;9. His account of the appellants' campaign against the king's friends in 1387&#150;8, and the proceedings of the Merciless Parliament in 1388, reflects quite close connections with Bolingbroke.<br>
<br>When he described the beginnings of Lollardy, Knighton found his privileged position embarrassing. His fellow canon Philip Repyndon (<i>d</i>. 1424), who became abbot of Leicester in 1393, had been a distinguished follower of John Wyclif (<i>d</i>. 1384) and an enthusiastic preacher of Lollard beliefs to the laity in Leicester and elsewhere. William Swinderby, a formidable popularist and radical, was allowed to live in the abbey at some time before 1382, probably under Repyndon's patronage. Repyndon gave Knighton a variety of Lollard papers, and was evidently better assured of his ultimate justification than Knighton himself could feel.<br>
<br>For Knighton emerges from his work as staunchly orthodox and conservative. He sympathizes with the victims of incompetent and oppressive government, but not with rebellion as a remedy for their wrongs. He accepts Bolingbroke as a warrantor for the appellants' cause, but does not blame Richard for his favourites' failings, and treats the king as intelligent and imposing. Lollardy he condemns wholeheartedly, and does what he can, within the evidence that he deploys, to protect Repyndon from the consequences of past follies.<br>
<br>Beyond those large themes, Knighton tells a zestful story, and shows an informed interest in economic affairs: in wages, prices, and the business of supply. His putative audience liked tales of battle and military enterprise, and so did he, but he knew that campaigns had to be paid for as well as enjoyed. How far his own experience of such matters extended it is impossible now to tell, but it seems likely that at the least he had some firsthand knowledge of administration, in his own house if no farther afield.<br>
