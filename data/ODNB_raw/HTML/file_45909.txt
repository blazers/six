<span class="headword">Hobson,  Samuel George</span>  (1870&#150;1940), <span class="occ">political activist and journalist</span>, was born on 4 February 1870 in Bessbrook, near Newry, Northern Ireland, one of nine children of William Hobson, a Quaker minister, and his wife, Elizabeth, a teacher. Hobson's parents were both strict observers of their religion and they moved to England when Samuel was a child partly to ensure that their children could be educated at a Quaker school in Saffron Walden, which Samuel attended from 1880 to 1883. After the completion of his secondary education at the Friends' school, Sidcot, Somerset (1883&#150;8), and having failed to win a university scholarship, Hobson moved to Cardiff and became involved in socialist circles. He joined the Fabian Society in 1891 and the Independent Labour Party in 1893. He engaged in propaganda work and travelled widely. His early political career was not always successful. He missed the first Independent Labour Party conference in Bradford after a traffic accident, an event which, at least to Hobson himself, symbolized his status as something of an outsider. None the less, throughout the 1890s Hobson was a regular contributor to the <span class="italic">Labour Leader</span> and stood for parliament as an Independent Labour Party candidate for East Bristol in 1895. He was elected to the Fabian Society's executive in 1900.<br>
<br>Hobson's major impact on British politics came when he resigned from the Fabian Society in 1910. Increasingly irritated at the timidity of parliamentary Labour politics, he drifted away from mainstream socialism. In 1912 he became a columnist for A. R. Orage's weekly <span class="italic">New Age</span>, and in 1914 Hobson's series of articles on industrial policy emerged as a book, <span class="italic">National Guilds: an Inquiry into the Wage System and a Way Out</span>, published under Orage's editorship. Here, Hobson espoused an ideal of an industrial system composed of self-governing guilds, where neither the state nor capitalists would control industry but where the pay and conditions of work would be decided democratically by workers themselves. His theory became, for a while, the most influential statement of what became known as guild socialism.<br>
<br>Hobson's prominence did not last long. The arrival of the precocious Oxford academic George Douglas Howard Cole in guild socialist circles during the First World War threatened Hobson's supremacy. Their theoretical disagreements became a staple point of debate in the intellectual world of early twentieth-century socialism. The central contention often appeared to concern the role of the state in a prospective guild utopia, but in reality that issue was only testament to a far wider set of disagreements as to the nature of the underlying ideology, especially concerning the rights of the individual in relation to the authority of the guilds (see G. D. H. Cole, &#145;The guilds, the state, the consumer, Mr. S. G. Hobson and others&#146;, <span class="italic">New Age</span>, 6 Dec 1917). In 1915 Hobson joined with Cole as a founder member of the National Guilds League, but Cole's domination of the organization unsettled the less educated man, and Hobson never played a particularly large role in the movement, the focus of his attentions remaining with the <span class="italic">New Age</span>.<br>
<br>Even that was not to last. After Orage committed the <span class="italic">New Age</span> to support of the proposals of the maverick economist C. H. Douglas in 1919, Hobson became disillusioned with the journal. In its place, he moved to practical action and attempted to create a co-operative guild in the building trade in the early 1920s. Economic downturn, however, ensured that these were unsuitable years for industrial innovation and the guild soon collapsed. In its wake, he continued to work in the labour movement but never again achieved his earlier level of recognition.<br>
<br>Away from politics, Hobson appears to have lived a full life. He was never as emotionally committed to political activism as his more successful contemporaries and, as a result, he was able to pursue a series of other careers. These included the management of a banana plantation in British Honduras and the editorship of an investment journal, <span class="italic">The Mint</span>. Many of his experiences are retold in his engaging autobiography, <span class="italic">Pilgrim to the Left: Memoirs of a Modern Revolutionist</span>, which was published to some acclaim in 1938. He died at his home, 6 Albion Street, in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, on 4 January 1940.<br>
