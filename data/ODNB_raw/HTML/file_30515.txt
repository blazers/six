<span class="headword">Bacon,  John Mackenzie</span>  (1846&#150;1904), <span class="occ">astronomer and aviator</span>, born at Lambourn Woodlands, Berkshire, on 19 June 1846, was the fourth son of John Bacon (1809&#150;1871), vicar of Lambourn Woodlands, a friend and neighbour of Charles Kingsley and Tom Hughes, and his wife, Mary Lousada, of Spanish ancestry. His great-grandfather was John Bacon RA, and his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/996/', "John Bacon (1777&#150;1859)")</script>, sculptor. After education at home and at a coaching establishment at Old Charlton, near Woolwich, with a view to the army, he matriculated from Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1865, and gained a foundation scholarship in 1869. Eye trouble compelled an <i>aegrotat</i> degree in the mathematical tripos of 1869. His close friends at Cambridge included William Kingdon Clifford, Francis Maitland Balfour, and Edward Henry Palmer, the orientalist.<br>
<br>From 1869 to 1875 Bacon worked with his eldest brother, Maunsell, at Cambridge as a pass &#145;coach&#146;. On 11 April 1871 Bacon married Gertrude (1849&#150;1894), youngest daughter of Charles John Myers, fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and vicar of Flintham, Nottingham; they had two sons and one daughter, Gertrude. After taking holy orders in 1870, he was unpaid curate of Harston, Cambridge, until 1876, when he settled at Coldash, Berkshire. His pastoral activities were limited by his own tubercular tendencies and his wife's nervous breakdown. He assisted in parochial work, was a poor-law guardian, initiated cottage shows, and encouraged handbell-ringing and agriculture.<br>
<br>Bacon acted as curate of Shaw, 4 miles from Coldash, from 1882 until 1889, when his <span class="italic">The Curse of Conventionalism: a Remonstrance by a Priest of the Church of England</span> boldly challenged the conventional clerical attitude to scientific questions, and brought on him the censure of the orthodox. Thereupon he abandoned clerical work and the clerical collar, and devoted himself to scientific study. Though still a believer, he declined to preach until &#145;I can have a lantern screen stretched across the chancel arch and a photograph of the Orion Nebula or some other glory of the heavens, to talk about&#146;  (G. Bacon, 173).<br>
<br>Astronomy and aeronautics had interested him from boyhood, and much of his life was devoted to stimulating public interest in these subjects. On 10 February 1888 he became a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, before which he read in 1898 a paper on &#145;Actinic qualities of light as affected by different conditions of atmosphere&#146;. With the British Astronomical Association, which he joined in 1895 (and of which he became a member of council and of the eclipse committees), he witnessed at Vads&oslash;, in the extreme north-east of Norway, the total eclipse of the sun on 9 August 1896. In December 1897 he led a party to Buxar in India for the solar eclipse of January 1898, and took the first animated photographs of the eclipse, but the films mysteriously disappeared on the voyage home. Of this eclipse Bacon gave an account in the <span class="italic">Journal</span> of the association  (8.264). Bacon, as special correspondent to <span class="italic">The Times</span>, observed the solar eclipse of 28 May 1900 at Wadesborough, North Carolina, and made further experiments with the cinematograph.<br>
<br>From kite-flying Bacon early turned to ballooning and to the acoustic and meteorological researches for which it gave opportunity. His first balloon ascent was made from the Crystal Palace on 20 August 1888 with Captain Dale. He recorded enthusiastically, &#145;I left this world about 5.15 &hellip;&#146;  (G. Bacon, 151). Experiments in 1899 proved that sound travelled through the air less rapidly upwards than downwards. In August of that year he successfully experimented from his balloon with wireless telegraphy. In November 1902 Bacon crossed the sea from the Isle of Man to Galloway. On the voyage he proved the theory that the sea bottom was visible and could be photographed from a great height. Bacon photographed from his balloon, at a height of 600 feet, the beds of sand and rock 10 fathoms deep in the bottom of the Irish Sea; these photographs were exhibited at the Royal Society's soir&eacute;e at Burlington House in the spring of 1903. With J. Nevil Maskelyne, Bacon began experiments in the inflation of balloons with hot air by the vaporization of petroleum, in place of coal gas, thereby greatly quickening the process and producing some very tense flights in craft potentially extremely explosive. Bacon also researched into the causes and cure of London fog, insisting on the need for stronger currents of air through the streets, by widening thoroughfares and increasing the number of open spaces.<br>
<br>Bacon became active and successful as a popular scientific lecturer and writer. He read before the Society of Arts papers on &#145;The balloon as an instrument of scientific research&#146;  (published in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Society of Arts</span>, 17 Feb 1899), and &#145;Scientific observations at high altitudes&#146;  (ibid., 24 Jan 1902). In a paper at the Cambridge meeting of the British Association on &#145;Upper air currents and their relation to the far travel of sound&#146; (1904) he summarized his subsequent acoustic experiments in balloons. Bacon died of pleurisy at his home, Sunnyside, Coldash, on 26 December 1904, and was buried in Swallowfield churchyard, near Reading, four days later. Only the previous year (7 October 1903), he had married a second wife&#151;Stella, youngest daughter of Captain T. B. H. Valintine of Goodwood&#151;with whom he had a second daughter. His elder daughter, Gertrude, a frequent companion on his expeditions, wrote his biography.<br>
