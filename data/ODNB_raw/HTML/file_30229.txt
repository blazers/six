<span class="headword">Yonge,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1619), <span class="occ">music editor</span>, may be identified with the Nicholas Yong of London who was born in Lewes, Sussex, and whose mother's name was Bray. In 1585 he applied for membership of the London waits and doubtless through the influence of his sponsor, Sir Walter Mildmay, gained a place in reversion, though there is no record of his having taken it up. He lived in the parish of St Michael Cornhill, where from 1587 onwards seven of his nine children were baptized. He was admitted lay vicar-choral of St Paul's Cathedral on 16 January 1592, and in the course of Bishop Bancroft's 1598 visitation he gave evidence concerning abuses in the choir during divine service.<br>
<br>Yonge is best remembered today as the editor of two anthologies of mostly Italian vocal music published, with English texts, as <span class="italic">Musica transalpina</span> in 1588 and 1597. The first volume, containing fifty-seven &#145;madrigals&#146;&#151;the first recorded English use of the term, and applied here not only to true madrigals, but also to chansons, canzonets, and other forms&#151;was international in scope. It none the less betrayed a certain local bias: of its eighteen composers, the most liberally represented was Alfonso Ferrabosco the elder, who had lived in England from 1562 to 1578. Yonge also included William Byrd's English setting of Ariosto's &#145;La verginella&#146;, the first stanza of which had appeared in Italian some months earlier in the composer's own <span class="italic">Psalmes, Sonets &amp; Songs</span>. In the dedication, addressed to Lord Gilbert Talbot, Yonge suggested that the publication grew out of the need to supply suitable material for friends to sing at daily music meetings in his home. As the repertory provided was mostly Italian, and those unfamiliar with the language either did not participate or did so &#145;with litle delight&#146;, he sought more music in the vernacular. Finding few suitable native compositions, he borrowed English versions of pieces translated by &#145;a Gentleman&#146;, and these and others like them proved so popular that he was eventually persuaded to publish a selection. A third of the pieces were drawn from madrigal anthologies issued in 1583 and 1585 by Pierre Phal&egrave;se of Antwerp. The success of Yonge's first collection led to its reprinting in 1593 or 1594. His 1597 volume, containing only twenty-four items by eleven composers, was less influential, though six of its lyrics were reset by later composers, a higher proportion than the nine reset from the first volume.<br>
<br>Yonge's madrigal anthologies are important because they popularized the form in England and laid the foundations for an indigenous madrigal school by providing continental models for Elizabethan composers to imitate. He made his will on 19 October 1619 and was buried at St Michael Cornhill four days later. Probate was granted to his wife, Jane, on 12 November following.<br>
