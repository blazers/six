<span class="headword">Mansfield,  William Rose</span>, first Baron Sandhurst  (1819&#150;1876), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born on 26 June 1819 at Ruxley, Kent, the fifth of seven sons of John Edward Mansfield of Diggeswell House, Hertfordshire, and his wife, Mary Buchanan, daughter of General Samuel Smith of Baltimore, USA. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17995/', "Sir James Mansfield")</script>, and among his brothers were Sir Samuel Mansfield, a senior member of council, Bombay, Colonel Sir Charles Mansfield of the diplomatic service, and John Mansfield, a London police magistrate. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and passed out in November 1835 at the head of the five most distinguished cadets of his half-year.<br>
<br>Mansfield was commissioned ensign in the 53rd foot on 27 November 1835, and promoted lieutenant in 1838, and captain in 1843. After serving in the Mediterranean and at home, he accompanied his regiment to India, and was present at Badiwal, at Aliwal (28 January 1846), and at Sobraon (10 February 1846), during the First Anglo-Sikh War. During the last-mentioned engagement he acted as aide-de-camp to Lord Gough. On 3 December 1847 he was promoted major, and early in 1848 commanded a small detached force that suppressed civil disturbances in Bihar. Mansfield commanded the 53rd foot during the Second Anglo-Sikh War, and on 21 February 1849 fought at the battle of Gujrat. On 9 May 1851 he became a junior lieutenant-colonel at the age of thirty-two, passing over Henry Havelock, having purchased all his promotions apart from the first. In 1851&#150;2 he was constantly employed in the Peshawar district on the north-west frontier, in operations against the trans-border Pathans, either in command of the 53rd or attached to the staff of Sir Colin Campbell (afterwards Lord Clyde), who commanded the area. During this period Mansfield established a close friendship with Campbell, who formed a high opinion of his abilities.<br>
<br>Mansfield briefly considered an alternative career, either in journalism or in banking, during the 1850s, but finally decided to stay in the army. On 2 November 1854 he married Margaret [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/41211/', "Mansfield, Margaret, Lady Sandhurst (bap. 1827, d. 1892)")</script>], daughter of Robert Fellowes of Shotesham Park, Norfolk; they had four sons and a daughter. He was promoted brevet colonel on 28 November 1854, and in April 1855 exchanged to the unattached list and was appointed deputy adjutant-general in Dublin. In June 1855 he was sent to Constantinople, with the temporary rank of brigadier-general in Turkey, to act as military adviser to the British ambassador, Lord Stratford de Redcliffe. When he arrived in Constantinople a plan for relieving the city of Kars with the Turkish contingent was under active consideration. Mansfield maintained constant communication with the Turkish authorities on the subject, and afterwards accompanied the ambassador to the Crimea where he rendered valuable services. Following the end of the war in 1856 he received the quasi-military appointment of consul-general at Warsaw, with the rank of brigadier-general in Poland. After the outbreak of the Indian mutiny in May 1857 Mansfield was recalled by special request of Sir Colin Campbell, who had been appointed commander-in-chief in India following the death from cholera of Sir George Anson. An entry in Campbell's diary, dated 11 July 1857, reads:<blockquote>Before going to the Duke of Cambridge I had settled in my mind that my dear friend Mansfield should have the offer made to him of chief of the staff. His lordship (Panmure) proposed the situation of military secretary, but that I told his lordship was not worth his acceptance, and I pressed for the appointment of chief of the staff being offered to him, with the rank of major-general and the pay and allowances of that office in India. (Shadwell, 1.405)</blockquote>On 7 August 1857 Mansfield was appointed chief of the staff in India, with the local rank of major-general. While passing through London, <i>en route</i> for India, he was consulted by the government, and submitted a plan of operations based on the same principles as that communicated in confidence by Campbell to the Madras government on his way to Calcutta. Mansfield acted as Campbell's right-hand man and as his strategic mentor throughout the period that followed, and played a key role in planning the reconquest of the area occupied by the mutineers.<br>
<br>In late October 1857 Mansfield left Calcutta with Campbell to take command of the force assembled to relieve the besieged garrison of Lucknow. Mansfield participated in the advance on Lucknow and in the second relief of the city in November 1857 (for which he was made a KCB on 24 March 1858). On 6 December he was present when the Gwalior contingent was routed at the third battle of Cawnpore. During this engagement he was sent by Campbell late in the afternoon to occupy the Subahdar's Tank, blocking the line of retreat of the enemy's centre and right wing. Mansfield halted, however, rather than advancing after dark through a mile of ruined buildings where the rebels were still located, thereby allowing them to escape with all their artillery. He accompanied Campbell in the advance on Fatehgarh and the engagement at Kali Nadi, and at the siege of Lucknow (when he was promoted major-general for distinguished service in the field). He then participated in the summer campaign in Rohilkhand, at the battle of Bareilly and at Shahjahanpur, in the campaign in Oudh during 1858&#150;9, and in the operations in the trans-Gogra. Following the end of the uprising he shouldered the chief burden of reorganizing the shattered fragments of the Bengal army and dealing with the disgruntled European troops of the now defunct East India Company. Although Mansfield was a resolute critic of the company's troops, and played an instrumental role in their eventual transfer to the crown, he did not agree with the official policy towards the company's officers and men which had provoked the &#145;white mutiny&#146;.<br>
<br>In December 1859 Mansfield was offered the command of the north China expedition, but refused it in the hope he would be appointed commander-in-chief following the end of Lord Clyde's period of command. He was disappointed in this hope, however, and until 23 April 1860 remained chief of the staff in India. He held the command of the Bombay presidency, with the local rank of lieutenant-general, from 18 May 1860 to 14 March 1865. He was appointed colonel 38th foot in 1862 and was made lieutenant-general in December 1864. On 14 March 1865 he was appointed commander-in-chief in India and military member of the executive council, a position he held until 8 April 1870. Throughout this period he was a warm supporter of Lord Lawrence, but his tenure of command in India did not prove a great success. He was unpopular, and on several occasions had painful and discreditable quarrels; he sometimes lacked both good temper and judgement in dealing with subordinates. The incident most damaging to his reputation occurred when he court-martialled a member of his personal staff against whom he had levelled charges of peculation and falsifying accounts, none of which could be substantiated. Mansfield commanded the forces in Ireland between 1 August 1870 and 31 July 1875. He was made a GCB in May 1870, sworn of the Irish privy council in August 1870, and awarded the honorary degree of DCL at Oxford in June 1870. Two years later he was promoted general. Mansfield was also unpopular in Ireland, and several times showed a lamentable lack of judgement. On 28 March 1871, during Gladstone's first administration, Mansfield was created Baron Sandhurst of Sandhurst, Berkshire. A Liberal in politics, he took an active part in debates in the House of Lords, talking on such topics as army organization and the abolition of the purchase system which he believed would result in &#145;stagnation, tempered by jobbery&#146;. He died on 23 June 1876, aged fifty-seven, of &#145;congestion of the lungs&#146;, at his London residence, 18 Grosvenor Gardens. He was buried at Digswell church, near Welwyn, Hertfordshire. His eldest son, William (1855&#150;1921), succeeded to the peerage, and was governor of Bombay from 1895 to 1900 and lord chamberlain from 1912 to 1921.<br>
<br>Mansfield was tall and wiry, with dark hair. He possessed undoubted intellectual abilities and was a staff officer of considerable aptitude, but his haughty, often contemptuous and arrogant manner made him unpopular with his subordinates and fellow officers throughout his career. He disliked advice, was unable to delegate authority to others, and had many personal enemies. An able and courageous staff officer and administrator, he lacked the necessary leadership ability to prove a successful commander in the field and his personal judgement was frequently questionable.<br>
