<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Chadwick,  Lynn Russell</span>  (1914&#150;2003), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 24 November 1914 at 66 Station Road, Barnes, Surrey, the elder child and only son of Verner Russell Chadwick, mechanical engineer and designer of solid-fuel furnaces, and his wife, Margery Brown, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lynn. He was educated at the Sacred Heart School and Beverley School, Barnes, and Merchant Taylor's School, London, where he received extra tuition in watercolour and oils by his art master, K. P. F. Brown. He was taken on regular visits to the Tate Gallery and to the G. F. Watts Gallery, Surrey, by his parents. In 1932 he was sent to Vouvray to improve his French and visited Oscar Wilde's grave, designed by Jacob Epstein, in P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery, Paris, having already been shown Epstein's controversial <span class="italic">Rima</span> in Hyde Park. In his late teens he had met the sculptor, Wilfred Dudeney, and, inspired by the idea of working alone in a studio, wanted to become an artist, but his parents steered him towards the more secure profession of architecture.<br>
<br>Chadwick's headmaster arranged for him to join the architectural practice of an Old Merchant Taylor, Donald Hamilton, as a trainee architectural draughtsman, in 1933. After working for the &eacute;migr&eacute; architect Eugene C. Kaufman, he joined the engineering firm of Rodney Thomas. Thomas designed showrooms and trade-fair exhibition stands for Ascot Water Heaters, and Chadwick's association with him was pivotal for his transition to becoming a sculptor. Having attended evening classes in architecture at Regent Street Polytechnic, Chadwick found that he did not have the temperament to become an architect.<br>
<br>During the Second World War Chadwick worked first on the land in Herefordshire, a reserved occupation, before enlisting with the Fleet Air Arm in 1941. He was commissioned in 1942, later becoming a temporary lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He trained in the USA and Canada, where he met (Charlotte) Ann Secord (<i>d</i>. 1997) of Toronto. They married in 1942, and had one son. After qualifying as a pilot, Chadwick served on convoy duties in the North Atlantic until his demobilization in 1944.<br>
<br>From 1944 to 1946 Chadwick rented a house at 2 Cheyne Row, Chelsea, London, and returned to work for Rodney Thomas (who had set up the firm Arcon, designing prefabricated buildings) and continued to work on exhibition design. Thomas had been making &#145;mobile sculptures&#146;, balancing balsa wood shapes, making them rock: these inspired Chadwick to make a piece of his own, suspending thin, irregular, ungeometric balsa wood shapes on aluminium wire. Both Thomas and Chadwick were at the time unaware of the American artist Alexander Calder's work of the late 1930s.<br>
<br>In 1946 Chadwick and family moved to Gloucestershire, first to Fisher's Cottage, near Stroud, and then to a remote cottage at Pinswell, near Cheltenham, in 1947, where Chadwick had space to work as a freelance designer. Having in 1946 won a textile design competition initiated by Zika and Lida Ascher, he was asked to produce an additional ten designs a year and he also designed furniture. He now began to concentrate on making mobiles as decorative features for exhibition stands, including the Aluminium Development Association's stand at the builders' trades fair of 1947 and the Morris Furniture Co. (Glasgow) stand at the British industries fair in 1948. He later referred to his mobiles as &#145;research into space and volume&#146;  (Ritchie, 70).<br>
<br>In 1949 Gimpel Fils Gallery showed a mobile piece by Chadwick in the window of the gallery during its summer exhibition, and another mobile was exhibited with the London Group. His first solo &#145;Exhibition of Mobiles&#146; was held at Gimpel Fils in 1950. The mobiles were mainly composed of slate and wood, often hand-painted different colours, hanging and supported on stands. The Festival of Britain of 1951 provided a great opportunity for architects, designers, and artists. Chadwick received three commissions: Jane Drew (partner and wife of Maxwell Fry) invited him to make a mobile for her Riverside Restaurant, Misha Black commissioned a piece for the Regatta Restaurant's garden, for which he made <span class="italic">Stabile (Cypress)</span>, and an Arts Council commission resulted in <span class="italic">Fisheater</span> (Tate Gallery, London). Chadwick realized that he would need to weld in order to create the latter two large, ambitious projects, and took a four-week welding course at the British Oxygen Company's welding school.<br>
<br>Chadwick was one of eight young sculptors included in &#145;New Aspects of British Sculpture&#146; at the twenty-sixth Venice Biennale in 1952, the so-called &#145;geometry of fear&#146; exhibition, the much quoted phrase used by Herbert Read in his introduction to the exhibition catalogue  (<span class="italic">New Aspects of British Sculpture</span>, British Council, 1952). Chadwick had now progressed from mobiles and stabiles: two of his &#145;balanced sculptures&#146; were included in this critically acclaimed exhibition, organized and toured by the British Council, which exposed Chadwick to an international audience. In 1953 Chadwick entered the Unknown Political Prisoner International Sculpture Competition. He departed from the spiky insect-like forms which had identified his work so far to create something more abstract and solid. He was given an honourable mention and won a prize. In his statement in <span class="italic">The New Decade: 22 European Painters and Sculptors</span> (1955), Chadwick said: &#145;these constructions have become armatures for the solid shapes&#151;the iron frames of the construction still delineate the mass and act as lines of tension&#146;. Until the mid-1950s Chadwick produced unique pieces, mainly using welded iron, but he now began to cast his work in bronze. <span class="italic">Teddy Boy and Girl</span> (1955) is an example of his new interest in pairs of human figures which became his main preoccupation, rather than birds and beasts.<br>
<br>In 1956 Chadwick represented Great Britain at the twenty-eighth Venice Biennale. Several pieces were made using stolit, a mixture of iron filings and gypsum that he used to fill the iron armature and that could be chiselled and filed down when dry. Several American private collectors and institutions lent work they had already acquired, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, which lent <span class="italic">Inner Eye</span> (1952). Chadwick, &#145;one of the revelations of the Biennale&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 24 June 1956), surprised some British critics by winning the international sculpture prize, beating Giacometti and others whose reputations were firmly established while Chadwick &#145;had not shown more than his paces&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, 19 June 1956). The British Council subsequently toured the exhibition around Europe, a version being shown at the Arts Council's gallery in London in 1957. Chadwick's first commercial solo exhibition in New York was held at the Saidenberg Gallery the same year. His success in Venice led to a number of commissions in Britain, Europe, and America. Nevertheless, his work was not always appreciated. In 1957 the Air League of the British Empire commissioned Chadwick to make a piece commemorating the first double crossing of the Atlantic by the R34 airship, to be placed outside Frederick Gibberd's long-haul terminal building at London Airport. However a heated public debate ensued, led by Lord Brabazon who likened Chadwick's proposal to &#145;a diseased haddock&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 15 July 1958). The commission, which Chadwick had developed from <span class="italic">The Stranger</span> (1954), was withdrawn.<br>
<br>In 1958 Chadwick bought the substantial &#145;Strawberry Hill gothick&#146; Lypiatt Park, near Stroud, Gloucestershire, which he restored and redesigned, and where he lived for the rest of his life. His first marriage having ended in divorce, on 27 April 1959 he married the 21-year-old Frances Mary Jamieson, daughter of Samuel Jamieson, radio engineer. They had two daughters, but separated, and Frances committed suicide in 1964.<br>
<br>In 1960 Chadwick had joined the Marlborough Gallery, initially with a contract. <span class="italic">Watchers</span> (1960), a group of three block-headed figures, began a new phase. He also began his <span class="italic">Elektra</span> series, sometimes highly polishing the bronze of the faceted surfaces. In 1962 he was invited to work in the Italsider SpA steelworks workshop at Cornegliano, before participating in the Festival dei Due Monde, Spoleto. There he created one of his most abstract works, <span class="italic">Two Winged Figures</span>, made to his specification, using steel plate. He also got to know David Smith and Alexander Calder, who were participating in the open-air sculpture project.<br>
<br>On 5 July 1965 Chadwick married (Yvonne) &Eacute;va Reiner, the 31-year-old daughter of Gabriel Etienne Reiner. They had one son. &Eacute;va helped catalogue Chadwick's work, put his affairs in order, and promoted his work, enabling him to dispense with a formal contract with a dealer, though he continued to exhibit at the Marlborough Gallery for many years. In 1971 the Chadwicks opened a foundry, allowing him to be involved in all stages of the casting of his work. His groups of seated or reclining figures or cloaked male and female couples were immediately identifiable and were his main preoccupation for the next two decades.<br>
<br>In the 1960s the spotlight moved away from Chadwick and some of his contemporaries to the &#145;new generation&#146; of sculptors in Britain, but his work was always in demand abroad, particularly in Europe and the United States, and he continued to lead a disciplined, &#145;metronomic&#146; life. In the 1980s he employed a specialist technician to enable him to realize large pieces in sheet-steel for Palm Beach airport, Florida, and for the Citro&euml;n factory at Le Ponant, near Paris. He was also invited to participate in a survey of sculpture during the Venice Biennale of 1988. In 1989 the Chadwick foundry was taken over by Rungwe Kingdon, who was later given the exclusive right to cast Chadwick's work. &Eacute;va Chadwick collaborated on a monograph with Dennis Farr, first published in 1990. In 1991 Chadwick was given a major survey exhibition by the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, covering his work from 1951 to 1991.<br>
<br>Chadwick was an attractive, tall, strong, bear-like man. At the height of his success he &#145;assumed a persona notably un-English in its rackety, carefree, demonstrative abandon&#146;, but in his studio &#145;during the long spells of solitary work &hellip; he has a melancholy and self-distrustful side&#146;  (B. Robertson, <span class="italic">Private View</span>, 1965, 90). Rather than analysing his work he preferred to pursue his own ideas and explore different techniques: he was not an intellectual. Throughout his career he was &#145;independent and self-sufficient to a very remarkable degree&#146;  (Bowness). Uninterested in the London art &#145;scene&#146;, he always welcomed visitors to Lypiatt Park, where he used his architectural background to create a beautiful, uncluttered environment in which to set off his work. Photographs of the interior by Lord Snowdon appeared in <span class="italic">Private View</span> (1965). Despite initially being against the idea of placing sculpture outside, where he felt it had to compete with nature, he gradually began to place work in his grounds during the 1970s. In 1988 he acquired extra land adjoining his own, where he sited more of his work. Never having been to art school, and having chosen not to teach in one, he did not have the camaraderie of his peers and possibly lacked confidence with fellow artists. When asked by Alan Bowness, director of the Tate Gallery, whom he would like to be present at a lunch to celebrate his seventieth birthday, Chadwick claimed that he had no friends to invite.<br>
<br>Chadwick's sight began to fail in 1996. He died of heart failure at Lypiatt Park on 25 April 2003 and was buried in the pinetum there. He was survived by his wife, &Eacute;va, their son Daniel (also a sculptor), and the three children of his earlier marriages. In September 2003 Tate Britain mounted a retrospective exhibition of his work, planned while he was alive.<br>
