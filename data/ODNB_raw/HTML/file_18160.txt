<span class="headword">Marsham, Sir  John</span>, first baronet  (1602&#150;1685), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 23 August 1602 in St Bartholomew's Close, west Smithfield, London, the second surviving son of Thomas Marsham (1556&#150;1625), alderman of London, descended from a Norfolk family, and his wife, Magdalen (1567&#150;1618), daughter of Richard Springham, merchant, of London. He attended Westminster School from 1617, and in 1619 matriculated from St John's College, Oxford, graduating BA and MA in 1623 and 1625 respectively.<br>
<br>Marsham travelled widely from 1625 to 1627, first in England and then in France, Italy, and Germany. In 1628 he was admitted a student at the Middle Temple, but in 1629 was again abroad, travelling in the Netherlands and France. He was present at the siege of Bois-le-Duc by the prince of Orange, and in September of that year was in attendance on Sir Thomas Edmondes, sent to Fontainebleau to ratify a peace treaty between France and England.<br>
<br>In 1630 Marsham purchased Whorne's Place in Cuxton, near Rochester in Kent, and on 13 January 1631 married Elizabeth Hammond (<i>bap</i>. 1612, <i>d</i>. 1689), daughter of Sir William Hammond of St Albans, Nonington, Kent. They had ten children. During the 1630s Marsham purchased other properties in the Rochester area. In February 1638 he was appointed one of the six clerks in chancery, and later the same year was presented with the freedom of the city of Rochester.<br>
<br>The civil war of the 1640s caused a reversal in Marsham's fortunes. He followed the king to Oxford, with the result that he was deprived by the parliamentarians of his chancery post and had his estates sequestrated&#151;losing, according to his son Robert, around &pound;60,000. He was eventually allowed to compound for his estates for the sum of &pound;356 6<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>. and retired to Cuxton, devoting himself to his antiquarian studies.<br>
<br>Marsham was MP for Rochester in the Convention Parliament which restored the monarchy in 1660. He was knighted on 5 July 1660, was able to resume his position in the six clerks' office, and was created a baronet in August 1663.<br>
<br>Years of private study at Cuxton had already borne fruit in Marsham's <span class="italic">Diatriba chronologica</span>, a treatise on the dating of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, published in London in 1649. About 1665 he brought out a much longer work, incorporating most of the <span class="italic">Diatriba</span>, entitled <span class="italic">Chronicus canon Aegyptiacus, Ebraicus, Graecus et disquisitiones</span>, dealing with the dating of ancient history. A note in a surviving copy states that 500 copies of this edition were destroyed in September 1666 in the fire of London, in which Sir John's library also suffered. Marsham profited by this setback to enlarge his work. An expanded edition of the <span class="italic">Chronicus canon</span> came out in 1672. The 1672 version subsequently appeared in two foreign editions, one at Leipzig in 1676 and the other at Franeker, in Friesland, Netherlands, in 1696.<br>
<br>Another early work had been the preface, entitled &#145;Propulaion&#146;, to the first volume of Sir William Dugdale's <span class="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum</span> of 1655. The seriousness of the seventeenth-century scholar is here underlined by the copious references, of which there are more than three hundred in a mere thirty-two pages. Marsham was admired by many European scholars for his knowledge of history, chronology, and languages: all three of his published works, and several left in manuscript at the time of his death, were written in Latin, with the occasional note or comment in Greek. His &#145;Pandectae nostri temporis&#146;, annals for the years 1600&#150;85, is in the Bodleian Library.<br>
<br>But Sir John's interests were not limited to antiquarian matters. The family archive contains papers bearing on the education of his sons, and towards the end of his life Marsham was concerned in a scheme to provide the towns of Rochester, Strood, and Chatham with fresh water. This required a channel to be cut, partly through his own lands; 2 miles of this had been completed and an act of parliament obtained for the remainder, when the scheme was brought to a sudden end by Marsham's death. This occurred on 25 May 1685 at Bushy Hall in Hertfordshire, the home of his younger son, Robert. Sir John's body was brought back to Cuxton and buried in Cuxton church on 3 June 1685. Of his many children only two sons and a daughter survived him. The elder son, Sir John, the second baronet, inherited Whorne's Place and an interest in history, particularly English history, although he never published. Robert, the younger son, succeeded to his father's position as one of the six clerks in 1680 and was knighted in 1681, becoming in 1696 the fourth baronet and ultimately father of the first Baron Romney.<br>
