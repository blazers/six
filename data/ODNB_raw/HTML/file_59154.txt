<span class="headword">Garrett,  Newson</span>  (1812&#150;1893), <span class="occ">maltster and brewer</span>, was born on 31 July 1812 at Leiston, Suffolk, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59151/', "Richard Garrett (1779&#150;1837)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59150/', "Garrett family")</script>], agricultural engineer, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of John Balls, engineer, of Hethersett, Norfolk. Educated at Grundisburgh School, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, Newson had little interest in his studies.<br>
<br>An ambitious young man, determined not to be overshadowed by his eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59152/', "Richard Garrett (1807&#150;1866)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59150/', "Garrett family")</script>]&#151;who was to inherit the family business&#151;Newson Garrett subsequently moved to London. Here he was befriended by Richard's father-in-law, John Dunnell, landlord of The Beehive inn, Crawford Street, Marylebone. On 5 April 1834 Garrett married his younger daughter, Louisa (1813&#150;1903) and for seven years managed Dunnell's pawnbrokers shops; first at 1 Commercial Road, Whitechapel, then, from 1838, at 142 Long Acre, off St Martin's Lane, Westminster. However, after the death in 1838 of their third child, Garrett decided to return to the healthier climate of Suffolk. Three years later he purchased the Snape corn and coal merchant's business and shipping interests of Robert Fennel and settled his wife and young family at The Uplands, in Aldeburgh.<br>
<br>Newson Garrett's business grew apace. Within three years he was sending about 17,000 quarters of barley to London and Newcastle. He was soon building his own barges and in 1848 was appointed agent for Lloyds. He constructed a gasworks, acquired a local brickworks and built numerous cottages. In 1852 he built Alde House, an impressive mansion overlooking the town of Aldeburgh (complete with ice-house and turkish bath), and two years later designed and built maltings at Snape Bridge. In 1859 the capacity of the maltings was doubled, and the adjoining Bridge House, the family's winter residence during the malting season, completed. Despite his substantial shipping interests&#151;he owned half the twenty-four ships in the port&#151;Garrett was keenly aware of the potential of the railways and, by guaranteeing regular freight, persuaded the East Suffolk Railway Company to extend a private line to his maltings. Finally, to consolidate his interests, he became a partner in the Bow brewery, London. When in 1882 the brewing company (one of the earliest to take company status) was registered as Smith, Garrett &amp; Co. Ltd, with a capital of &pound;450,000, Newson and his son Edmund (who managed the brewery), were among its first directors. Shortly after, the malting business of Newson Garrett &amp; Son was similarly incorporated, with Garrett and his youngest son, George (the manager) as directors.<br>
<br>Newson Garrett, fair-haired and blue-eyed, was strikingly handsome, self-confident, and impetuous. Indeed, according to one contemporary, &#145;none of his virtues were passive&#146;  (Manton, 29). Intense rivalry with his brother Richard, fuelled by the shift in Garrett's political allegiance from Conservative to Liberal radical, culminated in a bitter rift. Despite the fact that their wives were sisters, they are said not to have spoken to each other for thirty years. Newson Garrett's involvement in civic life was equally stormy. He served the Aldeburgh corporation (a self-elected body until 1885) as burgess and, for forty years, as bailiff. Many of the older members resented the pushy newcomer; in particular his altercations with the rector of Aldeburgh and frequent defection to the Union Chapel were both a scandal and delight to the town. Yet he was regarded with affection and respect. When, following the report on the 1880 <span class="roman">Municipal Corporation Act</span>, the corporation was reformed, Garrett was elected its first mayor, serving again in 1886 and 1890 and as alderman, 1888&#150;93. He was also Aldeburgh's first county councillor and alderman, 1889&#150;92. He was a justice of the peace, commanding-lieutenant of the local volunteer company, branch-chairman of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, and founder of the Adair Lodge of freemasons.<br>
<br>Newson and Louisa Garrett's large family of ten surviving children inherited intellect and determination in full measure. Three of their six daughters achieved notable firsts: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30406/', "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson")</script> was Britain's first legally qualified woman doctor; <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33096/', "Millicent Fawcett")</script>, first president of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies; and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53628/', "Agnes Garrett")</script>, London's first woman interior designer. Notably, their brother Sam, president of the Law Society, was the first to employ female pupils. Among Garrett's grandchildren, Millicent's daughter, Phillippa, and Alice's son, Philip Cowell, were both senior wrangler at Cambridge University. To them all, Newson gave his wholehearted support and was fiercely proud of their success. At every opportunity he gathered them round him. Typically, he laid out the 35 acres surrounding Alde House as a private estate of large houses and gardens for his children. Newson Garrett died at Alde House on 4 May 1893 following a heart attack and was buried four days later in the family vault at Aldeburgh churchyard. The maltings at Snape subsequently formed the venue for the Aldeburgh music festival founded by Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears.<br>
