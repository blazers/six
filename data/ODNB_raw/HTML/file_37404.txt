<span class="headword">Eworth,  Hans</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1574), <span class="occ">painter</span>, of Netherlandish origin, is first recorded as a freeman of the Antwerp guild of St Luke in 1540. He is listed there as Jan Eeuworts, and his name appears variously in other sources as Ewottes, Eywooddes, and even possibly Suete, among other forms. Probably attracted to England in the aftermath of the death of Hans Holbein, in 1543, he is first recorded in London in 1549. On 19 October 1550 he was granted letters of denization, and he is listed thereafter in various City parishes, the last being St Bride's, in the ward of Faringdon Without, where he was described in 1571 as &#145;Haunce Evance, pictorer, a denizen, borne in Anwarpe, came into the realm about xxviii yeres past, Douch&#146;  (Cust, 5). In 1572 he was brought in by the musician Alfonso Ferrabosco to design the tournament staged to greet the French embassy in June of that year. Payments indicate that he continued to be employed by the revels office for the next two years.<br>
<br>It is known that Eworth can be associated with a long series of signed pictures bearing the monogram &#145;HE&#146;. In the eighteenth century this was wrongly equated with Lucas de Heere and it was only in 1913 that Lionel Cust made the connection with Eworth, thanks to his listing as a painter in the inventory made in 1590 of the pictures belonging to John, first Baron Lumley. Some twenty-five paintings have so far emerged either signed or as pendants to signed ones. About a dozen more are firmly attributable. The earliest, <span class="italic">A Turk on Horseback</span> (priv. coll.), is dated 1549 and the latest, <span class="italic">Allegory of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</span> (Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen), 1570. Among them are subject pictures but in the main they are portraits, including a major group of Mary I, to whom Eworth acted as court painter, albeit without any official status. The most important of these is dated 1554 (Society of Antiquaries, London). Many but by no means all of his sitters were adherents of the old faith, including Mary Neville, Baroness Dacre (painted twice, 1559 and undated; NPG and National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa), Nicholas Heath, archbishop of York (1566; NPG), Anthony Browne, first Viscount Montague (1569; NPG), Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, and his brother Charles, earl of Lennox (1562 and 1563; both Royal Collection), and Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk, with his second wife (1562 and 1563; both priv. coll.). It is noticeable that the young Elizabeth I did not sit for him; there was a sharp decline in royal portraiture during the 1560s.<br>
<br>Eworth was the most distinguished foreign painter to work in England in the Tudor period after Holbein. His portraiture, like Holbein's, is remarkable for its wide variation in scale and included miniatures; small-, two-thirds-, and life-scale; and embraced everything from head and shoulders to full-length. His style stemmed from that of Jan van Scorel, using a strong, three-dimensional rendering of the features, and modified by late Holbein with its concern for a dazzling and exact record of magnificent dress and jewels. His work has a high degree of finish and gloss. Although some of his portraits include backgrounds, particularly his early work, he gradually evolved a formula of placing the sitter against a plain ground upon which the shadow of the figure was cast and the age and date inserted in an idiosyncratic script. Fine examples of his work are in the National Portrait Gallery and the Tate Collection, London. Eworth died in 1574.<br>
