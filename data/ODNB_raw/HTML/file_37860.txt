<span class="headword">Potter,  Vincent</span>  (<em>c.</em>1614&#150;1661?), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and regicide</span>, was born, apparently in Warwickshire, of unknown parents. Potter was an original member of the Massachusetts Bay Company, and in mid-May 1635 he sailed out of London on the <i>Elizabeth and Ann</i>, bound for New England. In midsummer this vessel arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, where Potter settled and was employed as a soldier at the nearby Castle Island Fort for &pound;10 per year. He probably fought in the Pequot War, and though his wife is unknown he had a brother-in-law named Thomas Fowle residing in Boston before the civil war. In June 1639 Potter prepared to return to England, placing his apprentices with other settlers.<br>
<br>Potter set sail for England from Massachusetts Bay in the <i>Fellowship</i> on 10 October 1639. A fellow passenger later recalled his quibbling over a shipboard sermon  (Lindholdt, xix). From a devotional text reportedly carried by him throughout the civil wars, Potter was apparently a strict puritan. The ship landed in Devon on 24 November after a passage marred by cold weather: &#145;our deck in a morning ore-spread with hoaries frost, and dangling Isickles hung upon the Ropes&#146;  (Lindholdt, 25). Potter continued to trade with New England until the outbreak of civil war when he joined the parliamentarian army. Robert Greville, second Baron Brooke, commissioned Potter a captain of horse on 30 January 1643 at Warwick. After Brooke's death at Lichfield, Potter continued to serve under the parliamentarian Warwickshire county committee in Colonel William Purefoy's regiment of horse. The assessments of the villages of Snitterfield and Hatton were among those assigned to maintain his troop, which on one occasion ventured into Oxfordshire to support Sir William Waller's army at Abingdon. On 5 December 1644 Potter was among the 200 horse that burned the house of Lionel Cranfield, earl of Middlesex, at Milcote, Warwickshire, allegedly to prevent the royalists from garrisoning it.<br>
<br>Potter gave up his troop on 25 July 1645 and succeeded his brother Captain John Potter as parliamentary commissioner to the army on 14 July. These commissioners were accountable to the committee for the army chaired by Robert Scawen MP. They were intermediaries between parliament and the New Model Army and, if required, were empowered to stop soldiers' pay. Potter was extremely diligent in his duties and joined his new colleague, Thomas Herbert, at Basingstoke on 10 October 1645. He purchased horses for Sir Thomas Fairfax and arranged supplies for Oliver Cromwell's leaguer before Basing House. Potter was a strict disciplinarian and repeatedly condemned the practice of free quarter, pointing out that if it continued, the New Model Army would fall &#145;Parallel to the Enimy, who in nothing more then free Quarter has forfeited the affeccons of the Countrys&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 28/129/10). On 5 November he wrote to Edward Massey requiring him to discipline his plundering troops who had looted some &#145;poore men but well affected to our Armies&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 28/129/10). Potter's efficient administration of supplies and his realization that the people would favour the side that most refrained from plunder and free quarter helped ensure the speedy success of the New Model Army's western campaign.<br>
<br>Potter subsequently became the foremost administrator in settling army pay arrears, formulating &#145;Potter's lists&#146; of former soldiers. He continued as army commissioner during the second civil war, and after the battle of St Fagans on 8 May 1648 he was appointed a county commissioner for Pembrokeshire. Potter attended the high court of justice that tried Charles I on seventeen occasions and signed the king's death warrant [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70599/', "Regicides")</script>]. On 6 March 1649 he also signed the death warrants of the royalist peers Arthur Capel, first Baron Capel of Hadham, James Hamilton, first duke of Hamilton, Henry Rich, first earl of Holland, and George Goring, first earl of Norwich. Having been promoted to a colonelcy by June 1649, he co-ordinated the receipt of provisions for Cromwell's Irish campaign. On 17 August he was appointed with Herbert to state the accounts of officers of the Train during service in Ireland, under the same conditions as they had in England.<br>
<br>In June 1650, after his return to England, Potter arranged Cromwell's travel northwards to organize the forthcoming campaign against the Scots. He was dispatched on 27 August to join Cromwell in Scotland, empowered to superintend the issuing and receipt of provisions to each of the regimental accounts. On 5 March 1651, on Cromwell's personal recommendation, Colonel Potter was appointed commissioner for improving lands in Scotland brought under the power of the English forces there; and on 29 April 1652 Potter and Herbert were commissioned to Irish affairs once more.<br>
<br>In 1660 a Robert Howcott claimed his reward for assisting in the arrests of Potter and his fellow regicide John Downes. Potter was tried as a regicide on 16 October 1660. At his trial Potter declared, &#145;I will deny nothing; I confess the fact, but did not contrive it&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 5.1214&#150;15). Owing to intense pain from kidney stones Potter complained he could not speak: &#145;I am not in a condition to declare what I know, and would speak; I am mighty full of pain &hellip; I beseech you let me go to ease myself&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 5.1214&#150;15) but the court refused him permission to urinate. Found guilty, he was sentenced to death and imprisoned in the Tower of London. He escaped the horror of being hanged, drawn, and quartered as he died there, probably in 1661, before his sentence could be carried out.<br>
