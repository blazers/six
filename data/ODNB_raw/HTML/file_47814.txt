<span class="headword">Pearse,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1759, <em>d.</em> 1836), <span class="occ">clothier and financier</span>, was baptized at St Margaret's, Lothbury, London, on 19 December 1759, the eldest of the three sons of Nicholas Pearse (<i>d</i>. 1795), clothier, and his wife, Sarah (<i>d</i>. in or after 1770). Nicholas Pearse traded as Pearse and Bowden, Blackwell Hall factors, with premises at 41 Lothbury, City of London, and country houses at Woodford, Essex, and Heddington, Wiltshire. John Pearse was taken into partnership in Pearse and Bowden in 1780. He married, on 31 January 1787, Anne (<i>d</i>. in or after 1835), daughter and coheir of John Phillimore, silk merchant, of 15 New Broad Street, London; three sons and three daughters were born of the marriage. Phillimore died early in 1795, leaving &pound;35,000 to Anne and &pound;10,000 to John, who inherited another &pound;30,000 when his own father died later that year.<br>
<br>Before this considerable increase in his material fortune Pearse had become involved with the Bank of England, where he served as a director (1790&#150;91, 1793&#150;8), as deputy governor (1799&#150;1810), and as governor (1810&#150;12), thereafter reverting to director until 1828. When the bank was confronted by the threat of invasion by Napoleon's troops in 1803, a 400-strong volunteer militia was raised from among the employees, which Pearse captained, and the important books and records were transferred to country houses for safe keeping; from 1806 to 1816 Pearse's home, Chilton Lodge, Chilton Foliat, Wiltshire (near Hungerford, Berkshire), was so used. From 1826 until his death in 1836 he was a governor of the Van Diemen's Land Company which traded with the colony of Van Diemen's Land.<br>
<br>Pearse and his family were also employed in the Sun Fire insurance office. His father was a manager from 1767 to 1795, he himself acted as one from 1785 until his death, and his brother Brice Pearse (1770&#150;1842), of Monkhams in Essex, from 1803 to 1842. Brice's son and grandson continued the connection until 1875.<br>
<br>Pearse came into the public arena by signing the London merchants' declaration of loyalty to the administration of William Pitt the younger in 1795. Two years later he gave &pound;10,000 through the bank and &pound;1000 in a private capacity to the loyalty loan. His dealings as a clothier were denounced as corrupt profiteering in the House of Commons, where it was claimed that he had secured the contract to supply army greatcoats by undercutting his competitors with a bid of 16<i>s</i>., such garments being inevitably of inferior quality&#151;&#145;when he had signed the contract he ran off to Fenchurch Street, to a slopseller there, and agreed to pay him at the rate of 13s each&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 25 June 1808, 3b). Pearse's brothers, Nicholas and Brice, joined him in business, first at Lothbury and later at Long Acre, trading as J. and B. Pearse.<br>
<br>Chilton Foliat estate was acquired about 1806 and in 1807 Pearse bought the manor of Hidden to add to it. In 1835 he and his wife Anne settled both holdings on their son John, but are said to have sold them on later that year to the Revd Sir William Henry Cooper  (<span class="italic">VCH Berkshire</span>, 4.193). Pearse also bought the manor of Hungerford Englefield in 1811.<br>
<br>Pearse's ambitions were not bounded by finance and commerce in the City of London. In 1818 he became MP for Devizes in Wiltshire, holding the seat until 1832 as a respected constituency figure and speaking regularly in the House of Commons where he was a recognized expert on financial matters. In 1819 he was consulted on the resumption of cash payments, and he supported post-war repressive measures in the autumn of that year. According to Thomas Moore he was &#145;a good hearty jolly man of the world; knows everybody; was intimate with Sheridan&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>). He died on 21 July 1836 at Craig's Court, Charing Cross, Westminster, London, leaving instructions that he was to be buried at Chilton Foliat.<br>
