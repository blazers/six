<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Logan,  James</span>  (1674&#150;1751), <span class="occ">colonial official and scholar</span>, was born on 20 October 1674 in Lurgan, co. Armagh, to Patrick Logan and Isabel Hume. Patrick Logan was a minister and an MA of Edinburgh University, who after becoming a Quaker had attempted to make a living as a schoolmaster. James knew Latin, Greek, and Hebrew when he was apprenticed at the age of thirteen to Edward Webb, a linen draper in Dublin, but he remained there only six months. During the conflicts in Ireland following the revolution of 1688 the Logan family fled to Scotland, and Patrick soon became master of the Friar Meeting-House Quaker school in Bristol. When the family returned to Ireland in 1693, James, aged nineteen, became a schoolmaster. While teaching he also perfected his Latin and Greek, learned French, Italian, and some Spanish, and, by studying William Leybourn's <span class="italic">Cursus mathematicus</span>, achieved knowledge of mathematics and astronomy, and built a library of more than 700 volumes. Discontented with being a schoolmaster, he sought to migrate to Jamaica and, when his mother objected, sold his library and became a linen merchant in Bristol. In 1699 William Penn hired him as secretary to accompany him on his second trip to Pennsylvania.<br>
<br>Logan lived with Penn and his family at the Slate Roof House in Philadelphia until the proprietor moved to his estate at Pennsbury. Penn put Logan in charge of organizing land policy, a necessary task since proceeds from quitrents and sales would help pay the proprietor's debts. With the aid of a new law regularizing land sales, Logan brought order to land policy but he found collecting money a frustrating task. Logan continued as the Penns' business agent for nearly thirty years, a role that was bound to bring conflicts with the settlers. Logan helped Penn negotiate the charter of privileges, though he later criticized that document for giving the assembly too much power and the council too little. Logan's ideal of government was of a balance of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, and he feared that Pennsylvania had too much democracy. He did not bother to hide his contempt for the &#145;mob&#146;, and his rather supercilious manner did not endear him to the people.<br>
<br>Before returning to England, Penn named Logan clerk of the council, secretary of the province, and one of three commissioners of property. Logan would serve on the council from 1702 to 1747. His new responsibilities brought him only &pound;100 per year, so he began trading on his own account. Unable to make direct remittances from land sales to Penn in England, Logan began to invest such moneys in Pennsylvania commodities which could be sold elsewhere. By 1706 Logan had raised about &pound;8000 in Pennsylvania money for Penn, but the debts of the proprietor to the Ford family amounted to &pound;30,000.<br>
<br>As Penn's primary agent in the colony, Logan became involved in political disputes with royal officials when Quaker lawyer David Lloyd questioned the Admiralty courts. Royal officials sought to make Pennsylvania a royal colony by proving the incompetence of proprietary government. Logan became the primary opponent of Lloyd, who emerged as a leader in the assembly's quest for power over land titles and fines at the expense of the proprietor. Logan also had to counter the politically disastrous policies of the new governor, John Evans, who issued a false alarm of a French attack in 1706 and sought to tax Philadelphia shipping to pay for a fort in Delaware. Other disputes centred on the rights of the assembly to set its own schedule for meeting and adjourning, and on whether the governor or assembly had the power to establish courts. The assembly attempted to impeach Logan, and thereby weaken Penn. The first trial failed when Governor Evans refused to preside as judge because the council was not equivalent to the House of Lords. When the new governor, Charles Gookin, argued that Logan's membership on the council made him immune, the impeachment ended, and in 1709 Logan sailed for England.<br>
<br>Logan's first two courtships failed because of his lack of property. In Philadelphia he had wooed Ann, the daughter of merchant Edward Shippen. Ann was also courted by Thomas Story, a wealthy Quaker minister and lawyer. Ann preferred Logan but her family preferred Story, and she married him. The disappointment was made public when the Philadelphia monthly meeting in 1703 arbitrated a resulting dispute between Logan and Story. In England Logan engaged the affections of Judith Crowley, but her family objected to his lack of wealth, and she, like Shippen, refused to disobey them. Determined now to gain wealth, Logan began buying at cheap prices the rights to unoccupied lands of Quakers who had not come to Pennsylvania. Logan ultimately married Sarah Read (<i>d</i>. 1754), a pious but not well-educated Quaker, on 9 December 1714. Their four children resembled their mother in piety, but did not share their father's intellectual acumen.<br>
<br>On his return to Pennsylvania in 1711 Logan engaged in the fur trade, using tactics described by Frederick Tolles as &#145;hard, venturesome, unscrupulous if necessary&#146;, as he got fur traders into debt and supplied them with rum for the Native Americans&#151;even though the colony's laws and the Quaker meeting forbade selling alcohol to the American Indians  (Tolles, 90). By 1715 he was sending &pound;1000 in furs per year to England. He called the wagons for transporting the furs from his trading post on Conestoga Creek &#145;Conestoga wagons&#146;, and this continued to be the way Americans named the hooped, canvas-covered wagons used for westward migration.<br>
<br>Logan observed his first negotiations with the Native Americans at the gatherings at Pennsbury in 1701. When the War of the Spanish Succession broke out in America, Logan sought to create a common British Indian policy to wean American Indians away from the French, and saw keeping the loyalty of the Five Nations of the Iroquois as a key element in British imperial strategy. He also faced problems with settler encroachment on Indian lands. Anticipating changes that would not take place for three decades, in 1731 Logan composed a memorial to the British government asking for a unified command so that the colonists could effectively deal with the Indians and the French.<br>
<br>After Penn's stroke in 1711 and death in 1718, Logan continued to serve the Penn family loyally. He did extensive research on the disputed border between Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, finding maps to demonstrate what the crown thought was the border in 1681. When the Pennsylvania governor, William Keith (1717&#150;26), ignored the council's advice before approving laws, and attempted to survey land and claim a copper mine for himself, Logan opposed him. Another issue was paper money, which Keith favoured but Isaac Norris opposed. Logan supported a modest circulation with sound backing, but feared depreciation if too much were issued. He approved of the assembly's issuing &pound;15,000. In 1723 he returned to London to consult Hannah Penn, but before leaving he used his position as judge to lecture the people on the benefits of a mixed government. Logan returned with new instructions from Penn's widow, which Keith ignored. Instead Keith, aided by David Lloyd, commenced a pamphlet war with Logan and supporters of the proprietors. Keith and Lloyd won elections until Patrick Gordon arrived as new governor in 1726. When Keith tried to use the assembly as a new power base, an alliance of Logan, Norris, and even Lloyd defeated him. Keith's leaving Pennsylvania and David Lloyd's death in 1731 quieted political passions.<br>
<br>Logan, now tired of supporting the proprietors, tried to persuade the sons of William Penn to come to Pennsylvania to look after their own interests, and Thomas Penn came to the colony in 1732. In January 1728 a fall broke a bone that did not heal properly, leaving Logan disabled. He became chief justice of the Pennsylvania supreme court (1731&#150;9) and, after Governor Gordon's death in 1736, became the executive of the colony by virtue of his position as president of the council.<br>
<br>Although Logan excelled at negotiating with American Indians, their confidence that he would treat them with the same care for justice as William Penn seems, in retrospect, misplaced. He co-operated with Thomas Penn in what was later known as the &#145;walking purchase&#146;, whereby the Lennai Lenape Indians lost a substantial amount of land by what many historians label a dubious interpretation of a previous purchase made by William Penn. Logan called upon the more powerful Five Nations, who claimed a kind of suzerainty over the region, to support his interpretation of the treaty and coerce the dwindling Lennai Lenape into accepting it. His last negotiation with the Indians, which occurred in 1742 when a delegation for the Five Nations visited Stenton, led in 1744 to a treaty at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, by which they pledged to support the British.<br>
<br>Logan, contrary to Quaker beliefs, was not a strict pacifist, at least not since his first journey to Pennsylvania. He believed there was little difference between a magistrate's use of force and a defensive war. Because he thought Quaker principles were incompatible with government, he had advised William Penn to sell the right to government. Seeing a coming imperial war with France, in 1741 at the Philadelphia yearly meeting (an annual gathering of Friends from Pennsylvania, Delaware, and West New Jersey) Logan sent a treatise justifying war and seeking to persuade Quakers to withdraw from government. Quakers' successful pursuit of wealth, he argued, made Pennsylvania a tempting target. The treatise had no immediate effect, but set a series of principles that would be considered in later wars.<br>
<br>Logan never lost his passion for learning and book collecting, being interested in astronomy, biology, optics, and numismatics as well as Greek and Latin classics. He collected a library of over 3000 volumes, which he bequeathed to the city of Philadelphia. He taught himself fluxions (calculus) by reading Newton's <span class="italic">Principia mathematica</span>. Logan conducted scientific experiments on the sexuality of plants, and his results were published by the Royal Society and praised by Linnaeus. Robert Brown later named a genus after Logan, <i>Logania</i>, which in turn was employed to form the family name Loganiaceae. He had discussions with and opened his library to young scientists, including John Bartram, Thomas Godfrey, and Benjamin Franklin. Logan defended Godfrey's claim to having invented the quadrant against John Hadley, and introduced Bartram's work to Linnaeus. Logan also carried on a learned correspondence on many subjects with such diverse scholars as Peter Collinson, Cadwallader Colden, and William Jones. Like many scientists of his time, Logan believed that reason could discover a cosmic order and that science helped religion by describing the works of God. Logan died on 31 October 1751 at his home, Stenton, Germantown, Pennsylvania, and was buried in the Friends' burial-ground, Arch Street, Philadelphia.<br>
