<span class="headword">Way, Sir  Gregory Holman Bromley</span>  (1776&#150;1844), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at London on 28 December 1776, was fifth son of Benjamin Way (1740&#150;1808) FRS of Denham Place, Buckinghamshire, MP for Bridport in 1765, and of his wife, Elizabeth Anne (1746&#150;1825), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6188/', "William Cooke (1711&#150;1797)")</script>, provost of King's College, Cambridge. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28905/', "Lewis Way (1772&#150;1840)")</script> was his elder brother. His grandfather, Lewis Way (<i>d</i>. 1771), director of the South Sea Company, the descendant of an old west-country family, first settled in Buckinghamshire. His aunt Abigail was the wife of John Baker Holroyd, first earl of Sheffield.<br>
<br>Way entered the army as ensign in the 26th (Cameronian) regiment of foot in 1797, was captured by French privateers on his way to his regiment in Canada, and was a prisoner in France for a year before he was exchanged. He was promoted lieutenant in the 35th foot on 3 November 1799, and sailed with it in the expedition under General Pigot on 28 March 1800 for the Mediterranean. Arriving at Malta in June, he took part in the successful siege of Valletta. He returned to England in 1802, was promoted captain in the 35th foot on 13 August 1802, and shortly after was placed on half pay on reduction of that regiment.<br>
<br>Way was brought in as captain of the 5th foot on 20 January 1803, and, after serving in the Channel Islands, embarked with the 5th in the expedition under Lord Cathcart for the liberation of Hanover in 1805; but he was wrecked off the Texel, and he was taken prisoner by the Dutch. After his exchange he sailed at the end of October 1806 in the expedition, under Major-General Robert Craufurd, which arrived at Monte Video in the beginning of June 1807, joining the force under General John Whitelocke, of which Way was appointed assistant quartermaster-general. At the storming of Buenos Aires, Way led the right wing of the infantry brigade. He returned to England after the disastrous surrender.<br>
<br>Way was promoted major in the 29th foot on 25 February 1808. He served under Sir Brent Spencer off Cadiz, and with him joined Sir Arthur Wellesley's army, landing in Mondego Bay, Portugal, on 3 August. He took part in the battle of Roli&ccedil;a on 17 August, when, on gaining the plateau with a few men and officers of the 29th, he, when charged by the enemy, was rescued from the bayonet of a French grenadier by General Brenier, and made a prisoner. He was exchanged in time to take part in the operations in Portugal when Sir Arthur Wellesley returned in April 1809. He commanded the light infantry of Brigadier-General R. Stewart's brigade, which led the advance of the British army, and was present in the actions of the passage of the Vouga on 10 May and the heights of Grijon the following day, at the passage of the Douro and capture of Porto on the 12th, and in the subsequent pursuit of Soult's army.<br>
<br>At the battle of Talavera on the night of 27 July, Way took part with his regiment, under Major-General Hill, in the repulse of the French attack on the heights on the left of the British position. He was at the battle of Busaco on 27 September 1810, and at the battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811, when, on the fall of his lieutenant-colonel, he succeeded to command of the 29th foot during the action. He was himself, in charging with his regiment, shot through the body and his left arm fractured at the shoulder joint by a musket shot. He was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel on 30 May 1811, and on 4 July was gazetted to command the 29th foot.<br>
<br>On his return to England in 1812 with the remnants of the 29th, about a hundred effective men, Way by considerable exertion reformed the corps, and embarked for the Peninsula in 1813. In 1814, however, the effect of climate and wounds compelled him to return to England, when he was placed on the half pay list of the 22nd foot. He was knighted the same year, was awarded a &pound;200 wound annuity, and received permission to become knight commander of the Portuguese order of the Tower and Sword. On relinquishing the command of the 29th he was presented by his officers with a valuable piece of plate.<br>
<br>Way married, on 19 May 1815, Marianne, daughter of John Weyland, of Woodeaton, Oxfordshire, and Woodrising, Norfolk; they had no children. In 1815 Way was made a CB, military division, and was appointed to the staff as deputy adjutant-general in north Britain. He was promoted colonel in the army on 19 July 1821. On the abolition of his staff appointment he was nominated, on 7 November 1822, colonel of the 3rd Royal Veteran battalion, which was disbanded in 1826, when he was placed on half pay. He was promoted major-general on 22 July 1830, and lieutenant-general on 23 November 1841, and was made colonel of the 1st West India regiment on 21 November 1843. He died at Brighton on 19 February 1844, and was buried in the family vault at Denham church, Buckinghamshire.<br>
