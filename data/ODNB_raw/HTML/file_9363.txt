<span class="headword">Ferrers,  John  de</span>, first Lord Ferrers of Chartley  (1271&#150;1312), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9366/', "Robert de Ferrers, earl of Derby (c.1239&#150;1279)")</script>, and his wife, Eleanor, daughter of Humphrey (V) de Bohun. He was born at Cardiff on 20 June 1271, two years after his father had been dispossessed of his earldom, by a procedure of dubious legality, because of his rebellious activities even after the defeat of Montfort. The bulk of the lands of the earldom of Derby had been given to Henry III's second son, Edmund, earl of Lancaster. From his father John inherited only the manor of Chartley, Staffordshire, which the former had been able to recover in 1275. He also inherited, from his grandmother, Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1281), the manors of Southoe, Keyston, and part of Eynesbury, Huntingdonshire, delivered when the king took his homage in 1293. In 1294 he acquired Bugbrooke, Northamptonshire, as the heir of his cousin Cecily, who had married Godfrey de Beaumont. Between 1298 and 1300 he married Hawise, daughter of Sir Robert de Mucegros and widow of William Mortimer, who brought him lands in Somerset, Gloucestershire, Berkshire, and Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>Ferrers's early service to Edward I is evident from his attendance on the king's daughters Eleanor and Margaret on their journeys overseas in, respectively, 1294 and 1297. The latter year saw a crisis develop over the king's increasing exactions to pay for his campaign in France, and his summons to military landholders to perform their service overseas. The identification of Ferrers as a leading malcontent stems largely from the fact that he and the earls of Norfolk and Hereford are the only three men specifically named in the document known as <span class="italic">De tallagio</span>&#151;a draft of articles that the king's opponents wished to see added to <span class="roman">Magna Carta</span>. His appearance there, however, may simply be due to a continuing recognition of his comital status, and Ferrers &#145;cannot be shown to have played a particularly active part in the events of 1297&#146;  (Prestwich, <span class="italic">Edward I</span>, 433).<br>
<br>Ferrers was clearly more concerned with his personal inheritance, and resorted to eccentric methods in his attempt to wrest it from the earls of Lancaster. First, <i>c</i>.1297, he sought permission from Pope Boniface VIII to obtain contributions from the clergy in order to raise &pound;50,000 to redeem his lands from Lancaster. Nothing was ever likely to come of such a scheme, and Ferrers's second gambit, perhaps early in 1300, was an appeal to the same pope against Thomas, earl of Lancaster (who had succeeded his father Edmund in 1296), for &pound;20,000 as loss of income from estates comprising the earldom. On 24 January 1300 the archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Winchelsey, wrote to Cardinal Matteo d'Acquasparta, asking the cardinal to assist Ferrers, whom he described as his &#145;special friend&#146;  (Graham, 566&#150;7). The pope delegated Winchelsey as sole judge of the matter, and the archbishop summoned Lancaster to proceedings that apparently took place on 30 May and 27 June, whereupon the case was referred back to Rome. In the meantime, however, Lancaster had secured a royal writ of prohibition against the hearing in court Christian of a plea concerning lay fees, and this was delivered both to Winchelsey and to Ferrers. Lancaster sued Winchelsey for the notional sum of &pound;100,000, in a case that was adjourned term by term until the end of the reign. Ferrers himself subsequently appeared before the king's court, but suffered no long-term punishment for his imaginative, if fruitless, action. In 1307, with the support of the prince of Wales, Ferrers accused the king's treasurer, Walter Langton, of champerty (supporting a plaintiff in court in return for a share of the profits of successful litigation) in cases concerning Newbottle and Bugbrooke, Northamptonshire. Langton obtained a royal pardon, which Ferrers claimed was a forgery. The cases were eventually subsumed in the wider action against Langton in Edward II's reign.<br>
<br>Despite these signs of hostility towards the king Ferrers was summoned to parliament from February 1299 to October 1311. He served in Scotland in 1298, 1301, 1303, and 1306, on the latter occasion as constable of the army. According to a letter written by a monk of Westminster in 1308, Ferrers may have been no friend of Edward II's favourite Piers Gaveston. Nevertheless Edward granted him custody of Gloucester Castle for a term in September 1311, and the following January appointed him seneschal of Gascony. He seems to have become embroiled almost immediately in a conflict with the powerful Gascon noble Amanieu d'Albret, the substance of which is unknown. The king was forced to appoint envoys to settle the dispute, and in August 1312 the protagonists were ordered to come before Edward. Ferrers died that September, however: the <span class="italic">Flores historiarum</span> attributes his death to poison. His eldest surviving son, John, was still under age in 1321, but had died by 23 July 1324 and was succeeded by his brother Robert (1309&#150;1350), still a minor.<br>
