<span class="headword">Gailhard,  Jean</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1659&#150;1708), <span class="occ">writer and religious controversialist</span>, was a protestant Frenchman whose roots are unknown: a tract of his, published at Geneva in 1663, was addressed to &#145;les pasteurs et anciens des eglises Reform&eacute;es en France&#146; (&#145;the ministers and elders of the Reformed church in France&#146;) in vindication of the &#145;Puritains d'Angleterre&#146;. His first known work, in French, dates from 1659. He moved to England probably about 1660, the year when his first English publication appeared, in which he apologizes for &#145;my unskilfulness in the English tongue (for I am a stranger)&#146;. He then plunges into an eloquent defence of presbyterianism against prelacy, on the authority of the &#145;incomparable&#146; Calvin  (<span class="italic">The Controversie between Episcopacy and Presbytery</span>, 1660, 2, 34). In all he published some eighteen tracts, largely in divinity and many of them signed J. G. G. (Jean Gailhard, gentleman). He was a dogmatic predestinarian Calvinist, virulently hostile to Arminianism and Socinianism, and he despised Catholicism&#151;the religion of &#145;wafer-idol-worship&#146; and &#145;brazen-faced whoredom&#146; (<span class="italic">The Blasphemous Socinian Heresy Disproved</span>, 1697, sig. A3<i>r</i>; <span class="italic">God's Truth Vindicated Against Man's Lies</span>, 1703, 13).<br>
<br>In 1668&#150;9 Gailhard fed public interest in travel literature with accounts of Italy and Venice, respectively dedicated to the earl of Sunderland and Sir John Trevor. Writing in the &#145;reason of state&#146; tradition, he provided assessments of the &#145;politic strength&#146; of those states, their armies, manners, and fiscal systems, spiced with tales of Latin lasciviousness. He wrote that he had travelled &#145;into most parts of Europe&#146;; that travel completed a gentleman; and that, when travelling, gentlemen needed &#145;wise counsel, a director&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Present State of the Princes and Republicks of Italy</span>, 1668, p. 8, sig. A7<i>v</i>). This last was a naked job application. He wrote ingratiating letters to Theophilus, earl of Huntingdon, from Angers in 1670&#150;71 on Huguenot affairs, and from Paris in 1673. From about 1671 to 1675 he travelled as tutor to Sir Thomas Grosvenor in France, Italy, Hungary, Bohemia, Germany, and Switzerland.<br>
<br>In 1676 Sir Robert Southwell appointed Gailhard tutor to his nephew Sir Philip Percival (1656&#150;1680). Tutor and pupil embarked on a sightseeing tour to the west of England, then visited the Percival seats in Ireland, and then went to Angers. Here Gailhard tried to induce Percival to study civil law seriously, but found him lazy and spendthrift with a preference for dancing, fencing, the guitar and flute, and carousing instead. Gailhard had no objection to physical prowess, but hated debauchery and inattention to books. Exasperated, he told Southwell that &#145;there is in him things to be rooted out, others levelled, and some others to be polished&#146;; he would try to &#145;bring him to the practice of Christian and moral virtues&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 46953, fols. 112, 207). Gailhard read his pupil Livy and Suetonius in Latin, and made him read the <span class="italic">London Gazette</span> with an atlas alongside.<br>
<br>Gailhard's most sustained work was <span class="italic">The Compleat Gentleman, or, Directions for the Education of Youth</span>, published in two parts in 1678, with two further parts appearing in 1682; the four parts were dedicated to the earl of Huntingdon, Sir Thomas Grosvenor, Dr Thomas Coxe, and Sir Joseph Williamson respectively. The first two had been written at Angers about 1671. Comparisons have been made between this work and John Locke's <span class="italic">Some Thoughts Concerning Education</span> (1693). Gailhard's emphasis is not upon erudition, but upon character, manners, disposition, civility; in a word, virtue. He cites, as Locke did, the Aristotelian maxim that a child is &#145;a smooth table upon which anything can be written&#146;, and he says &#145;let nature be what it will it may be changed by education&#146;  (pp. 4&#150;5). Gailhard warns against undue corporal severity, and against tutors who &#145;would frighten young men into learning, instead of enticing them to it&#146;  (p. 19). He is keen on physical exercise and a capacity for hardship, and deplores the &#145;effeminacy&#146; of the age. He encourages the virtuosity of gentlemen, rather than bookish pedantry and rote learning, and recommends riding, fencing, dancing, drawing, languages, and music. He is concerned for conversation and oratory, and takes care over posture and demeanour. As to reading, what he commends is almost wholly classical. Gailhard's originality is exhausted in his first discourse. The work then turns to the grand tour and becomes an extended travelogue and itinerary, laced with classical tags and tales to illustrate virtues and vices. Supposing a tour of three years, he recommends eighteen months in France (including nine or ten in Angers), six weeks in Geneva, nine months in Italy, and five in Germany and the Low Countries, rounded off with four months more in Paris.<br>
<br>In the 1690s Gailhard wrote prolifically on behalf of theological orthodoxy and moral reformation. His intellectual intolerance shines forth, yet he was politically a firm whig. True to his presbyterian roots, in 1694 he defended the Long Parliament's civil war against the popish and persecuting Charles I, though not the regicide itself, and repudiated as an idolatrous fetish the continuing high-church cult of Charles the Martyr. He roundly condemned Charles II's regime, its pensioner parliament, its ambitious and tyrannizing churchmen who preached <i>jure divino</i> monarchy, its persecution of nonconformity, its tolerance of vice and debauchery. Gailhard was in the forefront of the assault on John Toland's <span class="italic">Christianity not Mysterious</span> and Locke's <span class="italic">Reasonableness of Christianity</span>, publicizing the Middlesex grand jury's presentment against them for blasphemy. He gave a copy of his <span class="italic">Epistle and Preface to the Book Against the &hellip; Socinian Heresie</span> (1698) to his friend the presbyterian judge Sir Thomas Rokeby, who had spurred the grand jury into action. Gailhard and Rokeby shared a passionate providentialist commitment to the campaign for moral reformation. Gailhard was also a whig enemy of the new freedom of the press following the lapse in 1695 of the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span>. What use was it, he asked, if &#145;Popery or Idolatry [be] expell'd, if Socinianism or Blasphemy be let in?&#146; &#145;Extream remedies&#146; were needed against &#145;Atheism, Deism, Prophaneness, Immorality [which] brazen-faced walk in our streets&#146;  (<span class="italic">Blasphemous Socinian Heresy</span>, sigs. A2<i>v</i>, A3<i>r</i>). He demanded the death sentence for heretics, approving of Calvin's burning of Servetus, and commending recent Scottish exertions in hanging Thomas Aikenhead for blasphemy. An attack upon Gailhard, <span class="italic">An apology for the parliament, humbly representing to Mr John Gailhard some reasons why they did not at his request enact sanguinary laws against protestants in their last session</span>, was published in 1697. His last known work is <span class="italic">Discources on Several Useful Subjects</span>, dated 1708.<br>
