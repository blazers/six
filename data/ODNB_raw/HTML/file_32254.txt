<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cam,  Helen Maud</span>  (1885&#150;1968), <span class="occ">historian</span>, the fourth of the nine children of the Revd William Herbert Cam and his wife, Katherine, daughter of George Erving Scott, was born at Abingdon, Berkshire, on 22 August 1885. Her early life was spent there and at Birchanger, Essex, where her father became rector when he retired from the headmastership of Roysse's Grammar School in Abingdon. She and three sisters were educated at home by their parents, an education which she delightfully described in a broadcast talk, &#145;Eating and drinking Greek&#146;, in 1964. With this grounding she won a scholarship in 1904 to Royal Holloway College, London, and gained a first in history (1907). In 1908 a fellowship in history took her for a year to Bryn Mawr College in the United States, where she worked on Anglo-Saxon and Frankish studies; the results were presented as a thesis for the MA degree at London University in 1909, and published in 1912 as <span class="italic">Local Government in Francia and England, 768&#150;1034</span>.<br>
<br>For three years Helen Cam taught with great success at Cheltenham Ladies' College and in 1912 returned to Royal Holloway, first as assistant lecturer until 1919, then as staff lecturer. In 1921 she went to Girton College, Cambridge, where she became successively Pfeiffer research fellow (until 1926), fellow, and lecturer in history for the college, and for the university from 1929; she was also director of studies in history and law, and vice-mistress from 1944. In 1948 she left one Cambridge for the other on appointment as the first Zemurray Radcliffe professor at Harvard. This chair she held for six years with much enjoyment, greatly appreciated by the academic world of Harvard and other centres of medieval study in the United States. Retirement in 1954 brought increased opportunity to research, write, and lecture, as well as to contribute to historical studies as a member of councils of learned societies, especially as president of the International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions from 1949 to 1960&#151;in which capacity she was described as &#145;a great abbess&#146;. She was editing the records of the eyre of London of 1321 for the Selden Society up to the time of her death, and a memoir by Professor S. F. C. Milsom, who completed the edition and saw the volumes through the press, gives a vivid picture of her at eighty-two, as enthralled by her subject as if she had been fifty years younger.<br>
<br>When Helen Cam began historical research the principal interests of the great teachers of the day and of the immediate past were constitutional, legal, and administrative. To Stubbs, Maitland, and Vinogradoff she gave a lifetime's allegiance. With the exception of the paper &#145;Suitors and <i>scabini</i>&#146; read at Warsaw in 1933, her published work after 1912 was confined to English history, but was enriched by her continual contact with continental scholars and their work.<br>
<br>After the publication in the <span class="italic">English Historical Review</span> of a surprising short article, &#145;The legend of the incendiary birds&#146; (1916), she produced an impressive series of articles and books on counties and boroughs based on the hundred rolls, with which her name will always be especially connected, on the <i>quo warranto</i> rolls, and on the records of the general eyres. Her appreciation of the importance of topography as a key to some local problems was illustrated by the subtitle of the first group of her collected papers, <span class="italic">Liberties and Communities in Medieval England: collected studies in administration and topography</span> (1944). Her feeling for the continuity of English institutions was brilliantly expounded in the John Coffin lecture of 1960, &#145;What of the middle ages is alive in England to-day?&#146; Her second collection, <span class="italic">Law Finders and Law Makers in Medieval England</span> (1962), included her inaugural lecture at Harvard in 1948, in which she reviewed the study of medieval history at the time, surveying also the contribution of Harvard's first professor of medieval history, Henry Adams, and the graduate school he founded, with tributes to and reminiscences of the historians who had been her teachers, guides, and colleagues.<br>
<br>As a teacher Helen Cam herself gave her pupils contact with a great range of learning and an interest in them as marked as in the subjects of her own studies. As one said, &#145;Judgement might be severe but it was impersonal: no-one was more ready to respect the personalities of students.&#146; To those past their undergraduate days and to those who consulted her she gave unstinted help in their fields of research.<br>
<br>Nor were her interests and sympathies solely academic. A lecture to which she went as a student, impelled thereto by a tutor rather than of her own volition, converted her to the cause of women's suffrage though not to its militancy. She was also much concerned with the YWCA, and the provision of education for women who had to start earning their living after very limited schooling, and she gave every possible help to the residential centre which later became Hillcroft College, in conjunction with her contemporary at Royal Holloway, Miss Fanny Street. For some years she contributed a monthly page on novels, plays, and questions of the day to <span class="italic">The Torch</span>, a paper for those beginning to make increasing use of the free libraries. She was also an active member of the Cambridge Labour Party and Trades Council.<br>
<br>Helen Cam had always greatly enjoyed historical novels, considering them a &#145;standing reminder that history is about human beings&#146;, and lectures on them resulted in the pamphlet <span class="italic">Historical Novels</span> (1961). Nothing roused her wrath more than the attempted whitewashing of certain historical characters, especially Richard III. Among her other recreations was watercolour sketching, in which she had considerable talent. She is described in her thirties, as &#145;of serious and matronly mien&#146;, and during vacations spent at Oxford (whither, to Keble Road, her parents retired in 1926) she was to be seen in the Bodleian, &#145;sitting squarely by a window&#146; in one of the carrels in Duke Humfrey's Library:<blockquote>sharp eyes, sharp nose, heavy eyebrows&#151;intent on her books, looking like a broody hen in a nesting box, placid and comfortable, but ready to peck if the occasion demanded. Some of her best articles must have been hatched there.</blockquote>Helen Cam was a woman who by her learning, integrity, and warmth of personality contributed much to any group of which she was a member. Her importance as a historian was recognized by election to the British Academy in 1945, in which year she was the first woman to deliver the Raleigh lecture of the academy. She also received honorary doctorates at Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, the University of North Carolina, and, in 1962, Oxford; she became an honorary fellow of Somerville College in 1964. She was one of the first women to join the council of the Selden Society, of which she was vice-president in 1962&#150;5. In 1958 she became a vice-president of the Royal Historical Society, and in 1963 honorary vice-president; she was also a corresponding fellow of the Medieval Academy of Arts and Sciences. Her work for the International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions was commemorated by the <span class="italic">Album Helen Maud Cam</span> (1960), two volumes presented to her for her seventy-fifth birthday, containing essays by scholars of many nations, a bibliography of her works to 1957, and an appreciation by an American colleague, Professor Caroline Robbins. Her public as well as her historical services were recognized by her appointment as CBE in 1957. She died in hospital at Orpington, Kent, on 9 February 1968.<br>
