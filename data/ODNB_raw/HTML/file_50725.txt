<span class="headword">Jackson, Sir  Robert Gillman Allen</span>  (1911&#150;1991), <span class="occ">international administrator</span>, was born on 8 November 1911 in Hawksburn, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia, the second son of Archibald Jackson (1858&#150;1928), Scottish engineer and businessman, and his second wife, Kathleen Crooke (1872&#150;1943), a nurse, daughter of Peter Williams, an Anglo-Irish farmer and vet, and his wife, Minnie Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Allen. He was given the names Wilbur Kenneth (after the doctor who delivered him) but changed them by deed poll in 1937 before he married. After attending Cheltenham state school from 1918 he went in 1922 to Mentone grammar school, which his father had helped to found. He excelled at work and games and became school captain. His father's death in 1928 deprived him of a university education, so he entered the Royal Australian Navy in 1929 as a paymaster-cadet, having won a cadetship, beating 180 candidates. Admiral Sir Wilbraham Ford, British commander of the Australian naval squadron, recognized his ability and in 1938 took him to Malta. British policy at that time was that Malta could not be defended. Paymaster-Lieutenant Jackson wrote a paper showing that it could, provided that the civilian population was protected and supplied with essentials, since its co-operation would be vital, particularly in maintaining the naval dockyard. Existing tunnels should be extended, and shelters, stores, and vital services put underground. Ford submitted Jackson's paper to the Admiralty; the arrival of their signal &#145;all proposals approved, proceed with all despatch&#146; was one of the greatest moments of his life. But the RAF was not persuaded, and it was not until July 1939 that the British government accepted the navy's view and reversed its policy. Jackson spent the next two years organizing supplies and supervising the loading of convoys in England and Alexandria. Malta narrowly avoided starvation; its survival as an operational base played a crucial part in the allies' victory in north Africa. For his part, Jackson was appointed OBE in 1941.<br>
<br>In November 1941 the government posted Paymaster-Commander Jackson to Cairo&#151;but as a civil servant. The Middle East Supply Centre (MESC) had been set up to develop local production of food and materials, so as to leave shipping space available for military supplies. MESC's operations extended over the Middle East and much of Africa. Jackson was appointed director in January 1942. He worked closely with the military authorities, introduced import licensing, and won the confidence of governments; given the variety of problems in the different territories this called for diplomacy and expertise. He inaugurated a long-term anti-locust campaign (for which he was appointed CMG in 1944). When the USA entered the war, he invited Americans to join the MESC team; this partnership flourished for two years. Jackson saw MESC as a model for future international co-operation, but as wartime pressures abated nations wanted independence. MESC was nevertheless the precursor of the regional economic commissions later set up by the United Nations.<br>
<br>In 1943 the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was created to bring relief and supplies to the peoples of nations devastated by war and to assist the millions of displaced persons. By the end of 1944 it was in difficulties, and in February 1945 the British government appointed Jackson senior deputy director-general&#151;effectively chief executive (the director-general being the American Herbert Lehman). Jackson fired and hired on a large scale, recruiting generals as they were demobilized. After reorganizing the London office he was based in Washington, where he kept pressure on political leaders to provide financial support. UNRRA eventually sent relief to much of Europe and part of China. Some of these areas were under communist control and in 1946 the USA refused to provide further funds. Altogether UNRRA supplied $3 billion worth of food and equipment and dealt with 8.5 million displaced persons. It was the biggest UN relief operation ever mounted. When Jackson left UNRRA in August 1947 he had three major achievements to his credit. He was still only thirty-six, but after working non-stop for ten years was exhausted. His marriage to Una Margaret Dick (<i>b</i>. 1911), only daughter of Ronald Dick of Hobart, Australia, in 1937 had failed. He had fallen for <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31801/', "Barbara Mary Ward (1914&#150;1981)")</script>, the economist and leading Catholic, and had joined the Roman church.<br>
<br>In November 1947 Trygve Lie, secretary-general of the United Nations, offered Jackson a post as an additional assistant secretary-general for co-ordination. The British government agreed that he should go there provided the conditions were satisfactory. In the event they were not, but he took the job, maintaining that he was acting under orders. By mid-April 1948 he was in post; in mid-August he was fired. Lie had found him &#145;too strong&#146;; some of the assistant secretaries-general also felt threatened. The post had, in Lie's view, proved unsatisfactory and was abolished. Jackson was shattered. He later claimed that the main reason for his dismissal was a disagreement with Lie concerning Israel. The British government then kept him occupied for two years; he spent the next two in Australia setting up a new ministry of national development, returning to England to marry Barbara Ward on 16 November 1950, having been granted a papal dispensation. During 1952 he advised the governments of India and Pakistan on their development plans.<br>
<br>In 1953 the British government appointed Jackson special commissioner in charge of the preparatory commission for the Volta River aluminium scheme in the Gold Coast. He reported in 1956 that the project&#151;to build a dam, power station, aluminium smelter, and bauxite mine&#151;was sound, provided that the aluminium companies could operate their smelter profitably; that would depend on the government's price for electricity. Nothing came of the project at that stage, partly because the Gold Coast was about to be granted independence as Ghana. Once again uncertain of his future, Jackson agreed to stay on as chairman of the Development Commission and adviser to President Nkrumah. In 1958 the American government became interested; the firm of Henry J. Kaiser then recommended major changes to the scheme (relocating the dam and using imported bauxite); in January 1962 the two governments and the World Bank agreed to provide the loans. The dam was inaugurated in 1966. Jackson was made KB in 1956 and KCVO in 1961 after organizing arrangements for the queen's visit to Ghana.<br>
<br>In 1962 Jackson returned to the UN as consultant to Paul Hoffman, then managing director of the special fund and later administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). He advised on technical assistance and pre-investment aid to developing countries, inspecting projects in many parts of the world. Multi-purpose river projects (including the Mekong) were his particular interest. In 1968 Hoffman asked him to undertake a study of the capacity of the UN development system (then rapidly expanding), on the assumption that its funding would double in five years. He asked Margaret Joan Anstee (<i>b</i>. 1926), an experienced resident representative of UNDP, to be his chief assistant. This marked the start of a close and enduring personal and professional partnership. His marriage to Barbara Ward had failed; their son, aged twelve, was at school in England, under his father's caring eye. The &#145;Capacity Study&#146; was published in November 1969. One of its main conclusions was that many of UNDP's projects were not in the best interests of the nations they were intended to assist, being the result of selling pressure by the specialized agencies. It recommended that projects should be related to a country's own development plan. &#145;Country programming&#146; required a new administrative structure: maximum devolution of responsibility to country level, where governments and &#145;resreps&#146; could decide what should be provided by UNDP, combined with maximum central control of the agencies through UNDP's power of the purse as sole funding organization for technical assistance. The concept was simple but the study was exhaustive, covering all aspects of the system. Though welcomed by many, it was strongly opposed by the senior officials of UNDP and the agencies; its likening of the system to a dinosaur caused offence, particularly to Hoffman. Its recommendations were broadly accepted by the governing council, but somewhat watered down; the resulting &#145;consensus&#146; was formally adopted in December 1970. In the event, over the next few years donor governments' support for UNDP declined sharply. Subsequent attempts to improve the system recognized that Jackson's analysis was right and was still relevant.<br>
<br>Hoffman dispensed with Jackson's services at the end of 1971; in March 1972 the new secretary-general, Kurt Waldheim, asked him to take charge of the UN relief operation in Bangladesh, then suffering from the aftermath of devastating floods and civil war. Millions of refugees were returning from India and there was a danger of widespread starvation. The main ports were blocked by sunken ships, the monsoon was approaching, and the UN relief operation had not been going well.<blockquote>At long last in Bangladesh we switched from quixotic amateurism to large-scale professionalism. Jackson's enormous experience was coupled with imagination, drive, a world view, and a comprehensive approach which covered politics, finance, availability of supplies, shipping, transport and communications, the weather, crop prospects, grain futures, and the morale of all the people he was dealing with. (Urquhart, 231)</blockquote>Not in good health, Jackson gave his all, saw what had to be done and what could wait, insisted that the UN system spoke with one voice, and briefed donor governments in his hard-hitting yet breezy style. He had a tiny office in New York and travelled frequently to Dacca. This was the most successful UN operation since UNRRA, handling $5 billion of aid, and a model of how these things could be done. Other appointments followed as co-ordinator of UN assistance, including that to Zambia, suffering as a result of UN sanctions against Rhodesia (1973&#150;7), to Indo-China in the aftermath of the Vietnam War (1975&#150;7), and finally to Kampuchea (1979&#150;84). When Pol Pot was driven out by Vietnamese forces many thousands of Khmers (including Khmers Rouges) fled to the border with Thailand. Humanitarian aid was urgently needed within Kampuchea and on the border. The UN general assembly voted to give Kampuchea's seat to the Khmer Rouge, not to the new regime in Phnom Penh. In 1981 Western governments confined their support to the border relief operation, leaving Kampuchea dependent on the USSR and its allies. In this frustrating political minefield Jackson never put a foot wrong, with the result that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved within Kampuchea and on the border. In 1986 Jackson was made a companion of the Order of Australia. After suffering a severe stroke in New York in December 1987 he returned to England, where he died at his home, at Fairacres, Roehampton, Surrey, on 12 January 1991. He was cremated at Putney Vale on 21 January, and his ashes were taken to Australia for burial at Cheltenham, Victoria. He was survived by Dame Margaret Anstee and by the son of his second marriage.<br>
<br>Jacko (as he was nicknamed) was a world citizen, yet remained resolutely Australian with a sense of humour to match; he spoke no foreign languages, yet could communicate with ease. An imposing figure, with an air of authority, he was a natural leader who inspired the loyalty of his staff, of whom he expected much and to whom he was considerate and generous when they had personal problems. He did not suffer fools gladly, nor did he court popularity. He was held in great affection by many, yet remained a very private person. The &#145;Capacity Study&#146; was a landmark; nevertheless Jackson's greatest achievements were in actions not words, in Malta, UNRRA, and Bangladesh. As a relief operator and master of logistics he was unsurpassed.<br>
