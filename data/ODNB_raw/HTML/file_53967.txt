<span class="headword">Higdon <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Schollick]</span>,  Annie Catharine <span class="st"> [Kitty]</span></span>  (1864&#150;1946), <span class="occ">schoolmistress</span>, was born on 30 December 1864 at Poolton cum Seacombe, Cheshire, the daughter of Samuel Schollick, a foreman shipwright, and his wife, Jane. She became a certificated elementary teacher, and when she married on 11 July 1896 was residing at Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Her husband, <a href="#cosubject_53967">Thomas George Higdon [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was a fellow teacher. Early in married life the couple moved to London, and on 14 April 1902 took up joint posts at Wood Dalling council school in Norfolk. Annie Higdon, known as Kitty, was the head teacher and her husband an uncertificated assistant. As Christian socialists with strong egalitarian views they were dedicated to improving the lot of their pupils, many of whom came from poor labouring families. Kitty was deeply critical of the widespread illegal employment of children on the land. A confirmed pacifist, she taught her pupils to abhor cruelty to animals. She did much to promote the children's welfare by purchasing food, clothing, and footwear for them out of her own pocket. She also provided equipment for the school and conducted cookery classes in her own kitchen.<br>
<br>In 1907 Thomas Higdon, with his wife's backing, became actively involved in promoting agricultural trade unionism. In what was regarded as almost a rural revolution, Thomas Higdon's efforts led to the election of labourers to the parish council in 1910, to which the Higdons were also elected, though Kitty retired without taking office. These developments, and Kitty Higdon's continuing demands for improvements to the fabric of the school, led to friction with the managers, many of whom were farmers. In December 1908 and July 1910 official inquiries into the couple's conduct were instituted under the aegis of Norfolk education committee. Although a threat of dismissal was withdrawn, they were transferred to Burston and Shimpling council school, where they took up duty on 1 February 1911. Their political activities and social concerns again led to clashes with their managers. After Thomas Higdon helped local labourers to oust sitting members at the parish council elections, himself heading the poll, the managers requested in November 1913 Norfolk education committee to remove Kitty Higdon from her post on disciplinary grounds. After an inquiry, the committee asked her to seek alternative employment; when she took no action she and her husband were dismissed as from 31 March 1914.<br>
<br>Kitty Higdon was an excellent teacher, as reports by the school inspectors make clear. On 1 April 1914, as a protest against her dismissal, sixty-six of the seventy-two children on the register, with the support of their parents, came out on strike. As the dispute went on, it drew support from trade unions and other national labour organizations. Public meetings were held on Burston Green, addressed by leading political figures. The Higdons, meanwhile, began to teach the striking children, at first in the open air and then in a temporary &#145;strike school&#146; held in a former carpenter's shop. A national campaign was launched to raise funds for a purpose-built property, and between April 1916 and December 1917 &pound;1662 was raised, with the miners' union alone subscribing &pound;401. The new building was opened on 13 May 1917 amid great celebrations.<br>
<br>By 1919 the strike school still had forty pupils and throughout the 1920s and much of the 1930s it continued to prosper, drawing children not only from the immediate vicinity but from the wider community. Among them were two Russian boys, the sons of members of the Russian trade delegation in London. Kitty Higdon laid great emphasis on the inculcation of civic values, and older pupils were taken to trade union and political rallies. In a grudging tribute to the couple's sincerity, the Board of Education described them as &#145;persons who conceive themselves to have a &#147;mission&#148;&#146;. The school building, described by the Higdons as the &#145;centre of a new living movement of educational and social activity&#146;, was used for meetings in support of various educational and socialist causes.<br>
<br>The school remained open until shortly after Thomas Higdon's death in August 1939. Its eleven pupils were then transferred to Burston council school and Kitty Higdon entered a retirement home at Swainsthorpe, near Norwich, where she died on 24 April 1946. She was buried in Burston churchyard.<br>

<a name="cosubject_53967"></a><span class="headword">Thomas George Higdon</span>  (1869&#150;1939), <span class="occ">schoolmaster</span>, was born on 21 August 1869 at East Pennard, Somerset, a younger son of Dennis Higdon, a farm labourer, and his wife, Ann. He became a teacher on the basis of an Oxford local senior certificate and, after his marriage in 1896, taught at St James's and St Peter's School, Piccadilly, London, where he remained from 1899 until he and his wife moved to Wood Dalling. An outspoken critic of child employment on the land, his firm political beliefs and farm labouring background led to a close involvement in the agricultural trade union movement in Norfolk. He joined the union's executive committee in 1914 and, except for the period 1924&#150;7, continued to serve until 1938. He acted as union treasurer from 1916 to 1920, and in 1917 was appointed a member of the agricultural industry's first central wages board. He was the author of at least two pamphlets. The first, <span class="italic">Bodies without Abodes</span> (n.d., <i>c</i>.1912), was a fictional account of labouring life and the tied cottage system; the second, <span class="italic">The Burston Rebellion</span> (n.d., <i>c</i>.1916), examined events surrounding the school strike of 1 April 1914.<br>
<br>Thomas Higdon died at Mill Green, Burston, on 17 August 1939, after a long illness. Appropriately the simple funeral service five days later was conducted in the strike school, before his burial in the village churchyard. The school building, under the care of trustees, was still in existence in the 1990s.<br>
