<span class="headword">Pike <span class="st"> [Peeke]</span>,  Richard</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1620&#150;1658), <span class="occ">soldier and adventurer</span>, was probably the son of Richard Pike, an attorney practising in Tavistock, Devon, in 1597; unfortunately the Tavistock parish registers do not begin until 1620. In that year Pike served as a common soldier in the attack on the Barbary pirates in Algiers commanded by Sir Robert Mansell. Having returned in 1621, &#145;my purse, never the fuller, nor my pockets thicker lined&#146;  (Arber, 279), he took part in the expedition to Cadiz led by Viscount Wimbledon in October 1625. According to his own account he sailed on the <i>Convertine</i>, under Captain Thomas Portar, and witnessed the capture of the fort of Puntal, 3 miles from Cadiz, on 22&#150;3 October; but on going ashore to seek fruit he received severe back and facial wounds and was captured by fourteen Spanish musketeers. An attempt to ransom him by the vice-admiral, the earl of Essex, was spurned by the Spaniards, and the English fleet sailed away without him on 27 October.<br>
<br>After eighteen days' imprisonment in Cadiz, his account continued, Pike was taken to Jerez and on 15 November brought before the duke of Medina Sidonia and other Spanish grandees, who examined him closely, through two Irish friars, about the ordnance on his ship and the defences of Plymouth. Angered by their likening Englishmen to hens, Pike made a counter-taunt that Spaniards fought like pullets, which led him to accept a hand-to-hand contest with a Spanish champion, using rapiers and daggers. Having easily disarmed his opponent, Pike then offered to fight, using a quarter-staff with a short iron pike at one end, any number of Spaniards up to six. Three presented themselves; he killed one and disarmed the others. The Spanish dignitaries were so impressed that he was given gold worth &pound;9, entertained at home by the marqu&eacute;s de Alquenezes and his wife, and pardoned. On Christmas day 1625 Pike appeared before Philip IV, his queen, and the infante Don Carlos; he declined an annual pension to serve the Spanish crown, but gratefully accepted 100 pistolets for his journey home. After passing through France he arrived at Fowey, Cornwall, on 23 April 1626. On 18 May he delivered in London a challenge to the duke of Buckingham from the brother-in-law of the conde d'Olivares, the Spanish chief minister.<br>
<br>Pike appears to have spent the remainder of his days in Tavistock: he was churchwarden in 1638; his wife, Abigail, died in 1643, and a son, Richard, in 1655; by 24 August 1658 he had remarried. He may have been the Richard Peeke who died or was buried there on 13 June 1690&#151;the only instance of the name in the register since 1655. In July 1626 Pike published a vigorous narrative of his Spanish experiences in a tract entitled <span class="italic">Three to one</span>, which he dedicated to Charles I. His adventures were also dramatized in <span class="italic">Dicke of Devonshire, a Tragi-Comedy</span>  (BL, Egerton MS 1994), probably written not long after 1626 (but not published until 1883) and usually assigned to Thomas Heywood. One modern authority suggests that it may be attributable to John Ford, since the main plot, a story of rape and its aftermath set in Spain, was Ford's sort of subject-matter, and that the rather unrelated Pike episodes may have been inserted prior to a Devon tour, Ford being a Dartmoor man. Later in the seventeenth century, Pike's exploits were commemorated in a broadside ballad, <span class="italic">A Panegyric Poem, or, Tavestock's Encomium</span>, which contains the lines:<blockquote>
<div>Search whether can be found again the like<br>
</div>
<div>For noble prowess to our Tav'stock Pike,<br>
</div>
<div>In whose renown'd never-dying name<br>
</div>
<div>Live England's honour and the Spaniard's shame.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">DNB</span>)</blockquote>
