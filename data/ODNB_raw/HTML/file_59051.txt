<span class="headword">Bois,  du, family</span>  (<em>per. </em><em>c.</em>1071&#150;1313), <span class="occ">barons</span>, were important tenants and retainers of the earls of Leicester. For seven generations each head of the family bore the name Arnold, which became a component of the place names of their principal residences. Substantial earthworks next to the church at Thorpe Arnold are all that remains of the du Bois manor house there. There is also mention of a residence at Bois-Ernault in Normandy.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59045"></a><span class="headword">Arnold (I)  du Bois</span> <span class="st"> [Arnold fitz Popelina]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1071&#150;1094)<span class="occ"></span> was a leading tenant of the honour of Breteuil in Normandy, with lands in ten surrounding settlements. He also held Pullay of the duke of Normandy. He was one of ten knights taken prisoner during a baronial conflict at Ivry in Normandy in 1094 and subsequently gaoled. <a name="cosubject_59046"></a><span class="headword">Arnold (II)  du Bois</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1100&#150;1125)<span class="occ"></span> was the castellan of Lyre in Normandy when it was attacked by Henry I in 1119. Arnold, like the majority of the tenants of Breteuil, had revolted after the imposition upon the honour of a royal nominee, the Breton baron Ralph de Gael. In 1121 the honour passed by marriage to Robert (II), earl of Leicester (<i>d</i>. 1168), whose lordship Arnold accepted and in return received a substantial grant of lands in Leicestershire.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59047"></a><span class="headword">Arnold (III)  du Bois</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1130&#150;1160)<span class="occ"></span> acquired further estates in Gloucestershire and Warwickshire through marriage to Isabel de Waterville, heir of another Leicester tenant. He served the earl throughout the troubled reign of Stephen, as constable and <i>de facto</i> deputy in Normandy in 1138&#150;9 and as steward and constant attendant in England from 1140 onwards. He appears as a witness to charters of Stephen and of Henry Plantagenet, as duke of Normandy and subsequently as king of England, on most occasions in the company of his lord the earl, who supported Stephen and Henry in turn. In 1147 Arnold founded the Cistercian monastery at Biddlesden in Buckinghamshire, a daughter house of Garendon, Leicestershire, on land to which he had dubious title. He also made substantial grants to Leicester Abbey; and like his father and grandfather he was a patron of Lyre Abbey in Normandy.<br>
<br>The relationship between <a name="cosubject_59048"></a><span class="headword">Arnold (IV)  du Bois</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1205)<span class="occ"></span> and Robert (III) de Breteuil, earl of Leicester (<i>d</i>. 1190), was perhaps not as close as that which had existed between their respective fathers, although Arnold appears to have supported the earl in his revolt against Henry II in 1173 and afterwards served as his steward. Arnold accompanied Robert (IV) de Breteuil, earl of Leicester (<i>d</i>. 1204), on the third crusade, and was one of the party led by the earl that successfully routed a band of Turks outside Ramlah in late 1191. On his return from the Holy Land he was impleaded for debt by the moneylender Elias fitz Aaron of Lincoln. He married Emma, daughter and coheir of Payn of Houghton, Northamptonshire, acquiring through her lands in Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire. His brother Robert du Bois (<i>fl</i>. 1154&#150;1190) was rector of Claybrooke, Leicestershire, and a household clerk of the earls of Leicester. <a name="cosubject_59049"></a><span class="headword">Arnold (V)  du Bois</span>  (1186?&#150;1222)<span class="occ"></span> was a minor at his father's death in 1205, and was placed in the wardship of Roger of Basingham. He reached his majority in 1207 but his inheritance was much reduced, both in extent and prestige. The loss of Normandy to the Capetians in 1204 had irrevocably deprived the family of its ancestral lands, and the division of the earldom of Leicester after 1204 extinguished the du Bois stewardship. The division also left Arnold with two overlords for the lands formerly held of the earldom, Saer (IV) de Quincy (<i>d</i>. 1219) and Simon de Montfort (<i>d</i>. 1218). In the civil war of 1216 Arnold fought against the king, and he was briefly deprived of his lands as a result. He married Alice, heir of Henry of Tubney, steward of the earl of Warwick and lord of Tubney, Berkshire.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_59050"></a><span class="headword">Arnold (VI)  du Bois</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1255)<span class="occ"></span> was one of the knights who mustered at Portsmouth in late 1229 for an abortive royal expedition to Brittany. He was custodian of Nottingham Castle and acting sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire for part of 1239, and in 1253 he was appointed justice of the forests south of the Trent. He was an adherent of Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester (<i>d</i>. 1265), and his sister Joan du Bois married Montfort's steward Thomas Astley. His brother William du Bois (<i>fl</i>. 1235&#150;1260) was a household knight of Roger de Quincy, constable of Scotland. Arnold married Joan Beauchamp, coheir of John Beauchamp of Ashington, Suffolk. Matthew Paris gave his arms as argent, two bars and a canton gules. The heraldic seal of one of Arnold's charters shows two bars, on a canton or quarter a lion passant. He died on 6 February 1255 and was buried in Biddlesden Abbey. <a name="cosubject_59051"></a><span class="headword">Arnold (VII)  du Bois</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1277)<span class="occ"></span> was obliged to mortgage his manor of Ashington to the bishop of Norwich in order to raise money in 1259. He also supported Montfort, but a fortuitous illness precluded his participation in the baronial wars of 1264&#150;5, and he did not suffer for his earlier allegiance. His eldest son, Arnold, died in his lifetime and, on his death on 1 April 1277, he was succeeded by his second son, <a name="cosubject_59052"></a><span class="headword">John  du Bois</span>, Lord du Bois  (1253&#150;1290)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 29 June 1253. John had a summons to the Shrewsbury parliament of 1283. He married, but there were no children of the union, and on his death before 6 February 1290 his heir was his younger brother Master William du Bois, a cleric. After William's death, before 6 March 1313, the bulk of the du Bois lands passed to his niece Maud Lovell and her husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61243/', "William de la Zouche, first Lord Zouche")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54535/', "Zouche family")</script>].<br>
