<span class="headword">Astbury,  William Thomas</span>  (1898&#150;1961), <span class="occ">physicist and molecular biologist</span>, was born on 25 February 1898 at Longton, Staffordshire, the fourth of seven children and the eldest son of William Edwin Astbury, potter's turner, of Longton, and his wife, Clara Dean. Astbury was educated at Longton high school and at Jesus College, Cambridge. He went up in 1917 but his education was interrupted for two years by war service in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) in Cork, Ireland, where he met his future wife. After graduation with first classes in both part one (physics, chemistry, mineralogy, 1920) and part two (physics, 1921) of the natural sciences tripos, he joined Professor Sir William H. Bragg first at University College, London (1921), and then at the Royal Institution (1923). In 1922 he married, in London, Frances Hannah Mary, daughter of Daniel Gould, horticulturalist, of Cork. They had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Astbury first signalled his life's work by accepting an invitation as lecturer at the University of Leeds (1928), where he set up the textile physics laboratory in the department of textile industries, based in the first instance on X-ray diffraction studies of keratin, the wool protein. Subsequently, in 1937, Astbury was appointed reader in textile physics and, in 1945, professor and head of a new department, the department of biomolecular structure. After Astbury's death the university replaced this department by a new one (1962), entitled in his honour the Astbury department of biophysics.<br>
<br>Throughout his career Astbury was a pioneer, attempting the solution of structural problems, with brilliant intuition, long before the appropriate techniques had been developed. His first papers dealt with small molecules that were, nevertheless, more complicated than any other crystal structures solved at the time. His greatest contribution came, however, after his transfer to Leeds. In three key papers, published between 1931 and 1935, with improved diagrams obtained by X-ray cameras of his own careful design, he showed that the diagram of unstretched wool fibres was interpretable in terms of a folded molecular chain, which by stretching could be converted reversibly into another form with straight chains, substantially as in silk. These structures he named respectively the &#945;-form and the &#946;-form. This was the first example of a mechanical polymorph. Astbury favoured an &#945;-structure in which the long chain of the protein was folded in a sequence of flat hexagons. When, later, accurate atomic models proved that such a fold could not accommodate the bulky side chains of the protein, he developed another, orthogonal fold, consonant with all the properties of the protein known at that time. This folding and unfolding of protein chains, and Astbury's observation that single crystals of globular proteins such as edestin could be turned by denaturation into a set of parallel fibres, led him directly to the profound conclusion that a protein could exhibit different properties and activities simply through differences in the folding pattern.<br>
<br>In the meantime, Astbury had extended his interests to other proteins: the myosin of muscle which he studied extensively, the epidermin of skin, and the fibrinogen and fibrin of blood. These formed a coherent group, the k-m-e-f group, all of which showed a keratin-like structure. The keratin of bird feathers and reptile scales he found to be slightly different, and so he was able to separate these from mammals on a molecular basis. All these proteins differed sharply from collagen, the inextensible protein of connective tissue, which he regarded as an entirely different protein. In the first Procter memorial lecture (1939), based on a wide selection of collagens, he deduced that the molecular chain of collagen was not quite fully extended; in the ninth (1960) he gave the correct, Ramachandran, structure. Astbury was a man who delighted in the success of others as much as he did in his own and, when Linus Pauling announced the &#945;-helical structure of proteins, he fully accepted it.<br>
<br>Perhaps Astbury's greatest contribution to molecular biology was with nucleic acids. He was early convinced of the importance of these acids. Again he reached a structure long before anyone else had done so, but again he missed the real structure of a double helix because the necessary techniques and information were not yet available.<br>
<br>Astbury's work had a profound effect on the textile industry, on the development of molecular biology, and in the medical field. He received many honours. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society (1940), gave the Croonian lecture (1945), and was a member of the council (1946&#150;7). He was elected honorary life member of the New York Academy of Sciences (1950), corresponding member of the Istituto Lombardo de Scienze (1951), foreign member of the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences (1956), and honorary founder member of the British Biophysical Society (1961). He was ScD (Cambridge) and doctor <i>honoris causa</i> of the University of Strasbourg (1946). He also achieved many other distinctions.<br>
<br>Astbury was a man of the Potteries, who retained a bluff, hearty, simple style and a traditional extreme independence. A sturdy figure with a somewhat rolling gait, he was always popular. He was an accomplished pianist and learned to play the violin late in life. Astbury died at the Leeds General Infirmary on 4 June 1961.<br>
