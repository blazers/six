<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Armstrong, Sir  George Carlyon Hughes</span>, first baronet  (1836&#150;1907), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor</span>, younger son of Colonel George Craven Armstrong, of the East India Company's army, and of Georgianna, daughter of Captain Philip Hughes, was born at Lucknow, India, on 20 July 1836. He was privately educated and was nominated to a military cadetship in the company's service in 1855. During the Indian mutiny he was attached to the 59th Bengal native infantry, and afterwards to Stokes's Pathan horse, a newly raised regiment of Indian irregulars. As second in command of the latter he was seriously wounded in the course of operations around Delhi. On the suppression of the mutiny he was appointed orderly officer at Addiscombe Military College, a post he occupied until the college closed in 1861, when he retired from the army with the rank of captain. On 2 February 1865 he married Alice Fitzroy, daughter of the Revd Charles Joseph Furlong; they had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>In 1866 Armstrong took on the duties of secretary and registration agent to the Westminster Conservative Association, and his powers of work and organization were largely responsible for the defeat of J. S. Mill by W. H. Smith in November 1868. After acting for a short time as financial manager of Watney's brewery, he was offered, in 1871, the editorship and management of <span class="italic">The Globe</span> newspaper, then in the hands of a small Conservative syndicate, of which George Cubitt (afterwards Lord Ashcombe) was the leading member. The paper had been run for some years at a heavy financial loss, but Captain Armstrong, though without any previous experience of journalism, was an excellent man of business with a keen political instinct. He rapidly raised the paper from the position of a mere derelict to that of a valuable property, and he made it one of the most thoroughgoing and influential supporters of Disraeli in the metropolitan press; down to his death it remained the typical organ of the militant Conservative school. As an acknowledgement of his labours and success the sole property of <span class="italic">The Globe</span> was made over to him by the owners in 1875, and in 1882 he acquired a large interest in <span class="italic">The People</span>, a Sunday Conservative paper with a large circulation among the working classes, and obtained by Armstrong as an antidote to the radical <span class="italic">Lloyd's Weekly News</span>. Thanks to these joint ventures, Armstrong made and (unlike many of his contemporary proprietors) retained a large fortune; but he took no part in public or political affairs outside the columns of his papers. Perhaps the best-remembered incident in connection with his editorship of <span class="italic">The Globe</span> was the leaked disclosure in its pages, on 30 May 1878, of the terms of the Salisbury&#150;Shuvalov treaty, made available to the paper by Charles Marvin, an occasional contributor temporarily working in the Foreign Office. In 1892 Armstrong was rewarded with a baronetcy for his services to the Unionist Party; he had relinquished the editorship of <span class="italic">The Globe</span> in 1889, and in 1899 the control of the paper passed to George Elliot, his second surviving son, who succeeded to the baronetcy. His eldest son, Arthur Reginald, lieutenant 19th hussars, died at Secunderabad on 1 November 1898. Armstrong died of heart disease at his home, 39 Cadogan Square, London, on 20 April 1907. He was buried at Woking.<br>
