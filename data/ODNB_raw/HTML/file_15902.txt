<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lake,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1624, <em>d.</em> 1689), <span class="occ">bishop of Chichester</span>, was born in Petticoat Lane, Halifax, Yorkshire, and was baptized on 5 December 1624, the first of the three children of Thomas Lake (<i>d</i>. 1649), yeoman, &#145;grocer&#146; to the local woollen trade, and Mary Moakson. He was educated in the Halifax grammar school and on 4 December 1637, at the age of thirteen, was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge. He became a Constable scholar on 9 November 1641 and graduated BA on 20 April 1642. After the war began, his college became a prison and he was confined for expressions of his loyalty to the king. He escaped to Oxford where he joined the king's army and continued to serve in it for about two years, receiving many dangerous wounds. He was at Basing House when it was taken and at Wallingford, one of the last garrisons that held out for Charles I. In 1647 he returned to Halifax, where he preached his first sermon on 26 July and on 19 October received clandestine ordination from Thomas Fuller, bishop of Ardfert. He married Judith Deane (1629&#150;1700), daughter of Gilbert Deane of Exley Hall, one of the six clerks in chancery; they had eight children, but no grandchildren. As he was known to be a disaffected &#145;malignant&#146;, he moved to Prestwich-cum-Oldham in Lancashire where he became the curate in 1649 and acquired a house at Chadderton Fold near his royalist patron. Holding the living by subterfuges, he was able to defy the Manchester classis and was even approved briefly by the committee for plundered ministers. Eventually he lost the rectory of Prestwich and later, by the close of 1654, the chapel of Oldham.<br>
<br>After the Restoration, Dean Marsh of York promoted Lake on 10 April 1661 from the curacy of Halifax to the vicarage of Leeds, but the presbyterians, who preferred the popular Edward Bowles as vicar, raised such opposition that at his induction soldiers had to be called in to keep the peace. The opposition then entered a petition in chancery which failed. In 1661 Lake sought and received a royal mandate for the degree of DD from Cambridge University. Having been chosen to preach the first convocation sermon at York after the Restoration, he had attracted the attention of Gilbert Sheldon, bishop of London, who later sent for him to hold the living of St Botolph without Bishopsgate (22 May 1663). While in London, he formed a friendship with William Sancroft, then dean of St Paul's, and after diligent service during the great plague and the fire he received the prebend of Holborn (1667&#150;82). Two sermons were printed in 1671: a funeral sermon entitled <span class="italic"><i>Stephanos pistou</i>, or, The True Christian Character and Crown Described</span>, and one preached at Whitehall before the king on 29 May 1670.<br>
<br>Dean Hitch of York made Lake his procurator in 1670 and resident prebendary of Fridaythorpe from 1670 to 1684. Lake also acquired the benefices of Prestwich-cum-Oldham (1669&#150;85) and Carlton in Lindrick (1670&#150;82), the prebend of Halloughton, Southwell (1670&#150;82), and Bawtry Hospital (1671&#150;82). As magistrate of the cathedral precinct, he attacked the bad custom of boys noisily walking about the nave of York Minster during divine service, often pulling off the hats of boys whom he found wearing them. In 1673, disregarding the advice of other canons, he determined to put a stop to a revel held by the apprentices in the bell tower on Shrove Tuesday and so antagonized the revellers that two files of musketeers had to be brought in to restore order. Although advised to compromise, he persisted until he succeeded in putting a stop to the desecration of the minster. A new dean, installed in 1677, curtailed his responsibilities, so Lake and his college friend Samuel Drake edited the cavalier poetry of their Cambridge supervisor, John Cleveland, in <span class="italic">Clievelandi vindiciae</span> (1677).<br>
<br>Lake was archdeacon of Cleveland in 1680&#150;82, and in 1682 the earl of Derby offered him the bishopric of Sodor and Man. After one summer on the isle he was willing to exchange it for turbulent Bristol, surrendering his residency at York in 1684. The new bishop of Bristol in 1684&#150;5 was prepared to see his chancellor prosecute dissent rigorously, while he himself struggled with a vociferous dean who opposed him in his projects for improving the cathedral, especially his attempt to establish weekly communion. He complained piteously about his plight to his friend Archbishop Sancroft, who soon translated him to the more desirable see of Chichester in 1685. Before the move was complete, however, the accession of James II and subsequent rebellion of Monmouth required his return to Bristol where, at Keynsham Bridge, he narrowly escaped the rebels. In the interim between sees he carried out an arduous visitation of the diocese of Lichfield and Coventry for Sancroft, and in 1686 he conducted another commission for him at Salisbury.<br>
<br>As bishop of Chichester from 1685 to 1689, Lake carried out a primary visitation which produced an account of the lamentable state of the church in Sussex. Although suffering from gout, he was energetic in his efforts to raise standards and at the cathedral he established weekly communion. In 1687, in an attempt to placate dissenters and to preserve a common protestant front against royal policies, he moved the sermon from the choir to the nave where it could be better heard. Always obedient to Sancroft, he hurried to Lambeth in May 1688 to sign the petition to be excused from reading the king's declaration of indulgence, thus becoming one of the seven bishops committed to the Tower. After being acquitted and hailed as a national hero, he made another &#145;charitive&#146; visit throughout his rugged diocese and was received by the clergy and gentlemen of Sussex with great respect and good humour. Even the duke of Somerset gave him a warm reception at Petworth. But the euphoria was short-lived, because Lake was one of those bishops who were so committed to the doctrine of the divine right of kings and to the sacred nature of the oath to James II that they could not take the new oaths of allegiance to William and Mary in 1689 [<i>see also </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/47712', "Nonjuring bishops")</script>]. He believed that the day of judgement was as certain as the day of his deprivation, and in a correspondence with Thomas Comber, precentor of York, he worked out many &#145;Gordian knots&#146; in his own arguments. This correspondence, however, was cut short and Lake did not live to suffer actual deprivation. Suddenly falling ill from a summer fever and knowing his end was near, he dictated a profession of faith to his chaplain, Robert Jenkin. In this he solemnly asserted his fidelity to the Church of England and his adherence to its distinctive doctrine of non-resistance and passive obedience. The bishop signed this in the presence of five friends, who received communion with him, and three days later, on 30 August, he died, in the parish of St Olave Jewry, London. He was buried on 3 September in the church of St Botolph without Bishopsgate. The paper was published as <span class="italic">The declaration of the Right Reverend Father in God John late bishop of Chichester upon his death-bed</span>. It was, in part, a final answer to Comber, but it was widely misunderstood to be a polemic against the revolution settlement and this caused many disputatious pamphlets to be published on the subject. One defence of the profession was published anonymously by Jenkin, who gives the earliest account of the bishop's life. &#145;He was not easily moved but sedate and undaunted&#146;, Jenkin said, &#145;and he thanked God he never much knew what fear was, when he was satisfied in the Goodness of his cause&#146;  (Jenkin, 60).<br>
