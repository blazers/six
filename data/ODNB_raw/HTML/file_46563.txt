<span class="headword">Stone <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Wheeler]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (1803&#150;1881), <span class="occ">novelist and historian</span>, was born in Manchester and baptized at the cathedral on 25 April 1803. She was the daughter of John and Mary Wheeler. Her father was the publisher of the <span class="italic">Manchester Chronicle</span>, which had been founded by her grandfather Charles Wheeler in 1781. Her brother James published <span class="italic">Manchester: its Political, Social and Commercial History</span> (1836) and edited an anthology entitled <span class="italic">Manchester Poetry</span> (1838). She married, probably in the 1830s, and lived mainly in London. Her earliest and most interesting historical work was <span class="italic">The Art of Needlework</span> (1840), in which she called for recognition of women's creative contribution to culture. Stone lamented the &#145;ungallant silence of the historian&#146;, and praised the needle as an instrument of civilization, superior to the destructive sword  (pp. v&#150;vi). The book was reviewed in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> in August 1840, where it was described as &#145;a pleasant collection of antiquarian reading&#146;. Both the <span class="italic">Athenaeum</span> reviewer, who saw <span class="italic">The Art of Needlework</span> as a &#145;&#147;conservative&#148; production, intended to seduce the sex from revolutionary reading and writing, and to subdue their natures to a servile drudgery&#146;, and subsequent modern commentators have underestimated the vehemence with which Stone attacked the dominant male view of history in her study of a women's art form.<br>
<br>In 1842 Stone published a novel, <span class="italic">William Langshawe, the Cotton Lord</span>, a social protest novel of the hungry forties, which has been identified as the first novel about the manufacturing districts of Manchester written by a native. Reviewed in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> and <span class="italic">The Examiner</span>, it was a work full of careful social observation, supported by some research: Stone had probably read recent government reports, and works such as John Fielden's <span class="italic">The Curse of the Factory System</span> (1836). She drew a sympathetic but not uncritical portrait of the industrial magnate, and such passages as her description of Manchester on a race day show a keen eye for the dynamics of urban life. The plot of the novel detailed the seduction of a working-class girl by a rich manufacturer's son, which probably influenced the mistaken identification of Stone as the author of <span class="italic">Mary Barton</span> (1843). <span class="italic">William Langshawe</span> was followed in 1843 by <span class="italic">The Young Milliner</span>, a topical examination of the plight of the seamstress, partly inspired by her earlier work on needlework. In this bleak novel, she criticized middle- and upper-class women for the oppression which their pursuit of fashion imposed on their poorer sisters: one seamstress dies of overwork, while another is driven into prostitution. In <span class="italic">Miss Pen and her Niece</span> (1843), an undistinguished historical novel set in the early eighteenth century, Stone attempted another popular novelistic genre of the 1840s; the third volume of this work contains a novelette, <span class="italic">Sir Eustace de Lucie</span>, a medieval tale based on Wordsworth's poem &#145;The Horn of Egremont Castle&#146; (1807). Her next novel, <span class="italic">Mr Dalton's Legatee</span> (1850), had a contemporary setting: it is a penetrating study of an ambitious and mercenary woman with an impeccably plausible manner. In 1856 Elizabeth Stone published a work for children, <span class="italic">Ellen Merton, or, The Pic-Nic</span>, a moral tale about the dangers of telling white lies, which was followed by <span class="italic">A Handbook to the Christian Year, for Young People</span> (1860), a commentary on Christian festivals, displaying Tractarian leanings.<br>
<br>Stone's historical work was continued in <span class="italic">Chronicles of Fashion</span> (2 vols., 1845), a lightweight and light-hearted examination of manners, customs, and morals from the reign of Elizabeth I to the early nineteenth century. <span class="italic">God's Acre, or, Historical Notices Relating to Churchyards</span> (1858) adopted the same anecdotal approach, interlaced with religious sentiments and personal reminiscences. It was harshly reviewed in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, where Stone's &#145;trite comments&#146; and haphazard borrowings from &#145;very accessible sources (and not the best of these)&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 1858, 778) were criticized. In the preface to <span class="italic">God's Acre</span>, Stone mentioned that she was going blind, but there are two further publications in her name, <span class="italic">Angels</span> (1859) and a verse work, <span class="italic">Three Incidents, Strictly True</span> (1873), published at Worthing. It has been suggested that she adopted a pseudonym in later life, publishing <span class="italic">Royal Favourites</span> (2 vols., 1865), <span class="italic">Political Women</span> (2 vols., 1873), <span class="italic">History of Europe</span> (1877), and <span class="italic">Turkey, Old and New</span> (1880) under the name of Sutherland Menzies  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>, suppl.). But, given her prediction in <span class="italic">God's Acre</span> that this would be her last work requiring &#145;any <i>additional</i> reading&#146;, it seems questionable whether she was the author of these works. By 1871 she was a widow, living with her unmarried younger sister Mary in a lodging house at 7 Alfred Place, Worthing, Sussex, where she died on 2 August 1881.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Stone's historical publications, apart from <span class="italic">The Art of Needlework</span>, are undistinguished; her interest in &#145;manners and morals&#146; history was typical of the woman writer of the period, but, while the statistical and critical techniques essential to modern social history remained rudimentary, her work was necessarily no more than anecdotal. <span class="italic">William Langshawe</span> and <span class="italic">The Young Milliner</span> have deservedly received more attention, and, ironically, they now constitute her more substantial contribution to social history.<br>
