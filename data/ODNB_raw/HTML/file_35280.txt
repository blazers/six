<span class="headword">O'Brien,  Peter</span>, Baron O'Brien  (1842&#150;1914), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born on 29 June 1842 at Carnelly House, Ballynalacken, co. Clare, the fifth son of John O'Brien JP (1794&#150;1855), of Ballynalacken, MP for Limerick from 1841 to 1852, and his wife, Ellen (<i>d</i>. 1866), daughter of Jeremiah Murphy, of Hyde Park, co. Cork. Brought up a Catholic and educated at Clongowes Wood School, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 5 November 1858; he graduated BA in 1865 and MA in 1874. He entered the Middle Temple in London on 9 June 1862 and was called to the Irish bar at King's Inns, Dublin, in 1865. He devilled for Christopher Palles (later chief baron) and acted as registrar for his uncle, Mr Justice James O'Brien. He failed to be elected as a whig for County Clare in 1879 and became queen's counsel in 1880. On 8 August 1867 he married Annie Clarke, daughter of Robert Hare Clarke JP, of Bansha, co. Tipperary, and they had two daughters and one son.<br>
<br>Ireland was in a state of political upheaval after the failure of home rule, and O'Brien took silk at a time when judges were under police protection, prosecutors ran the risk of intimidation, the country was subject to insurrection and violence, and the Land League conspiracy was at its height. Retained by the crown in all important cases, O'Brien was rapidly promoted to the position of serjeant (1884), solicitor-general (1887), and attorney-general (1888). His attorney-generalship was notable for his administration of Arthur Balfour's <span class="roman">Crimes Act</span>, passed in an attempt to restore national order. O'Brien was aided by Edward Carson and Stephen Ronan in his efforts. Where possible, every prosecution was apparently tested microscopically on appeal. Public order was eventually restored and in 1889 O'Brien was appointed lord chief justice. He remained in the post for twenty-four years, enjoying a reputation for an urbane sense of humour. He won the confidence of juries by his rectitude and leniency. He was popular with the bar and the public alike. He was also hospitable, often entertaining at his residence in Donnybrook, co. Dublin, and hunting with friends and colleagues.<br>
<br>O'Brien retired in 1913, having been created a baronet on 28 September 1891; he was raised to the peerage as Baron O'Brien of Kilfenora on 16 June 1900. He lived at 41 Merrion Square East, Dublin, and at Airfield, Donnybrook, co. Dublin, where he died on 7 September 1914, survived by his wife; their son had died young, and so the peerage became extinct with his death. A Roman Catholic, he was known to most not as Lord O'Brien but informally, as Peter.<br>
