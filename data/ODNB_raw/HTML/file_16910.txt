<span class="headword">Lockhart, Sir  William Stephen Alexander</span>  (1841&#150;1900), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Milton Lockhart, Lanarkshire, on 2 September 1841, fourth son of the Revd Lawrence Lockhart of Wicketshaw and Milton Lockhart, and his first wife, Louisa, daughter of David Blair, an East India merchant, and nephew of John Gibson Lockhart. His three elder brothers were John Somerville Lockhart, Major-General David Blair Lockhart of Milton Lockhart, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16905/', "Laurence William Maxwell Lockhart")</script>, the novelist. Lockhart was educated at the University of Glasgow before starting a military career. In 1864 he married Caroline Amelia, daughter of Major-General E. Lascelles Dennys; in 1888 he married his second wife, Mary Katherine, daughter of Captain William Eccles, who survived him.<br>
<br>Lockhart entered the Indian army as an ensign on 4 October 1858 at the age of seventeen, joining the 44th Bengal native infantry. He was promoted lieutenant (19 June 1859), captain (16 December 1868), major (9 June 1877), lieutenant-colonel (6 April 1879), brevet colonel (6 April 1883), major-general (1 September 1891), lieutenant-general (1 April 1894), and general (9 November 1896).<br>
<br>Lockhart served in Oudh during the Indian mutiny with the 5th fusiliers in 1858&#150;9, and then as adjutant of the 14th Bengal lancers in the Bhutan campaigns from 1864 to 1866. During the latter he distinguished himself on a reconnaissance to Chirung, demonstrating his skill at hill warfare, keen eye for ground, and skill at outpost and scouting duty. His services were acknowledged by the government of India.<br>
<br>In the Abyssinian expedition of 1867&#150;8 Lockhart was aide-de-camp to Brigadier-General J. Merewether, commanding the cavalry brigade, and taking part in the action of Arogee and the capture of Magdala. He was mentioned in dispatches.<br>
<br>Lockhart was then appointed deputy assistant quartermaster-general with the Hazara field force, under Brigadier-General Alfred Thomas Wilde, during the Black Mountain expedition in 1868, for which he was mentioned in dispatches. Shortly afterwards he was awarded the bronze medal of the Royal Humane Society for rescuing two women from drowning in the Morar Lake, Gwalior, on 26 December 1869.<br>
<br>Lockhart served ten years on the staff and was appointed successively deputy assistant and assistant quartermaster-general in the Bengal army. He also served twice in Achin in Sumatra between 1875 and 1877, the second time as military attach&eacute; to the Dutch army, when he participated in the assault and capture of Lambadde, for which he was mentioned in dispatches, offered the Netherlands order of William, which he was not allowed to accept, and received the Dutch war medal and clasp. He contracted malaria, however, and returned to Singapore seriously ill.<br>
<br>During the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878&#150;80) Lockhart was initially appointed road commandant in the Khyber Pass, safeguarding it from attack by the Afridis, then, in November 1879, assistant quartermaster-general at Kabul. He fought at Mir Karez, Takht-i-Shah, and around Kabul under Sir Frederick Roberts in December 1879, and was subsequently deputy adjutant and quartermaster-general to Sir Donald Stewart commanding in northern Afghanistan, returning to India through the Khyber Pass in August 1880. Lockhart was mentioned in dispatches and made a CB (military division).<br>
<br>Lockhart was deputy quartermaster-general in the intelligence branch at headquarters between 1880 and 1885, apart from a trip to Achin to rescue the crew of the <i>Nisero</i> in 1884. He then commanded the 24th Punjab infantry, but in June 1885 was appointed an envoy under the foreign department on a political mission to Chitral. He commanded a brigade during the pacification of Upper Burma from September 1886 to March 1887, for which he was mentioned in dispatches, thanked by the government of India, and made a KCB and a CSI.<br>
<br>On his return to India, Lockhart commanded a second-class district in Bengal, but a severe attack of malaria compelled him to return home. For six months he was employed at the India Office preparing an account of his explorations in central Asia, and in April 1889 was appointed assistant military secretary for Indian affairs at the Horse Guards. Lockhart returned to India in November 1890 to command the prestigious Punjab frontier force, first as brigadier-general and then as major-general, until March 1895. He conducted a succession of punitive military expeditions against the transborder Pathan peoples inhabiting the hills bordering the Punjab, establishing a reputation as the Indian army's foremost expert on frontier warfare. Lockhart commanded the Miranzai field force in January and February 1891, the 3rd brigade of the Hazara field force in March and April, and the Miranzai field force again from April to June. He was mentioned in the governor-general's dispatch and was promoted major-general. Lockhart then commanded the Isazai field force in 1892 and the Waziristan expedition in 1894&#150;5, was again mentioned in dispatches by the government of India, and was made a KCSI. In 1895 he was given the Punjab command.<br>
<br>In 1897 Lockhart was placed in command of the 40,000 strong Tirah expeditionary force, after Afridis attacked British outposts along the north-west frontier during the most serious outbreak of resistance to British rule in India since the mutiny. During the difficult extended fighting in the inaccessible mountains of Tirah, he skilfully conducted punitive operations against elusive Afridi and Orakzai fighters, armed with modern rifles. Though for the most part consisting of guerrilla warfare, the campaign also included such bitterly contested engagements as the attack at Dargai and the withdrawal of the 2nd division down the Bara valley. For his services he received the thanks of the government of India, was made a GCB, and succeeded Sir George White as commander-in-chief in India in 1898. Lockhart was plagued by ill health, however, from diseases contracted during earlier military campaigns, and finally died at his residence, the Treasury Gate, Fort William, Calcutta, from malaria, complicating gout, on 18 March 1900. He was buried the following day at Fort William military cemetery.<br>
