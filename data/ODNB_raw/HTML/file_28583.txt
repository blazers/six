<span class="headword">Wallop,  Richard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1616, <em>d.</em> 1697), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was baptized at Bugbrooke, Northamptonshire, on 10 June 1616, the son of Richard Wallop and his wife, Mary Spencer, sister and coheir of William Spencer of Everton, Northamptonshire. The Wallop family was originally from Hampshire. At eighteen Wallop matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, on 10 October 1634. He graduated BA on 2 June 1635, and was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in February 1646.<br>
<br>Of his career during the interregnum nothing can be said, although Wallop may have acquired in those years the anti-royalist sensibilities that some have discerned in his later life. His marriage to Mary produced at least one daughter; his wife outlived him. In 1666 he became a bencher, and in 1673 was appointed treasurer of the Middle Temple.<br>
<br>Wallop rose to prominence during the final years of Charles II's reign and throughout the reign of James II. Characterized by one contemporary as an &#145;eminent lawyer&#146;, he became one of the most visible of the whig lawyers, representing whig defendants in many of the great state trials of the era  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, James II, 2.150). In 1682 he assisted in the defence of the City of London against Charles II's writ of <i>quo warranto</i>. He defended several whigs against charges of rioting during parliamentary elections, and represented Sir John Hampden in his trial for his part in the Rye House plot. When two men were arrested for charging the king with the murder of the earl of Essex, Wallop defended them and was himself charged with a &#145;zeal for faction and sedition&#146;  (Irving, 195). He also assisted the cause of the plantiff in <i>Godden v. Hales</i>, and even participated in the defence of Titus Oates on perjury charges, although on this occasion he appears to have acted as assigned counsel. Wallop's regular participation in the defence of the whigs earned him the truly remarkable hostility of Chief Justice George Jeffreys. When Wallop appeared before Jeffreys to defend Richard Baxter against sedition charges, Jeffreys said from the bench:<blockquote>Mr. Wallop, I observe you are in all these dirty causes; and were it not for you gentlemen of the long robe, who should have more wit and honesty to support and hold these factious knaves by the chin, we should not be at the pass we are at. (Foss, <span class="italic">Judges</span>, 7.697)</blockquote>Jeffreys bitterly berated Wallop for his defence of Lord Grey on the charge of having &#145;debauched&#146; Lady Henrietta Berkeley. During the trial of Thomas Rosewell for high treason, Jeffreys ejected Wallop from the court, refusing him even the right to observe the trial from the audience. It is doubtful whether these confrontations rendered Wallop &#145;eternally famous&#146;, as one nineteenth-century authority has asserted, but he is indeed mostly remembered for providing Jeffreys with opportunities for flaunting his vicious temper.<br>
<br>It should be noted that Wallop was capable of representing clients whose political views he probably found less than congenial. Most remarkably he represented the duke of York when indicted for recusancy in 1681. He served as counsel for the maligned &#145;popish Lords&#146; Lord Petre and Viscount Stafford in 1679&#150;80. On 4 February 1684 he appeared before king's bench as one of the earl of Danby's councillors. Indeed, in 1685 Lord Brandon felt it plausible to recommend Wallop as a king's councillor. Perhaps not surprisingly, the earl of Sunderland declined the advice on behalf of the king. Jeffreys's biographer Irving described Wallop as &#145;tactless&#146; and unlearned, but even he (a virtual apologist for Jeffreys and a biased source) admits that nothing substantiates Jeffreys's charge that Wallop had a &#145;hectoring and swaggering manner&#146;  (Irving, 303). Mostly Wallop seems to have had a remarkable nose for publicity. He involved himself in a great many high-profile political trials. On 16 March 1696 he was made a baron of the exchequer, but did not live to enjoy the honour for long. He died on 22 August 1697 and was buried four days later in the church at the Middle Temple.<br>
