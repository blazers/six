<span class="headword">Glen,  William</span>  (1778&#150;1849), <span class="occ">missionary and biblical translator</span>, was born in Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, on 30 January 1778, the son of William Glen, tailor. He matriculated at Glasgow University in 1797 but left without a degree and studied at the theological college of the Associate Synod in Selkirk, under George Lawson. He was ordained minister of a newly formed congregation of Burgher seceders in Annan, Dumfriesshire, on 15 April 1807.<br>
<br>On 28 September 1810 Glen married Margaret Scott of Annan; they had five sons, the eldest two being twins. Glen and his wife provided lodgings in their house for Thomas Carlyle, then mathematics master at his old school, Annan Academy. Carlyle praised Glen in his <span class="italic">Reminiscences</span> (1881) as &#145;a most pure and excellent man, of correct superior intellect, and of much modest piety and amiability&#146;, and described his wife as &#145;a handsome, brave, and cheery-hearted woman&#146;.<br>
<br>Glen resigned from Annan in November 1816; his discouragement was partly caused by the friction created in trying to raise sufficient funds to carry on the work of the congregation. He offered his services to the Edinburgh Missionary Society as an overseas candidate, thus fulfilling a youthful ambition. After training, Glen, accompanied by his wife, went as a missionary to Astrakhan in southern Russia, where he remained for five years. He achieved little in the way of conversion but was more successful in his efforts to master the Persian, Arabic, and Turkish languages. About 1823 he began what was to be his principal life's work, the translation of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> from Hebrew into Persian. He began with <span class="roman">Psalms</span> and <span class="roman">Proverbs</span>, his translations being published separately by the British and Foreign Bible Society. By the time he returned to Scotland in 1834 his reputation as a Persian scholar was already established.<br>
<br>Glen continued working on his translation in Scotland until 1837, when he was sent to Persia, by the synod of the United Secession church, to complete his labours. He lived in Tabriz and Tehran; in 1843 he returned to Scotland, taking his completed manuscript with him. It was printed by Thomas Constable of Edinburgh and published in 1845, the cost met by the mission board of the United Secession church, aided by a grant of &pound;500 from the British and Foreign Bible Society. In 1845 he was awarded the degree of DD by the University of St Andrews.<br>
<br>Glen volunteered to supervise the distribution of his work in Persia and to circulate with it a new edition of the Persian translation of the <span class="roman">New Testament</span> by Henry Martyn. Glen and his son Andrew sailed for Persia by way of Constantinople in 1847. In January 1848 they were received by the shah, who was presented with copies of the <span class="roman">Old</span> and <span class="roman">New</span> testaments and a translation of <span class="italic">Sketch of the Evidence from Prophecy</span> (1823) by Alexander Keith. After a short illness Glen died of dysentery in Tehran on 12 January 1849 and was buried there in the Armenian cemetery.<br>
