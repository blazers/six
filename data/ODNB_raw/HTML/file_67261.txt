<span class="headword">Reynolds,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>Captain Pouch]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1607), <span class="occ">enclosure protester</span>, was a leader in the midland revolt of 1607. Since no record appears to have survived of either his examination or trial and the only references to his involvement in the rising omit his place of origin, it is impossible to say anything of his earlier life. A chronicler's later report includes the marginal note that he was either a pedlar or a tinker. If true, then Reynolds was one of those masterless men whose mobility, and the anonymity this brought, alarmed early modern governments.<br>
<br>The background to the midland revolt, and to Reynolds's involvement in it, is to be found in the economic pressures created by the long population growth of the sixteenth century and, as a response to these and the temporary relaxation of restrictive laws, the intensification of enclosure. The latter development was particularly marked in the open-field communities of the heavy claylands of the midland counties which formed the heartland of the rising. Protests began in Northamptonshire on May eve 1607, but quickly spread to the adjoining counties of Leicestershire and Warwickshire and crowds numbered in their thousands tore down enclosures. Reynolds's direct leadership and the wider rumours that circulated of his role as Captain Pouch contributed to the scale of operation and to the co-ordination and mobility across county boundaries that distinguished the 1607 episode from other protests against enclosure in the period.<br>
<br>Since there is no direct evidence for Reynolds's role it can only be recovered from the correspondence of the authorities charged with suppressing the protests and from a later well-informed account of the rising added by John Howes to his 1615 edition of John Stow's <span class="italic">Chronicles</span>. As Howes's account makes clear, Reynolds was a charismatic figure. Adopting the pseudonym of captain, an inversion of military authority, was not uncommon among leaders of protest in this period. According to Howes, Reynolds gained the title of Pouch because of a great leather pouch he wore which, he claimed, contained &#145;sufficient matter to defend them against all comers&#146;  (Stow, 889). His ability to command support was also based, as with other leaders of popular protest in the Europe of his time, on claims to authority from both the king and God. According to Howes, Pouch claimed &#145;that in this present worke, hee was directed by the Lord of Heaven&#146;. A claim to divine inspiration could challenge the culture of obedience that characterized early modern monarchical states and Reynolds's statement, &#145;that he was sent of God to satisff[i]e all degrees whatsoever&#146; might indeed be taken to represent such a challenge  (Stow, 889). However, Reynolds combined this with a claim to have been given authority from the king to throw down enclosures. Although there was no truth to this, it reflected Reynolds's acute understanding of the need to assert legitimacy for the protest if he was to gain support in a political culture in which popular protest was formally proscribed. His claim to royal authority echoed the protestations of loyalty to the king made in the protesters' petitions in 1607 and commonly in other smaller- scale protests against enclosure in the period. Despite the fact that Reynolds's supporters called themselves Levellers and Diggers, titles which later took on more a more radical meaning in the English revolution, their surviving statements make clear that they saw their activities of levelling and digging up enclosures as being for the good of the commonwealth.<br>
<br>Apart from actively leading the main body of protesters, Reynolds may also have had a hand in the appeal, issued under the name of the Diggers of Warwickshire, which combined professions of loyalty to the king with a biting attack on those enclosers whose greed was thought to have brought poverty and threatened famine. It is also likely that Reynolds was involved in the direct negotiations that took place with the authorities in Warwickshire in which the protesters, again professing their loyalty, promised to disband on news of the king's being informed of their grievances and agreeing to their reformation. Despite the potential for radicalism in Reynolds's leadership, his reported orders to his followers &#145;not to sweare, nor to offer violence to any person, but to ply their busine[s] and to make fa[i]re works&#146;  (Stow, 889) reflected a concern to keep protest within the bounds of order and was intended to contrast the orderly nature of protest with the greater threat to the commonwealth from the disorderly activities of the enclosers. Accounts by Howes and others acknowledged that, while the protesters wreaked violence upon hedges and ditches, they refrained from theft or personal violence. Despite this the central government became alarmed by the persistence of the protests and, angered by what it saw as the failure of the provincial authorities to stop the protests, issued instructions for the suppression of the rising, by force if necessary.<br>
<br>In the first week of June, Reynolds was captured after a clash at Withybrook in Warwickshire, another site of enclosure, and was sent &#145;as the chiefest leader&#146;  (<span class="italic">Hastings MSS</span>, 4.193) to London. By 9 June he was in custody and had been examined by the privy council. Although no further record survives of him, Howes records that he was found guilty of treason and that his execution was &#145;made exemplary&#146;. Despite this, rumours of Pouch's activities continued to circulate, with at least one man setting himself up as his lieutenant and claiming from him authority to throw down all enclosures between Northampton and York. Having examined him, James I's privy council described Reynolds as a &#145;base ringleader and turbulent varlet&#146;  (ibid., 4.194) and Howes in a deliberate slight reported that his pouch was found to contain only a piece of mouldy cheese. But the reports of Reynolds's actions suggest that his leadership reflected a level of political knowledge and ability also to be found in other plebeian leaders of protest in this period. Late in the twentieth century the story of &#145;Captain Pouch and a few ill-armed peasants&#146;, written reputedly &#145;on memory's page&#146;, surfaced again briefly as a dramatic motif in one of the novels by the midlands author J. L. Carr  (<span class="italic">Battle of Pollocks Crossing</span>, 1985, 104, 107&#150;8, 129&#150;30).<br>
