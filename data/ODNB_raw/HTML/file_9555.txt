<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Gerald</span>, ninth earl of Kildare  (1487&#150;1534), <span class="occ">lord deputy of Ireland</span>, was the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9554/', "Gerald Fitzgerald, eighth earl of Kildare (1456?&#150;1513)")</script>, lord deputy of Ireland, and his first wife, Alison Eustace (<i>d</i>. 1495), daughter and coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8938/', "Roland FitzEustace or Eustace, first baron of Portlester")</script>. He had at least six sisters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69168/', "Margaret Butler, countess of Ossory and Ormond (d. 1542)")</script>, and subsequently seven half-brothers, children of his father's second marriage, to Elizabeth St John, the king's cousin.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlylife"></a>Education and early life</h2>Lord Gerald spent his formative years at court, a pledge for his father's loyalty, being brought up with princes Arthur and Henry. Although Kildare's pardon of 1493 was on condition that he send his heir to England, more probably Lord Gerald first came to court after his father's arrest in February 1495. Little is known of his sojourn there, where he received a conventional English aristocratic education, with exposure to the classics and vernacular Renaissance literature. Presumably this is where he first acquired his taste for the numerous Latin and French books which later adorned his library. The works in Gaelic, mainly saints' lives, no doubt reflect Gerald's interest in Gaelic culture following his return to Ireland. Gear&oacute;id &Oacute;g (Gerald the younger), as he was known to Gaelic annalists, was later a noted patron of native learning, employing in his court rhymers, a physician, a judge, and captains of his kerne and galloglass.<br>
<br>In December 1497 the king paid &pound;2 &#145;to a surgeon that heled my lord Kildares son&#146;  (TNA: PRO, E 101/414/16, fol. 7<i>v</i>), and in 1502 Lord Gerald played a leading role at Prince Arthur's funeral in Worcester Cathedral. Reflecting the family's enhanced status at the Tudor court, he was permitted to marry the king's kinswoman, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1517), daughter of Sir John Zouche of Codnor, Derbyshire, in July 1503. The couple's jointure included four manors in the Meath&#150;Kildare marches, granted by his father, and the king's manor of Cawston, Norfolk. The following month Lord Gerald finally returned to Ireland with his wife and father, having spent eight years in London. He was appointed treasurer in February 1504, although Sir William Darcy continued to discharge most of the duties as his deputy; and that August he also received his first serious taste of military action at the battle of Knockdoe. Appointed by Kildare to command the reserve, Lord Gerald committed them too soon, so allowing the Irish horse to capture the English carriage and a few gentlemen, even though he fought well. After the old king's death the young Henry VIII remembered his boyhood companion with a grant during pleasure of Ardmullan Manor, Meath; and when Gerald's father likewise died, in September 1513, the young earl, having been elected justiciar by the Irish council, was quickly confirmed as deputy by the king.<h2>
<a name="Theyoungearl"></a>The young earl</h2>Earl Gerald's acquisition of what was among the most influential of Tudor offices had been far smoother than his father's route to power. Yet circumstances were changing, despite the ninth earl's clear dominance of Irish affairs over the next six years. Initially Henry VIII's indifference to the minutiae of administration allowed Kildare almost a free hand in ruling this remote Tudor outpost which scarcely registered in the king's plans to recover his French territories. Yet once his concerns were aroused, Henry expected more, and sooner, of ruling magnates such as Kildare, and showed himself less sympathetic than his father to the particular difficulties of ruling and defending a turbulent marcher society. Concurrently, within the English pale, the earl was increasingly a victim of his family's success: power was passing to leaders who no longer remembered the crisis of lordship which had befallen the Englishry sixty years earlier. Like their counterparts in lowland England, the prosperous gentry and rich merchants of the pale maghery began to view with a more jaundiced eye the activities of marcher lords like Kildare, notably their tolerance of border lawlessness.<br>
<br>Kildare's cross-border alliances likewise attracted suspicion. In 1514 successful expeditions into Leix (Laois) and East Breifne to break the castles of O'More and O'Reilly, and then into Munster to support his client Piers Butler, marked the start of frequent expeditions into remote parts by which the earl, like his father, maintained the Kildare ascendancy. Initially too he was even more successful, destroying Leap Castle in Ely O'Carroll in 1516 which, as one annalist observed, his father had failed to do. In 1517 he even invaded Tyrone in support of his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20767/', "Conn Bacach O'Neill")</script>, capturing Dungannon Castle. On 6 October, however, his wife died suddenly at Lucan, and was buried with great pomp near his mother in the Observant house at Kilcullen.<br>
<br>The first significant challenge to Kildare's rule occurred in May 1515 when he went to court for consultations and with bills for a proposed parliament. He had to answer questions about his father's estate and his stepmother's claims on it, but Sir William Darcy, since ousted as treasurer by Lord Slane, put in articles for a council meeting at Greenwich complaining that Gaelic customs were swamping the Englishry, that the deputy was making peace and war without the council's consent, and that he had imposed coign and livery, cartage, and other unlawful levies on the king's subjects. Other tracts about the decay of Ireland and plans for its reformation, notably those by Patrick Finglas, chief justice of the king's bench in Ireland, attest to a more general unease in pale circles about the conduct of government. Yet Kildare was confirmed as deputy, and the series of royal grants which followed his return in September underlined the king's continuing confidence in the earl. Besides a licence to hold parliament (which, meeting between February and October 1516, renewed the subsidy), the earl received a grant in tail male of Ardmullan and of lands and rights in east Ulster, charters of incorporation for his boroughs of Kildare and Athy, and licence to found and endow a college at Maynooth, his principal residence. The resultant college was a lavish chantry endowment, with the castle church there also rebuilt, on a much grander scale than similar projects by other pale families, and in keeping with the furnishing of his castle there which &#145;was accompted, for housholde stuffe and utensiles, one of the richest Earle his houses under the Crowne of Englande&#146;  (<span class="italic">Holinshed's Chronicles</span>, 300).<h2>
<a name="Estatesandrevenues"></a>Estates and revenues</h2>These patents were very much in keeping with the earl's estate management policies. The Kildare estates had been greatly extended under the earl's father, particularly around the pale's southern and western marches, but the work of developing these borderlands fell mainly to Earl Gerald. In 1518 he began the unique rental book (now preserved in the British Library, Harley MS 3756) which gives a summary account of his landed possessions and other rights, his tributes or &#145;duties upon Irisshmen&#146;, annuities received, annual gifts of horse and harness, lands set to farm, an inventory of his plate, and the contents of his library. No doubt most of this reflected his father's achievements, but the ninth earl perfected the system of rent-free holdings to maintain his horsemen, and was credited with shifting most of the burden of his kerne and galloglass onto neighbouring Irishmen. The defence of key marches he entrusted to his numerous kinsmen, but Kildare's rental shows that every major Gaelic chief in a wide arc around the pale, plus a host of weaker ones and others further afield&#151;twenty-four altogether&#151;was paying tribute for the earl's protection (<i>sl&aacute;nuigheacht</i>).<br>
<br>Kildare also extended and reorganized the military service owed by his tenants in Meath, Kildare, and Carlow, co-ordinating it through four chief castles at Portlester, Rathangan, Kildare, and Athy against the military threat from the Gaelic midlands, while their labour services were employed in strengthening the marches with castles and ditches. Not surprisingly, the earl soon acquired a reputation as &#145;the gretest improver of his landis in this land&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers Published under &hellip; Henry the Eighth</span>, 11 vols., 1830&#150;52, 2.300). Yet one region in which the ninth earl was probably the chief architect of territorial expansion was along the east Ulster coast from Greencastle to Strangford, where his annual rental eventually exceeded Ir&pound;150. By 1534 his estates alone were worth Ir&pound;1585 a year, notably lands in co. Kildare (Ir&pound;709) and Meath (Ir&pound;460), and laid the foundations of an extensive political connection reflected in his gifts of horse and harness to the lordship's leading landowners, local Kildare gentry, estate officials, Gaelic nobles, and even Tudor courtiers. On average he gave away sixty-five chief horses annually from his stud farms in Maynooth, Fercullen, Annaly, Fassaghbantry, and in Ulster (containing in 1534 an estimated 1000 horses and mares) together with thirty-three hackneys and a dozen sets of harness. These gifts must have cost at least Ir&pound;800 a year, but with an overall income comfortably exceeding Ir&pound;2000, Earl Gerald was among the ten wealthiest Tudor magnates, standing head and shoulders above other Irish lords.<h2>
<a name="Feudsanddisputes"></a>Feuds and disputes</h2>Kildare's next visit to court, in September 1519, was far less successful. It was rumoured that he was coming to choose a wife. By then, however, he had quarrelled with his former client Piers Butler. Butler claimed the earldom of Ormond as heir male on the seventh earl's death, and was supported by the deputy and council who granted him possession of the Irish estates in 1516. Yet the king then ordered Kildare to give his lawful assistance to the seventh earl's daughters who received livery of the English estates. Presumably Butler felt that Kildare had not done enough to support him. By 1518 more complaints about Kildare rule had surfaced, with the king for once taking a personal interest in Irish affairs. Kildare was commissioned to appoint his own deputy, his uncle Maurice Fitzgerald, during his absence; but this time he was replaced as governor by the earl of Surrey. He was detained at court, ostensibly on charges of maladministration, but the disputes in council between Kildare and Cardinal Wolsey probably also reflected a personality clash. In May 1520 Kildare was bound over not to leave the London area, although in June he accompanied the king to the Field of Cloth of Gold. In July, when suspected of using his friends to make trouble for Surrey, he gave fresh bonds to appear before Wolsey on demand. He was later imprisoned but released in November. He was once again suspected the following spring and bound over in 10,000 marks to appear in Star Chamber at Easter, not to leave London, nor to send messengers into Ireland without permission. By 1522, however, he had been exonerated. His second marriage, to the king's cousin Lady Elizabeth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69231/', "Fitzgerald, Elizabeth")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11560/', "Thomas Grey, marquess of Dorset")</script>, in 1522, not only reflected Kildare's restoration to favour but also provided the earl with an influential advocate of Geraldine interests at court. Their daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9549/', "Elizabeth Fiennes de Clinton")</script>, became the much heralded &#145;Fair Geraldine&#146;.<br>
<br>On new year's day 1523 Kildare and his countess reached Ireland, his return having been requested by Surrey's successor, the earl of Ormond, to restore order among his kinsmen who were uncontrollable in his absence. Yet quarrels soon recommenced between the two earls, with Kildare acting as if he were still governor, leading an army into Ulster, allegedly to defend his lands there. Despite the king's intervention and an arbitration by Irish councillors in November, the feud continued, culminating in the murder by Kildare's brother James of Robert Talbot, sheriff of Dublin, while he was riding to Kilkenny to keep Christmas with Ormond. Eventually, three influential commissioners were dispatched to Ireland in summer 1524 to compose disputes, particularly the Geraldine&#150;Butler feud, after which Kildare was reappointed deputy. Both earls gave bonds to observe the terms of a lengthy composition between them, but the displacement of one earl by the other did little to heal the feud which recommenced after an interval. In a revealing response in August 1525, when he detected a note of suspicion and displeasure in the king's letter, Kildare replied that he was peculiarly bound to Henry, not just by allegiance, but by service in their youth, good lordship, and grants of land, and because his first wife and present wife were the king's kinswomen. &#145;And though there were no suche cause, yet cowd I fynde in my hart to serve Your Grace before all the princes in the world&#146; because of Henry's nobleness, prowess, and equity; &#145;And besides that, I do knowe right wele, if I did the contrary, it shulde bee the distruccion of me and my sequele for ever&#146;  (<span class="italic">State Papers Published under &hellip; Henry the Eighth</span>, 11 vols., 1830&#150;52, 2.125).<br>
<br>Hostings by Kildare against O'Donnell and then into Connaught in 1526 underlined his undiminished military prowess. In 1525, moreover, the earl's public crucifixion of the archdeacon of Leighlin for murdering his bishop also excited comment. With both earls inciting their Gaelic satellites to raid the lands of their rivals, the king was again forced to intervene. In August 1526 he summoned them both to court. By then his suspicions had been further aroused by Kildare's inability to arrest his kinsman James Fitzgerald, earl of Desmond, then in league with Fran&ccedil;ois I, and&#151;so the 1536 attainder asserted&#151;by Kildare's treasonable communications with him. This time, however, Kildare took steps to avoid a repetition of the lengthy detention which followed his previous summons. Allegedly, individual councillors were sworn to write in his favour; he asked his Gaelic allies to keep the peace until the king's intentions were apparent; and in the expectation that he would again be forbidden to send messages into Ireland, he arranged with his officers that if he sent home his daughter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69167/', "Alice Fleming, Lady Slane")</script>, this was a &#145;prevy token&#146; that he &#145;was not at his pleasour to come home&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 60/1, 101.139). Gradually, matters developed into a battle of wills between king and earl.<h2>
<a name="Summonedtocourt"></a>Summoned to court</h2>Kildare left his brother Sir Thomas Fitzgerald of Leixlip as vice-deputy, but Fitzgerald was soon replaced by Lord Delvin, apparently on the king's orders. There matters rested for almost eighteen months, with Kildare committed to the duke of Norfolk's custody at Newington, Middlesex, and the Irish council warning, in the face of mounting disorders, that &#145;there is none of this land that can or may do for defence of the same so well as [Kildare]&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 1/51, fols. 18&#150;19). In May 1528 Delvin was kidnapped by O'Connor in a parley, and in July Kildare sent Alice home. She rode straight to O'Connor, who recommenced hostilities, while Fitzgerald, elected captain by the council in the emergency, subsequently permitted O'Connor &#145;to invade, rob and destroy&#146; the king's subjects &#145;by reason of certain intelligence had with O'Connor, contrary to his allegiance&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ormond Deeds, 1509&#150;1547</span>, no. 144). Not only was Kildare again imprisoned, he came within an ace of being tried for treason. His brother, daughter, and a leading councillor were all pardoned for treason in 1529. The earl received a general pardon in 1530. When Kildare was posthumously attainted of treason in 1536 the act took effect from 8 July 1528, the date on which, allegedly, he had through his daughter stirred up war against the king's subjects.<br>
<br>Thinking that Kildare &#145;goeth fraudelently about to colour that the king shuld thinke that his grace couthe not be served there but oonly by hym&#146;  (BL, Cotton MS Titus B. xi (11), fols. 349&#150;50), in August 1528 Henry reappointed as deputy Piers Butler, now created earl of Ossory instead of Ormond, against the advice of Norfolk and Wolsey, but this solved nothing. Kildare's detention in England alleviated the feud with Ossory, but successive administrative initiatives merely showed that good rule could not be maintained in his absence without subventions from England. Meanwhile Kildare exploited his connections with Norfolk, the Boleyns, and the Greys to recover Henry's favour. His signature on the English nobles' appeal to the pope in 1530 also suggests a willingness to accommodate the king on this acid test of loyalty. Holbein's portrait of him, painted in spring 1530, shows a consummate Tudor courtier, looking rather younger than his forty-three years.<br>
<br>With Norfolk's continued coaxing, Henry finally agreed in August 1530 to Kildare's return home with Sir William Skeffington, now promoted deputy, and 250 troops. Skeffington was charged with reconciling outstanding differences between the earls of Desmond, Kildare, and Ossory, and instructed to convene a parliament and secure a subsidy so as to reduce the king's expenses. Kildare meanwhile undertook to compel the border chiefs to make peace. Initially the experiment worked well and, campaigning jointly and separately, Skeffington and Kildare soon restored order. Yet by July 1531 Skeffington and Kildare had fallen out and the Geraldine&#150;Butler feud had recommenced. When the Irish parliament met in September&#150;October 1531 the subsidy bill was thrown out, and with the deputy already reduced to 100 troops to save money and Kildare mobilizing support in the Irish council and from Norfolk and the Boleyns, Skeffington's recall was only a matter of time.<h2>
<a name="Reappointedasdeputy"></a>Reappointed as deputy</h2>In spring 1532 Kildare was summoned to England together with Ossory's son, Lord Butler, and leading officials who deposed before the council that the earl had done good service until recently, when provoked by Skeffington's favour for Ossory. When Butler likewise asserted that Skeffington was largely responsible for resurrecting the Kildare&#150;Ossory feud, the king concluded that the lordship could be governed more efficiently and cheaply by reappointing Kildare and balancing this by appointing Butler as treasurer. Kildare took up office in August and characteristically settled scores against Skeffington, &#145;where of great myscheff came&#146;  (TCD, MS 543/2), and other officials, notably Archbishop Alen and his namesake John Alen, who had been dismissed. Skeffington was humiliated publicly during a muster of his troops before their departure, and further inquiries pursued by the earl implicated his opponents in embezzlement. Thus by late 1532 the king was back where he had started, with no real alternative to a wilful deputy who had recommenced attacks on the Butlers and others who challenged his revived authority. While besieging Birr Castle on behalf of his son-in-law <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66269/', "Ferganainm O'Carroll")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66268/', "O'Carroll, Mulroney")</script>] in mid-December, however, Kildare was &#145;shot into the bodye with a hand gone and ney slayne, but he was neuer holl againe, the mor pittie&#146;  (TCD, MS 543/2), partially losing the use of his limbs and speech. The earl was forced thereafter to rely more on his kinsmen for military exploits and several embarrassing reverses followed, notably a raid by the O'Byrnes to release prisoners from Dublin Castle.<br>
<br>By mid-1533 Thomas Cromwell was accumulating reports and complaints against Kildare, and appointments of the earl's critics to key offices in the Dublin administration suggested that he was losing the king's favour. Yet his procurement of a subsidy in June when he convened parliament suggests that the deputy still had considerable influence in the lordship, and at court he was supported by Norfolk and Wiltshire. In September 1533 he was again summoned to court, along with other officials, and the Irish council recommended the appointment of an experienced English-born governor. Kildare's response was to send his wife with excuses, alleging illness from his old gunshot wound, and he also ignored the king's command not to transfer ordnance from Dublin Castle to his own strongholds. Henry insisted on Kildare's appearance, however, but sent a commission empowering the earl to appoint a deputy during his absence. In February 1534 Kildare held a final council meeting at Drogheda, at which he deputed his heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9586/', "Thomas Fitzgerald, Lord Offaly")</script>, as his deputy, with secret instructions to take advice only from his senior officers and those councillors he felt he could trust.<h2>
<a name="Insurrectionanddeath"></a>Insurrection and death</h2>Kildare was examined in council on arrival at court, and by May 1534 &#145;manyfold enormyties&#146; had been proven against him; but he was evidently so ill and &#145;not like to live long&#146; that the main priority was to dispatch a new governor to prevent a recurrence of the earlier disorders fomented by his kinsmen. Accordingly, Henry now sent Offaly instructions to summon a council at which the king's further pleasure would be declared; but the earl forestalled the king's plans by dispatching a messenger who delivered his son &#145;a littill hart of sylver and gilte, and a paire of blak dise&#146; with instructions &#145;that he shulde not trust to the kinges counsaill ther. For if he did, he shulde be brought perforce into Englonde and ther sholde lose his liff, and that he shulde kepe hym out of the waye asmoche as he might&#146;  (LPL, MS 602, fols. 138<i>v</i>&#150;139<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>That Kildare intended the full-scale insurrection which his son later unleashed cannot be ruled out, but it is perhaps unlikely. He clearly intended to create difficulties for his successor along the lines of events in 1527&#150;9, and the overwhelming support which his son received from the earl's connection at the start of the revolt also disproves suggestions of a gradual erosion of Kildare power. Perhaps he hoped that the crisis over the royal divorce and breach with Rome might yet cause the king to back down, but he must have been aware too of the sudden arrest of another ruling magnate and Norfolk client, Lord Dacre, charged like himself with treason. Following Offaly's defiance, Kildare was arrested on 29 June 1534 and sent to the Tower. Two months later he rallied briefly from his illness, prompting rumours that he might be sent home to persuade his son to submit, but with his countess in constant attendance the old earl died in the Tower on 2 September, amid fairly general expressions of regret at court. He was buried in the church of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower, and in May 1536 was posthumously attainted of treason by the Irish parliament. His heir and five brothers were all executed at Tyburn in February 1537, but he was survived by his four daughters by his first marriage and by two sons and two daughters of his second marriage, of whom the elder son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9557/', "Gerald Fitzgerald (1525&#150;1585)")</script>, was in 1554 restored as eleventh earl of Kildare.<h2>
<a name="Characterandsignificance"></a>Character and significance</h2>The religious opinions of the ninth earl of Kildare are difficult to pin down. He was reputed to have been very devout, a view supported by his evidently close ties with both regular and secular clergy in Kildare, and by the lavish scale of his endowment of Maynooth College. His own library boasted numerous religious works in Latin, English, French, and Gaelic. But Kildare's precise opinions on the Reformation and the royal supremacy over the church are far less clear. Maynooth was a conventional late medieval chantry endowment, for instance, and yet his library books suggest a strong interest in English humanism and even in the controversies of the early Reformation.<br>
<br>Traditional accounts of Kildare described a partly Anglicized magnate whose inability to match the achievements of his famous father in extending the Kildare patrimony and preserving home rule reflected defects of character. Yet such accounts exhibited scant appreciation either of Kildare's status as an English subject in a centralizing Tudor state or of the new demands created by the different personality and priorities of the second Tudor king. More recent assessments of the earl, while differing in emphasis, have been more appreciative of these difficulties. The earl's strength was his ability to play the role both of an English courtier and of a Gaelic <i>uir-r&iacute;ogh</i> (provincial chief), as circumstances dictated. His weakness was his wilfulness and his arrogance in believing that Henry VIII would continue to recognize a prior Kildare claim on the deputyship. Yet in these failings he was not unlike other marcher lords such as Dacre or Percy, who also lost control of provincial offices they saw as rightfully theirs. &#145;Valiant and well spoken, [he] was nothing inferior to his father in martiall prowesse &hellip; bringing in awe all the Irish of the land&#146;  (<span class="italic">Holinshed's Chronicles</span>, 278).<br>
