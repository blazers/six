<span class="headword">White,  Florence Louisa</span>  (1863&#150;1940), <span class="occ">writer on cookery</span>, was born on 20 June 1863 at York Terrace, Peckham, London, the fifth and youngest child of Richard White, a lace buyer for a firm in the City of London, and his second wife, Harriet Jane Thirkell (<i>d</i>. 1869). Richard White came originally from the seaside hamlet of Worthing, Sussex, where his maternal grandfather, and later his father, had been innkeepers in the 1790s and 1830s. Florence remembered, from the 1860s, a regular Sunday dinner of beef spit-roasted in front of the kitchen fire, with the gravy absorbed by a Sussex &#145;bolster&#146; suet pudding. The Thirkells came from near Cranbrook in the weald of Kent.<br>
<br>In her autobiography, <span class="italic">A Fire in the Kitchen</span> (1938), Florence recorded how her happy early childhood ended abruptly with her mother's death when she was six. A few months later Florence lost the sight of one eye in an accident with a spinning-top. This resulted in temporary blindness followed by a lifetime's frail health, with persistent neuralgic headaches and a chronically weak heart. Although she hoped during much of her girlhood to go to Girton College, Cambridge, she was removed from school in 1878, when her father's business suffered in the depression. Her job was to shop economically for food (since the family was by then poor), to wait on her uncongenial stepmother, and to teach the three small children of her father's third marriage. During the next two years, Florence and her elder sister expanded this teaching arrangement into a small, fee-paying school. At eighteen, however, she was sent to Fareham, Hampshire, to nurse her father's two elderly sisters, formerly proprietors of the Lion Hotel and Assembly Rooms. From them, as she later described in her autobiography, she learned that &#145;good epicurean country-house cookery which had been handed down the family from mother to daughter since the days of Queen Elizabeth&#146;  (White, <span class="italic">Fire</span>, 338). Her return to Fareham towards the end of her life, when she opened a cookery school there, was directly inspired by her memories of learning traditional English cooking techniques, an accomplishment of which she never ceased to be proud.<br>
<br>Between 1884 and 1922, Florence reckoned, she held twenty-eight different types of job, including &#145;high-school mistress, governess in a private family, journalist, waitress, shopkeeper &hellip; matron, club organizer, settlement worker, visiting companion to a professor, newspaper reporter, fashion editor, sculptor's model, [domestic servants'] registry-office keeper, and matron of a governess's home&#146;  (White, <span class="italic">Fire</span>, 258). She was invariably short of money and ready to undertake almost any new job, although by the age of thirty she found herself too frail to continue either as a schoolteacher or as a governess. Her first book, <span class="italic">Easy Dressmaking</span>, which she persuaded the Singer Sewing Machine Company to publish in 1891, sold 110,000 copies in eight years. Several decades passed, however, before she brought out her next book, <span class="italic">Good Things in England</span> (1932), a collection of traditional, regional recipes which represented her most abiding, lifelong interest, and its successor <span class="italic">Flowers as Food</span> (1934).<br>
<br>By the outbreak of the First World War, Florence had been employed in women's journalism in London and Edinburgh; social work in Hoxton; teaching English to private pupils in Paris; running a Girls' Friendly Society lodge in the Scottish countryside; and, in 1899, accompanying two children to India and Burma, where her elder brother had made his career. Despite an independent, almost liberated, lifestyle, she was most fulfilled (she later declared) when &#145;mothering&#146; somebody, and felt confirmed in her increasingly spiritualized belief that woman's natural place was at the kitchen stove when she entered domestic service in her early fifties. During and after the First World War she looked after a succession of Roman Catholic priests, and in 1921&#150;2 she was cook&#150;housekeeper in a women students' hall of residence in Kensington.<br>
<br>Only in her sixties, living in frugal semi-retirement in a Chelsea basement room, supported by freelance journalism and help from her family, did Florence begin research into the history of her lifelong passion, good, traditional English food. In 1928 she founded the English Folk Cookery Association, and in 1932, as well as producing <span class="italic">Good Things in England</span>, she edited the first of the association's <span class="italic">Good Food Registers</span>, which contained information, mainly passed on by contributors who had responded to her advertisements in the press, about towns, villages, hotels, restaurants, or even humble guest houses in which good English cooking or foodstuffs could be found.<br>
<br>Although sketchy by the standard of later cookery writing, these works have a certain pioneering charm, intensified by Florence's determination to rescue true English cooking from the fashionable trend towards everything French. Further editions appeared in 1935 and 1936, the latter entitled <span class="italic">Where Shall We Eat or Put Up?</span> In a note in this, entitled &#145;What is real English cookery?&#146;, Florence wrote evocatively of<blockquote>a roast pheasant with Celery Sauce and English Salad Sauce; a boiled pheasant with celery sauce. The correct way of making a Lancashire Hot Pot with oysters and serving it with home-made pickled red cabbage. The stuffing of grouse with red whortleberries. The jugging of hare and serving with redcurrant jelly. The making and frying of sausages. The frying of fish, in which our girls and women who live on the coast excel. (White, <span class="italic">Where Shall We Eat</span>, 173)</blockquote>In 1936, at Fareham, Florence opened her domestic training school or House of Studies, which was intended to be a place where women of all ages and social classes could mingle. English cooking, she announced triumphantly in her autobiography in 1938, was now fashionable and popular, and no longer to be despised as dull or unimaginative. By that time, however, she was almost blind and crippled by various illnesses. She died at 52 Wickham Road, Fareham, Hampshire, on 12 March 1940.<br>
