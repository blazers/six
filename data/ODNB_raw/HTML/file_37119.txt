<span class="headword">Anthony,  (Henry) Mark</span>  (1817&#150;1886), <span class="occ">landscape painter</span>, was born on 4 August 1817 at Rusholme Lane, Manchester, of Welsh ancestry, the second son of John Anthony, merchant, and his wife, Phoebe. His elder brother, John Anthony (1813&#150;1895), was a physician in Birmingham, traveller, and distinguished microscopist. They moved to Cowbridge, Glamorgan, about 1823, and there Anthony was apprenticed to a doctor and amateur artist called Harrison. Subsequently he is reported to have been a pupil of his cousin George Wilfred Anthony, a drawing-master in Manchester, later a landscape painter and art critic (as Gabriel Tinto) for the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. He moved to London about 1833. Patronage, and a legacy some time in the 1830s, enabled him to travel; he studied at The Hague, in Paris at the Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts with Paul Delaroche, Ary Scheffer, and Horace Vernet, and in Fontainebleau in 1837, where he was influenced by the Barbizon school, J. B. C. Corot, and Jules Dupr&eacute;.<br>
<br>Anthony was among the first to introduce the French style of <i>plein-air</i> landscape painting of the 1830s to London. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy between 1837 and 1884, showing a total of thirty-six pictures. He also exhibited seven paintings at the British Institution (1841&#150;60) and eighty-four (1841&#150;69) at the Society of British Artists, of which he was elected a member in 1845, resigning in 1852 in the hope that this would assist his election to associateship of the Royal Academy. He exhibited once at the Grosvenor Gallery and the Liverpool Academy, winning the 1854 prize of &pound;50 for <span class="italic">Nature's Mirror</span>. He travelled in England, Wales, France, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Spain.<br>
<br>Working directly from nature, Anthony was admired by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (attending their &#145;house-warming&#146; at Newman Street, London, on 12 January 1850); he was a great friend of Ford Madox Brown, mentioned frequently in Brown's diaries; and D. G. Rossetti secured him the patronage of the important Newcastle collector James Leathart in the 1860s. New developments in British art after 1860, and his failure to be elected to the Royal Academy, led to a solitary later career. His works fetched high prices at auction during his lifetime, and were particularly admired for their detail, atmospheric effects, and melancholic mood, often enhanced by the light of dawn or early evening over an old church or castle.<br>
<br>Anthony married at Surbiton on 18 April 1846 Eleanor Sophia Marshall (1808/9&#150;1891) and had three daughters, born between 1849 and 1853. His wife left him in 1855, and in December 1859 her petition for a judicial separation was heard, revealing details of their domestic disputes. She lived in lodgings, while he settled at The Lawn, Hampstead, London, where he died on 1 December 1886.<br>
