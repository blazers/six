<span class="headword">Wilson, Sir  Frederick William</span>  (1844&#150;1924), <span class="occ">journalist and politician</span>, was born on 20 March 1844 at the Manor House, Scarning, Norfolk, the second of the three sons of William Wilson (1810&#150;1885), Liberal tenant farmer and newspaper founder&#150;director, and his wife, Eliza (1809&#150;1893). He was educated at East Dereham and Wymondham, and served his indenture as journalist on the <span class="italic">Norfolk News</span>&#151;his father's newspaper&#151;under J. H. Tillet MP, about 1863, when he became acquainted with J. E. Taylor. Desiring experience on a daily newspaper, he became a reporter on the <span class="italic">Liverpool Daily Post</span> under M. J. Whitty, describing battles of the American Civil War and winning the esteem of Edward Russell. As editor of the <span class="italic">Chester &amp; Birkenhead Observer</span> he reported Fenian activities, and, having joined the volunteer force, was called to defend Chester Castle against a projected Fenian attack. In 1870 he married Mary Elizabeth (1847&#150;1925), daughter of Edward Capps; they had no children.<br>
<br>In 1874, for J. J. Colman and T. R. Elkington, at Ipswich, Wilson became founding editor of the <span class="italic">East Anglian Daily Times</span>, with which he was associated for the rest of his life. Here he played a key role in the popular scientific movement, publishing J. E. Taylor's lectures and giving public demonstrations of stereotype, linotype, and autotype processes before introducing them as plant. Early under his editorship James Sykes and Spencer Leigh Hughes spent formative years, as did R. C. Annand, later inventor of the Simplex rotary machines. Freddie Wilson, as he was known, encouraged initiative, enterprise, and sporting instincts at every level of his staff, holding frequent events days at his Felixstowe home. An exceptionally keen all-round sportsman, taking part in golf, lawn tennis, rowing, and cricket, he was closely connected with many early sporting clubs in East Anglia. He encouraged rifle shooting and the creation of ranges, and followed hounds enthusiastically. He stood unsuccessfully as Liberal candidate for Mid Norfolk in 1893, but was elected in 1895 and returned again in 1900, often taking an independent, even radical, stand over matters that interested him, especially in relation to agriculture and rural economy. As a founder of the Norfolk Smallholdings Association he also conducted practical experiments in the sale and lease of land for smallholdings.<br>
<br>Wilson was president of the Newspaper Society of the United Kingdom in 1895, and his contacts with leading Liberals drew him into various projects for cheap newspapers, including <span class="italic">The Star</span> and the <span class="italic">Morning Leader</span>. Elected president of the Institute of Journalists in 1907, he led a large party of journalists on an excursion to Germany, where his interview with the Kaiser appeared to cement Anglo-German relations. He was knighted later in the same year. He became deputy lieutenant of the Norfolk Territorial Association and chairman of the recruiting committee for that organization in Suffolk. For Suffolk he was commissioner of Boy Scouts until 1914 and organizer of the corps of Guides in 1913. A justice of the peace for Suffolk, he was a member of the appeal tribunal for east Suffolk during the First World War. After 1920 he lived in retirement at The Dale, Scarning, Norfolk, where he died on 26 May 1924; he was buried in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul in Scarning.<br>
