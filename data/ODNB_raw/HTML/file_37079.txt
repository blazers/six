<span class="headword">Young,  Sydney</span>  (1857&#150;1937), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born at Farnworth, Lancashire, on 29 December 1857, the third and youngest son of Edward Young JP, a Liverpool merchant, and his first wife, Anne Eliza Gunnery. He was educated at Southport (privately) and at the Royal Institution, Liverpool. At Owens College, Manchester, he studied chemistry under Sir Henry Roscoe and Carl Schorlemmer, matriculating at London University in 1877 and graduating as an external student in 1880. Young then worked under Fittig at Strasbourg and obtained the London DSc in 1883. In those days he was a good swimmer and skater, did some climbing, and painted in watercolours.<br>
<br>In 1882 Young was appointed lecturer in chemistry under William Ramsay at University College, Bristol. He had already published some work, but he now joined Ramsay in a most fruitful partnership which lasted until 1887, when Ramsay was appointed to the chair of chemistry at University College, London, and Young succeeded him at Bristol. Their researches involved accurate measurements of the vapour pressures of solids and liquids at various temperatures, and the examination of the relevant thermodynamic equations. They published more than thirty papers arising from the work of these five years. Many of these are classics of accurate physico-chemical investigation.<br>
<br>From 1887 to 1904 Young, with a succession of collaborators, carried out many studies of the physical properties of pure liquids and of the behaviour of mixed liquids when distilled. Initially the emphasis was on the determination of the vapour pressures, specific volumes, and critical constants of a series of pure liquids, with the particular aim of testing the generalizations of van der Waals regarding corresponding temperatures, pressures, and volumes. Later there was interest in the relationship between physical properties and molecular structure in homologous series and with different functional groups. Young devoted particular attention to the paraffin hydrocarbons; the problems of obtaining pure samples of these led to his investigations of distillation and to the construction of improved forms of the necessary apparatus. With such apparatus he was able to separate pure samples of some of the constituents of American petroleum.<br>
<br>In 1893 Young was elected FRS: his youngest half-brother, the Revd Alfred Young, was elected in 1934 as a mathematician. In 1896 Young married Grace Martha, daughter of James Kimmins, of Stonehouse, Gloucestershire. They had twin sons born in 1897: Sydney Vernon was killed in action at Ypres in 1915; Charles Edgar survived the war and ultimately became headmaster of Rossall School. In 1904 Young succeeded J. E. Reynolds in the chair of chemistry at Trinity College, Dublin. This appointment involved a large increase in his administrative and teaching duties, so that his output of original work was greatly reduced, but from time to time he published articles and books. His <span class="italic">Fractional Distillation</span> had already appeared in 1903, and <span class="italic">Stoichiometry</span> followed in 1908, with a second edition in 1918. In 1922 came <span class="italic">Distillation, Principles and Processes</span>, which was written in collaboration with various experts, and included chapters on the distillation of petroleum, coal tar, alcohol, and so on. Young also wrote for the revised edition (1921&#150;7) of <span class="italic">Thorpe's Dictionary of Applied Chemistry</span> the articles on &#145;Distillation&#146;, &#145;Sublimation&#146;, and &#145;Thermometers&#146;. His publications extended from 1880 to 1928.<br>
<br>In 1904 Young was president of the chemical section of the British Association's meeting at Cambridge. He received the honorary degree of ScD from Trinity College, Dublin, in 1905 and that of DSc from Bristol University in 1921. He was a founder fellow of the Institute of Physics, and became a fellow of the Institute of Chemistry in 1888. He was vice-president of the Chemical Society from 1917 to 1920, and a member of the advisory council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research from 1920 to 1925. From 1921 to 1926 he was president of the Royal Irish Academy. In 1928 he resigned from his chair and retired to live outside Bristol. After a very brief illness Young died at the Chesterfield Nursing Home, Bristol, on 8 April 1937. His wife survived him.<br>
