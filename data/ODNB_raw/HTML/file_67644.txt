<span class="headword">Redlich,  Hans Ferdinand</span>  (1903&#150;1968), <span class="occ">musicologist</span>, was born on 11 February 1903 in Vienna, the only son of Professor Joseph Redlich and his wife, Alix Leo Simon. He was educated at the Schotten Gymnasium in Vienna, and after studying the piano with Paul Weingarten, theory with Hugo Kauder, and composition with Carl Orff he entered the University of Vienna in 1921. He also studied in Munich. He pursued a career as an opera conductor in the 1920s, as assistant conductor at the Charlottenburg opera house in Berlin from 1924 to 1925 and as conductor at the Stadttheater in Mainz from 1925 to 1929. In 1930 he married Elise Gerlach (<i>d</i>. 1959). It may have been the influence of Carl Orff, who was working on Monteverdi in Munich in the 1920s and who produced realizations of several scores, including a new realization of <span class="italic">Orfeo</span> in 1923, that led Redlich to write a thesis on the madrigals of Monteverdi for his doctorate at the University of Frankfurt am Main, awarded in 1931. This was published in book form in 1932.<br>
<br>Redlich moved to England in 1939 and took British nationality in 1947. He was involved in the Morley College concerts during and after the war, and in 1948 the college choir and orchestra gave the first London performance of Monteverdi's <span class="italic">The Coronation of Poppea</span>, a concert performance using the score prepared by Redlich, who played the harpsichord accompaniment. From 1942 to 1955 he was a very popular extramural lecturer for the universities of Cambridge and Birmingham, before his appointment in 1955 as lecturer in the history of music at the University of Edinburgh. In 1962 he moved to the chair of music at the University of Manchester.<br>
<br>Redlich wrote in German and in English on Monteverdi, including <span class="italic">Monteverdi: Leben und Werk</span> (1949), translated into English in 1952, a work that played an important part in the revival of interest in the composer, and he published an edition of the Monteverdi <span class="italic">Vespers</span> in Vienna in 1949. He also wrote about late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Austrian music: his books included <span class="italic">Bruckner and Mahler</span> (1955) and <span class="italic">Alban Berg: the Man and his Music</span> (1957). He wrote about Wagner's operas, with books on <span class="italic">Tristan and Isolde</span> (1945), <span class="italic">Lohengrin</span> (1949), and <span class="italic">Parsifal</span> (1951). He produced editions of Handel's early works composed in Halle and his twelve concerti grossi, op. 6; his editions of the &#145;Water Music&#146; and &#145;Music for the Royal Fireworks&#146;, published in 1962, gave English audiences their first opportunity to hear these as originally scored rather than the modern arrangements, as orchestral suites, by Hamilton Harty. He was engaged on a new critical edition of Handel when he died. He was also general editor of the Eulenburg miniature scores, and in 1968 contributed the chapter on early baroque church music to volume 4 of the <span class="italic">New Oxford History of Music</span>. In his Percival lecture, &#145;The meaning and the aims of musicology&#146;, to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1963, he made a plea for greater importance to be attached to the study of the history of music in British universities.<br>
<br>Redlich married again in 1961; his second wife was Erika Burger. In 1967 he was awarded an honorary DMus by the University of Edinburgh. He died on 27 November 1968 at his home, 1 Morville Road, Manchester, and was cremated in Manchester two days later.<br>
