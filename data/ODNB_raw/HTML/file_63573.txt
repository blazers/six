<span class="headword">Shrubb,  Alfred</span>  (1879&#150;1964), <span class="occ">athlete</span>, was born at Battle's, Slinfold, near Horsham, Sussex, on 12 December 1879, the son of William Shrubb, an agricultural labourer, and his wife, Harriett, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dench. He had three elder brothers and three elder sisters. The family settled in Horsham, where his father worked in the building trade and where after leaving school he became apprenticed to a carpenter. His first indication of athletic talent came in 1899, when he ran 3 miles across country to help fight a fire in a neighbouring village. Shortly afterwards he joined the local athletic club, Horsham Blue Star Harriers, and at Easter 1900, at Bexhill, won the Sussex championships for 1, 3, and 4 miles. Later in 1900, having competed in his first national Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) championships and still employed as a carpenter's labourer in Horsham, he joined the South London Harriers. This affiliation brought him coaching by the professional trainer Harry Andrews. Between 1901 and 1904 Shrubb won ten AAA championships at distances between 1 and 10 miles. As well as southern and national cross-country titles, he won the first two international cross-country championships in 1903 and 1904. By 1904 it was obvious that he was the outstanding distance runner of his generation; in one race, on 5 November 1904 in Glasgow, he set world records at every distance from 2 to 10 miles. When the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) produced its first list of official world records in 1921, Shrubb held the records for all distances between 2 and 10 miles; no subsequent British athlete was to break a record for a distance event until Gordon Pirie in 1953.<br>
<br>In 1902 Shrubb opened a tobacconist shop in Horsham, but it was clear that this income could not be sufficient to fund his expenses as an athlete training and competing across the country. There were rumours that Shrubb would request a piano as a prize at races, which would later be sold by a relation who owned a piano shop. Travelling expenses to athletes were forbidden unless competing in inter-club or AAA championship meetings. In December 1904 the AAA agreed to a request from the New Zealand AAA for Shrubb to make an expenses-paid tour. In the following year the AAA rules on payment of amateur expenses were further tightened and a similar request from the South African AAA was refused. In August 1905 Shrubb was suspended by the AAA for &#145;irregularities&#146; surrounding the purchase of a ticket to travel to Canada; the AAA southern committee had refused permission for him to make a tour, but he had continued negotiations. Shrubb appealed in January 1906, but his suspension was upheld, and the South London Harriers club was also suspended. The athletic press dubbed the scandal the &#145;Shrubb sensation&#146;, and it coincided with wider debates in the sporting world about who should be considered an &#145;amateur&#146;. The National Cycling Union was openly challenging the AAA definition of amateurism and promoting athletic meetings under its own code, which allowed amateurs and professionals to compete against each other. Shrubb made his professional d&eacute;but at a Southern Counties Cycling Union meeting on Good Friday 1906, but despite this high-profile support the new style of meetings failed to win popular support.<br>
<br>Shrubb made his first appearance as a professional at London's Olympia on 22 January 1906, shortly after his AAA suspension. On 1 February 1906 he married Ada (<i></i>d. 1946), daughter of John Brown, publican; they had a son and two daughters. He was never as dominant in his professional career as he had been as an amateur, and his best times were set as an amateur. In May 1907 he went to North America, where he competed as a touring professional, returning to England early in 1908. In June 1908 he set out again for the USA, where he competed widely, including racing against Johnny Hayes and Dorando Pietri, stars of the 1908 Olympic marathon, who had also turned professional. He wrote <span class="italic">Running and Cross-Country Running</span> (1908), in which he described himself as the &#145;world's greatest pedestrian&#146; and urged athletes to &#145;train consistently and constantly, and always to bear in mind that they could always do better&#146;. In January 1909 he competed in an indoor marathon at Madison Square Garden against Tom Longboat, but broke down after twenty-four miles. Later in 1909 he settled in Toronto, joined by his wife, and became manager of a cereal mill at Bowmanville. He also occasionally coached athletics at Harvard.<br>
<br>Known in his prime as the Little Wonder and the Irrepressible, Shrubb continued to compete into his forties. He returned to Britain and was the professional coach to Oxford University athletics club between 1920 and 1926, before emigrating to Canada in 1928. He ran a tourist park at Bowmanville and became co-proprietor of the cereal mill. He visited Britain in 1952, when he met his fellow South London Harrier and successor as a world record holder, Gordon Pirie, and was reinstated as an amateur by the AAA. He died in Bowmanville, Ontario, on 23 April 1964 and was buried at Bowmanville.<br>
