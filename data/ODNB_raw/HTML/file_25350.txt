<span class="headword">Sheppey,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1300&#150;1360), <span class="occ">bishop of Rochester</span>, presumably took his name from the Isle of Sheppey off the northern coast of Kent. Nothing is known of his family, except that he was survived by a sister, Alice, and her son, Peter, and may have been related to another John Sheppey, sub-sacrist at Rochester Priory. He was educated as a Benedictine at Rochester under the patronage of Bishop Hamo Hethe (<i>d</i>. 1352), and ordained deacon on 17 June 1318. He studied at Oxford and Hethe gave him permission to incept in theology in June 1332. On 12 August 1333 he was elected prior of Rochester. He was an able financial administrator, and enforced monastic observances said to have lapsed through negligence. Relations with Hethe were cordial, apart from a squabble during a visitation when Sheppey sided with a monk, John Hwytefelde, who, in a sermon, challenged Hethe's authority over the monks who had elected him. Sheppey's public duties drew him to the attention of government. In 1345 he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Castile to arrange Princess Joan's marriage, and he took this opportunity to visit the papal court at Avignon. He was a member of the king's council from 1345, and was one of the diplomats sent to Calais in 1349 to arrange a truce.<br>
<br>Following Hethe's resignation Sheppey was provided to the see of Rochester by papal letter dated 22 November 1352, and was consecrated in St Mary Overie, Southwark, by William Edington, bishop of Winchester (<i>d</i>. 1366), on 10 March 1353. His episcopal register survives only fragmentarily, but, as he himself declared in a sermon, he was vigorous in prosecuting the unchaste in his diocese. Secular duties multiplied, and from 28 November 1356 until his death he acted as treasurer of England. He died on 19 October 1360 at his manor of La Place, Lambeth, and was buried in Rochester Cathedral at the altar of St John the Baptist, where he had founded a chantry. His elaborately painted effigy still survives in the presbytery, where it was discovered walled up in 1825. His will was drawn up less than a month before his death; his legatees included his sister and nephew, the prior and convent of Rochester, William Whittlesey (<i>d</i>. 1374), who succeeded him as bishop, colleagues in the royal service, and his friend Edington, to whom he left a memorial ring.<br>
<br>Sheppey is best known as a preacher. His sermons&#151;among the few fourteenth-century episcopal sermons extant&#151;survive in his autograph collection in Oxford, New College, MS 92. The majority are dated between 1336 and 1354, and were preached principally in Rochester, though they include two preached at Paul's Cross, London; most of them are occasional sermons. Although they are recorded in Latin, Sheppey's own testimony, and the presence of many vernacular phrases, show that most were intended for English delivery. He also collected other sermons and theological material useful for preaching, which survive in Oxford, Merton College, MS 248, including what may be his own abridgement of the <span class="italic">Fabulae</span> of Odo of Cheriton (<i>d</i>. 1247). Three more books owned by him survive, principally of theology, but with some works of Aristotle.<br>
