<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clarke, Sir  Fred</span>  (1880&#150;1952), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 2 August 1880 at High Coggs, near Witney, Oxfordshire, the third son of the nine children of William Clarke and Annie Clarke (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Figg), a dressmaker. William Clarke worked in a variety of occupations connected with farming, and he also promoted social and educational reforms, for example as the founder of the Weston-on-the-Green Friendly Society in 1875. Fred Clarke was educated at St Ebbe's Boys' School, an Anglican elementary school in Oxford, where he served as a pupil teacher from 1894 to 1898 and as an uncertificated teacher in 1899. Between 1894 and 1899 he also attended classes at the Oxford Central Municipal Technical School. In 1899, having secured a first class in the queen's scholarship examination, he entered the Oxford University Day Training College as a non-collegiate student. In 1903 he graduated with a first-class honours degree in history and a first-class teacher's certificate.<br>
<br>After a few weeks of teaching in a higher grade school in north London, in September 1903 Clarke was appointed senior master of method at the York Diocesan Training College. In March 1906 he became professor of education at Hartley University College, Southampton, and in the following year, on 25 August 1907, he married Edith Annie Gillams, a former fellow student at the municipal technical school. He threw himself into the work at Southampton, both within the college and outside. He wrote <span class="italic">A School History of Hampshire</span> (1909) and collaborated with F. J. C. Hearnshaw in editing and writing the two-volume <span class="italic">Short History of Southampton</span> (1910).<br>
<br>Hartley College's financial and administrative problems, however, were considerable, and in March 1911 Clarke arrived in Cape Town to take up the post of foundation professor of education at the South African College. (In 1918 this became the University of Cape Town with Clarke as dean of the faculty of education.) He began with nine students; by 1929 there were nearly 200. Clarke learned Afrikaans and soon became a national figure in South Africa. His inaugural lecture, in 1911, was entitled &#145;National ideas in education&#146;, and for the next eighteen years he campaigned, albeit unsuccessfully, for a national educational policy. He deplored the neglect of educational provision for the black majority population. He also argued forcibly against a system which placed formal schooling under provincial control while vocational (in common with higher) education was reserved to the union. Clarke had a lifelong commitment to the promotion of school curricula and general culture which valued both liberal and vocational education. He was president of the Cape Teachers' Association in 1915 and of the South African Teachers' Association in 1920. He also played a leading role in the establishment of juvenile affairs boards, chairing the national conference of 1915 and the national printing apprenticeship committee established under the <span class="roman">Apprenticeship Act</span> of 1922. His advocacy of secondary education for all predated the publication of R. H. Tawney's volume of 1922, and was conceived of in a more generous spirit. Clarke's <span class="italic">Foundations of History-Teaching</span> was published in 1929.<br>
<br>One of the key works from Clarke's South African period was a collection entitled <span class="italic">Essays in the Politics of Education</span> (1923). In the first essay, entitled &#145;The need for a philosophy&#146;, Clarke criticized excessive individualism as expressed in competitive economics and <i>laissez-faire</i>, and in educational terms in Percy Nunn's <span class="italic">Education: its Data and First Principles</span> (1920). In contrast, Clarke argued for synthesis and unity, aligning himself with such educationists as Dewey and Kerschensteiner in their belief that school and industry needed to be brought together into one educative system. For Clarke, however, the purpose of education was unequivocally expressed in Christian terms. It was: &#145;To know God and to enjoy him for ever&#146;  (<span class="italic">Essays in the Politics of Education</span>, 2).<br>
<br>Clarke maintained contacts with England and spent several vacations there. His long association with the Round Table movement, which sought to employ cultural, educational, and other ties to promote the unity of the British empire, led to a close friendship with John Dove. His international activities included leadership of the South African delegations to the Geneva international labour conference in 1925, and to the London Imperial Education Conference of 1927. In 1929 he was appointed one of the three members of the commission on education in Southern Rhodesia.<br>
<br>By 1929, however, Clarke had become increasingly disillusioned by the policies of the premier, J. B. M. Hertzog, and the Nationalist Party. Attempts to secure a post in England were unsuccessful, and he accepted the chair of education at McGill University in Montreal. In 1930 he visited New York and spent time with staff and friends from the Carnegie Corporation and Teachers' College. In the following year, in a speech to the centenary meeting of the British Association, he outlined his vision of a central institute for the study of education throughout the British empire. In 1932 the London Day Training College became the University of London Institute of Education, and the Carnegie Corporation made a grant of $67,500 to establish an oversea division within the institute and to cover its costs for three years. In 1935 Clarke took up the new post of &#145;adviser to oversea students&#146; at the institute and made a grand tour of western Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to prepare himself for his duties. In the following year, while retaining his role as adviser, he succeeded Nunn as director of the institute and assumed the title of professor of education within the university.<br>
<br>As director of the institute, Clarke wanted to develop its intellectual base by the establishment not only of a chair in comparative education but also of others in the history, philosophy, and sociology of education. His unremitting activity led to a breakdown in health in October 1937, precipitated in part by the accidental death of his friend Sir Edwin Deller while inspecting the new University of London building. Clarke returned to his duties towards the end of 1938, by which time the institute had moved into new premises in the north wing of the Senate House. In 1939 the institute was evacuated to Nottingham, where he was at the hub of a community much reduced in size by the absence on war service of many staff and students, though in 1943 it returned to temporary premises in Portman Square, London.<br>
<br>The war years, and their immediate aftermath, indeed, marked the height of Clarke's fame and influence. His influential <span class="italic">Education and Social Change</span> (1940) reiterated many of his long-cherished ideals and developed Karl Mannheim's notion of &#145;planning for freedom&#146; with specific reference to education. Clarke was a central figure in the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/67745', "Moot")</script>, a group of distinguished Christian figures, lay and clerical, who met for residential weekend discussions from 1938, and in the All Souls Group, founded in 1941 specifically to consider the shape of post-war education. He served on the McNair committee on the supply, recruitment, and training of teachers and youth leaders which reported in 1944, and strongly supported scheme A, which proposed the establishment of university schools of education. Following the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1944, he was appointed the first chairman of the Central Advisory Council for Education (England). His 1943 pamphlet, <span class="italic">The Study of Education in England</span>, called attention to the need for a body analogous to the Medical Research Council to undertake research in education. He chaired the interim committee of the National Foundation for Educational Research, 1943&#150;7, its executive committee, 1947&#150;9, and served as vice-president, 1949&#150;52. He also played a full role in Colonial Office and British Council activities, serving on the advisory committee on education in the colonies from 1937, and on the Colonial Universities Commission from 1943. He was knighted in 1943.<br>
<br>In 1945 Clarke retired from the directorship of the Institute of Education and took up a new post as adviser on educational developments and research to the National Union of Teachers. In 1948 he returned to the post of adviser to oversea students at the institute; his final book, <span class="italic">Freedom in the Educative Society</span>, with its remarkable coda on original sin, was published in the same year. He collapsed and died at his home, 33 Tavistock Square, London, on 6 January 1952, having attended morning communion at St Pancras Church earlier in the day. A memorial service was held at Christ Church, Woburn Square, London, and he was cremated at Golders Green crematorium.<br>
<br>Clarke was awarded honorary degrees by Columbia and Durham universities, but he was essentially a modest person, with a frank and open manner, an immense knowledge about education, sincere Christian principles, and a deep attachment to his wife and five daughters. He was always writing, and the bibliography of his works, which were mainly in article or review form, occupies some twenty-five pages in Frank Mitchell's biography of 1967. But above all, he was a teacher. Mitchell concludes<blockquote>that he was a terrific worker, a devoted husband and father, an outstanding citizen, a thinker, a pioneer reformer and a commentator. But of all the roles he filled, it was that of the teacher which warmed his heart and was the central core of his life's work. (Mitchell, 141)</blockquote>
