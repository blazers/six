<span class="headword">Corley, Sir  Kenneth Sholl Ferrand</span>  (1908&#150;2005), <span class="occ">industrialist</span>, was born at Rosthwaite, Westley Road, Acocks Green, Birmingham, on 3 November 1908, the son of Sydney Walter Corley, insurance inspector, and his wife, Annie Louise, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sholl. He was educated at St Bees School in Cumberland. At the age of nineteen he joined the Birmingham firm of Joseph Lucas &amp; Son Ltd, which specialized in electrical components for the automotive and aviation industries. He remained with the firm until his retirement forty-five years later.<br>
<br>On joining Lucas, Corley was sent to the firm's depot in Leyton, where he learned the technical side of the business before returning to Birmingham to learn the commercial side by being &#145;office boy&#146; to F. H. Walker, the firm's general manager and a future director. Corley first came to prominence in the firm when he was dispatched to Lowestoft in 1929 to act on behalf of the company when it acquired a major shareholding, valued at &pound;8696, in the motor accessory firm D. V. A. Rist. Lucas's holding in Rists was kept secret for thirty-four years, for most of which Corley acted as the sole link between the two establishments. His business acumen attracted the attention of Oliver Lucas, the grandson of Joseph Lucas, who by 1921 had become a director. Lucas often took the young Corley with him when conducting business negotiations, including on a trip to the United States in 1933. On 19 June 1937 Corley married, at the Methodist Church, Oaklands Gate, Northwood, Middlesex, the 24-year-old Olwen Mary Yeoman (<i>d</i>. 1999), daughter of Maurice Hart Yeoman, a principal assistant for London county council. They had a son, Peter, and a daughter, Ann.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of the Second World War several Lucas directors and managers found themselves being seconded to other electrical firms at the request of the ministries of Aircraft Production and Supply. Corley was kept on at Lucas as Walker's assistant in spite of strenuous efforts made by another director, Peter Bennett, to appoint him to his staff at the Ministry of Supply. Corley's wartime effort was therefore spent entirely in Birmingham as part of the skeleton senior management team led by Bertram Waring, who became joint managing director with Peter Bennett following the death of Oliver Lucas in 1948. In the same year Corley was elevated to the position of company director.<br>
<br>The early 1950s saw considerable organizational change at Lucas. In 1951 this entailed dividing the board of directors into two, creating a main board and an executive board, with the latter taking responsibility for running Lucas's various subsidiary companies. Corley was transferred from the main to the executive board, but quickly found himself part of a small, tight-knit coterie of managers surrounding Waring who in effect ran the organization. In 1955 Corley also took over the committee responsible for executive organization and development, and a year later was made chief administrative officer.<br>
<br>Lucas harboured plans to expand into the European market and in 1959 Corley was given responsibility for initiating a partnership with Ducellier-Bendix-Air Equipment in France. A new enterprise was formed to manufacture a full range of electrical automotive components, known as Ducellier &amp; Cie. In the same year, 1959, Lucas perceived that it would have to diversify its products following the Sandys report on the future of Britain's air defences, which had come out in favour of guided missiles at the expense of manned aircraft. It considered manufacturing electrical systems for British Rail. Corley was closely involved in this plan, but little had been achieved before British Rail announced that it preferred to remain with its tried and tested suppliers. Greater success obtained in supplying electrical equipment for the machine tool industry, though the financial benefits for the company were not as great as the potential gains that might have been garnered from more profitable railway supply contracts. Also in 1959, as part of the diversification exercise, Corley spearheaded Lucas's attempt to move into all-glass, sealed beamed light units for cars. A separate manufacturing company was proposed. British Sealed Beams Limited was registered in 1959 with Corley as chairman. Initial production was small, with Vauxhall being the first main customer, but over time orders were received from Ford and the British Motor Corporation, and heralded the success of the new subsidiary.<br>
<br>In 1965 Corley was appointed commercial director of the executive board, while at the same time being vice-chairman (commercial) for the whole group as well as chief executive of Lucas Electrical. In 1969 he was appointed chairman and combined that role with that of chief executive. During his tenure as chairman he was responsible for streamlining the groups from nineteen more or less independent firms to seven. Under pressure from the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation in the late 1960s Lucas made a number of acquisitions in the aircraft industry. Corley promoted that side of the business, including a partnership with Rolls-Royce in developing the RB211 engine. However, the increasing costs of the RB211 eventually forced Rolls-Royce into crisis, leaving Lucas with debts of &pound;20 million. On hearing of this all Corley is reputed to have said is &#145;Mmm, well, well&#146;.<br>
<br>Outside Lucas, Corley was a life governor of Birmingham University, a governor of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, chairman of the Birmingham chamber of commerce in 1964, president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in 1971, and a governor of his alma mater, St Bees (and chairman, 1978&#150;84). He was knighted in 1972 and made a chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur in 1975 for his services to the automotive industry. After his retirement he instigated and presided over the Lucas Festival of Arts. A quiet unassuming man who got on with things, he retired to Cumbria where he enjoyed bee-keeping and fell walking, even climbing Scafell Pike on his eightieth birthday, yet still finding time to be an inveterate letter writer to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> newspaper. He died of prostate cancer at his home, Bradbury House, Gosforth, Cumbria, on 6 March 2005, and was survived by his two children.<br>
