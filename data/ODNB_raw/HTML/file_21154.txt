<span class="headword">Paley,  Frederick Apthorp</span>  (1815&#150;1888), <span class="occ">classical scholar and writer</span>, was the eldest son of Edmund Paley (1782&#150;1850), rector of Easingwold, York, where he was born on 14 January 1815. He was the grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21155/', "Archdeacon William Paley")</script>, whose works his father edited, and elder brother of E. G. Paley (1823&#150;1895), who was active as an architect and builder in the north of England. His mother was Sarah, daughter of the Revd Dr Apthorp. Educated under Samuel Butler at Shrewsbury School and at St John's College, Cambridge, he graduated BA in 1838 but, owing to his dislike of mathematics, did not attempt the mathematical tripos and was therefore ineligible for the classical tripos. He was devoted to classical studies from early youth, although his interests were always wide; as a boy he was good with mechanical things and fond of natural science. He published his first book as early as 1838, a translation of G. F. Sch&ouml;mann's <span class="italic">De comitiis Atheniensium</span> (1819). He proceeded MA in 1842, and received the honorary degree of LLD from Aberdeen in 1883.<br>
<br>From 1838 to 1846 Paley was in residence at Cambridge; in addition to reading with pupils, he studied classics and ecclesiastical architecture, and published in both. He was an original member of the Cambridge Camden Society, became honorary secretary and member of committee, and contributed largely to <span class="italic">The Ecclesiologist</span> while that paper was the organ of the society. He eagerly supported the restoration of the Round Church at Cambridge. During the progress of the Oxford Movement, by which he was greatly influenced, he identified himself with the high-church party in the university. In 1846 he was suspected of having encouraged one of his pupils, John Morris, to join the Roman Catholic church, and he was ordered by the master of St John's to give up his rooms in college. The affair created a brief scandal in both local and national press, and it cost Paley any chance of conventional advance at Cambridge, then or later. Some of his letters reveal a certain bitterness, and he was caustic in print about the indolence of many who enjoyed college fellowships.<br>
<br>Paley accordingly left Cambridge, but not before he had himself converted to Catholicism. From 1847 to 1856 he was employed as private tutor in Catholic families, successively those of the Talbots (earls of Shrewsbury), Throckmortons, and Kenelm Digbys. On 31 July 1854 he married Ruth, sixth daughter of G. M. Burchell of Bramley, Surrey; they had two sons and a daughter. After a brief period at Peterborough, where he also took pupils, he returned to Cambridge University in 1860, on the partial removal of religious disability, and became a private tutor to undergraduates.<br>
<br>During the 1840s Paley began issuing an edition of Aeschylus in separate parts, with Latin notes, which, though coldly received abroad, met with success at home. Throughout his absence from Cambridge from 1846 to 1860 he studied and wrote incessantly, publishing in particular editions of Aeschylus and Euripides with English notes, Propertius and Ovid's <span class="italic">Fasti</span>, and works on architecture. His growing reputation as a scholar, as well as teacher, led to his being considered in 1854 by J. H. Newman for the chair of Greek at the new University College of Dublin; but a rival successfully thwarted the appointment. He also studied botany, geology, and zoology, publishing pamphlets and numerous articles on these and other scientific, religious, and educational matters. Among his studies were the habits of earthworms; he published on the subject both before and after the appearance of Charles Darwin's book on it (1881), which he reviewed.<br>
<br>At Cambridge from 1860 to 1874 Paley was a thorough and well regarded tutor, who never consented to teach solely for the examinations (he published opinions on reform of the classical tripos, and examined in it in 1874). Among his pupils T. Field, W. Leaf, and S. S. Lewis wrote recollections of him. In 1872 he applied unsuccessfully for the chair of Latin at Cambridge, when J. E. B. Mayor was appointed; then in 1874 his probably unique qualifications and experience led to his selection by Cardinal Manning as professor of classical literature at the new Catholic University College at Kensington, London; this was the only professional post Paley ever held. The college quickly failed, and Paley ceased to be professor in 1877. The year before, he had been briefly considered for election as fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge, expressly to complete the edition of Thucydides begun by the college's recently dead R. Shilleto; in fact Paley completed Shilleto's book ii privately, in 1880, and insisted on anonymity. While in London, he was classical examiner to the university (1875&#150;80), a prestigious appointment, and to the civil service commission.<br>
<br>Paley's first wife was killed in a carriage accident in 1870 near Peterborough and buried there. On 3 October 1871 he married his second wife, Selena Frances, youngest daughter of Revd T. Broadhurst of Bath. In 1881, owing to lifelong weakness of the chest (this, and his lean build, gave some the impression of desiccation), he removed to Bournemouth, delighting in the house he bought at Boscombe Spa and calling it Apthorp, his mother's family name. There he died on 9 December 1888 and was buried in the Catholic churchyard. His second wife survived him until 1908. She allowed his personal library to be purchased by his friend and former pupil S. S. Lewis, who presented it to Cavendish College, Cambridge; part survives still at Fitzwilliam College.<br>
<br>The range, quantity, and quality of Paley's published work were determined by various factors: he was without reliable and salaried employment for much of his life; the flow of private pupils at Cambridge lessened in the 1860s; and most of his classical articles and reviews, as well as the papers on general subjects, were written to earn money, especially in his retirement (such investments as he had in lieu of a pension were largely in land which lost value or income in the agricultural depression of the 1880s). Great changes in the educational market from the 1850s, with a new demand for classical commentaries in English, gave Paley's unquestionable talent and facility its chance; he published about thirty such commentaries, some of them going into conscientiously revised editions. Many of these were the first of their kind and became for a time standard works, for scholars as well as students, like his <span class="italic">Propertius</span> (1853; 2nd edn, 1872) and <span class="italic">Select Private Orations of Demosthenes</span> (with J. E. Sandys, 1874), and above all his <span class="italic">Aeschylus</span> (1855; 4th edn, 1879) and <span class="italic">Euripides</span> (3 vols., 1857; 2nd edn, 1872); the latter, almost 150 years later, was still the most recent complete commentary on Euripides to have been undertaken. These two works were his best, singular in their day for the breadth and approachability of their introductions; the commentaries were workmanlike and honest, founded on knowledgeable sensitivity to tragic diction which led Paley to textual conjectures, and to suspicion of interpolation, judged rather more favourably nowadays than then. Paley seldom had leisure or patience for true research, and he could not read important German scholarship at first hand. He nevertheless studied accessible manuscripts for his editions and published scholarly papers on many topics, especially in the <span class="italic">Journal of Philology</span> after its foundation in 1868. Homer was a particular interest. He wrote a commentary on the <span class="italic">Iliad</span> (1866; 2nd edn, 1884), soon superseded by that written by his Cambridge pupil W. Leaf; he early formed, and constantly re-argued, his own &#145;Homeric theory&#146;, that the discrepant mythical and linguistic phenomena of the poems were only to be explained if they had been assembled &#145;anonymously&#146; in the fifth century <span class="smallcap">BC</span> from a variety of older and newer sources. The theory won indifference or scorn in Britain, but appealed temporarily to German analysts of Homer. One pure work of scholarship stands out, his <span class="italic">Commentarius</span> on the important Medicean scholia of Aeschylus (1878; reprinted 1978). The best appreciation of his scholarship by a near contemporary was that of E. C. Marchant in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, where a very great number of his publications is listed; judgements made one century later appeared in C. Collard, <span class="roman">Liverpool Classical Papers</span>, no. 5 (1995).<br>
