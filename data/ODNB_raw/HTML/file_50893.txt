<span class="headword">Sayer,  Robert</span>  (1724/5&#150;1794), <span class="occ">print, map, and chart publisher</span>, was born in Sunderland, the youngest of three sons of James Sayer (1695&#150;1736) of Stockton, a lawyer and descendant of the Sayer family of Worsall, Yorkshire, and his wife, Thomasine Middleton.<br>
<br>Sayer's first known link with the map and print trade was the marriage, in January 1747, of his elder brother James to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64997/', "Mary Overton")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64998/', "Overton family (per. c.1665&#150;c.1765)")</script>], proprietor of the map and print business of her late husband, Philip Overton, at the sign of the Golden Buck in Fleet Street, London. Mary continued trading for a year or more after her marriage, after which Robert Sayer, then aged about twenty-four, acquired her stock and shop. Sayer became a freeman of the Stationers' Company by redemption on 6 September 1748, and the first advertisement placed by him trading on his own appeared in December that year. There is no evidence of any apprenticeship or whether he had already received early training in the trade with the Overton family, but whatever his experience it seems that he enjoyed the support of his brother and sister-in-law for several years, as until 1751 the land tax on the Fleet Street premises was charged to James Sayer.<br>
<br>Overton had built up a large collection of plates, mainly by the purchase of successful plates from their original publishers and by the use of a network of contacts for the sale of prints in the provinces and abroad. The cartographic side of the business had recently been strengthened by the purchase of plates of the publisher John Senex, who had died in 1740. Overton had also shared a number of publishing ventures with the Bowles family of St Paul's Churchyard. Sayer recognized the strengths of this pattern of business and adopted similar strategies.<br>
<br>In the 1750s London was fast becoming the centre of the European print trade, and Sayer catered for the explosion of interest in topographical views of English scenery, houses, and gardens and played a central role in the distribution and publication of design books disseminating architectural and decorative ideas to a large public. Sporting prints and books on penmanship were among other popular lines which reached provincial and colonial markets through his network of local contacts. He also sold large numbers of humorous mezzotints or &#145;drolls&#146;, though these did not reach the height of their popularity until the 1770s and 1780s.<br>
<br>In 1753 Sayer entered the county atlas market, joining John Rocque in publishing an edition of Thomas Read's <span class="italic">Small British Atlas</span>, and he then went on to join other partnerships publishing county atlases. The most important English atlas in which he had a share was the <span class="italic">Large English Atlas</span> (1760), published with Thomas Bowles, John Bowles &amp; Son, and John Tinney.<br>
<br>In 1760 Sayer and his first wife, Dorothy Carlos (<i>d</i>. 1774), whom he had married in 1754, and their young family moved to slightly larger premises a little further east at 53 Fleet Street. He was by now operating on a very large scale with his own printing presses and engravers and printers. He began to move into fine print publishing, taking a lead in publishing engravings of contemporary English paintings, including works by Edward Penny, Angelica Kaufmann, and particularly Johan Zoffany. He published Zoffany's royal portraits, had a share in his theatrical mezzotints, and owned several of the artist's works himself.<br>
<br>Sayer's financial strength enabled him to acquire important stock, plates, and drawings from Thomas Jefferys's business after the latter's bankruptcy in 1766, and he became the dominant partner with Jefferys in several cartographic publications, including <span class="italic">A General Topography of North America and the West Indies</span> (1768). He also acquired stock from John Rocque's estate after his death.<br>
<br>In 1774 Sayer took John Bennett, previously his apprentice, into partnership, and a period of increased productivity followed. An important series of American atlases was based on plates Sayer had acquired from Jefferys: <span class="italic">The West India Atlas</span> (1775), <span class="italic">The American Atlas</span> (1775), <span class="italic">The North American Pilot</span> (1775), and <span class="italic">The Western Neptune</span> (1778). These took the firm into chart publishing and were quickly followed by <span class="italic">The Channel Pilot</span> and <span class="italic">The East India Pilot</span>, and during the 1780s by charts of the northern and western coasts of Britain, the Baltic, the Mediterranean, and west Africa. Many of the charts were based on the work of other cartographers, but in contrast to much of Sayer's publishing the partners were the sole owners of all the plates from the outset. Within a decade Sayer and Bennett had become the leading British chart publisher, while maintaining its prominent position in maps and prints. The firm's new atlases included Samuel Dunn's <span class="italic">New Atlas of the Mundane System</span> (1774), Bernard Scale's <span class="italic">Hibernian Atlas</span> (1776), and <span class="italic">The American Military Pocket Atlas</span> (1776), the last of these catering for topical interest in the American colonies.<br>
<br>In the early 1780s John Bennett began to show signs of insanity, and the partnership came to an end in 1784 or 1785. Sayer was now sixty and made no innovations after Bennett left. By 1791 he was in ill health, relying increasingly on his assistants and eventual successors, Robert Laurie and James Whittle, and spending much time in Bath and at his house in Richmond.<br>
<br>Sayer was by now a rich man, but he declined the City of London honours of sheriff and mastership of the Stationers' Company and turned his mind to improving the large house on Richmond Hill which he had bought in 1776. Zoffany painted a family group here, showing Sayer in the grounds of the enlarged mansion, which he barely lived to see, with his second wife, Alice Longfield, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tilson, the widow he married on 8 February 1780, and James Sayer, the surviving son of his first marriage. It shows a solid, plainly dressed man, untouched by extravagances of dress or manner that his wealth might have brought, but well content to be portrayed as a country gentleman.<br>
<br>Sayer's success was based on commercial rather than creative skills. He achieved a leading position in the print, map, and chart trades by benefiting from common production facilities and distribution channels and exploiting the expanding markets in all three fields. As a publisher he was shrewd and cautious, at first venturing into the risky atlas market only in partnership with others, and spotting trends in popular taste but building his vast collection of plates by buying plates which had already proved successful. As a seller he developed his provincial, colonial, and foreign contacts to reach a wide market. It was only in the second half of his career, operating from this strong base, that he became more adventurous, moving into fine prints of contemporary pictures and later into chart publishing.<br>
<br>Sayer died at Bath aged sixty-nine on 29 January 1794 &#145;after a lingering illness&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 3 Feb 1794, 4c) and was buried at St Mary's, Richmond, on 7 February. He was survived by his second wife and by one but probably no more of his six children.<br>
