<span class="headword">Torrens,  Henry Whitelocke</span>  (1806&#150;1852), <span class="occ">administrator in India and author</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27563/', "Major-General Sir Henry Torrens (1779&#150;1828)")</script> and his wife, Sarah (<i>c</i>.1781&#150;1863), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21590/', "Robert Patton")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21589/', "Patton, Philip")</script>], one-time governor of St Helena, was born on 20 May 1806 at Canterbury, Kent. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27562/', "Sir Arthur Wellesley Torrens")</script> was his brother. He was educated at Charterhouse School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he was rusticated along with the duke of Wellington's sons for painting the doors of the college red. He left a more lasting mark on the college as one of the founders of its choral society. In 1828, having first tried law and a Foreign Office clerkship, he accepted a writership in the East India Company's service.<br>
<br>Torrens arrived in Calcutta in November 1828 and by the following July had made sufficient progress in Arabic, Persian, and Hindustani to be given an appointment in Meerut district as assistant to the magistrate. He remained in Meerut until 1835 and, with Henry Miers Elliot, helped found the <span class="italic">Meerut Observer</span>, one of the North-Western Provinces' first newspapers. In this period, he was twice married: firstly, on 21 November 1832, to Eliza Mary (1803&#150;1834), daughter of Sir Walter Roberts, bt, with whom he had one son; and secondly, on 20 November 1835, to Louisa Anne Rebecca (<i>bap</i>. 1817), daughter of George Law of the Bengal civil service, with whom he had two sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>In 1835 he returned to Calcutta to a place in the secretariat and while there threw himself into the agitation for greater freedom for the press. From October 1837 until February 1840 he accompanied Lord Auckland on his extensive up-country tour as deputy secretary in all the civil departments in attendance on the governor-general. His linguistic skills shone brilliantly on this tour, and many of the princes and dignitaries meeting Auckland asked specifically for Torrens as their interpreter. It was while in this post, according to J. W. Kaye, that Torrens exercised a baneful influence on Auckland and, along with John Colvin and William Macnaghten, persuaded him to invade Afghanistan. Kaye's portrait of Torrens in his <span class="italic">History of the War in Afghanistan</span> (1851) is a somewhat catty one, noting, for example, his popularity with the women of the governor-general's suite. In a reply published posthumously in the <span class="italic">Friend of India</span> in September 1852, Torrens stated that although he had supported the decision to reinstate Shah Shuja in Afghanistan, at least until it transpired that an army of occupation would be required to keep him there, he had never been sufficiently close to Auckland actually to influence the content of the policy.<br>
<br>In October 1840 Torrens became secretary to the board of customs in Calcutta. In April 1847 he was shunted into a dead-end job as agent to the governor-general at Murshidabad, where he remained until his death in 1852. Torrens's friends lamented this snubbing of an extremely talented officer, but Torrens himself had never made any secret of his antipathy for the service and had disdained to cultivate the patrons necessary for promotion.<br>
<br>Torrens had always devoted much of his leisure to literature. In 1838 he published what would eventually be seen as his most substantial work, the first volume of a translation of the <span class="italic">Arabian Nights</span>. Torrens's version is noteworthy for its liveliness and the absence of the earnestness and scholarly pretensions that characterized other translations of the day. He contributed several articles on ancient coins, inscriptions, and gems to the journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and also served as secretary to the society from 1840 to 1846. In 1846 the <span class="italic">Eastern Star</span> began publishing instalments of his wide-ranging <span class="italic">Remarks on the Scope and Uses of Military Literature and History</span>, which was subsequently reissued as a book, and in 1848 he published a novel, <span class="italic">Madame de Malguet</span>, which was favourably received in London. A collection of his shorter pieces along with a memoir of his life was published by James Hume in London in 1854.<br>
<br>Torrens died at Calcutta on 16 August 1852, and was buried the next day in the Lower Circular Road cemetery there.<br>
