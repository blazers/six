<span class="headword">Corfe,  Arthur Thomas</span>  (1773&#150;1863), <span class="occ">organist</span>, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6316/', "Joseph Corfe (1740&#150;1820)")</script>, was born on 9 April 1773, at Salisbury, where his father was later organist. In early life he was a pupil of a Mr Antram of Salisbury, and in 1783 he became a chorister of Westminster Abbey under Benjamin Cooke. He was for some time a pupil of Clementi for the piano. In 1796 he married Frances, the daughter of J. Davies, vicar of Padworth, Berkshire; they had fourteen children. In 1804, on the resignation of his father, Corfe succeeded him as organist of Salisbury Cathedral, and by 1813, if contemporary accounts are to be believed, he had moulded the choir into a state of remarkable perfection. In 1828 he organized and undertook at his own risk a festival at Salisbury, which took place with very great success on 19&#150;22 August of that year. He himself conducted the whole of the performances, and the organ was played for him by his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_6315"></a><span class="headword">John Davies Corfe</span>  (1804&#150;1876), who was <span class="occ">organist of Bristol Cathedral</span> from 1825 for more than fifty years, as well as the long-time conductor of the Bristol Madrigal Society Choir, at that period one of the most famous choirs in England. Among the solo singers at the festival were Mary Ann Paton, Rosalbina Caradori-Allan, and John Braham.<br>
<br>Corfe's work as a composer was not remarkable. He wrote a service, a few anthems, songs, and glees, as well as some piano pieces. He also published arrangements of different kinds, and a book on <span class="italic">The Principles of Harmony and Thorough-Bass</span>. Towards the end of his life his health showed signs of failing, but he attended the daily service regularly until the end. On 28 January 1863 he was found dead at his house, in the close at Salisbury, early in the morning, kneeling by his bedside as if in prayer. He was buried in the cloister of the cathedral, where a tablet was erected to his memory by his thirteen surviving children.<br>
<br>Several of Corfe's sons were choristers at Magdalen College, Oxford. His fourth son, George Corfe, became resident medical officer at the Middlesex Hospital, and wrote several medical treatises. Another son, <a name="cosubject_6314"></a><span class="headword">Charles William Corfe</span>  (1814&#150;1883), took the degree of DMus at Oxford in 1852, and was <span class="occ">organist</span> of Christ Church, Oxford, from 1846 to his retirement shortly before his death on 16 December 1883. He was appointed choragus to the university in 1860, and published several glees, partsongs, and anthems.<br>
