<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hanson,  James Edward</span>, Baron Hanson  (1922&#150;2004), <span class="occ">industrialist and financier</span>, was born on 20 January 1922 at Wood Bank, Scar Lane, Golcar, Huddersfield, the elder son of Robert Hanson (1892&#150;1973), businessman, and his wife, Louisa Ann, daughter of Albert Edward Rodgers. His father was a hard, domineering man who controlled several companies engaged in road haulage, coach operations, and coach travel, and whose early nineteenth-century ancestors had owned the pack-horses that carried cloth from weavers' cottages on the Pennine moors to sell at Huddersfield. Robert Hanson was for some years a master of foxhounds, and owned several successful show-jumping horses. As a boy James Hanson saw his father laboriously rebuild his business, which had been ruined by a warehouse fire.<br>
<br>Hanson attended Elland grammar school in Leeds, but was too unwell to go to Uppingham as intended by his father, and had a brief, unhappy spell at an obscure boarding-school named Merlegh near Reading. On leaving there he began training as an accountant with the intention of entering the family business, but in 1939 he joined the 7th battalion, the duke of Wellington's regiment, and served during the Second World War as a staff officer. He became a director of Hanson Transport in 1946, and was enriched when it was nationalized in 1948. He and his younger brother, Bill, then went to Canada to escape the austerities of post-war Britain. They started a haulage business at Hamilton, Ontario, and with their father's backing founded Jet Petroleum, which was sold after some years to the Conoco oil company. Hanson enjoyed the company of young actresses, and in December 1951 became engaged to the film star <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52107/', "Audrey Hepburn")</script>, although they never married. After the denationalization of his family's haulage business, he resumed working for his father.<br>
<br>The death in 1954 from cancer of his brother, Bill, an Olympic show-jumper, was a profound shock for Hanson. It resulted in him forming an inseparable friendship with Bill's best friend, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57953/', "Gordon White")</script>, and this in turn led to them becoming a formidable and enduring business combination. Initially they formed the Hanson and White Greeting Card Company, which imported humorous American greetings cards. This venture was a modest success, and with the proceeds of its sale they bought a truck and van distribution business, Oswald Tillotson Ltd.<br>
<br>Hanson had been a sickly youth but developed into a dynamic and virile-looking man: 6 feet 4 inches tall, ramrod-backed, thin, wiry, handsome, and elegant. He was punctual, immaculately dressed, and had something of the martinet about him. On 17 January 1959 he married Geraldine Kaelin (1928&#150;2004), a divorcee who had managed the New York office of his greetings-card company. She had formerly been known as Geraldine Fernanda Kline, and was the daughter of Ferdinand Fleischmann, business executive. They had two sons, Robert (<i>b</i>. 1960) and Brook (<i>b</i>. 1964), and Hanson also acquired a step-daughter. After his marriage Hanson gave up hunting, and in 1960 left the management of Hanson Transport, although he remained on its board, and was its chairman from 1965 to 1996.<br>
<br>Hanson and White determined to buy asset-rich but under-performing companies with good cash-flows, run them more profitably, and sell off the assets lucratively. &#145;Asset-stripping&#146; was the pejorative epithet applied to this sort of business strategy. In 1964 the two friends sold Oswald Tillotson to the Wiles Group, manufacturers of agricultural fertilizers and sacks. They then gained control of Wiles, reorganized the company, shed its surplus management, and sold its fertilizer business. Their next acquisition was a company that shifted muck and debris, Scottish Land Development. In 1968 they bought a brick-making business, Butterley. These and other interests were consolidated in 1969 in the Hanson Trust, of which Hanson became chairman. He and White continued to take control of companies manufacturing sacks, bricks, paints, and fertilizers, although their bid for the Costain construction company was defeated in 1972. As they amassed an increasingly ramified conglomerate, they held to one key principle that distinguished them from their rivals: while adding value to the lower-valued parts of their businesses, they always sold any subsidiary part with a higher value than the parent.<br>
<br>The Hanson Trust survived the crisis that bankrupted many asset-strippers in the early 1970s, but White grew disgusted with the business environment in Britain, moved to New York in 1973, and left the Hanson Trust's board. However the two men remained in close and indeed daily collaboration, and White's emigration brought a decisive turn in the Hanson Trust's fortunes. White, who revelled in the ruthless, bullying world of American corporations, formed an American company, Hanson Industries, and began buying businesses involved in fertilizers, animal feeds, and garden tools. While White identified targets for takeovers, and made the deals, Hanson ran the businesses from his London base. Hanson, too, loved the American attitude to big business, and thrived on surmounting challenges. He was a decisive, demanding, and autocratic chairman, with a fierce temper when roused. Even in its heyday in the 1980s the Hanson Trust's headquarters staff never exceeded two dozen employees, and was run on spare lines. Hanson communicated with White and their subordinates by telephone and handwritten faxes, shredded their replies, and discouraged his offices from keeping extensive files that might conceivably later be subject to subpoena. Though cool in his working relationships, he possessed real charm and an exciting air of authority.<br>
<br>As a trustee of the D'Oyly Carte opera company in the 1970s Hanson met and impressed Marcia Falkender, Harold Wilson's confidential secretary. It nevertheless seemed an odd use of prime ministerial patronage when Hanson received a knighthood in Wilson's resignation honours list of 1976, for he detested socialism, and was soon to become the archetype of the Thatcherite tycoon. Indeed the heyday of the Hanson Group was the rumbustious period of free-market economics and deregulation that characterized the Thatcher and Reagan eras. Between 1979 and 1986 the Hanson Trust was a corporate raider stalking through British and American stock markets, acquiring increasingly large businesses through the medium of contested takeovers. This strategy was masterminded by White, but fronted by Hanson. He exerted his personal attractions and blunt eloquence with powerful effect on City leaders, investment analysts, and financial journalists: with the guidance of Tim Bell he became adept at public relations in the 1980s. He presented himself as a champion of shareholders' interests, and was idolized for a time by private as well as institutional investors.<br>
<br>Hanson received a life peerage on Margaret Thatcher's recommendation in 1983. (White received a peerage eight years later, in Thatcher's resignation honours.) His companies were major donors to the Conservative Party, and in 1986 the Hanson Trust bought a 15 per cent stake in Westland Helicopters in order to support the merger with Sikorsky-Fiat that Thatcher desired. Hanson was keen for the Hanson Trust to benefit from the Thatcher government's privatization programme. Among other initiatives he explored the possibility of the trust taking over the denationalized National Coal Board, the government holding in British Petroleum, the privatized Horserace Totalisator Board (1989), and the privatized electricity generating organization Powergen (1990).<br>
<br>The Hanson Trust's British acquisitions included the Ever Ready batteries company Berec (1982), United Drapery Stores (1983), and the London Brick Company (1984). Its takeover in 1986 of the Imperial Tobacco group, including the Courage brewery business, cost almost &pound;2 billion, and was bitterly contested. After his opponents had finally been vanquished Hanson went to the boardroom and personally took down the portraits of the Courage and Wills family directors. Neither he nor White had any respect for entrenched company cultures, and had no interest in the proposition that strong companies have strong internal cultures: they regarded established company cultures and structures as congeries of inefficient and pompous special interests. The landmark acquisition, in 1989, of Consolidated Goldfields cost &pound;3.3 billion. The Hanson Trust's reputation for buying low, selling high, and operating with ruthless efficiency attracted both admirers and detractors. Many observers were impressed that on average almost one-third of the cost of a Hanson acquisition was recouped through disposal in the first six months. This could only have been achieved by careful scrutiny and reflection. The value of Hanson Trust shares rose by over 31,000 per cent between 1965 and 1991.<br>
<br>From the outset in the 1960s Hanson and White eschewed high-risk or capital-intensive businesses involving advanced technologies or requiring long-term investment. They stripped the businesses down to essentials and sold off extraneous parts (often for as much as they had paid for the entirety). They jettisoned the senior executives, and promoted middle management into their jobs. Typically, in 1981, they reduced the head office staff at Ever Ready batteries from 550 to 75 and removed six of its nine layers of management. To most observers this ruthless cost-cutting seemed desirable and overdue. Hanson instilled financial discipline into the promoted managers, motivated them with equity incentives which allied their interests with those of shareholders, and prided himself on his trusting and effective delegation. But his claims that he gave his top executives liberty to run their own organizations were spurious: managers had to seek authority for spending decisions (at times anything over &pound;500) from Hanson Trust headquarters. Hanson and White also discouraged&#151;indeed interdicted&#151;long-term planning involving fundamental research or major capital investment. They abolished, for example, the research department of their Duracell battery business, although it was a technical leader in its sector. The Hanson Trust's successes meant that its practices were endorsed for many years by investment analysts, with the result that City opinion exacerbated the continuing decline of capital investment by Britain's major industrial companies.<br>
<br>In 1991 Hanson Trust (then Britain's sixth biggest company) received a fatal check. It began positioning itself to launch a takeover bid for Britain's largest company, ICI, a company Hanson privately scorned as fat and complacent. This move was intended to mark the apotheosis of his and White's buccaneering careers. They proposed to rename the enlarged group Imperial Hanson Industries, to sell many traditional Hanson operations, and to spend the proceeds on developing ICI's pharmaceutical division into a global giant. ICI and its advisers, the investment bank Goldman Sachs, mustered political resistance to the move, and publicized the arbitrary and even eccentric style of Hanson and White's management. ICI's counterblast deterred Hanson Trust from formulating a bid, and City analysts realized that the Hanson&#150;White strategy was no longer purposive: the two men would need to make ever bigger acquisitions to maintain their impetus and profitability; and if such acquisitions were impossible, there was no point in maintaining the Hanson Trust as a conglomerate. Indeed City sentiment was turning against Hanson's style of wheeler-dealing. The rise during the 1990s of private equity houses and the globalized market for corporate control made it harder to find hidden value in companies. With the death of White in 1995 Hanson lost not only his most intimate friend but also his surest guide to companies with hidden value. New rules on corporate governance were an insurmountable obstacle to Hanson's business methods, which had entailed running a conglomerate&#151;worth &pound;14 billion at its zenith&#151;as a private fiefdom. After some restive and unsatisfactory years, the conglomerate's four main constituent parts&#151;tobacco, energy, chemicals, and building materials&#151;were separated in 1996. Following this dismantling of the trust Hanson retired as chairman in 1997, although Hanson plc survived as a building products company derived from the original brick and aggregates business. Hanson and his elder son, Robert, subsequently set up as venture capitalists working through a company named Hanson Capital.<br>
<br>Hanson was robustly pro-American, and after building a house in the Las Palmas district of Palm Springs in 1982 spent his winters in California, supposedly controlling his possessions from a pool-side telephone. He had a simple, forthright patriotism, and in 1982, before agreeing to invest in a film about the Special Air Service, <span class="italic">Who Dares Wins</span>, he required assurances that the script would not denigrate Britain's armed forces. In his last years he denounced British membership of the European Union, and contributed anti-European articles to the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> and other newspapers. He died of prostate cancer on 1 November 2004, at Kimber Cottage, Winterbourne, Berkshire (his British home). He was survived by his sons and stepdaughter, his wife, Geraldine, having died in February 2004.<br>
