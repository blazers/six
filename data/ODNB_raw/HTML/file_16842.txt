<span class="headword">Lloyd <span class="st"> [Flude]</span>,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1475&#150;1523), <span class="occ">musician</span>, is of unknown parentage and upbringing; the terms of his will and his early circumstances connect him with Caerleon and the Bristol region. By 1498&#150;9 he was already sufficiently well connected to petition successfully for conferment of a corrody of Thetford Priory. From 1504 to 1508 he was employed by Edward, duke of Buckingham, as director of an ensemble of men and boy singers for his private entertainment. During 1509 he was admitted a gentleman of Henry VIII's Chapel Royal, an appointment held until death.<br>
<br>In 1512 he obtained a corrody of St Augustine's Abbey, Bristol, and following the death of the abbot in June 1515 saw fit to foment dissension among the canons. Richard Fox, bishop of Winchester, wrote of &#145;the inordinat, hedye and unreligiose dealyng&#146; of a troublesome clique, and claimed that &#145;Lloyd of the Kynges chapell is auctor of much of this busynesse&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 79&#150;80); Lloyd hoped to influence the choice of a new abbot and so earn himself a large fee in gratitude. Perhaps an unfavourable outcome left him stricken with contrition, since by January 1519, when he made his will, he had resolved to go on pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Having visited the tomb of Christ in Jerusalem, he returned in time to join the Chapel Royal at the Field of Cloth of Gold (1520).<br>
<br>Lloyd's tombstone (minutely described by Strype) represented him as bachelor of music, though his award is recorded at neither English university. As &#145;Flude in armonia graduatus&#146; he was the composer of three items surviving in a songbook of <i>c</i>.1520 from the court of Henry VIII. All exhibit technical ingenuity. One is a straightforward vocal canon, three parts in one. Each of the others is a brief textless fantasia whose three written-out voices are all but self-sufficient, to which a fourth voice can be added through the solution of an encrypted instruction. Dart's attribution to Lloyd of the magnificent mass <span class="italic">O quam suavis est</span> and its associated antiphon <span class="italic">Ave regina celorum</span> seems unconvincing. Their pairing in a single presentation manuscript appears to constitute a submission for a doctoral degree, which Lloyd did not possess, and consideration of the encrypted attribution seems to point more convincingly toward Dr George Newton. Lloyd died on 3 April 1523, and was buried in the chapel of the Savoy Hospital, London.<br>
