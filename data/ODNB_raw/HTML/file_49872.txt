<span class="headword">Lewis, Sir  (William) Arthur</span>  (1915&#150;1991), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born on 23 January 1915 at Castries, St Lucia, the fourth son of George Ferdinand Lewis (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1922) and his wife, Ida, both schoolteachers who had immigrated to St Lucia from Antigua. He later claimed that an illness that kept him from school furthered his education immensely and that his year spent in the civil service before he went to university taught him the importance of filing and method. After his time at St Mary's College, Castries, and in the civil service, he obtained a scholarship in 1932 and moved to Britain to study at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). He gained BComm first-class, and obtained another scholarship to do his PhD there. In 1938 he was appointed to its faculty. He married in 1947 Gladys Jacobs, Grenadan by birth, a teacher. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>Lewis remained at LSE until 1948, by which time he was a reader, and in 1948 he took up a chair in economics at Manchester University. He stayed there until 1958, becoming the principal of the University College of the West Indies and then its vice-chancellor when it became a fully-fledged university in 1962. He was a close spectator of the collapse of the West Indian Federation. After being knighted in 1963, he moved to Princeton University, where he remained until his retirement in 1983. From 1943, when he joined the Board of Trade, Lewis worked directly for governments or as a consultant for various governments or quasi-governmental organizations, the last of these being as president of the Caribbean development bank from 1970 to 1973.<br>
<br>Lewis's original research was on the problems of the industrialized world. In 1940 he produced his first substantial work, <span class="italic">Economic Problems of Today</span>, soon after the war <span class="italic">Monopoly in British Industry</span>, and in 1949 <span class="italic">Overhead Costs: some Essays in Economic Analysis</span> and <span class="italic">Economic Survey, 1919&#150;1939</span>. In the last of these he had argued that the growing inter-war protectionism had exacerbated economic problems and prolonged the depression. In his last major purely economic work, <span class="italic">Growth and Fluctuations, 1870&#150;1913</span> (1978), he returned to examine an earlier period when trade was much freer. He was, however, to become better known for his work in development economics, of which he was regarded as one of the founders and for which he received the Nobel prize in 1979 (shared with Theodore Schultz of the USA). The origins of this side of Lewis's work can be discerned in his early writings on the British West Indies. In 1936 he had written an analysis of the non-plantation sector of agriculture in those territories; in 1939 he published his discussion of the labour disturbances (<span class="italic">Labour in the West Indies: the Birth of a Workers' Movement</span>) and their economic causes and submitted a memorandum to the royal commission that was investigating those events.<br>
<br>Lewis's opportunity to do something practical came in 1944, when he moved from the Board of Trade to the Colonial Office. In 1945 he published a devastating critique of the proposals by another economist for the development of Jamaica. His own proposals grew out of his own earlier examination of the West Indies and his time as a consultant to the Caribbean commission, when he reflected upon the policies to develop Puerto Rico. In 1950 his <span class="italic">Industrialization of the British West Indies</span> built on those policies. Described somewhat inaccurately as industrialization by invitation, the main policies were adhered to by most of these governments but they failed to take sufficient note of Lewis's warning that a federation was the prerequisite for their success. At the University College of the West Indies his attempts to make the institution more relevant to the social and economic needs of the region were not always well received. He found the end of the federation disheartening. His continuing concern with the West Indies was demonstrated when he headed the Caribbean development bank, allegedly threatening to resign from Princeton University if he could not get an extra year's leave.<br>
<br>Lewis's major contributions to development economics were made in the early 1950s. By this time he had broadened his West Indian experience by working on the United Nations report <span class="italic">Measures for the Economic Development of Underdeveloped Countries</span> (1951), his membership of the board of the Colonial Development Corporation (1951&#150;3), and as consultant to the Gold Coast and western Nigeria governments and for the United Nations in Asia and the Far East. He returned to Ghana from 1957 to 1958 as adviser to the prime minister, Kwame Nkrumah, though the relationship ended badly. His major, purely theoretical, statement of the major problems of development was &#145;Economic development with unlimited supplies of labour&#146; (1954). Here he identified a capitalist sector of the economy that needed to expand if economic development was to be successful; it would do this by drawing labour from the stagnant traditional sector, thereby expanding and producing the investment needed for further economic growth. This article reintroduced the concerns for long-term growth and its effects on different sections of society that nineteenth-century classical economists maintained; it also served to demonstrate Lewis's recognition that neo-classical economics had severe limitations in dealing with the problems of developing countries. His summation of his experience appeared the next year as <span class="italic">The Theory of Economic Growth</span>. Here Lewis showed his knowledge that development was not a mere exercise in applied economic theory but had to take into account political, social, and cultural influences. In an appendix he even broached the topic of the links between growth and welfare. In 1966 he wrote <span class="italic">Development Planning: the Essentials of Economic Policy</span>, which displayed his usual humane good sense and returned to the ground that he had traversed in 1949, when dealing with developed economies. In <span class="italic">Politics in West Africa</span> (1965) he wrote about the problems of democracy in ethnically divided societies, a subject that has recently become more fashionable. In 1964, when most aid had a political agenda, he raised the issue of its effective use. In 1985 his lectures on <span class="italic">Racial Conflict and Economic Development</span> were published; there his concerns with the wider context of economic problems were once more clearly set out.<br>
<br>After his retirement from Princeton in 1983 Lewis moved to Barbados but continued to lecture. His last years were marred by illness and he died, in Bridgetown, Barbados, on 15 June 1991. He was buried on 22 June in the grounds of the Sir Arthur Lewis Community College in St Lucia. He is also commemorated by the Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies (SALISES) on each of the three campuses of the University of the West Indies.<br>
