<span class="headword">Maturin,  William</span>  (1806&#150;1887), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, was born in Dublin, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18351/', "Charles Robert Maturin (1780&#150;1824)")</script>, novelist and dramatist, and Henrietta, daughter of Thomas Kingsbury of Dublin. He was educated at Dublin University, where he graduated BA in 1831 and accumulated the degrees of MA, BD, and DD in 1866. He took holy orders in 1831 and after serving for some years a curacy in Dublin, Maturin was presented in 1844 by William Le Fanu to the perpetual curacy of Grangegorman, co. Dublin. On 17 August of the preceding year he had married Jane Cooke, eldest daughter of Captain Arthur Beatty; they had two sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34942/', "Basil William Maturin")</script>.<br>
<br>A high-churchman formed by the movement of Pusey and Newman, Maturin was unreserved in the expression of his views. This led Archbishop Richard Whately and others to neglect him, so that, in spite of his great talents as a preacher and his devotion to parochial details, Maturin remained all his life merely incumbent of All Saints, Grangegorman, with an income never exceeding &pound;100 a year, though about 1860 his friends obtained for him the additional post of librarian in Archbishop Marsh's Library, Dublin. In England he would have been considered a moderate churchman, but to the Irish evangelicals he always appeared as little removed from a Roman Catholic and to a large section in Dublin his name was a term of theological reproach. After speaking of the great qualities of his sermons, Sir John Pentland Mahaffy, the provost of Trinity College, Dublin, wrote of Maturin:<blockquote>He was a grim Dantesque sort of man, with deep affection for his family and friends hidden under a severe exterior. He was perfectly certain and clear in his views&#151;a quality rare in modern preachers and fatal to modern preaching; his simple and burning words reflected the zeal of his spirit &hellip; I saw him crush by his fiery words a mob of young men, who came to disturb his service on Protestant principles, and drive them cowed and slinking from his church. (<span class="italic">Athenaeum</span>, 54)</blockquote>Besides several pamphlets, single sermons, and addresses to the Irish Church Society, Maturin wrote <span class="italic">Six Lectures on the Events of Holy Week</span> (1860) and <span class="italic">The Blessedness of the Dead in Christ</span>, a collection of twenty-four of his sermons (1888). He died at 11 Alma Road, Seapoint, co. Dublin, on 30 June 1887, and after lying in state for four days before the altar was buried in All Saints' Church, Grangegorman, on 4 July.<br>
