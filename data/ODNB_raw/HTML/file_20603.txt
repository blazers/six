<span class="headword">O'Glacan,  Nial</span> <span class="st"> [Nellanus Glacanus]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1602&#150;1655), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born in co. Donegal, Ireland. He may have gained the rudiments of a professional education&#151;familiarity with the aphorisms of Hippocrates, and acquaintance with some of Galen's works&#151;from one or other of the hereditary medical families, probably the MacDuinntsleibhes who served the O'Donnells, continuing his studies in continental schools. He evidently left Ireland at an early age, for he attended the exiled Hugh O'Donnell (<i>d</i>. 1602) in Spain.<br>
<br>Nellanus Glacanus, as he was known abroad, practised in Salamanca in 1621 and in the following year at Valencia. In the late 1620s, with commendable courage, he was treating plague in towns in the neighbourhood of Clermont and Toulouse, wearing the strange garb devised to give protection&#151;a long red or black leather gown, gauntlets, leather mask with glass-protected openings for the eyes, and a long beak filled with fumigants to cover the nose. O'Glacan was encouraged in his work by the bishop of Cahors, and in 1628, when the epidemic spread to Toulouse, he was appointed physician to its <i>xenodochium pestiferorum</i>. He published <span class="italic">Tractatus de peste, seu, Bevis, facilis, &amp; experta methodus curandi pestem</span>, a small volume containing 274 pages, printed by Raymond Colomerius, the university printer, in May 1629, and dedicated to Giles de Masuyer, vicomte d'Ambri&egrave;res. For many years O'Glacan remained in Toulouse; he was appointed physician to the king, and became professor of medicine in the university.<br>
<br>For one reason or another O'Glacan removed to Bologna in 1646, and possibly it was at about this time that he visited Rome. In collaboration with the bishop of Ferns and Sir Nicholas Plunkett he edited a series of poems in Latin in praise of the pope, <span class="italic">Regni Hiberniae ad sanctissimum Innocentium X pont. max. Pyramides encomiasticae</span> (1648). The preface is by O'Glacan, who mentions as his friends in Italy Francis O'Molloy, the author of &#145;Lucerna fidelium&#146;, Peter Talbot, Gerard O'Fearail, and John O'Fahy. The professor of eloquence at Lucca, Peter von Adrian Brocke, wrote a poem in praise of O'Glacan himself, the opening lines of which are quoted in Cameron's <span class="italic">History of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland</span> (p. 7) and by Fleetwood in <span class="italic">The History of Medicine in Ireland</span> (p. 49).<br>
<br>O'Glacan's quarto two-volume <span class="italic">Cursus medicus</span>, containing thirteen books in three parts (1, <span class="italic">Physiologica</span>; 2, <span class="italic">Pathologica</span>; and 3, <span class="italic">Semeiotica</span>), was published in 1655. An orthodox account of medicine, it is based firmly on Galen's teachings, making no attempt to foster new ideas. Commendatory verses are prefixed, and among those of part two are some by Gregory Fallon, a Connaughtman, who was at Bologna, and by another fellow countryman, the Revd Philip Roche SJ. Fallon says that O'Glacan is in Italy what Fuchsius was in Germany. Part one has two curious prefaces, one <i>lectori benevolo</i>, the other <i>lectori malevolo</i>.<br>
<br>These books are now great rarities, the availability of the <span class="italic">Cursus</span> in Great Britain confined to the British Library. Samuel Simms, who possessed a copy of the <span class="italic">Tractatus de peste</span>, regarded it as the more attractive, and was impressed by the personal observations scattered through the text, indicative of an extensive knowledge of the dreaded disease. O'Glacan provides a detailed account of the malady's clinical features, paying special attention to examination of the pulse and the urine, and indicating those signs which he regarded as indicating a putridity of the humours. He supplies notes of three post-mortem examinations, drawing attention to petechial haemorrhages on the pleural membrane, and to splenomegaly. As in other acute diseases the prognosis is dubious. In the preface O'Glacan speaks of the fame of Ireland for learning in ancient times, and refers to the achievements of the Irish physicians.<br>
<br>No personal details of the life of Nial O'Glacan have survived. According to Kenneth Dewhurst he died in Bologna &#145;around the middle of the century&#146;  (Dewhurst, xxxiv), but whether he lived to see the publication of the <span class="italic">Cursus</span> is not stated. Presuming he saw his book through the press, he must have exceeded the biblical span.<br>
