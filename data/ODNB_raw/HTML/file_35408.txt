<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Singh, Sir Bhupinder</span>  (1891&#150;1938), <span class="occ">maharaja of Patiala</span>, was born on 12 October 1891 in the city of Patiala, Punjab, India, the eldest son of Maharaja Rajinder Singh (1872&#150;1900), and his first wife, who died in 1897. Upon the death of his father in November 1900 he succeeded to the throne of the largest Sikh-ruled state in India. While a council of regency managed state affairs, the maharaja attended Aitchison Chiefs' College in Lahore from 1904 to 1908 and was subsequently invested with full administrative powers in 1910. In 1908 he married the daughter of Sardar Gurnam Singh, whom he appointed as his confidential secretary, and she became his senior maharani. Tall, well-built, with an imposing face and beard, Bhupinder Singh epitomized the British idea of an Indian prince. Bridging East and West, he enhanced imperial ceremonies with his brocaded silk clothes embellished with opulent pearl or emerald necklaces, but also participated in manly, British sports, first by playing and then patronizing cricket and polo, as well as the Indian sport of wrestling. He fulfilled the Indian ideal of a beneficent, ecumenical ruler by liberally endowing religious and educational institutions ranging from the Sikh Khalsa College in Amritsar to the Islamic Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh to Benares Hindu University.<br>
<br>Throughout his lifetime, which coincided with significant political change and upheaval in India, Bhupinder Singh was a generous, conspicuous, but wily military and political ally of the British empire, and a shrewd participant in Sikh political activity in the Punjab. During the First World War he and his state provided troop contingents, equipment, and monetary support. He was an enthusiastic recruiter for the British Indian army, once exhorting his subjects that it was far better to meet the angel of death through a manly demise on the battlefield than through the unmanly diseases of cholera and plague. His state furnished more than 28,000 troops, second in number only to Jammu and Kashmir. In 1918 his contributions were recognized when he represented the Indian states at the Imperial War Conference in London. Bhupinder Singh simultaneously sought to contain political hostility against the British government in connection with the forced return of Sikh immigrants from Canada on the <i>Komataga Maru</i>, and the German-financed Ghadr conspiracy in North America. During the 1920s and 1930s he astutely acted as a mediator between the government of India and Sikh political activists supporting the gurdwara reform movement launched by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak committee. The British crown and government of India recognized his military and political support with the GCIE in 1911, the GBE in 1918, the GCSI in 1921, and the GCVO in 1922. He also served as a representative of India at the League of Nations assembly in 1925.<br>
<br>Possessed of a strong and shrewd personality, Bhupinder Singh could be both charming and autocratic, winning friends and enemies among British officials, his subjects, his princely peers, and British Indian politicians. Among Indian rulers Bhupinder Singh was a formidable figure. Active in the initial organization of the chamber of princes, an advisory body of princes inaugurated in 1921, he was a perpetual member of its standing committee. Oscillating between collaborative junior colleague and ambitious rival of Maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner, the first chancellor of the chamber, Bhupinder Singh was elected chancellor in 1926 and served until 1930, again from 1933 to 1935, and from 1937 to 1938. Because of that office he was the official leader of the delegation of Indian princes to the first round-table conference in 1930 at London. However, Ganga Singh of Bikaner emerged more prominently because of his speech offering tentative princely support for a federation with British Indian provinces.<br>
<br>After initially endorsing federation, by mid-1931 Bhupinder Singh promoted confederation as an alternative scheme, partly out of personal pique at his eclipse in princely politics and partly from concern about the consequences of a federation for the future existence of princely states. His action was one factor dividing an already fractious princely order, and federation proposals lost political momentum. By March 1932 he became reconciled with Ganga Singh as an advocate for a reconfigured federation. Subsequently, die-hard Conservative politicians and journalists, particularly those associated with the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>, who opposed significant constitutional reforms in India during the 1930s, sought to gain his renewed opposition to federation. While Bhupinder Singh wavered, he ultimately remained committed. However, federation was never achieved.<br>
<br>Among his subjects Bhupinder Singh was noted for his quixotic generosity, his extravagant lifestyle, and his intolerance of political opposition. Popular politicians found him authoritarian, unwilling to accommodate but likely to imprison or co-opt any challengers. In 1930 a scathing attack by the States People's Conference on his dictatorial political practices and financial mismanagement, resulting from his personal indulgences and extensive travels, led to a British investigation of Bhupinder Singh's administration of his state. The Fitzpatrick inquiry cleared him of political wrongdoing, but the government of India imposed constraints on his control of his state's financial affairs. By 1935 challenges from his peers in the chamber of princes, intensified popular, political opposition within his state, and declining health led Bhupinder Singh to be less active in the all-Indian and imperial political spheres. He died on 23 March 1938 in Patiala and was succeeded by Yadavindra Singh, the eldest son of his senior wife. His remains were cremated in Patiala.<br>
