<span class="headword">Boys,  Thomas</span>  (1792&#150;1880), <span class="occ">biblical scholar and writer</span>, was born on 17 June 1792 at Sandwich, Kent, the only son of Rear-Admiral Thomas Boys of Kent. He was educated at Tonbridge grammar school and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, on 13 October 1808. He was made a scholar and a Smythe exhibitioner in 1810, and graduated BA (1813) and MA (1817). After university he entered the army with a view to becoming a military chaplain. He was active under Wellington in 1813 in the Peninsular War, was wounded at the battle of Toulouse, and gained the Peninsular medal. After his return Boys was ordained deacon, in 1816, and priest, in 1822. On 8 January 1822 he married a Miss Somers, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. While in the Peninsula he had translated the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Portuguese so accurately that his version was adopted there by Catholics and protestants alike, and Don Pedro I of Portugal publicly thanked him for his gift to the nation.<br>
<br>Boys soon established a reputation as a prolific writer and a Hebrew scholar. In 1821 he issued a volume of sermons, which was followed in 1824 by <span class="italic">Tactica sacra</span>, a book expounding a theory that there were similarities between the arrangement of <span class="roman">New Testament</span> writings and the parallelism used in writings of the Jewish prophets. In 1825 he published <span class="italic">A Key to the Book of Psalms</span> (reissued as <span class="italic">A Key to the Psalms</span>, edited by E. W. Bullinger, in 1890), and in 1827 he wrote <span class="italic">A Plain Exposition of the New Testament</span>. Drawing inspiration from B. W. Noel's <span class="italic">Remarks on the Revival of Miraculous Powers in the Church</span>, he published <span class="italic">The Suppressed Evidence</span> in 1832, and in 1844 he brought out his first work of history, <span class="italic">Protestantism in Papal Europe</span>. Boys also taught ancient Hebrew to Jewish students at Hackney College, Middlesex, from 1830 to 1832, and he became professor of Hebrew at the Missionary College, Islington, in 1836; while holding this last post, he revised several versions of the <span class="roman">Vulgate</span>, including Deodati's Italian <span class="roman">Bible</span> and the Arabic <span class="roman">Bible</span>.<br>
<br>Boys was a frequent contributor to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span>, where he published sketches and papers, including &#145;My Peninsular medal&#146;, which was serialized from November 1849 to July 1850. In 1848 he was appointed vicar of Holy Trinity, Hoxton, London. In addition to the many learned papers which he published under his own name, he also used the pseudonym &#145;Vedette&#146;. As well as writing about history, Hebrew scholarship, and his military experiences, he also wrote twelve papers on Chaucer and contributed to <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span>. Boys died at his home, 23 Leighton Road, Kentish Town, London, on 2 September 1880. His daughter, Frances Georgiana, survived him.<br>
