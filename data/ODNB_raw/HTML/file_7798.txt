<span class="headword">Donaldson,  James</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1719), <span class="occ">publisher and writer</span>, is a figure whose origins are unknown, apart from his own account of them. He claimed that his father had been a landowner, and that he himself raised a company in the earl of Angus's regiment for William III in the revolution of 1688. He saw action, being wounded at Killiecrankie and imprisoned in Blair Castle, but received no reward. The company was disbanded at Candlemas 1690 and shortage of funds forced him abroad for a few years.<br>
<br>Donaldson took to writing with no great success. His <span class="italic">Husbandry anatomized, or, An enquiry into the present manner of tilling and manuring the ground in Scotland</span> (1697&#150;8) was unduly neglected. It contained a programme for improved farming in advance of current thought, his most innovative proposal being for the use of potatoes as a field crop. This pamphlet was dedicated to the earl of Marchmont, then lord chancellor, and in an introduction he supplied what little is known of his family background.<br>
<br>Donaldson's next publication, a piece of bad verse entitled <span class="italic">A Picklock for Swearers, or, A Looking-Glass for Atheists and Profane Persons</span> (1698), was more successful for the Edinburgh council gave him an award of 10 Rex dollars &#145;for his paines in compyling of some poems against profanity which are dedicat to the good town&#146;  (Armet, <span class="italic">Extracts, 1689&#150;1701</span>, 231). He wrote various other tracts, mainly on economic issues. <span class="italic">The Undoubted Art of Thriving</span> (1700) proposed the expansion of trade and laid emphasis on the Indian and African Company (the Darien scheme). In 1701 he produced <span class="italic">Certain and infallible measures whereby the whole begging poor of the kingdom may be alimented at much less charge</span>, which proposed very little more than rigorous enforcement of the existing poor law, other than calling on every parish to have a group of young men to visit each household and take the &#145;vicious or idle&#146; to compulsory work. Parishes were to force those in workhouses to work more productively, so as to earn more than they ate. He seems ignorant of the lack of workhouses and assumes that profitable work is always available. He also wrote a series of verse panegyrics to various craft skills: malting and brewing (1712), weaving (1712), and wright craft (1713).<br>
<br>Donaldson married Jean Wedderburn (<i>d</i>. 1697) on 28 August 1691. Their son James (1694&#150;1754) was a weaver, but their grandson, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64278/', "Alexander Donaldson")</script>, and a further generation returned to publishing. He claimed to have a numerous family, but other members have not been traced. There is an undated verse flysheet of no literary merit entitled <span class="italic">An epithelanium on the jovial nuptials of Captain James Donaldson with the meritorious Mrs Jean Reid, alias Mrs Scott, composed by a lady of honour</span>. This may have been part of a jest or protest at his press.<br>
<br>Donaldson's significance lies in the fact that for fifteen years, from his printing house on the south side of Edinburgh's High Street, he was editor of the first newspaper in Scotland to have had any long-term continuity. This was the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Gazette</span>, a weekly licensed by the privy council on 10 March 1699. The paper's text was supposed to be checked before printing by Lord Cassillis for the council, but at first this was not enforced and in June 1699 a piece appeared which annoyed the council: Donaldson was imprisoned for five days, securing release by an abject statement of submission. Control in advance of printing then became a reality.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Gazette</span> consisted mainly of news from London, and British and foreign politics, passed on by the council. This was what the Scottish business community wanted for most of the eighteenth century. Donaldson also ran a business in &#145;buriall letters&#146;, adaptable printed formulas allowing for the insertion of specific funerals. He tried to set up a factory for producing firearms, but ran into opposition from the Edinburgh Hammermen as well as the council.<br>
<br>In 1705 the promise of a monopoly to Donaldson was broken by the council and one Adam Boig was allowed a similar newspaper, the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Courant</span>. Boig was also later allowed to print the names of the Scottish members of the British parliament. He got his news by post from London, for which he had to pay postage. Donaldson obtained the privilege of correspondence with France. Both editors carried on a vigorous correspondence with the council complaining of the privileges of the other, and in Donaldson's view there was no adequate market for two papers. He received a grant of &pound;30 from the convention of royal burghs but still felt inadequately supported. When Boig printed an advertisement which the council disliked, both editors were put in gaol. The <span class="italic">Courant</span> ceased publication soon after the quarrel with Donaldson. In 1708 the privy council was abolished but the town council of Edinburgh attempted to assert similar control. Donaldson had become a burgess and guild brother of the burgh in 1703. He died on 17 September 1719 and was buried two days later in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh. He left a legacy for afflicted children.<br>
