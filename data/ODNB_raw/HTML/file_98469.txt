<span class="headword">Tutill,  George</span>  (1817&#150;1887), <span class="occ">banner and regalia maker</span>, was born on 16 April 1817 in Howden, Yorkshire, and baptized there on 19 April, the son of Thomas Tutill (1775/6&#150;1860), corn miller, and his wife, Elizabeth Richardson (1789/90&#150;1859), who is said to have been a regalia apron maker. He had at least one sister, Jane. Details of his early life are obscure; the family appears to have moved to Hunslet near Leeds before 1823. There is an apocryphal story that Tutill started out as a travelling showman, but there is no evidence to support it. He always claimed to have set up his business as a banner maker by 1837; on 28 June 1838 he married Emma Fairfield in Sculcoates, Yorkshire, giving his occupation as artist. By 1841 he was living in John Street, Tower Hamlets, London, with his wife, Emma, who died from tuberculosis later that year.<br>
<br>Between 1846 and 1858 Tutill exhibited a number of landscape paintings in London, among them <span class="italic">Scarborough Castle</span> at the Royal Academy in 1846, and five works at the British Institution, including <span class="italic">Douglas Bay</span> (1850), <span class="italic">Holy Island Castle</span> (1851), and <span class="italic">Glengareff</span> (1852). Their whereabouts are unknown. It was, however, as an entrepreneur of banner and regalia making that Tutill made his reputation and fortune. By 1851 his principal occupation was &#145;banner supplyer&#146;, and by the end of the decade he had moved his business into purpose-built premises at 83 City Road, where it remained until the building was destroyed in the blitz in 1940. Tutill's business fed on the mid-Victorian delight in civic and community associations and public politics: friendly societies, trade unions, freemasons and Sunday schools all flourished in this period, and many of them went to Tutill's for their emblems, regalia, and banners. As befitted an entrepreneur in this age of empire, Tutill did not restrict his work to the British Isles: his firm produced banners for unions and friendly societies in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa, and took prizes in several colonial exhibitions. He toured Australia, New Zealand, and the United States in 1881.<br>
<br>Tutill's banners were made of woven silk and painted in oils on both front and back. They bear evidence of connections to fairground art: brightly coloured silk backgrounds were highly embellished with golden scrollwork (either woven into the silk or painted on afterwards), ornate lettering on streamers imitated the ripple of the banner itself, and the central painted image was often supplemented by a series of inset cameos. Tuthill produced the banners from scratch, beginning with raw silk and weaving it to the required size (from the 1880s on a purpose-built Jacquard loom, which Tutill claimed was the largest in the world). Teams of specialist artists would then paint different aspects of the banner: portraitists, landscape artists, technical scene painters, and signwriters were all employed on a production line of popular art. Criticized both for their ostentatious gaudiness and for the uninspired academicism of the central images, the friendly society and trade union banners provide important visual evidence of the social and ideological development of working-class politics. The early nineteenth-century trade associations of &eacute;lite craftsmen preferred iconography that drew on classical and biblical themes and emphasized the respectability and antecedents of labour, while from the late 1880s onwards the new mass unions of unskilled labour were represented by more overtly political and socialist images and slogans that emphasized future advances rather than past glories. The Tutill style dominated banner-making for over a century and was widely imitated; this causes some difficulties in dating banners.<br>
<br>Tutill was from the 1840s active in the friendly society the Ancient Order of Foresters: he was the first district chief ranger of the City of London district, and was a long-serving member of court &#145;Industry&#146; no. 1752. Despite the association of his firm with trade unions, he was not himself a union man, and it was not until 1934 that his workforce was unionized.<br>
<br>Tutill's domestic life was unconventional; after the death of his first wife he formed a liaison with Elizabeth Allsop Bale, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Turner (1819/20&#150;1884), the wife of Thomas Trout Bale, an eating-house keeper of Leadenhall Street who became insolvent in 1853, with whom she had two sons and two daughters; she was the daughter of Samuel Turner, wire drawer. The birth of her daughter with Tutill, Georgina Tutill Bale, was registered early in 1855; the child was living with her father in Islington in 1861. A son, George, was born in 1862 and died in 1864. By 1871 Tutill had moved out of central London to the Red House, Upton Lane, West Ham, Essex, where he lived with his &#145;wife&#146;, Elizabeth, their daughter, and three servants, although he did not in fact marry Elizabeth until 5 April 1878 (when she was described as &#145;widow&#146; of fifty-eight years) shortly before the marriage of their daughter to Charles Henry Lewis, agent.<br>
<br>The Red House, a large eighteenth-century building, stands as a visible symbol of Tutill's success. He had it substantially remodelled; over the door the motto <i>There is much to be done</i> bears witness to the credo of a self-made man. He died there on 17 February 1887 and was buried in the churchyard of Howden Minster, Yorkshire; a memorial window was placed in the minster the following year. Among his goods sold at auction in 1888 were several suites of carved oak furniture, marble statuary, and two suits of armour. Tutill's business continued to grow after his death, and the firm maintained the fiction in its advertising literature that Tutill himself continued to run operations. It was in fact successively managed by Henry Storey, Georgina Tutill's second husband, and then her son Lewis, and continued to flourish throughout the twentieth century, surviving the move out of London during the Second World War, the destruction of its premises and comprehensive business records, and the decline of the banner and regalia industries: George Tutill Ltd continues as a manufacturer predominantly of flags.<br>
<br>Few, if any, of the surviving Tutill banners date from the period before Tutill's own death. With dimensions of up to 12 feet by 11 feet, a Tutill banner could require eight men to carry it: two to carry each of the vertical poles and four more to hold the steadying guy-ropes. In 1861 Tutill patented a process for coating the centre of banners with india rubber to give additional flexibility and durability to the paintings. But although banners represented a significant investment for the organizations that commissioned them, they were essentially ephemeral and more easily destroyed than preserved. The major collection of Tutill's trade union banners and related material, made by John Gorman, is in the People's History Museum in Manchester.<br>
