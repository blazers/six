<span class="headword">Williams,  Robert</span>  (1765&#150;1827), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, entered the navy in January 1777 on the <i>Ardent</i>, commanded by Lord Mulgrave. Early in 1778 he was moved to the <i>America</i> (64 guns) with Lord Longford, and in her was present in the action off Ushant on 27 July 1778. In 1780 he went out to North America in the <i>London</i>, flagship of Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves and in her was present in the action off the Chesapeake on 16 March 1781. In August he was appointed to the <i>Royal Oak</i> as acting lieutenant; on 5 September he took part in the battle of Chesapeake Bay, and on 12 April 1782 in the action near Dominica. On 12 April 1783 he was promoted lieutenant of the <i>Argo</i>, in which he returned to England in 1784. In 1790 he was with Captain Charles Thompson in the <i>Elephant</i>; in 1793 in the <i>Centurion</i> in the channel; and in 1794 again with Thompson in the <i>Vengeance</i> in the West Indies. After the capture of Martinique he followed Thompson to the <i>Vanguard</i>. In 1796 he returned home in the <i>Minotaur</i>, and was immediately appointed first lieutenant of the <i>Prince George</i>, the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir William Parker in the battle of Cape St Vincent. For this service Williams was promoted commander and appointed acting captain of the <i>Blenheim</i>, in which Parker had hoisted his flag.<br>
<br>Williams later commanded the storeship <i>Dolphin</i> and the <i>San Ysidro</i> (74 guns) as acting captain. After he brought this ship to England his promotion was confirmed (dated 10 November 1797), and for a few months he was flag captain to Sir Charles Thompson in the <i>Formidable</i> (98 guns); but in January 1798 he was put on half pay. In 1803 he went out to the East Indies in the <i>Russell</i> (74 guns), returning in 1805 in the <i>Ruby</i> (64 guns) after his health had broken down. From 1810 to 1812 he commanded the <i>Dictator</i> (64 guns) in the Baltic with Sir James Saumarez, and from 1812 to 1814 the <i>Gloucester</i> (74 guns) in the North Sea, the Baltic, and the West Indies. He had no further service, but became a rear-admiral on 9 April 1823. He died at his house in Queen's Square, Bath, on 1 March 1827. His wife had predeceased him in 1825.<br>
