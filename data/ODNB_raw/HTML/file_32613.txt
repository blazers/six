<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Craigie, Sir  Robert Leslie</span>  (1883&#150;1959), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born in Southsea on 6 December 1883, the elder child and only son of Commander (later Admiral) Robert William Craigie (1849&#150;1911) and his wife, Henrietta Isabella Dinnis. He was educated at Heidelberg and entered the Foreign Office as a clerk in 1907. Promoted third secretary in 1908, he served as secretary to the international copyright conference at Berlin in 1908; secretary to the British delegation at the international sugar commission in Brussels from 1908 to 1913; secretary to the international conference for the protection of the elephant and rhinoceros in Africa, held in London in 1914; and secretary to the international conference relating to the New Hebrides, also held in London the same year. In 1916 he was promoted second secretary and posted to Bern as an additional commercial attach&eacute;, serving also as British representative on the inter-allied blockade committee. While in Switzerland he met Pleasant (<i>d</i>. 1956), daughter of Pleasant Alexander Stovall, a newspaper editor from Savannah, Georgia, who was then serving as United States minister in Bern. They married in 1918, and had one son.<br>
<br>Craigie remained in Bern until 1920, having been promoted first secretary in 1919. He then served briefly as acting high commissioner at Sofia, before being transferred to Washington, still as first secretary. In 1923 he returned to London, where he was employed by the department of overseas trade. He resumed his duties in the Foreign Office at the beginning of 1925.<br>
<br>In 1928 Craigie was promoted to counsellor, made head of the American department and designated the Foreign Office's chief negotiator in the area of naval arms limitation. In this capacity he was instrumental in negotiating the London naval treaties of 1930 and 1936 and the Anglo-German naval agreement of 1935. Craigie gained a reputation for being a meticulous and skilful diplomatist, winning praise from politicians such as Ramsay MacDonald and Sir John Simon. In recognition of his services he was made a CMG in 1929, a CB in 1930, and a KCMG in 1936, and promoted to assistant under-secretary of state in 1935.<br>
<br>On the basis of this reputation Craigie was appointed ambassador to Japan in 1937 and sworn of the privy council. This came as a surprise as he had not previously served in east Asia, but he did have some experience from the naval talks of negotiating with Japanese diplomats. His appointment was announced in the spring when there was a mood of renewed optimism about the chances of an Anglo-Japanese rapprochement. However, by the time he arrived in Japan in September 1937 the Sino-Japanese War had broken out and relations had deteriorated alarmingly.<br>
<br>Craigie saw his role in this new political situation as being to stop Japan from drifting further into the German orbit and thus threatening Britain with the possibility of a two-front war. Accordingly he argued that, as Britain was too weak to defend its interests in the region and as the United States was considered to be an unreliable potential ally, the best policy was to maintain an attitude of strict neutrality towards the war in China in order to avoid antagonizing Japan. He also contended that if Britain followed a conciliatory line it might well encourage moderates in the Japanese government to re-exert their influence. This view was opposed by the Foreign Office, which disparaged the idea that the moderates could exercise any power and felt that Britain should assist China in the hope that Japan would dissipate its energies in a prolonged war. In June 1939 the uncompromising attitude of the Foreign Office helped to contribute to a crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations over the status of the British concession at Tientsin (Tianjin) in north China. Craigie, who felt vindicated by the failure of Foreign Office policy, helped to resolve this crisis by exercising his astute diplomatic skills and again won high praise, this time from Chamberlain, who recommended his elevation to a GCMG, an award made in January 1941.<br>
<br>The start of the war in Europe did not lead to any substantial change in Craigie's interpretation of his role. He continued to argue the need for delicate handling of Japan and in February 1940 helped to neutralize another potentially dangerous crisis when HMS <i>Liverpool</i> intercepted a Japanese merchant vessel, the <i>Asama Maru</i>, just outside Japan's territorial waters. In addition, in June 1940 he was able, after months of laborious talks, to get a final solution to the Tientsin problem. However, just as he hoped that a corner had been turned another crisis rocked Anglo-Japanese relations.<br>
<br>In late June 1940 Japan demanded that Britain should close the Burma Road. This ultimatum arrived at Britain's lowest ebb in the war against Germany and, although the Foreign Office felt that Japan was bluffing, Winston Churchill's war cabinet decided to seek an acceptable compromise. Once again Craigie provided a diplomatic way out of the crisis, arranging a three-month closure of the Burma Road in return for a Japanese promise to seek a fair settlement of the war in China. Craigie hoped that this would lay the basis for better relations but he was to be sorely disabused. In late July 1940 the Konoe government came to office in Japan determined to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the apparent collapse of British power, and in the coming months signed the tripartite pact with Germany and Italy and occupied the northern part of French Indo-China. Craigie's hopes were dashed and in an attempt to contain Japan, Britain reacted by introducing a policy of economic sanctions, strengthening its military stance in the region, and developing a common front with the United States and the Netherlands.<br>
<br>Craigie broadly supported this idea of applying pressure on Japan but was disappointed that it was not accompanied by diplomatic incentives to change the nature of its foreign policy. In the autumn of 1941, fearful that war was imminent, he began to press the Foreign Office to become involved in the Japanese-American talks that were then taking place in Washington, and warned the foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, that Japan was prepared if necessary to fight. His advice was, however, ignored as Churchill and Eden believed that Japan was unappeasable and that the United States would not welcome British interference in the diplomatic process.<br>
<br>After the war in the Pacific began, Craigie was interned for seven months in the Tokyo embassy before being allowed to return to Britain. On his return he produced a controversial report in which he criticized the British government for not heeding his warnings in the autumn of 1941; Churchill was furious at his temerity and suppressed the report. Craigie also summarized his experiences in Japan in a more measured way in a book published in 1946, <span class="italic">Behind the Japanese Mask</span>.<br>
<br>Craigie retired from the Foreign Office in April 1944, but from 1945 to 1948 he was the British representative to the United Nations War Crimes Commission, and in 1949 he headed the British delegation to the Geneva conference for the protection of the victims of war. He died at The Day House, Sleepers Hill, Winchester, on 16 May 1959.<br>
