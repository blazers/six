<span class="headword">Meldrum,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1605&#150;1693), <span class="occ">army officer in the Danish service</span>, was born in Scotland about 1605. There is very little information on his early life and indeed confusion surrounds his early military career. Danish archival sources refer to a Thomas Meldrum in service at a time when Denmark was involved in the Thirty Years' War (1625&#150;9). However, there is disagreement about his rank and the regiment in which he served. A Thomas Meldrum joined the Sj&aelig;lland knight's regiment on 1 August 1627 as a private and departed from Danish&#150;Norwegian service on 12 June 1628  (Lind database). There was also a Captain Thomas Meldrum in command of a company of the Sj&aelig;lland national foot by February 1628, who departed from Danish service in June 1629  (Riis, 2.115). It is not implausible that these are the same man, given the chaotic state of the Danish army during this period.<br>
<br>In 1629 Denmark&#150;Norway signed the treaty of L&uuml;beck and withdrew from the war against the Habsburg empire. Many Scottish officers and soldiers then transferred from the army of Christian IV to serve in the Swedish army of Gustav II Adolf. It appears that Thomas Meldrum was one of these men. Certainly a Captain Thomas Meldrum fought for the Swedish army in Germany as a member of Alexander Cunningham's Scottish infantry regiment in 1632. This is the same man who re-enlisted into Danish service for their wars against Sweden between 1657 and 1660.<br>
<br>From this point on, Meldrum's military service can be traced more easily. He re-entered the Danish service from that of Brandenburg in January 1657. Meldrum initially served as a captain in the infantry regiment of the Scot Major-General John Henderson. He did not stay with the unit long, which allowed him to avoid capture when Henderson surrendered the garrison of Hindsgavl in January 1658. Meldrum temporarily became a dragoon captain in October 1657, departing from his usual capacity as an infantry officer. He later returned to foot service when he served as a captain of the students' regiment during the siege of Copenhagen in April 1658. Meldrum served as a captain in Krag's infantry regiment in 1659 and remained an infantry captain until 1663. Some time after 1670 he gained his promotion to lieutenant-colonel of infantry stationed in Copenhagen.<br>
<br>War broke out between Denmark&#150;Norway and Sweden in 1675 as the Danes sought to recover their former territories east of the Sound. The treaty of Copenhagen had ceded these to the Swedes in 1660. Meldrum took an active part in the Danish campaign and earned the titles commander and full colonel at the battle of Lund. By 1677 he was vice-commander of the newly captured Swedish town of Landskrona, and later military governor of the castle. It was from this strategic position commanded by Meldrum that Christian V conducted his devastating campaign against Swedish Sk&aring;ne. Yet despite Danish success in the campaign the French brokered the peace of Lund in 1679, which ensured that Sweden retained the former Danish provinces. Thereafter Meldrum returned to Denmark, where he remained on active military service. In 1684 he was promoted brigadier. Thomas Meldrum died with the rank of general in 1693, aged about 88. In a career which spanned nearly sixty years he had risen from a common soldier to a respected commander.<br>
