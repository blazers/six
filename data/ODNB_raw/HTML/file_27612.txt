<span class="headword">Townsend,  John</span>  (1757&#150;1826), <span class="occ">benefactor</span>, was born in Whitechapel, London, on 24 March 1757, the son of Benjamin and Margaret Townsend. His father, a pewterer, was disinherited for his attachment to the Calvinistic Methodist leader George Whitefield and, as a result, the family lived a &#145;humble life&#146;  (<span class="italic">Congregational Magazine</span>, 226). John was educated at Christ's Hospital, London, which he entered on 6 March 1766 and left on 8 April 1771 at the instruction of his father, who wished him to serve as his apprentice at Swallow Gardens, London. It was during the time of his apprenticeship that he began attending services at Tottenham Court Chapel and was drawn to preaching. After an eight-month position at Lewes, Sussex, he was ordained minister of the Independent church at Kingston, Surrey, in June 1781. He married in the same month Cordelia Carhusac; they had at least one child. Much to Townsend's disapproval members of his Kingston congregation came under the influence of William Huntington's antinomianism, forcing Townsend to resign his position. On 28 October 1784 he became minister of the newly founded Independent church in Jamaica Row, Bermondsey, and from March 1787 he also preached weekly at the Orange Street Chapel.<br>
<br>In 1792 Townsend was responsible, along with Henry Cox Mason, rector of Bermondsey, and the MP Henry Thornton, for the establishment of an asylum for deaf mute children of the poor in Bermondsey. What began as a parish institution attracted a number of subscribers and grew to become a national charity. Plans were laid for the construction on Old Kent Road of a purpose-built asylum, which was begun in July 1807, and for which Townsend, by &#145;his own individual efforts and personal applications&#146;, was able to contribute &pound;6000. In the period between the asylum's foundation and the erection of its new premises Townsend was also involved in the foundation of the <span class="italic">Evangelical Magazine</span> (1793) and the creation of the London Missionary Society (1794) and the British and Foreign Bible Society (1804), for which he provided the name. In 1807 he also helped initiate the London Female Penitentiary, which housed and rehabilitated repentant prostitutes.<br>
<br>In September 1810 Townsend published a <span class="italic">Letter to the ministers, officers, and all other members and friends of the congregational churches in England</span>, in which he drew attention to the poverty of his fellow ministers and the inadequacy of the education provided for their children. Townsend received a poor response to his appeal, raising just &pound;200 in four months. As a result he limited his plans to the building of a free school for the sons of poor Independent ministers; this opened as the Congregational school in October 1811. In 1815 the school moved to a house in Lewisham, for which Townsend helped to pay by undertaking a lecture tour of Yorkshire and Lancashire intended &#145;to excite the churches there to assist it by their patronage&#146;. As well as the <span class="italic">Letter to the Ministers</span> he also published a collection of sermons on prayer, some <span class="italic">Hints on Sunday-Schools and Itinerant Preaching</span> (1801), an abridgement of John Bunyan's <span class="italic">Pilgrim's Progress</span> (1806), and a <span class="italic">Defence of the Reformation</span> (1815). Townsend, a man of &#145;eminent philanthropy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Congregational Magazine</span>, 229), was engaged in raising funds to build an almshouse when he died in Bermondsey on 7 February 1826.<br>
