<span class="headword">Bargery,  George Percy</span>  (1876&#150;1966), <span class="occ">missionary and Hausa scholar</span>, was born on 1 October 1876 at 7 Oxford Terrace, St James Road, Exeter, the son of George Thomas Bargery, commercial traveller, and his wife, Ellen Dawes. Educated in Exeter and at the University of London, he was ordained in the Church of England in 1900, and joined the Church Missionary Society, who sent him to Northern Nigeria. His first wife, Nina (<i>d</i>. 1932), whom he married in 1906, was with him in Nigeria until 1910 when she returned to Britain. His second marriage, on 11 April 1940, to Minnie Jane Martin, a retired headmistress aged sixty-five who had worked in Nigeria, lasted until her death in 1953. He had at least one son.<br>
<br>An early uncompleted medical training stood Bargery in good stead in his daily life in Nigeria. Lord Lugard's annual report on Northern Nigeria submitted to the British government for 1905&#150;6 recognized Bargery's medical skills and his remarkable fortitude, saying of him:<blockquote>during an outbreak of sickness at Rimmo Mr Bargery saved the lives of over 80 persons, and the thanks of the Government were conveyed to this gentleman for having ridden on a bicycle 65 miles in one day to attend an officer of the West African Frontier Force. Having been overtaken by darkness, he spent the night in a tree in pouring rain. (Lugard, 469)</blockquote>Bargery's major achievement, however&#151;leading to his later appointment at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London&#151;was the compilation of a dictionary of the Hausa language. This endeavour was entrusted to him by the governor of Nigeria, Sir Hugh Clifford, and he worked on it for some five years in the company of a group of Hausa scholars in Kano led by the intrepid Malam Mahmudu Koki. First published in 1934 after fourteen years of work, the dictionary remains an astonishing achievement, with 52,000 entries complete with tone patterns and detailed commentary upon meanings, synonyms, near-synonyms, dialectal variants, and specialized usages. In addition to a team of Hausa scholars, the colonial government of Nigeria seconded a gifted and trained linguist, Captain R. C. Abraham, to assist in the project over some two years. Neither Bargery nor his Hausa colleagues were trained linguists, and it is said that Bargery asked his new assistant to go through the trays of cards that had already been prepared and check for consistency. Alarmed at the growing pile of entries being rooted out, Bargery and his Hausa colleagues resolved their dilemma by returning after the day's work had been concluded, and all had retired to their various quarters, to reinsert by candlelight the items removed  (private information).<br>
<br>After retirement from the Church Missionary Society, Bargery became a teacher and scholar of Hausa (1930&#150;47) at SOAS; he was made reader in Hausa in 1937. He was awarded the degree of DLitt at the University of London in 1937, and was made an OBE in 1957. A close colleague described Bargery as &#145;intensely practical, forthright and down-to-earth, a stickler for order and punctuality, a hater of cant and humbug and on moral issues uncompromising&#146;  (Parsons, 490). His sense of humour was &#145;immense, earthy, and sometimes bordering on the macabre&#146;  (ibid.). He was a great storyteller, every tale being relived and dramatized, &#145;and he would end up with tears of laughter streaming down his mobile face, his deep-throated chuckles reverberating around the Common Room&#146;  (ibid.).<br>
<br>In retirement from SOAS Bargery accepted an invitation from the British and Foreign Bible Society to advise on a new translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into Hausa, and from 1953 to 1959 he lived and worked in Kano, leaving at the age of eighty-two. He also continued to be a teacher and examiner of Hausa on Devonshire courses for the colonial service at Oxford and Cambridge. Progress in the service was dependent upon a growing mastery of local languages, a condition laid down by Lord Lugard in the early years of the colonial administration, and through his dictionary and other language materials, Bargery made an invaluable contribution to the efficiency of colonial administration.<br>
<br>Bargery died on 2 August 1966 at his home, Little Redlands, Cow Lane, Tring, Hertfordshire. His obituarist in the SOAS <span class="italic">Bulletin</span> praised his contribution to Hausa scholarship but also noted that he had been held in great affection by the many Nigerians who knew him:<blockquote>Bargery will be best remembered as a great lover of Nigeria, and of all peoples and things Nigerian&#151;of the Tiv as much as of the Hausa &hellip; and all its other peoples too&#151;Christian, Muslim, pagan alike. To him they were all &#145;brothers and sisters in God&#146;, and he accorded them that respect for their <i>mutunci</i> (human dignity) which so endeared him to them. (Parsons, 493)</blockquote>
