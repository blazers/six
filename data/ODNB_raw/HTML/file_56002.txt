<span class="headword">Sweeting,  Marjorie Mary</span>  (1920&#150;1994), <span class="occ">geomorphologist</span>, was born on 28 February 1920, at 24 Radipole Road, Fulham, the only child of George Scotland Sweeting, geology lecturer at Imperial College, London, and Ellen Louisa Liddiard. She attended Mayfield School, Putney, London, before taking a first in geography at Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1941. She was awarded the degree of PhD in 1948 by the University of Cambridge for a thesis entitled &#145;The landforms of the Carboniferous limestone of the Ingleborough district, N. W. Yorkshire&#146;. Between 1948 and 1951 she was a research fellow at Newnham, and in 1951 she moved to the University of Oxford bringing her expertise and enthusiasm for karst (Carboniferous limestone) studies. She remained at St Hugh's College where she was from 1951 a fellow and tutor, later dean and senior tutor, and was concurrently university lecturer in the school of geography (appointed 1953), reader (appointed 1977), and acting head of department (1983&#150;4). She retired in 1987.<br>
<br>During her research career in Oxford, Marjorie Sweeting supervised over thirty graduate students including a significant number who became the major figures in karst research. The research fields and locations of her students reflected her broad interest in limestone studies around the world: Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Canada, Belize, Australia, China, Tibet, and Borneo. These areas were, however, but a few of the karst regions of the world that she visited. Perhaps the only major limestone areas which she did not visit were those of the Arab world.<br>
<br>The characteristic which Marjorie Sweeting showed in her research career was one of utilizing technical advances made in other sciences. Never shy of adapting to the current trend, she fashioned her approach to karst studies upon a variation of field location, laboratory innovations, and funded research topics for her students. Consequently her publications, over seventy in all, spanning 1943&#150;95, including two major books (<span class="italic">Karst Landforms</span>, 1972, and <span class="italic">Karst in China: its Geomorphology and Environment</span>, 1995), represented a broad church of limestone enquiry.<br>
<br>In keeping with the academic environment of the time, Sweeting's early works concentrated upon the shape of karst landforms, upon the geological control (following the influence and co-research of her geologist father, G. S. Sweeting), and, in the early 1960s, upon landscape denudation rates. This later interest in rates of process led her to experimental studies and laboratory measurement, activities which were innovative for the scientific climate of the time. Working with rather simple equipment she succeeded in noting the importance of mineralogy in controlling weathering rates. This work brought together the field study and analysis of her research students, particularly those working in Jamaica and Puerto Rico. This early research led her to publish her most important book, <span class="italic">Karst Landforms</span>, in 1972. The book was the synthesis of her extensive travels, her own and her research students' work, and of her collaboration and discussion with most if not all of the major researchers in the field of limestone studies. The influence of French and German ideologies in her book is obvious as is her discussion with Slavonic geomorphologists. The book is a benchmark of its time, classic and informative of the prevailing morphological (as opposed to process) orientation of karst studies in the 1950s and 1960s. The lack of speleological research in the book is surprising given her interest and influence with the British Cave Research Association, with whom she caved; on the basis of those experiences she often identified cave science as a necessary facet of limestone research. Nevertheless <span class="italic">Karst Landforms</span> remains a formative text and an essential primer for any serious student of karst studies.<br>
<br>After the publication of <span class="italic">Karst Landforms</span> China opened up as an accessible region for research. Present on the first cultural visit of British scientists to China in 1975, Sweeting formed close links with the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and with the Karst Institute in Guilin where she returned more than fifteen times over the next twenty years or so.<br>
<br>The Chinese limestone regions were little visited by foreign scientists but Sweeting managed to visit all of the important regions from Guilin in the south to Hubei, Outer Mongolia in the north; from Shanghai in the east to Chengdu in the west. Eventually she studied high-mountain karst in Tibet but although she retained her desire to travel, by the 1990s she inevitably took a more passive role in field research.<br>
<br>Armed with undoubtedly the greatest experience and field knowledge of Chinese limestone regions of any researcher, Sweeting set about her last major task, a book on the karst of China. In final manuscript form, edited by her, shortly before her death, the book was published in 1995, entitled <span class="italic">Karst in China: its Geomorphology and Environment</span>. The book documents a vast range of features in the most important limestone region of the world. She recognizes in the book the importance of understanding and managing limestone regions in one of the most densely populated areas of the world.<br>
<br>Ever the diplomat, Sweeting preferred to review rather too kindly idiosyncratic views held by differing scientific communities within China. As a result, the book fails to provide the incisive commentary that only she could have brought to bear, and which she was happy to acknowledge in discussion but not prepared to publish. Notwithstanding this, the book remains the benchmark description of Chinese karst studies during the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Throughout her Chinese research, Sweeting maintained an interest in new lines of enquiry; research, by this date generally undertaken through her research students, broadened her interests into biogeomorphology (which she had highlighted as potentially important in <span class="italic">Karst Landforms</span> as early as 1972) and dating techniques.<br>
<br>Sweeting enjoyed watching sport of all kinds (and her students noted what great physical demands she made of herself in the field), opera, and entertaining, but she most enjoyed the travel and conviviality which fieldwork and conference-going brought.<br>
<br>Awarded honours from the Royal Geographical Society (notably the Busk medal in 1980) and from many foreign speleological and geomorphological societies, Sweeting was acknowledged as one of the twentieth century's most important figures in karst studies. She died on 31 December 1994 at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, after a protracted fight against cancer. She was buried at Enstone, Oxfordshire, the village where she lived, on 6 January 1995. Her estate, divided equally among St Hugh's College, Oxford, Newnham College, Cambridge, and the Royal Geographical Society, significantly increased funds available to assist travel for research purposes at each of these institutions and reveals her love of travel, her dedication to research and, in the absence of family, her loyalty to the institutions where she felt at home.<br>
