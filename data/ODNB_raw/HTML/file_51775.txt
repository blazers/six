<span class="headword">Dendy,  Mary</span>  (1855&#150;1933), <span class="occ">promoter of residential schools for mentally handicapped people</span>, was born on 28 January 1855 at Bryncelyn, Mold, Flintshire, the second child of John Dendy (1828&#150;1894), Unitarian minister, and his wife, Sarah Beard (1831&#150;1922), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1817/', "John Relly Beard")</script>. Her siblings included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37208/', "Helen Bosanquet")</script>, who worked for many years for the Charity Organization Society, and Arthur Dendy (1865&#150;1925), a biologist. Mary was educated at home in Patricroft, near Manchester, and at Bedford College, London. In 1882, having taught in the Sunday school at Monton for several years, she became a companion to Miss Sarah Ann Cawston, the adopted daughter of Samuel Courtauld, in High Garrett, near Braintree, Essex. In 1891, following Miss Cawston's death (1889), she returned to Manchester where she lived and worked until her appointment to the Board of Control in 1913.<br>
<br>Mary Dendy first became aware of what she referred to as &#145;the problem of the feeble-minded&#146; while working in the Collyhurst Recreation Rooms, founded in Manchester by her uncle James Rait Beard. After her election to the Manchester school board in 1896 she began a detailed mental and physical assessment of nearly 40,000 schoolchildren in Manchester. Her subsequent report, prepared with the help of Dr Henry Ashby, convinced the board to establish special classes and schools for mentally handicapped children in Manchester.<br>
<br>During her work for the school board (later the Manchester education committee) Mary Dendy became convinced that mentally handicapped young adults continued to pose a threat to the community after they left school. She therefore began to advocate lifelong institutional care for the mentally handicapped. In 1898 she established the Lancashire and Cheshire Society for the Permanent Care of the Feeble-Minded, to which she was secretary for many years. Utilizing the support of influential Unitarian friends and relatives, she campaigned to raise money for the society, which, in 1902, opened the Sandlebridge Boarding-Schools and Colony near Alderley Edge in Cheshire.<br>
<br>Miss Dendy travelled extensively throughout England, Scotland, and North America in order to raise public awareness of the social problems associated with the mentally handicapped and to secure financial support for Sandlebridge. Many of her public addresses were published as pamphlets or journal articles. In <span class="italic">Feeble-Minded Children</span> (1898), <span class="italic">The Importance of Permanence in the Care of the Feeble-Minded</span> (1901), <span class="italic">Feebleness of Mind, Pauperism and Crime</span> (1901), and <span class="italic">The Problem of the Feeble-Minded</span> (1910), and in articles in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> (1902) and the <span class="italic">Medical Magazine</span> (1911), she argued that &#145;feeble-mindedness&#146; was the cause of crime, poverty, and drunkenness, and that such &#145;evils&#146; would be transmitted to subsequent generations unless immediate action were taken. In an address to the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association (1911), in an appendix to Charles Paget Lapage's <span class="italic">Feeblemindedness in Children of School-Age</span> (1911), and in the <span class="italic">Journal of State Medicine</span> (1914), she outlined the nature of the work used to occupy and train residents at Sandlebridge. She also campaigned vigorously for legislation to compel education committees to provide special schools and to allow local authorities to detain the mentally handicapped beyond the age of sixteen, objectives that were realized with the passage of the <span class="roman">Mental Deficiency Act</span> in 1913 and the <span class="roman">Elementary Education Act</span> in 1914.<br>
<br>Dendy's opinions did not pass unchallenged. Some contemporary commentators disagreed with her principle of permanent segregation, and feminists were concerned that women in particular would be treated harshly under the terms of the <span class="roman">Mental Deficiency Act</span>. However, her work at Sandlebridge generally met with approval from prominent doctors, such as Alfred Tredgold, and from others working in the field, such as Ellen Pinsent. Her knowledge and expertise were acknowledged both in the report of the royal commission on the care and control of the feeble-minded, published in 1908, and in her appointment as a commissioner of the newly created Board of Control in 1913.<br>
<br>Late Victorian and Edwardian schemes to institutionalize people classified as &#145;mentally deficient&#146; have sometimes been dismissed entirely as the product of contemporary anxieties about degeneration and as manifestations of eugenic strategies to control the lower classes. While much of Mary Dendy's rhetoric was clearly influenced by eugenics, her contribution to the care of the mentally handicapped was more complex. Her writings and her work at Sandlebridge demonstrate her genuine commitment to improving the lives of children admitted to the Colony. In addition, by drawing attention to the problems associated with training people with what are now referred to as learning difficulties, she contributed to the development of the concept of &#145;special needs&#146; in education.<br>
<br>In 1910 Dendy was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Manchester in recognition of her contribution to the education of the mentally handicapped. However, her involvement in civic and philanthropic work was not restricted to the care of the mentally handicapped. During her years in Manchester she was also secretary of the South Manchester Women's Liberal Association, secretary to the Women Guardians Society, a governor of the Manchester High School for Girls, and served on the Manchester Distress Committee. Although she supported women's suffrage she was wary of militant suffragettes, and opposed the employment of married women as teachers on the grounds that the combination of home duties and work caused breakdowns in women.<br>
<br>In addition to contributing to local and national newspapers, such as the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, Dendy also published poems, stories, and novels, including <span class="italic">Lesson Stories for the Little Ones</span> (1888) and <span class="italic">Only a Business Man</span> (1910). She maintained close connections with Unitarianism throughout her life, speaking in chapels and regularly contributing to Unitarian publications, such as the <span class="italic">Sunday School Helper</span> and <span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>.<br>
<br>Mary Dendy did not marry. A bequest from Miss Cawston allowed her sufficient financial independence not only to pursue her work with the mentally handicapped but also to indulge her broader interests, such as travel and the theatre. She retired from the Board of Control in 1921, when she returned to live at Greencote, close to Sandlebridge, at Alderley Edge, Cheshire. She continued to take an active part in the Boarding-Schools and Colony until her death. Mary Dendy died at her home on 9 May 1933 and was buried on 12 May at Alderley Edge cemetery.<br>
