<span class="headword">Cooke,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1593), <span class="occ">herald</span>, was purportedly the son of a tanner. As a youth he was said to have been a member of the household of Sir Edmund Brudenell, a great collector of pedigrees. He matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1553, graduated BA in 1558, and proceeded MA in 1561. In January 1562 he was appointed Rose Blanche pursuivant, and he then became Chester herald. In May 1567 he became Clarenceux king of arms, and in that office he was an assiduous maker of visitations to register coats of arms and pedigrees in southern England, visiting his whole province at least once. Between 1584 and 1586 he was acting Garter king of arms between Sir Gilbert Dethick and his son William, and in that capacity he served on the embassy to deliver the Order of the Garter to Henri III of France. A dispute with one of the earl marshal's servants over a gratuity provides evidence that Cooke expected to succeed Sir Gilbert Dethick permanently as Garter, but despite the apparent patronage of the earl of Leicester, who also seems to have been responsible for Cooke's appointment as Chester herald, this fell through and William Dethick succeeded his father instead.<br>
<br>Cooke's tenure as Clarenceux was troubled, beginning with the orders issued in 1568 by the duke of Norfolk as earl marshal, controlling grants of arms made by the provincial kings of arms (Clarenceux and Norroy) and securing their records for the College of Arms. It culminated in a bitter dispute with the younger Dethick over the latter's attempts as Garter both to encroach on the traditional rights of the provincial kings to grant arms and to make his own visitations throughout England.<br>
<br>As a result of Dethick's attacks biographers have often discounted the accusations against Cooke in the understandable but <i>ad hominem</i> belief that Dethick is an untrustworthy witness. However, &#145;Lant's observations&#146; on the officers of arms seem to bear Dethick out, at least in part. Regarding Cooke's linguistic deficiencies, an entry in the French chancery records suggests that one of the two gold chains supposedly given to Cooke by the French king was actually intended for his interpreter, suggesting that Cooke's French was inadequate for his diplomatic duties. A more telling charge, though a common one among heralds, is that Cooke gave arms and crests &#145;without number to base and unworthy persons for his private gain only without the knowledge of the E[arle]. Marshall&#146;  (&#145;Lant's observations&#146;, fol. 68<i>v</i>). Cooke himself answered this indirectly in a treatise on granting arms by arguing that decaying nobility possibly envied men of mean birth whose virtue none the less outshone the older aristocracy's.<br>
<br>Cooke seems to have made excellent financial business out of granting arms, though he may have displeased Queen Elizabeth by making too many supposedly unworthy gentlemen: Ralph Brooke, York herald, writing to Sir Robert Cotton in 1614, says that Cooke gave more than 500 coats of arms and that both Dethicks gave more. This may be an understatement, possibly a very substantial one. Yet Dethick also claims that even with this lucrative source of income in fees, Cooke nevertheless dissipated a &pound;1000 gift from the queen.<br>
<br>&#145;Lant's observations&#146; also accuse Cooke of burying knights as if they were barons &#145;and some no Gentlemen as Esq<sup>re</sup>&#146;  (&#145;Lant's observations&#146;, fol. 68<i>v</i>). He did bury Sir Philip Sidney magnificently as a baron, but this seems justified by Sir Philip's title from the French crown. Sir William Dugdale denounced Cooke's employment of a painter&#150;stainer as the start of that profession's encroachments on the herald's prerogatives to marshal aristocratic funerals. Cooke also kept his official books as his own property, contrary to orders; it is likely, however, that like many of his colleagues, he still considered these his own papers. At his death his books, precedents, visitations, and pedigrees were bought for the College of Arms. Finally, if all this were not enough, Dethick also alleged that Cooke married another man's wife.<br>
<br>As well as heraldic compilations, visitations, precedencies, heraldry treatises, and ordinaries of arms, Cooke wrote &#145;The armorie of nobiliti&#146; on the English baronage with Robert Glover of Somerset and Thomas Lant, then Portcullis. This survives in several copies, most notably BL, Royal MS 18 C. XVII, a fine painted folio with colour portraits of each sovereign of varying accuracy: the portraits of Mary I and Elizabeth I were &#145;cutte out by reason of y<sup>e</sup> inconsiderate vnseemlynes of y<sup>e</sup> picture&#146;  (Cooke and others, &#145;The armorie of nobiliti&#146;, fols. 155<i>v</i>, 158<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>Whereas Noble praised Cooke for his diligence, later writers have been more critical. Sir Anthony Wagner condemns Cooke's pedigrees for their &#145;amateurishness&#146;, though he also notes that Cooke adopted Glover's improved pedigree form and apparently initiated the practice of making a pedigree official by having it signed by the person registering it. Whatever his failings, Cooke should not be judged wholly by the critical standards of later ages, especially as many of the charges against him stemmed from acrimony among Elizabethan heralds. He died and was buried at Hanworth in Cheshire in August 1593, leaving a daughter, Catherine, who married John Woodnote of Shavington, Cheshire.<br>
