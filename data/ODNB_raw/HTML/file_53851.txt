<span class="headword">Steiger,  Isabelle  de</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Isabelle Lace]</span>  (1836&#150;1927), <span class="occ">artist and theosophist</span>, was born at 2 Canning Street, Liverpool, on 28 February 1836, the daughter of Joshua Lace, a local solicitor. She attended Miss Hackney's day school at Liverpool and Avonbank School, Stratford upon Avon. Her early, uneventful life at Liverpool was followed by equally uneventful years spent shuttling between England and Switzerland after her marriage, in 1861, to a Swiss cotton merchant, Rudolf Adolf von Steiger von Riggesberg. For reasons of both business and health the de Steigers (as they were more usually known) moved to Egypt, where Rudolf died from tuberculosis in 1870. After returning to England in 1874 Isabelle completed her formal art-training at the Slade School and launched her career as a professional artist. In this she met with a fair degree of success: between 1879 and 1926 she exhibited at many London and provincial galleries&#151;only once at the Royal Academy, but on twenty-nine occasions at the Walker Art Gallery in her native Liverpool.<br>
<br>Madame de Steiger did not confine herself to historical and mythological oils, of which her <span class="italic">Cleopatra after the Battle of Actium</span> was the best known, but obtained commissions for floral subjects and portraits in pastels. In addition she was occasionally employed as an illustrator, although her most notable venture in this field was not a success: her frontispieces for A. E. Waite's occult journal the <span class="italic">Unknown World</span> (1894&#150;5) are remarkable only for their uninspiring subjects and insipid style. Pictorial art was not, however, the only outlet for her creativity; on her return to England she had deeply involved herself in spiritualism, and when the Theosophical Society became firmly established in the early 1880s she embraced this as well. In the course of that decade Madame de Steiger's frequent contributions to the journals of both movements brought her into contact with the proponents of less public magical and mystical traditions. She thus became one of a loosely associated group of remarkable women: H. P. Blavatsky, Mabel Collins, Anna Kingsford, and&#151;most significantly&#151;Mary Anne Atwood. Unlike the other women Mrs Atwood, who joined none of the esoteric societies of the time, represented not the modern movement but theosophy as understood by the mystic Jakob Boehme and by the early alchemists; it was to this that Isabelle de Steiger now committed herself.<br>
<br>In essence Mrs Atwood looked upon alchemy as a &#145;science of the soul&#146; which, when properly understood, would enable the adept to attain divine union by way of illumination gained in an exalted form of mesmeric trance. Her theory had been set out in 1850 in <span class="italic">A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery</span>, but this book, published anonymously, had been recalled and most copies destroyed because Mrs Atwood and her father, Thomas South, felt that the world was unready for such a revelation. Isabelle de Steiger was busily studying alchemy within the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which she had entered in 1888, taking the motto <i>Altiora peto</i> (I seek the heights). She now proved to be one of Mrs Atwood's few sympathetic hearers, and the only promoter of her views.<br>
<br>However, promoting Mrs Atwood's idea of alchemy proved to be a far from simple task and the two books Madame de Steiger devoted to it, <span class="italic">On a Gold Basis</span> (1907) and <span class="italic">Superhumanity</span> (1916), were both utter failures. She met with a similar lack of support for her ideas within the Alchemical Society, which she helped to found in 1912, and succeeded only in irritating A. E. Waite (1857&#150;1942) by accusing him of failing to retain his youthful enthusiasm for the Atwood creed. His irritation stayed with him, and when he was called on to write &#145;that silly Preface to <span class="italic">Memorabilia</span>&#146; (her posthumous memoirs, 1927), his diary records that he &#145;found it almost impossible to do these few pages because of their subject&#146;  (Gilbert, <span class="italic">Waite</span>, 152). Madame de Steiger succeeded in prodding others to better effect. When Mrs Atwood died in 1910 she persuaded William Tait, the Belfast publisher, that a new edition of the <span class="italic">Suggestive Inquiry</span> was justified. She then carried out a meticulous editing of the text but declined to write an introduction to the book, so that when it finally appeared in 1918 the praise that greeted it went to W. L. Wilmshurst, who had leaped at the task.<br>
<br>The praise Madame de Steiger did receive for her writing was accorded to her edition of an obscure but important text of the German Romantic mystic Karl von Eckartshausen. <span class="italic">The Cloud upon the Sanctuary</span> (1896) was translated and annotated by her with an introduction by her mentor in occultism, J. W. Brodie-Innes, who was also her neighbour when she lived at Edinburgh during the 1890s. In later editions (1903, 1909) he was replaced by A. E. Waite, who was much happier with Madame de Steiger's enthusiasm for the notion of a &#145;secret church&#146; (which mirrored his own ideas) than with her views on alchemy.<br>
<br>Madame de Steiger's relations with Waite were usually cordial: she had worked with him on the <span class="italic">Unknown World</span>, and when the Order of the Golden Dawn split in two, in 1903, she supported Waite's &#145;mystical&#146; faction as opposed to the &#145;magical&#146; tradition represented by Brodie-Innes. She also praised Waite in her memoirs, but she could not forgive his rejection of Mrs Atwood and in her final years she looked instead to Rudolf Steiner and his Anthroposophical Society for spiritual comfort. This was all she had, as material comfort was largely denied her following the destruction of most of her paintings in a fire at an Edinburgh furniture repository in 1900. By this time she had retired to Rockferry in Cheshire&#151;within sight of Liverpool but more genteel. There she continued both to paint and to write, but demand for her pictures matched the demand for her books and it is perhaps fitting that her last painting, which she completed shortly before her death at Rockferry on 1 January 1927, was entitled <span class="italic">Castles in the Air</span>.<br>
<br>As a painter of classical historical subjects in the style of Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, whom she consciously imitated, Isabelle de Steiger's work has long been consigned to a well-merited obscurity that is shared by her literary efforts&#151;occult works possessed of an almost uniquely impenetrable obscurity of their own. But for all the failings of her esoteric creativity, Madame de Steiger was instrumental in preserving Mrs Atwood's <span class="italic">A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery</span>. In its turn, this book, unquestionably the most remarkable alchemical text of modern times, inspired a minor masterpiece of modern fiction, Lindsay Clarke's <span class="italic">The Chymical Wedding</span> (1989).<br>
