<span class="headword">Blanche,  Ada</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Ada Cecilia Blanche Adams]</span>  (1863&#150;1953), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born at Musely House, Brixton, London, on 16 July 1863, the daughter of the rising music-hall manager Sam Adams (1837&#150;1893) of the Islington Philharmonic, and his wife, the former Mrs Sarah Ann Bellini (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Harris) (1832?&#150;1900), a well-known vocalist and actress, known professionally as Cicely Nott, who had recently played under Chatterton at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Adams, the son of a Ware-based maltster and banker, was professedly descended from Sir Thomas Adams, a seventeenth-century lord mayor of London.<br>
<br>Ada's parents had already separated (after producing five children, all of whom would make a name in the theatre) before the young girl first went on the stage in her early teens. She appeared in Chatterton's children's pantomimes at the Adelphi Theatre, in similar productions at Drury Lane and at the Imperial, and was also seen in juvenile roles in drama, often playing on the same programmes as one or both of her mother and youngest sister &#145;Little&#146; Addie Blanche. She had her first important adult role at the age of nineteen, when she briefly took over the soprano part of Fiametta, to her mother's Peronella, in Emily Soldene's touring company performance of <span class="italic">Boccaccio</span>. She left this job to fulfil the kind of substantial pantomime principal boy engagement which would be the backbone of her early career.<br>
<br>In 1883&#150;4 Blanche toured with Lila Clay's all-ladies operetta company, in 1885 with the Holmes Burlesque Company in America, and in 1886 in Britain with her mother and another sister, Edith Blanche, in Dion Boucicault's comedy <span class="italic">Forbidden Fruit</span>. In 1886 she made her first adult appearance at the mecca of modern burlesque, the Gaiety Theatre, cast (alongside Addie) in a small part in the burlesque <i>Monte Cristo jr</i>. At the Gaiety she understudied the theatre's top star, Nellie Farren, and when the burlesques were sent on the road, Ada was cast in Farren's parts. In her twenties, she spent most of her time playing burlesque around Britain, but she returned to London to succeed to the title-role in George Edwardes's production of the burlesque <span class="italic">Joan of Arc</span> and also to play both music-hall engagements and, most particularly&#151;alongside Marie Lloyd, Dan Leno, Little Tich, and other such variety stars&#151;as principal boy in the pantomimes at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. She also, apparently, though unbilled, latterly had a hand in the staging of the pantomimes, and Sir Francis Burnand reported that &#145;as a stage manager for farcical pieces with chorus and dances she ran even &#147;Charley 'Arris&#148; uncommonly hard&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Era</span>, 11 April 1908, 21).<br>
<br>The best theatre part which Ada Blanche found in her middle years was the title-role in <span class="italic">The Telephone Girl</span>, Burnand's English adaptation of the French vaudeville-operetta <span class="italic">La demoiselle du t&eacute;l&eacute;phone</span>, which she played for several seasons around Britain. However, apart from regular pantomime engagements, London offered her only a brief season in the title-role, Stella de Winton, in <span class="italic">The Royal Star</span> (1898) and an <i>in extremis</i> take-over of Ada Reeve's star role in the unsuccessful <span class="italic">The Medal and the Maid</span> (1903). She came into her West End own only in her forties when Robert Courtneidge, husband of her actress sister Rosie Nott, became prominent as a producer of musical plays. Courtneidge cast her in older comedy characters in a series of his productions, and she thus created the role of the booming, lost-husband-seeking Mrs Smith alongside the Simplicitas Smith of Dan Rolyat in the long-running <span class="italic">The Arcadians</span> (1909), the tea-house owner Mitsu, again teamed with Rolyat, in its successor, <span class="italic">The Mousm&eacute;</span> (1911), paired up with Lauri De Frece to supply the chief comedy of <span class="italic">The Pearl Girl</span> (1913) as the vulgar nouveau-riche Mrs Baxter Brown, and, in more sedate style, the senior Lady Elizabeth Weston in <span class="italic">The Rebel Maid</span> (1921).<br>
<br>Although Ada Blanche never married, each of her three sisters did. Edith married the producer of <span class="italic">Forbidden Fruit</span>, John H. Tully, Addie became Mrs William Peacock and the mother of the successful 1910s musical comedy actress Marie Blanche, while Rosie and Courtneidge were the parents of the future comedienne Dame Cicely Courtneidge. Ada spent her retirement years in Yorkshire and west London, and died at St Mary's Guest House, Burlington Lane, Chiswick, on 1 January 1953. She was buried at Nunhead cemetery.<br>
