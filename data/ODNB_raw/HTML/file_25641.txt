<span class="headword">Singer,  Samuel Weller</span>  (1783&#150;1858), <span class="occ">literary scholar</span>, born in London, was the son of Thomas Singer (<i>d</i>. 1793/4), a maker of artificial flowers and feathers, and Elizabeth Weller. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25638/', "George John Singer (1786&#150;1817)")</script>, natural philosopher and inventor, was his younger brother. His father died when Samuel was ten years old, and his mother continued the feather and flower business in Princes Street, Cavendish Square.<br>
<br>Samuel received a limited education at a day school kept by a Frenchwoman. There he learned French, but was mainly self-taught, reading widely and acquiring Italian through frequent visits to the opera. At an early age he was apprenticed to a hatter near Cavendish Square, but he soon returned to work for his mother; and about 1808 he set up for himself in the same trade in Duke Street, St James's. In the same year he married Harriet Robinson; they had a son, Alfred (1816&#150;1898), and three daughters.<br>
<br>Singer's growing absorption in literature soon prompted him to change his profession and open a bookseller's shop in St James's Street. Book collectors such as Richard Heber, Richard Grenville, and Francis Douce were among his customers, and Douce became a lifelong friend. A tenacious autodidact, Singer quickly began to develop the skills of a literary editor, and in 1811 he prepared for private circulation a limited-edition reprint of F&eacute;nelon's <span class="italic">Deux dialogues sur la peinture</span>, with a preface in French. There followed similar editions of works in both French and Italian.<br>
<br>In 1812 Singer entered into literary controversy for the first time by printing for private distribution fifty copies of <span class="italic">Some account of the book printed at Oxford in <span class="smallcap">MCCCCLXVIII</span> under the title &#145;Exposicio sancti Jeronimi in simbolo apostolorum&#146;</span>. Singer's argument in this work, that Rufinus's Latin treatise on the apostles' creed was published in 1468 rather than 1478, promised to have important implications for the history of printing in England. It was, however, wholly mistaken, and the author subsequently attempted to recall as many copies as he could  (Madan, 22&#150;3). He later made a frank admission of his error in a letter published in Sotheby's <span class="italic">Principia typographica</span> (3.19).<br>
<br>In 1815 Singer abandoned his bookseller's shop and embarked on a fully-fledged literary career. Retiring from London, he settled first at Bushey, Hertfordshire, and afterwards at Box Hall, Hertfordshire  (BM Add. MS 28654, fols. 135&#150;7). In 1816 he produced his best-known original composition, <span class="italic">Some researches into the history of playing cards: with illustrations of the origin of printing and engraving on wood</span> (250 copies). This lavishly illustrated work won high praise from Thomas Dibdin, the bibliographer and antiquary  (Allibone, <span class="italic">Dict.</span>, 2.2113). About this time Singer first gained employment as a literary editor from Robert Triphook, an antiquarian publisher whose shop was close to Singer's old establishment in St James's Street. Triphook introduced him to Charles Whittingham, proprietor of the Chiswick Press, in 1814, with the result that Singer secured from Whittingham the editorship of a series entitled <span class="roman">Early English Poets</span>: it included Marlowe and Chapman's <span class="italic">Hero and Leander</span> (1821), and Lodge's <span class="italic">Glaucus and Silla</span> (1819), as well as works by Chalkhill, Marmion, and Lovelace. Among other editorial projects Singer prepared the first complete edition of Cavendish's <span class="italic">Life of Wolsey</span> (2 vols., 1825&#150;7); the first edition of Philip Sidney's paraphrase of the <span class="roman">Psalms</span> (1828); the first full transcript of the <span class="italic">Anecdotes</span> of Joseph Spence (1820, 1859); and the correspondence and diaries of Henry Hyde, earl of Clarendon, and Lawrence Hyde, earl of Rochester (1828), collated from the manuscripts of his friend William Upcott.<br>
<br>Singer's burgeoning reputation as an Elizabethan scholar was consolidated in 1826, when he prepared a ten-volume edition of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Dramatic Works</span> for the Chiswick Press. Singer was responsible for the collation and annotation of the text, while Charles Symmons provided a biographical introduction. The work was illustrated with wood-engravings after the designs of Stothard and others, and went through a further two English editions (1856, 1875), as well as an American edition (1834), which proved particularly successful.<br>
<br>Meanwhile Singer had extended his linguistic studies to Old English and Norman-French, and began the compilation of an Old English dictionary. He abandoned the project on learning that Joseph Bosworth was engaged on a similar undertaking, but turned his researches to some use in his critical <span class="italic">Remarks on the Glossary <span class="roman">(by Sir Frederic Madden)</span> of Havelock the Dane</span> (1829), to which Madden replied. He also printed, with an English translation, <span class="italic">The Departing Soul's Address to the Body</span>, a semi-Saxon poetic fragment (1845, 100 copies).<br>
<br>Singer was elected FSA in 1825, but in 1827 his literary activities were checked by his acceptance of the office of librarian to the Royal Institution in Albemarle Street, which he retained until 1835. In 1834 his friend Francis Douce died and, to Singer's surprise, left him a competency. Relieved of the necessity of earning a livelihood, Singer finally retired in 1835 to Mickleham, near Dorking, Surrey, and devoted the rest of his life to leisurely study. He edited Herrick's <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> (1846), Bacon's <span class="italic">Essays</span> (1856), and Selden's <span class="italic">Table Talk</span> (1847); and translated Luther's <span class="italic">Einf&auml;ltige Weise zu beten</span> (as <span class="italic">Way to Prayer</span>, 1846), and in 1847 (with original additions) Depping and Michel's <span class="italic">Veland le Forgeron: dissertation sur une tradition du moyen &acirc;ge</span> (as <span class="italic">Waylard Smith</span>).<br>
<br>While Singer was remembered by contemporaries as both amiable and modest, his rivalry with the well-known Shakespeare scholar John Payne Collier led him late in his life into bitter controversy over the notorious &#145;Perkins folio&#146;, on which Collier based his <span class="italic">Notes and Emendations to the Text of Shakespeare's Plays from Early Manuscript Corrections</span> (1853). A courteous exchange between the two in <span class="italic">Notes and Queries</span> was followed by Singer's vituperative <span class="italic">Text of Shakespeare Vindicated</span> (1853), a work which stopped just short of accusing Collier of forgery and which shocked reviewers (Ganzel, 163&#150;4; <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 28 May 1853). He nevertheless retained his reputation as an unassuming, yet shrewd and incisive student of Elizabethan literature.<br>
<br>Singer died suddenly at his residence, Manor Place, Wandsworth Road, Mickleham, on 20 December 1858, and was buried at Mickleham. His library, which included many valuable Italian books, was sold by auction in 1860, along with his small collection of manuscripts, consisting chiefly of the papers of Joseph Spence  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 2nd ser., 4.120).<br>
