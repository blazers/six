<span class="headword">Wakeman, Sir  George</span>, baronet  (<em>b. </em>1627), <span class="occ">physician</span>, the son of Edward Wakeman (1592&#150;1659), barrister, of Beckford, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1676), daughter of Richard Cotton of Warblington, Sussex, was born in Hampshire on 20 October 1627. He had at least five brothers and an unknown number of sisters. Wakeman belonged to a Roman Catholic family and was educated at home before being sent in 1642 to the English Jesuit school at St Omer in Spanish Flanders. After five years of studying rhetoric at St Omer, Wakeman, together with his brother Edward, entered the English College at Rome, where he remained until 1650. On joining the college, he claimed he was the son of &#145;noble Catholic Parents, impoverished by the evilness of the times and of the soldiery&#146;  (Kenny). He was at this time undecided about his career. On leaving Rome he went to Padua, and from there may have gone to Paris to study medicine. On his return to England about 1658 he became involved in a plot against the protector, and was imprisoned until the eve of the Restoration. In 1661 Wakeman was created a baronet by Charles II, though it seems that the patent was never sealed.<br>
<br>The first trace of Wakeman's professional activity is in August 1668, when he appears to have been attending Sir Joseph Williamson. He seems to have owed his appointment some two years later as physician-in-ordinary to Catherine of Braganza mainly to the fact that he enjoyed the best repute of any Roman Catholic physician in England. In their perjured <span class="italic">Narrative</span> of the Popish Plot of 1678 Titus Oates and Israel Tonge declared that Wakeman had been offered &pound;10,000 to poison Charles II. It was pointed out that he could easily effect this through the agency of the queen. Wakeman, however, obstinately refused the task, and held out until &pound;15,000 was offered. The temptation then, according to the <span class="italic">Narrative</span>, proved too strong; he attended the Jesuit consult on 30 August 1678, received a large sum of money on account; and, with the promise of the further reward of a post as physician-general in the army, he agreed to poison the king. Wakeman was a man of high reputation, and from the first the charge against him was repugnant to many. John Evelyn wrote in his diary that he was &#145;well acquainted&#146; with the physician and took &#145;him to be a worthy gentleman abhorring such a fact&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary of John Evelyn</span>, 2.351). The government, too, was reluctant to allow any steps to be taken against him. But after their successes in the trials of the early part of 1679, the whig leaders were eager to continue the pursuit of the &#145;plotters&#146;, knowing that a successful prosecution of Wakeman would almost certainly incriminate the queen. The government was forced to yield to the pressure. Both parties felt that the trial would be a test one, and it proved to be a turning point in the Popish Plot episode.<br>
<br>Wakeman was indicted for high treason at the Old Bailey on 18 July 1679, the case being tried by Lord Chief Justice Scroggs. With Wakeman were arraigned three Benedictine monks, William Marshal, William Rumley, and James Corker. The chief witnesses for the prosecution were William Bedloe and Oates. The latter swore he had seen the paper appointing Wakeman to be physician-general and also his receipt for &pound;5000 (on account of the &pound;15,000), though it was elicited from Oates in the course of the proceedings that he was incapable at the time in question of identifying either Wakeman's person or his handwriting. Wakeman objected that Oates's accusation was based entirely on hearsay, and brought evidence to prove that incriminating documents produced in the case were forgeries. He pointed out the absurdity that a man in his position would take into his confidence a person such as Bedloe, who swore that Wakeman had been on intimate terms with him. He also drew attention to his family's loyalty to the crown. Not only had he himself been imprisoned because he was &#145;suspected to be a favorer of the Royal Party&#146; and had &#145;conspired with Captain Lucy and several others to attempt something for his majesties Restauration&#146; but his brother Richard had raised a troop of cavalry for the king and his father &#145;hath suffer'd very much to the value of Eighteen thousand Pounds and more for the Royal Family&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tryals</span>, 60). Scroggs commented severely on the character of the evidence, and the jury, after asking if they might find the prisoners guilty of misprision of treason, and being told they could not, found all the prisoners not guilty.<br>
<br>Charles II is said to have wept with joy at the outcome  (Hutton, 378), which caused a good deal of surprise, not least because it was the first acquittal of any of those tried for their involvement in the &#145;plot&#146;. Narcissus Luttrell wrote of the judge's conduct of the trial that it was &#145;worth takeing notice off and compareing the tryalls of Mr. Coleman and this about sir George Wakeman together, and you will find the lord chief justice Scrogs to be infinitely chang'd from what he was in Colemans tryall, even in the same things&#146;  (Luttrell, 1.18). The effect of the acquittal was considerable in dealing a direct blow at the &#145;plot&#146; and the credibility of its sponsors, and at the same time it freed the queen from suspicion. On the day following the trial the Portuguese ambassador called and thanked Scroggs.<br>
<br>A few days later, Wakeman went to Windsor to see the king and queen, and soon after left for Brussels. The verdict was supported in a pamphlet of <span class="italic">Some Observations upon the Late Tryals by Tom Ticklefoot</span> (1679); but this was answered in a similar production, entitled <span class="italic">The Tickler Tickled</span> (1679), and there is little doubt that the verdict was unpopular. It was openly said that Scroggs had been bribed, while Bedloe and Oates complained bitterly of the treatment they had received in the summing-up. Scroggs was ridiculed in <span class="italic">A Letter from Paris from Sir George Wakeman to his Friend Sir W. S.</span> (1681). The jury was termed an &#145;ungodly&#146; one, and the people, said Luttrell, &#145;murmur very much&#146;. It is noteworthy that in the course of evidence given at subsequent trials, Oates entirely ignored the verdict, and continued to speak of the bribe offered to and accepted by Wakeman.<br>
<br>Wakeman was back in London before 1685, when he was seen by Evelyn at Lady Tuke's; and he had the satisfaction of giving evidence against Titus Oates on 8 May 1685, on the occasion of his first trial for perjury. Nothing is known of his further career.<br>
