<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Spode,  Josiah</span>  (1755&#150;1827), <span class="occ">potter and merchant</span>, was born on 8 May 1755 at Stoke-on-Trent, the son of Josiah Spode (1733&#150;1797), founder of the Spode pottery factory there, and Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Finley (1726&#150;1802). He was trained in the art of ceramic manufacture by his father and entered the family firm. On 9 July 1775 he married Elizabeth Barker (<i>d</i>. 1782) of Lane Delph, daughter of the potter Thomas Barker. They had five children: William (1776&#150;1834), Josiah (1777&#150;1829), Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. 1778, <i>d</i>. after 1835), Saba (1780&#150;1811), and Mary (<i>b</i>. 1781, <i>d</i>. after 1834). Both William and Josiah were to become involved in their father's trade.<br>
<br>In 1778 a London outlet was decided on as the most profitable manner of retailing to the fashionable and lucrative metropolitan market. In that year Spode became a freeman of the City and a member of the Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers, there being no company of potters or pot sellers. A retail outlet was established in 1778 at 29 Fore Street. Business flourished and the firm moved to successively larger establishments at 46 then 45 Fore Street before settling, in 1794, at 5 Portugal Street, a better address adjacent to Lincoln's Inn Fields. Domestic residences accompanied the premises. These premises were rented, but in 1802 Spode bought the Portugal Street warehouse and the adjoining domestic residence. Such expansion was in response to the firm's growing success and in readiness to market the new bone china his father was producing. The Portugal Street establishment provided the wares for both the London retail market and international trade. The success of the bone china, called Stoke China, can be accredited to Spode's marketing prowess. A shrewd businessman, he was able to capitalize on the demands of fashionable London society. It has been suggested that without his retail ability bone china may not have reached such levels of popularity. The recent reductions in the tax payable upon imported tea also served to widen the demand for tea wares.<br>
<br>While living in London, Spode maintained his links with Stoke. In 1790 he took a lead role in the formation of the Fenton Park colliery which was the first joint potters' coal company. On the death of his father he returned to Stoke and lived in Fenton Hall. By 1803 he had acquired a 17 acre site in Penkhull on which to build his own mansion, The Mount, half a mile from the Stoke potworks. It was a suitably grand home for a man of his standing and wealth, with extensive grounds that had been enlarged by the time of his death. He also built many houses for his workforce in the vicinity of the large factory works. The London business, while remaining in the name of Spode, was in 1805 put into the charge of a partnership between Spode's son William and William Copeland (1765&#150;1826), who had joined the London firm in 1784. The partnership was dissolved on 31 December 1811 when William Spode retired. Copeland and Spode went into partnership, with Copeland possessing three of the four shares. In 1824 Copeland's son William Taylor Copeland (1797&#150;1868) was admitted to the partnership with his father giving him one of his shares. Following the death of his father, William Taylor Copeland entered into an equal partnership with Spode, each possessing two shares, to run for seven years, and he succeeded Spode as the owner of the firm in 1833.<br>
<br>Spode's own achievements were as a merchant and in the consolidation of the success of his father to whom is given the credit for the perfection of underglaze transfer-printing on earthenware in blue in 1784 and the development of bone china. Blue printed earthenware, designed to meet the demand for painted blue and white Chinese porcelain, was a highly popular product, perhaps the most famous pattern being the willow design of about 1790, itself a derivative of Chinese scenes. Spode introduced bone china about 1798. It proved popular and successful for the production of dinner ware. It was an elegant white body, translucent yet strong. From 1800 until 1822 Henry Daniel was in charge of Spode's enamelling studio, producing finely designed and painted scenes, often with exquisite gilding. Spode achieved a great accolade in 1806 following a visit by the prince of Wales when he was allowed to title himself &#145;Potter and English Porcelain Manufacturer to H.R.H. Prince of Wales&#146;. In 1813 Spode adopted the body called by him &#145;Stone China&#146;, which he matched with elaborate Chinese porcelain designs. This was a superior formula to earthenware, proving a stronger body, and its decorations required several firings. Spode was also committed to the technical side of the business, promoting the continued use of steam engines and a partnership with other potters for the lease, in 1799, of the Carloggas china clay and stone pit in Cornwall, thereby securing the supply of essential raw materials. The Spode family is perhaps second only to the elder Josiah Wedgwood in English ceramic history. The introduction of bone china and the popular success of transfer-printed earthenware helped to expand and develop the pottery industry in the Staffordshire Potteries into one of world renown. Josiah Spode died on 16 July 1827 in Stoke-on-Trent and was buried in the churchyard of St Peter ad Vincula there. He was perhaps the most successful bone china manufacturer of the early nineteenth century.<br>
