<span class="headword">Robert fitz Haimon</span> <span class="st"> [Robert FitzHaimon, Robert fitz Hamo]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1107), <span class="occ">magnate and soldier</span>, was the son of Haimo, steward of William I and William II and sheriff of Kent. Robert was a grandson of Haimo Dentatus (as Denzs), lord of Torigny, Creully, and &Eacute;vrecy, who was killed at the battle of Val-&egrave;s-Dunes in Normandy in 1047. Haimo the steward may well have come to England in the train of Odo, bishop of Bayeux, of whom he held the Norman honour of &Eacute;vrecy. Haimo became sheriff of Kent and a minor tenant-in-chief in that county, over which Odo had been granted the rights of an earl. He had at least two sons, Robert, who was probably the eldest as he inherited the Norman estates, and Haimo, who succeeded to his father's lands and office in England.<h2>
<a name="CareerinWilliamRufussreign"></a>Career in William Rufus's reign</h2>A man named Robert FitzHaimon occurs as a witness to a charter of King William of 1074. It is not certain that this figure is identifiable with Robert fitz Haimon (<i>d</i>. 1107), nor has it been possible to trace an earlier reference in a Bayeux charter mentioned by G. T. Clark  (&#145;Land of Morgan&#146;, 2) and cited in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. The first clear reference to Robert fitz Haimon (<i>d</i>. 1107) occurs in 1088 as one of the barons loyal to William Rufus when a coalition of magnates, headed by Odo of Bayeux, sought to advance the claim of Robert Curthose, duke of Normandy, to succeed to the whole inheritance of William the Conqueror. Odo held Rochester against the king, and after the revolt Robert, with Henry de Beaumont, is mentioned as having persuaded Gundulf, bishop of Rochester, to build a stone castle (one of the earliest in England) for the king at Rochester. Robert's loyalty during the revolt was soon rewarded by the grant of the lands that had been Queen Matilda's in England, despite the fact that the king's brother, Henry, had petitioned for them. Henry might reasonably have expected to receive them, but the king had other plans. In addition Robert was granted estates in the south-west and in Buckinghamshire forfeited by Geoffrey, bishop of Coutances, one of the rebels of 1088. Robert's marriage to Sibyl, a daughter of Roger de Montgomery, was a step that allied him with the lord of Shropshire and with the most powerful family in late eleventh-century England. It has also been suggested  (Keats-Rohan, 27) that at about this time he recovered the lordship of Creully, which his grandfather had possibly lost in 1047.<h2>
<a name="RoleintheconquestofGlamorgan"></a>Role in the conquest of Glamorgan</h2>It is for his role in the conquest of Glamorgan that Robert is chiefly remembered. Soon after 1066 the Normans had moved across the Welsh border and, under William fitz Osbern, had established bridgeheads in south-east Wales. William the Conqueror travelled to Wales in 1081, and is said to have ordered the building of a castle at Cardiff in the kingdom of Morgannwg. The discovery there of coins of the Conqueror has led to debate whether an Anglo-Norman colony was established at this time, possibly even with a local mint; but the evidence is inconclusive. If a start was made on the conquest under William the Conqueror, the breakthrough nevertheless occurred during his son's reign, and was spearheaded by Robert fitz Haimon.<br>
<br>Information about the conquest is supplied by accounts composed by sixteenth-century antiquarians, Edward Stradling, Humphrey Llwyd, and David Powel, in which history, legend, and family pride are intermingled. Robert was said to have been invited to assist a man named Einion, possibly a son of Cedifor ap Gollwyn. The latter was in alliance with Iestyn ap Gwrgant against Rhys ap Tewdwr, a native Welsh leader in south Wales. From the standpoint of the Normans there was the prospect of gains in Wales. By endowing Robert with rich estates in Gloucestershire, including the port of Bristol, William Rufus had given his friend the resources of men and money for further conquests. According to Stradling, Robert and his forces arrived by water, presumably via the Bristol Channel. Their initial intervention was successful, and they were on the point of departure but returned, either because they were summoned by Einion, who according to Llwyd had failed to secure the hand of Iestyn's daughter in marriage, or, according to Stradling, because Robert did not receive the payment in gold he had been promised. When the Normans returned, however, they began to take lands for themselves.<br>
<br>The date of Robert's initial arrival in Morgannwg cannot be established precisely. William Rufus was preoccupied with suppressing the baronial revolt in 1088, and arguably would have not have had time to turn his attention to Wales at least until the following year. It may even have been the case that Robert's intervention in Glamorgan did not occur until 1093 when a more general Norman advance into Wales occurred after the death of Rhys ap Tewdwr, with advances into Brycheiniog, Ceredigion, and Dyfed.<br>
<br>It is likely that Robert remained only long enough to parcel out territories for his followers, to order the building of castles at key points, and to make donations from his new lands to the church. Here a mixture of piety and more mundane considerations intermingled. The church in south Wales was conservative by Norman standards, without clearly defined territorial dioceses, and as yet untouched by contemporary movements for reform. By giving Welsh monasteries to English houses, the Normans could strengthen their own authority in Wales and at the same time make pious benefactions. Robert was particularly generous to Gloucester Abbey which, under Abbot Serlo, was rapidly expanding its numbers and attracted several donations in the 1090s from members of Rufus's court. Robert gave to Gloucester the church of St Cadog, Llancarfan, and land at Penhow, probably in the closing years of the eleventh century and before he had decided to turn his attention to Tewkesbury. The broad outlines of the later lordship of Glamorgan may have begun to take shape under Robert. The original limits of his power seem to have been the region between the rivers Rhymni and Ogwr, and a start may have been made in establishing other lordships in the south, along the low-lying lands, while the Welsh retained the uplands.<h2>
<a name="ServicetoRufusandHenryI"></a>Service to Rufus and Henry I</h2>Robert was one of William Rufus's closest friends, and his frequent presence at court is attested in the witness lists of royal documents. The suggestion has even been mooted that the two were lovers  (Barlow, 436), though there is no evidence of this. Robert was a member of the hunting party in the New Forest in August 1100 when Rufus was killed, and, according to one source, was warned by a monk of an ominous dream, which Robert duly reported to the king. The chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, writing in the 1130s, added details about Robert's grief at the king's death, and noted that his new cloak was placed on the bier that conveyed Rufus's body to burial in Winchester Cathedral  (<span class="italic">L'estoire des Engleis</span>, lines 6351&#150;5, 6388&#150;92).<br>
<br>Robert immediately entered the service of Henry I, and occurs as a witness to the charter of liberties, which the latter issued on 5 August 1100. Both he and his brother were witnesses to the letter that the new king sent to Archbishop Anselm, then in exile, to beg him to return to England. Henry I took advantage of his brother's death to seize the English throne while the eldest brother, Robert Curthose, was still absent on crusade. It soon became obvious that a rebel coalition, partly composed of those who had adhered to Curthose in 1088, was forming once again. At this critical juncture Robert fitz Haimon was mentioned as one of the few barons to remain loyal to the king, and when Curthose landed at Portsmouth in Hampshire in 1101 Robert acted as an intermediary.<br>
<br>Robert occurs frequently in the witness lists of documents issued in the early years of Henry's reign. In 1105 he was serving with the king's military household in Normandy, when he was surprised by Duke Robert's troops from Bayeux and had to take refuge in the tower of the church at Secqueville-en-Bessin. When the church was set on fire, Robert fitz Haimon was captured and taken as a prisoner to Bayeux. Here he was threatened by the local people because of his disloyalty to Duke Robert, and Henry, hearing of the plight of one of his key men, landed in Normandy and besieged Bayeux. Gontier d'Aulnay, governor of Bayeux, handed his captive over in the hope of winning Henry's favour, but refused to surrender the city. Henry thereupon set fire to it, and in the conflagration the cathedral was destroyed.<br>
<br>Robert was afterwards involved in a conspiracy whereby some citizens of Caen were prepared to hand the city over to Henry. Robert then served at the siege of Falaise where he received a wound that caused him to lose his senses, though he did not die until March 1107. According to William of Malmesbury there were those who believed that the wound was a punishment for the firing of Bayeux  (Malmesbury, 2.475). It was suggested much later that such odium attached to Robert's name in consequence of the devastation of Bayeux, that it accounted in part for the resistance to the appointment as bishop of Bayeux of his son-in-law's illegitimate son. Robert may have received medical care from the renowned physician Faricius, abbot of Abingdon, for he made a gift of land to that house not long before his death. He was buried in the chapter house of Tewkesbury Abbey, and in 1241 his body was transferred to the church. Later a stone chapel, which still survives, was built over the founder's tomb.<h2>
<a name="Religiousbenefactionscharacterandchildren"></a>Religious benefactions, character, and children</h2>Other than Gloucester, Tewkesbury Abbey was the chief focus of Robert's religious benefactions. Originally Tewkesbury had been a cell of Cranborne Abbey in Dorset, but at some point Robert decided to establish an abbey there, and in 1102 the community transferred to the new church that was being built on the banks of the River Severn. The first abbot was Gerald, a chaplain of Earl Hugh of Chester. William of Malmesbury praised the new church and the charity of the monks. The abbey again received endowments from Robert's estates in Wales, including the parish church of St Mary, Cardiff, the chapel of Cardiff Castle, the church of Llantwit, and the tithes of Cardiff and his lands in Wales.<br>
<br>No contemporary details survive about Robert's appearance or personality, but he was clearly highly regarded by both Rufus and Henry I. He was frequently at court in both reigns, and his death was much regretted by King Henry. Robert and Sibyl had no sons, but according to the tradition preserved at Tewkesbury, four daughters. One daughter, Mabel, also called Matilda (by Orderic Vitalis) and Sibyl (wrongly, by Robert de Torigni) became sole heir, and married Robert, earl of Gloucester, the eldest illegitimate son of Henry I. Two sisters entered the religious life: Cecily became abbess of Shaftesbury, Hawise abbess of Winchester. An unnamed daughter, possibly one of these two, became a nun at Malling, for the king confirmed the land that had been granted to the nuns by her father. A fourth sister was said to have been Amice, who married a count of Brittany, but of her no trace has been found.<br>
