<span class="headword">Bovenschen, Sir  Frederick Carl</span>  (1884&#150;1977), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, was born on 26 March 1884 in Forest Hill, London, he and his older sister being the only children of Carl Bovenschen, silk merchant, of Forest Hill, and his wife, Catherine Hoare. As a scholar of the King's School, Canterbury, his record in work and games was outstanding. He won an open classical scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and obtained first classes in both classical honour moderations (1905) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1907).<br>
<br>Bovenschen's initial appointment to the civil service, in March 1908, was as a clerk of the higher division in the War Office, and he remained in that department until his retirement in 1945. In November 1908 he became assistant private secretary to R. B. Haldane, secretary of state for war, whose timely reforms gave the army the strong and elastic structure that stood up to such stern tests in 1914. Four years in Haldane's office gave Bovenschen incomparable opportunities to grasp facts and principles fundamental to military organization. His next three years (1912&#150;15) as private secretary to Sir Charles Harris, whose expertise in the scrutiny of army votes was famous, gave him parallel experience of finance in peace and war. He married on 1 February 1919 Mabel Alice (1891&#150;1975), only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30327/', "Sir Arthur Herbert Dyke Acland, thirteenth baronet")</script>; they had one daughter. In 1921 he became assistant secretary at the War Office, and in 1931 he was seconded to the government of India to serve on the army retrenchment committee.<br>
<br>Bovenschen had two conspicuous traits: persistent integrity of purpose and painstaking mastery of detail. These dominated his working life for half a century. They were subtly suggested by the strokes of his round, deliberate handwriting and by an occasional quizzical glance above half-moons of gold-rimmed spectacles. These traits together helped to get value for money&#151;sometimes, in the eyes of his military colleagues, with unjustifiable severity&#151;in many aspects of army expenditure for a decade after 1932. He was successively director of army contracts, from 1932; director of finance, from 1936; and finally deputy under-secretary of state for war, from 1936 to 1942. His integrity and conscientiousness combined more conspicuously, and with more unconditional appreciation, during the Second World War when he was charged with building, from inevitably ill-assorted pieces, a strong framework for the administration of occupied enemy territory. This was done through military government and civil affairs staffs set up under Anglo-American co-operation. The completion of this huge, unprecedented task in Europe owed more to Bovenschen than to anyone. From 1942 to 1945, as joint permanent under-secretary of state for war, he chaired the main committees concerned, reconciling conflicting interests of Whitehall departments and within the armed services. It fell to him to force awkward decisions affecting supplies, to enlist American co-operation (he twice visited Washington), and to apply, with the continuity essential in exasperatingly confused conditions, intellectual objectivity and powers of persuasion. It is widely accepted that shortcomings in military government, especially in the control commission for Germany, resulted not from the organization agreed on Bovenschen's committees but primarily from mistakes in staffing.<br>
<br>Retirement from the civil service in 1945 restricted the scope more than the quality of Bovenschen's work. Its benefits to Westminster Hospital and Kent county and Hythe borough councils covered the years until 1960, during which his broadly based if at times over-rigid financial judgement was applied on their governing bodies or main committees. It was also applied in less formal discussions in which, as throughout his public life, he never became heated, endearing himself to a new assortment of colleagues by a characteristic combination of charm and shrewdness.<br>
<br>Bovenschen was a dedicated and good-humoured golfer. On four or five of his favourite Kent courses his small, compact figure would, according to an admirer, &#145;lead the field like a light infantryman at a good 140 paces to the minute&#146;. He had also enjoyed a slower pace&#151;walking in the queen's coronation procession in his robes as a baron of the Cinque Ports (1953).<br>
<br>Among the pleasures of his eighties were a return to reading classical Greek, and practical interests in education which saw him involved in the managing committees of two schools for young children in Hythe, as well as a long-established role as a governor of the King's School, Canterbury. And there were richer rewards in the happiness of his home life. His wife had studied painting under Walter Sickert and her gentle, artistic temperament complemented her husband's punctilious devotion to duty. He seemed lost when she died in 1975. A solace in the last year of his life was the return of their only child and her husband from South Africa to settle in Hythe, where Bovenschen died on 9 November 1977.<br>
<br>Bovenschen was appointed chevalier of the L&eacute;gion d'honneur (1920), CB (1927), KBE (1938), and KCB (1943).<br>
