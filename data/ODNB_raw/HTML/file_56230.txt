<span class="headword">Moyes <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fraser]</span>,  Helen Miller</span>  (1881&#150;1979), <span class="occ">women's activist</span>, was born on 14 September 1881 at 1 Grosvenor Crescent, Leeds, one of ten children of James Fraser and his wife, Christiana Sutherland. Her parents were both Scottish. Her father went from Caithness to Edinburgh as a tailor's cutter, then to Leeds, and finally, when Helen was still a child, to Glasgow, where he established a wholesale clothing firm. (According to an account given by Helen in 1908 she took a studio in Glasgow where she painted and did embroidery, but neither in her autobiography nor when interviewed in 1975 did she even hint at such leanings.) Helen grew up in a lively family, with progressive, supportive parents, who strongly believed in improving conditions for workers. As described by her in 1975, her early life was that of a typical middle-class young woman, going to balls and dances, playing tennis, performing in amateur theatricals, collecting for charity, and visiting families in the poorer districts of the city.<br>
<br>Helen Fraser's life was transformed in 1906 when she heard Teresa Billington (subsequently Billington-Greig), one of the early supporters of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), speak about the burning need for women to get the vote. From that day until 1914 Helen's whole life revolved around the women's suffrage movement. She became the first Scottish WSPU organizer and was also among the earliest suffragettes to be imprisoned for attempting to enter the House of Commons. In 1908, however, when the first stones were thrown, she was horrified at the advent of violence and resigned from the WSPU. She was invited to work for the non-militant National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), under the leadership of Millicent Garrett Fawcett, and in 1910 she was instrumental in setting up the North of Scotland Federation of Women's Suffrage Societies. Much later she recalled that her best audiences were in Aberdeen, as they really appreciated a well-argued, logical speech. Subsequently she worked as an organizer in London and other parts of England and also helped to build up branches in south Wales. In England she became known as &#145;the chieftainess because of her fine presence and air of command&#146;  (Mitchell, 164).<br>
<br>After war broke out in 1914 Helen Fraser was recruited by the government, in the first instance to organize patrols to watch girls near training camps and subsequently to organize an area in the south-west for the National War Savings Committee. She insisted on being paid the same rate as a man. During that period she was also lent to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to make speeches urging women to go and work on the land, and, before rationing, to the Ministry of Food to urge voluntary rationing before it was imposed. In 1917 she was sent on a propaganda tour of America, which was a great success. She &#145;went to over forty States, spoke 232 times in 228 days&#146;  (Moyes, 48). After a brief visit to France, so that she could describe what she had seen at first hand, she went back to the USA for a second tour.<br>
<br>After the war Helen was employed as a commissioner for National Savings, resigning in 1922 to stand as the Liberal candidate for Govan, the first woman to be adopted as an official candidate in Scotland. She was aware that Govan was a safe Labour seat, but she enjoyed electioneering enough to stand a second time, in 1923, for the Hamilton division in Lanarkshire. On that occasion, however, abuse and calumny by the Labour Party candidate made the experience a thoroughly unpleasant one. Her last political invitation was to fight Kelvingrove in Glasgow, but the Conservative candidate was a friend, and she knew that she would poll enough votes to cause him to lose his seat, so she refused and gave up the idea of a career in politics.<br>
<br>Helen then moved to London, earning money from freelance articles on women's issues, and sat on Kensington council for seven years. During that period she was a delegate to all the major international women's conferences.<br>
<br>Helen Fraser called herself a <i>profound</i> Christian, believing in mystical, visionary teachings. She was convinced that her not having married was &#145;meant&#146; because she was free to move into international work. But meanwhile she kept in touch with an old friend named Moyes who had married and gone to Australia, where one of Helen's brothers was also living. Moyes's wife died, and he proposed to her on numerous occasions before she finally agreed and emigrated to Australia in 1938.<br>
<br>As Helen Moyes she wrote an autobiography, published in Australia in 1971, entitled <span class="italic">A Woman in a Man's World</span>. She continued lecturing on feminist subjects and was one of the surviving suffragettes and suffragists interviewed by Brian Harrison in August and September 1975. She died on 2 December 1979.<br>
