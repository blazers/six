<span class="headword">Cochrane,  William</span>, first earl of Dundonald  (1605&#150;1685), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was the second son of Alexander Blair (<i>d</i>. 1640/41) of Blair, Ayrshire, who assumed the name Cochrane on his marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of William Cochrane of Cochrane, Renfrewshire, and his wife, Elizabeth. He was educated first at Paisley grammar school, and then at Glasgow University, where he was laureated in 1626, and where he later founded the Dundonald bursaries. In 1632 he was appointed sheriff-depute of Renfrewshire. Some time before 1634 he married Euphame 
    (Eupheme; <i>d</i>. after 1685)
  , daughter of Sir William Scott of Ardross and Elie, Fife, director of the court of chancery. Cochrane acquired a substantial landed estate in the shire, including the lands of Dundonald, obtained in 1638. His father had purchased the barony of Cowdown in 1623, but resigned it to William in 1634. In 1641 he was granted particular privileges in the management of his father's patrimonial barony of Blair. The same year he was appointed chamberlain to the duke of Lennox and was elected to represent Ayrshire at the Edinburgh parliament which assembled in 1641. At its meeting Cochrane was knighted by Charles I, but despite misgivings about several clauses in the covenant, commented on by Baillie in 1638, he remained opposed to the king's disastrous attempt to entrench the Scottish episcopacy. As premier landlord in the west of Scotland he could hardly do any other.<br>
<br>During the civil war Cochrane was loyal to the committee of estates at Edinburgh, and assisted in the military campaigns against Montrose, bringing over 1400 men from the Scottish army in Ulster in 1645. He returned there again to fetch Major-General Robert Monro when the covenanters failed to crush the royalists in the highlands, but the victory at Philiphaugh rendered his orders obsolete. In the aftermath of war Cochrane was closest to the Hamiltonian faction among the covenanters, and was granted the title Lord Cochrane of Dundonald by patent dated at Carisbrooke Castle on 26 December 1647, the very day on which the king entered into his ill-fated Engagement with the duke of Hamilton and his supporters in Scotland. Lord Cochrane raised forces in his native Ayrshire, and once more in Ireland, for the much delayed invasion, which eventually got off the ground in July 1648. His association with this malignant venture, and its disastrous conclusion, resulted in his proscription under the <span class="roman">Act of Classes</span> and his ostracism by the presbytery of Ayr in 1649. Like most fervent Scots loyalists he remained out in the cold until Charles II was installed on the throne at Scone in 1651.<br>
<br>Unlike his elder brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5752/', "Sir John Cochrane")</script>, who undertook diplomatic duties in northern Germany, Lord Cochrane preferred to serve his royal master by remaining on his estate in Scotland. However, in the parliament which opened in 1651 he was once again to the fore, helping to organize the military venture on which the king pinned his hopes for the resumption of the English crown. Although he raised a regiment of horse of his own Cochrane was not optimistic about the king's chances in England&#151;his misgivings possibly arising when Charles saw fit to deny Cochrane's brothers the command of his lordship's horse regiment, giving it instead to a Dutchman, Vandrosk. When Cochrane's worst fears transpired on the field before Worcester, he retired to private life in Scotland. He acquired the lordship of Paisley from Archibald, earl of Angus, for &pound;160,000 Scots in 1653, and it is said that he lived there in great opulence. After the Cromwellian conquest Cochrane was fined &pound;5000 sterling by the <span class="roman">Act of Pardon and Grace</span>, although in the end the pressure on him was eased and the mulct was reduced by the council at Whitehall to the more manageable sum of &pound;1666 13<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. In a sign of further attempts at some sort of reconciliation, promoted especially hard during the governorship of Lord Broghill, Cochrane was named to the commission of the peace for Ayrshire in 1656. Later in the year he was elected to sit at Westminster as the member for Ayrshire and Renfrewshire in Oliver Cromwell's second protectorate parliament.<br>
<br>It has been claimed that Cochrane supported General Monck financially to the tune of &pound;20,000 in 1659, supposedly in order to promote the Stuart restoration, following which he was sworn of the privy council and appointed commissioner of the Treasury and excise in Scotland, which latter post he occupied from 1667 to 1682. He was created earl of Dundonald and Lord Cochrane of Paseley and Ochiltrie on 12 May 1669. He frequently acted on behalf of the duke of Monmouth, whose interests as duke of Buccleuch were not always well served by his absence at court. Later, the earl's second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5753/', "Sir John Cochrane")</script> would also earn the duke's gratitude, his action in the 1685 rebellion almost costing him his life. In 1684, although Dundonald was under threat of prosecution for harbouring covenanter fugitives on his own land, his granddaughter Jean married John Graham of Claverhouse, scourge of the western rebels. Dundonald's tremulous signature appears attached to the marriage contract. The same year it was also alleged that his eldest son, William, Lord Cochrane, who had died five years earlier, had kept a chaplain who had prayed for God's blessing on the 1679 uprising. The story of this Cochrane connection with the covenanters was revived and exploited as a way of discrediting the powerful and influential Claverhouse. He himself was at pains to clear the family of any distasteful imputation, insisting that there were far fewer rebels on the earl's estates than there were on many other local lairds', but could not deny the religious sentiments of his mother-in-law, Lady Katherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kennedy. The earl was, however, somewhat delayed in taking the oath of loyalty prescribed under the 1681 <span class="roman">Test Act</span>, although his procrastination was excused by his colleagues in the privy council by his age and infirmity. He died in November 1685, aged eighty, and was buried at Dundonald. Having been predeceased by his eldest son he was succeeded in the earldom by his grandson, John. His daughter, Grizel, married George, tenth Lord Ross.<br>
