<span class="headword">Warrell,  Charles Watson</span>  (1889&#150;1995), <span class="occ">headmaster and writer</span>, was born on 23 April 1889 at Farmborough, near Bath, Somerset, the son of Sidney Watson Warrell, headmaster of Farmborough village school, and his wife, Annie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stubbs. Charles Warrell was educated at Newfoundland Road School, Bristol, and from 1907 to 1909 attended his father's old college, Culham College, near Oxford, an Anglican teacher-training foundation. His first teaching appointment was at Frome council school in Somerset in 1909, followed by a post in Shropshire.<br>
<br>In 1913 Warrell was appointed headmaster to the village school in Higher Wych, Malpas, Cheshire, a rural farming community. He had married a fellow teacher, Elizabeth Gill (<i>d</i>. 1952), about 1907; they had one son and two daughters. The Higher Wych school logbook reveals a respected, creative, and innovative head, whose enthusiasm for hands-on activities was already apparent. In 1914 a visiting inspector recorded that his &#145;work is marked by commendable skill and by unusual enthusiasm and enterprise. I cannot speak too highly of the practical character of his work, which is full of promise for the future&#146;. Warrell joined the army in 1916 and served in Salonika, his wife acting as temporary headteacher in his absence. After the war he continued to teach at Higher Wych until 1923, when he went as headmaster to a school in Bridgnorth, Shropshire.<br>
<br>From 1926 to 1944 Warrell was headmaster of Pleasley Hill secondary school, Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. During these years he also developed his skills as a writer, producing articles for educational journals, plus textbooks including the <span class="roman">I'll Teach You</span> series, a set of self-improvement books for ex-servicemen. He is best known, however, as the originator in the late 1940s of the <span class="roman">I-Spy</span> series of children's books. At first called the <span class="roman">I-Spy Spotterbooks</span>, these were initially rejected by several publishers, so Warrell took the risk of publishing them himself, and sold them via a friendly contact in his local Woolworths. Their instant success enabled Warrell to become a full-time writer from 1948, producing a weekly &#145;I-spy&#146; column first for the <span class="italic">Daily Mail</span> and then for the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span> who &#145;poached&#146; him in 1950. A long <span class="roman">I-Spy</span> series evolved under various publishers, with Warrell's role that of editor-in-chief, or &#145;Big Chief I-Spy&#146; as he became known to children. The pocket-size sixpenny booklets covered subjects such as birds, trees, insects, farms, history, cars, the seaside, aircraft, and musical instruments. There were items to spot for points and boxes to tick for achieving each challenge. Small prizes were awarded for completed books and a Redskins club, costing 1<i>s</i>. to join, featured secret codes, badges, passwords and the occasional organized gathering. Warrell obviously enjoyed the ritual and regalia side of his creation and was &#145;always happy to appear in his giant head-dress on special, I-Spy pow-wows&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>). For thousands of children in the 1950s and 1960s, the <span class="roman">I-Spy</span> books were an affordable and attractive purchase, and Warrell's coded catchphrase ODHU/NTINGGO (good hunting) in his weekly column epitomized the books' spirit of adventurous enquiry.<br>
<br>In 1946 Warrell moved to London with his secretary Marian Tucker (<i>d</i>. 1994), whom he later married after his first wife died in 1952. Marian was an enthusiastic supporter of I-Spy activities and was herself known as Running Deer. Warrell retired from his <span class="roman">I-Spy</span> writing in 1959, though the books continued under another editor and the series remained in print until 1986. Michelin relaunched it in 1991, replacing the line drawings with photographs and updating the items. In retirement Warrell lived for many years in Budleigh Salterton, Devon, enjoying gardening and walking. He continued to write articles, and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Culham College Association magazine, contributing short pieces and reminiscences into his nineties and beyond, and for some years enjoying the distinction of being the oldest surviving Culhamite. A man of small stature, he had a booming voice and abundant white hair. He remained sharp-witted and enthusiastic until the very end of his life, with only his failing eyesight curtailing his activities. The <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> erroneously reported his death in 1991, but made amends by sending him a case of champagne which, as a teetotaller, he was unable to appreciate. Charles Warrell died on 26 November 1995 at the advanced age of 106, at the Valley Lodge Nursing Home, Bakewell Road, Matlock, Derbyshire.<br>
