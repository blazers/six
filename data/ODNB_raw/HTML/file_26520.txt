<span class="headword">Stewart, Sir  William</span>  (1774&#150;1827), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 10 January 1774, was the second surviving son of John Stewart, seventh earl of Galloway (1736&#150;1806), and his second wife, Anne (1742/3&#150;1830), daughter of Sir James Dashwood, baronet. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26466/', "Charles James Stewart")</script> was his younger brother. William received a commission as ensign in the 42nd foot on 8 March 1786, became lieutenant in the 67th on 14 October 1787, and captain of an independent company on 24 January 1791. In that year he went with Sir Robert Murray Keith to Vienna and to the congress of Sistova. His company was disbanded in December, and he was appointed to the 22nd foot on 31 October 1792. He served with it in the West Indies in 1793&#150;4, and commanded a company in the grenadier battalion at the capture of Martinique and Guadeloupe. He was wounded in the unsuccessful attempt on Point-&agrave;-Pitre on 2 July 1794, when Guadeloupe had been recovered by the French. He returned to Britain in November, and obtained a majority in the 31st foot.<br>
<br>Stewart was made lieutenant-colonel in the army and assistant adjutant-general to Lord Moira's corps on 14 January 1795, and in June he served on the staff of the expedition to Quiberon. On 1 September he was given command of the 67th foot, and went with it to San Domingo. He was commandant at Mole St Nicholas, with the local rank of colonel, until it was handed over to Toussaint l'Ouverture in August 1798. After returning to Europe he obtained leave to serve with the Austrian and Russian armies in the campaign of 1799, and was at the battle of Z&uuml;rich.<br>
<br>It was probably what he saw of Croats and Tyrolese in this campaign that led him to propose, in concert with Colonel Coote Manningham, that there should be a corps of riflemen in the British army. The proposal was adopted, and an experimental &#145;corps of riflemen&#146; was formed in January 1800 by detachments from fourteen regiments. This was brought into the line two years afterwards as the 95th, and eventually became the rifle brigade. Manningham was colonel and Stewart lieutenant-colonel of the brigade, his commission being dated 25 August 1800. The organization and training of the corps fell to Stewart, for Manningham was equerry to the king. The standing orders show how much he was in advance of most soldiers of his time. Medals for good conduct and for valour, lectures, school, library, classification in shooting, and athletic exercises were among his means to increase efficiency. He preferred Irish recruits, as &#145;perhaps, from being less spoiled and more hardy than British soldiers, better calculated for light troops&#146;. Charles James Napier was a subaltern in the corps in 1802, and wrote of Stewart as open-hearted and honourable in the highest degree, but with much passion, much zeal, and not the least judgement.<br>
<br>In August 1800 Stewart went with three companies of his rifles to Ferrol in Pulteney's expedition, and was dangerously wounded in the first skirmish. He commanded the troops which served as marines in the fleet sent to the Baltic in 1801. He was himself on Nelson's flagship at Copenhagen, and wrote what was regarded as the best account of the battle (in J. S. Clarke and J. McArthur, <span class="italic">The Life of Admiral Lord Nelson</span>, 2 vols., 1809, based on a journal later printed in the <span class="italic">Cumloden Papers</span>). Nelson wrote of him to St Vincent as &#145;the rising hope of our army&#146;, and there was a cordial and lasting friendship between them. By Nelson's wish Stewart's son was named Horatio. Stewart was included in the vote of thanks of parliament, and was made colonel from 2 April.<br>
<br>In 1804 he was appointed brigadier of volunteers in the eastern counties, and in 1805 he published <span class="italic">Outlines of a Plan for the General Reform of the British Land Forces</span>, recommending many of the changes which he had already introduced into his own corps. In December 1806 he took command of a brigade in Sicily, and three months afterwards he went on to Egypt with Fraser's expedition. On 3 April he was sent to Rosetta with 2500 men to avenge Wauchope's repulse. Though a most ardent soldier he was afraid of responsibility; he wished that the command had devolved on someone else, and felt &#145;a sort of inward presentiment that matters would not go well&#146;. In his first reconnaissance he received a bullet-wound in the arm. He invested the town and made batteries, but did not risk an assault. On 21 April the Turks received reinforcements from Cairo, and cut to pieces a detachment of 700 men which he had placed at al-Hamed, and he had to fight his way back to Alexandria, losing 300 more on the road.<br>
<br>The expedition returned to Sicily in September, and Stewart was commandant of Syracuse until February 1809, when he came home. He had been promoted major-general on 25 April 1808, and on 31 August 1809 he was made colonel of the 3rd battalion, 95th rifles. He commanded the light brigade in the Walcheren expedition, but was invalided early in September.<br>
<br>In January 1810 he was sent to the Peninsula to command the British and Portuguese troops which were to form part of the garrison of Cadiz. He did well there, but was soon superseded in the chief command by Thomas Graham (afterwards Baron Lynedoch). In July he left Cadiz, and was appointed to the 2nd division of Wellington's army under Hill. He was present at Busaco, but could not obtain the medal, as he was not &#145;personally and particularly engaged&#146;. In December Hill was invalided, and Stewart commanded his corps for a time, but his self-distrust led Wellington to send Beresford to take Hill's place.<br>
<br>In May 1811, after Mass&eacute;na's retreat, the 2nd division&#151;still forming part of Beresford's corps&#151;shared in the first siege of Badajoz, and bore the brunt of the battle of Albuera. The division's 1st brigade (Colborne's) was nearly destroyed there by a sudden attack of French lancers on its rear as it was advancing to charge the French infantry. According to Napier this happened because &#145;Stewart, whose boiling courage generally overlaid his judgment, heedlessly led up in column of companies&#146;, without waiting to deploy, as Colborne wished to do. But the charge was made by three deployed battalions (out of four), and, according to Sir Benjamin d'Urban, Beresford's quartermaster-general, Stewart's fault lay rather in rejecting Colborne's proposal to keep a wing of one regiment in column. There can be no doubt that his impetuosity had something to do with the result; but the urgency of the case and the mist which hid the French cavalry go far to excuse him. Beresford had nothing but praise for him in his dispatch, and he was thanked by parliament. In July he went home on account of ill health, and was employed in the eastern district.<br>
<br>In August 1812 Stewart was again appointed to the army in the Peninsula, with the local rank of lieutenant-general. He joined on 6 December, and was given command of the 1st division. It comprised the brigade of guards, and a question of privilege soon arose, as he was not a guardsman. In April 1813 he was transferred to his old division, the 2nd. On 4 June he became lieutenant-general. At Vitoria he was on the right under Hill, who spoke highly of his conduct. He was included in the thanks of parliament, and was made KB on 11 September. When Soult tried to relieve Pampeluna, the 2nd division was guarding the passes near Maya, and was attacked on 25 July by three divisions of d'Erlon's corps and forced back. Stewart reached the field late, having been at Elisondo with Hill, and reformed his line. Four Portuguese guns, which were moving by his order to the new position, stuck fast, and were taken by the French. Wellington referred with some asperity to the loss of these guns in a postscript to his dispatch.<br>
<br>Stewart took part in Hill's action at Buenza on 30 July, and next day he led the attack on the French rearguard at the Dona Maria Pass. In this attack he was badly wounded, having been already slightly wounded during the 25 July action. He was present at the Nivelle, Nive, and Orthes, and had a prominent part in the combat of Aire and a minor part at Toulouse. He was popular with the men of his division, among whom he was known as &#145;auld grog Willie&#146; on account of the extra allowances of rum which he authorized, and which Wellington made him pay for. For his services in the Peninsula he received the gold cross with two clasps, the Portuguese order of the Tower and Sword, and the Spanish order of San Fernando. On 2 January 1815 (on the enlargement of the Order of the Bath) he was made GCB. He saw no further service and reportedly declined a peerage &#145;from prudential motives&#146;  (HoP, <span class="italic">Commons</span>, 298).<br>
<br>Through family influence Stewart had been MP for Saltash (1795&#150;6), Wigtownshire (1796&#150;1802; 1812&#150;16), and Wigtown burghs (1803&#150;5), supporting the tory government. His health had been broken by seventeen campaigns, in which he had received six wounds and four contusions, and for this reason, or possibly because of political disagreement with his brother, Lord Galloway, he resigned from parliament in 1816. In July 1818 he was transferred to the colonelcy of the 1st battalion of what had then become the rifle brigade. On 21 April 1804 Stewart had married Frances (<i>d</i>. 6 Aug 1833), daughter of John Douglas (second son of the earl of Morton), and they had one son, Horatio (1806&#150;1835), a captain in the rifle brigade, and one daughter, Louisa. In 1817 he purchased and retired to a property in Cumloden, near Newton Stewart, Wigtownshire, near the family seat. He died there on 7 January 1827, and was buried at Minnigaff. Extracts from his journals and correspondence were privately printed in 1871 as the <span class="italic">Cumloden Papers</span>.<br>
