<span class="headword">Lane,  Edward William</span>  (1801&#150;1876), <span class="occ">orientalist</span>, born on 17 September 1801 at Hereford, was a younger son of Theophilus Lane (1764&#150;1814), prebendary of Hereford, and his wife, Sophia Gardiner, of Bath, a niece of the painter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10282/', "Thomas Gainsborough RA")</script>. His sister was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22522/', "Sophia Lane Poole")</script>, travel writer. Two of his nephews, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22520/', "(Reginald) Stuart Poole")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22512/', "(Edward) Stanley Poole")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22522/', "Poole, Sophia Lane")</script>], as well as a great-nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35569/', "Stanley Edward Lane-Poole")</script>, shared his interest in Egyptian matters. Another great-nephew, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35568/', "Reginald Lane Poole")</script>, was a historian. Lane attended grammar schools at Bath and Hereford, but much of his education was conducted by his mother, his father having died in 1814. Originally intending to study at Cambridge and enter the church, Lane instead followed his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15997/', "Richard James Lane")</script>, into apprenticeship as an engraver under Charles Heath in London, but during the early 1820s his imagination was captured by Egypt, then a subject of popular fascination. He decided to make the Egyptian people and their language his life's work.<br>
<br>Lane arrived in Egypt on 19 September 1825, likening his feelings to those of &#145;an Eastern bridegroom, about to lift up the veil of his bride&#146;  (manuscript draft of &#145;Description of Egypt&#146;, Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. misc. d. 234, fol. 5). He lived exclusively in Muslim areas of Cairo, adopted local dress, and soon spoke Arabic fluently, moving freely in Egyptian society and recording the close observations that made his work so valuable. Although he primarily associated with the indigenous people, who knew him as Mansur Efendi, Lane also became acquainted with the small group of British Egyptologists and orientalists then assembling in Egypt: Henry Salt, John Gardner Wilkinson, Robert Hay, James Burton, Frederick Catherwood, Algernon Percy (Lord Prudhoe), Joseph Bonomi, and Major Orlando Felix. He worked extensively in Cairo and explored nearby archaeological sites such as Giza, Saqqara, and Dahshur, for he was intensely interested in ancient as well as modern Egypt during this stage of his career. Twice he ascended the Nile into Nubia as far as the second cataract. Before leaving Egypt he purchased Nefeeseh 
    (Anastasoula Georgiou; 1820&#150;1895)
  , a Greek child who had been captured during the Greek War of Independence and sold as a slave in Cairo.<br>
<br>After returning to London in June 1828 Lane composed &#145;Description of Egypt&#146;, a remarkable manuscript of some 300,000 words and almost 200 illustrations. Besides recording his travels through Egypt, it included geographical studies, essays on modern and ancient Egyptian history, and a description of the Nubians. The eminent London firm of John Murray agreed to publish the work, but postponed sending it to press, initially because of the crisis over the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> of 1832. Frustrated by continuing publication delays and eager to return to Egypt, Lane took some chapters about modern Egyptian society that Murray had insisted on removing from &#145;Description&#146; and proposed to develop them into a separate book. With the support of Lord Brougham, the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge contracted to publish the book and provided an advance payment which financed Lane's second trip to Egypt. When he returned to Cairo in December 1833, Lane quickly gathered his data and a year after his arrival began the fair copy of the book manuscript. A fierce outbreak of plague forced him in early 1835 to flee into Upper Egypt where he spent several months living in a tomb at Thebes before returning to England later that year. <span class="italic">An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians</span> (2 vols.) became an instant success after its publication in 1836 and is still used as a basic text by both Eastern and Western students of the Arab world.<br>
<br>Soon after the appearance of <span class="italic">Modern Egyptians</span>, Murray cancelled plans to publish &#145;Description of Egypt&#146;, which was not published until almost 125 years after Lane's death. Greatly disappointed, Lane turned to other projects. One was his translation of the Arabic classic, the <span class="italic">Thousand and one Nights</span> (3 vols., 1839&#150;41); another was <span class="italic">Selections from the Kur-&aacute;n</span> (1843). Though <span class="italic">Selections from the Kur-&aacute;n</span> is the least substantial of Lane's major published works, it nevertheless contains valuable material and demonstrates his conviction that essential Middle Eastern literary works should be communicated to the English reading public. This was even more the case with the <span class="italic">Thousand and one Nights</span>, which Lane believed presented &#145;most admirable pictures of the manners and customs of the Arabs, and particularly of those of the Egyptians&#146;  (Lane, <span class="italic">Modern Egyptians</span>, 1.vi n.). It reigned as the leading English translation of the <span class="italic">Nights</span> for decades, and its copious notes are stimulating micro-essays of enduring value.<br>
<br>The course of Lane's later life was set in 1841 when he accepted an offer from his friend Algernon Percy (known as Lord Prudhoe, later the duke of Northumberland) to support the compilation of a definitive Arabic&#150;English lexicon. The first step was to travel to Egypt and gather the Arabic lexicographical texts on which such a work had to be based. Lane sailed from England in July 1842, accompanied by Nefeeseh, whom he had married on 8 July 1840, and by his sister Sophia Poole and her two sons, Stanley and Stuart. For the next seven years they lived in Cairo, always in those parts of the city inhabited by local people, as Lane collated the material for the lexicon, assisted by an Egyptian language master, Sheykh Ibrahim al-Desuqi. Lane threw himself into the daunting task so thoroughly as to become a near recluse, often not leaving his house for months at a time. With his permission Sophia took selected passages from his &#145;Description of Egypt&#146; manuscript and added her own experiences to form a series of letters to an imaginary correspondent in England. Prepared under Lane's general supervision, Sophia's <span class="italic">The Englishwoman in Egypt</span> (3 vols., 1844&#150;6) became a classic, especially prized for its observations of Egyptian women.<br>
<br>The Lanes and Pooles returned to England in October 1849. After briefly living in Hastings, they moved to Worthing where they eventually settled at 1 Union Place. Sophia remained there until the household was dissolved after Lane's death; Stanley and Stuart soon departed for London to begin careers at the British Museum. At Worthing, Lane intensified his dedication to the lexicon project, working on it every day from early morning until late at night, except on Sundays, which were reserved for <span class="roman">Bible</span> study in Hebrew, and on Friday afternoons when he received friends. Otherwise visitors were generally denied. Algernon Percy (by now duke of Northumberland) and later his widow continued their support, which the government supplemented by a civil-list pension. The first volume of the <span class="italic">Arabic&#150;English Lexicon</span> appeared in 1863, followed by succeeding volumes at fairly regular intervals. Lane was working on the sixth volume at the time of his death. His great-nephew Stanley Lane-Poole supervised publication of the remaining volumes, the eighth and final one appearing in 1893. The <span class="italic">Lexicon</span>, a monumental work of nineteenth-century scholarship, remained an indispensable resource for scholars throughout the twentieth century. A second series of volumes that Lane had originally projected for rarer Arabic words was never composed.<br>
<br>Besides the works listed above, Lane published two essays in German&#151;one on Arabic lexicography and the other on Arabic pronunciation&#151;and he is considered to have been the anonymous author of a book about science and scripture. He also published a notable lithograph of the great pyramid in 1830, one of the few illustrations from his &#145;Description of Egypt&#146; manuscript to appear during his lifetime. After Lane's death Stanley Lane-Poole selected notes from the <span class="italic">Thousand and one Nights</span> and published them under Lane's name as <span class="italic">Arabian Society in the Middle Ages</span> (1883). Another posthumous publication was <span class="italic">Cairo Fifty Years Ago</span> (1896) which consisted of revised chapters about Cairo from &#145;Description of Egypt&#146;. Not until 2000 was a complete edition of <span class="italic">Description of Egypt</span> published. Lane was generally reluctant to accept honours&#151;family tradition strongly hints that he refused a knighthood&#151;but he received an honorary doctorate of literature from the University of Leiden and was a member of the German Oriental Society, the Royal Asiatic Society, the Royal Society of Literature, the Institut de France, and other learned institutions. He died on 10 August 1876 at his home in Worthing, survived by his wife, and was buried on 15 August in Norwood cemetery, London.<br>
