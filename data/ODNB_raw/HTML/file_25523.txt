<span class="headword">Sidney,  Philip</span>, third earl of Leicester  (1619&#150;1698), <span class="occ">parliamentarian army officer and politician</span>, was born at Baynard's Castle, London, on 10 January 1619, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25525/', "Robert Sidney, second earl of Leicester (1595&#150;1677)")</script>, and his wife, Dorothy (<i>bap</i>. 1598, <i>d</i>. 1659), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21939/', "Henry Percy, ninth earl of Northumberland")</script>. Philip's younger brothers included the republican theorist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25519/', "Algernon Sidney (1623&#150;1683)")</script> and the whig politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25521/', "Henry Sidney, earl of Romney")</script>. His sister Dorothy (1617&#150;1691) became countess of Sunderland [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26120/', "Spencer, Dorothy")</script>]. A group portrait of Philip and his brothers Algernon and Robert is at Penshurst Place, Kent. From 1626, when his father succeeded as earl of Leicester, until his own accession to the title in 1677, Philip bore the courtesy title Viscount Lisle.<br>
<br>Lisle matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 26 July 1634. He accompanied his father on his embassy to Denmark in 1632, and on his embassy to France in 1636. By then the earl's preference for his second son over his heir was already apparent: Algernon was more often in Paris with his father, while Philip was generally left to languish in a French country town. According to Algernon, the earl held &#145;a sinister opinion&#146; of Philip from when he was a boy, and in later years vainly demanded that his heir &#145;should leave the lewd, infamous and Atheisticall life that he led&#146;  (Scott, <span class="italic">English Republic</span>, 60).<br>
<br>Lisle returned to England to serve in the second bishops' war, where he commanded the cuirassiers who formed the bodyguard of his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21923/', "Algernon Percy, tenth earl of Northumberland")</script>. In the Short Parliament of April 1640, and in the Long Parliament, Lisle represented the borough of Yarmouth in the Isle of Wight, doubtless owing his election to the patronage of his uncle Northumberland, the lord high admiral.<br>
<br>When the Irish uprising broke out Lisle was sent to Ireland by his father, the lord deputy, in command of a regiment of 600 horse, which landed at Dublin in April 1642. He relieved Geashill Castle in King's county, commanded a plundering expedition into the Irish quarters which advanced as far as Monaghan, and performed other exploits. Lisle held the rank of lieutenant-general of the horse under the earl of Ormond, and the parliamentarian sympathizers in the Irish government would gladly have seen him commander-in-chief in Ormond's place. His support of the parliamentary commissioners Reynolds and Goodwin in their intrigues against Ormond greatly hindered the public service, and Ormond was successful in excluding him from the Irish council in early 1643. Ormond's chaplain, Creichton, charged Lisle with misconduct at the battle of Ross (18 March 1643); while Sir John Temple, a client of the Sidney family, asserted that Lisle did very good service in Ireland, and was systematically discouraged and affronted.<br>
<br>When Ormond's negotiations for the cessation began Lisle resolved to leave Ireland, saying, in an intercepted letter to his father, &#145;that no good is to be done in this place&#146;, and that he feared an oath against the English parliament was about to be imposed on the officers serving in Ireland  (Gilbert, 2.60). Though arrested on landing in England, he was speedily released and voted &pound;1000 for his services. Lisle married Lady Catherine Cecil (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1628&#150;1652), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37272/', "William Cecil, second earl of Salisbury")</script>, on 19 May 1645.<br>
<br>In 1646, as soon as parliament was able to think of sending fresh forces to Ireland, Lisle was appointed lord lieutenant (21 January 1646). It has been argued that his appointment was closely connected with factional rivalries at Westminster, marking an attempt by the Independents to undermine their presbyterian opponents, in pursuit of an &#145;imperial&#146; vision of the three kingdoms united under English rule. Whether or not that is the case, Lisle's lord lieutenancy was a troubled and ineffective attempt to pacify Ireland. Lisle's commission is dated 9 April 1646, but not until 1 February 1647 was he able to start for his charge. He landed in Munster, bringing with him 120 horse and 5000 foot, but was able to accomplish nothing, and became involved in a violent quarrel with Lord Inchiquin. Lisle's commission expired on 15 April 1647; he returned at once to England, and was thanked by parliament on 7 May, though his command was not renewed. At the height of the presbyterian putsch at Westminster that summer Lisle fled to the safety of the army. Like his brother Algernon he was appointed one of the judges for the trial of Charles I, but declined to act. He did not, however, feel any scruples about supporting the republic, and was a member of the first, second, and fourth councils of state elected during the Commonwealth, the last of which he chaired for a month as lord president from 23 February 1653. A few of his letters on public affairs during this period are printed by Collins, with a further forty-four letters from this period appearing in the HMC report on the manuscripts of Lord De L'Isle and Dudley  (6.445&#150;88). On 31 December 1652 Lisle was selected to go as ambassador to Sweden, and accepted, but his instructions were not ready until 22 March 1653, and he had not started when Cromwell turned out the Long Parliament. In August 1653 he resigned his mission, pleading ill health.<br>
<br>Lisle was high in Cromwell's favour. He was summoned to sit in the &#145;Little Parliament&#146; (Barebone's Parliament) and was a member of both the councils of state elected by it, but he was &#145;a lazy councillor and &hellip; avoided parliamentary committees like the plague&#146;  (Woolrych, 313&#150;14). He was also a member of each of the two councils of state of the protectorate, and was summoned to sit in Cromwell's House of Lords. At the ceremony of Cromwell's second installation as protector (26 June 1656) he took a prominent part, and a letter disapproving of his brother Algernon's ostentatious opposition to the protector has been preserved.<br>
<br>Lisle signed the proclamation declaring Richard Cromwell protector, and was a member of his council. In spite of the important positions he held he seems to have exercised very little political influence, and therefore incurred very little danger when the Restoration took place, but he provided against possible trouble by obtaining a pardon under the great seal (30 October 1660); he also lived in discreet retirement on his estate at Sheen, Richmond, between 1660 and 1672.<br>
<br>Lisle succeeded his father as earl of Leicester on 2 November 1677. Between 1678 and 1681 he was active in his opposition to the crown during the exclusion crisis, and then withdrew from politics after 1685. According to the eighteenth-century account of Arthur Collins, in his later years Leicester was a patron of literature, used to entertain members of the literary elite&#151;including John Dryden and William Wycherley&#151;at Leicester House, London, and set apart one day in the week for the entertainment of men of letters. Overshadowing the Restoration years, however, were the family feuds set in train by the second earl's distaste for his eldest son and his willingness to trample over the principles of primogeniture. When Lisle married Catherine Cecil in 1645 the settlement of the Sidney inheritance then made brought out into the open, and in due course irreparably widened, the breach between Lisle and his father. Lisle would inherit the estate as eldest son, but the earl maintained financial control over the future of the estate by reserving to himself the right to charge the estates with bequests up to &pound;29,000 as he chose, which would have to be paid before Lisle could inherit. Father and son quarrelled bitterly. When Lisle's allowance was cut following the death of his wife in childbed on 18 August 1652 he sent his father word by his mother that &#145;he esteemed himself discharged of all duty and obedience towards him&#146;, and in a furious row struck his father in the face  (Scott, <span class="italic">English Republic</span>, 61). Over the years the earl took ample opportunity of the discretion he had allowed himself, adding to and altering his will a dozen times between 1660 and his death. In return Lisle refused in 1672 to co-operate in his father's schemes to develop Leicester Fields, bitterly reflecting that for the last thirty years he had received from his father but one suit of clothes for his son, and declaring that he would now &#145;unwillingly lett goe any slender hold I retaine upon my naturall or legall rights&#146;  (Scott, <span class="italic">Restoration Crisis</span>, 91). With his father's death Philip became locked into a bitter struggle through the courts with his surviving brothers, Algernon and Henry, to whom he was expected to pay &pound;20,000 or &pound;29,000 plus extensive rents and annuities, and who as executors of the will held control of the estate. The younger brothers won their case in chancery, but Henry, recognizing the distance between winning and enforcing a judgment, used the verdict as a bargaining tool and came to terms with the earl. These family conflicts received resolution only in late 1683 when the more implacable Algernon lay in prison awaiting execution; Leicester reportedly sent him part of the money still at issue, &#145;because he could no longer hold up the cudgells&#146;  (ibid., 99).<br>
<br>Leicester died at Leicester House, London, on 6 March 1698, and was buried at Penshurst on 17 March. He was succeeded by his son Robert Sidney (apparently his only surviving legitimate child), born in 1649, who had been summoned to the House of Lords as Baron Sidney of Penshurst by William III on 11 July 1689. Robert died on 11 November 1702. Leicester had never remarried but in his will made very generous provision for three adult daughters and one son evidently fathered by himself outside marriage, the children of liaisons with Grace Saunders, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pensac (or Pensacke), and Jane Highems, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pensac. The mothers received &pound;600 apiece  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/444, fols. 263<i>r</i>&#150;9<i>v</i>).<br>
