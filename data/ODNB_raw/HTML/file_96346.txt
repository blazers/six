<span class="headword">Payne,  John Charles</span>  (1872&#150;1952), <span class="occ">singer and choirmaster</span>, was born in Montgomery, Alabama, USA, in 1872, the son of former slaves. As a young man he &#145;possessed an outstanding soprano voice&#146;  (<span class="italic">Cornish Times</span>, 10 Oct 1952), which changed to a rich baritone, and he found work in various venues around the United States. He came to England in 1919 as a baritone and choirmaster with the Southern Syncopated Orchestra. He also sang with a splinter group from the orchestra, the Exposition Jubilee Quartet, also known as the Southern Syncopated Singers and later the Royal Southern Singers (after they had appeared by royal command at Buckingham Palace). Payne appeared with this quartet at the Wigmore and Aeolian concert halls. It was through his friendship with Mary, Lady Cook (wife of the art connoisseur Sir Herbert Cook and daughter of the second Viscount Bridport) that he was able to acquire a home at 17 Regent's Park Road, London. In the 1920s and 1930s this was a popular meeting place for African-American expatriates or visitors, mainly from the world of music. Lady Cook had a fondness for black people, and insisted they should call her &#145;Mother&#146;. She happily subsidized Payne's hospitality and he cared very much for her, but there was almost certainly no sexual relationship between them since Payne was homosexual.<br>
<br>For African-American musicians and singers who visited Europe, Payne was their unofficial ambassador. Most of them, like Paul Robeson and Adelaide Hall, found their way to his home, if not for a place to stay, at least for introductions to new friends in the entertainment and social circles of England. The contralto Marian Anderson lived at Payne's house after her arrival in London in November 1927 and later recalled: &#145;Life in London for me centred largely around the house in Regent's Park Road. I spent most of my time in it when I was not out taking lessons&#146;  (Anderson, 103). In 1928 the blues singer Alberta Hunter stayed with Payne when she accepted an offer to appear with Paul Robeson at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in the musical <span class="italic">Show Boat</span>. Payne was also featured in this show, in the Mississippi Chorus. When Robeson stayed with Payne on his first visit to London in 1922 he befriended another guest, Lawrence Brown, a gentle, charming man, also a homosexual, who had travelled to London from America to accompany the African-American concert singer Roland Hayes. According to Robeson's biographer &#145;One night at Payne's, Robeson sang a few songs &#147;just for fun&#148;&#146;, and thus began the highly successful musical collaboration between Robeson and Brown  (Duberman, 49). Throughout his stay in London in the 1920s and 1930s Robeson often attended and sometimes sang at the open-house parties Payne gave on Sundays in his Regent's Park Road drawing room. He also found work for Payne as a bit player and extra in some of his British films, including <span class="italic">Jericho</span> and <span class="italic">King Solomon's Mines</span> (both 1937).<br>
<br>In the 1920s Payne formed the Southern Trio with Mabel Mercer and C. C. Rosemond, and together they appeared in the West End revue <span class="italic">Blackbirds</span> (1926), starring Florence Mills. In the 1930s he formed the Negro Choir, which took part in a &#145;pageant of parliament&#146; that ran for three weeks at the Albert Hall in 1934. The choir also featured in several films, including <span class="italic">Radio Parade of 1935</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">Lily of Laguna</span> (1938). In London in 1935 Payne recorded some spirituals for the Regal-Zonophone label.<br>
<br>Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Payne and Lady Cook moved away from London to Looe, Cornwall. She died in 1943. Payne, meanwhile, taught music, sang in choirs, and became a popular figure in the local community. He died on 7 October 1952 at Dawn, Hannafore, Looe, of cancer of the pancreas. He was buried in West Looe cemetery and his memorial reads: &#145;To the memory of John C. Payne, singer and musician. Loved and remembered by his many friends. The song is ended, but the memory lingers on.&#146;<br>
