<span class="headword">Eyre,  Thomas</span>  (1748&#150;1810), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and college head</span>, was born at Glossop, Derbyshire, the fourth son of Nathaniel Eyre, steward to the duke of Norfolk at Worksop, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Jane Bromhead. Like his brothers, he went to the preparatory school at Esquerchin, Douai, from 1758 before moving to the parent English College at Douai in 1762. In 1775, some months after his ordination, he accepted an invitation from his kinsman of the same name who had just inherited Stella Hall, near Ryton, co. Durham, to take charge of the mission which covered the area west of Newcastle as far as Hexham. He stayed seventeen years, during which time he translated and published several of the spiritual works of John Gother in addition to <span class="italic">The Instruction of Youth in Christian Piety</span> (1783), a translation of the work of Charles Gobinet.<br>
<br>Appointed to Pontop Hall, near Consett, in 1794, Eyre was soon asked by Bishop William Gibson to take charge of a small number of student refugees from Douai while a temporary college was being prepared for them at nearby Crook Hall. Inevitably he was called upon to preside over the new college. During the course of 1795 the Revd John Daniel, the president of the Douai college, paid a visit to Crook Hall, and was persuaded by Bishop Gibson to become its president in order to establish a continuity. Within a day or two, Daniel resigned and Eyre was reinstated. Under his direction the infant college surmounted many hurdles and was eventually transferred in 1808 to the much larger building at Ushaw, 4 miles from Durham. There Eyre died on 7 May 1810, and was buried in the adjoining cemetery on 9 May. His memorial rightly described him as &#145;benefactor munificus&#146;, for he left his entire fortune of &pound;8640 to the college. His portrait by Alexander Rossi at Ushaw reveals Eyre as a somewhat &#145;cribbed and confined&#146; gentleman. A stern disciplinarian, he was notoriously parsimonious, making use of the litter that others dropped and using the correspondence he received to compose his own draft letters. But there can be little doubt that he was the right man for the task given him by his bishop. Invariably at loggerheads with him, his diplomacy prevented a permanent breakdown of their relationship, which would have immeasurably damaged the educational prospects for northern Catholics of the time.<br>
