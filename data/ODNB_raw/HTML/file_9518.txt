<span class="headword">Fitchett,  John</span>  (1776&#150;1838), <span class="occ">poet</span>, the son of a wine merchant at Liverpool, was born on 21 September 1776, and orphaned before he was ten. He was then removed to Warrington by his testamentary guardian, Mr Kerfoot, and sent to Warrington grammar school under the Revd Edward Owen. In 1793 he was articled to his guardian, was then admitted as an attorney, and taken into partnership with him, and later rose to a high place in his profession. His first published work, <span class="italic">Bewsey, a Poem</span> (1796), written at eighteen, had considerable success. He afterwards wrote many ephemeral pieces, collected and printed at Warrington in 1836 under the title of <span class="italic">Minor Poems, Composed at Various Times</span>.<br>
<br>The great work of Fitchett's life, which occupied his leisure hours for forty years and to which he devoted unwearied industry and research, was a romantic epic poem on the life and times of King Alfred. It was printed at Warrington for private circulation at intervals between 1808 and 1834, in five quarto volumes. It included a biography of Alfred, an epitome of the antiquities, topography, religion, and civil and religious condition of the country. A partial revision was unfinished at his death. He left money for printing a new edition, a work undertaken by his pupil, clerk, and friend Robert Roscoe (son of William Roscoe of Liverpool), who added 2585 lines, making the entire work more than 131,000 lines long. This prodigious monument of misapplied learning and mental energy was published by Pickering in 1841&#150;2, in six volumes, and entitled <span class="italic">King Alfred, a Poem</span>.<br>
<br>Fitchett died unmarried at Warrington on 20 October 1838, and was buried at Winwick church in Warrington. A sum of &pound;8000 was left to his sister Ann. His large, select library was left to his nephew John Fitchett Marsh, with whose additions it was sold at Sothebys in May 1882.<br>
