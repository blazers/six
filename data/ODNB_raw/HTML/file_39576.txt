<span class="headword">Howard,  Henry</span>, twelfth earl of Suffolk and fifth earl of Berkshire  (1739&#150;1779), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was born on 10 or 16 May 1739, the eldest son of William Howard, styled Viscount Andover (<i>bap</i>. 1714, <i>d</i>. 1756), politician, and his wife, Mary (1717&#150;1803), the second daughter of Heneage Finch, second earl of Aylesford, and his second wife, Mary Fisher. He was educated at Eton College from 1748 and entered Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1757; he graduated MA in 1759 and DCL in 1761. Styled Viscount Andover after his father's death on 15 July 1756, he succeeded his grandfather as earl of Suffolk and Berkshire on 21 March 1757, when he inherited the main family estate of Charlton, Wiltshire, as well as others in Staffordshire and Westmorland. On 25 May 1764 he married Maria Trevor (1744&#150;1767), the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27733/', "Robert Hampden-Trevor, first Viscount Hampden")</script>, and his wife, Constantia de Huybert. She died in childbirth on 8 February 1767, and more than ten years later, on 14 August 1777, he married his cousin Charlotte (1754&#150;1828), the eldest daughter of his uncle Heneage Finch, third earl of Aylesford, and his wife, Charlotte Seymour. Their two sons both died in infancy.<br>
<br>From 1760 Suffolk, a year younger than George III himself, was much in favour at the royal court. He was bearer of the sword at the coronation and was invited to a very select ball at court in November 1761. It is not clear why in 1762 he allowed himself to be put forward for the chancellorship of Oxford University against the government candidate Lord Lichfield, being the candidate of the supposed whig interest in that traditionally tory stronghold; his youth was an obvious objection, and a widespread view was that his candidature came twenty years too soon. He did not stand a poll. Suffolk's inclination in national politics was to support government. His maiden speech in the Lords, on 9 December 1762, was in favour of the terms of what would be the treaty of Paris. In 1763 he was given the court post of deputy earl marshal. He seconded the Lords address on 24 November 1763 and spoke often in support of George Grenville's ministry. His political loyalty was transferred to Grenville, and on that minister's dismissal in July 1765 Suffolk decided to resign his court post; however, he was persuaded to remain in office under Lord Rockingham. He nevertheless, so he told Grenville, informed the king of &#145;the total impossibility of my supporting any measures contrary to those which had been adopted by my friends and connections&#146;  (<span class="italic">Additional Grenville Papers</span>, 303). On 29 October he was replaced by a Rockinghamite peer. American policy was what Suffolk had in mind, and he was always to be a hardliner on that issue. In the parliamentary session of 1765&#150;6 he took a leading role in criticizing the policy that led to repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span>. On 17 December 1765 he proposed a Lords denunciation of colonial resistance, and on 14 January 1766 he was one of only two peers to criticize the rather ambiguous address. It was Suffolk who on 29 January drew up a list of opposition resolutions for the Lords, and who on 4 February actually carried one, by sixty-three votes to sixty, &#145;requiring&#146; compensation to be paid by colonial rioters. In the Lords debate of 11 March on the repeal of the <span class="roman">Stamp Act</span> he replied to the argument that the Lords should agree with the Commons by haughtily declaring that the house constituted &#145;the hereditary Council of this Kingdom, not subject to the caprice of interested electors&#146;  (Thomas, <span class="italic">British Politics</span>, 244&#150;5).<br>
<br>Suffolk was never at ease in opposition, and in 1766 he vainly asked Grenville not to oppose the new Chatham ministry. But by March 1767 he was urging Grenville to construct an opposition alliance to oppose what he deemed to be the weak ministerial policy on America, and he spoke in several debates as part of such an alliance. His health was already deteriorating, and he was often absent from Westminster during the later 1760s, when there is little evidence of his parliamentary or other political activity. This semi-retirement paradoxically ended on Grenville's death in November 1770. His rank and parliamentary prominence led Suffolk to stand forth as his successor, and it was with the earl that the prime minister, Lord North, negotiated the accession of Grenvillites to the administration. In January 1771 Suffolk was offered the northern secretaryship, though &#145;a young man of thirty-two, totally unpractised in business, pompous, ignorant, and of no parts&#146;, as Horace Walpole scathingly wrote. &#145;The young Earl answered with modesty, that as he could not speak French, he was incapable of treating with foreign ministers, nor was he conversant in business: he wished for some high office, but not that of Secretary&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Memoirs</span>, 4.173). He was appointed lord privy seal, but few Grenvillites followed his leadership. Four months later, in June, he succeeded the deceased Lord Halifax as northern secretary.<br>
<br>Suffolk, who entirely lacked diplomatic and administrative experience and was dogged by ill health, owed his cabinet post to Lord North's desire to strengthen his ministry in parliament. Walpole noted in 1771 that, &#145;though young, he is all over gout&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 8.1). Yet contrary to contemporary expectation, and belying his historical reputation, he pulled his weight in the ministry. In parliament he was a frequent speaker, especially on America as the colonial crisis deteriorated into war. He was prominent also in cabinet. It was Suffolk who suggested the 1774 general election, to pre-empt any colonial influence. He early pressed for the recall of the soft-line General Gage from America, he advocated the arrest of Benjamin Franklin before he left Britain, he ordered the prosecution of radical John Horne Tooke for a seditious libel about Lexington, and he temporarily took charge of the American department in 1775 when the American secretary, Dartmouth, proved unwilling to conduct the war. But while Suffolk never relaxed his opinion on America, northern Europe was his departmental concern, and here he performed his duties with pragmatic competence, ever on the lookout for allies. His personal preference was for a renewal of the Austrian alliance that had ended in 1756. But the logic of the first partition of Poland in 1772, described by an indifferent Suffolk as &#145;this curious transaction&#146;  (Scott, 179), was that a reconciliation with France seemed the only viable option. In 1773 Suffolk finally abandoned the decade-long search for a Russian alliance. But he always disapproved of a rapprochement with France, and on the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775 conceived the idea of hiring 20,000 Russian soldiers, commenting to his under-secretary William Eden that they would be &#145;charming visitors at New York, and [would] civilize that part of America wonderfully&#146;  (ibid., 218). Catherine II refused, angry at Russia's being treated on a par with Hesse, whence Suffolk obtained the soldiers in 1776. In the wider diplomatic sphere Suffolk, anxious to avoid a European war until the American rebellion was crushed, now pragmatically sought to appease France and Spain, contrary to the view of the southern secretary, Weymouth. Supported by George III and Lord North, Suffolk overruled Weymouth in a successful attempt to keep Spain and France apart. When France alone entered the war in 1778, Suffolk sought to construct a diversionary war front in Europe and approached the other three great powers, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, even suggesting in April 1778 a Prussian alliance that would reconstruct the successful scenario of the Seven Years' War. But he was knocking on closed doors: no one wanted Britain as an ally or to fight France.<br>
<br>By now Suffolk's health had given way. In 1777 Walpole wrote of his new second wife, &#145;she cannot complain of being made a nurse, for he could have no other reason for marrying her, she is so plain&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 10.92). On 7 April 1778, the same day that Chatham collapsed in the Lords, Suffolk spoke &#145;with every symptom of debility, repeated his own phrases, could not recollect his own ideas&#146;  (ibid., 10.214). By January 1779 he was unable to perform his official duties, and his death on 7 March at Bath merely prevented his long-rumoured resignation. He was not yet forty. He was buried at Charlton, Wiltshire, on 20 March.<br>
