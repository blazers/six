<span class="headword">White,  Wilfrid Hyde</span>  (1903&#150;1991), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 12 May 1903 at the rectory in Bourton on the Water, Gloucestershire, the son of William Edward White, canon of Gloucester Cathedral, and his wife, Ethel Adelaide Drought. He was educated at Marlborough College, where he decided on an acting career&#151;his uncle was the actor J. Fisher White. He studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and made his stage d&eacute;but as Maitland in the Evans-Valentine hit comedy <span class="italic">Tons of Money</span> (1922) at Ryde, Isle of Wight, and his London d&eacute;but as a juror in <span class="italic">Beggar on Horseback</span> (1925) at the Queen's. On 17 December 1927 he married Blanche Hope Aitken (<i>b</i>. 1896/7), who used the stage name Blanche Glynne; they had one son. For a decade he was a busy stage actor, although with no successes of particular note, in the provinces and in London, touring in South Africa in 1932, and briefly as part of Tom Walls's company at the Aldwych. He made his film d&eacute;but in <span class="italic">Josser on the Farm</span> (1934) and there soon followed many minor, but often telling, film roles. He appeared exclusively on screen from 1936 to 1940, sometimes billed as Hyde White, in such films as <span class="italic">Rembrandt</span> (1936); <span class="italic">The Scarab Murder Case</span> (1936), a rare lead role as an unlikely Philo Vance; <span class="italic">Elephant Boy</span> (1937) as the commissioner; and <span class="italic">Poison Pen</span> (1939) as the postman. Through the 1940s he was equally occupied on stage and in films, being well-established in West End drama and comedy and with screen roles becoming larger. He made his New York d&eacute;but in 1947 as Sir Alec Dunne in <span class="italic">Under the Counter</span> at the Shubert. But it was Carol Reed's film <span class="italic">The Third Man</span> (1949), from Graham Greene's novella, which first got him noticed by a large audience; he played Crabbit, a bemused British cultural official in post-war Vienna.<br>
<br>White's debonair, often roguish charm was instantly recognizable; &#145;his unfailing imperturbability and unruffled acceptance of every eventuality made him an ideal choice for light comedy of the drawing room school&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 May 1991). He did, though, win further acting spurs in Olivier's Festival of Britain (1951) productions, <span class="italic">Caesar and Cleopatra</span> and <span class="italic">Antony and Cleopatra</span>, both at the St James's and the Ziegfeld, New York. And there were other stage successes, such as <span class="italic">Affairs of State</span> (1952) at the Cambridge, <span class="italic">Hippo Dancing</span> (1954) at the Lyric with lifetime friend Robert Morley, and, particularly, <span class="italic">The Reluctant Debutante</span> (1955), also at the Cambridge which, the following year in New York, earned him a Tony award nomination. He took over the part of the Marquess of Candover in <span class="italic">The Jockey Club Stakes</span> (1972) which, when repeated at the Cort, New York, early the following year, won him a second Tony nomination.<br>
<br>White was increasingly busy on screen, usually as lords, gentlemen, or conmen, often &#145;smallish roles which he somehow succeeded in making appear bigger&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 8 May 1991), such as <span class="italic">The Browning Version</span> (1951) as the headmaster, and in his own favourite role, as the bogus Reverend Fowler (alias &#145;Soapy&#146; Stevens) in <span class="italic">Two Way Stretch</span> (1960). In that year he was in Hollywood for <span class="italic">Let's Make Love</span> with Marilyn Monroe, and many films in the film capital followed. In particular he co-starred in <span class="italic">My Fair Lady</span> (1964) from the Lerner and Loewe musical as Colonel Pickering, the avuncular companion of Rex Harrison's Professor Higgins. It was a role which brought him international recognition.<br>
<br>After the death of his wife, in 1957 White married the American actress Ethel Korenman (stage name Ethel Drew). They had a son, the actor Alex Hyde White, and a daughter. From the mid-1960s, they lived in California. There were some final stage appearances, including <span class="italic">The Prodigal Daughter</span> (1973) in Washington and then on a UK tour, <span class="italic">An Ideal Husband</span> (1976) at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford, <span class="italic">Rolls-Royce</span> (1977) at the Shaftesbury, and, finally, in <span class="italic">Lady Windermere's Fan</span> again (1978), also at the Arnaud. But it was television movies and guest appearances which were to keep him busy from the late 1960s to the early 1980s. Very few were of particular note, but he invariably radiated droll good humour with an impeccable style. That style, supplemented by conversation punctuated with many a &#145;ho-ho&#146;, and &#145;dear fellow&#146;, and a tapping of the nose with the forefinger, had been expensive to maintain in real life, exemplified by Rolls-Royces, racehorses, and mistresses, which led to his being declared bankrupt in London in 1979. His wife left him and, chastened by the experience, he managed to give up his inveterate gambling on horses for a year, becoming even busier on television. His career was somewhat revived by the television series <span class="italic">The Associates</span> (1979), in which he played the senior partner of a New York law firm. His last film appearance was in the British/West German co-production <span class="italic">Fanny Hill</span> (1983).<br>
<br>In 1985 White became a resident of the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California, for his last few years being almost bedridden. He died on 6 May 1991 in Woodland Hills of congestive heart failure.<br>
