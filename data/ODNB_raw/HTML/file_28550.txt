<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wallack,  James William</span>  (1795&#150;1864), <span class="occ">actor</span>, born on 20 August 1795 at Hercules Buildings in Lambeth, London, was the second son of William Wallack (<i>d</i>. 1805) and his wife, Elizabeth Granger, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Field, an actress who had been a member of David Garrick's company for a time, and who died on 6 March 1850 at Clarendon Square, London, at the age of ninety. Both William and Elizabeth Wallack were well-known performers at Astley's Amphitheatre. Following in their footsteps, James William made his first appearance on stage at the age of four in the pantomime <span class="italic">Blue Beard</span> at the Royal Circus, afterwards known as the Surrey Theatre. His father originally intended him to have a naval career, but later allowed him to follow his own desires and take to the stage. At the age of twelve Wallack appeared with a troupe of the Academic Theatre in London and impressed Sheridan into obtaining him an engagement at Drury Lane. When the house burnt down in 1809 he went to the Royal Hibernian Theatre, Dublin, at the age of seventeen, to play Laertes to the Hamlet of R. W. Elliston. This was followed by roles such as Rob Roy, Rolla in <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>, Benedick in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span>, Petruchio in <span class="italic">The Taming of the Shrew</span>, Mercutio in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, and Iago in <span class="italic">Othello</span>, all of which were highly successful.<br>
<br>In 1817 Wallack eloped with and married Susan Johnstone (<i>d</i>. 1851), the daughter of the celebrated popular singer and Irish comic actor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14969/', "John Henry Johnstone")</script>, and then departed for the USA. He made his American d&eacute;but on 7 September 1818 as Macbeth, at the Park Theatre, New York, and went on to play in Boston and other American cities, mainly in a variety of Shakespearian roles. After a short season at Drury Lane in England in 1820, he continued with his theatrical career in New York. He received a compound fracture of the leg when a stagecoach in which he was travelling to Philadelphia was involved in an accident near Brunswick, and was slightly lame for the rest of his life. However, he adapted his career to his disability and appeared in New York in <span class="italic">The Birthday</span> in the role of an old sailor on crutches. On his return to England he became stage-manager in the autumn of 1823 under Elliston at Drury Lane Theatre, where he played Doricourt, Lovemore, Faulkland in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, Harry Dornton in Thomas Holcroft's <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span>, the original Earl of Leicester in <span class="italic">Kenilworth</span>, and other leading roles in comedy. He continued to portray Shakespearian characters too, and in 1827 was Iago to the Othello of Edmund Kean, whom he also supported in the roles of Edgar, Malcolm, and Macduff. He supported both Macready and Kean in such parts as Charalois in Philip Massinger's <span class="italic">The Fatal Dowry</span>, Valentine in Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>, and Charles Surface in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>.<br>
<br>Between 1827 and 1837 Wallack alternated between performances in England and America, his greatest hits being, in romantic drama, Allessandro Massani in J. R. Planch&eacute;'s adaptation of Scribe's <span class="italic">The Brigand</span> (1829) and, in domestic drama, Martin in Douglas Jerrold's <span class="italic">The Rent Day</span> (1832). In September 1837 he assumed management of the National Theatre, New York, the first of the four Wallack theatres, with his brother <a href="#cosubject_28548">Henry [<i>see below</i>]</a> as stage-manager. When the house burnt down in September 1839 he took over Niblo's Garden for a time. After appearing at London and Dublin in 1840 and touring America, he was seen for the first time at the Princess's Theatre, London, in October 1844, as the leading actor in a popular version of the famous French play <span class="italic">Don Caesar de Bazan</span>, by Gilbert &agrave; Beckett and Mark Lemon. He stayed on there as stage-manager until 1846. He spent the next five years in America, touring Philadelphia, Boston, and New Orleans. In 1851 he was once again in London, this time at the Haymarket. His wife's death that year grieved him greatly and brought on an illness, on his recovery from which he made his last appearance in England as St Pierre in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">The Wife</span>.<br>
<br>Back in New York in 1852, Wallack took over Brougham's Lyceum at Broadway and Broome Street. With his sons <a href="#cosubject_28550">(John Johnstone) Lester [<i>see below</i>]</a> and Charles, as stage-manager and treasurer, he opened it in September 1852 as Wallack's Theatre with Thomas Morton's <span class="italic">The Way to Get Married</span>. For nine years this second of the Wallack theatres flourished. Wallack played many roles himself, such as Sir Edward Mortimer in Colman's <span class="italic">The Iron Chest</span> and Shylock in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>. In 1861 he and his son Lester opened the new Wallack's Theatre at Broadway and 13th Street, and, most importantly, continued to provide opportunities for many new and young actors from England to make their d&eacute;but on the American stage. By this time Wallack had given up acting and was spending most of his leisure at The Hut, his country seat at Long Beach. At the close of the season in 1862 he spoke a farewell address, which was his last public appearance. His health declined rapidly, and he died in New York on 25 December 1864.<br>
<br>Wallack belonged to the school of Charles Kemble and appeared at his best in light comedy, his dark, handsome figure lending itself easily to romance. His performance in tragedy never achieved quite as much success but he was greatly admired in melodrama. His brother Henry John and his sisters Mary and Elizabeth also had a certain amount of success on the stage. Mary played at the Coburg Theatre, London, as Mrs Stanley, and made her American d&eacute;but at the Chatham Theatre, New York, in June 1827. However, she retired into private life after a couple of seasons, and died in New Orleans in 1834. Elizabeth, the only member of the family who never visited the United States, married an actor named Pincott and became the mother of Leonora, who in turn married the actor Alfred Wigan.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_28548"></a><span class="headword">Henry John Wallack</span>  (1790&#150;1870), the eldest son of William Wallack and Elizabeth Granger, and the elder brother of James William Wallack, born in London, was also a well-known <span class="occ">actor</span>. He made his first appearance on stage at the Surrey Theatre. He was more successful in America than in England, and made his American d&eacute;but in Baltimore in 1819. His first appearance in New York was in May 1821 at the Anthony Street Theatre, where he continued to play in tragedy and in heroic drama. His most popular roles were those of Rob Roy, Coriolanus, Brutus in <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, Captain Bertram in <span class="italic">Eternal Discord</span>, and Gambia in the opera <span class="italic">The Slave</span>. On this trip he was accompanied by his wife, the former Fanny Jones, a beautiful dancer. After the birth of their youngest daughter, Fanny, in 1822, his wife also became a dramatic actress, and was attached to the Park Theatre, New York, for about ten years. Following an extended tour of the country, Henry John Wallack became the leading man at the Chatham Garden Theatre in 1824. He returned to England in 1828 and remained at Covent Garden until 1832. He also appeared as Julius Caesar at Drury Lane in October 1829. His wife divorced him in 1833 and about a year later he married again. His second wife was a Liverpool-born singer named Maria Turpin, who had just joined the Covent Garden company, having appeared in London for the first time at the Haymarket in 1830 as Polly in <span class="italic">The Beggar's Opera</span>.<br>
<br>After spending the years 1834 to 1836 at Covent Garden as stage-manager and leading actor, Wallack went to New York once more in September 1837, as stage-manager of the National Theatre which his brother James William had opened there. In 1839 he gave several important performances against Edwin Forrest, notably as Iago to the latter's Othello. In the same year he and his wife began a long engagement at the New Chatham Theatre, where his two daughters Fanny and Julia also made their stage d&eacute;but, with their father in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">The Hunchback</span> (23 December 1839). The following summer Wallack returned to England, where he rented Covent Garden for a short, unsuccessful season in 1843. His next appearance was in New York, as Sir Peter Teazle in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> (September 1847), when the Wallacks opened the Broadway Theatre. Throughout that season his daughter Fanny was the leading lady. He himself played a varied repertory, his parts ranging from the chief Shakespearian heroes to Fagin in <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span>, Rolla in <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>, and Sir Anthony Absolute in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>. Thereafter he spent most of his time in the United States. He died in New York at the age of eighty, on 30 August 1870. Both his wives predeceased him: his first wife, Fanny, died in New Orleans in 1845, and his second wife, Maria, died of cancer in London on 18 July 1860.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_62390"></a><span class="headword">James William Wallack</span>  (1818&#150;1873), the son of Henry John Wallack and Fanny Wallack, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jones, affectionately referred to as Young Jim Wallack, became an extremely successful <span class="occ">actor</span>. He was born in London on 24 February 1818 and taken to the USA by his parents the following year. His first appearance on stage was at the age of four at the Chesnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia, playing the part of Cora's child with his uncle James William Wallack (1795&#150;1864) in <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>. He was educated at private schools in New York and England, and at the age of fourteen he became a call boy at the Bowery Theatre, New York, where he also played small parts. In 1835, after three years of touring England with various provincial companies, he joined his father, then stage-manager at Covent Garden. In 1837 he was engaged for the National Theatre, New York, by his uncle James William, who opened there in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, young James playing the role of Fag. By 1844 he had married at New Orleans a Mrs Ann Sefton (1815&#150;1879), formerly Ann Duff Waring, a tragic actress, who subsequently appeared with him in many plays. They had two children, who both died young. Among the more successful roles played by the younger James William in the next few years were Othello at the Haymarket, London, in 1851 and Macbeth at the Arch Street Theatre, Philadelphia, in 1852. In 1853 and 1855 he made attempts at management in London and Paris without much success. Afterwards he remained in the United States, where he built a highly successful and lucrative career. In 1865 he joined the stock company of his cousin Lester Wallack at the latter's theatre in New York, and in December 1867 he appeared for the first time in the role of Fagin in <span class="italic">Oliver Twist</span>. At Booth's Theatre, in the winter of 1872&#150;3, he made a good impression on the public as Mercutio in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>, Jaques in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, and other classic Shakespearian characters. Soon, however, he was forced by tuberculosis to retire from the stage. He died a few months later, on 24 May 1873, on a train near Aiken in South Carolina, where he had gone for the benefit of his health.<br>

<a name="cosubject_28550"></a><span class="headword">(John Johnstone) Lester Wallack</span>  (1820&#150;1888), <span class="occ">actor and playwright</span>, the son of James William Wallack (1795&#150;1864) and Susan Wallack, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Johnstone, was ultimately perhaps the best known of the family, though mainly in the United States. He was born in New York on 1 January 1820 and made his d&eacute;but as a professional actor in England as Angelo in <span class="italic">Tortesa the Usurer</span> around 1841. Initially in the provinces he took the stage name of Allan Field and then played as John Lester. In 1844 he became stage-manager at the Theatre Royal, Southampton, but left the following year for the Queen's Theatre, Manchester, to play Benedick in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> and Mercutio in <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span>. He did not get the chance to make an appearance in London until November 1846, when he played at the Haymarket Theatre. His American d&eacute;but was on 27 September 1847, as Sir Charles Coldstream in the farce <span class="italic">Used up</span> at the Broadway Theatre, New York, when he used the name John Wallack Lester. From then he built his career exclusively in the United States. Within a couple of years he had been successful in such varied roles as Captain Absolute in <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, Sir Frederick Blount in Bulwer-Lytton's <span class="italic">Money</span>, and Edmond Dantes in <span class="italic">The Count of Monte Cristo</span>, and had appeared at the Chatham and Bowery theatres as Don Caesar de Bazan and Dick Dashall and in other highly successful roles. His own dramatizations of Alexander Dumas&#151;<span class="italic">The Three Guardsmen</span> and <span class="italic">The Four Musketeers, or, Ten Years after</span>&#151;were produced at the Bowery Theatre in November. He played D'Artagnan and his cousin James William Wallack (1818&#150;1873) played Athos. In 1848 he had married Emily Millais; they had four children.<br>
<br>Wallack played with Burton's company at the Chambers Street Theatre for a while in such roles as Charles Surface in <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span>, Harry Dornton in <span class="italic">The Road to Ruin</span>, and Sir Andrew Aguecheek in <span class="italic">Twelfth Night</span>. He came into his own in September 1852 on Broadway at his father's reopening of Brougham's Lyceum as Wallack's Theatre. Here he had the opportunity to stage many of his own works, notably <span class="italic">Two to One, or, The King's Visit</span> (1854), <span class="italic">First Impressions</span> (1856), <span class="italic">The Veteran</span> (1859), and <span class="italic">Central Park</span> (1861), as well as to take the lead in many plays, such as Orlando in <span class="italic">As You Like It</span>, Bassanio in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, and Tom Dexter in Tom Taylor's <span class="italic">The Overland Route</span>. Wallack became more closely involved in management when this theatre was closed down and a new Wallack's Theatre was opened by his father, at the corner of Broadway and 13th Street, with Taylor's new comedy <span class="italic">The New President</span>, in which Wallack, playing La Rampe, appeared as Lester Wallack for the first time. He was active manager of this establishment from the beginning and became sole proprietor on his father's death in 1864. For more than fifteen years he ran the theatre with great fame and success, continuing his father's policy of encouraging both known and unknown British actors to make their first appearance on the American stage at his house. Towards the end, however, he was unable to compete with Booth's and Daly's theatres, and he closed down in 1881. He made one more effort at management in January 1882, when he opened the last of the Wallack theatres on Broadway and 30th Street; he was forced to transfer the lease in 1887, though the house retained the name of Wallack until 1896. Lester Wallack died at his country home near Stamford, Connecticut, on 6 September 1888, and was buried in Woodlawn cemetery on 9 September 1888. His <span class="italic">Memories of Fifty Years</span> was published posthumously in 1889. As actor and manager he was, for about forty years, one of the most prominent figures of the American stage, and much renowned also in England. With his death, the name of Wallack passed from the world of theatre.<br>
