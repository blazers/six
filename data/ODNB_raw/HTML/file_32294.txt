<span class="headword">Carman,  (William) Bliss</span>  (1861&#150;1929), <span class="occ">poet and essayist</span>, was born on 15 April 1861, in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, the eldest son of William Carman, a barrister: his mother, Sophia Mary, daughter of George Bliss, was related to Ralph Waldo Emerson. Carman's family background was United Empire loyalist. He wrote a few poems while studying at the collegiate school in Fredericton, and his first published efforts appeared in the monthly journal of the University of New Brunswick in 1879. He graduated from the university with an honours BA in Greek and Latin in 1881, spent an academic year visiting Oxford University and Edinburgh University in 1882&#150;3, and completed an MA degree in English literature at the University of New Brunswick in 1884. He studied for two years (1886&#150;8) at Harvard College, where he met Richard Hovey, a fellow poet who became an editorial collaborator and lifelong friend. At Harvard he studied under and was greatly influenced by Francis Child, Josiah Royce, and George Santayana, and he began publishing poems in magazines such as the <span class="italic">Harvard Monthly</span> and the <span class="italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>.<br>
<br>In the time between leaving Harvard and the publication of his first and very successful volume of poetry, <span class="italic">Low Tide on Grand Pr&eacute;: a Book of Lyrics</span> (1893), Carman moved continually between New York, Washington, D.C., Boston, Massachusetts, Fredericton, and Windsor, Nova Scotia&#151;and this became quite typical of his vagabond lifestyle. He made a modest income by performing editorial tasks for such publications as <span class="italic">The Independent</span>, <span class="italic">Current Literature</span>, <span class="italic">Cosmopolitan</span>, the <span class="italic">Boston Transcript</span>, the <span class="italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>, and <span class="italic">The Chap-Book</span>, the last of which he co-founded in 1894 with Hovey. He was alert to the literary issues of his time, and he wrote many literary, social commentary, and philosophical columns. Some of his work is gathered together in his prose selections, <span class="italic">The Kinship of Nature</span> (1903), <span class="italic">The Friendship of Art</span> (1904), <span class="italic">The Poetry of Life</span> (1905), and <span class="italic">The Making of Personality</span> (1906). These selections clearly display some of the marks of his late-Romantic biases, his interest in symbolist experimentation, his regard for traditional poetic forms, and his enthusiasm for the spiritually curative value of the unitarianism of Fran&ccedil;ois Delsarte (1811&#150;1870).<br>
<br>With the success of <span class="italic">Low Tide</span>, Carman was established as essentially a nature mystic and poet of the open road in the tradition of Walt Whitman, and he went on to publish more than thirty titles over the next twenty-five years, most of them exquisitely rendered perceptions of nature. Carman's many volumes include <span class="italic">Songs from Vagabondia</span> (1894), and <span class="italic">More Songs from Vagabondia</span> (1896), both collaborations with Richard Hovey. He also published <span class="italic">Ballads and Lyrics</span> (1902); <span class="italic">From the Book of Myths</span> (1902); <span class="italic">Sappho: one Hundred Lyrics</span> (1905); <span class="italic">Pipes of Pan</span> (definitive edition, 1906); <span class="italic">Later Poems</span> (1921); <span class="italic">Sanctuary: Sunshine House Sonnets</span> (1929); and <span class="italic">Wild Garden</span> (1929).<br>
<br>Carman spent much of his life in New England, travelled extensively across the North American continent, and in Europe, and in 1908 settled in New Canaan, Connecticut. He was unmarried, and his saint-like appearance and gentle character won for him many readers and advocates during his lifetime. It was at New Canaan that he died suddenly of heart failure on 8 June 1929. He was cremated, and his ashes interred on 20 August 1929 in Forest Hill cemetery, Fredericton, New Brunswick.<br>
<br>All of Carman's poetry is tissued through with a spiritual optimism, as he managed to avoid being overwhelmed by the ironic harvest of much modern verse. This in part accounts for the waning of his more learned readership during the early decades of the century, and the fact that only in the last decades of the twentieth century have a number of critics come to appreciate his strange uniqueness as an early twentieth-century poet, his musical brilliance, and his savvy as a social commentator.<br>
