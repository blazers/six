<span class="headword">Digby,  Everard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1605), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was a scion of the Digby family of Stoke Dry, Rutland, although not of its main branch as historians once believed. In later life he described his county of origin as Rutland, but he was possibly a son of John Digby (<i>d</i>. 1556) of Welby, Leicestershire, brought up by his cousins of Stoke Dry after his father's death. He first appears for certain in 1567 when he matriculated as a sizar (poor scholar) of St John's College, Cambridge, gaining a college scholarship in 1570 and a fellowship in 1574. He graduated BA in 1571, MA in 1574, and BD in 1581, was appointed as principal lecturer in the college in 1584, and was elected a senior fellow in 1585. After ordination as deacon in 1576, and probably as priest, he acquired parochial benefices which he held, until 1588, with his college post. These included the rectories of Lyndon, Rutland (1581&#150;2), Glaston, Rutland (1582&#150;1605), Hamstall Ridware, Staffordshire (1583&#150;6 and 1590&#150;1601), and Orton Longueville, Huntingdonshire (1593&#150;1605).<br>
<br>In 1579 Digby published in Latin <span class="italic">Theoria analytica</span>, an outline of knowledge and proposals for a method of research drawn from ancient philosophers, notably Aristotle, and from continental scholars of the sixteenth century, including Jacques Charpentier, Jacob Degen, and Nicolas de Grouchy. In it Digby attacked the methodology of Peter Ramus, the French protestant logician who had recently been killed in the St Bartholomew's day massacre. This provoked William Temple, fellow of King's College, Cambridge, to publish a defence of Ramus under the pseudonym <span class="italic">Francisci Mildapetti&#151;Navarrensi ad Everardum Digbeium Anglum</span> (1580)&#151;to which Digby replied with <span class="italic">Admonitioni F. Mildapetti responsio</span> (1580), dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton. A rejoinder was published by Temple under his own name, <span class="italic">Pro Mildapetti de unica methodo</span> (1580). The controversy had a religious as well as a philosophical significance: Ramus was a hero to protestants, and Temple represented Digby as a follower of medieval Catholic scholasticism.<br>
<br>Digby's next and most original publication was <span class="italic">De arte natandi</span> (1587), a Latin treatise on swimming. The Swiss writer Nicholas Wynman had written a dialogue on the subject, <span class="italic">Colymbetes</span> (1538), which Digby's treatise resembled in discussing the history and value of the art, but he surpassed Wynman by systematically describing a large number of strokes, feats, and manoeuvres. The text was illustrated by forty-three detailed woodcuts, making the treatise also a landmark in the use of pictures to convey techniques. An abridgement in English by Christopher Middleton, entitled <span class="italic">A Short Introduction for to Learne to Swimme</span>, appeared in 1595 with the same woodcuts, and Digby's work was copied by other writers on swimming in the seventeenth century, notably Melchisedech Thevenot, whose <span class="italic">L'art de nager</span> (Paris, 1696) drew extensively on <span class="italic">De arte natandi</span> and reissued its illustrations in updated form. Since Thevenot's work circulated in both France and England until the late eighteenth century, Digby may be said to have influenced the understanding and teaching of swimming for the next 200 years.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1587 Digby became involved in a disagreement about the payment of college dues. He refused to pay in the manner demanded, and was declared to have forfeited his fellowship by the master of St John's, William Whitaker, in January 1588. This dispute, too, involved religious prejudices. Whitaker was a strong protestant and suspected Digby of Roman Catholic sympathies, alleging that he had &#145;inveighed against Calvinists&#146;, &#145;never preach[ed] any sermons more than of necessity he must&#146;, and &#145;delivered nothing almost but magical, suspicious and popish conceits of angels&#146;  (Lake, 172). He also accused him of being insubordinate, coarse, and over-indulgent in outdoor pursuits. Contemptuously refuting the charges, and affirming his support for the oath of supremacy, the articles of religion, and the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, Digby appealed to the college visitors, Lord Burghley and Archbishop Whitgift, who restored him in May 1588, but Whitaker enlisted the help of the earl of Leicester and Digby vacated his fellowship on 29 September (it is not clear whether voluntarily or by compulsion). He left Cambridge and finally lived at Orton Longueville. In 1590 he published his last book, <span class="italic">Everard Digbie his Dissuasive</span> &#145;from taking away the livings and goods of the Church&#146;, a work in English lamenting the ruin of religious buildings, the misappropriation of church endowments, and the avarice to acquire what remained in the hands of bishops and cathedrals. The work emits a sense of bitterness and exile. Digby died in 1605, at about the time of the Gunpowder Plot, which involved his namesake and kinsman Sir Everard Digby of Stoke Dry, but the cause and place of his death and burial are not known.<br>
