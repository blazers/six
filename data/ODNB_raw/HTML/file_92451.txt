<span class="headword">Lannoy,  Ghillebert  de</span>  (1386&#150;1462), <span class="occ">soldier and diplomat</span>, was the second son of Ghillebert de Lannoy, seigneur of Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1406), and his wife, Catherine de Molembaix (<i>d</i>. 1433). Until he was thirty the younger Ghillebert, who became seigneur of Willerval, led the life of a hyperactive devotee of the chivalric ethos, pursuing connections which linked his own native milieu of Walloon Flanders and Hainault with the wider political world in which the <i>noblesse</i> of the Scheldt valley had become involved during the Hundred Years' War. After dabbling in the local feuds of his relatives he joined the expedition which Waleran de Luxembourg, count of St Pol, led against the Isle of Wight in 1403. In 1404 he enlisted in the force raised by Jacques de Bourbon, count of La Marche, in aid of Owain Glyn D&#373;r, which sacked Falmouth but was then thwarted by the channel winds. While he waited in frustrated inactivity at Brest, Lannoy and his mentor Jean de Werchin, <i>s&eacute;n&eacute;chal</i> of Hainault, engaged in an exercise in erotic therapy by composing forty-six <i>ballades</i>. The next ten years were predominantly given to travelling and fighting. In 1405&#150;6 he went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem, in 1407 and 1410 he jousted and crusaded respectively in Spain, and in 1413 he campaigned with the Teutonic order. Dubbed a knight in the Baltic, he went to Narna and Novgorod disguised as a merchant before returning home in summer 1414 with letters from the king of Poland to the king of France. With scarcely a pause he then set off westwards for Ireland, on &#145;le voyage de saint Patrice&#146;, but instead had to be extricated from capture by persons unknown by a grant of 3000 francs from the duke of Burgundy. In 1415 his luck was no better: fighting on the French side at the battle of Agincourt, he was wounded and taken prisoner to England. His release this time involved the payment of 1200 <i>&eacute;cus d'or</i> to Sir John Cornewall, later Baron Fanhope.<br>
<br>Lannoy emerged from this eventful apprenticeship as a prominent servant of the dukes of Burgundy, who since the 1380s had by inheritance and assertion become the paramount territorial princes in the area where the Lannoy family interests lay: by 1406 Ghillebert's elder brother Hue was a <i>chambellan</i> (the highest ranking household servant) to Duke John the Fearless, and Ghillebert himself entered the ducal household as <i>&eacute;chanson</i> (cupbearer) in 1411&#150;12, becoming <i>chambellan</i> and <i>conseiller</i> in 1416 to the duke's heir, Philip (the future Duke Philip the Good), who was then acting as his father's representative in Flanders and Artois. As well as holding these positions until his death, Lannoy was also captain of the key port of Sluys from 1416 to 1446, while in 1421 he acted as interim head of the ducal household. Initially he had particular responsibility concerning &#145;divines provisions&#146; for Philip; more generally, he and his family network were active in formulating and implementing ducal policy, not least in fashioning the Anglo-Burgundian alliance as the nucleus of the Lancastrian &#145;dual monarchy&#146; of England and France. In 1419&#150;20, as well as fighting in the French war, Lannoy acted as one of the Burgundian envoys negotiating the treaty of Troyes.<br>
<br>In the years which followed, although it was Hue de Lannoy who was most active as a cross-channel go-between, Ghillebert's experience as a traveller was exploited for the furtherance of Anglo-Burgundian policy. Between 1421 and 1423 he went on behalf of Duke Philip and Henry V on his most elaborately extended journey, overland across Germany to the courts of Prussia, Poland, Lithuania, and Wallachia, and then by sea from Kaffa in the Crimea to Constantinople, as their accredited envoy to these fellow Christian princes. Prevented by the death of the Ottoman sultan Mahmoud I from presenting him with Henry V's gift of a golden clock, Lannoy proceeded in more discreet style, with just two companions, via Rhodes and Crete to mameluk Egypt and Syria, on a tour of military reconnaissance which gave special attention to the ports usable for crusading purposes. Having returned to Europe via Rhodes and Venice, he presented his report (together with the undelivered clock) to the English council in London; he also took the opportunity to confess to Cardinal Henry Beaufort that at the outset he had fraudulently secured double payment of his &pound;200 travel allowance (twenty years later he was still sufficiently burdened by remorse to secure Henry VI's personal forgiveness for the lapse, formally recorded in letters patent under the great seal).<br>
<br>Lannoy's next mission took him in 1428 to the courts of Hungary and Germany to discuss the planned Anglo-Burgundian intervention (to be led by Cardinal Beaufort) in the crusade against the Bohemian Hussites. In January 1430, with his brothers Hue and Baudouin, he was listed among the original twenty-four members of the order of the Golden Fleece, while later that year he was sent as an envoy to Scotland, for purposes which remain obscure. His often cryptic reminiscences of his travels suggest&#151;as one might perhaps expect&#151;that military and chivalric considerations were uppermost in his mind, and ethnographers may regret that his impulse was not directed by a less restricted curiosity. He noted that the towns of northern England, like Newcastle, Berwick, and Carlisle, were all fortified, whereas those of southern Scotland had been left without walls; Dunbar, he remarked, had been wasted by war. He also commented on the Arthurian associations of some of the places he passed: on Bamburgh, where the castle was said to be Sir Lancelot's &#145;Joyeuse Garde&#146;; and on Stirling, where the very fine castle had been built by King Arthur himself. On his way south Lannoy could not resist the urge to cross from Lancashire to Drogheda, and from there achieve his long-delayed visit to St Patrick's Purgatory on Lough Derg, Donegal. The poverty of the island impressed him, especially once he had crossed the boundary between the lands under the English king's allegiance and those of the native &#145;Escos sauvaiges&#146;  (Potvin, 169). He returned through the English midlands to the channel coast, passing through Lichfield, where he was struck by the beauty of the cathedral. Two years later, in 1433, Lannoy went as Burgundian envoy to the general council of Basel. And in the intervals between these diplomatic missions he fulfilled the other duties of a ducal <i>chambellan</i>, serving in arms in 1425&#150;7 to secure possession of Hainault and Holland, in the duke's expedition to meet the duke of Bedford in Paris in 1429, and in the force raised to suppress insurgency in Cassel in 1431.<br>
<br>After Duke Philip's decision to end his Lancastrian alliance and allegiance in 1435, Lannoy's diplomatic activity lessened, possibly due to family preoccupations. His first marriage, in 1418, to El&eacute;onore d'Esquennes, widow of Jean, seigneur of Montigny-en-Ostrevent, proved childless; his second, in 1428, to Jeanne de Ghistelles, produced his son and heir Philippe (<i>d</i>. 1495). In 1436, after Jeanne's death, Lannoy fulfilled a vow of pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. By 1445, when he bought a house in Lille, he had married Isabel van Drinckam (<i>d</i>. 1453), with whom he had three surviving children: Jean (<i>d</i>. 1453), Pierre (<i>d</i>. 1510), and Marguerite (<i>d</i>. 1479). Besides domesticity, the captaincy of Sluys&#151;no sinecure, given the febrile condition of Flanders in these years&#151;continued to require his attention, until, aged sixty, he resigned the office on appointment to his final diplomatic mission, when he was sent in 1446 to present the Fleece to Alfonso the Magnanimous of Aragon, newly triumphant in Naples and vying with Duke Philip for primacy among crusade protagonists. The embassy was extended into Ghillebert's farewell performance as <i>Foliant de Yonnal</i> (&#145;Lannoy the wanderer&#146;, in his anagrammatic self-designation), a leisurely, nostalgic pilgrimage with his eldest son to Jerusalem via Sicily, Crete, Cyprus, and Rhodes, rounded off in 1450 by a visit to Rome for the papal jubilee.<br>
<br>Lannoy died on 22 April 1462, and was buried in the church of St Maurice in Lille. It was probably in the 1430s and 1440s, if not in the twelve years preceding his death (for which there is no record of other activity), that he produced much of his considerable literary output; but writing had been a constant accompaniment to his whole career. Verse he seems to have abandoned after the age of eighteen, and if in his juvenile <i>ballades</i> his syntax proved inadequate for the expression of his feelings, his prose composition developed a trenchant effectiveness, and some of it for a time commanded a widespread readership in courtly circles. The two most polished treatises for which his authorship is generally accepted are the <span class="italic">Enseignements paternels</span> and <span class="italic">Instruction d'un jeune prince</span> (printed at Paris, 1517); a third, interdependent treatment of the same themes of the moral issues and governing necessities confronting chivalric careerists and their princely employers, the <span class="italic">Enseignement de vraie noblesse</span>, has been ascribed on stylistic grounds sometimes to him, sometimes to his brother Hue (the closeness of their relations making it difficult to discriminate between their respective claims to authorship). A number of Ghillebert's <i>advis</i> also survive in a family manuscript Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris, MS fr. 1278 containing <i>m&eacute;moires</i> by his brother Hue. A second family manuscript preserves, along with his &#145;report&#146; on his 1421&#150;3 reconnaissance mission, his reminiscences of his travels jotted down at different dates in his own hand, and assembled after his death by his chaplain. It is emblematic of Lannoy's international outlook, in both his career and his writings, that in his <span class="italic">Enseignements paternels</span> he should have chosen as an example of knightly valour the death of Sir Lewis Robsart, a Hainaulter by birth but also a household servant and banner-bearer of Henry V and a knight of the order of the Garter, who was killed at the head of an English force in northern France in 1430 when he could have retreated, but preferred to die &#145;to safeguard the honour of that order and also his own&#146;  (Potvin, 458). All in all, if Lannoy's life testifies to the enterprising drive of the late medieval lay nobility, his <i>oeuvre</i> conveys much of its vigorous political and chivalric culture.<br>
