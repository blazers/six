<span class="headword">Markham,  Francis</span>  (1565&#150;1627), <span class="occ">soldier</span>, was born on 25 July 1565, the second son of Robert Markham, landowner, of Cotham, Nottinghamshire, and Mary, daughter of Sir Francis Leake. He was a page in the service of the earl of Pembroke before spending ten years at Winchester College. He briefly studied under the famous Dutch Calvinist theologian Adrian de Saravia before being sent to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1582. He quarrelled with a tutor, however, and in 1583 made his first trip to the Netherlands, where he served as a gentleman volunteer in an English regiment. His father did not approve of his abandoning university and cut off his allowance. In 1587 they were reconciled, but Robert Markham allowed his son to return to the Dutch wars in the royal expedition sent to attempt to relieve Sluys. Markham then returned to England and in 1588 entered Staple's Inn, from which he moved in February 1589 to Gray's Inn, where his father had been a member. <br>
<br>In his memoirs Francis claimed that he had to leave his studies because of lack of funds, but it was also the case that only a year after being admitted to Gray's Inn he was one of seventeen gentlemen who were &#145;put out of the fellowship &hellip; for their abuse in outrageous manner&#146; at about two or three o'clock on the morning of 4 February 1590  (Fletcher, 87). His father's patron, the earl of Shrewsbury, obtained for him a place in Sir Robert Sidney's garrison in Flushing. He later moved to Germany, serving a season in the army of Christian of Anhalt, a militant Calvinist, before returning&#151;perhaps initially home, but certainly to the Netherlands, where he stayed with the Dutch Anglophile humanist Carolus Clusius in Leiden in early 1594. This was <i>en route</i> for Heidelberg, where&#151;presumably to satisfy his parents&#151;he went to study civil law. But Markham enjoyed law no more in Heidelberg than in London and returned home that summer. <br>
<br>Markham now joined the household of the earl of Shrewsbury, with an annual pension of &pound;20, but in 1599 he went back to the wars, as a captain in the army led to Ireland by the earl of Essex. His association with Essex &#145;crossed&#146; his career, as he later recalled  (Markham, 36). He bought a home, meaning to settle down, yet instead he went back to the Netherlands and served in the Dutch army in 1602&#150;3. The death of the queen induced him to try for a place at court, but the involvement of his cousin Sir Griffin Markham in a Catholic plot against James I disgraced the family. Shortly afterwards he was imprisoned for fifteen weeks for debt, securing release only through the good offices of old military friends such as Sir Francis Vere, Robert, Lord Sidney, and another old Essex man, the earl of Rutland, whose son, Lord Ros, Markham tutored on a trip through France. On 3 January 1609 he married Mary Lovel (<i>b</i>. 1594, <i>d</i>. in or after 1616). They had at least two children. Markham may have fought in the J&uuml;lich&#150;Cleves War of 1610 but finally settled in Nottingham on his appointment in 1612 as muster-master of that city. <br>
<br>Markham was clearly committed to the international protestant cause&#151;he chose carefully whom he fought for, and he had a strong interest in military affairs. As a writer he was a greater stylist, though much less prolific, than his more celebrated sibling, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18065/', "Gervase Markham (1568?&#150;1637)")</script>. The main source for his life is the &#145;Genealogy or petigree of Markham&#146; that he composed some time between 1601 and 1622, which includes a brief autobiographical memoir. In addition, material can be gleaned from his two books <span class="italic">Five Decades of Epistles of Warre</span> (1622), dedicated to Prince Charles, and <span class="italic">The Booke of Honour, or, Five Decads of Epistles of Honour</span> (1625), dedicated to him as king. Both are in the form of five collections, each of ten epistles on subjects relating to war and honour, each epistle being dedicated to a nobleman or bishop. The prose style is lucid and elegant, if a touch florid, though both books are somewhat derivative, revealing (if nothing else) their author's acquaintance with a range of classical and Renaissance literature. However, they are also sprinkled with observations drawn from Markham's personal experience. <span class="italic">Epistles of Warre</span> contains the greater number of these, and partly as a result, is the more original and interesting work for, as he observed in the epistle dedicatory, &#145;War hath been ever my Mistrese&#146;  (sig. A3<i>r</i>). Markham died intestate in 1627.<br>
