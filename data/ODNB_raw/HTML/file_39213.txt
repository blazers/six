<span class="headword">Cynehelm</span> <span class="st"> [St Cynehelm, Kenelm]</span>  (<em>supp. </em><em>fl. </em>803<span class="mult">x</span>11), <span class="occ">martyr</span>, is the subject of an elaborate <i>passio</i> (account of martyrdom) which can be dated on internal evidence to the years 1045&#150;75, although purportedly drawing on English songs and writings. According to this <i>passio</i>, he was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37273/', "King Cenwulf of Mercia (d. 821)")</script>, to whose throne he succeeded as a boy of seven years. His sister <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54441/', "Cwenthryth")</script> instigated his tutor &AElig;scberht to kill him. While hunting with the child in a wood on 17 July, &AElig;scberht beheaded and buried him at Clent (in what is now Worcestershire). Cwenthryth acceded to the kingdom; but a dove miraculously delivered to Pope Leo III (<i>r</i>. 795&#150;816) a parchment inscribed in English to the effect that Cynehelm was buried decapitated under a thorn tree at Clent. The pope accordingly sent legates to Wulfred, archbishop of Canterbury, and the other English bishops to have Cynehelm's body recovered and enshrined. In the event, the body was taken to Winchcombe and, as the procession bearing it approached that church, Cwenthryth stood at a window reciting the psalter backwards by way of a curse, for which she was punished by having both eyes drop out on to the page, the blood-stained psalter being later displayed at Winchcombe.<br>
<br>This <i>passio</i>, although interesting as a work of hagiography, is factually unreliable. There was indeed a person called Cynehelm who appears in the witness lists of a number of reliable early charters, one granted by King Cuthred of Kent, the remainder by King Cenwulf of Mercia. If the Cynehelm of these charters in any way inspired the legend of the child-martyr, the details of his life must have diverged radically from those imputed to him in the <i>passio</i>. The documents, which designate Cynehelm <i>princeps</i> or <i>dux</i>, date from 803 to 811 and so make it impossible that he could have succeeded Cenwulf at the age of seven. (William of Malmesbury translated into Latin a document purporting to be an English translation of a papal confirmation in 798 of the monastery of Glastonbury to &#145;King Kinelm&#146;, but it is very doubtful if this is a correct record.) Moreover, the <span class="roman">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span> makes it clear that Cenwulf was immediately succeeded by Ceolwulf, making no mention of Cynehelm. Further, it gives the date of Cenwulf's death as 819 (821 is in fact correct) and this date is found also in the <i>passio</i>, suggesting that the author of that work was using the chronicle to provide a plausible context for his narrative.<br>
<br>That Cynehelm was indeed venerated as a saint by the early eleventh century is shown by an entry in the later section of the list of saints' resting places, <span class="italic">Secgan be &thorn;am godes sanctum &thorn;e on Engla lande &#339;rost reston</span> (&#145;Concerning God's saints who formerly rested in England&#146;), which dates from that period. The entry states that Kenelm, referred to as &#145;royal child&#146; (<i>cynebearn</i>), rests at Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, a monastery founded by the Mercian kings in the late eleventh century  (Liebermann, 19). Winchcombe was restored as a Benedictine monastery by Oswald, bishop of Worcester (961&#150;92), and it is likely that he was responsible for promoting Cynehelm's cult there. Certainly the martyr's feast day on 17 July appears in calendars from the third quarter of the tenth century, and in the sacramentary of Fleury (Orl&eacute;ans, Biblioth&egrave;que Municipale, MS 127 (105)), which was probably written at Winchcombe at about the same time, he has proper prayers and mass and is prominent among the martyrs. As noted above, the saint's <i>passio</i> was in existence by the mid-eleventh century, and a series of versions is found in later manuscripts and compilations as well as in the works of twelfth-century historical writers such as William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester. From that time onwards, Cynehelm became a widely known saint, commemorated at various ecclesiastical centres, and more popularly by an Old English couplet relating to his place of burial: &#145;In Clent Cow-valley, Kenelm king's son lies under a thorn-bush deprived of his head&#146;  (Love, 67). By the fourteenth century, his cult was sufficiently familiar to be alluded to in Chaucer's <span class="italic">Canterbury Tales</span>.<br>
