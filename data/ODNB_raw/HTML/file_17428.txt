<span class="headword">Macdonald,  Archibald</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Benedict]</span>  (1739&#150;1814), <span class="occ">Benedictine monk and author</span>, was born at Lochaber, Inverness, Scotland, the son of the Jacobite Ranald Macdonald (<i>d</i>. 1745) and his wife, Mary Cameron. He was educated at St Gregory's, Douai, and joined the Benedictine community there in September 1756. He was the first Benedictine monk to serve the mission of St Mary's, Liverpool, in 1783, and from here he founded the Benedictine mission of St Peter's, Seel Street, Liverpool, five years later.<br>
<br>Despite a busy (and at times controversial) pastoral life Macdonald published some literary works which had an extensive local circulation in their day and which represented a significant contribution to English Catholic devotional writing in the late eighteenth century. These included a number of small booklets designed to enhance the liturgy, which were popular with Benedictine missioners in the latter part of the century, and like contemporary Cisalpine authors he favoured a vernacular Catholic liturgy. Macdonald believed in the importance of congregational participation in Sunday afternoon devotions, arguing in the preface to one of his booklets (<span class="italic">The Layman's Afternoon Devotion</span>, 1778) that it was &#145;equally pleasing to God and more edifying to the people when able to join their pastor with one voice as St. Chrysostom observes&#146;  (Gillow, <span class="italic">Lit. biog. hist.</span>, 4.370). Macdonald's Jacobite sympathies caused a fellow monk to advise against his appointment as chaplain to the Towneley family at Standish in Lancashire, observing that he had &#145;too much of the North-Britton&#146;  (Bulmer to Nayler).<br>
<br>Macdonald is notable for his defence of the authenticity of James Macpherson's edition of the poems of Ossian against the attacks of Dr Johnson and Malcolm Laing. Macdonald himself translated some of Ossian's lesser poems in 1805, and in 1808 published <span class="italic">Fingal: an Epic Poem Rendered into Verse</span>. He also published <span class="italic">A Companion to the Altar, or, Prayers for Morning and Afternoon Service, on Sundays and Holydays</span> (1792), <span class="italic">Moral Essays, Chiefly Collected from Different Authors</span> (2 vols., 1796), and <span class="italic">Select Discourses on the Gospels for All the Sundays and Holydays throughout the Year</span> (1801). Macdonald was a controversial figure who continually quarrelled with any monks who were appointed to assist him. Paradoxically, given that he was a prolific writer, he was accused by his superiors of being a poor communicator. Despite this he was honoured by his brethren with the offices of definitor of the regimen in 1806 and cathedral prior of Rochester in 1810. He died at St Peter's, Seel Street, Liverpool, on 29 July 1814.<br>
