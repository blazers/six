<span class="headword">Evans,  Thomas</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Telynog]</span>  (1840&#150;1865), <span class="occ">Welsh-language poet</span>, was born at Cardigan on 8 September 1840, the son of Thomas Evans, ship carpenter. His early education was very rudimentary. At the age of eleven he was apprenticed on a coasting vessel, but his treatment was so bad that he ran away to Aberd&acirc;r and worked in a coalmine in Cwm-bach. From here he sent a letter to his mother, written in verse (his first attempt), apprising her of his whereabouts.<br>
<br>When Evans was about fifteen he devoted his leisure hours to music and attracted public attention as a singer. Shortly after this he competed successfully at a small eisteddfod, held at his chapel, for the best poem on humility. This brought him to public notice, and from this time his name was constantly in the local papers and mentioned in connection with eisteddfodau, where, under the bardic name Telynog, he won no fewer than twenty prizes. His achievement is all the more marked when one considers that during all this time he was working as a collier. His last six years were spent in constant battle first with dyspepsia, and then with consumption. He died on 29 April 1865 and was buried in the Aberd&acirc;r cemetery. At the time of his death &#145;he was regarded as one of the most promising poets of Wales&#146;  (<span class="italic">DWB</span>).<br>
<br>Evans's poetical works, including the lyrics &#145;Blodeuyn bach wyf fi mewn gardd&#146; and &#145;Yr haf&#146;, were collected and arranged by Dafydd Morganwg, and published by subscription in a limited edition. The volume was prefaced by a brief memoir by Howel Williams.<br>
