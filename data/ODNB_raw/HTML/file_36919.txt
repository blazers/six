<span class="headword">Williams,  Edward Francis</span>, Baron Francis-Williams  (1903&#150;1970), <span class="occ">author and publicist</span>, was born on 10 March 1903 at St Martins, Shropshire, where his father, John Edmund Williams, had a farm. His mother was Sally Francis, from Montgomery, just across the border in Wales. His schooling was entirely in Lancashire, where his father moved first as a dairyman in Manchester, then back to farming on the moors between Bacup and Todmorden, where Francis and his sister attended school at Rawtenstall. Shortly after the outbreak of war in 1914 the family moved to a better farm at Middleton, where Williams completed his formal education at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School. While there two of his poems were accepted by <span class="italic">Country Life</span> and the <span class="italic">Weekly Westminster Gazette</span>, an eccentric enough occurrence for the school to encourage his inclination to be a journalist.<br>
<br>At the age of seventeen, in response to an advertisement, Williams joined the weekly <span class="italic">Bootle Times</span>, then housed in a two-roomed wooden building adjoining the railway station. There, as an impressionable young reporter, the unemployment in the Merseyside docks and the conditions in the slums impelled him to join the Independent Labour Party. At the same period he forsook religion and became a lifelong humanist. He secured a post on the Liverpool <span class="italic">Daily Courier</span> but was impatient to get to Fleet Street and on to a national paper. With a colleague on the <span class="italic">Courier</span> he decided to buy a horse and caravan and describe a journey through England. The only London newspaper which was interested was the Labour <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, edited by George Lansbury, with a small circulation but a prestigious set of contributors. For two articles a week, the travellers were paid 4 guineas.<br>
<br>There was, however, no staff appointment when Williams arrived in London at the end of the series in 1922, and he earned a fickle living as a freelance until he secured a part-time job on the <span class="italic">Sunday Express</span>. There he attracted the attention of Lord Beaverbrook when he mastered a couple of Clydesdale horses which had bolted outside the <span class="italic">Express</span> office in the commotion of the general strike of 1926. In the same year Williams married Jessie Melville Hopkin, whom he had first met when she became an English teacher at his old school. She became a distinguished medical psychologist. They had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Following an article which Williams had written on the controversial sculpture <span class="italic">Rima</span> by Jacob Epstein, Beaverbrook later, and inconsequentially, appointed him as a financial reporter and personally commended him to the moneyed men of the City. To Beaverbrook's chagrin, when Odhams the publishers in 1929 took over the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span>, of which the Trades Union Congress retained a minority interest and Labour Party control, Williams accepted the post of City editor. During the depression and the financial crisis which brought down the Labour government he became a significant figure, influential with hostile financiers, with access even to Montagu Norman, the redoubtable governor of the Bank of England, and, during his commodity market exposures of the rearming of Germany, a confidant of Winston Churchill.<br>
<br>In 1936 Williams became editor of the <span class="italic">Daily Herald</span> at a salary of &pound;5000. The paper soon reached a circulation of 2 million, a figure which was itself an embarrassment because, in the paradoxical economics of the newspaper business, it was not drawing the advertising to sustain it. Lord Southwood, the chairman of Odhams, wanted a lively paper glowing with an optimism about world events which would encourage trade and therefore advertising. He expected Williams, as Beaverbrook's former prot&eacute;g&eacute;, to respond. His editor insisted upon treating events, which were goose-stepping to Munich and the Second World War, with the seriousness they deserved. He had the support of the Trades Union Congress members on the policy board, including Ernest Bevin and Sir Walter Citrine. But Southwood tried to use financial sanctions to make him dispense with the foreign correspondents who were sending the pessimistic dispatches. Even the outbreak of war did not curb the interference. The break came in 1940 when Williams opened the paper and found that his signed weekly article was missing, removed on Southwood's instructions. He resigned.<br>
<br>Williams took the opportunity to write a book, <span class="italic">War by Revolution</span> (1940), on the theme of his banned article, and <span class="italic">Democracy's Last Battle</span> (1941). He became a member of the morale committee of the Ministry of Information, and when Brendan Bracken became minister he was appointed in 1941 controller of press and censorship. In that invidious position (the more so because he was the buffer between Churchill and the press, whose criticism Churchill resented) he made censorship tolerable, or at least understandable, to the British and foreign correspondents, gaining their co-operation and respect which persisted after the war when he became a world advocate of press freedom. He went with the British delegation in 1945 to the San Francisco conference where his methods of handling the world press&#151;confidentiality in return for frankness&#151;were a new experience for most journalists. In the same year he was appointed CBE and awarded the United States medal of freedom with silver leaves for his war services.<br>
<br>When Labour came to power after the war the prime minister, Clement Attlee, asked Williams to be his public relations adviser. He relied implicitly on Williams and in his meetings with President Truman and others left the communiqu&eacute;s and press conferences entirely to his discretion. When the secretary-general of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, visited Attlee in London to ask him to release Williams to become assistant secretary-general in charge of public information, Attlee told him that Williams had undertaken to stay with him for at least a year and would not go back on his word.<br>
<br>In the event Williams stayed two years in Downing Street; went next to Washington as correspondent of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>; then returned to London as a columnist on the <span class="italic">News Chronicle</span>. He started a column in the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> called &#145;Fleet Street&#146; which ran for fourteen years and gave the public an insight into the workings of the press which they had never had before. He also tried, unsuccessfully, to make the socialist <span class="italic">Forward</span> into a prosperous journal.<br>
<br>In 1951&#150;2 Williams was a governor of the BBC. He had been a frequent broadcaster since the thirties and he went on to become a television personality on a diversity of programmes. He dominated the small screen. The adjective &#145;leonine&#146; could properly apply to him. His mane, his jowls, his wary look, his crouching shoulders were disconcerting to &#145;victims&#146; in interrogation programmes but the impression would disappear in his twinkle, his smile, his laugh, and the lighting of the pipe which was his trade mark. Then the warmth of his personality, reflecting years of happy family life and a concern for others, would radiate.<br>
<br>Williams's reputation as an authority on the media was worldwide. He was British representative on the United Nations Commission on Freedom of Information (1949), wrote <span class="italic">Transmitting News</span> (1953) for UNESCO, and was Regents' professor at the University of California in 1961 and Kemper Knapp professor at the University of Wisconsin in 1967.<br>
<br>Williams was much sought after as a Labour candidate but his ambitions did not lie in parliament or in government office. When Hugh Gaitskell prevailed upon him to become a life peer in 1962 he became an assiduous back-bencher. But his main activity after the end of the war lay in writing; his publications during this period included <span class="italic">Press, Parliament and People</span> (1946), <span class="italic">The Triple Challenge: the Future of Socialist Britain</span> (1948), <span class="italic">Fifty Years' March: the Rise of the Labour Party</span> (1946), <span class="italic">Ernest Bevin: Portrait of a Great Englishman</span> (1952), <span class="italic">Magnificent Journey, the Rise of Trade Unions</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Dangerous Estate: the Anatomy of Newspapers</span> (1957), <span class="italic">A Prime Minister Remembers</span> (with Earl Attlee, 1961), <span class="italic">The American Invasion</span> (1962), and <span class="italic">A Pattern of Rulers</span> (1965). He was a persistent novelist (<span class="italic">No Man is an Island</span>, 1945; <span class="italic">A Provincial Affair</span>, 1949; and <span class="italic">The Richardson Story</span>, 1951) whose fiction was better appreciated by the critics than by the customers. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Nothing so Strange</span>, was published shortly before he died at his home, Griffins, Abinger Hammer, Dorking, Surrey, on 5 June 1970. In it Williams recorded a comment made about him by two American newspapermen, adding that it would be a fine thing to put on one's tombstone their remark that &#145;The guy had grammar&#146;  (Williams, 327), an epitaph which he had fully earned both as a writer and as a speaker. He was a literary craftsman whose fluent style survived the paragraphics of the popular press. His wit was caustic and his humour emollient. He was survived by his wife.<br>
