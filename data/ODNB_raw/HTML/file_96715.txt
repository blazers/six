<span class="headword">Bromilow,  William Edward</span>  (1857&#150;1929), <span class="occ">missionary</span>, was born at Geelong, Victoria, Australia, on 15 January 1857, the son of Thomas Bromilow, bricklayer, and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Owen. He matriculated at the age of fourteen from Grenville College, Ballarat, then taught at the Queenscliff state school in 1876&#150;7. While teaching he also enrolled at the University of Melbourne, but the double strain on his health meant that he did not take a degree. At the age of twenty-one he was accepted as a probationer for the ministry of the Methodist Church of Australasia and while serving in the Wimmera district in western Victoria he volunteered as a missionary. He married Harriet Lilly Thomson, daughter of American immigrants to Geelong, in Sydney, on 9 April 1879. In the same month he was ordained and sailed with his wife on the <i>John Wesley</i> from Sydney to Fiji. He spent ten years in Fiji&#151;at Taveuni, Lomaloma, and Rewa&#151;learning Fijian and becoming skilled in scripture translation.<br>
<br>In 1889 Bromilow returned to work in Victoria, but after two years as a circuit minister and foreign mission secretary he again volunteered for mission work. This time it was as leader of the new Australian Methodist mission in the eastern archipelagoes of the recently annexed possession of British New Guinea. On 19 June 1891, accompanied by the administrator, William MacGregor, Bromilow's party landed from the <i>Lord of the Isles</i> at Dobu Island in the D'Entrecasteaux group in eastern New Guinea. The six pioneer Australian and New Zealand missionaries, including Bromilow's wife and his daughter Ruve, were augmented by forty-one Fijian, Samoan, and Tongan teachers, wives, and children. The sanguinary reputation of Dobu was well known: Dobuans were said to roast their captives, whose blood they would drink from coconut shells. A fortified prefabricated mission house was aboard the <i>Lord of the Isles</i>, and some of the party were armed with revolvers and Winchester rifles. In the event there was no bloodshed.<br>
<br>As chairman of the Methodist New Guinea district, Bromilow took on a difficult task. At a theological level he was undogmatic; at a moral level he was rigid. While his outlook was softened by his university education as well as by his decade of Fijian experience, he had to deal with agents who did not share his intellectual range and who regarded many indigenous customs with disapproval. Bromilow thus veered one way and then another, not able for long to make up his mind about what he thought of Melanesian customs. He declared that he condemned all customs that were evil and encouraged all others, but he did not define which customs he thought were evil. His address at the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Melbourne in 1911 had a eulogistic quality. Land laws on Dobu, he declared, were &#145;perfect&#146;, property was inalienable, gardens scrupulously clean, dancing wonderfully elaborate, and hunting efficiently organized. Kiriwina chieftainship in the Trobriands, he said, &#145;always struck the visitor with wonder&#146;. Notwithstanding cannibalism and infant burial, Bromilow felt that a large part of Melanesian custom was &#145;much deserving of admiration and encouragement&#146;  (W. E. Bromilow, &#145;Dobuan (Papua) beliefs and folklore&#146;, <span class="italic">Report of the Thirteenth Meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science</span>, 1911, 413&#150;26). Nevertheless, away from the rostrum Bromilow was forced to admit that there was much to condemn, and he helped undermine traditional custom whenever it conflicted with his own moral standards. A visiting Anglican bishop of New Guinea, Montagu Stone-Wigg, observed that there was very persistent opposition by the Methodists under Bromilow to many native ways, but &#145;ill will against the mission for changing the Dobuans' habits was gradually dying down&#146;  (M. Stone-Wigg, diary, 13 Nov 1901, Anglican archives, University of Papua New Guinea).<br>
<br>The Edugaura language of Dobu was chosen by Bromilow as the lingua franca of the mission, and his interest in language and his skill as a translator brought him close to the Dobuan people and enabled him to communicate easily with them. His first Edugaura translation was finished seven years after his arrival. By 1908 he had published a <span class="roman">New Testament</span>. This was revised in 1925. In 1910, on MacGregor's recommendation, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of divinity by the University of Aberdeen. He published a translation of the whole <span class="roman">Bible</span> in 1927, an achievement described by the Australian lieutenant-governor J. H. P. Murray as &#145;colossal in scale&#146;  (Murray to A. H. Scrivin, Port Moresby, 4 June 1927, United Church archives, University of Papua New Guinea).<br>
<br>Bromilow's demeanour of benign paternalism towards Papuans was helped by the Dobuans' deference towards him: he seems to have been regarded as a clan elder or a father (<i>tamagwao</i>). In the Massim society of eastern New Guinea old men were credited with esoteric power, and it was believed that Bromilow's barometer caused, rather than forecast, rain. His occult reputation increased when the rumour circulated that he could take out his teeth, a feat which, demonstrated to gaping villagers, earned him the lifelong sobriquet of Saragigi (&#145;he who twists out his teeth&#146;).<br>
<br>In 1907, soon after Australia's formal assumption of sovereignty over British New Guinea, Bromilow joined other protestant mission leaders in signing a letter to the Australian press, protesting against the Australian government's proposed compulsory purchase of Papuan land for commercial development. However, he differed from some of his London Missionary Society neighbours in pursuing harmonious relations with government officials. He was more of a diplomat than a warrior.<br>
<br>Retiring from the mission for health reasons in 1908, Bromilow became minister of several suburban circuits in Sydney and was elected president of the Methodist conference of New South Wales in 1911. He also continued his interest in Papuan Methodist work by serving on the Australasian Methodist mission board as clerical treasurer between 1908 and 1920. Because of staff shortages in the post-war period he offered to rejoin the Papuan mission, arriving at the new headquarters on Ubuia Island in mid-1920 and becoming district chairman for two years. He finally retired in 1924.<br>
<br>Though accompanied by his superior George Brown at the inauguration of mission work in 1891, Bromilow was the true founder of the Methodist mission in British New Guinea. For this work he seems to have been particularly well chosen. Early in his chairmanship he and his wife adopted a Dobuan boy, Gideoni, as their own son, and the Bromilow family were accepted as members of a Dobuan clan, with their own land. He himself became a member of the kula ring. In his second term of office he withdrew from the kula ring on the grounds that it had deteriorated into little more than a trading concern. His autobiography was published under the title <span class="italic">Twenty Years among Primitive Papuans</span> shortly after his death in Sydney on 24 June 1929. He was buried at Gore Hill cemetery, Sydney. His description of Sir John Thurston, fourth governor of Fiji, as &#145;paternal but always discerning, benevolent but never weak&#146; applied equally to him.<br>
