<span class="headword">Plant,  (Samuel) Cornell</span>  (1866&#150;1921), <span class="occ">river pilot and cartographer</span>, was born at Framlingham, Suffolk, on 8 August 1866, the second son and third child (of four) of Samuel Plant (<i>b</i>. 1828/9), sometime master of the J. H. Allan Company's iron-hulled sailing cargo vessel <i>Reigate</i>, and his wife, Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bennett (<i>b</i>. 1835/6), of Batterdale, Suffolk. He used his maternal grandmother's maiden name Cornell as his own for all of his adult life.<br>
<br>At his parents' urging Plant joined the <i>Reigate</i> as a boy apprentice, a venture which certainly taught him the rudiments of seamanship, but also brought him, on his first outbound voyage, the tragic corollary of witnessing his father's death at the ship's wheel, in mid-Indian Ocean, and his subsequent burial at the seamen's mission in Madras. The young man then returned home to study navigation at the Trinity House School, Hull, and worked on a variety of ships on various long sea routes until 1886 when, having achieved his second mate's ticket as a precocious twenty-year-old, he promptly switched his professional enthusiasm in a fashion that would define the rest of his life: he decided to abandon the trials of the open sea in favour of what he considered the more challenging world of riverine navigation. He would learn the peculiar challenges of piloting large power vessels through the treacherous environments of shallows, rapids, and abrupt changes of direction that mark all too many of the world's great rivers.<br>
<br>Plant cut his teeth in Persia, on the Mesopotamian vessels of the Lynch brothers' Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. After working as deck officer on a number of company vessels and on a variety of local rivers, he was in 1891 promoted master of the steam-powered sternwheeler <i>Shushan</i>&#151;a ship built originally for the Nile, to take part in the relief of General Gordon at Khartoum. Using this exceptionally tough craft, and displaying a fearlessness in the face of the mighty river rapids he encountered, Captain Plant inaugurated as directed a regular passenger and cargo service on the highly dangerous Karun River between the towns of Ahvaz and Shustar. He became peculiarly adept at two crucial skills: finding the ideal passage through hitherto non-navigable upstream stretches of the river, and inventively repairing his ship on each of the frequent occasions when ill fortune or misjudgement dashed him onto the rocks. He also became an enthusiastic hunter&#151;shooting almost everything edible with a massive .577 Nitro express rifle&#151;and became fascinated by the warring rivalries of the Arab tribes in his territory, once watching the entire progress of a battle among 600 mounted cameleers from a hiding place on a hilltop.<br>
<br>In Persia Plant met and married, in 1894, Alice Sophia, then aged twenty-four, the daughter of Thomas Peters, a cobbler of Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire. Formerly a domestic servant in England, she was presumed to have travelled to the Middle East as a maid to an expatriate family. The marriage was performed by the acting British consul-general in Bandar Bushehr, and the couple remained inseparable for the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>In 1899, on leave in London recovering from a bout of malaria, Plant met the noted Sinologist and merchant Archibald Little, who over lunch at the Oriental Club explained his dream of running a regular commercial steamship service through the extremely hazardous waters of the upper Yangtze River. The project appealed to Plant, who by now felt he had met most of the riverine challenges posed by Persia. He welcomed the notion of voyaging to China and working on what most shipowners regarded as the most dangerous navigable river in the world.<br>
<br>Under treaties then current, foreign companies were permitted to trade in the lower and middle reaches of the 3500 mile long river: only at the beginning of the twentieth century was permission granted for vessels to work in the upper Yangtze above the ports of Ichang (Yichang) and Wuhan, along the spectacular 380 mile defile popularly known as the Three Gorges, and up to the central Szechwan (Sichuan) port of Chunking (Chongqing). Commerce was limited by the ferocity of the rapids: those junks that took essential cargoes upriver had to be warped over the rapids by teams&#151;sometimes numbering hundreds&#151;of so-called trackers, village coolies who were employed to pull, often for hours at a time, on bamboo hawsers attached to the vessels' flanks.<br>
<br>It was commonly believed by Chinese and foreigners alike that opening the Szechwan basin up to trade&#151;underpinned by powered shipping using the vast waterway of the Yangtze&#151;would have an immense economic effect on central China: there was consequently much interest in being the first to pioneer power navigation through the gorges. It fell to Cornell Plant, working for Archibald Little, eventually to conquer the considerable difficulties of this section of the river. He did so in a vessel named, appropriately, the <i>Pioneer</i>&#151;a Scottish-built side-wheeler, weighing 150 tons but drawing only 6 feet. Before leaving for China he travelled to Denny's shipyard in Dumbarton to oversee construction of the little vessel: it was then disassembled, taken in pieces to Shanghai, and put together again, whereupon the Plants travelled to China and the 34-year-old mariner began his assault on the Three Gorges.<br>
<br>It was a bravura performance. The vessel managed the entire journey to Chunking in seventy-three steaming hours&#151;though admittedly spread over seven days, with three days spent at the notorious Hsin Tan rapid, with the <i>Pioneer</i>'s crew hauling her, hand over hand, using a hawser made fast to a rock. By the time Plant arrived at the Chunking docks he was able to lay claim to his being the first vessel ever to make the upriver journey without the use of trackers. It changed the face of Yangtze commerce for all time: before long Plant himself, who lived with his wife on the river in a specially made three-decker houseboat, was running a regular fortnightly tourist service for the Szechuan Steam Navigation Company: and the city of Chunking began to expand enormously&#151;it was to become, briefly, China's capital during the 1940s, and would go on to become the most populous of all China's cities&#151;in no small part due to the opening up of the hitherto almost non-navigable river.<br>
<br>In 1910 Plant&#151;a short, slightly chubby pipe-smoker&#151;joined the Chinese maritime customs as senior river inspector, spending much of the next decade establishing a system of signalling for river traffic, and conducting detailed hydrographic surveys. During this period he published his <span class="italic">Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang&#150;Chunking Section of the Yangtze River</span> (1920), which remained for half a century a classic pilots' guide to the river's hydraulic caprices. The Chinese government awarded him the order of Chia Ho in gratitude for his services; and when he retired from the customs in 1919 he was given a cottage at the top of a cliff overlooking the infamous Hsin Tan rapid. It became the custom for an upstream shipmaster to sound his siren after successfully passing through the turbulence, whereupon Plant would wave a handkerchief from his terrace in acknowledgement.<br>
<br>Cornell Plant died suddenly aboard the Blue Funnel liner <i>Teiresias</i> on 26 February 1921, as he and his wife were sailing from Shanghai to Hong Kong <i>en route</i> to a brief holiday in England. Alice Plant died two days later, and the couple were buried beside one another in the cemetery at Happy Valley, Hong Kong. They never had children; but two adopted Chinese foundling girls who had been with them on the homebound ship were left in the care of the Church of Scotland ladies mission, and returned to school in Ichang, since when all trace of them has vanished.<br>
<br>As, for a while, did a 30 foot tall granite memorial to Plant, paid for by public subscription and unveiled with great ceremony in 1924. The obelisk, the only memorial to a non-Chinese on the banks of the Yangtze, stood near the Plants' house in Xintan. During the xenophobic excesses of the cultural revolution there were attempts to blow it up and deface it, but it proved too strongly built. In 2004, however, threatened with submersion by the rising waters upstream of the Three Gorges Dam, it was moved to a new site on a mountainside. All of the rapids which had made the gorges so justly famous, and which had been so assiduously charted by Cornell Plant, were, however, fully submerged, and have for ever been stilled.<br>
