<span class="headword">Bardolf,  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1206, <em>d.</em> 1275/6), <span class="occ">baron</span>, was the son and heir of Doun Bardolf of Shelford, Nottinghamshire, and Beatrice, daughter and heir of William de Warenne of Wormegay, Norfolk. He was a middle-ranking baron with a long career in royal service, who supported the baronial reformers in 1258, but took the side of the king when civil war broke out in 1264.<br>
<br>After the death of Doun in 1205, and of her second husband, Ralph (<i>c</i>.1210), Beatrice married Hubert de Burgh, earl of Kent, who became guardian of her son William Bardolf following her own death in 1214. Although Bardolf had livery of his inheritance in 1215, his stepfather contrived to keep control of the honour of Wormegay until his death in 1243. Bardolf was already married to Nichola, whose parentage is unknown, when he attended Henry III on his visit to France in 1230. He commanded the expedition which captured William de Marisco and other outlaws on Lundy island in 1242, served the king in Scotland and Wales in 1244, and accompanied Queen Eleanor to France in 1254. His rewards included grants of free warren, fairs and markets in his manors, and favourable terms for the payment of his debts to the king.<br>
<br>In the political crisis of 1258, however, Bardolf was one of the twelve chosen by the barons to reform the realm, and on 22 June he was appointed constable of Nottingham Castle under the terms of the provisions of Oxford. By March 1259 he had been elected to the parliamentary committee of twelve, and in 1261 he used his local influence to obstruct the work of the king's sheriff in Norfolk. He was one of the Montfortians who in December 1263 agreed to the arbitration of Louis IX on the quarrel with the king, but after the rebels were defeated at Northampton in April 1264 he joined the king and was captured at the battle of Lewes that May. He received only modest grants of the lands of rebels after the battle of Evesham in August 1265. When he died, shortly before 5 January 1276, he was succeeded by his son, also William Bardolf.<br>
