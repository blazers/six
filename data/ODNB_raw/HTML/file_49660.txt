<span class="headword">Gunn <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fubister]</span>,  Isabel</span> <span class="st"> [<em>alias </em>John Fubister]</span>  (1780&#150;1861), <span class="occ">sailor and cross-dresser</span>, was born in Orkney, on 1 August 1780, the daughter of John Fubister and Girzal Allan, and was baptized Isabel Fubister on 7 August in St Andrew's parish, Orkney. Few details are known about her life until she signed on with David Geddes, an agent for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) at Stromness in June 1806, disguised as John Fubister. The name was probably borrowed from her brother John, who was baptized on 20 March 1783. She set sail aboard the <i>Prince of Wales</i> on 29 June to begin the six-week journey of 3000 miles across the north Atlantic. The crew arrived at Fort Albany, on James Bay, after a five-day journey travelling south in a shallop (a three-masted boat with lug sails) from Moose Factory on 27 August 1806. Fubister undertook several journeys canoeing up river to deliver supplies to the company's fur trading outposts. On 22 June 1807 the new governor, James Hodgson, set off for Martin's Fall with a crew that included one Fubbister and another Orcadian, John Scarth (<i>b</i>. 1770), for a 1800-mile journey up river as part of a larger brigade destined for Pembina Post on the Red River.<br>
<br>Fubister was abruptly forced to give up &#145;his&#146; disguise when, during Christmas 1807, he was among a group of HBC men celebrating at the home of a Northwest Company officer, Alexander Henry. Fubister, feeling unwell, asked to lie down and Henry made the following entry in his journal of 29 December:<blockquote>I was surprised at the fellow's demand; however, I told him to sit down and warm himself. I returned to my own room, where I had not been long before he sent one of my people, requesting the favour of speaking with me. Accordingly, I stepped down to him and was much surprised to find him extended on the hearth, uttering dreadful lamentations; he stretched out his hands towards me, and in piteous tones begged me to be kind to a poor, helpless, abandoned wretch, who was not the sex I had supposed but an unfortunate Orkney girl, pregnant and actually in childbirth. &hellip; In about an hour she was safely delivered of a fine boy. (<span class="italic">New Light</span>)</blockquote>After this spectacular disclosure Fubister returned to her former identity (although she inexplicably took the surname Gunn) and returned to Fort Albany in May 1808, travelling with Hugh Heney's party. Since she was the first European woman ever to travel this far west (the HBC refused to allow their employees to bring their wives or families) news about her extraordinary journey travelled quickly. On 24 May fur trapper Peter Fidler noted in his &#145;Journal of a journey from Swan to the Red River&#146; that<blockquote>the woman Mary Fubbester [<i>sic</i>] who was delivered of a Boy 5th Jany last is also gone out&#151;she hired with Mr. Geddes in Stromness as a man, in men's clothing 1806&#151;remained at Albany one winter and her sex was not known till delivery except to one John Scart [<i>sic</i>] her parmour on whose account she came out&#151;she worked at anything and well like the rest of the men.</blockquote>Back at Albany Fort, Isabel was put to work washing for her former colleagues and minding the eleven children of the HBC's officers. A letter sent home to Orkney by schoolteacher William Harper suggests that she resented this new form of employment. He wrote that his compatriot was living &#145;with her child and her chief employment is washing for all hands which indeed she is no witch at as far as I think she has been washing for me &hellip; she seems not inclined to go home&#146;  (Harper to W. Watt, 5 Sept 1808, Ernest Marwich MSS). But she managed to stay an additional year and sailed home with her son, James Scarth, on 20 September 1809.<br>
<br>Isabel Gunn never married but retired to Stromness with her son, where she became known as a local witch who sold love potions and charms to the young. Despite her extraordinary adventure she died a pauper, alone, at South End, Main Street, Stromness, Orkney, on 7 November 1861.<br>
