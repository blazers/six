<span class="headword">Plaschkes,  Otto</span>  (1929&#150;2005), <span class="occ">film producer</span>, was born on 13 September 1929 in Grinzing, a suburb of Vienna, the second child and elder son of Jewish parents, Heinrich Plaschkes (1899&#150;1970), butcher, and his wife, Gertrude, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Grosz (1901&#150;1964). His father was born in Bratislava and his mother in Budapest. Plaschkes always suspected that his mother may have added a year to his age to facilitate his escape to Britain from the invading Nazis by the <i>Kindertransport</i>. His parents also managed to escape, and they were reunited in Salisbury, where his father established a sausage-casing business. At Bishop Wordsworth's School the English master, William Golding, allegedly based the character of Piggy in <span class="italic">Lord of the Flies</span> upon the young Plaschkes. After reading history at Peterhouse, Cambridge, he did his national service with the Royal Army Service Corps, before taking a diploma in education at Wadham College, Oxford.<br>
<br>Plaschkes discovered cinema through the Cambridge Film Society, and in 1955 Sir Michael Balcon agreed to employ him as a runner at Ealing Studios, where he embraced his employer's vision of an indigenous British cinema. When Ealing closed, Plaschkes worked his way up the production ladder at other studios, through a series of uncredited jobs as assistant director. In 1961, with an Australian, Jim Jeffreys, he set up Jimar Pictures (Pty) Ltd to produce television commercials. Plaschkes persuaded the Children's Film Foundation to allow him to produce a one-hour film in Australia, <span class="italic">Bungala Boys</span> (1961), and in order to secure a passage there Jeffreys persuaded P&amp;O Lines to commission them to make a documentary about life on its England&#150;Australia liner. <span class="italic">Bungala Boys</span> was a baptism of fire, for the production ran out of money, and Plaschkes had to work for his ticket home. Nevertheless, the film won a special award at the Venice film festival.<br>
<br>After working as production assistant on David Lean's acclaimed <span class="italic">Lawrence of Arabia</span> (1962) and as production manager for <span class="italic">Tarzan's Three Challenges</span> (1963) Plaschkes was engaged to advise Robert Goldston, the American co-producer of <span class="italic">The Uncle</span> (1964). They co-produced three feature films together: <span class="italic">Georgy Girl</span> (1966), <span class="italic">The Bofors Gun</span> (1968), and <span class="italic">A Separate Peace</span> (1972). <span class="italic">Georgy Girl</span>, which starred James Mason and Alan Bates, with Lynn Redgrave as the eponymous Georgy, was a &#145;swinging London&#146; fairy tale, intermittently accompanied by a popular, relentlessly up-tempo title song, sung by the Australian pop group the Seekers. The film grossed over &pound;13 million worldwide, and garnered four Academy award (or Oscar) nominations. <span class="italic">The Bofors Gun</span> was a commercial failure, although Ian Holm won a BAFTA award as best supporting actor. The Paramount-backed <span class="italic">A Separate Peace</span>, filmed in America, also failed to match the success of <span class="italic">Georgy Girl</span>. Ely Landau then engaged Plaschkes as the executive producer for four of his American Film Theatre productions, which were designed to introduce London and New York stage plays to a wider American audience: <span class="italic">The Homecoming</span> (directed by Peter Hall), <span class="italic">Butley</span> (directed by Harold Pinter), <span class="italic">Galileo</span> (directed by Joseph Losey), and <span class="italic">In Celebration</span> (directed by Lindsay Anderson). On 9 May 1975 Plaschkes married Louise Stein, a 36-year-old art gallery assistant, and daughter of Barnet Glickler, architect. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>As cinema audiences declined, Plaschkes sought, along with other members of the Association of Independent Producers, to persuade the government to assign all the revenues from the British Film Fund to the National Film Finance Corporation, but to no avail. However, in 1976 he was appointed to the National Film Development Fund to advise the National Film Finance Corporation on which scripts appeared to be the best projects in which to invest development money. He returned to Vienna to work as line producer on Elliott Kastner's <span class="italic">A Little Night Music</span> (1977) and then, back in England, persuaded the Thames Television subsidiary Euston Films and the National Film Finance Corporation to back <span class="italic">The Sailor's Return</span> (1978) which, in his view, &#145;celebrated the English character in its best and worst form&#146;  (Downs, 17). In 1980 he worked again for Ely Landau and his second wife, Edie, to produce <span class="italic">Hopscotch</span>, a cloak-and-dagger comedy starring Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson.<br>
<br>Plaschkes and the American producer Sy Weintraub planned to produce six Sherlock Holmes films, starring Ian Richardson as Holmes. But Weintraub reduced this to two&#151;<span class="italic">The Hound of the Baskervilles</span> and <span class="italic">Sign of Four</span> (both 1983)&#151;when he discovered that the British rights to the Conan Doyle stories were already in the public domain, thus allowing Granada Television to produce its own rival series. Plaschkes next began to produce the offbeat <span class="italic">Shadey</span>, backed by Channel 4's Film Four International, in which Anthony Sher played a transsexual car repairer able to transmit telepathic images. But the production had to be postponed when Ely Landau, who had had a stroke, suddenly asked Plaschkes to take over the production of <span class="italic">The Holcroft Covenant</span> (1985), directed by John Frankenheimer and starring Michael Caine. Plaschkes finally completed <span class="italic">Shadey</span> in 1985.<br>
<br>Menachem Golan and Yoram Globus appointed Plaschkes as head of creative affairs when their Cannon Film Company took over EMI. &#145;The way to make a project happen&#146;, asserted Golan, &#145;is to excite the lovely Mr. Otto Plaschkes, who will excite me&#146;  (Walker, <span class="italic">Icons in the Fire</span>, 47). But Plaschkes only managed to authorize two co-productions with Channel 4 Television, <span class="italic">Business as Usual</span> and <span class="italic">The Kitchen Toto</span>, and to produce <span class="italic">In Search of Hanna</span>, a documentary in which he interviewed Golan about the making of <span class="italic">Hanna's War</span>. Between 1986 and 1988 Plaschkes acted as chief executive of the British Film and Television Producers' Association, after which he produced <span class="italic">Doggin' Around</span> (1994), directed by Desmond Davis, for the BBC's <span class="italic">Screen One</span> series.<br>
<br>Intellectually a pessimist, but temperamentally an optimist, Plaschkes was highly regarded by his creative colleagues and fellow producers. An Austrian by birth, he always struggled to make authentically British films, although he often had to rely on American money to keep his career afloat. He died from a heart attack on 14 February 2005 at University College Hospital, Camden, London, after attending a screening of <span class="italic">As It Is in Heaven</span>, a Swedish film which had been nominated for an Academy award as the best foreign-language film. He was survived by his wife, Louise, and their daughter.<br>
