<span class="headword">Aylesbury,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1612, <em>d.</em> 1656), <span class="occ">translator and government official</span>, was baptized at St Margaret, Lothbury, London, on 13 July 1612, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/929/', "Sir Thomas Aylesbury, baronet (1579/80&#150;1658)")</script>, and his wife, Anne Darell, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Denman (1589&#150;1661). On 18 July 1628 he matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford; he graduated BA on 27 April 1631. That year he was admitted to Lincoln's Inn; there is no record of his being called to the bar.<br>
<br>Although possessing a large fortune, Aylesbury soon afterwards became, at the invitation of Charles I, governor to the young duke of Buckingham and his brother, Lord Francis Villiers, and travelled with them through France and Italy. In 1640 Aylesbury was residing at Paris, and in his correspondence with his brother-in-law Sir Edward Hyde (Bodl. Oxf., Clarendon papers) bitterly lamented the course of English politics under the Long Parliament. In the middle of May 1641 he returned from Paris to London with the earl of Leicester, the English ambassador at the French court, with whom he had been apparently living in an official capacity for some months. Shortly afterwards he presented his former pupils to the king at Oxford, who promised him the next vacancy among the grooms of the chambers, but the promise was never fulfilled, and Aylesbury continued in the service of the duke of Buckingham, as his agent, until the final defeat of the royalists.<br>
<br>During his interview with Charles I, Aylesbury, who was well acquainted with Italian, was urged by the king to continue a translation into English of H. C. Davila's history of the French civil wars, which he had just begun, and during the following years he was mainly engaged in the work; but he was only in England at intervals, and witnessed his royal patron's disasters from the safe distance of Paris or Rome. He and his friend Sir Charles Cotterel, who provided substantial assistance, received, however, frequent encouragement from the king. In spite of his political troubles, Charles read through the whole of the manuscript before the book was printed. The translation was published with a dedication to the king in 1647.<br>
<br>On the fall of Charles I, Aylesbury sought refuge with his father, first at Amsterdam, and afterwards at Antwerp; and he took under his protection his sister, Lady Hyde. But his poverty, caused by the confiscation of the property of his family, forced him in 1650 to return to England; he retired to the neighbourhood of Oxford, where he lived on the charity of his more fortunate friends. Early in 1656, however, he obtained the office of secretary to Major-General Robert Sedgwick, who had just been appointed governor of Jamaica, and finally left England. Following Sedgwick's death on 24 May for three months he took an especially active part in the government of the island, but he too died on 24 August, in Jamaica, and was probably buried there. A letter reporting the news to John Thurloe, the secretary of state, describes him as &#145;a man well versed in the weighty affairs of state, who in his counsels and advice, both to army and fleet, was very useful, for the want of which we shall have more and more to grieve&#146;  (Thurloe, 5.374).<br>
