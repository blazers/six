<span class="headword">Mather,  Samuel</span>  (1626&#150;1671), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18324/', "Richard Mather (1596&#150;1669)")</script> and his wife, Katherine Holt (<i>d</i>. 1655). He was born at Much Woolton, Lancashire, on 13 May 1626, and emigrated with his parents and three brothers to New England in 1635. He was educated at Harvard College, graduating MA in 1643. He was the first graduate named a fellow. Mather preached to what became the Second Church of Boston (North Church), but refused an offer to become that congregation's pastor, choosing to return to England instead. His New England connections with leading English Independents secured for him a position as chaplain to Thomas Andrewes, the lord mayor of London, who had earlier been a member of Thomas Goodwin's Arnhem congregation. Mather preached at Gravesend and Exeter and in 1650 became a chaplain at Magdalen College, Oxford, where Thomas Goodwin was president. He became a close friend of Sidrach Simpson and accompanied Simpson to Scotland with the English commissioners. During the next two years he preached occasionally at Leith. <br>
<br>In 1654 Philip Nye recommended Mather as a preacher to the council of state in Ireland. Two years later he was called to the ministry of the church of St Nicholas in Dublin, where most Dublin aldermen worshipped; he was ordained in a congregationalist ceremony. His colleague at St Nicholas was Samuel Winter. Mather was also a lecturer at Christ Church, a fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, and one of the leading puritan clergy in the country, with a close relationship to Henry Cromwell during the latter's administration of Irish affairs. He served as a commissioner for approbation of ministers in co. Cork. For part of this time he had the companionship of his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18322/', "Increase Mather")</script>, who received an MA from Trinity in 1658. In that same year Samuel married a sister of Sir John Stevens. They had four or five children but only one, named Catherine, lived to maturity. <br>
<br>Mather accepted the accession of Charles II but preached a sequence of two controversial sermons in September 1660, urging Charles to assume the role of a reforming Hezekiah and identifying as needing reform the use of the clerical surplice, signing with the cross in baptism, kneeling at communion, bowing to the altar, use of cathedral music, and other targets common to the puritan agenda. He warned that if such reforms were not initiated and, worse, &#145;If you super-adde the sin of Persecution to the sin of Superstition, you will be quickly ripe for final Ruine&#146;, as &#145;the Lord himself will fight against you&#146;  (Greaves, 56). He was prohibited from further preaching and ordered to deliver his sermon notes, but instead sent them to New England where they were published in 1670 through the efforts of his brother Increase. <br>
<br>Deprived of his living, Mather returned to his Lancashire homeland and ministered at Burtonwood until ejected in 1662. He was advised that the repression of dissent was less thorough in Ireland and returned to Dublin, where he preached regularly to a congregation on New Row. Though briefly incarcerated in 1664 for holding a conventicle, he was able to continue his ministry. In 1666 or the following year Mather preached a sermon justifying withdrawal from the Church of Ireland, &#145;the wicked party&#146;. He urged co-operation between congregationalist, Baptist, and presbyterian dissenters, particularly in <span class="italic">Irenicum, or, An Essay for Union</span>, which was published posthumously in 1680. In that work he pointed with approval to the fact that the dissenters attended each others' services in Dublin. But Mather's eirenic interests were limited to orthodox Calvinists. He was critical of the Fifth Monarchist Jeremiah Marsden and preached <span class="italic">A Defence of the Protestant Christian Religion Against Popery</span> (1672). Another of his interests was typology, and his sermons on <span class="italic">The Figures or Types of the Old Testament</span> were published by his brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18323/', "Nathaniel Mather")</script> in 1683. <br>
<br>Mather's first wife died in 1668 and by the time he wrote his will on 18 August 1671 he was married to Hannah, whom he named one of his executors. They seem to have had no children and Mather's daughter, Catherine, was his heir. He died on 29 October 1671 and his widow proved his will on 7 March 1672. He was soon succeeded by his brother Nathaniel as pastor of the New Row congregation.<br>
