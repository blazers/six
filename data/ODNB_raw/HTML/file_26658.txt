<span class="headword">Streatfeild,  Thomas</span>  (1777&#150;1848), <span class="occ">topographer and antiquary</span>, was born on 5 January 1777. He was the eldest son of Sandeforth Streatfeild (<i>bap</i>. 1750, <i>d</i>. 1809) of Long Ditton, Surrey (descended from the Streatfeilds of Chiddingstone, Kent), who was a partner, first in the house of Brandram &amp; Co., and then in that of Sir Samuel Fludyer &amp; Co. His mother was Frances, daughter of Thomas Hussey, of Ashford, Kent. He matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 19 May 1795 and graduated BA in 1799.<br>
<br>Christmases at Long Ditton at that time were enlivened by some two-act comedies of manners which Streatfeild wrote and which were performed by friends and relatives in the laundry, temporarily converted to use as a theatre. At least two survive from those days, <span class="italic">Ton and Antiquity</span> (1798) and <span class="italic">The Road to Ridicule</span> (1799), as well as a slim volume of <span class="italic">Prologues and Epilogues</span> (1799).<br>
<br>In early life Streatfeild was curate at Long Ditton to the Revd William Pennicott (<i>d</i>. 1811), and his talents received early encouragement from his father, whose funeral sermon he preached and later had published. He was at that time also chaplain to the duke of Kent, and became subsequently curate of Tatsfield, in Surrey, retaining the post until, in 1842, ill health compelled him to retire. On 8 October 1800 Streatfeild married Harriet, daughter and coheir of Alexander Champion, of Wandsworth, who brought with her a considerable fortune. They had five sons and three daughters, before she died on 10 November 1814. In 1822 he established his family on an estate of 40 acres at Chart's Edge, Westerham, where he had a house built to his own design, and on 30 September 1823 he married again. His second wife was Clare, widow of Henry Woodgate, of Spring Grove, and daughter of the Revd Thomas Harvey, rector of Cowden; they had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Streatfeild was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 4 June 1812, and was for many years employed in forming collections, chiefly genealogical and biographical, in illustration of the history of Kent. A number of drawings (many by himself) and engravings for this projected work were also made, but Streatfeild was able to publish no more of it than <span class="italic">Excerpta Cantiana</span> (1836), a 23-page prospectus for the work, which it was proposed to bring out in ten parts. Streatfeild appears to have taken a strenuous part in the general election of 1837, and shortly afterwards to have suffered a stroke. After his death his fifty-two volumes of notes and manuscript materials for the proposed history were left to his collaborator, the Revd Lambert Blackwell Larking, in the hope that the latter would be able to bring the project to fruition. In the event only one instalment of the work was to be published, in 1886, under the editorship of H. H. Drake, with the title <span class="italic">Hasted's History of Kent: Corrected, Enlarged, and Continued to the Present Time, from the Manuscripts of the Late Rev T. Streatfeild, and the Late Rev L. B. Larking, Part 1: The Hundred of Blackheath</span>. The Streatfeild manuscript collections are now in the British Library.<br>
<br>Otherwise Streatfeild published little. Of several verse tragedies which he wrote later in life only <span class="italic">The Bridal of Armagnac</span> (1823) was published. <span class="italic">Lympsfield and its Environs</span>, a short series of drawings made in the vicinity of this Surrey village, was given in manuscript to a bazaar, and subsequently published by a local printer in 1838. Streatfeild died at Chart's Edge on 17 May 1848, and was buried at Chiddingstone.<br>
