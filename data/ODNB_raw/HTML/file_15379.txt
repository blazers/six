<span class="headword">Kennedy,  John</span>, sixth earl of Cassillis  (1601<span class="mult">x</span>7&#150;1668), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the son of Hew Kennedy (<i>d</i>. 1607), younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15369/', "Gilbert Kennedy, fourth earl of Cassillis")</script>, and his wife, Katherine, daughter of Uchtred Macdowall of Garthland. He succeeded his uncle <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15377/', "John Kennedy, fifth earl of Cassillis (1574/5&#150;1615)")</script>, in October 1615. On 24 January 1619 he received a royal licence to travel in France, Germany, and the Low Countries &#145;for his instruction in languages and doing his other lawful affairs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Historical Account</span>, 45). He was served as heir to his uncle on 13 December 1621. He was still under age when he was contracted on 21 December 1621 (at Edinburgh) and on 7 January 1622 (at Whitehall) to marry Lady Jean Hamilton (1607&#150;1642), third daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12126/', "Thomas Hamilton, first earl of Haddington (1563&#150;1637)")</script>, and his second wife, Margaret Foulis. They had a son, James, who predeceased his father, dying in 1663. The countess has been identified as the heroine of <span class="italic">The Gypsy Laddie</span>, but she was dead before some of the events depicted in the song.<br>
<br>Cassillis was known as &#145;the grave and solemn earl&#146;  (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>) as befitted, perhaps, a zealous presbyterianism. Indeed, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/4061/', "Gilbert Burnet")</script>, whose first wife was one of Cassillis's daughters, talked of his father-in-law's &#145;obstinate stiffness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.96). He opposed the religious policies of Charles I in Scotland, but he maintained that this was out of zeal rather than a challenge to royal authority. This was the theme of the instrument of protest unveiled by Cassillis and Archibald Johnston of Wariston at the market cross in Edinburgh on 22 February 1638. However, there is some evidence that even at this early date he was in contact with others of a similar outlook in England with the aim of bringing both kingdoms under one reformed religion.<br>
<br>Although a committed signatory of the national covenant Cassillis had to be convinced by Robert Baillie of the necessity of forcible resistance to the king. Characteristically, once convinced he entered wholeheartedly in covenanting resistance and he was present in the covenanters' camp upon Duns Law in 1639. He was named to the committee of estates appointed on 8 June 1640 to sit in the interval before parliament was due to reconvene in November 1640. When parliament eventually sat Cassillis was named to several important committees and on 17 September 1641 he was nominated by the king to the new privy council of Scotland. Following the end of the parliamentary session he was named to the most important financial interval committees, and also those concerned from January 1642 in supplying troops for the Irish campaign which were to be paid by the English parliament. When the convention of estates met from June to August 1643 Cassillis served on four of its most important committees. He duly signed the solemn league and covenant on 2 November 1643, the first occasion that a privy councillor could do so.<br>
<br>Early in January 1644 the Scottish army crossed into England, where, on 20 February 1644 at &#145;the Scots league at Heighton&#146;, Cassillis, whose first wife had died about 15 December 1642, signed a contract to marry Lady Margaret Hay (<i>d</i>. 1695), daughter of William Hay, earl of Erroll, and the widow of Henry Ker, Lord Ker (<i>d</i>. 1643), eldest son of Robert Ker, first earl of Roxburghe. They had one son and four daughters. Meanwhile Cassillis was very active in the committees of the convention of estates in the first part of 1644 and on the committees of the parliament which met under the terms of the <span class="roman">Triennial Act</span> in June 1644. In July 1644 he was named to the army section of the committee of estates, but still attended nearly half of the meetings of the Edinburgh section and most of the privy council meetings.<br>
<br>Cassillis continued to be active in both parliament and the various committees set up in the intervals between sessions. When the president of the parliament, the earl of Crawford-Lindsay, was absent Cassillis was chosen vice-president of the parliament on 26 December 1645. In January 1646 he supported the <span class="roman">Act of Classes</span> which set out the punishments for malignants and delinquents. With Crawford-Lindsay again absent Cassillis was elected president of the parliament on 6 February 1647. He was an active attender of the committee of estates between March 1647 and February 1648, although the balance of power had swung towards the duke of Hamilton and the engagement. He was not elected president of the first session of the second triennial parliament in March 1648, but attended and sometimes spoke in support of the marquess of Argyll and Johnston of Wariston. Like Argyll, Cassillis did not vote for the legislation of 11 April which paved the way for the invasion of England. With the changed circumstances following the defeat of the engagers at Preston in August 1648 Cassillis was one of the leaders of the whiggamore raid to Edinburgh which secured control of the committee of estates. Cassillis was a leading figure on the revamped committee which met on 14 September 1648. When parliament reassembled in February 1649 Cassillis supported the renewal of the solemn league and covenant and the <span class="roman">Act of Classes</span> debarring the engagers from parliament.<br>
<br>Following parliament's proclamation of Charles II in February 1649 Cassillis set sail on 17 March as the only peer among the seven commissioners sent to Charles at The Hague. He reported back to parliament on 11 June on the unsuccessful negotiations with the king. On 29 June 1649 he was admitted lord justice-general and on 3 July 1649 an extraordinary lord of session. Although Cassillis opposed the appointment of commissioners to treat with Charles at Breda in February 1650 he was duly nominated a commissioner, and in fact was elected president of the commission which met Charles II in March. On 29 April 1650 Cassillis signed the invitation to Charles to come to Scotland, but he urged the kirk to prevent the ratification of any agreement with the king because he had not taken the covenants. According to John Lamont, Cassillis attended the coronation of Charles II at Scone on 1 January 1651, but not in his robes. He attended all the meetings of the committee of estates between the coronation and the meeting of parliament in March 1651. The defeat of the Scottish army at Worcester on 3 September 1651 and the incorporation of Scotland into the English Commonwealth in October saw his retirement from political affairs. Oliver Cromwell nominated Cassillis to his other house in 1656&#150;8, but he never took his seat. However, he was placed second behind General George Monck in the commission of assessment for Ayrshire in June 1657, and again in January 1660.<br>
<br>At the Restoration Charles II restored Cassillis to his places as justice-general in August 1660 and as a lord of session. However, when parliament assembled on 1 January 1661 Cassillis declined to take the oath of allegiance unless he could add his own interpretation to it, and particularly objected to the crown's supremacy in ecclesiastical issues. He left the parliament saying &#145;I resolve to leave his counsels and dominions which is as ill as anything Oliver ever threatened me with&#146;  (Young, 321). By an act of 10 April 1661 he was deprived of his office as an extraordinary lord of session and barred from holding any public office. A subsequent trip to London in spring 1661 failed to retrieve his political position, or to prevent the imposition of episcopacy in Scotland, although in August he argued against the establishment of bishops. He returned to Scotland about November 1661, possibly with a royal promise that he and his family would remain unmolested by the government. Certainly in January 1664 the Scottish authorities received orders that Cassillis and his family should not be harassed for a refusal to comply with the law in ecclesiastical matters. Cassillis reciprocated this gesture in 1665 by spurning Dutch approaches to support a rebellion. Cassillis died &#145;at his own house in the west country&#146;, presumably Maybole in Ayrshire, in April 1668, and was succeeded as seventh earl by <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15380/', "John Kennedy (c.1646&#150;1701)")</script>, his son from his second marriage. His wife died in London and was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields on 22 April 1695.<br>
