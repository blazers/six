<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Acton,  John  Adams-</span>  (1830&#150;1910), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 11 December 1830 at Acton Hill, Middlesex, one of the two surviving sons and three daughters of William Adams, an artist, and his wife, Helen Elizabeth Humphreys. His sister Clarissa was also an artist, and exhibited at the Royal Academy. He added Acton to his surname in 1869 to avoid confusion with other artists called John Adams.<br>
<br>Adams was educated at Ealing Grove School (founded by Lady Byron, wife of the poet Lord Byron), and then trained with the sculptors Timothy Butler and Matthew Noble before attending the Royal Academy Schools from 1853 to 1858. After winning early medals in the antique and life classes, he went on to win a gold medal for an allegorical sculpture group, <span class="italic">Eve Supplicating Forgiveness at the Feet of Adam</span> (1855). In 1858 he won the Royal Academy's travelling studentship and went to Rome, where he stayed until 1865. While there he became known to John Gibson, the most significant British sculptor in Rome. Gibson acknowledged Adams's talent for portraiture, and subsequently sent many distinguished visitors to his studio, including Gladstone, who became his patron and close friend. Throughout his stay in Rome, Adams executed numerous significant portrait commissions as a result of Gibson's recommendations. Many of these patrons affirmed his talent as a portrait sculptor when they returned to London, thereby ensuring his reputation and future commissions. Adams-Acton married on 15 April 1875, at St Mark's Church, Hamilton Terrace, London, Marion (1846&#150;1928) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58948/', "Acton, Marion Jean Catherine Adams-")</script>], adopted daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13077/', "George Edwards Hering")</script>, artist, born Marion Hamilton of the Isle of Arran, a novelist writing under the name of Jeanie Hering. They had three daughters and four sons, two of whom later became sculptors.<br>
<br>After an eight-month sojourn in India, where Adams-Acton endeavoured to secure further important contacts and commissions, they returned to settle in London. From 1880 they lived at 103 Marylebone Road, his studio being located in Salisbury Mews, until he could find a freehold with sufficient land to build a large studio adjacent to his house. This he found at 8 Langford Place where he lived and worked from 1882 to 1906; he then moved to 17 Abbey Road for the last years of his working life. These residences were all in St John's Wood, a district favoured by many artists in the nineteenth century. Each summer the Adams-Acton family stayed in Mrs Adams-Acton's house at Brodick on the Isle of Arran.<br>
<br>Adams-Acton was popular as a portrait sculptor mainly working in marble. His ability to produce a natural likeness was in great demand. He was also sought after to undertake allegorical, classical, and heroic work. Important commissions included the monument to Bishop Waldegrave (1869; Carlisle Cathedral), the Cruikshank memorial (<i>c</i>.1871; St Paul's Cathedral, London), the Wesley memorial (<i>c</i>.1875; Westminster Abbey), and the memorial to Cardinal Manning (1908; Westminster Cathedral). He also executed a colossal statue of Titus Salt for Bradford (1874); statues of Queen Victoria for Kingston, Jamaica, and the Bahamas; and <span class="italic">W. E. Gladstone</span> for Liverpool and Blackburn. Edward VII, as prince of Wales, sat to him on many occasions.<br>
<br>A number of Adams-Acton's portrait busts are in the National Portrait Gallery, London. He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy until 1892, sending statues or busts of Gladstone, Lord Brougham, John Bright, Charles Dickens, Charles Spurgeon, Earl Russell, Archbishop Manning, Disraeli, and Pope Leo XIII. Notable sitters included Lord Shaftesbury, Lord Roberts, and Sir Edwin Landseer. Considered the best of his ideal works were <span class="italic">The First Sacrifice</span>, <span class="italic">The Lady of the Lake</span>, <span class="italic">Pharaoh's Daughter</span>, <span class="italic">Zenobia</span>, and <span class="italic">The Millennium</span>. Adams-Acton's last, unfinished work was a small figure of <span class="italic">The Angel of Peace</span>. He died at his wife's home on the Isle of Arran on 28 October 1910.<br>
