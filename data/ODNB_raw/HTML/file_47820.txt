<span class="headword">Stenhouse,  Alexander Rennie</span>  (1876&#150;1952), <span class="occ">insurance broker</span>, was born on 6 March 1876 at Lenzie, Dunbartonshire, one of the three children of John Stenhouse, builder, and Sarah Janet Goodwin. Stenhouse was brought up at Stepps, near Glasgow. After the early death of his father, Stenhouse left the village school in Milleston at the age of twelve to work as an errand-boy for a Glasgow newsagents. He moved on to employment with an insurance firm in Glasgow, and then, aged twenty-one, went to America, where he became a manager for the Hartford Insurance Company of Connecticut.<br>
<br>In 1903 Stenhouse returned to Glasgow and joined the National of Great Britain, an early specialist company, insuring risks protected by automatic fire sprinklers. However, in 1904 he started his own insurance broking firm from a small office at 154 St Vincent Street. In the following decade, Stenhouse's business grew rapidly. He had an eye for the market opportunities created by offering large discounts on hazardous commercial properties protected by the new technology of water sprinklers, experience of which he had gained in his previous posts. His business acumen was reinforced by his personal charm and sociable nature, and by his great facility for remembering names and faces. Clients visiting his office always found his door open, and &#145;A. R.&#146; keen to engage them in conversation. Stenhouse became one of the first members of the Association of Insurance Brokers and Agents (established 1906), and from 1911 he chaired a separate committee for Scotland.<br>
<br>In 1911 the business acquired two partners, but Stenhouse retained a controlling interest in A. R. Stenhouse &amp; Partners. Before and after the war, offices were opened in Edinburgh, Dundee, Perth, and Newcastle. A London office was opened in 1929, and expansion in the south continued up to and beyond the Second World War. The firm also diversified into loss of profits, liability, accident, and motor insurance. Fire underwriting, however, especially of industrial risks such as jute and paper mills, remained the staple through which the company's reputation as the leading insurance brokerage in Scotland was made.<br>
<br>By the early 1920s Stenhouse was said to have become a millionaire, not least through his expanding investment activities. In 1922 he founded Scottish Western Trust to manage his family interests, and became associated with a number of investment trusts in which insurance equities played a prominent part: Glasgow Financial Trust (1924), Great Northern (1924), Home and Foreign (1926), Midland&#150;Caledonian (1928), Clyde and Mersey (1929). Following the crash of 1929, Stenhouse's domestic staff were cut from sixteen to two, and his family temporarily moved into a factor's house on his estate. Then further calamity struck. Stenhouse became implicated in the alleged fraudulent flotation of Scottish Amalgamated Silks by Glasgow Financial Trust. In February 1931 he was arrested, together with twelve others, and detained for three weeks before bail was granted. The charges related to obtaining money&#151;allegedly &pound;438,000&#151;from the public by misrepresenting Scottish Amalgamated as a healthy company when it was insolvent. One year after his arrest, and only two days before the trial was due to commence, charges were dropped. The case caused some shock in Glasgow business circles, but Stenhouse's reputation stood the test and recovery was rapid. It is said that within three years his personal fortune had reached &pound;2 million.<br>
<br>In Glasgow Stenhouse was a member of the incorporations of Bonnetmakers and Dyers, of Hammermen, and of Wrights, and of the Society of Deacons. He enjoyed walking in the countryside around the house he had built in 1937 at Garnkirk; he loved the poetry of Burns and could recite long passages from memory. On 31 March 1908 he married Hughina, daughter of John Cowan, a wine merchant. They had four sons (three of whom entered the family company), and two daughters. His third son, Hugh Cowan Stenhouse, became chairman of the main company after his father's death, bought out the original partners, and consolidated family control. Stenhouse died of heart disease on 3 November 1952 at his home, Garnkirk House, Chryston, Lanarkshire. He left &pound;170,346 gross, but his estate was larger, much of it having been distributed to his family before his death. He was survived by his wife.<br>
