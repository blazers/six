<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Damm,  Sheila  Van</span>  (1922&#150;1987), <span class="occ">rally driver and theatre director</span>, was born on 17 January 1922 in Gloucester Terrace, Paddington, London, the youngest of three daughters (there were no sons) of Vivian Van Damm (<i>d</i>. 1960) and his wife, Natalie Lyons. Although her father had sponsored motorcycle speedway events in the 1920s, before inheriting the Windmill Theatre in London and initiating its format of non-stop revues, Sheila's upbringing in an all-girl Jewish family generated no interest in motoring beyond her training as a Women's Auxiliary Air Force driver. She subsequently trained privately as a pilot and joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve after the Second World War.<br>
<br>As a promotional stunt for the Windmill Theatre, Sheila Van Damm was persuaded in November 1950 to enter her first motor sporting event, the MCC&#150;<span class="italic">Daily Express</span> car rally, driving a factory-prepared Sunbeam Talbot, which her father had persuaded the Rootes Group to enter carrying the words &#145;Windmill Girl&#146; on the side of the car. Navigated by her sister Nona, she claimed third place in the ladies' section&#151;a performance which so impressed the Rootes team manager Norman Garrard that he invited her to join Nancy Mitchell and Bill Wisdom to form an all-women crew of a Hillman Minx in the 1951 Monte Carlo rally. She claimed further success in the 1951 RAC rally, when she won the ladies' prize for closed cars under 1500 cc at the wheel of her own Hillman Minx. This was the only occasion on which she competed as a private entrant. Subsequently, she would drive factory cars entered by the Rootes Group.<br>
<br>Her first major success was in the 1952 Motor Cycling Club rally, when she won the ladies' prize in a Sunbeam Talbot. Despite disappointment in the 1953 Monte Carlo rally, when a series of punctures forced her out of contention, she soon afterwards entered the record books, outpacing her more illustrious team-mate Stirling Moss to set a class record for 2&#150;3-litre cars, driving the prototype Sunbeam Alpine sports car at an average of 120.135 m.p.h. at Jabbeke in Belgium.<br>
<br>Described in a contemporary report as &#145;a fresh faced woman, possessed of an infectious sense of fun&#146;, Sheila Van Damm had an ebullient and outgoing personality which masked a fearsomely competitive and determined approach to her sport. The 1953 alpine rally, one of Europe's toughest events, saw her, co-driven by Anne Hall, win not only the coupe des dames, but also one of the coveted coupes des Alpes, for finishing the event without gaining penalty marks for lateness.<br>
<br>Van Damm competed in the Great American Mountain rally before claiming, with Anne Hall, another coupe des dames in the 1954 Tulip rally of Holland, a performance that also saw her winning outright the ten-lap race around the Zandvoort circuit. Winning a further ladies' award in the 1954 Viking rally in Norway successfully clinched the Ladies' European championship for Van Damm and Hall, a feat that they were set to repeat in 1955, after starting the season in fine style by gaining a coupe des dames after five years of trying, on the Monte Carlo rally.<br>
<br>Despite covering over 14,000 miles a year on rallies, Sheila Van Damm still managed to combine motor sport with helping her father run the Windmill Theatre. However, in October 1955 she asked Sir William Rootes to release her to devote her efforts more fully to the theatre. Her final rally for the Rootes team was the 1956 Monte Carlo, in which she overcame myriad problems to finish, but without award-winning success. She was also invited to partner the Le Mans driver Peter Harper at the wheel of a Sunbeam Rapier in the 1956 Mille Miglia road race. Despite the severity of the event, she maintained intact her record of finishing every event which she started in her five-year career. Averaging 66.37 m.p.h., she and Harper won their class.<br>
<br>Van Damm published her autobiography, <span class="italic">No Excuses</span>, in 1957. In 1958 she was appointed the first honorary colonel of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire battalion of the Women's Royal Army Corps (Territorial Army). She maintained her contacts with the motoring world as president of the Doghouse Club for motor-racing wives and ladies and later as president of the Sunbeam Talbot Owners' Club. Her first love, however, remained the Windmill Theatre. She continued its wartime reputation as &#145;the theatre that never closed&#146; and its revue format, supporting young comedians including Peter Sellers, Tony Hancock, Harry Secombe, and Bruce Forsyth. She inherited the Windmill from her father on his death in 1960 and energetically presided over the theatre for a further four years, before relinquishing the battle against the advancing tide of strip shows and permissive cinemas in the Soho area, which forced it to close in 1964.<br>
<br>Sheila Van Damm was well built, with dark hair and a round face. She never married and in later life moved to Broadford Bridge Farm, West Chiltington, Pulborough, in rural Sussex, where with her sister Nona she enjoyed running a small farm and stables, in addition to acting as a fund-raiser for the International Spinal Research Trust. She died of cancer at the London Clinic on 23 August 1987 and was subsequently commemorated by a memorial service at the West London Synagogue.<br>
