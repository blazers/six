<span class="headword">Margaret</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em> the Maid of Norway]</span>  (1282/3&#150;1290), <span class="occ">queen-designate of Scots</span>, was the only daughter of Erik II Magnusson, king of Norway (<i>d</i>. 1299), and his first wife, Margaret, the Maid of Scotland, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/323/', "Alexander III")</script>, whose marriage took place in August 1281; Queen Margaret died at T&oslash;nsberg on 9 April 1283, possibly in childbirth. On the death of the Lord Alexander in January 1284, Margaret was recognized by the Scottish magnates as heir presumptive to her grandfather on 5 February following; but after Alexander III's death on 18 or 19 March 1286 the succession remained in suspense until the following November because his widow was pregnant. Margaret then became heir, despite an unsuccessful Brus rising, and it became a concern of the Scottish community to carry out Alexander III's wish to marry her to a son of Edward I. The first need was to persuade her father to release her, and this was achieved at Salisbury on 6 November 1289, after Erik had been helped financially by Edward; four months later, in March 1290, Edward I sent formal proposals for a marriage between the Maid and Edward (later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8518/', "Edward II")</script>), offering to protect the independence of Scotland and the liberties of its prelates and magnates, but also designating Margaret as queen. The Scots were reluctant to agree because Edward demanded control of their castles, and he confirmed these promises at Northampton on 28 August 1290 because the Maid was about to sail from Norway. The text is ambiguous about her immediate destination: she was to come to Scotland or England in one clause, but in another would go to England and venture to Scotland only if it was peaceable. When she sailed in September 1290 her destination was Orkney.<br>
<br>In and after the treaty Edward I showed his intention to impose his will upon the Scots, through his agent, Antony (I) Bek, bishop of Durham, supposedly acting for Margaret as &#145;queen&#146;, but without waiting for her arrival, marriage, and inauguration. Before this, and after her death, Margaret was &#145;Lady of Scotland&#146; to the Scots; to see her as queen is misleading, and effectively connives at the manipulative insensitivity of those men, led by the English king, of whose ambition for political power she was the pathetic child victim. She would have become queen only after the traditional ceremonies at Scone. Margaret sailed from Norway in September 1290, accompanied by two Norwegian bishops, fell ill on the voyage, and died about the end of that month &#145;between the hands of Bishop Narve&#146; in Orkney  (Dunbar, 106), while the Scots gathered at Scone, presumably to inaugurate her. Her body was returned to Norway and buried beside her mother's in the choir of Christ's Kirk, Bergen.<br>
<br>In 1301 a woman from L&uuml;beck claiming to be Margaret was tried for treason and burned at Bergen.<br>
