<span class="headword">Rose, Sir  Philip</span>, first baronet  (1816&#150;1883), <span class="occ">lawyer and political agent</span>, was born in Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on 12 April 1816, third son in the family of four sons and one daughter of William Rose (1776&#150;1846), doctor of Wycombe, and Charlotte (1785&#150;1869), daughter of William Baly of Wycombe. Rose's family was civic-minded and supplied several mayors to Wycombe, including his father and his brother William, a surgeon. Rose was educated at Totteridge School, near Wycombe, and grew up a neighbour of the Disraeli family at Bradenham. In 1833 he was articled to a Beaconsfield lawyer, John Charsley. In 1836 he began working for Williamson and Hills, London, and was admitted a solicitor. In 1838 he became a partner in Barker and Rose, which by 1845 was the thriving Westminster firm of Baxter, Rose, and Norton, with a lucrative practice in electoral litigation and railway bills in the 1840s boom. Rose began his own shrewd investment career, and his family life similarly flourished. In 1840 he married Margaretta (<i>d</i>. 1889), daughter of Robert Ranking of Hastings; they had seven sons and three daughters. In 1847 he built his neo-Elizabethan mansion, Rayners, at Penn in Buckinghamshire.<br>
<br>When in 1846 Benjamin Disraeli suggested that Rose become his &#145;confidential man of business&#146;  (Disraeli, 4.1484), it was a definitive step for both. If Mary Anne Disraeli was the &#145;perfect wife&#146;, Rose was the perfect lawyer&#151;a &#145;virtuous <i>bourgeois</i>&#146;  (R. Blake, 449) and &#145;type-A&#146; personality whose efficiency, probity, and absolute discretion were precisely what was needed to make Disraeli respectable. Without Rose's management (and personal loans), Disraeli's unwieldy load of debt would have continually impeded his progress. Rose, however, saw Disraeli's potential and its benefits for himself. Gradually he stabilized and managed the creative financing which established Disraeli as a Buckinghamshire landowner at Hughenden with a secure parliamentary seat. In return Disraeli provided Rose with social and professional stepping-stones; he recommended him to influential friends, nominated him to the Conservative Club, and joined other prominent figures in publicizing the Brompton Hospital for Consumption, which Rose founded in 1841.<br>
<br>As Disraeli ascended, so did Rose. As chancellor of the exchequer in 1852 Disraeli appointed Rose chancery taxing officer at &pound;2000 p.a. This was not wholly recompense for past services; it freed Rose to work on Disraeli's reorganization of the amateurish and blatantly corrupt Conservative Party machine. In 1853 Rose became election manager, unpaid and largely unseen &#145;Principal Agent&#146;  (Stewart, 280) between the constituencies and Disraeli's whip, Sir William Jolliffe. He drew up an initial agenda, found suitable agents, attended to voter registration, and tried with some success to institute central funding. The detailed dossiers he compiled on every constituency between 1855 and 1859 were the basis for improved Conservative election strategy in the 1860s. He also undertook party liaison with newspapers and was general manager of Disraeli's own paper, <span class="italic">The Press</span>. The Conservative government of 1858 made him county court treasurer because, Disraeli told Derby, &#145;No language can do justice to the labors of Rose for our party&#146;  (Disraeli to Derby, 14 April 1858). He then worked closely with Disraeli and Derby on their 1859 <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>. Some leaders felt that &#145;such a man&#146;  (Hardinge, 138&#150;9) had no place at their councils and questioned his figures. These were, however, firmly based on first-hand research into voters and constituencies. Possibly his bias &#145;for the middle class men&#146;  (Rose to Earle, Bodl. Oxf., MS Hughenden R/I/B/73a) was simply too democratic for the Conservatives.<br>
<br>Ironically for a man almost pathologically horrified by corruption, Rose's official party work ended in charges of electoral collusion after Disraeli's secretary, Ralph Earle, withdrew from Berwick in 1859. The subsequent inquiry cleared Earle, Rose, and Disraeli, but Rose had already resigned. He continued unofficial research and electioneering, but expanded into a more congenial area, international finance, where he invested profitably for himself and his clients, including Disraeli (under Rose's name). He travelled widely and negotiated foreign bond issues, such as an 1865 conversion of the Turkish debt (known as the &#145;fly paper&#146; bonds), and he liked to recount how he suggested purchase of the Suez Canal to Disraeli eighteen months before the 1875 coup. In 1868 he helped found the first investment trust, the Foreign and Colonial Government Trust, and the Association (later Corporation) of Foreign Bondholders, while serving on the boards of many City companies. In 1872 he strongly dissociated himself from his partners' decision to act for the notorious <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20855/', "Tichborne claimant")</script>, and in the autumn retired from the firm to concentrate on his companies and work with the French financier Emile d'Erlanger. His relationship with Disraeli was now very close; in 1870, during one of Rose's recurrent collapses from overwork, Disraeli wrote anxiously, &#145;I have no friend dearer to me than yourself&#146;  (Disraeli to Rose, 20 Oct 1870, Bodl. Oxf., MS Hughenden R/I/A/239). Disraeli got posts and promotions for Rose's sons and sons-in-law, while Rose managed litigation and finance and supported &#145;the Chief&#146; through his bereavement of sister (1859), brother (1868), and wife (1872). One of Disraeli's first creations in his second administration (1874) was a baronetcy for Rose, a formal recognition of his party services but also a personal gesture of gratitude, &#145;Fancy&#146;, Rose wrote to Montagu Corry, &#145;such an honor for such an 'umble individual&#146;  (Rose to Corry, 4 June 1875, Bodl. Oxf., MS Hughenden B/XX/R/74).<br>
<br>Disraeli's death in 1881 left one last task, the sorting of Disraeli's papers. Rose's notes often provide valuable personal perspectives, but as keeper of the flame he was positively incendiary. He burnt many papers, mainly on financial matters, and &#145;removed&#146; others which he thought scandalous. He only reluctantly agreed, for example, not to destroy correspondence on Disraeli's sexual affairs, and a brief summary replaced letters about Disraeli's involvement with the gaming debts of Derby's younger brother. Rose died of long-standing chest and respiratory problems at his home, 1 Cromwell Road, Kensington, on 17 April 1883, two days before Disraeli's statue was unveiled in Parliament Square, and was buried at St Margaret's Church, Tyler's Green, Buckinghamshire, on 21 April.<br>
<br>Rose's eldest son, <a name="cosubject_49366"></a><span class="headword">Sir Philip Frederick Rose</span>, second baronet  (1843&#150;1919), <span class="occ">solicitor and businessman</span>, then became Disraeli's executor. The younger Rose was born in London on 4 November 1843, educated at Harrow School from 1857 to 1860, and joined his father's firm in 1865. On 25 July 1866 he married Rose Annie Pym (<i>d</i>. 1925). He travelled even more widely than his father on financial business, from US investment trusts to British and foreign railways. He retired in 1894, and, after the death of Disraeli's literary executor, Lord Rowton, in 1903, he initiated and discreetly controlled the official biography by W. F. Monypenny and G. E. Buckle. Consequently, Monypenny's early volumes sanitize Disraeli's debts, give no hints of mistresses, and entirely omit marital spats; Buckle's later volumes were likewise subjected to Rose's approval. In 1917, after completion of the last volume, he again purged the papers and recorded destruction of &#145;a great many&#146;  (P. F. Rose, memo, Bodl. Oxf., MS Hughenden R/I/C/1). Having thus arbitrarily removed primary biographical materials but scrupulously fulfilled his father's motto, <i>probitate ac virtute</i>, he died at the family home, Rayners, on 23 October 1919.<br>
