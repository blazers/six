<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fenn, Sir  John</span>  (1739&#150;1794), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 12 November 1739 in Norwich Cathedral close, the eldest son of John Fenn (1707&#150;1741), a surgeon, and his wife, Mary (<i>b</i>. 1712), daughter of Jacob Emerson of Gressenhall. After his father's death, his mother moved to North Elmham in 1743, and to East Dereham in 1746. Fenn was educated at the grammar schools of Scarning and later Botesdale, where he was befriended by the elderly antiquary Thomas Martin of Palgrave. At seventeen he was admitted pensioner to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1761 and proceeded MA in 1764, when he was also elected to a fellowship.<br>
<br>At university Fenn became friends with John Norris, son of the antiquary Anthony Norris, and with John Frere. In 1763 he began courting Ellenor Frere (1744&#150;1813) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9279/', "Fenn, Ellenor, Lady Fenn")</script>], John's sister and daughter of Sheppard Frere and Susanna Hatley; they married on 1 January 1766. She was subsequently the author of many children's books, writing under the pseudonyms of Mrs Teachwell and Mrs Lovechild. After their marriage the couple lived at Hill House, East Dereham. They had no children, but brought up an orphaned heiress, Miss Andrews, and later their nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10176/', "William Frere (1775&#150;1836)")</script>. Fenn led an active civic life, serving as commissioner of the land tax in 1765, deputy lieutenant in 1766, director of the local house of industry in 1775, and a magistrate from 1776. He was also a friend of the Greek translator Robert Potter, and compiled a manuscript history of Potter's school at Scarning.<br>
<br>Between 1768 and 1775 Fenn and Antony Norris helped William Whittingham to publish the remaining parts of Charles Parkin's continuation of Francis Blomefield's <span class="italic">History of Norfolk</span>. In 1769 he started corresponding with the antiquaries James Granger and Richard Gough, and in January 1771 was elected to the Society of Antiquaries, shortly before the death of Thomas Martin, his mentor.<br>
<br>Martin had died insolvent, and in an attempt to prevent the piecemeal sale of his library Fenn assisted William Whittingham in listing and valuing the collection on behalf of the executors. He made an offer for the whole of &pound;500, but was outbid by John Worth, a Diss apothecary, early in 1772. Thereafter he assisted Worth in cataloguing many of the manuscripts prior to their public sale in 1773 and 1774; in return he was given choice items and permitted to buy others privately. Likewise after Worth's death in December 1774 Fenn performed a similar task for his executors. During this period he acquired the Paston letters, which had been discovered by Francis Blomefield and were subsequently acquired by Martin. In 1784 Fenn wrote a biography of Martin (published in 1904), and published <span class="italic">Three Chronological Tables, Exhibiting a State of the Society of Antiquaries of London</span>. He also contributed periodically to the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Between 1777 and 1782 Fenn unsuccessfully attempted to interest the Society of Antiquaries in publishing some of the historic letters in his possession. There was plenty of encouragement from individual members such as Gough, Horace Walpole, Edward King, and Sir John Cullum, and so he decided to publish the most interesting of the Paston letters himself, as a parallel text, giving a transcription and modern translation. The first two volumes of Fenn's <span class="italic">Original Letters</span> appeared in January 1787, and were dedicated to the king. The work was a literary sensation, quickly selling out, and warranting a reprint, which included additional notes by George Steevens. The reception also encouraged the editor to prepare two further volumes. The originals of those already published were exhibited to the public at the Society of Antiquaries, and when George III expressed an interest in them in May 1787, Fenn bound and presented them to him. In return he received a knighthood.<br>
<br>Fenn employed a young amanuensis, William Dalton, to help with the transcriptions for the remaining volumes. Thus the editor was able to publish a third and a fourth volume in May 1789, and had made substantial progress with a fifth. However, his progress was set back during 1792 and 1793 by his appointment as sheriff of Norfolk, an office he characteristically undertook with great zeal. The text of the last volume was complete and Fenn was working on an introduction and history of the Paston family when he suffered an apoplectic stroke. He died on 14 February 1794 at home at Hill House, and was buried in Finningham, Suffolk, where there is a mural monument. The manuscript remained with Lady Fenn until her death in November 1813, and passed to William Frere who published it in 1823.<br>
<br>In 1865 doubts were cast on the authenticity of Fenn's edition of the Paston letters, in the <span class="italic">Fortnightly Review</span>, owing to the disappearance of the originals. The rediscovery of many of the letters gave rise to a detailed investigation by the Society of Antiquaries. Fenn was shown to have been a competent, rigorous, and accurate editor, although unsurprisingly he had misdated some of the letters. His transcriptions were used as the basis for James Gairdner's editions between 1872 and 1904.<br>
