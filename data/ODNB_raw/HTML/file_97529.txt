<span class="headword">Carter,  Denis Victor</span>, Baron Carter  (1932&#150;2006), <span class="occ">farmer and politician</span>, was born on 17 January 1932 at 39 Hayles Street, Southwark, London, the son of Albert William Carter (<i>d</i>. 1973), tea warehouseman, and his wife, Annie Julia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tynan (<i>d</i>. 1972). The family later moved to Hove, Sussex, where they ran a sweetshop and later a caf&eacute;. After attending six different schools in seven years, Carter was sent to Xaverian College in Brighton, where he met his future wife, Teresa Mary May Greengoe, daughter of Cecil William Walter Greengoe. They eventually married on 3 August 1957; Carter was an agricultural student by that time, and she a primary school teacher. They had one son, Andrew (<i>b</i>. 1963), who died at the age of nineteen, and one daughter, Catherine (<i>b</i>. 1959), who died at the age of forty-four. Both suffered from the hereditary degenerative condition retinitis pigmentosa, and in addition Andrew had a defective heart.<br>
<br>Carter, a city boy with no agricultural connections who was to become one of the most knowledgeable men in Britain on agriculture, had developed the idea of becoming a farmer between 1950 and 1952 when he was doing his national service in the Suez Canal zone working as an audit clerk. After returning to England he went back into accounting and worked for a company in London but the &#145;call of the land&#146; was persistent, and two years later he enrolled at the East Sussex Institute of Agriculture, followed by Writtle Agricultural College, Essex, where he obtained the national diploma in agriculture and the queen's award for the country's highest marks. Much later, in 1970, he was awarded a two-year senior research fellowship in agricultural marketing at the Institute of Agricultural Economics at Worcester College, Oxford, where he gained a BLitt in 1972.<br>
<br>In 1957 Carter founded and became director of an agricultural accounting and management company, AKC Ltd, which grew to manage and handle the accounts of a large number of farms, mainly in southern England. He held this position for forty years until 1997, when he entered government. At the same time he also began farming himself, first in Oxfordshire and then on a larger scale in Wiltshire and Hampshire. In 1968 he founded and then worked for thirty years with United Oilseeds, which expanded, largely under his guidance, into a substantial farm trading operation. United Oilseeds was responsible for introducing large-scale oilseed rape marketing into Britain and later encouraged the production of opium poppies as a profitable medical crop.<br>
<br>Carter stood once for parliament. Encouraged by Wilfred Cave, a Wiltshire farmer and staunch Labour supporter, he contested Basingstoke as the Labour candidate in the election of 1970 but was unsuccessful. In the mid-1970s, during the boom in agricultural land prices, Carter served on the Northfield committee, investigating especially the effect of City funds on land prices. Other farming appointments followed including, in 1982, being elected chairman of the Farmers' Club, of which he was later a trustee. Many other organizations gained from Carter's enthusiasm, expertise, sharp mind, down-to-earth approach, and dry humour. He chaired the BBC rural affairs and agriculture committee from 1987 to 1990; in 1993 Michael Heseltine appointed him to chair the UK Co-operative Council, a post he held until 1997; he was president of the Guild of Agricultural Journalists from 1994 to 1996 and of the British Institute of Agricultural Consultants from 1992 to 1997. He was also a member of two agricultural discussion clubs, Turners (in Stockbridge) and Grasshoppers (in Amesbury).<br>
<br>In 1987, on Neil Kinnock's recommendation, Carter was created a life peer as Baron Carter, acting for his first ten years as an authoritative opposition spokesman on rural affairs. He was also opposition spokesman on social security from 1988 to 1990 and health from 1989 to 1992, the latter with special reference to the disabled. His experience of bringing up children with a degenerative disease causing increasing disability made him a sensitive spokesman in the Lords on these complex and important issues. In 2003, when he chaired the joint committee on the draft <span class="roman">Mental Capacity Bill</span>, he won cross-party support for the legislation and was particularly successful in ensuring that people with learning disabilities could present evidence to his committee. In memory of their children the Carters set up the Andrew and Catherine Carter Foundation Trust to help disabled people. He was made an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in recognition for his work for the disabled.<br>
<br>From 1990 to 1992 Carter was deputy opposition chief whip in the House of Lords, and when Labour gained power in 1997 he was appointed captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms (government chief whip), deputy chairman of various committees and deputy speaker, and was sworn of the privy council. For five years until 2002 he steered a heavy legislative programme including the <span class="roman">Human Rights Act</span> through the House of Lords, and he was involved in the negotiations that led to the compromise in the <span class="italic">House of Lords Act</span> 1999, which retained ninety-two hereditary peers in the first stage of reform. Carter himself was a strong supporter of Lords reform. A year after the start of Tony Blair's second term as prime minister he stood down as chief whip in the Lords, having reached the age of seventy. Still farming, he remained an active member of the House of Lords and became vice-chairman of the English Farming and Food Partnership and the British Association for Biofuels and Oils, and president of the Forestry and Timber Association and the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers. He was voted peer of the year in 2003.<br>
<br>Carter was a man of courage and vision who was respected by all members of the House of Lords, loyal to his political party and its values, committed to those who lived and worked in rural enterprise, dedicated to his wider belief in caring for the disabled, and, above all, a committed Roman Catholic. He died of cancer of the pancreas at the Royal Marsden Hospital, Chelsea, London, on 18 December 2006. Baroness Amos, leader of the House of Lords, in paying tribute to him, recalled that she had visited him only a few hours before his death, to find him filling in his tax return. He was survived by his wife, Teresa.<br>
