<span class="headword">Maguire,  Connor <span class="st"> [Cornelius]</span></span>, second baron of Enniskillen  (<em>c.</em>1612&#150;1645), <span class="occ">conspirator</span>, was born in co. Fermanagh, Ireland, the eldest of four sons (there were also four daughters) of Brian Roe Maguire, first baron of Enniskillen (<i>c</i>.1589&#150;1633), and Rose ny Neale, daughter of Art Mac Avernan O Neile, of co. Armagh. This branch of the Maguires supported the English during the Nine Years' War and was granted the Magherastephana barony in co. Fermanagh, which Maguire still owned in 1641, making him one of the most substantial surviving Gaelic landowners in Ulster. In his youth Maguire attended school with John Clotworthy, and he reputedly spent some time at Magdalen College, Oxford. He was certainly fluent in both Irish and English. Upon the death of his father in 1633 he inherited the title baron of Enniskillen. Related to many of the leading Ulster Irish families, by 1633 Maguire was married to Mary, daughter of Thomas Fleming, of Castle Fleming, co. Cavan; they had several sons.<br>
<br>Maguire attended the Dublin parliaments of 1634 and 1640&#150;41. About February 1641, while in Dublin, Roger Moore initiated him into a plot of the Irish gentry to redress Irish Catholic grievances, playing on the baron's huge debts and valuing his influential kinship ties both in Ulster and (through his wife) in the pale; the activation of such ties seems to have been Maguire's chief role in the plot. With his brother Rory (subsequently Irish leader in co. Fermanagh) Maguire was one of the Irish notables who in May 1641 sent an emissary to his uncle Owen Roe O'Neill in Flanders, asking him to support their plan. In August, Maguire first learned of the plan to take Dublin Castle. At his later examination he alleged that his intention in the plot was to exert pressure in favour of remedying grievances of Roman Catholics, including gaining toleration of their religion. In Ulster and in his native co. Fermanagh, Maguire solicited the support of the Irish gentry for the plot. However, his cousin Brian Maguire was clearly reluctant to become involved: the baron wrote to him, noting his partiality towards the English, and making threatening remarks about those who would not support the Irish action. About 21 October 1641 Fergus O'Howen, follower of Brian Maguire, came to John Carmick in Enniskillen Castle to warn him about the plot to take Dublin and Enniskillen; Carmick told Sir William Cole, who sent word to the lords justices. This report was confirmed by Flartagh McHugh, who was sent by Brian Mac Conaght Maguire to Enniskillen Castle to warn Sir William Cole.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, a day or two earlier Maguire, together with Hugh Mac Mahon and a number of gentlemen from co. Fermanagh and co. Monaghan, had set out for Dublin. The conspirators were to meet in the lodging of Mac Mahon. On the night of 22 October Owen Connolly, servant of Sir John Clotworthy, informed Lord Justice Parsons of the plan to take Dublin Castle; later that evening, Mac Mahon was captured, and a watch was set on the house in Castle Street where Maguire, with about twelve followers, was lodging. A number of weapons was found and linked to Maguire's group. The following morning Maguire was apprehended in Cooke Street, behind the locked door of a cockloft. As an indication of the peer's standing in the conspiracy, and in contrast to the opinion of Sir Henry Bruce, who in the following month referred to the baron as &#145;but a drunken fellow of no importance&#146;  (Ches. &amp; Chester ALSS, MS DCC 47/9), it was alleged that after the Irish took Charlemont Castle, co. Armagh (22 October), they desired to exchange Toby Caulfeild for Maguire; this did not happen, however, and Caulfeild was subsequently killed.<br>
<br>On 26 March 1642 Maguire was examined by order of the lords justices and made a voluntary statement. On 12 June 1642, along with Mac Mahon and Lieutenant-Colonel John Reade, he was transferred to Westminster and lodged in the Tower of London. In February 1643 the prisoners were removed to Newgate prison, where there were complaints about their poor treatment. On 18 August 1644, using saws procured by a Scotswoman, Maguire and Mac Mahon escaped from the Tower; by 13 September they, together with two accessories to the escape, were traced to the Spanish ambassador's house; the escapees were recaptured on 18 September having taken refuge in the house of Mrs Leviston (or Levinsteyn), a Flemish Catholic, where the French envoy resided. The Spanish ambassador, Don Alonso de Cardenas, denied any involvement in the escape bid, while admitting that the accomplices, two priests (one Irish, one English), had been part of his household.<br>
<br>In November 1644 Maguire and Mac Mahon were arraigned before Justice Bacon at the court of the king's bench, and charged with high treason. Mac Mahon was tried first, found guilty, and executed. However, Maguire pleaded that his Irish peerage entitled him to a trial by his peers in Ireland. This was the subject of legal wrangling which entailed that the trial was deferred until February 1645. William Prynne was the leading prosecutor, who argued that trial in England for treason committed elsewhere was valid, citing the precedents of the O'Rourke case (1591), and the trial of Sir John Perrott (1592). Judge Bacon ruled against Maguire's plea, holding that a baron of Ireland was triable by a jury in England. Thereafter the English parliament endorsed Bacon's judgment. Maguire was found guilty, thereby forfeiting his title and lands; he petitioned the Commons to avoid being hanged, drawn, and quartered, citing his dignity as a peer, but the petition was rejected. In court Sir John Clotworthy spoke for the condemned, referring to their schooldays together, and recalling letters of Maguire in which, allegedly, he expressed remorse.<br>
<br>In his will, composed shortly before his execution, Maguire left &pound;50 to be divided among the Franciscan friaries of south Ulster, and entrusted his will to Lisgoole friary. On 20 February 1645 Maguire was drawn by sledge from the Tower to Tyburn. Denied the services of a Franciscan friar, he faced persistent questioning from Sheriff Gibbs and Dr Sibbald, a puritan divine, asking if he were sorry for the deaths of the Irish protestants. Before the crowd Maguire forgave his enemies, and affirmed his adherence to Roman Catholicism and his trust in Jesus Christ. While he was hanging, an officer cut the rope, letting Maguire drop alive, and commanded the executioner to open him. A struggle between condemned and executioner ensued, and, to spare him, the executioner cut the peer's throat.<br>
