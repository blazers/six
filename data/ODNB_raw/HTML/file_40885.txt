<span class="headword">&Oacute;engus of Tallaght</span> <span class="st"> [St &Oacute;engus, &Oacute;engus the Culdee]</span>  (<em>fl. </em><em>c.</em>830), <span class="occ">bishop and writer</span>, was the son of &Oacute;engoba, but was more commonly known as the grandson of O&iacute;bl&eacute;n who, according to a late pedigree, belonged to the D&aacute;l nAraidi, who controlled a territory corresponding to the north of modern co. Down and much of co. Antrim. Little that can be trusted is known of &Oacute;engus's career. In the late preface to the martyrology attributed to him, he is said to have been raised at Cluain Eidnech (now Clonenagh in the barony of Maryborough West, Laois), where he is also supposed to have been buried. However, this is not supported by the internal evidence of the martyrology, which, for example, relegates the feast of St Fintan, patron of Cluain Eidnech, to second place in the list for his day. What is clear from the martyrology is that &Oacute;engus was a cleric&#151;he uses <i>pauper&aacute;n</i> and <i>deidbl&eacute;n</i>, both meaning &#145;pauper&#146; (that is, cleric), to describe himself. He belonged to the community of St M&aacute;el Ruain at Tallaght, a few miles south of the modern city of Dublin. To this coincidence is owed his possibly bogus title of C&eacute;ile D&eacute;, or Culdee, which has been commonly assigned to him since the seventeenth century. As a centre of the ascetic reform of the late eighth and early ninth century, Tallaght was closely associated with the new emphasis on the role of the <i>c&eacute;ile D&eacute;</i> (literally, &#145;God's client&#146;).<br>
<br>The office more properly &Oacute;engus's, however, appears to have been that of bishop. He is so described, for instance, in an addition to the list of saints commemorated on 11 March in the martyrology of Tallaght, a work composed at about the same time and in the same place as his. Therefore, he would have occupied a very important position, with primary responsibility for many liturgical functions, not only within his own monastery, but also possibly within the whole group of reformed churches associated with Tallaght. Many of these were new foundations and &Oacute;engus seems to have been directly involved in at least two of them, both named D&iacute;sert &Oacute;engusa (&#145;&Oacute;engus's Hermitage&#146;) after him; one is in what is now co. Limerick, the other in Laois.<br>
<br>As a bishop, with primary responsibility for liturgical matters, and as a reformer, &Oacute;engus would have been well qualified to undertake the composition of a martyrology. The text attributed to him, the martyrology (or <i>F&eacute;ilire</i>) of &Oacute;engus, survives in some ten manuscripts, the earliest of which, the <span class="roman">Leabhar Breac</span> (&#145;Speckled book&#146;), now MS 23 P 16 (or 1230) in the Royal Irish Academy, dates to the early fifteenth century. Previously thought to have been composed between 797 and 808, the martyrology has recently been redated to between 828 and 833. It remains, however, the earliest extant vernacular metrical martyrology, consisting of 365 quatrains in strict metre preceded by a prologue of 340 lines and followed by an epilogue of 566 lines. A prose preface was added to the text at a later stage, together with extensive notes and glosses.<br>
<br>When composing his martyrology, &Oacute;engus used as his only source the martyrology of Tallaght, a shortened version of the Hieronymian martyrology with extensive added lists of Irish saints for each day of the year. This survives incompletely in three manuscripts, the earliest of which, the <span class="roman">Book of Leinster</span>, now Dublin, Trinity College, MS 1339, was begun about 1151. Based on an exemplar which has been shown to have reached Ireland from Northumbria, passing on the way from Lindisfarne to Iona, this text can be dated to about the same time as that attributed to &Oacute;engus.<br>
<br>There are cogent grounds for believing that &Oacute;engus may also have been the author or compiler of his source, the martyrology of Tallaght. A priori, it is extremely unlikely that anyone else would have been as experienced as he in these matters in the monastery of Tallaght at this time. Also, the assumption that he had recently compiled the much more substantial text of his one and only source would make greater sense of the claim in the epilogue to his metrical work that he had used several other named sources including &#145;the antigraph of Jerome, the martyrology of Eusebius&#146; and &#145;Ireland's host of books&#146;  (<span class="italic">F&eacute;lire &Oacute;engusso C&eacute;li D&eacute;</span>, ll. 137&#150;41). And, most importantly, having &#145;reckoned their feasts&#146; he went on in his epilogue  (ibid., ll. 229ff.) to number the troops of his saints, referring by name in the process to several figures excluded from his own martyrology but included in the martyrology of Tallaght. Cases in point are Noah, Isaiah, Abraham, Honoratus, and Benedict.<br>
<br>If, as is suggested here, &Oacute;engus was the author not only of the metrical martyrology called after him but also of its source, the martyrology of Tallaght, then he has the distinction of standing at the very beginning of the extant Irish martyrological tradition. The influence of his texts can be seen at work in all later martyrologies belonging in this tradition, which ended with the compilation of the martyrology of Donegal by M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Cl&eacute;irigh in 1630. Few if any early medieval Irish authors can have been more influential than &Oacute;engus over a period of almost exactly eight hundred years.<br>
