<span class="headword">Anders,  W&#322;adys&#322;aw</span>  (1892&#150;1970), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was born on 11 August 1892 in B&#322;onie, in the county of Kutno, in Russian Poland. The eldest of four sons of Catholic parents, he attended secondary school in Warsaw, and moved with the family to Latvia, then part of the Russian empire, when his father, Albert Anders, was appointed administrator of one of the tsar's estates. Anders spent the years 1910&#150;14 as an undergraduate at the Riga polytechnic and as an officer cadet at a Russian military college. From the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 until the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 he served in a cavalry division in the Russian army, whereupon, as a squadron commander, he helped form the 1st lancers regiment of the 1st Polish corps, 1917&#150;18. In 1918 he married Irena Jordan-Krakowska, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Pruszy&#324;ski, with whom he had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>When Poland regained her independence (as the second republic) in November 1918 after more than a century of partition, Anders joined the Wielkopolski branch of the nascent Polish army as a staff officer in early 1919. As Poland fought to consolidate her independence and establish her borders in those tumultuous early post-war years, he led the 15th lancers regiment with great distinction, particularly in the Polish&#150;Soviet War in 1919&#150;21, for which he and also his regiment were awarded the silver cross Virtuti Militari, Poland's highest military decoration. He attended the &Eacute;cole Sup&eacute;rieure de Guerre in France, Poland's formal ally since 1921, and graduated in 1923. Two years later he captained the Polish equestrian team at the international competition in Nice, where it won the coveted nations' cup. In May 1926, when chief of staff to General Tadeusz Rozwadowski, Colonel Anders remained loyal to the legally elected government in the face of the successful coup against it by the former head of state, Marshal J&oacute;zef Pi&#322;sudski. However, unlike some others who had acted similarly, his career did not suffer under the new <i>Sanacja</i> regime, for he was subsequently appointed to a number of senior posts, including chief of staff of the general inspectorate of cavalry (1926&#150;8), commander of the second independent cavalry brigade (1928&#150;37), and commander of the Nowogr&oacute;dzka cavalry brigade (1937&#150;9). His reputation as a brave, energetic, and decisive leader firmly consolidated, and much admired by Marshal Pi&#322;sudski, Anders was promoted major-general in 1934.<br>
<br>In the September campaign of 1939 Anders led the Nowogr&oacute;dzka cavalry brigade against the Wehrmacht, and was twice wounded. After being ordered to the east to engage the Red Army, he was captured, imprisoned, and tortured by the NKVD (Soviet secret police), latterly in Moscow's notorious Lubyanka gaol (1939&#150;41). Following the agreement in July 1941 between the London-based Polish government of General W&#322;adys&#322;aw Sikorski and the Soviet government, which allowed, <i>inter alia</i>, for the creation of a Polish army from Poles interned in the Soviet Union, Anders was released to assume its command. When it transpired that the Soviets were failing to honour fully their commitments under this agreement and were unable to account satisfactorily for the disappearance of thousands of Polish officers whom they had captured in 1939&#151;later confirmed as the Katy&#324; massacre&#151;Anders decided to lead those who had managed to join him out of the Soviet Union to Persia and then on to the Middle East. Despite suffering many appalling hardships, over 100,000 Poles, the so-called Anders's army, eventually reached Palestine in 1943. It was quickly moulded into a formidable fighting unit, the 2nd Polish corps, which proceeded to play a decisive role in the allies' Italian campaign. Above all, its role in the final capture, on 18 May 1944, of the Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino, the pivotal part of the Germans' defensive Gustav line, confirmed Anders's status as one of the leading Polish and allied army commanders of the war. His troops scored further important successes, most notably at Ancona and Bologna.<br>
<br>Before the war in Europe ended, however, Anders had clashed with the Polish government and the allies over policy towards the Soviet Union, with particular reference to the fate of Poland's eastern provinces, including the historically Polish cities of Wilno and Lw&oacute;w. He vehemently opposed any compromise on Poland's eastern border, as defined by the treaty of Riga, which had concluded the Polish&#150;Soviet War in 1921. Consequently, he rejected as a betrayal the decision of the allied powers at the Yalta conference in February 1945 to allow the Soviet Union to annex the eastern provinces.<br>
<br>Anders received numerous major decorations from Poland and the allies, including an honorary Order of the Bath from Great Britain. Together with most of his 2nd corps, which transferred to Britain from Italy in 1946, and tens of thousands of other Polish former servicemen, he refused to return to a Soviet-dominated communist Poland&#151;the antithesis of what they had fought for so courageously throughout the war. From exile in London, Anders, as inspector-general (1946&#150;54) and commander-in-chief (1946&#150;70) of the Polish armed forces in exile, emerged as one of the most outspoken critics of the Warsaw regime and, conversely, as one of the staunchest advocates of the cause of a free and independent Poland. For this, and also for encouraging the view that war between the west and the Soviet Union was inevitable in the near future, he was incessantly vilified by the communists, who had also annulled his Polish citizenship as early as September 1946. Divorced from his first wife, Anders married on 6 May 1948 (Irena) Renata, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jarosiewicz, the divorced wife of Gwidon Gottlieb. They had a daughter.<br>
<br>Anders, who lived at Brondesbury Park, in north-west London, played a prominent role in the disputatious, faction-ridden world of Polish &eacute;migr&eacute; politics. Following a bitter and lasting split in the &eacute;migr&eacute; community in 1954, when he was appointed full general, he became a member (1954&#150;70) of the &#145;council of three&#146; in opposition to another group around August Zaleski, president of the exiled Polish government, and also chaired for a time the prestigious national treasury commission. Besides his conspicuous involvement in many other facets of &eacute;migr&eacute; life, he published his memoirs, <span class="italic">Bez ostatniego rozdzia&#322;u: wspomniennia z lat 1939&#150;1946</span> (1949; English version, <span class="italic">An Army in Exile</span>, 1949) and <span class="italic">Kl&#281;ska Hitlera w Rosji, 1941&#150;1945</span> (1952; English version, <span class="italic">Hitler's Defeat in Russia, 1941&#150;1945</span>, Chicago, 1953). He won libel cases against the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span> newspaper in 1951 and a Polish-language newspaper in 1960.<br>
<br>Anders died at the Central Middlesex Hospital, Park Royal, Brent, London, on 12 May 1970, the twenty-sixth anniversary of the beginning of the battle of Monte Cassino, with which his name will always be associated. Fittingly, and according to his own wishes, he was buried that month beside his fallen comrades in the Polish military cemetery there, the scene of an annual commemorative service since 1946.<br>
<br>An outstanding leader in war and peace, Anders occupies an assured place in the pantheon of modern Polish heroes, a status acknowledged by post-communist Poland in 1995 with the posthumous award of the order of the White Eagle. Many major public amenities in Poland are now named after him, and a special commemorative silver coin was issued in 2002.<br>
