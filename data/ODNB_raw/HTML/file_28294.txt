<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Villiers,  George</span>, second duke of Buckingham  (1628&#150;1687), <span class="occ">politician and wit</span>, was born on 30 January 1628 at Wallingford House, Westminster, the third child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28293/', "George Villiers, first duke of Buckingham (1592&#150;1628)")</script>, courtier and royal favourite, and Lady Katherine Manners (later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69581/', "Katherine MacDonnell")</script>; 1603?&#150;1649), eldest daughter of the earl of Rutland. His elder brother, Charles, died in infancy. Following the murder of their father in 1628 Buckingham and his posthumous younger brother, Lord Francis Villiers, were brought up with the king's children in the royal nursery at Richmond. In 1636 Buckingham was placed under the joint guardianship of the earls of Rutland and Newcastle. In 1641 he was sent up to Trinity College, Cambridge, and was admitted to the degree of MA on 5 March 1642.<h2>
<a name="Dividedloyalties16421661"></a>Divided loyalties, 1642&#150;1661</h2>Buckingham's youth prevented his taking part in the military campaigns of the civil war, but he and Francis did attend the siege of Lichfield Close in April 1643. Parliament reacted by sequestering the lands and movable goods of the two brothers (10 February 1644). That same year the boys' interests were placed in the hands of Algernon Percy, the parliamentarian earl of Northumberland, and William Aylesbury, a royalist whose father had served the first duke. In 1646 Aylesbury took the two boys on a continental tour to complete their education: &#145;I was not thought of age sufficient to beare armes&#146; said Buckingham later  (BL, Add. MS 18979, fol. 286) while Northumberland lobbied parliament to have the sequestered goods returned. On 4 October 1647 the Commons lifted the sequestration order. Despite this, the two Villiers boys took up royalist arms in the second civil war, apparently emboldened by the Commons' reported insulting of the first duke. They joined the earls of Holland and Peterborough for action in Surrey. Parliament, with advance intelligence of their movements, secured all the strategic local outposts, and on 7 July 1648 Francis Villiers was killed in a skirmish near Kingston. Three days later Buckingham and Holland were intercepted at St Neots in Huntingdonshire; Holland was captured, while Buckingham escaped to the continent.<br>
<br>The execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649 prompted many royalists to abandon the cause and compound for their confiscated estates, and Buckingham was no different. In April he approached parliament through his aristocratic sympathizers, Northumberland, Pembroke, and Denbigh, but could not accept the &#145;base submissions&#146; required of him  (O. Ogle and others, ed., <span class="italic">Calendar of the Clarendon State Papers Preserved in the Bodleian Library</span>, 5 vols., 1869&#150;70, 2.7). Instead, he joined the future Charles II's court in exile, quickly establishing himself among the pragmatists who were urging the prince to form an alliance with the Scottish presbyterians. His advance in royal favour was both rapid and tangible. On 19 September 1649 he was created a knight of the Garter; on 25 January 1650 he was commissioned to raise and supply troops on the continent, and on 6 April was sworn to the privy council. Accompanying Charles to Scotland, he attached himself to their presbyterian host, the marquess of Argyll, and that way survived the Scots' purge of the royal household. In February 1651 a royalist&#150;presbyterian army was mobilized, top-heavy in senior officers appointed to satisfy rival factions, in which Buckingham was commissioned to lead the English royalists. He was, nevertheless, dismayed to find that the Scot David Leslie outranked him, and although he, like Charles, escaped to the continent after the crushing defeat at Worcester (3 September 1651), the snub appears to have soured relations between the boyhood friends for many years to come.<br>
<br>Barred from royal counsels, and with his financial credit exhausted, Buckingham's career now took a bewildering switchback course, glimpsed briefly and intermittently in the censorious correspondence of senior royalists-in-exile such as Hyde and Nicholas, and in the intelligence reports of Cromwell's agents. For the next five years he was variously reported as having made his peace with Cromwell, spying for Cromwell, and co-ordinating an ambitious scheme to unite France, the papacy, royalists, and republicans in the overthrow of the protectorate. In 1657, having the previous year failed in an attempt to reconcile himself with Charles, Buckingham returned to England and paid suit to Mary Fairfax (1638&#150;1704), daughter and sole heir of Thomas, Lord Fairfax, the parliamentarian general. Mary, smitten with the duke, broke off her engagement to the earl of Chesterfield, and Buckingham and Mary were married on 15 September at Bolton Percy in Yorkshire. As Fairfax had been granted the major portion of the duke's confiscated estates, the marriage was a blatantly opportunist move to secure his inheritance. Because the Fairfax family were known to be in contact with royalist agents Cromwell feared subterfuge, and ordered Buckingham's arrest. The following spring this was commuted to house arrest, and when in August he broke this, he was placed in the Tower. Brian Fairfax later suggested that only Cromwell's death, on 3 September, prevented the duke's execution  (BL, Harleian MS 6862, fol. 10), but no such warrant was issued, and it is most unlikely that the protector would have alienated Fairfax in this way. The duke was released on 21 February 1659, Fairfax standing security of &pound;20,000.<br>
<br>The council now allowed Buckingham to retire to Fairfax's Nunappleton estate in Yorkshire. He was thus able to join the force that Fairfax raised in January 1660, an action which facilitated General Monck's unchallenged passage to London. Even so, Buckingham received no more than a royal pardon at the Restoration, and achieved the distinction of being the only former privy councillor still alive not to be resworn to the new council. He attended parliament regularly throughout the summer of 1660, concerned as he was with his petition, presented on 13 June, for the recovery of his estate. Early the following year he made overtures to Lord Chancellor Hyde (later created earl of Clarendon), who replied soothingly. Charles had also relaxed his hostility, perhaps through the agency of his latest mistress, Buckingham's young cousin Barbara Palmer (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Villiers). As a result, he was admitted as a gentleman of the bedchamber in August 1661, and on 30 October was sworn in as lord lieutenant of the West Riding.<h2>
<a name="Thecourtier16611667"></a>The courtier, 1661&#150;1667</h2>The West Riding lieutenancy had attached to it more deputies than any other county, and therefore promised Buckingham extensive local patronage. Within months he had created a loyal clientele of youngish, politically inexperienced deputies, among whom Sir Thomas Osborne (later earl of Danby) and George Savile (later marquess of Halifax) were to advance farthest. He also lobbied for the presidency of the council of the north, the regional court whose reconstitution after the Restoration was widely predicted. However, the rival candidature of Lord Strafford split opinion both in Whitehall and the north, and Charles seems to have decided that the renewal of the court was not worth the factionalism it created. The duke was readmitted to the privy council on 28 April 1662. He was not, though, appointed to any important conciliar committees and made only a token appearance throughout the first few years of his membership. Nor, at this stage, was he active in the House of Lords, excepting the debates upon the <span class="roman">Uniformity Bill</span> in early 1662, when he opposed Clarendon's proviso allowing the king to dispense with the act in order to exempt individual ministers from observing certain rites. He was studiously ambivalent when, in July 1663, the earl of Bristol attempted to impeach Clarendon. Instead, he entertained the court with impersonations of the ageing lord chancellor, and tried to anticipate a shift in the king's romantic liaisons by sponsoring Frances Stuart as a rival to his cousin (now countess of Castlemaine). Frances, although fascinated by Buckingham's skill in building castles of playing cards, proved too virtuous to oblige his wider plan.<br>
<br>The duke's first real chance to advertise his abilities, and to expunge the republican taint that his return to England in 1657 had created, occurred in autumn 1663, when news reached London of a major republican conspiracy in Yorkshire. The duke journeyed to York, and requested a commission to raise a horse regiment. This was unduly alarmist, since government spies had already infiltrated the claques, but three rabble-like gatherings of dissidents did take place on 12 October, and this appeared to vindicate his caution. He was instructed to oversee the prosecution of the ringleaders, and some twenty men were hanged in Yorkshire early the following year. The Anglo-Dutch War represented another opportunity for him to display his martial prowess. In April 1665 he joined the fleet, but quarrelled with York and Sandwich and was ordered ashore. He felt the humiliation keenly: &#145;I have soe long accustomed to bee ill used, that I may very well begin to thinke that I deserve noe better, and that it is high time for me to leave off the persuing of those things that I have had soe little success in&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 34, fols. 160&#150;61). He retired from political life completely for the next few months, not once attending the autumn 1665 session of parliament.<br>
<br>In 1666 Buckingham fell in love with Anna-Maria Brudenell, countess of Shrewsbury, a society beauty who had already acquired a reputation as a <i>femme fatale</i>. &#145;I would take a wager she might have a man killed for her every day, and she would only hold her head the higher for it&#146; was Count Grammont's observation  (A. Hamilton, <span class="italic">Memoirs of Count Grammont</span>, 2 vols., 1908, 2.3). Their affair was to have tragic consequences, but in the first instance it seems to have reawakened Buckingham's taste for political intrigue. On 5 October, two weeks into the new parliamentary session, he took his seat in the Lords and introduced a &#145;wild motion&#146; that those guilty of embezzling public funds be executed for treason  (Pepys). Thereafter, he attended Westminster with unusual assiduity, was named to all the most important standing committees, and chaired several inter-house conferences. Meanwhile, he courted aggrieved and energetic MPs in the Commons, notably Sir Richard Temple, Sir Edward Seymour, Sir Robert Howard, and William Garway. These men filibustered debates on supply for the king, challenged a ruling made by Clarendon in his legal capacity as lord chancellor, and promoted a bill to ban the import of Irish cattle, passage of which would undermine the government's Irish administration and deprive the king of customs duties. Buckingham was its leading sponsor in the Lords, where tempers flared. On 25 October Lord Ossory, son of the lord lieutenant of Ireland, challenged him to a duel for insulting his countrymen (&#145;whoever was against the bill had either an Irish interest or an Irish understanding&#146;); both were sent briefly to the Tower to cool off (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 35, fols. 109, 111, 115, 117; <span class="italic">JHL</span>, 12.18&#150;20, 22). Charles now lost his patience with Buckingham and ordered the intelligence services to collect incriminating evidence against him. On 25 February 1667 a warrant for the duke's arrest was issued on the grounds that he had both encouraged seamen to mutiny and had commissioned a horoscope of the king's birth&#151;a treasonable offence, since it presupposed the encompassing of the king's death. Buckingham went into hiding, while Whitehall learned that many &#145;thought his crime small, or none at all&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1667</i>, 11). In early summer 1667 the devastating Dutch raid along the Medway damaged the government's standing beyond repair, achieving in a few hours what Buckingham and his allies had laboured over throughout the winter. Confident now that the government would not press charges, he emerged from hiding. He was conveyed to the Tower in June 1667, in what became a triumphal procession&#151;dining as he did at a tavern before a crowd of applauding onlookers. He was released in the following month after a perfunctory interrogation that he treated with contempt. Pepys called his enlargement &#145;one of the strangest instances of the fool's play with which all public things are done in this age&#146;  (Pepys, 8.342). On 23 September Buckingham was restored to the privy council and the bedchamber.<h2>
<a name="Theminister16671674"></a>The minister, 1667&#150;1674</h2>In restoring him to favour Charles was effectively inviting Buckingham to employ his populist talents on the government's behalf. Thus, ten days into the new parliamentary session the duke's allies in the Commons impeached the now dismissed Clarendon. When the issue came before the Lords, Buckingham led the protest (20 November) at the house's decision not to commit the earl upon an unspecified charge of treason. It was rumoured that Charles would break the legal deadlock by proroguing parliament and trying the earl before a court of twenty-four selected peers, presided over by Buckingham. Although it is unlikely that the duke, who had no legal expertise, would have chaired such a court, the threat was sufficiently real for Clarendon to take ship and flee to France.<br>
<br>Buckingham did not himself gain high office from Clarendon's disgrace: he lacked administrative experience and was probably content to operate in a more casual advisory role. His position was, nevertheless, formalized over the next nine months. On 2 November 1667 he was recommissioned as lord lieutenant of the West Riding. More important, on 31 January 1668 he was added to the committee for foreign affairs, an inner cabinet that met weekly on Mondays to debate the most sensitive policy matters. Finally, in the summer he bought from the duke of Albemarle, for the colossal sum of &pound;20,000, the post of master of the horse, a position with sentimental value, since his father had held the post half a century earlier. The duke's security in royal affections is also suggested by his immunity from prosecution and disgrace following his duel, on 16 January 1668, with his cuckold, the earl of Shrewsbury. The status of the combatants, the number who fought (three on each side), and the bloody outcome (one killed, one seriously wounded) combined to make it the most notorious duel of the reign. The affair embarrassed the government on the eve of a fresh parliamentary session. As Pepys sarcastically put it, &#145;This will make the world think that the king hath good councillors about him&#146;  (Pepys, 9.27). But it did not deflect business. Charles pardoned the duellists (27 January), and parliament made no reference to the episode until 18 March, when Shrewsbury, wounded and bedridden, died. Buckingham responded by moving the countess into one of his London residences, Wallingford House.<br>
<br>All the same the duke's efforts to manage parliament in 1668 were strikingly unsuccessful. His attempt to introduce legislation on behalf of protestant nonconformists&#151;his client Sir Richard Temple terming it a policy &#145;by which the presbyterians are absolutely gained and the nation satisfied&#146;  (BL, Stowe MS 304, fol. 88<i>v</i>)&#151;was a serious misreading of the mood at Westminster. In the Lords, senior churchmen spoke against the rumoured bills to such effect that none was presented. The duke absented himself from Westminster for much of the second half of the session, and when he returned, on 21 April, it was to drive on a jurisdictional dispute between the two houses in the hope of wrecking a session that had turned against him. For the next few years he consistently urged Charles to dismiss the assembly. When supply was eventually voted, on 2 May 1668, Charles was bemused to see that it was Clarendon's friends, not Buckingham's, who had forwarded his business most effectively.<br>
<br>Buckingham was excluded from the secret negotiations that led to the secret treaty of Dover (22 May 1670). This committed Charles to war with the Dutch, and to declare himself Roman Catholic, in return for a French subsidy, an undertaking by France not to attack Spain, and a suspension of Louis XIV's shipbuilding programme. In July 1670 Charles sent Buckingham to Versailles to treat with Louis XIV for an &#145;official&#146; alliance. The resulting treaty (21 December) omitted the Catholic clause, and was signed by all the principal cabinet officers: Clifford, Arlington, Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale (whose combined initials provide the resonant but misleading acronym <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93697', "Cabal")</script>). Buckingham rarely attended Westminster during the 1671 session of parliament. His illegitimate child with the countess of Shrewsbury died in infancy, and was buried in the Villiers family vault at Westminster Abbey on 12 March 1671 (which caused an outcry). In the summer he diligently and successfully canvassed to be chancellor of Cambridge University (11 May). His main concern, as ever, was to cover himself in military glory. In January 1672 he pressed for the war with the Dutch to be started with an unprovoked attack on Cadzand. On the outbreak of war he took a small vessel and joined the fleet, but, as in 1665, was swiftly recalled. His commission to lead a regiment of foot (19 June) was some compensation.<br>
<br>There is some evidence that Buckingham was now alerted to the existence of the secret treaty by the duke of York  (W. D. Christie, <span class="italic">A Life of Anthony Ashley Cooper, First Earl of Shaftesbury, 1621&#150;83</span>, 2 vols., 1871, 2.85&#150;6). To placate him Charles attached Buckingham to the embassy to The Hague (June 1672), which achieved the limited goal of ensuring that William of Orange did not detach either ally. The sluggish war effort and the unparliamentary nature of Charles's declaration of indulgence (1672) provoked great unity of opposition within parliament when it reconvened in February 1673. According to Burnet, Buckingham advised Charles to use the military to eject the recalcitrant MPs  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History of my Own Time</span>, pt 2, <span class="italic">The Reign of Charles II</span>, ed. O. Airy, 2 vols., 1897&#150;1900, 2.11). The duke was commissioned lieutenant-general on 13 May 1673, junior only to York and Prince Rupert. However, his association with increasingly unpopular policies undermined his recruitment activities that summer. To distance himself from charges of popery he took the sacrament in &#145;almost all&#146; the West Riding churches  (W. D. Christie, ed., <span class="italic">Letters Addressed to Sir Joseph Williamson &hellip; 1673&#150;4</span>, 2 vols., CS, new ser., 1874, 1.25, 57&#150;8), but was still short of men when the army mustered at Blackheath in July. When a Huguenot count was promoted above him he refused to serve.<br>
<br>Aware now of his exclusion from influence Buckingham turned to mischief-making. In November it was reported that he sought censure in parliament, if only to gain a platform from which to incriminate Arlington: &#145;contented to loose an eye himself to leave his enemie none&#146;  (W. D. Christie, ed., <span class="italic">Letters Addressed to Sir Joseph Williamson &hellip; 1673&#150;4</span>, 2 vols., CS, new ser., 2.62). At the same time he took the precaution of obtaining a royal pardon for all offences committed up to the present (granted 19 November). On the opening day of the new session, 7 January 1674, the young earl of Shrewsbury's family petitioned against the &#145;wicked and scandalous life&#146; led by Buckingham and the countess of Shrewsbury  (<span class="italic">JHL</span>, 12.599). The house ordered him not to converse with or cohabit with the countess on pain of a &pound;10,000 fine. Correctly fearing a Commons address for his removal, which, unlike an impeachment charge, would give him no opportunity to defend himself, the duke requested, and was granted, permission to address the house himself. His cryptic, evasive, and frivolous defence impressed no one, and after two days' debate the Commons duly addressed Charles for the duke's removal from all his employments, and from his presence and councils forever. Charles agreed.<h2>
<a name="Oppositionandretirement16741687"></a>Opposition and retirement, 1674&#150;1687</h2>Even before he had been officially dismissed Buckingham was noted as having joined a cabal of disgruntled peers who met at the presbyterian Lord Holles's house. On 21 April 1675, after a year of retirement, he joined Shaftesbury and twenty-one other peers in protesting that the government's non-resisting bill encroached upon the privileges of the house. The bishops, bloc voters for the bill, were ridiculed by Buckingham in a speech of &#145;eloquent and well placed nonsense&#146;  (A. Marvell, <span class="italic">The Poems and Letters of Andrew Marvell</span>, ed. H. M. Margoliouth, 3rd edn, 2 vols., 1971, 2.341&#150;3). In November 1675 the duke delivered a short speech to the Lords asking leave to introduce a private bill advocating toleration for protestant dissenters. This was both a reply to Charles's request, made at the start of the session, that ways be found to secure the protestant religion, and a declaration of solidarity with government critics. The bill was never presented as Charles prorogued the session on 22 November, but the gesture had been made.<br>
<br>In 1676 the duke divided his time between the new country mansion he was building at Cliveden, near Maidenhead, and the City of London, where he was involved in corporation politics. On 4 October Whitehall received intelligence that Buckingham and the Leveller John Wildman had drunk a health to a new parliament, &#145;and to all the honest men of it who would give the king no money&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1676&#150;7</i>, 352). The king's decision not to call parliament in 1676 determined Buckingham's next move. On the opening day of the next session, 15 February 1677, he delivered a long speech arguing that the prorogation had <i>ipso facto</i> rendered parliament dissolved, since there existed two unrepealed medieval statutes decreeing that a parliament be called at least every twelve months. &#145;Statutes are not like women, for they are not one jot the worse for being old&#146;, he explained to their lordships  (Phipps, 104&#150;12). Despite its wit and ingenuity, the speech was a major tactical blunder. The campaign was never likely to commend itself to the Commons for the simple reason that MPs, unlike peers, would have the expense and uncertainty of re-election. Accordingly, the Commons voted not to debate the issue. In the Lords, Buckingham and his fellow dissolutionists (Shaftesbury, Salisbury, and Wharton) were required to seek the pardon of the house, and, when they refused, were sent to the Tower (16 February). As in 1667, the intelligence service collected evidence of Buckingham's subversion, but the duke's courtier friends, Middlesex, Rochester, and Nell Gwyn, together, surprisingly, with Lord Treasurer Danby  (BL, Add. MS 28051, fol. 41), persuaded Charles to relax the duke's confinement; on 5 August 1677 he obtained a full release.<br>
<br>For the next few years Buckingham was a marginal figure, dependent upon payments from the French government, who thought him a usefully popular figure in London. The Popish Plot allegations of 1678 briefly revived his parliamentary career. On 28 October 1678, shortly after the mysterious death of Sir Edmund Godfrey, the London JP who had taken Titus Oates's depositions, Buckingham suggested a special subcommittee to investigate the supposed murder, and proceeded to nominate government critics such as Shaftesbury, Halifax, and Winchester to sit alongside him on it. The duke was subsequently invited to manage important inter-house conferences upon the security of the realm and the protestant religion. The following year his scope for action was circumscribed by a complicated vendetta with his former client, Danby, and was absent from Westminster for almost the entire session of the new parliament, which met in early March 1679. In August and September he electioneered on behalf of whig candidates in areas where he possessed land and influence, thereby earning a dressing down from the king  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 228, fol. 121). Next, he was accused of sodomy&#151;an increasingly common political charge, as it carried the same penalty as for treason, and therefore allowed the crown to dispose of the defendant's estate should the prosecution succeed. In May 1680 a grand jury brought a verdict of <i>ignoramus</i>, after which Buckingham successfully sued his accusers, who included the spy&#150;adventurer Colonel Blood, for libel.<br>
<br>Ill health prevented Buckingham from attending the much prorogued parliament until 22 November 1680. It is a measure of his diminishing sway that he survived the tory <i>revanche</i> of 1681&#150;5. Only when James II succeeded Charles in 1685 did Buckingham return to public life. He attended almost every day of the new session of parliament, and published a religious tract implicitly advocating toleration for Roman Catholics as well as for protestants. He spent the last two years of his life in retirement on his Yorkshire estates, dying on 16 April 1687 of a chill caught on the hunting field&#151;not, as Pope had it, in &#145;the worst inn's worst room&#146;  (<span class="italic">Moral Essays</span>, epistle 3, 1.299), but in the house of a tenant at Kirkby Moorside. On 7 June he was interred in the Villiers family vault in St George's Chapel, Westminster Abbey.<h2>
<a name="Estatesandfinances"></a>Estates and finances</h2>Legend has it that Buckingham died a bankrupt, having frittered away a splendid inheritance: &#145;In squandring wealth was his peculiar art&#146;  (J. Dryden, <span class="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</span>, line 559, printed in G. de F. Lord and others, <span class="italic">Poems on Affairs of State: Augustan Satirical Verse, 1660&#150;1714</span>, 7 vols., 1963&#150;75, 2.455&#150;93). His inheritance was indeed splendid, comprising as it did major estates in Yorkshire, Buckinghamshire, Rutland, Leicestershire, and Lincolnshire, large properties in Essex and Herefordshire, two London mansions (York House and Chelsea House), and an enormous art collection, the paintings in which were valued by parliament in 1645 at &pound;20,000. The estate was dismantled by parliament in April 1650. Fairfax was the chief beneficiary, gaining York House and most of the Rutland and Yorkshire holdings; the rest of the duke's lands were put up for sale on 16 July 1651. Buckingham's marriage to Mary Fairfax in 1657 had made him joint heir to all the lands granted to Fairfax, and in summer 1660 he regained his inheritance by parliamentary petition.<br>
<br>A survey of his English lands, drawn up in 1668, showed an annual rental of &pound;19,306 18<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. In the 1660s his policy was to sell his outlying, hard to administer properties and mortgage the rest to secure large-scale loans. This allowed him to meet extraordinary expenditure such as the mastership of the horse (&pound;20,000 in 1668), and the building of the Cliveden estate in the 1670s. His principal creditor was the duke of Albemarle, who loaned a massive &pound;40,000 before his death in 1670. By 1671 nearly all Buckingham's estate was under mortgage, some properties three or four times over. In August 1671 he created a freehold trust to administer the estate and retain all profits in return for an annual allowance of &pound;5000, an arrangement which persisted until the death in 1704 of his widow, Mary. Contemporaries assumed that this abdication of responsibility revealed the duke's financial plight, but there is reason to suppose that it was no more than a legal device to protect the estate from escheating to the crown should Buckingham be prosecuted for treason  (Melton, 307&#150;13). Had the duke fathered an heir he might have shown more respect for landed wealth, as opposed to monetary wealth; as it was, he died both without heir and intestate, obliging the trustees to alienate the remainder of his estate.<h2>
<a name="Friendsandassociates"></a>Friends and associates</h2>Buckingham enjoyed the loyalty and affection of a wide and talented circle of friends, thanks largely to his own social and conversational gifts. &#145;He was the finest gentleman of person and wit I think I ever saw&#146;, wrote Sir John Reresby  (<span class="italic">The Memoirs of Sir John Reresby</span>, ed. A. Browning, 1940, 40). The duke's boyhood governor, the earl of Newcastle, was a strong influence, for Buckingham soon came to share Newcastle's enthusiasm for plays, poetry, music, and scientific inquiry. Grammont held that Buckingham had a fine singing voice, while Pepys thought his &#145;musique&#146; the &#145;best in towne&#146;  (Pepys, 9.13). The duke's scientific interests grew out of his belief in empiricism and rational thought. He was a fellow of the Royal Society (1661&#150;85), installed a laboratory in Wallingford House, and even had one fitted in his chambers when he was sent to the Tower in 1677. His efforts to convert flint glass into high quality glass yielded a successful glass making factory at Vauxhall. He also attended an astrological discussion group run by John Digby, and it was at one of these that he met the lawyer-cum-astrologer John Heydon, whose horoscope drafting was to embarrass Buckingham so severely in 1667.<br>
<br>The duke's intellectual household was ornamented by liberal Anglican scholars such as Martin Clifford (author of <span class="italic">A Treatise of Humane Reason</span>, 1672) and Thomas Sprat (propagandist for the Royal Society and later bishop of Rochester). Clifford was a friend from Buckingham's undergraduate days at Cambridge; in the early 1660s he was acting as the duke's accountant, and became a trustee of his estate in 1675. Sprat's career pursued a similar path: he entered the duke's service soon after the Restoration as a chaplain, and like Clifford was a trustee of the duke's estate. He was one of the first men to be told of Buckingham's death in 1687. In drafts of the duke's will that were never formalized Clifford and Sprat were both beneficiaries, as was Sir Charles Wolseley, the former Cromwellian courtier who in 1668 wrote a pamphlet advocating liberty of conscience. In contrast to contemporary rumour Buckingham did not patronize nonconformist ministers to any great extent. His close epistolary friendship, in the last few years of his life, with the Quaker William Penn was altogether different, since Penn, as the confidant of James II, was effectively the patron in the relationship. On the other hand, the duke had a natural affinity for the political <i>demi-monde</i>. In the 1650s he consorted with the Levellers John Lilburne, Edward Sexby, and John Wildman, the Irish Jesuit Peter Talbot, and the Catholic convert Ellis Leighton. The association with Wildman and Leighton endured into the 1680s. Leighton had a gift for diplomatic intrigue and became the duke's agent in the latter's various dealings with the French government, while Wildman combined a flair for radical solutions with a sound business brain. He became a trustee for the duke's estate in 1675, and was almost certainly the duke's point of contact with London radicals such as Slingsby Bethel and Francis Jenks in the late 1670s.<br>
<br>Socially the duke felt most at home with sophisticated but politically unambitious courtier wits such as John Wilmot, earl of Rochester, Charles Sackville, earl of Dorset, Sir George Etherege, and Sir Charles Sedley. Rochester helped secure Buckingham's release from the Tower in 1677, and they spent much of the summer and autumn together. As an undergraduate at Cambridge, Buckingham befriended the poet Abraham Cowley, ten years his senior, and the two were sufficiently close for Cowley to act as best man to Buckingham in 1657. After the Restoration he employed Cowley as a bailiff on his manor at Garrendon, and when Cowley died, in 1667, put up a large sum of money for an elaborate iron and stone memorial. The satirist Samuel Butler, author of <span class="italic">Hudibras</span>, was part of the duke's entourage in France in 1670, and became his secretary when Buckingham returned to Cambridge University as chancellor. The duke was also friendly with Charles de Saint-Evremond, with whom he collaborated in a court play, <span class="italic">Sir Politic Would-Be</span> (1662), and, through Saint-Evremond, with the poet Edmund Waller. Finally, the duke had an acquaintance with the playwright William Wycherley, for in 1672 he made him a lieutenant in the regiment he never got to lead.<h2>
<a name="Writings"></a>Writings</h2>Buckingham's literary reputation was sewn soon after the Restoration and was embroidered by a series of editions and miscellanies published in the hundred years or so after his death. The first, <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Works, Written by his Grace George, Late Duke of Buckingham</span>, edited by T. Brown, appeared in 1704. Subsequent editions by other editors followed in 1705, 1715, 1752, 1754, and 1775. These eighteenth-century collections exploited Buckingham's name to introduce readers to writings by a variety of Restoration wits: most of the items printed were not in fact written by him. He then suffered two hundred years of editorial neglect, until in 1985 Christine Phipps produced an edition of his non-dramatic works.<br>
<br>The duke's principal literary claim to attention is his satire upon contemporary heroic drama, <span class="italic">The Rehearsal</span>, which showed how well his gift for caricature and mimicry translated to both stage and page. The play was several years in the writing, and was apparently a collaborative effort with Martin Clifford, Thomas Sprat, and Samuel Butler. When eventually it was first performed, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on 7 December 1671, it exhibited both literary targets (Dryden) and political (Arlington). <span class="italic">The Rehearsal</span> was immediately popular, being published five times in his own lifetime, and performed nearly three hundred times until 1777, during which its lead role (Bayes) was taken by the greatest actors of the day such as Colley Cibber and David Garrick. The appearance in 1779 of an even better satire, Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Critic</span>, effectively ended its run, but <span class="italic">The Rehearsal</span> retains its importance as the pioneer of a tradition of dramatic burlesque upon the English stage.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Chances</span> was Buckingham's adaptation of John Fletcher's comedy of the same name. This was probably the play that Pepys saw in early 1667. The text was published in 1682, at the time of its next performance. A slightly bowdlerized version was revived by Garrick in 1773, and performed eleven times that season. It was playing as recently as 1962, with Laurence Olivier in the role of Don John. The play's endurance is not surprising, for most critics agree that it far surpasses Fletcher's original. Even Dryden praised Buckingham's comic enrichment of the character of Don John. <span class="italic">The Restoration, or, Right will Take Place</span> was Buckingham's adaptation of Beaumont's and Fletcher's <span class="italic">Philaster</span>, and was aimed at his sometime political ally, Shaftesbury. It is unclear whether or not the play was performed. Buckingham is also credited as being co-author, with Sir Robert Howard, of <span class="italic">The Country Gentleman</span> (1669). In fact, the duke's contribution came after the play was substantially complete, and helped to render it unperformable: he inserted a buffoon of a character, Sir Cautious Trouble-All, who was clearly modelled upon the naval treasurer, Sir William Coventry. Coventry heard of the impertinence and challenged Buckingham to a duel, whereupon he was deprived of his office. The play, which was due to open on 27 February 1669, was halted and its text was not discovered and identified until the 1960s. An edition edited by Scouten and Hume was published in 1976.<br>
<br>Except for the poems written into his commonplace book  (Phipps, 163&#150;227), no holograph manuscripts of Buckingham's poetry survive, and the dozen or so pieces generally ascribed to him  (Phipps, 141&#150;53) are not especially distinguished. The commonplace book also contains squibs, aphorisms, gnomic couplets, lampoons of political opponents such as Clarendon and Dryden, and an unfinished play.<br>
<br>The duke's prose works  (Phipps, 81&#150;137) carried a political purpose, or at least allowed him to turn political resentment to a creative end. <span class="italic">The Battle of Sedgmoor</span>, written in July 1685, was a one-act farce directed against the earl of Feversham, the French-born general of the royalist forces at the battle. Several of the duke's parliamentary speeches were printed (1668, 1674, 1675, and 1677). Of these, his November 1675 speech, requesting leave to introduce a toleration bill, was perhaps the most influential: it was published with a speech of Shaftesbury's in a single pamphlet, sold well in the London coffee houses, and attracted comment in the provinces. <span class="italic">A letter to Sir Thomas Osborn &hellip; upon the reading of a book called &#145;The present interest of England stated&#146;</span> (1672) was written to justify the Anglo-Dutch War. It took the form of a reply to a pamphlet of Slingsby Bethel's published the year before, and argued that since the Dutch were England's greatest commercial rivals, they were also her natural enemies in war. <span class="italic">To Mr Martin Clifford on his Humane Reason</span> (1672) proclaimed Buckingham's faith in &#145;reason, and the interpretation of Scripture&#146;. It could have been an oblique criticism of the declaration of indulgence, promulgated that same year, for in the essay Buckingham explicitly excluded Roman Catholics from his proposed toleration. By contrast, <span class="italic">A Short Discourse upon the Reasonableness of Man's Having a Religion, or Worship of God</span> (1685), implicitly embraces the desirability of toleration for Catholics: there was no mention of &#145;protestants&#146;, only &#145;Christians&#146;. The paper was apparently written at the behest of Buckingham's Quaker friend William Penn, with the specific aim of currying favour with the new king, the Roman Catholic James II. Theologically lightweight, it nevertheless provoked a lively controversy among theologians, to which Buckingham contributed a brief, humorous defence, <span class="italic">The duke of Buckingham's letter to the unknown author of &hellip; A short answer to the duke of Buckingham's paper</span> (1685). The hoped-for return to court was not, however, forthcoming.<br>
<br>Buckingham's career reveals both the possibilities and limitations of friendship with the king. Charles II usually forgave his indiscretions, but from their first falling out, at Worcester in 1651, he never really trusted him. As a result, the duke's political and military ambitions were constantly thwarted. His status as the leading non-royal peer, and his genuine talents for friendship and intrigue, made him a powerful and inspiring patron: his clientele was the most diversely brilliant and loyal of the period, and an apt reflection of his own broadminded intellect. His satirical gifts brought him sporadic popularity at court, in parliament, and on the streets of the capital. They also shaped his best writing. Ultimately, however, the man who had been brought up with two future kings of England expected more. Buckingham died an embittered man.<br>
