<span class="headword">Husain, Sir Mian Fazl-i-</span>  (1877&#150;1936), <span class="occ">politician in India</span>, was born on 14 June 1877 in Peshawar, North-West Frontier Province, India, where his father, Mian Husain Imam Bakhsh, was posted as &#145;extra assistant commissioner&#146;. He came from a family of Bhatti Rajputs from Batala, in the Gurdaspur district of the Punjab. He started his education at the municipal board school in Abbottabad, North-West Frontier Province, where his father had been transferred. He was a very ordinary student, his delicate health hampering his studies. After matriculating from the Government High School, Gurdaspur, Punjab, he went to Government College, Lahore, where he impressed as a student of more than average merit, philosophy being his favourite subject. He graduated BA from the University of the Punjab in 1898. He then went to England, to Christ's College, Cambridge, where he took the Oriental languages tripos. He was called to the bar by Gray's Inn in 1901. He also tried his luck at entering the Indian Civil Service, but was unsuccessful. <br>
<br>On his return to India Fazl-i-Husain practised law for four years in Sialkot, where he became involved in educational activities. He organized an Anjuman-i-Islam (Muslim Association), with the intention of running a small school for local Muslims. He placed the local <i>idgah</i> (or open-air prayer area) on a proper financial footing with the support of local Muslims. While in Sialkot he also became an active member of Anjuman-i-Himayat-i-Islam, a Muslim educational organization. He moved to Lahore in 1905, and started legal practice at the chief court. For two years he divided his time between his profession and educational work as honorary principal of the Islamia College and subsequently as secretary of the college committee of the Anjuman-i-Himayat-i-Islam. He was nominated a fellow of the University of the Punjab in 1908 and elected secretary of the Oriental faculty in 1913 and of the law faculty in 1915. In the same year he was elected president of the bar association, succeeding Mian Muhammad Shafi. <br>
<br>Under the inspiration of the swadeshi (or economic self-sufficiency) movement, Fazl-i-Husain entered politics. He at first identified with the Indian National Congress, but as it had no substantial presence in the Punjab he was more active among the ranks of the Muslim League, in which he represented the pro-Congress faction. Initially he was more preoccupied with his legal and educational activities, but from 1915, when he was elected to the Punjab legislative council to represent the Punjab University constituency, &#145;politics claimed Mian Fazl-i-Husain more and more&#146;  (Nur Ahmad, 12). He secured victory by a narrow margin largely because the Muslim votes were cast solidly in his favour. Thereafter he became a staunch believer in separate electorates, so that minorities in the multi-communal polity could have representation in the legislature. He also advocated the allocation of jobs in the government service by communal group, in the belief that an increased share for Muslims would help develop common national political ideals. That realization culminated in the &#145;national pact&#146; in 1916 between Congress and the Muslim League at Lucknow, which endorsed the idea of separate, communal electorates; Fazl-i-Husain was one of its authors. Nevertheless his subsequent political career in the Punjab depended on a degree of inter-communal collaboration unmatched in any other province of British India, and he was never an advocate of a separate Muslim state. <br>
<br>Fazl-i-Husain parted ways with Congress when the non-co-operation movement swept India immediately after the First World War. The passage of the <span class="roman">Rowlatt Act</span>, authorizing the government to imprison people without trial, had galvanized the normally politically lethargic Punjab into activity. That popular upsurge, in his view, had taken an unconstitutional twist. His criticism of the non-co-operation movement turned his former comrades and followers against him. In defiance of Congress's boycott of the Montagu&#150;Chelmsford constitutional reforms of 1919 he contested the Punjab election in 1920 and not only entered the Punjab legislature but also assumed office as government minister in charge of the transferred departments of education, health, and local government, on 3 January 1921. Thereafter his political vision came to encompass not so much the politically conscious urban Punjabis as rural Punjabis. His former colleagues from Congress accused him of having changed from a leader of political intellectuals into an ally of the <i>zamindars</i>, or landowners, especially after, with the help of the rural representatives in the legislative council, he formally organized a parliamentary party in 1923, the Unionist Party. Though this party drew the bulk of its support from Muslims it sought to represent the interests of Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh landowners and farmers on an inter-communal basis, and largely prevented the Muslim League from dominating Muslim politics in the province until after the Second World War. He secured recognition for the principle of party government in relation to those departments transferred in 1919 to the control of elected parliamentarians, and he, Lal Chand, and later on Chaudhury Chhotu Ram (a Hindu), held ministries as members of the Unionist Party. <br>
<br>As a minister Fazl-i-Husain placed an emphasis on rural development that had virtually no precedent. A network of primary and secondary schools was spread out in the rural areas; a programme of opening up colleges in rural towns was instituted; the training of teachers was attended to; and primary education was made free throughout the Punjab. Fazl-i-Husain made it possible for &#145;untouchables&#146; to climb the social ladder by issuing a circular exhorting schools whether public or private not to refuse admission to them. In the sphere of medicine, relief against epidemics and particularly malaria was extended to the countryside through the public health department. The annual expenditure on the public health department specializing in rural work more than doubled between 1921 and 1926. <br>
<br>In 1926 Fazl-i-Husain accepted the portfolio of revenue in the &#145;reserved&#146; part of the government, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to contest the next elections. His appointment was ostensibly a promotion but his influence over the &#145;transferred&#146; departments was substantially curtailed. At the end of his four-year tenure in 1930 he was appointed a member of the viceroy's executive council in Delhi for a five-year term. During these years far-reaching constitutional developments&#151;the Round Table conferences of 1930&#150;32, the grant of full political status to the North-West Frontier Province, the communal award of 1932 (granting separate electorates to minority communities), the separation of Sind from Bombay, and the <span class="roman">Government of India Act</span> of 1935&#151;took place. Fazl-i-Husain's role with respect to the constitution of the Muslim delegation to the Round Table conferences was particularly important, the Aga Khan, Choudhri Zafrullah Khan, and Sir Shafaat Ahmad Khan being chosen as part of the Muslim delegation largely at his behest. A champion of minority rights, he pulled strings very effectively by means of regular correspondence from Delhi to ensure that the Muslim delegates to the Round Table conferences stood firm on communal electorates, and emphasized the need for provincial autonomy under any new constitutional arrangements. Having been knighted in 1925, he was appointed KCIE in 1929 and KCSI in 1932. In 1935, when his term as a member of the viceroy's executive council came to an end, he returned to the Punjab, setting himself the task of reorganizing the Unionist Party at an all-India level. However, his failing health did not spare him enough time to realize that ambition. He died in Lahore on 9 July 1936. He was married, with two sons and four daughters. He was predeceased by his elder son, Naim (1908&#150;1931), a student at Cambridge. His younger son, Azim Husain (1913&#150;2007), became a prominent Indian civil servant and diplomat.<br>
