<span class="headword">Adshead,  (Sylvia) Mary</span>  (1904&#150;1995), <span class="occ">mural painter and designer</span>, was born on 15 February 1904 at 46 Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, London, the only child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30344/', "Stanley Davenport Adshead (1868&#150;1946)")</script>, architect and academic, and Mary Annie (1874&#150;1960), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Blackie, teacher and housewife, who both had considerable influence on her career and early success. A delicate child, she was educated initially at home by her mother. From 1910 until 1913 the family spent part of each year in Liverpool, where her father was professor of town planning. In 1914 they moved to Mortlake and she attended Putney high school from 1916 to 1919, after which she spent six months at a Paris <i>lyc&eacute;e</i>. Her father's position as a professor at London University enabled her to receive a concessionary place at the Slade School of Fine Art at the early age of sixteen; there she caught the final years of Henry Tonks's famously misogynist regime. Unusually, he took a particular interest in her work, allowing her to pursue what he called her &#145;tapestry style&#146;, a witty blend of sophistication and na&iuml;vety, and turn her back on the strict academic approach, then <i>de rigueur</i> in art schools. Her ability to marshal elegant designs on a grand scale made her a natural mural painter. In 1924 Tonks was responsible for arranging her first mural commission, <span class="italic">The Joys of the Country</span>, in collaboration with a fellow student, Rex Whistler, for the memorial hall of the Highways Boys' Club in Shadwell. It attracted the attention of architects and led to many further commissions for her, including a large mural, <span class="italic">The Housing of the People</span>, at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924 at Wembley and a mural on desert island life for the dining-room of Charles Reilly, professor of architecture at Liverpool University, which was exhibited at the Royal Institute of British Architects when she was just twenty-two. (It is now owned by Liverpool University Art Gallery.) <br>
<br>Occasionally commissions for the cultivated rich went awry. In 1928 Mary Adshead executed a series of panels for Lord Beaverbrook's dining-room at Newmarket evoking the spirit of the town's fair and horse races and peopling them with likenesses of his friends. The project foundered when Lady Diana Cooper, a fashionable beauty depicted in one of the panels, persuaded him that, given his quarrelsome nature, it was unwise to immortalize a group of people with whom he was bound to fall out. Beaverbrook returned the panels with a two-thirds rejection fee. (The work was reassembled for exhibition at Peter Jones department store in 1930 before being rolled up and stored. Later all but three panels were destroyed by fire.) <br>
<br>On 30 April 1929 Mary married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31958/', "Stephen Bone (1904&#150;1958)")</script>, son of the artist Sir Muirhead Bone, and in that year she moved from her parents' house at 2 Chester Gate to 9 Knightsbridge, London. Although they had been students together at the Slade, they hardly knew each other until later. Both unusually tall, they made a striking couple. In the early years of their marriage they made tours through Europe, sketching and painting. In 1930 she had her first solo exhibition at the Goupil Gallery and was elected to the New English Art Club. Commissions for murals and designs flowed in, but the birth of the first of their three children, Quentin, in 1931 inevitably brought distractions. In that year they moved to 43 Haverstock Hill, Hampstead. She was an immensely practical woman and a stalwart in the marriage. In 1933 another son, Sylvester, was born, and in 1937 a daughter, Christina. Also in 1937 she exhibited at the Redfern Gallery, London, and they moved up the hill to no. 140. At the outbreak of war she moved the family to The Barn, Downton, Hampshire, and in 1940 to 26 Portland Place, Leamington Spa, where Stephen was in the camouflage organization. After the war they moved back to 140 Haverstock Hill, where she lived for the rest of her life. She worked on three illustrated children's books with Stephen (1936, 1942, and 1953) and illustrated <span class="italic">Bonfires and Broomsticks</span> by Mary Norton in 1948; from 1949 she also designed stamps. However, her career was underpinned by a constant flow of mural commissions. In 1953 she became the secretary of the Society of Mural Painters. <br>
<br>Stephen's tragic premature death from cancer in 1958 in some ways released a new wave of energy in Mary. She travelled in the United States and Europe and studied mosaic decoration in Ravenna and Sicily. Though she had three further solo exhibitions in 1971, 1979, and 1986 (a retrospective at Sally Hunter Fine Art, London), she also exhibited with Stephen's work in 1974, 1980, and 1989. Lameness caused by painting off ladders hampered her work and life in later years but she remained purposefully active to the end. She died at home of heart failure on 3 September 1995 and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 11 September.<br>
