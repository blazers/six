<span class="headword">Keon,  Miles Gerald</span>  (1821&#150;1875), <span class="occ">novelist and colonial official</span>, the last male descendant of an old Irish family, was born on 20 February 1821 at Keonbrooke, Leitrim. He was the only son of Myles Gerald Keon (<i>d</i>. 1824), a barrister, and Mary Jane (1787&#150;1825), his second wife, who was a daughter of Patrick, Count Magawly, a title bestowed by the kingdom of Sicily. Following the death of his parents, Keon and his younger sister, Ellen Benedicta, were brought up by their maternal grandmother, Countess Magawly, and, after her death, by their uncle, Francis Philip, third Count Magawly, sometime prime minister of Marie Louise in the duchies of Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla.<br>
<br>Keon was educated at the Jesuit Stonyhurst College, which he entered in March 1832. He won many prizes there. He left Stonyhurst in 1839, and after spending some time in France, he crossed to Algeria where he served briefly in the French army. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1840, but was never called to the bar. On 21 November 1846 he married Anne de la Pierre Hawkes. They had no children.<br>
<br>For the next twenty years Keon earned his living as a journalist, contributing to <span class="italic">The Tablet</span> and Colburn's <span class="italic">United Service Magazine</span>. In 1846 he became editor of <span class="italic">Dolman's Magazine</span>, and subsequently worked for the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> for twelve years. He reported the coronation of Alexander II in St Petersburg in 1856, where he met Boucher de Perthes, who wrote about Keon in <span class="italic">Voyage en Russie</span> (1859). Keon also wrote a number of popular novels. The most successful was <span class="italic">Dion and the Sibyls: a Romance of the First Century</span> (1866).<br>
<br>After an unsuccessful short visit to India as editor of <span class="italic">Bengal Hurkaru</span>, Lord Lytton appointed Keon secretary to the government of Bermuda in March 1859. He served there for the rest of his life. He died on 5 June 1875 at Flatts Village, Hamilton, Bermuda, and was buried at St Edward's Church on the island.<br>
