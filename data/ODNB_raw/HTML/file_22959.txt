<span class="headword">Quin,  Edwin Richard Windham  Wyndham-</span>, third earl of Dunraven and Mount Earl  (1812&#150;1871), <span class="occ">landowner and archaeologist</span>, was born on 19 May 1812 in London. He was the only son of Windham Henry Wyndham-Quin, second earl of Dunraven and Mount Earl (1782&#150;1850), and his wife, Caroline, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wyndham (1790/91&#150;1870). Their son, known from 1824 as Viscount Adare, graduated BA at Trinity College, Dublin, in the spring of 1833, and represented Glamorgan in parliament as a Conservative from 1837 to 1851. As a member of the House of Commons, his political activity was largely taken up with the attempt to safeguard religious education in Ireland. He became subsequently one of the commissioners of education in Ireland. He was twice married. First, on 18 August 1836, he married Augusta (<i>d</i>. 1866), the third daughter of Thomas Goold, master in chancery in Ireland. They had a son and three daughters. He married secondly, on 27 January 1870, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1917), daughter of Henry Lambert of Carnagh, Wexford, who, after his death, married the second Lord Hylton.<br>
<br>Adare succeeded his father as third earl in the Irish peerage in 1850, and retired from the House of Commons in the following year. In 1855 he converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1866 he was created a peer of the United Kingdom, with the title Baron Kenry, of Kenry, co. Limerick. He acted as lord lieutenant of county Limerick from 1864 until his death in 1871.<br>
<br>Dunraven had a number of intellectual interests. For three years he studied astronomy under Sir William Hamilton at the Dublin observatory, and acquired a thorough knowledge both of the practical and theoretical sides of the science. He became interested in the claims of spiritualism and was convinced of the genuineness of the phenomena which he investigated. His son, the fourth earl, prepared for him minute reports of s&eacute;ances which the fashionable medium Daniel Dunglas Home had conducted with Dunraven's help in 1867&#150;8. The reports were privately printed in 1869 as <span class="italic">Experiences in Spiritualism with Mr. D. D. Home</span>, to which Dunraven contributed an introduction. But he was best-known for his zealous interest in archaeology. He was associated with George Petrie, William Stokes, and other Irish archaeologists in the foundation of the Irish Archaeological Society in 1840, and of the Celtic Society in 1845. In 1849 and 1869 he presided over the meetings of the Cambrian Society held at Cardiff and Bridgend, and in 1871 was president of a section of the Royal Archaeological Institute. In 1862 he accompanied the French liberal Catholic Montalembert on a tour of Scotland, and five years later he travelled through France and Italy in order to study churches, and particularly campaniles. But his main interest was in Irish archaeology. He was said to have visited every barony in Ireland, and nearly every island off the coast, usually in the company of a photographer. Dr William Stokes and his daughter Margaret McNair Stokes frequently accompanied him on his archaeological expeditions.<br>
<br>The chief results of Dunraven's studies, which were meant to continue the work of his friend Petrie, were assembled in <span class="italic">Notes on Irish Architecture</span>, edited and published in two volumes after his death by Margaret Stokes. The work was illustrated with 161 wood-engravings of drawings by Petrie, W. F. Wakeman, Gordon Hills, Margaret Stokes, Lord Dunraven, and others, as well as with 125 plates. The first volume (1875) dealt with stone buildings and the second (1877) with belfries and with Irish Romanesque architecture.<br>
<br>In 1865 Dunraven compiled, as an appendix to his mother's <span class="italic">Memorials of Adare</span>, an exhaustive treatise on architectural remains to be found in the immediate vicinity of Adare. The section of this work which discussed the round tower and church of Dysart was reprinted in the second volume of the <span class="italic">Notes</span>. Dunraven also contributed generously to the restoration of these buildings for the use of religious services. He also contributed some valuable papers to the Royal Irish Academy. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Archaeological Society in 1831, FSA in 1836, FRGS in 1837, and on 10 April 1834 became FRS. Dunraven died at the Imperial Hotel, Great Malvern, Worcestershire, on 6 October 1871, and was buried at Adare. He was a man of quick perceptions and great power of application, an ardent Roman Catholic and admirer of Montalembert, and a highly popular landlord. His son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35644/', "Windham Thomas Wyndham-Quin")</script>, the fourth earl, was an active Irish politician and yachtsman.<br>
