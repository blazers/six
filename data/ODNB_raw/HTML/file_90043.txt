<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jackson,  Thomas <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1925&#150;2003), <span class="occ">trade unionist</span>, was born on 9 April 1925 at 7 Dow Street, Hunslet, Leeds, the only son of George Frederick Jackson, a one-shop master baker, and his wife, Ethel, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hargreaves. His father died when he was four. In October 1939, aged fourteen, he left Jack Lane elementary school to become an office boy in an engineering company and, within weeks, a Post Office messenger and member of the Union of Post Office Workers (UPW) Leeds no. 1 branch. In 1943, by then a postman, he joined the Royal Navy as a wireless operator. Seeing the poverty in the Far East confirmed his belief that only socialism could give people a better future. After returning to Leeds and his postman's job in 1946 he had a brief flirtation with the Communist Party before deciding that his ideals would be better served through his union and the Labour Party. He studied economics as an extramural evening class student at Leeds University, and on 29 November 1947 married Norma Burrow, a Leeds GPO telephonist he had met at a local dance. She was the daughter of Arthur Shaw Burrow, brickworks manager. They had one daughter, Kim (<i>b</i>. 1949).<br>
<br>Jackson's thirty-six years of unbroken office-holding service to the UPW started in 1946 on the Leeds no. 1 branch committee, on which he served until elected to the UPW national executive in 1955. He was the union's national chairman in 1962&#150;3 and became a full-time UPW official in 1964. In 1967 he was voted UPW general secretary on the first ballot with a majority over all other candidates. He held that post for over fifteen years, becoming the UPW's longest-serving general secretary since the union's founder, William Bowen.<br>
<br>During his leadership of the UPW Jackson was alternately described as a militant when battling to increase the postman's basic weekly wage, and as a moderate when advocating working with the government to control wages and prices inflation. With his handlebar moustache&#151;grown to make him look older than his twenty-one years when he first stood for union office&#151;he was unquestionably the most instantly recognizable trade union leader of his generation. Almost uniquely he was able to combine a populist flair with passionate conviction, illustrated by putting the union's Humber Hawk car in a raffle because he did not drive, and being the only union leader to take resolute action during a Trades Union Congress (TUC) protest week in 1977 against apartheid, by cutting all telephone and postal links between the UK and South Africa.<br>
<br>Jackson was first elected to the influential general council of the TUC in 1967. He looked to his fellow union leaders for financial and not merely moral support, when in 1971 the UPW (which had no strike fund) called the first ever postal workers' national strike, claiming a 15 per cent pay increase to produce at least &pound;3 a week more for postmen. It based its claim on settlements in other industries and the 13.2 per cent rise in the general wages index. The Post Office management offered the UPW 7 per cent, then 8 per cent, asking the union to put the difference to arbitration. The UPW rejected this, but the reluctance of its telephonist members to join the strike undoubtedly weakened its ability to force a better offer. During the course of the forty-seven-day strike (then the longest national stoppage since the general strike in 1926) the union sold its investments, used up reserves of &pound;500,000, and borrowed some &pound;750,000 to give those not entitled to state benefits a hardship payment. Other unions made loans, but gave little direct financial support, and took no other supporting action. To cries of &#145;Hey, hey Tommy J, what about our &pound;3 pay&#146;, Jackson faced his striking members at a Hyde Park meeting in London, urging them to return to work without a firm promise of a better deal. The dispute was referred to a committee of inquiry chaired by a retired civil servant, Sir Henry Hardman, who awarded a 9 per cent increase. The settlement gave Edward Heath's Conservative government its biggest single victory over trade union militancy.<br>
<br>Having lost this pay battle, Jackson became more convinced that the way forward for trade unions was not through a free-for-all wages scramble, but through agreement with a future Labour government on an incomes policy that would protect the lowest paid, control prices and dividends, protect the pound, and help keep that government in power. With the election of a Labour government in 1974, albeit with a majority of three, Jackson's influence on economic policy rose with his battle scars and seniority. It was therefore ironic that it was his casting vote at a fateful special meeting of the TUC general council on 14 November 1978 which finally ended the joint union&#150;government agreement to curb wage increases and inflation, which had begun in 1976. The TUC and ministers had drawn up an agreement headed &#145;collective bargaining, costs and prices&#146; which was endorsed by the powerful TUC economic committee on the morning of the general council meeting, having received cabinet approval the previous day. When it came to the vote the union leaders split 14&#150;14, Jackson (who was in the chair) declared the motion not carried, and so the unions returned to free collective bargaining. Some ministers thought that Jackson could have saved the day by using his vote in favour of the joint statement. Jackson, however, argued that a policy statement as important as this adopted on his casting vote would carry no political conviction at home or with the financial markets abroad. In any case, his union's long-standing practice in similar situations was to rule the motion &#145;not carried&#146;. The rift paved the way for the &#145;winter of discontent&#146; with its wave of strikes, which led inexorably to Margaret Thatcher's election victory in 1979. In his presidential address opening the 1979 Trades Union Congress, a disappointed and embittered Jackson reminded delegates that &#145;It is of no value simply to be in favour of a Labour Government in power if we do not have the will to sustain, influence and share the responsibilities of such a government&#146;  (<span class="italic">Report of 11th Annual Trades Union Congress</span>, 1979, 409).<br>
<br>In a period when trade unions and industry made daily headlines, Jackson was able to speak intelligently and eloquently in conveying ideas and policies to a wider audience&#151;a trait which, combined with his affable personality, saw him in constant media demand. This in turn placed him high on the establishment's list when seeking trade union representation on outside bodies. He was a governor of the BBC (1968&#150;73); a council member of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (1974&#150;85); a government-appointed director of BP (1975&#150;83); a member of the Press Council (1973&#150;6); a member of the Annan committee on the future of broadcasting (1974&#150;7); a member of the court and council of Sussex University (1974&#150;8); and a member of the Commission for Racial Equality (1977&#150;8).<br>
<br>At the end of 1979, Jackson lost the sight of an eye. He decided to take early retirement in 1982, having correctly forecast that the division of the Post Office into two separate corporations&#151;posts and telecommunications&#151;would lead to privatization of the latter and withdrawal of the Royal Mail's monopoly of postal delivery. Also in 1982 his first marriage was dissolved, and on 26 August he married the 35-year-old Kathleen Maria (Kate) Tognarelli, schoolteacher, and daughter of Alfred Francis Tognarelli, confectioner. They moved to Ilkley, in Yorkshire, had a daughter, Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1983), and set up a small antiquarian bookselling business specializing in cookery and children's books. Jackson was himself a skilled cook, once remarking that there was &#145;nothing like a sharp kitchen knife and a pile of fresh vegetables for working off a bit of spleen&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>). Having refused honours from Harold Wilson, and the offer of a peerage in James Callaghan's resignation list, Jackson virtually turned his back on national public life, although he did serve as a member of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission (1982&#150;7) and took on local appointments, including as chairman of the Ilkley Literature Festival (1984&#150;7); council member of Bradford University (1987&#150;90); and a member of Yorkshire Water Authority (1983&#150;9) and non-executive director of Yorkshire Water plc (1989&#150;94). In his last years he suffered from cancer of the prostate. He died at Troutbeck Nursing Home, Crossbeck Road, Ilkley, on 6 June 2003 following a stroke, and was survived by the wives and daughters of his marriages.<br>
