<span class="headword">Venn,  Henry</span>  (1796&#150;1873), <span class="occ">missionary society administrator</span>, was born at Clapham, Surrey, on 10 February 1796, the fifth of eight children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28188/', "John Venn (1759&#150;1813)")</script>, rector of Clapham and a founder of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28184/', "Venn, Henry")</script>], and his first wife, Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1803), daughter of William King, a merchant. He had one surviving brother, John, and five sisters, one of whom, Jane Catherine, married Sir James Stephen. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28184/', "Henry Venn (1725&#150;1797)")</script>. He was brought up in the milieu of evangelical philanthropy and strong family interaction which characterized the leading evangelical Anglicans of the &#145;Clapham Sect&#146;. He was taught by his father and, for a year, by Professor Farish of Cambridge, prior to entering Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1814. He graduated in 1818 as nineteenth wrangler. In 1819 he was elected fellow, and he was ordained deacon and priest in the following year. After a curacy in St Dunstan-in-the-West, London (1821&#150;4), he returned to Queens' College and taught as a tutor; he also served as university proctor. He then became incumbent of Drypool, Hull (1827&#150;34), and of St John's Holloway, Islington, London (1834&#150;46). While at Drypool, on 21 January 1829 he married Martha Sykes (<i>d</i>. 1840), daughter of Nicholas Sykes of Swanland, a wealthy Hull businessman. They had two sons (<script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36639/', "John Venn")</script> and Henry) and one daughter (Henrietta).<br>
<br>In 1841 Venn became honorary clerical secretary (part-time) of the CMS. He remained in this position until 1872 and became full-time secretary in 1846. In this central position in the leading evangelical Anglican missionary society, Venn's past experience and personal gifts blended in a remarkable way: he had had a missionary interest since his childhood; he had a good, analytical mind; he mixed easily with men of affairs; and he was a shrewd judge of people. Moreover, he was an excellent committee man, always master of his brief but prepared to compromise; and he was an excellent organizer and an assiduous correspondent. Above all he was a pragmatic thinker who sought to establish how best the gospel could be preached, and&#151;an increasing preoccupation&#151;how a native church could be established.<br>
<br>The CMS in 1841 was at a low ebb. Financially it faced a severe crisis. Its voluntary and evangelical character meant that it had been regarded with some suspicion by the ecclesiastical establishment. Venn, as a member of its committee, had already been a principal figure in establishing and justifying an accommodation with the Church of England hierarchy, which formally recognized bishops' rights in relation to the licensing of missionaries and thus paved the way for episcopal recognition of the CMS. As secretary, while retaining a vigorous commitment to voluntary missionary societies, Venn succeeded in moving the CMS to a position of greater acceptability within the Church of England, so that by 1870 virtually all the episcopal bench were vice-presidents of the society. The CMS finances, recruitment, and morale also improved. Venn's greatest contribution, however, was in mission strategy.<br>
<br>The CMS supported the extension of the episcopate in New Zealand in 1841, but Venn was extremely frustrated by Bishop Selwyn's reluctance to ordain Maori on the grounds that they were insufficiently educated. Bishop Samuel Wilberforce and others pressed strongly for an increase in the episcopate overseas. Venn resisted the appointment of English &#145;missionary bishops&#146; as a general principle because he feared that, in a context where the laity was not strong, an autocratic, authoritarian episcopal style would rapidly develop, making it impossible to appoint a &#145;native&#146; bishop. This debate prompted him to think deeply about the shape of the church in newly missionized countries and it is with this thinking that he is most associated.<br>
<br>Together with his American collaborator Rufus Anderson (1796&#150;1880), Venn began to identify the &#145;three selfs&#146; principle  (Shenk, <span class="italic">Henry Venn</span>, 31): that churches should be self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating&#151;the true objective for the emerging churches. The originality of the principle can be exaggerated. Great missionaries such as the Serampore trio (William Carey, Joshua Marshman, and William Ward) and Alexander Duff had given considerable thought to the issues involved. The philanthropic, abolitionist context was one, moreover, where radical policies which had a high confidence in indigenous capacity were readily accepted. Where Venn and Anderson were ahead of their contemporaries was in their capacity to enunciate their thinking with a power and logical clarity that nobody else could match.<br>
<br>So far as England was concerned, Venn's grasp of missionary issues was unrivalled. He kept in close touch with missionaries, ecclesiastical leaders, politicians, and statesmen. He assiduously sought to establish what missionary principles the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, church history, and contemporary experience provided. By 1851, however, he was speaking of the need for missionaries to work themselves out of a job&#151;&#145;the euthanasia of a mission&#146;  (Williams, 4&#150;5), and the central importance of indigenous (rather than missionary) pastors who should be close to the culture of their congregations. In the 1860s he became convinced that the dependence system of converts relying on the missionary was the great enemy to be resisted. He advocated structures which would facilitate the emergence of pastoral, governmental, and financial independence, and he stressed the importance of native churches reflecting their own cultures, both institutionally and liturgically. He also expected that these churches would become ecumenical and break from the denominational divisions of the missionary churches.<br>
<br>Venn was the architect of the elevation of his great friend Samuel Crowther (<i>c</i>.1806&#150;1891), a former slave, to the episcopate in west Africa in 1864. He was disappointed that the missionaries effectively put themselves outside Crowther's episcopal control and came to the conclusion that &#145;the European element in a native church&#146; was &#145;the great snare and hindrance to its growth&#146;  (Williams, 34). Missionaries, he argued, constantly underestimated the capacity of their converts. Consequently the only way forward was a significant measure of separation of the indigenous church from the church of soldiers, settlers, and missionaries. In his conviction that the emerging native church might have a large degree of independence and its own episcopate alongside the existing structures of the Church of England in the same area, he was moving to a more radical and controversial position than many contemporary Anglicans were prepared to countenance.<br>
<br>Although he was not an accomplished speaker and though he did not write systematically and for a wide general public, Venn had an authority within the CMS and, in lesser measure, within the Church of England, which made him an immensely influential missionary statesman both in his own day and subsequently. His papers, though mainly for internal CMS use, were brought together in his <span class="italic">Memoir</span> (1880) and ensured that his influence was perpetuated. It is indicative of his catholicity that the one major book Venn wrote was a study of the sixteenth-century Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier. It was not a success: few Victorian evangelicals wanted to read about counter-Reformation heroes.<br>
<br>Venn nevertheless brought ecclesiological issues to the centre of the agenda. He took other cultures seriously and he was confident that indigenous figures could lead in commerce and politics, as well as in church life. He constantly opposed missionary paternalism. He was consequently (and remains) much admired and revered by those indigenous Christians who shared his vision of self-government. Indeed, distinguished twentieth-century Nigerian historians regarded him as the ideological originator of Nigerian nationalism. Many significant later missiologists (G. Warneck and R. Allen for example) owed much to him. He served, as a recognized and respected evangelical Anglican leader, on two royal commissions&#151;one on clerical subscription, in 1864, and the other on ritualism, in 1867.<br>
<br>Venn has been much criticized&#151;for driving too sharp a wedge between church and mission; for moving too quickly to independence in areas such as Sierra Leone; for making self-support too central a condition for self-government; for being too &#145;church-centric&#146; in his analysis; for being insufficiently sympathetic to the problems of the missionaries; and for not travelling outside Europe. It is not possible, however, to gainsay his immense impact. In his private life, Venn had sufficient wealth to live in moderate comfort. During his time with the CMS he lived first in north London, at Highgate and then in Highbury (1848&#150;60), and he finally moved to East Sheen, Mortlake, Surrey, where he died, following a stroke, on 13 January 1873. He was buried in Mortlake cemetery.<br>
