<span class="headword">Ingram,  Vernon Martin</span>  (1924&#150;2006), <span class="occ">molecular biologist</span>, was born Werner Adolf Martin Immerwahr on 19 May 1924 in Breslau, Germany, the younger son and youngest of three children of Kurt Immerwahr, timber merchant, and his wife, Johanna, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Freund. He had a brother, Heinrich (later Henry), and a sister, Hilde (later Hilda), who were respectively eight and four years older than him. The children were brought up as Christians, although their parents were of Jewish descent.<br>
<br>&#145;I knew from the age of 10 that I was interested in science, in how things work&#146;, Ingram later said  (Davis, 14323). He constructed his own radio receiver in order to listen to foreign broadcasts, despite this being banned in Nazi Germany. In 1939 he, his sister, and his parents fled Germany for Britain; his brother, Heinrich, who was studying in Italy, left separately for the United States, via Greece. On the outbreak of the Second World War Kurt Immerwahr was briefly interned as an enemy alien before being released. Vernon escaped this fate, and from 1941 to 1945 worked for Thomas Morson and Son Ltd, a pharmaceutical company based in north London, manufacturing drugs such as amphetamines for the war effort. At the same time he studied chemistry, mathematics, and zoology part-time at Birkbeck College, University of London, where he was particularly impressed by the animal physiologist Graham Jackson, whose teaching &#145;made the dinosaur walk in front of your eyes&#146;  (ibid.). He graduated BSc in 1945, and was immediately offered a post as demonstrator in chemistry, and an assistant lectureship in 1947. In 1949 he completed a PhD in physical organic chemistry under Fred Barrow. At Birkbeck he was also influenced by Desmond Bernal, the professor of physics there. In 1950 Ingram married Margaret Young, with whom he had a son, Peter, and a daughter, Jennifer.<br>
<br>In 1950&#150;52 Ingram spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow in the United States, the first as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow at the Rockefeller Institute, New York, studying protein preparation with Moses Kunitz, and the second as a Coxe fellow at Yale, working on peptide chemistry with Joseph Fruton. Looking for a post in England, he heard from Freddie Gutfreund, a newly arrived postdoctoral student from England, about a vacancy for a protein biochemist at Max Perutz's Medical Research Council Unit for the Study of the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems at Cambridge; he applied for the post and was duly appointed.<br>
<br>In Cambridge it did not take long for Ingram to produce a derivative of haemoglobin with two atoms of mercury attached (one in each half-molecule), the isomorphous replacement needed to solve the phase problem and therefore the protein's crystal structure. At Perutz's suggestion he then set about comparing the molecular structure of normal haemoglobin and sickle-cell haemoglobin. Perutz had already identified the peculiar one-dimensional, crystal structure of sickle-cell haemoglobin (which deforms red blood cells, thereby causing sickle-cell disease, which can be fatal). The haemoglobin in sickle-cell disease had previously been investigated in the laboratory of Linus Pauling at the California Institute of Technology, where Harvey Itano and S. Jonathan Singer, two postdoctoral fellows, had shown that sickle-cell haemoglobin differs in electrophoretic mobility from normal haemoglobin. Building on methods for separating peptides developed by Fred Sanger in Cambridge in his studies of the amino acid sequence of insulin, Ingram employed a two-dimensional method to separate the peptides derived from haemoglobin: a combination of chromatography and electrophoresis, a technique he called &#145;fingerprinting&#146;. As a result he was able to show that in each half-molecule of haemoglobin, consisting of nearly 300 amino acid residues, there is only a single amino acid difference between the normal and sickle forms, sickle-cell haemoglobin having valine whereas normal haemoglobin has glutamic acid. This result agreed closely with the prediction from the Pauling laboratory, based on electrophoretic properties, that sickle-cell haemoglobin has two to four more net positive charges than normal haemoglobin. Ingram's discovery showed for the first time that a change in a single amino acid, the consequence of a mutation in a single base pair, can be the cause of a specific disease. The results, published in <span class="italic">Nature</span> in 1956 and 1957, provided important support for the &#145;one gene, one protein&#146; hypothesis of George Wells Beadle and Edward Lawrie Tatum. They also led Ingram to be widely known as the &#145;father of molecular medicine&#146;.<br>
<br>Ingram continued to work for many years on the evolution, abnormalities, and embryology of haemoglobin (adult haemoglobin differing from foetal haemoglobin), and published <span class="italic">Haemoglobin and its Abnormalities</span> (1961) and <span class="italic">The Hemoglobins in Genetics and Evolution</span> (1963). By this time he had moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, having in 1958 accepted a one-year assistant professorship, which was extended (Ingram having decided that he liked the atmosphere at MIT and in the USA) and in 1961 converted into a full professorship.<br>
<br>The biology department at MIT had recently decided to focus on the new field of molecular biology and Ingram was a natural fit. Also, from 1961 to 1973, he lectured part-time in medicine at Columbia University in New York, where he collaborated in research on haemoglobin with Paul Marks. His first marriage ended in divorce, and in 1984 he married Elizabeth (Beth) Hendee, and with her he served as a much-loved housemaster at Ashdown House, an MIT graduate residence hall. In 1988 he succeeded John M. Buchanan as the John and Dorothy Wilson professor of biology. From 1989 to 1999 he served as director of the MIT experimental study group, initiating annual teaching seminars for student instructors and contributing to innovative teaching methods. He never retired, and continued working in the laboratory until his death.<br>
<br>Ingram's later research shifted to thalassaemia (he discovered that thalassaemia has two variants, alpha and beta), and thence to Alzheimer's disease. His interest in the latter was sparked by his second wife, Beth, who worked with people with Down's syndrome. (Nearly all people with Down's syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease by the age of forty.) His research focused on trying to identify compounds that obliterate the plaques composed of mis-folded &#946;-amyloid protein that form in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Although he was unable to reach any definite conclusion by the time of his death, his research opened up several fruitful lines of enquiry, and had important implications for the study of Alzheimer's and of such other protein-based diseases as Huntington's disease and prion diseases (including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). They also provided tools for the investigation of a new class of functional amyloid proteins. These final papers capped a history of publication spanning more than fifty years.<br>
<br>Ingram was an extremely modest man, who always acknowledged the work of others, and described himself as simply a lucky link in the chain of human discovery. He nevertheless received many honours, including election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1970, fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1987, and member of the (American) National Academy of Sciences in 2004. In 2002 a former Ashdown House resident successfully petitioned to have an asteroid named 6285 Ingram, after Vernon and Beth Ingram. He was an accomplished pianist, an active supporter of the Rockport (Massachusetts) chamber music festival, and a talented photographer, specializing in close-up photographs of plants and flowers. He died at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, on 17 August 2006 after surgery for injuries sustained in a fall, and was survived by his wife, Beth, and the two children of his first marriage.<br>
