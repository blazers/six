<span class="headword">Fisher,  Samuel</span>  (1605/6&#150;1681), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was the son of John Fisher of Northampton. From the ages given in the preface to a published sermon and in his will he was born between 8 November 1605 and 10 March 1606. He matriculated as a plebeian at Trinity College, Oxford, on 5 December 1623, aged eighteen; the congruence between the date of birth derived from the matriculation record with that from other sources confirms that it refers to him rather than to the future Quaker of the same name with whom he has been confused. Fisher graduated BA on 6 June 1627 and proceeded MA from New Inn Hall on 19 November 1630. When the Warwickshire Anglican John Hinckley suggested in 1671 that many ejected ministers &#145;have little more learning than your <i>English</i> books have taught them, as great Strangers to the Writings of the first Centuries, as they have been to the Universities&#146;, Baxter rattled off a list of west midland nonconformists to disprove Hinckley's innuendo, Fisher among them  (Keeble and Nuttall, 2.116).<br>
<br>On 18 December 1640 Fisher wrote to the leading puritan gentleman Sir Robert Harley asking for action to be taken against Francis Rowley, a seminary priest of Whitchurch, Shropshire, who had called the peers who had petitioned the king for a parliament the summer before as &#145;a company of Puritan rascalls, base fellows and base scabbs&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 3.70). By this time Fisher was curate of the parish of Withington, near Shrewsbury, under its puritan vicar, Thomas Blake, and had a patron, one Mr Barker. In the summer of 1642 Fisher, then living at the neighbouring parish of Upton Magna, made several unavailing attempts to persuade Sir Richard Newport to take up arms for parliament.<br>
<br>Shrewsbury was firmly in royalist hands from the autumn of 1642 until February 1645, and it is possible that Samuel Fisher went to London. On 3 March 1643 the House of Lords confirmed an order of the Commons of 23 January which provided that a man of that name should replace the sequestered William Watts as vicar of St Alban, Wood Street. This person resigned in 1646, and it was on 21 August of that year that a Samuel Fisher was admitted as curate of St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury. Named in 1647 as one of the ministers of the first Shropshire classis, Fisher confirmed his convictions by signing the <span class="italic">Testament</span> of ministers in that county in 1648. Fisher shared the presbyterian hostility to the regicide and the new regime. On 23 August 1650 the council of state ordered the governor of Shrewsbury to secure and examine Fisher as to his record, and towards the end of the year he was removed from St Mary's after refusing the engagement.<br>
<br>Fisher spent a period as preacher at St Bride's, London, where he provided the funeral sermons for two citizens' wives&#151;Mrs Holgate and Mrs Baker&#151;which he published in <span class="italic">A Love-Token for Mourners: Teaching Spiritual Dumbness and Submission under Gods Smarting Rod</span> (1655). His prefaces to these sermons, and to &#145;An antidote against the fear of death&#146; which he published in the same volume, convey the scars and bitterness left by the dangers he had faced in Shrewsbury.<blockquote>I have not wanted strong provocations [to go into print] from the vinegar fretting pens of other men who have endangered my liberty by traducing my Doctrine, wresting my words, and charging me (beyond what I ever thought) with that which their own wicked hearts had forged.</blockquote>In the margin he named &#145;Mr Studley and some others&#146;  (Fisher, &#145;To the reader&#146;, <span class="italic">Love-Token</span>). Studley presumably means Peter Studley, the contentious Shropshire Anglican, or perhaps (as he had died in July 1648) a relation of his; Fisher may have been referring to the events which drove him from Shropshire to London during the first civil war rather than later events. Fisher also recalled how the &#145;Antidote&#146; was composed from &#145;Some Thoughts, which the Author used to flatter and allure my Soul to be well-pleased with Death&#146; during the dangerous summer of 1650 when he and Thomas Blake<blockquote>stayed in Shrewsbury (in the time of Gods last visitation of that Place by the Pestilence) to execute their Pastoral Office amongst their people that did abide there in that doleful time where they were under the continual expectation of arrest. (Fisher, <span class="italic">Love-Token</span>, 183)</blockquote>Fisher settled at Thornton in the Moors, Cheshire, a living to which, as he recalled in 1673, he was presented by Sir George Booth. At Thornton one Richard Bowker, ordained in July 1653, seems to have acted as an assistant. Fisher, however, was not formally admitted to the rectory until 25 May 1654. In November 1656, in a letter advising him to move from Manchester to Shrewsbury, Richard Baxter admitted to Henry Newcome that the one argument that he could not refute was the advice of the latter's neighbouring ministers, singling out &#145;judicious and honest Mr Fisher&#146;  (Keeble and Nuttall, 1.233).<br>
<br>After his ejection in 1662 Fisher seems to have settled at Birmingham. He married, though nothing is known of his wife. Of his children at least three, Samuel, Charles, and Hannah, reached adulthood. In 1672, the king wrote to Robert Blayney, enclosing a petition of April 1672 signed by ten inhabitants of Birmingham in which they and &#145;Mr Samuel Fisher, Master of Artes of the Presbyterian persuasion&#146; sought permission for the town hall and his house to be licensed as meeting places  (Turner, 1.279). On 1 May, a licence was granted for Fisher's house. He was still resident at Birmingham on 8 November 1677 when his will, which includes a bequest to his dear friend Richard Blayney, was signed. By this time both his wife and his son Charles Fisher were dead. The testator recorded with heartfelt warmth the devotion of his one surviving daughter, Hannah, who had &#145;continued in her virginity to be a help and comfort to her parents even in and to their old age&#146;, naming her his chief beneficiary. Samuel Fisher died in 1681 and was buried at St Martin's, Birmingham, on 5 September.<br>
