<span class="headword">Whitaker,  Joseph</span>  (1820&#150;1895), <span class="occ">publisher</span>, was born in London on 4 May 1820, the son of a silversmith. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to Mr Barritt, bookseller, of Fleet Street, London. Nine years later he joined the firm of John William Parker in the Strand. He then became the London agent for the Oxford booksellers J. H. and J. Parker, opening a branch in the Strand.<br>
<br>In 1849 Whitaker started the <span class="italic">Penny Post</span>, the first penny monthly church magazine, which long continued in its original form, and edited an edition of the <span class="italic">Morning and Evening Church Services</span>. In 1850 he projected and published for four years the <span class="italic">Educational Register</span> and <span class="italic">Whitaker's Clergyman's Diary</span>. He then started his own business as a theological publisher in Pall Mall. In 1855 he moved to the Strand, where he published, with the assistance of Thomas Delph, <span class="italic">The Artist</span>, a fine-art review. Between 1856 and 1859 he edited the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. In January 1858 Whitaker started <span class="italic">The Bookseller</span>, intended primarily as an organ for booksellers and publishers, but also for book buyers generally. The new monthly journal was very successful, and was well received by the bookselling and publishing trade; in 1860 <span class="italic">Bent's Literary Advertiser</span> was merged with it. His most significant publication was <span class="italic">Whitaker's Almanack</span>, of which he was founding editor. This began in 1868: 36,000 copies of the first issue were subscribed before publication. For a long time the <span class="italic">Almanack</span>, like <span class="italic">The Bookseller</span>, changed little except in the direction of natural expansion.<br>
<br>Along with other British publishers, Whitaker had a large share in the organization of a relief fund, which ultimately reached &pound;2000, for Paris booksellers and their assistants who had suffered during the Prussian siege of the city in the winter of 1870&#150;71. As a distributor of the fund he was one of the first Englishmen to enter Paris after the siege.<br>
<br>In 1874 Whitaker produced the <span class="italic">Reference Catalogue of Current Literature</span>, which consisted of a collection of catalogues of books on sale by English publishers, with an elaborate index. This went through many editions until 1898. He published a few devotional works, including <span class="italic">The Daily Round</span> and Ridley's <span class="italic">Holy Communion</span>. Whitaker was always a keen and judicious defender of the interests of the bookselling trade, and was recognized as an authority on copyright. In 1875 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He died at his home, White Lodge, Enfield, Middlesex, on 15 May 1895.<br>
<br>Whitaker had a family of fifteen children, of whom the eldest was <a name="cosubject_29225"></a><span class="headword">Joseph Vernon Whitaker</span>  (1845&#150;1895)<span class="occ"></span>. He was born on 3 February 1845, and was educated at Bloxham School. He preferred a life of adventure to business, and, after a voyage to the East Indies, enlisted in the army, and became a sergeant at the age of twenty-one. Having purchased his discharge, he entered the office of <span class="italic">The Bookseller</span> for a year or two. At the invitation of George William Childs of Philadelphia he went to the United States; he was editor of the <span class="italic">American Literary Gazette</span>, and then acted as sub-editor of the <span class="italic">Public Ledger</span> for three years. He returned to England in 1875 to resume his connection with <span class="italic">The Bookseller</span>, and ultimately became editor of both it and the <span class="italic">Reference Catalogue</span>. In 1880 he started the <span class="italic">Stationery Trades' Journal</span> with his father. He took an active interest in all trade questions, especially those of a social and charitable character. He and his American wife, whom he married in 1875, had two children. He died on 15 January 1895, at Redcliffe Gardens, South Kensington, London. He was survived by his father by a few months and by one of his children.<br>
