<span class="headword">Fitzhenry <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Flannigan; <em>other married name </em>Gregory]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1790), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was the daughter of the innkeeper of the Ferry Boat tavern in Abbey Street, Dublin, where she was born. Her precise date of birth is uncertain, but was presumably in the early 1720s, calculating from the date of her marriage on 15 January 1742 to Captain John Gregory, the commander of a ship trading between Dublin and Bordeaux. The deaths of her father and husband between about 1750 and 1752 resulted in her travelling to London in 1753 and to her first engagement a year later at Covent Garden, as Hermione in Ambrose Philips's <span class="italic">The Distressed Mother</span> on 10 January 1754. Again, the circumstances leading to this choice of a career in acting and to a d&eacute;but with such a celebrated company are unknown; interestingly, unlike many of her contemporaries on the stage, she never excited gossip or scandal of a kind which gave rise to speculations, reminiscences, or anecdotes about her early life and the stages of her rise to fame. Although she added Alicia, in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span>, to her repertory on 23 March 1754, she did not reappear at Covent Garden in the ensuing season; it has been supposed that a marked Irish accent may account for this, but, if so, it did not prevent her returning to Covent Garden in 1757 to play, in addition to Hermione, Calista in Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span> and, for her benefit on 26 March, Lady Macbeth and Catherine in Garrick's <span class="italic">Catherine and Petruchio</span>, when she acted opposite Edward Shuter. During the intervening years, still appearing as Mrs Gregory, she performed for two seasons at the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, as Hermione, Zara in William Congreve's <span class="italic">The Mourning Bride</span>, Zaphira in John Brown's <span class="italic">Barbarossa</span>, and Volumnia in <span class="italic">Coriolanus</span>. That in Dublin she could command a salary of &pound;300, rising rapidly to &pound;400, argues that after only one season at Covent Garden she was already viewed as a highly accomplished and indeed an established actress.<br>
<br>It was at the Smock Alley Theatre in October 1757 that she was first billed in the role of Calista as Mrs Fitzhenry, the name by which she is best known. Her marriage to Edward Fitzhenry (<i>d</i>. 1772), a lawyer of some standing, with whom she had a son and a daughter, must therefore have taken place in the summer of 1757. For some time she became caught up in the rivalry between Benjamin Victor and Spranger Barry, and later between Barry and Henry Mossop, which occasioned her moving between the companies at Smock Alley and Crow Street; clearly she was seen as enough of a draw to make her a sought-after asset for either of the Dublin managements. Between 1759 and 1764 she extended her range further by playing Isabella in <span class="italic">Measure for Measure</span>, Emilia in <span class="italic">Othello</span>, Gertrude in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, Queen Katharine in <span class="italic">Henry VIII</span>, Cleopatra in John Dryden's <span class="italic">All for Love</span>, and Mandane in Arthur Murphy's <span class="italic">The Orphan of China</span>, roles which, with Roxana in Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span> (first played at Drury Lane on 9 April 1766), Margaret of Anjou in Thomas Francklin's <span class="italic">The Earl of Warwick</span>, and Aspasia in Rowe's <span class="italic">Tamerlane</span>, she was to sustain for the remainder of her career. Although her second husband died in October 1772, she continued to perform for some years in Dublin (there are records of appearances at the Smock Alley Theatre as Mrs Belleville in Hugh Kelly's <span class="italic">The School for Wives</span> in the 1773&#150;4 season, and of a final performance there on 12 March 1783). It would seem significant that, with the notable exception of the role of Catherine, in which she appears to have been replaced after one performance, the parts in which she consistently excelled were from the tragic repertory (Mossop billed her when he took his company to the New Theatre Royal, Cork, in 1768 as the &#145;noted <i>tragedienne</i>&#146;). Her technical range within the tragic mode was extensive and subtle, to judge by the list of roles which first won and then sustained her eminence, though she was clearly more an admired than a popular actress. She died in November 1790 at Ballinahallen, near Enniscorthy, co. Wexford, where she lived after her retirement.<br>
