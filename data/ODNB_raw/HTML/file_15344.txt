<span class="headword">Kendall,  Edward Augustus</span>  (1775/6&#150;1842), <span class="occ">writer</span>, of whose life very little is known, had a varied literary output, which divides into four categories: his serious ideas and proposals for political and social reforms, for example his letters on the state of Ireland; his weekly &#145;popular&#146; journalism which, ambitiously, might be described as a forerunner of Harmsworth; his translations from the French; and his children's books.<br>
<br>In 1809 Kendall published an account of his travels in North America, having previously been &#145;employed in a civil capacity in Canada&#146;  (Watkins and Shoberl). In 1817 he issued proposals for the Patriotic Metropolitan Institution in London for the assistance of new settlers in the colonies and for the encouragement of new branches of colonial trade. He also proposed the establishment of new colonies for the Eurasians of India and metis of the West Indies. And he urged the benefits to be derived from establishing in England free drawing schools and schools of chemistry and mathematics.<br>
<br>Aiming to provide cheap and good literature for the people, Kendall started in London in 1819 the <span class="italic">Literary Chronicle and Weekly Review</span>, which lasted until 1828, when he started a new series which was shortly to be incorporated with <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>. There is also an edition entitled the <span class="italic">Country Literary Chronicle</span>, beginning in 1820 with a part numbered 59. The <span class="italic">Literary Chronicle</span> was succeeded by another popular miscellany projected by Kendall, called <span class="italic">The Olio, or, Museum of Entertainment</span> (11 vols., 1823&#150;33). These efforts at periodical literature were described in Kendall's <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> obituary as having originated &#145;the present deep and deservedly popular race of weekly issues from the press&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>). Kendall also wrote the more weighty <span class="italic">Letters to a friend on the state of Ireland, the Roman Catholic question, and the merits of constitutional religious distinctions</span> (1826), in which he argued that Ireland enjoyed a vigorous and paternal government, whose duty it was to repress Roman Catholicism there, and in Great Britain as well.<br>
<br>Kendall's most attractive works, however, are his books for children, some of which were still being reprinted fifty years after his death, especially <span class="italic">Keeper's Travels in Search of his Master</span> (1799); <span class="italic">The Crested Wren</span> (1799); and <span class="italic">Burford Cottage and its Robin Red Breast</span> (1835), the last of which is a long novel narrated by a robin, who discourses on natural history and other improving topics. Kendall's educative impulses can also be seen in his earlier <span class="italic">Parental Education, or, Domestic Lessons: a Miscellany Intended for Youth</span> (1803). His children's books are generally marked, however, by a sentimental style which has now long been out of fashion, although his lengthy <span class="italic">The English Boy at the Cape: an Anglo-African Story</span> (1835) is more mature and less sentimental than his other children's books.<br>
<br>Kendall was also a member of the Society of Antiquaries, and his more scholarly work included translations from the French such as Saint-Pierre's <span class="italic">The Indian Cottage</span> (1791); <span class="italic">Beauties of Saint-Pierre, Selected from his &#145;Studies of Nature&#146;</span> (1799); and <span class="italic">The Travels of Denon in Egypt</span> (2 vols., 1802).<br>
<br>Kendall died at Pimlico, London, on 14 October 1842, aged sixty-six, and was buried there.<br>
