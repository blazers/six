<span class="headword">Somerville,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1632, <em>d.</em> 1693), <span class="occ">family historian</span>, was baptized on 24 January 1632 at Newhall, Lanarkshire, the eldest son of James Somerville (1596&#150;1677) of Drum and his wife, Lilias Bannatyne (1607/8&#150;1675). The elder Somerville, who was by right the ninth Lord Somerville but never assumed the title as he felt that he lacked the wealth to support it, travelled widely and gained martial experience with the French and Venetian forces. Returning to Scotland, he sided with the presbyterian covenanters against Charles I, serving under General Leslie. He was made a major and held a command at the siege of Edinburgh Castle in 1640. James Somerville was with his father at that siege, although he was only nine. In 1645 he was in the cavalry muster held by David Leslie on Gladsmuir to deal with the royalist threat from Montrose.<br>
<br>In 1647 smallpox and consumption killed Somerville's two brothers, leaving him the only surviving male heir of the house of Somerville. His father became more reluctant to risk his son's life and resolved that he should never leave Scotland. In 1648 Somerville senior was persuaded by his relations to purchase the decayed family barony of Cambusnethan in Lanarkshire; he moved there with his family at Easter in that year.<br>
<br>The elder Somerville's political views changed with the execution of Charles I and the Cromwellian threat to Scotland. Despite his concern for his son's safety he took him to Edinburgh, where royalist forces were gathering, and placed him at the service of Charles II, who had recently (June 1650) arrived in Scotland. Somerville was attached to the retinue of the earl of Eglinton, who commanded the King's horse guards, and saw much of the action that followed Cromwell's march into Scotland, including the Scottish defeat at Dunbar on 3 September 1650. While he was in this service, Somerville met John Bannatyne of Corhouse and his daughter Martha (1633&#150;1679), his future wife. After Dunbar, Somerville returned to Cambusnethan, which was threatened by the forces of the Association, the hard-line presbyterians who, while opposed to Cromwell, were also hostile to the royalists. He clashed with them briefly.<br>
<br>The next period of Somerville's life was taken up with military concerns. After visiting the court of Charles II at Perth, in November 1650 he joined the cavalry of his cousin Major-General Robert Montgomery, which was charged either to defeat or come to terms with the Association forces of colonels Ker and Strachan. Montgomery entrusted Somerville with the task of negotiating with these forces but by the time Somerville reached Renfrew events had gone too far for negotiations, and he joined the royalist forces on Ruglen, which were mustered to stop Cromwell taking Hamilton. The Cromwellian troops briefly took the town in a night attack but were driven out shortly afterwards. Soon after this Somerville returned to Cambusnethan.<br>
<br>Cromwell was not long in reoccupying Hamilton, and his forces made life increasingly unsafe for royalists in the area. Somerville and his father moved north to safety, and attended the coronation of Charles II at Scone on 1 January 1651. They then visited, at Struthers in Fife, the duke of Hamilton who offered the elder Somerville a command in the royalist forces. This he declined, but again placed his son in royal service, as a volunteer. He regretted this when Charles II decided to invade England, and wrote to his son, telling him to leave the army, but the young Somerville was resolved to go. A stratagem was employed to prevent him: he was lured into the home of his betrothed, Martha Bannatyne, after which the gate was locked and kept so until the army had gone. Somerville thus escaped involvement in the Scottish defeat at Worcester, which ended the royalist cause.<br>
<br>This was the end of Somerville's military career. He spent the years of Cromwellian occupation quietly, and married Martha Bannatyne at Leshamahago church in Lanark on 13 November 1651. His father was involved in the abortive royalist rising of 1653, but Somerville himself took no part in this. His father's death on 3 January 1677 left him the <i>de jure</i> tenth Lord Somerville, but, for the same reasons as his parent, he refused to assume the title.<br>
<br>Somerville studied family records, and completed his &#145;Memorie of the Somervilles&#146; by 1679, the year of his wife's death; the work, edited by Walter Scott, was published in 1816. A large portion of the work deals with his father's life, and describes the turbulent mid-century events in Scotland, with a markedly royalist and episcopalian bias; he regarded his father's adherence to the presbyterian covenanter cause as an unfortunate aberration. This royalism did not prevent Somerville from speaking against abuses of power by royal government. In March 1684 he served on a jury in the trial of Campbell of Cessnock for treason and, with two other jurors, protested against royal proceedings in the case. He and his associates were indicted for riot in interrupting the court, but the charge was later dropped.<br>
<br>Somerville married again on 15 March 1685. His new wife was Margaret Jamieson. On 15 June the next year he was appointed a commissioner of supply for Edinburgh. Despite his loyalty to the Stuarts, he does not seem actively to have opposed the revolution of 1688. He died on 7 February 1693 and was buried in Liberton church, Edinburgh, on 9 February. His eldest son by his first marriage had been accidentally killed in 1682 when trying to separate two friends who were fighting, and he was succeeded as head of the house of Somerville by his grandson, also called James. Margaret Somerville died some time before 19 October 1717.<br>
