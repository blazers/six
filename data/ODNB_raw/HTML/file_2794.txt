<span class="headword">Boleyn,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1603), <span class="occ">dean of Lichfield</span>, is often said to have been the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70799/', "Jane Boleyn, n&#233;e Parker (d. 1542)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2793/', "George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford")</script>, executed in 1536 on a charge of incest with his sister, Queen Anne Boleyn. In his will of 1603, George Boleyn refers to Sir William Knollys, grandson of Mary Boleyn, Queen Anne's sister, as his kinsman, but the fact that Rochford's inquisition post-mortem names Mary, rather than George, as his heir throws doubt on the supposition that George was his son, or at any rate on George's legitimacy. Considering the Boleyn family's difficult political position in the years after the queen's execution, it is perhaps not surprising that George's ancestry should have remained unacknowledged, and that he seems to have been bitter about the loss of his inheritance.<br>
<br>George Boleyn may have been born in London; he matriculated at Cambridge in November 1544. That he was a sizar suggests an impoverished background. A member of Trinity Hall, he graduated BA in 1552, proceeding MA in 1560, BTh in 1567, and DTh in 1576. On 29 September 1559 he obtained his first significant ecclesiastical appointment, being presented to the prebend of Ulleskelf, in York Minster. He was subsequently named rector of Kempston, Nottinghamshire, and was installed as a prebendary of Canterbury Cathedral on 21 December 1566. Here his career was marred by his &#145;chollerick&#146; nature and his admitted tendency to swear when provoked. In 1573 he was charged with threatening to nail the dean to the wall, thrashing a lawyer, and attempting to strike a fellow canon, Anthony Rushe. Two years later he attacked one of the six preachers with a dagger and was suspended for four months, against which sentence he appealed to the queen. Nevertheless the dean and chapter presented him to the rectory of St Dionis Backchurch, London, in February 1575. He resigned this living in 1592, and in 1595, not without difficulty, was appointed to the rectory of Bangor, Caernarvonshire.<br>
<br>On 22 December 1576 Boleyn had been installed as dean of Lichfield. He remained a prebendary of both Canterbury (where, although non-resident, he attempted to secure a better house for himself) and of York. Always argumentative, he became involved in a dispute with the bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, William Overton, who was said to have been poor and &#145;laboured all he could to supply himself from his clergy&#146;  (Strype, <span class="italic">Whitgift</span>, 1.201). Boleyn resisted Overton's demands, eventually appealing to the privy council, which asked the archbishop of Canterbury to resolve the matter, and also writing to Lord Burghley for assistance. Boleyn was clearly concerned about his own emoluments. In addition to his stipend as dean of Lichfield, he continued to receive about &pound;40 a year from Canterbury and &pound;34 from York. A schedule of fees payable at Lichfield adopted during his tenure shows that he was to be paid &pound;20 on the occasion of the burial of a bishop and &pound;10 for the burial of a residentiary canon. But the surviving records suggest that he did not make a great impact on the cathedral establishment. The fact that there is no continuous chapter act book for his years as dean may imply inefficiency or lack of concern about record keeping.<br>
<br>At court Boleyn attempted, sometimes wittily, to use his relationship with the queen to secure a bishopric. It was later said that she offered to appoint him bishop of Worcester, but that he declined. In an engaging letter to Burghley, dated 10 June 1589, Boleyn asked for help in persuading John Still, master of Trinity College, Cambridge, to grant a scholarship to a poor boy whom Boleyn had befriended and educated. Both the Martin Marprelate tracts and John Manningham's diary contain references to Boleyn's dog, which accompanied him to church and occasionally interrupted the services.<br>
<br>It is disappointment and anxiety, however, rather than cheerfulness and wit, which are principally conveyed by Boleyn's will, drawn up on 12 January 1603  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/101, fol. 1<i>r</i>). He names seven men and women as his executors, including Archbishop Whitgift, &#145;because that he onely spake for me to her maiestie to give me my preferments&#146;; Sir Thomas Egerton and Lord Hunsdon, because they had helped him retain his living of Bangor when he had looked likely to lose it; and Sir John Fortescue, because he had prevented &#145;the ruine and downfall of this our church of Lichfield&#146;. Later in his will Boleyn refers darkly to &#145;machivils&#146; who &#145;make more accompte of private gaine then of the good of the church&#146;. But the most remarkable of his proposed executors is the first, Queen Elizabeth herself, &#145;because that her maiestie gave me all that ever I have and subiectes gave me nothing and therefore knowe no cause wherefore I should be beholden to anie of them&#146;. It was in keeping with this resentful frame of mind that Boleyn should have made no individual bequests whatever&#151;all his movable goods were to be distributed among his menservants. He had died, in Lichfield, by 25 January 1603 and was buried in Lichfield Cathedral.<br>
