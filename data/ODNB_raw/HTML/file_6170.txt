<span class="headword">Cooke, Sir  John</span>  (1666&#150;1710), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born on 29 August 1666, the third son of John Cooke of Whitechapel, London, surveyor of the customs, and his wife, Mary Bathurst. He was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School in 1673, and from there was elected to St John's College, Oxford, in 1684. While still a student, being a supporter of William III, he obtained a lieutenant's commission in an infantry regiment, and served in Ireland at the time of the battle of the Boyne. On returning to Oxford he resumed his studies, and graduated BCL in 1691 and DCL in 1694.<br>
<br>He was admitted as an advocate of the court of arches on 20 October 1694, and three days later became a member of Doctors' Commons. On 19 December 1695 he married Mary (<i>d</i>. 1709), the only daughter of Matthew and Mary Bateman, of London; the couple had one daughter. In 1699 Cooke served as counsel for Archbishop Tenison in the House of Lords to justify the archbishop's deprivation of Dr Thomas Watson from the bishopric of St David's. Cooke was almost certainly the author of the anonymous pamphlet <span class="italic">A Summary View of the Articles Exhibited Against the Late Bishop of St. David's</span> (1701), which defended the archbishop's proceedings against Watson and countered the claim that a bishop could only be deprived in a synod. Robert Ferguson, who wrote in support of Watson, described this pamphlet as &#145;scurrilous and virulent&#146; and its author as a &#145;mercenary tool&#146; of the archbishop  (Ferguson, 64).<br>
<br>On 21 May 1701 Cooke received the honour of knighthood, and on 26 July of that year William III appointed him advocate-general. His competitor for that position was Dr Thomas Lane, who had been a captain of horse on King James's side at the battle of the Boyne, where he was wounded. When told that both men were good advocates but that &#145;the first fought against you, the other fought for you&#146;, the king said: &#145;Oh, I will have my own fellow soldier&#146;  (Lansdowne MS, 987/201). In 1702 Cooke served as a commissioner to negotiate a union between England and Scotland, and in the same year he was named to the renewed commission for building St Paul's. On 11 March 1703 Archbishop Tenison appointed Cooke to succeed Dr George Oxenden as official principal and dean of the arches. He also named him as his vicar-general, and as dean and commissary of the peculiars belonging to the archbishop.<br>
<br>In 1706 Cooke was appointed clerk of the pipe in the exchequer. He died at his house in Great Knight Rider Street, London, on 31 March 1710, and was buried at St Mary's, Whitechapel, on 2 April.<br>
