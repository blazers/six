<span class="headword">Townson,  Robert</span>  (1762&#150;1827), <span class="occ">natural historian and traveller</span>, was born early in 1762 at Spring Grove, Marshgate, Richmond, Surrey, the youngest child of London merchant and insurer John Townson (1721&#150;1773) and Sarah Shewell (1731&#150;1805), daughter of James Shewell (1708&#150;1786) and Sarah Smith (<i>d</i>. 1748). The Shewells were partners in the brewery trade with Samuel Whitbread and the publishing business with Thomas Longman. Sarah Shewell was the wife of Charles Aldcroft (<i>d</i>. 1774), a London haberdasher, with whom she had one child, James Aldcroft (1752&#150;1796), who later took the name Townson. This was because John Townson and Sarah Shewell had carried on a concealed &#145;criminal conversation&#146; since about 1753 which yielded three other children&#151;Mary (1754&#150;1822), Ann (1756&#150;1811), and John (1760&#150;1835)&#151;in addition to Robert before they married in 1766. John Townson died in 1773 at Hackney. A neighbour there, John Witts (1750&#150;1816), who married Robert's sister Ann in 1774, was inducted vicar of Cardington, Shropshire, in 1777, whereon the Townson family took up residence beneath the Lawley, in beautiful countryside which was greatly to influence Robert's later career.<br>
<br>From about 1777 to 1783 Townson was apprenticed in Manchester but finding his interests were not mercantile, he set off to travel, largely on foot, through France and Italy to Sicily. In 1787, on his way home, he studied chemistry and assaying under Balthasar Georges Sage (1740&#150;1824) at the &Eacute;cole des Mines in Paris. In 1788 he enrolled as a student of medicine and chemistry, and later of botany, at Edinburgh University. He planned a career in surgery, but Edinburgh soon showed him he should instead become a natural historian. In 1790 he was duly elected president of the student Edinburgh Natural History Society and in 1791 a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, proposed by James Hutton, the geologist.<br>
<br>In 1791 Townson unsuccessfully applied to become government naturalist to the colony of Upper Canada. In 1792, after he had left Edinburgh without graduating, his paper &#145;Observations against the perceptivity of plants&#146; was read to the Linnean Society in London. His travel plans having failed, he enrolled late in 1791 as a student of natural history at the University of G&ouml;ttingen, going there by way of Uppsala and Copenhagen. While in G&ouml;ttingen he took a year off to travel to Vienna and throughout Austrian Habsburg lands. He returned to G&ouml;ttingen and published his first works, on reptilian physiology, in 1794 and 1795. He returned home in 1795 and was awarded the degree of LLD in 1796 by Edinburgh University. He settled again in Shropshire where his <span class="italic">Travels in Hungary</span> (1797) was written. This contained pioneering botanical, entomological, and petrographic observations and spirited descriptions of his exploits, including those in the Tatra Mountains and in Slovakian caves.<br>
<br>Townson then sought the patronage of the East India Company to undertake mineralogical surveys in India, convinced, by his experiences in Germany, of the need for proper encouragement of such science. But this too was unsuccessful, as was a similar 1797 application to the Sierra Leone Company, which it was thought might distract attention from agriculture there. So Townson stayed in Shropshire and wrote his significant <span class="italic">Philosophy of Mineralogy</span> (1798), <span class="italic">A Poor Man's Moralist</span> (1798; five editions up to 1804), and <span class="italic">Tracts and Observations in Natural History</span> (1799). This last was the most important work. It completed the description of his pioneering experiments in reptilian physiology and gave a remarkable account of the geology of Shropshire.<br>
<br>Disillusioned by his failures to obtain patronage, Townson started travelling again, in England and in Europe. Between 1802 and 1805 he spent much time compiling a <span class="italic">History of Yorkshire</span>, a planned major county history abandoned only through lack of subscribers. In May 1805 his mother died and he decided to follow his Royal Marines officer brother John to Australia. With all his natural history collections gathered in Shropshire, but his manuscripts burnt, he set off in December 1806. Despite promises by the British government of land, and assurances that he was the type of settler most needed, on his arrival he found the governor, William Bligh (1754&#150;1817), of a completely different opinion. Promises made in London were not kept and Townson became one of the &#145;rum rebels&#146; who helped depose Bligh in 1808. In 1811 he was at last granted land and settled at Varro Ville, near Sydney; but his scientific aspirations to explore Australia had been thwarted by Bligh and the primitive state of democracy in the colony. His attempts to investigate the novel natural history of his new country were equally frustrated.<br>
<br>At Varro Ville Townson became a successful farmer and wine producer, using the scientific methods which had proved so uninteresting to his contemporaries. He was still trying to return to Britain in 1820 but, finding the disposal of his estates impossible, he remained, somewhat embittered, until his death there on 27 June 1827. He was buried in St John's churchyard, Parramatta, on 3 July. He left goods worth under &pound;10,000.<br>
