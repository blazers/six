<span class="headword">Haistwell,  Edward</span>  (<em>c.</em>1658&#150;1709), <span class="occ">merchant</span>, was the son of Thomas Haistwell of Orton, Westmorland. An active Quaker, he was at the age of nineteen or twenty employed as an amanuensis by George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends. During this engagement, lasting from March 1677 to June 1678, he accompanied Fox on missionary journeys through England, Holland, and Germany and kept his employer's journal. William Penn and Robert Barclay also accompanied Fox to the continent and thus Haistwell would at an early age have been well acquainted with many of the emerging leaders of the Quaker movement.<br>
<br>At the end of his service to Fox in 1678, Haistwell became an informal apprentice or clerk to James Claypoole (1634&#150;1687), a Quaker merchant of Scotts Yard, Bush Lane, in the parish of St Mary Bothaw, London, whose business included the importation of sugar from the West Indies, linen and beer from Germany, wine from Bordeaux, and furs from Hudson's Bay. When Claypoole decided to emigrate to Pennsylvania in 1683, he turned over his premises and his not too large merchant business to Haistwell, who continued Claypoole's activity in the &#145;open&#146;, or unregulated, trades, particularly that to the West Indies. It is likely that the young man received financial help from his father with whom he afterwards had some joint ventures.<br>
<br>The customs records for 1686 (TNA: PRO E 190/143/1) show that Haistwell's principal importation was sugar from Barbados, though he also entered ginger from there and Nevis, and much logwood from Jamaica. He also imported wine from the Canaries, wine and brandy from Bordeaux, Brunswick mum (beer) from Bremen, linen from Bremen and Amsterdam, and tallow from Ireland. Some of these imported commodities, particularly linens, were almost certainly intended for re-export in his West Indian trade.<br>
<br>In 1687 Haistwell married Rachel, daughter of Richard Marsh, a merchant of London but originally from Lyme Regis. Marsh was a more important merchant than Haistwell, whose business and affluence began to grow noticeably following this alliance. His grander style of living soon attracted unkind comments from some offended Quakers, and, to mollify them, Haistwell removed the pictures he had recently hung on his walls. His higher status was reinforced when, on 11 February 1692, he was admitted a freeman of the prestigious Grocers' Company. In the 1690s, supported by the greater resources of his father-in-law, Haistwell ventured into the tobacco trade on a large scale, importing from Virginia and Maryland and exporting to the continent&#151;primarily to Rotterdam, but also in some volume to Germany and Spain where his father-in-law also traded (he sometimes acted jointly with his father, Thomas, and with Anthony Haistwell, presumably a kinsman).<br>
<br>Haistwell owned shares in the old East India Company by 1696 and bought more in the following years, but this investment did not constitute a partisan commitment. In 1697 he also acquired shares in the second subscription to the Bank of England and, when Richard Marsh died in 1704, Haistwell's wife, Rachel, inherited from her father over &pound;6000 in additional bank shares. These holdings seem to have brought Haistwell into a co-operative relationship with Gilbert Heathcote and other important directors of the Bank of England. Haistwell subscribed &pound;1000 to the &pound;250,000 loan which several of the bank directors managed for the Habsburg emperor in 1706. In 1698 eight prominent City figures in the Heathcote group, directors of both the bank and the new East India Company, took advantage of Peter the Great's visit to England to obtain from the tsar an exclusive privilege of importing tobacco (formerly banned) into Russia. As none of them had much experience in tobacco, they welcomed the participation in their adventure of Haistwell, now quite familiar with that commodity, who became a manager of the undertaking. This adventure lasted on paper until 1723 but quite early found its privileges unenforceable in Russia and its earnings disappointing. In retrospect, the only lasting achievements of the adventurers were their successes in persuading parliament in 1699 to open the hitherto closed Russia Company and in influencing the ministry to send the first resident English minister to Moscow in 1705.<br>
<br>Haistwell died of fever, intestate, on 4 January 1709 in London and was buried on 7 or 8 January in the Quaker burial-ground, Ratcliff. His post-mortem inventory of 21 January shows that in addition to his fairly large house in Scotts Yard, Haistwell had a smaller suburban residence in Hampstead. Both appeared to be furnished in solid comfort but without pictures or other ostentatious items, except for a coach and chariot, two coach horses, and over &pound;250 worth of silver plate. His business interests then embraced shares in four ships, one chartered to the transport service, one to the East India Company, with two engaged in private trade to the East Indies. He was also partner with Anthony Haistwell in a firm that had large bill-of-exchange operations. On his own, he had an unspecified interest in mines at Tor Bay, Devon, and owned all or part of shipments of tobacco to Alicante and Bilbao and other goods at Barbados, Antigua, Virginia, and Archangel. Besides his part of the Russian Tobacco Company, Edward Haistwell had shares in the Bank of England, the new and old East India companies, and the Blue Paper Company, plus some Million Lottery tickets and exchequer annuities paying &pound;186 p.a. In addition to the loan to the German emperor, he was owed money by sundry persons in England as well as in Barbados, Lisbon, Alicante, Bremen, K&ouml;nigsberg, and Narva.<br>
<br>In 1698 Haistwell had become a fellow of the Royal Society&#151;as a patron rather than as an active scientist. William Penn's records show that Haistwell had been one of the eminent Friends who advanced &pound;100 each to a fund that enabled Penn to buy out the Ford family interest in the Pennsylvania grant. Haistwell had obviously advanced much more to support Penn's undertaking, for his own inventory showed &pound;1000 owed by Penn. Throughout his life, Haistwell remained an active Friend, contributing to the society's work. His most important services were as a member of the meeting for sufferings, a standing committee of the yearly meeting which in 1696 obtained the important parliamentary act permitting Friends to affirm rather than swear to proceedings in civil suits.<br>
<br>Haistwell's loyalty to the Quaker movement was not continued by his only surviving child, Edward (1696&#150;1744). Three years after his father's death, the son was admitted to the Middle Temple on 1 March 1712 and subsequently called to the bar on 23 May 1718. He also continued some of his father's investment interests, eventually becoming a major shareholder in and ultimately a director (1733&#150;42) of the post-Bubble South Sea Company. There is evidence that some of the money owed by the British government to the Russian Tobacco Company (primarily for hemp) was converted after the elder Edward Haistwell's death into shares in the new South Sea Company and thus provided part of the basis of his son's later role in that company. Neither the oaths required of barristers nor the slave-trading activities of the South Sea Company were compatible with the expectations of the Society of Friends.<br>
