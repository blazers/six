<span class="headword">Sadleir,  George Forster</span>  (1789&#150;1859), <span class="occ">army officer and explorer in Arabia</span>, was born on 19 January 1789 in Cork, the younger son of James Sadleir, a cotton manufacturer, and his wife, Joanna, daughter of George Forster of Cork. In April 1805 he was commissioned ensign in the 47th regiment of foot, being promoted lieutenant in 1806 and captain in 1813. In 1807 he was in the expedition that failed to take Buenos Aires and subsequently went with his battalion to India. Towards the end of 1812 Sadleir commanded a party sent to Tabriz to join a military mission engaged in training the Persian army. His services were recognized both by the shah, who presented him with a sword, and by the governor-general, Lord Hastings. After leaving Persia in 1815 Sadleir took part in campaigns in India on the political staff of Sir John Malcolm.<br>
<br>In the early nineteenth century the followers of Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#145;Abd al-Wahhab troubled the British by preying on commerce in the Persian Gulf and raids off the Indian coast. In August 1818 Ibrahim, son of Mehmet Ali Pasha, viceroy of Egypt, captured the Saudi capital of Dir&#145;iyyah. Lord Hastings determined to send an envoy to Ibrahim to propose an alliance, together with Muscat, to destroy the Qawasim pirates. The envoy was also to present a letter of congratulations and a sword and gather military and geographical information. Sadleir was chosen, received formal instructions on 14 April 1819, and sailed at once from Bombay.<br>
<br>The first part of Sadleir's mission was a failure because Sa&#145;id ibn Sultan, imam of Muscat, although receiving him affably, was unwilling to co-operate with the Egyptians. Sadleir arrived at Qatif on 21 June at a time when no European had been more than a few miles inland and no maps existed of the interior. He went inland to Hufuf, where he was informed that Ibrahim was near Dir&#145;iyyah, and decided to join a convoy that was going to his camp. He arrived to find that Ibrahim had recently departed and was at Rass, another ten days away in the very centre of the peninsula. At Rass he heard that Ibrahim was evacuating all but the Hejaz, and had withdrawn to Medina. Sadleir felt that he had done enough and wished to return to the coast. The Egyptian commander, however, said that the journey would need a large escort which he could not provide, so Sadleir had no choice but to continue. Near Medina he at last found Ibrahim, who expressed delight at the sword but declined to discuss politics. Sadleir then went down to the Red Sea coast at Yanbu&#145; al-Bahr, which he reached on 20 September.<br>
<br>There was no other crossing of the peninsula until 1914, when Captain W. H. I. Shakespear travelled from Kuwait to &#145;Aqabah. Sadleir's <span class="italic">Diary of a Journey across Arabia</span> (1866) describes a critical period of history for which there are no other accounts in European languages and few in Arabic. It is a valuable geographical document, noting wells, compass readings, and periods on the march. In 1904 D. G. Hogarth wrote that it was still the only source for many places. Sadleir is unique among Arabian explorers, for his journey was involuntary and he loathed both the place and its &#145;turbulent barbarians&#146;. He resolutely refused to conform to local customs and made not the slightest effort to understand the people. He showed himself stubborn, but also resilient, conscientious, brave, and not devoid of humour.<br>
<br>Sadleir continued to serve in India, took part in the First Anglo-Burmese War, and returned to England in 1828. He retired as a major in 1837 and became a sheriff of Cork in the same year. He married a Miss Ridings of Cork in 1847 or 1848 and then emigrated to New Zealand, where he died in Auckland on 2 December 1859.<br>
