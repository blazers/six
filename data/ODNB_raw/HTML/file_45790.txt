<span class="headword">Wells <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Whitford]</span>,  Helena</span>  (1761?&#150;1824), <span class="occ">novelist and educationist</span>, was born in South Carolina, America, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/65051/', "Robert Wells (1727/8&#150;1794)")</script> and his wife, Mary. She had a sister and an elder brother, the physician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29020/', "William Charles Wells")</script>. Her parents were Scottish and had settled in Charlestown, Carolina, where her father, a printer and publisher who wrote verse, gained a certain standing as a man of letters. Loyalists, they returned to England at the outbreak of the War of Independence, and her father became a merchant in Fleet Street. From 1789 she and her sister ran a school in London. In 1799 she published <span class="italic">Letters on Subjects of Importance to the Happiness of Young Females</span>, indicating a change of career to governess. The <span class="italic">Letters</span> were in keeping with the female epistolary tradition, including advice on appropriate reading and behaviour, with the usual declaratory preface that the work was not self-promotional but was intended to promote religion and draw young ladies away from frivolous pursuits. In the preface to the second edition (1807) she wrote that her intentions had broadened, so that she was no longer simply offering herself as an instructor of children, but also as a guide to youth. However, she broke with the tradition of completely discouraging girls from reading novels, believing that there were even some excellent romances, and also advocated the reading of history and epic poetry, both of which she believed strengthened the mind without making it &#145;masculine&#146;. She accepted that a woman, in contrast to a man, could not make her own way in the world unaided, and that &#145;woman has too often no protector but virtuous principle,&#151;no support but what she derives from her industry&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 2nd edn, 1807, 128).<br>
<br>Helena Wells also published novels which were critically well received even by the conservative <span class="italic">Anti-Jacobin Review</span>. Thus <span class="italic">The Step-Mother: a Domestic Tale from Real Life</span> (2 vols., 1799) was seen as safe, moral reading for the young, a form of conduct book. Her later novel, published in 1800, <span class="italic">Constantia Neville, or, The West Indian</span> (3 vols.) was again intended as an edifying alternative to the light reading of the circulating libraries. Indeed, Constantia Neville was to serve as an example of a young lady overcoming misfortunes, with the help of others, maintaining her modesty and respectability, and becoming a useful member of society. As in <span class="italic">The Step-Mother</span>, it was argued that reading would strengthen rather than weaken the mind. Helena wrote that her style was realist, rather than romantic, and her work of observation rather than imagination. There is humour in the work, but also an underlying motive of focusing attention on the impoverished young lady who has to protect her virtue in the face of considerable adversity during a period of political tumult and war; she had herself to seek financial assistance from the Royal Literary Fund in 1801. She cited the example of Mary Wollstonecraft, regretting rather than totally condemning Wollstonecraft's radical moral and political beliefs. She argued that, had Wollstonecraft practised self-discipline, her literary work might have benefited society. Helena called on women to support each other and help such unfortunates earn a respectable living. She expressed concern that the established church was not alive to the dangers presented by the Roman Catholic church, which had established institutions to protect young ladies fallen on hard times. In addition, her novel, with its subtitle <span class="italic">The West Indian</span>, may be seen as part of the anti-slavery literature, with Constantia as the white colonial outsider in English society.<br>
<br>On 31 October 1801, described as resident at Warminster, Wiltshire, Helena Wells married Edward Whitford of Broad Street Buildings, and set up house in Salisbury Square, London. Following the birth of her fourth and last child, in 1806, Helena Whitford spent a long period of illness considering the plight of &#145;unportioned&#146; young ladies. In what appears to have been her last publication, <span class="italic">Thoughts and remarks on establishing an institution for the support and education of unportioned respectable females</span> (1809), she returned to the themes of women supporting each other and of the need for improved education for young ladies. She recalled the criticisms of the fashionable education in the social graces made by Hannah More (1745&#150;1833), and wrote of the precarious social as well as financial position of the governess, who often led a lonely, isolated life in contrast to the male tutor. Describing her own difficulties in hiring suitable staff for the school which she had established before her marriage, she pointed to the irony that the children of the lower orders received a more appropriate education (through charity schools, for example) than the daughters of the middle and upper classes. Thus she advocated the establishment in Yorkshire (with its cheap costs, clean air, and central location) of a type of protestant nunnery (though she had been forced to drop any reference to &#145;nunnery&#146; from her title because of its links with Roman Catholicism), which she envisaged as a national house of refuge for respectable females who needed help, either to equip them for a teaching career or to shelter them in old age. While dismissing any demands for the rights of women, she was acutely aware of the precarious position of the spinster, perhaps because she married late in life. Helena Whitford died at her home in Mapledon Place, Burton Crescent, London, on 6 July 1824. Her husband survived her. Her eldest son, Robert Wells Whitford (1804&#150;1879), educated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, which was much favoured by evangelical parents, became a chaplain in India.<br>
