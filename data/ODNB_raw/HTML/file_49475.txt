<span class="headword">Murray,  Thomas Blackwood</span>  (1871&#150;1929), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born at Heaviside, Biggar, Lanarkshire, on 22 April 1871, the son of John Lamb Murray and his wife, Jane, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Findlay. His father was an autodidact architect and engineer who acted as factor to estates in the area, and whose interests included designing and installing electric generation and water-power plant. The young boy revelled in his father's engineering pursuits and became skilled at repairing clocks. After being sent to George Watson's College in Edinburgh, he graduated with a BSc in engineering from the University of Edinburgh in 1890. In the year of his graduation he patented a water turbine speed governor that was to be widely adopted. He went on to serve time with King Brown &amp; Co. of Edinburgh and then with Rankin, Kennedy &amp; Co. of Glasgow before briefly joining his father as a consultant engineer. After visiting a German engineering works he joined Mavor and Coulson in Glasgow, pioneers in electrical engineering, where he met the engineer George Johnston.<br>
<br>In 1895 Murray collaborated with Johnston and <a href="#cosubject_105611">Norman Osborne Fulton [<i>see below</i>]</a> to design and build motor cars in a workshop at Johnston's father's manse, at Mosesfield. The three formed the Mo-Car syndicate in 1896 to build the motorized dog carts, and also designed improvements in tramcars.<br>
<br>Murray and Fulton considered Johnston to be an ineffective businessman, and in 1899 established their own company, the Albion Motor Car Company, with financial backing from Murray's father and works in the former Clan Line repair shop in Finnieston Street, Glasgow. On 5 December 1900, at St Andrews, Fife, Murray married Henrietta Wilhemena, daughter of William Rusack, hotel keeper; her family owned Rusack's Hotel in St Andrews. They had at least three sons and one daughter. Following Johnston's example and no doubt to his annoyance the Albion Company began building dog carts. By 1902 they had built almost sixty 8 and 10 horsepower cars. In that year Albion moved to a purpose-built factory in Scotstoun and lorries were added to the product range. The partnership was converted into a limited company with an injection of new capital from James Francis Henderson (1875&#150;1941), who had a degree in engineering from the University of Glasgow. Henderson was an experienced electrical engineer which he put to good effect in devising new starter motors for Albion engines. He became joint managing director with Fulton, while Murray acted as chairman.<br>
<br>The Albion Motor Car Company went from strength to strength, winning medals at international exhibitions and building an extensive export market. Recognizing that it was impossible to compete with the larger car manufacturers in England, from 1913 the company concentrated solely on building lorries. This was a providential decision. During the First World War 6000 Albion 3-ton lorries were supplied to the Ministry of Munitions, probably more than by any other supplier. Vickers, the armaments manufacturers, selected Albion as their preferred supplier of vehicles during the conflict. Despite the onset of tuberculosis, Murray visited France several times during the war to see his lorries in service. The firm also delivered over 60,000 shells. Murray designed a lubricator for the Dragonfly aero-engine that was being produced by William Beardmore &amp; Co. and his own Chorlton-Murray-Albion aero-engine. He gained a DSc degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1917 and was a member of the institutes of civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering. In 1919&#150;20 he was president of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland.<br>
<br>Ill health forced Murray to seek a gentler climate and after the war he purchased an estate at Conford Park, Liphook, in Hampshire, leaving Fulton and Henderson in day-to-day charge of the works, though he remained as chairman until his death. After the war Albion could claim to have supplied more vans than any other manufacturer and advertised their hydraulic tipping lorries as being ideal for reconstruction work. The company also began building charabancs to take advantage of the fast growing demand for buses and promoted their vehicles heavily in the press. Albion weathered the post-war recession well, expanding the market for its products both in the United Kingdom and overseas and regularly introducing new models. By the mid-1920s all of its public service vehicles were equipped with pneumatic tyres. Murray was an evangelical in religion and a prominent Freemason, serving as the youngest master mason in Scotland. He died at Monthey, Switzerland, on 11 June 1929 and was buried at Biggar.<br>
<br>Murray's partner in the Albion Motor Car Company, <a name="cosubject_105611"></a><span class="headword">Norman Osborne Fulton</span>  (1872&#150;1935), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born at 1 Grafton Square, Glasgow, on 3 June 1872, the son of Hugh Fulton, a wholesale provision merchant in Glasgow, and his wife, Catherine, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilson. The motor car maker George Johnston was his cousin. After schooling at Allan Glens's Institution, Glasgow, he served an engineering apprenticeship with Kesson and Campbell of Shettleston, manufacturers of pithead machinery. He went on to take jobs with four different west of Scotland engineering firms before joining Murray and Johnston in the Mo-Car syndicate.<br>
<br>After leaving the syndicate Fulton went to the United States on what was in effect an industrial espionage mission. He worked for a year in two automobile factories, sending back a stream of technical reports, before returning to join Murray in the Albion Motor Company in 1899. At Biggar, on 6 July 1904, he married Murray's sister, Margaret Anne Murray.<br>
<br>During Murray's increasing absences from the Albion Company works at Scotstoun, Fulton oversaw the production side of the business. In 1915 the Clyde workers' committee called a strike over the question of the dilution of skilled labour and targeted Beardmores and Albion, where one of their leaders, Willie Gallacher, was an employee. There was further industrial action in 1919 and 1922. Unlike Murray, Fulton was no autocrat and set up an employees' benevolent fund. As an evangelical churchman he was involved in charitable and social work. He succeeded Murray as chairman, a position he held until his death. Fulton died at his home, St Edmunds, Milngavie, Dunbartonshire, on 27 July 1935. He was survived by his wife and two sons. Fulton and Murray possessed business acumen, and access to capital, that their former partner Johnston lacked, and both died wealthy men.<br>
