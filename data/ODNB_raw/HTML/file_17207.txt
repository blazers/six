<span class="headword">Luscombe,  Matthew Henry Thornhill</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1775, <em>d.</em> 1846), <span class="occ">missionary bishop</span>, baptized on 16 April 1775 at St Paul's, Exeter, was the son of Samuel Luscombe, physician at Exeter, and his wife, Jane a collateral descendant of Sir James Thornhill. He was educated at Exeter grammar school and admitted pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge, on 22 May 1793. He migrated to St Catharine's, Cambridge, on 27 December 1793, where he graduated BA 1798 and MA 1805. He was ordained to the curacy of Clewer, Windsor. From 1806 to 1819 he was master of the East India Company's school at Haileybury, Hertford, and held the curacy of St Andrew's in that town. Walter Farquhar Hook was one of his pupils at Hertford, and became a close friend. On 20 January 1810 he was incorporated MA of Oxford University, joining Exeter College, and proceeding BCL and DCL in February 1810.<br>
<br>In 1819 Luscombe moved to Caen, and subsequently to Paris. In 1824 George Canning looked to appoint Luscombe embassy chaplain at Paris, and, in recognition of the need for supervision of Anglicans overseas, general superintendent of the English congregations on the continent. However, he soon afterwards agreed to a proposal made originally by Luscombe's former pupil Hook, that the bishops of the Scottish Episcopal church should consecrate Luscombe to a continental bishopric, with the status of a missionary bishop, giving him jurisdiction over people rather than territory. On 20 March 1825 Luscombe was consecrated at Stirling by Bishop Jolly of Moray. Hook attended as chaplain to preach the sermon on the Catholicism of the Anglican church. In the course of the same year Luscombe assumed the office of chaplain at Paris. In lieu of the room at the embassy or the French protestant Oratoire in which the services had been held, he erected in 1834, and partly paid for, a church in the rue d'Aguesseau. He officiated at Thackeray's marriage in Paris in 1836. Luscombe met immediate difficulties arising from the lack of clarity regarding his authority, and the extent to which he had government backing. One congregation at Boulogne refused to recognize his authority, and there were complaints that he was attempting to exercise jurisdiction rather than influence over the clergy in Belgium. Luscombe's right to ordain was questioned, and in 1840 was restricted to confirmation, thus calling into question the status of clergy he had previously ordained.<br>
<br>Luscombe married the only daughter of Henry Harmood, commissioner of the navy. They had a son, Henry, who died in 1833, and two daughters, Susan and Frances. Luscombe held high-church principles. He was one of the founders in 1841 of the <span class="italic">Christian Remembrancer</span>. He also published sermons and <span class="italic">The Church of Rome compared with the Bible, the fathers of the church, and the Church of England</span> (1839). He dedicated an anonymously published poem &#145;Pleasures of Society&#146; to Canning. Luscombe also interested himself in fine arts, both as a collector and as an artist.<br>
<br>Luscombe died suddenly of heart disease at Lausanne on 24 August 1846, and was buried at La Sallaz cemetery. No attempt was made to appoint a successor as missionary bishop. He left a bequest for divinity scholarships at Glenalmond College, Perthshire.<br>
