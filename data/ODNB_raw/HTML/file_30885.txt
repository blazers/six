<span class="headword">Butler,  Reginald Cotterell</span>  (1913&#150;1981), <span class="occ">sculptor</span>, was born on 28 April 1913 at Buntingford, Hertfordshire, the only child of Frederick William Butler and his wife, Edith Barltrop, the master and matron of the Buntingford workhouse. His father was a distant relative of the Irish poet William Butler Yeats, and his grandfather had been a gardener at Chatsworth under Sir Joseph Paxton. His mother was of Anglo-French extraction and a distant relative of the poet George Crabbe. From the age of fourteen he was educated at the Hertford grammar school. He learned a great deal about the crafts and handling of tools in his father's Buntingford community.<br>
<br>Reg Butler (as he preferred to be known) entered architectural practice locally in 1933 and was sufficiently successful to be elected ARIBA in 1937. He was a lecturer in architecture at the Architectural Association School (1937&#150;9), and continued with architectural journalism throughout the war and until 1951. In 1938 he married (Mary) Joan (Jo), daughter of Robert Child, a farmer; they had no children. With his friend Rosemary, a sculptor, daughter of Matthew Young, doctor of medicine, he had two daughters. During the Second World War, as a conscientious objector, he worked as a blacksmith in Sussex. He was interested in sculpture from 1937 onwards, initially being influenced by African primitive art and the work of Henry Moore. His first one-man show was at the Hanover Gallery, London, in 1949. He was awarded the first Gregory fellowship in sculpture at the University of Leeds (1951&#150;3), and in 1951 also became a lecturer at the Slade School of Fine Art, London, eventually becoming head of the department, a post he held until 1980. The Arts Council of Great Britain and the Greater London council commissioned work from him for the Festival of Britain in 1951. In 1952 the British Council invited him to take part in an exhibition at the British pavilion at the Venice Biennale.<br>
<br>Butler was awarded the <i>grand prix</i> in an international competition for an intended monument, entitled &#145;The Unknown Political Prisoner&#146;, in 1953, for a sculpture to be placed on the Russian&#150;German frontier in Berlin. The sculpture was never built and the maquette was destroyed by a Hungarian refugee when it was exhibited at the Tate Gallery in London. Butler was able to make a second small model.<br>
<br>Butler's earlier work shows an acute awareness of trends in Britain and Europe after the war and has close affinities to sources as diverse as Henry Moore, Graham Sutherland, and Francis Bacon, as well as to Picasso, Julio Gonz&aacute;lez, Germaine Richier, Alberto Giacometti, and at a later stage, Balthus and Hans Bellmer. This suggests a certain eclecticism in his nature, but it is fair to say that he was equal to the sources of his inspiration, and at times excelled them. He enjoyed argument and was a stimulating and respected teacher. He loved fast cars and was excited by modern technology and by science fiction. He was one of a number of sculptors working with forged and welded metals in the 1950s. Critics tended to find the work harsh and threatening, reflecting a mood of post-war anxiety which Sir Herbert Read summed up as &#145;the Geometry of Fear&#146;.<br>
<br>In the mid-1950s Butler's work turned from spiky biomorphic metaphors towards a more realist concern with the female figure. Increasingly its erotic nature suggested that the sculptor was searching to invent a series of modern Venuses. In his William Townshend lecture at University College, London, in November 1980, Butler talked at length about his admiration of Stone Age fertility figures. His own last series of doll-like figures, owing something to Indian and Japanese inspiration, seemed to relate twentieth-century sexual fantasies to an ancient tradition. The bronze casts were painted with a sugar-almond surface and were not unlike the treatment of female flesh in the paintings of Lucas Cranach. Heads and limbs were made in interchangeable units, the eyes were made of painted resin and covered with a glassy lens, and human hair was implanted in the skulls, but not in the pubic areas. His creations, combining both lust and compassion, achieved the potency of their primitive ancestors.<br>
<br>Butler continued to be a prominent and controversial figure whose work was admired throughout Europe and in the United States. He is represented in the Tate collection, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, as well as in many other museums. In 1965 he was elected to the Royal Academy of Belgium. A posthumous memorial exhibition took place at the Tate Gallery in November 1983. Reg Butler died on 23 October 1981 at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, where he had lived since 1953.<br>
