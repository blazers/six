<span class="headword">Turner, Sir  (Ronald) Mark Cunliffe</span>  (1906&#150;1980), <span class="occ">merchant banker</span>, was born on 29 March 1906 at 41 Cheyne Court, Chelsea, the only son and younger child of Christopher Rede Turner (1877&#150;1967), clerk in the House of Commons, and his wife, Jill Helen, daughter of Harry Pickersgill Cunliffe (1858&#150;1919), of Staughton Manor, Huntingdonshire. He was grandson of Major-General Sir Alfred Turner (1842&#150;1918), military policeman, alpinist, polyglot, and chairman of the North Borneo State Rubber Company. After schooling at Wellington College, Mark Turner at the age of eighteen became a messenger at the merchant bank of M. Samuel in 1924. He came to specialize in corporate finance, but after the rejection of his proposals for the bank to fund capital-starved businesses with good growth prospects he transferred in 1934 to the smaller merchant banking house of Robert Benson &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Bensons had recently formed the Kenterne Trust to operate in the new issues business. Turner's energy and ingenuity in ensuring successful share issues in textiles, steel, paper, and catering propelled Bensons to a higher ranking among City merchant banks. Turner was firm, tactful, and decisive, with superb powers of assimilation and analysis enabling him to form clear views and reliable recommendations on diverse business propositions. Both then and in later life he worked intensely hard and marshalled his time and energy with remarkable effectiveness. He had much charm, and an eager smile. When young he was active in the Peckham Health Centre, a pioneering institution promoting family health, and he maintained progressive sympathies throughout his life.<br>
<br>In 1931 Turner married Elizabeth Mary (<i>b</i>. 1910), daughter of Major-General Hugh Clement Sutton, and granddaughter of Charles Lindley Wood, second Viscount Halifax. They had one daughter. This marriage was dissolved in 1936 and in 1939 he married Margaret (1913&#150;1997), daughter of Major-General Sir Hereward Wake, thirteenth baronet, and granddaughter of the founder of Robert Benson. &#145;Peggy&#146; Turner was a delightful woman, with an attractively deep voice, a slightly scatterbrained manner, a wry, shrewd humour, and an infectious capacity for enjoyment. They had three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>Between 1939 and 1944 Turner was an official at the Ministry of Economic Warfare. He was responsible for devising and operating a blockade of petroleum oil supplies to Spain in 1940&#150;42. This deterred the Spanish from joining the axis powers, and turned Generalissimo Franco's regime from a stance of non-belligerency in 1940 to neutrality by 1942. He also advised on the destruction of Romanian oilfields and on oil policy generally. Turner was recruited to the Foreign Office in 1944 as head of a new department charged with preparing the post-war allied administration of Germany and Austria. At the request of Ernest Bevin he postponed his return to banking, and served in 1945&#150;7 as under-secretary for economic affairs at the Control Office for Germany and Austria. He was knighted in 1946.<br>
<br>Turner resumed his banking career in 1947 and became joint managing director of the newly expanded Robert Benson, Lonsdale &amp; Co.; during the early 1950s he emerged as the leading figure in the bank. He instigated the merger of Robert Benson Lonsdale with the accepting house, Kleinwort, to form the highly successful merchant bank of Kleinwort Benson in 1961. He was a director of Kleinwort Benson from its formation until 1977, and acted as senior executive (1961&#150;71) and deputy chairman (1966&#150;71). As a merchant banker with great mental gifts his expertise was sought by many businesses. He joined the boards of such companies as Rio Tinto (1947), Commercial Union Assurance (1948), Calico Printers (1952), Tanganyika Concessions, Tunnel Portland Cement, Nuclear Developments, Transport Holdings (1962), Toronto-Dominion Bank (1963), Midland and International Banks (1966), National Cash Register (1968), Whitbread Investment (1969), Bank of America Limited (1971), and the Sotheby Park Bernet art auctioneers (1977). As one example of the facilitating role he filled as a non-executive director, Turner was still on the board of Commercial Union, and Kleinwort Benson was its financial adviser, when Commercial Union took over Northern and Employers in what was then the largest ever insurance merger (1968). Turner was also chairman of the Mercantile Credit Company (1957&#150;72) during a period of strategic reform and dynamic expansion; later he was chairman of British Home Stores (1968&#150;76).<br>
<br>The most important of Turner's outside interests was Rio Tinto. Acting as part-time managing director in 1948&#150;50, Turner laid the strategy which transformed a vulnerable business, with only a pyrites mine in Spain and investments in the Rhodesian copperbelt, into one of Britain's most powerful multinationals. He determined that the company must expand into metal mining in politically stable nations, and selected many key personnel to implement this strategy. His recruitment of J. N. V. Duncan, and their subsequent co-operation, was decisive in Rio Tinto's regeneration. Turner was crucial in its merger with the Zinc Corporation to form Rio Tinto Zinc (1961) and in raising large funds for mining development with little security other than long-term supply agreements. His diplomatic skills were valuable in negotiations with foreign governments. Following Duncan's sudden death Turner became chief executive (1975&#150;8) and chairman of RTZ from 1975 until his death. During this period he had to justify the company's plans to its environmentalist critics, and he was involved in other delicate issues: he pleaded the fifth amendment in litigation pursued by Westinghouse Electric, alleging an international uranium cartel (1977). Lord Charteris of Amisfield, who was Turner's co-director at RTZ, admired &#145;his imagination, his humour, his infectious sense of fun, his care for others and his determination always to hold to what was true&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 17 Dec 1980).<br>
<br>Although Tony Benn in 1975 claimed that Turner was an archetype &#145;of the international capitalist and British tory establishment&#146;  (Benn, 403), Turner had an active social sense and considerable moral courage. When he joined the Observer Trust in 1959, that reformist Sunday newspaper was still anathema in the City, owing to its opposition to the Anglo-French expedition at Suez in 1956. Friends and colleagues were angered by Turner's decision but, according to the editor of <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, David Astor, &#145;for the next seventeen years [Turner] supported the paper's position of independence with vigour, and devoted long, unremunerated hours to steering its financial course&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Observer</span>, 21 Dec 1980). Turner retired as trustee in 1976.<br>
<br>Turner had discriminating cultural tastes, and in 1944 was involved in negotiations with the Pilgrim Trust and the National Trust to secure the future of Audley End after Lord Braybrooke's death in action. Later he was a governor of Brunel University, and a trustee of the Glyndebourne Arts Trust. He died of abdominal cancer on 13 December 1980 at his home, 3 The Grove, Highgate, London, survived by his second wife, who died on 21 April 1997.<br>
