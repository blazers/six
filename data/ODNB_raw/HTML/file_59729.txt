<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cooper,  Susan Vera <span class="st"> [Susie]</span></span>  (1902&#150;1995), <span class="occ">potter</span>, was born at Stansfield, near Burslem, Staffordshire, on 29 October 1902, the youngest of the seven children of John Cooper (<i>d</i>. 1914), JP, and his wife, Mary-Ann, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Adams. The year of her birth was that in which Arnold Bennett's <span class="italic">Anna of the Five Towns</span> was published; Susie Cooper, too, was to become a Potteries heroine&#151;one of the very few women to own, manage, and design for her own potworks. Comfortably off, her parents ran a farm and retail business. As a child, Susie Cooper could always be &#145;kept good&#146; with a drawing book. She attended a local school, then Mollart School, Hanley, a private establishment, which she left in 1917, to help with the family business. She also enrolled for evening classes in drawing at Burslem School of Art, and in 1919 won a scholarship for full-time training at the school, when she came under the influence of Gordon Forsyth, formerly an art director of leading pottery firms and from 1920 superintendent of art education in the district.<br>
<br>Through Forsyth Susie Cooper was taken on by Gray's Pottery, a decorating firm. Originally she had had ambitions to go to the Royal College of Art in London, but decided instead to make her career in the Potteries. In 1923, as a piece-worker, she helped decorate Forsyth's range of &#145;Gloria Lustre&#146; wares, which were exhibited on Gray's stand at the British Industries' Fair. Promoted to resident designer, she was given her own backstamp for use on wares&#151;Gray's miniature image of an ocean liner with the words &#145;Designed by Susie Cooper&#146;. Her patterns were shown at an industrial art exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, in 1923; at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924; and on Gray's stand in the British pavilion at the Paris &#145;Exposition &hellip; des Arts D&eacute;coratifs&#146; of 1925 which was to give its name to art deco.<br>
<br>By the late 1920s Cooper was designing brilliantly enamelled cubist patterns not unlike those of her near-contemporary, the ceramics designer Clarice Cliff. But, dissatisfied with the way large areas of paint tended to flake, Cooper designed the &#145;banded&#146; wares which were to be among her specialities. As a sideline she designed screen curtains for the neo-baroque Odeon, Marble Arch, London&#151;a falling leaf pattern in gold, commissioned by the London interior design company Skelhorn and Edwards.<br>
<br>On her twenty-seventh birthday, Cooper left Gray's Pottery to set up on her own, with &pound;4000 raised from her family. It was an unpropitious time to be starting any new business. The first premises she rented in Tunstall closed down after three months when the landlord went bankrupt after the Wall Street crash. Cooper next rented a Burslem works from Doulton &amp; Co. and gathered a workforce of ten paintresses. In April 1930 she took her first advertisement in the <span class="italic">Pottery Gazette</span>, offering &#145;Elegance with Utility&#146;. Her first independent pattern was &#145;Bronze chrysanthemums&#146;. Her stand at the 1931 British Industries' Fair was very successful. By then she was decorating blank wares from Harry Wood; she moved into his Crown Works in Burslem which were to be her headquarters for almost half a century.<br>
<br>In 1932 Cooper's most familiar backstamp of a leaping deer was introduced&#151;a quintessential art deco motif which remained in use until the mid-1960s. The streamlined &#145;Kestrel&#146; shape was shown at the British Industries' Fair, where Queen Mary bought a breakfast-in-bed set from her and the princess royal purchased a triangular lamp decorated with clowns. By March 1933 Cooper had become prominent enough to be interviewed by the <span class="italic">Manchester Evening News</span>. The article noted that she was already exporting to Norway and South Africa: exports were always an important aspect of the firm's output. What also emerged clearly from the interview was Cooper's concern to train and look after the girls on the shop floor. That month she also patented a &#145;Kestrel&#146; tureen with a lid that doubled as a serving plate. Just before the 1933 British Industries' Fair opened, the John Lewis store in London placed a substantial order for wares from her, the beginning of a happy relationship.<br>
<br>In 1934 Cooper began using the technique of tube lining: slip (liquid clay) was squeezed out of a bag on to the ware in the manner of icing. She also designed wall masks, including one of Greta Garbo and one of herself, though the latter was never put on sale.<br>
<br>Contemporary photographs record Cooper's striking, almost film-star looks. In 1934 she also introduced her popular polka-dot pattern and crayon designs. In 1935 she was invited to exhibit at the Royal Academy's &#145;Art in Industry&#146; show. She introduced lithographic patterns, admired by the art historian Nikolaus Pevsner in an article of 1936. Cooper was never a purist, and always had a feeling for popular taste. About 1935 she had designed her very popular, if somewhat schmaltzy, &#145;Dresden spray&#146; pattern, which lasted until the late 1950s. Distinct from this canny commercialism was a terracotta figure she made called <span class="italic">Lummox</span>&#151;a suffering woman with bowed head, inspired by a book by the American writer Fanny Hurst. Also in 1937 the Burslem Pottery, of which she had become a director in 1933, was renamed the Susie Cooper Pottery Ltd. She introduced her streamlined &#145;Falcon&#146; shapes, with aerographing (spraying on colour) and <i>sgraffito</i> (scratching designs through the glaze). On 28 April 1938 she married the architect Cecil Barker (1908/9&#150;1972), with whom she had a son, Timothy, in 1943. He became a boat-builder, incorporating a Susie Cooper ceramic plaque in one boat. &#145;We both make vessels&#146;, she remarked.<br>
<br>By the late 1930s Susie Cooper's firm was one of the success stories of British industry. Imperial Airways were using her wares on their London&#150;Paris flights. She was commissioned to make services for the experimental Peckham health centre and for Peter Jones's restaurant in Chelsea, both in dramatically modern buildings. In 1939 she was made a royal designer for industry. In spite of wartime restrictions, new patterns were introduced, including &#145;Black leaves&#146; and &#145;Tigerlily&#146;. But in 1942 a serious fire caused a close-down at her pottery until the end of the war.<br>
<br>Cooper was on the selection committee for the &#145;Britain can make it&#146; exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, in 1946 and exhibited wares herself. In the 1950s she expanded into porcelain, buying the Jason China Company, Longton. A &#145;Quail&#146; shape was designed for the royal pavilion at the 1951 Festival of Britain. By 1952 her workforce had risen to 250. In the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span> of 27 March 1954, an American buyer was quoted as saying that: &#145;Britain is losing the design battle. Except for Susie Cooper you haven't a designer who can keep up with modern American styles.&#146; In that year she designed a plaque to mark the bicentenary of the founding of the Royal Society of Arts. From 1956, responding as usual to changes in taste, Cooper introduced neo-classical patterns and a fluted shape. In 1957 a second bad fire caused a hiatus in production. Her husband resigned from his architectural firm and worked for her business full-time. In 1958 she designed the ultra-simple &#145;can&#146; shape, a harbinger of the less whimsical styles of the 1960s. She bought the Crown Works in 1959. Gradually earthenware was phased out and the switch to bone china was complete by 1964.<br>
<br>In 1966 Cooper's firm was taken over by Wedgwood but she continued as a designer in the division of Susie Cooper Ltd, responding to the &#145;swinging sixties&#146; with such vibrant patterns as &#145;Carnaby Daisy&#146; and &#145;Harlequinade&#146;. But she found that Wedgwood &#145;wouldn't take risks&#146;. In her view too much attention was paid to the salesmen's view of what would sell and what wouldn't. She felt keenly the loss of control and the cramping of her freedom to design whatever she chose. Her husband died in 1972 aged sixty-three, and she resigned as director of Susie Cooper Ltd.<br>
<br>However, Cooper was asked to design lustre ware to celebrate the queen's silver jubilee in 1977; and in 1978 Wedgwood held a Susie Cooper retrospective exhibition at Sanderson's Exhibition Gallery, London, entitled &#145;Elegance and utility&#146;. In 1978 she was appointed OBE for services to British industry. In 1980 Wedgwood, to her distress, closed the Crown Works, whereupon she moved to William Adams of Tunstall, part of the Wedgwood group. In 1982 her eightieth birthday was marked by a celebratory show at the Stoke-on-Trent Museum and Art Gallery. With the growing interest in art deco, she had become a cult figure among collectors, and a Susie Cooper collectors' group with its own newsletter was formed. Because she had made so much, in so many styles, and all of it marked, her work was an ideal collector's quarry.<br>
<br>In 1985 Cooper was saluted, with Clarice Cliff and the slightly earlier potter Charlotte Rhead, in a Channel 4 television series, <span class="italic">Pottery Ladies</span>. The following year she and her son left the Potteries to live on the Isle of Man. Interest in her work was unabated. In 1987 the Victoria and Albert Museum organized a travelling exhibition of &#145;Susie Cooper productions&#146; and, to accompany it, Wedgwood revived three of her 1930s patterns. She received an honorary doctorate from the Royal College of Art.<br>
<br>Cooper began a new and eccentric art form, &#145;seed paintings&#146;, a sort of recycling of nature into art. An exhibition of her work in this curious medium was held at the Stoke-on-Trent museum in 1990. To celebrate her ninetieth birthday in 1992, Wedgwood staged a show at their visitors' centre, Barlaston, and she produced a limited edition of ninety of a porcelain model of a leaping deer. She died at Douglas, Isle of Man, on 28 July 1995. Her work, covering seven decades, mirrored and to some extent influenced the changing styles of twentieth-century decorative art. A key figure in both art deco and the 1950s &#145;contemporary&#146; style, she designed some 4500 patterns and 500 new shapes. Examples of her work can be seen at the Wedgwood Museum, Barlaston, Staffordshire, in the Victoria and Albert Museum, and at the Design Museum, London.<br>
