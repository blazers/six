<span class="headword">Wilkins,  George</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1618), <span class="occ">playwright and pamphleteer</span>, was the son of George Wilkins, identified at his death in 1603 as &#145;George Wilkins the Poet&#146;. Together with his father he may have written the two sonnets signed &#145;G. W. Senior&#146; and &#145;G. W. I.&#146; (Junior) that preface the volume of Spenser's <span class="italic">Amoretti</span> published in 1595. The evidence suggests that he was an ambitious and, for a time, well-connected writer who none the less failed to make a prosperous living at his craft. He published all his known work in a brief period of intense activity between 1606 and 1608, but was probably writing for a decade before that. By 1610 he had set up as an innkeeper in the seedy district of St Sepulchre's in London.<br>
<br>Of Wilkins's early life nothing is known. He was probably the George Wilkins who married Katherine Fowler at St Lawrence Jewry on 13 February 1602, and the union produced a son, Thomas, baptized at St Giles Cripplegate on 11 February 1605. Wilkins regarded himself as a man of education, and projects himself more than once in his writings in the stock image of the poor and unregarded scholar, but he is not known to have attended a university. His first known published work was a translation of a Roman chronicle, <span class="italic">The History of Justine</span> (1606), in which he extensively plagiarized an earlier translation by Arthur Golding. He then moved downmarket to collaborate with Thomas Dekker on the pamphlet <span class="italic">Jests to Make you Merrie</span>, published in 1607. By this time Wilkins was also active as a freelance writer for the stage. <span class="italic">The Miseries of Enforced Marriage</span>, his only known unaided play, was first acted by the King's Men probably in the middle of 1607, since on publication in the late summer of that year (having been registered in July) it was described on the title-page as a current production. Also entered on the Stationers' register that summer was <span class="italic">The Travels of the Three English Brothers</span>, on which Wilkins worked with John Day and William Rowley. It was performed by the Queen's Men at the Red Bull in Clerkenwell, and described on its title-page &#145;As it is now played&#146;.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Miseries of Enforced Marriage</span> is based on the sensational story of Walter Calverley, which also provided the plot of another and better-known King's Men play, <span class="italic">The Yorkshire Tragedy</span>. Wilkins's play was a popular one, and new editions were published in 1611, 1629, and 1637. He probably also collaborated with John Day in the writing of the play <span class="italic">Law Tricks</span> in 1608. But his chief claim to modern fame rests on his association with Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Pericles</span>. Scholarship has confirmed Wilkins's authorship of the first nine scenes of the play, and has constructed a plausible narrative from initial collaboration to its first publication in 1609. Following the success of <span class="italic">Miseries</span>, Wilkins was employed by the King's Men to work on the new play, which was either a collaborative project from the outset, or one that Shakespeare took over after Wilkins had roughed out a plot and written the opening scenes. The subject matter could be described as a new departure for either writer, though its peripatetic theme recalls <span class="italic">The Travels of the Three English Brothers</span>, which dramatizes the wanderings of the Sherley brothers; and the two plays may be connected also by their popularity with Catholic private audiences. <span class="italic">Travels</span> and <span class="italic">Pericles</span> were both in the repertory of Cholmeley's Players, a Yorkshire-based company of recusant players, who performed them on tour in the homes of Catholic families in 1608&#150;10. It is quite possible that Wilkins himself was a recusant: Roger Prior suggests that he may have been the &#145;George Wilkinson&#146; who was convicted of not going to church in 1608, though firm evidence of his religious affiliations is lacking. Wilkins's pamphlet <span class="italic">Three Miseries of Barbary</span> (probably published in 1607) may have owed some of its information to Sir Anthony Sherley, who was in north Africa in 1605&#150;6 and was by then a formal convert to Rome.<br>
<br>The latter pamphlet was published by Henry Gosson, who also brought out the first edition of <span class="italic">Pericles</span> in 1609. The defects of this edition are generally thought to be the result of its being a memorial text, unauthorized by the company and surreptitiously reported by one or more of its actors. Wilkins may have been the means by which Gosson obtained the copy for his edition (though Gosson does not credit Wilkins on the title-page, perhaps because ascribing the play solely to Shakespeare would improve sales). The publisher had secured a lucrative title, for <span class="italic">Pericles</span> was a very popular play, holding the stage into the 1620s; and this could explain why Gosson was later prepared to stand bail for Wilkins on an assault charge in 1611.<br>
<br>Wilkins had already found another way to capitalize on the play's success when in 1608 he published a prose romance, <span class="italic">The Painful Adventures of Pericles Prince of Tyre</span>. This explicitly claims to be based on the play, and has a good deal in common with it; but all the signs are that Wilkins was working from memory rather than from a manuscript&#151;as junior collaborator he would probably not own a copy of the playtext, which was the sole property of the King's Men. <span class="italic">Pericles</span> was officially registered for publication by Edward Blount in 1608, but no book under his imprint emerged, and the entry may have been designed to block Wilkins or others from publishing without the company's consent. It is notable that, despite having created two major successes for the King's Men in 1607&#150;8, Wilkins's connection with them was severed after the publication of <span class="italic">Pericles</span>, and as far as is known he did no further work for the stage.<br>
<br>The King's Men may have had other reasons to distrust George Wilkins. Records show that he was in trouble with the law as early as 1602, and he was regularly in court from 1610 until the end of his life. His later belligerence was probably aggravated by disappointment at the termination of his writing career, as he struggled to make a living as a victualler in an insalubrious urban quarter&#151;the area around Cow Cross and Turnmill Street, notorious for thieves and prostitutes. But it is likely that Wilkins was always a difficult and untrustworthy character. The case in which he was bailed by Henry Gosson was one in which he was accused of &#145;abusing one Randall Borkes and kicking a woman on the belly which was then great with child&#146;  (Prior, &#145;Life of George Wilkins&#146;, 144), and this was not the only time he was arraigned for violence against women. In 1611 Wilkins was arrested for helping a prostitute suspected of theft to escape justice, and after his release on bail was accused of abusing a constable in the execution of his office. The tangled story that emerges from the court records prompts the suspicion that Wilkins's tavern also operated as a brothel. In another case in 1614 involving his wife, a witness testified that Wilkins's house was frequented by lewd women. This is supported by a later misfortune that befell Wilkins: in 1616 he was in court to testify against a group of rioters who had pulled down &#145;a great part&#146; of his house&#151;almost certainly an example of the action habitually directed against theatres and brothels.<br>
<br>In 1612, as a result of his misdemeanours, Wilkins temporarily lost his licence to operate as a victualler. During the next two years he avoided further charges, though he himself was the object of assault. Having regained his licence, however, he was once more in trouble in 1616, when he was fined for assaulting one John Parker and stealing his hat and cloak. The final chapter of his life, like several earlier ones, is written in court records. In 1618 he was accused of harbouring a felon and, having been bailed, was recorded as discharged on 2 October &#145;because he is dead&#146;. His death must have taken place after the sessions on 3 September, when his case was postponed. Wilkins died intestate, and his estate was awarded to his widow on 14 October.<br>
