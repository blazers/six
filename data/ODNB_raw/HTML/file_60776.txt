<span class="headword">Shoosmith,  Arthur Gordon</span>  (1888&#150;1974), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born in St Petersburg on 30 June 1888, one of the five sons of Henry Shoosmith (<i>d</i>. 1918), entrepreneur, then resident there, and his wife, Alice Southern. Shoosmith was brought up in Russia and Finland before being sent to Latymer School and then to Haileybury College after winning a scholarship. In 1906 he was articled to C. Smith &amp; Son, architects, in Reading, and attended evening classes at University College, Reading. After 1909 he worked as an assistant to M. S. Ward, Ralph Knott and E. Stone Collins, R. Frank Atkinson, and H. S. Goodhart-Rendel in succession while attending evening classes first at the Architectural Association School of Architecture and after 1911 at the Royal Academy Schools. There he became friends with Cyril Farey (1888&#150;1954) and Alick Horsnell (1882/3&#150;1916), both brilliant draughtsmen; he also knew J. W. Whitelaw (1886&#150;1913), about whom he later wrote a memoir for the memorial book published after his accidental death. Shoosmith was unfit for active service in the First World War but his knowledge of Russian and German was used by the intelligence corps in prisoner-of-war camps in Scotland.<br>
<br>Shoosmith returned to Goodhart-Rendel's office in 1919 and then worked for Sir John Burnet. In 1920 he won the Soane medallion and travelled in Italy. In that same year he was recommended to Sir Edwin Lutyens by the Royal Institute of British Architects to succeed John Greaves as his permanent representative in New Delhi. Shoosmith's task was to supervise the construction of Viceroy's House, and in the opinion of Henry Alexander Nesbitt Medd (1892&#150;1977)&#151;his opposite number in Herbert Baker's office and later the last chief architect to the government of India&#151;&#145;its success was in no small measure due to his meticulous insistence on the highest standards of workmanship in his interpretation of the drawings sent out from London&#146;  (note in photo album III, Medd papers, department of south Asian studies, University of Cambridge). Shoosmith greatly admired Lutyens's achievement in New Delhi in which, he argued, &#145;East and West so blend their music that one is unaware of difference of origin. The effect is of something astonishingly original, and yet nowhere is there a wilful departure from sanctified tradition&#146;  (&#145;The design of New Delhi&#146;, <span class="italic">Indian State Railways Magazine</span>, 4/5, Feb 1931, 428).<br>
<br>Shoosmith was responsible for two buildings in Delhi on his own account. The Lady Hardinge Serai (1930&#150;31) was a rest house for travellers and their beasts of burden which owed much to Lutyens's stylistic synthesis. As he came only second in both of the competitions held in 1927 for the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches in New Delhi, both won by Medd, Shoosmith was recommended by Lutyens as architect for the new military church to be built in the cantonments to the west of the city. Built in 1928&#150;30, this was his masterpiece. Lutyens encouraged him in using simple brickwork: &#145;My dear Shoo, Bricks! &hellip; The Romans did it! Why should not Britons? You will get a fine wall, and their mass, proportion, with precious fenestration, will do the rest&#146;  (letter of 28 Feb 1928, Hussey, 493). Shoosmith's massive brick walls step back to enclose the interior volumes, creating an austere and sublime mass which echoed both the monuments of the ancient world and modern industrial structures; although exotic, however, the result was recognizably a Christian church. Contemporaries were deeply impressed; &#145;It is <i>superb</i>&#146;, wrote Robert Byron  (postcard to Shoosmith, 4 May 1931, formerly in possession of Mrs Shoosmith), while Christopher Hussey argued that this &#145;Elemental&#146; conception<blockquote>has very definite style, appropriate both to the climate and the building's purpose. Had this church been the work of a French or German architect, Europe would be flabbergasted by the magnificently simple and direct design. But since it is the work of an Englishman, it will probably never be heard of abroad. (<span class="italic">Country Life</span>, 69, 9 May 1931, 582)</blockquote>The first baby baptized in St Martin's, in 1931, was Shoosmith's daughter and only child. In 1927, in Rangoon, he had married Marjorie Cartwright Reid (1894&#150;1996), the daughter of Herbert Cartwright Reid, military dock engineer; she had been brought up in Edinburgh and studied at the Edinburgh School of Art before travelling with her parents to India. Marjorie Shoosmith advised Lutyens on inscriptions used inside Viceroy's House and executed a portrait group in the style of a Mughal miniature depicting the architects presenting models of the government buildings to the viceroy, Lord Irwin (original now in possession of the earl of Halifax). Both Shoosmith and his wife became deeply interested in the culture of India.<br>
<br>Following the inauguration of New Delhi in 1931, Shoosmith was appointed OBE and returned home. With Britain in depression it was a difficult time to attempt to set up in private practice after so long an absence. Prospective commissions at home and elsewhere in the British empire all evaporated. A design for a viaduct on Western Avenue, London, made during a trial partnership with William Robert Davidge in 1937, remained unexecuted, and all Shoosmith managed to carry out were alterations to a factory in Smithfield. He was also depressed to observe that developments in Europe were undermining New Delhi as an influence in India, so that &#145;it is in danger of appearing as a splendid culmination to the old epoch instead of inaugurating a new&#146;  (&#145;Present-day architecture in India&#146;, <span class="italic">The Nineteenth Century and After</span>, 120, Feb 1938, 209). In 1942 he joined the Ministry of Works, and in the following year he became an inspector in the new Ministry of Town and Country Planning; his widow considered that &#145;though sadly frustrated in his creative urge to design buildings, he did find some outlet in writing about them, and influencing the decisions to preserve those of value to posterity&#146;  (private information). He retired in 1957 and died of bronchopneumonia at his home, Wade's Cottage, Slindon, Sussex, on 14 January 1974.<br>
<br>&#145;Shoosmith I used to meet at lunch at the A. A. (1939&#150;40) &hellip; [A] tired, gentle little man, quite nice to talk to but somehow crushed&#146;, recalled Sir John Summerson when discussing the several architects who had immersed themselves in India only to return to a Britain which did not care. &#145;All sad men &hellip; It all fits into the picture of latter-day India which Paul Scott's <span class="italic">Raj Quartet</span> gives us&#146;  (private information). Shoosmith nevertheless deserves to be remembered. He was responsible for only two buildings, but one of them is among the most remarkable churches of the twentieth century, for in the Delhi cantonments he displayed genius. Arthur Shoosmith may also be taken as representative of so many talented architects who devoted their careers to service far away in British India.<br>
