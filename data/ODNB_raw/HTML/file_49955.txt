<span class="headword">Perry,  Micajah</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1694, <em>d.</em> 1753), <span class="occ">merchant and politician</span>, was baptized on 30 April 1694 at St Katharine Cree in London, the son of Richard Perry, merchant of London, and his wife, Sarah, daughter of George Richards, likewise a merchant. His grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49953/', "Micaiah Perry")</script>, was one of the founders of the leading English firm in the tobacco-importing and North American trades between 1690 and 1720. His father, a partner in that concern, died in 1720, so that when Micaiah Perry died in 1721 this major house, with commitments all over the Atlantic trading world, passed into the hands of his two grandsons, Micajah, aged twenty-six, and his younger brother, Philip, aged eighteen. Having previously spent some time as a clerk in a Philadelphia merchant's counting-house, Micajah Perry was thus reasonably familiar with American business conditions and practices. On 19 September 1721 he married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1738), daughter of Richard Cocke, a prosperous London linen draper. They lived in St Mary Axe in the City and at a villa at Epsom. They had no children.<br>
<br>In Micaiah Perry's day, Perry and Lane used all the principal trading modes known in the Chesapeake trade. As a commission house, it conducted business for both planters and merchants in the colonies, but also traded on its own through stores and factors there. It avoided unnecessary shipping risks and delays by chartering limited space on many vessels. After taking over the firm (now known as Perry &amp; Co.), Micajah Perry simplified operations by eliminating stores and factors, by reducing correspondence with merchants, and by sending out a limited number of ships of his own rather than chartering partial freight on a larger number of vessels. Almost immediately his firm began to lose money on shipping, because, without the assistance of dependable agents in every river, his captains were detained for longer periods in the tobacco colonies looking for cargoes, and, even so, frequently returned without full freights. Moreover, the firm antagonized many of the larger planters on whom it was now particularly dependent by suing aggressively for sums owed with compound interest.<br>
<br>The time liberated by simplifying the operations of his firm came increasingly to be devoted by Perry to politics. This marked a sharp break with the practice of his father and grandfather who, though known whigs, had avoided any conspicuous involvement in national, municipal, or guild affairs&#151;except for membership in the lieutenancy commission (in charge of the militia trained bands). In 1719, however, Perry's sister Sarah married William Heysham the younger, MP, a London West Indies merchant. The Heyshams were a politically active whig family, three of whose members had since 1698 been members of parliament for Lancaster or London. The death of his brother-in-law in 1727 very probably encouraged Perry to attempt to lead the surviving Heysham interest in the City. Merchants like the Heyshams and Perrys gave much business to London dealers in export goods as well as to the port's numerous ship carpenters, chandlers, sailmakers, rope-works, and other maritime crafts and trades. The death of George I in June 1727 made it necessary to hold an election that year and the hitherto inactive Perry quickly became a liveryman and &#145;assistant&#146; of the Haberdashers' Company and announced his candidacy for parliament. He was able to stand as part of a pro-ministerial grouping when the aged alderman Sir Gilbert Heathcote withdrew as a candidate for London. Perry came in third (out of the four elected) in the poll of November 1727. This was quickly followed by his selection as master of the Haberdashers' Company in December and as alderman for Aldgate ward in February 1728.<br>
<br>In parliament Perry appears to have devoted most of his efforts to commercial and colonial questions. (He was also agent for Pennsylvania in the 1720s.) On many of these issues he could co-operate with the ministry, most noticeably in obtaining the 1732 act facilitating the collection of debts in the colonies&#151;a measure as strongly desired by merchants as loathed by colonists. On other issues he was impelled by feeling in the City to oppose the ministry, particularly on the question of Britain's reaction to the &#145;Spanish depredations&#146; in the West Indies. His total break with the ministry came over Walpole's 1733 <span class="roman">Tobacco Excise Bill</span>, intended to curb fraud in collecting customs on tobacco, the opposition to which he led both in the City and in the house. As one of the very few tobacco merchants in the house, his leading role in the debates was both necessary and effective.<br>
<br>Perry's success in stopping the <span class="roman">Excise Bill</span> was a costly victory. In the City he was a hero, triumphantly returned to parliament in the general election of 1734 and elected sheriff for 1734&#150;5 and lord mayor for 1738&#150;9. But his private affairs suffered, for his Virginia correspondents were offended both by the passage of the <span class="roman">Colonial Debts Act</span> and by the failure of the <span class="roman">Excise Bill</span>. (Consigning planters had hoped that it would mean lower commissions on their sales accounts.) Many there felt, too, that his political involvements meant that he was devoting too little time to his business, from which his brother, Philip, withdrew in 1739. The Treasury also harassed him with an exchequer suit to recover customs duties repaid to him on tobacco not properly exported. Perry found it necessary to reach some sort of political understanding with the ministry in order to effect a &#145;composition&#146; on the customs claim. This compromised him in the eyes of the ever more numerous ardently anti-Walpole City voters and helped secure his defeat in the parliamentary election of 1741. By that time both his business and his health were in ruins. Suffering from &#145;dropsy&#146;, he withdrew to Bath in 1743 and subsequently avoided bankruptcy only by turning over all his effects to his English creditors. He resigned his aldermanship on 25 November 1746 and received a pension of &pound;200 per annum from the court of aldermen. In his last years he was so &#145;utterly incapable of Transacting any Business whatsoever&#146; that the court of chancery had to appoint a guardian for him. He died intestate on 22 or 25 January 1753, either at East Greenwich in Kent, or at Epsom in Surrey.<br>
