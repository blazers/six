<span class="headword">Denham, Sir  James  Steuart, of Coltness and Westshield</span>, eighth baronet and fourth baronet  (1744&#150;1839), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born James Steuart on 7 August 1744 at Goodtrees, near Edinburgh, only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7478/', "Sir James Steuart of Coltness and Westshield, seventh and third baronet (1713&#150;1780)")</script>, political economist, and his wife, Lady Frances (1722&#150;1789), daughter of James Wemyss, fifth earl of Wemyss. A year after his birth James was left in the care of relatives on his father's political exile, but he later joined his parents in Angoul&ecirc;me, France. On the outbreak of war between Britain and France in 1755 the family removed itself from Paris, first to Flanders and then, in 1757, to T&uuml;bingen in W&uuml;rttemberg, where young James enrolled in the university. He studied there until 1761, when, through the good offices of the secretary at war, Lord Barrington, he was given a cornetcy in the 1st dragoons; he subsequently served with his regiment throughout the Westphalian campaign of 1762. On 13 January 1763 he purchased a captaincy in the 105th foot, went on half pay when his regiment was reduced a year later, and then spent two years travelling on the continent until the opportunity arose for him to purchase a troop in the 5th dragoons. Posted in consequence to Ireland, in 1769 he was appointed aide-de-camp to the lord lieutenant, Lord Townshend, and in 1772 he married Alicia (<i>d</i>. 1840), daughter of William Blacker of Carrick, co. Antrim. The same year he purchased a majority in the 13th dragoons and, in 1776, after a brief spell with the 1st Irish horse, returned to the 13th dragoons as lieutenant-colonel.<br>
<br>Steuart succeeded to his father's titles and the seat at Coltness, Lanarkshire, in 1780 and took the additional surname of Denham, which his father had adopted upon inheriting Westshield (also in Lanarkshire) four years earlier. Promoted brevet-colonel (1782), he entered parliament as member for Lanark county in 1784, a seat which he held for the next eighteen years. In 1788, while stationed in Dublin, he was entrusted with improving the training of the cavalry in Ireland; the changes which he introduced to its system of field movements was much commended by headquarters. However, neither this achievement nor the support that he gave to the Pitt administration in parliament sufficed to win him the colonelcy of a regiment of foot, something which he earnestly sought: he was given instead the colonelcy of the 12th dragoons (9 November 1791). In October 1793 he was promoted major-general, which had the effect of making him too senior to join the siege at Toulon, where he had previously been ordered. He was also disappointed when, in 1794, having been given command of the cavalry intended to accompany Lord Cornwallis's mission to the Prussian army, the enterprise was cancelled. That September he accepted Henry Dundas's offer of a post on the staff in Scotland with a brief to superintend the fencible cavalry.<br>
<br>In March 1798, as a newly promoted lieutenant-general, Steuart Denham arrived to take command of Ireland's southern district. Major-General John Moore found him to be suffering from a nervous complaint &#145;which &hellip; completely unfitted him for business&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 1.275). None the less, Steuart Denham persisted and, in the months before the outbreak of the Irish rising, pursued a conciliatory policy. During the Wexford rising he took credit to himself for his subordinate General Henry Johnson's victory at New Ross (5 June 1798). But within a fortnight he received an official reprimand from the commander-in-chief, General Lake, for failing&#151;until the order was repeated&#151;to send troops from Munster against Wexford from the west. In response Steuart Denham claimed that he had possessed discretionary powers to withhold the troops, and resigned from the Irish staff in protest a month later. He received no further employment.<br>
<br>Steuart Denham was promoted full general in 1803 and exchanged the colonelcy of the 12th dragoons for that of the 2nd dragoons on 12 January 1815. He was made a knight grand cross of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1830. Although never rich, Steuart Denham expended his fortune on hospitality and improvements to the neighbourhood, &#145;leaving to his latter days a pittance barely adequate for comfortable subsistence, and that, ere his death, his heritage had passed to strangers&#146;  (Dennistoun, 390). He died at Cheltenham on 12 August 1839; his baronetcies fell to a cousin.<br>
