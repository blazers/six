<span class="headword">Tallents,  William Edward</span>  (1780&#150;1837), <span class="occ">political agent and lawyer</span>, was born on 9 February 1780 and baptized at Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, on 31 August 1780, the youngest of the eight children (five sons and three daughters) of Philip Tallents (1741&#150;1789), attorney, and Elizabeth Webster (1740&#150;1827). He was articled to Samuel Allen, a solicitor in Newark, on 5 January 1796, and entered the firm of Godfrey and Tallents (established by his father with the influential Newark banker Edward Smith Godfrey) in 1801.<br>
<br>Tallents married Elizabeth Tomlinson (1787&#150;1850), one of the fourteen children of William Tomlinson and Elizabeth Broadhurst of Newark, on 13 October 1806. The couple established a family home at Cartergate in Newark and had seven children (three sons and four daughters). The eldest, Elizabeth (1807&#150;1858), married into the Godfrey family. The youngest daughter, Mary Ann (1817&#150;1839), married, on 24 January 1837, John Hartpole Lecky of Cullenwood House in Dublin. They had one child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34461/', "William Edward Hartpole Lecky (1838&#150;1903)")</script>, the historian.<br>
<br>Obituarists and admirers have often referred to Tallents as &#145;indefatigable&#146;  (see Heron, 234) in the range and capacity of his work. His leading place in Nottinghamshire (especially Newark) politics and society for over thirty years was secured by his association with Godfrey, personal capabilities, and, as critics put it, the &#145;possession of every &hellip; public appointment which this Town and District have the disposal of&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nottingham Journal</span>). Chief among these were Tallents's period as town clerk of Newark from 15 April 1806 to 3 May 1833 and his subsequent appointment as alderman; he also served as councillor (east ward) from 1 January 1836. He was deputy clerk of the peace for Nottinghamshire from February 1834. Many of Tallents's positions were assumed on his death by his eldest son, Godfrey Tallents (1812&#150;1877).<br>
<br>Tallents's services as a political agent were in continual demand from aristocrats and candidates; his appointment as land steward and political agent to the fourth duke of Newcastle on 26 April 1826 is the principal example. His role as superintendent of the family's substantial estate and electoral influence in the Newark constituency and (after 1832) south Nottinghamshire brought him into close working contact with successive MPs in the Newcastle interest, and in particular, from 1832 to 1837, with W. E. Gladstone. Tallents acted as Gladstone's counsellor and mentor in maintaining his often fragile relations with Godfrey and other leading Conservatives, represented in the Red Club at Newark. In the dispute over the publicans' bills arising from the 1832 election, Tallents sided with Gladstone against many of his colleagues: &#145;notwithstanding my near connection with some of the Parties &hellip; I cannot avoid seeing &amp; deeply regretting the course they pursue&#146;  (Tallents to Lord Lincoln, 13 May 1835, Nottingham University, MS Ne C 11825). Gladstone himself found Tallents to be &#145;a cultivated &amp; very agreeable man&#146;  (Gladstone, <span class="italic">Diaries</span>, 3 Oct 1832) and, together with Newcastle, presented him with a pair of silver wine coolers for his dedicated service. On Tallents's death Newcastle stated that he had &#145;lost a real &amp; valuable friend as well as a man upon whose judgment &amp; ability I could confidently rely&#146;  (Nottingham University, MS Ne 2 F5, 24 Dec 1837).<br>
<br>Although Tallents was most closely associated with defending Newcastle's power and influence in the period when it was threatened by a whig government (1830&#150;34), his services were not confined by partisanship. He maintained a long-standing connection with the whig Yarborough family and superintended their electoral influence in Lincolnshire and at Great Grimsby (among whose members was Sir Robert Heron). Despite his local allegiance to Newcastle, he assisted Serjeant Thomas Wilde (Gladstone's opponent at Newark) in prosecuting the Swing rioters at Salisbury in December 1830, and worked with Wilde's agent, Charles Pearson, on electoral matters at Great Grimsby. Tallents was Brougham's choice in August 1831 as boundary commissioner for the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, and Lord John Russell consulted him on municipal corporation reform in June 1835  (G. Tallents, diary, 2 June 1835). Despite Newcastle's chagrin, Tallents stated that he had &#145;always thought it better to take the helm out of the hands of those who would steer an evil course and man the Decks with those who can and will direct it for the good of Society&#146;  (Tallents to Newcastle, 27 July 1836, Nottinghamshire Archives, MS 3937).<br>
<br>On 11 November 1835 Tallents purchased a London home at 26 Great George Street, Westminster, as a preparation for cultivating his national connections. It was there, on 22 December 1837, that he died from complaints associated with asthma, from which he had suffered for many years. He was buried in the family vault in the parish church at Newark-on-Trent (St Mary Magdalene) on 30 December. A tablet on the wall of the north chancel aisle records a tribute to Tallents's &#145;ability &hellip; integrity and &hellip; industry&#146;, qualities which are well reflected in his portrait by Thomas Barber.<br>
