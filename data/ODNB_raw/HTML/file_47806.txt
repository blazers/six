<span class="headword">Lumsden,  James</span>  (1778&#150;1856), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born at Glasgow on 13 November 1778, the eldest son of James Lumsden, a printer and engraver in the city, and his wife, Janet Craig. His education was obtained in the grammar school (later Glasgow high school), where he was a contemporary of the poet Thomas Campbell, and immediately after leaving school he entered his father's business as an apprentice. He succeeded to control of the business upon his father's death (<i>c</i>.1820). In Lumsden's hands it grew rapidly and diversified into manufacturing stationery and printing diaries, almanacs, and guidebooks.<br>
<br>Lumsden was a man with an enormous range of interests. An eager innovator, he was on board Henry Bell's famous experimental trip across the River Clyde in his steamship <i>Comet</i> in 1812. He was keen on the arts and encouraged painters such as Horatio McCulloch and Sir Daniel Macnee. He gave over fifty years of public service to the city of Glasgow. During the 1820s he spent a few years on the unreformed town council, but his reforming ideas made him unpopular with the tories and he was not re-elected until 1833, in the first open election to the new council. He became a magistrate at that time and served until 1853, save for the period 1838&#150;41 when the tories regained control. From 1843 until 1846 he was lord provost. He belonged to a group of reforming whigs, known locally as &#145;the clique&#146;. This group were free-traders, and strongly opposed to the corn laws, but it was in local politics that they made their mark.<br>
<br>During his time as provost Lumsden was largely responsible for extending the boundaries of the city into the burghs of Anderston, Gorbals, and Calton. As a member of the Clyde Trust he took a major role in improving the navigability of the river. He was also a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant for Lanarkshire. Lumsden's great energies were also devoted to social and philanthropic matters. He was treasurer of the Royal Infirmary for nineteen years, and used his many networks to raise funds. One of the promoters of the first model lodging houses, he took an interest in providing homes and night refuges for the homeless. He helped to found the City of Glasgow Native Benevolent Society and the Glasgow Athenaeum, and was three times president of the Incorporated Company of Stationers. The formation of what became the Glasgow Savings Bank in 1836 owed much to his energy and enterprise.<br>
<br>Lumsden's first real involvement with banking came in 1830, when he was one of the original promoters of the Glasgow Union Bank, but a dispute over the powers of the chairman occasioned his withdrawal. In 1838 he was involved, with a group of Glasgow businessmen &#145;of the middling order, liberal-radicals&#146;  (Checkland, 335), in the formation of one of the strongest joint-stock banks, the Clydesdale Bank. Although aged sixty, Lumsden was the moving spirit in the enterprise. There were 776 shareholders, and within a year the paid-up capital was &pound;375,000; by 1841 it was &pound;500,000. The bank had strong Edinburgh support, and Lumsden organized the purchase of the fine offices of Ramsay-Bonars as the Clydesdale's Edinburgh branch.<br>
<br>The bank had nine branches by the end of 1840, and in 1844 it took over the Greenock Union Bank. The founders of the bank have been aptly portrayed as &#145;thoroughly middle-class&#146; and, in spite of their mildly radical politics, as &#145;hard-headed and cautious&#146;  (Checkland, 336). Lumsden served as chairman in 1838&#150;41, and again in 1847. He retired from the bank in 1848. The records of the bank bear witness to his energy, imagination, and humour. The Clydesdale was one of only two of the Glasgow banks to maintain an independent existence into the twentieth century.<br>
<br>In the business world Lumsden also helped found the City of Glasgow Life Assurance Company, the City and Suburban Gas Company, and the Caledonian Railway Company. His involvement with railway companies seems to have been relatively modest, and he did not get heavily involved in the speculations of the late 1840s. For a time he was involved in running river steamers, but withdrew in 1841.<br>
<br>In 1802 Lumsden married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1819), the daughter of William Mirrlees, a saddler in Glasgow; they had two sons and a daughter. His wife's brother William was closely involved with Lumsden in many of his business pursuits, as was his son-in-law, Peter White, an accountant in Glasgow. Sir James Lumsden, one of his sons, was closely involved with the Clydesdale Bank; he served as a director and was chairman for a number of years. Throughout his life Lumsden was a faithful member of the Church of Scotland, and in 1850 he endowed a bursary for students of theology at Glasgow University.<br>
<br>A man of many talents and connections, Lumsden died on 16 May 1856 from an inflammation of the stomach and bowels at 208 St Vincent Street, Glasgow. An obituarist recalled that &#145;It is scarcely possible to mention a single local cause or event of a public nature with which he was not intimately associated&#146;  (Munn, 308).<br>
