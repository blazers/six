<span class="headword">Knightley, Sir  Richard</span>  (1609/10&#150;1661), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the eldest son of Richard Knightley (1580&#150;1650) of Fawsley, Northamptonshire, and Jane (<i>bap</i>. 1584, <i>d</i>. 1657), daughter of Sir Edward Littleton. The great-nephew of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15744/', "Sir Richard Knightley (1533&#150;1615)")</script>, he matriculated from Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1628, aged eighteen. He graduated BA in 1631, proceeded MA in 1633, and entered Gray's Inn later that year. His family had connections with the Eliots of Port Eliot, one of the great parliamentarian affinities of the age. The association was strengthened further when, about 1637, Richard married Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1643), daughter of John Hampden. They had a son, Richard, who died unmarried in 1665, and a daughter, Elizabeth, who died in infancy. After Elizabeth's death, on 22 July 1647 he married Anne (1615&#150;1703), widow of Essex Devereux, son and heir of Walter Devereux, fifth Viscount Hereford, and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6445/', "Sir William Courten (c.1568&#150;1636)")</script>. They had a son, Essex, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Jane.<br>
<br>Knightley was elected as MP for Northampton in the Short Parliament in April 1640. After its dissolution he invited Hampden, Pym, and other opposition leaders to Fawsley. He was returned for Northampton again in November to the Long Parliament. In 1643 he was one of John Pym's pallbearers. An extremely active parliamentarian throughout the 1640s he eventually reached the higher echelons of the wartime administration when he joined the Derby House committee in May 1648. In explanation of his middle group allegiance during the first war it has been said that Knightley was among those who were able to &#145;reconcile a desire for primitive episcopacy with support for resolute prosecution of the war&#146;  (Underdown, 64&#150;5). However, his allegiance was ductile, and by the time of the 1647 crisis between parliament and the army he was often found making common cause with the political presbyterians, and he remained at Westminster during the apprentices' putsch. In December 1648 he appears to have strongly favoured concluding with the king on the terms agreed at Newport. Despite his middle group credentials he was imprisoned for a fortnight after Pride's Purge.<br>
<br>After the execution of Charles I, Knightley kept out of politics until the fall of the Rump Parliament. In 1651 a licence to go abroad was granted to one Richard Knightley. In 1655 he was described as one of those local governors &#145;who do not persecute but are loving to Friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>). He came to accept the protectorate, and represented his native county in Richard Cromwell's parliament (declining a nomination to serve as speaker), remarking that &#145;A Commonwealth was never for the common weal&#146;  (Underdown, 345). When the Rump was restored in May 1659 Knightley joined with William Prynne and others in attempting unsuccessfully to enter the house. Subsequently he was prominent in securing the readmission of the secluded members in February 1660, and soon afterwards he was appointed to the council of state. Rejected at the Northamptonshire election to the Convention later that year on account of an ill-judged remark about the return of the Stuart king to England, Knightley was elected instead, on the Eliot interest, for St Germans, Cornwall. In the Convention, Knightley spoke on the problem of dealing with maimed soldiers, widows, and orphans and sat on committees for instructing messengers to the king and preparing for his reception. Lord Wharton counted Knightley as a friend, and after the restoration of Charles II, Knightley was certainly active in support of indemnity for Wharton's associate Richard Salway. He also opposed an attempt to exclude all those who sat in judgment on Charles I from the <span class="roman">Act of Indemnity</span>, and supported lenience in the treatment of those who had supported the interregnum regimes. He appears to have favoured some sort of church settlement which would comprehend non-Anglicans, to have found the Worcester House declaration acceptable, and to have been amenable to the case for modified episcopacy. It has been suggested that &#145;on religious questions he generally followed the Presbyterian line&#146;  (Helms and Watson, 2.700).<br>
<br>Knightley was made a knight of the Bath in the king's 1661 coronation honours, but died shortly afterwards in London on 29 June. He was buried on 9 July at Fawsley.<br>
