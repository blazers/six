<span class="headword">Whiting,  Richard</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1539), <span class="occ">abbot of Glastonbury</span>, is of unknown origins (a statement that he was a son of one of the abbey's tenants at nearby Wrington cannot be substantiated). He became a Benedictine monk at Glastonbury, where he may have studied as a child during the abbacy of Richard Bere (1493&#150;1525). He was ordained acolyte in 1498, subdeacon in 1499, deacon in 1500, and priest in March 1501. Having some time held the position of chamberlain at Glastonbury, on Bere's death in February 1525 he was appointed abbot by Wolsey, probably on the suggestion of John Islip, abbot of Westminster; by this time he is thought to have been approaching the age of sixty.<br>
<br>Whiting appears to have lived the typical life of a late medieval abbot of a great house (Glastonbury had the highest net income of any English monastery in 1535). He was fond of hunting, entertained on a grand scale, attended parliament, and presented Christmas gifts to the king. He continued the intensive building work begun under Bere, including the completion of St Edgar's Chapel at the east end of the abbey church. As late as 1539 he was concerning himself with having his own arms set up on new buildings at Glastonbury. He also maintained the tradition of hospitality to all, with the abbey feeding the poor of the neighbourhood twice weekly. His abbacy coincided with a period of general decline for the Benedictines, yet at Glastonbury the number of monks rose from forty-six to fifty-four. During the 1530s, moreover, there was an increase in the number of monks who went from Glastonbury to Gloucester College at Oxford, even though Whiting himself seems to have been more interested in music than scholarship, making arrangements in 1534 for the instruction of the choirboys. A visitation in 1538 suggests that there were divisions among the monks, especially between the older and younger ones, and that the abbot had his favourites in the community. Whiting was also apt to reside away from the monastery, especially at his manors of Sturminster Newton in Dorset and Ashbury in Berkshire. Some of his apparent shortcomings were probably due to ill health, however, and he appears to have had few critics before the events of 1539, being described by John Leland, whom he entertained generously, as &#145;homo sane candidissimus, et amicus meus singularis&#146; (&#145;a most upright man and my particular friend&#146;; <span class="italic">De rebus Britannicis collectanea</span>, 6.70).<br>
<br>Early investigations into the management of the abbey and the conduct of its monks found little to complain of (the oath of royal supremacy had been taken by Whiting and his brethren in June 1534), and as late as September 1539 the king's commissioner Richard Layton was severely rebuked by Cromwell for offering a positive appraisal of Whiting's character, a judgement he was quick to retract. By now, however, despite Whiting's efforts to maintain a good relationship with Cromwell, on whom he had bestowed several gifts (notably the advowson of Monkton church) and who as recently as March 1538 had reassured the abbot against &#145;fear of suppression or change of life&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 13/1, no. 573), the writing was clearly on the wall. Following cross-examination on 19 September at his manor house of Sharpham near Glastonbury by Layton, Thomas Moyle, and Richard Pollard, who found the aged abbot's answers evidence of &#145;his cankered and traitorous heart&#146;, Whiting, &#145;being but a very weak man and sickly&#146;, was dispatched to the Tower of London  (ibid., 14/2, no. 206). Even now proof of the treasonable behaviour Cromwell wished to establish in order to suppress the abbey was hard to find, and, although by the beginning of October Layton and his colleagues had secured depositions from discontented monks at Glastonbury alleging such behaviour, the only specific accusations laid against Whiting were possession of a book found at the abbey condemning the royal divorce and his having hidden a number of precious objects from the despoilers.<br>
<br>Whiting's trial before a compliant jury took place at Wells on 14 November, the main charge against him being simply that &#145;of robbyng of Glastonburye churche&#146;  (Wright, 260). Sentenced to death by John, Lord Russell, the abbot was the following day dragged on a hurdle through the town of Glastonbury up to Tor Hill to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, &#145;att whych tyme he askyd god mercye and the kyng for hys great offensys towardes hys hyghenes &hellip; and thereapon toke hys deathe very pacyently&#146;  (ibid., 261) alongside two of his monks, John Thorne and Roger James.<br>
<br>Whiting was regarded as a martyr in the late nineteenth century both by the Catholic historian Francis Gasquet and by the agnostic anti-Catholic James Froude, and even the most detached assessment of his last days suggests a man of principle and moral courage, prepared to die for what he believed in. He was beatified in 1896.<br>
