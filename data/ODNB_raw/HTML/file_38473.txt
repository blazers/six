<span class="headword">Cook, Sir  Albert Ruskin</span>  (1870&#150;1951), <span class="occ">physician and missionary</span>, was born on 2 March 1870 in the London suburb of Hampstead, the twelfth of thirteen children of William Henry Cook (1825&#150;1882), a family physician who practised in Tunbridge Wells and then in London, and his wife, Harriet Bickersteth (1830&#150;1918), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2345/', "Edward Bickersteth")</script>, rector of Watton in Hertfordshire and sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31876/', "Edward Henry Bickersteth")</script>, bishop of Exeter. Both Cook's grandfather and uncle had strong connections with the Church Missionary Society (CMS). The classical scholar <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32538/', "Arthur Bernard Cook")</script> was his brother.<br>
<br>As a youth Cook&#151;who had grey-blue eyes and reddish hair&#151;lived in London. Two years after his father's death the family moved from their home in Abbey Road to a leased house in Carlingford Street, near Hampstead Heath. After a few years at preparatory school he won a scholarship to St Paul's School, London, in 1881; initially he followed the arts curriculum, but later he turned his efforts towards science. From 1889 to 1893 Cook attended Trinity College, Cambridge (BA, 1893). During these years he established a reputation as an excellent student, and supported himself by tutoring fellow students and by selling antiquarian books. On 13 July 1893 he received a Shuter scholarship from St Bartholomew's Hospital, where he underwent his clinical training. He qualified MB in 1895 and MD in 1901. Nine days after qualifying in 1895 he submitted an application to join the CMS, which eventually accepted him as a medical missionary for service in Uganda, then a British protectorate.<br>
<br>On 3 September 1896 Cook and a party of eleven other CMS missionaries, including his future wife, Katherine Timpson (<i>d</i>. 1938), whom he married in 1900, left England on the SS <i>Khedive</i>, bound for Aden, where they changed to the SS <i>Canara</i> for the journey to east Africa. On 1 October 1896 Cook and his colleagues landed at Mombasa. After an 84-day, 850-mile overland journey, during which Cook attended to 2230 patients, the CMS party arrived in Mengo, near Kampala, on 19 February 1897. Two days later Cook started seeing patients in a shed which originally had been a smithy. Within a month he was examining fifty to eighty patients daily. On 14 May 1897 Cook opened Mengo Hospital, which consisted of two houses with reed walls, thatched roofs, and mud floors, and had beds for twelve patients. By the mid-1930s, Mengo Hospital had become the cornerstone of one of the best medical infrastructures in sub-Saharan Africa. Apart from providing accommodation for 132 Africans, twelve Europeans, and twenty-four Indian patients, Mengo Hospital maintained a training school for African medical assistants and a radiological department with the country's only complete X-ray apparatus. Additionally Mengo Hospital was associated with the Lady Coryndon Maternity Training School, which opened in June 1921. Cook received a medal with two clasps for his services during the Nubian uprising of 1897&#150;8.<br>
<br>During his years in Uganda Cook also performed some significant scientific work, often in conjunction with his brother John (1871&#150;1946), who also worked as a physician in Uganda between 1899 and 1920. In February 1901, for example, the brothers Cook diagnosed the first cases of sleeping sickness, a disease which eventually claimed the lives of at least 200,000 Ugandans who lived beside Lake Victoria or on the Buvuma Islands. During the following years, Cook identified the treponema of relapsing fever and published his findings in the <span class="italic">Journal of Tropical Medicine</span>.<br>
<br>Apart from his regular duties at Mengo Hospital and his scientific work, Cook also engaged in missionary work. On 8 March 1904 he started on a ten-week, 642-mile safari by bicycle, with his wife and Bishop Alfred Tucker of the CMS, to Acholi, where the party established a mission station. The following year he went on a similar journey, which lasted more than six months, to southern Sudan, where he helped to organize a mission station at Bor, a small settlement north of Juba on the River Nile. To support future missionary activities among the Dinka people at this remote location, Cook wrote several manuals in the Dinka language.<br>
<br>After the First World War Cook strove to improve the quality of maternity and child welfare throughout Uganda. To achieve this goal he performed work for the government-sponsored Social Purity Campaign, which sought to reduce the number of cases of venereal disease in the country. Cook and his wife also sought donations for the construction of the Lady Coryndon Maternity Training School which, by 1929, was serving more than 10,000 patients annually. In 1923 he published <span class="italic">Amagezi agokuzalisa</span>, a textbook in Luganda for midwifery students, and about the same time he helped to create a network of twenty-two country health stations staffed by trained midwives. Cook's <span class="italic">Handbook of Midwifery for Teaching Native Midwives</span> was published in 1931.<br>
<br>By the early 1930s Cook's medical career was drawing to an end. In 1932 he was knighted in recognition of his many contributions to the establishment and development of western medicine in Uganda. Although he retired on 2 March 1934 Cook continued to work as a consultant to Mengo Hospital. He also served as president, and later as honorary vice-president, of the Uganda Literary and Scientific Society, which published the prestigious <span class="italic">Uganda Journal</span>, to which Cook contributed several articles. In 1937 Cook and his wife, Katherine, represented Uganda at the coronation of King George VI. On 17 May 1938 she died as a result of complications associated with a severe bout of malaria. In 1945 the Uganda Literary and Scientific Society published Cook's <span class="italic">Uganda Memories, 1897&#150;1940</span>, a classic book which is essential for understanding not only his medical work but also the history of the early British colonial period in Uganda.<br>
<br>Cook remained active until the end of his life, primarily working on his diaries or writing scientific and historical articles. During the last years of his life he became addicted to morphine, reportedly because he suffered from chronic insomnia and missed his late wife. On 23 April 1951 he died at his home at Makindye Hill, near Kampala, Uganda. After receiving the only royal funeral to have been granted to a European, he was buried next to his wife at the cathedral of St Paul, Namirembe Hill, Kampala. The marble cross that marks his grave is inscribed, on the orders of the king (<i>kabaka</i>) of Buganda, &#145;to a true friend of Uganda&#146;. Cook was survived by an only daughter, Margaret, who also was a physician. Cook and his wife also had an adopted son, David, who lived primarily with a missionary colleague, Sister Emily Watney; he was killed on active service during the Second World War.<br>
<br>As befitted his professional and religious callings, Cook was a gentle, quiet, dedicated, and humble man, with simple tastes. He was well liked by everyone who knew him. His pioneering work in establishing an adequate health-care system for the Ugandan people remains his greatest legacy.<br>
