<span class="headword">Wiseman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>North]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>, Lady Wiseman <span class="st"> [<em>other married name </em>Elizabeth Paston, countess of Yarmouth]</span>  (1647&#150;1730), <span class="occ">litigant</span>, the fifth daughter (the third surviving to adulthood) of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20296/', "Dudley North, fourth Baron North (1602&#150;1677)")</script>, and Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Montagu (<i>c</i>.1613&#150;1681), was born in London on 4 January 1647. She was sister to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20301/', "Francis North, first Baron Guilford")</script>, and to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20314/', "Roger North")</script>, lawyer and author of the lives of three of his brothers, Francis, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20310/', "John North")</script> (professor of Greek at Cambridge University), and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20297/', "Sir Dudley North")</script>, merchant. She married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58166/', "Sir Robert Wiseman (b. 1609/10)")</script>, dean of the arches, and after his death in 1684 she married, in 1687, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21517/', "William Paston, second earl of Yarmouth (1653/4&#150;1732)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21513/', "Paston, Robert")</script>]. After the death in 1685 of her brother Francis, Elizabeth cared for and educated his daughter Anne. At that time she was living at Chelsea, but within a year she had moved to the fashionable Soho Square, then newly laid out by Gregory King. Sir Peter Lely painted her portrait in 1678 or 1679, one of six he did for Sir Francis North of members of his family in return for legal work. The portrait has so far not been identified among the many by Lely of unnamed sitters.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Wiseman was briefly the subject of London gossip in 1686&#150;7, and is known to later times because of her unwilling involvement in a claim for breach of marriage contract. On the death of her first husband, Sir Robert Wiseman, she was left with a fortune of &pound;20,000 although on marriage he had &#145;made no other settlement, then by a bond to leav her portion [of &pound;1500] doubled&#146;. Among the many suitors for this windfall was one Robert Spencer, who was a cousin of Robert Spencer, second earl of Sunderland, and whose cause was supported and encouraged by Elizabeth's eldest brother, Charles, fifth Baron North, and his wife, Katharine. Charles North hoped the marriage would gain him influence with the earl of Sunderland and at the court of James II. Charles and his wife arranged meetings between Elizabeth and Spencer. On one occasion Spencer appeared from an inner room after a promise that he would not be present; on another Spencer and Elizabeth were shut in a room together, after which Charles North and Spencer claimed that a marriage contract had taken place. Elizabeth vehemently denied this claim and put her case in the hands of her brothers Sir Dudley, then commissioner for customs; Roger; and Mountague, a merchant. On their advice she went to live at Brettenham in Suffolk with her sister and brother-in-law, Sir George and Lady Christina (or Christian) Wenyeve. As a consequence of her leaving London, and of the continued threats of Spencer and Charles North, a large correspondence to and from her three supportive brothers accumulated, and was preserved by Roger North because at one point he, as her lawyer, suggested that they might take an action against Spencer for breach of promise of marriage. The correspondence, preserved in case of the necessity for legal action, tells Elizabeth's (and her brothers') version of Spencer's claims and behaviour. It also gives details of the consequent flight from arrangements for a marriage to Sir John Thorold that were in progress when Spencer's suit began, and the antics in the pursuit of two other suitors (a Mr Danvers and a Mr Neal) for Elizabeth's hand in the seven months before she married the second earl of Yarmouth. No case for breach of promise was prosecuted, but the affair ended with a case in the court of the arches (1687). Spencer's deposition was made before Thomas Exton, dean of the arches, on 27 April 1687. In it he puts his own side of the story, graphically describing his behaviour towards Elizabeth (what she referred to as his &#145;flames and nonsence&#146; and his &#145;rudenesses&#146;) and what he claimed was Elizabeth's acquiescence in it. When the case came to trial Spencer was made to retract his claim to Elizabeth and also to withdraw claims (presumably for damages) against the earl of Yarmouth's brother Thomas Paston and his friend Thomas Rawlens who, it seems, had assaulted him. At the same time Charles North apparently reluctantly withdrew his own claim that he and his wife had witnessed in their house a verbal contract of marriage between the two. Finally Spencer challenged the earl of Yarmouth to a duel, but the remaining documents do not disclose whether or not this was fought.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Wiseman's case is of significance for information on the legal and social status of widows; the laws of evidence, which were constantly reviewed in the 1680s and 1690s, and for which circumstantial evidence was more widely accepted; and for details of social and familial interaction. Apart from this single episode little is known of her life. Ketton-Cremer records that when the earl of Yarmouth was imprisoned in the Tower in 1690 as an &#145;open partisan&#146; of James II, Elizabeth &#145;petitioned the Queen to lodge with him&#146;. A letter that Roger North wrote to their niece Anne Foley on Elizabeth's illness in 1728 gives a glimpse of difficulties in her marriage with the earl, who died two years after her and was declared bankrupt on his death. Elizabeth died in 1730 and had no children from either her first or second marriage.<br>
