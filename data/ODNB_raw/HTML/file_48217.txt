<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Edwards, Sir  George</span>  (1850&#150;1933), <span class="occ">trade unionist and politician</span>, was born on 5 March 1850 at Marsham in Norfolk, the son of Thomas Edwards and his wife, Mary. His father, a discharged soldier, was a bullock feeder and his mother a handloom weaver. He was the youngest of four children of his mother's second marriage. He had two older brothers and a sister, and three stepbrothers, who did not live with the family.<br>
<br>Edwards's childhood was spent in terrible poverty, including a spell in the workhouse when his father was imprisoned for stealing turnips from a field; and the only schooling he received was at a Church of England Sunday school which he attended briefly in Marsham. At the age of six he started work scaring crows. Between 1856 and 1869 he followed a series of trades in agriculture, while working periodically as a brick maker, the trade his father followed from the mid-1840s. In 1869, in one of the most important changes in his life, he was converted to Primitive Methodism, the religious cause to which he remained attached until his death.<br>
<br>On 21 June 1872 Edwards married Charlotte Corke (<i>d</i>. 1912), who lived in Alby, Norfolk, where he had gone to work on the brick-fields. Taught to read and write by his wife, in the summer of 1873 he was taken onto the plan of Aylsham Primitive Methodist circuit as a lay preacher. He conducted his first service by learning the text (1 John: 29) and the hymns of the day by heart from his wife's dictation. Alongside his religious development he began his lifelong involvement in politics and trade unionism. In his own words, the &#145;terrible sufferings I had undergone in my boyhood burnt themselves into my soul like hot iron&#146;  (G. Edwards, 36), and when the first agricultural trade unions appeared in Norfolk in 1872 Edwards was an early convert. For the next fifteen years he remained a loyal and dedicated member of the rank and file, first of the local East Dereham district union and then as a member of Joseph Arch's National Agricultural Labourers' Union. He took an active part in the election campaign of 1885, the first one at which farm labourers had the vote, and was sacked and blacklisted for his beliefs. In 1889, after a period of decline, the trade union movement revived in Norfolk and Edwards became secretary of the newly formed Norfolk Federal Union, Cromer district; and then, in 1890, full time organizer for the union. However, the continuing agricultural depression and bitter, well-organized opposition from the employers led to the total collapse of the union in 1896.<br>
<br>For the next ten years Edwards returned to his trade as a brick maker. In 1906, following the Liberal election victory, he was instrumental in re-forming a trade union for farmworkers. This was to become the National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers, later the agricultural trades section of the Transport and General Workers Union. He remained secretary and organizer until 1913 when he retired, following his wife's death and his own increasing ill health, and became union president. However, his work for the union and for labourers continued. He served on the Norfolk War Agriculture Committee, and as a labourers' representative on the central wages board and the Norfolk county wages board from 1917 to 1921. In 1923 he took an active role in the bitter strike in Norfolk against wage reductions.<br>
<br>Alongside his union work Edwards was always active in the broader world of politics. He became in the 1870s, as he put it, &#145;an advanced Liberal&#146;  (G. Edwards, 43), and as such served as a parish, district, and county councillor. Unusually for her time and class, his wife, Charlotte, was also active in local politics, serving as a parish and district councillor. She made a particular mark on the Erpingham board of guardians, devoting her time and care to fighting for better conditions for women inmates, especially single mothers. In 1918 Edwards left the Liberal Party and joined the Labour Party, fighting the general election of that year as a Labour candidate for South Norfolk. He lost but was elected for the same seat at a by-election in July 1920. He made his maiden speech on 21 October 1920 on unemployment and the poor law. He lost his seat at the general election of 1922 but regained it in 1923. He was again defeated in 1924 when the &#145;red scare&#146; caused nationally by the fabricated Zinoviev letter was used against him by local Conservatives to suggest that he was a long-term, if lukewarm, supporter of the Soviet Union.<br>
<br>Although no longer active in national politics after his defeat in 1924, Edwards, unlike Arch, remained firm in his beliefs and returned to the local sphere as a Labour alderman on Norfolk county council and as a parish councillor for Fakenham, where he had lived since 1910. In 1919 he was appointed OBE for his wartime service to agriculture, and he was given a knighthood in the 1930 birthday honours. Fittingly the citation simply said &#145;For services to agricultural workers&#146;. Despite increasing ill health and constant urging from doctors and his family, Edwards continued active until the last weeks of his life. He attended the Walsingham board of guardians two weeks before his death, where he argued forcefully on a case of forcible eviction of a farmworker and his family. He died after a series of heart attacks on the evening of 6 December 1933 and was buried in Fakenham cemetery on 11 December. Although Edwards had no children, in the 1920s he adopted the son of his niece Elizabeth, Noel Kernick, who took his uncle's name.<br>
<br>Years of hard work and poverty left their mark on Edwards physically. Never tall, he became bent in late middle age, yet continued to cycle hundreds of miles a week on union work during the years between 1906 and 1913. In his later years he was regarded by many as a moderate within the labour movement, yet he remained absolutely unswerving in its cause and even in 1931 fought hard against what he regarded as MacDonald's &#145;betrayal of the whole working class movement&#146;  (N. Edwards). He also remained an active Primitive Methodist, despite the fact that his own uncompromising Christian socialism was increasingly out of place in a Church which had forgotten its radical past. He was remembered, even in the 1970s, with enormous affection and respect by the generation of Norfolk farmworkers who had grown up in the bitter years before 1930. The fact that Norfolk continued to return a Labour MP until 1970&#151;the only rural area so to do&#151;is perhaps some reflection of the importance of Edwards's contribution to the history of farmworkers' trade unionism and rural labour in the area.<br>
