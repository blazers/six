<span class="headword">Faden,  William</span>  (1749&#150;1836), <span class="occ">engraver and cartographer</span>, was born in London on 11 July 1749, the younger son and sixth of eight known children of William Faden (1711&#150;1783), formerly Mackfaden, and his wife, Hannah. His father, a well-known printer, then of Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, had abbreviated the family name at the time of the Jacobite rising of 1745.<br>
<br>Faden was apprenticed to the Fleet Street engraver James Wigley on 4 July 1764. At the expiry of his term he became free of the Clothworkers' Company on 7 August 1771. By 1773 he was in partnership with the family of the recently deceased map maker Thomas Jefferys, at Jefferys's premises on the corner of St Martin's Lane. The partnership with the younger Jefferys was dissolved in 1776, the same year in which Faden became an active member of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/93805', "Society of Civil Engineers (later the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers)")</script>, the influential dining club of John Smeaton and other leading practical men of the day founded in 1771.<br>
<br>In the years of the American wars Faden came to prominence with maps and atlases of considerable historical note, some of the materials for which survive in the Library of Congress. He is glimpsed at this time as the &#145;very accurate, industrious young man&#146; commended by Thomas Pownall. In 1783 his father's will enabled him to establish full control of the business. That same year he was appointed to &#145;the place and quality of Geographer in Ordinary to his Majesty&#146;.<br>
<br>Systematic in the acquisition of the best available maps, Faden developed the most competent cartographic service of the period. His was an international concern, in contact with map makers throughout Europe. He supplied government departments and commissioned fresh surveys. A gold medallist of the Society of Arts in 1796, his activities foreshadowed the emergence of national cartographic agencies. He brought out the first published Ordnance Survey map, <span class="italic">An Entirely New &amp; Accurate Survey of the County of Kent</span> (1801). Some of his plates were likewise adopted as official Admiralty charts. When he moved at this time to larger premises at no. 5 Charing Cross, his maps were reputed the finest being engraved anywhere in the world.<br>
<br>Of Faden's personal life little is known. His sister Hannah married the painter and astronomer John Russell, and there is an excellent Russell pastel (British Library) of Faden, in an attentive and determined pose. The brothers-in-law collaborated on the earliest extant lunar globe.<br>
<br>Faden retired in 1823, the business passing to his former apprentice, James Wyld the elder. He died in Shepperton, where his nephew William Russell was then rector, on 21 March 1836, leaving a considerable fortune. There is an elegant memorial to Faden and his sister Jane (1753&#150;1833) in the parish church, where he was buried.<br>
