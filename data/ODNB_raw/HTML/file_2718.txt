<span class="headword">Blundeville,  Thomas</span>  (1522?&#150;1606?), <span class="occ">author and translator</span>, was the eldest son of Edward Blundeville (1492/3&#150;1568), of Newton Flotman, Norfolk, and Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Godsalve. His brother was Jeremy Blundeville of Toft Monks. Suggestions that he was educated at Cambridge remain unsubstantiated; it is possible that he entered Gray's Inn in 1541. Blundeville apparently lived in London for some years before returning to live in Norfolk on the death of his father, aged seventy-five, in 1568, when he inherited the family estate at Newton Flotman. He married twice, first Rose Puttenham in 1554 and second Margaret Johnson of Woodnorton (<i>d</i>. 1617) in 1581. With his first wife he had a son, born in 1555 (probably named Anthony although sometimes referred to as Andrew), who was apparently killed in the Low Countries and died unmarried. He had two daughters from his second marriage: Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1584) in 1610 married Rowland Meyrick of Gladestry, Radnorshire, son of Sir Gelly Meyrick, and had, among others, one son named Blundeville Meyrick, probably also born in 1610; Patience (<i>bap</i>. 1585, <i>d</i>. 1639) in 1605 married Robert King of Culpho, Suffolk (who later styled himself Robert King Blundeville).<br>
<br>Thomas Blundeville was the author of a number of works covering matters as diverse as horsemanship, astronomy, and the study of history. Most of his writings are prose, except the <span class="italic">Three Morall Treatises</span> (1561), which includes two pieces in verse. Two of his works deal directly with horsemanship. <span class="italic">The Fower Chiefyst Offices Belonging to Horsemanshippe</span> (1565&#150;6) is a substantial and wide-ranging work, discussing such matters as horse breaking, the art of riding, the diet and diseases of horses, and the various offices of the rider, the breeder, and the farrier. It also includes a number of engravings of horse bits and shoes.<br>
<br>Among Blundeville's other interests were mathematics and navigation. He had been a mathematics tutor in the households of Sir Nicholas Bacon and Justice Francis Wyndham for a time, and among his friends were some of the leading mathematicians of the age, including John Dee and Henry Briggs. His navigational writings were principally directed towards young gentlemen, providing instruction on astronomy, maps, and instruments. In <span class="italic">The Theoriques of the Planets</span> (1602) he describes (with diagrams) the motions of the planets as well as lunar and solar eclipses. In this treatise he also discusses the measurement of latitude and provides engravings of various navigational instruments. Likewise, his <span class="italic">M. Blundevile his Exercises, Containing Sixe Treatises</span> (1594) considers arithmetic, cosmology, the elements of the earth, and navigation.<br>
<br>Blundeville's other works include <span class="italic">The Art of Logicke</span> (published in 1599, though probably written about 1575) and a treatise entitled <span class="italic">The True Order and Methode of Wryting and Reading Hystories</span> (1574). This is the first separately printed English work to deal with the study of history. It not only explains sixteenth-century notions of history, but also anticipates more recent historical views, for instance the relationship between man and the environment. Several of Blundeville's other works were translations&#151;he had, apparently, travelled in Italy, and was able to translate accurately. In <span class="italic">A Very Briefe and Profitable Treatise</span> (1570) he translated from Italian a treatise originally written in Spanish by Federigo Furio, which had been translated into Italian by Alfonso d'Ulloa; he was also responsible for translating Jacopo Aconcio's account of the fortification of cities, though the translation of John Sturmius's work under the title <span class="italic">A Ritch Storehouse, or, Treasurie for Nobilitye and Gentlemen</span> (1570), was&#151;contrary to some modern bibliographies&#151;by Thomas Brown (<i>fl</i>. 1570) of Lincoln's Inn.<br>
<br>In 1571 Blundeville erected a monument to his family at the church in Newton Flotman, with effigies of his great-grandfather, his grandfather, and his father, and with a place for his two wives and two daughters. He, too, is buried there, under an effigy representing him in armour, kneeling at a faldstool, on which are lying a book and helmet. Blundeville's will is dated 1605, and it is believed that he died in 1606. He left the bulk of his estate to his wife, Margaret, while his elder daughter, Elizabeth, was to be paid her portion provided she married with her mother's consent. Her bequest was to be made up to &pound;100 when her mother thought this was suitable. Blundeville also left charitable bequests to twenty households in Newton Flotman and Swainthorpe, and &pound;5 to his lawyer and friend Robert Redmayne. He stipulated that pieces of furniture, armour, books, and astronomical instruments were to be left in the house for the use of future generations. A series of suits in chancery show that the implementation of Blundeville's will proved a matter of some contention. It appears that he had initially intended Elizabeth to marry Robert King, but that Elizabeth jilted him and instead married Rowland Meyrick. Blundeville, as a result, permitted King to marry his younger daughter, Patience, and (according to King) granted him the right to bear the name of Blundeville. The contents of the household were fought over for some time, but it appears that Robert King finally established his title to the manor of Newton Flotman; in 1646 he sold the estate to John Burman of Norwich.<br>
