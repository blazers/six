<span class="headword">Brown,  George Mackay</span>  (1921&#150;1996), <span class="occ">poet and writer</span>, was born on 17 October 1921 in Victoria Street, Stromness, on mainland Orkney, the last of six children of John Brown (1875&#150;1940), tailor and postman, and his wife, Mhairi 
    (Mary Jane; 1891&#150;1967)
  , daughter of Hugh Mackay of Strathy, Sutherland, and his wife, Georgina. His parents were both Scottish, although Brown, like most Orcadians, always stressed the cultural gulf between the islanders and their neighbours on the Scottish mainland. His mother was a native Gaelic speaker.<br>
<br>The formal education Brown received in local schools was ultimately less important to him than the reading discoveries he made for himself as a young man. The stories told by his elder sister Ruby were formative, and as he himself wrote, &#145;literature entered the mind stealthily, like a thief; only it was a good thief, like Robin Hood or Brecht's Asdak, and left treasures instead of taking them&#146;  (Brown, <span class="italic">For the Islands I Sing</span>, 41). His lifelong tendency to poor health began with a bad attack of measles during his mid-teens, though his smoking from the age of twelve may not have helped, as he freely acknowledged. Brown's father died suddenly in 1940, leaving his youngest son living with his mother but unable to earn an adult wage. Pulmonary tuberculosis confined him to a sanatorium in Kirkwall for six months in 1941, after which he began to write verse and to contribute articles and reviews to a local newspaper, the <span class="italic">Orkney Herald</span>. Journalism provided an important and congenial outlet for his writing throughout his life. He extended his knowledge of literature, music, and history, and made friends with local artists and intellectuals. He was later encouraged to apply for a place at the newly established Newbattle Abbey College (at Dalkeith, south of Edinburgh), an adult education college under the wardenship of the poet Edwin Muir. A meeting with Muir and his wife Willa, in summer 1951, secured Brown a place for the 1951&#150;2 session: &#145;Newbattle stimulated me, and gave me a sense of purpose and direction&#146;  (ibid., 93). He published his first poetry collection, <span class="italic">The Storm, and other Poems</span>, in 1954 at his own expense. Muir provided an introduction.<br>
<br>Further illness preceded a second brief spell at Newbattle in 1956. This in turn encouraged Brown to enter Edinburgh University as an undergraduate (1956&#150;60). At Muir's instigation the Hogarth Press issued Brown's next collection, <span class="italic">Loaves and Fishes</span>, in 1959. Thereafter, a brief taste of teacher training convinced him that teaching was not an appropriate career; in any case, his health broke down once more and he spent winter 1960&#150;61 in Tor-Na-Dee sanatorium west of Aberdeen. After his recovery Brown became a Roman Catholic in 1961. Never satisfied by the Calvinism in which he was brought up, he had been drawn to Roman Catholicism since his teens, especially after reading Lytton Strachey's essay on Cardinal Manning. Whatever Strachey's intention, this account allowed Brown to glimpse something of the strength and durability of the Catholic faith. As with the other values on which his life was founded, literary expression was central to his commitment to it: &#145;In the end it was literature that broke down my last defences. There are many ways of entering a fold; it was the beauty of words that opened the door to me&#146;  (Brown, <span class="italic">For the Islands I Sing</span>, 53).<br>
<br>During a further two years of postgraduate work in Edinburgh, Brown studied Hopkins, a poet he had long loved but whom he claimed to have chosen for this purpose because &#145;Hopkins' collected poems are probably the fewest in English literature&#146;  (Brown, <span class="italic">For the Islands I Sing</span>, 149). He gained no second degree, however. His years in Edinburgh were important for the contacts and friendships he made among the poets and literati there, including Norman MacCaig, Sydney Goodsir Smith, and Hugh MacDiarmid. Smith's <span class="italic">Kynd Kittock's Land</span> (1965) gives a glimpse of Brown in their convivial company:<blockquote>
<div>While lean MacCaig stauns snuffin the Western seas<br>
</div>
<div>And Brown leads wi his Viking chin<br>
</div>
<div>And winna be rebukit.<br>
</div>
</blockquote>In all Brown published thirty-one books of poetry, many of which are limited editions, or collaborations with artists. Fourteen, however, are substantial collections. His poems, characteristically, are impersonal and avoid autobiographical confession. Many tell stories, however briefly; many, also, illustrate his instinct for pattern and order. All demonstrate his care as a craftsman and his sensual responsiveness to the sounds of words.<br>
<br>Like his mentor Edwin Muir, Brown strove in his verse &#145;to express universal insights&#146;  (Bold, 19). Whereas Muir's means of achieving this, however, often involved his turning to regions of dream and archetype, Brown habitually draws on Orkney life, on history, and on religious ritual.<br>
<br>Brown's origins were as humble and geographically obscure as the role of &#145;lad o' pairts&#146; usually demands, but where an immense talent might have been expected to elevate its possessor above his origins Brown defied the pattern and continued living unpretentiously in Stromness for most of his life. His achievement as a writer did not propel him into the wider world; rather, it brought the world to him and to Orkney. This was not only literally true, though his fame eventually drew many visitors and scholars. It was also true in the sense that the world has accepted Brown's vision of Orkney as valid and enriching, a place created in literature like Joyce's Dublin and Dickens's London.<br>
<br>Brown's first collection of short stories, <span class="italic">A Calendar of Love and other Stories</span>, appeared in 1967. In all, twelve volumes of stories were published during his lifetime and for many readers it is for his prose stories that he is best remembered and most valued. They share many of the characteristic features of his poems, especially as regards subject matter and approach to structure. As he said himself during an interview:<blockquote>Lots of my poems are sort of compressed stories and you could expand them and make a short story of them. Maybe a novel if you wanted to go to town. And also lots of the stories could be compressed a good bit into a poem, you know, with all the inessentials left out. (Murray, 51)</blockquote>His five novels, like his poems and short stories, reflect Orkney past and present, sometimes realistically, sometimes in fable. Many readers find the first, <span class="italic">Greenvoe</span> (1972), to be the most appealing: it is a portrait of a modern Orkney island snuffed out by a sinister government conspiracy but with the possibility of resurgence thanks to the spiritual strength of the indigenous inhabitants and their rituals.<br>
<br>The destruction of the fictional Greenvoe by the bureaucratic project Black Star (read by some as a foreshadowing of the impact of the oil industry on Orkney, but later described by Brown as a project of &#145;preparations for a third world war, much more hideous than its two predecessors&#146;; Brown, <span class="italic">For the Islands I Sing</span>, 173) is one of many instances in which he made clear his opposition to the doctrine of progress. That opposition was memorably spelt out in <span class="italic">An Orkney Tapestry</span> (1969):<blockquote>There is a new religion, Progress, in which we all devoutly believe, and it is concerned only with material things in the present and in a vague golden-handed future. It is a rootless utilitarian faith, without beauty or mystery; a kind of blind unquestioning belief that men and their material circumstances will go on improving until some kind of nirvana is reached and everyone will be rich, free, fulfilled, well-informed, masterful. &hellip; I feel that this religion is in great part a delusion, and will peter out in the marsh. A community like Orkney dare not cut itself off from its roots and sources. (Brown, <span class="italic">Orkney Tapestry</span>, 20&#150;21)</blockquote>Against this trend he emphasized the simplicity of traditional Orkney life, the interpenetration of past and present, and the ceremonies of Catholicism. In his later years he softened his vehemence against progress (even eventually owning a black and white television) but insisted on the necessity to &#145;keep people in touch with their roots and sources&#146;  (Murray, 42).<br>
<br>Brown's last novel, <span class="italic">Beside the Ocean of Time</span> (1994), won the Saltire Scottish Book of the Year award and was shortlisted for the 1994 Booker prize. All his novels are deeply characteristic of their author, as are his plays; nevertheless, it is as a short-story writer that his finest achievement outside his verse lies. His plays, by his own acknowledgement lacking true theatrical vitality, contain much excellent writing: &#145;I think they're probably better read than seen on the stage&#146;  (Murray, 34&#150;5). He was a natural tale-teller, however, and his large body of short stories is a significant contribution to twentieth-century literature.<br>
<br>Brown was awarded an OBE in 1974 and became a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1977. He was awarded honorary degrees by the Open University (MA, 1976), the University of Dundee (LLD, 1977), and the University of Glasgow (DLitt, 1985).<br>
<br>Just as, by and large, he felt no call to move beyond Orkney in his quest for things to write about, so in real life Brown seems to have disliked travelling outside his familiar northern landscape. Despite the happiness of his time at Newbattle and Edinburgh, a city he came to love, Orkney was his only possible home. His sense of values and also his sense of Orkney were steeped in his response to the islands' past. That past, in which a simple way of life founded on farming and fishing changed little, as he saw it, over the millennia, was characterized by a striking historical narrative, especially in the viking period, and also by a religious richness and strength which reached a peak of holiness in the martyrdom of St Magnus on the island of Egilsay on Easter Monday 1117. The figure of Magnus was a potent one for Brown throughout his life, and one whose story he retold several times, most notably in <span class="italic">The Martyrdom of St Magnus</span>, an opera written in collaboration with his friend the composer Peter Maxwell Davies. Closely associated with Brown from the time of his first visit to Orkney in 1970, Davies set many of Brown's works and with Brown's help founded the St Magnus Festival in 1977. Imaginative and spiritual elements were further bound together for Brown in the distinctive literary achievement of <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> (written early in the thirteenth century), a work which not only provided him with much literary inspiration, but also helped him discern a significance in his obscure corner of the globe which he communicated to the rest of the world through his writing.<br>
<br>After his mother's death Brown lived in a council flat at 3 Mayburn Court, Stromness; his writing desk was the kitchen table and he wrote at it every morning with the self-discipline of a craftsman. He had a weekly column in <span class="italic">The Orcadian</span> newspaper, which he continued to write up until the last week of his life. All who knew him stress his gentleness, his shyness, his reticence, though those close to him also recall his strong sense of humour. He never married.<br>
<br>Brown's features were striking, often described as &#145;craggy&#146;. Photographs from his final years show how severe his health problems had become. An operation for cataract in 1988 was followed by one for cancer in 1990. His death certificate lists several problems, including kidney and heart failure possibly brought about by the onset of bronchitis. He died in Balfour Hospital, Kirkwall, on 13 April 1996. Peter Maxwell Davies's sixth symphony, completed on the day of Brown's death, is dedicated to him. George Mackay Brown was buried in Stromness kirkyard on 16 April, St Magnus's day.<br>
