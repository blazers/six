<span class="headword">Kirby <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Gregg]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1817&#150;1893), <span class="occ">writer on natural history</span>, was the second of five children of John Kirby (<i>d</i>. 1848), a prosperous Leicester hosiery manufacturer, and Sarah Bentley, an invalid whose death in 1835 left Mary and her elder sister in charge of the household. Religion and education were family priorities; Mrs Kirby took the children to Robert Hall's Baptist chapel and Mary was sent to schools in Market Harborough and Leicester. Mary also received instruction in languages from a family friend and went to lectures at the local mechanics' institute.<br>
<br>Seaside holidays at Ramsgate first shaped Mary Kirby's interest in collecting and studying plants, and local flora later became her focus. In 1840, recuperating from an injury, she spent time in Charnwood Forest near Loughborough, and botany was both an occupation and a resource. She became caught up in the mid-century &#145;botanical mania&#146;. Aided by clergyman&#150;naturalist Andrew Bloxam she compiled and edited the first <span class="italic">Flora of Leicestershire</span>, issued as a preliminary list in 1848 with blank pages for local botanists to enter records and observations. The definitive issue in 1850 groups more than 900 flowering plants and ferns according to the orders of the natural system, and cites localities and details about habitats. Notes of general and medical interest were prepared by Mary Kirby's youngest sister, <a name="cosubject_15644"></a><span class="headword">Elizabeth Kirby</span>  (1823&#150;1873)<span class="occ"></span>, to &#145;enlist the sympathies of some readers who feel little or no interest in botanical science&#146;.<br>
<br>After the death of John Kirby in 1848 the unmarried Kirby sisters were able to stay for two years rent-free in the family home in Friar Lane, Leicester, and later obtained the freehold. Long-term economic planning was necessary, however, and Mary and Elizabeth began to &#145;plot and plan for book-writing&#146;  (M. Kirby, 70). With Mary's botanical knowledge and Elizabeth's writing skills, they embarked on a career as joint authors of juvenile and natural history books.<br>
<br>Mary and Elizabeth Kirby worked as a sisterly writing team for twenty-five years, and produced a steady stream of more than twenty-five publications that included illustrated books, serial tales for magazines, school books, and fiction of an improving kind. In <span class="italic">The Discontented Children, and how they were Cured</span> (1854), their first original story book, the children of a gentleman and a gamekeeper are given the opportunity to experience each other's lives; the rustic children, restored to their parents after adventures and hardships, were &#145;only too happy to find themselves once more among their equals and in their proper station&#146;. The second edition, in 1859, contains illustrations by Phiz. Their natural history books, written principally for young readers, were informational rather than moralizing. <span class="italic">Plants of the Land and Water</span> (1857), one of two of their books issued in the <span class="roman">Observing Eye</span> series, presents botanical information and &#145;curious facts&#146; about the uses of plants, in the form of &#145;Short and Entertaining Chapters on the Vegetable World&#146;. Their books on insects were <span class="italic">Caterpillars, Butterflies, and Moths</span> (1857) and <span class="italic">Sketches of Insect Life</span> (1874). <span class="italic">The Sea and its Wonders</span> (1873), with short informational chapters on topics such as the Gulf Stream and the turtle, aimed to &#145;allure&#146; the young reader to study &#145;the great book of Nature, rather than to perplex him with a strictly scientific arrangement&#146;. <span class="italic">Chapters on Trees</span> (1873), a &#145;Popular Account of Their Nature and Uses&#146;, aims for a general rather than juvenile readership, and is well stocked with botanical information as well as history and folklore about trees from around the world.<br>
<br>During their long and successful joint career as Victorian professional women writers, the Kirby sisters published with Thomas Jarrold, Griffith and Farran, Thomas Nelson, and Routledge. Mary Kirby wrote that &#145;Earned money seems always the sweetest and best of any; and we were glad to find a ready sale for our manuscripts, and also to put the profits into our pockets&#146;  (M. Kirby, 165). She recalls in her autobiography that they once wrote:<blockquote>a humourous piece of what would happen a hundred years hence; how the men would be thrust out from all the professions by the women, and even the government of the country would be carried on by women, and in the houses of parliament there would not be a man to be seen. (ibid., 126)</blockquote>Mary and Elizabeth Kirby lived in Norwich and Great Yarmouth after 1855. Elizabeth was in delicate mental health, but they maintained a regular writing schedule. On 1 August 1860 Mary, aged forty-three, married Henry Gregg (<i>d</i>. 1881), curate of a church in Norwich, with Elizabeth as a witness. The sisters bought the living of Brooksby, Leicestershire, for Gregg, and they all lived together in Melton Mowbray in Six Elms, a house built for them. Mary and Elizabeth continued writing their books together, and the latter also issued four titles separately: <span class="italic">Steps Up the Ladder, or, The Will and the Way</span> (1862), <span class="italic">Dame Buckle and her Pet Johnny</span> (1867), <span class="italic">Lost Cities Brought to Light</span> (1871), and <span class="italic">Margaret's Choice</span> (1872). She died on 23 June 1873, at Six Elms.<br>
<br>Mary Kirby was widowed in 1881, and money troubles ensued. Her autobiography, <span class="italic">Leaflets from my Life: a Narrative Biography</span> (1887), a rich source book of local history and mid-nineteenth-century social history, is filled with detail about family connections and social routines in the middle-class household of her youth and adult life. She died on 15 October 1893 at her home in Melton Mowbray, aged seventy-six, and was buried in the same grave as her husband and her sister near the wall of the Brooksby church. Her will, dated 27 January 1891, left an estate of &pound;730 to her only surviving sister, Mme Katharine Coulin.<br>
