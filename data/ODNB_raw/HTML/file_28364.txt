<span class="headword">Waad, Sir  William</span>  (1546&#150;1623), <span class="occ">diplomat and administrator</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28363/', "Armagil Waad (d. 1568)")</script>, clerk of the privy council, and his first wife, Alice Patten (<i>d</i>. 1557/8). He attended Gray's Inn in 1571. Waad's entr&eacute;e to Elizabethan officialdom was his father's old friend and patron, William Cecil, who provided support, patronage, and, by 1572, a place in his household for the young William. In return for Cecil's help, which included the vicarage of Hynton, Chester, and sponsorship of his continental travels in the 1570s, Waad gave unstinting allegiance to the Cecilian faction. While he travelled, he functioned as a key correspondent of the lord treasurer. He visited most of Europe, including a long stay in Italy, and then became for a time in 1576&#150;7 a part of Sir William Paulet's embassy at Paris. In what capacity he served is indeterminable, but he seemed to have had a quasi-secretarial role. Later, at Sir Henry Cobham's insistence, Waad joined Cobham's residency in Paris, where he served from 1580 to 1581 as the ambassador's contact with the French court and did &#145;accomplements&#146; with other ambassadors for Cobham. It was ideal diplomatic training. But while Paulet had praised the younger man's &#145;discretion, honesty and many good parts&#146;, Cobham was less eulogistic&#151;there was seemingly a personality conflict between them&#151;and Waad, though he stayed in Paris, separated himself from the entourage  (<span class="italic">CSP for.</span>, 11, no. 1162; 15.133). He did, however, continue both to gather intelligence for the government and to pursue schemes involving the various Portuguese pretenders, an interest that earlier contacts had cultivated. He was to remain a key Elizabethan gatherer of foreign intelligence throughout the reign.<br>
<br>Languages, including French, Italian, and Latin, extensive travel abroad, associations with serving ambassadors, and an apparent negotiating skill led to repeated employment overseas for Waad. It was as an independent diplomatic agent that he served Elizabeth most distinguishedly and certainly most arduously. His key assignments were about as unpalatable as any in the reign. In 1584, for instance, he was the one designated to go to Spain to explain to King Philip why his ambassador, Bernardino de Mendoza, had been expelled from England. Not only was Waad treated with scant courtesy in Madrid, but the Spanish king, perhaps in retaliation for Elizabeth's two-year isolation of Mendoza in London, refused Waad an audience. Instead, Philip's secretary, Idiaquez, requested the envoy's letters to his master, which Waad refused to surrender except in person to the king. The king arbitrarily resolved the impasse by immediately issuing Waad his return passport. With this curt dismissal the ambassador left, having been prevented from explaining Mendoza's machinations, Elizabeth's great forbearance in the face of the Spaniard's provocative actions, and the English desire to preserve amity with Spain. As had often been the case before, the king gave as his excuse for refusing audience that he wanted nothing to do with an ambassador reputed to be a &#145;great heretic, being a Puritan, even worse than a Calvinist&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Venice</span>, 7, no. 87). The religious characterization of Waad, judging from his will, seems entirely accurate. It was, at any rate, such mutual intolerance, the breakdown of communications, and the continuation of what could only be characterized as diplomatic warfare that led ultimately to more open hostilities.<br>
<br>In January 1587 Waad travelled as a special ambassador to France to explain to the French court why Mary, queen of Scots, had just been executed. Again, it was a trying mission. Waad, however, was as sound a choice as any: he was familiar with France, and he had been the one sent by Elizabeth to Chartley to seize Queen Mary's papers, which contained the ultimate proof on which her conviction was based. He thus had inside information about the case and could be uniquely persuasive in his presentation. He did in fact mute French objections to this treatment of a former French queen by demonstrating that Mary had unequivocally, in her last years, cast her lot with Spain. A secondary aspect of his mission&#151;to resolve mutual shipping seizures&#151;saw some progress. Thus what began as another diplomatic fiasco&#151;the ambassador was barred from court, and blamed for harsh feelings engendered by the unwelcome news he bore&#151;ended on a modestly successful official note for the English. Waad was personally misused on his return journey by the Catholic duc d'Aumale, who detained him and seized his letters, diplomatic immunity notwithstanding.<br>
<br>Waad had substantial preparation for his challenging diplomatic assignments. Besides touring the continent in the 1570s and his service with the English legation in Paris, he performed several minor diplomatic chores. He was joined, in June 1581, by Lord Willoughby in a mission to bestow the Garter on the Danish king. In this embassy he was but a minor functionary and the ambassador's mouthpiece, commuting frequently between the Danish court and the ambassador's lodgings to settle various points of disagreement before the investiture ceremony on 14 August. In April 1583, now a clerk of the privy council through the joint sponsorship of Burghley and Walsingham (whose secretary he had briefly been in 1581), Waad went to Vienna to protest at the withdrawal of English trade privileges by the Hanse towns. He was received most courteously by the imperial court, but the mission was fruitless, apparently both because the emperor considered the dispute beyond his jurisdiction and because of German distaste for the English Merchant Adventurers. In yet another mission, in March 1585, Waad required of the French king the surrender of the English conspirator, Thomas Morgan, whose treasons in England made him a much sought felon. He received kind words from Henry III, but the king apparently did not return Morgan. For his efforts, Waad was beaten by Catholic sympathizers in France during his return journey to England, again in contravention of international law.<br>
<br>A potentially much more important assignment had been proposed in early 1580, immediately after the death of Cardinal Henry of Portugal, which had thrown open the question of the Portuguese succession. While Waad's official instructions exist, there is no evidence that he ever undertook this mission to the two pretenders to the throne, the duke of Braganza and Dom Antonio. Waad nevertheless continued his involvement with Portuguese affairs throughout the rest of his life, especially schemes involving Dom Antonio, and he became in fact the recognized Elizabethan expert on the area, succeeding Thomas Wilson in that role.<br>
<br>In all Waad conducted four independent missions, but this aspect of his career concluded after 1587. He remained at home, where his clerkship increasingly involved him in the pursuit of dissidents and subversives. He became the terror of the English recusants, and particularly of the foreign Jesuits sent into England. &#145;Lord Chief Justice Popham is in circuit&#146;, a Mr Cordale commented in 1595, &#145;but William Waad keeps the papists in line&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1598&#150;1601</i>, 253). His was the unsavoury but diligently executed task of ferreting out and then examining, often under torture, men suspected of treasonous intent. No major conspiracy after 1585&#151;whether the Lopez plot, the Babington plot, the Essex rebellion, the trial of Ralegh, the Gunpowder Plot, the Main plot, the Bye plot, or others&#151;failed in some way to involve his investigations. He was also involved with many rather more minor interrogations and committees of inquiry.<br>
<br>Besides serving as something of the English counterpart to the Spanish grand inquisitor, Waad also had responsibilities for provisioning the English army in the Low Countries and in Ireland. Here he was the successor of his diplomatic colleague, Sir Thomas Wilkes, but soon found himself involved in massive controversy over both alleged speculation and incompetence. As with almost any Elizabethan official, Waad claimed, in 1593, that the Cecilian connection had borne little fruit and that his official services were negligibly rewarded; but a variety of farms, grants, and licences associated with his name argue otherwise. Probably his most notable patent was the monopoly to manufacture sulphur, brimstone, and oil. Certainly his wealth in an inflationary age would suggest that the niggardly Elizabethan reward system had not unduly slighted him.<br>
<br>Waad served in parliament for the duchy of Lancaster boroughs of Aldeburgh (1585), Thetford (1589), and Preston (1601), and he also represented the Cornish borough of West Looe in 1604, undoubtedly all through the influence either of the Cecil faction or Walsingham. He made little mark on parliamentary proceedings. He was also a justice of the peace for both Middlesex, from 1591, probably until his death, and Kent, by 1592, and served on various county commissions.<br>
<br>Strongly allied with Robert Cecil, and indispensable to the government as an intelligencer and in his covert operations, Waad remained active when King James acceded to the throne. Knighted almost immediately (20 May 1603) after the king arrived in England, he also received, in a particularly apt appointment, the lieutenancy of the Tower. In this capacity he continued to pursue interrogations, and was, perhaps most famously, the gaoler of Sir Walter Ralegh, with whom he had repeated misunderstandings. In 1613, however, having lost Cecilian protection when Salisbury died the previous year, and in the face of the attacks of the many enemies his past activities had earned, Waad was forced to surrender his position. The charge against him, probably specious, was that he had both embezzled jewels belonging to his charge, Lady Arabella Stuart, and that he had allowed too much freedom while guarding her. He retired thereafter to the patrimonial Belsize House in Hampstead to pursue his private interests, which, like his father's, included a sizeable interest in the New World. He was, for instance, a member of the governing council for the Virginia Company and an investor in the purchase of the island of Bermuda.<br>
<br>Despite Waad's prominent involvement in state affairs, his personality&#151;hard-edged and querulous as it must have been to pursue his interrogation tasks so successfully and repeatedly&#151;precluded him from attaining anything more than modest stature in the realm. In his correspondence he is certainly periodically at odds with various colleagues, and the enemies, some well placed in the realm, that his interrogations created may be imagined. He nevertheless profited by his activities, and in a moralistic will giving clear evidence of his puritan inclinations he left a sizeable estate to his son James (a godson of the king) and to his second wife, Anne, whom he married probably in 1599, a daughter of Sir Humphrey Browne. He had previously married, in 1586, another Anne (<i>d</i>. 1589), a daughter of Owen Waller of London. He died in October 1623 at Battles Hall in Essex, another of his estates, and was buried in nearby Maunden church, where his noteworthy tomb was restored in the late nineteenth century.<br>
