<span class="headword">Donkin,  Bryan</span>  (1768&#150;1855), <span class="occ">inventor and engineer</span>, was born at Fountain Hall, near Sandoe in Northumberland, on 22 March 1768. He was the third son of a family of eight and his father, John Donkin, an acquaintance of John Smeaton, was a land agent and surveyor for a number of estates, including those of the duke of Northumberland and the Errington family. The young Donkin's aptitude for engineering was apparent in childhood; there are accounts of him, as a boy, spending almost all his spare time in the smiths' and carpenters' shops of the estates managed by his father. It was intended that he should follow his father's profession, and in 1788 he moved to Sevenoaks in Kent, where for two years he acted as agent for the duke of Dorset at Knowle Park. When he became dissatisfied with his position, he consulted Smeaton, who advised him to serve an apprenticeship with a Dartford millwright, John Hall. In 1798 Donkin married Mary Brame (<i>d</i>. 1858), the daughter of a Flemish refugee; they had three sons, <a href="#cosubject_7811">John [<i>see below</i>]</a>, Bryan, and Thomas, all of whom entered the family firm.<br>
<br>Donkin's career path can be described as following three overlapping activities: inventor, developer of other people's inventions, and engineering consultant. His first major venture was the development of the Fourdrinier paper making machine. In 1799 a French mechanic, Louis Robert, invented a crude machine for making paper; this was taken to England by John Gamble, who assigned his patent of 1801 to Henry and Sealy Fourdrinier, who ran a successful London stationery firm. John Hall, who had business contacts with the Fourdriniers, was invited to develop the invention and he passed the project to Donkin. In 1802 Donkin began the development work, initially at Hall's plant and then at a new works at Spa Lane, Bermondsey, financed by the Fourdriniers, which was completed in April 1803. In 1807 Donkin leased the Bermondsey works and began to produce the machines on a royalty basis. By 1812 nineteen machines had been sold, a number that had increased to 191 by 1850. Although the original idea was not Donkin's the development work on the machine was due to him, and the merit of his work was recognized by the award of a gold medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Throughout the development phase of the paper making machine Donkin was actively engaged in other enterprises. His two most notable inventions of this period were a steel nib pen, patented in 1808, and a tachometer which he submitted to the Society of Arts in 1810 and which was awarded its gold medal. He was also involved in three other major projects, concerned with printing, canning, and scientific instrument making. In 1813, with Richard Mackenzie Bacon, a Norwich journalist and musician, he secured a patent for an improved printing machine. The machine was adopted by the Cambridge University Press but was not successful. Donkin's subsequent activities in printing were more significant; in 1820, with Sir William Congreve and John Wilks, his then partner, he contrived a method of printing stamps in two colours, and further work was commissioned from the excise and stamp office and by the East India Company at Calcutta.<br>
<br>Donkin has been described as the father of modern canning. In 1795 a Parisian confectioner, Fran&ccedil;ois Appert, had invented a method of preserving food in glass jars. An English patent was taken out in 1810 by Peter Durrant, a merchant, and this was acquired by Donkin, Hall, and Gamble for &pound;1000. The three men formed a company with Donkin in charge of the development work at Bermondsey, where he established the first British cannery. His innovation was to use tinned containers in conjunction with a new preservation process. In order to achieve complete sterilization, which Appert's process had failed to do, Donkin heated meat in tin cans very gradually in a bath of chloride of lime. By 1813 he felt sufficiently confident to submit samples to the prince regent for tasting; given the novel nature of the product the latter rather surprisingly agreed, and his approval was a major marketing factor in the innovation's success. A quantity of meat was supplied to the Royal Navy, and an office was opened in Cornhill and depots established in the seaport towns. Donkin's tinned meat was taken by Sir James Ross in 1829, and by Sir John Franklin in 1845, on their Arctic expeditions. Donkin himself appears to have lost interest in the project once the development problems had been tackled, but there is no doubting his vital contribution to modern canning.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Donkin was interested in astronomy, and in 1808&#150;9 he collaborated with the scientific instrument maker Edward Troughton on the construction of the first mural circle for the Royal Greenwich Observatory. Donkin undertook the precision casting and machining of the large sections of this, and other astronomical apparatus and standards of length, for Troughton and subsequently for his successors, Troughton and Simms. He was a member of the Royal Astronomical Society, and he passed his enthusiasm on to his sons. He was an expert in the use of micrometers and was best known to astronomers for his dividing engine and spring level. On 6 April 1831, in the absence of Sir James South, he chaired the meeting at which the Astronomical Society was granted its royal charter.<br>
<br>An important spin-off from Donkin's work was his development of metal working tools, such as lathes, drills, and gear cutting engines. He stands alongside pioneer engineers, such as Maudslay and Bramah, who helped establish London as a major engineering centre. His growing reputation led him to be involved increasingly as a consultant on civil engineering projects, to be invited to give evidence before parliamentary select committees, and to act as an arbitrator when government money was used to finance innovatory projects. Thus Donkin was involved with Thomas Telford in the latter's Caledonian Canal project, supplying the engine and machinery for a dredger; he was in frequent consultation with Marc Isambard Brunel over the design of shields and pumping machinery for the Thames Tunnel Company; was called as an expert witness before the select committee on artisans and machinery in 1824; and was commissioned to make an estimate of the development costs of Charles Babbage's calculating machine. Donkin was among those instrumental in founding the Institution of Civil Engineers; he served as a member of its council for the first time in 1822, and was vice-president from 1826 to 1832, and again from 1835 to 1845. In 1828 when the institution sought its first royal charter, the cost of which was 300 guineas, Telford and Donkin advanced it 200 and 100 guineas respectively. Donkin's son Bryan became president in 1872, and his great-grandson in 1949. As early as 1803 Donkin was elected a member of the Society of Arts, and in 1807 was appointed as chair of the committee of mechanics and vice-president of the society. On 18 January 1836 Donkin was elected a fellow of the Royal Society and served repeatedly on its council. He finally retired from business in 1846, but continued to play a role in his local community, acting as a magistrate in Surrey until shortly before his death. He died at his home, 6 The Paragon, New Kent Road, London, on 27 February 1855.<br>
<br>His son <a name="cosubject_7811"></a><span class="headword">John Donkin</span>  (1802&#150;1854), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born at Dartford, Kent, on 20 May 1802. He was a partner with his father and John Wilks, and took part in many of their inventions. He became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1824 and was also a fellow of the Geological Society. He married Caroline, daughter of Benjamin Hawes; they had seven children. He died at Roseacre, near Maidstone, on 20 April 1854.<br>
