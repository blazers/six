<span class="headword">Pease,  John William Beaumont</span>, first Baron Wardington  (1869&#150;1950), <span class="occ">banker</span>, was born at Pendower, West Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 4 July 1869, the second son of the banker John William Pease (1836&#150;1901) and his wife, Helen Mary Fox (1838&#150;1928), both Quakers. He was educated at Marlborough School (1878&#150;83) and then at New College, Oxford. A gifted sportsman, he was awarded a blue for both golf and lawn tennis.<br>
<br>Pease was a member of the leading business dynasty in the north-east of England responsible for the projection and management of the pioneering Stockton and Darlington Railway and the foundation of interlocking industrial interests embracing woollen textiles, coalmining, engineering, and metallurgical products. The Peases were related by marriage to other Quaker families with commercial interests, principally the Backhouses, Gurneys, and Foxes, and in that connection had founded a private banking partnership in the late eighteenth century which acted as the clearing house for the Peases' own concerns and also as a vehicle for the raising of capital. In this latter context the history of the Pease family is a testament to the strength of the Quaker credit network in mobilizing capital resources for industrial ventures.<br>
<br>Pease's father was a partner in the family bank in Darlington, but in 1859 he moved to Newcastle upon Tyne to become a partner in the banking firm of Hodgkin, Barnett, Pease, Spence &amp; Co. This firm was founded in the wake of the collapse of the Northumberland and Durham District Bank in 1857, an event which precipitated the bankruptcy of the heavily indebted Derwent Iron Company located at Consett. As a major traffic-sender on the Stockton and Darlington Railway, there can be little doubt that Pease's father was propelled northwards to participate in the management of a new banking concern which was expected to play a leading role in the reconstruction of the iron company. This was achieved in 1864 with the foundation of the Consett Iron Company.<br>
<br>Pease himself became a partner in Hodgkin Barnett Pease Spence in the early 1890s, and as senior partner he was to play the leading role in negotiating a merger with Lloyds Bank in 1902. As a prosperous local bank possessing an extensive branch network in the north-east of England, Hodgkin Barnett Pease Spence had some claim to preferment within Lloyds' managerial structure and, after the formal amalgamation in 1903, Pease was elected to the London board of Lloyds. By 1910 he had risen to the position of deputy chairman and in 1922, following the death of Sir Richard Vassar-Smith, he succeeded to the chairmanship. He remained in office until December 1945, a period of service equalling the combined total of his three successors.<br>
<br>In the inter-war period Pease was perhaps better known as a talented amateur golfer than as a banker; he was invariably in contention for the UK amateur championship, and served latterly as chairman of the championship committee. On 6 April 1923 he married Dorothy Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1993), the daughter of Lord Forster, governor-general of Australia, and the widow of the Hon. Harold Lubbock. They had two sons, Christopher Henry Beaumont (<i>b</i>. 1924) and William Simon (<i>b</i>. 1925). The elder son became a partner in the leading stockbroking firm of Hoare Govett.<br>
<br>Pease was notable for his conservative and orthodox policies while chairman of Lloyds, and during his tenure of office the bank developed a reputation for over-caution. Indeed, between the wars Lloyds' share of deposits and advances declined in relation to those of the other large clearing banks, indicating some loss of competitiveness. Presiding over the board with authority and dignity, Pease nevertheless discouraged discussion, so that board meetings tended to be rubber-stamp affairs. However, as a leading banker he owed his considerable reputation to his qualities of impeccable integrity and honesty. He was appointed chairman of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers and also served as president of the British Bankers' Association. In 1936 his services to banking were recognized in his elevation to the peerage as Baron Wardington, of Alnmouth, Northumberland. He died at Wardington Manor, Wardington, near Banbury, on 7 August 1950, and was cremated in Oxford on 14 August.<br>
