<span class="headword">Savile, Sir  George</span>, seventh baronet  (<em>bap. </em>1678, <em>d.</em> 1743), <span class="occ">landowner and politician</span>, was born at Thornhill, near Wakefield in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and was baptized there on 18 February 1678, the first of three surviving children, and only son, of John Savile (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1640, <i>d</i>. 1700/01), the rector of Thornhill's parish church of St Michael, and his second wife, Barbara, the daughter of Thomas Jenison (Jennison) of Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>Savile matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 4 July 1696, and in March the following year was admitted a student of the Middle Temple in London. It was while he was studying there in 1700 that the death occurred without male issue of his distant cousin <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24746/', "William Savile, second marquess of Halifax")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24735/', "Savile, George, first marquess of Halifax")</script>]. The failure of the senior, ennobled Savile line, the descendants of Sir George Savile, first baronet (1549/50&#150;1622), and his first wife, meant that the estates and baronetcy now reverted to Sir George's descendants from his second wife. The next available male heir, John Savile, a bachelor cousin of Savile's father, succeeded as sixth baronet, but it was young George Savile who, in accordance with the second marquess's will, inherited the lion's share of the great Halifax estates with an annual income of &pound;6000. The estates consisted of extensive lands, including collieries and lead mines, in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, though in future years these were subject to some depletion by the obligation to provide portions for the second marquess's four daughters. Savile's principal residence, Rufford Abbey in Nottinghamshire, had been considerably extended into a large country house by the first marquess. When in London he resided in Golden Square until 1722, and thereafter in St James's Street.<br>
<br>On the death of the sixth baronet in 1704 (precisely when is not known) Savile succeeded to the baronetcy. He declined an invitation in February that year to stand in the by-election for Nottinghamshire, unflattered by appeals that he would be an ideal candidate. He served as sheriff for the county during 1706&#150;7 and was appointed one of its deputy lieutenants in 1715. Savile saw himself in the mould of a typical country squire, steeped in the traditional field sports of hunting and shooting rather than the refined pursuits of dancing, fencing, and elegant horsemanship. In 1721 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, an honour that was probably intended to salute him as the heir of the first marquess of Halifax, one of the instrumental figures of the 1688 revolution, and thus a protector of rational inquiry against superstition.<br>
<br>At St James's Church, Westminster, on 19 December 1722, Savile married Mary, the sixteen-year-old daughter, officially, of John Pratt of Dublin and Cabra Castle, co. Cavan, who was deputy vice-treasurer of Ireland, although she was reputedly the daughter of Henry Petty, earl of Shelburne. The marriage produced a son, Savile's heir and eventual successor, George [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24736/', "Savile, Sir George, eighth baronet")</script>], and two daughters, the younger of whom, Barbara, was to marry Richard Lumley, fourth earl of Scarbrough, in 1752. Savile's marriage was to have brought him &pound;10,000 but he was &#145;cheated&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont Diary</span>, 2.223) of half the sum, probably by his father-in-law who was also found to have embezzled the Irish Treasury and was arrested in 1725. Despite Savile's hope that he &#145;might live a virtuous life with respect to women&#146;  (ibid.) his marriage did not meet his expectations and was not destined to last.<br>
<br>In May 1728 Savile reluctantly accepted an invitation to stand in a by-election as member of parliament for Yorkshire following the elevation to the peerage of Sir Thomas Watson-Wentworth. He was an odd choice for England's largest county, being a non-resident landowner, but Watson-Wentworth, Savile's friend and kinsman and one of the great powers in the county, urged its other leading whigs that he knew no one more appropriate, and so Savile was elected in June without a contest. After taking his seat in the House of Commons at the beginning of 1729, and despite ill-health brought on by the colds and fatigues of long committee sessions, Savile proved himself a whig of strong &#145;independent&#146; mind, liable to support or oppose the ministry according to his own view of the merits of each issue. As with many other independent whigs, the ministers were anxious to regard him as a &#145;friend&#146; and assiduously courted him with lavish hospitality.<br>
<br>Savile was not a particularly active MP, but in February 1731 he presented petitions from the grand juries of the three Yorkshire ridings, each complaining of the use of Latin in legal proceedings and transactions as a frequent cause of abuse and fraud by lawyers. He chaired the resultant committee and spoke at length, when reporting to the house on 22 February, against the pernicious effects of &#145;dog latin, tautologies and nonsensical English&#146; in legal usage, a state of affairs that had turned &#145;our boasted liberty and property into a jest&#146;  (Notts. Arch., DDSR 219/21). The bill, which Savile subsequently managed through its closely argued stages in the Commons, replaced Latin with English as the official language of the law, and after further debate in the Lords it received the royal assent on 7 May (4 George II c. 26). Although originating in the complaints of his constituents in Yorkshire, where there was a rapidly developing commercial and industrial sector, Savile's bill played an important part in the &#145;country&#146; attack during these years on the nation's legal institutions. But it was also in itself a landmark measure which at a stroke brought about a revolutionary change in the character of all legal proceedings.<br>
<br>In the election of 1734 Savile initially agreed to stand but then withdrew, pleading ill-health and the difficulty of his living outside the county. In 1735 he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of the West Riding. The next two years were clouded by the final breakdown of his marriage. Several years previously his wife had formed a liaison with a neighbouring Nottinghamshire gentleman and MP, William Levinz, but despite Savile's strenuous efforts at reconciliation, the Saviles had permanently separated by early 1737 when Lady Savile was reported to be living with her mother and Lord Shelburne. Savile continued to spend each winter and spring in London, and was a member of the court of St George's Hospital near Hyde Park. He died on 16 September 1743 and was buried at his family's ancestral resting place, St Michael's Church, at Thornhill, Yorkshire, on 25 September.<br>
