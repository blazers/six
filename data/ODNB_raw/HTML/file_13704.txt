<span class="headword">Hooper,  Edmund</span>  (<em>c.</em>1553&#150;1621), <span class="occ">organist and composer</span>, was born in Halberton, near Tiverton, Devon. He was brought up at nearby Bradninch, and at Greenwich, where he received his schooling. By 1582 he had joined the choir of Westminster Abbey and on 3 December 1588 he succeeded Henry Leeve as master of the choristers. He was appointed abbey organist by patent dated 9 May 1606. His responsibilities included repairing the organ and copying music for the choir. The abbey muniments suggest that his appointment was not an unqualified success. In December 1603 there was indiscipline among the choristers, and Hooper may also have been involved in financial irregularities; in 1606 he was relieved of the teaching of the choristers. He remained as organist, however, and the patent renewing his organist's post for life, which was drawn up in 1616, refers to his &#145;good and faithful service&#146;  (Shaw, 328). On 1 March 1604 he was sworn in as a gentleman of the Chapel Royal, holding this post in plurality with that at Westminster. He received part of the salary due to John Bull, the first Chapel Royal musician to be entitled organist, when Bull left to work abroad in 1613. In an entry dated 2 November 1615 in the Chapel Royal cheque book Hooper is named as joint organist with Orlando Gibbons, although he may already have been partially performing the functions of that office for several years.<br>
<br>Except for a small number of keyboard pieces, Hooper's surviving music is exclusively for liturgical use. Much of it is in the &#145;verse&#146; style, exploiting soloists in addition to full choir. The presence of his compositions in virtually every pre-Restoration source of Anglican church music attests to their popularity. Several of his more elaborate works, such as &#145;Hearken, ye nations&#146; (for gunpowder treason day) and &#145;O God of Gods&#146; (for the anniversary of the king's accession), are incomplete. He contributed two pieces to Sir William Leighton's <span class="italic">Teares or Lamentacions of a Sorrowful Soule</span> (1614), and three anthems were printed posthumously in John Barnard's <span class="italic">First Book of Selected Church Musick</span> (1641). Hooper died in London on 14 July 1621 and was interred two days later beside his first wife (who had died by 1604) in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey. His will, which dates from 1620, was proved on 31 July 1621 by his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1652). It contains a legacy to sixty-seven poor people, and probably reflects his age. Judging from other bequests of property and money, he would appear to have been a person of substance.<br>
