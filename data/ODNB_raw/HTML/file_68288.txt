<span class="headword">Galliardello,  Caesar</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1568, <em>d.</em> 1627), <span class="occ">musician</span>, was baptized in the London liberty of Holy Trinity Minories on 1 July 1568, second but only surviving son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68287/', "Mark Anthony Galliardello (d. 1585)")</script> and his wife, Margery (<i>d</i>. 1611). In 1585 Caesar inherited his father's place among the royal viols and violins, remaining in place until his death. He also inherited his father's trenchant protestant convictions, and was at once accepted into the ruling vestry of Holy Trinity. Though only seventeen, he was a signatory to the confirmation of new churchwardens in January 1586. In 1590 he was chosen one of the two collectors for the poor, but by January 1592 had left the parish, probably on his marriage to Elizabeth Cosyn (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1570), sister of the composer Benjamin Cosyn. Three children, Mark Anthony, Mary, and Judith, had been born by 1599, when Caesar and Elizabeth settled in Camberwell, Surrey. Here four more children were baptized: Susan, Martha, Edmund, and lastly Benjamin, on 23 October 1608.<br>
<br>Caesar Galliardello was one of the seven violinists who played at the funeral of Elizabeth I in 1603. Thereafter he climbed steadily through the ranks of the royal violins. With the death of Joseph Lupo in 1616 he may have become their leader.<br>
<br>By 21 May 1611, when a daughter was baptized there, the Galliardellos had returned to the Minories. Although Caesar was at once accepted back into the ruling vestry, serving as churchwarden in 1612, the ensuing years proved tragic. By 1627, when he made his will, Caesar had only two children living, Mary and Benjamin. Elizabeth, too, had died and Caesar had remarried.<br>
<br>Galliardello maintained links with Camberwell, however, in the process becoming a friend of the actor Edmund Alleyn, who founded Dulwich College within the parish in 1619. Alleyn's diary twice records the Galliardello family dining at Dulwich. It was presumably this friendship which led to Benjamin Cosyn's appointment as organist of Dulwich College in 1622.<br>
<br>Galliardello played at the funeral of James I in 1625, was again elected churchwarden of Holy Trinity, on 11 October 1626, and died in office in 1627. His will, drawn up on 14 September, begins with a trenchant protestant preamble. Like Shakespeare, he describes himself only as &#145;gentleman&#146;, making no reference to his profession, to musical instruments, or to manuscripts. His estate was divided between his second wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1641), and his son Benjamin. The will's principal witness was the veteran preacher Josias Nicholls, who thereafter lived on in the parish until 1635. Caesar Galliardello was buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity on 15 November 1627. His will was proved on 10 December following.<br>
