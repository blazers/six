<span class="headword">Dingane ka Senzangakhona</span>  (<em>c.</em>1798&#150;1840), <span class="occ">king of the Zulu</span>, born in the south-eastern corner of emaKhosini, Babanango district, Natal, was the son of Senzangakhona (<i>c</i>.1757&#150;1816), Zulu chief, and a junior wife, Mpikase. He spent his early manhood under his half-brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/54934/', "Shaka's")</script> reign. He served in the <i>amaWombe butho</i> (&#145;age-mate military unit&#146;) and accompanied Shaka on campaigns. In September 1828, he and his brother Mhlangana, in league with the <i>induna</i> Mbopha, assassinated Shaka. Dingane then had Mhlangana killed and dismissed Mbopha. Insecure and suspicious, he also killed some of Shaka's favourites and most of his own surviving brothers, but spared Mpande as ineffectual. Dingane was slothful and cunning but not astute. He lacked Shaka's urge to conquest, and loved pageantry and dancing. He had many concubines but never produced an heir. Under him the quality of the Zulu army declined, and although he apparently realized the importance of firearms he failed both to obtain them in sufficient numbers and to use them effectively.<br>
<br>Dingane initially halted campaigns and dissolved some <i>amabutho</i>. His kingdom was shaken, however, by the secession of the Qwabe chiefdom. Dingane then restored military discipline and resumed campaigning. His forces raided the Npondo and the Swazi, attacked Mzilikazi's Ndebele (Matabele) in the central Transvaal, and in September 1833 stormed the Portuguese fort at Delagoa Bay, Mozambique, and killed its governor.<br>
<br>Dingane was uneasy with the white traders at Port Natal (Durban) who harboured refugees from his kingdom. In 1835 they agreed to send refugees back in return for peace. Dingane also admitted missionaries to his kingdom. The agreement soon failed, however, and tense relations resumed.<br>
<br>From 1837 the Zulu kingdom was threatened by land-hungry Boers, with <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> attitudes and nineteenth-century firearms, on their great trek away from British ruled Cape Colony, who wanted to take Natal. On 6 November 1837 the trekker leader Pieter Retief arrived at Dingane's capital, Mgungundhlovu, to ask for Natal south of the Thukela (Tugela) for their republic, which the Port Natal traders had decided to join. Dingane knew that in January a trekker force had defeated Mzilikazi. He himself had then sent a second expedition against the Ndebele. To buy time Dingane promised the concession if Retief would recapture cattle taken by Chief Sekonyela. Retief first reported to the trekkers, who immediately began crossing the Drakensberg and settling in numerous camps, and then tricked Sekonyela into trying on a pair of handcuffs and ransomed him for Dingane's cattle. Before Retief returned to claim his reward Dingane learned that the trekkers had decisively defeated the Ndebele, driving them north towards modern Zimbabwe. Dingane apparently believed that only by destroying the trekkers while they were unprepared could he save his people from expropriation and massed his forces in preparation. On Retief's arrival Dingane reportedly signed a document assigning land in Natal. He tricked the Boers into attending a farewell dance without their arms, during which Retief and his companions were seized and killed. Dingane then sent his forces to destroy the trekkers in their camps. His masterstroke miscarried. The Zulu massacred the occupants of the first camps they encountered but gunfire gave the alarm to others, who drove them off. A large part of the trekkers' stock had been taken, however. They were confined to defensive laagers and short of a decisive victory would be forced to return over the Drakensberg. Dingane's position was further improved when the first trekker counter-attack was halted and routed by his army on 11 April 1838. An invasion by the Natal traders was also defeated and their settlement dispersed.<br>
<br>With the arrival of Andries Pretorius and his commandos from the Cape, the trekkers invaded the Zulu kingdom in December 1838. Dingane's army attacked their laager by the Ncome River, at the battle of Blood River, on 16 December. The Zulu were routed by Boer firepower and tactics, and sustained massive losses. Dingane then negotiated an agreement granting the Boers land south of the Tongati River. His half-brother Mpande rebelled and in September 1839, with his followers, crossed the Thukela and took refuge with the trekkers. In January 1840 Mpande's army, shadowed by a Boer force, marched into Zululand. The two Zulu armies fought at the Maqonqo hills (near Magudu in the far north of Zululand) on 29 January. Dingane's army, commanded by Ndlela, was defeated. Mpande then claimed the Zulu kingship. Ndlela, wounded, fled back to Dingane, who had him strangled. Dingane and his followers fled across the Pongola, north-east into the territory of Silevana of the Nyawo. Helped by a force of Dingane's enemies&#151;the Swazi, led by Sonyezane Dlamini&#151;Silevana attacked Dingane at night and mortally wounded him. Dingane died on 15 March 1840 at Esankoleni (near Golela on the Natal&#150;Swaziland border) and was buried there.<br>
<br>In Afrikaner mythology Dingane was the treacherous, murderous, savage villain; the anniversary of Blood River was long celebrated as Dingane's day. He was portrayed in three South African films, <span class="italic">De Voortrekker</span> (1916), <span class="italic">They Built a Nation</span> (1938), and <span class="italic">Die Voortrekkers</span> (1973), and sculpted on the frieze in the Voortrekker monument (1949) at Pretoria. Zulu also reviled his memory, both for his failure and for his treatment of the Cele and Qadi. Magema ka Magwaza, the Zulu historian, wrote, &#145;he had the heart of a dog and the nature of a witch. Dingane was truly like a poisonous snake&#146;  (Fuze, 17). Nevertheless, for all his cruelty and duplicity, arguably he had done the best he knew to save his kingdom and people.<br>
