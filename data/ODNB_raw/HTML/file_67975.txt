<span class="headword">Tucker,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1622?, <em>d.</em> 1679), <span class="occ">musician and composer</span>, may have been the son of Edmund Tucker, organist of Salisbury Cathedral, baptized there on 24 June 1622. Details of his education are unknown, although it is possible he may have been a chorister. After the Restoration William Tucker became a minor canon at Westminster Abbey, receiving instructions on 11 December 1660 to &#145;take the order of Priesthood the next ordination day being the 23<sup>rd</sup> of December&#146; so that he was eligible for the post  (chapter act book 3, fol. 27<i>v</i>). By April 1661 he was also a gentleman of the Chapel Royal. As a minor canon of Westminster he was entitled to a house in the abbey precincts: his wife was named Elizabeth, and four children were baptized or buried at the abbey between 1662 and 1670.<br>
<br>Tucker's surviving compositions, consisting of three services and a number of full and verse anthems, are competently written, straightforward works which circulated beyond London and Westminster to provincial cathedrals, but he is most important for the light his music copying casts on the wider history of Restoration sacred music, in particular the development of the major composers John Blow and Henry Purcell. In the year ending at Michaelmas 1677 he received &pound;20 &#145;for Coppying out some Musick bookes&#146; at Westminster Abbey  (Westminster Abbey muniments, 33712, fol. 5<i>v</i>) and on 15 February 1685 his widow, Elizabeth, was belatedly paid &pound;15 &#145;for her husband's writing in 15 Books the Anthems w<sup>th</sup> Symphonies for King Charles 2<sup>nds</sup> use in his Chappell Royall&#146;  (Ashbee, 5.272). Comparison of the ascriptions of Tucker's own works with his signature in the abbey precentor's book allows identification of his copying, in which he was sometimes assisted by two other scribes who wrote only words. The abbey payment was almost certainly for his contribution to the partbooks of the now incomplete Triforium set I; that at the Chapel Royal was for a set represented by two extant bass partbooks (BL, Add. MS 50860; Nanki Library, Tokyo, N-5/10). Further examples of Tucker's hand appear in the earliest layers of the Chapel Royal partbooks (BL, Royal Music 27.a.1&#150;8) and a Chapel Royal organ book (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, MU MS 152): he is also known to have made copies for Peterborough Cathedral in 1669&#150;70.<br>
<br>Tucker's death on 28 February 1679 provides a latest possible date for music in his hand, often limited still further by attributions to &#145;Mr&#146; John Blow, which must precede his doctorate, conferred on 10 December 1677, or by the probable completion of Tucker's work in Triforium set I by Michaelmas 1677. Several anthems by Purcell are thereby shown to be products of the composer's teenage years, most notably the symphony anthem &#145;My beloved spake&#146;. Tucker was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey on 1 March 1679, and administration of his estate was granted to Elizabeth by the court of the dean and chapter on 29 May.<br>
