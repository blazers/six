<span class="headword">Weguelin,  Thomas Matthias</span>  (1763/4&#150;1828), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Moorfields, London, was the eldest son of John Christopher Weguelin and his second wife, Elizabeth. He was appointed an East India Company cadet in March 1781 in the Bengal presidency. He arrived in Calcutta in April 1782, having been promoted ensign on 16 June 1781. He joined the 3rd European regiment at Burhanpur, and became a lieutenant on 22 September 1782. In November he was transferred to the 1st battalion, 22nd native infantry, at the frontier station of Fatehgarh in the dominions of the nawab of Oudh. In March 1783 he went to the Farrukhabad district, where he took part in some minor operations, and in 1796, when his regiment was incorporated with the 2nd native infantry, he received the brevet rank of captain.<br>
<br>Weguelin served against Tipu Sahib from 1790 to 1792 with Lieutenant-Colonel John Cockrell's detachment. He fought at the battle and siege of Seringapatam in 1791&#150;2. In December 1797 he was transferred to the 1st battalion, 13th native infantry, which he commanded in 1799 during the deposition of the nawab of Oudh, and shortly after joined the 1st European regiment at Cawnpore, removing with it to Dinapore at the close of the year. On 10 August 1801 he received the regimental rank of captain, and in September 1803 he went in command of the flank companies of his regiment to join the army under Lord Lake, then engaged with the Marathas in the north-west, where he took part in the siege of Gwalior. In September 1804 he accompanied Lake's army as judge-advocate-general in the field provinces north and west of Allahabad, and took part in the siege of Bharatpur. He held the post until his appointment to major on 3 March 1808.<br>
<br>In June Weguelin commanded an expedition to defend Macau against the French, with the local rank of colonel: he returned to Bengal in February 1809. On the establishment of the commissariat in Bengal on 1 February 1810 he was appointed deputy commissary-general. He accompanied Major-General Sir John Abercromby in the expedition against Mauritius in 1810 as head of the commissariat department, and after the capture of the island was appointed by the governor, Sir Robert Townsend Farquhar, commissary-general of Mauritius, Bourbon, and their dependencies. He returned to Bengal in March 1812. On 1 July 1812 he was nominated commissary-general of Bengal with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, attaining the regimental rank on 16 March 1814.<br>
<br>Weguelin was commissary-general through the two Nepal wars between 1814 and 1816, and that with the Pindaris from 1816 to 1818, so ably conducting his office that the extra expenses of the wars did not exceed the comparatively small sum of &pound;600,000. Obliged by private affairs to return to England, he resigned his office at the close of 1820, embarking in January 1822. He received the rank of colonel commandant on 20 July 1823.<br>
<br>Weguelin was twice married. He married at Calcutta on 26 January 1814 Miss Mary Cooper: they had a son and a daughter. He and his second wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 15 Sept 1856), had three sons. He also had, with Elizabeth Shaw, an illegitimate daughter. He died aged sixty-four at 25 Montagu Square, London, on 23 May 1828: a monument was placed in Marylebone church.<br>
