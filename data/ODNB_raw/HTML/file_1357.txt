<span class="headword">Bardelby,  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1332/3), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was probably the son of Thomas, son of Walter Bardelby; his family took its name from Barlby, near Selby, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Robert is first recorded in 1284, acting as attorney for a group of Yorkshiremen in king's bench. He may have acquired an ecclesiastical training as a means of rising in the service of the crown, for while in August 1286 Archbishop John Romanus of York described him as a clerk of legitimate birth and good character, holding no benefice in the diocese, in the same year he is also recorded as a chancery clerk, probably introduced by William Hamilton, who came from Brayton, a few miles from Barlby. In July 1291, by now a subdeacon, Bardelby was presented to his first benefice, Burghwallis, north of Doncaster. The means whereby he won promotion in chancery are usually undetectable, but his services were sufficiently valued for him to be excused attendance at the London hustings court in 1298, and an appearance before the archbishop of York in 1301, because he was engaged on the king's business. On 12 April 1302 he witnessed the charter whereby Roger (IV) Bigod, earl of Norfolk, made over nearly all his lands to Edward I, and by March 1303 he apparently stood first among the chancery clerks, after the chancellor and keeper of the rolls. He attended the Carlisle parliament of January&#150;March 1307, and on 19 April took charge of the great seal immediately after the death of his friend the chancellor William Hamilton. Not surprisingly, he received rewards from the crown for his services, starting with the living of Sandhurst, Kent, in 1294, and culminating in the prebend of Dunnington in York Minster in October 1305. Others, too, saw him as a man worth cultivating&#151;hence, no doubt, the yearly pension of 5 marks he came to receive from the templars.<br>
<br>The accession of Edward II did Bardelby's career no harm; indeed, it led to greater eminence. A feature of administrative practice during the reign is the number of occasions on which the great seal, nominally the responsibility of the chancellor, was entrusted to commissions of three or four chancery clerks. Between 12 May 1310 and 14 November 1321 Bardelby was a member of twenty-four such commissions. Twice he and colleagues had the custody of the seal for some six months, but more often they controlled its workings for only a few weeks, while on one occasion in June 1318 it was entrusted to them for just twenty-four hours. During these years Bardelby was several times named as a royal councillor; in March 1315, for instance, he was present at York for negotiations with envoys from the count of Flanders. He was a trier of petitions in parliament in 1315, 1316, and 1321, and an assessor of the fifteenth in London in 1316. A priest by 18 November 1311, he continued to add to his benefices, notably the Lincolnshire livings of Gedney and Boston (the latter in the face of some opposition) and a prebend in the collegiate church of South Malling, Sussex, all in 1311, and a prebend in the royal free chapel of Penkridge, Staffordshire, in 1314. And he added to his inheritance at and near Barlby. Perhaps he came to feel uneasy about his own acquisitiveness, for in 1316 he endowed a chantry for his soul in the London church of St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street (where he had property), and in February 1321 he founded another chantry, this time in Southwark Priory.<br>
<br>On 14 November 1321 Bardelby was licensed to leave court because of illness. This may have been a turning point in his career. He never had the custody of the great seal afterwards, and although he appears to have continued to act as a chancery clerk&#151;he was present on 4 July 1325 when Henry Cliffe took oath as keeper of the chancery rolls&#151;he was not promoted to a bishopric, unlike some of his colleagues. In August 1321 he had exchanged Dunnington for a prebend in Chichester Cathedral (perhaps Henfield), and thereafter he is increasingly to be found in the south of England, and especially Sussex, where he was several times appointed to commissions and inquests. In September 1328 he was reported to be dead, and his prebend in South Malling was given to another royal clerk. But he recovered, and even acted once more as a royal commissioner. In February 1332 he was licensed to endow Chichester Cathedral with a yearly rent of 20<i>s</i>. for the commemoration of his anniversary; licence was given in acknowledgement of &#145;laudable service in the Chancery in the reign of Edward I, Edward II and the present king, discharged at great cost to himself&#146;  (<span class="italic">CPR</span>, <i>1330&#150;34</i>, 254). Bardelby was still believed to be alive on 30 June 1332, but had probably died by 18 August 1333, when another incumbent was instituted at Gedney. As an ordained clerk he had neither wife nor children. But he attended to the interests of his nephews, acting as the guardian of one during his minority, obtaining a post in the Dublin exchequer for another. It is also possible that the Robert and Hugh Bardelby later recorded in royal service were his relations, introduced into government by him.<br>
