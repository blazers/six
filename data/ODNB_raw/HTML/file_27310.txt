<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomson <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Thompson]</span>,  James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>B. V.]</span>  (1834&#150;1882), <span class="occ">poet and satirist</span>, was born at Church Street, Port Glasgow, on 23 November 1834, the eldest of three children of James Thompson (1806&#150;1853), a merchant seaman, and his wife, Sarah Kennedy (1798&#150;1843), a court dressmaker. Both parents were Scottish, and his mother was a devout follower of the preacher Edward Irving. In 1840 James's father suffered a disabling stroke while at sea, and about then the family moved to east London. In 1842 his mother, struggling to support the family, secured him a place at the Royal Caledonian Asylum (which decided he should be known as Thomson, his father's name at baptism). She died a few months later.<br>
<br>Having done well at school, where he remained until 1848, Thomson trained in 1850&#150;51 and 1853&#150;4 as an army schoolmaster at the Royal Military Asylum, Chelsea. In 1851 he went as a student teacher to Ballincollig, near Cork, where he first met the future political activist Charles Bradlaugh. He also developed a tender relationship with a pupil, Matilda Weller, then only thirteen years old. Her death in 1853 was long thought to have had a profound effect on his pessimistic outlook, though later biographers have cast doubt on this.<br>
<br>From 1854 Thomson spent eight nomadic years as an army schoolmaster in England, Ireland, and Jersey. Unexpectedly, on 30 October 1862, he was discharged in disgrace for an apparently minor breach of discipline. Intellectually these years were not wasted, however: he had studied languages, read widely, and discovered a special enthusiasm for Shelley and the German Novalis. He had also written much poetry, some of it published in <span class="italic">Tait's Edinburgh Magazine</span>.<br>
<br>Thomson now settled in London, and with Bradlaugh's help found work as a clerk and journalist. As B. V. or Bysshe Vanolis (to commemorate Shelley and Novalis) he published much of his poetry and literary reviews in Bradlaugh's <span class="italic">National Reformer</span>. He participated actively in the propaganda of free thought and secularism, but never fully subscribed to the beliefs of his more militant colleagues. Lacking a wide audience he none the less came to the attention of discerning critics such as W. M. Rossetti. Attacks of alcoholism, however, aggravated by his poverty, loneliness, insomnia, and deeply pessimistic temperament, seriously affected his work. In 1866 he left the Bradlaughs' family home, and until his death, except for a few months in Colorado in 1872&#150;3 as agent of a mining company, and a visit to Spain as war correspondent in 1873, lived in a succession of one-room lodgings, in Pimlico and Bloomsbury. Under these circumstances he contributed to the <span class="italic">National Reformer</span> in 1874 his great visionary poem &#145;The City of Dreadful Night&#146;, which brought him the appreciation of George Eliot and George Meredith.<br>
<br>After 1875, having quarrelled with Bradlaugh, Thomson transferred his services to <span class="italic">The Secularist</span>, and the monthly <span class="italic">Cope's Tobacco Plant</span>. Through his friend Bertram Dobell he eventually achieved publication in book form of some of his poetry in a collection entitled <span class="italic">The City of Dreadful Night and other Poems</span> (1880), followed by <span class="italic">Vane's Story</span>, <span class="italic">Weddah and Om-el-Bonain and other Poems</span>, and a prose collection, <span class="italic">Essays and Phantasies</span>, in 1881. During 1881&#150;2 he spent some happy weeks with secularist friends, the Barrs, at their home near Leicester, spoiled by recurrent bouts of drinking. After setting fire to his landlord's kitchen, a fortnight in prison for the offence, and a final drunken binge when he seemed beyond rescue by his devoted friends, he took refuge in the home of the blind poet Philip Bourke Marston, where another friend found him in a state of collapse from an internal haemorrhage. He died on 3 June 1882 in University College Hospital, London, and on 8 June was buried in the grave of the secularist Austin Holyoake, in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>Temperamentally &#145;B. V.&#146; was capable of flashes of brilliant joyousness but the predominant mood of his verse was uncompromisingly sombre. His beliefs moved from pantheism to an atheism which causes less of a frisson now than it did in his own day, and his apocalyptic vision of the megalopolis in &#145;The City of Dreadful Night&#146; continues to have resonance. The poet wanders in a vast city of endless night. Faith, Love, and Hope have died. A ranting preacher tells of visions of cosmic fire. Even the gate of hell is closed to one who has no hope left to abandon. There is no God and death is final&#151;&#145;The unsexed skeleton mocks shroud and pall&#146;  (VII, l. 14). Another preacher finds in the universe only &#145;Necessity Supreme&#146;  (XIV, l. 75), and finally the dreamer sees a great image of Melancholy, drawn from an engraving by D&uuml;rer. The poem ceases in a blaze of moonlight with &#145;confirmation of the old despair&#146;  (XXI, l. 84). His poem &#145;In the Room&#146;, in which articles of furniture in a lodging-house room converse about its tenant, can still send a shiver down the reader's spine: only the bed is aware that its silent occupant is a corpse.<br>
<br>H. S. Salt in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> described his &#145;courageous, genial spirit, coupled with an intolerable melancholia; spiritual aspiration with realistic grasp of fact; ardent zeal for democracy and free thought with stubborn disbelief in human progress&#146;&#151;qualities reflected in his prose as much as in his verse. The obscurity of the journals in which he published made it difficult in his lifetime to evaluate the merits of his prose, but the judicious selection made by W. D. Schaefer, <span class="italic">The Speedy Extinction of Evil and Misery</span> (1967), has done much to reveal its vitality, pungency, and remorseless wit. If Shelley was the presiding genius of Thomson's poetry, along with Dante, Heine, Leopardi, and Blake, the shade of Swift looms over his <span class="italic">Satires and Profanities</span>, among which may be highlighted his &#145;Proposals for the speedy extinction of evil and misery&#146; and &#145;The Story of a Famous Old Jewish Firm&#146; (a satire on the Trinity).<br>
<br>Posthumously, in 1884 Bertram Dobell edited <span class="italic">A Voice from the Nile and other Poems</span>, while G. W. Foote edited <span class="italic">Satires and Profanities</span>. Salt's ground-breaking biography appeared in 1889. Even then Thomson's reputation was dogged by misfortune, as a warehouse fire in 1890 destroyed most of his publisher's stock, making the earliest editions exceptionally scarce. Thomson's <span class="italic">Poems, Essays and Fragments</span>, edited by J. M. Robertson, followed in 1892, but it was Dobell's two-volume edition of the <span class="italic">Poetical Works</span> (1895) which ensured his survival.<br>
