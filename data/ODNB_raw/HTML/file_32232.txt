<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cadbury,  George</span>  (1839&#150;1922), <span class="occ">confectionery manufacturer and social reformer</span>, was born at Edgbaston, Birmingham, on 19 September 1839, the third son and fourth child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37254/', "John Cadbury (1801&#150;1889)")</script>, cocoa and chocolate manufacturer, and his wife, Candia (1805&#150;1855), daughter of George Barrow, merchant and shipowner, of Lancaster. The Cadbury family, of west-country origin, had settled in Birmingham at the end of the eighteenth century. John Cadbury began as a tea and coffee dealer in 1824, and started to manufacture cocoa in 1831. The firm of Cadbury Brothers was established in 1847, when Benjamin Head Cadbury left the family drapery business to join his brother John. The Cadburys were long associated with the Society of Friends, and Quakerism was a powerful influence on the attitudes and actions of George Cadbury.<br>
<br>George Cadbury was educated at home and as a day-boy at Lean's Quaker school at Edgbaston. His mother, an ardent temperance worker, died in 1855, and soon afterwards his schooling ended. His original wish was to become a surgeon, but circumstances led him into commerce, and, in 1856, after a period of employment in the grocery business of Joseph Rowntree at York, he joined his father's cocoa factory in Bridge Street, Birmingham. His elder brother, Richard, had been at work there since 1850. John Cadbury's health failed after his wife's death, and the business declined to a position where its future was threatened. In April 1861 Richard and George, aged respectively twenty-five and twenty-one, took entire control. It was only after a hard struggle and great personal sacrifice on the part of the two young partners that in 1864 prosperity began to return. Richard had scientific and artistic interests, but George, it was said, channelled his energies into the creation of a strong business, which would reflect his religious ideals, his belief in thrift and hard work, worthy products, fair dealing, and good employment conditions.<br>
<br>The place of Cadbury Brothers as one of Victorian Britain's most notable businesses was achieved with the introduction of Cocoa Essence in 1866. Cadburys was the first British firm to employ the Van Houten press, which removed excess oils from the cocoa bean; its use enabled the firm to manufacture a finer powder, in large quantities. At a time when parliamentary attacks were being levelled at adulterated foodstuffs, Cocoa Essence benefited from the absence of additives traditionally used to counteract the taste of the excess oils, and the new product was effectively packaged, branded, and advertised. What distinguished George Cadbury from his competitors was his willingness to introduce innovations, and, by 1910, his firm had replaced Frys of Bristol as the country's largest cocoa and chocolate manufacturer.<br>
<br>By 1879 the Bridge Street building was inadequate to the firm's needs, and the partners took the opportunity of making their greatest social and economic experiment&#151;the moving of their works into the healthier rural surroundings of Bournville, 4 miles from Birmingham. Here, they improved factory layout and the efficiency of their operation, and they were able to expand their industrial welfare work, improving employment conditions and creating a model housing estate. Benefit schemes, including sick pay and pensions, were eventually introduced. The Bournville experiment in housing and town planning was George Cadbury's own. However, the success of the new factory made it likely that slum conditions would, if allowed, grow up in its neighbourhood. To avoid this, he bought, between the years 1893 and 1900, some 300 acres of adjoining land, on which he had built about 30 houses by the time he founded the independent Bournville Village Trust, in December 1900. The trust could own land anywhere in Great Britain, and even the Bournville estate was never intended by George Cadbury to be solely for the benefit of employees of his own business. By 1931 the capital of the trust had increased from &pound;170,000 to over &pound;500,000, and it held more than 1000 acres of land.<br>
<br>Cadbury married, in 1873, Mary (1849&#150;1887), daughter of Charles Tylor, writer and lecturer, of London; they had three sons and two daughters, among them <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/107309/', "Edward Cadbury")</script> who followed his father into the confectionery trade. After Mary's death he married, in 1888, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/45784/', "Elizabeth Mary Cadbury (1858&#150;1951)")</script>, daughter of John Taylor, a member of the London stock exchange and director of various City companies; three sons and three daughters were born of the second marriage. The oldest son of George and Elizabeth was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46801/', "Laurence Cadbury")</script>, who became managing director of Cadbury Brothers in 1919.<br>
<br>Richard Cadbury died in 1899, and Cadbury Brothers finally became a company, with George as its chairman. Innovation in product technology and marketing continued with the introduction of Cadbury's Dairy Milk in 1905 and Bournville cocoa in 1906. Under George's leadership, Cadbury Brothers had grown from an enterprise of 20 employees to one of about 8600.<br>
<br>An important part of George Cadbury's social work was the adult school movement. As a young man he had begun as a teacher in an adult school in Birmingham, and he continued to teach until the age of seventy-two, riding or, in his later years, bicycling into the city at six o'clock on Sunday mornings to take his <span class="roman">Bible</span> class. Hundreds of Birmingham men learned from him how to read and write. The resulting insight which he gained into working-class conditions inspired his interest in housing and factory reform. His love of the country led him to attach special importance to the provision of gardens for working-class houses.<br>
<br>Cadbury's other social activities were many, and were mostly concerned with giving practical form to the opinions he held. In 1901 he acquired a controlling interest in the <span class="italic">Daily News</span> in order to give voice to Liberal Party, nonconformist views in general, and to oppose the South African War in particular. He also owned four newspapers in the Birmingham district, and he took a leading part in the campaign against sweated labour. Cadbury died at his home, the Manor House, Northfield, Birmingham, on 24 October 1922, survived by his second wife. In 2010 Cadbury plc was taken over by the American food company Kraft.<br>
