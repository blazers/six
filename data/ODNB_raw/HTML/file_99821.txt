<span class="headword">Corbet,  Philip Steven</span>  (1929&#150;2008), <span class="occ">entomologist</span>, was born on 21 May 1929 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya, the eldest child in the family of three boys and one girl of (Alexander) Steven Corbet (1896&#150;1948), a soil microbiologist at the Rubber Research Institute in Kuala Lumpur, and his wife, Irene, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Trewavas. His two brothers died in infancy. His father's love of natural history, and of entomology in particular (he was an authority on the butterflies of Malaya), was a strong influence on his two surviving children, who both became distinguished professional entomologists. The family returned to England in 1932, but during the Second World War Philip moved with his mother and sister to New Zealand, where he attended Nelson Boys' College, set in a rural province in the north of the South Island. Meanwhile his father was appointed to the staff of the British Museum (Natural History), to work on the butterfly collections, where he rose to become deputy keeper of entomology. His sister-in-law, Ethelwyn Trewavas, an authority on African lake fish, was also on the staff of the museum. When the war ended the family were reunited and lived in Reading, but Corbet's father died of a heart attack soon after, following a butterfly-collecting trip in Hampshire.<br>
<br>Corbet completed his schooling after spending a year as a boarder at Dauntsey's School, Wiltshire (1945&#150;6), where he had his first formal lessons in biology. He took a place at Reading University to read zoology (1946&#150;50), where he took a first-class honours degree and received the Colin Morley prize for zoology. From 1950 to 1953 he studied the seasonal regulation in dragonflies at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, under the supervision of V. B. Wigglesworth, for his PhD thesis. This work confirmed his love for dragonflies and led to the publication in 1960 of the seminal book <span class="italic">Dragonflies</span> in the <span class="roman">New Naturalists</span> series, which he co-wrote with Cynthia Longfield and Norman Moore. This and a second book, <span class="italic">A Biology of Dragonflies</span> (1962), established Corbet's reputation as the world's leading authority on dragonflies and a master of scientific synthesis.<br>
<br>Corbet's first professional appointment, from 1954 to 1957, was as invertebrate zoologist at the east Africa high commission laboratories in Jinja, Uganda, where he studied the ecology and feeding strategies of fish in Lake Victoria. From 1957 to 1962 he was transferred to the East African Virus Research Institute at Entebbe, Uganda, to work on the behaviour and ecology of mosquitoes and the discovery of the mosquito vector of o'nyong-nyong fever, which at the time affected over two million people in Uganda and Kenya.<br>
<br>When Uganda achieved independence in 1962 Corbet took a post at the Entomology Research Institute in Ottawa, where he investigated the breeding strategies of mosquitoes in the Canadian high Arctic. He was also instrumental in identifying and eliminating the nuisance caused by biting flies on the St Lawrence River before Expo 1967 in Montreal. In 1967 he was appointed director of the Canada Agriculture Research Institute at Belleville, Ontario, where the focus of his work was on developing methods of pest management that reduced the use of synthetic organic pesticides. During this period he crystallized his ideas on the role of human populations in destablizing ecosystems and precipitating pest outbreaks. Thereafter he took every opportunity to call for national policies on sustainable development.<br>
<br>These convictions led Corbet to accept posts first as professor and chairman of the biology department at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, in 1971, and then, in 1974, as professor and director of the Joint Centre for Environmental Sciences at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, where he was able to pursue his ideas on integrated holistic environmental studies. In New Zealand he had the opportunity to present an ecological perspective on various influential forums by serving on the Environmental Council, the government fact-finding group on nuclear energy, the Demographic Society, and the Club of Rome. By 1978 he considered that the job as director of the Joint Centre had become too political and insufficiently scientific so he resigned to take a chair in the department of zoology at the University of Canterbury. Soon afterwards he was awarded a Commonwealth visiting professorship in the department of applied biology at the University of Cambridge.<br>
<br>Corbet was married three times. He married his first wife, Hildegard Gertrud Keller, a teacher who later became a psychiatrist, in Germany on 9 February 1957. They were divorced in 1979. On 15 October 1980, in New Zealand, he married his Swedish second wife, Laila Kristin Kjellstr&ouml;m, who held various jobs and was latterly a member of a counselling service. The birth of their daughter, Katarina Alexandra, prompted them in 1980 to return to Britain, where Corbet took the foundation chair in zoology in the department of biological sciences at the University of Dundee. There he was head of department from 1983 to 1986. His second marriage having also ended in divorce, on 31 December 1987 he married Mary Elizabeth Canvin (<i>b</i>. 1933), a medical practitioner, in Edinburgh. While at Dundee he served on the Nature Conservancy Council committee for Scotland and chaired the science committee of the Scottish Wildlife Trust. He also brought his considerable scientific and organizational powers to help shape the British Dragonfly Society, which was formed in 1983 and of which he was elected first president, a post he held until 1992. He retired from the University of Dundee as professor emeritus of zoology in 1990 and then spent six years as honorary professor in the department of zoology at Edinburgh University. It was during this period that he was able to complete the highly regarded and comprehensive <span class="italic">Dragonflies: Behaviour and Ecology of Odonata</span> (1999), which included 830 pages and 4000 references. For this definitive synthesis on dragonflies he was awarded the Neill medal for natural history by the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2002.<br>
<br>In 1997 Corbet left Scotland and moved to Crean Mill, near St Buryan in the far west of Cornwall, close to the home of his sister and where, his third marriage having also ended in divorce, he met Sarah Jewell, who became his close partner. There he was able to enjoy dragonflies in the mill's garden, which had a stream and large ponds. While living in Cornwall he served on the council and executive of the Cornwall Wildlife Trust and completed his last major project, a new book on <span class="italic">Dragonflies</span> (co-written with S. J. Brooks) in the <span class="roman">New Naturalist</span> series, published a few months after his death.<br>
<br>Corbet was awarded doctorates or honorary doctorates by the universities of Reading (1962), Cambridge (1976), Edinburgh (2003), and Dundee (2005). He was elected a fellow of the Institute of Biology (1967), the Entomological Society of Canada (1977), of which he was president (1971&#150;2) and from which he received the gold medal for outstanding achievement (1974), the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (1985), the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1987), and the Royal Society of Arts (1991). From 2001 to 2003 he was president of the Worldwide Dragonfly Association.<br>
<br>Corbet was courteous, thoughtful, and quietly spoken. He was incisive, and had a powerful personality and strongly held convictions, valuable assets on the various bodies on which he served. He also had a thorough grasp of the English language and a prodigious memory, which served him well when synthesizing facts on the world's dragonflies. He died at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, Treliske, on 13 February 2008, after suffering a heart attack in the post office at Crean. He was survived by Sarah Jewell and by his daughter, Katarina.<br>
