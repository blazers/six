<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wesley,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1662, <em>d.</em> 1735), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was baptized on 17 December 1662 in Winterborne Whitechurch, Dorset, probably the third of at least four children of the Revd John Westley (1635/6&#150;1671), vicar of Winterborne Whitechurch until his ejection, in 1662, under the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>, and his wife, the daughter of John White (1574&#150;1648) and allegedly the niece of Thomas Fuller, the church historian. His grandfather Bartholomew Westley was also ejected in 1662. The family name was spelt Westley by Samuel as late as 1694 and by others until much later.<h2>
<a name="Educationmarriageandearlyclericalcareer"></a>Education, marriage, and early clerical career</h2>Samuel Wesley was educated at Dorchester grammar school under Henry Dolling and was sent to be prepared for the Independent ministry, under Theophilus Gale, at Newington Green but he reached London on 8 March 1678, after Gale's death. He then attended another grammar school before entering the academies first of Edward Veel (or Veal) in Stepney and after two years that of Charles Morton in Newington Green, where his fellow students included Daniel Defoe. There he wrote lampoons against Thomas Doolittle, head of a rival presbyterian academy.<br>
<br>Dr John Owen, the former vice-chancellor of Oxford University, believing that degrees would soon be open to dissenters, urged Wesley to study at a university. According to his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29069/', "John Wesley (1703&#150;1791)")</script> it was an attempt to vindicate dissent that led instead to Wesley's move towards the Church of England; apparently he slipped away early one morning to Oxford to avoid opposition from his strongly dissenting family. Though he had mixed feelings about Oxford behaviour he was also disgusted by dissenting ribaldry against the church and the Stuarts, while he admired the latitudinarian John Tillotson. However, he resolved to turn Anglican only after three months in London.<br>
<br>Having paid off some debts with the help of dissenting funds Wesley returned to Oxford, on 22 September 1684, and, as a servitor, entered Exeter College, where he matriculated on 18 November. After three months he found himself destitute and mocked by his fellow undergraduates for his dissenting background. He felt himself at risk of moral collapse and, in a letter of 22 August 1692, wrote: &#145;had not God by providence recall'd me to myself by those kind afflictions, I believe I had grown as ill a man as most in the university&#146;  (Beecham, 104). Despite his financial difficulties he told his brother Matthew, in 1731, that he had entered Oxford with &pound;2 5<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. yet left with &pound;10 15<i>s</i>. 0<i>d</i>. While at Oxford he published anonymously, through his brother-in-law John Dunton, a volume of verse, entitled <span class="italic">Maggots [Whimsies], or, Poems on Several Subjects Never Before Handled</span> (1685). He later claimed to have ceased to support James II, over the expulsion of the fellows of Magdalen (16 November 1687), while being unwilling to oppose him actively. But in 1688 he contributed verses to <span class="italic">Strenae natalitatiae Oxoniensae</span> (1688), in honour of the birth of James's son on 10 June. However, he soon transferred his allegiance to William and Mary, Queen Anne, and George I.<br>
<br>Having graduated BA on 19 June 1688 Wesley reached London on 1 July and was offered a chaplaincy place in Cornwall. He was ordained deacon at Bromley on 7 August 1688 by Thomas Sprat, bishop of Rochester. He then acted as curate of St Botolph, Aldersgate, for about ten months. On 12 November 1688 he married Susanna Annesley (1669&#150;1742) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/66878/', "Wesley, Susanna")</script>], youngest daughter of Dr Samuel Annesley, a leading dissenting minister, and his second wife. Susanna had also abandoned dissent for Anglicanism. On 24 February 1689 Wesley was ordained priest by Henry Compton, bishop of London.<br>
<br>Next Wesley had an unhappy six months at sea as a naval chaplain, at &pound;70 per annum, from about June to late November 1689. Then, after some months as a literary hack, he obtained, during the first half of 1690, a curacy at Newington Butts, Surrey, at &pound;30 per annum. His first son, <a href="#cosubject_29071">Samuel Wesley the younger [<i>see below</i>]</a>, was born on 10 February 1690 or 1691 in Spitalfields. Early in the 1690s he wrote a letter which described in critical terms the tone and education of dissenting academies, and which was to be published, with damaging effects, in 1703.<br>
<br>Though offered a post in Virginia, Wesley refused this in favour of the living of South Ormsby, Lincolnshire, which came to him from the Massingberd family, probably through the influence of John Sheffield, marquess of Normanby. He was presented on 25 June 1691 and instituted on 9 July. He returned to London to raise money and first signed the parish register at South Ormsby on 25 August 1691. He had added a nearby curacy, probably Maltby-le-Marsh, by March 1692.<br>
<br>While at South Ormsby Wesley wrote a good deal. With John Dunton he contributed to the <span class="italic">Athenian Gazette</span> (1691&#150;7) and to the <span class="italic">Young Student's Library</span> (1692), probably mainly on religious subjects. His heroic poem <span class="italic">The Life of our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</span> was published in 1693 (and dedicated to Queen Mary in 1694). Lord Normanby made Wesley his chaplain in 1694 and recommended him, unsuccessfully, for an Irish bishopric. Also in 1694 Wesley was incorporated MA at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He resigned from South Ormsby following his refusal to allow the mistress of James Saunderson (later earl of Castleton) to visit his own wife.<h2>
<a name="PreferraltoEpworth"></a>Preferral to Epworth</h2>On 15 March 1695 Wesley was appointed rector of Epworth, Lincolnshire, a crown appointment, probably on account of his political support (Wesley said it was for the dedication of his life of Christ to Queen Mary but she had died before the appointment). He was inducted on 24 April but appears to have acted as curate at South Ormsby until May 1697, so he probably did not move to Epworth until then. According to Wesley, Epworth was a town of 1100 people in 1701, the living being nominally worth &pound;200 per annum, though he did not always receive this amount. There were no &#145;papists&#146; or presbyterians in the parish but about 40 Quakers, more than 70 Anabaptists, and about 100 of no religion. He complained of the children's ignorance of the Lord's prayer and creed. Already in debt on his arrival, by 1700 he owed &pound;300. Despite efforts to make money, admittedly while supporting his mother, he was a poor manager as well as suffering many misfortunes. His wife remarked that he was &#145;not so wise in their generation as the children of this world&#146;  (Stevenson, 200). He was visited with a series of natural disasters as well as attacks on his property, possibly even arson in the case of the rectory fires of 1702 and 1709. In 1705 he backed tory candidates in a disputed county election, believing that the opposition was being supported by dissenters against the church. As a result, during the election there was &#145;drumming, shouting and firing of pistols and guns under the window where my wife lay, who had been brought to bed not three weeks&#146;. A clergyman in Lincoln heard them cry &#145;if they got me in the castle yard they would squeeze my guts out&#146;. At Epworth they threatened to &#145;turn ye all out of doors a-begging&#146;  (Clarke, 104). His enemies engineered Wesley's imprisonment for debt but he was eventually released with the help of a university brief and of government supporters.<br>
<br>The family itself was politically divided. Unlike Samuel, Susanna adhered to the divine right of the exiled Stuarts. Early in 1702 she refused to say &#145;amen&#146; to her husband's prayer for William III. John Wesley claimed that Samuel flew into a rage and vowed not to cohabit unless she submitted. He left for convocation and threatened to take up a naval chaplaincy but the accession of Anne reconciled them. This account understated Susanna's resolution and her agonies of conscience. She consulted the nonjuror bishop George Hickes and refused mediation. The crisis continued after Anne's accession and was only resolved when Wesley, persuaded by a friend, returned. In 1709 Susanna still maintained that a king by divine right could be judged only by God and not by his subjects.<br>
<br>In 1703 there was published anonymously <span class="italic">A letter from a country divine to his friend in London concerning the education of dissenters in their private acadaemies</span>. This was the letter written privately by Wesley in the 1690s to a friend, probably Charles Goodall; it was now published by Robert Clavel. Wesley claimed that it was originally provoked by a meeting he attended in 1693, where dissenters expressed scurrilous hostility to the church and to the memory of Charles I. (It was probably not, as is usually claimed, a meeting of the so-called Calve's Head Club, whose reputation in any case may owe much to tory propaganda.) Samuel denied that he had authorized publication, though in a somewhat equivocal fashion. Publication was timed to reinforce the current attacks on dissenters and especially on their academies. A pamphlet war ensued over the next four years, yet in the midst of this, in 1705, Wesley actually proposed to offer to serve as a missionary overseas.<br>
<br>In 1709 the rectory was burnt for the second time and the young John Wesley was rescued, as if by a miracle. In March 1710 came the trial of Dr Henry Sacheverell and, according to John Wesley, Wesley wrote his speech for the defence. There is no other evidence for this, though it is generally believed that Sacheverell did not write it himself. During Wesley's absence at convocation in 1710&#150;12 Susanna held meetings in the rectory for prayer, religious readings, and conversation, upholding her duty to do so, despite opposition from the curate and doubts on Wesley's part. Methodists often saw this as foreshadowing John Wesley's later class meetings. In 1714 John was sent to the Charterhouse on the recommendation of the duke of Buckingham (Wesley's old patron, the former marquess of Normanby) but with the accession of George I this tory nobleman lost influence and with it went Wesley's last hopes of preferment.<br>
<br>In 1716&#150;17 came the remarkable episode of Old Jeffery, the Epworth ghost whose knockings and door slammings would now identify him as a poltergeist but, in this instance, identified him as a Jacobite who knocked loudly when the king was prayed for. The family at first suggested natural explanations but finally settled for a supernatural power. John Wesley, though absent, had no doubt that it was a punishment for his father's rash vow in 1702.<h2>
<a name="Latercareer"></a>Later career</h2>From 1722 Wesley added the rectory of Wroot, at &pound;60 per annum, to Epworth but with little profit, and in 1724 came the unhappy episode of his daughter Mehetabel (Hetty) Wesley [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38156/', "Wright, Mehetabel")</script>], later fictionalized by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch in <span class="italic">Hetty Wesley</span> (1903). Wesley opposed her proposed marriage and, when she was seduced and pregnant, married her to a drunken plumber, William Wright. Wesley refused to be reconciled with her and John Wesley obliquely criticized him from the pulpit. Hetty lost all her babies, expressing her suffering in poignant verses. Wesley consoled himself for his misfortunes with literary labours in prose and verse, his later years being devoted to a massive volume of dissertations on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> book of <span class="roman">Job</span>. It was published in 1735, after his death, and was dedicated to Queen Caroline, who is said merely to have admired its pretty binding.<br>
<br>In 1731, still apparently in debt, Wesley was taken to task by his brother Matthew, a London physician, who blamed him for his improvidence and for his large family: &#145;a black account; let the cause be folly, or vanity or ungovernable appetite&#146;  (Clarke, 5). To this Samuel replied with a rather jocular but not ineffective account of his years of financial misfortune. Despite his misfortunes and shortcomings Wesley was a dedicated and zealous parish priest, utilizing all the contemporary Anglican initiatives to improve parochial morality and religion. In 1698 he preached in support of the reformation of manners, and from March 1699 he corresponded with the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, which supported parish schools and the distribution of religious literature. In 1702 he told the society that he had considered creating a local society for the reformation of manners but instead he formed a religious society on the pattern of those pioneered by Josiah Woodward from 1678, for prayer, religious reading, the reformation of manners, and correspondence with similar societies abroad. He had in mind the continental pietists, the Halle orphan house, and the Danish overseas missions. It is not known what became of this venture but Wesley certainly upheld the more traditional disciplines of the church. His <span class="italic">Pious Communicant Rightly Prepared</span> (1700) advocated frequent communion and included a discourse on baptism, reproduced by John Wesley as <span class="italic">A Treatise on Baptism</span>, in 1756, without acknowledgement. In 1701 he initiated a monthly communion, though only twenty people attended, and in 1734 he even offered to pay for a weekly communion for a friend. Initially he catechized all the year round though later, as was customary, only during Lent. He held two services every Sunday with weekday services on Wednesdays, Fridays, and feast days and he imposed public penance for sexual offences. At a mass confirmation at Epworth in 1712 he told Bishop Wake that it would have been more proper &#145;for my parish to have come by themselves and none to have been confirmed but those whose names had been given in by the minister&#146;  (Sykes, 173&#150;4). He expressed his ideals for the clergy in <span class="italic">A Letter to a Curate</span> (1735). He was a proctor in convocation in 1703 and in 1710, a duty which he took very seriously.<br>
<br>Despite difficulties and differences Wesley was deeply attached to his wife, a woman of exceptional intelligence and of a character very different from his. They had a large family, commonly reckoned at nineteen children though now thought more likely to have been seventeen. Of these, ten (three sons and seven daughters) reached maturity. The daughters were lively and cultured and all but one married, nearly all unhappily, in part through Wesley's interventions. Apart from Mehetabel the most unfortunate case was that of Martha, who married the unstable Revd Westley Hall, once a Methodist but later a practising polygamist. As a widow Martha became a friend of Dr Samuel Johnson.<br>
<br>On 4 June 1731 Wesley was injured by a fall from a wagon and never fully recovered. On his deathbed he is reported to have foretold the coming religious revival. John Wesley claimed, in support of his doctrine of assurance, that his father said &#145;The inward witness, son, the inward witness, that is the proof, the strongest proof, of Christianity&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 26.288&#150;9). Samuel Wesley died at Epworth rectory on 25 April 1735 and was buried three days later in Epworth churchyard. In person he was short, a family characteristic; in character he was learned, zealous, pious, courageous for his principles, affectionate where his prejudices were not aroused, and devoted to his sons' welfare. But he was also obstinate and partisan.<br>
<br>Wesley's literary works were in part a bid for preferment and a consolation for misfortunes, but some were dedicated to improving clerical standards. He is likely always to be remembered mainly as the father of his famous sons. He was only a very minor poet, a mere item in the first edition of Alexander Pope's <span class="italic">Dunciad</span>, though his hymn &#145;Behold the saviour of mankind&#146; would not be unworthy of his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29067/', "Charles Wesley")</script>. His scholarly ambitions were not fulfilled for his volume on <span class="roman">Job</span> was largely a monument to misplaced and conservative erudition, though Adam Clarke, who published <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Wesley Family</span> in 1823, thought its polyglot collations valuable. He nevertheless remains worthy of attention as an example of the best type of clergyman of his time in his attempts to implement the early eighteenth-century high-church movement for parochial renewal, and not without success. The 20 communicants of 1701 had risen to 100 by 1733, and John Wesley allowed that some had been influenced by his father.<h2>
<a name="Eldestchild"></a>Eldest child</h2>
<a name="cosubject_29071"></a><span class="headword">Samuel Wesley the younger</span>  (1690/91&#150;1739), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was born in Spitalfields, London, on 10 February 1690 or 1691, the eldest child of Samuel and Susanna Wesley. The uncertainty over his date of birth stems from a letter in which he gave 1690 as his year of birth  (Beecham, 84<i>n</i>.) but his gravestone says that he was in his forty-ninth year when he died. The fact that he gave his age on matriculation at Oxford as eighteen only adds to the confusion. It is said that he scarcely spoke until he was nearly five, when he suddenly said, &#145;Here I am, mother&#146;  (Clarke, 363). He became a precocious learner, mastered the alphabet in a few hours, and was able to learn words at first sight. He entered Westminster School in 1704, under Dr Busby, was elected king's scholar in 1707, and became devoted to the classics. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 9 June 1711, proceeding BA in 1715 and MA in 1718. He became head usher at Westminster School, probably from 1713, and took orders soon afterwards on the advice of Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester. He was also active in founding the first Westminster Infirmary, in 1719, which later became St George's Hospital. He married, about 1715, Ursula Berry, daughter of the Revd John Berry, vicar of Walton, Norfolk. Of their six children, four died in infancy and only a daughter outlived her parents. Ursula fell out with Samuel's brothers and his mother and was still estranged at her death about 1742.<br>
<br>Wesley became friendly with tory politicians and poets such as Robert Harley, earl of Oxford, Alexander Pope, and Jonathan Swift, but the Atterbury connection ensured that he would receive no ecclesiastical preferment. In 1722 Atterbury was arrested for complicity in Jacobite plots and, in 1723, exiled to France. Wesley never wavered in his loyalty to Atterbury and wrote squibs against Sir Robert Walpole. This association branded him a Jacobite though there is no evidence that this went beyond literary opposition. In 1785 John Wesley claimed that he and Samuel, like their father, were tories but not Jacobites, Samuel only differing from him in believing it to be legitimate to oppose the king's ministers.<br>
<br>In 1732&#150;3 (the exact chronology is not entirely clear) Samuel failed to secure the under-mastership at Westminster School through political prejudice, though ostensibly this was because he was married. He was offered the headmastership, apparently unsolicited, of Tiverton grammar school, Devon. The school had kept down the fees for fear of losing pupils but Samuel boldly raised them to &pound;20 per annum. His first year added forty boys to the school and numbers increased in the following years. In February 1733 he refused to follow his father at Epworth to provide a home for his brothers and sisters. John Wesley also refused, with lengthy reasons for remaining in Oxford, to which his brother responded: &#145;I see your love to yourself but your love to your neighbour I do not see&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works of John Wesley</span>, 25.411).<br>
<br>Wesley took his responsibilities as eldest son and surrogate father with great seriousness. In 1733 his father acknowledged: &#145;[you have been] a father to your brothers and sisters, especially the former, who have cost you great sums in their education&#146;  (Stevenson, 136). He kept an eye on John at Charterhouse and, in 1785, Charles recalled that he was &#145;placed under the care of my eldest brother Samuel, a strict churchman, who brought me up in his own principles&#146;  (Baker, <span class="italic">Charles Wesley</span>, 7). After his father's death he helped to pay his debts and shared in the care of Susanna until she settled in London in 1739. Samuel supported James Oglethorpe's work for the Georgia colony and supplied it with communion plate. But he disapproved of Charles voyaging there, seeing in this John's will rather than God's. He clashed repeatedly with John's conduct and beliefs after the latter's conversion, in 1738, and lamented his mother's countenancing his new ideas. In October 1739 he wrote: &#145;Is it not enough that I am bereft of both my brothers, but must my mother follow too?&#146;  (Longworth, 34).<br>
<br>As a poet Samuel produced satirical and political as well as religious verse. He was a competent, if uninspired, neo-classical poet, unusual only in substituting Christian for pagan personifications. More attractive were his verses on his wife for, unlike most of the Wesley family, he had a happy marriage. Though deserving respect for his political and religious integrity and for his devotion to his family, Samuel was only a very minor poet. His influence shows in the persisting high-churchmanship of his brother Charles, and his early death removed the one person capable of standing up to John Wesley as an affectionate equal. He died at Tiverton grammar school, after a short illness, on 6 November 1739 and was buried in Tiverton churchyard.<br>
