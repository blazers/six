<span class="headword">Mennons,  John</span>  (1747&#150;1818), <span class="occ">printer and journal editor</span>, was born on 22 February 1747 in the Canongate parish of Edinburgh, son of John Mennons (1718&#150;1793), baker, and Rebecca Galloway. John junior was apprenticed as a printer, probably with the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Courant</span>. He set up on his own in 1778 when he published the <span class="italic">Scots and County Magazine</span>, with the imprint &#145;J. Mennons &amp; Co., Brodie's Close, Lawnmarket&#146;. Over the next four years he produced a variety of periodicals offering information and entertainment, such as the <span class="italic">Gentleman and Lady's Pocket Register</span> and the <span class="italic">Weekly Mirror</span> (assisted in the latter by the balloonist James Tytler). About 1772 he married Janet Moir. A daughter, Janet, was born on 19 January 1773 but died in infancy; she was followed by a son, Thomas (1774&#150;1804), who became his father's business partner.<br>
<br>In 1782 Mennons moved to Glasgow and bought a secondhand press; on 27 January 1783 he published the first issue of a newspaper, the <span class="italic">Glasgow Advertiser</span>, from Duncan's Land, Gibson's Wynd, in the Saltmarket, claiming, as editors do, to &#145;preserve his mind as free as possible from any prejudice, which &hellip; might lead him to partial representation of the facts&#146;. In fact, Mennons's statement was more than the standard declaration of impartiality, for the <span class="italic">Advertiser</span> was noteworthy for its independence from political faction.<br>
<br>After the death of his first wife, Mennons married in 1785 Jean Steedman (<i>d</i>. 1814), daughter of James Steedman, cutler in Glasgow, and Jean McNair. They had three sons and five daughters; the first son, James, and a daughter, Jean, died young. The surviving daughters&#151;Jane, Mary, Marion, and Agnes&#151;never married. The second son, John (<i>c</i>.1786&#150;1843), worked with his father for a while and later was editor of the <span class="italic">Greenock Advertiser</span>. The third son, another James, died in 1817. By virtue of his second marriage Mennons was admitted burgess and guild brother of Glasgow in 1786. He joined the Stationers' Company in 1786. By 1789 he was established in the Tontine Close, near the Cross, the hub of the busy merchant city. There he accepted &#145;advertisements, commissions and articles of intelligence&#146;.<br>
<br>In appearance Mennons was stolid and genial. There is no clear evidence of his religion or politics. The <span class="italic">Advertiser</span> soon proved itself of special service to commerce, while politically generally steering a middle course. However, in 1793 Mennons was indicted for treason, for publishing, on 23 November 1792, a report of a meeting of the Partick Sons of Liberty which declared that if nations adopted Thomas Paine's principles, &#145;tyrants and their satellites would vanish&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Advertiser</span>, 23 Nov 1792). The author of the article failed to appear for trial and the matter was dropped, ending this &#145;disagreeable situation&#146;  (<span class="italic">Glasgow Advertiser</span>, 1 Feb 1793).<br>
<br>Mennons continued to print the kinds of useful publication he had in Edinburgh, including <span class="italic">Jones's Directory</span> (1787 and 1789), the <span class="italic">Glasgow Almanack</span> (1784&#150;1802), and the <span class="italic">Glasgow Magazine</span> (1783&#150;4), as well as selling lottery tickets and patent medicines. In 1797 he bought Jeanfield House, near Camlachie, from his wife's cousin Robert McNair, for &pound;2435, but sold it a year later to John Finlayson, McNair's brother-in-law.<br>
<br>In 1802 Mennons sold the <span class="italic">Advertiser</span> and leased Eastmuir coalfield, near Shettleston, owned by Finlayson. This venture failed, and in 1809 he was declared bankrupt. Attempts to return to publishing&#151;the <span class="italic">Western Star</span> (1807) and <span class="italic">The Scotchman</span> (1812&#150;13)&#151;also failed. After his wife's death in 1814 he moved to Irvine on the Ayrshire coast and in a small house at 15 High Street, with the help of his children, doggedly started afresh. The <span class="italic">Irvine and County of Ayr Miscellany</span> (1814&#150;15) proved his swansong. He died at home of old age on 2 February 1818, and was buried in Irvine parish churchyard two days later.<br>
<br>Mennons was no innovator, just one of many entrepreneurs of fluctuating fortune in a city recovering from the American War of Independence. His legacy is the <span class="italic">Glasgow Advertiser</span>, which became Glasgow's longest-running newspaper under the successive titles the <span class="italic">Herald and Advertiser</span>, then the <span class="italic">Glasgow Herald</span>, and then <span class="italic">The Herald</span>.<br>
