<span class="headword">Holford <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Hodson]</span>,  Margaret</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1778, <em>d.</em> 1852), <span class="occ">poet and translator</span>, was baptized on 1 June 1778 at St John the Baptist, Chester, Cheshire, the eldest of four daughters of Allen Holford of Davenham, Cheshire, and of Margaret, daughter of William Wrench, of Chester. Her father, who died while she was still a child, was the last male descendant of the ancient family of Holford of Davenham, a branch of the Holfords of Holford and Vale Royal. Her mother was a poet, Minerva Press novelist, and playwright, sufficiently prolific for the works of mother and daughter (both Margaret Holford) often to be confused in catalogues and dictionary entries. At the age of eight Margaret was taking volumes of Shakespeare to bed, reading early and late, writing poetry, and displaying an &#145;insatiable&#146; &#145;appetite for all kinds of literature&#146;  (<span class="italic">N&amp;Q</span>, 411). Her first published work, an anonymous and lengthy metrical romance, <span class="italic">Wallace, or, The Fight of Falkirk</span> (1809), was a contemporary success in the wake of Walter Scott's <span class="italic">Marmion</span> (1808), which it blatantly imitates. She produced about the same time &#145;Lines Occasioned by Reading the Poetical Works of Walter Scott&#146; (NL Scot.), the receipt of which Scott failed to acknowledge, causing resentment and the intervention of his friend Joanna Baillie on the side of the injured female poet, whom she described to Scott as a good &#145;military antiquarian&#146; in his own style  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sir Walter Scott</span>, 2.301 and n.). Scott's unchivalrous excuse for the slight was his horror of attaching to himself sentimental female poets.<br>
<br>Like Scott, other readers were less charitable than Baillie. <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1811), published under Holford's name and including an ode to Anna Seward, her mother's friend, and her second metrical romance, <span class="italic">Margaret of Anjou</span> (1816), were not favourably received. The latter, dedicated to her mother, from whom &#145;I have imbibed and inherited the taste which has devoted me to the service of the Muse&#146;, the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span> declared to be &#145;tame and insipid &hellip; essentially deteriorated and deadened in spirit&#146;, when compared with <span class="italic">Wallace</span>, and unlikely to &#145;obtain a place of distinction in any but the <i>curious</i> and <i>rare</i> libraries of the twentieth century&#146;  (<span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, 81, 1816, 354&#150;5). A slim volume, <span class="italic">The Past, etc.</span> (1819) is a collection of overblown, indulgent pieces; the popular annuals, to which she was a regular contributor, continued to provide an outlet for such extravagant effusions. In 1820 she published <span class="italic">Warbeck of Wolfstein</span>, a novel with a medieval setting, and in 1823 she translated <span class="italic">Italian Stories</span>. On 16 October 1826, at South Kirkby, Yorkshire, she married the <a href="#cosubject_13451">Revd Septimus Hodson [<i>see below</i>]</a>. The only substantial work published after her marriage was a translation from the Spanish, <span class="italic">The Lives of Vasco Nunez de Balboa and Francisco Pizarro</span> (1832), which she dedicated to Robert Southey. She seems to have made up her quarrel with Scott, with whom she was corresponding in 1825, and her literary circle extended to S. T. Coleridge, Wordsworth, William Sotheby, and Savage Landor, who in 1845 was pressing her to reissue her one real success, <span class="italic">Wallace</span>. Margaret Hodson died at Plantation Terrace, Dawlish, Devon, on 11 September 1852.<br>
<br>Her husband, <a name="cosubject_13451"></a><span class="headword">Septimus Hodson</span>  (1768&#150;1833), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and author</span>, was born in Huntingdon, the seventh son of the Revd Robert Hodson (1725/6&#150;1803). As a boy he attended St Ives School and Stilton School, and was admitted on 4 March 1779 as a pensioner to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was a scholar from 1779 to 1784. He was ordained deacon on 25 April 1787 and priest on 3 June 1787. Hodson became perpetual curate of Little Raveley, Huntingdon, a post he held until his death. By his first marriage, on 15 March 1786, to Charlotte, the daughter of the Revd W. Affleck, a relative of Admiral Affleck, Hodson obtained, through the influence of Lord Sandwich, the rectory of Thrapstone, Northamptonshire, which he held from 1789 to 1828. He also became chaplain-in-ordinary to the prince of Wales and prebendary of Ripon Cathedral. In the 1790s he preached to the Asylum for Female Orphans at Lambeth, and several of his sermons as well as other religio-political addresses (<span class="italic">On the Scarcity and High Price of Provisions</span>, 1795, and <span class="italic">The Great Sin of Withholding Corn</span>, 1795) were published. The claim made in <span class="italic">A Biographical Dictionary of the Living Authors of Great Britain and Ireland</span> that he was forced to give up his preferments and flee to America &#145;in consequence of a discovery particularly disgraceful&#146;, seems to be unsubstantiated, although in 1789 he did publish <span class="italic">A Refutation of the Charges of Plagiarism Brought Against the Rev. Septimus Hodson</span>.<br>
<br>Hodson was married a second time, to Frances, the daughter of G. Burden, before his marriage to Margaret Holford in 1826. He settled with his third wife at Sharow Lodge, Ripon, where he died on 12 December 1833.<br>
