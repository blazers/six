<span class="headword">Wyon,  Olive</span>  (1881&#150;1966), <span class="occ">translator and theologian</span>, was born on 7 March 1881 at 53 Maitland Park Road, Kentish Town, London, the eldest of the two sons and three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37056/', "Allan Wyon")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64499/', "Wyon family")</script>] and his wife, Harriet Gairdner. Her father, a medallist, was her majesty's chief engraver of seals, the eighth member of his family to hold that office. She was educated at home, at Hampstead high school (briefly), and at an Anglican private school. It was only in 1899 during a year in Munich that Olive Wyon discovered that she had a natural flair for languages. For the subsequent five years, however, from the age of twenty to twenty-five, she was kept at home, her duties being housekeeping, cooking, nursing, Sunday school teaching for infants and girls, sick visiting, and being missionary secretary for Haverstock Congregational Chapel. She herself had long wished to become a missionary&#151;ever since she had first read the life of David Livingstone in her early childhood. In the autumn of 1905, therefore, Olive Wyon went to the United Free Church Missionary Institute in Edinburgh, later St Colm's College, intending to offer herself for work with women in central Africa. After eighteen months her health collapsed and, despite successful recuperation in Switzerland where she mastered French, her application was finally rejected by the London Missionary Society on medical grounds. In 1910 she went for a course of religious study at Woodbrooke, the recently founded Quaker college in Birmingham, and she later went to work on the continent under Quaker auspices until the First World War broke out.<br>
<br>The first indication of Olive Wyon's radical social interpretation of Christianity was her public membership, in April 1915, of the unpopular British committee of the Women's International Congress at The Hague, whose two aims were that international disputes should in future be settled by some other means than war and that women should have a voice in the affairs of the nations. Her peace witness continued through her membership of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation in the 1920s. Her other radical stance concerned women, her most explicitly feminist work being <span class="italic">The Dawn Wind: a Picture of Changing Conditions among Women in Africa and the East</span> (1931) which is still of considerable interest and relevance today. She covered the situation of the educated minority of women in central and South Africa, India, China, Korea, Japan, and the Muslim world, in many cases her report being based not only on wide reading but on personal investigation during her travels. Olive Wyon believed that Christ &#145;gave to woman her charter of spiritual freedom&#146;  (Prologue to <span class="italic">The Dawn Wind</span>), but that the church had been too slow through the ages to grant her that liberty. She herself served in the mid-1920s for a short time as minister of a small Baptist church in Rushford, near Ipswich; from 1925 to 1939 she helped the minister of the Kentish Town Presbyterian Church as the director of his Sunday schools; from 1939 to 1945, at the suggestion of Canon Charles Raven, she became unofficial chaplain to women students at Cambridge; in 1947 she was appointed to head the translation department of the World Council of Churches in Geneva, and while there helped to prepare the interim report, &#145;The life and work of women in the church&#146;; finally in 1948 she joined the staff of St Colm's Missionary College, Edinburgh, becoming its principal in 1951 at the age of seventy. In other words her own life demonstrated the capacity of women for spiritual ministry&#151;as indeed did that of her sisters, one of whom was a Congregational minister and the other an Anglican deaconess.<br>
<br>Olive Wyon's reputation in her lifetime centred on her work as an outstanding translator of contemporary protestant theology. In 1929 she translated the massive <span class="italic">Social Teaching of the Christian Church</span> from the original by Ernst Troeltsch, and between 1934 and 1949 all Emil Brunner's primary contributions to theology. In her note to her translation <span class="italic">The Divine Imperative: a Study in Christian Ethics</span> (1936), from Brunner, she took the unusual step of guiding the reader to Brunner's important note at the back on socialism. It was an extraordinary achievement for a woman with no university degree to be acknowledged as one of the world's ablest translators, and Emil Brunner made the remarkable admission that he himself found her translations of his books more intelligible at points than his own German. In 1948 the University of Aberdeen acknowledged her feat by awarding her an honorary doctorate in divinity.<br>
<br>During the terrible period of Nazi tyranny and the Second World War, Olive Wyon testified to the supra-nationalism, supra-racialism, and anti-colonialism of the church. She was in close touch as long as that was possible with the anti-Nazi Confessing Church (Bekennende Kirche) in Germany, and her succinct summary of the revolutionary implications of applying Christianity to the socio-politics of the world in <span class="italic">The Church and World Peace: Principles which Should Govern a Righteous Peace Settlement</span>, with a foreword by Bishop George Bell (1940), based on her reading of the report of the Oxford Conference on Church, Community, and State, <span class="italic">The Churches Survey their Task</span> (1937), testifies to her commitment to a church <i>in</i> the world, that struggles to remedy the injustices and cruelties of the world.<br>
<br>In her own personal spiritual life Olive Wyon was less a seeker than a finder. She was a pioneer of ecumenism, rejoicing to respond to the spiritual vitality and depth that she could find in religious communities as different as the Baptists, the Congregationalists, the Presbyterians, the Anglicans, the Franciscans, the Iona community, the Protestant Women's Religious Order at Grandchamp, the Catholics of Taiz&eacute;, or the Orthodox monastery at Tolleshunt. Between 1943 and 1966 she published more than a dozen works on prayer and the desire for God. It was said of her that she was a practical mystic, one of the great spiritual encouragers and explorers, at home wherever Christ was Lord. At the ages of eighty-four and eighty-five she was still asked to broadcast for the BBC's religious programmes, and she helped Dame Cicely Saunders plan St Christopher's Hospice for the dying. She herself died of a pulmonary embolism and pneumonia on 21 August 1966 at Bruntsfield Hospital, Edinburgh.<br>
