<span class="headword">Vignoles,  Charles Blacker</span>  (1793&#150;1875), <span class="occ">civil engineer</span>, was born on 31 May 1793 at Woodbrook, co. Wexford, the only child of Charles Henry Vignoles (<i>d</i>. 1794), a descendant of a Huguenot military family serving in Ireland, and Camilla (1764?&#150;1794), youngest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14300/', "Charles Hutton")</script>. His father was a captain in the 43rd or Monmouthshire regiment of foot, which was sent out to the West Indies; he was wounded and taken prisoner at the storming of Pointe-&agrave;-Pitre in Guadeloupe in 1794. Soon afterwards he and Camilla died of yellow fever.<br>
<br>Charles Vignoles was brought to England by an uncle, and raised by his grandfather. When eighteen months old Vignoles was gazetted as an ensign on half pay in his father's regiment, a common method of compensating deceased officers' families. He was educated at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, where his grandfather taught, but since his grandfather favoured a legal career he was articled to a proctor in Doctors' Commons for seven years. How long he remained is not known, but in 1813 he rowed with his grandfather, possibly over his decision to give up law, and left home. This breach was never healed.<br>
<br>In November 1813 Vignoles was transferred to the York chasseurs, and soon afterwards was at Sandhurst as a private pupil of Thomas Leybourn, one of the college lecturers. Leybourn was guardian of Mary Griffiths (<i>d</i>. 1834), eldest daughter of a Welsh gentleman farmer, and Charles and Mary became secretly engaged. Assisted by the duke of Kent, Vignoles was commissioned in the 1st or Royal Scots regiment in January 1814. He was present at Bergen-op-Zoom in March, and was then in Canada for eight months. In October 1815 he was made lieutenant and posted to Scotland, and from April 1816 until May 1817 was aide-de-camp to General Sir Thomas Brisbane at Valenciennes, where he produced comparative tables of French and English weights and measures for the duke of Wellington.<br>
<br>Put on half pay in May 1816 and with no private means, Vignoles had to seek his livelihood elsewhere, although he did not leave the army until 1833. After returning to England, he married Mary at Alverstoke, Hampshire, on 13 July 1817, and set sail for America, intending to serve with Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var, but by the end of 1817 he was at Charleston, South Carolina, as assistant to the state civil engineer. In 1821 he became city surveyor at St Augustine, Florida, and in 1823 published a map of Florida. Severe financial problems and news of his grandfather's death persuaded him to return to England in early 1823.<br>
<br>Vignoles worked as a surveyor and wrote articles for the <span class="italic">Encyclopaedia Metropolitana</span>, becoming assistant to James Walker, engineer of the London Commercial Docks. By mid-1824 he had his own office in Hatton Garden, with three pupil assistants. In 1825 he was hired by George Rennie (1791&#150;1866) and Sir John Rennie (1794&#150;1874) to survey a railway between London and Brighton, and a new Liverpool and Manchester line, after parliament had rejected George Stephenson's original scheme. Vignoles moved north and made Liverpool his base for the next fifteen years. His legal training made him a good parliamentary witness, a factor in the success of the second <span class="roman">Liverpool and Manchester Railway Bill</span>, and it brought much similar work subsequently. He was employed as Stephenson's assistant, but a clash of personalities made him resign in January 1827 after disagreements over measurements for Edge Hill Tunnel. Marc Brunel offered Vignoles a post as resident engineer on the Thames Tunnel, but the offer was withdrawn when Brunel realized he could appoint his son Isambard to the post. Vignoles subsequently spent a year in the Isle of Man, surveying government property. He was then recommended by Brunel to straighten the northern section of the Oxford Canal, but fell out with Brunel, after criticizing work on the breached Thames Tunnel and submitting new proposals, which were rejected in June 1830. In 1829 Vignoles was involved in the locomotive trials at Rainhill, working with John Braithwaite and John Ericsson on the <i>Novelty</i>. In 1830 he and Ericsson patented a method of ascending steep inclines on railways (no. 5995). Vignoles also advocated a flat-bottomed rail which would bear directly on sleepers without any chair, but despite occasional trials the rail was never adopted in Britain. On the continent it was, and in Germany and France it was named after him.<br>
<br>During the 1830s Vignoles surveyed and constructed numerous English railways, especially in Lancashire, and also worked in Ireland, France, and Germany. Between 1832 and 1834 he worked on Ireland's first railway, the Dublin and Kingstown Railway, and between 1836 and 1838 he was engineer to the royal commission on railways in Ireland. At the end of the decade financial problems almost ruined him. In 1835 he had surveyed the proposed Sheffield, Ashton under Lyne, and Manchester Railway, and he became the resident engineer. Problems arose with raising the necessary finance, so Vignoles, with the blessing of the company directors, bought many depreciated shares in the names of friends and relatives, on the understanding that they were trustees for himself and that no calls would be made on them. This manoeuvre allowed work to commence, but financial difficulties meant that the directors later insisted that calls be met, leaving Vignoles with a bill for &pound;14,000 he could not meet. He fought the decision, but had to resign. He did recover and pay these debts, but the next three years were difficult. He became professor of civil engineering at University College, London, advocated and built atmospheric railways, and reported on railways in the German kingdom of W&uuml;rttemberg. Then the &#145;railway mania&#146; of 1844&#150;6 brought him much work.<br>
<br>Vignoles had no spectacular engineering achievement to his credit, but in 1846 he was employed to construct the Kiev Bridge in Ukraine, a suspension bridge over 1&frac12; miles long, which brought him fame. In 1847 he moved to Ukraine and lived there until the bridge was completed in 1853. During these years Vignoles paid several visits to England, and on 16 June 1849 married Elizabeth Hodge (<i>d</i>. 1880) at St Martin-in-the-Fields, his first wife, Mary, having died on 17 December 1834. After Russia, Vignoles was involved in some English projects, but his main work lay abroad: the Frankfurt, Wiesbaden, and Cologne Railway; the Western Railway in Switzerland; the Bahia and San Francisco Railway in Brazil; and the Tudela and Bilbao Railway in Spain. In 1863 he retired, and in 1867 acquired a house at Hythe, near Southampton, where he became a country gentleman and JP. He still visited London frequently, actively participating in several scientific societies. On his return from one such visit he suffered a stroke and died four days later, at his home, Villa Amalthea, Hythe, Hampshire, on 17 November 1875. He was buried in Brompton cemetery, London, on 23 November. From his first marriage there were seven children, five of whom reached adulthood. Three of his sons&#151;Charles Francis Fernando, Hutton, and Henry&#151;became engineers, although mental problems forced Charles to retire early. Another son, Olinthus John, became a minister of the Church of England and wrote a biography of his father, published in 1889.<br>
<br>Vignoles joined the Institution of Civil Engineers on 10 April 1827, and became president in December 1869. He became a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on 9 January 1829. Bad weather spoiled his view of a total solar eclipse near Kiev, but while building a Spanish railway he entertained a government astronomical expedition and in 1860 published his observations of this solar eclipse, and in 1870 was part of another government expedition to observe a solar eclipse. He became a fellow of the Royal Society on 7 June 1855, was a founder member of the Photographic Society of London, served in 1855 as a member of the royal commission on the Ordnance Survey, and was connected with the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Institution.<br>
