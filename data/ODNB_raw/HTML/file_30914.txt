<span class="headword">Challans,  (Eileen) Mary</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Mary Renault]</span>  (1905&#150;1983), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 4 September 1905 at Dacre Lodge, 49 Plashet Road, Forest Gate, West Ham, London, the first of two children born to Frank Challans (1875&#150;1941), a physician, and his wife, Mary Clementine Newsome Baxter (1877&#150;1960). Educated locally at Romford House School, she left home to attend Clifton high school in Bristol in 1920. In 1925 she went up to St Hugh's College, Oxford, receiving her bachelor's degree (a third in English) in 1928.<br>
<br>Mary Challans had always wanted to write, but her solitary and bookish childhood in an unaffectionate and unsympathetic family had given her neither the breadth of experience nor the discipline she needed to begin a literary career. Rejecting both marriage and teaching, the two paths generally open at this time to a young woman with a university education, she decided to return to Bristol, hoping to earn her living by odd jobs while trying to write in her spare time. She worked as a clerk and a factory worker while developing a friendship with a young man who introduced her to amateur theatre in Bath. Here she participated in a world which would influence all of her later writing, discovering a bohemian life in which gender as well as social roles were matters of performance. An attractive and athletic young woman with dark, curly hair, she was beginning to develop the dedication to honesty and truthfulness that would shape her public persona and private values. Her writing, however, did not flourish and, pressed by economic circumstances, she developed rheumatic fever and was forced to return to her parents' home in 1932.<br>
<br>Recovering slowly, Mary Challans realized that her work on a novel set in medieval France was insubstantial and unmanageable. Abhorring dependence on her family, she decided on an unusual course which would enable her to earn her own living while giving her the vital contact with people for which she also longed. In 1933 she returned to Oxford to train as a nurse at the Radcliffe Infirmary, becoming a state registered nurse in 1937. Her experiences in hospital nursing gave her an understanding of the body which would inform all of her writing. She also now confronted directly issues of sexual orientation as well as gender and class. Few women with her education entered nursing in the 1930s, and most of her classmates were both younger and working-class. She found herself in an institution with strict hierarchies separating (female) nurses and (male) doctors, a setting in which she also recognized for the first time her own lesbian desire, falling in love in 1934 with a fellow student, Julie Mullard (<i>b</i>. 1911), who became her lifelong companion.<br>
<br>This important relationship both resolved and posed many problems for Mary Challans, not the least of which was how she was to write about issues at once intensely personal and socially challenging. Struggling with both her vocations (nursing, writing) and with her sexual identity in the social and moral context of English life in an atmosphere of war, she completed her first novel, <span class="italic">Purposes of Love</span>, in 1939. Drawing on her own hospital experiences, she chose the pseudonym Mary Renault to mask her identity and embarked on a literary career which would include five more accomplished novels with contemporary settings&#151;<span class="italic">Kind are her Answers</span> (1940), <span class="italic">The Friendly Young Ladies</span> (1944), <span class="italic">Return to Night</span> (1947), <span class="italic">North Face</span> (1949), and <span class="italic">The Charioteer</span> (1953)&#151;before she turned to the historical novels set in ancient Greece which established her reputation.<br>
<br>But Mary Challans was unable, despite the success of her first book, to leave nursing for writing. In 1939 she was called up by the Emergency Medical Service and assigned to Winford Hospital in Bristol where, assisted by conscientious objectors, she briefly worked with Dunkirk evacuees, an experience on which she would later draw both for setting and characters in <span class="italic">The Charioteer</span>, her moving novel about male homosexual relationships. By the end of 1940, she accepted a position as a nurse in the brain surgery ward of the Radcliffe Infirmary, where she continued to work until 1945.<br>
<br>Disillusioned with post-war England, Mary Challans was eager to leave nursing for literature when the war effort no longer required her skills. In part as a result of her good luck in winning an award of $125,000 for the rights to <span class="italic">Return to Night</span> from MGM film studios in 1946, she decided to leave England with Mullard for South Africa in 1948. She never returned. Settling first in Durban, then moving to Cape Town in 1959, she garnered many awards in later years, including an honorary fellowship from St Hugh's in 1982, but the end of the war, her two trips to the Mediterranean in 1954 and 1962, her physical distance from England, and intimacy with Mullard occasioned the shift from the early contemporary novels of manners to the mature historical novels of Hellenic life: <span class="italic">The Last of the Wine</span> (1956), an account of two male lovers during the Peloponnesian War; her two books about Theseus, <span class="italic">The King must Die</span> (1958) and <span class="italic">The Bull from the Sea</span> (1962); <span class="italic">The Mask of Apollo</span> (1966), a novel about the theatre and Greek politics; the first two books about Alexander the Great, <span class="italic">Fire from Heaven</span> (1970) and <span class="italic">The Persian Boy</span> (1972); her fictional biography of Simonides, <span class="italic">The Praise Singer</span> (1979); and the conclusion to the Alexander trilogy, <span class="italic">Funeral Games</span> (1981).<br>
<br>Expatriate life with Mullard in South Africa enabled Mary Challans to devote herself to literature. She was an active member of the PEN Club in Cape Town, serving as its president for many years, but she remained reticent about her personal life while she grew increasingly sure of herself as a writer. Her novels both obscured her life and allowed her to explore issues vital to her (war, peace, heroism, career-vocation, women's roles, sexual expression, and both male and female homosexuality). The clear shift in her work from contemporary to Greek settings has begun to receive important critical attention, for it divides her career in a way which may be obvious if simplistic: the meticulously researched classical settings allow her to mask material too explosive to deal with directly while simultaneously giving her an &#145;academic&#146; freedom to write about her subjects with both personal and critical safety. Mary Renault's reception has been unfairly mixed: she is &#145;popular&#146; with a sophisticated audience, yet only recently have readers begun to take her seriously as a consummate artist not only in her Greek novels but in her earlier work. There are many reasons for this reputation: one must certainly be her femaleness; others include her choice of genre (historical fiction), as well as her public representation in the press as a grey-haired and cardiganed matron. Her interest in sexuality and specifically in homosexuality and fluid gender roles and identities may also have contributed to her marginalization&#151;yet these very interests warrant a re-evaluation of her achievement in an era more liberal than the one in which she began to write.<br>
<br>Mary Challans was at work on a new novel set in France at the time of the crusades when she died of cancer at a hospital near her home, 3 Atholl Road, Camps Bay, Cape Town, on 13 December 1983. After a funeral service at the Anglican cathedral in Cape Town on the 15th, her body was cremated and her ashes scattered at Ceres, near Cape Town, on the plateau above Camps Bay.<br>
