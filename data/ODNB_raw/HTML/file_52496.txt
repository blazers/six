<span class="headword">Butler,  Edward</span>  (1823&#150;1879), <span class="occ">barrister and politician in Australia</span>, was born in co. Kilkenny, Ireland, the son of Michael Butler, tenant farmer, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Joyce. He was educated at St Kieran's College, Kilkenny, where he was encouraged to prepare for the Catholic priesthood. Thomas Carlyle, for whom he acted as a Galway guide on his 1849 journey to Ireland, suggested that he had been rejected as unsuitable. But it is uncertain whether the career decision was his own or that of church authorities. As an adult he remained secretive about this and other details of his early life.<br>
<br>When Butler met Carlyle he was already a Young Ireland enthusiast and a devoted follower of Charles Gavan Duffy, editor of the nationalist <span class="italic">Galway Vindicator</span> and active organizer of potential insurrection. In the 1848 crisis he had been arrested and briefly imprisoned. Duffy later brought him to Dublin to be sub-editor of <span class="italic">The Nation</span>. He was one of the most active campaigners in Duffy's League of North and South, organized to secure election of candidates committed to vote for land reform. But even before Duffy himself had been disillusioned by the parliamentary performance of the Independent Irish Party (1852&#150;5) Butler, lacking the means to prepare himself for a legal career or sustain himself in a political career, had decided to start a new life in New South Wales.<br>
<br>Butler arrived in Sydney in May 1853 and supported himself by working as a journalist while he studied law. Armed with an introduction from Duffy (who later migrated to Victoria), he was offered work on the radical <span class="italic">Empire</span> by Henry Parkes, an admirer of Duffy's, and joined other liberals in challenging the local &#145;bunyip aristocracy&#146;.<br>
<br>Carlyle described the young Butler as &#145;a burly thick-necked sharp-eyed man&#146;  (Carlyle, 189). Later colonial descriptions repeated the emphasis on physical bulk but often mentioned &#145;kindly eyes&#146; and &#145;a rich brogue and humorous style of address&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, 10 June 1879). Colonial conditions stimulated reassessment of his Young Ireland ideas and experience. He seemed always to believe that his liberalism could be reconciled with his Catholicism. In 1858 he gained fourth position in the election of twelve laymen to govern the Catholic college, St John's, within the newly established University of Sydney. Though he joined in criticism of clerical maladministration and of church reliance on state support he was not an anti-clerical, and in the 1870s he became a friend of the new archbishop, Roger Vaughan, who made him one of his four executors. He remained a fellow of St John's from 1858 until his death.<br>
<br>Butler's admission to the bar on 16 October 1855 began a distinguished legal career which ended abruptly twenty-four years later when he collapsed and died while presenting a case in the same court. He was appointed a Sydney district crown prosecutor on 21 January 1859 and prosecuted regularly in both district and supreme court jurisdictions until 1870. He appeared in common law and commercial cases, but was especially admired by fellow professionals for his skill in cross-examination in criminal cases. In one famous case, following a defence address by his friend W. B. Dalley, he began his summing up for the jury: &#145;My learned friend has presented the poetry of the case. I shall now give you the facts&#146;  (Dowd, 250). The accused received a sentence of seven years. By the 1870s he was the recognized leader of the colonial bar. In 1871 he was one of three lawyers appointed with three judges to review legal procedures in the colony. He was made a queen's counsel on 19 November 1873.<br>
<br>It was in association with reforming liberals that Butler was first appointed to the legislative council in September 1861. He resigned from the council in 1863 to concentrate on his legal career, and declined a subsequent offer of the attorney-generalship. When he first contested a seat in the legislative assembly (December 1869) it was in the increasingly bitter sectarian atmosphere of colonial politics following the 1868 attempted assassination of the visiting duke of Edinburgh. He was a popular and successful campaigner: a contemporary observed that &#145;if he had held up an umbrella his people would vote for it&#146;  (Martin, 272). He was re-elected for the seat of Argyle in March 1872, May 1872 (ministerial), and December 1874. When he retired from the assembly in October 1877 he was again appointed to the council, of which he remained a member until his death.<br>
<br>Butler deplored sectarian conflict and its destructive impact on united efforts for reform: &#145;my longing is inexpressible &hellip; for the cessation of [these] terrible animosities&#146;  (Butler to Parkes, 5 Sept [1871], Parkes MSS). His friend Parkes, deeply distrusted by most Catholics, described Butler in 1870 as &#145;the most sterling man in parliament, uncompromised&#146; and the best qualified to lead a &#145;crusade&#146; for liberal reform  (Parkes to Cooper, 28 Jan 1871, Parkes MSS). In a peacemaker role, Butler became Parkes's &#145;greatest electoral asset&#146; in the 1872 campaign which produced a reforming coalition. He was ably assisted by a younger brother, Thomas, who had followed him to Sydney and had, in 1869, become editor of the local Catholic newspaper, the <span class="italic">Freeman's Journal</span>. Parkes offered Butler the office of attorney-general, in which he successfully carried through reform of property law during the following year but was notably less successful with criminal law and equity.<br>
<br>As attorney-general Butler expected to have the traditional first offer when the position of chief justice became vacant in November 1873. The governor, Sir Hercules Robinson, considered him to be &#145;well fitted by character and ability&#146;  (Robinson to Parkes, 24 Oct 1873, Parkes MSS). But, having promised the job to Butler, Parkes then offered it to his conservative political rival James Martin. Butler immediately resigned from the ministry. The unscrupulous Parkes exploited sectarian prejudices and suggested that Butler was part of a &#145;church party&#146; that tried to take over the legal system. Butler, who had first shown willingness to reconsider his candidacy, told Parkes that, once his appointment was opposed on religious grounds, his withdrawal &#145;would compromise in my own person the civil rights of my Roman Catholic fellow citizens&#146;  (Butler to Parkes, 10 Nov 1873, Parkes MSS). The affair greatly exacerbated sectarian conflict in the colony and became part of local Catholic political mythology. However, Butler himself emerged with an enhanced reputation as the most principled of politicians: he was described as a public figure of &#145;transparent honesty of purpose&#146; by Roger Vaughan  (<span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, 12 June 1879), and as &#145;the most attractive of New South Wales nineteenth-century politicians&#146;  (Nairn, 312) in a later historian's assessment.<br>
<br>In 1878 Butler was urged to reduce his workload after heart disease was diagnosed. In the following year he was seriously injured in an accident while driving in the country to investigate a pastoral investment. On his first day back in court, 9 June 1879, he suffered a massive heart attack and &#145;literally died in [legal] harness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, 10 June 1879). He was buried in Petersham cemetery two days later after a requiem in St Mary's Pro-Cathedral presided over by Archbishop Vaughan, from which Henry Parkes was a noted absentee.<br>
<br>Five years after arrival in the colony Butler had married Ellen May Connolly at Parramatta on 1 May 1858 (with W. B. Dalley as witness). They had three sons and five daughters. When Ellen Butler died in 1871 there were seven surviving children, of whom the eldest was only ten. Butler regretted that his busy political and legal life restricted the time he could spend with &#145;my poor little ones&#146;  (Butler to Parkes, [1871], Parkes MSS). On 22 April 1875, in the chapel of St John's College, he married Marion Daintrey, who had converted to Catholicism. They had one daughter, Winifred, whose upbringing became the subject of a bitterly contested equity case after the death of her mother in 1889, highlighting the deep religious divisions in New South Wales society which Butler himself had tried to bridge.<br>
