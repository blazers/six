<span class="headword">Hands <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Herbert]</span>,  Elizabeth</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1746, <em>d.</em> 1815), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized in Harbury, Warwickshire, on 5 June 1746, the daughter of Henry and Ann Herbert, who at that time were resident in Harbury. Nothing further is known of the circumstances of her parents. Within a couple of years the family had moved to Rowington, where Elizabeth grew up. A sister, Mary, baptized there on 6 September 1748, was buried on 9 April 1749. A brother, Thomas, was baptized on 17 April 1750.<br>
<br>From a letter, dated 4 November 1788, from Henry Sacheverell Homer (1719&#150;1791), rector of Birdingbury, to the Revd Richard Bisse Riland of Sutton Coldfield, seeking support for the publication of her poems, Elizabeth is known to have worked as a servant in the household of the Huddesford family of Allesley, near Coventry  (Bedford, 113). It was in Allesley that on 6 September 1784 Elizabeth married William Hands (1746/7&#150;1825) of Bourton-on-Dunsmore. William was then the blacksmith in Bourton, a position which had previously been held by other members of the Hands family. William and Elizabeth had two daughters: Elizabeth, baptized on 29 August 1785, and Ann, baptized on 8 August 1787. The birth of the former is referred to in the poem &#145;On the Author's Lying In&#146;.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Hands had had no formal education. In the advertisement for the subscription for her poems it was noted that she had acquired her knowledge of poetry from the reading available to her in the households where she served. Even so, there is evidence of the breadth of her reading both in the range and skill of her handling of poetic forms, and more directly in the subject matter of some of the poems, particularly &#145;On Reading Pope's &#147;Eloisa to Abelard&#148;&#146; and &#145;Critical Fragments&#146;.<br>
<br>Hands's single published work, entitled <span class="italic">The Death of Amnon: a Poem with an Appendix, Containing Pastorals and Other Poetical Pieces</span>, was published by subscription in 1789. At least four of her poems had previously appeared in the Birmingham and Coventry newspapers under the pseudonym Daphne. Henry Homer's letter asserts that her poems would not have been published but for the interest taken in them by his son Philip Bracebridge Homer (1765&#150;1838), who was an assistant master at Rugby School, and was able to enlist the support of the head of that school, Dr Thomas James, and other masters, who all agreed the poems were worthy of publication. The volume was dedicated to Bertie Greatheed of Guy's Cliff near Warwick, with thanks to him and other friends for their support. Its publication by subscription was advertised in <span class="italic">Jopson's Coventry Mercury</span> of 24 November 1788, and, having attracted some 1200 signatures, its publication was announced in the same paper on 21 September 1789. The reviewer George Ogle, writing in the <span class="italic">Monthly Review</span>, noted &#145;the uncommonly numerous list of subscribers&#146; as testament to the poetic achievement of the writer  (3 Nov 1790, 346). The list included local notables, literary figures such as Anna Seward and the poet laureate, the Revd Thomas Warton, and also members and friends of the Herbert and Hands families.<br>
<br>Richard Gough, reviewing the poems in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> of June 1790, commended the title poem especially  (p. 540). He noted the originality of its subject and urged readers to be tolerant of any &#145;unequal line&#146; which might be found in the five blank verse cantos. The story on which this poem is based is to be found in <span class="roman">2 Samuel</span> 13. Amnon, the son of David, falls in love with his sister Tamar, and with the help of a scheming friend, Jonadab, rapes her. The injury is avenged by her brother Absalom, who orders his servants to kill Amnon. While Elizabeth herself anticipated some opposition to a woman tackling the subject of a rape, she retells the story with sensitivity and control, and provides insights into character which are developed beyond the original material, through the use of dialogue and internal monologue. Hands successfully exploits the potential of blank verse to create a lively narrative which, following the model of earlier eighteenth-century writers, appropriately incorporates heroic similes and moralizing comments from the narrator. Thirty-nine miscellaneous poems complete the collection, providing a variety of poetic form: song, pastoral, ode, pastoral dialogue, epistle, elegy, and occasional poems. A number of common themes run through the collection, most prominently love and friendship. The occasional poems range in subject from the rampage of a mad cow through the village, to a visit of the king and queen to Kew.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Hands's consciousness of the novelty of her situation as a working-class woman poet provides the basis for two comic poems, which anticipate the criticisms her &#145;superiors&#146; were likely to make: &#145;On the Supposition of an Advertisement in a Morning Paper on the Publication of a Volume of Poems by a Servant Maid&#146; and &#145;On the Supposition of the Book having been Published and Read&#146;.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Hands died in June 1815 aged sixty-nine, and was buried in Bourton-on-Dunsmore on 28 June. Her husband, William, lived another ten years, and was buried beside his wife. Hands's poetry was rediscovered in the late twentieth century through the work of Roger Lonsdale, Donna Landry, and Janet Todd, and was republished with an introduction by Caroline Franklin in 1996.<br>
