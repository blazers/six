<span class="headword">Sturgis, Sir  Mark Beresford Russell  Grant-</span>  (1884&#150;1949), <span class="occ">civil servant in Ireland</span>, was born at 17 Carlton House Terrace, London, on 10 July 1884, the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36365/', "Julian Russell Sturgis (1848&#150;1904)")</script>, barrister and novelist, and his wife, Mary Maud, daughter of Colonel Marcus de la Poer Beresford. Educated at Eton College, he came from a landed and literary background. He was assistant private secretary to Herbert Asquith when chancellor of the exchequer (1906&#150;8), and private secretary to him as prime minister (1908&#150;10). He served as a special commissioner of income tax in 1910. On 9 July 1914 he married Lady Rachel Montagu Stuart-Wortley (1894&#150;1968), daughter of the second Earl Wharncliffe of Wortley, Yorkshire. They had two sons (one of whom was killed on active service in 1944) and one daughter.<br>
<br>Sturgis was chairman of the treasury selection board (1919&#150;20). Early in 1920&#151;during the Anglo-Irish War (1919&#150;21)&#151;he was appointed to the British administration in Dublin Castle as part of a new team installed by Lloyd George's government, with Sir Hamar Greenwood as chief secretary. He was listed as private secretary to the under-secretary (Sir John Anderson), though he was originally selected as joint assistant under-secretary with his colleague Alfred &#145;Andy&#146; Cope. As Anderson's principal assistant he was his point of liaison with the viceroy's aide, Richard Wyndham-Quin (later Viscount Dunraven). More important he became the chronicler of events from the vantage point of the castle through his five volumes of diaries, kept from July 1920 to January 1922. A selection from these was published as <span class="italic">The Last Days of Dublin Castle</span> (1999), edited by Michael Hopkinson. This &#145;vivid and breezy&#146; account is informed throughout by &#145;an appealingly cynical view of humanity in general and those he describes as &#147;bigwigs&#148; in particular&#146;  (Hopkinson, introduction, Sturgis, <span class="italic">Last Days</span>, 9). He was, according to one historian, &#145;an amiable man and dashing huntsman, who brought a rare quality of gaiety to the dismal surroundings of the Castle&#146;  (Townshend, 80).<br>
<br>Although a supporter of the union Sturgis was against force being used to maintain it, and believed that the prime minister should make a generous offer of self-government. &#145;The Irish aren't fit to govern themselves&#146;, he once declared, adding the crucial rider &#145;but I'll be damned if the English aren't either&#151;or even the Welsh&#146; (Sturgis, diary, 20 Aug 1920; Sturgis, <span class="italic">Last Days</span>, 17). He was critical of reprisals by crown forces and found fault with the cabinet for turning a blind eye. He saw correctly that these merely diminished support for government policy, and feared that agents of the crown would prove impossible to control, deploring the prevalence of &#145;so much talk as if we had nothing to do but beat an enemy&#146;  (Sturgis, <span class="italic">Last Days</span>, 100). Yet he was in no way sympathetic to Sinn F&eacute;in or to Irish nationalism in general, though he did differentiate between its shades: concerning the Irish self-government bill of 1920, he noted the hostility of &#145;the whole of Irish public opinion, reasonable or unreasonable&#146;  (ibid., 2). His own preferred solution was twofold: an offer of dominion status and the placement of British police and army under the same command. He advised Lloyd George that martial law would succeed in Ireland only if a &#145;take it or leave it&#146; settlement was offered first, to put the onus of war onto Sinn F&eacute;in if it was refused.<br>
<br>When the truce was arranged on 11 July 1921, for which he gave the primary credit to his colleague Cope, Sturgis observed that the Irish had weakened their bargaining position by agreeing to meet on British turf in London. With respect to the partition of Ireland he recorded that Sir James Craig, the leader of the northern unionists, had told him that he was going to sit on Ulster &#145;like a rock&#146; and let the prime minister and Sinn F&eacute;in arrive at a settlement for the south. For Sturgis, as for many of his colleagues in the administration, northern unionism was a closed book, and he contrived never to visit Belfast. He played no part in the negotiations preceding the Anglo-Irish treaty, the successful conclusion of which he ascribed to the leadership skills of Lloyd George. This was &#145;another milestone&#146;, he wrote, &#145;but if Ireland&#151;or England&#151;expects that the golden age is dawning I hope they won't be too roughly disillusioned. It is a huge gamble and we are groping in the dark&#146;  (Sturgis, <span class="italic">Last Days</span>, 227). His diary ends shortly afterwards, on 20 January 1922, with a reference to the discovery of a cupboard full of valuable documents on British&#150;Irish relations &#145;and few later than 1870&#146;  (Sturgis, <span class="italic">Last Days</span>, 228); many of these have since been damaged or lost.<br>
<br>From March 1922 Sturgis was assistant under-secretary of state for Irish services, effectively succeeding both his former superiors Sir Hamar Greenwood and Sir John Anderson, under the aegis of the Colonial Office in London. He had previously contemplated a return to the capital with some distaste: &#145;here one is up the neck in intrigue plot and counterplot with a small spice of danger, all mixed up with the life of something like the big country house in the old days&#146;  (6 November 1920: Sturgis, <span class="italic">Last Days</span>, 68). Refusing to &#145;live like moles&#146; in the castle, he and his wife had continued to enjoy visits to the theatre, horse-racing, and polo during their time in Dublin,  (Sturgis, <span class="italic">Last Days</span>, 20). He was awarded a KCB in 1923 and left his post the following year, finishing his career at the treasury, latterly as presiding special commissioner of income tax. He took the additional surname of Grant in 1935 on inheriting the Hillersdon estate near Cullompton, Devon, and died on 29 April 1949 at 99 Cromwell Road, South Kensington, London.<br>
<br>Sturgis's diary remains an invaluable inside source on the Dublin Castle administration, filling many gaps in official records by revealing informal relationships and the influences of ministers and civil servants upon one another. They give some support to the notion that the vacillation of Greenwood's administration left many important decisions to civil servants. His commentary on the most important participants in this climactic episode is witty and wry, and reveals much of the character of Sturgis, a man whose &#145;insouciant air&#146;, according to Warren Fisher, hid &#145;a shrewd judgement&#146;  (Sturgis, <span class="italic">Last Days</span>, 7).<br>
