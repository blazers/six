<span class="headword">Evans <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Galloway]</span>,  Janet</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1822<span class="mult">x</span>30?), <span class="occ">revolutionary</span>, was born into a comfortable London family. Her brother Alexander Galloway was a mathematical machine maker and an officer of the London Corresponding Society. Janet married his close political colleague <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47140/', "Thomas Evans (b. 1763, d. in or before 1831)")</script>, self-styled &#145;Citizen and Baker, but by profession an Artist&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. hist. c. 296), at some time before May 1794. The couple lived and worked as print colourers in Soho, but by 1796 had moved to 14 Plough Court, Fetter Lane. Here they hosted committee meetings of the Corresponding Society (of which Thomas was now secretary) and of an overlapping revolutionary circle. It was on Plough Court that revolutionary conspiracy in the capital hinged, until 18 April 1798 when Evans, Galloway, and others were arrested. Janet, pregnant and nursing her infant son, Thomas John, was herself detained without trial for a while. She bore stillborn twins soon after.<br>
<br>Janet Evans campaigned vigorously not only for her husband's release but, with Sir Francis Burdett, against conditions and corruption in the prison's regime generally. She was at one point banned from visiting her husband for signalling messages to others imprisoned with him and for inciting a riot outside the gates. Initially she relied on subscriptions organized by Francis Place, but in October 1799 she received a sizeable legacy on the death of her father. This she used to establish Thomas as a patent brace and steel spring manufacturer, following his release in March 1801.<br>
<br>Janet's family remained committed to ultra-radical politics. From 1801 the London revolutionary circle was closely associated with Thomas Spence, and Evans assumed its leadership when Spence died in 1814. Janet and her son, T. J. Evans, quickly became prominent figures within the group. In all likelihood she helped to shape her husband's opinions, for when the Spenceans split in 1819 the role of women among them was one of the issues contested. Janet was attacked as Thomas Evans's &#145;brandy fac'd Dulcina &hellip; &#147;As long as I the breeches wear, I will have all the pelf&#148;&#146;  (Wedderburn). There is no corroborative evidence of her drinking heavily, which the contemporary term &#145;brandy-faced&#146; implies, but she was clearly a strong personality: &#145;Mrs Evans is more furious than ever and bids open defiance&#146;, reported one informer after the Spenceans' failure to turn the Spa Fields meeting of December 1816 into a radical <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>  (TNA: PRO, HO 42/158, 27 Jan 1817). These machinations led to the arrest of her husband and son. Janet wrote extensively to the press and government, demanding their release, while issuing Spencean propaganda from a shop she had begun to support herself. She also smuggled political material in and out of prison and was described by a spy as &#145;endeavouring to <i>revive Spenceanism</i>, and disseminate sedition and disafection [<i>sic</i>]&#146;  (TNA: PRO, HO 42/172, 2 Dec 1817).<br>
<br>However, the family's economic and political fortunes changed sharply in the wake of Thomas Evans's second detention; while Galloway was now a major London engineering employer, Evans's imprisonment caused his business to collapse. On his release the Evanses were politically marginalized. They ran a coffee shop and radical newsroom until, early in 1820, Galloway funded Evans junior's purchase of the <span class="italic">Manchester Observer</span>, and the family moved north. Evans senior began a printing business and they seemed settled, until T. J. Evans was prosecuted for libelling the army; he was gaoled and the newspaper had to be sold. In the summer of 1822 the family returned to London. Henceforward nothing is known of Janet, while Thomas disappeared from view after 1824 and had died by 1831. They may both have died by 1829&#150;30, by which time letters between Place, Galloway, and T. J. Evans mention neither. The couple's own correspondence reveals a warm marriage of equals and confirms that Janet was more than merely supportive of revolutionary principles. For two decades she kept open house for political fellow travellers and their families. From 1798 to 1801, and again in 1817, Janet Evans helped to keep London ultra-radicalism afloat, but the full scope of her contribution to the revolutionary tradition in the capital can only be guessed.<br>
