<span class="headword">Brorda <span class="st"> [Hildegils]</span></span>  (<em>d.</em> 799), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was a Mercian, also known as Hildegils and perhaps of royal birth, who became King Offa's principal counsellor in the 780s and 790s. The name first appears in the witness lists of royal charters in the 760s, and in the 770s was borne by two men, the junior designated <i>praefectus</i> (&#145;reeve&#146;), the senior <i>dux</i> or <i>princeps</i> (&#145;ealdorman&#146; or &#145;prince&#146;). It was perhaps a family appellation. If so, the family may have been based in the area that is now north-eastern Northamptonshire and the soke of Peterborough. At an uncertain date, perhaps in the late 770s, a Brorda with the title <i>praefectus</i> joined with Pusa, the abbot of Medeshamstede (later St Peter's Abbey, Peterborough), in requesting the king to confirm the possessions of the community's dependency of Woking. It may also be significant that in the late 780s or early 790s the <i>praefectus</i> Brorda attested a royal confirmation not far away at Irthlingborough in the later county of Northamptonshire; the fact that his only fellow witnesses were the king, the queen, and the local bishop may indicate that Irthlingborough was home territory.<br>
<br>After 780 the witness lists only once contain more than one Brorda. He almost invariably attests land grants at the head of the ealdormen, usually with the designation <i>princeps</i>, occasionally with some other title such as <i>dux</i> or <i>praefectus</i>. Whether he is to be identified with the <i>praefectus</i> who was earlier the junior of the two Brordas is unclear. In the 790s, at the very end of Offa's reign, he was occasionally designated <i>patricius</i> (&#145;patrician&#146;), a title of especial honour, probably confined to those of royal blood, and perhaps equivalent to chief minister or to the Frankish mayor of the palace.<br>
<br>Brorda seems to have occupied a position of particular prominence during the brief reign of Ecgfrith, Offa's young son and successor (July to December 796), and in the first years of Cenwulf (<i>r</i>. 796&#150;821), who was initially perhaps somewhat insecure since he was only distantly, if at all, related to his immediate predecessors. Almost certainly Brorda, rather than the mysterious Osberht named by William of Malmesbury, was the anonymous <i>patricius</i>, <i>consiliarius</i> (&#145;counsellor&#146;) of the Mercian kingdom (and indeed of the English as a whole), to whom Alcuin sent an important letter in 797. Alcuin's recipient, whom he claimed as a longstanding and loyal friend, was urged to distribute alms and elicit prayers &#145;through the places conferred on you by God&#146;  (<span class="italic">English Historical Documents</span>, no. 202); to admonish his own king and the Northumbrian king Eardwulf on matters of sexual morality; to encourage the Mercian people as a whole to observe King Offa's good laws; to exhort the bishops and clergy to preach and set a good example to the people; and to require loyalty and right judgement of secular lords. Such responsibilities are what might be expected of an experienced chief minister or head of the royal household at the beginning of a new reign.<br>
<br>Brorda seems to have remained senior ealdorman until his death in 799. By then only he and one other received the designation <i>princeps</i>. Alcuin's expectation that Brorda could admonish the Northumbrian king suggests a northern connection which may lie behind the fact that his death in 799 is recorded, most unusually for a Mercian ealdorman, in the northern annals, where he is again accorded the title <i>princeps</i>. After 799 the name Brorda disappears from the witness lists. It appears, however, among the kings and <i>duces</i> listed on the opening page of the Durham <span class="italic">Liber vitae</span>.<br>
