<span class="headword">Sprint,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1623), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist</span>, was born in or near Bristol, the son of <a name="cosubject_26180"></a><span class="headword">John Sprint</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1590), also a <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>. Sprint the elder, the son of an apothecary of the same name from Gloucester, was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1560. He became a fellow and vicar of Berkeley, Gloucestershire, in 1563, graduated BA in 1564, and proceeded MA in 1566. He then gained a succession of preferments, becoming rector of Charlton Mackrell, Somerset, in 1567, vicar of Hambledon and dean of Bristol in 1571, canon of Winchester in 1573, and rector of Martyr Worthy, Hampshire, and canon of Old Sarum in 1574. That year on 23 July he proceeded BD and DD from Christ Church, Oxford. Having become archdeacon of Wiltshire in 1578, he gained a number of livings in that county and in Somerset. In 1584 he became treasurer of Salisbury Cathedral, and remained so until his death in 1590.<br>
<br>John Sprint the younger was elected a student of Christ Church in 1592. He graduated BA on 6 March 1596 and proceeded MA on 21 May 1599. He was ordained and soon made it plain that he was a puritan. On 21 November 1602, at a particularly sensitive time in the religious politics of Oxford, he preached in the university church. The sermon does not survive but Anthony Wood claims that he made &#145;sundry points of Doctrine against the Ceremonies and Discipline now established in the Church of England &hellip; also taxing by cavelling speeches the Vice-chancellor, and other Governors of the University&#146;  (Wood, 2.272). John Howson, the vice-chancellor, demanded a copy of the sermon and when Sprint refused the request he was imprisoned. This was part of, and exacerbated, a campaign of partisan sermons, and eventually the disputants were called before a commission of the privy council. In March 1603 Sprint was required to deliver a public submission before the authorities in Oxford.<br>
<br>In 1602 Sprint was appointed vicar of Thornbury, Gloucestershire, and proved himself to be as yet unreconciled to established ritual. About 1604 he wrote a short piece mainly against rituals lacking scriptural authority. Such ceremonies were seen to be invented by Anti-Christ and maintained in the interests of &#145;Lordly prelacie&#146; with the implication that the government as well as the liturgy of the Church of England was in need of purification. He was finally induced to conform by Samuel Burton, archdeacon of Gloucestershire. Sprint's first published work, <span class="italic">Propositions, Tending to Proove the Necessarie Use of the Christian Sabbaoth</span> (1607), was both reformed and orthodox, with voguish puritan sabbatarianism but a conciliatory tone toward the establishment. A catechism, <span class="italic">The Summe of Christian Religion</span> (1613), was followed by <span class="italic">Cassander Anglicanus: shewing the necessity of conformitie to the prescribed ceremonies of our church in case of deprivation</span> (1618), which became influential among puritan-inclined ministers. Sprint had come to the conclusion, not that the ceremonies were a positive part of worship, but that it was a greater evil to lose the chance to preach than to commit the lesser evil of conducting the ceremonies, providing that these were not imposed in a dictatorial manner. As these arguments came from a writer of proven godliness, they were taken more seriously by puritan clergy than admonitions from the bishops, being cited by moderate puritans in the 1630s.<br>
<br>Sprint married twice. With his first wife he had a son, John, born late in 1605 or in 1606, and with his second a son, Samuel, baptized at Tetbury, Gloucestershire, on 15 January 1622. In 1623 Sprint published a consolatory work, <span class="italic">The Christian Sword and Buckler</span>, but died the same year, at Thornbury, and was buried at St Anne Blackfriars, London. His son John (<i>d</i>. 1658) matriculated from Pembroke College, Oxford, on 26 November 1624 aged eighteen, and after graduation eventually became curate of Hampstead, Middlesex. His son Samuel (<i>d</i>. 1690&times;98), admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1646, was master of Newbury School and rector of South Tidworth, Hampshire, before his ejection in 1662. Licensed as a congregational minister in 1672, by 1690 he was preaching in Andover and Winton.<br>
