</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Tillotson,  John</span>  (1630&#150;1694), <span class="occ">archbishop of Canterbury</span>, was born at the end of September or beginning of October 1630 at Haugh End, Sowerby, Halifax, Yorkshire, the eldest of the three sons of Robert Tillotson (<i>d</i>. 1683), clothier, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1667), daughter of Thomas Dobson of Sowerby. He was baptized on 10 October 1630 at the church of St John the Baptist, Halifax; his godfather was Joshua Witton (<i>d</i>. 1674), one of the ministers ejected in 1662. His brothers were named Joshua and Israel. Robert Tillotson later was a member of the congregational church in Sowerby gathered by Henry Root, and a friend of the presbyterian Oliver Heywood. In his prayers before his consecration in 1691 the archbishop thanked God that he was &#145;born of honest and religious parents, tho' of a low and obscure condition&#146;, that he was born in a time and place where &#145;true religion was preached and professed&#146;, and that out of his small estate his father had given him a liberal education. He was also grateful that he had not inherited the loss of understanding from which his mother had suffered for so many years  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 12.5510&#150;12).<h2>
<a name="Cambridge16471656"></a>Cambridge, 1647&#150;1656</h2>Tillotson's reaction to his puritan upbringing was of enormous importance in shaping his subsequent views of theology and church discipline. Although he abandoned his father's beliefs he kept to the end of his life a deep sympathy with nonconformists for which his high-church enemies never forgave him. He belonged, crucially, to the generation of young men who were educated at Cambridge in the civil war and Commonwealth period and who turned against Calvinist theology, a generation so memorably described by Gilbert Burnet in his <span class="italic">History of my Own Time</span>  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.186&#150;9). After a grammar school education Tillotson was admitted a pensioner at Clare College, Cambridge, on 23 April 1647 and matriculated on 1 July. His tutor was David Clarkson, subsequently ejected in 1662 from the living of Mortlake, Surrey, and described by Richard Baxter as &#145;a Divine of extraordinary worth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.97); his fellow students Francis Holcroft, John Denton, and James Calvert themselves became nonconformist ministers, though Denton later conformed. Clarkson's fellowship had previously been held by the royalist Peter Gunning. Tillotson supported the Independents; he wrote to Root that he felt no scruple about taking the engagement (the 1650 declaration of loyalty to the Commonwealth) and referred to the college's receding hopes of obtaining as master the Independent Thomas Goodwin (who went to Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1650; Ralph Cudworth, the somewhat reluctant master of Clare since 1645, moved to Christ's in 1654). Tillotson graduated BA in 1650, proceeded MA in 1654, and was admitted to a probationary fellowship on 14 November 1650; his first pupil, John Beardmore, was put under him on 7 April 1651. About 27 November 1651 he was elected fellow in succession to Clarkson. Tillotson's conduct in college during the interregnum was much criticized for some years after his death by the nonjurors George Hickes, Charles Leslie, Bevil Higgons, and George Smith; this should not be entirely discounted, despite the indignation of Burnet, Tillotson's biographer Thomas Birch, and other supporters. Apart from unverifiable accusations, for example that Tillotson had introduced thanks for the victory over Charles Stuart at Worcester into the college grace, the principal charge was that he had illegally held the fellowship of which Gunning had been deprived, even though his immediate predecessor was Clarkson, a charge borne out by the fact that the college on Gunning's request ejected him from the fellowship after the Restoration. Tillotson thought himself unfairly treated. In answer to Hickes's accusation in <span class="italic">Some Discourses upon Dr. Burnet and Dr. Tillotson</span> (1695) that during the interregnum the fellows had not dared oppose him because of his interest with his great masters, Denton wrote that Tillotson &#145;was much respected by the senior fellows&#146;; this was confirmed by the sole surviving senior fellow from that time, James Mountain, who had himself fought for Charles I (Whiston, 1.26; Birch, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 12&#150;14). Beardmore is explicit about the feud between the old and new fellows, but says that he &#145;never heard &hellip; any particular reflections upon [Tillotson] from the other party&#146;  (Beardmore, 385).<br>
<br>According to Beardmore's sketch of Tillotson's methods as a tutor and his religious leanings he was &#145;an acute logician and philosopher [and] a quick disputant&#146;  (Beardmore, 382&#150;5). He taught in Latin, which he spoke very well; on Sundays he examined his students in English on the sermons they had heard. He had a great faculty for &#145;<i>conceived</i> [extempore] <i>prayers</i>&#146;  (ibid.) and was &#145;a very attentive hearer of sermons&#146;  (ibid.), attending four every Sunday and the Wednesday lecture at Trinity Church, given in rotation by the best preachers in the university. Beardmore observes that most of the preachers were contra-remonstrants, that is, Calvinists, and that Tillotson regularly heard Thomas Hill, master of Trinity, who preached at St Michael's Church on Sunday mornings and at Trinity Church in the afternoons. Among young preachers &#145;of a freer temper and genius&#146;  (ibid.) Beardmore notes Simon Patrick, with whom Tillotson was later closely associated. It is very likely that he also heard the most influential of the anti-Calvinists, Benjamin Whichcote, then provost of King's College: in his funeral sermon for Whichcote (24 May 1683), Tillotson pointed out that Whichcote preached in Trinity Church every Sunday afternoon for almost twenty years (until his ejection at the Restoration), and &#145;contributed more to the forming of [Cambridge] students &hellip; to a sober sense of religion than any man in that age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.154).<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer16571663"></a>Early career, 1657&#150;1663</h2>It is not clear at what date Tillotson gave up his sympathy for the Calvinist doctrine and congregational discipline of his youth. Beardmore said he &#145;got out of the prejudices of his education, when but a very young man in <i>Cambridge</i>, divers years before the restoration in 1660, or any prospect of it&#146;  (Beardmore, 398). According to Burnet &#145;he happily fell on&#146; William Chillingworth's <span class="italic">Religion of Protestants</span>, &#145;which gave his mind the ply it held ever after, and put him on a true scent&#146;  (Burnet, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 11), but the timing is unknown. In 1656 or 1657 (though still a fellow of Clare) he left Cambridge for London in order to act as chaplain to Edmund Prideaux, Oliver Cromwell's attorney-general, and as tutor to his son. There is no evidence that Tillotson was ordained at this stage. Through Prideaux he ensured that the college was financially compensated for materials seized by parliament during the civil war. He was present at the fast held in Whitehall a week after the protector's death on 3 September 1658, and in later years told Burnet of his revulsion at the blasphemous language used on that occasion by Thomas Goodwin and Peter Sterry, &#145;enough&#146;, Burnet said, &#145;to disgust a man for ever of that enthusiastick boldness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.82&#150;3).<br>
<br>From the last years of the interregnum to the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span> of 1662 Tillotson maintained close links with the groups who were to become nonconformists, but moved towards the episcopal church. In London he met Ralph Brownrigg, the deprived bishop of Exeter, who was preacher at the Temple in 1659, and John Hacket, later bishop of Lichfield. After the Restoration he was present for part of the abortive Savoy conference (April to July 1661) between episcopalians and so-called presbyterians on the reform of the liturgy; Baxter, principal spokesman for the latter, describes him as one of &#145;two or three Scholars and Lay-men, that as Auditors came in with us&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 2.337). About this time he was ordained. The exact date is unknown: Beardmore and Birch suggest 1660 or early 1661, but if Baxter's description is accurate it must have been after the Savoy conference. However, Tillotson is said to have been recommended for a prebend at Ripon in 1660, where John Wilkins was the new dean. This implies an ordination date in 1660, and is difficult to square with Baxter's statement. (Neither Beardmore nor Birch refers to this episode.) Tillotson obtained episcopal ordination from Thomas Sydserf, bishop of Galloway, the only surviving Scottish bishop, who, according to <span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, did not require oaths or subscriptions. The nonjuror George Smith suggested that Tillotson chose him for that reason. Charles II was initially keen to promote prominent puritan divines to high office in the church: Tillotson told Beardmore in 1661 that if Edmund Calamy had accepted the king's offer of the bishopric of Lichfield, William Bates would have been made dean and he would have been a canon. Tillotson preached his first sermon (date unknown) for his Cambridge friend Denton, at Oswaldkirk, Yorkshire. His first published sermon was a lecture delivered at short notice at St Giles Cripplegate in September 1661 on behalf of Bates, vicar of St Dunstan-in-the-West, which was subsequently included in <span class="italic">The Morning-Exercise at Cripple-Gate</span> (1661), edited by Samuel Annesley, rector of St Giles. Denton, Bates, and Annesley were soon ejected from their livings; Tillotson, however, chose to conform to the established church. His first office, in 1661&#150;2, was as curate to Thomas Hacket, vicar of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. After Calamy was ejected from St Mary Aldermanbury, Tillotson was elected to fill his place by the parishioners in December 1662, but refused their offer. He did, however, accept the presentation of the rectory of Ketton, or Kedington, Suffolk, worth &pound;200 a year, from Sir Thomas Barnardiston in June 1663, after the ejection of Samuel Fairclough. According to the historian Edmund Calamy, grandson of the ejected Calamy, &#145;it was no small Ease to Mr. <i>Fairclough</i>, that a man of that Worth did succeed him&#146;  (Calamy, 2.638). Hickes regarded this as another example of Tillotson taking another man's property to which he was not entitled. Fairclough's former parishioners were displeased for a different reason: they &#145;universally complain'd, that Jesus Christ had not been preach'd amongst them, since Mr. <span class="smallcap">TILLOTSON</span> had been settled in the parish&#146;  (Birch, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 18). Tillotson soon abandoned this unfortunate if lucrative rural experiment for far more prominent urban pulpits.<h2>
<a name="Midcareer16631688"></a>Mid-career, 1663&#150;1688</h2>After the ejection of the nonconformist ministers (24 August 1662) Tillotson became a popular and extremely influential preacher in London. He was an occasional Tuesday lecturer at St Lawrence Jewry (a sermon he published in 1694, <span class="italic">Of the Advantages of an Early Piety</span>, was preached at St Lawrence in 1662); on one such occasion when he was acting as a replacement preacher he was heard by Edward Atkyns, later baron of the exchequer, who used his influence to have Tillotson elected preacher to the Society of Lincoln's Inn (26 November 1663). The salary was &pound;100 a year, paid at the end of each term, together with a chamber, commons (meals) for himself and his servant, and &pound;24 for commons during the vacations. He thereupon resigned his Suffolk living. The post at Lincoln's Inn provided him with an audience both intellectually receptive and socially and politically important. In the following year he was elected to the Tuesday lectureship at St Lawrence. His sermons in these pulpits attracted &#145;crouds of auditors&#146;, including lawyers, city merchants, and especially members of the clergy: &#145;many, that heard him on <i>Sunday</i> at <i>Lincoln's-Inn</i>, went joyfully to St. <i>Laurence</i> on <i>Tuesday</i>, hoping they might hear the same sermon again&#146;  (Beardmore, 408). Tillotson steadily accumulated other pulpits and preferments which he held together with these two (St Lawrence was burnt down in the great fire of 1666 and rebuilt by Christopher Wren, 1670&#150;86). He was invited to preach at St Paul's before the lord mayor in March 1664, and expanded the sermon the same year into his first major publication, <span class="italic">The Wisdom of being Religious</span>. He proceeded DD in 1666. His talents were recognized by the court as well as the city: he was appointed one of Charles II's chaplains, and preached from time to time before the king at Whitehall (his first such sermon seems to have been preached on 30 June 1667) and to the House of Commons. The king gave him a prebend at Canterbury (14 March 1670; his predecessor, somewhat ironically, was Gunning, now made bishop of Chichester), and promoted him dean of Canterbury (October 1672), the latter on the separate recommendations of Archbishop Gilbert Sheldon, the duke of Buckingham, and Lord Berkeley. The king also made him a prebendary and residentiary canon of St Paul's (18 December 1675, 14 February 1678), the second of these on the recommendation of John Sharp (later archbishop of York) through the influence of Heneage Finch (later earl of Nottingham). Tillotson held the preferments at Canterbury and St Paul's jointly &#145;in compliance with the times, and because he would not decline what was so frankly offered him&#146; by the king  (ibid., 395).<br>
<br>The vicar of St Lawrence from 1662 to 1668 was John Wilkins, the most important single influence on Tillotson's intellectual development: &#145;that which gave him his last finishing&#146;, said Burnet, &#145;was his close and long Friendship with Bishop Wilkins&#146;  (Burnet, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 12). Tillotson said in his edition of Wilkins's <span class="italic">Sermons</span>  (1682, sig. A3) that he did not know Wilkins before the Restoration (Wilkins moved from Oxford to Cambridge as master of Trinity in 1659, when Tillotson was in London), but they had a great deal in common. Both were firmly convinced of the rational basis of Christianity; both were conformists whose links with nonconformists were close; both regarded ecclesiastical organization and ceremonies as &#145;things indifferent&#146;&#151;things not prescribed in scripture, that the state had the right to determine; both opposed persecution as the way to bring nonconformists into the established church, but neither really understood the reasons for nonconformity; both thought that the pulpit, in the 1640s and 1650s the principal medium of puritan thought with all the doctrinal and political conflict that implied, should be made instead the means of propagating a moderate, reasonable, reconciling religion with a stronger emphasis on morality than on doctrine (but without devaluing the latter). Their nonconformist and high-church critics derisively labelled them and their associates &#145;latitude men&#146; or &#145;latitudinarians&#146;. Tillotson preached at Wilkins's consecration as bishop of Chester at Ely House on 15 November 1668 (John Evelyn was in the congregation) and subsequently spent some time helping him in his diocese in 1671 and 1672. Wilkins was succeeded at St Lawrence by another of Tillotson's formative influences, Whichcote. Tillotson helped Wilkins with his <span class="italic">Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language</span> (publication was delayed until 1668 because of the great fire). On the nomination of Wilkins's friend Seth Ward, bishop of Salisbury and Wilkins's predecessor at St Lawrence, Tillotson was elected on 25 January 1672 a fellow of the Royal Society, of which Wilkins was the guiding spirit. Wilkins died at Tillotson's house in Chancery Lane on 19 November 1672. He made Tillotson executor of his will&#151;on 9 October 1673 the Royal Society decided it was time to call on Tillotson for Wilkins's legacy&#151;and left him his papers to publish at his discretion. Tillotson thus became the guardian of Wilkins's posthumous reputation.<br>
<br>The two men also had a familial relationship. On 23 February 1664 Wilkins officiated in St Lawrence at the marriage between Tillotson and Wilkins's stepdaughter Elizabeth French (<i>d</i>. 1702). (Wilkins was the second husband of Robina French, widow of Peter French and sister of Oliver Cromwell.) The Tillotsons had two daughters, who predeceased them: Elizabeth, the younger, died in 1681; Mary, the elder, married James Chadwick and left two sons and a daughter at her death in November 1687. The fact that Tillotson was related by marriage to the Cromwell family was not lost on his nonjuring critics.<br>
<br>Tillotson's relations with nonconformists in the reigns of Charles II and James II remained cordial and encouraging but also cautious. He advised Beardmore in 1661 not to be sharp on them in sermons, but to win them to the church by good preaching and good living. (In this respect Tillotson was much closer to Wilkins than to his colleagues Simon Patrick and Edward Stillingfleet, who offended the nonconformists by attacking them in print and pulpit.) Beardmore was sure that Tillotson brought in great numbers of nonconformists and was the chief agent for preserving the majority of the citizens of London &#145;from running into extravagancies&#146; against the government of the church  (Beardmore, 400). With the apparent encouragement of Ward and George Morley, bishop of Winchester, and through the medium of Bates, in 1674 Tillotson and Stillingfleet met Baxter and drew up a draft proposal for the comprehension of nonconformists within the established church (a similar attempt made in 1668 by Wilkins and Baxter had come to nothing). But the bishops backtracked, just as Baxter had expected. Tillotson wrote to Baxter on 11 April 1675, &#145;I am unwilling my Name should be used in this Matter; not but that I do most heartily desire an Accommodation, and shall always endeavour it&#146;, explaining that the <span class="roman">Comprehension Bill</span> would not pass either house without the agreement of the king and a considerable part of the bishops  (<span class="italic">Reliquiae Baxterianae</span>, 3.157). Tillotson tried in other ways to break down the barrier between conformity and nonconformity. In 1674 he became a member of the trust (which included Whichcote, Stillingfleet, and the unitarian Thomas Firmin) formed to oversee the scheme for distributing Welsh bibles set up by the ejected minister and philanthropist Thomas Gouge; in his funeral sermon for Gouge (4 November 1681) he emphasized the contributions Gouge obtained from bishops and clergy. In his sermon preached at the Yorkshire feast in London on 3 December 1678 he urged that there should be no differences between adherents of the protestant reformed religion. Only an established national religion could be a sufficient bulwark against popery; &#145;little sects and separate congregations&#146; could never do it. At the same time as arguing that the continuance of nonconformity weakened the protestant cause, he gave great offence to high-churchmen by suggesting that the governors of the church in order to achieve union would give up some &#145;little things &hellip; to the infirmity or importunity, or, perhaps in some very few things, to the plausible exceptions&#146; of the nonconformists  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.24&#150;5).<br>
<br>Tillotson's Erastian view of the established church involved him in some difficulty from both the high-church and nonconformist perspectives when he preached before the king at Whitehall on 2 April 1680. The sermon was subsequently entitled &#145;The protestant religion vindicated from the charge of singularity and novelty&#146;. Hickes seized with glee on this episode. At one point Tillotson claimed that conscience did not warrant any man without an extraordinary commission confirmed by miracles, such as the apostles had, to affront the established religion of a nation, even if it were false, and to draw men off from it, in contempt of the law. All that persons of a different religion could do was enjoy the private liberty and exercise of their own conscience and religion  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 2.253). This was regarded as Hobbism by a lord who heard it and told the dozing king, who immediately commanded its publication. When the nonconformist John Howe read it he expostulated with Tillotson that he had used a sermon against popery to plead the popish cause, and he reduced him to tears. Tillotson's old antagonist Gunning made the same complaint in the Lords. Evelyn thought the whole discourse incomparable.<br>
<br>Despite his many London commitments Tillotson was active throughout these years in the archdiocese of Canterbury. As prebendary (1670&#150;72) and dean (1672&#150;89) of Canterbury he was required by statute to spend at least ninety days a year in residence, twenty-one of them continuous; according to Burnet he more than fulfilled this requirement. In 1683 he was responsible for introducing the weekly celebration of the eucharist in the cathedral. However, in some quarters it was felt that London drew him away: George Thorp, another prebendary and chaplain to William Sancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, suggested unsuccessfully to Sancroft in 1684 that Tillotson be given a living in the diocese so that he could leave Lincoln's Inn.<br>
<br>Tillotson's advice to Lord Russell before his execution in 1683 for his part in the Rye House plot was to be thrown in his face after the revolution. He and Burnet, who both attended Russell in the Tower and on the scaffold, took pains &#145;to persuade him of the unlawfulness of taking arms against the king in any case&#146;  (<span class="italic">Supplement to Burnet's History</span>, 130), even if, as Russell put it, &#145;our religion and rights should be invaded&#146;. Russell was unconvinced, so Tillotson wrote a letter to the condemned man (on 20 July 1683), soon published against the writer's wishes. Here he argued that the Christian religion forbade resistance to authority; that the same law which established the Church of England also declared that it was unlawful to take up arms against authority on any pretence; and that Russell's opinion was contrary to the doctrine of all the protestant churches. Burnet tried to defend Tillotson against Hickes's accusation that at the revolution of 1688 he had apostatized from the doctrine of non-resistance with the argument that he &#145;was restrained by some particular considerations from mentioning &hellip; the case of a total subversion of the constitution, which he thought would justify resistance&#146;  (Birch, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 114&#150;15).<br>
<br>There was no restraint in Tillotson's repeatedly expressed hostility to Catholicism in this period. Beardmore commented &#145;that he scarcely ever preach'd a sermon, without some very home-blow against&#146; popery  (Beardmore, 393). He believed that Catholics had burnt the city on purpose in 1666. When Charles II complained to Sheldon in 1672 about the orchestrated preaching of the London clergy against Catholicism Tillotson suggested as an answer that &#145;it would be a thing without a precedent, that he should forbid his Clergy to preach in defence of a religion which they believed, while he himself said he was of it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 1.308&#150;9). The Catholic duke of York was so offended by his sermon &#145;The hazard of being saved in the church of Rome&#146; (April 1672; privately printed, 1673) that he ceased attending the Chapel Royal. When the duke became King James II, Tillotson was one of several clergy, including Stillingfleet, Patrick, and Thomas Tenison, his successor as archbishop, who directed a &#145;controversial war&#146; against Catholicism in 1686  (ibid., 1.674), and the king complained to Sancroft specifically about Tillotson, Patrick, and Stillingfleet for preaching so much on the subject. When in the following year James II forced Laurence Hyde, earl of Rochester, to have a conference about his religion in his presence with two Catholic priests and two Church of England clergy, with the object of converting Rochester to Rome, Burnet considered that &#145;The king did in this matter great honour to my two friends Tillotson and Stillingfleet, for he excepted against them&#146;, so Rochester chose William Jane and Patrick instead  (<span class="italic">Supplement to Burnet's History</span>, 224). Tillotson was a member of the conference held at Lambeth by Sancroft on 18 May 1688, which led to the decision to disobey James's order that his declaration of indulgence, aimed at Catholics as much as nonconformists, should be read in all churches.<br>
<br>Tillotson had lost the favour of Charles II towards the end of his reign, and never won that of James II. He bought a house at Edmonton, Middlesex, where he could retire during this difficult period. Nevertheless he continued preaching at Lincoln's Inn and St Lawrence &#145;with his usual freedom, or rather with greater zeal and fervency&#146; against Catholicism  (Beardmore, 394). He had many visitors, and his conversation was much valued. Despite the loss of his remaining daughter he had the consolation of friendships kept up by letters with Robert Nelson, soon to be a nonjuror, and Lady Rachel Russell, widow of the executed whig, many of which are included in Thomas Birch's <span class="italic">Life</span>. In the final, most public stage of his life he was to be far more isolated.<h2>
<a name="Writercontroversialistandeditor"></a>Writer, controversialist, and editor</h2>Tillotson published six collections of his writings: four designed as a sequence, his <span class="italic">Sermons Preach'd upon Several Occasions</span> (1671), <span class="italic">Sermons Preach'd upon Several Occasions &hellip; the Second Volume</span> (1678), <span class="italic">Sermons and Discourses &hellip; the Third Volume</span> (1686), and <span class="italic">Sermons Preach'd upon Several Occasions &hellip; the Fourth Volume</span> (1694); and two other important collections, <span class="italic">Sermons Concerning the Divinity and Incarnation of our Blessed Saviour</span> (1693) and <span class="italic">Six Sermons</span> (1694). He also published a large number of sermons separately, and his first three volumes in revised editions. He always wrote out his sermons before delivery in the pulpit (some autograph shorthand examples survive at the Bodleian as MS Rawlinson E. 125), and he revised them meticulously for publication and between editions. His object was evidently through artful rewriting to give the reader the illusion of fluent speech. Joseph Spence noted that &#145;Some of the sermons of Archbishop Tillotson which seem easiest to be wrote and the least laboured, were found several of them wrote over the eighth or ninth time in his study&#146;  (Spence, 1.323, no. 794). He deliberately avoided pedantry, in the form of Latin quotations and references to authorities, and rhetorical tropes and ornaments; he set out to differentiate his practice from that of witty high-church preachers of the earlier part of the century and more recent enthusiastic puritans and nonconformists who worked on their readers' emotions. He strongly supported the theories of Wilkins and the Royal Society on the reform of prose style, which included a pronounced distrust of metaphor. Like Wilkins he thought the misuse of metaphor responsible for doctrinal error. According to Burnet he prepared himself by studying the scriptures, &#145;all the antient Philosophers and Books of Morality&#146;, and the works of Basil and Chrysostom. His work with Wilkins on the <span class="italic">Essay towards a Real Character</span> &#145;led him to consider exactly the Truth of Language and Stile, in which no Man was happier, and knew better the Art of preserving the Majesty of things under a Simplicity of Words&#146;  (Burnet, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 13). Beardmore said &#145;his endeavour was to make all things clear, to bring truth into open light; and his arguments of persuasion were strong and nervous, and tended to gain the affections by the understanding&#146;  (Beardmore, 409). He defined his religious position in relation to four main groups: the two intellectual targets to whom he was unremittingly hostile, atheists and Catholics, and the two groups from whom he carefully dissociated himself but with whom he retained ties of friendship, the nonconformists and the Socinians or unitarians. To atheists and Catholics he stressed the rational grounds of faith and the close connection between natural and revealed religion; to nonconformists that justification included obedience and faith included works; and to Socinians that Christianity required the acceptance of mysteries incomprehensible to reason. His collections were carefully structured to lead the reader through arguments for natural religion and the advantages, both worldly and otherworldly, of practising the precepts of revealed religion, culminating in a carefully restrained exposition of its mysteries. He gave the greatest weight to Christian practice. Burnet summed up his position very fairly as follows:<blockquote>He indeed judged that the great design of Christianity was the reforming Mens Natures, and governing their Actions, the restraining their Appetites, and Passions, the softning their Tempers, and sweetning their Humours, the composing their Affections, and the raising their minds above the Interests and Follies of this present World, to the hope and pursuit of endless Blessedness: And he considered the whole Christian Doctrine as a System of Principles, all tending to this. (Burnet, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 31&#150;2)</blockquote>In the course of the 1660s Tillotson shifted his attack from atheism and infidelity (his target in <span class="italic">The Wisdom of being Religious</span>) to Catholicism. According to Burnet he did this because &#145;he saw that Popery was at the root of this, and that the Design seemed to be laid, to make us first Atheists, that we might be the more easily made Papists&#146;  (Burnet, <span class="italic">Sermon</span>, 15). In 1666 he published <span class="italic">The Rule of Faith</span>, an attack on <span class="italic">Sure-Footing in Christianity, or, Rational Discourses on the Rule of Faith</span> (1665) by the Catholic apologist John Sergeant, who had attacked Stillingfleet's <span class="italic">Rational Account of the Grounds of the Protestant Religion</span> (1664) in his third appendix. Tillotson dedicated his book to Stillingfleet, and included as an appendix a reply by Stillingfleet to Sergeant; he went on to make a lengthy attack on Sergeant's ironically titled <span class="italic">Letter of Thanks</span> (1666) in the preface to his first collection of sermons (1671). <span class="italic">The Rule of Faith</span> was a contribution to a long-running debate going back to the anti-Catholic writing of William Laud and William Chillingworth in the 1630s; its philosophical importance lies in its attempt to define the basis of certainty, the relation between reason and faith, and the grounds of assent to Christian doctrine. Tillotson further developed part of his argument in <span class="italic">A Discourse Against Transubstantiation</span> (1684, included in the third volume of 1686).<br>
<br>Later in his career Tillotson turned his attention to a completely different target, Socinianism or unitarianism (which denied the doctrine of the Trinity on scriptural grounds), but his tone here was much more accommodating. He had long been a friend of the Socinian philanthropist Firmin, who, according to Stephen Nye, knew all the London divines and had provided preachers for St Lawrence when Tillotson was busy as dean at Canterbury. In 1679&#150;80 Tillotson preached a group of four sermons on the divinity of Christ; he published these in 1693 partly to counter the malicious accusations of nonjuring critics that he was himself a Socinian, and partly for Firmin's benefit. He thought the Socinians (unlike the Catholics, whom he held in contempt) &#145;a pattern of the fair way of disputing&#146;, but they had one great defect: truth was not on their side  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.244&#150;5). The unpersuaded Firmin engaged Nye to write an answer, <span class="italic">Considerations on the &hellip; Doctrine of the Trinity</span> (1694); after reading it Tillotson told Firmin, &#145;<i>My Lord of</i> Sarum [Burnet] <i>shall humble your Writers</i>&#146;, but he continued their friendship unaltered  (Nye, 17).<br>
<br>Tillotson served an extremely valuable function as an editor, scrutinizer, and promoter of other men's writings. In 1675 he published what proved the most influential and popular of Wilkins's works, <span class="italic">Of the Principles and Duties of Natural Religion</span>, with a preface explaining his contribution (Wilkins had left twelve chapters prepared for the press, and Tillotson edited fourteen more) and summarizing the book's argument. In 1682 he brought out the second collection of Wilkins's sermons; his prefatory essay, &#145;The publisher to the reader&#146;, contains an interesting account of their author, whom he defended energetically from the attack in Anthony Wood's <span class="italic">Historia et antiquitates universitatis Oxoniensis</span> (1674). He also acted as literary executor to Isaac Barrow. In 1680 he published Barrow's anti-Catholic <span class="italic">Treatise of the Pope's Supremacy</span>, for which Barrow gave him permission on his deathbed. He worked for ten years on Barrow's sermons, only one of which had appeared in print in his lifetime: he published a number of separate collections, and the <span class="italic">Works</span> in a three-volume folio edition (1683&#150;7). (The accusation by Barrow's nineteenth-century editor Alexander Napier that Tillotson extensively altered the sermons has been conclusively refuted by Ir&egrave;ne Simon.) He also edited Hezekiah Burton's posthumous <span class="italic">Discourses</span> (1684&#150;5).<br>
<br>In addition to acting as literary executor Tillotson read and commented on his friends' work in progress and gave them valuable advice. He was probably the &#145;judicious and learned Friend, a Man indefatigably zealous in the service of the Church and State&#146; referred to by John Dryden in the preface to <span class="italic">Religio laici</span> (1682), the friend who advised the poet to omit his bold criticism of Athanasius  (Brown, &#145;Dryden's <i>Religio laici</i>&#146;). He helped the nonconformist Samuel Cradock with writing his <span class="italic">Harmony of the Four Evangelists</span> (1668), and another nonconformist, Matthew Poole, with the subscriptions for his <span class="italic">Synopsis criticorum</span> (1669&#150;76). The person to whom he gave most help of this kind was Burnet. Tillotson, William Lloyd (later bishop of Worcester), and Stillingfleet were asked by Burnet to read the manuscript of his <span class="italic">History of the Reformation of the Church of England</span>, a work that proved central to anti-Catholic polemic in the 1680s; Burnet thanked them effusively in his preface to the first volume (1679). Tillotson may have had a hand in Burnet's life of John Wilmot, earl of Rochester (1680). When he became archbishop he enlisted Burnet in his and Mary II's campaign for church reform. Burnet's <span class="italic">Discourse of the Pastoral Care</span> (1692) was written at the suggestion of Tillotson and the queen; Tillotson read it in manuscript and told Burnet, &#145;The work is as perfect in its kind, as I hope to see any thing&#146;  (Birch, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 266). Burnet's <span class="italic">Exposition of the Thirty-Nine Articles</span> (1699) was written as a result of a similar request; Tillotson read it in manuscript, made some alterations, and congratulated Burnet on his treatment of some very difficult theological questions. He also asked Burnet to contribute to his proposed new book of homilies, a scheme which came to nothing; Burnet, however, was to publish his contribution in 1713. A work with which Tillotson became associated in a rather different way is the <span class="italic">Historia Inquisitionis</span> (1692) by the Dutch remonstrant theologian Philip van Limborch. Limborch wrote to their mutual friend John Locke on 17 June 1692, saying that he wanted to dedicate the <span class="italic">Historia</span> to Tillotson. Tillotson agreed, subject to checking the text of the dedication, and a copy of the book duly reached him in November. In the dedication approved by Tillotson, Limborch praised him as chosen by providence so that under his influence the reformed churches might lay aside their disputes and unite in support of the gospel against the cruelty of Rome; it illustrates both his growing international reputation and the way in which he wanted his career to be understood.<h2>
<a name="Thefinalstage16891694"></a>The final stage, 1689&#150;1694</h2>Tillotson felt unqualified admiration for the new monarchs, William III and Mary II. He believed that God &#145;in great mercy to a most sinful and perverse people&#146; had set them on the throne of the three kingdoms &#145;to be our deliverers and benefactors for many generations yet to come&#146;  (prayers before his consecration, <span class="italic">Works</span>, 12.5510). They embodied his two main aims: William was to unite his protestant subjects and deliver them from popery, and Mary was to effect their religious and moral reformation by her example. He saw these hopes only partly fulfilled. Among other London clergy Tillotson was recommended for preferment to the prince of Orange by Burnet in December 1688 (he may have met the prince and princess at Canterbury in 1677, but he was not involved in the invitation extended to William). He preached before the prince at St James's on 6 January 1689, and gave &#145;A thanksgiving sermon for our deliverance&#146; at Lincoln's Inn on 31 January, the official thanksgiving day. When Patrick published his own sermon delivered on the same occasion he met with such obloquy that Tillotson published his, so Patrick said, &#145;that I might not stand single, but they might have somebody else to rail at as well as me&#146;  (<span class="italic">Auto-biography</span>, 142&#150;3). Tillotson was soon promoted: the new king on his accession made him one of his chaplains, and on 27 April his clerk of the closet. At this time Tillotson let it be known that he did not wish to be a bishop. However, in August the chapter of Canterbury Cathedral gave him archiepiscopal jurisdiction, following Archbishop Sancroft's suspension for refusing to recognize the new monarchs, and in September William agreed to move him from the deanery of Canterbury to that of St Paul's (he was installed on 21 November), following Stillingfleet's promotion as bishop of Worcester. This was the limit of Tillotson's ambition, but William indicated that he intended in due course to make him archbishop of Canterbury. The dismayed Tillotson blamed Burnet for this arrangement  (letter to Lady Russell, 19 Sept 1689; Birch, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 205&#150;6).<br>
<br>The year 1689 saw the lasting failure of Tillotson's hope for the comprehension of the nonconformists within the established church. In 1688 Sancroft had made conciliatory moves towards them as a way of making them allies against James II's attempt to tolerate Catholics, and had formed a committee, of which Tillotson was a member, with the intention of making alterations to the liturgy in order to bring the nonconformists in. According to Patrick, on 14 January 1689 Tillotson, Patrick, and others met at Stillingfleet's house to discuss the preparation of a comprehension bill, apparently with Sancroft's permission. But under William comprehension was less important to nonconformists than toleration, and it was deeply unappealing to most churchmen. After the withdrawal of the <span class="roman">Comprehension Bill</span> and the passing of the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> (24 May), William agreed that the question of comprehension should be considered by convocation (the assembly of the clergy) before it went to parliament again, and on 13 September he set up an ecclesiastical commission to prepare matters. This procedure, which Tillotson recommended to the king, proved disastrous, but Tillotson optimistically sent a list of &#145;Concessions, which will probably be made by the church of <i>England</i> for the union of Protestants&#146; to Lord Portland on the same day. The members of the commission, initially consisting of ten bishops and twenty other divines, including Tillotson, were to make recommendations concerning the liturgy and canons, the ecclesiastical courts, and clerical conduct to convocation, parliament, and king. They met regularly in October and November (Tillotson attended fourteen sessions), but many high-church members either failed to appear or dropped out. The hard core, who included Tillotson, Stillingfleet, Patrick, Burnet, Tenison, Richard Kidder, and John Williams (later bishop of Chichester), produced a revised liturgy in the form of an interleaved folio prayer book (Lambeth MS 2173, text in Fawcett), in which there were many concessions to nonconformist sensibilities. But this liturgy was never discussed by convocation, which met first in late November, and never reached parliament. Tillotson was the comprehenders' nominee for prolocutor of the lower house of convocation, but the high-church candidate, William Jane, easily defeated him. After fruitless exchanges between the two houses of bishops and clergy convocation was prorogued and dissolved (January 1690). Comprehension was now a lost cause.<br>
<br>William pressured Tillotson into accepting the archbishopric partly by telling him that if he refused he would not fill any of the bishoprics held by nonjurors. Tillotson capitulated in October 1690, but succeeded in delaying his appointment until the following year. The nonjuror Henry Dodwell wrote to warn him on 12 May 1691 that by accepting he would &#145;make it impossible for the Catholick [which is to say, universal] Church to subsist, as distinct &amp; independent on the State; which will fundamentally overthrow the very Being of a Church as a Society&#146;  (G. Every, <span class="italic">The High Church Party, 1688&#150;1718</span>, 1956, 66). Tillotson was nominated on 23 April 1691 and consecrated on 31 May at St Mary-le-Bow by, among others, bishops Burnet and Stillingfleet; the sermon was preached by Ralph Barker, later his chaplain and editor. Sancroft was still living at Lambeth Palace until his ejection on 23 June. Tillotson was granted the emoluments of the see, backdated to the previous autumn; he moved into Lambeth on 26 November, having made many repairs and improvements, including the building of a new apartment for his wife. Evelyn, who was shown the house, furniture, and garden by Tillotson's successor Tenison, described them as &#145;all very fine, &amp; far beyond the usual ABshops&#146;  (6 July 1695; Evelyn, 5.213).<br>
<br>Tillotson told Lady Russell on 23 June 1691 that &#145;The Queen's extraordinary favour to me, to a degree much beyond my expectation, is no small support to me&#146;  (Birch, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 249). In his three and a half years as archbishop, with Burnet's assistance he worked closely with Mary on a programme to reform the manners of the people in general and the clergy in particular. His position gave him more privacy than before, and the opportunity to revise his sermons: though he thought &#145;the reformation of this corrupt and degenerate age in which we live is almost utterly to be despaired of&#146;, he published his <span class="italic">Six Sermons</span> (1694) on family religion and education in order to help &#145;recover the decayed piety and virtue of the present age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Works</span>, 3.395&#150;6). Mary and he organized an elaborate series of national fasts and thanksgivings in connection with William's military campaigns. Large numbers of sermons preached at court were published, at least nine of them by Tillotson. In 1692, after meeting his bishops at Lambeth, he instructed them by letter to exercise control of clerical ordinations and residence and remove scandalous clergy, and to enforce the moral discipline of their congregations, a programme that had already been set out in a letter from the king to the bishop of London, Henry Compton, in 1690, and that was embodied in the clerical handbook Tillotson admired so much, Burnet's <span class="italic">Discourse of the Pastoral Care</span>. In August 1694, after another such meeting with his bishops, he decided to follow Burnet's suggestion that the injunctions he had drafted should be issued by the king and queen, partly &#145;that their Majesties care and concernment for our religion might more manifestly appear to the general satisfaction of the nation&#146;  (Birch, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 310). The injunctions required the bishops among other things to ensure that the clergy led exemplary lives, regularly held public prayers and celebrated communion frequently, and fulfilled their pastoral duties. This scheme had the queen's approval. However, the deaths of both archbishop and queen later that year meant that the injunctions were not issued by King William until the following February.<br>
<br>Tillotson presided over a divided church. Though dearly loved by his latitudinarian colleagues and many nonconformists, he was hated by some of the nonjurors (a bundle of their libels was found among his papers after his death), and distrusted by many of the clergy. Burnet was convinced that he &#145;was persecuted by Malice to his grave&#146;  (G. Burnet, <span class="italic">Discourse of the Pastoral Care</span>, preface to 3rd edn, 1713, sig. A9). One of Tillotson's last letters to Burnet (23 October 1694), on the latter's <span class="italic">Exposition of the Thirty-Nine Articles</span>, indicates why he was so controversial: he wrote dismissively of the Athanasian creed (which required acceptance of the doctrine of the Trinity and anathematized anti-Trinitarians), &#145;I wish we were well rid of it&#146;  (Birch, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 315). Yet the manner of his death shows his capacity for transcending party rancour. A few days after suffering a stroke in the chapel at Whitehall he died on 22 November 1694 in the arms of his nonjuring friend Nelson. He was buried on 30 November in St Lawrence Jewry, the church with which he had been associated for thirty years, as recorded in the monument erected by his wife. Burnet's laudatory funeral sermon was judged by Calamy not to exceed the truth  (Calamy, 1.537). The king told Tillotson's son-in-law James Chadwick, &#145;He was the best man, that I ever knew, and the best Friend, that I ever had&#146;  (Birch, <span class="italic">Life</span>, 424).<br>
<br>Tillotson spent all his income on charity and the expenses of his position. According to <span class="italic">The Tatler</span>, no. 101 (1 December 1709), after her husband's death Elizabeth Tillotson would have been left &#145;in a narrow Condition&#146;  (Bond, <span class="italic">Tatler</span>, 2.122) had not the copyright of his sermons brought in &pound;2500 (Birch gives the figure in guineas). Probably no thought had been given to providing for the first widow of an archbishop of Canterbury since the Reformation. The king granted her an annuity of &pound;400 on 2 May 1695, increased by &pound;200 on 18 August 1698, following her son-in-law's death and representations made on her behalf by William Sherlock and Nelson. She was responsible for educating Tillotson's nephew Robert&#151;his brother Joshua's son, who, like his uncle, became a fellow of Clare College&#151;and her three Chadwick grandchildren. Birch obtained some information from Tillotson's great-nephew Joshua, his brother Israel's grandson, surmaster of St Paul's School; Sir Philip Nichols, author of the article on Tillotson in the <span class="italic">Biographia Britannica</span>, knew Robert Tillotson in Cambridge between 1722 and 1728.<h2>
<a name="Reputationandinfluence"></a>Reputation and influence</h2>At the time of his death Tillotson seemed to his supporters to have saved the church, and to his detractors to have reduced it to an instrument of the state. His two elegists, Nahum Tate and Samuel Wesley, celebrated his triumphs over &#145;Gigantick <i>Atheism</i>&#146;, &#145;<i>Rome</i>'s Dragon&#146;, and &#145;the <i>Polish Monster</i>&#146; Socinianism (N. Tate, <span class="italic">An Elegy on &hellip; John, Late Lord Archbishop of Canterbury</span>, 1695, 6; S. Wesley, <span class="italic">Elegies on the Queen and Archbishop</span>, 1695, 20&#150;22). George Hickes, repudiating Burnet's saintly portrait, called him &#145;a Person of great and dangerous Example, both to present Times and Posterity&#146; and &#145;a Man of all Times, and all Governments, Right or Wrong&#146;  (Hickes, sig. b<i>v</i>, 52). In the century following his death Tillotson was widely read and admired, and sometimes berated, misused, and argued with; he exercised a continuing influence in many fields, the pulpit, literature, lexicography, education, philosophy, and theology.<br>
<br>Burnet's account of Tillotson as preacher remained true for many years: &#145;His Sermons were so well heard and liked, and so much read, that all the Nation proposed him as a Pattern, and studied to copy after him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Bishop Burnet's History</span>, 2.135). By the time of his death fifty-four sermons and <span class="italic">The Rule of Faith</span> had appeared, but he left 200 unpublished; these were edited by Ralph Barker in fourteen volumes from 1695 to 1704, with a dedication to the king by Elizabeth Tillotson. According to Birch a sermon attacking the nonjurors was suppressed at this time and probably lost. Up to 1735 there were ten collected editions of the fifty-four sermons and <span class="italic">The Rule of Faith</span>; between 1712 and 1735 there were five editions of Barker's posthumous collection of the 200 sermons; in 1728 the two collections were brought together, totalling 254 sermons and <span class="italic">The Rule of Faith</span>. In 1752 Birch in his new edition increased the number to 255 by including Tillotson's sermon in Annesley's <span class="italic">Morning-Exercise at Cripple-Gate</span>. Tillotson's contribution to this last collection was flagged in the second edition of <span class="italic">Athenae Oxonienses</span> by Anthony Wood, with the ironic description of Tillotson as &#145;then a Nonconformist, since gainer of considerable Preferments&#146;  (Wood, <span class="italic">Ath. Oxon.</span>, 2nd edn, 2 vols., 1721, 2.968). Twenty years after Birch's edition of 1752 a collection of the works was published in Edinburgh. There was no nineteenth-century collected edition.<br>
<br>Country clerics found these readily available editions invaluable. In <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, no. 106 (2 July 1711), Sir Roger de Coverley informs Mr Spectator that together with the living he presented the village parson with &#145;all the good Sermons which have been printed in <i>English</i>, and only begged of him that every <i>Sunday</i> he would pronounce one of them in the Pulpit&#146;  (Steele and Addison, 1.441). The list for the year is headed by Tillotson. Other users were more subtle. The mid-century sermons of Laurence Sterne and James Woodforde, like those of so many of their colleagues, are full of echoes and borrowings from Tillotson.<br>
<br>Reliance on Tillotson's works was by no means limited to the clergy. Congreve's telling comment on Dryden, first published in his dedication of Dryden's <span class="italic">Dramatick Works</span> (1717), was regularly repeated in the biographical dictionaries: &#145;I have heard him frequently own with pleasure, that if he had any talent for English Prose, it was owing to his having often read the writings of the great Archbishop <i>Tillotson</i>&#146;  (Bayle and others, 4.685, n. EE). Locke championed Tillotson as a model for clearness and propriety of language in &#145;Some thoughts concerning reading and study for a gentleman&#146;, first published in 1720. Nelson advised his godson George Hanger, who was going to Smyrna as a merchant, to study his works not only to learn &#145;true notions of religion, but also the way and manner of writing English correctly and purely; his style I take to be the best standard of the English language&#146;  (C. F. Secretan, <span class="italic">Memoirs of &hellip; Robert Nelson</span>, 1860, 199&#150;200). This view was shared by eighteenth-century lexicographers: Joseph Addison marked phrases in the sermons Tillotson published in his lifetime for a projected dictionary, Alexander Pope included Tillotson in a list for a similar venture  (Spence, 1.170 [no. 389]), and Samuel Johnson cited him over 1000 times in his <span class="italic">Dictionary</span> (1755), far more often than Stillingfleet, Burnet, or Wilkins.<br>
<br>Tillotson's presence can also be traced in guides for students published right through the century. In a letter to Richard King of 25 August 1703 (first published in 1714) Locke wrote in answer to a request for advice:<blockquote>if you desire a larger View of the Parts of Morality, I know not where you will find them so well and distinctly explain'd, and so strongly inforc'd, as in the Practical Divines of the Church of England. The Sermons of Dr. Barrow, Archbishop Tillotson, and Dr. Whitchcot, are Masterpieces in this kind. (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John Locke</span>, 8.57)</blockquote>Wilkins's handbook <span class="italic">Ecclesiastes</span>, as revised by John Williams on Tillotson's instructions for the seventh edition of 1693 and dedicated to him, and further revised in the eighth edition of 1704, adds the names of the major latitudinarian authors of the previous thirty years to Wilkins's reading lists, including of course Tillotson himself. The Cambridge Calvinist John Edwards objected strongly to this procedure in his own handbook <span class="italic">The Preacher</span> (1705): complaining of the great degeneracy from Reformation doctrines in some churchmen in late times he emphasized that Wilkins's original lists consisted of orthodox Calvinist writers, and that the recent editors of <span class="italic">Ecclesiastes</span> had &#145;filled it with a great deal of Trash&#146;  (J. Edwards, <span class="italic">The Preacher</span>, 2nd edn, 1705, xxii). Tillotson's name is pointedly omitted from Edwards's own &#145;Catalogue of some authors who may be beneficial to young preachers and students in divinity&#146;. A much more positive view of Tillotson was taken by the high-churchman Daniel Waterland in his <span class="italic">Advice to a Young Student</span> (first published in 1730 but written twenty-five years earlier for the use of his students at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and reissued in a revised edition in 1755). The four-year course for the divinity student is divided into three categories, philosophical, classical, and religious. In the table of religious books for the second year, only one author is recommended: Tillotson. Waterland does, however, warn the student, &#145;There is one or two Points of Doctrine, particularly that of Hell-Torments, justly exceptionable&#146;  (1730, 22, 24). (The reference here is to Tillotson's sermon of 7 March 1690, which caused great offence through the suggestion that hell torments might not be eternal. There is a long note on this topic in Birch's article on Tillotson in <span class="italic">A General Dictionary</span>, 9.575&#150;6, n. N.) As a young man the dissenting educationist Philip Doddridge was unsympathetic to the mid-seventeenth-century Calvinist tradition; in a letter of 1722 he wrote, &#145;In practical divinity, Tillotson is my principal favourite&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of the Correspondence of Philip Doddridge</span>, ed. G. F. Nuttall, 1979, 2, no. 8). In his <span class="italic">Lectures on Preaching</span> (containing lectures delivered in the 1730s and 1740s, but not published until 1804), Doddridge included an account of the writers of the established church and explained his admiration for Tillotson:<blockquote>There is such an easiness in his style, and beautiful simplicity of expression, as seems easy to be imitated; yet nothing more difficult &hellip; in controversy no man found such lucky arguments, nor represented the sentiments of his adversaries more fully, artfully, and advantageously for confutation. (1821 edn, lecture 4, 25)</blockquote>A late example of the educational use of Tillotson is to be found in <span class="italic">A Collection of Theological Tracts</span> (1785) by Richard Watson, regius professor of divinity at Cambridge. Although no work by Tillotson is included among the tracts, in the lengthy &#145;Catalogue of books in divinity&#146; (appended to volume 6) Tillotson's works are recommended several times, together with Birch's <span class="italic">Life</span>, and Watson's admiration for Tillotson and his latitudinarian contemporaries is frequently stressed.<br>
<br>Throughout the century many writers of different persuasions made use of or responded to specific aspects of Tillotson's arguments. Early eighteenth-century freethinkers often associated themselves with Tillotson and drew on his assumed sympathy for their views about the role of reason to bolster their positions. The third earl of Shaftesbury quotes at length from <span class="italic">The Rule of Faith</span> in the final chapter of <span class="italic">Characteristicks</span> in support of freethinking, nominating Tillotson together with Jeremy Taylor &#145;Free-<i>thinking Divines</i>&#146;  (2nd edn, 1714, 3.329&#150;34, 297). Anthony Collins in <span class="italic">A Discourse of Free-Thinking</span> (1713) notoriously praised Tillotson as one &#145;whom all <i>English Free-Thinkers</i> own as their Head, and whom even the Enemys of <i>Free-Thinking</i> will allow to be a proper Instance to my purpose&#146;  (p. 171). Jonathan Swift's parody, <span class="italic">Mr. C&#151;ns's Discourse of Free-Thinking</span> (1713), has been wrongly interpreted by some modern readers as supporting the same view. &#145;[N]one better understood Human Nature&#146; than Tillotson, claimed Matthew Tindal in <span class="italic">Christianity as Old as the Creation</span>  (1730, 64). David Hume developed the argument that Tillotson had used against transubstantiation and in defence of miracles (in &#145;The hazard of being saved in the church of Rome&#146; and elsewhere) as the basis for his attack on miracles in his <span class="italic">Philosophical Essays</span> (1748). Edmund Gibson, bishop of London, who defended Tillotson and his colleagues in his <span class="italic">Second Pastoral Letter</span> (1730), was anxious to prevent them being misread as rationalists; Gibson emphasized in reply to Tindal that the arguments of Wilkins and Tillotson about reason and morality should be understood historically, as responses to the tradition of puritan preaching.<br>
<br>Just as Tillotson's name was invoked on both sides in the debate about freethinking and the sufficiency of natural religion without revealed, so it figured in the Methodist debate about formal or nominal versus inward Christianity. In <span class="italic">Three Letters from the Reverend Mr. G. Whitefield</span> (1740), published in Philadelphia, Whitefield defended an earlier statement &#145;<i>That Archbishop</i> Tillotson <i>knew no more about</i> true <i>Christianity than</i> Mahomet&#146; on the grounds that Tillotson &#145;knew of no other than a bare historical Faith: And as to &hellip; our Justification by Faith alone (which is the doctrine of Scripture and of the Church of England), he certainly was as ignorant thereof as Mahomet himself&#146;. He claimed that he had heard this view first from John Wesley  (pp. 2&#150;3). In an early unpreached sermon, &#145;Hypocrisy in Oxford&#146; (written in 1741, published in 1797), Wesley did attack Tillotson for teaching that good works were necessary to justification. However, Wesley came to take a more lenient view: in volume 45 of <span class="italic">A Christian Library</span> (1755) he extracted two of Tillotson's sermons with the comment that he had done it for those who were unreasonably prejudiced for and those unreasonably prejudiced against Tillotson. Readers would be able to judge impartially &#145;that the Archbishop was as far from being the <i>worst</i>, as from being the <i>best</i> of the English writers&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Christian Library</span>, 2nd edn, ed. T. Jackson, 30 vols., 1819&#150;27, 27.3).<br>
<br>Tillotson as rationalist and moralist had his eighteenth-century supporters and detractors, and so did Tillotson the Socinian sympathizer. Locke lamented to Limborch after Tillotson's death that there was now scarcely anyone whom he could consult freely about theological uncertainties  (11 Dec 1694; <span class="italic">Correspondence of John Locke</span>, 5.238). The Huguenot Jean Le Clerc published a lengthy adulatory account in volume 7, article 8, of his <span class="italic">Biblioth&egrave;que choisie</span> (1705), with a long analysis of the hell torments sermon, and a general defence of Tillotson against the charge of Socinianism that was to be much quoted: &#145;accusation qu'on n'a presque jamais manqu&eacute; de faire contre ceux qui ont mieux raisonn&eacute;, que le Vulgaire, &amp; qui ont pr&eacute;fer&eacute; les expressions de l'Ecriture Sainte au langage des Scholastiques&#146;  (p. 290): &#145;an accusation almost always made against those who have used their reason better than the vulgar, and who have preferred the expressions of Holy Scripture to the language of the scholastics&#146;. In the later eighteenth century a prominent unitarian came forward to claim Tillotson as a forebear. In <span class="italic">Vindiciae Priestleianae</span> (1788), a defence of Joseph Priestley against the high-churchman George Horne, the Anglican turned unitarian Theophilus Lindsey provided a particular reading of the latitudinarian tradition of Whichcote, Tillotson, and Burnet through Locke, Samuel Clarke, and Benjamin Hoadly to Francis Blackburne, Edmund Law, and William Paley, which saw it as leading inevitably to unitarianism. On the evidence partly of Tillotson's funeral sermon for Whichcote, Lindsey singled out Tillotson as a theologian like Priestley who believed that Christianity was a perpetual enquiry after truth and that the creed of a Christian could not be fixed.<br>
<br>The modern reader who goes through Tillotson's works sympathetically in the light of the contemporary controversies in which he was engaged&#151;about the function of reason in religion, the relation between faith and works, the comprehension and/or toleration of nonconformists, the reform of the liturgy, the role of Jesus as sacrifice and example&#151;becomes aware that he was performing with considerable success a delicate balancing act. That this balance worked for most eighteenth-century Anglicans (and for some dissenters) is clear from Tillotson's stature as measured by the editions of his works and his literary and educational roles. To others who did not appreciate it Tillotson provided an example, depending on the interpreter's point of view, of the rationalist who did not dare to see where his rationalism led, or the moralist who had contributed to the undoing of Reformation protestantism.<br>
