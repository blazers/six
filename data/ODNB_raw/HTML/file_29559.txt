<span class="headword">Williams,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Caledfryn]</span>  (1801&#150;1869), <span class="occ">Congregational minister and poet</span>, was born on 6 February 1801 at Brynyffynnon, Denbigh, Denbighshire, the second of the seven children of Thomas Williams (1769&#150;1844), weaver and shopkeeper, and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1832), the daughter of William Roberts, farmer, of Llanefydd in the same county. His parents were fairly prosperous and he received a good primary education at local schools, being able to read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Welsh and English by the time he was seven, but in 1814 they were obliged to sell their shop and moved to Henllan Street, where Thomas Williams continued to work as a weaver. The failure of his parents' business meant that the boy had to forgo a secondary education and take up the weaver's trade. For the next eight years, during which he learned the craft of writing Welsh poetry in the strict metres and read widely, he was employed at various mills in the Denbigh area. He adopted the bardic name Caledfryn in 1821 in honour of his native town, which he claimed had formerly been known as Caledfryn-yn-rhos. In 1822 he became a teacher at a school maintained by the Calvinistic Methodists in Denbigh, and in the same year his booklet, <span class="italic">Cyfarwyddiadau i ddarllen ac ysgrifennu Cymraeg</span>, a guide to the reading and writing of Welsh, was published. His first book of verse, <span class="italic">Grawn awen</span>, appeared in 1826.<br>
<br>Shortly afterwards Caledfryn left the Presbyterian Church of Wales, where he made enemies for participating in the Cymreigyddion Society. He joined the Independent chapel in Swan Lane in his native town, where he began preaching. After a few months at Rotherham College in Yorkshire in 1827 he took charge of the Welsh Independent chapel in Gartside Street, Manchester, but stayed less than a year. He was ordained minister of Llannerch-y-medd and Maenaddwyn, Anglesey, in 1829 and served at Peniel, the Independent chapel there, for three years. He was an eloquent preacher and an inspiring teacher of poets, but he began to earn a reputation as a hard, stubborn man with an acerbic tongue who always insisted on having his own way, a consequence perhaps of his having had to earn a living from an early age.<br>
<br>In January 1832 Caledfryn took up the pastorate of Pendref Chapel in Caernarfon, one of the most prestigious Congregational chapels in north Wales, and on 8 September of that year he married Margaret Griffith (1796&#150;1855), with whom he had two children. He remained at Caernarfon until 1848, and it was there that he did his finest work, despite schism within his own congregation and the hostility of Calvinistic Methodists and local tories who were often offended by his outspokenly radical views. He was a scathing opponent of the established church and achieved notoriety because he preferred temperance to total abstinence. A Liberal in politics, he was prominent in the Anti-Corn Law League, the Peace Society, and the Society for the Liberation of Religion from State Patronage and Control. He opposed Sir James Graham's <span class="roman">Factory Bill</span> in 1843 and gave evidence on behalf of nonconformists to the Anglican Commissioners whose report was published in 1847.<br>
<br>But it was as a poet, critic, and editor that Caledfryn won a national reputation. He first came to prominence in 1832 after winning the chair competition and a gold medal at the Beaumaris eisteddfod with a long poem on the wreck of the <i>Rothsay Castle</i> off the coast of Anglesey in the previous year. At the Rhuddlan eisteddfod of 1850 his ode on the resurrection was placed second to a poem written in the free metres&#151;an adjudication which provoked a long and bitter controversy in bardic circles. Between 1831 and 1868 he edited several short-lived periodicals from Caernarfon, then a major centre of Welsh publishing, and was much in demand as an adjudicator at local eisteddfodau, despite the ferocity with which he delivered his excoriating judgements.<br>
<br>There followed pastorates at tabernacles in Aldersgate Street, London (1848&#150;50), Llanrwst (1850&#150;56), and Bangor (1856&#150;7)&#151;it was in the latter place that he married again; his first wife had died two years before, and on 8 January 1857 he married Jane Edwards, like his first wife a wealthy widow. They went to Groes-wen, on a hill to the west of Caerphilly in Glamorgan, where he had his final pastorate. He worked tirelessly in all his ministries and he drew many to the Congregationalist cause with his fine preaching and pastoral care; but he made enemies wherever he went, usually as a consequence of his trenchantly expressed views. His second wife died in 1858, and in October 1863 he married Anne Hughes (<i>b</i>. 1803). Caledfryn died on 23 March 1869 at his home in Groes-wen and was buried seven days later in the chapel graveyard there; an imposing memorial in red marble with a bronze bas-relief and inscribed with his bardic name was erected by public subscription. He was survived by his third wife.<br>
<br>Among Caledfryn's numerous writings the most important are <span class="italic">Drych barddonol neu draethawd ar farddoniaeth</span> (1837), a work on Welsh prosody; <span class="italic">Gramadeg Gymreig</span> (1851), a Welsh grammar; and <span class="italic">Caniadau Caledfryn</span> (1856); he also published a collection of hymns (1861) and edited the works of two minor poets. His autobiography, <span class="italic">Cofiant Caledfryn</span>, which contains a selection of his unpublished verse, was edited by Thomas Roberts (Scorpion) and published in 1877. His verse, which is no longer read except by students of the period, is characterized by its objectivity and a flawless accuracy of form rather than by originality. As a critic he was much more influential: against the trend of his day, he argued for greater simplicity in the writing of Welsh verse in the traditional metres and his grammars served as textbooks long after his death.<br>
