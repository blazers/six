<span class="headword">Ayerst,  William</span>  (1830&#150;1904), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and missionary</span>, was born on 16 March 1830 at Danzig. His father, <a name="cosubject_57865"></a><span class="headword">William Ayerst</span>  (1802&#150;1883), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and missionary</span>, attended St John's College, Cambridge, and became a fervent evangelical under the influence of Charles Simeon, who encouraged him to devote himself especially to the conversion of the Jews. He worked with the Revd R. S. Alexander in Danzig, Breslau, and Berlin between 1827 and 1837. In Berlin the mission became something of a focus for court interest; however, C. J. Blomfield's intervention brought the mission to an end. Ayerst then served in London as foreign secretary to the Jews' Society from 1841 to 1853, and from 1853 to his death was vicar of Egerton, Kent. His son was educated at King's College School, London (1847&#150;9), and in 1849 became scholar and Lyon exhibitioner of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating BA with a third class in the classical tripos and junior optime in 1853, and MA in 1856. Ordained deacon in 1853 and priest in 1854, he served the curacies successively of All Saints', Gordon Square (1853&#150;5), St Paul's, Lisson Grove (1855&#150;7), and St Giles-in-the-Fields (1857&#150;9). While working as a curate he won the Hulsean prize at Cambridge in 1855 and the Norrisian prize in 1858. He also published <span class="italic">The Influence of Christianity on the Language of Modern Europe</span> (1856) and <span class="italic">The Pentateuch, its Own Witness</span> (1858).<br>
<br>On 28 September 1859 Ayerst married Helen Sarah Hough Drawbridge; they had ten children, of whom three sons and a daughter survived him. In the same year he went to India as rector of St Paul's School, Calcutta. In 1861 he was appointed to a chaplaincy on the Bengal ecclesiastical establishment; he served as senior chaplain with the Khyber field force from 1879 to 1881, and received the Afghan medal. After returning to London he was appointed by the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews as principal of its missionary college and minister of the Jews' Episcopal Chapel, Cambridge Heath. In 1882, however, he accepted the vicarage of Hungarton with Twyford and Thorpe Satchville, Leicestershire. In 1884 he opened at Cambridge, Ayerst Hostel, designed to aid men of modest means in obtaining a university degree and theological training. He resigned his living in 1886, but served as curate of Newton, Cambridgeshire, from 1888 to 1890, and continued his work at Ayerst Hostel until 1897. He was a well-known evangelical in the Cambridge tradition.<br>
<br>In 1885 members of the Church of England in Natal who had stood by Bishop J. W. Colenso after his deposition from the see of Natal formally applied to the English archbishops through the church council of Natal for the consecration of a successor to Colenso. The request was refused. After some delay Ayerst accepted the offer of the bishopric, and again attempts were made to obtain consecration. This, in spite of Ayerst's persistency, was definitely refused by Archbishop E. W. Benson on 21 October 1891. In 1893 Ayerst married Annie Young Davidson. He passed his last years living quietly in London, and died on 6 April 1904 at his home, 146 Sinclair Road, Kensington, London.<br>
<br>Ayerst's first son by his first marriage, also <a name="cosubject_57866"></a><span class="headword">William Ayerst</span>  (1860&#150;1934), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born in Calcutta and educated at Tonbridge School and Ayerst Hostel, Cambridge. He joined the army in England, and in 1885 returned to India, serving on the Burma commission in 1886&#150;91. He retired as lieutenant-colonel in 1910. Like his father and grandfather he was an energetic evangelical, being especially notable for his work in promoting the introduction of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> in Braille to India and Burma. His work subsequently developed into the Braille Missionary Union.<br>
