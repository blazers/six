<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Jeger <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Chivers]</span>,  Lena May</span>, Baroness Jeger  (1915&#150;2007), <span class="occ">politician and journalist</span>, was born on 19 November 1915 at 14B Northbrook Road, Wood Green, Middlesex, the daughter of Charles Chivers, a sorter for the Post Office, and his wife, (Eugenie) Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> James (<i>d</i>. 1965). She attended Southgate county school in Middlesex and went on to study English and French at Birkbeck College, London, during which period she became vice-president of the National Union of Students. She joined the civil service on graduation and her first job in 1936 was at a relatively junior level in the customs and excise department. She then moved to the Ministry of Information and later joined the Foreign Office, where her linguistic skills were recognized and she learned Russian. At the end of the Second World War she became the deputy editor of the newspaper <span class="italic">British Ally</span>, which was produced for propaganda purposes for circulation in the Soviet Union, and she spent some months in the British embassy in Moscow.<br>
<br>In 1945 Lena Chivers was elected as a Labour councillor for St Pancras in London and she served in this capacity until 1959, chairing the borough housing committee. Between 1952 and 1955 she was also an elected Labour member of London county council. Her political work brought her into contact with the popular local MP for St Pancras South East, elected in the 1945 general election, Santo Wayburn Jeger (1898&#150;1953). He was a Jewish medical practitioner, a founder of the Socialist Medical Association, a staunch advocate of the new National Health Service, and a well-respected and experienced figure in the Labour Party in London. They were married at St Marylebone register office on 19 March 1948; there were no children. A year later Lena Jeger left the civil service, and from 1951 to 1954 she worked as a journalist on the London staff of the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. She retained her links to <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> (as it was renamed in 1959) for the rest of her life, working for it as a columnist during the period when she was out of parliament, and writing articles for it thereafter when she was a member of the House of Commons and subsequently of the House of Lords. Some of these pieces were portraits of her political colleagues, others were political obituaries.<br>
<br>Santo Jeger died unexpectedly in 1953 and Lena Jeger was selected as the Labour candidate for the consequent by-election in the marginal constituency of Holborn and St Pancras South (as it had been renamed in 1950). It was widely expected that the seat would be taken by the Conservative candidate but Jeger fought a good campaign, local sentiment in her favour was strong, and she retained the seat for Labour, increasing the majority to 1976 votes. One of her stories from this campaign was often repeated as an example of the problems to be met in canvassing: when Jeger was trying to persuade a constituent from Camden Town who lived at the top of a block of flats of the dangers of German re-armament the woman replied, &#145;If you can't stop them pissing in our lift, how can you expect me to believe you can stop the Germans re-arming?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Camden New Journal</span>, 8 March 2007).<br>
<br>In the 1955 general election Jeger's majority fell to only 931 votes and in 1959 she lost to the Conservative candidate by 656 votes. Yet her deep identification with the constituency and her local popularity helped her to win back the seat in the general election of 1964 and retain it in four subsequent elections (in 1974 it changed to Camden, Holborn and St Pancras South). She was universally admired for her political courage and honesty and widely liked for her personal warmth and humour. In 1960&#150;61 and from 1968 to 1980 she was a member of the Labour Party's national executive committee, then a more influential body than it subsequently became.<br>
<br>Jeger was generally perceived as a left-wing Labour MP, a so-called Bevanite in the 1950s. She was personally close to Aneurin Bevan and his wife, Jennie Lee, was a friend of Barbara Castle, and was a devoted neighbour of the socialist thinker and historian R. H. Tawney during his latter years before his death in 1962. She was against British development and possession of nuclear weapons, criticized the Vietnam War, disagreed with restrictions on immigration, and opposed the attempt by Labour governments in the 1960s and 1970s to control the economy by prices and incomes policies and legislation. She was against continued British membership of the EEC in the 1975 referendum on that issue. She also opposed cigarette smoking, and wrote a section of <span class="italic">Common Sense about Smoking</span> in 1963, republished in 1965 as a <span class="roman">Penguin Special</span>.<br>
<br>Jeger was a prominent supporter of the reforming legislation of the 1960s that ended capital punishment and legalized homosexuality. A passionate campaigner for the legalization of abortion, she was a sponsor of the <span class="roman">Abortion Law Reform Act</span> of 1967. In 1951 she had edited a pamphlet for the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and her Child entitled <span class="italic">Illegitimate Children and their Parents</span>, which summarized the relevant law and the social support available for one-parent families. On the issue of women's rights she played a role in securing the <span class="roman">Equal Pay Act</span> of 1970. She also campaigned successfully against rules that reduced widows' pensions if they worked. She long favoured the separate taxation of married women, a reform eventually introduced by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative administration. Her constituency included a substantial community of Greek Cypriots and she was persuaded by their arguments in favour of self-determination for Cyprus, and for the exclusion of Turkish influence in Cypriot affairs. She became a notable exponent of their cause whose advocacy shaped Labour Party policy on the future of the island.<br>
<br>As a committed campaigner drawn to some unfashionable and controversial causes Jeger was not considered ministerial material by either of the Labour prime ministers of the 1960s and 1970s, Harold Wilson and James Callaghan. She made her mark in other and sometimes unglamorous ways, not least as the admired chairman in 1969&#150;70 of the government's working party on sewage disposal, which made a good case for increased investment in, and better management of, the disposal of sewage and the improvement of water quality.<br>
<br>In 1979 Jeger stood down as MP for Camden, Holborn and St Pancras South, which she had made a safe seat for Labour, passing it on to Frank Dobson. She was made a life peer by James Callaghan in his resignation honours in that year. With Labour divided over ideology and personalities after the 1979 election defeat Jeger, as chairman of the Labour Party in 1979&#150;80, had the almost impossible task of chairing the party's annual conference in Blackpool in 1980, where she tried valiantly to prevent the sessions descending into personal attacks and procedural confusion. She was remembered for a characteristic peroration to her opening speech there: &#145;We have to take the poetry of our ideals and translate it into the prose and policies of everyday life.&#146;<br>
<br>In the House of Lords Jeger, with a front-bench brief as opposition spokesman on health (1983&#150;6) and also on social security (1983&#150;90), proved an able and fluent defender of the collectivist values she had always believed in. She retired to the back benches of the Lords in 1990. She continued to attend and participate in Lords' debates in the last years of her life, never wavering in her long-held convictions. She died on 26 February 2007 at Ashton House nursing home, Bolnore Road, Haywards Heath, West Sussex, of breast cancer and multi-systems failure. Speaking in the month after her death at a graduation ceremony at Birkbeck College, the historian Eric Hobsbawm paid tribute to her life and social contribution: &#145;She didn't make millions or have a glittering ministerial career. But she served her cause and the people of London as well as she could. It was a good life, lived by a good person&#146;  (Hobsbawm, &#145;She served her cause&#146;).<br>
