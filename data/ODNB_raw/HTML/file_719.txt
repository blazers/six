<span class="headword">Arundell,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1400&#150;1477), <span class="occ">physician and bishop of Chichester</span>, was a Cornishman, almost certainly of the Lanherne branch of the family, whose arms he bore. The likelihood is that he was the son of Sir John Arundell (<i>d</i>. 1433), landowner, and his wife, Annora, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lambourn. In 1420 he became a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, and by 1424 was principal of a hall, probably Great Black Hall. His accounts, kept on blank spaces in his logic lecture notes, provide some of the earliest evidence for the organization of residence and teaching at the university. He acted as junior proctor in 1426&#150;7, acquired property in Oxford the following year, and perhaps remained at the college to study in the faculty of medicine. At the end of the decade he acquired the patronage of Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (whose Cornish estates neighboured Lanherne), and left his Oxford fellowship for a life of secular service. Between 1430 and 1440 Arundell received a succession of Beauchamp livings, and is recorded as physician to Henry, earl of Warwick, in the latter year, though he had probably served the family in that capacity since leaving Oxford.<br>
<br>Beauchamp service brought Arundell inevitably into contact with the royal household&#151;Earl Richard was the king's guardian, and Henry Beauchamp and the young king grew up as brothers. Arundell was first paid as the king's physician in 1442/3, and royal service can probably be detected in his preferment to a number of prebendal stalls, and is plain from his appointment in 1449 as a canon of St George's Chapel, Windsor (where he seems to have resided), and of St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, in 1452. When Henry VI's mental health collapsed in the summer of 1453, Arundell led the team of doctors and surgeons appointed by the council to minister to him. He was last paid for medical service to the king in 1456. On 25 February 1457, when he was described as a king's chaplain, Arundell was appointed master of Bethlem Hospital. In June 1457, with Laurence Booth, the keeper of the privy seal, he was commissioned to negotiate a truce with Scotland.<br>
<br>In August 1457 the king commended Arundell to the pope for the vacant see of Durham, but Booth, the queen's chancellor and doubtless her candidate, was provided. Arundell was consoled with offices vacated by Booth's elevation&#151;the archdeaconry of Richmond and a richer York prebend. When his own promotion to the episcopacy came, it was far more modest. Arundell was nominated to Chichester in 1458, and received custody of the temporalities on 27 October 1458. He obtained papal provision on 8 January 1459, received full restoration of the temporalities on 26 March, and was consecrated on 3 June 1459.<br>
<br>Arundell seems to have been an active bishop, and was certainly resident. In 1460 he asserted his exclusive jurisdiction over the former royal free chapel of Hastings, and in 1466 was at odds with the dean of St George's Chapel, Windsor, over the advowson of Climping. In 1459 William Waynflete, bishop of Winchester, whose brother John was the dean of Chichester, acquired the patronage of Sele Priory near Bramber, and obtained authority from both the pope and Arundell to appropriate it to his foundation of St Mary Magdalen, Oxford. Arundell visited Sele in 1463 and seems to have forced the resignation of the corrupt prior, but was allegedly partisan in the appointment of his successor. The new prior was equally scandalous, provoking a petition for redress from Waynflete, which Arundell allegedly ignored. Finally, in 1474, the pope appointed the official of Rochester and the dean and chapter of Chichester to investigate Waynflete's articles against Arundell, suspending the bull of Boniface VIII against the interference of one bishop in another's jurisdiction on account of Arundell's reported partiality.<br>
<br>Arundell retained Lancastrian sympathies, and seems to have been implicated in Fauconberg's rising of May 1471. In Easter term of that year he made a gift of 400 marks to the king, which can perhaps be interpreted as a fine for failing to arrest the Bastard's flight through his diocese. In that same year he endowed a chantry at the choir door of the cathedral, and established the nightly singing of the antiphon <span class="italic">Nunc Christe</span>; the adjoining <i>pulpitum</i>, known as the &#145;Arundell screen&#146;, was in fact built by Walter Walton under Bishop Robert Reade. Despite having been excused attendance at councils and parliaments in 1464, on account of age and infirmity, he remained active as a diocesan, conducting a visitation at the remotest part of his diocese at Winchelsea in July 1476. He died on 18 October 1477, and was buried in his cathedral; his tomb, which carries the indent of a brass, survives. One of the books he owned, <span class="italic">Liber de ludo scacchorum</span>, a treatise on chess by Jacobus de Cessolis, is now at Magdalen College, Oxford  (MS Lat. 12), and several medical prescriptions survive. Arundell was clearly capable of inspiring affection for some years after his death. In 1485 John Wood of Midhurst left the profits of a manor and the advowson of Pulborough to endow masses for the soul of his former master, next to whose tomb he requested burial.<br>
