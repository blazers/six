<span class="headword">Dumont,  Pierre-&Eacute;tienne-Louis <span class="st"> [&Eacute;tienne]</span></span>  (1759&#150;1829), <span class="occ">editor and promoter of the work of Jeremy Bentham</span>, was born in Geneva on 18 July 1759, the youngest of six children of Abraham David Dumont (<i>d</i>. 1762), jeweller, and his wife, Louise-Esther Illens. He was educated at the Genevan Academy and ordained to the pastorate of the Genevan Reformed church on 2 December 1783. He acquired an early reputation for eloquence, but his first sermon on 28 March 1784 contained political references to which the Genevan government took exception. After receiving a stern rebuke from the authorities Dumont moved to St Petersburg and in July 1784 took up the post of pastor of the francophone Reformed community there.<br>
<br>In January 1786 Dumont arrived in England to take up a position in the household of the former prime minister William Petty, now first marquess of Lansdowne; his position was analogous to the one held earlier by Joseph Priestley, who had discovered oxygen while at Lansdowne's country house, Bowood, in Wiltshire. Dumont acted as mentor and travelling companion to Lansdowne's son Lord Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, and supervised the development of the marquess's fine library. Lansdowne was a Maecenas who enjoyed the company of unconventional intellectuals, including the dissenting cleric and philosopher Richard Price, the legal reformer and politician Samuel Romilly, and the philosopher, jurist, and reformer Jeremy Bentham. Dumont's involvement with Lansdowne thus brought him to the heart of an influential gathering of the whig intellectual &eacute;lite. These habitu&eacute;s of the Bowood circle (as Lansdowne's intellectual associates were known) were very conscious of the failings of the British parliamentary system, but Dumont remained a lifelong enthusiast for the British constitution, something that later led him to modify the more politically radical sentiments he found in Bentham's manuscripts. Although Bentham was close to Lansdowne at this point, he and Dumont did not meet until 1788; for just as Dumont was on his way to England from Russia, Bentham himself was travelling to Russia to stay with his brother Samuel, who was in the employ of the Russian government.<br>
<br>Through his close and lifelong friendship with Samuel Romilly, whose sister had married one of Dumont's Genevan friends, Dumont became an adviser to the French <i>parlementaire</i> Honor&eacute;-Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau. In the first year of the revolution Dumont was one of a small circle of Genevans who not only acted as a sounding-board for Mirabeau's ideas but also provided him with suggestions, wrote speeches for him, and edited his journal <span class="italic">Courier de Provence</span>. Dumont was responsible for writing the national assembly's address to the king, which called for the removal of troops who had gathered in July 1789, and also for the preamble to the declaration of rights. It was while in Paris in 1789 that Dumont began to translate into French material written by Jeremy Bentham: this comprised extracts from Bentham's proposals for the reorganization of the French judicial system, and was published in the <span class="italic">Courier de Provence</span> in the spring of 1790 (after Dumont had returned to England). In the following year Dumont sent a French abstract of Bentham's celebrated panopticon proposal to Paris in the hope that it might influence government reforms of the French prison system.<br>
<br>Dumont soon grew disillusioned with the revolution, which he experienced at first hand in Paris and later in Geneva. He wrote an account of these experiences in 1799 but it was not published until after his death, as <span class="italic">Souvenirs sur Mirabeau et sur les deux premi&egrave;res assembl&eacute;es l&eacute;gislatives</span> (English translation, <span class="italic">Recollections of Mirabeau</span>, both 1832). This offers a much more sombre assessment of the revolution than that in <span class="italic">Letters containing an account of the late revolution in France, and observations on the constitution, laws, manners, and institutions of the English</span>, which Dumont wrote with Romilly and James Scarlett, first Baron Abinger, and was published in 1792. The <span class="italic">Souvenirs</span> created a furore in France at a time when Mirabeau had attained a heroic status, for Dumont's portrait of him, though affectionate and often respectful, was not without astringency.<br>
<br>In March 1790 Dumont left Paris for England where he remained&#151;apart from occasional absences in Paris and Geneva, during one of which he served briefly as a member of the Genevan government&#151;until 1815, when he returned permanently to his native city. During this twenty-five-year period in England Dumont became a familiar figure in &eacute;lite whig circles and a frequent visitor to Holland House, Kensington, home of Henry Richard Fox, third Baron Holland; here Dumont met the essayist and wit Sydney Smith and the poets Samuel Rogers and Henry Luttrell. The respect in which Dumont was held is evident from his induction into the Club of Clubs, founded in 1798 by Sydney Smith's brother Bobus (Robert) and the jurist and historian Sir James Mackintosh. Through this assembly Dumont became acquainted with the diarist Thomas Creevey; Henry Brougham, the future lord chancellor; William Lamb, the future prime minister; Francis Jeffrey, editor of the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>; and the political economist Thomas Malthus. In the opening years of the nineteenth century Dumont also began a correspondence with Richard Lovell Edgeworth and his daughter, Maria, who regularly consulted him for help with the composition of her novels. About this time he also moved out of Lansdowne House (William Petty's London residence) into rooms at 19 Haymarket, London, where he lived until his departure for Geneva in 1815. Among those who later visited Dumont was the economist David Ricardo. For the final fourteen years of his life Dumont played a leading role in the new Genevan assembly, notably in his skilful drafting of its rules of debate, which effectively resulted in a shift of power from the aristocratic council of state to the assembly.<br>
<br>During his residence in England Dumont gained an international reputation for what he described as his &#145;<i>extraits</i> or abstracts&#146; of Jeremy Bentham's publications. The first and most celebrated was the <span class="italic">Trait&eacute;s de l&eacute;gislation civile et p&eacute;nale</span>, published in Paris in three volumes in 1802 and translated into the major continental European languages soon after. Bentham was a prolix writer but he was not very good at rounding off his books for publication, with a tendency to abandon fields of study before completing the text in order to embark on new ones. Dumont's well-written abstracts provided summary accounts of Bentham's thinking in readily marketable form. In 1811 he published <span class="italic">Th&eacute;orie des peines et des r&eacute;compenses</span> in two volumes&#151;translated separately into English as <span class="italic">The Rationale of Reward</span> (1825) and <span class="italic">The Rationale of Punishment</span> (1830)&#151;followed in 1816 by <span class="italic">Tactique des assembl&eacute;es l&eacute;gislatives</span> (2 vols.), which bore evident marks of the author's experiences in the national assembly in Paris in 1789. The two-volume <span class="italic">Trait&eacute; des preuves judiciaires</span> (1822; English translation, <span class="italic">A Treatise of Judicial Evidence</span>, 1825) was followed in 1828 with <span class="italic">De l'organisation judiciaire et de la codification</span>. By this date further editions of Dumont's earlier abstracts had appeared. In turn Dumont's influence reached a British audience when most of his works, translated into English and revised with more or less reference to original Bentham manuscripts, appeared in the Bowring edition of Bentham's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1838&#150;43).<br>
<br>More important than their use for Bowring's edition, Dumont's versions of Bentham became firmly entrenched through the translation, by the American writer Richard Hildreth, of two volumes of the 1820 edition of the <span class="italic">Trait&eacute;s de l&eacute;gislation civile et p&eacute;nale</span> as <span class="italic">The Theory of Legislation</span> (1840). This was first published in the United States and only became available in Britain in 1864, but it subsequently ran through many editions and the Hildreth text remains in print in the early twenty-first century. This book became the staple university textbook through which generations of English-speaking students were introduced to Bentham's thought. Only with the publication of scholarly editions of Bentham's manuscripts in the new Oxford edition of Bentham's <span class="italic">Works</span> (1968&#150;) has it become possible to see Bentham separately from Dumont, though on occasions (for example, <span class="italic">Political Tactics</span>) even this edition is to a degree reliant on Dumont.<br>
<br>In general Dumont's versions are reasonably faithful renderings of Bentham's ideas, though in his desire to produce a polished and elegant text of wide appeal he tended to oversimplify the complexities of the original. However, Dumont was not above contradicting the master, especially when Bentham was more critical of the British constitution than Dumont thought appropriate. Bentham, for example, had no time for bicameralism whereas Dumont was convinced of the need for a second chamber. Bentham also satirized aspects of the British judicial system, but Dumont&#151;prone to contrast British practices favourably with those in France, a country of which he remained considerably suspicious&#151;tended to eliminate such material from his versions. The principal drawback of Dumont's presentation of Bentham was that it ultimately created a very limited view of Bentham's aspirations and interests in an intellectual life that may be divided into three main phases. Until the late 1780s Bentham focused on the creation of a new legal system by deduction from his fundamental utilitarian premise. In the second phase, to the early nineteenth century, he engaged in a concerted effort to implement his ideas for social and economic reform, particularly in his negotiations with the British government to build and operate a model panopticon penal establishment. In the third phase, lasting until his death, he became a kind of legal consultant to foreign statesmen&#151;an activity made possible by the global reputation that the dissemination of Dumont's works created for him. However, Dumont's abstracts publicized almost exclusively the achievements of the first phase of Bentham's career, and the sheer breadth of Bentham's interests and aspirations as expressed over the whole of his long and active life was as a result forgotten by later generations.<br>
<br>Dumont was regarded with affection by Bentham, who seems generally to have approved of his work, though he was capable of expressions of exasperation regarding the Genevan's limitations&#151;even to the point of claiming on one occasion that Dumont did not understand a word of his argument. Some of this exasperation may be due to the fact that, while Bentham's interests developed and widened, Dumont continued to present a picture of the young Bentham. In particular nobody would have known from Dumont's publications that, over the last thirty years of his life, Bentham abandoned his political conservatism and became increasingly radical. Dumont was criticized by his friends for turning himself into the disciple of an ideologue of whom many of them had a poor opinion. In contrast the Genevan believed that Bentham had discovered the true science of morality and law, and saw himself as the propagator of this new science rather than as a slavish acolyte. The suggestion by Bentham's later disciple Sir John Bowring that the two men eventually became estranged seems to be wide of the mark, since it is known that they dined together just over a year before Dumont's death.<br>
<br>&Eacute;tienne Dumont died in Milan on 29 September 1829, while on a visit to Italy. He was buried in the Plainpalais cemetery, Geneva, where his simple grave is located next to that of his friend the Genevan statesman Charles Pictet de Rochemont.<br>
