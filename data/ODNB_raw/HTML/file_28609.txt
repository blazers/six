<span class="headword">Walsh,  John</span>  (1726&#150;1795), <span class="occ">natural philosopher and politician</span>, was born on 21 May 1726 in Madras, the second son of the three children of Joseph Walsh (<i>d</i>. 1731), senior merchant in the East India Company, and his wife, Elizabeth (1697&#150;1734), daughter of Nevil Maskelyne (1663&#150;1711) of Purton, Wiltshire. Nevil Maskelyne (1732&#150;1811), astronomer royal from 1765, and his sister, Margaret, wife of Robert, first Baron Clive (1725&#150;1774), were his first cousins. Walsh's father conducted his mercantile business in partnership with his brother John Walsh of Hatton Garden, London, and, finding himself in financial difficulties in 1728, he went to London to seek his brother's help, accompanied by his elder son, Joseph (<i>b</i>. 1722), who died of smallpox there. He returned alone to India in 1729, where he died in 1731.<br>
<br>Walsh was sent to England immediately after his father's death, and was raised by his uncle John. His mother went into a decline and died in 1734. In 1742 Walsh joined the East India Company as a writer, and was sent to Madras. He was in England in 1747&#150;9, and rose to the grade of senior merchant; in 1757 he was appointed secretary to Clive, and two years later he returned to England as his agent. He corresponded regularly with Clive and, after the latter's death in 1774, with his widow, Walsh's cousin. Clive's daughter Charlotte became his ward.<br>
<br>Walsh's mission in 1759 was to report Clive's military successes to the East India Company directors, and to give Prime Minister Pitt a copy of Clive's plan to reorganize the administration of Bengal. By now Walsh was a wealthy man, thanks to the booty distributed when Siraj-ud-Dawla, governor of Bengal, surrendered to Clive at Plassey. He settled in England and in 1761 purchased the manor of Hockenhull, Cheshire, which in 1771 he exchanged for Warfield Park, Bracknell, Berkshire. When his sister, Elizabeth Fowkes, was widowed and left penniless, he accommodated and educated her three children. Clive supported Walsh's election to the House of Commons to represent Worcester in 1761, claiming that he would energetically represent the whig interest. Walsh did speak occasionally on matters connected with the East India Company, but otherwise showed an independent spirit. In fact he had little taste for politics, preferring science: he was not a candidate in the elections of 1780 and 1790, and was defeated when he stood in 1784 and in the by-election of 1791.<br>
<br>Elected to the Royal Society in 1770, Walsh soon became absorbed in the subject for which he became briefly famous: the electric fish. The numbing shocks felt by anyone who touched the electric ray, <i>Torpedo marmorata</i>, which inhabited the Mediterranean and other shores of Europe, had been known since classical times. In 1769 Edward Banfield reported on the more powerful electric eel, <i>Gymnotus</i> (now <i>Silurus</i>) <i>electricus</i>, from tropical South America. Banfield proved that the eel emitted electric shocks, and Walsh set out to confirm that the ray had a similar power. In this he was encouraged by Benjamin Franklin, whose American colleagues were undertaking similar investigations. With his nephew Arthur Fowkes he spent the summer of 1772 at La Rochelle, where the ray was often captured. The fish could survive many hours out of water, and Walsh was able to conduct experiments ashore. He wired up the fish to a series of bowls of water, which were interlinked by people with a hand in each adjacent bowl. A shock was felt by all when the wire was led back to the fish and the circuit completed, proving that the ray's shocks were caused by electricity and could be transmitted through conducting substances. His letter to Franklin announcing these findings was published in the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>  (63, 1773, 461&#150;77). The surgeon John Hunter dissected the ray and identified the organs concerned; the question of how recharge occurred remained for later scientists to discover.<br>
<br>The Royal Society awarded Walsh the Copley medal for his achievement, though some physicists still challenged his findings, as the ray's charge did not show the attraction and repulsion or sparks that they associated with electricity generated by the Leyden jar. Walsh and Hunter continued their experiments on the gymnotus, and Walsh endeavoured to obtain information on electric rays in Indian seas, though this work was not published; in later years Cavendish, Humboldt, and Faraday continued to investigate this animal electricity. Walsh died on 9 March 1795 at his town residence in Chesterfield Street, London. He was unmarried, and left his property to Sir John Benn, who in 1778 had married his niece Margaret. In accordance with the provisions of the will, Benn assumed the additional name of Walsh, and was the father of John Benn Walsh, first Baron Ormathwaite (1798&#150;1881).<br>
