<span class="headword">Heywood,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1573&#150;1641), <span class="occ">playwright and poet</span>, was probably born late in 1573 in Lincolnshire. On 3 October 1623 he gave his age as &#145;49 or thereabouts&#146; and as &#145;50 yeares, or neare upon&#146;  (Sisson, 58), and on five separate occasions in his writings he refers to himself as a native of Lincolnshire. A. M. Clark presents convincing evidence, much of it unknown to earlier biographers, that the dramatist was the son of Robert Heywood (<i>c</i>.1543&#150;1593), rector of Rothwell and Ashby-cum-Fenby, Lincolnshire, and his wife, Elizabeth. The family came originally from Mottram, Cheshire, but Robert Heywood moved to Lincolnshire after being ordained by the bishop of Chester in 1562; he had been educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Heywood's paternal uncle Edmund Heywood (<i>d</i>. 1624) worked for many years in the office of the exchequer and was granted a coat of arms before 1616.<br>
<br>Thomas Heywood matriculated as a pensioner from Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1591; in 1658 William Cartwright claimed that he had been a fellow of Peterhouse. Heywood later wrote in <span class="italic">An Apology for Actors</span> (1612) that during his time at Cambridge he saw &#145;tragedyes, comedyes, historyes, pastorals and shewes, publickly acted, in which the graduates of good place and standing have bene specially parted&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Apology</span>, 28). However, his education was probably cut short by the death of his father in February 1593, after which he moved to London and plunged into the literary scene there. Thus began a literary career astonishing not only for its length (nearly fifty years), but for the sheer range of Heywood's output, covering nearly all the genres available to him.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Heywood's first published effort was a narrative poem, <span class="italic">Oenone and Paris</span> (1594), drawn from Ovid's <span class="italic">Heroides</span> and to a lesser extent from Lucian. Both classical authors would exert a strong influence on Heywood throughout his career. The poem is also a close imitation of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Venus and Adonis</span> (1593), marking the beginning of Shakespeare's pervasive influence on Heywood's writing. It has been argued that Heywood wrote early versions of several later plays in 1594&#150;5 (particularly <span class="italic">The Rape of Lucrece</span>, based partly on Shakespeare's poem, and <span class="italic">The Four Prentices of London</span>), and it may have been about this time that he contributed to <span class="italic">Sir Thomas More</span> (BL, Harley MS 7368), a play whose Hand D is widely accepted as Shakespeare's.<br>
<br>The first concrete evidence of Heywood's playwriting is a payment in Philip Henslowe's <span class="italic">Diary</span> in October 1596 for &#145;hawodes bocke&#146;  (<span class="italic">Henslowe's Diary</span>, 50), by which time he was probably also working as an actor. On 25 March 1598 Heywood signed an agreement to act exclusively for Henslowe over the next two years, and between December 1598 and February 1599 he wrote at least two plays for Henslowe's Admiral's Men: &#145;War without Blows and Love without Suit&#146; and &#145;Joan is as Good as my Lady&#146; (both now lost). In the autumn of 1598 Francis Meres's <span class="italic">Palladis tamia</span> listed Heywood among &#145;the best for Comedy&#146; along with other writers for Admiral's Men.<br>
<br>Heywood's one surviving play from this period&#151;the two-part <span class="italic">King Edward IV</span> (first printed 1599, with five later editions)&#151;was performed not by Henslowe's company, but by the rival Derby's Men. Both parts are distinguished by features which would become characteristic of Heywood's drama: episodic plots, sympathetic treatment of tradesmen and apprentices, strong female characters, and a focus on Christian mercy and forgiveness rather than revenge. Part one depicts King Edward mingling among his loyal subjects in disguise (in the manner of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Henry V</span>), then wooing and winning goldsmith's wife Jane Shore as his mistress. Part two opens with Edward's conquest of France, but is mainly concerned with Jane Shore's fall from grace under Edward's successor Richard III, and the mercy shown by her loyal husband, Matthew, and by Edward's widow, Elizabeth.<br>
<br>By the autumn of 1601 Heywood had become a leading member of the earl of Worcester's company of players, which became Queen Anne's Men in 1603. This company moved among the Boar's Head, Rose, and Curtain theatres before finally finding a permanent home at the Red Bull in 1607. Meanwhile Heywood had married and settled in St Saviour's parish, Southwark. His wife's name is unknown, but <i>contra</i> Clark, he was not the Thomas Heywood who married Anne Buttler, servant, in St Antholin's in 1603. As Thomas &#145;Hayward&#146;, player, he had at least four children baptized at St Saviour's: Mary (5 October 1600), Joseph (5 June 1603), Alice (16 September 1604), and Richard (5 September 1605). He was probably also the father of Frances (4 March 1598) and Edie (23 December 1610). With a stable family life and a steady income as a sharer in the Queen's Men, Heywood entered into the most productive period of his dramatic career. Several of the plays he wrote at Henslowe's Rose in 1602&#150;3 are preserved only as titles &#145;1 Lady Jane&#146;, &#145;Cutting Dick&#146;, &#145;Christmas comes but once a year&#146;, &#145;The Blind Eat many a Fly&#146;, but many more of his plays from this era survive, showing him exploring favourite themes and blossoming as a playwright.<h2>
<a name="SuccessonthestageHeywoodsprimeasaplaywright"></a>Success on the stage: Heywood's prime as a playwright</h2>Heywood achieved his greatest popular success (and ensured his modern reputation) with his domestic dramas. These recall medieval morality plays in their structure, generally contrasting a prodigal spouse with a patient, virtuous one, but they add layers of complexity. The earliest of Heywood's domestic plays, the dark comedy <span class="italic">How a Man may Choose a Good Wife from a Bad</span> (<i>c</i>.1601, printed 1602) tells the story of Arthur, who tries to poison his loyal wife in order to marry a prostitute but unwittingly gives her a sleeping potion instead. While fleeing from the authorities, he meets his wife but does not recognize her, and only when Arthur is about to be executed for his crime does the wife reveal herself and save him. In <span class="italic">The Wise Woman of Hogsdon</span> (written <i>c</i>.1604, published 1638), by contrast, Heywood turns the prodigal husband story into a farce. Reluctant groom Chartley flees on the eve of his wedding to gamble with his dissolute friends, but the wise woman of the title (actually a witch) orchestrates a series of comic plots whereby Chartley contracts marriage with two other women but ends up married to his original bride. Heywood may have had a hand in <span class="italic">The Fair Maid of the Exchange</span> (written <i>c</i>.1602, published 1607), another domestic comedy with a strong heroine, but is probably not its primary author.<br>
<br>The masterpiece among Heywood's domestic plays is the tragedy <span class="italic">A Woman Killed with Kindness</span> (written 1603). The play begins with the marriage of Anne Acton to John Frankford, but here (as in <span class="italic">Edward IV</span>) it is the wife who is prodigal, having an affair with Frankford's best friend, Wendoll. Upon discovering the affair Frankford curbs his impulse for revenge and instead banishes his wife to his country estate with full provisions. Remorseful, Anne starves herself to death, but not before receiving Frankford's forgiveness on her deathbed. In a parallel sub-plot, Anne's brother Sir Francis Acton pays the debts of his disgraced enemy Sir Charles Mountford, whereupon Mountford offers Acton his virtuous sister Susan in marriage. The play was printed in 1607 with Heywood's name on the title-page for the first time, and with a self-deprecating prologue reflecting the modesty which was to be a hallmark of Heywood's writing.<br>
<br>Among Heywood's most interesting plays from this period are a series of adventure-romances, all written in the first decade of the seventeenth century but not published until many years later. The earliest of these, <span class="italic">The Four Prentices of London</span> (written 1599&#150;1600, published 1615) opens with Godfrey of Bulloigne and his three noble brothers living in London as apprentices after their father's dispossession. They set off on a crusade to Jerusalem carrying the arms of their respective trades (a feature later satirized in Francis Beaumont's <span class="italic">Knight of the Burning Pestle</span>), trailed by their disguised sister Bella Franca, and encounter many improbable adventures before their reunion and ultimate victory in Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Fortune by Land and Sea</span> and <span class="italic">The Fair Maid of the West, Part 1</span> (both written either in 1601&#150;2 or in 1609) are more ambitious, being aptly described by Clark as &#145;half adventure play, half domestic tragicomedy&#146;  (Clark, 213). In both plays a middle-class hero (young Forrest and Spencer respectively) kills a powerful adversary in a tavern duel and is forced to flee overseas, and each hero loves an impossibly virtuous heroine (Anne Harding and Bess Bridges) with whom he is reunited after a series of wild adventures. <span class="italic">Fortune</span> centres its twin plots around the feuding Forrest and Harding families, while <span class="italic">The Fair Maid</span> focuses squarely on Bess Bridges, who rises from barmaid to become captain of a warship, exemplifying the kind of heroic woman who fascinated Heywood throughout his career. <span class="italic">Fortune</span> was not printed until 1655 (attributed to Heywood and William Rowley), <span class="italic">The Fair Maid</span> not until 1631, when it appeared along with its much later sequel (written <i>c</i>.1630).<br>
<br>Heywood also continued to integrate domestic situations into plays about royalty, as he had done in <span class="italic">Edward IV</span>. In <span class="italic">The Royal King and the Loyal Subject</span> (written <i>c</i>.1600, printed 1637), he adapts a novella from <span class="italic">Painter's Palace of Pleasure</span> about a king cruelly testing the loyalty of his steward, but changes the setting to England and adds a sub-plot with close parallels to <span class="italic">How a Man may Choose</span> and <span class="italic">Fortune by Land and Sea</span>. Heywood is probably also the author of the manuscript play &#145;Tom a Lincoln&#146; (BL, Add. MS 61745), a romance about the eponymous bastard son of King Arthur and his own two sons. It is based on Richard Johnson's 1607 pamphlet of the same name, but is also influenced by Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Winter's Tale</span> and <span class="italic">The Tempest</span>.<br>
<br>Heywood's favourite monarch, however, was Queen Elizabeth. His two-part drama about Elizabeth, <span class="italic">If you Know not me, you Know Nobody</span> (<i>c</i>.1604&#150;5, first printed 1605&#150;6), is a veritable smorgasbord of his favourite themes. Part one (based closely on John Foxe's <span class="italic">Acts and Monuments</span>) deals with the trials of Elizabeth during the reign of her half-sister, Mary, ending with her triumphant accession to the throne. In part two the focus shifts to Sir Thomas Gresham, who builds the Royal Exchange while his prodigal nephew John cavorts with French prostitutes. Hobson the honest haberdasher teaches everyone the true meaning of charity before, abruptly, Queen Elizabeth is saved from assassination and defeats the Spanish Armada. The results, while less than satisfying dramatically, were extremely popular: part one went through eight printed editions, and part two went through four. All these editions were published anonymously, but Heywood was to recycle the material of part one many times in the coming decades, in works such as the prose <span class="italic">Gunaikeion</span> (1624) and <span class="italic">England's Elizabeth</span> (1631), and the rhymed <span class="italic">Life and Death of Queen Elizabeth</span> (1639).<br>
<br>Heywood's next play, <span class="italic">The Rape of Lucrece</span> (printed 1608), was also very popular, despite being a distinct oddity to modern eyes. It is a Roman revenge tragedy about the bloody rise of Tarquin Superbus and his wife, Tullia, and their fall at the hand of Brutus after Tarquin's son Sextus rapes Collatine's chaste wife, Lucrece. The rape itself closely follows Shakespeare's poem, leading Holaday to date the earliest version of the play to 1594, though 1606&#150;7 is a more generally accepted date. The play contains many lighthearted songs, most sung by the nobleman Valerius, which many critics have found jarring and out of place. Five editions were printed by 1638, the last of these containing five additional songs.<h2>
<a name="Branchingouttranslationsnondramaticpoetryandprose"></a>Branching out: translations, non-dramatic poetry, and prose</h2>Perhaps inspired by the success of <span class="italic">Lucrece</span>, Heywood next made a bid for literary respectability by immersing himself in the classics. In 1608 he published a prose translation (from the French of Lois Meigret Lyonnais) of Sallust's <span class="italic">Conspiracy of Catiline</span> and <span class="italic">War of Jugurtha</span>, with a prefatory epistle translated from Jean Bodin's <span class="italic">Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem</span> and a dedication to Sir Thomas Somerset, the son of the earl of Worcester. Perhaps about this same time, an anonymous edition of Heywood's youthful translation of Ovid's <span class="italic">Ars amatoria</span> appeared, entitled <span class="italic">Love's School</span>. Though Heywood later complained angrily that it had been published without his consent, this translation became extremely popular, going through at least twelve printings in the seventeenth century.<br>
<br>More ambitious than either of these was <span class="italic">Troia Britannica</span> (1609), an original narrative poem of seventeen cantos, dedicated to Heywood's former patron the earl of Worcester. It begins with the Creation and goes through classical mythology and the fall of Troy, ending with a whirlwind history of Britain, from Brute's founding of London (or &#145;New Troy&#146;) to the accession of James I. Heywood drew on various classical and modern sources for this poem, including Chapman's translation of Homer, and also inserted several Ovidian poems and digressions praising music and poetry.<br>
<br>Soon afterwards Heywood set out to dramatize classical mythology in a series of spectacular, pageant-like plays known as <span class="italic">The Ages</span>. <span class="italic">The Golden Age</span> (printed 1611) tells the story of Saturn, Titan, and Jupiter; <span class="italic">The Silver Age</span> (printed 1612) concerns the further adventures of Jupiter and the early labours of Hercules; <span class="italic">The Brazen Age</span> (printed 1613) concerns the later labours of Hercules, and Jason and the golden fleece; and the two-part <span class="italic">The Iron Age</span> (printed 1632) tells the story of the Trojan War, strongly influenced by Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Troilus and Cressida</span>. Large portions of these plays (especially <span class="italic">The Golden Age</span>) are dramatizations of <span class="italic">Troia Britannica</span>, though there is also much new material, which Holaday  (&#145;Ages&#146;) suggests may be recycled from lost plays for Henslowe. <span class="italic">The Ages</span> became quite popular; according to Heywood's preface to <span class="italic">The Iron Age</span>, they were performed by two companies combined (probably the King's and Queen Anne's) and &#145;thronged three severall Theaters&#146;  (<span class="italic">Iron Age</span>, ed. Weiner, 2).<br>
<br>Heywood's first and best-known original prose work, <span class="italic">An Apology for Actors</span> (written <i>c</i>.1608, printed 1612) is a spirited and learned defence of the theatre against its enemies, filled with classical allusions and anecdotes, but also quite valuable for discussing recent stage history. It was published with a dedication to the earl of Worcester and commendatory verses from fellow playwright John Webster, fellow actors Richard Perkins, Christopher Beeston, and Robert Pallant, and John Taylor the Water-Poet. In a famous epistle to the printer, his friend Nicholas Okes, Heywood complains about William Jaggard's sloppy printing of <span class="italic">Troia Britannica</span> and Jaggard's inclusion of two poems from that work in the third edition of Shakespeare's <span class="italic">The Passionate Pilgrim</span> (1612), causing Shakespeare to be &#145;much offended&#146; with Jaggard.<br>
<br>In 1612 Heywood wrote a commendatory poem for his Cambridge contemporary Henry Peacham's <span class="italic">Minerva Britanna</span>, followed by a funeral elegy for Prince Henry (1613), dedicated to Worcester and printed together with elegies by Webster and Cyril Tourneur. A few months later he published <span class="italic">Marriage Triumph</span> (1613), a poem honouring the marriage of Princess Elizabeth and the elector palatine. In 1614 he edited the play <span class="italic">Greenes Tu quoque</span> by John Cooke, praising both the deceased author and the recently deceased star of the play, fellow Queen's Man Thomas Greene. Heywood himself was praised in print by Webster, Thomas Freeman, and Richard Brathwaite between 1612 and 1614, and in 1614 he probably also travelled to Venice and Germany in the entourage of another former Cambridge contemporary, the earl of Southampton, as suggested by Holaday  (&#145;Low Countries&#146;). About this time he also began compiling &#145;The lives of all the poets modern and foreign&#146;, which he worked on intermittently for two decades but unfortunately never published.<br>
<br>After this burst of activity and recognition, however, Heywood drops virtually out of sight for nearly a decade, publishing nothing between 1615 and 1624. This withdrawal from literary life may have resulted from the troubles of his acting company, Queen Anne's Men, which went into a long decline after the death of its leading actor and manager, Thomas Greene, in 1612. Heywood was one of several sharers who received black cloth for Queen Anne's funeral in May 1619, but the company was moribund by then; for the rest of his life Heywood belonged to no single company, though he often wrote for his former fellow actor Christopher Beeston's companies at the Cockpit. By October 1623 Heywood was living in St James's, Clerkenwell, London, where he remained for the rest of his life. His wife was still alive in 1624, when his uncle Edmund's will left a bequest to &#145;Thomas Heywoode and his wife&#146;, but on 18 January 1633, a &#145;Thomas Hayward &amp; Jane Span&#146; were married in St James's, Clerkenwell  (Clark, 102).<h2>
<a name="ReturntoliteratureHistoryofWomenandnewplays"></a>Return to literature: History of Women and new plays</h2>In 1624 Heywood ended his long literary silence with <span class="italic">Gunaikeion, or, Nine Books of Various History Concerning Women</span>. This 466-page folio volume celebrates strong women throughout history, from mythological goddesses to earthly leaders such as Queen Elizabeth and Queen Anne, both of whom Heywood praises highly. In the dedication to his former patron the earl of Worcester, Heywood implies that he has had financial difficulties, and in the Latin colophon he claims that the book was conceived, written, and published within seventeen weeks. Some of the book is recycled from Heywood's earlier writing, but it also draws on a wide variety of other sources, documented by Martin and Clark. In the following year, Heywood published a <span class="italic">Funeral Elegy</span> for King James, also dedicated to Worcester, and in 1628 he wrote a commendatory poem for Matthew Mainwaring's <span class="italic">Vienna</span>.<br>
<br>Heywood was also writing plays again by this time, but not yet publishing them. On 2 September 1624 Sir Henry Herbert licensed &#145;a new Play, called <span class="roman">The Captive, or, The Lost recovered</span>: Written by Hayward&#146;  (Merchant, 19) for performance by Lady Elizabeth's Men at the Cockpit. This play, normally known as &#145;The Captives&#146;, survives only in Heywood's autograph manuscript (BL, Egerton MS 1994, fols. 52&#150;73). The main plot, based on Plautus's <span class="italic">Rudens</span>, involves two Englishwomen imprisoned in a Marseilles brothel who escape from their evil pimp after a shipwreck and eventually marry their rescuers; the darkly farcical sub-plot, paralleled in <span class="italic">Gunaikeion</span>, depicts the corpse of a murdered abbot being used as a prop in a twisted series of revenge plots. &#145;The Escapes of Jupiter&#146;, an adaptation of scenes from <span class="italic">The Golden Age</span> and <span class="italic">The Silver Age</span>, immediately follows &#145;The Captives&#146; in BL, Egerton MS 1994 (fols. 74&#150;95), and is also in Heywood's handwriting. Heywood has often been credited with yet another play preserved in the same manuscript, but in a different hand: &#145;Dick of Devonshire&#146;, an adventure play with a romantic sub-plot, based on the Spanish adventures of Richard Pike of Tavistock in 1625&#150;6.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The English Traveller</span> exhibits close similarities to &#145;The Captives&#146;, and must have been written about the same time, though it was not published for nearly a decade. Like &#145;The Captives&#146; it has one plot drawn from Plautus (here <span class="italic">Mostelleria</span>), and another retold in <span class="italic">Gunaikeion</span>. The main plot is superficially parallel to that of <span class="italic">A Woman Killed with Kindness</span>, except that the prodigal woman is married to one man (Wincott) while being courted by another (Geraldine); she thus betrays both men, and is generally a much less sympathetic figure. In the complementary sub-plot a prodigal son destroys his absent father's house through debauchery, but is ultimately forgiven when the father returns from his travels.<br>
<br>After virtually abandoning print for fifteen years, in 1631 Heywood began preparing several of his unpublished early plays for the press, adding a fascinating and sometimes conflicting running commentary on the publication process itself. In part one of the two-part <span class="italic">The Fair Maid of the West</span> (printed 1631), Heywood notes that his plays have been published not in &#145;a large volume; but singly (as thou seest) with great modesty, and small noise&#146;  (Turner, 4). Yet in the following year, in the two-part <span class="italic">The Iron Age</span> (printed 1632), Heywood announced his intention to publish all five <span class="italic">Ages</span> plays in an elaborate annotated volume, an intention which he never realized. In 1633 he published <span class="italic">The English Traveller</span> with a famous preface in which he claims to have had &#145;either an entire hand or at the least a main finger&#146; in 220 plays, saying that this one had only come &#145;accidentally to the press&#146; and that &#145;it never was any great ambition in me to be in this way voluminously read&#146;  (Merchant, 108). Heywood also edited a reissue of Sir Richard Barckley's 33-year-old <span class="italic">Discourse of the Felicity of Man</span> (1631), and the first edition of Marlowe's <span class="italic">Jew of Malta</span> (1633), adding prologues and epilogues for the play's recent revivals at court and at the Cockpit.<br>
<br>Also in 1631 Heywood wrote and published the first of his lord mayors' pageants, <span class="italic">Londons jus honorarium</span>, for the Haberdashers' Company. By the end of the decade he had written and published six more lord mayors' pageants, all steeped in classical lore as well as religious imagery: <span class="italic">Londini artium &amp; scientarium scaturigo</span> (1632, for the Haberdashers'); <span class="italic">Londini emporia</span> (1633, Clothworkers'); <span class="italic">Londini sinus salutis</span> (1635, Ironmongers'); <span class="italic">Londini speculum</span> (1637, Haberdashers'); <span class="italic">Porta pietatis</span> (1638, Drapers'); and <span class="italic">Londini status pacatus</span> (1639, Drapers'). Heywood had been a booster of apprentices and tradesmen since his earliest plays, and his commentary in the printed editions shows him to have been on good terms with the guilds which sponsored the pageants.<h2>
<a name="FinalyearsandHeywoodslegacy"></a>Final years and Heywood's legacy</h2>Religious imagery and themes had always informed Heywood's work, but they became especially prominent in the 1630s&#151;not only in his pageants, but in his second long narrative poem, <span class="italic">The Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels</span>, published in 1635 in a 630-page folio dedicated to Queen Henrietta Maria. This learned poem's nine books are each named after an angel or archangel; it begins by arguing for the existence of God, describes the elaborate Christian hierarchy of angels and spirits, and recounts the temptations offered by evil spirits. Among the many digressions is a famous one in which Heywood warmly recalls famous English poets, including Shakespeare, Jonson, and Marlowe. At roughly the same time that he was writing about evil spirits for <span class="italic">The Hierarchy</span>, Heywood collaborated with Richard Brome on the journalistic play <span class="italic">The Late Lancashire Witches</span> (1634), written for the King's Men and published quickly to capitalize on a recent witchcraft scare in Lancashire. The same authors also apparently collaborated on the lost plays &#145;Sir Thomas Skink&#146; and &#145;The Apprentice's Prize&#146;.<br>
<br>The religious convictions displayed in <span class="italic">The Hierarchy</span> were both sincere and orthodox; Clark's argument that Heywood became a puritan late in life has been decisively refuted by Holaday  (&#145;Puritans&#146;). Heywood waged a public battle in the 1630s against William Prynne, the puritan author of the anti-theatrical diatribe <span class="italic">Histriomastix</span> (1633), who had attacked Heywood and his <span class="italic">Apology for Actors</span> by name. Heywood had promised a reply to Prynne in the <span class="italic">English Traveller</span> preface (1633); in the preface to <span class="italic">A Maidenhead Well Lost</span> (printed 1634), he further denounces &#145;that most horrible <span class="roman">Histriomastix</span>&#146;, and in <span class="italic">A Challenge for Beauty</span> (printed 1636) he alludes to Prynne's 1634 imprisonment and punishment. Heywood never did reply at length to <span class="italic">Histriomastix</span>, though Clark argues that he satirized Prynne in his play <span class="italic">Love's Mistress, or, The Queen's Masque</span> (performed 1634, printed 1636).<br>
<br>The three plays just mentioned exhibit many similarities to Heywood's earlier work, but they abandon his usual middle-class protagonists in favour of royalty and courtly spectacle. <span class="italic">A Maidenhead Well Lost</span> is a dark comedy featuring Heywood's typical sexual misunderstandings and concern with honour, but its Italian court setting and loose morality mark it as distinctly Caroline. <span class="italic">A Challenge for Beauty</span> involves a hero (Lord Bonavida) who is banished overseas and falls in love with a strong woman (Hellena), much as in Heywood's early adventure plays. But the characters are all Spanish courtiers, and Baines considers the play a parody of the Fletcherian tragicomedies so popular in the Caroline era. The openly allegorical <span class="italic">Love's Mistress</span>, based on Apuleius's <span class="italic">The Golden Ass</span>, recalls Heywood's <span class="italic">Ages</span> plays but adopts the conventions of the Caroline court masque. It was quite successful, being presented before the king and queen three times in eight days with scenery designed by Inigo Jones, and was revived after the Restoration.<br>
<br>Following the publication of these new plays Heywood undertook to preserve more of his earlier works for posterity. In 1637 he issued <span class="italic">Pleasant Dialogues and Dramas</span>, a miscellaneous collection of mostly occasional verse dedicated to Henry Carey, earl of Dover. This volume includes translations of fifteen of Lucian's dialogues, fragments of two plays and a masque performed for Carey, prologues written for court performances of Heywood's plays, and various elegies, epitaphs, and acrostics. Heywood next published his early plays <span class="italic">The Royal King and the Loyal Subject</span> (1637) and <span class="italic">The Wise Woman of Hogsdon</span> (1638), and revised versions of <span class="italic">The Rape of Lucrece</span> (1638) and <span class="italic">If you Know not me, you Know Nobody</span> (1639) with prefaces complaining about the low quality of the earlier editions. He also wrote prefaces for several old plays published by his friend John Okes, including Henry Shirley's <span class="italic">The Martyred Soldier</span> (1639).<br>
<br>In addition to all this, Heywood published an astonishing quantity of new material in these last years, albeit nothing of any literary merit. He wrote commendatory verses for Mary Fage's <span class="italic">Fames Roule</span> (1637); Thomas Jordan's <span class="italic">Poetical Varieties</span> (1637); Shakerley Marmion's <span class="italic">Cupid and Psyche</span> (1637); Randulph Mayeres's <span class="italic">Mayeres his Travels</span> (1638); Humphrey Mill's <span class="italic">A Night's Search</span> (1640); and James Yorke's <span class="italic">The Union of Honour</span> (1640). He also wrote more than a dozen prose works, many largely recycled from his earlier writings. These include, among others, fantastic broadsides (<span class="italic">The Three Wonders of the Age</span>, 1636); defences of women (<span class="italic">Curtain Lecture</span>, 1637); religious pamphlets (<span class="italic">The Black Box of Rome Opened</span>, 1641); and the royally commissioned <span class="italic">True Description of his Majesty's Royal Ship</span> (1637). His last substantial work was <span class="italic">Nine the most Worthy Women of the World</span> (1640), published in a handsome quarto with admiring verses from friends. Heywood was buried on 16 August 1641 at St James's, Clerkenwell, bringing to a close one of the most prolific and varied careers in the history of English letters.<br>
<br>Heywood's reputation gradually faded in the decades after his death. Because his works were not published in folio like those of Shakespeare, Jonson, and Fletcher, and because several of his most popular works were published anonymously, his canon remained dispersed and uncertain; even at the end of the twentieth century Pearson's outdated 1874 edition remained the closest thing to a collection of his works. Despite Lamb's famous characterization of Heywood as &#145;a sort of prose Shakespeare&#146;  (C. Lamb, &#145;Heywood&#146;, 99), critics in the nineteenth and early twentieth century tended to be lukewarm in their praise, if they gave it at all. However, the flowering of feminist and new historicist criticism in the late twentieth century brought a new appreciation of Heywood for his vigorous defence of women and his interest in the lives of ordinary people. Revivals of his plays, including Stratford productions of <span class="italic">The Fair Maid of the West</span> (1986) and <span class="italic">A Woman Killed with Kindness</span> (1991), demonstrated the skill of his theatrical instincts. Though Heywood is unlikely to ever match the popularity of Shakespeare or Jonson, his works provide an invaluable glimpse into the literary world in which he worked, and his insights into human nature can still be affecting after 400 years.<br>
