<span class="headword">Gregory,  Alice Sophia</span>  (1867&#150;1946), <span class="occ">midwife</span>, was born on 22 November 1867 at St Mary's Parsonage, Princes Road, Lambeth, the youngest of three daughters of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33557/', "Robert Gregory (1819&#150;1911)")</script>, Church of England clergyman, later dean of St Paul's, and his second wife, Charlotte Anne, daughter of Admiral Sir Robert Stopford. Alice was educated at home by a governess and was very close to her sister Christiana, who was nearest to her in age. Alice led an uneventful life, sketching, making visits at home and abroad, attending lectures on cooking and health, until, at the age of twenty-six, she began to train as a general nurse at the Cottage Hospital, Paulton, Somerset, where Mrs Lelia Parnell, a widow, was matron. In 1895 Alice became a pupil at the Clapham School of Midwifery, where she studied under Dr Annie McCall (1859&#150;1949), and after attending eighty confinements she obtained her diploma as a trained midwife from the London Obstetrical Society. Alice then returned to Somerset where she worked as a district midwife for eight years. She supported herself from fees, amounting to 8<i>s</i>. for a confinement, and an allowance of &pound;50 from her father. In 1899 she met Maud Cashmore, seven years her junior, who accompanied Alice on her district rounds before studying obstetrics at the Clapham Maternity Hospital and qualifying as a midwife. Lelia, Alice, and Maud became close friends and remained inseparable companions for the rest of their lives. As Marks observed:<blockquote>Much of their work stemmed from a strong belief both that women could achieve independence through a professional career such as midwifery, and that women should be given the best possible maternity care. Their views and actions were also inspired by a deep sense of Christian morality and the need to help the poor, as well as a strong feminist orientation. (Marks, 73&#150;4)</blockquote>Alice Gregory and her friends were typical of a small number of middle-class women who took examinations in midwifery at a time when there was no requirement that midwives should be trained. However, there was growing pressure in the 1890s to raise the status of midwifery, which culminated in the <span class="roman">Midwives Act</span> of 1902. Thereafter no woman could use the title of midwife unless she was registered. Hence there was now a new emphasis on the need for training. Alice Gregory, along with Lelia Parnell and Maud Cashmore, began to develop a training scheme for midwives which would involve a year's training in general nursing and then six months' specialized midwifery training. The Midwives' Institute, which represented the interests of qualified midwives, thought that the plan was unrealistic and that training should increase by degrees. Undaunted, Alice Gregory acted on her own initiative. With the help of Charles Escreet, a clergyman who was chairman of the local board of guardians and the Charity Organization Society, she established a Home for Mothers and Babies in Woolwich in order to train educated women to work among the poor. The hospital was opened in May 1905 with six beds which quickly increased to twelve. Lelia Parnell was matron, Maud Cashmore head midwife, and Alice Gregory secretary and district nurse supervisor. Alice also founded the Council for Promoting the Higher Training of Midwives.<br>
<br>In 1915 the mothers' and babies' home was amalgamated with the lying-in hospital for married women in Long Acre and the name was changed to the British Hospital for Mothers and Babies. Further expansion was made possible when Alice Gregory was successful in gaining funding from the Ministry of Health to build a new hospital which was opened by Queen Mary on 22 May 1922. Lelia Parnell again acted as matron until her death in 1931 when Maud Cashmore took her place. By the 1930s the hospital had become so large that it passed out of the hands of the original founders into those of a hospital committee.<br>
<br>Alice Gregory made a significant contribution to the development of the training of midwives at a time of transition in the profession and this was recognized when she was made CBE in 1929. Many of her pupils found her to be an inspiring and supportive teacher, but she was also a controversial figure in the profession. She was a member of the council of the Midwives' Institute and was often at odds with the officers, in particular over her forthright criticisms of untrained &#145;handywomen&#146; and her assertion during the First World War that the majority of midwives were uninterested in antenatal care. None the less, in 1911 she was asked to represent the institute on the advisory committee for the <span class="roman">National Insurance Bill</span>.<br>
<br>Alice Gregory continued to work in the Woolwich hospital throughout the Second World War, when there was extensive damage to the building from air raids, and was instrumental in ensuring that a new wing was opened by the princess royal in 1944. In January of the next year she reported a troublesome cough and then hurt her back in a fall. In March she was diagnosed as having an enlarged heart and a congested lung which led to her resignation from the hospital in June. She retired with Maud Cashmore to The Sanctuary, a cottage on the south Downs, overlooking Alfriston, Sussex, which had been built for her by her father so that she could take short breaks in the countryside. It was here that she died on 8 November 1946 as a result of a cerebral haemorrhage.<br>
