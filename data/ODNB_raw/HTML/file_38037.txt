<span class="headword">Sutton, Sir  Robert</span>  (1671/2&#150;1746), <span class="occ">diplomatist and politician</span>, was the elder son of Robert Sutton of Averham, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Katherine, the daughter of the Revd William Sherborne of Pembridge, Herefordshire. He went to Trinity College, Oxford, in 1688 and the Middle Temple in 1691, the year in which he inherited property upon his father's death. Far from wealthy, he took deacon's orders and became chaplain to his cousin Robert Sutton, second Baron Lexington, the new ambassador to Vienna in 1694.<br>
<br>Sutton abandoned the church on being appointed secretary to the embassy at Vienna in 1697. As secretary and later resident he was responsible for English representation at Vienna in 1697&#150;1700, although William III placed more reliance on his Dutch counterpart. Thanks to Lexington's influence, Sutton was appointed ambassador at Constantinople in December 1700. Having been knighted in 1701, he reached Constantinople in early 1702 and remained there until 1717. Sutton served with distinction: his assessment of Turkish policy was usually correct, and he knew Italian and Latin, the crucial languages in Constantinople.<br>
<br>In 1717 Sutton was appointed, with Abraham Stanyan, joint mediator at the Austro-Turkish peace congress at Passarowitz, a task he discharged ably the following year and for which he was well rewarded. His last diplomatic posting was as ambassador and plenipotentiary in Paris. He was appointed in April 1720, but had to be threatened with dismissal by James Craggs, the secretary of state, before he would go. He was in Paris from June 1720 until November 1721, but the ministry had little confidence in him and appointed first John, second Baron Carteret (later Earl Granville), as ambassador-extraordinary in January 1721, a post he did not take up, and second Sir Luke Schaub as ambassador the following month. Schaub had already served in Paris, and he acted jointly with Sutton from March 1721 until the latter's departure.<br>
<br>Aside from the fact that he was considered a very good ombre player, opinions of Sutton varied considerably. Described to the French government in April 1720 as very gallant, and able in both diplomacy and the sciences, he was nevertheless criticized by one of George I's diplomats, St Saphorin, for being too inclined to sharp practice.<br>
<br>Sutton had become wealthy as a result of his diplomatic career, and he was one of the successful whig candidates in the very expensive Nottinghamshire election in April 1722, after which he was sworn of the privy council. He acquired estates in Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire, worth nearly &pound;5000 a year, and houses in Grosvenor Square, London, and at Broughton, Lincolnshire. In 1724 he married Judith, the daughter of Benjamin Tichborne and the widow of Charles Spencer, third earl of Sunderland. Two sons survived infancy. Sutton was appointed KCB in 1725 and moved the address in 1726, the same year he became sub-governor of the Royal African Company.<br>
<br>In 1725 Sutton became a member of the committee of management of the Charitable Corporation. Active in increasing the authorized capital of this corporation, he made money by insider dealing in its shares and was involved in the scandal following disclosures of extensive frauds in 1732, in which he himself lost severely. He was expelled from the Commons as a result of giving false statements, but was returned unopposed in 1734 for Great Grimsby, a venal borough that had elected other disreputable financiers and in which Sutton owned considerable property. He remained MP until 1741, and did not stand again. He played no further part in politics or business, having ceased his connection with the African Company in 1732, and died on 13 August 1746.<br>
