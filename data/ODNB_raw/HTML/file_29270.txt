<span class="headword">White,  Robert Meadows</span>  (1798&#150;1865), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and Anglo-Saxon scholar</span>, was born on 8 January 1798 at Halesworth, Suffolk, the eldest son of Robert Gostling White (<i>d</i>. 1828), a solicitor in that town, and his second wife, Elizabeth Meadows (<i>d</i>. 1831). His younger brother was the solicitor <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/29257/', "John Meadows White")</script>. Robert's early schooling was at Bungay under Robert Page, his godfather (1805&#150;1808?), and at Dedham, Essex, under the Revd Haggitts (1808&#150;1813?), and in 1813 he was placed under John Valpy at Norwich, where John Lindley, the botanist, and Raja Sir James Brooke were his fellow pupils. On 26 July 1815 he matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, and in the same year was elected a demy; he graduated BA on 14 December 1819, MA on 28 February 1822, BD on 21 November 1833, and DD on 23 November 1843. He was ordained deacon in 1821 and priest in 1822. In 1824 he was elected a fellow of Magdalen College, and retained his fellowship until 1847. From 1832 to 1840 he acted as a college tutor. On 15 March 1831 he became proctor, and on 23 April 1834 he was chosen Rawlinson professor of Anglo-Saxon, which post he held for the statutable period of five years.<br>
<br>Anglo-Saxon professors at that time were sometimes defined as &#145;persons willing to learn Anglo-Saxon&#146;. White, however, was known as a scholar before he was elected to the chair. He had already planned the publication of a Saxon and English vocabulary, and abandoned the project only because it appeared likely to clash with the <span class="italic">Anglo-Saxon Dictionary</span> then being prepared by Joseph Bosworth. On giving up this design he turned his attention about 1832 to editing the <span class="italic">Ormulum</span>, a harmonized narrative of the gospels in verse, preserved in a unique manuscript in the Bodleian Library. This task, owing to other demands on his time, occupied nearly twenty years. In the course of his researches he visited Denmark in 1837, and extended his travels to Moscow, where he was arrested and suffered a short detention for visiting the Kremlin without an official order. His edition of the <span class="italic">Ormulum</span> was published in 1852 by the university press, and in the following year an elaborate criticism of it was published in English by Dr Monicke, a German professor.<br>
<br>In 1839, at the end of his term of office, White was presented to the vicarage of Woolley, near Wakefield, by Godfrey Wentworth of that parish, to whose son William he had acted as tutor. After Wentworth's death White left Woolley, and went to Lord Yarborough at Brocklesby Park in Lincolnshire, where he acted as tutor to the baron's grandsons. In 1842 he was presented to the rectory of Little and Great Glemham in Suffolk by the Hon. Mrs North, Lord Yarborough's sister, and on 29 October 1846 he was presented by Magdalen College to the rectory of Slimbridge in Gloucestershire, which he retained until his death. He died unmarried at Cheltenham on 31 January 1865, and was buried at Slimbridge churchyard, near the chancel south wall.<br>
