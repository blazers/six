<span class="headword">Cordell,  Charles</span>  (1720&#150;1791), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest</span>, was born on 5 October 1720, the son of Charles Cordell of Holborn, London, and his wife, Hannah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Darell, of Scotney Castle, Sussex, and Calehill, Kent. Educated at Dame Alice's school at Fernyhalgh, Lancashire, he entered the English College at Douai in March 1734, and was ordained priest at Arras in December 1744. He was chaplain at Arundel Castle 1748&#150;55 and then at Red Hall, an estate also owned by the Howards, at Roundhay, Leeds, Yorkshire. On 10 June 1765 he took charge of the secular chapel in Newgate Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, where he continued until his death.<br>
<br>Cordell was a Jacobite in politics but an ecclesiastical progressive. He was admired for his preaching skills and he was an advocate of an English liturgy. His first literary effort was the controversial publication, at his own expense, of a four-volume edition of <span class="italic">The Divine Office for the Use of the Laity</span> (1763). To the further disapproval of the bishops, he introduced Sunday vespers in English at the chapel in Newcastle and in 1780 he issued a second edition of his <span class="italic">Divine Office</span> in a more convenient two-volume format; it was reissued in Manchester in 1806. Pope Clement XIV (the Franciscan Giovanni Ganganelli) suppressed the Society of Jesus in 1773 and Cordell reprimanded William Warrilow, his colleague and former Jesuit missioner in Newcastle, for criticizing the pope in the local press; relations between them never recovered. Cordell pursued his interest in Clement: in 1776 he published translations from the French as <span class="italic">The Life of Pope Clement XIV</span> and in the following year two volumes of <span class="italic">Interesting Letters of Pope Clement XIV</span>. In a <span class="italic">Letter</span> of 1785 he attacked the former Jesuits John Thorpe and John Jones, who had published <span class="italic">A Candid and Impartial Sketch of the Life and Government of Pope Clement XIV</span> (1785) which vilified the pontiff.<br>
<br>Cordell's later publication of translations from the French of some obscure works prompted Henry Rutter, a fellow missioner in the area, to remark that he had <i>cacoethes scribendi</i>; Rutter also questioned Cordell's wisdom because many unsold copies of the books were left on Cordell's hands  (Gooch, <span class="italic">Revival</span>). Cordell was influential in the development of the book trade in Newcastle. His scholarly reputation led to an offer of the presidency of the English College at St Omer in 1778 but he declined it. Cordell became odd, though whether this was a symptom of eccentricity or illness is unclear; Rutter said that Cordell was never invited to participate in Holy Week services because he would create confusion, and he reported that in his later years Cordell was unable to carry out any ecclesiastical duty and had asked to be buried in his garden  (ibid.). Cordell died on 26 January 1791 and was buried in St John's Church, Newcastle.<br>
