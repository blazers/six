<span class="headword">Kennedy,  John Pitt</span>  (1796&#150;1879), <span class="occ">army officer and engineer</span>, fourth son of John Pitt Kennedy, rector of Carn Donagh, co. Donegal, and afterwards of Balteagh, co. Londonderry, and Mary, only daughter of Thomas Cary of Loughash, co. Tyrone, was born at Donagh on 8 May 1796. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51398/', "Tristram Edward Kennedy")</script> was his brother. He was educated at Foyle College, Londonderry, under the Revd James Knox. He entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, on 6 November 1811, passed out fourth of his year in 1813, and was commissioned second lieutenant, Royal Engineers, on 1 September 1815.<h2>
<a name="IonianIslands18191831"></a>Ionian Islands, 1819&#150;1831</h2>Kennedy was employed on the Ordnance Survey in Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire for a short time, and served at Plymouth, Chatham, and Portsmouth until 1819, when he was sent to Malta, and thence to Corfu in the Ionian Islands, a British protectorate from 1815 to 1863. On 6 April 1820 he was made director of public works at Santa Maura. He constructed a small harbour on the eastern side of the island, with a canal from it to the natural harbour on the west, and lengthened the mole. He was promoted lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 19 June 1821, but went on half pay on 28 May 1822 when the corps was reduced in size.<br>
<br>On the appointment of Major Charles Napier as military resident of Cephalonia in 1822 Kennedy became island secretary and director of public works. He there built the Guardianno and Point Theodore lighthouses, a marine parade, a quay, and a market, and he intersected the island with roads. Napier formed a high opinion of Kennedy's abilities, and wrote of his &#145;genius&#146; and that he was &#145;an excellent architect&#146;  (W. Napier, 1.389, 318). Kennedy became Napier's best friend&#151;their friendship was to be lifelong&#151;and helped him through difficult times with his tempestuous Cephalonian mistress, Anastasia. Napier continued to attempt to advance Kennedy's career.<br>
<br>Kennedy was brought back to the Royal Engineers from half pay on 23 March 1825, returned to England in 1826, and was sent to Woolwich. To retain his Cephalonia appointment he was, at Napier's request, transferred from the Royal Engineers on 20 April 1826 to the 50th foot, as lieutenant. He ceased duty at Woolwich on 14 May, and on 10 June 1826 purchased an unattached company and returned to Cephalonia. On 3 January 1828 he was appointed sub-inspector of militia in the Ionian Islands, a position he held until 1 March 1831, when he returned home and settled in Ireland. He bought land in Donegal which he believed would be a profitable investment.<h2>
<a name="ServiceinIreland18311849"></a>Service in Ireland, 1831&#150;1849</h2>Kennedy attempted to remedy the deplorable state of the Irish peasants, and to show by small-scale practical example what might be done for the country. He devoted himself to teaching the farmers the principles of agriculture, and to setting the unemployed to cultivate wastelands. He managed the property of his nephew (also John Pitt Kennedy; 1824&#150;1897) at Lough Ash in co. Tyrone, and the Clogher, co. Tyrone, estate of Sir Thomas Charles Style, baronet, who is not to be confused with Sir Charles's first cousin once removed, Charles Style (1777&#150;1853) of the nearby estate of Glenmore, Stranorlar, co. Donegal, whose daughter Kennedy married in 1838. Both at Lough Ash and Clogher, Kennedy established a national school, and arranged practical agricultural lessons on a model farm of a few acres. He also divided the wastelands into reclaiming farms, and had great success. In 1833 he visited agricultural schools in Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland. On 19 June 1835 he was brought in from half pay to the 28th foot, and on 26 June he sold out to devote the money from his commission to the furtherance of his schools. Kennedy married Anna (Annie) Maria Style (<i>c</i>.1819&#150;1902) in Dublin on 2 October 1838, and they had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In November 1837 Kennedy was appointed inspector-general in the Irish national education department, on the understanding that practical instruction in agriculture was to become prominent in education. Inspectors were appointed under him for each county by public competition, and he chose 60 acres at Glasnevin, north of Dublin, with a large house and garden, for a central model farm and training establishment for teachers from the district schools, who also were trained in teaching at Dublin. His plan was to have a second-class agricultural school, subordinate to the central school, in each of the four provinces, a third-class school in each county, a fourth-class school in each barony, and a fifth-class school connected with each elementary school. However, his proposals were persistently thwarted by some members of the board, and the board itself, largely officials fully occupied with their particular duties, did so little to advance agricultural and other education that on 18 March 1839 Kennedy wrote a spirited protest, resigned, and returned to Lough Ash.<br>
<br>Napier (now Sir Charles) wrote a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Essay Addressed to Irish Absentees on the State of Ireland</span>, on the value of Kennedy and of his plan. In January 1838 Kennedy had declined an Australian governorship in order to continue to promote his views on agricultural education in an appointment which he described as neither lucrative nor brilliant. He was self-confident and optimistic and believed in the possibility of progress; &#145;his promises were alluring, and his views so forcibly stated that they always commanded attention&#146;  (Sandes, 106). Napier and his brother, William, continued to believe his potential wasted and that, given the chance, he could have achieved great change in Ireland. In 1844 William Napier wrote to Charles, &#145;If the government had decided to give Kennedy a free hand in his education and farming schemes in Ireland people would have been well off by now, and O'Connell would have had no following beyond his immediate ones&#146;  (P. Napier, <span class="italic">Raven Castle</span>, 29).<br>
<br>Sir Robert Peel, as part of his Irish &#145;conciliation&#146; policy, in November 1843 appointed a small royal commission, of Irish landowners chaired by the earl of Devon, on the law and practice of land occupation in Ireland. Kennedy was appointed&#151;&#145;<i>without any solicitation</i> from myself or any friend&#146;  (Kennedy to Napier, 13 Dec 1843, Napier papers, d. 243/1)&#151;secretary to the Devon commission, which reported in February 1845. It heard many witnesses and received many written submissions, and the work was arduous, resulting in five printed folio volumes, with a mass of data and criticism of the social and economic system and of bad landlords, but only limited proposals for legislation, including compensation for tenants' improvements. In November 1845 Peel, responding to the Irish potato blight, appointed the temporary relief commission, comprising some of the most influential and able members of the Irish administration, to supervise the local relief committees and their distribution of the grain the government had purchased overseas. Possibly because Sir Charles Napier wrote to Peel on behalf of Kennedy, &#145;a man without a match&#146;  (P. Napier, <span class="italic">Raven Castle</span>, 104), the latter was appointed secretary of the commission.<br>
<br>In 1846 Kennedy was appointed superintendent of the relief works in the western division of co. Limerick under the board of works, an appointment he relinquished in September on becoming agent for Lord Devon's extensive estates in co. Limerick. He was also a director of the Waterford and Limerick Railway. In spring 1848, when excitement was great and a revolution was expected in Dublin, Kennedy volunteered to organize security measures. The city authorities gave him control over the volunteer arrangements. He divided the city into defence districts; maps were distributed showing the key points in each district, the defence of which would secure the whole. At this crisis the Dublin Orangemen offered their services to the lord lieutenant. Lord Clarendon declined, as they had passed resolutions accusing the government of encouraging popery, and demanding that Roman Catholics be suppressed. Kennedy, thinking more of the safety of Dublin than of politics, enrolled them among his volunteers, and gave them &pound;600 to purchase arms. This was to form one of the grounds of an attack on the government in the House of Lords on 18 February 1850, in response to which Lord Clarendon defended the government, and declared that Kennedy had generously provided the money for these arms out of his own pocket without the knowledge of the government, and with the laudable intention of keeping the Orangemen loyal.<h2>
<a name="DirectandindirectlinkswithIndia18491879"></a>Direct and indirect links with India, 1849&#150;1879</h2>When in 1849 Sir Charles Napier was appointed commander-in-chief in India, he offered Kennedy the post of military secretary, and obtained permission for him to re-enter the army. Kennedy was reinstated in the army on 23 March 1849 as ensign in the 25th foot, and on 4 May he was appointed to a cornetcy in the 14th light dragoons, with the local rank of major in the East Indies. He went to India with Napier, and accompanied the expedition to Peshawar to open the pass and relieve the fortress of Kohat in 1850.<br>
<br>Besides his duties as military secretary, Kennedy devoted his spare time to the construction of a great military road from the plains through Simla towards Tibet, and a company of sappers was placed at his disposal. The road bore his name. In November 1850 he was appointed consulting engineer to the government of India for railways, and went to Calcutta to take charge of the railway department. He strongly opposed any break of gauge, and planned a system of railways throughout India.<br>
<br>In September 1852, in a memorandum to the directors, Kennedy made proposals for a general system of railways which, he claimed, would enable reduction in the army and so financial saving, and he criticized the achievement of railway engineers in England. However, his plans were based on incorrect assumptions, one of which was that railways should run almost on a dead level and along coastlines and rivers. His proposals were condemned by the government's railway consulting engineers, who alleged his data were erroneous, he exaggerated the saving on military expenditure, and that the railways could not be built in the way he proposed. According to E. W. C. Sandes, Kennedy's proposals were &#145;typical of the grandiose schemes which have so often been propounded by imaginative engineers in any new field of endeavour without the collection of sufficient data&#146;  (Sandes, 107). However, Kennedy's health failed, and he resigned and returned to Britain in 1852. A minute of the governor-general, Lord Dalhousie, stated that his departure was a public loss to the government. He was promoted lieutenant on 15 March 1853, exchanged into the 42nd foot on 24 June, gazetted lieutenant-colonel in the East Indies, and placed on half pay on 11 November 1853.<br>
<br>On his arrival in England Kennedy became one of the founders and the managing director and chief engineer of the Bombay, Baroda, and Central Indian Railway, and in September 1853 he returned to India, and surveyed the line. An ingenious engineer, he experimented successfully on the Surat&#150;Ahmadabad line with special piers for railway bridges on alluvial soils, and speeded construction by standardizing his iron bridge spans. From 1854 his home was in England, and he continued active on the board of directors for the remainder of his life. In 1859 he induced the court of directors to permit him to extend the railway south to Bombay, building under difficult conditions a succession of bridges, using metal screw piles filled with concrete. An enthusiastic optimist, he underestimated the cost of building the railway. However, largely owing to his energy Bombay gained an additional outlet for trade, and better communications with the hinterlands of Broach and Surat, which produced excellent cotton. Kennedy again visited India for the company in 1863&#150;4. He was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 3 March 1868, and in 1872 he promoted a company for building with concrete.<h2>
<a name="Kennedyspublications"></a>Kennedy's publications</h2>Kennedy's publications included many pamphlets on Irish and Indian issues: agriculture, railways, and others. Among them were <span class="italic">Instruct; employ; don't hang them, or, Ireland tranquilized without soldiers and enriched without English capital</span> (1835); <span class="italic">Analysis of projects proposed for the relief of the poor of Ireland</span> (1837); <span class="italic">Road-making in the hills. Principles and rules having special reference to the new road from Kalka vi&acirc; Simla to Kunawur and Thibet</span> (1850); <span class="italic">Finances, military occupation, government, and industrial development of India</span> (1858); <span class="italic">On the financial and executive administration of the British Indian empire</span> (1859); <span class="italic">National defensive measures, their necessity, description, organization, and cost</span> (1860); and <span class="italic">Railway gauge, considered in relation to the bulk and weight of goods to be conveyed, more especially in India</span> (1872). Kennedy died on 28 June 1879 at his residence, 66 St George's Square, Pimlico, London. His wife, one son, Charles Napier Kennedy, and his daughter, Mrs Florence Martin, survived him. Kennedy was a man of great ability and simplicity, unworldly and disinterested. However, living in an era of impressive technological progress, he was sometimes unrealistic and over-optimistic in his schemes.<br>
