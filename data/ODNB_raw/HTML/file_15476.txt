<span class="headword">Kershaw,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1730?, <em>d.</em> 1797), <span class="occ">Methodist preacher</span>, was born in Halifax, and may be the individual of that name, son of another James Kershaw, who was baptized in the town on 8 September 1730. Details of his upbringing are unknown. He joined a Socinian club in Halifax, whose members deputed him and another, in 1761, to attend a sermon to be delivered by the evangelical Henry Venn at Huddersfield, in order &#145;to furnish matter of merriment for the next meeting&#146;. But Kershaw left the church after the sermon exclaiming, &#145;Surely God is in this place; there is no matter for laughter here.&#146; He subsequently called on the preacher, was converted, and became one of Venn's constant correspondents. Kershaw soon afterwards became known as an itinerant Methodist preacher; he accompanied John Wesley on some of his journeys in the north of England, and was with him in Scotland in 1764 and 1765.<br>
<br>Kershaw settled at Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, about 1770, and was famous in the neighbourhood for his quack medicines. He continued to preach occasionally for the Methodists, and Wesley visited him at Tealby in 1786. Thomas Jackson remembered hearing him preach in a Yorkshire farmhouse: &#145;He was a fine-looking man, and was known in Yorkshire by the name of &#147;Dr Kershaw&#148;. He travelled through the country in his own vehicle, preaching in the villages and giving medical advice to the labouring classes&#146;  (Jackson, 220). Charles Atmore described him as talented but unstable, a judgement borne out by James Everett's account of how he was so eager to impress the marquess of Rockingham when given an opportunity of preaching before him that he overshot the mark and brought ridicule and dishonour on the Methodism he represented. Similarly, his well-intentioned intervention in the dispute over the publication of James Hervey's letters to Wesley in 1764 only served to exacerbate the controversy.<br>
<br>Much of Kershaw's leisure after leaving the itinerancy was devoted to writing. In 1780 he published <span class="italic">An Essay on the Principal Parts of the Book of the Revelations</span>. The same year his epic poem <span class="italic">The Methodist Attempted in Plain Metre</span> was published in Nottingham. Wesley's disapproval was less on the grounds of its lack of literary merit than for fear that it brought reproach on the Methodists and would hinder the sale and reading of more profitable literature. As a result, the Methodist conference of 1781 decreed that in future no preacher should publish until the text had been seen and edited by Wesley, and that any profits from such publications should be paid into a common fund. An even more ambitious work, <span class="italic">The grand and extensive plan of human redemption from the ruins of the fall &hellip; in twelve familiar dialogues</span>, appeared in 1797, the year of his death at Ashby-de-la-Zouch.<br>
<br>No details exist of Kershaw's marriage, though he did have at least one son, John (<i>d</i>. 1855), who entered the Wesleyan ministry in 1788 and was for four years (1823&#150;7) the Methodist book steward, but found the administrative burden too great for him. Thomas Jackson found him &#145;a most amiable, friendly and upright man&#146; whose acquaintances were struck by his striking resemblance to the duke of Kent. <a name="cosubject_15476"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Kershaw</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1800), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, may also have been James Kershaw's son. Educated at Wesley's Kingswood School near Bristol, he later contributed to the <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span>, and was employed by London booksellers in the enlargement of, among other titles, John Walker's <span class="italic">Universal Gazetteer</span>.<br>
