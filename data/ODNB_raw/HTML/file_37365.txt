<span class="headword">Dolben,  Digby Augustus Stewart Mackworth</span>  (1848&#150;1867), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 8 February 1848 in Guernsey, the youngest in the family of one daughter and three sons of William Harcourt Isham Mackworth Dolben and his wife, Frances Dolben. Born William Mackworth, his father added his wife's surname to his own: they were distant cousins and she was joint heir of the manor of Finedon, Northamptonshire. Together they assumed their place in the foothills of county aristocracy. The literary interest of the family is indicated by their relationship to the poets Robert Bridges, Arthur Hugh Clough, and Winthrop Mackworth Praed.<br>
<br>Both of Digby Dolben's parents were deeply religious and almost violently anti-Catholic. He was first sent to a strictly protestant preparatory school in Cheam, then entered Eton College in January 1862, where his house was chosen for the &#145;staunch Protestant bias&#146; of the cleric in charge. He became fag to his cousin Robert Bridges, whom he had not previously met. Dolben early developed his twin interests in extreme high-church religion and poetry, both of which were marked with strong eroticism. He was sent down from Eton in 1863 for a few months for having made a forbidden visit to a Jesuit house. Early in 1864, before he was sixteen, he became a lay member of an irregular order of English Benedictines under the leadership of &#145;Father Ignatius&#146; (Joseph Leycester Lyne), and loved to wear a monk's habit and cowl with bare feet. At the end of that year he left Eton finally, to study with private tutors before taking entrance examinations for Balliol College, Oxford.<br>
<br>In February 1865 Dolben made a brief visit to Oxford, where he was introduced to Gerard Manley Hopkins, their only meeting in person. Hopkins was completely taken with Dolben, who was nearly four years his junior, and his private journal for confession the following year proves how absorbed he was in imperfectly suppressed erotic thoughts of him. Although Dolben was probably not emotionally interested in Hopkins, he admired him and his poetry, and the two young men deeply influenced each other in both their verse and their intentions of becoming Roman Catholic converts, an ambition Dolben had not fulfilled at his death.<br>
<br>Dolben was an unusually charming and humorous young man, who loved to shock both contemporaries and elders by emotional and religious excess; his poetry reflects his flamboyant interests. He demonstrated enormous fluency and ease, often in high-church devotional poems in which the physical urgency of a boy in his teens spills over into sexual imagery in describing his love of Christ. Bridges, who edited his poetry in 1911, said drily that reading it &#145;makes one see why schoolmasters wish their boys to play games&#146;. Bridges regarded his work as equal to &#145;anything that was ever written by any English poet at his age&#146;, and it was much admired by Henry James. As it stands, it is among the best of the poetry of the Oxford Movement, and probably a longer life would have produced the mastery foreseen by Bridges and James.<br>
<br>After two years of preparing with tutors, Dolben fainted during his matriculation examinations for entrance into Balliol College on 2 May 1867, and failed. On 28 June 1867 he was drowned in the River Welland near Luffenham, probably having suffered a stroke, trying to save the life of his tutor's young son. He was nineteen years old, and it was the end of a life of exceptional poetic promise.<br>
