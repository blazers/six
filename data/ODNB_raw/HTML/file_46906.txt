<span class="headword">Hooper,  Anne</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em> de Tscerlas]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1555), <span class="occ">protestant exile</span>, is of obscure origins. Little is known about her parentage or early life, though several sources confirm that she was born into a noble family from the Low Countries, near Antwerp. Anne had at least one sister (later the wife of the French reformer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68327/', "Val&#233;rand Poullain")</script>) who accompanied her into exile, as well as one brother, who alongside her parents remained staunchly Catholic.<br>
<br>It is not known when Anne and her sister converted to reformed belief, or the circumstances in which they went into exile, although it is possible that after leaving Antwerp they formed part of the household of the reformist Belgian noble Jacques de Bourgogne, seigneur de Falais, in Strasbourg, where by January 1546 they had taken up residence in the house of the exiled English merchant Richard Hilles. It was here that Anne first met her future husband, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13706/', "John Hooper")</script>, a former monk and an English exile, who described their meeting in a letter written at this time to Heinrich Bullinger, stating that he had met &#145;two sisters of noble family, the younger of whom named Anna is exceedingly favourable to true religion&#146;  (Robinson, 1.38).<br>
<br>Although the exact date of their marriage is unknown, it most likely took place after John Hooper had returned from a visit to England to secure his inheritance in spring 1546. Marriage to Hooper meant that Anne became one of the first English post-Reformation bishops' wives. Hooper first referred to Anne as his wife in a letter dated shortly after 12 December 1546, and Bullinger's diary recorded that the couple visited him in Z&uuml;rich in March 1547. Over the following years they established close relationships with many of the other leading Swiss reformers and their families, and after their return to England frequently remembered Z&uuml;rich with great affection in their letters. Their first child, Rachel, was born there in March 1548, and baptized in the Grossm&uuml;nster church, with Bullinger and the wife of Theodore Bibliander as godparents.<br>
<br>Although Edward VI had succeeded to the throne in January 1547, the Hoopers did not set out for England until spring 1549. Their journey, which can be traced through surviving letters from Hooper to Bullinger, took them via Germany and Switzerland. Pausing in Antwerp before their crossing to England, Hooper described how his wife had tried to make contact with her natal family, but that on receiving her letter her brother had thrown it into the fire without reading it, and he concluded sadly that &#145;you see the words of Christ are true, that the brother shall persecute the brother for the sake of the word of God&#146;  (Robinson, 1.63). The family finally arrived in London in May 1549, whereupon Hooper was appointed chaplain to the duke of Somerset.<br>
<br>During their time in London the Hoopers appear to have kept up a busy social life, alongside John's demanding preaching schedule. Although clerical marriage had been legalized in England only in February 1549, Anne appears to have been integrated into London society. In a letter to Bullinger dated 20 May 1550, the couple's mutual friend Marten Micronius described how Anne had recently been invited to the mansion of &#145;a certain noble lady in the vicinity of the city of London for a change of air&#146;, most likely a reference to the duchess of Somerset  (Robinson, 2.196). The Hoopers were also invited to dine with the community of international reformers who had congregated in London, and they gave hospitality at their London home to several fellow exiles from Z&uuml;rich, including John Stumphius and John ab Ulmis.<br>
<br>Although Hooper was offered a bishopric as early as Lent 1550, his opposition to the ceremony surrounding the consecration of bishops led to a high-profile disputation and short period of imprisonment, before he was eventually consecrated as bishop of Gloucester on 8 March 1551. These events are touched on in the first surviving letter from Anne to Bullinger, dated 3 April 1551, in which she explained that she would have to pass Bullinger's latest message on to Hooper as he had already left London for his new diocese, and she thought it best for him to explain the reasons behind his imprisonment himself. It also contained a request for Bullinger to urge her husband to be more moderate in his labours, and an update on her daughter Rachel's progress. The latter was a feature of many of Hooper's own letters, for at just three years old Rachel appeared to be something of a prodigy, and according to her parents could understand English, French, German, and Latin, and had also learned all the basic tenets of religion by heart. Although John Foxe claimed that Hooper was primarily responsible for the education of his children (a second child, Daniel, was born some time after August 1551), his frequent absences from home, combined with Anne's known learning and fluency in Latin, make it likely that she too played a considerable part in their early education, while Hooper entrusted their education to her sole care after his death.<br>
<br>After joining Hooper in his diocese Anne appears to have taken on new responsibilities, and on 27 October 1551 she apologized to Bullinger for her slow response to his letter, stating that &#145;she had been overwhelmed by so many and urgent engagements that scarce any leisure was allowed me&#146;  (Robinson, 1.107). For his part Hooper reported how Anne had fallen dangerously ill with the sweating sickness during the summer of 1551, having previously succumbed to bouts of ill health in London. While Hooper was generally praised in his new role by his fellow exiles, who also spoke fondly of his family, he and Anne were criticized by Micronius for being too caught up in worldly concerns. Writing to Bullinger on 14 August 1551 Micronius asked him to warn Anne specifically of &#145;the thorns, by which the word of God is choked&#146;, noting that it was &#145;a most dangerous thing for one who is in the service of Christ to hunt after riches and honour&#146;  (Robinson, 2.576).<br>
<br>With the accession of Mary I in July 1553 the religious situation rapidly changed, and by September Hooper had been imprisoned in the Fleet. Initially able to send and receive correspondence quite freely, he sent a long letter to Anne on 13 October entitled an &#145;Exhortation to patience&#146;. Although it is possible the letter was also intended for distribution to a wider audience, it referred to Anne as my &#145;godly&#146; and &#145;dearly beloved&#146; wife throughout, and instructed her how to cope with the challenges that lay ahead. Drawing her attention to the twenty-fourth chapter of <span class="roman">St Matthew's gospel</span>, &#145;of the which place you and I have taken many times great consolation&#146;, he urged Anne to remember it and mark it again for future use  (Nevinson, 569). He concluded his letter by reaffirming his belief in Anne's salvation, and signed it &#145;your brother in Christ John Hooper&#146;  (ibid., 570). Hooper also demonstrated his evident concern for the well-being and safety of his wife and children in his letters from prison to Bullinger, who responded that he would be willing to help them in any way possible.<br>
<br>Although Anne initially stayed in England, by early 1554 Hooper had evidently decided it was no longer safe for her to remain and had persuaded her to leave. Writing to Bullinger on 20 April, Anne described how she had travelled with a party from Antwerp to Frankfurt, where her brother-in-law Val&eacute;rand Poullain was the chief minister of the foreign church. While Rachel had travelled with her, her young son, Daniel, had been left behind, to be brought over by a female friend at a later date. Anne expressed her thanks to Bullinger for his wish that she could join him in Z&uuml;rich, but explained her preference for remaining in Frankfurt until Hooper's fate was settled. Describing recent events in England she declared that God had visited her with a calamity &#145;in which I was forced not only to lament the common condition of the church at large, but also my own individual affliction&#146;  (Robinson, 1.110). This ordeal had almost caused her &#145;woman's mind&#146; to &#145;immediately give way&#146;, but the spirit of the Lord had been with her and she had been comforted by several godly ministers, among whom Bullinger's letter had been the most gratefully received  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Although exile could bring financial hardship, Anne described how she had been able to acquire &#145;my own hired house&#146;, from which she appears to have played an active part in the exile community  (Robinson, 1.110). Her subsequent letters to Bullinger include numerous details about the establishment and organization of the exile church in Frankfurt, and show that through her personal connections she was able to act as a mediator for contacts between Z&uuml;rich and Frankfurt. At one stage she forwarded the exile church's prayer book to Bullinger for his approval, along with Poullain's greetings, and demonstrated her own concern for the state of the reformed church, passing on what news she heard from England and Germany.<br>
<br>However, the fate of her husband was never far from Anne Hooper's mind and the letters reveal her increasing desperation as the news from England got worse. Writing on 12 November 1554 she described how she often &#145;felt all but dead with grief&#146;, though she still thanked Bullinger for his continuing prayers and support for both herself and her husband  (Robinson, 1.113). Her final surviving letter was written on 11 April 1555, two months after Hooper's execution on 9 February, and expressed her grief as well as a request to Bullinger to print one of the last works written by Hooper in prison. It concluded with a postscript stating that Rachel had sent an English coin &#145;on which are the effigies of Ahab and Jezebel&#146;, by whom she meant King Philip and Queen Mary  (Robinson, 1.115). Anne remained in Frankfurt until her death on 7 December 1555 during an outbreak of plague. It seems that she was followed shortly afterwards by her daughter, Rachel, but that her son, Daniel, survived a little longer. After her death he went to live with Edward Oldsworth, who alongside Val&eacute;rand Poullain, his godfather, had been appointed as his guardian, but there is no subsequent record of him.<br>
