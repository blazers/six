<span class="headword">Donaldson,  Walter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1574), <span class="occ">philosopher</span>, was baptized at St Nicholas, Aberdeen, on 11 November 1574, the son of Alexander Donaldson, burgess of Aberdeen, and his wife, Elizabeth Lamb. He perhaps took his degree in arts at King's College, Aberdeen, and it is known that in 1598 he accompanied David Cunningham, bishop of Aberdeen, on an embassy to Denmark and to the German protestant princes. Donaldson enrolled at Heidelberg on 11 September 1599 to study the laws. By 1603 he was appointed to the protestant academy of Sedan, where he remained for sixteen years. His son recorded that Donaldson remained in France for about forty years, first as professor of natural and moral philosophy, thereafter as academy principal; in Sedan he was pastor of the protestant church. From there he was appointed principal of the new protestant academy proposed at Charenton outside Paris, a foundation opposed by Paris University. Thus his stay at Charenton was brief, though he soon became principal at the academy of La Rochelle, where John Leech wrote some verses to him and described him as poet laureate; Leech had graduated in arts at King's College in 1614. An attempt was made by Patrick Copland to have Donaldson appointed to Marischal College. Donaldson would have preferred an Aberdeen appointment to a continental one; he visited the city in 1606 to become a burgess in succession to his father and again in 1621 to renew his burgess claim.<br>
<br>At Heidelberg, Donaldson gave a course on moral philosophy to private pupils, one of whom printed his notes, which were published as <span class="italic">Synopsis moralis philosophiae</span> at Frankfurt am Main in 1604. Donaldson himself republished the work at Darmstadt in 1606 and further editions subsequently appeared. The publication of 1606 was dedicated to the duc de Bouillon, founder of Sedan, with verses by Zacharias Palthenus. Book 1 is concerned with definitions of ethics and its relevance to the man of politics. Its study is concerned with the pursuit of happiness; he makes the point that there are grades of happiness. Book 2 concerns virtue in general, focusing on moral virtue, though intellectual virtues are mentioned. As principal of Sedan, in 1613 Donaldson published his panegyric on the death the previous year of Henry Frederick, prince of Wales.<br>
<br>Donaldson also presided over several printed theses not recorded in Aberdeen bibliographies. According to <span class="italic">L'ex&eacute;g&egrave;se de l'ethique: histoire litt&eacute;raire</span>, a Paris publication, he moderated at least the following printed theses: <span class="italic">De virtutibus intellectivis</span> (1603), <span class="italic">De principibus actionum humanorum</span> (1604), <span class="italic">De justitia</span> (1605); <span class="italic">De habitibus moralibus imperfectis</span> (1605); <span class="italic">De amicitia</span> (1605); <span class="italic">Disputatio publica quae est de familia primo republicae fundamento</span> (1606). He also seems to have lectured on Greek and on political theory. In 1628 John Leech sent some Donaldsonian verses on the marquis d'Avere to John Scot of Scotstarvit, but these do not appear in the <span class="italic">Delitiae poetarum Scotorum</span> (1637). Donaldson entices the literary student with references to classical writers, Latin and Greek, notices a few medieval writers like Thomas Aquinas and &#145;our Scotus&#146;, but notes more modern writers like Toledo, Lipsius, and Muret. The 1620 Paris edition of <span class="italic">Synopsis oeconomica</span> is dedicated to the future Charles I, and mentions his courtiers James Foulerton and Thomas Murray. Donaldson's ethical course is largely based on Aristotle's <span class="italic">Nicomachean Ethics</span>, and the economics course is founded on Xenophon updated. For Donaldson, society is a natural growth whose roots are in nature. His <span class="italic">Synopsis oeconomica</span> makes the family its first consideration. He writes that he was professor at Sedan of civil and natural philosophy, of Greek also, and was its principal. His book starts with the father; no word occurs oftener in sacred letters and he cites Buchanan's psalms in support. Woman is man's helper, her main job the bearing of children; the father is the ship's captain. Servants are acquired by the father to be educated, exercised, and corrected. Servants' pay must be paid faithfully, but tipping is disallowed. The virtues of servants are obedience, diligence, trustworthiness, and silence.<br>
<br>Donaldson was determined to popularize Dionysius Laertius, publishing a selection of his material in <span class="italic">Electa La&euml;rtiana</span> (Frankfurt, 1625). Donaldson's theological views occasionally intrude with references mainly to Paul and he was close to the Arminian Daniel Tilenus, an important figure at Sedan. Donaldson's first wife was Catherine Dervilliers and his second Elizabeth Goffin, mother of his eldest son, Alexander, a doctor of medicine. The date of Donaldson's death is unknown.<br>
