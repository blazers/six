<span class="headword">Mason,  Francis</span>  (1837&#150;1886), <span class="occ">surgeon</span>, youngest son of Nicholas Mason, a lace merchant, of Wood Street, Cheapside, London, and his wife, Ann, was born at Islington on 21 July 1837. He received his early education at the Islington proprietary school, of which John Jackson, afterwards bishop of London, was then the headmaster. Mason subsequently attended the King's School, Canterbury, and, matriculating at the London University, he pursued his medical studies at King's College, London, of which he was made an honorary fellow. While in the medical school attached to King's College, Mason became a friend of Sir William Fergusson, who formed such a high opinion of Mason's surgical skill that he made him his private assistant. Mason was admitted a member of the Royal College of Surgeons on 25 July 1858. He served as house surgeon at King's College Hospital in 1859&#150;60, and he was granted the diploma of fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons on 11 December 1862.<br>
<br>In 1863 Mason was appointed an assistant surgeon to King's College Hospital, and surgeon to the St Pancras and Northern Dispensary. In 1867 he became assistant surgeon to, and lecturer on anatomy at, the Westminster Hospital, and he became full surgeon there in 1871. Later the same year Mason accepted an invitation to join the medical staff of St Thomas's Hospital as assistant surgeon and lecturer on anatomy. He became full surgeon there in 1876, when he resigned the lectureship of anatomy for that of practical surgery. From 1879 to 1886, Mason was editor of the hospital's <span class="italic">Reports</span>.<br>
<br>Mason filled many important offices at the Medical Society of London, being orator in 1870, Lettsomian lecturer in 1878, president in 1882, and subsequently treasurer. Throughout his professional career he published a number of works, including <span class="italic">On Harelip and Cleft Palate</span> (1877) and <span class="italic">On the Surgery of the Face</span> (1878), which were well received.<br>
<br>Mason was a man of genial character and had great musical talents. He died of acute erysipelatous inflammation of the throat, at his home at 5 Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, London, on 5 June 1886, leaving a widow; there were no children. He was buried at Highgate.<br>
