<span class="headword">McKellar,  John Campbell</span>  (1859&#150;1941), <span class="occ">architect and builder</span>, was born on 1 November 1859 in Glasgow, the son of Robert McKellar, bleacher, dyer, and property developer, of Newlandsfield, Pollokshaws, Glasgow. He left Queen's Park Collegiate School in 1875 to start an apprenticeship with James Munro, the Glasgow architect, later becoming Munro's chief assistant.<br>
<br>In 1883 McKellar set up his own architectural practice. He soon began to employ contractors himself to build tenements to his own design, many of which he kept as an investment and source of income, and by 1896 he had built eighty-nine, mainly in Crossmyloof in south Glasgow, and in Kelvindale and Maryhill in the north-west of the city. He also designed churches, including the Hood Memorial Church in east Glasgow, a Congregational church.<br>
<br>By 1896 McKellar had expanded enough to form a limited liability company, with capital of &pound;40,000, increased in 1899 to &pound;100,000. He was chairman of the new company, and kept his architectural practice, John C. McKellar, separate. The new company gradually sold off the older properties, while building new ones for rent and sale, mainly in Kelvindale, and buying up land for development. It also bought tenements in Troon, a seaside resort on the west coast, and began to acquire office buildings, such as Gresham House in Glasgow, bought for &pound;24,000 in 1903. It continued to build tenements, including, in 1906, a block near where the new Yarrow shipyard was to be built. Between 1900 and 1906 nearly a hundred tenements were built.<br>
<br>McKellar was badly hit by Lloyd George's &#145;people's budget&#146; and the <span class="roman">Finance Act</span> of 1909, which imposed heavy duties on builders' profits. In 1906 the company had embarked on building a development of small houses for sale on the Hillington Park estate to the south-west of Glasgow city centre, building thirty in the first stage, hoping to attract buyers by widespread advertising and instalment-plan buying schemes, but the houses proved difficult to sell, as owner-occupation was rare in Glasgow, and company profits fell from &pound;2449 in 1909 to &pound;266 in 1910. Eventually, the rest of the Hillington land was sold to Glasgow corporation, and the plan was abandoned. With the introduction of rent restriction during the First World War income from rents fell, and the company moved much of its capital out of property and into other forms of investment.<br>
<br>McKellar was a Conservative, opposed to government and municipal intervention in the housing market. He gave evidence to the royal commission on housing in Scotland in 1913, arguing against government subsidies for local authority building, which enabled local councils to let houses at uneconomic rents, thereby hitting private builders and landlords. In his speech at the company's annual general meeting in 1934 he attacked &#145;the Hitlerite rule of unreasonable and unfair Socialists and Communists, who aim at the confiscation and theft of property that cannot be removed out of their reach&#146;  (<span class="italic">DSBB</span>, 2.153). Unlike some of his competitors, who managed very successfully to combine working on local authority contracts with private house building, McKellar failed to appreciate the direction in which the construction industry was moving.<br>
<br>McKellar remained managing director of John C. McKellar Ltd until shortly before his death on 27 March 1941, in Glasgow. He had been married to Jessie Nisbet (<i>d</i>. 1925), daughter of the Revd Robert Hood of Muslin Street, Glasgow, and had one son. His leisure time was taken up with sailing and golf.<br>
