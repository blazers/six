<span class="headword">Vaughan,  John</span>, first earl of Carbery  (1574/5&#150;1634), <span class="occ">courtier and politician</span>, was the eldest son of Walter Vaughan (<i>d</i>. 1598) of Golden Grove, Llanfihangel Aberbythych, Carmarthenshire, and Mary (<i>d</i>. before 1588), daughter of Sir Walter Rice of Newton, Carmarthenshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28151/', "Sir William Vaughan (c.1575&#150;1641)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28128/', "Sir Henry Vaughan (1587?&#150;1660/61)")</script> were his brothers. He matriculated, aged seventeen, from Jesus College, Oxford, on 4 February 1592, and entered the Inner Temple in 1596. His early career was influenced by his ties with Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex, whom his father also followed. The earl described Vaughan as his &#145;servant&#146; in 1598; on 13 February that year Vaughan married Margaret, daughter of Sir Gelly Meyrick, Essex's steward and man of business in Wales  (TNA: PRO, C115/100/7409). This marriage ended by 1614 after producing two sons, the elder of whom was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28140/', "Richard Vaughan, second earl")</script>, and he then married Jane Meredith (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Palmer). Vaughan followed Essex on his expedition to Ireland in 1599, when the earl knighted him. These ties caused suspicion to fall on Vaughan after the Essex revolt of 1601, and he felt the need to demonstrate his innocence to Sir Robert Cecil after reports circulated of his complicity in the plot. Vaughan was also removed from the commission of the peace in Carmarthenshire for a time while his political loyalties were in question. It was possibly with a view to defending his reputation that he represented Carmarthenshire in the parliament of 1601.<br>
<br>Vaughan's campaign to clear his name was successful, and was probably aided by the accession of a new monarch in 1603. For a period he busied himself with local office and consolidated his position in Carmarthenshire, until he initiated a campaign to secure a post in the prospective household of Prince Charles. In 1614 he approached the king's favourite, the earl of Somerset, asking him to intercede with James I on his behalf, and also wrote to Sir Henry Neville requesting to be &#145;sworn in the place I have desired&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 14/78/64). His efforts were rewarded with the profitable position of comptroller when Prince Charles's household was created in 1616. Vaughan now acquired a house in Fulham, where he sheltered Sir Francis Bacon after his impeachment in the 1621 parliament. Vaughan also sat in this assembly, again representing Carmarthenshire. It was during the parliamentary recess that King James elevated him to an Irish barony, as baron of Mullingar, and this caused Vaughan some difficulties when parliament reconvened in November, as some members questioned whether his title disqualified him from sitting in the Commons. This probably helps explain why he never again sought election to parliament.<br>
<br>Vaughan's position in the prince's household meant he was one of the servants who followed Charles into Spain in 1623 when he left to expedite his marriage to the infanta. The trip caused him some difficulties, however, with reports entering England that he had become a Catholic, while he later recalled that the expedition had cost him between &pound;3000 and &pound;4000.<br>
<br>Charles's accession in 1625, rather than furthering Vaughan's career at court, actually occasioned its cessation. He was removed as comptroller, and although he was reported to be in line for some monetary reimbursement, no further court appointment was forthcoming. In 1628 he approached Sir John Coke requesting compensation for his losses on the Spanish trip, and estimated that his time in service had cost him &pound;20,000. Nevertheless, this did not stop him addressing the duke of Buckingham with a request that he &#145;work my re-establishing into my precedent place&#146;, but his entreaties were to no avail  (TNA: PRO, SP 16/86/16). His elevation to an Irish earldom in 1628, when he was created earl of Carbery, may have been some form of compensation, but, like many others, he may simply have paid for the honour. He lived out the rest of his life at Golden Grove where he made a nuncupative will on 29 April 1634, bequeathing his estates to his only surviving son and heir, Richard, the future royalist lieutenant-general. Vaughan died at Golden Grove on 6 May 1634 and was buried in the family vault in the parish church of Llandeilo Fawr, Carmarthenshire.<br>
