</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Finniston, Sir  (Harold) Montague <span class="st"> [Monty]</span></span>  (1912&#150;1991), <span class="occ">metallurgist and businessman</span>, was born at 26 Aikenhead Road, Govanhill, Glasgow, on 15 August 1912, the eldest child in the family of two sons and three daughters of Robert Finniston and his wife, Esther, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Diamond. Both parents were Russian-Jewish immigrants; the original family name was Feinstein. Monty, as he was universally known, became one of the outstanding industrial technologists of his generation, and arguably of the twentieth century. He was remarkable in numerous ways, not least for having risen from near-poverty conditions in the slums of Glasgow before the First World War to become a key figure in Britain's development of the atom bomb and subsequently the peaceful development of nuclear energy in the 1950s and thereafter. His later achievements, first as deputy chairman and chief executive and then as chairman of the nationalized British Steel Corporation, led to a belated drive to modernize the steel industry and, perhaps inevitably, to a fierce battle with ministers in Harold Wilson's Labour government of the 1970s, which was to force him out of British Steel.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Finniston's father was a tailor's machinist and then a struggling salesman; his mother was an archetypal Jewish home-loving mother trying to make ends meet in threadbare circumstances, devoted to her small family. Home was in rough, tough Govanhill, in a grey, sandstone tenement three storeys high, with three &#145;apartments&#146; on each landing. The apartments consisted of one room and a kitchen, and there was one communal lavatory per landing. There was no electricity&#151;only gaslight&#151;and heating was by a coal fire. At that time Glasgow had the highest rate of tuberculosis in Europe. Survival was often by sheer luck, chance, or brutal scheming.<br>
<br>Finniston was educated locally at Victoria School until he was eleven. By that time his father's situation had improved slightly and the family had moved to a larger apartment in Glasgow's Crosshill&#151;with three rooms, kitchen and bathroom, and with electric light. It was while Finniston was living here that he won a scholarship to the prestigious Allan Glen's School, which specialized in science. He became a star scholar, which enabled him to overcome a serious problem: to qualify for university entrance it was necessary to spend six years at Allan Glen's School, but Finniston's scholarship was due to terminate after five years and his family couldn't afford to finance a sixth year. The brilliant young Finniston overcame this handicap by qualifying for Glasgow University at the unusually early age of sixteen.<br>
<br>From his arrival at Glasgow University it was clear that this exceptional young man, consistently top in all his exams, was destined for a considerable career. Originally Finniston was drawn to medicine, but was saved for technology because of his squeamishness at the sight of blood. He graduated in metallurgical chemistry and then went on to take a PhD on the combustibility of coke at the Royal College of Science and Technology, Glasgow, where he was subsequently a lecturer from 1933 to 1935. By one of those curious quirks of circumstance Finniston helped to tutor another young metallurgist, Ian MacGregor, who later became Margaret Thatcher's appointee as chairman of British Steel two stages after Finniston. After his lectureship Finniston then took a post as a metallurgist with the steelmakers Stewarts and Lloyds (1935&#150;7). This was his first direct association with the steel industry, and it was the job he was holding when on 15 April 1936 he married his childhood friend Miriam Singer (<i>b</i>. 1914/15), daughter of Morris Singer, tailor. They had a son, Michael, and a daughter, Barbara.<br>
<br>After Stewarts and Lloyds, Finniston was chief research officer at the Scottish Coke Committee (1937&#150;40). He then joined the Royal Naval Scientific Service (RNSS) as a metallurgist, a post he held for six years. This appointment marked his move away from Glasgow, initially to Sheffield, where the RNSS had an important base. Finniston started with research on the quality and design of naval guns before specializing in bomb-casing design and torpedo development.<br>
<br>Finniston's work and inventiveness brought him to the notice of Whitehall's senior scientists and he was seconded to the Ministry of Supply, the department responsible for the development of nuclear weapons. Shortly after the end of the war he was sent with a team of British scientists to the top secret nuclear project at Chalk River in Canada to work on applying nuclear power to submarine propulsion. Much of his work was connected with the metallurgical substance and design of atomic weaponry, and he was drawn into the highly secret team of scientists and engineers who were working on &#145;the bomb&#146; in co-operation with the Americans and Canadians. It was while working at Chalk River (where he remained until 1947) that Finniston established a close personal friendship with the top-ranking American admiral who was in charge of that particular aspect of the United States' nuclear programme, Hyman Rickover. At their first meeting the American admiral asked Finniston: &#145;What do you know about atomic energy, Monty?&#146; Finniston paused and replied, &#145;Very little, sir.&#146; &#145;Then, why the hell are you wasting my time; you'd better get the hell out of here when you've finished your coffee&#146;, Rickover retorted. Yet that first meeting went on for several hours, with the American admiral becoming increasingly fascinated by his unusual Scottish visitor  (private information). In later years Rickover was a frequent visitor to Britain's nuclear headquarters at Harwell, where he would attend crucial meetings with his British counterparts&#151;always insisting that his friend Monty Finniston must be available to be with him.<h2>
<a name="Harwell"></a>Harwell</h2>Finniston was appointed chief metallurgist of the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) at Harwell on his return from Canada and for ten years from 1948 he developed a reputation which might well have carried him to the top of the Harwell establishment in succession to Sir John Cockcroft, had it not been for internal rivalries and, perhaps, petty jealousies. Finniston was never a self-seeker nor one to spend his time dabbling in internal power-politics. His commitment to his work&#151;and to his family&#151;was total. He openly (perhaps too openly) demonstrated his impatience with any semblance of cronyism. For him the focus of a rational and effective work pattern was to build a mutually co-operating team. At Harwell he recruited and led a young team of research scientists drawn from a wide range of backgrounds. None had any prior experience of nuclear power, let alone of the new materials that were just emerging, such as uranium, plutonium, zirconium, and beryllium. These new metals and alloys were crucial to the atomic energy programme, but their behaviour in response to the intense radiation inside the nuclear reactor was unpredictable, dangerous, and, as was discovered, dramatic. Finniston provided exceptional qualities of leadership and encouragement to his young and inexperienced team. His enthusiasm and commitment were contagious, and the team worked under great pressure on very tight time schedules.<br>
<br>Finniston's metallurgy division at Harwell was responsible for producing the fuel elements for the various reactor designs, and, as was inevitable with such primary, and sometimes experimental, work, many problems emerged&#151;especially in connection with the protective metallic canning of uranium. Finniston's team was working at what were then the scientific and technological frontiers in the development of atomic energy. Sir Alan Cottrell, Finniston's deputy at Harwell, described that period as a tremendous struggle during which Finniston fought &#145;against a lot of prejudice&#146;. In particular there were two great battles:<blockquote>First within Harwell where the ruling elite, in those far distant days, were the nuclear physicists who thought that everything else, especially materials work, was mere blacksmithing to provide them with their required hardware. Secondly, with the Northern AEA Group [Risley, Culcheth, Springfields, and Windscale] who thought that all materials technology belonged to them. [Finniston] fought and won these battles. (Petch, 135)</blockquote>During his decade at Harwell, Finniston worked with some of the most notable scientists and physicists of the post-war period, including two men who later defected to the Soviet Union&#151;Dr Klaus Fuchs and Dr Bruno Pontecorvo, who no doubt took with them secret data of innovations and discoveries that had been researched by the remarkable Finniston team. Details now available of what Fuchs told the Soviets indicate quite clearly that the materials involved in making the bomb included substances on which Finniston had researched.<br>
<br>Finniston never placed barriers in the way of his warmth and friendship, and his availability to help any of his Harwell colleagues. He knew practically everyone at Harwell. He and his family lived in a house within the Harwell settlement, where they were on familiar terms with all their neighbours and fellow workers. It was very much an integrated as well as a closed community. Finniston was a workaholic and an insomniac, getting up at 5 a.m. and working all day, often seven days a week. Neighbours from Harwell days recalled him even at weekends padding around the garden in his slippers and suddenly crying out: &#145;I've got an idea&#146;, and then disappearing in a puff of enthusiasm to his desk or workbench  (private information). His overall lifestyle was rigorous without being austere. He appreciated an occasional glass of wine and a good meal, but there was nothing lavish about his personal demands. &#145;I like a simple steak or some chicken&#146; he would declare, and he almost always stuck to that regime. He kept himself fit, and his slight, trim physique hardly ever changed over the years. His whole personal bearing radiated energy, but never in a demonstrative manner. Nor was this the window dressing of false modesty. He possessed a deep, philosophical humility, a characteristic quality of truly outstanding ability.<br>
<br>Ideas flowed from Finniston's fertile mind in surges. One extraordinary notion he conceived while at Harwell was as a member of a highly confidential committee (even by Harwell standards) that was later labelled the &#145;crazy committee&#146;. It was the job of this group of scientists and technologists to think the unthinkable. One special question came on to the agenda: what to do with nuclear waste? This was during the earliest days of nuclear energy development, when the critical issue was safety in production rather than the eventual disposal of the deadly waste material. Finniston came up with the idea of packing the waste into specially designed rockets and sending it into space. The idea was never pursued, which was perhaps as well in the light of subsequent invasions into space.<br>
<br>Finniston was also the first scientist at Harwell to process raw plutonium. Through his American contacts he persuaded a leading American nuclear scientist to bring over a small sample of plutonium (no bigger than the size of a pea, according to one eye witness) which Finniston and his team then worked on and refined into uranium. When Finniston left Harwell in 1958 he confessed that he left with a heavy heart; later he said that his Harwell days had been &#145;the happiest of my working life&#146;  (private information).<h2>
<a name="Internationalresearchanddevelopment"></a>International research and development</h2>In 1959 Finniston moved into private industry, becoming technical director at C. A. Parsons in Newcastle upon Tyne. There he took charge of a large new laboratory that Parsons had built to serve as the nuclear research centre for Parsons and other member firms of the Nuclear Power Plant Company&#151;one of five consortia set up to design and build Britain's first civil nuclear power stations. In 1962 he persuaded the Parsons' board to convert the whole research operation into the International Research and Development Company (IRD), which carried the entire enterprise beyond nuclear specialization towards a much broader concept of engineering and technological development. Finniston had for long recognized the untapped potential in Britain for technological research and development. He saw how the UK was missing out compared with the United States, Japan, and Germany, and he was a pioneer in trying to steer both government and private industry into the new world of technological advance. He served as managing director of IRD from 1962 to 1967, and then as chairman from 1968 to 1977.<h2>
<a name="TheBritishSteelCorporation"></a>The British Steel Corporation</h2>It was while Finniston was still running IRD in 1966 that the Labour government under Harold Wilson invited Finniston to join a committee planning the renationalization of the steel industry (which had been nationalized in 1949 but denationalized in 1953). The committee was the forerunner of the British Steel Corporation (BSC), formed in 1967 with Lord Melchett as chairman and Finniston as a deputy chairman in charge of technical and research development. He became BSC's chief executive in 1971 and then chairman in 1973 on Melchett's death, at which point he was projected onto the national platform, a &#145;public&#146; figure&#151;something that he always found it hard to get used to.<br>
<br>Well before he took over Melchett's vacant chair Finniston had been actively involved in trying to modernize the British steel industry and to bring it up to the standard of the world's outstanding steel performer, Japan. As chief executive of British Steel he took a team of experts there to study the exceptional achievements of the Japanese steel groups. He returned from Tokyo convinced that British Steel must adopt substantial elements of the Japanese system of integrated production, based on fewer but larger plants. The productivity gap between British and Japanese steel plants was huge: the blast furnace output index (output of tons per manshift per hour) for British steel production in 1969&#150;70&#151;when Finniston took his team to Japan&#151;was 64, while in Japan it was 148, with an average of 104 for all industrialized countries.<br>
<br>The British steel industry's problems were immense. It was old fashioned, often run down, and there was under-investment. Thirty-nine separate private steel companies produced a mere 14 million tons a year&#151;not only well below the output of competitor countries but far below accepted international levels of efficiency. Stripped of ideological questions, the nationalization of steel seemed a logical process. The planning committee, prior to nationalization, had concluded that British Steel, reorganized and modernized, could reach a target of 35 million tons a year by the end of a ten-year period.<br>
<br>When the Conservative Party won the 1970 election Edward Heath was committed to de-nationalizing steel, but he was persuaded by the secretary of trade and industry, Peter Walker, to keep most of the industry in public ownership and to give British Steel the opportunity and the finance to start a massive reorganization scheme. The plan that emerged from these negotiations was very much the responsibility of Finniston&#151;though everyone concerned, in both politics and industry, was convinced that there was no serious option. The plan involved a major reduction in the industry's workforce, then some 220,000, which inevitably brought Finniston into conflict with the steel unions. This was a new challenge for Finniston, but he handled it with great care and skill. Bill Sirs, general secretary of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, whose members suffered the largest cuts, later paid a considerable tribute to Finniston: &#145;Monty had that touch of human understanding. He was a good man who won my respect in difficult times&#146;  (Petch, 138). He also won the respect of Sirs's predecessor, Sir Dai Davies. Finniston himself found the task of cutting back on numbers a very hard task. He publicly declared: &#145;Whenever I lay men off, I see faces&#146;  (Petch, 138). He regarded the whole question of redundancy in the steel plants as a BSC responsibility and not one that should be left to the government. So he created BSC (Industry) in 1975, which was designed to help retrain redundant steel workers and to find them alternative jobs in new industries which Finniston encouraged to come into the areas of steel closures. It was a policy that had particular success in south Wales.<br>
<br>Politically, however, Finniston did less well. There was friction with ministers about steel modernization and reorganization and the government set up the Beswick committee, whose report proposed keeping old steel plants in existence despite the financial burden. Finniston clashed with ministers over the Beswick report and especially with Tony Benn, who became secretary of state for industry in the Wilson government of 1974. Finniston had already been blamed for overestimating the steel industry's potential market and pushing ahead too enthusiastically with modernization. But this was an unfair and jaundiced criticism since the whole concept of a larger, more efficient steel industry was a well-established requirement agreed by all parties as an economic essential for the UK from the mid-1960s onwards. Finniston nevertheless took the blame for what was later described as &#145;over-ambitious over-expansion&#146;. Moreover, the long delays in getting new equipment into steel plants aggravated the problem. By the time the industry was better equipped to compete with countries such as Japan, a world recession, induced by the 1973&#150;5 oil crisis, had transformed the scene.<br>
<br>The British steel industry was in the process of being turned round in a spectacular way when the recession hit. For the first four years of nationalization from 1967 the industry made losses, but then it began to make small profits&#151;&pound;78 million in 1974&#150;5. Steel prices were tightly controlled by the government&#151;a hidden subsidy to the rest of industry. If European prices had operated, as later they had to, BSC's profits would have been ten times that. But Finniston took the blame for the industry's record, and his refusal to accept political interference led to his downfall. When in 1976 the government came to consider extending his term of office he was rejected, especially by Tony Benn, as being out of sympathy with the government. It was an absurd judgement, but it was accepted by Harold Wilson, albeit with reluctance.<h2>
<a name="Privateindustryandpublicservice"></a>Private industry and public service</h2>Finniston was sixty-four when he left BSC. It is interesting to speculate that if the question of renewing his appointment had been delayed until James Callaghan was ensconced in no. 10 the outcome might well have been different. Such speculation is strengthened by the fact that one year after his departure from British Steel Finniston was appointed as chairman of a government enquiry into the engineering profession and its future&#151;a Callaghan appointment. Finniston's report, published in 1980, offered a major blueprint for the future of British industry, not just for the engineering profession. It argued: &#145;The regeneration of UK manufacturing competitiveness must be given over-riding priority in national policies with the emphasis on developing market-orientated engineering excellence&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 5 Feb 1991). Finniston hoped that the report would persuade the government&#151;Mrs Thatcher had just been elected&#151;into changing its attitude toward manufacturing industry, but it didn't. Although an engineering council was established, the government turned down Finniston's key proposal, which was to establish a statutory engineering authority with wide powers to train a new generation of engineers and to ensure the highest standards of qualifications through a properly registered professional body with its own code of professional practice. Nevertheless the report represented an important watershed for engineering and in particular led to a basic change in attitudes to women engineers, since Finniston recommended sweeping changes to help the admission of women into the engineering profession.<br>
<br>Finniston was actively involved in innumerable organizations throughout the 1980s. He was chancellor of Stirling University from 1978 until 1988, pro-chancellor of the University of Surrey from 1978 until 1985, and a member of the council of King's College, London, from 1985 until 1990. He received honorary doctorates from his old universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde and from a dozen others. He was chairman of the council of the Scottish Universities Business School (1976&#150;87); president of Carmel College (1980&#150;82); council member of the Weizmann Institute and of the New London Synagogue; and he was associated in various ways with Lancaster University, Cranfield Institute of Technology, Corby City Technology College, and Waltham Forest College. He was chairman of the Open University's appeal committee (helping to raise &pound;3 million for the university), and was also instrumental in encouraging Sir Isaac Wolfson to make the first of his donations to Oxford University, which culminated in the founding of Wolfson College, Oxford. He was chairman of the Policy Studies Institute from 1975 to 1984.<br>
<br>At various times in the 1980s Finniston was chairman or director of more than a dozen companies and indeed started his own, H. M. Finniston Ltd, in 1980. None of this deflected his time and attention from active work for a number of charities. He was founding chairman of the Prison Reform Trust (1981&#150;8) and did a great deal of work to raise funds for the trust as well as visiting, and lecturing in, prisons. He was also chairman of the Amnesia Association and president of the Stress Syndrome Foundation.<br>
<br>Finniston was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1969 (vice-president, 1971&#150;2), a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1978, and a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1983. He was knighted in 1975. He died at 27 Circus Road, Westminster, London, on 2 February 1991, following a severe heart attack. He was survived by his wife and two children. A memorial service was held at the New London Synagogue on 7 May 1991.<br>
