<span class="headword">Rainy,  Harry</span>  (1792&#150;1876), <span class="occ">expert in forensic medicine</span>, was born at Creich, Sutherland, on 20 October 1792, the youngest son of George Rainy (<i>d</i>. 1810), minister of Creich, and his wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1833), daughter of the Revd Gilbert Robertson of Kincardine. Rainy matriculated at Glasgow University in 1806 and began medical studies there in 1808. In 1810 he transferred to the Edinburgh medical school, where he studied for a further two years. After a two-year stint as clerk to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, he spent a year in Paris, from 1814 to 1815, to gain further experience in various hospitals. Rainy's stay in Paris brought him into contact with the great French medical and surgical figures of the day such as Dupuytren, Orfila, and Roux, and he also became interested in ophthalmology. Rainy witnessed the famous &#145;hundred days&#146; of Napoleon, and on his return journey to Glasgow in 1815 via Germany and Belgium he crossed the field of Waterloo, shortly before the fateful battle.<br>
<br>Rainy's interest in eye surgery remained after his return to Glasgow and in 1824 he helped his friend William Mackenzie to open the city's first eye hospital. Rainy was directed at this point towards general practice, which provided a bedrock for his future finances. He married Barbara (<i>d</i>. 1854), daughter of Captain Robert Gordon of Invercharron, on 30 November 1818, the marriage ceremony being performed by Dr Thomas Chalmers. Their eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35654/', "Robert Rainy (1826&#150;1906)")</script>, became principal of the New College, Edinburgh. Their second son, George (1832&#150;1869), was surgeon to the Glasgow Eye Infirmary, and lecturer at the university in 1868.<br>
<br>In 1832 Rainy obtained a substitute university lectureship on the theory of physic, on behalf of the absent valetudinarian professor of the institutes of medicine, Charles Badham, who resided in the south of France. Badham retained his professorial stipend and took one quarter of the student fees, Rainy taking the remaining three-quarters. Rainy taught well from 1832 to 1839, but from 1839 to 1841 his politics and religious allegiance went against him: he was an ardent tory and a keen supporter of the Free Church of Scotland before and during the Disruption of 1843. In 1839 his subject was split by the whig government, which created a new regius chair for the theory of medicine. The chair went to a prominent whig, Andrew Buchanan.<br>
<br>At the same time, the government also instituted the first regius chair of medical jurisprudence and forensic medicine in the University of Glasgow, created for another staunch whig, Robert Cowan. Disappointed, Rainy then lectured on Badham's other string, the practice of medicine, until Badham retired entirely from the chair in 1840. Rainy was the university's choice for the vacant chair and had strong support, but he was deliberately excluded. The lord advocate appointed the whig William Thomson, son of the Edinburgh professor of pathology. The whig government fell in August 1841 and in October, after a long period of illness, Robert Cowan died. On Cowan's death, the university senate applied to Sir Robert Peel on behalf of Rainy. He was appointed within the month, aged almost fifty, as the second Glasgow professor of medical jurisprudence and forensic police.<br>
<br>Rainy was the last overt political appointment to a Scottish regius chair of public health and forensic medicine. Although by 1841 he was a man of wide experience, he was not a medical jurist cast in the mould of Robert Christison. Rainy's tall, erect figure and fine features rarely graced the witness box mainly because, according to a contemporary, &#145;he was not only cross looking, but was easily made cross. This was an unfortunate trait in a professor of medical jurisprudence &hellip; Counsel quickly discovered that they could make little of him&#146;  (Anderson, 8&#150;9). Nevertheless, Rainy was a good teacher and an able chemist. In the first instance he took Christison's line and dropped Cowan's medical police (public health) string from lectures, and he styled himself professor of forensic medicine. Considering that the impetus for the chair's origins lay in Cowan's dedication to improving public health (Cowan styled himself professor of medical police), Rainy's decision was unfortunate for Glasgow and the west of Scotland, which was struggling with the worst excesses of industrialization. Medical students wishing to study public health subjects turned either to Glasgow's extramural schools or to Edinburgh.<br>
<br>Rainy taught forensic medicine to medical students and medical jurisprudence to law students. His lectures, which were delivered without notes, indicate the widening concerns of forensic medicine, and despite a well-recorded cold and forbidding demeanour he was held in warm and high regard. His main medical research contributions lay in toxicology, notably the study of arsenic, and the cooling time of dead bodies. The latter subject, undertaken in collaboration with Joseph Coates, then lecturer in pathology, resulted in a formula known as &#145;Rainy's curve&#146;, which provided a useful rule of thumb for this still inexact corner of medical science.<br>
<br>Rainy retired from the chair in 1862. The university bestowed on him the degree of LLD in 1876 on the installation of Disraeli as rector of the university. Rainy died in Glasgow on 6 August 1876.<br>
