<span class="headword">Adams,  William</span>  (1823&#150;1904), <span class="occ">engineer</span>, was born in Limehouse, London, on 15 October 1823, the second son and third child in the family of three sons and two daughters of John Samuel Adams, clerk of works to the East India Dock Company, and his wife, Jean Walker. He was educated privately in Margate.<br>
<br>In 1841 Adams was apprenticed as a machinery fitter with Miller and Ravenhill, shipbuilders at Orchard Wharf, Blackwall, London. In 1846 he joined the firm of Charles Blacker Vignoles (1793&#150;1875) as a draughtsman and, two years later, Philip Taylor, shipbuilder, in Marseilles and Genoa, working as a marine engineer there and in ships of the Royal Sardinian Navy. Adams married Isabella, daughter of Charles Park, mechanical engineer, at Genoa in 1852. They had seven sons and three daughters.<br>
<br>Adams returned to Britain later in 1852 and planned the North London Railway's Bow locomotive and carriage works, becoming locomotive and carriage superintendent in 1854. To deal with its rapidly increasing commuter traffic, in 1855 Adams introduced new high-capacity suburban trains with continuous brakes, probably the first in Britain. He was also first to use coal gas for train lighting in 1862. New passenger locomotives of greater power, of 4&#150;4&#150;0 tank type, from 1865 embodied his patent two-axle guiding bogie with lateral movement controlled by springs. This greatly improved their smoothness of travel over curves and allowed higher speeds without risk of derailment. It was one of the major developments in locomotive design and was adopted worldwide.<br>
<br>In 1873 Adams took up a similar appointment with the Great Eastern Railway. He modernized their Stratford works, using largely American labour-saving machines and equipment which, in many cases, enabled process costs to be reduced five- to tenfold. In 1878 he pioneered the introduction of 2&#150;6&#150;0 type freight locomotives in Britain and, as consultant to the London, Tilbury, and Southend Railway, 4&#150;4&#150;2 passenger tank locomotives, which were highly successful and were built in enlarged form over the next fifty years.<br>
<br>On becoming locomotive superintendent of the London and South Western Railway in 1878, Adams rapidly introduced urgently needed, more powerful, and reliable locomotives for passenger, suburban, and freight traffic, which were robust in construction and elegant in outline, especially the outside-cylindered 4&#150;4&#150;0 express type. A major development, patented by Adams and his nephew Henry in 1885, was the Vortex steam exhaust system which increased combustion efficiency and locomotive power. It was applied to over 500 locomotives in Britain, France, and Austria. Adams retired because of ill health in 1895.<br>
<br>Adams was a kindly man who took a keen interest in his staff and his fellow men. He was musically talented, with a fine bass voice like his father. While with the North London Railway he persuaded its directors to provide suitable accommodation for concerts and evening classes at the Bow and Bromley Institute. He was a member of the Institutions of Civil and Mechanical Engineers and a founder member of the Association of Railway Locomotive Engineers. Adams died on 7 August 1904 at Hillrise, Amersham Road, Putney, London.<br>
