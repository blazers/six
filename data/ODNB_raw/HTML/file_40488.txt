<span class="headword">Martin,  William</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1815), <span class="occ">typefounder</span>, was probably born in Birmingham, the son of a local printer whose family originally came from Scotland. It is likely that William began work at John Baskerville's type foundry at Easy Hill, Birmingham, where his brother, Robert, was Baskerville's foreman. In London from about 1787, Martin was employed by the bookseller and publisher George Nicol, in whose house on Pall Mall he developed his types for seven years before moving to his own foundry in Duke Street, St James's, Piccadilly.<br>
<br>During his time with Nicol, as well as after, when he worked principally for William Bulmer at the Shakspeare Press, Martin aimed to produce a type uniting &#145;utility, elegance and beauty&#146;  (preface to Bulmer's edition of <span class="italic">The Poems of Goldsmith and Parnell</span>, 1795) superior to that of rival British presses, and a competitor to continental designs. Martin and Nicol achieved their ambition with a type that confounded the experts in a hoax known as the Bodoni Hum in which connoisseurs mistook Bulmer's printing and Martin's types to be a product of the leading typefounder Bodoni. An integral contributor to the success of Bulmer's Shakspeare Press, Martin was rightfully acclaimed for his work on the magnificent volumes printed by John Boydell, among them <span class="italic">The Poetical Works of John Milton</span> (3 vols., 1794&#150;7), <span class="italic">An History of the River Thames</span> (2 vols., 1794&#150;6), and <span class="italic">The Dramatic Works of Shakespeare</span> (9 vols., completed 1802).<br>
<br>In their design Martin's types drew on Baskerville, but were influenced more significantly by Bodoni. He adapted to the transition from the old to the modern face, discarded the long &#145;s&#146;, and created his own individual style by ameliorating the rotundity of the old face and the angularity of the modern, thereby making the result more pleasing to the eye. His romans, which appeared in Thomas Frognall Dibdin's three works <span class="italic">Typographical Antiquities</span>, <span class="italic">Bibliotheca Spenceriana</span>, and <span class="italic">Bibliographical Decameron</span>, were admired for their clarity as were his italics, though these were criticized also for being too calligraphic. However, it was Martin's orientals and greeks that evidenced his outstanding talent. It was through his oriental face design that he gained the title &#145;oriental type founder and printer to the East India Company&#146; in 1803. Though widely praised, his greek characters, exhibited in Musaeus's <span class="italic">The Loves of Hero and Leander</span> (1797), none the less divide critics, who maintain either that his work makes the text easier to read or that the faces are &#145;cramped&#146;  (Reed, 326).<br>
<br>Aside from William Bulmer, John McCreery of Liverpool was probably the first publisher to use the Martin types, in his poem <span class="italic">The Press</span> (1803); they also appear in <span class="italic">A Specimen of the Improved Types of G. R. Harris</span> (1807). A &#145;man whose modesty was equal to his talents&#146; and one who would &#145;listen to every hint of improvement&#146;  (Nicol, 3), William Martin died in London in 1815. His foundry, which had been supported by the Shakspeare Press, was continued for a short time by William Bulmer, but was merged with that of Henry Caslon in 1817.<br>
