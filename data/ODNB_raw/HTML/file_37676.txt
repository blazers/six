<span class="headword">Liddell,  Eric Henry</span>  (1902&#150;1945), <span class="occ">missionary and athlete</span>, was born in Tientsin (Tianjin), China, on 16 January 1902, the second son in the family of two sons and a younger daughter of the Revd James Dunlop Liddell, a Congregational missionary from Drymen, Stirlingshire, and his wife, Mary Reddin, a trained nurse from Paxton in Berwickshire. His early childhood was spent at the mission station in the village of Siaokuan (Xiaoguan), southern Hebei. In 1907, at the age of five, he was brought back to Scotland, where he attended, first, the village school in Drymen, and, from 1908 to 1920, the School for the Sons of Missionaries in London (later Eltham College). At school both he and his elder brother (Robert Victor) excelled at sports; in 1919 Eric set a new (and still unbroken) school record of 10.2 seconds for the 100 yards. In 1920 he matriculated at Edinburgh University for a BSc degree in pure science. As a student he broke the Scottish records for the 100 and 200 yards, and set a new record for the inter-universities 440 yards (50.2 seconds). His electrifying speed earned him seven international rugby caps for Scotland as a wing three-quarter. He was selected to run in the 100 and 200 metres in the 1924 Olympics in Paris, but declined to run in the 100 metres on religious grounds, because the heats were to be run on a Sunday. He won the bronze medal in the 200 metres, and then had a spectacular and unexpected victory in the 400 metres to take the gold medal in a world record time of 47.6 seconds (10 July 1924).<br>
<br>Liddell graduated from Edinburgh University a few days later (17 July) and enrolled at the Scottish Congregational college in Edinburgh to read divinity for a year, for he had long since decided to devote his life to missionary work, like his parents. He spent the year immersed in student evangelical activities, speaking all over Scotland at weekends. In the summer of 1925 he took part in his last athletics meeting in Scotland, where he won the Scottish Amateur Athletic Association titles in the 100, 200, and 440 yards, before leaving to take up an appointment as a missionary teacher at the Anglo-Chinese College in Tientsin. He developed athletics at the college, and continued to run at meetings in China.<br>
<br>In 1931&#150;2 Liddell returned to Scotland on furlough in order to be ordained as a Congregational minister. In 1934 he married Florence, who had trained in Canada as a nurse, the twenty-one-year-old daughter of Hugh McKenzie, a Canadian missionary at Tientsin. They had three daughters, but he never saw his third daughter; she was born in Canada after the upheavals of the civil war and the Japanese invasion of China had persuaded Liddell to send his pregnant wife and young children to safety in 1941.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Liddell had been working as a field missionary in war-torn Siaokuan. He wrote <span class="italic">The Sermon on the Mount: for Sunday School Teachers</span> (1937), and back in Tientsin he worked on <span class="italic">A Manual of Christian Discipline</span>, to be translated into Chinese for the guidance of Chinese pastors, and published <span class="italic">Prayers for Daily Use</span> (1942). In 1943 he and his missionary colleagues were interned by the Japanese in a camp in Weihsien, Shantung. They were officially internees, rather than prisoners, and life, although monotonous and full of deprivation, was not brutal. Liddell was remembered by survivors for his modesty, his unfailing good humour, and his exemplary Christian conduct throughout their time there&#151;and despite his strict sabbatarian principles he even refereed hockey matches on Sundays, for the sake of the youngsters with little else to do. He died in Weihsien on 21 February 1945 of a brain tumour. The story of his athletic triumphs was retold in the film <span class="italic">Chariots of Fire</span> (1981).<br>
