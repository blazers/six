<span class="headword">Erskine, Sir  George, of Innerteil</span>, Lord Innerteil  (<em>c.</em>1567&#150;1646), <span class="occ">judge and supposed alchemist</span>, was the third son of Sir Alexander Erskine (<i>c</i>.1521&#150;1588&times;92) of Gogar, Stirlingshire, and Margaret Home (<i>d</i>. in or after 1586), daughter of George Home, fourth Lord Home; his eldest brother, Alexander, died in 1578, and his second brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8872/', "Thomas Erskine (1566&#150;1639)")</script>, was later created Viscount Fentoun and earl of Kellie. Sir Alexander had guardianship of James VI within Stirling Castle, and George, like Thomas, was educated with the young king and their cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8867/', "John Erskine (c.1562&#150;1634), later eighteenth or second earl of Mar")</script>, by George Buchanan and Peter Young. It is likely that Erskine then attended university, since in 1602 he was designated Master George Erskine of Boquhan, Stirlingshire, the title &#145;master&#146; suggesting that he was a graduate.<br>
<br>In the 1590s Erskine was opposed to the Catholic grouping surrounding George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly. By 1598 he was described by George Nicholson, an English representative in Scotland, not only as &#145;a gentleman of good account&#146; but also as &#145;the chief guider&#146; of Huntly's young political enemy, Archibald Campbell, seventh earl of Argyll  (<span class="italic">CSP Scottish</span>, 13/1.203&#150;4); writing to Robert Cecil in 1601 Nicholson stressed several times (and apparently approvingly) that Erskine had the power of veto over Argyll's decisions. Some time between 1602 and 1606 Erskine married Isobel Brown (<i>d</i>. 1640), widow of Patrick Murray of Gaynes; they had two surviving daughters, Anna or Anne and Margaret. By 2 August 1611 he had been knighted. A few months later he acquired the lands of Invertiel, Fife, which in 1618 were incorporated into the barony of Invertiel, known then as Innerteil.<br>
<br>In 1613 Erskine was a justice of the peace for the county of Fife. Four years later he was admitted as an ordinary lord of the court of session, in place of Sir James Wemyss of Bogie. There is no indication that he was qualified in law, and he does not appear in the list of advocates, but at that time it was not unusual for Scottish judges to have no formal legal education. Admitted as a privy councillor in 1618, he attended the council regularly and was appointed to several committees and commissions. His brother Viscount Fentoun, resident at court, did his best to ensure that Erskine remained in the king's favour.<br>
<br>Although Erskine's commitment to reformed protestantism persisted to the extent that in 1618 he disobeyed King James's order that churchgoers should kneel to receive communion, he maintained his connection with Argyll, who by this time was exhibiting increasing sympathy for Catholicism. Erskine had stood &#145;cautioner&#146; or guarantor for the earl in great sums of money, advanced to cover the latter's mounting debts. When, in the same year, Argyll fled to the continent and announced his formal conversion to Rome, Erskine was given the life-rent of the escheat or forfeiture of the earl's estate. He was also appointed justice-general, the chief criminal judge in Scotland&#151;an office previously held by the earls and now declared void. He remained an active privy councillor until 1626, when Charles I decreed that there should be no common membership of the council and the court of session, and remained a judge until his death. According to Lord Hailes he made a collection of decisions of the court of session, but these have not survived.<br>
<br>Erskine's wife's preference for Reformed protestantism continued into the 1630s, when she was among several women who gave financial support to the popular nonconforming preacher John Livingstone (1603&#150;1672). However, Erskine himself at first refused to sign the national covenant of 1638, changing his mind only with visible reluctance. Lady Innertiel died on 6 August 1640 in the parish of Kinghorn, Fife. In 1645 Erskine sold his lands to his daughters, reserving to himself the life-rent. They were living at his death in February or March 1646. Anna, who had married in October 1627 John Melville, third Lord Melville (<i>d</i>. 1643), was the mother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/18546/', "George Melville, fourth Lord Melville and later first earl of Melville")</script>. Margaret had married on 25 July 1629 Sir John Mackenzie (<i>d</i>. 1654) of Tarbat, with whom she acted as executor to her father in 1654; she married as her second husband in 1661 <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9987/', "Sir James Foulis (d. 1688)")</script> of Colinton.<br>
<br>In June 1707 Margaret's son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17580/', "George Mackenzie (1630&#150;1714), first earl of Cromarty")</script>, donated his grandfather's collection of alchemical and other manuscripts to the College of Physicians in Edinburgh. The earl's comments on that occasion served to establish Erskine's reputation as a notable alchemist. He was, said his grandson, &#145;a great student in the naturale philosophy, evn to considerable advancement in the Hermetic Schoole &amp; had a correspondence in very remote parts wt the sonnes of Hermes&#146;  (McCallum, 214). The agent of this, claimed Cromarty, was one Dr Politius, a Pole or Silesian acting for the Rosicrucians of Hesse. No letters from Politius or the Hessian group survive among Erskine's manuscripts, but the former has recently been tentatively identified as Dr Jodocus Pellitius (Polytius) of Hamburg, court physician to Duke Heinrich Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenb&uuml;ttel (1564&#150;1613), who had an important alchemical library and an interest in cabbalist literature, and whose wife was King James's sister-in-law. Whether and how Erskine made contact with these men remains a matter of conjecture, but even though his collection was clearly added to after his death, there seems little doubt that he accumulated a rich and important selection of alchemical manuscripts, some endorsed with his signature. While the conclusion of his 1870s biographer that he was &#145;one of Scotland's outstanding alchemists&#146;  (McCallum, 214) now looks premature, annotations in his hand testify to his close interest in some of those manuscripts.<br>
