<span class="headword">Bohun,  Edmund</span>  (1645&#150;1699), <span class="occ">writer and press licenser</span>, was born on 12 March 1645 at Ringsfield, Suffolk, the only son of Baxter Bohun (<i>bap</i>. 1616, <i>d</i>. 1658) and his wife, Margaret Lawrence (<i>d</i>. 1687). Edmund's father and grandfather, also Edmund, both died in 1658, leaving the thirteen-year-old boy the family's estates in Suffolk. On 11 February 1662 Edmund was admitted as a fellow-commoner to Queens' College, Cambridge, but he left in 1666 without a degree, apparently having been driven out by the plague. On 26 July 1669 he married Mary Brampton (<i>d</i>. 1719), and the following year they settled at Westhall Hall, near Halesworth. He became a Suffolk justice of the peace in 1675. From 1677 Bohun wrote a diary intermittently which charted his struggle with debts, deafness, and the damage wrought by his abrasive personality. In his first published work, <span class="italic">An Address to the Free-Men and Freeholders of the Nation</span>, which appeared in three parts in 1682&#150;3, he recalled that he had been &#145;bred a dissenter &hellip; and taught betimes to fear Monarchy&#146;, but as JP and writer he assailed religious diversity and disloyalty to <i>jure divino</i> kingship  (<span class="italic">Address</span>, 3). An adversary called him &#145;as furious a Prosecutor of Protestant Dissenters as was to be found in England&#146;, although John Dunton praised him for &#145;a wit so pregnant and prompt&#146; (Blount, 17; <span class="italic">Diary</span>, 100).<br>
<br>In 1684 Bohun moved with his wife to London, aiming to write to &#145;earn my bread&#146; and hoping for preferment from acquaintances including Archbishop William Sancroft  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 77). In 1684 he wrote <span class="italic">A Defence of Sir Robert Filmer</span> against Algernon Sidney's scaffold speech, and in 1685 he published and prefaced an edition of Filmer's <span class="italic">Patriarcha</span>, based on a manuscript supplied by Sancroft. In 1688 Bohun witnessed William of Orange's entry into London and argued against continued support for James II, with the result that &#145;by the end of February, I had not one friend left&#146;  (ibid., 83). His <span class="italic">History of the Desertion</span>, published in April 1689, provided one of the first narratives of the &#145;Stupendious Revolution&#146;  (p. 13), while the apparent volte-face on his part was discountenanced by <span class="italic">The doctrine of non-resistance or passive obedience no way concerned in the controversies now depending between the Williamites and the Jacobites</span> (1689). His acceptance of William alienated his Jacobite acquaintances but he was also a target for the whigs, both generally for his tory views and because of allegedly pro-James changes made without his knowledge to a second edition of his 1688 <span class="italic">Geographical Dictionary</span>.<br>
<br>Despite this unpopularity, in August 1692 Bohun was recommended for the post of licenser of the press by John Moore, bishop of Norwich, assisted by a manuscript defence he wrote of the 1662 <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span>. He took up the post on 7 September, at &pound;200 a year, and &#145;thought myself the happiest man alive&#146;  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 98). The happiness was short-lived. On 2 December he heard that his son Humphrey, the eldest of six children surviving childhood, had died at Cambridge  (ibid.). Then on 11 January 1693 Bohun licensed an anonymous tract attributed to Charles Blount, <span class="italic">King William and Queen Mary conquerors, or, A discourse endeavouring to prove that their majesties have, on their side against the late king, the principal reasons that make conquest a good title</span>. Bohun, who had used conquest arguments in his <span class="italic">History</span>, said he read the book &#145;with incredible satisfaction&#146;. However, when it was published a few days later, &#145;the title alone offended almost everybody&#146;  (ibid., 103). The Commons ordered Bohun's arrest, burnt the book, and declared that asserting William and Mary to be king and queen by conquest undermined their rightful title and the rights of the English people. On 28 January Bohun was removed from his post. The episode suggested the unworkability of the licensing system and within two years the <span class="roman">Licensing Act</span> lapsed, ending pre-publication censorship. A traditional view held that Bohun's endorsement of conquest theory was so singular that the book was a satire intended to trap him, but more recently Bohun's own claim that the subject had &#145;been treated of very often before&#146; has been largely confirmed  (ibid.). In the <span class="italic">History</span>, a manuscript account, and the <span class="italic">Diary</span> Bohun deployed a <i>jus gentium</i> argument derived from Grotius to insist that William's and Mary's title was not founded on <i>de facto</i> conquest &#145;but upon her majesty's hereditary title, brought into present possession by the vanquishing of King James in a just war, and his deserting the kingdom&#146;  (ibid., 119&#150;20). Bohun protested that his dismissal was based not only on a failure to read the book but to read the full title, which indicated that the conquest was of James, not of the nation.<br>
<br>Bohun saw the affair as a plot to remove him, evidenced by the publication by an &#145;outrageous whig&#146; of <span class="italic">The Just and True Character of Edmund Bohun</span>, appended to a tract against licensing  (<span class="italic">Diary</span>, 100). He returned to Suffolk but complained of being ejected as a JP &#145;by the republican party&#146;. In 1698 Bohun left England to become chief justice of South Carolina, where his son Edmund was a merchant. Letters indicate that he managed to antagonize several settlers before falling victim to a fever epidemic. He died on 5 October 1699. Bohun's eight-volume collection of printed and manuscript tracts and papers, covering 1675&#150;92, is in Cambridge University Library.<br>
