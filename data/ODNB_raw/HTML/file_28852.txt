<span class="headword">Watson,  Justly</span>  (<em>c.</em>1710&#150;1757), <span class="occ">military engineer</span>, was the son of Colonel <a name="cosubject_28849"></a><span class="headword">Jonas Watson</span>  (1663&#150;1741)<span class="occ"></span> and his wife, Miriam (<i>bap</i>. 1686, <i>d</i>. 1754), daughter of John and Anne West. Jonas Watson served for over fifty years in the artillery, and after distinguishing himself, first in the campaigns of William III in Ireland and Flanders, and then in those of Marlborough, succeeded to the command of the artillery train. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 17 March 1727, and commanded the artillery at the siege of Gibraltar in that year. He was killed at the siege of Cartagena on 30 March 1741. His widow was granted a pension of &pound;40 p.a. in acknowledgement of her husband's services.<br>
<br>Justly Watson entered the ordnance train as a cadet gunner about 1726 and served under his father at the siege of Gibraltar. He was appointed practitioner-engineer on 13 June 1732, and promoted sub-engineer on 1 November 1734. By then he had married, on 15 November 1733, Susan Curtis, at Pagham, Sussex. He received a commission as ensign in Harrison's foot on 3 February 1740 and in June was appointed to the ordnance train of the expedition to the West Indies. He sailed on 26 October and arrived at Jamaica on 9 January 1741. His father was killed at the subsequent siege of Cartagena, but he had made his will before he left England, and bequeathed Justly his books, maps, and &#145;instruments relating to the affairs of artillery&#146;. Justly Watson took part in the assault on Fort St Louis on 25 March and the assault on Fort Lazar on 9 April, and following this he was promoted lieutenant in Harrison's regiment of foot.<br>
<br>Watson returned to Jamaica on 19 May 1741, and was appointed engineer-extraordinary on 11 August, when he was serving in the expedition to Cuba. He returned again to Jamaica in November, and in March 1742 he joined in the abortive expedition to attack Panama. In September he was back in Jamaica as chief engineer. In 1743 he visited Darien and Florida to make surveys and reports. He returned to Jamaica and was promoted engineer in ordinary on 8 March 1744. He returned to England in the autumn of 1744, and was promoted captain-lieutenant in Harrison's regiment on 24 December 1745. On 30 April he joined the expedition under Admiral Richard Lestock and Lieutenant-General James St Clair originally intended for North America, but which attacked the coast of Brittany. He took part in the siege of Lorient (20&#150;27 September), the attack on Quiberon, and the capture of forts Houat and Heydie. Back in England again, he was promoted sub-director of engineers on 2 January 1748, and was appointed chief engineer in the Medway division which included Gravesend, Tilbury, Sheerness, Harwich, and Landguard.<br>
<br>Watson was promoted director of engineers on 17 December 1754, and was sent to Annapolis Royal as chief engineer of Nova Scotia and of settlements in Newfoundland. However, he was soon moved to serve on the west coast of Africa, arriving before December 1755. He returned to England in summer 1756, his reports on the military stations in Africa resulting in the House of Commons granting money to carry out his proposals for improved fortifications. After examining Rye harbour in October and November 1756 he was sent at the end of the year to Annapolis Royal to resume his duties in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. On 14 May 1757 he was commissioned lieutenant-colonel of Royal Engineers. He died at St John's, Newfoundland in the summer of 1757 from the effects of poison administered in his coffee, probably by a female servant. His will was proved by his widow on 4 August 1757, and she was granted a pension of &pound;40 p.a. from 1 January 1758. His daughter Miriam (<i>d</i>. 1782) married Watson's sometime assistant <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11407/', "Sir William Green (1725&#150;1811)")</script>. Several of his plans and surveys are in the British Library.<br>
