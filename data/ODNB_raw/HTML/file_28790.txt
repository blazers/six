<span class="headword">Warren, Sir  Samuel</span>  (1769&#150;1839), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was born at Sandwich, Kent, on 9 January 1769, entered the navy in January 1782 on board the <i>Sampson</i>, with his kinsman Captain John Harvey (1740&#150;1794), and was present at the relief of Gibraltar and the encounter with the allied fleet off Cape Spartel. Promoted lieutenant on 3 November 1790, he was appointed to the <i>Ramillies</i> in 1793 with Captain Henry Harvey, and was present at the battle of 1 June 1794. In 1795 he was in the <i>Royal George</i>, flagship of Lord Bridport, in the action off Lorient on 23 June. On 1 March 1797 he was promoted to command the sloop <i>Scourge</i> on the Leeward Islands station, where he made many rich prizes and captured several privateers. In August 1800 he brought the <i>Scourge</i> home. He married, on 27 October 1800, Sarah Moulden Burton, daughter of a clerk of the check at Chatham. They had seven children.<br>
<br>On 29 April 1802 Warren was advanced to post rank. In 1805 he commanded the <i>Glory</i> (98 guns) as flagship to Rear-Admiral Charles Stirling in the action off Cape Finisterre on 22 July. In 1806&#150;7 he was again with Stirling in the <i>Sampson</i> (64 guns) and in the <i>Diadem</i> (64 guns) during the operations in the Plate River; in 1809 he commanded the <i>Bellerophon</i> (74 guns), one of the squadron in the Baltic, with Sir James Saumarez. In September 1810 he was appointed to the frigate <i>President</i> (44 guns), captured from the French in 1806, and in her took part in the operations resulting in the capture of Java. On 4 June 1815 he was made a CB. After the peace he successively commanded the <i>Blenheim</i> and the <i>Bulwark</i> third rates, and the <i>Seringapatam</i> (46 guns); in the last he took the British ambassador to Sweden in the summer of 1823. In January 1830 he was appointed agent for transports at Deptford. On 3 August 1835 he was made KCH and was knighted by the king; on 10 January 1837 he attained the rank of rear-admiral, and he was made a KCB on 18 April 1839. He died at Southampton (where he was then living) on 15 October 1839.<br>
