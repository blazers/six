<span class="headword">Green,  John Alfred</span>  (1867&#150;1922), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born on 15 October 1867 in Langset Road, Nether Hallam, near Sheffield, one of the three sons of Walter Green, a grocer and provision dealer, and his wife, Sarah Jane Wild. He attended the elementary school near his home in Parson Cross and then Burton Street council school, where he became a pupil teacher; he went to evening classes at Firth College in Sheffield from 1882 until 1886. He gained further experience at the Borough Road Training College, was appointed a junior tutor there, and was awarded his BA degree in London.<br>
<br>In 1894 Green was appointed lecturer in education at the University College of North Wales, Bangor, and in 1900 he became professor. He was responsible for the day training department of the college, and helped to promote the training of secondary teachers and also that of kindergarten teachers. Outside Bangor he was involved in several educational organizations, including the British Association, and he studied the educational institutions of several continental countries, including Germany. He married Adeliza Norman Johnston, a colleague in the department and the daughter of a Manchester councillor; they had five sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1906 Green returned to his native Sheffield as professor of education at the newly constituted university with an annual salary of &pound;550. He was responsible for the training of secondary teachers and for instruction in advanced psychology and education, and took charge of the newly created department of education. He was awarded the MA degree by the university in 1908. Active in the administration of the new university, he served as dean of the faculty of arts from 1916 to 1919, and was prominent in helping to develop a close relationship between the university and its local community. Some regarded his best work as being in connection with the Sheffield Workers' Educational Association, in which he was a leading figure. In his public roles he was an engaging and direct speaker. From 1917 he was also a member of the Sheffield education committee, where he quickly gained a controversial reputation for his outspoken views as a champion of the principle of free secondary education for all. His other involvements included work with the Froebel Society, the Handwork Association, the Teachers' Registration Council, and the Training College Association. He was regarded as a moderate Liberal in his politics; he was not identified with any religious denomination.<br>
<br>Green's early research was in educational theory and history, especially the ideas of the continental educational reformer J. H. Pestalozzi. His interests turned increasingly to the new developments in educational psychology on the continent after the turn of the century. He became a prominent member of the British Psychological Society and was editor of the <span class="italic">Journal of Experimental Pedagogy</span> for many years. He was one of the earliest supporters in Britain of the Binet&#150;Simon scheme of psychological tests. His published work included a number of books on Pestalozzi, notably <span class="italic">The Educational Ideas of Pestalozzi</span> (1907), an edited collection <span class="italic">Pestalozzi's Educational Writings</span> (1912), and a <span class="italic">Life and Work of Pestalozzi</span> (1913); he also wrote on psychology and teaching practice (<span class="italic">An Introduction to Psychology: More Especially for Teachers</span>, with T. Loveday, 1912, and <span class="italic">A Primer of Teaching Practice</span>, with C. Birchenough, 1914). He was an outstanding teacher with a wide range of audiences and interests, and a strong administrator who helped to establish the study of education at the university level. He was a prominent figure in educational debates at the time of his sudden and early death, from appendicitis, at 64 Clarkegrove Road, Sheffield, on 12 March 1922. He was buried on 15 March at City Road cemetery, Sheffield. His widow, Adeliza Norman Green, became lecturer in education at University College, Southampton.<br>
