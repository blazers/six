<span class="headword">Rhys,  Ernest Percival</span>  (1859&#150;1946), <span class="occ">writer and literary editor</span>, was born in Islington, London, on 17 July 1859, second of the five children of John Rhys (<i>b</i>. 1839?), and his wife, Emma, daughter of Robert Percival, a breeder and doctor of horses, of Hockerill, Hertfordshire. John Rhys had been a divinity student who gave up his studies when he married at the age of eighteen, and he was working in a bookshop in London at the time of his son's birth; he later became a wine merchant. Ernest Rhys spent most of his childhood in Carmarthen and in Newcastle upon Tyne. After a home education and two years at Bishop's Stortford, 1866&#150;8, he went to a private school in Newcastle. But he refused to go to Oxford, &#145;tempted by the open-air life and the chance of horses to ride&#146; offered by mining engineering. He passed his examinations, but in January 1886 he returned to London to earn his living as a writer.<br>
<br>Establishing his base as the British Museum Reading Room, Rhys soon became a familiar figure in literary London. Although he never enjoyed popular success, and was too painstaking and slow a writer to earn a substantial income as a journalist, editors were always glad to have his reviews. He became close friends with W. B. Yeats, who shared his passion for eastern mysticism, Madame Blavatsky, and Celtic gossip. In February 1890 they founded the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/95480', "Rhymers' Club")</script>, a group of young poets, including Richard Le Gallienne, Lionel Johnson, Arthur Symons, and Ernest Dowson, who met in an upper room at the Cheshire Cheese, in Fleet Street, &#145;where long clay pipes lay in slim heaps on the wooden tables between tankards of ale&#146;, to recite their verses. The Rhymers published two collections of poetry (1892, 1894); Rhys contributed to both. His first solo volume, <span class="italic">A London Rose and other Poems</span> (1896), won the admiration of Robert Louis Stevenson, who wrote from Samoa urging him to &#145;cultivate your native potato&#146;. &#145;The Leaf Burners&#146;, written during the First World War, has been included in several anthologies; but his best poem is generally agreed to be the quatrain &#145;An Autobiography&#146;, with its opening line &#145;Wales England wed, so I was bred&#146;.<br>
<br>Writers are, however, often remembered by posterity for work by which they themselves set little store, and Rhys is remembered less as a poet than as the editor of <span class="roman">Everyman's Library</span>. Sponsored financially by J. M. Dent, this library was planned, in Rhys's words, as &#145;a collection of the great literatures, beginning with the English, so co-ordinated that if its readers began with one creative book, they would want another and another till the great public had the world literature within its grasp&#146;. Its title was taken from the medieval mystery play, and the quotation:<blockquote>
<div>Everyman, I will go with thee, and be thy guide,<br>
</div>
<div>In thy most need to go by thy side<br>
</div>
</blockquote>appears on every title-page. Beginning in 1906 with Boswell's life of Johnson, 153 volumes were published in the first twelve months; and when Rhys died, 983 volumes had appeared. In editing this library in face of many difficulties, some of which he has described in his autobiography <span class="italic">Everyman Remembers</span> (1931), Rhys performed a genuine service to literature. But he regarded this task as the necessary hack work which would buy him leisure in which to write poems and essays.<br>
<br>On 5 January 1891 Rhys married Grace (<i>d</i>. 1929), youngest daughter of a country squire, Bennett Little JP, of co. Roscommon, whom he met at a garden party given by Yeats. A lady of great charm and culture, Grace published, among other works, three volumes of <i>belles-lettres</i>. The couple worked and lived together as a team, and when Grace died on Rhys's lecture tour in 1929 in Washington, DC, he was devastated. They had one son and two daughters, and &#145;Sunday afternoon at the Rhys's&#146; was for many years an opportunity for poets, novelists, and critics to meet and discuss their problems. As his autobiography shows, Rhys was well acquainted with practically every important literary figure in his lifetime&#151;from Robert Browning to Dylan Thomas&#151;but was never too busy to provide kindness, encouragement, and help to the young and struggling. He was a much loved man. He died in a nursing home at 82 Inverness Terrace, Bayswater, London, on 25 May 1946, and was cremated at Golders Green.<br>
