<span class="headword">Wedgwood,  Thomas</span>  (1771&#150;1805), <span class="occ">chemist</span>, was born at Etruria Hall, Staffordshire, on 14 May 1771, the third and youngest surviving son of the potter <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28966/', "Josiah Wedgwood (1730&#150;1795)")</script> and his wife and cousin, Sarah Wedgwood (1734&#150;1815). Together with his brother Jos, Tom was sent to school in Bolton when six years old. He was a precocious child, but also a frail one. He was educated almost entirely at home. He spent a few terms at Edinburgh University between 1787 and 1789, and while there met the mathematician and natural philosopher John Leslie, whom he subsequently invited to Etruria to help in the laboratory and to teach him and his brother Josiah mathematics and natural philosophy.<br>
<br>Wedgwood's father had determined that &#145;Jos and Tom [would] be potters, and partners in trade. Tom to be the traveller and negotiator, and Jos the manufacturer&#146;  (Wedgwood, 74). For a very short while Tom worked energetically at the potteries. In April 1792, when almost twenty-one, he had a nervous breakdown, experiencing exhaustion, depression, severe headaches, and trouble with his eyesight. He gave up his philosophical (scientific) pursuits, and, on the advice of Erasmus Darwin, sought a change of scene. His father sent him to Paris to celebrate the third anniversary of the fall of the Bastille, from which he returned even more depressed. His health worsened, and in April 1793 he resigned his partnership in the firm. Subsequently a new partnership agreement was drawn up in which he and his brother Jos took more of the profits. He expected to take on responsibilities again when his health allowed. Meanwhile he took an interest in medical science, and helped to spread information about vaccination against smallpox.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1795 Wedgwood inherited a considerable fortune which enabled him to travel extensively in vain search of a cure, and also enabled him to contribute funds personally to literary, medical, and scientific men of genius. He went on a five-month walking tour in Germany, after which he awarded an annuity of &pound;150 to Leslie. He then consulted Erasmus Darwin's son Robert, who advised him to seek other medical opinion. As a result he moved to Bristol, where he consulted the radical physician Thomas Beddoes. In 1798 Beddoes opened his Pneumatic Institution, to which Wedgwood donated &pound;1000, writing that &#145;the attempt must be successful in part if it only goes to show that airs are not efficacious in medicine&#146;  (Litchfield, 35). He met the tanner Thomas Poole and, through him, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, to whom he gave a pension of &pound;75 a year. In 1797 Wedgwood went to Penzance for its mild climate and there renewed a friendship with Gregory Watt, son of James Watt. Through Watt he met Humphry Davy, who was soon to work in Beddoes's institution; Wedgwood took part in the trials and breathed nitrous oxide there.<br>
<br>Still vainly travelling in search of health Wedgwood went to the West Indies in 1800. Back in England he attended Davy's lectures at the Royal Institution, experienced a brief bout of health, and in Davy's laboratory resumed his experiments on &#145;silver pictures&#146;, which he published in 1802 as &#145;An account of a method of copying paintings upon glass, and of making profiles by the agency of light upon nitrate of silver, invented by T. Wedgwood, esq., with observations by H. Davy&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal of the Royal Institution</span>, 170&#150;74). He showed that a copy or a silhouette of any object could be obtained when its shadow was thrown on a piece of white paper or leather which had been moistened with a solution of silver nitrate. In a similar manner a silhouette of a picture painted on glass could be obtained by placing the glass in the light of the sun upon the sensitized surface. His goal was to obtain silver pictures of the image produced in a camera obscura, but he failed, since no effect could be obtained in any moderate time. Davy, however, found that he was successful in obtaining images of small objects projected by a solar microscope. But he could not fix the image. As Davy noted, &#145;nothing but a method of preventing the unshaded parts of the delineation from being coloured by exposure to the day, is wanting to render the process as useful as it is elegant&#146;  (Litchfield, 194). Thus Wedgwood had tackled the project of using the chemical action of light for making pictures&#151;that is, of photography&#151;but did not discover a practical photographic process.<br>
<br>Wedgwood's illness returned with severe depressions. He left London for a continental tour in May 1802 and returned to England in September in worse health. During the alarm of invasion by the French in 1803 and 1804 he equipped at his own expense a corps of volunteers raised in the country round Ullswater. He visited Coleridge and Wordsworth in the Lake District. Restless and ever moving, he died at Eastbury Park, Dorset, which he owned, on 10 July 1805.<br>
<br>Wordsworth said that Wedgwood produced in him &#145;an expression of sublimity beyond what I ever experienced from the appearance of any other human being&#146;  (Litchfield, 127). Coleridge noted in him a fine and ever watchful sense of beauty, united with the most patient accuracy in experimental research. Humphry Davy found his opinions &#145;a secret treasure&#146;  (Treneer, 48). Sydney Smith said that he knew &#145;no man who appears to have made such an impression on his friends&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), and his friends included many of the leading literary and scientific figures of his day.<br>
<br>Wedgwood's only writings are two papers on the &#145;Production of light from different bodies, by heat and by attrition&#146;  (<span class="italic">PTRS</span>, 82, 1792, 28&#150;47; 270&#150;82), read before the Royal Society of London in 1791 and 1792, in which we find the earliest suggestion of the general law that all bodies become red hot at the same temperature.<br>
