<span class="headword">Small,  James</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1740, <em>d.</em> 1793), <span class="occ">agriculturist and plough maker</span>, was born at Upsettlington in the parish of Ladykirk, Berwickshire, and baptized in Ladykirk on 28 March 1740; he was the son of John Small, a farmer, and Elspeth Robeson. He served an apprenticeship with a carpenter and plough maker at Hutton, Berwickshire. About 1758 he went to Yorkshire to work for a Mr Robertson, maker of wagons and carriages at Doncaster. He returned to Scotland in 1763 and settled on a farm at Blackadder Mount, Berwickshire, where he also had a blacksmith's shop. Here he started to experiment with ploughs to establish which worked with the least draught. On 30 December 1766 he married Janet Smith at Chirnside, Berwickshire.<br>
<br>There is much speculation about how much Small based his work on his knowledge of developments in England, especially the design of the Rotherham plough introduced during the 1730s. This plough, with a breast covered with iron plate and iron coulter and share, introduced some elements of standardized design and construction. By the time Small was working in Yorkshire, ploughs of the Rotherham type were becoming well known and examples were to be found in the Scottish lowlands. However, he conducted his experiments using the local ploughs of Berwickshire, known as the &#145;old Scotch&#146; type. They were heavy, needing, it was said, at least a pair of horses and a pair of oxen to draw them with several labourers to control plough and animals. The Berwickshire landowner James Renton of Lammermuir became his patron, financing the establishment of Small's smithy and carpenter's shop, and also advancing the working capital. After years of trials he constructed his first improved plough in 1779&#150;80. It had a mouldboard of iron, cast at the Carron foundry. The reduced friction through the soil of this mouldboard meant that Small's ploughs normally required only a pair of horses and one ploughman. Trials by the Dalkeith Farming Society showed Small's plough requiring only 9&#150;10 cwt of force in ploughing up old pasture compared with 16 cwt needed by the old Scotch type. Small subsequently extended the use of cast iron to other parts hitherto made of wood, including the sheath and head. Small's plough was not suitable for all types of soil and so was not universally popular (the ploughmen in, for example, Lanarkshire being quite against it). There remained room for debate as to the precise design of mouldboards and the mathematics involved. However, Small had established the principles which all subsequent designers followed. In introducing more cast-iron parts he was also opening up a path leading to the establishment of large plough works and agricultural engineering firms.<br>
<br>Small enjoyed patronage from several leaders of Scottish society. Henry Home, Lord Kames, encouraged him in the publication of his treatise. Sir John Sinclair, a leader of progressive agricultural opinion in Scotland, was another champion of Small and his work. Small did not forget his first investor, Renton, who in 1784 became the dedicatee of his <span class="italic">Treatise of Ploughs and Wheel-Carriages</span>. This book made Small the first to set out the scientific principles of plough design in print, building upon and clarifying the work of previous thinkers on the subject as well as expressing his own theories. The treatise was the standard text on plough design for fifty years.<br>
<br>Small's works employed a number of hands in the manufacture of ploughs, wagons, and carts. He moved in the early 1780s to Rosebank, Ford, Edinburghshire. Here he enjoyed the patronage of Henry Scott, third duke of Buccleuch. His sons, John and Alexander, began to take a more active role in the implement-making business, which continued after his death as Alexander Small &amp; Co. James Small died in 1793.<br>
