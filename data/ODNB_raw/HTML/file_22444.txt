<span class="headword">Pole, Sir  Charles Morice</span>  (1757&#150;1830), <span class="occ">naval officer and politician</span>, born on 18 January 1757, was the second of five children and the second son of Reginald Pole (<i>d</i>. 1767) of Stoke Damerell, Devon, and his second wife, Anne, daughter of John Francis Buller of Morval, Cornwall, and Caroline Hunter. He was the great-grandson of Sir John Pole, third baronet, of Shute, Devon, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Sir William Morice.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer17721796"></a>Early career, 1772&#150;1796</h2>Pole was educated at Plympton grammar school and on 16 January 1770 entered the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth Dockyard. This education, and his choice of professional career, may reflect the influence of his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28831/', "Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Watson")</script>. Two years later Pole was appointed to the <i>Thames</i> (32 guns) under Captain William Locker. In December 1773 he was moved to the <i>Salisbury</i> (50 guns), going to the East Indies with the broad pennant of Commodore Sir Edward Hughes, by whom he was promoted lieutenant in the <i>Seahorse</i> (24 guns) on 26 June 1777. In the following year he was moved to the <i>Ripon</i> (60 guns), and took part in Sir Edward Vernon's encounter with M. Tronjoly before Pondicherry on 9 August. On 25 October 1778 Pole was promoted to command the sloop <i>Cormorant</i> (18 guns) and in her he returned to England with Vernon's dispatches. He arrived on 12 March 1779, his promotion was confirmed on 18 March, and on 22 March he was advanced to post rank and appointed captain of the <i>Britannia</i> (100 guns), flying the flag of Rear-Admiral George Darby.<br>
<br>On 27 March 1781 Pole was appointed to the <i>Success</i> (32 guns). In her, a year later, he was sent to Gibraltar in charge of the hired armed storeship <i>Vernon</i>. Early on 16 March 1782, off Cape Spartel, he sighted and immediately attacked the Spanish <i>Santa Catalina</i> (34 guns). He was strongly supported by the <i>Vernon</i> and about 8.20 a.m. the <i>Santa Catalina</i> struck, her hull &#145;like a sieve, the shot going through both sides&#146;  (Clowes, 4.79). The necessary repairs were partially complete when, on 18 March, other warships were sighted, and rather than let her fall into enemy hands Pole set her on fire. Too late he found them to be the British frigates <i>Apollo</i> (32 guns) and <i>Cerberus</i> (28 guns) with a convoy.<br>
<br>The influence Pole's family could exert had already been illustrated by his advantageous placements, rapid promotion, and his employment during the decade of peace from 1783. Between 1783 and 1786 he commanded the guardship <i>Crown</i> (64 guns), itself a mark of Admiralty favour, and on 30 August 1786 he was appointed to the <i>Scipio</i> (64 guns) in the build up to the so-called &#145;Dutch armament&#146;. During the Spanish armament of 1790 Pole was appointed, on 10 May, to command the <i>Melampus</i> (36 guns), stationed off Brest, and during the following year he was in the <i>Illustrious</i> (74 guns). On 8 June 1792 he married Henrietta (<i>d</i>. after 1830), third daughter of John Goddard, a Rotterdam merchant, of Woodford Hall, Essex, and niece to the wealthy merchant Henry Hope of Amsterdam. The couple had two daughters.<br>
<br>Three weeks after war was declared (20 February 1793) Pole was in the <i>Colossus</i> (74 guns). In her he went to the Mediterranean to become part of Lord Hood's fleet in taking Toulon, and he returned to England in 1794 to join the Channel Fleet under Lord Howe. The <i>Colossus</i> formed part of Rear-Admiral Montagu's squadron, ordered by Howe to cruise, looking for the French grain convoy from America under Vanstabel, but missing both Vanstabel and Howe through lack of intelligence. He therefore did not take part in the action on 1 June 1794, but saw the remains of the French fleet returning to Brest. Outnumbered, Montagu withdrew, reaching Cawsand Bay on 12 June.<br>
<br>On 1 June 1795 Pole was promoted rear-admiral of the blue and joined Rear-Admiral Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian, appointed to command of the Leeward Islands station. Storms delayed the fleet from leaving England until 20 March 1796. The expedition's aim, to reinforce British troops trying to take St Lucia from the French, was achieved by the end of May. Christian and Pole returned home in the <i>Beaulieu</i> (18 guns), arriving in England in November.<h2>
<a name="Spithead1797andlaternavalcareer"></a>Spithead (1797) and later naval career</h2>In March 1797 Pole was appointed first captain of the <i>Royal George</i> (100 guns), flying Lord Bridport's flag, and his captain of the fleet. He was thus closely involved in the mutiny of the fleet at Spithead in mid-April. Bridport sent him to London on 16 April, to give the Admiralty a first-hand account of the mutiny, and he returned with news that the Admiralty board was coming to Portsmouth to confront the situation. With admirals Gardner and Colpoys, Pole conveyed the board's concessions to the delegates of the mutinous crews on 18 April, on the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> (100 guns). But after deliberation the mutineers refused the concessions and insisted that their other demands be met. Admiralty proposals were only finally agreed on 20 April, though crews continued to wait for orders to weigh anchor from the delegates on the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>. It fell to Pole and his colleagues to resolve the delay by securing a royal pardon. Pole's reading of the pardon to the delegates on the <i>Queen Charlotte</i> effectively brought the mutiny at Spithead to a conclusion. But the outbreak of unrest at the Nore in May 1797 kept suspicions alive on both sides. Letters between Pole and his friend at the Admiralty Captain William Young reflect not only the ongoing wariness of the mutineers but irregularities and lack of discipline and order among officers, of which St Vincent was to complain later. Pole wrote regularly to Young, who thanked him for sending news items even when unpleasant. When Admiral Robert Man was offered a seat at the Admiralty in August 1798, Young expressed regret that Pole had not been recommended; it was an appointment Pole himself wished for. In March 1799 Young was asking Pole, promoted rear-admiral of the red on 14 February, for suggestions to fill the vacancy left by the death of Admiral Charles Thompson and responding to Pole's worries as to whether he could hoist his flag and remain captain of the fleet to Bridport. Young also sympathized with Pole on his differences with Admiral Sir Peter Parker and again after the disappointing action at Aix Roads, which Young blamed in part on imperfect orders.<br>
<br>This action was a product of Admiral Bruix's escape from Brest in April 1799. Bridport, who had been loosely blockading the French base, fell back to protect Ireland, thought to be the French objective. But by June, Bruix was returning to his base and reported heading for Rochefort. Bridport therefore sailed to prevent him. On 4 June he sighted the Spaniards, who made for Aix Roads and were blockaded there by a small squadron of the Channel Fleet. A few weeks later they were joined by the <i>Sans Pareil</i> (80 guns) and the <i>Royal George</i>, the latter now flying Pole's flag. Pole attacked the Spanish ships on 2 July, but they were moored between the Isle of Aix and the Boyart shoal and protected by a floating mortar battery whose range was much greater than that of the British ships. Unable to achieve anything, Pole ordered the British frigates and bomb-vessels to withdraw, and though they were followed for a time by enemy gunboats, there was no loss or damage on either side.<br>
<br>On 1 May 1800 Pole was appointed to the Newfoundland command, and he hoisted his flag in the <i>Agincourt</i> (60 guns) on 28 June at Spithead. He returned on 16 November and was promoted vice-admiral of the blue on 1 January 1801. On 2 June he was appointed to relieve Lord Nelson in command of the Baltic fleet. He sailed in the <i>Aeolus</i> (32 guns), arriving on 17 June and transferring his flag to the <i>St George</i> (90 guns). Little remained to do but bring the British ships home and Pole left the Baltic in early August, distinguishing himself by taking the fleet through the difficult passage of the great belt against a nearly head wind. He reached Spithead on 20 August and immediately set off for Cadiz, arriving off Cape St Vincent on 27 August. He cruised off Cadiz, blockading the eleven enemy ships there, from September to November, and returned home, striking his flag on 4 December. On 18 January 1802 he was appointed to the Newfoundland command but he was replaced on 6 April by Admiral James Gambier, and had no further service afloat, though he was promoted vice-admiral of the red on 23 April 1804 and admiral of the blue on 9 November 1805. His replacement in the Newfoundland command marked Pole's intention to stand in the forthcoming parliamentary election, when he won a seat at Newark, Nottinghamshire, in the Newcastle interest.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentarycareer"></a>Parliamentary career</h2>Pole's interest in a Commons seat dated from 1793. In 1796, while in the Caribbean, he had expected to be returned for East Looe, the pocket borough of his Buller relations, managed by his uncle, the bishop of Exeter. He was disappointed there but was put up for Minehead, Somerset, financed by his wife's uncle Henry Hope, the wealthy Amsterdam merchant, as a running partner for John Langston, Hope's brother-in-law. Langston was elected but Pole failed. When there was a vacancy at Plymouth in 1797 Pole asked his brother, Reginald Pole Carew, if Pitt's government would support him, urging that he had subscribed &pound;1000 towards the loyalty loan that year. However, the administration had already chosen their candidate. Created a baronet on 12 September 1801, on the recommendation of his brother's friend Henry Addington, Pole finally gained the seat at Newark in 1802 and represented it until 1806. Admiral Lord St Vincent, now first lord of the Admiralty, on the recommendation of John Markham, his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, appointed Pole to the commission of naval inquiry into abuses in the civil administration, which was established in December. Pole became its chairman. Established at 24 George Street, Westminster, the commission began work at once. Meanwhile the international situation deteriorated and renewed war seemed likely. In late April 1803 questions were being asked in the Commons about the commission's progress. On 4 May, Pole, making his first known speech in the house, answered these, declaring that the commission, whose work had been arduous and attention unremitting, would report soon; the first report was presented eight days later, on 12 May. Two more reports followed in June. On 11 July Pole had leave to introduce a bill to regulate the administration of the Chatham Chest, the naval charity, which became law on 29 July. A further two reports appeared in August, and others followed in 1804, the fourteenth and last appearing on 30 June 1806.<br>
<br>Throughout this period attacks on the unpreparedness of Addington's government for war, and Pitt's attacks on St Vincent's Admiralty, intensified. Pole supported St Vincent on 15 March 1805, opposing Pitt's motion for a return showing the number of ships in commission, designed to prove that Addington's defence arrangements were inadequate. He remained an Addington supporter after Addington resigned, though Pole disapproved of Addington's joining Pitt's government. He refuted accusations, in March 1805, that his naval commission had acted like a criminal tribunal. After the publication of the tenth report, on the treasurer of the navy (February 1805), Pole accused George Canning, then treasurer, of trying to obstruct an inquiry into these allegations against Lord Melville, a previous holder of that office. In July he strongly resisted attacks on the commission of naval inquiry, whose powers Pitt had not renewed and which was being replaced by a royal commission headed by Sir Charles Middleton.<br>
<br>Pitt's death in January 1806 led to a new, chiefly whig government. Pole accepted a seat at the Admiralty once Sir Charles Grey, the first lord, agreed to dispense with the custom whereby former members of the board took precedence in the patent over new members. He served in this office between February and October 1806 but he was not an active figure in the Commons.<br>
<br>In the general election of 1806 Pole had stood for Plymouth, his native town, and with ministerial backing topped the poll. His position there on the fall of the ministry in 1807 seemed uncertain and friends began canvassing Penryn, Cornwall, for him. But the incoming tory government endorsed Pole's candidacy and he was returned, reportedly &#145;totally unconnected&#146; with the Portland administration  (Fisher, 4.842). But this was not entirely advantageous professionally. In 1807 and 1808 Pole applied three times to the new Admiralty for an active command without success. His speaking and voting record illustrates why this was so: defending Grey's naval administration (July 1807), voting against the government on the Copenhagen affair, and speaking and voting for Burdett's motion for an inquiry into the droits of the Admiralty (both February 1808). In March and April he introduced motions for the reform of Greenwich Hospital's administration and of the Royal Naval Asylum, both of which were opposed and defeated by the government. In December he was blaming setbacks in the Peninsula on the government's inefficiency and voted against them on the issue of the convention of Cintra on 21 February 1809. His hostile attitude to government further hardened with the failure of the Walcheren campaign. In February and March 1810 he argued for reform of the Admiralty court procedure, the reduction of sinecures, selective naval economies, and exemption from the property tax for officers on active service in May, and for reform of prize money adjudication procedures on 13 June.<br>
<br>The appointment of Charles Philip Yorke as first lord in April 1810 was thought likely to change Pole's opposition; Pole himself told his brother that if Yorke was &#145;disposed to act honourably by the service &hellip; I shall not be disposed to cavil at trifles&#146;  (Fisher, 4.843). But his position on naval affairs, on which he chiefly spoke, remained as independent as ever. Although he supported Yorke over the naval estimates in March 1811, he pressed for reform of the court of Admiralty, while in June he moved, unsuccessfully, for a full inquiry into naval pay.<br>
<br>Such independent attitudes did not commend Pole to the government. In the 1812 election he had again had ministerial backing and was returned unopposed for Plymouth; in return he was expected to support the administration. But though he did so on certain issues, Pole also condemned continued abuses in the administration of the Royal Naval Asylum in March 1815, again pressed for the exemption of serving officers from property tax in May 1815, and supported an inquiry into the management of Greenwich Hospital estates the following year. Political retribution came in 1818. In 1817 Pole had agreed to give up his Plymouth seat to his friend Sir Thomas Byam Martin, comptroller of the navy. But he was annoyed when, in 1818, his colleague at Plymouth, Benjamin Bloomfield, the prince regent's private secretary, vacated his seat unexpectedly and was replaced by another supporter of the regent, Sir William Congreve. Pole thought this move had been kept from him and he had been tricked into an unnecessary sacrifice of his seat. Encouraged by his friends, he determined to contest the election. But Martin and Congreve had considerable ministerial backing and Pole was heavily defeated.<h2>
<a name="Finalyearsandreputation"></a>Final years and reputation</h2>Pole had been promoted admiral of the white on 31 July 1810 and of the red on 4 June 1814. He was made KCB on 12 April 1815 and a GCB on 17 April 1818. In 1789 Pole had been made a groom of the bedchamber to William, duke of Clarence. When Clarence became William IV, in June 1830, Pole was appointed master of the robes, and on 22 July he was promoted admiral of the fleet.<br>
<br>Pole died on 6 September 1830 at Aldenham Abbey, Hertfordshire, a house he had bought in 1812 from the Thelluson family, who had converted this modest farmhouse into a fashionable Gothic mansion about 1800. Pole's daughters were Henrietta Maria Sarah (<i>b</i>. 1799), who married William Stuart, grandson of the earl of Bute, and Anna Maria (<i>b</i>. 1805), who may have been born deaf.<br>
<br>A member of a long established, politically important Devon family, Pole was naturally drawn to politics, particularly when his naval career ended. His political and social attitudes were essentially conservative. He had been shocked and uncomprehending at the naval mutinies. He opposed the abolition of the slave trade in February and March 1806, forcing a division on his own amendment to postpone abolition until 1812. But he was not a mere reactionary. Although his naval career was somewhat peripheral, on naval matters he spoke with authority in support of necessary reforms, bringing before the Commons abuses in naval administration which governments preferred to ignore. He had been a hard working chairman of a commission whose reports, exposing gross naval abuses, paved the way for more rigorous and responsible administrative standards.<br>
<br>Despite his connections, Pole never represented a family seat. It is unlikely he regretted this. His concept of honour was not that of a professional borough monger. In May 1812 he told Sidmouth that the conduct of his cousin Admiral Edward Buller, in breaking his pledge to accommodate Vansittart, the new chancellor of the exchequer, at East Looe, the borough Buller owned, had &#145;increased my abhorrence of House of Commons <i>salesmen</i>; if anything could make me wish to see what is often called reform it would be preventing such men having the power which my cousin now hath&#146;  (Fisher, 4.843).<br>
