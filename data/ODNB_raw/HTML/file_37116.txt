<span class="headword">St Victor,  Andrew  of</span>  (<em>c.</em>1110&#150;1175), <span class="occ">biblical scholar and abbot of Wigmore</span>, was born in England, but as a young man studied in Paris, where he became a canon of the Augustinian house of St Victor. There he explored the historical and literal sense of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>, in contrast to the allegorical exegesis of many of his contemporaries. He wrote commentaries, on the <span class="roman">Heptateuch</span>, <span class="roman">Judges</span> to <span class="roman">2 Chronicles</span>, the wisdom literature, and the prophets. Several of these have now been published, in critical editions, in the <span class="roman">Corpus Christianorum</span> series. Among the Parisian masters Andrew was a pioneer in the serious study of the Hebrew text, available in bilingual form with a Latin interlinear translation. Although his linguistic command of Hebrew, spoken or written, was not extensive, he could communicate with contemporary Jewish scholars in French, learning much <i>viva voce</i>. Thus, in his own commentary, he was able to make apposite reference to Hebrew etymology and exegesis, and to Jewish tradition. In focusing so sharply on the literal meaning Andrew largely avoided the central issue for a Christian analyst of the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>: in what ways was its interpretation affected by the life of Christ and the establishment of the Christian church? He was no theologian, neither a traditionalist maintaining the views of the fathers nor a scholastic systematizing a body of doctrine. Andrew remained a specialist within his own field.<br>
<br>In or after 1147 Andrew returned to England for a few troubled years as the first abbot of Wigmore, a daughter house of St Victor in Herefordshire. Although the Wigmore chronicle refers to him as prior of St Victor, he seems to have had no experience of monastic government, and showed no talent when the need arose. In 1154&#150;5 he returned to his scholarly work in Paris. A few years later, however, he was recalled to Wigmore (1161&#150;3), where he remained as abbot until his death on 19 October 1175 and where he was buried.<br>
<br>Andrew of St Victor was not a man of many pupils. Those whom he taught within St Victor provoked the criticism of a younger fellow canon, Richard, that they were &#145;judaizing&#146;&#151;that is, understanding the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> primarily as Jews rather than as Christians. Andrew's own orthodoxy was never impugned. His greatest immediate influence was on another Anglo-Norman, Master Herbert of Bosham, a scholar of much greater linguistic competence but less of a historian. Andrew's commentaries remained available in Paris. They were used by the small group of masters who established the teaching credentials of the University of Paris, notably Stephen Langton. But it was the learned friars of the thirteenth century who discovered Andrew's work and used it extensively both in France and England. Andrew was a familiar author to Roger Bacon and to the circle of Robert Grosseteste.<br>
