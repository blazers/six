<span class="headword">Lynch,  James</span>  (1626&#150;1713), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic archbishop of Tuam</span>, was a native of Galway city and a member of an influential local family. He received his early education from the Irish Jesuits and in 1651 entered the Jesuit run Irish College at Seville. Illness forced him home in 1653 but he later returned to Spain and took a doctorate in theology at the University of Salamanca. He taught in Compostela. In 1659 he was shipwrecked off San Sebastian. By 1668 he was parish priest of Galway and attached to the collegiate church. A noted preacher and administrator, he managed to remain popular with seculars and regulars alike, something of a feat in seventeenth-century Ireland. Thanks to his family connections he had the support of influential Catholic laity in rebuilding the local church.<br>
<br>Lynch's pastoral success brought him to the attention of Propaganda which, since the death of John de Burgo in 1666, was searching to fill the vacant see of Tuam. Lynch was an attractive candidate, especially as he had avoided any involvement with or sympathy for Peter Walsh's <span class="italic">Remonstrance</span>, which had sought to distinguish unqualified temporal loyalty to Charles II from spiritual allegiance to Rome. Backed by the local clergy and gentry and enjoying the support of several members of the hierarchy he was appointed to Tuam in 1669 and consecrated at Ghent later in the year. His early correspondence to Rome summarizes the main problems in his archdiocese: authority disputes with regular clergy, a badly educated secular clergy, a dispirited local gentry, and a general ignorance of religion and morality among the laity. While these problems were unremarkable for a seventeenth-century Irish diocese they were exacerbated by the virtual breakdown in the machinery of ecclesiastical government following the Cromwellian wars. Lynch set himself a rebuilding programme. Despite authority disputes with the regulars, he requested that the Irish Capuchins be allowed to establish houses in his diocese. He asserted his authority over suffragan dioceses even when it brought him into conflict with Propaganda. Roman firmness did not deter him from trying to adapt church law, especially that concerning marriage, to local circumstances.<br>
<br>His activities attracted the unwanted attentions of the civil administration and during his early career he endured sporadic harassment. Disaffected Catholics took advantage of anti-Catholic legislation to put pressure on Lynch. In 1671 a Galway based Augustinian, Martin French, brought him before the civil courts in Galway to face the charge of exercising foreign jurisdiction. When he was found guilty of <i>praemunire</i> Lynch appealed his case to Dublin where it collapsed. However, in 1674 French again brought charges and this time Lynch was imprisoned prior to transportation to Spain, where he spent many years. While absent in Spain he was named as a ringleader of the Popish Plot in 1678 and was lucky to escape the fate of his archiepiscopal colleagues Oliver Plunket of Armagh and Peter Talbot of Dublin. Between 1682 and 1684 he exercised episcopal functions in Seville. At the accession of James II he returned to Tuam and worked in relative freedom until the Jacobite defeat.<br>
<br>During the 1690s Lynch led a nomadic existence, living on the continent but frequently visiting his diocese, as in 1698, to oversee appointments. While abroad he governed through vicars, one of them his nephew Dominic Lynch. The ageing archbishop remained active in Irish ecclesiastical affairs. In 1704 he was in communication with Queen Mary concerning the filling of the vacant see of Elphin. After 1707 he settled permanently in France and enjoyed a pension from the French king. Solicitous of his own family's fortunes, in 1710 he unsuccessfully applied for the appointment as coadjutor of Tuam for his nephew Dominic. He died at the Coll&egrave;ge des Lombards, Paris, on 29 October 1713, leaving a substantial bourse for Galway students in the Irish College there. He was buried at St Paul's Church, Paris.<br>
