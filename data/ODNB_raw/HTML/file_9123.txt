<span class="headword">Falkener,  Edward</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>E. F. O. Thurcastle]</span>  (1814&#150;1896), <span class="occ">architect and archaeologist</span>, was born in London on 28 February 1814, the son of Lyon Falkener (1777&#150;1864), clerk of the ordnance department in the Tower of London, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stowell (1775&#150;1840). He was educated at a private school in Kent, and after declining a nomination for the civil service of the East India Company on the ground of delicate health, he was articled to John Newman (1786&#150;1859), an architect. He became a student of the Royal Academy in 1836, and in 1839 gained its gold medal for a design for a cathedral church. In the latter year he published <span class="italic">Was the Ceiling of the Parthenon Flat or Curved?</span> which was described as &#145;the introduction to a proposed work on Greek sculpture&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1842 Falkener started on a tour through all the countries of Europe except Spain and Portugal, through Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, and visited some of the Greek islands. He was a skilful draughtsman and made careful studies of the architectural remains in the various places he visited. While in Denmark he made sketches of the palace of Fredericksberg. When it was burnt in 1859 the king of Denmark, desiring to restore it in its original form, obtained Falkener's original drawings. In acknowledgement the king made him a knight of the order of the Dannebrog. In 1847, when he was at Pompeii, Falkener was allowed to excavate, at his own expense, a house named the house of Marcus Lucretius, a plan and description of which is given in the journal he edited, <span class="italic">The Museum of Classical Antiquities</span> (2 vols., 1851&#150;3). The Greek inscriptions he collected during his travels were edited in 1852 by Dr W. Henzen. During his travels he also acquired many examples of medieval Arab metalwork, pottery, arms, and armour. He was one of the first English collectors of such material and was a major lender to the Manchester exhibition in 1857. Unfortunately, his arms and armour were destroyed in a fire at Crystal Palace in 1858.<br>
<br>On his return to London in 1849, Falkener practised his profession for a few years, building some offices on St Dunstan's Hill, east London, which he occupied, but he devoted most of his time to literary work and making drawings of restorations. His drawings, which were exhibited at the Paris Universal Exhibition (1855), gained him the grand medal of honour, and in 1861 he was presented with another gold medal by the king of Prussia for his works on classical archaeology.<br>
<br>On 11 May 1866 Falkener married Blanche Mary Golding Victoria (1835&#150;1917), daughter of Benjamin Golding. The next few years were spent near St Briavels, north of Chepstow, where he bought some land and built walled gardens and a belvedere of Agra sandstone overlooking the River Wye. In 1875 the couple moved to Glan-y-m&ocirc;r, St Clears, Carmarthenshire, to which he made substantial alterations (such as the addition of Ottoman stained-glass windows).<br>
<br>Falkener had a thorough knowledge of architecture and classical archaeology, and, among other things, wrote on the lighting of museums of sculpture, and the artificial illumination of churches and mosques. He was a firm supporter of the lighting of Greek temples by the hypaethron, in opposition to the views of James Fergusson (1808&#150;1886) and Dr D&ouml;rpfeld, and published a treatise <span class="italic">On the Hypaethron of Greek Temples</span> (1861). Some of the illustrations in Fergusson's <span class="italic">A History of Architecture in All Countries</span> (2 vols., 1865&#150;7) were furnished by him, and many of his sketches were published in the Architectural Publication Society's <span class="italic">Dictionary of Architecture</span>, ed. W. Papworth (8 vols., n.d. [1852]&#150;1892). He was a member of the academy of Bologna, and of the architectural institutes of Berlin and Rome, and was elected honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects on 2 December 1895.<br>
<br>Besides the works mentioned, and <span class="italic">Daedalus, or, The Causes and Principles of the Excellence of Greek Sculpture</span> (1860) and <span class="italic">Ephesus and the Temple of Diana</span> (1862), Falkener frequently contributed to the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Institute of British Architects</span>. Under the pseudonym of E. F. O. Thurcastle (Edward Falkener of Thurcastle) he published in 1884 <span class="italic">Does the &#145;Revised Version&#146; Affect the Doctrine of the New Testament?</span>
<br>
<br>In 1892, at the age of seventy-eight, Falkener published <span class="italic">Games Ancient and Oriental and How to Play Them</span>, a pioneering (and somewhat misleading) study of board games with suggested reconstructions, four of which were manufactured and advertised for sale in the book. He continued his studies to the end of his life, and was engaged on a treatise on the Greek houses at Pompeii up to the time of his death at Glan-y-m&ocirc;r on 17 December 1896. He was buried two days later at Laugharne church, Carmarthenshire. His wife, son, and three daughters survived him.<br>
