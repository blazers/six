<span class="headword">Despenser,  Hugh, the younger</span>, first Lord Despenser  (<em>d.</em> 1326), <span class="occ">administrator and royal favourite</span>, was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7553/', "Hugh Despenser the elder (1261&#150;1326)")</script> and his wife, Isabel (<i>d</i>. 1306), widow of Payn Chaworth and daughter of William de Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (<i>d</i>. 1296). His parents had married by 1287, and Hugh was old enough to be knighted by the prince of Wales on 22 May 1306. In the same year Edward I purchased his marriage for &pound;2000 and arranged for him to wed Eleanor de Clare (<i>d</i>. 1337), eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/5438/', "Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester (d. 1295)")</script>, and the king's own granddaughter. At the outset of the reign of Edward II the younger Despenser does not seem to have possessed substantial property&#151;on 14 May 1309 Edward II granted him the manor of Sutton in Norfolk, formerly a templar property, in order to make up his income to &pound;200 per annum. In the following year his father provided him with several manors in Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, and Essex from the inheritance of his own mother, Alina Basset. In 1313 he accompanied the king to France, and at this time he received the wardship and marriage of William Huntingfield, a grant that was contested unsuccessfully by Thomas of Lancaster (<i>d</i>. 1322), and that may have been one source of their later enmity. His prospects were greatly enhanced by the death of his brother-in-law, Gilbert de Clare, earl of Gloucester, at Bannockburn on 24 June 1314. But although the earl's widow, Matilda, received her dower lands in December, the division of the Clare lands among the earl's three sisters could not take place immediately as the widowed countess claimed to be pregnant. In May 1315, tired of waiting, Despenser seized Tonbridge Castle in Kent. The castle was held by the Clares of the archbishop of Canterbury, and, despite equivocation on Despenser's part, it had to be returned to the archbishop. Nevertheless, this episode seems to be indicative of the avaricious and violent tendencies that Despenser was later to demonstrate so frequently.<br>
<br>Surprisingly, perhaps, the younger Despenser makes his first appearance as a witness in the charter rolls of Edward II only on 14 May 1316 (although as early as 17 July 1314 his father is specifically referred to therein as Hugh Despenser, senior), after which date he appears occasionally until February 1319. Thereafter he and the king were virtually inseparable until July 1321, when the Despensers, father and son, were sent into exile. In part Despenser's increased proximity to the king can be attributed to his appointment as chamberlain of the king's household at the York parliament of October 1318. The office of chamberlain was associated by contemporaries with Edward II's earlier favourite, Piers Gaveston, who had been executed by a coalition of barons in 1312. Certainly this office provided Despenser with ready access to the king, and, like Gaveston, Despenser would soon be accused of denying others, including the queen herself, access to the king. There seems to be far less basis for suspecting any homosexual relationship between the king and Despenser than had been the case with Gaveston, but there can be little doubt of Edward's growing confidence in and dependence upon his new favourite. In any case, by 1317 the younger Despenser had become an important magnate by virtue of his wife's inheritance. The apportionment had been long delayed, first by the rising of Llywelyn Bren in Glamorgan in 1316, and later by the need to find suitable husbands for Eleanor de Clare's younger sisters. Margaret, widow of Piers Gaveston, married Hugh Audley in April 1317, and Elizabeth, widow of John de Burgh, son of the earl of Ulster, married Roger Damory in May 1317. In November 1317 the settlement of the Clare lands was at last finalized, the Despenser share being valued at some &pound;1500, the vast majority of which was located in Wales. Almost at once Despenser set about consolidating his hold over the Clare lands, and not only his own. Before Hugh Audley could obtain formal seisin of Gwynll&#373;g, Despenser had already taken the homage and fealty of tenants there, and despite royal intervention on Audley's behalf, Despenser managed to hold on to this valuable parcel of land. Indeed, within a year he was able to obtain confirmation of his lordship in exchange for some less valuable manors elsewhere, and he was also confirmed in a life interest in the castle of Dryslwyn and the lordship of Cantref Mawr.<br>
<br>Despenser's acquisitive tendencies soon led to war. Tensions in the kingdom mounted between 1318 and 1321, aided by the ignominious failure of the Scottish campaign of 1319, but largely fuelled by Despenser's activity in the Welsh march. A confrontation was occasioned by Despenser's entry into the dispute over the lordship of Gower, which William (VII) de Briouze was proposing to sell. In this he aroused the enmity of a broad coalition of marcher lords, including Humphrey (VII) de Bohun, earl of Hereford, Roger Mortimer of Wigmore, John (I) Mowbray, Maurice Berkeley, and Hugh Audley. In October 1320 Mowbray, the son-in-law of William de Briouze, entered Gower without royal licence and was challenged by Despenser. Hereford took the lead for the marcher lords, defending the custom of the marches, but Edward took Gower into his own hands in December. Despite injunctions from the king to abstain from illegal assemblies, the marchers and other disgruntled magnates, including the earl of Lancaster, met to weigh their options, and on 4 May 1321 they attacked the Despenser lands. On 8 May 1321 Newport fell, followed by Cardiff on the 9th, and Gower on the 13th. The devastation of the Despenser lands was thorough. In August the marchers met with the king in parliament in London and laid their charges against the Despensers. The catalogue of charges is reminiscent of those brought against Piers Gaveston earlier in the reign: encroaching on the royal power; denying access to the king except in their presence; replacing good officials with corrupt ones; misappropriating templar properties. The younger Despenser was even charged with murder, in the execution of Llwelyn Bren after his rebellion. On 14 August, having been advised by the earl of Pembroke that there was no alternative, Edward II agreed in parliament to the exile of the Despensers, and on 20 August he pardoned the barons for their attack on them.<br>
<br>Rather than ending hostilities, the exile from England of the Despensers led to far greater bloodshed. While the younger Despenser tried his hand at piracy in the channel, attacking a Genoese ship, killing its crew and seizing its cargo, and attacking Southampton, the king opened an offensive against the baronial opposition by besieging Bartholomew Badlesmere's castle of Leeds in Kent. The marchers did not relieve it, and when it fell on 31 October the king had the garrison and its commander executed. Next he sought the recall of the Despensers through a convocation summoned to Canterbury in December. He obtained the answer he sought, and on 8 December he recalled the Despensers. Soon afterwards he set out for the Welsh march, supported by the earls of Pembroke, Arundel, Warenne, and Richmond, and a coalition of Welsh lords. This was perhaps the most successful military undertaking of Edward II's entire reign. In January and February 1322 many of the marchers surrendered. The rest retreated to join their ally the earl of Lancaster. As the king moved north, joined by Despenser at Lichfield on 2 March, the barons retreated before him, and on 16 March 1322 were defeated by royalist forces at Boroughbridge. Hereford was killed in the battle, and Lancaster was captured the next day. On 22 March he was executed, and many more were to follow. The baronial opposition was crushed, while royal power was correspondingly reasserted.<br>
<br>The period between 1322 and 1326 saw Despenser's wealth, power, and influence reach their zenith. Both son and father were ubiquitous at court, as is apparent in the charter rolls, which also attest to their territorial aggrandizement during this period of confiscations, fines, and near anarchy at the local level. During these years&#151;and in this they acted as they had done before the crisis of 1321&#151;the Despensers, and particularly the younger Hugh, built up a network of retainers who also served as royal officers, and by exploiting the potentialities of this &#145;double allegiance&#146; they were able to exert tremendous influence across the realm. Their victims could have little hope of redress, when royal agents of justice were also agents of the Despensers. This revealed itself most clearly in the seizure and subsequent administration of lands forfeited by the king's opponents. The younger Despenser used a combination of royal favour, legal manipulation, and outright force to consolidate his holdings in Wales and the marches, so that by the time of his death his lands were valued at no less than &pound;7000. The bullying tactics he employed against such vulnerable victims as Elizabeth Damory (widow of Roger Damory), Alice, countess of Lancaster (widow of Thomas, earl of Lancaster), and Mary, countess of Pembroke (widow of Aymer de Valence), are well documented. His lavish expenditures at Caerphilly Castle and Tewkesbury Abbey have left enduring monuments to his exalted stature during these years. Even so, the contrariants continued to seek redress against Despenser's aggressive policy of self-advancement, and with the continuing failure of English arms, both in Scotland and in Gascony, discontent with the royal government continued to grow. Despenser himself seems to have been aware of the hatred increasingly felt for him, since he complained to the pope that he was being threatened by black magic.<br>
<br>Militarily the so-called War of St Sardos in 1323&#150;5 may have been a minor affair, but for Edward II and the Despensers it turned out to have incalculable consequences. The king's inability or unwillingness to leave the country prevented a negotiated settlement to this conflict. In March 1325 he sent his wife, Isabella, sister of the French king, Charles IV, as his mediator. The author of the contemporary <span class="italic">Vita Edwardi secundi</span> sagely remarked that &#145;she will not (so many think) return until Hugh Despenser is wholly removed from the king's side&#146;  (<span class="italic">Vita</span>, 135). The settlement arranged by the queen called for Edward II to perform homage for English lands in France, but he was afterwards allowed to send his heir in his stead. However, neither the queen nor the prince returned to England following his performance of homage. In January 1326 Queen Isabella wrote to Bishop John Stratford (<i>d</i>. 1348) saying that she would not return until the Despensers had been removed from the court. In May 1326 two legates arrived in England with a pair of papal letters for the younger Despenser. The first called on him to assist in reconciling the king and queen, while the second, more generally, asked that he seek to foster better relations. Essentially, the letters were calling for Despenser to step aside in order to facilitate Isabella's return. But Edward II had the legates arrested, and after he had interviewed them in Dover Castle, they left the country without publishing their letters.<br>
<br>Despite elaborate preparations for defence of the realm on the king's behalf, the queen's invasion in September 1326 was virtually unopposed. The earl of Norfolk, Edward II's half-brother, was charged with the defence of the east coast, but he went over at once to the queen's side. His actions may have been prompted by a personal grievance against Despenser, who had coerced him into surrendering the lordship of Chepstow on very poor terms. But Norfolk's defection was representative of a much larger problem for Despenser and the king. As recent studies by Saul and Waugh have convincingly demonstrated, the Despenser administrative machine was widespread, but thinly rooted. The value of the sheriff's office, for instance, appears to have been insufficiently appreciated, and oaths of allegiance, when taken only as a means of obtaining access to crown patronage, did little to strengthen the Despensers' cause once it began to fail. The king and Despenser abandoned London on 2 October and headed west, towards Despenser's lands and the Welsh allies who had served Edward so well in 1321&#150;2. Bristol fell to Isabella on 26 October, when king and favourite were at Cardiff. From there they travelled to Caerphilly, which was left in charge of Despenser's eldest son, Hugh. After moving west to Margam and then Neath, on 16 November the king and Despenser with a small entourage were taken prisoner near Neath, or perhaps Llantrisant, by Henry of Lancaster, earl of Leicester, and Rhys ap Howel, a marcher lord connected to the Bohun earls of Hereford. Despenser was taken to Hereford. Outside the city he was stripped and then reclothed with his arms reversed, and he was crowned with stinging nettles. Condemned to death as a traitor, on 24 November 1326 he was drawn on a hurdle to the gallows, and then hanged from a height of 50 feet. Still alive, he was cut down and eviscerated before finally being beheaded. His head was displayed on London Bridge; his quarters were sent to Bristol, Dover, York, and Newcastle. In December 1330 Eleanor de Clare received royal permission to collect her husband's bones and inter them in Tewkesbury Abbey.<br>
<br>The younger Despenser was responsible for the remodelling of Tewkesbury Abbey church, work subsequently completed by his widow and their son Hugh. It has been convincingly argued that this building programme was meant to produce a grandiose family mausoleum that would glorify the house of Despenser. The younger Despenser is represented in stained glass in the north window of the west bay between Robert fitz Hamon (<i>d</i>. 1107), founder of the abbey, and on the other side Gilbert de Clare, first earl of Gloucester (<i>d</i>. 1230) in the Clare family, and Henry I's illegitimate son Robert, the first lord of Tewkesbury to bear the title earl of Gloucester. Even more impressive as a symbol of his aspirations is the depiction of Despenser among the lords of Tewkesbury in paradise, in the arch of the choir and sanctuary.<br>
