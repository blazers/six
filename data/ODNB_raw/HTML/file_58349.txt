<span class="headword">Pauling,  George Craig Sanders</span>  (1854&#150;1919), <span class="occ">civil engineer and railway promoter</span>, was born on 6 September 1854 at 4 Park Terrace, South Street, Lorrimore Road, Walworth, Surrey, the eldest child of the two boys and two girls born to Richard Clark Pauling (1833&#150;1894), civil engineer, and his wife, Jane Sanders Bone (1834&#150;1915). His father, grandfather, and great-uncle were all railway contractors. Pauling's father, having spent several years in India, intended him for service in that country, but George's schooling ended when the family income was reduced by his father's illness and irregular employment.<br>
<br>After casual work, Pauling was taken on as a pupil in 1870 by Joseph Firbank, a major railway contractor. In 1874 his father was appointed engineer to the Cape Government Railways, and first his younger brother Harold and then George himself joined him there in 1875; he soon became a contractor on his own account, forming Firbank, Pauling &amp; Co. with his former employer. They won the contract for a tunnel on the Grahamstown line, then under construction, and made a respectable &pound;15,000 profit. Thus financially secure Pauling married in 1878 Annie Ayton; they had two sons.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Pauling could not resist the lure of speculating in a variety of schemes and business ventures; he invested in a saddlery, and in an ostrich and cattle ranch started by friends, and having become a freemason he undertook to build the masonic temple in Grahamstown. He then departed for England, in 1879, with his wife and baby son, intending to find work there, but was forced to return in haste on learning that his investments in Grahamstown were at risk. Everything was going against him: a drought had reduced yields on the ranch, part of the masonic temple had collapsed, and one of his loans was unlikely to be repaid. In some desperation, Pauling called in his creditors in 1880. He later invested in gold mining at Witwatersrand, but left before the astonishing richness of that field was appreciated.<br>
<br>During the 1880s Firbank, Pauling &amp; Co. undertook a number of major railway projects. The line between Port Alfred and Grahamstown was completed in 1884, and the firm was also responsible for Kimberley Railway. This &#145;brought to completion the railway construction scheme, which had been initiated in 1874 to connect the harbours of the Cape Colony with Kimberley&#146;  (Heydenrych, 535). In June 1885 Pauling's wife died, and Pauling sent his two sons to England to be cared for by his mother. In the succeeding years he operated on an international scale, travelling extensively through the Turkish dominions, where a railway was planned from Alexandretta (Iskenderun), through Persia, to Karachi. Pauling subsequently built railways in Greece and Puerto Rico. He constructed the line from Haifa to Damascus and undertook a number of other major civil engineering works, including the Tata and Shirawata dams in India. On 1 November 1887 Pauling married Edith Kate Halliwell in the UK; they had one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1889 Pauling was in Johannesburg having discussions with the financier Baron Emile D'Erlanger regarding investment in mines, when tenders were invited for the first railway in the Transvaal. This was the &#145;Rand tram&#146;, a railway from Johannesburg to Boksburg. Pauling, in partnership with James Butler, secured the contract; work began in 1890, and later additional lines were laid from Johannesburg to Krugersdorp and from Boksburg to Springs. Pauling and Butler also constructed part of the Delagoa Bay Railway at Krokodilpoort.<br>
<br>Through President Kruger, a friend of the family, and also through Cecil Rhodes, other railway projects materialized. These included the line from Vryburg to Mafeking, which Pauling completed in 1891, at Rhodes's request. His firm also constructed the line from Beira to Umtali, and on to Salisbury. Other major lines included the railway from Mafeking to Bulawayo, the line across Sir Lowry's Pass to Caledon, and also the railway from Ashton, via Swellendam and Riversdale, to Mossel Bay.<br>
<br>During these turbulent years, Pauling, a strong and sturdy man, always apt to respond with his fists rather than with words, resisted epidemics of cholera and conflicts with native peoples and with animals, mostly lions. He also undertook civil engineering projects in England, as one of the partners of Pauling and Elliott, until the partnership was dissolved in 1894. The contracting work was then undertaken by Pauling &amp; Co.<br>
<br>Pauling was appointed commissioner of public works to the first legislative assembly in Rhodesia in 1895. At a later date he also served as vice-chairman of the Rhodesian chamber of mines. Pauling in 1903 established another firm, the Transvaal Engineering and Contracting Company, which built further railways in Natal and elsewhere.<br>
<br>More than anyone else, Pauling was the architect of the railway system in southern and central Africa. Between 1900 and 1918 he built several hundred miles of railway in Rhodesia, including an extension to the Katanga copper mines at Elizabethville (Lubumbashi) in partnership with Belgian interests. He was also responsible for part of the Benguela railway across Angola, as well as the railway from Port Herald to Blantyre in Nyasaland.<br>
<br>It is not known what became of his second wife but on 17 November 1906 Pauling married Dolores (Lola) Guibara and the marriage produced another daughter. Having abandoned freemasonry in his early years, Pauling subsequently became a staunch Roman Catholic. He generously funded the building of a Catholic church at Effingham, Surrey, where his last years were spent. Pauling died at his home, The Lodge, Effingham, on 10 February 1919, and was survived by his third wife.<br>
