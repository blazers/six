<span class="headword">Walkingame,  Francis</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1723, <em>d.</em> 1783), <span class="occ">schoolmaster and writer on arithmetic</span>, was baptized on 25 July 1723 at St Giles-in-the-Fields, London, the only surviving son of John Walkingame (<i>d</i>. 1752), agent to the Marchant Water Works, and Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. in or before 1752), probably daughter of Hugh Marchant, founder of the works. His education is unknown. On 18 May 1746 he married Mary Hider (<i>d</i>. 1763/4) of Kensington; their first child was baptized there in 1747, and another in 1750.<br>
<br>In the following year, 1751, appeared the first edition of Walkingame's outstandingly successful school arithmetic book, <span class="italic">The Tutor's Assistant: being a Compendium of Arithmetic; and a Complete Question Book</span>. The title-page describes the author as &#145;writing-master and accomptant and master of the boarding-school in Kensington&#146;, while the preface says that it was compiled &#145;for the use of my own school&#146;. Walkingame returned his thanks to all &#145;whose kind approbation and encouragement have now established the use of this book in almost every school of eminence throughout the kingdom&#146;. He was referring to the schoolmasters and accountants among his 238 subscribers, who included also carpenters and plumbers. The fourth edition came out in 1760, and the twentieth in 1784, shortly after the author's death. Afterwards there were in many years two or three editions, variously edited, the main series from London and others in the provinces, notably from Gainsborough, York, and Derby. Further editions later appeared in Canada. An incomplete listing comprises 276 editions, the last in 1885; often an edition numbered 5000 or 10,000 copies. There were also close imitations, not always acknowledging the original. The York editions, starting in 1797, were corrected by Thomas Crosby of that city. To provide teachers and autodidacts with the working to the questions, in the same year Crosby published a <span class="italic">Key</span>, more substantial than the original work. It achieved at least sixty editions, with diverse authors and editors.<br>
<br>From 1751 to 1800 <span class="italic">The Tutor's Assistant</span> was one of the two most popular arithmetics (the other being by Thomas Dilworth), and thereafter reigned supreme for another half-century, its perpetuation assisted by the advent of stereotyping. Walkingame disclaimed originality. He aimed to equip his pupils to solve problems by using formulae, without necessarily understanding their validity. His success was based on inclusion of contemporary commercial topics, worked examples, and many practice questions with answers.<br>
<br>The second edition of the <span class="italic">Assistant</span> in 1752 no longer referred to &#145;the boarding-school in Kensington&#146;. It seems likely that about then Walkingame moved his family into his parental home at the Water Office in St Martin's Lane. By 1764 his wife must have died, possibly as a result of giving birth to a son the previous year, and on 22 December 1764 he married Elizabeth Maria Steere. Their youngest child, Jane, was born in 1781. From 1771 for about ten years he lived in Great Russell Street, before returning to Kensington, where he died in February or early March 1783, probably predeceased by his wife.<br>
<br>Walkingame's fame rests on his single publication. Augustus De Morgan commented: &#145;this book is by far the most used of all school-books, and deserves to stand high among them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Arithmetical Books</span>, 1847, 80). It must have suited the educational requirements of the century during which it flourished.<br>
