<span class="headword">Warden,  William</span>  (1777&#150;1849), <span class="occ">naval surgeon and author</span>, was born at Alyth in Forfarshire on 1 May 1777. From the parish school, he was sent to Montrose, where he served some years with a surgeon, being a fellow-pupil of William Burnett and Joseph Hume. He studied also for some time at Edinburgh University, and in 1795 entered the navy as surgeon's mate on board the frigate <i>Melpomene</i>, one of the ships implicated in the mutiny at the Nore. The story is told that the men demanded that the surgeon should be sent on shore and Warden appointed in his stead, but that Warden, on the advice of his captain, refused the promotion. He was, however, promoted in the following year; he was surgeon of the <i>Alcm&egrave;ne</i> at Copenhagen on 2 April 1801, and of the <i>Phoenix</i>, when she captured the <i>Didon</i> on 10 August 1805. In the latter engagement Warden was severely wounded, and he was for some time a pensioner of the Royal Naval Hospital, Greenwich. He also received a grant from the Patriotic Fund. In December 1811 the degrees of MA and MD <i>honoris causa</i> were conferred on him by the University of St Andrews. He afterwards served under Sir George Cockburn (1772&#150;1853) during the Anglo-American War of 1812&#150;14, and in 1815 was appointed to the <i>Northumberland</i>, Cockburn's flagship in the channel, ordered to take Napoleon to St Helena.<br>
<br>During the voyage, and afterwards for some months at St Helena, Warden was in frequent attendance on Napoleon, who probably talked frankly to him as to a non-combatant. Warden's knowledge of French, however, was limited, and the conversations seem to have been carried on principally, if not entirely, through the intermediary of Count de Las Cases, who acted as interpreter, sometimes, it may be supposed, not in good faith, and always with a very imperfect knowledge of English. The conversations, as Warden understood them, he noted down in his journal, and from them largely filled his letters to the lady whom he afterwards married. His friends' interest in these letters suggested that the subject matter of them&#151;as far as they related to Napoleon&#151;should be published; and Warden, having no experience as an author, and expecting to be called away on active service, put them into the hands of &#145;a literary gentleman&#146; to prepare for publication and to see through the press.<br>
<br>The book was published under the title <span class="italic">Letters Written on Board His Majesty's Ship the &#145;Northumberland&#146; and at St. Helena</span> (1816), and, owing to the intrinsic interest of the subject, ran through five editions in as many months. The favourable representation of Napoleon excited bitter criticism from the supporters of the government. In October 1816, in a savage article in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>, the author pointed out several passages and expressions which could not have been written by Warden at the time and under the circumstances stated, and plainly suggested that:<blockquote>Warden brought to England a few sheets of notes gleaned for the most part from the conversation of his better informed fellow-officers, and that he applied to some manufacturer of correspondence in London to spin them out into the &#145;Letters from St. Helena&#146;.</blockquote>There is no reason to doubt Warden's good faith, but his work has small historical value, for it is merely the &#145;literary gentleman's&#146; version of Warden's recollection of what an ignorant and dishonest interpreter described Bonaparte as saying. Bonaparte&#151;whether truthfully cannot be established&#151;afterwards assured Sir Hudson Lowe that his conversation as reported by Warden was different from anything he had said. Lowe mentioned this in a letter to Lord Bathurst, then secretary for war, and represented that Warden, who had been permitted to visit Longwood only as a medical officer in the exercise of his functions, had committed a breach of discipline in publishing the conversations and in publicly commenting on the conduct and character of individuals. A copy of this letter was forwarded to the Admiralty, and they, recognizing the breach of discipline, struck Warden's name off the list of surgeons. It was, however, shortly afterwards replaced at the instance of Sir George Cockburn, and Warden was appointed surgeon of the hospital ship <i>Argonaut</i> at Chatham.<br>
<br>Warden married, in 1817, Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Hutt of Appleby, Isle of Wight, sister of Sir William Hutt and niece of Captain John Hutt. They had one son, George Cockburn Warden, and two daughters. In 1824 Warden took his MD at Edinburgh, and in 1825 he was appointed surgeon of the dockyard at Sheerness, whence he was moved in 1842 to the dockyard at Chatham, and there he died on 23 April 1849.<br>
