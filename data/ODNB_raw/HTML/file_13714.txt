<span class="headword">Hope <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fulton]</span>,  Anne</span>  (1809&#150;1887), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born on 7 September 1809 at Calcutta, where her father, John Williamson Fulton (1769&#150;1830), was a merchant; he was a founder of the firm of Mackintosh, Fultons and McClintock. Her mother was Anne (1780?&#150;1845), daughter of Robert Robertson and widow of Captain John Hunt of the Bengal army. The younger Anne was the third of five daughters; she had two brothers. At an early age she was sent from India to Lisburn, co. Antrim, where her father's family resided, and on her parents' return home in 1820 settled with them in 4 Upper Harley Street, London, where she met friends of her father, who included Daniel O'Connell, John Lawless, and other Irish parliamentary leaders.<br>
<br>On 10 March 1831 Anne Fulton married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13724/', "James Hope MD (1801&#150;1841)")</script>, a physician at St George's Hospital specializing in heart disease; she assisted him with some of his publications. After his death in 1841 she prepared a memoir of him, which was edited by Dr Klein Grant and published in 1842. Anne Hope devoted herself to the education of her only son, Sir Theodore Cracraft Hope (<i>b</i>. 1831), who joined the Bombay civil service in 1853. Letters which she addressed to him were published in 1843 under the title <span class="italic">On Self-Education with Formation of Character</span>.<br>
<br>Ill health compelled Hope to spend much time in Madeira between 1842 and 1850, and she remained an invalid for the rest of her life. She became interested in ecclesiastical history, and completed in 1850, but did not publish, a work on the early Christian church. This research interest led her to convert to Roman Catholicism about 1846. She met W. G. Ward and John Dalgairns, fellow converts. She developed close links with the Oratorians, of which congregation Dalgairns was a member, and, for a while, she lived in Edgbaston, near the Birmingham Oratory, where John Henry Newman and Dalgairns were then based. Dalgairns became her chief literary adviser and counsellor. In a spirit of devotion to her adopted church, she published <span class="italic">The Acts of the Early Martyrs</span> (1855), which was based on Paul de Ribadeneira's <span class="italic">Flores sanctorum</span>, and intended for the use of oratory schools. It was republished several times within three years. This frankly hagiographical volume was followed in 1859 by a life of St Philip Neri, the founder of the Oratorians. Hope's next two publications were her most substantial: the <span class="italic">Life of St Thomas &agrave; Becket</span> (1868) and <span class="italic">The Conversion of the Teutonic Races</span> (2 vols., 1872). Both were scrupulously based on medieval chronicles and saints' lives, and showed wide reading, but exhibited little critical sense, being as credulous as they were learned. Dalgairns contributed a preface to each work. In 1878 she published <span class="italic">Franciscan Martyrs in England</span> and between 1874 and 1878 she also wrote seven contributions to the <span class="italic">Dublin Review</span>, including a reply to J. A. Froude's attack on Thomas a Becket. She spent her later years in Torquay, at the Hermitage, St Mary Church, and continued to work in old age, employing an amanuensis. She was examining material relating to the recently beatified English martyrs within a week of her death at home on 12 February 1887. The Catholic historian, Abbot Francis Gasquet, edited and published this manuscript as <span class="italic">The First Divorce of Henry VIII</span> (1894).<br>
