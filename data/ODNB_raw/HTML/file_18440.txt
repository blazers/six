<span class="headword">Mayne,  Cuthbert</span> <span class="st"> [St Cuthbert Mayne]</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1544, <em>d.</em> 1577), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic priest and martyr</span>, was baptized in Youlston, near Barnstaple, north Devon, on the feast of St Cuthbert, 20 March 1544, the son of William Mayne, a farmer employed by Sir John Chichester. He was educated at Barnstaple grammar school. Under Chichester's patronage, he was installed as rector of Huntshaw, Devon, on 11 December 1561. At the time he was only seventeen &#145;not knowing what religion and ministry meant&#146;  (Boyan and Lamb, 39). His uncle sent him to St Alban Hall, Oxford, in 1565. Having graduated BA in 1566 he was appointed a chaplain at St John's College and he proceeded MA in 1570.<br>
<br>At St John's College Mayne met two scholars, Gregory Martin and Edmund Campion, who persuaded him to embrace the Roman Catholic faith. He was forced to leave Oxford, and set sail from Cornwall to the English College at Douai, where he was admitted in 1573. He was ordained priest in 1575 and was awarded his BTh at Douai in 1576. That same year he returned to England and became chaplain to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27682/', "Francis Tregian")</script> of Golden Manor, Probus, Cornwall. Acting as steward to Tregian, Mayne was able to celebrate the mass freely throughout Cornwall on the extensive family estates. At the same time the bishop of Exeter, William Bradbridge, had been instructed to deal severely with the Catholics in Cornwall. He met the sheriff of Cornwall, Richard Grenville, in nearby Truro and endorsed Grenville's wish to search Golden Manor. On Corpus Christi day, 8 June 1577, Grenville surrounded Golden with a hundred armed men and at least eight JPs. After forcing their way in, they arrested Cuthbert Mayne who was wearing the waxen Agnus Dei, prohibited under Elizabethan law. Mayne's books and papers, which included a papal bull, were rushed to the bishop waiting in Truro.<br>
<br>Mayne was humiliatingly paraded through the villages of Cornwall to Launceston Castle. He was clapped in irons and held in a filthy dungeon for three months. At the Michaelmas assizes he was tried before Sir Roger Manwood and Sir John Jeffreys. There were six charges. He was accused of traitorously obtaining a bull from Rome on 1 October 1576, and of publishing this bull at Golden. The third charge was that he had strongly defended the authority of the bishop of Rome on 14 February at Launceston. The next two charges related to his purchase of Agnus Deis; he was accused of delivering one to Tregian and a second to eleven other people in September 1576. The final charge was that he had celebrated mass in the papal manner, assisted by Francis Tregian, on 1 June 1577. Although Judge Jeffreys argued that Mayne had never been to Rome and that the jubilee bull was out of date, Manwood declared Mayne a traitor and sentenced him to death. Tregian was to forfeit all his property and lands and was sentenced to imprisonment for life.<br>
<br>On 29 November 1577 Mayne was examined from early morning until dusk. He was assured of his life if he would swear on the <span class="roman">Bible</span> that the queen was the supreme head of the church in England. &#145;Upon this he took the <span class="roman">Bible</span> into his hands. Made the sign of the cross on it and said, &#147;The Queen neither ever was, nor is, nor ever shall be the head of the Church in England&#148;&#146;  (Boyan and Lamb, 58). Following this admission a form was drawn up for him to sign where he asked for clemency for his servant John Hodges, refused to name any of his friends, and admitted that he believed that if a Catholic prince should invade the realm to restore the Catholic faith then the Catholics in that realm should assist and help them. The document is signed in his own hand, &#145;These things affirmed by me Cuthbert Mayne I think to be trewe&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/118, 46). Mayne was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered at Launceston on 30 November 1577. He was dragged through the streets on a hurdle and was hanged in the market place. While still alive he was cut down, falling with such force that his eye was driven out. His members were severed and his heart held up to the people. His head was placed on the gate of Launceston Castle, and quarters of his body were sent to Bodmin, Barnstaple, Tregony, and Wadebridge. His skull is still publicly displayed in Launceston on a special pilgrimage day each June.<br>
<br>The first seminary priest to be martyred, Cuthbert Mayne was canonized by Pope Paul VI on 15 October 1970 as one of the forty martyrs of England and Wales. His saint's day is 30 November.<br>
