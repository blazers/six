<span class="headword">Buxton,  Patrick Alfred</span>  (1892&#150;1955), <span class="occ">medical entomologist</span>, was born on 24 March 1892 at 5 Hyde Park Street, Paddington, London, the eldest of the three children of Alfred Fowell Buxton, banker and chairman (1916&#150;17) of the London county council, and his wife, Violet, daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34190/', "Very Revd Thomas William Jex-Blake")</script>, headmaster of Cheltenham and Rugby schools and dean of Wells, and brother of Sophia Jex-Blake (1840&#150;1912), physician and campaigner for women's rights. Buxton's mother was of Norfolk descent, and his Quaker predecessors were prominent in business, philanthropy, and social reform, and included his great-grandfather, Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, first baronet (1786&#150;1845), and Sydney Charles, first Earl Buxton (1853&#150;1954). When he was eight, Buxton's family moved to Chigwell, Essex. He was educated at home until he was ten, then spent three years at a preparatory school before attending Rugby School (1905&#150;11).<br>
<br>Buxton entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1911, and that year published his first paper (with his brother, Denis) in the <span class="italic">Entomologist's Record and Journal of Variation</span>. The following year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Entomological Society of London. He graduated from Cambridge with first-class honours in both parts of the natural sciences tripos (1914/15), and in 1916 was elected to a Trinity College fellowship on a piece of undergraduate research completed in difficult wartime conditions. Having embarked on the study of medicine in November 1913, and served in the field ambulance in the autumn of 1914, Buxton qualified in medicine (MRCS, LRCP) from St George's Hospital in 1917. Taking up a commission in the Royal Army Medical Corps, he was posted to Mesopotamia and north-west Persia, where he devoted as much time as possible to natural history. This was the beginning of a nine-year, semi-peripatetic existence for Buxton and his consanguineous wife, Muryell Gladys, fourth daughter of William Talbot Rice, vicar of Swansea, whom he had married on 16 January 1917.<br>
<br>After returning to England, Buxton spent 1920&#150;21 working under G. H. F. Nuttall at Cambridge and taking a course in tropical medicine in London. In March 1921 he accepted the position of entomologist to the medical department in Palestine, and undertook research on malaria, and on desert and semi-desert faunas. His experiences in north-west Persia and Palestine during and after the First World War led to the publication of what he called that &#145;vigorous young man's book&#146;, <span class="italic">Animal Life in Deserts</span> (1923). This attractive work became a classic; it was continuously in demand for the next half-century and was reprinted in 1955. Under the auspices of the London School of Tropical Medicine, Buxton led a two-year expedition, from late 1923, to Samoa, the New Hebrides, and Ellice and Tokelau islands to study filariasis. He and his colleague G. H. E. Hopkins made exhaustive collections of the insects of the island, which formed the basis of the <span class="italic">Insect Fauna of Samoa</span> (9 pts, 1927&#150;35). Their two-volume <span class="italic">Researches in Polynesia and Melanesia</span> (1927&#150;8), however, represented the official record of the expedition. Encompassing geography, meteorology, and ethnology, Buxton's broad interest in natural history also extended to languages. He mastered Arabic, and endeavoured to learn the &#145;pidgin&#146; of the south seas while in Samoa.<br>
<br>On his return to London in January 1926 Buxton was appointed head of the department of entomology in the new London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and in 1933 he became professor in the University of London, where he remained until his death. One of the most widely travelled biologists of his time, he briefly returned to Palestine in 1931, and made a seven-month expedition to northern Nigeria in 1933. At the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine he gave a new direction to his subject by insisting on the necessity for basing applied entomology on a scientific understanding of the physiology of insects. To this end, he published a letter in <span class="italic">Nature</span> in 1926 that declared that &#145;real progress will not be made in applied entomology &hellip; until we devote time and labour to the study of the fundamentals of insect physiology&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nature</span>, 117, 1926, 624). His appointment of V. B. Wigglesworth (1899&#150;1994) as his assistant in the same year, and subsequent appointments, helped to consolidate this approach. Through his own research he made an impact on the study of mosquitoes and filariasis in the south Pacific, of plague fleas in Palestine, of the tsetse fly in Nigeria, and of the human louse in many parts of the world. More specifically, from 1926 to 1939, Buxton focused on the relations of insects to climate. He identified the importance of the immediate habitat, or &#145;microclimate&#146;, for the understanding and control of insects. By his own researches in this field, and by his examples and the appointments and opportunities which he secured for others, he did much to spread his physiology-based programme for applied entomology.<br>
<br>On the outbreak of war in 1939 Buxton concentrated all his energies on the improvement of insect control in the armed forces and in civilian life under wartime conditions. He established close relations with the medical departments of the War Office, Admiralty, and Air Ministry, and organized series of lectures to nurses and shelter marshals. He convinced Sir Edward Mellanby, secretary of the Medical Research Council, to create an entomological subcommittee of its military personnel research committee, with himself as chairman. Throughout the war, he travelled to the USA, Egypt, and west Africa to investigate and to promote insect eradication measures. Anticipating a repetition of large-scale trench warfare, he turned his attention to the concomitant problem of the louse. His immediate goal was to find a &#145;lasting&#146; insecticide with which to impregnate clothing. This research resulted in the publication of <span class="italic">The Louse</span> (1939; 2nd edn, 1947), and prepared the way for the early exploitation of the new insecticide, DDT.<br>
<br>Buxton's career reached its zenith during the war years and the next decade. He was elected to the Athenaeum in 1942 and elected FRS the following year; he was twice president of the Royal Entomological Society of London (1942&#150;3 and 1953&#150;5); and he was awarded the Mary Kingsley medal of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in 1949, and the gold medal of the Linnean Society in 1953. He was appointed CMG in 1947. He also served on the councils of the Royal Society, the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, the Royal Entomological Society, and the Zoological Society. In conjunction with his work with the colonial medical research committee, Buxton made two exhaustive tours in east Africa in 1945&#150;6, furthering his study of the tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis, and contributing to his <i>magnum opus</i>, <span class="italic">The Natural History of Tsetse Flies</span> (1955). From 1946 to 1949 he served as a member of the Medical Research Council.<br>
<br>Affectionately known as Buggy, Buxton had a strong and distinctive personality. Remembered as &#145;upright but humane&#146;, and prone to a &#145;slightly explosive temper&#146;  (Busvine, <span class="italic">Warmed Both Hands</span>, 93), he elicited respect and fear from contemporaries: &#145;Completely honest, considerate, and helpful to others, and with a quick wit and a lively sense of humour, he yet had an ironic and somewhat sarcastic manner which could strongly antagonize those who did not see beyond it&#146;  (Wigglesworth). He was intensely interested in all sides of natural history, and he was an enthusiastic and exotic gardener: his buttonhole was often adorned with a rare leaf or flower. All this was combined with a dislike of music, of poetry, and of philosophy, and a curious lack of interest in scientific generalizations. He had a fine command of English and wrote in a lucid unaffected style, and he was equally effective as a speaker, with a vivid descriptive power and a way of presenting even familiar matters in a new light.<br>
<br>After the death of Andrew, one of his two sons and four daughters, in 1952, Buxton seemed weakened. Three years later, he succumbed to bronchopneumonia and cancer of the prostate, and died on 13 December 1955, at his home, Grit Howe, South Park, Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. His funeral was held three days later at St James's, Gerrards Cross. His wife survived him.<br>
