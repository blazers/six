</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">O'Brien,  William Smith</span>  (1803&#150;1864), <span class="occ">Irish nationalist</span>, was born on 17 October 1803 at Dromoland Castle, near Newmarket-on-Fergus, co. Clare, the second son of Sir Edward O'Brien, fourth baronet (1773&#150;1837), and his wife, Charlotte (1781&#150;1856), elder daughter of William Smith of Cahirmoyle (or Cahermoyle). The author <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20454/', "Edward O'Brien")</script> was a younger brother. William was descended from the medieval Irish high king Brian B&oacute;ruma. In the eighteenth century the Dromoland O'Briens, a junior branch of the family, had played a leading role in the all-protestant Irish parliament and voted to end many of the penal laws against the Catholic majority. Sir Edward O'Brien opposed the 1800 <span class="roman">Act of Union</span> with Great Britain, but ultimately accepted it as a <i>fait accompli</i> and attended parliament at Westminster. William's maternal grandfather, an attorney providing loans to the O'Briens and other gentry, accumulated a large estate based on Cahirmoyle in co. Limerick. The decision of his parents to allocate to William his mother's property resulted in the addition of Smith to his name, though he normally signed himself William S. O'Brien.<br>
<br>O'Brien attended a preparatory school in Kent, and later accompanied his elder brother, Lucius (later thirteenth Baron Inchiquin), to Harrow School in 1813. In his later teens he studied at a private educational establishment run by a Mr Scott at Great Harborough, before following Lucius to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1821. He graduated in 1826 and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn in 1827. In 1828 Sir Edward nominated William for the pocket borough of Ennis. He joined his brother Lucius, sitting for County Clare. William, a more enthusiastic member than Lucius, made his maiden speech on 3 June 1828, supporting paper currency. Acceding to the wishes of his liberal tory father, O'Brien voted regularly with the Wellington ministry, but only after it had passed Catholic emancipation.<h2>
<a name="Firststepsinpolitics"></a>First steps in politics</h2>Irish politics were transformed when Daniel O'Connell won the 1828 County Clare by-election, defeating the senior member for County Clare, Vesey Fitzgerald, who was supported by the Dromoland O'Briens. O'Connell, disqualified as a Catholic, successfully encouraged the Catholic tenants to defy their landlords at the polls. In parliament on 3 July 1828, William supported Catholic claims and revealed his membership of O'Connell's Catholic Association, but deplored O'Connell's threat to the legitimate political interests of local co. Clare landlords. A careless statement that all Clare gentry had opposed O'Connell, re-elected after Catholic emancipation in 1829, led to a duel on 30 July 1829 with Thomas Steele, a minor Clare landholder who passionately supported O'Connell.<br>
<br>At the general election of 1830, Sir Edward O'Brien forced, against opposition, the re-election of William for the borough of Ennis, subsequently conceded to the O'Briens' ally Vesey Fitzgerald in the election of 1831. Meanwhile O'Brien fought a second duel with W. R. Mahon on behalf of his brother Lucius, accused of fabricating evidence against a political rival  (<span class="italic">Limerick Evening Post and Clare Standard</span>, 22 March 1831). Campaigning for his father, who tried to regain the seat of County Clare, O'Brien missed a vital division on the whig government's new <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span>, but he voted with the reformers on 19 April 1831. His <span class="roman">Irish Poor Law Bill</span> of 8 February 1831, supported by a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Plan for the Relief of the Poor in Ireland</span> (1831) was dropped. He was a founder member of Edward Gibbon Wakefield's National Colonisation Society and defended the East India Company's monopoly in a strongly imperialistic pamphlet, <span class="italic">Considerations Relative to the Renewal of the East-India Company's Charter</span> (1830). On 2 June 1840 he expounded Wakefield's views at length in the House of Commons, but the former's position on India had by then changed.<br>
<br>Out of parliament after 1831, O'Brien turned down an invitation to stand for the reformed borough of Ennis; he was about to leave co. Clare for co. Limerick. Having paid off his mistress, Mary Anne Wilton, with whom he appears to have had two children, on 19 September 1832 he married Lucy Caroline Gabbett (1811&#150;1861), eldest daughter of William Gabbett of High Park, co. Limerick, a former mayor of the city and an alderman until his death in 1864. The couple lived initially in Limerick City, where O'Brien achieved prominence campaigning for emigration, education, and port development. They then settled at Cahirmoyle with 5000 acres, where O'Brien, after joining O'Connell's Anti-Tory Association, was nominated by the Limerick Liberal Club. With its help he unseated a sitting member in the general election of 1835 and became an independent whig MP for County Limerick. He retained his seat easily in 1837; a tory petition, associated with the so-called &#145;Spottiswoode conspiracy&#146;, against Catholic clerical dictation on O'Brien's behalf was dropped. Normally voting with Melbourne's whig government, O'Brien continued to distance himself from O'Connell, despite the latter's support in the 1837 election. They differed on the need for an Irish poor law, O'Brien's desire to replace tithes to the minority Church of Ireland with payments to all churches, O'Brien's <span class="roman">Registration of Voters' Bill</span>, and O'Brien's opposition to repeal of the corn laws. O'Brien co-operated with Thomas Wyse on extensive non-denominational education reform.<br>
<br>O'Connell's partisans nearly forced O'Brien out of parliament in 1839, when the latter voted against Melbourne's bill to suspend the Jamaica assembly. Melbourne's government, co-operating with O'Connell on Irish reform, resigned in favour of Sir Robert Peel's tories. When a Limerick Liberal meeting demanded their errant member's resignation, O'Brien convened a public meeting which supported his continuation as MP. The &#145;bedchamber crisis&#146; returned the whigs to office, which they retained until they lost the 1841 election. While many Irish MPs supporting O'Connell were defeated, O'Brien was re-elected unopposed for County Limerick.<h2>
<a name="TheRepealAssociation"></a>The Repeal Association</h2>Although O'Brien had established his independence of O'Connell, he now moved closer to his rival. In 1843 O'Connell held a series of &#145;monster&#146; meetings throughout Ireland to demand repeal of the union. O'Brien resigned as JP on finding that others lost their commissions for attending O'Connell's gatherings. In June, O'Brien delivered a powerful speech, published by the Repeal Association, in which he indicted British rule in Ireland and urged religious equality, industrial development, and an extension of the franchise for Ireland. He foreshadowed an imminent mass conversion to repeal. In October 1843 O'Brien formally joined the association after O'Connell and his lieutenants had been charged with sedition.<br>
<br>With O'Connell's blessing, O'Brien acted as <i>de facto</i> leader of the Repeal Association during the former's trial and imprisonment until his conviction was overturned by the Lords in September 1844. Controlling the weekly Repeal Association meetings and establishing a parliamentary committee, which published a number of well-researched reports, O'Brien worked closely with a group of younger men led by Thomas Davis and associated with the influential <span class="italic">Nation</span> newspaper, edited by Charles Gavan Duffy.<br>
<br>Tension between &#145;Old&#146; and &#145;Young&#146; Ireland developed in early 1845, when Peel legislated for three Irish non-denominational university colleges. O'Brien and the Young Irelanders endorsed the principle, but O'Connell and his son John, supporting Catholic Archbishop John MacHale, were strongly opposed. Although O'Brien eventually voted against the bill when safeguards for Catholics were omitted, the Young Irelanders were now widely denounced as secularists.<br>
<br>In 1846 O'Brien was strongly backed by the Young Irelanders when incarcerated for twenty-five days by the House of Commons for refusing to serve on a Scottish railway committee, irrelevant to Ireland. Together they opposed O'Connell's overtures to Lord John Russell's new whig government. When the Young Irelander Thomas Meagher was silenced at the Repeal Association in August 1846 for attacking O'Connell's &#145;peace provisions&#146;, which renounced the use of violence in all places and at all times, O'Brien initiated a split by walking out.<br>
<br>The Young Irelanders reverted to newspaper propaganda, and O'Brien led by addressing his fellow landlords on &#145;Reproductive employment&#146;. Here O'Brien, exculpating his class from major responsibility for the great potato famine (1845&#150;9), demanded investment in Irish railways, colonization schemes, and useful works such as docks, piers, and canals. Local landlords, he claimed, were bankrupted by poor rates expended on futile relief schemes. In parliament O'Brien proved a relentless critic of Russell's <i>laissez-faire</i> famine administration which distributed quotations from Adam Smith instead of food.<br>
<br>After negotiations with O'Connell broke down in late 1846, O'Brien became the reluctant <i>de facto</i> leader of the Young Irelanders' Irish Confederation, established in January 1847. The death of O'Connell in May 1847 increased the bitterness between the Repeal Association, now controlled by John O'Connell, and the confederation, accused of hastening the demise of the &#145;Liberator&#146;. Leading a delegation to win over Orangemen in Belfast, O'Brien found his meetings disrupted by furious Catholics venerating O'Connell. At the general election of 1847 the Young Irelanders made little impact. Reluctant to stand again, O'Brien, in his absence, was narrowly re-elected for County Limerick.<h2>
<a name="Theroadtorebellion"></a>The road to rebellion</h2>While famine deepened, the Irish Confederation split in January 1848. John Mitchel, demanding a rate strike, refused to accept the ten resolutions for constitutional action drawn up by O'Brien with the support of Gavan Duffy. The French revolution of February 1848 brought temporary unity as O'Brien and Duffy made a volte-face in favour of physical force. After a mass demonstration in Dublin on 21 March 1848, when O'Brien demanded arms and a national guard, he and others were indicted for sedition. Awaiting trial, in late March, O'Brien led a delegation to France, but was rebuffed by Lamartine's provisional government. Addressing a furious House of Commons on 10 April, O'Brien denied seeking military aid from France, but admitted advising the Irish to arm and welcomed aid from the Chartists.<br>
<br>Stoned on 29 April in Limerick by a mob incensed at Mitchel's attacks on O'Connell, O'Brien recuperated at Cahirmoyle, and visited Dublin in bandages for his trial on 15 May. Like Meagher, he was discharged when his jury disagreed. On Mitchel's transportation for treason-felony on 27 May, O'Brien opposed an uprising in his favour. Instead, O'Brien promoted the union of the repealers and confederates in a new Irish League. Though not a member of the Dublin caucus planning rebellion in the autumn, or the elected executive of the clubs springing up to support the revolutionary movement, O'Brien welcomed the new Irish League with the question &#145;when will Ireland strike?&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Nation</span>, 17 June 1848). Unfortunately, his claim that the new organization embodied all the objects of the confederation encouraged John O'Connell and other repealers to hold back when the league met on 11 July.<br>
<br>O'Brien's hope for self-government through a show of force rather than insurrection was indicated by his leisurely tour of southern organizations in July 1848. At Cork he suggested that teaching men co-operation in bodies was more useful than instruction in military drill. O'Brien claimed to have been &#145;very cautious in the language used&#146;  (Davis, <span class="italic">William Smith O'Brien: Ireland&#150;1848&#150;Tasmania</span>, 21) at a meeting of the new Irish League in Dublin.<br>
<br>The whig government arrested several leading Young Irelanders, including Duffy, and on 22 July suspended habeas corpus. In Wexford, O'Brien, advised of a warrant for his arrest, recognized three choices: accept arrest, escape, or initiate rebellion. Honour required the third, though he later believed the first more appropriate. The enthusiasm of towns such as Enniscorthy, Kilkenny, and especially Carrick-on-Suir was not translated into active assistance. Attempting to gather support in the co. Tipperary villages of Ballingarry, Mullinahone, and Killenaule, O'Brien was followed by several thousand potential defenders, who dropped away when he refused to commandeer provisions and the Catholic priests advised against him. A minor success was achieved at Killenaule by forcing a troop of hussars to pass, one by one, through a barricade. At a council of war at the Boulah Commons on 28 July, O'Brien told his lieutenants to disperse. Later it was suggested that there was a move to depose, or even assassinate, O'Brien. His most revolutionary action was to threaten the owners of the Boulah coal mines with dispossession if they did not raise the wages of the miners and lower their prices.<br>
<br>On 29 July 1848 a party of forty-seven armed police, challenged by O'Brien's depleted force, barricaded themselves inside Widow McCormack's house at Farrenrory, near Ballingarry, taking her children as hostages. O'Brien was nearly killed in a parley with the police to secure the children when stone-throwing by his supporters evoked volleys of fire, killing two men. The rebel army disintegrated and O'Brien was obliged to escape on horseback when relief arrived for the police. Though pockets of resistance continued for some weeks in other areas, the rebellion was effectively over. The leaders were either arrested or forced to flee overseas. After being harboured for several days, O'Brien was arrested on 7 August at Thurles railway station, attempting to return home.<br>
<br>At Clonmel court house in October 1848 O'Brien and his three colleagues Thomas Meagher, Patrick O'Donohoe, and Terence MacManus were sentenced to death for high treason. An aura of martyrdom enveloped the bungled rebellion. For the next eight months the convicted leaders lived in relative comfort, mostly in Richmond prison. Public opinion precluded execution. O'Brien's appeal through a writ of error was rejected and he was formally expelled from the House of Commons. Hopes for an early pardon were dashed when the government, by special legislation, against the wishes of the prisoners, commuted the sentence to transportation for life to Van Diemen's Land.<h2>
<a name="OBrieninexile"></a>O'Brien in exile</h2>The journey of O'Brien and his three colleagues on the naval sloop <i>Swift</i> from Dublin to Van Diemen's Land, via the Cape of Good Hope, lasted from 9 July to 31 October 1849. O'Brien, unlike his companions, and three other Young Irelanders&#151;John Mitchel, Kevin O'Doherty, and John Martin&#151;initially refused to give his parole for a ticket-of-leave. As a result he was restricted to small cottages at the convict probation station at &Icirc;le Maria from November 1849 to August 1850, and the penal station of Port Arthur from August to November 1850. After two months' close confinement and isolation at &Icirc;le Maria, with very limited space for exercise, O'Brien's health deteriorated. Publicity on O'Brien's treatment fuelled a movement for his release, not only in the United Kingdom but also in the United States and Canada. Until an unsuccessful escape attempt in August 1850, he was allowed to take walks under supervision. In this period O'Brien was well treated by the superintendent, Samuel Lapham, and formed an embarrassing attachment to the latter's thirteen-year-old daughter Susan (later Susan Wood, an author). He read voraciously and kept a journal, later published as <span class="italic">&#145;To Solitude Consigned&#146;: the Tasmanian Journal of William Smith O'Brien</span> (1995). At Port Arthur, O'Brien was restricted to a small garden for exercise. He finally took his ticket-of-leave, urged by a petition to him from friends in Hobart. He also hoped to help Lapham, sacked for lenience towards him, and pay off debts incurred by the escape attempt. From November 1850 to February 1851, and from January 1852 to March 1854, O'Brien lived comfortably at Elwin's Hotel, New Norfolk. He entertained friends and Young Ireland colleagues, including John Mitchel, and made numerous house visits to local settlers, especially the Irish landowner and prominent local politician Captain Michael Fenton (1789&#150;1874), subsequently speaker of the Tasmanian house of assembly. From February to December 1851 O'Brien raised money by tutoring the sons of an Irish settler, Dr Henry Brock, at Red Rock, near Avoca.<br>
<br>O'Brien was living at Richmond when conditional pardons, forbidding domicile in the United Kingdom, arrived for himself, John Martin, and Kevin O'Doherty, the other four Young Irelanders having escaped. Having left Tasmania on 6 July 1854 after dinners in his honour, O'Brien attended receptions in Melbourne and Geelong before proceeding to Brussels, via Madras and Egypt. In Brussels he published his two-volume <span class="italic">Principles of Government, or, Meditations in Exile</span>, in which he gave a favourable account of transportation as a punishment and showed little of the Irish rebel and much of the Wakefield imperialist. He included a model constitution for a self-governing Tasmania, originally published anonymously in a local paper, the <span class="italic">Launceston Examiner</span> (30 August 1853).<br>
<br>While touring Greece with his eldest son, Edward, in May 1856, O'Brien learned of his unconditional pardon, assisted by a petition signed by MPs of all parties. He returned to Ireland on 6 July 1856 amid great rejoicing. He had travelled extensively through France, Italy, and Switzerland during his European exile.<h2>
<a name="ReturntoIreland"></a>Return to Ireland</h2>Back in Ireland, O'Brien was offered nominations for Tipperary and other seats but rejected them as he required time with his family and considered attendance at Westminster futile. He preferred to educate by press and pamphlet, never renouncing his 1848 principles, but insisting that physical force was impossible while England remained at peace. In 1862 he unsuccessfully challenged Sir Robert Peel the younger, then Irish chief secretary, to a duel for sneering at his behaviour at Ballingarry  (<span class="italic">The Nation</span>, 1 March 1862). Though he participated in the funeral service of his lieutenant Terence MacManus in 1861, O'Brien gave no countenance to the secret, revolutionary Fenians who deliberately exploited the occasion. Instead, O'Brien fulfilled his duties as a landlord, chaired the Newcastle West poor-law guardians, encouraged industrial development and the arts, and wrote many articles for <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, then edited by A. M. Sullivan. His fame as an elder statesman and a martyr for Ireland ensured respect for his opinions and demonstrations in his favour as he moved about the country.<br>
<br>Foreign affairs attracted much of O'Brien's attention. He denounced British repression during the Indian mutiny (1857), but was unsympathetic towards the Italian Risorgimento, and supported the papal temporal power. France under Napoleon III incurred his suspicions, and O'Brien debated with his fellow exile John Martin, who appeared to believe that war between France and England would help Ireland. O'Brien published the controversy in a pamphlet which effectively expressed his political philosophy, <span class="italic">Correspondence between John Martin and William Smith O'Brien, Relative to a French Invasion</span> (1861).<br>
<br>Most significant were O'Brien's views on America after a three-month tour of 7000 miles in the United States and Canada in early 1859. He encountered an enthusiastic response, not only from Irish Americans, but also from the leading politicians. Received by President James Buchanan, he met Lincoln's future secretary of state William Seward and future Confederate politicians, such as Alexander Stephens. He continued to deplore slavery in principle, though he was satisfied with what he saw in practice. In Canada he advised the French and Irish to work together. O'Brien expounded his experience in speeches in Dublin, later published as a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Lectures on America</span> (1860). After the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 O'Brien attempted to mediate between Seward, who politely rebuffed his suggestions for a ceasefire, and southern politicians. Though he disapproved of secession, O'Brien believed that, once a <i>fait accompli</i>, it could not be put down by force. The Irish should not be involved. He differed from his colleagues John Mitchel, an ardent partisan of the South, and Thomas Meagher, who commanded an Irish brigade for the North.<h2>
<a name="Lastyears"></a>Last years</h2>O'Brien's comfortable existence was destroyed on 13 June 1861 by the death of his wife, Lucy. In 1848, to avoid the confiscation of his property after conviction for treason, he had placed it in trust with his brother Lucius and friend Woronzow Greig. A bitter dispute arose when they were unable to allow O'Brien control after Lucy's death. A compromise accepted in Chancery conferred Cahirmoyle on O'Brien's son Edward William (1837&#150;1909), who agreed to pay his father the considerable annuity of &pound;2000. Still furious with the trustees, O'Brien sadly resigned his responsibilities in Limerick and took up residence in Killiney, near Dublin, but spent much of his time in European travel. In late 1861 he visited Hungary and saw in action Ferenz D&eacute;ak, working for the restoration of the ancient constitution denied by Austria. O'Brien approved heartily of D&eacute;ak's passive resistance, which achieved success in 1867. In 1863 O'Brien visited Poland and gave an address, in aid of Polish exiles, on the country's repression by Russia; this was published as another pamphlet, <span class="italic">Lecture on Poland</span> (1863).<br>
<br>At the Penrhyn Arms at Bangor in Wales, on 18 June 1864, O'Brien died of a heart attack apparently brought on by a liver complaint. Though the family endeavoured to prevent a popular demonstration at the funeral, vast crowds followed the coffin as it was borne through Dublin for transport by rail to Cahirmoyle. The funeral and interment in the family mausoleum at Rathronan churchyard, co. Limerick, took place on 24 June, with O'Brien's brothers-in-law the Revds J. and R. Gabbett, reading the service. In 1870 a statue of William Smith O'Brien by Thomas Farrell in Caravazzi marble was unveiled by John Martin. It now stands close to that of Daniel O'Connell in O'Connell Street, Dublin.<h2>
<a name="OBrieninperspective"></a>O'Brien in perspective</h2>O'Brien was 5 feet 11 inches tall, an athletic figure, running to corpulence in later years. Of dark complexion, his hair was dark brown and his eyes grey. He had a very light Irish accent. A keen linguist, he had broad literary and historical interests. Though speaking only English and French fluently, O'Brien could &#145;understand with more or less facility&#146; Latin, Greek (ancient and modern), Italian, German, Spanish, and the Gaelic of his ancestors, which he worked hard to acquire. In the right company he could be very sociable, and he was far from humourless. Although he was no rhetorician, O'Brien's speeches, logical and informative, were often enthusiastically received. He was proud of his prose, but not his poetry, of which he wrote a great deal. His writings show a sometimes vulnerable personality. O'Brien was no saint; apart from his &Icirc;le Maria dalliance, he had a mistress before marriage. His wife, Lucy, though otherwise devoted, had no sympathy with his politics. For his part, O'Brien showed some insensitivity by lecturing Lucy on her dislike of frequent pregnancies and lack of preparation for childbirth. Of their five sons and two daughters, only Robert Donough (1844&#150;1917) and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35276/', "Charlotte Grace O'Brien (1845&#150;1909)")</script> were publicly identified as Irish nationalists. As a father, Smith O'Brien, sometimes patriarchal, was relaxed towards ceremony and dress, and encouraged intelligence and the acquisition of marketable skills by his daughters. He allowed his daughter Lucy Josephine (1840&#150;1907) to study classical languages like her brothers. Married to the Revd John Gwynn, subsequently regius professor of divinity at the University of Dublin, Lucy became the ancestor of a line of eminent scholars.<br>
<br>Frankly admitting that pride was a serious failing, O'Brien declared: &#145;I should be a prouder man than I now am if I had been born the son of a chimney sweep, and had subsequently raised myself to distinction by my talents or by my public service&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Nation</span>, 27 Sept 1862). He balanced pride with sympathy towards Vandiemonian convicts, whom he saw as victims of their poverty-stricken environments. He opposed feudal behaviour such as the uncovering of peasants before gentry.<br>
<br>O'Brien's stubbornness, sincerity, and courage were universally acknowledged. He disclaimed originality, and acknowledged his adaptation of the ideas of others. Conservative in his basic thought, he was nevertheless prepared to modify opinions when convinced by argument. American democracy persuaded him to rethink some of his principles. As a liberal protestant, he was without sectarian prejudice. Supporting the common education of Catholics and protestants, he conceded public funds to Catholics if they insisted on separate institutions.<br>
<br>O'Brien has often been regarded as a noble, if wooden, idealist. He was in fact a pragmatist who, adapting to the O'Connellite revolution in Ireland, turned it to his advantage and restored the national reputation of his family. A scholar and a critic rather than a man of action, O'Brien in his politics paradoxically combined a devotion to Ireland's self-government and cultural identity with a consistent belief in the British empire. He sympathized with indigenous peoples, especially black South Africans and Australian Aborigines, but denied that they could legitimately exclude European emigrants from their under-utilized territories. His final political position, endorsing D&eacute;ak's passive resistance in Hungary, anticipated Arthur Griffith's &#145;Hungarian policy&#146; and the Sinn F&eacute;in movement after 1905.<br>
