<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Fraser,  Marjory  Kennedy-</span>  (1857&#150;1930), <span class="occ">folklorist</span>, was born at 50 High Street, Perth, on 1 October 1857, the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15365/', "David Kennedy (1825&#150;1886)")</script>, a great singer of traditional Scots songs, and his second wife, Elizabeth Fraser (<i>b</i>. 1827); their family eventually numbered eleven children. The Kennedys were originally from Rannoch, settled in Perth, moved to Edinburgh and then lived in London, 1862&#150;6. In 1866 they began a series of tours in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, and South Africa to take traditional Scots songs to emigrants and their descendants; they often travelled under fairly primitive conditions by coach or wagon, owing to the expense of taking such a large party by rail. Marjory trained as a piano accompanist in Edinburgh and made her first public appearances at Lanark in 1870, and the Music Hall, Edinburgh, in 1871. Visits for vocal training were made to Milan and Paris, where she was also taught the piano by Mathilde Marchesi. Disaster struck when three of the youngest members of the family died in a fire at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Italiens at Nice on 23 March 1881, a blow from which their father never recovered&#151;he died at Stratford, Ontario, on tour in October 1886. Meanwhile Marjory, whose maternal grandfather had spoken Gaelic in his youth, developed an interest in Gaelic songs, and, encouraged by Professor J. S. Blackie, took lessons in Gaelic and Gaelic songs from the poetess Mary MacKellar, who was then living in Edinburgh. In the spring of 1887 she married a cousin of her mother's, Alexander (Alec) Fraser, soon to be appointed headmaster of Alan Glen's Technical School at Glasgow; his health gave way from overwork and he died on 9 November 1890, leaving her with two children, David and Patuffa. She earned her living by teaching music in Edinburgh and as music critic for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Evening News</span>. She had a special interest in Wagner and Richard Strauss and visited Bayreuth in 1899. With her close associate, Professor Frederic Niecks, she founded the Edinburgh Musical Education Society in 1900.<br>
<br>In 1895 Marjory Kennedy-Fraser was asked to give a lecture recital on Celtic music, which involved presenting examples of the music of the various Celtic peoples. One work that impressed her was Ducoudray's collection of traditional Breton songs, which had been commissioned by the French government. In 1905, the last year of the life of the celebrated folklorist Father Allan McDonald, she paid what became a famous visit to the island of Eriskay, which lies in the sound between South Uist and Barra. She went at the urging of John Duncan the artist, and perhaps partly because an American folk-song collector, Evelyn Benedict, was already visiting the island, and another, Amy Murray, was expected to come in the autumn. She returned to Eriskay in 1907 and in that year gave her first recital based on her researches. She took with her to Eriskay &#145;a very small and easily portable graphophone&#146; and recorded songs on wax cylinders. In 1907&#150;8 and subsequently she recorded on Barra. The outcome of Mrs Kennedy-Fraser's visits to the Outer Hebrides were the three volumes of <span class="italic">Songs of the Hebrides</span> (1909, 1917, 1921), <span class="italic">Sea Tangle</span> (1913), <span class="italic">From the Hebrides</span> (1925), and <span class="italic">More Songs of the Hebrides</span> (1929). All except the last were compiled with the help of Kenneth MacLeod, a young theological student from the island of Eigg, who was found for her by Professor Donald MacKinnon as Gaelic amanuensis. MacLeod told the writer of this memoir that when he saw what she was doing to the songs he had wanted to withdraw from the collaboration, but that MacKinnon had persuaded him to continue. Her last visit to Barra was made in 1927.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Songs of the Hebrides</span> established Marjory Kennedy-Fraser's reputation; lecture tours and recitals in London and the United States followed. In 1911 she was given a civil-list pension to enable her to continue her work. She wrote the libretto for Granville Bantock's opera, <span class="italic">The Seal Woman</span>, and sang the part of Mary Macleod in it. Patronized by W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory, the friend of Patrick Geddes and John Duncan, she became a central figure in the Celtic revival, and <span class="italic">Songs of the Hebrides</span> is one of its enduring monuments. <span class="italic">Songs of the Hebrides</span> took such a hold on the public mind that any criticism of it was considered almost an act of <i>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</i>, and Mrs Kennedy-Fraser was wrongly given the credit of having saved the songs from oblivion. For a long time the only criticism of her method was made in a paper, &#145;Half a century of vocal Gaelic music&#146;, read by Malcolm MacFarlane to the Gaelic Society of Inverness on 27 March 1925:<blockquote>Mrs Kennedy Fraser's Collection is marred by the tunes being adapted to English words and by the liberties taken with their original forms; and they have, in cases, to be timed anew for the Gaelic singer. Also, the new words are often conceived in a false Gaelic spirit for which there is no valid excuse. Miss Frances Tolmie's excellent collection of Skye airs can be relied on as giving the tunes in accordance with the forms in which she found them. This collection is also too little used by singers. It was not, like some recent publications, conceived in a mercenary spirit for upper and middle class English consumpt, but was given for preservation to the English Folksong Society. It is Number 16 of that Society's Transactions. (<span class="italic">Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness</span>, 1927)</blockquote>It must be said in Mrs Kennedy-Fraser's favour that her <span class="italic">Songs of the Hebrides</span> did bring about an appreciation among English speakers of the beauty of the hitherto despised oral tradition of the highlands and islands.<br>
<br>In 1929 Marjory Kennedy-Fraser published a lively autobiography, <span class="italic">A Life of Song</span>. She was operated on for breast cancer in 1925 and died, from a recurrence of it, at 6 Castle Street, Edinburgh, on 22 November 1930.<br>
