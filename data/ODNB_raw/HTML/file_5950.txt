<span class="headword">Collins,  Samuel</span>  (1576&#150;1651), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was born at Eton College, Buckinghamshire, on 5 August 1576, the son of Baldwin Collins (1544&#150;1616), vice-provost of Eton and formerly a fellow of King's College, Cambridge. His younger brother, Daniel, followed in their father's footsteps, first as a fellow of King's, then at Eton. Samuel Collins studied at Eton from 1583 to 1591. At his entrance interview for King's College the provost, Roger Goad, was so impressed with his translation of Horace as to acclaim &#145;This is my child, who if he lives shall be my heir and successor&#146;  (A. A. Leigh, <span class="italic">King's College</span>, 1899, 97). Collins entered the college on 26 August 1591, became a fellow in 1594, graduated BA in 1596, and proceeded MA in 1599 and BD in 1605.<br>
<br>Collins was ordained deacon on 26 May 1605 and, against recent canon law, was made priest in the diocese of London a fortnight later, on 9 June. Chaplain to Archbishop Bancroft and, from 1610, to his successor, Abbot, he preached at Paul's Cross on All Saints' day 1607 as part of the debate over subscription. In his sermon, dedicated to Bancroft, he defended ceremonies as a moderate Calvinist, without making any case for their religious worth, while attacking Catholics for:<blockquote>sacrificing for sinnes of quicke and dead with a Wafer-Cake, treading down Kings, the deputies of God, from their throne of Maiestie to set up a foxie Intruder in their roome &hellip; taking away <span class="roman">Bibles</span>, mangling of Sacraments &hellip; selling pardons for sixe pence, soule ease for money, heaven at pleasure. (S. Collins, <span class="italic">Sermon at Paules-Crosse</span>, 1610, 53)</blockquote>For Abbot he undertook to support Lancelot Andrewes in his dispute with Cardinal Bellarmine, publishing his <span class="italic">Increpatio Andreae Eudaemono-Johannis Jesuitae</span> in 1612.<br>
<br>Collins defended three questions for his doctorate of divinity at the Cambridge commencement of 3 March 1613 against John Williams, later bishop of Lincoln. His performance prompted the comment that &#145;[N]o flood can be compared to the Spring-tide of his Language and Eloquence &hellip; these things will be living in the memory of the longest survivor that ever heard him&#146;  (Hacket, 24). His scholarship and Latinate wit, of which a few verses survive in print, brought him due reward. Rector of Fen Ditton in Cambridgeshire in 1614, held with the sinecure rectory of Milton until 1643, he was elected provost of King's College in April 1615. By 1617, when he produced his second substantial tome supporting Bishop Andrewes against the Jesuit Thomas Fitzherbert, <span class="italic">Epphata to F. T.</span>, he could include &#145;chapleine to His Majestie&#146; among his titles.<br>
<br>On 22 October 1617 Collins was elected regius professor of divinity at Cambridge, a chair he held until his death and for which he was able to draw a &pound;40 stipend from the rectory of Somersham, which James VI and I had annexed to it. He was also collated to a prebend at Ely on 19 February 1618, which he held until at least 1646. By about 1621 he had married a Cambridge widow, Susan Robinson, with whom he had two sons, James and John, both later fellows of King's. By 1621 he was no longer a royal chaplain. In December 1622 unsuccessful attempts were made to have him surrender the provostship to Sir Henry Wootton's nephew Albertus (Albert) Morton, an unsuccessful suitor for the provostship of Eton the following year. Collins was denounced by the college fellows to their visitor, Bishop John Williams, in 1628, for bribery, simony, and partiality in appointing Eton fellows. Williams found in his favour, attributing the rancour within the fellowship to the provost's &#145;slings of wit&#146;  (Hacket, 24), but indignation continued. Further complaints were heard before the chancellor, the earl of Holland, and, in December 1633, before Archbishop Laud. Yet Collins was a popular university lecturer who &#145;constantly read his Lectures twice a week &hellip;, giving notice of the time to his Auditors in a ticket on the School-doores, wherein never any two alike; without some considerable difference in the critical language thereof&#146;  (Fuller, <span class="italic">Worthies</span>, 133).<br>
<br>Collins undertook much work beautifying the chapel at King's College, in association with Thomas Weaver, whom he encouraged to provide the coats of arms for the unfinished stalls and for a raised wooden screen and reredos at the east end, and who certified in May 1629 that he had assigned &pound;100 in his will for the unfinished work. Queen Henrietta Maria was able to view &#145;the wondrous and stately structure&#146; of the work being undertaken in 1632  (Cooper, 3.250). The screen was completed by Lady day 1634. Collins paid towards a purple velvet communion cloth and for altar linen. By 1637 this open espousal of the beauty of holiness included the provision of altar candlesticks, tapers, and crucifixes. At much the same time Sir Henry Wootton warned Daniel Collins that his brother was subject to a court rumour that, &#145;either in a Sermon or in a Lecture or in some open place, with compagnie&#146;, Collins was traduced to have said that &#145;he was hartily gladd He had never spoken agaynst Transubstantiation in his whole lyfe hetherto And that he hoped to live till he might speake of it&#146;  (King's Cam., provosts' letters, IV, 10). Wootton seems to have been warning a friend of likely censure, and the two remained on good terms after Wootton had become provost at Eton, the latter sending Collins a portrait of the historian Paolo Sarpi as well as the Lambinus edition of Horace once owned by Pietro Bembo. A similar interest in anti-Calvinism is suggested by his support of his long-standing childhood friend Richard Mountague or Montagu, to whom he wrote warmly to congratulate him on his controversial elevation to the episcopate in 1628.<br>
<br>By 1640 Collins had moved the college altar and placed it tablewise, removed some of the chapel furniture, and prohibited adoration to the east. Such alterations were, however, too little and came too late. He was removed from the rectory of Fen Ditton and on 19 March 1644 he was charged with thirteen articles by a dozen witnesses under the earl of Manchester's commission to &#145;regulate&#146; the university and remove &#145;scandalous&#146; clergy within the eastern association counties. Mostly the complaints concerned ceremonialism, including bowing three times before reading the second service and also after his sermons, his beautifying the chapel at King's as well as his alleged habit of supplying his absence in the parish with malignant clergy, of advocating Sunday games, and of entertaining parishioners so well after the Sunday morning service that they &#145;spewed most shamefully&#146; at afternoon service  (<span class="italic">Walker rev.</span>, 78).<br>
<br>In January 1645 Collins was deprived of the provostship at the parliamentary visitation. With his professorial stipend, augmented with a small discretionary grant from his successor, Benjamin Whichcote, he lived in a house in St Rhadegund's Lane, on the other side of Cambridge. Later prudence prevented his becoming the last Caroline bishop, Charles I having nominated him bishop of Bristol in 1646, and allowed him to live among his books until his death at home, aged seventy-five, on 16 September 1651. He was buried in the same grave as Provost Hacomblen, in King's College chapel.<br>
