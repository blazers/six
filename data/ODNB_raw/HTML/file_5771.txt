<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cockburn,  Henry</span>, Lord Cockburn  (1779&#150;1854), <span class="occ">author and judge</span>, was born in or near Edinburgh, on 26 October 1779, the son of Archibald Cockburn (<i>d</i>. 1820), and his wife, Janet Rannie. His father was one of the learned lairds who made up the country's <i>noblesse de robe</i>, a sheriff of Edinburghshire and a baron of Scotland's court of exchequer, a queller of riots, and a tory: Archibald Cockburn was the cousin and brother-in-law of Henry Dundas&#151;minister of the younger Pitt and pro-consul of North Britain&#151;and his marriage was witnessed by Dundas and by the ferocious judge Lord Braxfield, later arraigned in the writings of his son. Cockburn's principal vein was narrative history, the annals of his time, with reminiscence giving way eventually to the journal record of &#145;occurrences as they have arisen&#146;. But he was a man of many parts, and his first fame was achieved as an advocate and politician who became a judge and a minister of the crown and who was a participant witness of two profoundly interesting public contentions: the passing of the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in 1832 and the Disruption of 1843, when schism struck the Church of Scotland over the issue of patronage&#151;decried as the intrusive appointment by landlords of ministers of the kirk.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlyinfluences"></a>Education and early influences</h2>Cockburn (nicknamed Cocky) attended Edinburgh high school and Edinburgh University, where he came under the influence of the moral philosopher Dugald Stewart, and shone as a debater in the university's Speculative and Academical societies. His experiences at what he remembered as a brutal, flogging school were to be reflected in the part he played in the foundation of an alternative institution, the Edinburgh Academy, in 1823 (he was also to serve as rector of Glasgow University and as a founder of the Commercial Bank, and was to have an Edinburgh street named after him). His education was summarized in one of his inspired exaggerations: he was &#145;kept about nine years at two dead languages which we did <i>not</i> learn&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 19).<br>
<br>In 1796 Cockburn's father approached Dundas with a request that the small sinecure of presentership of signatures be bestowed on his son, in order to assist his legal studies. &#145;Your namesake Henry,&#146; wrote Archibald Cockburn, &#145;in spite of every remonstrance and some degree of severity on my part, persists in being a limb of the Law&#146;  (Miller, 56). The post was denied him, but Cockburn persevered, and he passed advocate in 1800. He began to practise at the time when the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, edited by Francis Jeffrey, began to appear. Jeffrey and John Richardson, a solicitor poet, were his closest friends, and Jeffrey's virtues are sung in his correspondence and in his <span class="italic">Life of Lord Jeffrey</span> (1852).<br>
<br>Cockburn testified that the 1790s were a time when the life of his community was steeped in a single event&#151;the French Revolution. This event, and the sedition trials which were aimed at the punishment of Jacobin and reformist sympathies and which are discussed in a book of his published in 1888, helped to make a whig of him, to turn him, politically, against &#145;my kindred&#146;. He shared Jeffrey's perception of a growing struggle between the aristocracy and democracy of Britain, and his wish for an accommodation, for the &#145;tranquillity&#146; which the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> was later designed to secure. A decade after the presentership affair, the Dundases offered Cockburn a post as one of the lord advocate's deputes, which he accepted on the understanding that party loyalty would not be expected of him. His political opinions were deemed &#145;a mere youthful fervour&#146; by his kin; his fear that they might think so &#145;only made the fervour warmer&#146;. In 1810 he was sacked for insubordination. The following year, Dundas wrote of Cockburn's whiggery: &#145;Nobody can give me a reason how it began or why it continues&#146;  (Fry, 305).<h2>
<a name="Areformingadvocate"></a>A reforming advocate</h2>Cockburn's main purposes as a reformer were to bring about a wider parliamentary franchise, more and fairer juries, and an elected clergy. Parliamentary reform meant the enfranchisement of &#145;wealth and sense&#146;. It also meant the prevention of revolution, and indeed of democracy. In his fervour, Cockburn foresaw a Scottish millennium over which flew the whig flag of &#145;sense and justice&#146;. And yet his adult years can be considered those of a divided man. He was in love with the old feudal Scotland he was determined to change. His reason was with &#145;the modern world&#146;; his dreams were with &#145;the old one&#146;. His love for the old one is affirmed in the <span class="italic">Memorials</span>, which he started to prepare shortly after his father's death in 1820, at the point when northern politics awoke from the spell of Dundas-ship and &#145;our Scotch progress&#146; started to accelerate; and his darkening view of the aftermath of reform is projected in the <span class="italic">Journal</span>. Cockburn's contradictions were an important aspect of his life. He was a patrician iconoclast, an Anglophile Scots patriot, and a classical romantic. He was both the enemy and the friend of Scotland's landlords.<br>
<br>In March 1811 Cockburn married Elizabeth MacDowall and set up his rural household gods at Bonaly in the lee of the Pentland hills, to the south-west of Edinburgh. Five daughters and six sons were born. His house in Charlotte Square stood at the heart of Edinburgh's new town, then under construction, from which he would sometimes recoil, thinking it unromantically commercial and mathematical. &#145;Nature and romance&#146; were pursued at Bonaly, Cockburn's more modest Abbotsford, a farmhouse augmented by a peel tower. Bonaly was a convivial place, with its &#145;bouzes&#146; and &#145;bowlifications&#146;. But it was also a place where this public man could shed what he saw as the needful &#145;pugnacity&#146; of his political and professional involvements, and be by himself. As did his recourse to the past, the Pentlands belonged in some measure to the category of dreams.<br>
<br>Cockburn's country pleasures are embodied in a series of youthful poems. These show none of that hostility to Romanticism for which the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> has been blamed, and can be credited with a feeling for Wordsworth. Extracts from &#145;Tintern Abbey&#146; are the opening items in a commonplace book, a huge cento of favourite passages of verse, copied out by Cockburn and a circle of Pentlands friends and friends of the Pentlands, of whigs and of whig romantics.<br>
<br>Cockburn was an admired advocate, and was depicted as gaining the trust of juries by displays of homeliness, and by pleading in Scots and, at times, in tears. Two of his greatest occasions were his appearances for James Stuart of Dunearn, in 1822, and, seven years later, for Helen MacDougal, the companion of body-snatching Burke, the &#145;resurrectionist&#146; serial killer. Stuart had shot dead Boswell's son Alexander in a party-political duel, and Cockburn's defence was reckoned a masterpiece of forensic praise and pathos; at the time of the Burke and Hare trial, Stuart, once &#145;thought so pure and firm&#146;, as Cockburn observed, was revealed as a speculator who had run off to America in debt. Cockburn also spoke for western weavers accused of sedition. One of their number, Alexander Richmond, supported by Cockburn and Jeffrey, would appear to have served as a government spy.<br>
<br>With reference to Scotland's special backwardness in electoral matters, and to the crisis which overtook the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> in 1832, Cockburn wrote:<blockquote>The feeling of Scotland, whose <i>all</i>, as to representation, was at stake, was deep, intense and grave &hellip; It was an old covenanting business with them; who the <span class="roman">Reform Bill</span> brought literally out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. (Miller, <span class="italic">Millennium</span>, 36)</blockquote>This business was soon to succeed, and thus abolish the supremacy evoked in the best-known passage of the <span class="italic">Memorials</span>: &#145;Within this Pandemonium sat the town-council, omnipotent, corrupt, impenetrable. Nothing was beyond its grasp; no variety of opinion disturbed its unanimity, for the pleasure of Dundas was the sole rule for every one of them&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memorials</span>, 87&#150;8). A Venetian cast is imparted here to Edinburgh's town council. In 1823, in the course of a continental tour, he had seen Venice for himself: by then, the &#145;impenetrable&#146; mystery and secrecy which had enclosed the regime of the Doges, according to certain historians of the time, had been extinguished by Napoleon.<h2>
<a name="Churchreformandlawreform"></a>Church reform and law reform</h2>As Scotland's solicitor-general and lord advocate respectively, in the Grey administration of 1830&#150;34, Cockburn and Jeffrey were charged with drafting the <span class="roman">Scottish Reform Bill</span>. For both men &#145;benchification&#146; took place in 1834, and as lords of session they were caught up in a further momentous struggle. The evangelical (or &#145;wild&#146;) party had won an ascendancy in the general assembly of the Church of Scotland, and their opponents in the country, the moderates, were to challenge on civil grounds the Church legislation in favour of popular election in the kirks, which resulted from their ascendancy. This became a question of controverted parishes and disputed pastoral &#145;calls&#146;. The battle of wills lasted until 1843, when the &#145;wild&#146; (some 200 ministers and elders, almost half of the general assembly) broke away to form the Free Church.<br>
<br>For Cockburn, kirk was country, and his <span class="italic">Journal</span> accounts of the Disruption make this clear, as do the votes he cast in the course of the court's relevant adjudications. Patronage was the law of the land, and he could take the view that the court was asserting a rightful claim in respect of temporalities&#151;manses and livings. But he could also see it as overreaching itself. The anti-intrusionist cause was, like parliamentary reform, a modern example of the old covenanting business of the seventeenth century. His was a patriotic piety. He was an opponent of religious intolerance, and was displeased by &#145;covenanting sublimities&#146; and by the bletheraciousness of the cloth; but he was moved by the courage and idealism of the departing ministers and their flocks.<br>
<br>Among Cockburn's writings in the field of law reform is a discussion in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> (April 1830) of the state of the Scottish legal system. The introduction of juries in civil causes, as in English law, was one of his foremost concerns. A civil jury court was formed in 1815 and was later merged with the court of session. Cockburn argued against the judiciary's power to pack juries, and against the exercise of its &#145;native vigour&#146;&#151;in effect, a law-making capacity, which had developed in reaction to a parliamentary neglect of Scotland. While harbouring mixed feelings on the subject, he welcomed the end of entails, seen as a constraint on capital investment.<br>
<br>Cockburn took a by no means progressive interest in the poor laws of his time, and questioned (in vain) the assessment of landowners in order to relieve distress, believing that compulsory provision on a regular basis tends &#145;to increase the very evil which it is meant to cure&#146;  (<span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span>, October 1824). He was in sympathy with the position taken by one of his statesmanlike sages, the evangelical leader Thomas Chalmers, with regard to the virtues of self-help, as exemplified between 1819 and 1823 in the Glasgow parish of St John's. On the question of trade-union combination, he judicially upheld the innocence of strikes, while saying of one aspect of their coerciveness: &#145;It is <i>impossible</i> to defend a combination which is kept up by concussing me to join it&#146;  (Miller, 42).<br>
<br>The modern world, with the swiftness of its railroads and its mass migration to urban centres, reminded Cockburn of a well-known Scottish whirlpool: &#145;All things now are melted in one sea&#151;with a strong Corryvreckan in it, sweeping everything towards the metropolis&#146;  (<span class="italic">Journal</span>, 2.91). There were improvements which he abhorred, such as &#145;furious communication&#146;, and he was an early environmentalist whose concern for his native city gave rise to the modest proposal set out in his &#145;Letter to the lord provost on the best ways of spoiling the beauty of Edinburgh&#146; (1849). He was drawn to the new art of photography, and was portrayed not only in oils by Sir Henry Raeburn, in 1819, but in the calotypes of Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson.<h2>
<a name="Reputationandachievement"></a>Reputation and achievement</h2>A pugnacious and triumphant reformer like Cockburn was bound to arouse an answering pugnacity; lawyers in particular have sometimes been keen to put him on trial. A certain impatience on the bench, and an inaptitude for the intricacies of feudal law and the practicalities of Scottish life, have been laid at his door. Errors committed in the huddled circumstances which vexed the drafting of the <span class="roman">Scottish Reform Bill</span> have been thought to have subverted, and inverted, its designed effects. Among his critics was Patrick Fraser, who spoke of his indolence and love of enjoyment. The House of Lords, on appeal, sustained judgments of his which had been reversed by his colleagues at the court of session, and Fraser says of this: &#145;The utterly untechnical character of his mind made his judgements read in the eyes of a foreign lawyer with a force not due to their intrinsic merits&#146;  (Miller, 51, 248). But it was also said in mitigation that no one by &#145;fits and starts&#146; could make greater efforts. His alleged indolence might seem to be corroborated by a story which supposes him to have told a Pentlands shepherd, &#145;If I were a sheep, I would lie on the sunny side of the hill&#146;, and to have received the reply: &#145;Ah, my Lord, but if ye was a sheep, ye would hae mair sense.&#146; The same reply was said by John Buchan, in 1940, to have been directed by a border shepherd at Gladstone.<br>
<br>Like other prominent Scotsmen of his generation, such as James Stuart and Walter Scott, Cockburn fell into debt, and late in life he was smitten with the need to retrench. A testament of 1847 states that &#145;there cannot be another shilling of debt&#146;, and that &#145;I can be plucked by sons no more&#146;. The theme of an estranged kinship was one which stayed with him throughout his life. He died at Bonaly on 26 April 1854 and was buried in Dean cemetery. After his death, Bonaly and its contents were sold. Three years earlier Cockburn had written to a friend that he had had a very happy life.<br>
<br>For reasons of discretion Cockburn burnt many of his papers, and a son destroyed the original manuscripts for the <span class="italic">Memorials</span> and the <span class="italic">Journal</span>, derived from four &#145;red books&#146; of his which have also gone. For similar reasons, the <span class="italic">Memorials</span> was pruned of some of Cockburn's outspokenness by its sheriff editors, Archibald Davidson and Thomas Cleghorn. Nevertheless, specimens of his writing which contain expurgated material have survived, as has a body of unpublished letters to friends. His portrait of the judge Lord Eskgrove, magnificent in its abbreviated form, is even more so as originally intended. In the passage that follows, deleted expressions that might have come from Cockburn's great-great-grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36788/', "Evelyn Waugh")</script> are restored and shown in italics:<blockquote>His eyes were blue, and half cunning, half maudlin; the under lip enormous, and supported on a huge clumsy chin, which moved like the jaw of an exaggerated Dutch toy; his nose prodigious, <i>and absolutely purple with lust and liquor</i>. He walked with a slow, stealthy, sinister step, <i>as if conscious he was going to do what was wrong</i>&#151;something between a walk and a hirple, and helped himself on by short movements of his elbows, backwards and forwards, like fins (Bell, 176)</blockquote>The power of Cockburn's calm and confident prose is evident here, together with its pungent idiosyncrasy, which is also evident in an epistolary passage on the removal of a public lavatory when his heavenly city of Edinburgh was undergoing its process of extension, a removal which coincided with the motion for reform in the Augean stables of the House of Commons: &#145;I must confess that walking out yesterday to the Foul Brig I saw the sun glittering three times on a large, distant, whitish object, which, being neared, turned out to be a bum.&#146; This is the Cockburn who beheld George IV, at his Holyrood levee of 1822, &#145;in a <i>kilt</i> !!! &hellip; Bare or trousered, the knees were undoubtedly philabegged&#146;  (Bell, 14, 177).<br>
<br>Cockburn did something to bring about a more widely representative politics and a more responsible public life, and he took part in a struggle which embroiled the law of the land, the government of the day, and a national institution intent on its independence. He was a superb historian of these exemplary conflicts. No less valuable are his accounts of the manners of his day&#151;of the regional Scotland described in his <span class="italic">Circuit Journeys</span> (1888), and of the seasonal Edinburgh life of his adult years. In summer, at Bonaly, &#145;we sauntered in the twilight of a mild, milky evening, amid a glorious profusion of breathing roses of every description&#146;  (Miller, 67). But winter had its glories too: &#145;Fall, thou snow&#151;blacken, thou surly dark-souled night! Is it not Saturday? Have we not coals and claret, talk and time?&#146;  (Bell, 21).<br>
<br>Such raptures may occasionally be thought to smack of the &#145;withering self-sufficiency&#146; ascribed by Sir Archibald Alison to these Scottish whigs. But Cockburn and Jeffrey were, as Scott in his toryism conceded, extraordinary men, and so were their friends, in whom, as in Cockburn and Jeffrey themselves, the likeness of a latter-day Scottish Enlightenment can be found. Cockburn was sombre and thoughtful, as well as happy, as well as supple and wiry and sparkling, and he was no crony. With new and enlarged editions of his annals, and with a collected edition of his letters, a wider recognition of his qualities might be hoped for. An attempt was made to contribute to this in publications of the mid-1970s, where he was praised as the Tacitus of Scotland.<br>
