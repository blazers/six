<span class="headword">Lynde, Sir  Humphrey</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1579, <em>d.</em> 1636), <span class="occ">religious controversialist</span>, was baptized on 24 August 1579 at St Margaret's, Westminster, London, the eldest of four sons and two daughters of Cuthbert Lynde (<i>d</i>. 1608), latterly a prominent member of the Grocers' Company and citizen of London, and his wife, Margery, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Baylie (<i>d</i>. in or after 1608). He was educated at Westminster School, being a queen's scholar and victor, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1597 and graduated in 1600. He began his MA, being one of the two bachelors chosen for the influential university post of collectors, who divided the determining bachelors into classes and organized their disputations. According to Anthony Wood he continued no further because a relative left him an estate. In June 1601 he was admitted to the Middle Temple, London. His father's death in 1608 brought him appreciable wealth.<br>
<br>By young manhood Lynde had come to a very strong protestant faith, and he became increasingly widely read in theology. On 31 January 1610 he married at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Alexander Brett (<i>d</i>. 1609) of Whitestaunton, Somerset, and his wife, Anne Gifford. The family was a recusant one, but Lynde evidently claimed Elizabeth for protestantism. Daniel Featley described this as a match<blockquote>made in heaven before it was consummate on earth, for he affianced his Spouse to Christ before he contracted her to himselfe &hellip; and by thus uniting her to himselfe by spirituall as well as carnall bonds, he had her heart knit unto him to his last breath: and in the Kalendar which hee made of all Gods blessings, &hellip; he put her as the chiefest. (Featley, 215)</blockquote>They had three surviving sons and six daughters.On 11 November 1613 Lynde was knighted at Royston by James I, according to John Chamberlain on payment of &pound;500. By 1614 he and his wife owned the manor of Clapham, Surrey, which they sold. He may then have leased a house at Twickenham, Middlesex, where several children were born between 1618 and 1626. He inherited or bought land in Cobham, Surrey, which became his country home, and became a JP and commissioner in the shire. His close friendship with Richard Chamberlain, clerk of the wards on the court of wards and liveries, and with Sir Walter Pye, king's attorney there, make it possible that they were once colleagues. He became MP for Brecknockshire in 1626, when Sir Walter decided to sit for Herefordshire after being elected for both. He was active on committees connected with religion, such as that considering if Bishop Richard Mountagu's books were harmful, and one on excommunication, besides those on local and general issues, but in 1628 apparently stood down in favour of Sir Walter's son.<br>
<br>Lynde could have held higher office, but preferred to devote much of his time to theology. His views caused him to become friends with the earls of Lincoln and Warwick, Sir Henry Hastings, Thomas Gataker, Daniel Featley (chaplain to Archbishop George Abbot), and probably others in his circle. He always accepted the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England, and wanted to receive communion kneeling when mortally ill, praying, &#145;O Lord, accept the will for the deed: I bow the knees of my heart unto thee, though I cannot of my body&#146;  (Featley, 217).<br>
<br>In 1623 his cousin Edward Bugges sought Lynde's help, when conversion to Roman Catholicism was pressed on him on the grounds that there was no protestant church before Luther, and no salvation apart from Rome. Ultimately, finding Bugges with the Jesuit John Fisher, Lynde debated these questions with him. Later he invited Dr Featley and Dr Francis White, dean of Carlisle, to his London house in Sheer Lane for an after-dinner debate with Fisher and others in the presence of his family, friends, and Bugges, with carefully minuted proceedings. After four hours Fisher refused to answer. The king was pleased, and ordered Featley to publish <span class="italic">The Roman Fisher Caught</span> (1624), but forbade further debate.<br>
<br>That year Lynde began contributing to the wider controversy about whether the Roman church was a true one by publishing material defending Anglican theology, starting with <span class="italic">The Book of Bertram the Priest</span> (1623), a translation of a Carolingian work which maintained that the eucharist gave spiritual food, but denied transubstantiation. This was followed in 1625 by his first original work, <span class="italic">Antient Characters of the Visible Church</span>. In 1628 these arguments were developed in <span class="italic">Via tuta, or, The Safe Way</span>, dedicated to the religious and well-affected gentry of the realm, and were argued very lucidly and succinctly in short chapters. Lynde attacked Roman Catholicism for deviating from the faith and practice of the early church, and, by the Council of Trent, for making articles such as the papal supremacy, which he argued was contrary to scripture and early church history, an essential part of Roman faith. He contended that from the seventh century the Roman church had deviated gradually from apostolic faith over such matters as vernacular service and &#145;worship&#146; of images, whereas the Anglican church was now true to original Christian doctrine, and was therefore the safe way to salvation. Lynde followed this in 1630 with <span class="italic">Via devia</span> in a similar format. This was dedicated to the &#145;ingenuous&#146; and moderate Romanists of the kingdom, offering to accept a heretic's punishment if he did not prove the faith he professed ancient and catholic. He attacked Rome's inconsistency in stating its faith was scriptural, yet preventing the laity from reading the <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and suggested its real motivation was to stop people discovering how their doctrine was contradicted by scripture. He contended that most erroneous Roman Catholic doctrine was based on tradition and lacked antiquity and universality, and that the most substantial part of Roman teaching did not derive from the primitive church and was not accepted by the early fathers and councils. Since it had not been called by the emperor, and was neither general nor free, the Council of Trent was invalid.<br>
<br>These two works constituted almost a new genre, written by a cultivated gentleman for his peers, and enjoyed wide and lasting fame and influence. Sir Francis Herris mentions <span class="italic">Via tuta</span> as having brought about his conversion in 1628. Both books were translated into French in 1645, and were much reprinted in Britain, including a nineteenth-century edition to stem conversions from Anglo-Catholicism to Roman Catholicism. <span class="italic">Via tuta</span> was also contemporaneously translated into Dutch and Latin. In response to Lynde, John Floyd, sometimes identified with the Jesuit Robert Jenison, published <span class="italic">A Pair of Spectacles for Sir Humphrey Linde to See his Way Withal</span> (1631), arguing that he had failed to show where the Anglican church was before Luther. Lynde replied with <span class="italic">A Case for the Spectacles</span>, published posthumously as Laud refused to license it earlier, allegedly because he was a layman, but probably because he disagreed with its theology. John Heigham contributed with <span class="italic">Via vere tuta</span> (1631), largely invective which does not seriously answer Lynde's arguments; and other similar works followed. After his death Featley contributed to the debate with <span class="italic">Stricture in Lyndomastigem</span>, defending his friend's views and strengthening the anti-popery and anti-Arminian arguments of the time.<br>
<br>Lynde suffered violent fits and terrifying pains in his last illness, possibly as a result of prostate and brain cancer, but remained lucid. He made a final public profession of faith to prevent any rumours that he had been reconciled to Rome. He reported to his wife and Featley that he had seen a vision of himself presented before God in a shining damask robe. He died at Cobham on 8 June 1636, and was buried in the chancel of the parish church on 14 June, survived by his wife.<br>
