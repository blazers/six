<span class="headword">Pell,  William</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1634, <em>d.</em> 1698), <span class="occ">clergyman and ejected minister</span>, was born at Sheffield and baptized there on 1 February 1634, the son of William Pell. After attending the grammar school at Rotherham, Yorkshire, Pell was admitted as a sizar on 29 March 1651 at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where his tutor was Joseph Hill. He was elected scholar on 2 June 1654 and fellow 3 November 1656, having graduated BA in 1655. By a patent dated 15 May 1656 he was appointed as a tutor in the new college at Durham founded by Oliver Cromwell, and he was awarded his Cambridge MA in 1658. He was ordained by Ralph Brownrigg, bishop of Exeter, probably at Sonning, Berkshire, and on 13 April 1659 he was admitted to the sequestered rectory of Easington, Durham. At the Restoration the Durham college collapsed and Gabriel Clark, the sequestered rector of Easington, was restored.<br>
<br>On 11 February 1660 at Bishopwearmouth, Durham, Pell married Elizabeth (<i>bap</i>. 1638, <i>d</i>. 1707/8), daughter of George Lilburne of Sunderland and first cousin of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16654/', "John Lilburne")</script>; their daughter Elizabeth was born at Great Stainton, Durham, on 30 July 1662. Two years earlier, on 20 July 1660, Pell had been presented to the rectory of that parish, but he was ejected within a month of his daughter's birth under the <span class="roman">Act of Uniformity</span>. He and his family remained in the county and his friends urged him to use his considerable scholarly talents, particularly as an orientalist, in a new and unofficial attempt to begin again the introduction of university learning in the north-east. But Pell refused, in the belief that he was bound by the terms of his Cambridge graduation oath, and it was Richard Frankland who shouldered the task of founding a northern academy. On 1 May 1672 Pell was granted a licence as a presbyterian teacher at his house in Durham or any other licensed place. Almost immediately Dr Isaac Basire, a prebendary of the cathedral and JP of the county, wrote to London complaining that Pell had preached at a conventicle at the house of a Mr Orton on 12 and 19 May, but had failed either to show his licence or to attend the justices for examination. Pell's continuing activities within sight of the cathedral spire provoked the fury of Archdeacon Denis Granville, who wrote from Durham on 5 July 1674 complaining against &#145;one Pell, a preacher in the times of rebellion, who hath the confidence to set up a congregation at our gates, and though excommunicated, dares to christen children, and ventures on other sacred offices&#146;. Such practices, being &#145;extremely unusual in this place, are thereby extremely scandalous&#146;; and Granville asked for official confirmation that he and other justices of the peace could &#145;proceed against schismatics according the last Act of Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ambrose Barnes</span>, 141).<br>
<br>It may have been soon after the archdeacon's request that Pell &#145;was imprisoned at Durham for his nonconformity: and removed himself to London by an Habeas Corpus; and was set at liberty by Judge Hales. He then lived in the northern parts of Yorkshire and practised physic&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Abridgement</span>, 2.289). Later he was reported to be preaching at Tattershall, Lincolnshire; perhaps this was after he gained employment as a domestic steward to Edward Clinton, fifth earl of Lincoln, which would have afforded some protection against arrest. Under King James's declaration of indulgence in 1687 Pell became minister to the nonconformists at Boston, Lincolnshire, where in 1690 there were reported to have been &#145;2 or 300 auditors in the afternoone; they raise him about &pound;60 per annum, but begin to be weary of soe much, since the death of some of the better sort&#146;  (Gordon, 70). In early 1691 Pell was canvassed to be minister of a congregation at Darlington, but did not take it up. In 1694, however, he did return to the north-east, becoming assistant to Richard Gilpin at Newcastle upon Tyne. There he died on 2 December 1698 and was buried on 6 December at St Nicholas's Church. His wife survived him by nearly ten years and was buried on 30 January 1708.<br>
