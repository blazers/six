<span class="headword">Holttum,  (Richard) Eric</span>  (1895&#150;1990), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 20 July 1895 in Linton, Cambridgeshire, the eldest in the family of two sons and one daughter of Richard Holttum, grocer and owner of a village general store, and his wife, Florence Bradley. His parents being Quakers, he was educated at the Friends' school, Saffron Walden, Essex, and then at Bootham School, York. He wrote in 1980 that his Quaker schooling &#145;conveyed a sense of responsibility and of respect for other people based on some appreciation of the spiritual basis of all living&#146;. His long life of public service and research had that foundation. In 1914 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, with a scholarship to study botany, physics, and chemistry. He obtained a first class in part one of the natural sciences tripos in 1916. The horror of the First World War led him to join in 1916 the Friends' Ambulance Unit, in which he served with the French army on the western front. In 1919 he received the Croix de Guerre. He returned to Cambridge, gaining first-class honours in part two of the tripos (botany) in 1920 and was awarded the university's Frank Smart prize.<br>
<br>In 1920 Professor Albert C. Seward appointed Holttum as his assistant and as a junior demonstrator in botany at Cambridge, and together they went to Greenland in 1921 to investigate in fossil deposits its former tropical flora. Holttum was appointed assistant director of the botanic gardens, Singapore, in 1922. The Singapore herbarium was in a chaotic state and the general state of fern taxonomy was likewise unsatisfactory, with current classifications inconsistent, genera ill-defined, and specific descriptions inadequate. Holttum's research to remedy this led to his extensive fundamental pteridological publications. In 1925 he became director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. An indefatigable field botanist, he was also a far-sighted, energetic administrator, intent on both botanical investigation and the encouragement of gardening in Malaya. Holttum used the method of raising orchid seedlings on nutrient media in glass test-tubes and flasks to raise new orchid hybrids. Out of his enterprise grew the important orchid-growing industry of Malaya. In 1927 he married an artist, Ursula (<i>d</i>. 1987), daughter of John William Massey, gentleman farmer at Finchingfield, Essex. They had two daughters.<br>
<br>After the Japanese conquest of Singapore in July 1942, Holttum's fate and that of the Singapore Botanic Gardens were determined by Emperor Hirohito's instruction that such scientific institutions be maintained. Professor Hidezo Tanakadate ordered Holttum and the assistant director to continue their work. Later in 1942 Professor Kwan Koriba took over the administration. He treated Holttum &#145;with much kindness&#146;, as Holttum gratefully acknowledged, and for the next three years encouraged his scientific research on orchids, gingers, ferns, and bamboos, for which he previously had had too little time. Conscious, however, of the hardships of internees while he himself was exceptionally privileged, Holttum requested to be interned also, but Koriba ordered him to continue with research. Nevertheless his isolation caused him acute mental distress, near to utter despair. After the Japanese surrender in September 1945 Holttum returned to England to recuperate. He then resumed direction of the neglected Singapore Botanic Gardens, resigning in 1949 to become the first professor of botany in the newly founded University of Singapore, where he proved to be an enthusiastic and inspiring teacher. Never wasting time, he published <span class="italic">Plant Life in Malaya</span> (1954), <span class="italic">Gardening in the Lowlands of Malaya</span> (1953), and <span class="italic">Orchids of Malaya</span> (1953). With his department established and thriving, Holttum retired in 1954, returned to England, settled at Kew, and worked in the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, principally on tropical ferns, until his death. His <span class="italic">Ferns of Malaya</span> (1955) was the prelude to major work on the ferns of Malaya, Indonesia, New Guinea, and the Philippines for the <span class="italic">Flora Malesiana</span> (section Pteridophyta). About 110 of his 500 or more publications on botany and horticulture relate to ferns, and all manifest his meticulous attention to detail, originality, and breadth of outlook.<br>
<br>Holttum was made an honorary Cambridge ScD (1951) and an honorary DSc at Singapore (1954); he was awarded the Victoria medal of honour of the Royal Horticultural Society (1972), the gold medal of the American Orchid Society (1963), and the gold medal of the Linnean Society of London (1964). The University of Malaya, which created him an honorary DSc in 1949, awards an Eric Holttum medal to an outstanding student of botany. At least twenty-three botanical specific names with the epithet <i>holttumi</i> or <i>holttumianus</i> commemorate him.<br>
<br>A lifelong member of the Society of Friends, Holttum joined the society's Brentford and Isleworth meeting in 1955. His spoken ministry there had its background in an extensive acquaintance with religious and philosophical literature, deep spiritual insight, and much thought. He published in 1975 <span class="italic">A Personal Christology</span> (reprinted 1995). His religious views also found expression in Quaker magazines and journals. From 1962 onwards he became increasingly deaf, and was ultimately completely deaf, although his eyesight, patience, and intellect remained unimpaired to the end. He had a modest, unassuming manner, and was helpful to all. Physically he was short and sparse in build, with sharp and alert features, a high forehead, and ginger hair. Holttum died from pneumonia on 18 September 1990 in Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton, London.<br>
