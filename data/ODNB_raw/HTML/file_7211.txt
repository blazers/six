<span class="headword">Edward Dafydd <span class="st"> [Edward David]</span></span>  (<em>c.</em>1602&#150;1678?), <span class="occ">Welsh poet</span>, lived in Margam in Glamorgan. Apart from his poems little is known of his life. There are a few sparse references in the records of the Margam estate and parish but even these are sometimes uncertain since at least one other person of the same name lived there during this period. One reference in Penrice and Margam MS 1282 would seem to place his date of birth <i>c</i>.1602. His wife was apparently named Isabell; they had at least one son. Eighteen poems are extant in contemporary manuscripts, the earliest dated 1623 and the latest 1665, and most are in his own hand. They consist chiefly of elegies and other poems in praise of his patrons among the gentry, almost all of whom lived in his own county of Glamorgan. It appears probable from estate documents in the Penrice and Margam collection that he was also a tenant farmer and that, while he would have received payment for his poems in the traditional manner, farming was his main livelihood.<br>
<br>Edward Dafydd's writing shows considerable mastery of the &#145;strict metres&#146; and of the bardic learning in such fields as history, mythology, and genealogy. At its best it displays not only technical skill but also energy, sincerity, and facility of expression. He probably taught something of the poetic craft to a younger generation, among them his son named, in the Welsh patronymic style, Dafydd (or David) Edward. That new generation was far more limited in its metrical range and bardic skill, although one who may well have been his pupil, the Reverend David Williams (Dafydd o'r Nant), carried on some aspects of the old poetic tradition with a measure of success into the last decade of the seventeenth century. Edward Williams 
    (Iolo Morganwg; 1747&#150;1826)
  , that wayward genius of a literary forger, ascribed to Edward Dafydd an exalted position in Iolo's famous invention the Gorsedd of Bards, but this belongs to the realms of fantasy. What earns Edward Dafydd his true place in the history of Welsh poetry is that he was one of the last authentic practitioners of a bardic system reaching back in an unbroken line to Taliesin and Aneirin in the sixth century.<br>
<br>The Margam parish register for 1678 records the burials of two persons named Edward David, one on 14 May and the other on 10 July, and it can reasonably be assumed that one of these was the poet.<br>
