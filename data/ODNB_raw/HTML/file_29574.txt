<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Williamson,  William Crawford</span>  (1816&#150;1895), <span class="occ">naturalist and palaeobotanist</span>, was born at Huntriss Row, Scarborough on 24 November 1816, the second and only surviving son of John Williamson (<i>b</i>. 1784), gardener and first curator of the Scarborough Museum, and Elizabeth Crawford, eldest daughter of a Scottish lapidary and watchmaker who had migrated to Yorkshire when young. In his early boyhood Williamson learned the lapidary's art in his grandfather's workshop, and acquired a good knowledge of field natural history from his father and his father's friends, notably the geologists William Smith (1769&#150;1839), and Smith's nephew John Phillips (1800&#150;1874), who lived for a time in John Williamson's house and later became professor of geology at Oxford. Williamson's schooling, in dame-schools and grammar schools, was frequently interrupted by ill health, and in 1832 he was apprenticed to Thomas Weddell, apothecary of Scarborough. He devoted his free time to natural history, working with a keen group of amateur naturalists in Yorkshire and the north-east. He produced papers on birds, on a new mussel, and on a newly opened tumulus. He contributed to Lindley and Hutton's <span class="italic">Fossil Flora of Great Britain</span> (1831), and produced two pioneering papers for the Geological Society analysing strata into smaller &#145;zones&#146; according to their fossil content.<br>
<br>Williamson's scientific ability attracted attention, not least from Manchester, to which he was invited in 1835 as museum curator for the Natural History Society. For three years he worked on the museum, and on geological research, mixing with Manchester's devotees of science, including John Dalton (1766&#150;1844). Lecturing on geology helped him raise funds to register as a medical student, first at the proprietary school in Pine Street, Manchester (1838&#150;9), and then at University College, London (from the autumn of 1839). By January 1841 he had qualified licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries and MRCS and set up practice in Manchester, aided by two wealthy friends. In June the following year he married Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1872), daughter of the Revd Robert Wood, treasurer to the Wesleyan body; the couple later had a son and a daughter. Before long Williamson had attained a local reputation by operations on squint, also a speciality of another Manchester surgeon, James Braid, with whose work on hypnotism Williamson was associated. He became surgeon to the Chorlton-on-Medlock Dispensary and later established the Manchester Institution for Diseases of the Ear&#151;prompted by his own ear troubles, he had studied aural surgery in Paris and in London. His medical publications included two papers on chloroform anaesthesia as a treatment for infantile convulsions, in <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> in 1853 and in the <span class="italic">Association Medical Journal</span> in 1856, a paper on the chorda tympani as a nerve of taste  (<span class="italic">Association Medical Journal</span>, 1855, 1009&#150;10), and local publications on scarlet fever and on ear disorders. He continued in general medical practice and as an ear specialist until his seventieth year. On friendly terms with the Wesleyans in Manchester, and for a time a member of that denomination, he was medical attendant to the Wesleyan Theological College, Didsbury from 1864 to 1883, and a member of the committee of management. However, he is perhaps best known for his teaching and research at Owens College.<br>
<br>At the foundation of Owens College in January 1851 Williamson was appointed professor of &#145;natural history, anatomy, and physiology&#146;, and played a role in the inauguration of evening classes for working men. Over the years, as Owens College developed, Williamson ceded aspects of his teaching to younger staff with narrower and more academic training. In 1872 the (proprietary) Royal School of Medicine became a medical school of Owens College and a chair in geology was created for William Boyd-Dawkins. Thus, Williamson became professor of natural history. A demonstrator, Marcus Hartog, was appointed to assist him in 1877, and in 1880 Milnes-Marshall was appointed to a chair of zoology. Williamson continued as professor of botany until 1892, when, after forty-one years' service, he received the title of emeritus professor, and a year's salary as gratuity. While his lectures to students were well arranged and fluent, as time went by his younger colleagues felt they lacked minuteness of accurate detail and were increasingly dated, in part because Williamson knew little German.<br>
<br>Williamson's scientific work was immense and his early work was well regarded by contemporaries. His later work, on palaeobotany, was initially little known, partly because of presentational problems. However, towards the end of his life he was recognized as a major pioneer in the study of fossil plants. His early researches on foraminifera led to a Ray Society monograph, in which he described thin-section techniques not previously used for this group, and where he showed that a wide variety of forms, hitherto given specific or generic rank, could be combined in a single individual. His long-overlooked researches on <i>Volvox</i> showed it to be vegetal rather than animal. A very complete study of the wheel animal <i>Melicerta</i>, published in 1853, led to his writing the chapter on Rotifera in the third edition of Andrew Pritchard's <span class="italic">Infusoria</span> (1861). Between 1840 and 1850, largely from material provided by Sir Philip de Malpas Grey-Egerton, Williamson produced two classic monographs on the histology of teeth, fish scales, and bone, demonstrating the essential identity of teeth and fish scales, and the distinction between bone formed directly in membrane and that preformed in cartilage. The German histologist K&ouml;lliker visited Manchester to review these results, and they gained Williamson his fellowship of the Royal Society (1854).<br>
<br>From about 1854 Williamson returned to the study of fossil plants, including the enigmatic form <i>Zamia gigas</i>, called <i>Williamsonia</i> by W. Carruthers. From about 1858, he demonstrated that certain Carboniferous plants combined many of the characteristics of higher flowerless plants (such as horsetails and clubmosses) with the mode of growth seen in modern trees&#151;the successive deposit of new layers in the outer parts of the stem. These key results were initially little regarded, in part because Williamson's exquisite drawings suffered in transfer to lithographic stone and printing and in part because the papers were poorly organized and the terminology deficient. Some readers felt that they had to conduct their own research among Williamson's illustrations and descriptions. His results were ignored by French palaeobotanists until he collaborated with his demonstrator, Marcus Hartog, to publish a systematic review, in French, in <span class="italic">Annales des Sciences Naturelles</span> (1882). By 1890 Renault, Grand'Eury, and Saporta had all largely adopted Williamson's interpretations. From 1876 to his death, Williamson worked on compacted coal, but published little beyond a preliminary note (<span class="italic">British Association Report</span>, 1881). Research in 1885 extended Nathorst's discovery that some fossils supposed to be of animals or plants were merely of animal tracks or tidal currents.<br>
<br>Williamson never spared expense in the purchase of apparatus or specimens&#151;a magnificent stigmaria, &#145;Williamson's folly&#146;, became a feature of the university museum. He met with generous help from amateur naturalists, who were proud to help him with specimens they had collected, or sections they had cut. One of his working-class collaborators, James Lomax, came to earn a living from the preparation of palaeobotanical sections. Williamson had originated among such men, and he shared their craft skills. His career, supported by his medical practice, can be seen as falling between those of the &#145;devotees&#146; of Victorian science&#151;Lyell, Joule, Darwin&#151;and the new generation of professional academics, at least one of whom, the botanist Marshall Ward, was his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Williamson was averse to speculation and to strident scientific naturalism; he took no part in scientific theory. From the mid-1860s to 1882 Williamson's reputation was low&#151;his early work had become textbook commonplaces, his revolutionary palaeobotany had yet to be recognized&#151;but by the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) meeting in Manchester in 1887 he was an honoured member of the cosmopolitan botanists there assembled. In the same year the biology departments of Owens College received magnificent new buildings, the gift of Charles F. Beyer, and the college incorporated the natural history museum in which Williamson had once been curator. He was significantly responsible for developing the collections. His ninth memoir, on the organization of the fossil plants of the coal measures, was given as the Bakerian lecture at the Royal Society and published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span>. He received the society royal medal in 1874, an honorary degree of LLD of Edinburgh in 1883, the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society in 1890, and a number of foreign honours.<br>
<br>Williamson did much to encourage scientific interests both among students and among local naturalists. He was a member of the Manchester Amateur Photographic Society and served on the committee which established Manchester's first municipal library. He served as president of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, and was for long a member of its council; in 1858 he helped form its microscopical and natural history section in which he remained active. After an illness in 1860 Williamson had settled in the suburban village of Fallowfield, where he grew many rare plants, often used in laboratory teaching at Owens, which provided a small grant towards the expenses. Following the death of his first wife, he married, on 4 August 1874, Annie Copley Heaton, niece of Sir Henry Mitchell of Bradford; there was one son from the marriage, the printmaker <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/40263/', "John Copley (1875&#150;1950)")</script>. Spare and erect, with blue-grey eyes deep set in an oval face, Williamson had an educated taste in music, and brought back watercolour sketches from his vacation trips. His artistic facility and his enormous enthusiasm were perhaps best seen in his popular illustrated lectures. Between 1874 and 1890, for example, he gave at least three hundred in connection with the Gilchrist Trust. He wrote a number of articles for the <span class="italic">London Quarterly Review</span>, published under Wesleyan auspices, and some for the <span class="italic">Popular Science Review</span>. He cautiously accepted evolutionary theory, but resented scientific dogmatism and intolerance.<br>
<br>After his retirement in 1892 Williamson moved to 43 Elms Road, Clapham, London, where he continued working, in collaboration with Dukinfield Henry Scott, at his own house or at the Jodrell Laboratory, Kew. His last publication (in February 1895) was the obituary of his old friend, sometime opponent, and recent convert, the marquis de Saporta. He died at home in Clapham on 23 June 1895.<br>
