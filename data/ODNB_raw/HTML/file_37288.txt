<span class="headword">Clark <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lewis]</span>,  Esther</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1716, <em>d.</em> 1794), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was baptized on 10 April 1716 in Holt, Wiltshire, the only child of the Revd John Lewis (<i>d</i>. 1761), incumbent at the parish church of St Katharine, Holt, from 1714 until his death, and his wife, Esther (<i>d</i>. 1744). Little is known of Esther Lewis's early life or education, except that her interest in literature was probably stimulated by her father, who was an antiquary with a particular interest in heraldry.<br>
<br>Following her mother's death in 1744, Esther Lewis continued to live with her father in Holt. She suffered smallpox at some point in the 1740s. It is believed that she was attended by Samuel Bowden, a physician who lived in Frome, Somerset. Bowden was an accomplished minor poet who promoted Lewis's work. Her poems were appearing in the <span class="italic">Bath Journal</span> by 1749 under the name Sylvia. Poems by herself and Bowden appeared in various London periodicals at about this time. Bowden's <span class="italic">Poems on Various Subjects</span> (1754) contained a number of Lewis's compositions. During the 1750s and 1760s Lewis made other literary acquaintances, including Dr Samuel Salter, master of the Charterhouse in London, and Sarah Fielding, who lived near Bath after 1758.<br>
<br>John Lewis died at the beginning of November 1761, and Esther Lewis appears to have been left without a home. On 2 October 1762 she married Robert Clark of Tetbury, Gloucestershire, whose first wife had died in 1755 shortly after the birth of a daughter, Mary. Clark owned an estate in Tetbury which was eventually given the name Highgrove by his grandson John Paul Paul. Esther Clark was about eighteen years older than her new husband, but may not have revealed her actual age to him. Esther Clark moved to Tetbury, where she cared for her stepdaughter and took an active interest in local charities. In 1774 she donated &pound;50 for the maintenance of alms women in the town. A collection of her work, <span class="italic">Poems Moral and Entertaining</span> (1789), was published for the benefit of charities in Bath and Gloucester and of Sunday schools in Tetbury. Although many of the poems in this volume displayed genuine wit as well as acute social observation, they passed largely unnoticed by reviewers at the time.<br>
<br>An inscription in the church at Tetbury records Esther Clark's death on 8 May 1794 at the age of seventy-five.<br>
