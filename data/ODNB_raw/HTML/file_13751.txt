<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hopkins,  Matthew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1647), <span class="occ">witch-finder</span>, was the son of James Hopkins (<i>d</i>. 1634?), vicar of Wenham in Suffolk. His collaborator John Stearne described Matthew as &#145;the son of a godly minister&#146;  (Stearne, 61). James's will, proved in 1634, mentions six children, only two of whom (Thomas and James) were named. The will entrusted the upbringing of the remaining children to the clergyman's widow, which implies that Matthew was then a minor, and hence in his twenties when he flourished as a witch-finder between 1645 and 1647. Practically nothing more is known of his earlier life, and the persistent tradition that he had received legal training is apparently unfounded. But in the last two and a half years of his life Hopkins enjoyed a brief prominence in eastern England, and he is remembered as the most notorious individual in English witchcraft history.<br>
<br>By the winter of 1644&#150;5 Hopkins was resident at Manningtree in Essex and, on his own account, became troubled by the activities of seven or eight supposed witches living in the town. From March 1645 these and other suspected witches were apprehended and taken to be examined by local justices of the peace, with Hopkins giving detailed evidence against several of them. Thirty-six suspected witches, all women, were eventually tried at the Essex assizes in July 1645, of whom nineteen were executed. A further nine died of disease in gaol, and six were still in prison in 1648. Only one of the accused was acquitted and released, another, Rebecca West, escaping punishment after she became the leading witness for the prosecution.<br>
<br>This was a serious enough local witch-hunt by English standards, but it marked the first stage of a major persecution. Witchcraft accusations spread from Manningtree to Suffolk, where over a hundred alleged witches were identified and at least forty executed, and to Norfolk, where another forty witches were tried, of whom perhaps half were executed. There were trials in Huntingdonshire, in Cambridgeshire, in a number of counties in the eastern midlands, and in several boroughs, notably Great Yarmouth, King's Lynn, Stowmarket, and Aldeburgh, with the last accusations coming in the Isle of Ely in 1647. It is likely that at least 250 people were tried as witches or subjected to preliminary investigation during this witch panic. Of these at least a hundred were executed.<br>
<br>The fact that the phrase &#145;the Hopkins witch panic&#146; is used to describe the trials of 1645&#150;7 demonstrates that a central role is normally attributed to Hopkins, aided by John Stearne. But even if Hopkins was a catalyst, it is clear that the necessary preconditions for a major episode of witch-hunting were present. The influences which had hitherto prevented large-scale witch persecution in England, where both trials and demonological writings had apparently passed out of fashion by the 1630s, were absent in East Anglia in the early 1640s. During the first civil war local justices of the peace were concerned mainly with keeping the war effort going and thus a major witch craze could gather momentum in the absence of their normal restraining hand. Moreover, the war was increasingly being seen in ideological terms, with a consequent encouragement of popular godliness. Moderate ministers had been purged in both Essex and Suffolk, and it is probably no coincidence that one of the zones of Suffolk which was to experience heavy witchcraft accusations in 1645 was the area where the iconoclast William Dowsing had been active a year earlier.<br>
<br>Thus Hopkins's and Stearne's claims that they operated mainly in towns which had requested their services, although perhaps overstated, are evidently not without foundation. Even during the early accusations at Manningtree, Hopkins was only one of ninety-two witnesses giving evidence against the alleged witches. It remains clear, however, that their investigative techniques were reprehensible. Suspects were &#145;watched&#146;, primarily to prevent them from having contact with their familiar spirits, a practice which amounted to their being subjected to severe sleep-deprivation. This, allied to interrogations which depended heavily on leading questions, led to numerous confessions of doing harm by malefic witchcraft, meeting and making a pact with the devil, having sexual intercourse with him, and varied dealings with familiar spirits. Critics, correctly, identified the advent of witch-finders as something new to England: &#145;such a profession or occupation&#146;, wrote the clergyman John Gaule in a pamphlet published in June 1646, &#145;has not been heard of heretofore&#146;  (Gaule, 88).<br>
<br>Hopkins's motives in witch-hunting remain obscure. There is a strong tradition, dating from the period of the trials, that his main motive was to make money. Certainly Hopkins did receive payments from some communities for his witch-finding, but often much of the money took the form of expenses for himself, Stearne, and Mary Phillips, a Manningtree woman who acquired a considerable reputation for being able to find the witch's mark. Hopkins, as many would have thought appropriate for the son of a godly country minister, had a genuine concern about witchcraft and may well have been, initially at least, surprised to find himself the central figure in a major witch-hunt. By the time John Gaule wrote, however, Hopkins was probably growing in self-confidence and self-importance. In May 1647 he issued <span class="italic">The discovery of witches in answer to severall queries, lately delivered to the judges of the assize for the county of Norfolk. And now published by Matthew Hopkins, witch-finder, for the benefite of the whole kingdome</span>.<br>
<br>The East Anglian trials of 1645&#150;7 were the only major English witch-hunts and witch-hunting in the Hopkins mode, with its unleashing of enthusiastic popular godliness and the coming to prominence of an obscure man, became one of the symbols of what polite post-Restoration society regarded as the dreadfulness of the 1640s and 1650s. To later generations Hopkins's name has become associated with bigotry and harshness, especially after the making of the 1968 film <span class="italic">Witchfinder General</span> (directed by Michael Reeves), in which Vincent Price gave a memorably robust performance as Matthew Hopkins.<br>
<br>There is a pleasing tradition, still repeated in modern works of reference, that Hopkins was himself swum and subsequently executed as a witch. In fact he died, according to Stearne, &#145;after a long sicknesse of consumption&#146;  (Stearne, 61) at Manningtree, and the parish register of Mistley with Manningtree records his burial there on 12 August 1647.<br>
