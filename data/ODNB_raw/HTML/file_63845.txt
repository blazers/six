<span class="headword">Thomas,  Terry</span>  (1888&#150;1978), <span class="occ">headmaster</span>, was born on 19 October 1888 at 40 Sapphire Street, Roath, Cardiff, the son of David Terry Thomas, schoolmaster, and his wife, Mary Ann Walton. He was educated at Howard Gardens School and at University College, Cardiff, graduating in physics in 1909. He was chief science master at Inverurie Academy for two years and, in 1911, he went to St John's College, Cambridge, reading in successive years for the mathematical, natural sciences, and law triposes. From 1914 until December 1922 Thomas served as head of the military and engineering side at Haileybury College, where he established his reputation as a science teacher and produced a number of books for schools. He gained a London PhD in 1922 for a thesis on the thermoelectric properties of metal wires. On 19 August 1915 Thomas married Mary (<i>b</i>. 1890/91), the daughter of Henry Davies, director of mining education, at the Congregational chapel, Charles Street, Cardiff.<br>
<br>Thomas became headmaster of Leeds grammar school in January 1923. During the time of his predecessor the school had tripled in size to nearly 600 pupils. Like other endowed city grammar schools it had become directly grant-aided by the Board of Education in the first decade of the century and as a condition admitted annually a number of scholarship holders from the elementary schools. The school continued to grow and, by the time of Thomas's retirement thirty years later, there were more than 900 pupils enjoying good facilities for the study of a wide curriculum that included sporting and other non-academic activities. In his early years a playing field was acquired on the outskirts of the city at Lawnswood. New building work was undertaken at the school to provide additional classrooms and a laboratory so that biology might be introduced into the curriculum. By 1939 further building work had been carried out to provide a swimming pool, a gymnasium, a new dining room, accommodation for theatrical performances, a major enhancement of the chapel, and other facilities.<br>
<br>Historically Leeds grammar school was one of the best-endowed in the north of England, and this greatly helped Thomas with his projects. He was very successful in stimulating enthusiastic financial support among &#145;old boys&#146; and parents for the development fund, which took an institutional shape with the formation in 1937 of the Friends of Leeds Grammar School. He was a man of strong personality who succeeded in evoking a keen sense of loyalty and support, though some saw him as self-willed and possibly too hasty in judgement.<br>
<br>Beyond the school Thomas's reputation grew and he became president of the Incorporated Association of Headmasters in 1936 and then treasurer for 1937&#150;46. He was a very active member of the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) and chaired some of its committees. Along with the heads of Winchester and Charterhouse he served on a group to represent the HMC's views to the Board of Education during the years leading to the enactment and implementation of the <span class="roman">Education Act</span> of 1944. He was seen as a firm upholder of the independence enjoyed by direct-grant grammar schools. In 1941 he was appointed by the Board of Education to the Norwood committee to inquire into the curriculum and examinations in secondary schools. He caused some disquiet at the board by his lone refusal, at the committee's very last meeting, to agree to the central recommendations to move nationally from external to internal school-leaving examinations. A few years later, as a member of the Secondary Schools Examinations Council, he had the satisfaction of seeing his own views triumph in the report which led to the creation of the general certificate of education.<br>
<br>Thomas's increasing concern for the prospects of grammar schools such as his own may be seen in his reaction to the order of the Ministry of Education that, after 1944, all direct-grant schools should resubmit applications if they wished to remain on the list. Some were rejected by the ministry. Leeds grammar school submitted its application but withdrew it after the return to office of the Labour Party in 1945, Thomas preferring that it should become an independent school relying upon fully fee-paying clients. This policy continued until reversed by his successor in 1957; in an inflationary climate the absence of grant aid made the financial position of the school more difficult, forcing it to raise fees to a level beyond the reach of able entrants from modest backgrounds, whose exclusion was not helpful in sustaining academic achievement over the longer term.<br>
<br>During the struggles of the 1940s surrounding the future pattern of secondary schooling, Thomas emerged as a vigorous national leader in the headmasters' organizations, fighting to sustain the position of the direct-grant schools. For many years a member of the court of the University of Leeds, his services nationally were recognized when the degree of doctor of laws <i>honoris causa</i> was conferred upon him in 1948.<br>
<br>After his retirement in December 1953, Thomas maintained a close interest in the affairs of Leeds grammar school. He also continued to be very active in public service. He had become a magistrate in 1937, served as chairman of the Leeds bench from 1950 to 1963, as chairman of the visiting magistrates for Leeds prison from 1948 to 1963, and as chairman of the West Riding branch of the Magistrates Association from 1956 to 1959. He died at Seacroft Hospital, Leeds, on 22 July 1978. His funeral was held in the school chapel on 27 July, followed by cremation. He was survived by his wife, Mary, and two daughters.<br>
