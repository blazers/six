<span class="headword">Hodgson,  John</span>  (1757&#150;1846), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the son and heir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13445/', "Studholme Hodgson (1707/8&#150;1798)")</script>, an army officer, and his wife, Catherine (1734&#150;1798), the second daughter of Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Howard. He was educated at Harrow School and in 1779 obtained an ensigncy in his father's regiment, the 4th King's Own; he served very many years with it in North America and was wounded in command of it in the Netherlands in 1799. He was later governor of Bermuda and of Cura&ccedil;ao, which latter appointment he held until the settlement was restored to the Dutch in 1815. His handling of the governorship earned Hodgson repeated thanks from the British government. In addition he served as colonel in succession of the 3rd garrison battalion, the 83rd, and his old corps, the 4th King's Own, and became a full general in 1830. He married Catherine Krempion of St Petersburg, a sister of the countess of Terrol, and had a large family, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13442/', "John Studholme Hodgson")</script>, the eldest son, and <a href="#cosubject_13446">Studholme John Hodgson [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Like his father, John Hodgson attained a great age, and died at his home in Welbeck Street, London, on 14 January 1846 from the effects of a cold caught while out shooting.<br>
<br>Hodgson's second son, <a name="cosubject_13446"></a><span class="headword">Studholme John Hodgson</span>  (<em>b. </em>after 1805, <em>d.</em> 1890), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, entered the army in 1819 as an ensign in the 50th foot and served for many years in Ceylon, India, and Burma in the 45th, 39th, and 19th regiments. For some time he commanded the forces in Ceylon and the Straits Settlements, and in Ceylon also administered the civil government. In 1856 he became colonel of the 54th, and in 1876, like his father and grandfather, colonel of the Royal Lancaster regiment. He died at Torquay on 31 August 1890.<br>
