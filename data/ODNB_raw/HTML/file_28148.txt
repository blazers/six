<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Vaughan,  Thomas</span>  (1621&#150;1666), <span class="occ">hermetic philosopher and alchemist</span>, was the son of Thomas Vaughan (<i>c</i>.1586&#150;1658) of Llansanffraid (St Bridget's), Brecknockshire, and his wife, Denise Jenkin (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1593), daughter and heir of David Morgan of Llansanffraid. Thomas and his elder twin brother, the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28130/', "Henry Vaughan")</script>, were born at Newton by Usk and were the oldest surviving children of the marriage for whom there is clear evidence. Although no portrait is known of either Henry or Thomas, they may have been identical twins, since their similar appearance in adulthood was remarked upon by their friend Thomas Powell in a poem prefacing Henry's <span class="italic">Olor Iscanus</span> (1651). Allusions in the brothers' writings indicate that the family was bilingual in Welsh and English.<h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Between 1632 and 1638 Henry and Thomas were tutored by the rector of nearby Llangattock, Matthew Herbert, to whom both brothers later wrote verses that indicated their affection and respect. They were then sent to Oxford; Thomas Vaughan was admitted to Jesus College on 4 May 1638, matriculated on 14 December 1638, was promoted from commoner to scholar in May 1641, and took his BA degree on 18 February 1642. Early in his Oxford years he demonstrated his royalist sympathies in a Latin poem contributed to a volume celebrating the birth of Henry, duke of Gloucester, <span class="italic">Horti Carolini rosa altera</span> (1640). He also became an admirer of William Cartwright, to whose posthumously published <span class="italic">Comedies, Tragi-Comedies, with other Poems</span> (1651) he was to contribute a complimentary poem. The latter part of his time at Jesus was disrupted by the civil war; Henry Vaughan, in his 1673 letter to John Aubrey retailing biographical information about himself and his twin, says only that Thomas remained at Oxford for ten or twelve years, &#145;and (I thinke) he could be noe lesse than M<sup>r</sup> of Arts&#146;  (H. Vaughan to Aubrey, 1673, Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood F.39, fol. 216), but he was clearly unsure of the details.<br>
<br>Henry is more definite about Thomas's ordination: &#145;ordayned minister by bishop Mainwaringe &amp; presented to the Rectorie of S<sup>t</sup> Brigets by his kinsman S<sup>r</sup> George Vaughan&#146;  (H. Vaughan to Aubrey, 1673, Bodl. Oxf., MS Wood F.39 fol. 216). No date is given, but the previous rector of Llansanffraid died in 1643 or 1644, and by 1645 Thomas would have reached the age of twenty-four, the legal minimum for ordination as a priest. However, he did not long enjoy the benefice. Although he is described as rector of Llansanffraid in Michaelmas term 1649, in a lawsuit that he brought for trespass on a plot of ground known as Little Island, sequestrations were being carried out against Anglican clergy and royalist sympathizers in Wales from as early as 1645, and in 1650 Thomas Vaughan was formally evicted under the <span class="roman">Act for Better Propagation and Preaching the Gospel in Wales, Ejecting Ministers and Schoolmasters, and Redresse of Grievances</span>. The propagators' charges against him were that he was &#145;a comon drunkard, a common swearer, no preacher, a whoremast<sup>r</sup>, &amp; in armes personally against y<sup>e</sup> Parliament&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Walker e.7, fol. 213b).<br>
<br>Evidence from their own writings and from other records corroborates this last charge: the Vaughan twins did indeed take up arms in the royalist cause. Both were probably present at the defeat suffered by the king's forces at Rowton Heath near Chester on 24 September 1645, and a Captain Thomas Vaughan is mentioned in a list of royalist officers taken prisoner, along with a Captain Henshaw. This may be a cousin of Vaughan's associate Thomas Henshaw, to whom Vaughan dedicated <span class="italic">Magia Adamica</span> in 1650, describing him as his &#145;best of Friends&#146;. In July 1648 the Vaughans' younger brother William died as a result of what Thomas described in <span class="italic">The Man-Mouse</span> as a &#145;glorious imployment&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Man-Mouse</span>, 1650, 85), which perhaps alludes to a fatal injury suffered in the royalist cause; he himself seems to have been at Oxford at the time, as the preface to <span class="italic">Anthroposophia theomagica</span> is dated &#145;Oxonii 48&#146; and the book itself concludes with an apology to the effect that it was &#145;compos'd in <i>Haste</i>, and in my <i>Dayes of Mourning</i>, on the <i>sad Occurence of a Brother's Death</i>&#146;.<br>
<br>By May 1650, on the evidence of Hartlib's &#145;Ephemerides&#146;, Vaughan (&#145;the author of <span class="roman">Anthroposophia</span>&#146;, as Hartlib calls him) and Thomas Henshaw were living at Kensington and collaborating on alchemical enterprises. Henshaw's circle of alchemical acquaintance was wide, and his family connections included William Backhouse of Swallowfield; if he were not already acquainted with them, Vaughan could have been introduced by Henshaw to men like Robert Child (who included Vaughan in his plans for a &#145;chymical club&#146;) and Elias Ashmole.<h2>
<a name="Publicationandcontroversy"></a>Publication and controversy</h2>Vaughan's first tracts on hermetic philosophy, <span class="italic">Anthroposophia theomagica</span> and <span class="italic">Anima magica abscondita</span>, were issued together in 1650. They attracted considerable interest in his own circle, as well as the hostile attentions of the Cambridge Platonist Henry More. They were followed in the same year by <span class="italic">Magia Adamica</span>, issued with <span class="italic">The Man-Mouse</span>, and in 1651 by <span class="italic">Lumen de lumine</span>, issued with <span class="italic">The Second Wash</span>, the latter items in both volumes being Vaughan's refutations of More. All these titles appeared under Vaughan's pseudonym of &#145;Eugenius Philalethes&#146; and were brought out by the same publisher, Humphrey Blunden, known for his interest in occult writers, including Boehme. He is likely to be the same H. Blunden who appended a verse postscript to <span class="italic">Anima magica abscondita</span> and who was reputed a &#145;happy Operatour in Chymistrie&#146;  (H. More, &#145;The second lash&#146;, in <span class="italic">Enthusiasmus triumphatus</span>, 1656 edn, 208).<br>
<br>The dedication of <span class="italic">Anthroposophia theomagica</span> to the Rosicrucian brotherhood may be only one nail in the coffin of Vaughan's credibility in the eyes of posterity, but responses among his contemporaries were more mixed. His vehement anti-Aristotelianism and his espousal of such authorities as the fabulous antique sage Hermes Trismegistus, the occult philosopher Cornelius Agrippa, the cabbalist Johann Reuchlin, and the alchemist Michael Sendivogius positioned him in an intellectual milieu that attracted, even if fleetingly, some of the most original minds of his time. Henry More attacked him in frivolous or scatological terms in two publications: <span class="italic">Observations upon &#145;Anthroposophia theomagica&#146;, and &#145;Anima magica abscondita&#146;</span> (1650) and <span class="italic">The Second Lash of Alazonomastix</span> (1651). Vaughan responded in kind in his point-by-point counterblasts, <span class="italic">The Man-Mouse</span> and <span class="italic">The Second Wash</span>. Neither party comes well out of this exchange, but underlying the Oxford versus Cambridge logomachy and <i>odium academicum</i> there is a serious confrontation between two opposing world-views: Vaughan's magical, hermetic, and cabbalistic, More's anti-enthusiastic and (somewhat incoherently) Cartesian.<br>
<br>Vaughan was clearly given to cantankerous criticism, and not only in his controversy with More. His comments on Ashmole's <span class="italic">Theatrum chemicum Britannicum</span> (1652), themselves acidly annotated in cipher by Ashmole  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D 864 fol. 222), include remarks on the level of &#145;ha ha hie. Sympleton&#146; and &#145;Away Animal thou liest&#146;. Of the ending of &#145;The Magistery&#146; (<span class="italic">Theatrum chemicum Britannicum</span>, 342&#150;3) by Ashmole's alchemical mentor William Backhouse:<blockquote>
<div>Oh happy man that understands<br>
</div>
<div>This Medicen to atchieve!<br>
</div>
</blockquote>Vaughan sneered &#145;The author was never so happy&#146;, to which Ashmole retorted &#145;If the observator was as happy he would be more modest in his censures&#146;. None the less, Ashmole's annotated copy of Pierre Borel's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca chimica</span>  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Ashmole 1374) shows that he possessed all Vaughan's philosophical publications.<br>
<br>Vaughan's next work, <span class="italic">Aula lucis</span>, came out in 1652 under the initials &#145;S. N.&#146; (the last letters of his names) but despite the change of pseudonym and publisher it is vouched for as his by Henry Vaughan. It has been suggested that the dedicatee, &#145;Seleucus Abantiades&#146;, who, Vaughan says, knew him from his childhood, was Matthew Herbert. Also in 1652 Vaughan published an English version by an unidentified translator of the key Rosicrucian text, the <span class="italic">Fama et confessio</span>. To this <span class="italic">Fame and Confession of the Fraternitie of R: C:</span> Vaughan added an extensive preface. For his final philosophical discourse, <span class="italic">Euphrates, or, The Waters of the East</span> (1655), he reverted to the pseudonym of Eugenius Philalethes; its publisher was Humphrey Moseley, who was also Henry Vaughan's publisher. Finally, in 1657, Vaughan wrote an introduction to <span class="italic">The Chymists Key</span>, Henry's translation of Heinrich Nolle's <span class="italic">De generatione rerum naturalium liber</span>. The &#145;Discourse&#146; of his own to which he alludes in the concluding words of this piece was apparently never published, and no further work of his appeared in print in his lifetime. Nor did any work achieve a second edition, although <span class="italic">Magia Adamica</span> and <span class="italic">Euphrates</span> were reissued in 1656 and 1671 respectively.<h2>
<a name="Marriagelatercareeranddeath"></a>Marriage, later career, and death</h2>Vaughan married on 28 September 1651; his wife's name was Rebecca, but that and the details that Vaughan himself preserved about their life together are all that is definitely known about her. She died on 17 April 1658, probably in London at lodgings owned by a Mistress Highgate, with whom Vaughan left some of her belongings. On 26 April Rebecca's burial was recorded at Meppershall in Bedfordshire, which led Hutchinson to suggest that she came from there. The name Rebecca occurs in the family of the ejected rector of Meppershall, Timothy Archer, but there is no evidence for the existence of a Rebecca Archer who might have been Thomas Vaughan's wife.<br>
<br>On the evidence of Vaughan's notebook &#145;Aqua vitae: non vitis&#146; (BL, MS Sloane 1741), the marriage was a happy one. He appears to have begun &#145;Aqua vitae&#146; shortly after Rebecca's death; the title-page motto suggests that he saw it partly as therapy for his grief, and many pages are adorned with their joint initials, T. R. V., and pious exclamations. It seems that the Vaughans had supported themselves by the &#145;naturall secrets&#146;  (&#145;Aqua vitae&#146;, fol. 105<i>v</i>) that enabled them to practise chemical medicine, and &#145;Aqua vitae&#146; was intended in the first instance as a record of the alchemical work Vaughan carried out with his wife's encouragement. Rebecca, too, was active in the preparation of medicaments, as among her belongings listed by Vaughan after her death was &#145;a great glass full of eye-water, made att the Pinner of Wakefield, by my deare wife, and my sister vaughan [Henry's first wife Catherine], who are both now with god&#146;. (Hutchinson identifies the Pinner (or Pinder) of Wakefield as an inn in the parish of St Pancras, half a mile north of Gray's Inn; prior to living there, the Vaughans had lodged at a Mr Coalman's in Holborn.)<br>
<br>Vaughan continued to make additions to &#145;Aqua vitae&#146; for several years, the latest dated entry being an alchemical extraction on 8 August 1662, but the dreams and premonitions and affectionate remembrances of his wife were mainly written down in the year following her death, to April 1659. The entry for 9 April 1659 suggests that there may have been some truth in the propagators' accusation of disorderly behaviour against Vaughan, since he describes a dream encounter with &#145;a certaine person, with whom I had in former times revelled away many yeares in drinking&#146;  (fol. 103).<br>
<br>Towards the end of the 1650s Vaughan became involved in an unfortunate episode with a chemical practitioner of apparently parliamentarian sympathies called Edward Bolnest. A typical alchemical imbroglio, it began with Bolnest's advancing money to Vaughan on the understanding that Vaughan would disclose to him the secrets of his art, only to be disappointed. Vaughan's counter-claim, in a deposition dated 18 May 1661  (Chanc. Pro. Hamilton 354.45) that shows him to have been living at the time in the parish of St Giles-in-the-Fields, hinged on Bolnest's threats and violence in his attempts to recover the moneys and goods he believed that Vaughan had accepted under false pretences. There is apparently no record of how or if the dispute was resolved.<br>
<br>The political and religious settlement after the Restoration would have been to Vaughan's liking, but, for whatever reason, he did not reclaim the Llansanffraid living. Possibly he had hopes of advancement from his new patron, Sir Robert Moray; Moray was not only a good chemist but also a favourite with Charles II, whom he assisted in chemical operations in the royal laboratory in Whitehall. At the end of 1665 Moray withdrew from London to Albury, between Oxford and Thame, because of the plague; there he kept himself occupied with chemical experiments. Vaughan seems to have joined him, as it was in the house of Samuel Kem, minister at Albury, that Vaughan suddenly died on 27 February 1666. Wood, in noting the circumstances, cited an unidentified Harris of Jesus College as his source: &#145;Eugenius Philalethes died as twere suddenly when he was operating strong mercurie, some of which by chance getting up into his nose killed him&#146;  (Wood, 3, col. 722). The expenses of Vaughan's burial at Albury on 1 March were paid by Moray, to whom, according to Henry Vaughan, Vaughan left all his books and manuscripts.<br>
<br>The canon of Vaughan's works is based on information given by Henry Vaughan to Aubrey in 1673, supplemented by Ashmole's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca chimica</span> list. <span class="italic">A Breif Naturall History</span> by &#145;Eugenius Philalethes&#146; (1669), though placed among Thomas Vaughan's oeuvre by William Cooper in his <span class="italic">Catalogue of Chymicall Books</span> (1675), was rejected from the canon by Anthony Wood on stylistic grounds. One posthumous publication should, however, be added. Those of Thomas's Latin poems that were available to Henry were published by the latter as a separate section at the back of <span class="italic">Thalia rediviva</span> (1678); they conclude with a note to the effect that many other pieces were lacking, among them &#145;Alcippus et Jacintha&#146;, described as &#145;Poema heroicum absolutissimum&#146;  (<span class="italic">Thalia rediviva</span>, 93), having been left behind in Oxford. Besides conventional love poems to &#145;Stella&#146; and some complimentary verse, Thomas's contributions to <span class="italic">Thalia rediviva</span> include epitaphs on Charles I and Archbishop Laud, a virulent satire on an unidentified political opponent under the name of Vertumnus, and a series on the executed royalist Colonel John Morris, hero of the siege of Pontefract in 1648. Apart from these Latin poems and the <span class="italic">Horti Carolini rosa altera</span> and Cartwright poems already discussed, he also contributed complimentary verses in English to his brother's <span class="italic">Olor Iscanus</span> and in Latin to Thomas Powell's <span class="italic">Elementa opticae</span> (1651).<h2>
<a name="Vaughaninretrospect"></a>Vaughan in retrospect</h2>Vaughan's reputation has undergone both neglect and misrepresentation at the hands of posterity, and his standing among his contemporaries was ambiguous. In character he was capable both of the coarseness and arrogance seen in his dealings with More and Ashmole and of the reflective tenderness of the memoranda in &#145;Aqua vitae&#146;. Of himself he observed in his postscript to <span class="italic">The Fame and Confession</span> that his nature was &#145;more <i>Melancholy</i> then <i>Sociable</i>&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Fame and Confession</span>, 57). As a prose stylist too he ranged from the lyricism of his description of Thalia and the <i>prima materia</i> in <span class="italic">Lumen de lumine</span> to the crude invective of his polemics with More. In the latter he &#145;Clevelandized&#146;, affecting a prose version of the swaggering satire of John Cleveland, the royalist poet of whom there are many echoes in his writings. Vaughan may well have known Cleveland personally after Cleveland had abandoned Cambridge for Oxford in the mid-1640s; Cleveland had many imitators, but in Vaughan's case the taunting of More, the Cambridge man, in the language of this prestigious refugee from the other university would have had a particular piquancy.<br>
<br>Opinions about Vaughan differed sharply at the time of his first publications. Child and Hartlib both alluded to his books in terms that suggest they caused a stir among the natural philosophers, and in late 1650 George Starkey was planning a refutation (which seems never to have been written, or not to have survived). As regards his fame as an alchemical operator, Hartlib in his &#145;Ephemerides&#146; seems to be inclined to give Vaughan the benefit of the doubt over whether he possessed the <i>Menstruum Universale</i> or <i>prima materia</i>; the passage is obscure, but seems to indicate that the experience that Robert Boyle had had of this substance&#151;whatever it might have been&#151;corroborated Vaughan's. Vaughan gives a recipe for the <i>Menstruum Universale</i> in &#145;Aqua vitae&#146;  (fol. 12<i>v</i>.) About this time, Backhouse told Ashmole that Vaughan was experimenting on the spirit of saltpetre &#145;and of late he added May-dew to it&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Rawl. D 864 fol. 207).<br>
<br>Although some took Vaughan and his work seriously, there were contemporary detractors other than Henry More. For instance, John Gaule's <span class="italic">Mus-mantia</span> (1652)&#151;the title is an obvious pun on Vaughan's <span class="italic">Man-Mouse</span>&#151;contains much detailed quotation derived from a hostile reading of <span class="italic">Magia Adamica</span>. Later Vaughan received the back-handed compliment of being among the victims of the many and various plagiarisms of John Heydon, particularly in <span class="italic">The Harmony of the World</span> (1662). Samuel Butler pokes fun at Vaughan in part 1 of <span class="italic">Hudibras</span> (1663) as one of the gurus of the mystical squire Ralpho and also in his prose portrait &#145;An Hermetic Philosopher&#146;. In a more serious vein, Samuel Parker, bishop of Oxford, debunks &#145;our late English <i>Rosie Crusians</i>&#146; and singles out &#145;the controversial Rencountres of Eugenius Philalethes&#146;, along with the writings of Heydon, as examples of language unbecoming philosophical discourse  (<span class="italic">A Free and Impartial Censure, of the Platonick Philosophie</span>, 2nd edn, 1667, 75). Swift complained in 1704 that <span class="italic">Anthroposophia theomagica</span> was &#145;a Piece of the most unintelligible Fustian, that, perhaps, was ever publish'd in any Language&#146;  (<span class="italic">A Tale of a Tub</span>, 1704). Notwithstanding this, Vaughan's writings were known in continental Europe, and in the late seventeenth and first half of the eighteenth centuries several of his works were circulated in German translation.<br>
<br>Nineteenth-century enthusiasm for the occult brought a new lease of life to Vaughan's reputation as a Rosicrucian and as the purported possessor of the elixir of life, and he was endowed in occultist circles with the character of a magus. It is largely in this context and for this readership that A. E. Waite prepared his collected edition of Vaughan's works for the Theosophical Society (1919). Only in the last third of the twentieth century did the reassessment of Rosicrucianism against the background of seventeenth-century philosophy and politics enable a fresh look to be taken at those who associated themselves with the movement; the intellectual bases of alchemy too, stripped of the pretensions and secrecy of its more dubious practitioners, likewise came under serious reappraisal, and both trends served to situate Vaughan more securely in the intellectual milieu of his day. Vaughan certainly preferred to think of himself as a philosopher: &#145;for <i>Alchymie</i> in the common acceptation, and as it is a <i>torture of metalls</i>, I did never believe; much less did I study it&#146;  (<span class="italic">Euphrates</span>, sig. A3&#150;3<sup><i>v</i></sup>).<br>
