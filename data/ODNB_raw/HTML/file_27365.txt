<span class="headword">Thornton,  Thomas</span>  (1786&#150;1866), <span class="occ">journalist and writer</span>, born in London on 12 July 1786, was the son of Thomas Thornton, East India agent, and his wife, Sarah, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kitchener. In early life he was employed in the custom house, and published several works dealing with East Indian trade. The first of these, <span class="italic">A Compendium of the Laws Recently Passed for Regulating the Trade with the East Indies</span>, appeared in 1814. It was followed by <span class="italic">The duties of customs and excise on goods &hellip; imported, and the duties, drawbacks, &amp;c., on goods exported, brought down to August 1818</span> (1818) and by a supplementary edition published in the succeeding year. In 1825 he published <span class="italic">Oriental Commerce, or, The East Indian Trader's Complete Guide</span>, a geographical and statistical work originally compiled by William Milburn, an employee of the East India Company. Thornton greatly reduced the historical part of this work, but added supplementary matter.<br>
<br>In 1823 Thornton married Elizabeth, daughter of Habbakuk Robinson of Bagshot, Surrey, with whom he had three sons and three daughters. In 1825 their eldest son, Robinson Thornton, was born, and in this same year Thornton became connected with <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and remained a member of its staff until the year before his death. For forty years he supplied highly regarded summaries of parliamentary debates, characterized by their unfailing terseness and grasp. Between 1841 and 1850 he was engaged in recording the proceedings of the ecclesiastical and maritime courts. His <span class="italic">Notes of Cases</span>, published monthly and collected in seven volumes in 1850, came to be regarded as authoritative.<br>
<br>Thornton also published <span class="italic">A History of China &hellip; to the Treaty with Great Britain in 1842</span> (2 vols., 1844) and, in 1846, a <span class="italic">History of the Punjab and the Sikhs</span> (3 vols.). In 1813 he edited the <span class="italic">Complete Works of Thomas Otway</span> (3 vols.) and prefixed a short life of the dramatist.<br>
<br>Thornton died on 25 March 1866 at 29 Gloucester Street, Belgrave Road, London, survived by his wife and several children. His son Robinson Thornton was warden of Trinity College, Glenalmond, from 1870 to 1873, Boyle lecturer in 1881&#150;3, and became archdeacon of Middlesex in 1893. His second son, Thomas Henry (<i>b</i>. 1832), was judge of the chief court of the Punjab and member of the legislative council of India in 1878&#150;81. His third son, Samuel (1835&#150;1917), was first bishop of Ballarat (1875&#150;1900) and was vicar of Blackburn from 1901 to 1910.<br>
