<span class="headword">Desaguliers,  Thomas</span>  (1721&#150;1780), <span class="occ">army officer and military engineer</span>, was born on 5 January 1721, and baptized on 20 January at St Margaret's, Westminster, the fourth (but second surviving) son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7539/', "John Theophilus Desaguliers (1683&#150;1744)")</script>, natural philosopher and engineer, and his wife, Joanna Pudsey (1690&times;95&#150;1753). Pursuing his father's interest in the military applications of advances in mechanics, he entered the regiment of Royal Artillery as a cadet on 1 January 1740, and was promoted second lieutenant on 1 September 1741, first lieutenant on 1 February 1742, captain-lieutenant on 3 April 1743, and captain on 1 January 1745. He first saw service in Flanders in 1744, when he joined the Royal Artillery train under Colonel William Belford, and spent most of the period, until the close of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1748, on continental Europe. He was present at the battle of Fontenoy, as well as many minor engagements. On 18 March 1746 at St George, Mayfair, he married Mary Blackwood (<i>bap</i>. 23 June 1727), daughter of John Blackwood of Charlton, Kent, and his wife, Anne Shovel, the daughter of the naval officer, Sir Cloudsley Shovel. They had three children: Mary Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1814), who married Thomas Cartwright of Aynho, Northamptonshire, and second Sir Stephen Cotterel, master of the ceremonies; Anne (1748&#150;1801), who married Robert Shuttleworth of Gawthorpe, Lancashire; and Frederick (<i>bap</i>. 1749), who was killed in North America <i>c</i>.1775.<br>
<br>Desaguliers was made chief firemaster at Woolwich on 1 April 1748, a post which he held for thirty-two years, until his death in 1780. The chief firemaster was the superintendent of Woolwich arsenal, and Desaguliers was the first scientific maker of cannon and the first regular investigator into the powers of gunnery in the English army. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 5 February 1757, and in 1761 was summoned from his experiments and manufactures to take command of the siege train and the force of artillerymen intended to accompany the expedition to the island of Belleisle, off the west coast of France. This was the first opportunity for testing on a large scale the improvements made in siege artillery since the days of Marlborough, and Desaguliers was able to put his ideas into practice. General Studholme Hodgson was in command, with generals Crauford, William Howe, John Burgoyne, and Guy Carleton under him, and when Desaguliers arrived at Belleisle on 12 April with the temporary rank of brigadier-general, one unsuccessful attempt had already been made to disembark. Desaguliers at once volunteered to reconnoitre, and, by putting some of his heavy guns into ship's boats, managed to cover the landing of the army. The island soon submitted, and General Hodgson directed Desaguliers to form the siege of the citadel. The manuscript journal which he kept during the siege of all his operations forms the basis of the account given of the siege by Francis Duncan in his <span class="italic">History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery</span>. Desaguliers got thirty guns and thirty mortars into battery, fired seventeen thousand shot and twelve thousand shells into the citadel, had great difficulties to contend with owing to the flooding of the trenches, and was wounded five days before the capitulation of the fortress on 7 June.<br>
<br>On his return to England Desaguliers was promoted colonel on 19 February 1762, and made colonel-commandant of a battalion of the Royal Artillery on 10 March the same year. He devoted himself for the rest of his life to his work at Woolwich. His work there was most valuable; he invented a method of firing small shot from mortars, and made the earliest experiments with rockets. Desaguliers's instrument was for many years in use at the royal gun factories for examining and verifying the bores of cannon. In recognition of his scientific work he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1780, being the first officer of Royal Artillery who won that distinction. He was promoted major-general on 25 May 1772, and lieutenant-general on 29 August 1777, and died at Woolwich on 1 March 1780. His daughter Mary Catherine Cotterel was his sole executor and residuary legatee.<br>
