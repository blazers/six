<span class="headword">Shepey,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1412), <span class="occ">diplomatist and ecclesiastic</span>, came from a wealthy bourgeois family of Coventry, where he was born. His paternal grandfather, Lawrence Shepey, was a burgess who had endowed a chantry in St Michael's Church. His father, Jordan Shepey, was one of twelve Coventry merchants who had succeeded in wresting control of the town from the prior and monks of Coventry Cathedral and putting it in the hands of their class; he became second mayor of Coventry under its new charter of 1345.<br>
<br>As befitted the son of a wealthy local family who was heading for an ecclesiastical career, John Shepey became a canon of Lichfield Cathedral on 25 January 1363, and two months later chancellor. In the meantime, on 31 January, he was papally provided to a canonry in Wells Cathedral. By then his university career was well under way: Shepey was <i>licentiatus</i> in civil law at Oxford at the time of his appointment to Lichfield Cathedral. In 1364 and again in 1366 the pope granted him a <i>cum ex eo</i> licence to hold benefices <i>in absentia</i> while studying at university. Shepey was a doctor of civil law by 1367. Notes of lectures given by him in the canon-law school on fourteen titles of the <span class="italic">Decretals</span> have survived  (BL, Royal MS 9 E.viii, fols. 156&#150;66). He was soon active in the church courts: he was dispensed to be an advocate of the court of the arches on 16 October 1367, and became an official at Winchester in the following year.<br>
<br>Shepey's talents also brought him into the royal service. He served on a number of embassies: to Flanders in 1372, to the papal curia at Avignon in 1373 (being arrested by the French <i>en route</i> and released by papal intercession), again to Flanders in 1375, and, in later life, to the Scots in 1397. His service to the crown was rewarded in 1376 by an annual grant of &pound;50 until he acquired a benefice of at least equal value. He had not long to wait. Later in the same year, on 22 December, Shepey became a canon of York Minster. His appointment by the pope to the deanship of Lincoln Cathedral in 1378 met with royal opposition, but, when the dust finally settled, John Shepey was dean of Lincoln and remained so until his death thirty-four years later.<br>
<br>The first in the line of three consecutive long-lived deans of Lincoln, who served for a total of 105 years, Shepey concentrated his energies during his deanship on the affairs of the cathedral and frequently became embroiled in controversy and, indeed, litigation with his chapter. In 1400, for example, Shepey claimed the right to visit the chapter with the power to correct and punish; he also claimed rights in the appointment and dismissal of the lower clergy of the cathedral. The assistance of both Henry IV and the pope, Boniface IX, was appealed to in this matter, until at length, in July 1404, Henry Beaufort, bishop of Lincoln and half-brother of the king, settled the dispute in favour of the chapter.<br>
<br>Shepey's career can be seen as representative of the churchman, who, born into urban wealth, followed a path that led from the study of canon law to service in the church courts, to diplomatic service for the crown, and then to a senior position in the ecclesiastical bureaucracy, in his case the deanship of the cathedral church of England's largest diocese. He died, probably in Lincoln, in 1412: his will, dated 14 January of that year, was proved on 17 March. He left books to New College, Oxford, possibly his old college, and to the Franciscan friars of Stamford Priory in Lincolnshire, as well as a silver cross and a richly decorated vestment to Lincoln Cathedral, where his body is buried. He is to be distinguished from the Benedictine theologian and bishop of Rochester of the same name (<i>d</i>. 1360).<br>
