<span class="headword">Bacon,  Nathaniel</span>  (1647&#150;1676), <span class="occ">politician in Virginia</span>, was born on 2 January 1647, the son of Sir Thomas Bacon of Friston Hall, Suffolk. His mother's name has been given as Elizabeth Brooke but this seems to be a mistaken identification. He attended St Catharine's College, Cambridge, for a while, toured the continent, spent time at Gray's Inn, and graduated MA from Cambridge in 1667. Then in 1670 he married Elizabeth Duke over the strong objections of her parents and his father, and as a result Sir Edward Duke disinherited his disobedient daughter. Bacon now had to scrabble for a livelihood, which involved him in fraudulent land dealings and protracted litigation. His father, fed up with his impish offspring, did what seventeenth-century English parents often did with their mischievous children. He gave Nathaniel &pound;1800 and shipped him, Elizabeth, and their two daughters off to Virginia, where the couple could rely upon family connections as well as their grubstake. Bacon was related to Dame Frances Berkeley (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Culpeper), wife of the governor, Sir William Berkeley, while a cousin, also Nathaniel Bacon, sat on the council of state.<br>
<br>The Bacons landed in Virginia in 1674. Immediately Bacon purchased Curles Neck plantation in Henrico county, miles up the James River from Jamestown, where he fell to growing tobacco and trading with local Native Americans. Well situated, finely educated, bright, but of a gloomy, sometimes arrogant, temperament, and given to impetuousness, he soon gained the acceptance of his fellow planters. Indeed, his proximity to Berkeley brought a political rise that could only be accounted meteoric; on 3 March 1675 he won a seat on the council of state, which high office customarily went to men with records of long service in Virginia's local and provincial governments. Flying so high so fast went to the young councillor's head, and Bacon apparently presumed his new-found rank and nearness to the governor allowed him to question Berkeley's policies openly. That was one in a series of miscalculations that ended up with his becoming a rebel.<br>
<br>Bacon's rebellion exploded suddenly in 1676, following a protracted period of unsettled politics, economic dislocations, and a series of deadly skirmishes between frontier settlers and the Native Americans, which broke out in the summer of 1675. By early 1676 Berkeley's grip on the situation had weakened precipitously. Leading planters in the affected areas openly challenged his ability to lead the colony through its gravest crisis of the century. Bacon too questioned the governor's passive defensive strategies, which made him receptive to pleas that he lead a force of angry, terrorized militiamen against the Native American Indians. When Berkeley tartly refused his request for a commission in April 1676, Bacon took command anyway and attacked Native Americans without regard to who was friend or foe. Berkeley countered by declaring Bacon a rebel, removing him from his council seat, and calling an election for a new general assembly.<br>
<br>Bacon's neighbours promptly elected their hero to a seat in the house of burgesses. When Bacon went to Jamestown to take his place, he was captured, and brought before the council of state on 10 June, where he confessed his error, received Berkeley's pardon, regained his council place, and posted a bond for good behaviour. Several days later he slipped off to his plantation. Meanwhile, the general assembly continued its business of enacting defensive measures against the Native Americans and addressing constituents' complaints about abuses in local government. Its work neared completion on 23 June, when Bacon and a force of men suddenly seized control of the capital. Bacon extorted a commission as general and a pardon, which the terrified members of the assembly voted, but once he left Jamestown Berkeley again proclaimed him a rebel. From this point forward, what had started as a disagreement over Native American policy became a duel to the death between Bacon and Berkeley and their adherents. Throughout the ensuing summer and autumn each sought to gain the upper hand, and in the course of their struggle Berkeley seized Jamestown, only to have Bacon retake it and burn it to the ground. Bacon also promised freedom to servants and slaves who joined him, which cost him support among leading planters. He himself seemed to lack clear goals, and his situation grew more untenable as his men began sacking the estates of men loyal to Berkeley. The revolt came to an abrupt turning-point in October, when on the 26th Bacon unexpectedly died, probably from dysentery, and his followers buried him secretly. Bereft of its leader, the revolt soon collapsed. Berkeley regained control, but not before the crown dispatched a military expedition to smash Bacon and a commission to investigate the causes of the disturbance.<br>
<br>By leading the uprising that bears his name, Bacon became a central actor in colonial Virginia. Adherents adored him as their deliverer, whereas enemies despised him as a traitor. Reverberations of that partisanship echo still in the opinions of modern scholars, who have disagreed even over Bacon's nature and his impulses to rebellion, let alone his proper place in Anglo-Virginian history. Without portraits, diaries, or letters to depict him, only snippets of information remain, and, unfortunately, they are supple enough to form Bacon into variously a hater of Native Americans who destroyed the reputation of an ever popular governor, Sir William Berkeley, a patriot who struck the first blow for American independence, or someone else. Yet however one chooses to view him, his rebellion undoubtedly precipitated major changes for Virginia. The Native American nations nearest to the settlers suffered losses from which they never recovered. Berkeley was disgraced and dismissed. Virginia came under greater royal scrutiny and management after 1676, and the general assembly lost considerable autonomy, while the colony's social order stabilized.<br>
