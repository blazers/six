<span class="headword">Smith,  Frederick Winston Furneaux</span>, second earl of Birkenhead  (1907&#150;1975), <span class="occ">biographer</span>, was born on 7 December 1907 at 70 Eccleston Square, London, the only son and second of three children of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36137/', "Frederick Edwin Smith (1872&#150;1930)")</script>, known always as FE, who became in 1922 first earl of Birkenhead, and his wife, Margaret Eleanor (1878&#150;1968), second daughter of the Revd Henry Furneaux, fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Freddie, as he was called, was a godson of his father's closest friend, Winston Churchill. He was educated at Eton College, where he was elected president of Pop and won the Rosebery history prize, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he played tennis, squash, and fives for the university. He obtained a second class in modern history in 1931. His father was a powerful and dominant figure. Although devoted to his family and always kind to them, he expected and strongly pressed his only son to follow the legal and political career in which he had been such a brilliant success. Smith's talents did not lie in that direction. Although he inherited FE's dark, almost saturnine good looks and something of his addiction to alcohol, which he later overcame, he had neither his father's gift of oratory nor his boundless energy. He preferred literature to law and biography to politics.<br>
<br>In 1930 Smith succeeded to the earldom and to an alarming load of debt. Although devoted to his father's memory he always resented his extravagance and improvidence. He wrote his father's life in two volumes (1933 and 1935) and produced a revised version, <span class="italic">F.E.</span> (1959). He followed this in 1938 with an unmemorable life of Thomas Wentworth, first earl of Strafford. He wrote much better about people whom he knew, and the seventeenth century is a minefield for amateur historians.<br>
<br>In 1935 Birkenhead married Sheila, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/30733/', "William Ewert Berry, first Viscount Camrose")</script>, proprietor of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>. A year later his sister Pamela, later a great political hostess, married Camrose's second son, Michael (later Baron Hartwell). Birkenhead's marriage (of which there were a son and a daughter) put his finances and the succession to Charlton, near Banbury, his father's beloved country house, on to a secure basis. The place became after the Second World War a notable social centre for (suitably selected) members of the literary, academic, and political worlds.<br>
<br>After a spell in the Oxford yeomanry, Birkenhead became attached to the British military mission to the Yugoslav partisans in 1944&#150;5, along with Randolph Churchill and Evelyn Waugh. There are many anecdotes about this ill-assorted trio, some recounted by Birkenhead himself in his chapter in <span class="italic">Evelyn Waugh and his World</span> (1973, ed. D. Pryce-Jones). After the war Birkenhead made biography his main occupation despite a major set-back. His plan, with the apparent co-operation of Mrs Bambridge, the heir and owner of the family papers, was to write a life of Rudyard Kipling, but he unwisely signed a contract with her which gave her sole control over the book as a condition of full access to the papers. After three years' work he submitted a draft only to have it irrevocably vetoed without any intelligible reasons given or any consideration of amendment. Many people read it in typescript. T. S. Eliot found it &#145;slight&#146;, but Sir Roderick Jones, Sir Desmond MacCarthy, Sir John Betjeman, and the author of this entry found her decision incomprehensible. The book was eventually published (as <span class="italic">Rudyard Kipling</span>) with much acclaim in 1978, after both parties to the dispute had died.<br>
<br>Birkenhead's next book was a most entertaining and vivid memoir (1953) of his highly eccentric novel-writing, Gypsy-loving elder sister, Eleanor (who believed quite wrongly that the family had Gypsy blood). He then embarked on the serious biographies which made his name. The first was of Professor F. A. Lindemann, Viscount Cherwell, Churchill's friend and scientific adviser, <span class="italic">The Prof in Two Worlds</span> (1961). This was followed by a life of E. F. L. Wood, first earl of Halifax, whom he had served as parliamentary private secretary from 1938 to 1939, published as <span class="italic">Halifax</span> (1965). Four years later he produced <span class="italic">Walter Monckton</span> (1969). All three are models of serious &#145;first&#146; official biographies, carefully researched and admirably written. When he died in Oxford on 10 June 1975 after a long illness, Birkenhead was engaged on a biography of his famous godfather. It was published in 1989 as <span class="italic">Churchill, 1876&#150;1922</span>. The plan had been for his son (Frederick William) Robin (<i>b</i>. 1936), who succeeded as third earl and was himself the author of an excellent life of William Wilberforce, to complete it. But he died suddenly in 1985. His draft, ending in 1940, has been privately published. Robin never married and the earldom became extinct.<br>
