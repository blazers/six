<span class="headword">Willes,  Richard</span>  (1546&#150;1579?), <span class="occ">poet and geographer</span>, was born on 5 January 1546, one of several sons of a yeoman, possibly Catholic, family of Pulham, Dorset. In 1558 he went to Winchester College, where he was taught by Christopher Johnson, and to New College, Oxford, as a scholar in 1562, but lost his scholarship in April 1564 because of his absence abroad at Louvain. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1565 at Mainz, graduated MA there in 1568 and moved to Trier, where in late 1569 he began training for the priesthood. Sent on a pilgrimage to Rome, he lingered until June 1572 at Perugia as professor of rhetoric. Abandoning his religious vocation, Willes returned to England later that year.<br>
<br>Willes soon published his <span class="italic">Poematum liber</span> (1573), a volume of academic Latin verse, dedicated to William Cecil, Lord Burghley. Included in its second part of scholia was <span class="italic">De re poetica</span>, the first formal defence of poetry to be printed in England, which, like the book as a whole, displays Willes's indebtedness to his studies abroad and to continental scholars such as J. C. Scaliger. Having affirmed his loyalty to the Church of England, he was incorporated MA at Oxford (1574) and Cambridge (1578). His new religious allegiance, although sometimes questioned, seems genuine and he obtained the patronage of the firmly protestant family of Francis Russell, earl of Bedford. In this milieu he studied geography, an interest that went back to his youth, and published the <span class="italic">History of Travayle</span> (1577), dedicated to Bridget, countess of Bedford; it included a treatise on Frobisher and the north-west passage, addressed by Willes to the earl's daughter, Anne, countess of Warwick, an investor in Frobisher's ventures. A major revision of Richard Eden's <span class="italic">Decades of the Newe Worlde</span> (1555), the <span class="italic">History</span> added substantial new material on Asia, nearly all derived from continental sources and including accounts of China and Japan translated by Willes and never before printed in English (he refers to G. P. Maffei, the Jesuit historian of the Indies, as his &#145;olde acquaynted friend&#146;; fol. 253<i>v</i>). It has been judged &#145;one of the outstanding compilations of travel literature to be published in England&#146;  (Parker, 81).<br>
<br>The remainder of Willes's life is uncertain. Gabriel Harvey called him &#145;a greate travelour, very well lernid&#146;  (Smith, 1.126). Edmund Spenser mourned his death in the <span class="italic">Teares of the Muses</span> (first published in 1591, but possibly written earlier, or incorporating earlier material). Francis Meres lauded Willes in <span class="italic">Palladis tamia</span> (1598) among the English Latin poets who &#145;have attained good report and honourable advancement in the Latin empyre&#146;  (Smith, 2.315). Richard Hakluyt used material from Willes's <span class="italic">History of Travayle</span> in the <span class="italic">Principal Navigations</span> (1589; 1598&#150;1600). Willes may be the Richard Willis who married Cicely Bosbye at St Dunstan-in-the-East on 10 July 1575, or the Rycharde Willis buried at St Mary Somerset on 5 March 1579.<br>
