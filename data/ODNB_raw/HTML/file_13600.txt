</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Holmes, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>c.</em>1622&#150;1692), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, was the third son of Henry Holmes of Mallow, co. Cork. His grandfather, a Lancastrian, had been an officer in Elizabeth I's Irish wars. By 1643 he was a cornet in Prince Maurice's regiment of royalist horse, helping to rescue the prince when he was briefly captured, and subsequently fought at the battle of Roundway Down. He seems to have entered the service of Maurice's brother, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, by the mid-1640s, and was certainly in the English force which Rupert commanded in the French army in 1647. He suffered a serious leg wound in a skirmish in July, during the attempted Spanish relief of La Bass&eacute;e. In 1648 part of the parliamentarian fleet revolted and defected to the royalists in the Netherlands. Rupert took command of the royalist squadron towards the end of the year and sailed to Kinsale in January 1649; Holmes was almost certainly with him at this time, and during the squadron's subsequent series of escapades. On 29 February 1652 he was given command of a prize, the <i>John</i>, which had been taken in the Gambia River, and later commanded the four prizes which Rupert's last remaining warship, the <i>Swallow</i>, brought back to France in March 1653. He handled the disposal of the ships and goods for Rupert, but his movements from then until the Restoration are obscure. It was reported in 1658 that he had obtained a commission for a Spanish privateer; his monument in Yarmouth church hints at military service in France, Flanders, and Germany, perhaps as an imperial mercenary.<br>
<br>By early 1660 Holmes was active as a royalist agent, serving as an intermediary with Edward Mountagu, general-at-sea, during April, and after the Restoration he was granted &pound;600 for unspecified services rendered. From June 1660 to November 1660 he commanded successively the Medway guardships <i>Bramble</i> and <i>Truelove</i> before taking command of the <i>Henrietta</i>, intended for a voyage to Guinea to search for a &#145;mountain of gold&#146; which Rupert had learned of in the 1650s. Holmes would also command a squadron containing four other ships, with orders to assist the new Royal African Company's trade in the region. He sailed from Portsmouth on 25 January 1661, reaching the Gambia on 4 March. On 18 March he forced the surrender of the Dutch fort of St Andreas, and after an unsuccessful attempt to find the legendary store of gold, he returned to the Downs on 28 July. The cruise made a loss and brought a storm of diplomatic protest from the Dutch, but it led to Holmes's elevation to captain of the <i>Royal Charles</i>, the flagship of the expedition intended to bring Catherine of Braganza from Lisbon. However, he was dismissed in November for failing to make a Swedish vessel strike her colours in salute. At much the same time he first became well known to Samuel Pepys:<blockquote>he seems to be very well acquainted with the King's mind and with all the several factions at court &hellip; being a cunning fellow, and one (by his own confession to me) that can put on two several faces and look his enemies in the face with as much love as his friends. But good God, what an age is this, that a man cannot live without playing the knave and dissimulation. (Pepys, 2.169)</blockquote>Their relations were soon marred by an apparent attempt by Holmes to seduce Mrs Pepys  (Pepys, 2.237, 3.4), and by Samuel Pepys's consequent suspicion of Holmes's easy charm and liking for fine clothing.<h2>
<a name="Tumultofwar"></a>Tumult of war</h2>Holmes became captain of the new third-rate <i>Reserve</i> on 9 August 1662, taking her on a voyage to the Mediterranean before returning to Chatham in March 1663. His contempt for his ship's master, Pepys's prot&eacute;g&eacute; Richard Cooper, exacerbated his feud with the diarist: Pepys feared for days that his attempt to defend Cooper would lead Holmes to run him through in a duel. The matter was glossed over, and Holmes took the <i>Reserve</i> back south, calling at Lisbon and Tangier before finally paying her off in September. Two months later Holmes received a commission for the <i>Jersey</i> and instructions for another voyage to Guinea. Although ostensibly intended to protect the African Company's trade, the real purpose of the expedition was to disrupt that of the Dutch and to seize Dutch possessions on the Guinea coast. Holmes sighted Cape Verde on 25 December 1663 and two days later captured the <i>Brill</i>, a Dutch West Indiaman, off the Isle of Goree. The next few weeks were spent in preparations for the inevitable local war with the Dutch. On 21 January Holmes attacked Goree, sinking two ships and taking two others, and the island surrendered on the following day. Sailing on to Sierra Leone and Cape Palmas, he took the thirty-gun Dutch vessel <i>Walcheren</i> on 28 March, arriving at Takoradi on 9 April and taking the Dutch fort of Anta on the following day. He attacked Cape Coast Castle on 20 April, although it did not surrender until 1 May, and then took a number of other Dutch positions along the Gold Coast before sailing for England on 16 June. The <i>Jersey</i> reached Plymouth on 6 December and the Downs on the twenty-seventh. By the time of his return, a substantial Dutch fleet under De Ruyter had retaken virtually all of his conquests, and, in turn, a large English fleet under Rupert was fitting out to oppose it. The African Company was baying for compensation, there was a widespread feeling that Holmes had exceeded his instructions, and he was committed to the Tower from 9 to 23 January 1665, and then from 14 February to 6 March. He was examined twice (on 14 January and 3 March), but his final release and eventual pardon on 23 March can be attributed to the fact that due largely to his activities in Africa, England had gone to war with the Netherlands on 22 February. Holmes's command of the <i>Jersey</i> was also notable for its trial of two sea-going pendulum clocks, commissioned by Alexander Bruce, second earl of Kincardine, in search of a solution to the &#145;longitude problem&#146;. On his return, Holmes considerably overplayed the usefulness and accuracy of the clocks, though the voyage does represent the first sea trial of devices successfully developed in the following century.<br>
<br>Before Holmes's pardon was finalized, he was appointed captain of the third-rate <i>Revenge</i> (14 March 1665). At the battle of Lowestoft on 3 June 1665, the <i>Revenge</i> was immediately astern of Rupert's flagship of the White squadron. The death of the rear-admiral of the white in the battle created a vacancy which Rupert requested for Holmes, but the duke of York gave it instead to his own flag captain, John Harman. Holmes bitterly resented the slight and gave up his commission, with Pepys believing that he was &#145;a rash, proud coxcomb&#146; who was &#145;rich, and hath, it seems, sought an occasion of leaving the service&#146;  (Pepys, 6.129). He returned to the fleet for the 1666 campaign, when Rupert was one of the joint admirals. On 27 March he attended the launch at Deptford of his new command, the <i>Defiance</i>, and was knighted on that day. On 29 May Rupert was detached to counter an imaginary French threat from the west, and Holmes became rear-admiral of the red, playing a leading role in the four days' battle that followed. He moved his flag to the <i>Henry</i> on 9 June, fighting in her during the St James's day fight (25 June). On 8 August Holmes was detached from the main fleet, flying his flag in the <i>Tiger</i>, with orders to attack the islands of Vlie and Schelling, along with Dutch shipping in the Vlie anchorage. On the following day his force attacked with longboats and fireships, burning between 110 and 160 Dutch vessels, together with the town of Westerschelling: the action became known to posterity as &#145;Holmes's bonfire&#146;. The fleet returned to harbour in October, and Holmes immediately resumed his feud with the duke of Albemarle's leading naval client, Sir Jeremy Smith, over their respective conduct in the St James's day fight. The submissions made to the king on 21 October were resolved largely in Holmes's favour. In April 1667 Holmes became commander-in-chief of a squadron operating from Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, sailing west in June to escort homeward-bound merchantmen from the Mediterranean before paying off in October. During this period he was loaned a prize ship, the <i>Saint George</i>, as a privateer for three months, but got into trouble with the prize commissioners for keeping her to windward of his squadron in order to seize prizes off the coast of Ireland, &#145;even in sight of the King's ships under your command&#146;  (BL, Harleian MS 1510, fol. 193).<br>
<br>During 1668 Holmes commanded the <i>Cambridge</i> (from March to September) but also became more heavily involved in politics ashore. In January he acted as second to the duke of Buckingham during the latter's duel with the earl of Shrewsbury, receiving a pardon for his part in the earl's death. His quarrel with Smith was carried over into the House of Commons, forming a part of the house's inquest into the naval miscarriages of the war (October 1667, February&#150;March 1668). By December 1668 Pepys believed that &#145;Holmes and [Sir Edward] Spragge now rule all with the duke of Buckingham, as to sea-business, and will be great men&#146;  (Pepys, 9.382). In September of the same year Holmes agreed to purchase the governorship of the Isle of Wight from Sir John Culpepper, assuming the position on 28 December. He had been governor of Sandown Castle since 1660, and on 26 October 1669 he was elected MP for Winchester, serving there until 1679. On 16 January 1672 he became captain of the 90-gun <i>St Michael</i>, sailing with his squadron in March to cruise in the channel with orders to seize Dutch merchantmen. On 13 March he sighted the inward-bound Dutch Smyrna convoy and summoned them to surrender. When the Dutch refused, a general engagement began. The English ships came off badly, with Holmes having to move to the <i>Cambridge</i> because the <i>St Michael</i> was disabled. The action resumed on the next day, but despite being reinforced (by, among others, the <i>Gloucester</i>, commanded by Holmes's brother John) the English were unable to prevent most of the Dutch vessels escaping. The attack on the Smyrna convoy signalled the beginning of the Third Anglo-Dutch War, but also provided ammunition for Holmes in his quarrel with another of his rivals for high command, Sir Edward Spragge, whom he accused of deliberately not bringing his independent squadron to support him. For the remainder of the 1672 campaign, Spragge was a flag officer and Holmes a mere captain. He served at the battle of Solebay (28 May), where the duke of York briefly flew his flag in the <i>St Michael</i> before she became as disabled as his previous flagship, the <i>Royal Prince</i>. Although the ship was repaired and Holmes commanded her for the remainder of 1672, he was overlooked for a flag post and did not serve at sea at all in 1673, despite persistent attempts by the then admiral of the fleet, Prince Rupert, to secure his services. The duke of York, Spragge's patron, steadfastly refused to employ Holmes, and also rejected his candidacy for the governorship of Tangier in 1673. York's removal from the Admiralty and Spragge's death (11 August) came too late to revive Holmes's naval career, and he never served at sea again.<h2>
<a name="IsleofWightgovernorship"></a>Isle of Wight governorship</h2>For the rest of his life Holmes concentrated on his governorship of the Isle of Wight. His wealth from prize money, from rents, his flag officer's pension of &pound;500 a year, and the perquisites due to him as vice-admiral of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, attracted much comment, as in the famous jibe of 1677 often attributed to Andrew Marvell: &#145;Sir Robert Holmes, first an Irish livery-boy, then a highway-man, now Bashaw of the Isle of Wight, got in boons and by rapine &pound;100,000. The cursed beginner of the two Dutch wars&#146;  (Ollard, 14&#150;15). On several occasions he was censured for over-zealous attempts to secure the cargoes of ships wrecked on the island, especially if they were carrying wine. In the spring of 1684 Holmes was threatened with a court martial for making false musters in his regiment, a charge brought by one of his captains, Joseph Brent, and plans were made for the duke of Grafton to succeed him as governor. Holmes attempted stalling tactics, enlisting the support of William Blathwayt, the secretary of war, but the court met at Horse Guards on 27 May under the presidency of the earl of Craven. Holmes was accused of drawing pay illicitly for his steward, two of his gardeners, his coachman, and for men who had been at sea when allegedly present at musters; although the verdict is not recorded, it was almost certainly favourable, as Holmes retained the governorship. There were also positive aspects to his governorship: throughout the 1670s and 1680s he was chiefly responsible for a gradual upgrading of the defences of the island's forts. He moved from Winchester to the parliamentary seat of Newport, Isle of Wight, in March 1679, did not serve in the second or third Exclusion Parliaments, represented Newport again in 1685, Yarmouth in 1689, and Newport once more in 1690&#150;92. Holmes had been a staunch supporter of the court until the mid-1670s, but in 1676 he publicly disagreed with Pepys in parliament over the projected dimensions of thirty new ships, and in 1678 he went over to the opposition, making an ill-judged attempt to reconcile the king and the duke of Monmouth in 1682. Holmes was soon reconciled to the legitimate royal family, and entertained the king when he visited the Isle of Wight in 1684. In August 1687 Holmes was granted a commission to command a squadron to suppress piracy in the West Indies, but the ill health which had dogged him for years prevented him assuming the command. He spent the summer of 1688 preparing the Isle of Wight against an expected Dutch invasion, and was at Bath recovering from gout on 27 September when he received an urgent letter from the king ordering him to return to his post. On 4 November Holmes watched William of Orange's fleet pass the island, and over the next few days he sent a rapid succession of reports to the secretary of state, Preston, recording Dutch movements (including his mistaken opinion that they had to be bound for France) and his pessimism about the state of the island's defences: &#145;I shall not be able to oppose these people &hellip; part of the militia is grown mutinous already &hellip; Yarmouth and Hurst I put my stress upon, and will defend both to the last&#146;  (<span class="italic">Seventh Report</span>, HMC, 1.414). The king's flight, and Lord Dartmouth's subsequent surrender of the fleet at Spithead to William, meant that Holmes had no alternative other than to draft the surrender of the island (17 December).<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Holmes continued to hold the governorship after the revolution, despite unjustified charges of Jacobitism against him. In parliament he opposed the offer of the crown to William and Mary and campaigned vigorously for the removal of Irish troops which had been billeted on the island before being shipped to Germany. Throughout the summer of 1689 Holmes made repeated requests to go to Bath for his health&#151;&#145;I only go to refresh my limbs and get strength to serve him [William III] &hellip; I am now so ill of my limbs that I have not been out of my chamber these two days&#146;  (Isle of Wight RO, GW 10/49, Holmes to Blathwayt, 22 July 1689). He was finally given leave for a month on 25 November 1689. In January 1690 he had the additional stress of having to entertain the queen of Spain (at considerable personal expense). No sooner had he obtained another spell of leave and crossed to the mainland (24 June 1690) than he had to hurry back to the island to defend it against Tourville's French fleet, which he could see clearly from his headquarters at Appuldurcombe both before and after the battle of Beachy Head (30 June). Holmes was increasingly ill during 1691, and died at Yarmouth on 18 November 1692. He was buried at Yarmouth church, where a grand monument was erected to him; the marble statue was allegedly intended to be of Louis XIV, taken from a ship bound for France but wrecked on the island, with Holmes's head substituted for that of <i>le roi soleil</i>. By his will, dated 28 October 1692, Sir Robert made over most of his lands and property to his nephew Henry, the son of his brother Thomas Holmes of Kilmallock, co. Limerick, on condition that Henry married Sir Robert's illegitimate daughter Mary (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1678). The condition was met, and their eldest son was eventually created Lord Holmes of Kilmallock in 1760. Smaller bequests were left to the sons of another brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13596/', "Admiral Sir John Holmes (1639/40&#150;1683)")</script>, although it was a sign of the chaotic nature of Sir John's finances that Sir Robert was still owed many debts from his estate, some of them dating back twenty years. Inventories were made of Holmes's many properties: two houses at Yarmouth (the newer being now the George Hotel, next to the castle), another at Park, Isle of Wight; one at Inglefield Green, Surrey; another at Bath; and the grandest of all, a house in Whitehall which fully reflected the extravagant tastes which Pepys had attributed to Holmes years before.<br>
<br>Holmes's image in history suffered over the years, primarily because of his clashes with Pepys and his reputation as the begetter of two wars. The old canard that he had been responsible for capturing New Amsterdam in 1664, and renaming it New York, took many years to scotch, and was even repeated in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>. Holmes's reputation was finally rehabilitated by Richard Ollard in his biography <span class="italic">Man of War</span> (1969). Undoubtedly brave and passionately loyal to his monarchs, despite propensities for quarrelling, exceeding orders, and self-aggrandizement, he tended to excite strong opinions: Sir William Coventry thought that he possessed &#145;an understanding fit to make a war&#146;  (Longleat House, Coventry MS 102, p. 6), but Clarendon, in many ways Holmes's antithesis, thought him &#145;a very bold and expert man&#146;  (Ollard, 14).<br>
