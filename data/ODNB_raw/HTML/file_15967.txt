<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lancaster,  William</span>  (1649/50&#150;1717), <span class="occ">college head</span>, was the son of William Lancaster of Sockbridge in Barton parish, Westmorland. He was born in Barton and for some time taught at the parish school there. The school was near Lowther Castle, and when Sir John Lowther's son, afterwards Lord Lonsdale, went to Queen's College, Oxford, Lancaster went with him as his servitor. Lancaster was entered as a batteler at the college on 23 June 1670, and matriculated on 1 July that same year, aged twenty. He graduated BA on 6 February 1675, proceeded MA on 1 July 1678 (although the degree was initially stopped for some words Lancaster had said against the proctor, John Clerke of All Souls), BD on 12 April 1690, and DD on 8 July 1692. His career at Oxford was interrupted for a while by a stay in Paris on a state grant to which he had been recommended by Sir Joseph Williamson. On his return to England Lancaster continued to spend most of his time in college, though he was appointed domestic chaplain to the earl of Denbigh and was collated to the vicarage of Oakley, Buckinghamshire, on 1 September 1682. On 15 March 1679 he was made a fellow of Queen's, a post that he retained until his marriage in 1696; from 1686 to 1690 he was first junior and then senior bursar of his college.<br>
<br>From 1690 onwards Lancaster appears to have spent more time in London than in Oxford. He became domestic chaplain to Henry Compton, bishop of London, who nominated him on 22 July 1692 to the vicarage of St Martin-in-the-Fields (vacated by Thomas Tenison when he became bishop of Lincoln), but the rights of presentation were claimed by the queen, who installed Nicholas Gouge instead. Lancaster was finally instituted into the living on 31 October 1694, following Gouge's death. He continued to work closely with Compton, supervising a fund for dispossessed Scottish episcopalian clergy on the bishop's behalf. His wife, the daughter of Mr Wilmer of Sywell in Northamptonshire, was a relative of Compton. Through Compton's favour he was later collated (29 March 1705) to the archdeaconry of Middlesex, a post that he held until his death. Lancaster was also a part of the circle of his fellow Cumbrian and student contemporary, William Nicolson, in London, along with John Waugh, White Kennett, Edward Gee, and Dean Grahme. Nicolson's son, Joseph, studied at Queen's College, and was shown much favour by Lancaster. In return Nicolson appears occasionally to have performed Lancaster's duties at St Martin-in-the-Fields when he was away in Oxford. Lancaster was a popular preacher and on 30 January 1697 he delivered a sermon before the Commons commemorating the death of Charles I. He used the occasion to decry the evil of rebellion, claiming that the greatest danger to William III, who had recently survived an assassination plot, came from the continued belief in a lawful right of resistance. A whig reply to this sermon was belatedly published in 1710, probably to coincide with the trial of Henry Sacheverell.<br>
<br>On 15 October 1704 Lancaster was elected as provost of Queen's College, but the election was disputed as contravening the college statutes. Lancaster's opponents claimed that only present, and not past, fellows of the college could hold the office. In response, Lancaster appealed successfully to the visitor, the archbishop of York, who confirmed the election on 18 November 1704. It was under Lancaster that the rebuilding of the college in the Palladian style was begun, with the provost sinking an estimated &pound;4000 of his own money into the work. His efforts for the corporation of Oxford were repaid with a 1000-year lease to the college of a plot of land on the High Street.<br>
<br>From 1705 to 1709 Lancaster acted as vice-chancellor of Oxford. In administrative terms he rescued the university from the financial chicanery of his predecessor, William Delaune, who had embezzled the profits from the publishing of Clarendon's <span class="italic">History</span>. Academically, he tried to curb the influence of Lockean ideas in Oxford, blocking the appointment of John Wynne, a popularizer of Locke's <span class="italic">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</span>, as Lady Margaret professor of divinity in 1705. However, his intellectual influence was not solely negative. He was a keen promoter of literary talents and promoted the writings of Joseph Addison and Thomas Tickell. Lancaster was a tory, but the expectation that he would be another zealot like Delaune was disappointed. He generally appears to have acted to quell political controversy, taking the decision not to invite Sacheverell or his high-church supporters to preach again after May 1707. Lancaster attempted to co-operate with the government, helping to propose an address on the union of Scotland and England, despite opposition from many university members. His willingness to work with the Godolphin administration brought accusations of &#145;trimming&#146;, but also the possibility that he might be rewarded with a bishopric (St David's and Chichester were both rumoured). Such political pragmatism earned Lancaster the contempt of the arch-tory Thomas Hearne. Lancaster was &#145;smoothboots&#146;, the &#145;Northern bear&#146; (a sneer at the lowly social origins of a man who had risen from village schoolmaster to vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford), and an &#145;old hypocritical, ambitious, drunken sot&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
<br>However, once Sacheverell's trial effectively became a verdict on the revolution of 1688, Lancaster was reluctantly forced to come to his defence. On 14 December 1709 Lancaster took Sacheverell to the House of Lords in his own coach and stood with him at the bar. On 13 January 1710 he put up &pound;3000 bail for him. Clearly, though, there were limits to Lancaster's loyalty to the tory cause and he refused to give a personal testimony to Sacheverell's good character. Lancaster remained an important figure in Oxford after 1709, acting as pro-vice-chancellor, and with Bernard Gardiner of All Souls worked effectively to block the attempts of Francis Atterbury, dean of Christ Church, to reassert tory dominance within the university. In league with Gardiner and Arthur Charlett, Lancaster kept the university politically passive while the country waited to see what changes the death of the queen would bring.<br>
<br>Lancaster died in Oxford on 4 February 1717 of a &#145;gout of the stomach&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>) and was buried in the old church of St Martin-in-the-Fields on 8 February. He left &pound;1000 in his will for the further rebuilding of Queen's. His portrait by T. Murray hangs in the college hall.<br>
