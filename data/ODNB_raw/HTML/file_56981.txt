<span class="headword">R&eacute;mi <span class="st"> [R&eacute;my]</span>,  Philippe  de</span>  (1205<span class="mult">x</span>10&#150;1265), <span class="occ">poet</span>, born in France, was the son of Pierre de R&eacute;my, of the Terre Bernard in Remy (Compi&egrave;gne). In 1237 Philippe was named <i>bailli</i> of G&acirc;tinais for Robert d'Artois, a post he held until Robert's death at Mansourah in 1250. In 1239 he succeeded his father in the Terre Bernard, becoming liegeman, therefore, of the abbey of St Denis. After the death of Robert d'Artois, he continued to serve Robert's widow, Mahaut, acting as counsellor and arbitrator, and, no doubt, participating in the literary activities of her court at Arras. In an act of 1255 he is for the first time referred to as &#145;Phelippes de Remin, chevaliers, <i>sires de</i> <i>Biaumanoir</i>&#146;, the original <i>beau manoir</i> (&#145;fair manor&#146;) having been expanded into a small fief by the acquisition of a chapel. Philippe de R&eacute;mi married twice. His first wife, Marie, is believed to have been the mother of Girard and P&eacute;ronelle. His second wife, Alix de Bailleul, mentioned in documents dated 1262 and 1267, survived him. She was probably the mother of Philippe.<br>
<br>There has been much controversy concerning Philippe de R&eacute;mi's literary achievements, but most modern scholars reject Bordier's hypothesis  (Bordier, 25&#150;39) that all works written by Philippe de R&eacute;mi, sire de Beaumanoir, are attributable to his son, the jurist<a href="#cosubject_56981"> [<i>see below</i>]</a>. After Gicquel's discovery that Rudolf von Ems's <span class="italic">Willehalm von Orlens</span> of 1242 derived from <span class="italic">La manekine</span>, it is now generally accepted that Philippe de R&eacute;mi the younger wrote the <span class="italic">Coutumes de Beauvaisis</span> (see below) and that between 1230 and 1240 Philippe de R&eacute;mi the elder, wrote the works contained in Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, MS Fr. 1588: <span class="italic">La manekine</span>  (fols. 2&#150;56<i>v</i>), <span class="italic">Jehan et Blonde</span>  (fols. 57&#150;96), <span class="italic">Li salu d'amours</span>  (fols. 97&#150;103<i>v</i>), <span class="italic">La complainte d'amour</span>  (fols. 103<i>v</i>&#150;106<i>v</i>), <span class="italic">Le conte de fole larguece</span>  (fols. 107&#150;109<i>v</i>), <span class="italic">Fatrasie</span>  (fols. 109<i>v</i>&#150;110<i>v</i>), <span class="italic">Lai</span>  (fols. 110<i>v</i>&#150;112<i>v</i>), <span class="italic">Ave Maria</span>  (fols. 112<i>v</i>&#150;113<i>v</i>), <span class="italic">Fatrasie</span>  (fols. 113<i>v</i>&#150;114<i>v</i>), <span class="italic">Chanson d'amour</span>  (fol. 114<i>v</i>) (incomplete).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">La manekine</span> (&#145;The Handless Maiden&#146;) blends incest folklore, hagiographic <i>exempla</i>, and courtly topoi into an 8590-line octosyllabic romance. The widowed king of Hungary, wishing to avoid marriage to anyone who did not resemble his dead wife, planned to marry his daughter, Jo&iuml;e. To avoid the incestuous nuptials Jo&iuml;e cut off her left hand which was swallowed by a sturgeon in the river below her window. The heroine, imprisoned, sentenced to burn, set adrift at sea, and subjected to multiple vicissitudes, was eventually rewarded for her virtue and her fortitude. Her identity as Jo&iuml;e rather than &#145;la manekine&#146; was reaffirmed when the sturgeon miraculously reappeared in the church's baptismal water, and the pope was instructed to reattach the severed limb. Jo&iuml;e's husband, the king of Scotland, inherited the territories of Jo&iuml;e's father, who had now repented and abdicated. Jo&iuml;e's sons and daughters became kings and queens of sundry lands, and all lived happily ever after. The underlying moral of these peripaties was enunciated at the end of the romance when R&eacute;mi urged his public never to succumb to despair, whatever their adversities, but to remember <span class="italic">La manekine</span>. If the story was perhaps memorable, its manner of composition was less so and, in the prologue of this first youthful work, Philippe de R&eacute;mi in fact apologizes for his lack of <i>clergie</i> and for never having rhymed before:<blockquote>
<div>molt petit sai de clergie,<br>
</div>
<div>Ne onques mais rime ne fis.<br>
</div>(<div>I have very little learning.<br>
</div>
<div>I have never rhymed before.</div>)<br> (R&eacute;mi, <span class="italic">La manekine</span>, ll. 32&#150;3)</blockquote>Realism rather than the miraculous characterized Philippe de R&eacute;mi's second long romance, <span class="italic">Jehan et Blonde</span>, which narrated the heroic progression of the impoverished hero from <i>ecuyer</i> (&#145;squire&#146;) of the earl of Oxford to penniless knight who married a rich heiress and who then became, after these inspiring triumphs over adversity, count of Dammartin and Oxford. The moral of this second romance also was made explicit: poor young men should leave home and seek their fortune, and, if not, &#145;should have their eyes put out&#146; as punishment for their indolence. H.-L. Bordier and H. Suchier interpreted the author's detailed treatment of the geography and customs of England and Scotland in <span class="italic">La manekine</span> and <span class="italic">Jehan et Blonde</span>, and <span class="italic">Jehan et Blonde</span>'s mischievous imitation of aristocratic <i>franglais</i>, as proof of his having travelled extensively in those lands. They believed that the author was in England between 1261 and 1265. Subsequent research has separated <i>p&egrave;re</i> from <i>fils</i>, and has questioned this chronology. Several modern commentators believe that it is not necessary to posit a cross-channel visit to explain the author's textual references to England and Scotland.<br>

<a name="cosubject_56981"></a><span class="headword">Philippe  de R&eacute;mi <span class="st"> [ de R&eacute;my,  de Beaumanoir]</span></span>  (1250&#150;1296), <span class="occ">administrator and jurist</span>, who should not be confused with his father the poet, succeeded to the title of sire de Beaumanoir after the death of his brother Girard. He was <i>bailli</i> of Clermont (1279&#150;82), seneschal of Poitou (1284&#150;8) and of Saintonge (1287&#150;8), went on a mission to Rome (1289), then was successively <i>bailli</i> of the Vermandois (1289&#150;91), Touraine (1292), and Senlis (1292&#150;6). He died on 7 January 1296, and was buried at Compi&egrave;gne. This second Philippe de R&eacute;mi was responsible for the massive <span class="italic">Coutumes de Beauvaisis</span> (drafted <i>c</i>.1280&#150;<i>c</i>.1283, and continually enlarged and emended), an invaluable early codification of French customary law. The ordered expositions and the pragmatic style of his prose, however lengthy its enumerations, specifications, and provisions, reflect his experience as an administrator and jurist in France's civil courts. As he observed, &#145;clerks have a fine way of talking in Latin, but laymen who must plead against them in civil court do not understand their words even when they say them in French&#146;  (R&eacute;mi, <span class="italic">Coutumes</span>, section 196). The <span class="italic">Coutumes de Beauvaisis</span> employed simple French vocabulary wherever possible, and provided meticulous definitions to clarify technicalities and ambiguities of the law. Philippe de R&eacute;mi's codification of legal practices involving treachery, feudal responsibility, property, and, indeed, guilt, crime, and punishment generally, remains a unique source of information about thirteenth-century French law.<br>
