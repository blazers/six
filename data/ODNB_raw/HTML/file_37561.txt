<span class="headword">Holland,  John Charles Francis</span>  (1897&#150;1956), <span class="occ">army and intelligence officer</span>, was born in India (probably in Calcutta) on 21 November 1897, the only son and elder child of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33945/', "Sir Thomas Henry Holland (1868&#150;1947)")</script>, geologist, and his first wife, Frances Maud (<i>d</i>. 1942), daughter of Charles Chapman, deputy commissioner in Oudh. Close friends called him Jo.<br>
<br>Holland left Rugby School in 1914 for the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and from there he was commissioned into the Royal Engineers on 28 July 1915. He was posted to the eastern Mediterranean, arriving too late for the Gallipoli campaign, but serving on the Salonika front for most of the rest of the First World War. He was mentioned in dispatches in 1917, and in the summer of 1918 was awarded the DFC for gallantry in action with the Royal Air Force. He was badly wounded in Dublin during the troubles of 1919&#150;21, in which he admired the technical skills of his Irish guerrilla opponents.<br>
<br>In 1922 Holland reverted from temporary major to lieutenant; he was promoted captain in 1924 and major seven years later. In 1924 he married Anne Christabel, daughter of Sir James Bennett Brunyate, of the Indian Civil Service; they had two sons and a daughter. Holland passed out from the Staff College, and held a staff captain's appointment in northern command in 1934&#150;6. In 1938, again due for promotion but medically unfit, he took an appointment as a second-grade staff officer in the War Office to conduct research in any subject he chose. He chose irregular warfare. His branch, in which he was at first the only officer, was called GS (R).<br>
<br>Holland's Irish experiences led his lively imagination well outside the normal range of military thinking at the time. Early in 1939 his branch was renamed MI R, and placed in the military intelligence directorate, though Holland concentrated rather on operations. Encouraged by A. P. Wavell, he laid the foundations of several wartime secret services, and was one of the originators of the commandos. For a few months in the summer of 1939 he worked at 2 Caxton Street, Westminster, alongside L. D. Grand, a Woolwich contemporary who ran the then inadmissible section D of the secret service. On the outbreak of war in September Holland went back to the War Office.<br>
<br>Holland gathered like-minded officers round him, and dispatched each in turn to run the service for which he seemed fit: N. R. Crockatt, whose prowess he had admired at Rugby, to secure intelligence from prisoners of war; E. R. Coombe to form the inter-services security board, which handled codenames and deception as well as security; Gerald Templer to run the security of the expeditionary force; and M. R. Jefferis to invent and exploit secret gadgets. He sent Colin Gubbins to the independent companies in Norway, then to command projected stay-behind parties to damage the communications of any invading German forces, and eventually to run the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The latter was formed in July 1940 when Holland's staff, and Grand's, and a semi-secret propaganda branch of the Foreign Office were amalgamated.<br>
<br>Holland thereupon went back to regimental duty, on being offered a regular lieutenant-colonel's command. By July 1943 he was back in the War Office as deputy chief engineer and a major-general. He was appointed CB in 1945, and was admitted to the American Legion of Merit and received the medal of freedom with silver palm. In 1947&#150;8 he was chief of staff, western command; in 1949&#150;50 he was again employed, briefly, on secret planning; and he retired in 1951.<br>
<br>Holland was a shortish, burly man who went bald early; a heavy cigarette smoker; quick-tempered, but recovering fast from anger. He died at his elder son's house in Wimbledon on 17 March 1956.<br>
