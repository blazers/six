<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Pauncefote,  Julian</span>, Baron Pauncefote  (1828&#150;1902), <span class="occ">lawyer and diplomatist</span>, was born on 13 September 1828 at Munich, Bavaria, the third and youngest son of Robert Pauncefote 
    (formerly Smith; 1788&#150;1843)
   of Preston Court, Preston, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Emma Smith (<i>d</i>. 1853), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25863/', "John Raphael Smith")</script>, artist and engraver. His father, who had inherited Preston Court from Sir George Pauncefote of Stoke Hall, had sufficient means for the family to spend much of their time abroad, and the young Pauncefote grew up fluent in French and able to understand both German (which he did not speak) and Italian. His first school was in Passy, France, where instruction was entirely in French; his second was the Pensionnat Janin, Geneva. However, after 1840 the family spent more time in England and in 1843 his father died. In August 1843, when he was nearly fifteen, Pauncefote was one of the first 218 pupils enrolled at Marlborough College, Marlborough, Wiltshire, the decidedly robust environment of which, in his biographer's words, &#145;helped to fortify his solid English character and sound common sense&#146;  (Mowat, 6). Appointed a prefect in 1844, he left in the summer of 1845, intended, like his brother Bernard, for a career in the Indian army. He was commissioned in the Madras light infantry but did not serve; the death of his eldest brother, Robert, in 1847 caused him instead to stay in London and to read for the bar at the Inner Temple.<h2>
<a name="LegalpracticeinBritainandabroad"></a>Legal practice in Britain and abroad</h2>Pauncefote was called to the bar on 4 May 1852 and practised for some ten years, interrupted, with important consequences for his future, by three months as private secretary to Sir William Molesworth, a position which reflected his membership at that time of a circle as noted for its artistic interests as for its Benthamite reforming zeal. It was thus that he met and later married, on 19 September 1859, Selina Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1926), daughter of Major William Cubitt of Catfield Hall, Norfolk. They took up residence at 18 Chapel Street, Bedford Square, London. On 11 July 1860 a son was born, but lived for only three weeks. Almost at the same time Pauncefote lost almost all his private fortune by the collapse of a bank. He determined to repair his fortune by legal practice abroad and in 1862 sailed for Hong Kong accompanied by his wife and newborn daughter, the first of four daughters who were to survive him.<br>
<br>Hong Kong in 1862 was a turbulent place, and crime and piracy were rife. In May 1866 Pauncefote was appointed acting attorney-general of the colony, and on 22 July attorney-general, a post which left him free to continue his private practice and accumulate a moderate fortune (which, however, he lost in a second crash in 1874). Over the next seven years he worked with Governor Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell to reform the police and improve the administration of justice, being himself responsible for preparation of the colony's code of civil procedure. As attorney-general Pauncefote also deputized for the chief justice of the supreme court while the latter was on leave. During his own two periods of leave, in 1867 and 1871, he visited Shanghai. On leaving Hong Kong in December 1873 he was knighted for his services.<br>
<br>Pauncefote had left Hong Kong to take up the new post of chief justice of the Leeward Islands. After eighteen months at home he went out to Antigua in January 1874, leaving his family in London. His brief mission was successful though he did not enjoy it and missed his family. Fortunately he was soon able to return to the UK where he took a house for his growing family on The Green at Richmond. Lord Carnarvon, the colonial secretary, had noted his high legal reputation and wished him to succeed Sir Henry Holland as legal assistant under-secretary in the Colonial Office, which he did in September 1874. In this capacity Pauncefote helped facilitate the Disraeli ministry's purchase of the Khedive's Suez Canal Company shares.<h2>
<a name="AttheForeignOffice"></a>At the Foreign Office</h2>In 1876 a similar post was created in the Foreign Office and Pauncefote was appointed to it by the foreign secretary, Lord Derby. In January 1880 he was created KCMG and three months later CB. In 1882, in a striking breach with precedent, the foreign secretary, Lord Granville, insisted he be appointed permanent under-secretary of state in succession to Lord Tenterden, many of whose duties Pauncefote was already discharging. On 1 October 1882 Granville wrote to Gladstone about Pauncefote: &#145;I have the highest opinion of his abilities, character and industry. He is popular in the office and with the Corps Diplomatique, an excellent Frenchman and his knowledge of law is constantly of use&#146;  (Fitzmaurice, 2.446).<br>
<br>Pauncefote's seven years as permanent under-secretary confirmed this high opinion. He had come to enjoy sunshine and found his return to London a real hardship. However, he was wholly dedicated to his work, which he enjoyed immensely; his principal and almost sole recreation being to enjoy a quiet Sunday with his family. Otherwise, according to his daughter Sibyl, he never liked being more than a brief drive from a railway station from which he could get back to work. Every working day he received the day's dispatch boxes in the morning at his home at 14 Cromwell Place and minuted the incoming correspondence, then some 60,000 items a year, for the secretary of state. He would then lunch and set off for the office at a quarter to two, remaining at his desk until seven o'clock or later. He was a member of Arthur's Club and the Wellington, but seldom went to either.<br>
<br>Though the Eastern question had been temporarily resolved in 1878, many tensions remained, and it fell to Pauncefote to deal with the thorny problem of navigation of the Danube. Dilke said &#145;that Pauncefote was the only man in England who understood it&#146;  (Mowat, 38). The European commission which he proposed to oversee the dredging of the mouth of the Danube was to survive even the First World War. It was Pauncefote, too, who proposed the plan which resolved tension with Germany over the settlement of New Guinea  (Fitzmaurice, 2.430). But the free navigation of waterways was to be a continuing theme of his diplomatic career. In 1885, together with Sir Charles Rivers Wilson, he was appointed a delegate to the international commission in Paris on the free navigation of the Suez Canal, negotiating the draft settlement on which was based the convention of Constantinople (29 October 1888) which established the right of free passage in both peace and war. He was created GCMG in the new year honours list of 1886 and KCB in 1888.<h2>
<a name="AmbassadortotheUnitedStates"></a>Ambassador to the United States</h2>On 2 April 1889 Lord Salisbury appointed Pauncefote minister to the United States. The post had been left vacant for some months following the recall of Sir Lionel Sackville-West, Lord Sackville, until the new president, Benjamin Harrison, had taken office. Salisbury needed to appoint someone of sufficient seniority to soothe ruffled feelings, who had not previously served as ambassador. He sounded out Pauncefote, who enthusiastically agreed, believing as he did in the prime importance to Britain of the unity of the English-speaking peoples. In 1893, congress having decided to make it possible, Britain became the first country to raise diplomatic relations with the USA to ambassadorial level.<br>
<br>As a diplomatist Pauncefote showed &#145;solid rather than showy qualities&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 16 May 1902). His legal training was of inestimable value, since he had to deal with men who were also lawyers, and from the beginning he recognized the need to cultivate not only the members of the administration but leading members of the senate. Though he was perhaps less sensitive to the need to cultivate public opinion, and may have missed opportunities, more importantly he never put a foot wrong. To his success his warm personality and generous nature undoubtedly contributed much; Cecil Spring Rice commented in June 1891: &#145;I like old Pauncefote, who is kindness itself&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Friendships</span>, 1.113). Pauncefote himself generously said that &#145;his success in Washington&#146; (in a career lasting from 1889 to 1902) &#145;was due to two of his secretaries, Michael Herbert and Cecil Spring Rice&#146;, neither of whom served with him, however, after 1895  (<span class="italic">Letters and Friendships</span>, 1.177). On other occasions he expressed equal appreciation of the support of his wife and eldest daughter, Maud, hostesses at the embassy on Connecticut Avenue.<h2>
<a name="Earlynegotiations"></a>Early negotiations</h2>The first major issue with which Pauncefote had to deal was the pelagic seals dispute. In 1881, on behalf of the American government, Secretary Blaine, whose hostility to Canada was notorious, claimed jurisdiction over the whole Bering Sea. British policy had to steer a fine line between letting the Canadian sealers down on the one hand and arousing American demands for annexation on the other. The importance of conservation was recognized by both sides and a <i>modus vivendi</i> established. Finally in February 1892 the issue was referred to the decision of an international commission of arbitration at Paris which in August 1893 rejected the American claim that the Bering Sea was territorial waters but confirmed the <i>modus vivendi</i>.<br>
<br>A much more serious challenge was posed by the Venezuelan boundary dispute. The dispute itself was of long standing and reflected the uncertainties of map making in the early nineteenth century, when Britain had been awarded Guiana. It erupted into public notice when on 20 July 1895 Secretary of State Robert Olney sent an intemperate note to London asserting the right of the United States to intervene in the dispute and citing the Monroe doctrine in support of his view. Unwisely as it turned out, Lord Salisbury believed that the matter was not urgent and could wait. Four months later he replied with a cool note denying the applicability of the doctrine. President Cleveland was incensed, and on 17 December sent a special message to congress. In it he stated that repeated American attempts to resolve the dispute had failed through British obduracy and that if necessary the United States should intervene to determine the correct line. &#145;Even Pauncefote, shrewd and experienced, very much <i>persona grata</i> in American political and government circles, and intimate enough with Olney to have an excellent basis for judgment, underestimated the moral content of the American stand&#146;  (Campbell, 25). Fortunately, though he did not hurry to do so, in February 1896 Salisbury agreed to arbitration, effectively conceding the Americans' right to intervene while denying them the opportunity to do so. In the event the arbitral award followed the existing line of demarcation (the Schomburgk line) with only two significant deviations in favour of Venezuela: a complete vindication both of British contentions and Pauncefote's skill as a negotiator.<br>
<br>In January 1897, therefore, the queen was able to announce to parliament the conclusion both of the Venezuelan arbitration agreement and of a general treaty of arbitration with the United States (the Olney&#150;Pauncefote treaty). The latter, which reflected Pauncefote's personal commitment to the rule of law and the ideal of arbitration as a method of settling international disputes, was the first of its kind and in scope was much broader than those agreed upon later under presidents Roosevelt and Taft. The McKinley administration gave it its full support in the senate, but in the only major disappointment of Pauncefote's career it failed of ratification by forty-three votes to twenty-six, three votes short of the necessary two-thirds, on 5 May 1897.<h2>
<a name="TheCubanWar"></a>The Cuban War</h2>The explosion of the USS <i>Maine</i> in Havana harbour on 15 February 1898 raised passions which President McKinley, who was anxious to avoid war if at all possible, worked skilfully to restrain. Secretary of State William R. Day indicated that he would be prepared to listen to a European initiative. As dean of the diplomatic corps it fell to Pauncefote to lead the group of six who presented a prearranged joint message to the president on 5 or 6 April urging restraint. Neither the message nor the reply, which claimed that the situation in Cuba had become &#145;insufferable&#146;, nor the statement of Spain's position composed, at Pauncefote's suggestion, by the Spanish minister in Washington, had much effect, however  (Offner, 167&#150;8).<br>
<br>When McKinley finally sent his message to congress to obtain congressional authority for military intervention in Cuba, Pauncefote was deeply upset at his suggestion that the &#145;civilized world&#146; approved of the American position. Given that the Spanish had agreed to all the demands presented up to that time, he believed that military force was an unjustified act of aggression and that a peaceful settlement was still possible. He was also concerned about the dangerous precedent that American seizure of Cuba would have for other European colonies in the Caribbean. Hence on 14 April he held a meeting at the embassy to urge a second European d&eacute;marche, urging the American government to accept the Spanish minister's memorandum as the basis for peace, but for a variety of reasons none of the European governments concerned accepted the suggestion. During the war Pauncefote continued his efforts to bring about an early peace. The administration, however, was unwilling to take any action until both Cuba and the Philippines had been secured. Meanwhile British opinion had tended to side with the United States. A particularly enthusiastic speech by Joseph Chamberlain created problems for British diplomatists in Europe, but the overall effect of this support was further to improve the growing understanding between London and Washington.<br>
<br>At the end of the war John Hay was recalled from his post as ambassador to London and replaced Day as secretary of state in September 1898. As his biographer writes:<blockquote>He had, fortunately, a warm coadjutor in the British Ambassador, Sir Julian &hellip; Pauncefote, a diplomatist, conciliatory, open-minded, very sensitive to questions of honor, ready to assume, until he had proved to the contrary, that his colleagues' intentions were as honest as his own. During nearly four years he and Secretary Hay worked together to harmonise the interests of their respective countries. (Thayer, 2.202&#150;3)</blockquote>Pauncefote was in fact due to retire in September 1898, having reached the age of seventy. However, in view of the need for continuity he was asked to stay on&#151;as it turned out, indefinitely.<h2>
<a name="PanamaCanalnegotiations"></a>Panama Canal negotiations</h2>The main issue with which Hay and Pauncefote had to deal was that of Britain's attitude towards an isthmian canal. The voyage of the USS <i>Oregon</i> round Cape Horn from San Francisco to Santiago de Cuba made the need for one obvious. The United States, however, by the Clayton&#150;Bulwer treaty of 1850, had first to get Britain's agreement. To forestall the danger that congress might act unilaterally, at Hay's request in December 1898 the possibility of revising the treaty was put to Lord Salisbury by the American charg&eacute; d'affaires, Henry White. Salisbury agreed, stipulating only that tolls levied should be the same for all users, and suggested that, given his special knowledge of the question, Pauncefote should conduct the negotiations with Hay in Washington.<br>
<br>Negotiations were held up by the concurrent dispute about the Alaskan boundary, which after some moments of tension was resolved by treaty in 1902. Meanwhile Pauncefote was appointed senior British delegate to the first Hague conference (1899). He could not persuade the other countries to accept the principle of binding arbitration but they did agree to establish a permanent tribunal to which nations might have recourse, in recognition of which Pauncefote was appointed Britain's first member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration and raised to the peerage on 18 August 1899. On his return to Washington the Panama Canal negotiations were resumed. Britain's three main proposals&#151;that the new treaty merely amend that of 1850, that the canal should not be fortified (on the analogy of the Suez Canal), and that the same tolls should be charged to all nations&#151;were accepted and on 2 February 1900 Pauncefote was authorized to sign the resulting treaty, known in the USA as the first Hay&#150;Pauncefote treaty. Three days later it was sent to the senate, where it immediately ran into trouble. The main bone of contention was the provision that the canal should not be fortified, and an amendment making this possible was one of three attached to the treaty when it eventually was passed in December 1900 with five votes to spare.<br>
<br>Britain therefore rejected the first treaty in February 1901. Pauncefote again returned to London for instructions and on his return he and Hay drew up a draft which, while maintaining the principle of equal tolls, abrogated the Clayton&#150;Bulwer treaty rather than amending it and allowed the United States to fortify the canal provided that free passage was allowed to the ships of neutral nations in time of war, as at Suez. This draft Hay sent to the American ambassador in London, Joseph Choate, and it was he who with Lord Lansdowne, the new foreign secretary, was mainly responsible for shaping the final form of the new agreement. This, the second Hay&#150;Pauncefote treaty, was signed on 18 November and approved by the senate by seventy-two votes to six on 16 December 1901.<br>
<br>By this time Theodore Roosevelt had succeeded McKinley as president, and Pauncefote, like his immediate successor Sir Michael Herbert, was one of those who belonged to Roosevelt's inner circle. &#145;He admired, liked, and trusted them, and they understood America and in turn were beloved by Americans that knew them&#146;  (Beale, 132). Pauncefote had been made an honorary doctor of laws of both Harvard and Columbia universities in 1900. He was suffering increasingly badly, however, from gout, and in April 1902 he sustained a major heart attack, believed at the time to have been precipitated by the German ambassador's allegation that in 1898 Pauncefote had been secretly working against the United States. After a short rally he died in his sleep in the embassy residence on the morning of 24 May 1902. The measure of the success of his unique mission was that there followed, in his daughter's words, a &#145;wonderful expression of sorrow, of esteem and even affection&#146;  (Mowat, xv). President Roosevelt broke with precedent by flying the American flag at half-mast on the White House and personally attended the official funeral ceremony organized by the American government on 28 May at St John's Episcopal Church, Washington, where Pauncefote had regularly worshipped. As a further courtesy the ambassador's body was conveyed to Southampton on the USS <i>Brooklyn</i> for interment in the family graveyard at St Oswald's Church, Stoke, near Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, on 15 August 1902.<br>
