<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Anderson,  Arthur</span>  (1792&#150;1868), <span class="occ">shipowner</span>, was born at Grimista, near Lerwick, Shetland Islands, on 19 February 1792, the eldest son of Robert Anderson. After a brief education from a local minister, his earliest employment was as a &#145;beach boy&#146;, preparing dried fish. In 1808 he joined the Royal Navy as a volunteer and in 1810 he became a midshipman, serving as a captain's clerk. In 1815 he was discharged from the navy and went to London. He was taken on as a clerk by Brodie McGhie Willcox, a shipbroker and commission agent, and the two men became partners in 1822. In the same year Anderson married Mary Ann Hill, daughter of Christopher Hill, a Scarborough shipowner. In 1825 the firm of Willcox and Anderson first went into shipowning and traded to the Iberian peninsula, first with sailing ships, then chartered steamers.<br>
<br>Between 1826 and 1834 Portuguese trade was disrupted by a struggle for the Portuguese throne between liberals and conservatives. Combining their political beliefs with their business interests, Willcox and Anderson supplied arms to the liberals and assisted with their final successful campaign in 1832&#150;4. A similar conflict between liberals and conservatives then flared up in Spain. In the First Carlist War (1833&#150;9) Willcox and Anderson backed the liberals and provided the ships which carried the British Legion to Spain in 1835 to fight the Carlists. The liberal victories in Portugal and Spain ensured that Willcox and Anderson had strong local support for their business activities.<br>
<br>Willcox and Anderson decided to establish a regular steamship line between Britain and the Iberian peninsula. They would manage steamers chartered from Captain Richard Bourne of the Dublin and London Steam Packet Company. The British government supported the service by giving a mail contract to the new firm, the Peninsular Steam Navigation Company. The service began in September 1837. It was then proposed that the service should be extended to Alexandria. Passengers and mail could then cross Egypt and link up with a steamer service from the Red Sea to India. In 1839 the firm obtained a government mail contract to India and in 1840 it changed its name to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P. &amp; O.). In the same year the firm obtained a royal charter and increased its authorized capital to &pound;1 million. Willcox and Anderson were managing directors, with Anderson, known for his forceful character and strong opinions, as the more active of the two men.<br>
<br>Despite the fact that his company relied heavily on government subsidies through mail contracts, Anderson was a free-trader and a member of the Anti-Corn Law League. In September 1847 he was elected as a radical Liberal MP for Orkney and Shetland, whose representation had earlier been controlled by the earl of Zetland; he held the seat until July 1852. He supported the abolition of the <span class="roman">Navigation Acts</span> in 1849 and fiercely resisted parliamentary criticism that P. &amp; O. had received too many government mail contracts. By 1845 the company was carrying mails beyond India to Singapore and Hong Kong, and in 1852 P. &amp; O. was given the mail contract to Australia as well.<br>
<br>In 1853 problems with the supply of coal to P. &amp; O.'s home port of Southampton led Anderson to establish a steam colliery company, but its ships were requisitioned by the government during the Crimean War. On their return the coal problem did not seem so urgent and Anderson sought to find them work elsewhere. The steam colliery company was renamed the Union Steam Ship Company and in 1857 it secured the mail contract from Britain to Cape Colony and Natal. Anderson remained chairman of Union until his death and its operations had links with those of P. &amp; O. in the Indian Ocean. The Union Line was linked in 1900 with Donald Currie's Castle Line to form the Union Castle Line, the principal shipping line to South Africa.<br>
<br>Between 1835 and the time of his death Anderson was an important link between his home islands and developments in the wider world. He set up the Shetland Fishery Company in 1837 and used his Spanish connections to revive the market for Shetland dried fish in that country. Anderson encouraged the hosiery industry in the islands and successfully agitated for mail to be carried to the Shetlands by steamship. He also set up a newspaper, a school, and a home for the widows of fishermen in the Shetlands.<br>
<br>Between 1840 and 1855 the P. &amp; O. fleet grew from seven to forty-two steamships, but such expansion led to financial problems. Willcox and Anderson agreed to repay a substantial part of their income to assist the company. Willcox withdrew from active management during the 1850s, but Anderson remained at the forefront, even after he became chairman in 1862 on the death of Willcox. In 1858 P. &amp; O. regained the Australian mail contract lost shortly after the Crimean War, and in 1864 the first P. &amp; O. steamer reached Japan. By the time of Anderson's death in 1868 the P. &amp; O. had the largest commercial fleet of steamships in the world and provided the main link between Britain and its imperial possessions in India, the Far East, and Australia.<br>
<br>Anderson, who was chairman of the General Association of Steamship Owners, wrote a number of pamphlets on general questions of policy, including steam communication with the Orient (1843) and the importance of steamships for Britain's national defences (1852). He had a series of steam yachts for relaxation and was active as a philanthropist. He set up a retirement fund for P. &amp; O. employees and established a school in Southampton for the children of the staff. At his home, The Grove, Norwood, south of London, he endowed a working men's institute. Anderson died of bronchitis at 18 Park Lane, London, on 27 February 1868.<br>
