<span class="headword">Miller, Sir  James</span>  (1905&#150;1977), <span class="occ">builder and local politician</span>, was born on 16 March 1905 in Morningside, Edinburgh, the second of the three sons of James Miller (<i>d</i>. 1922), architect. He was educated at George Heriot's School, Edinburgh, and at the age of fourteen was apprenticed to his father, while studying architecture in the evenings at Edinburgh College of Art.<br>
<br>After his father's death Miller, at the age of seventeen, took over the firm, turning his attention to building inexpensive private houses. In 1927 he built a development of twelve semi-detached bungalows, which sold quickly, despite their relatively high price of &pound;840 each, and went on to produce a highly successful design, the two-bedroom &#145;Type A&#146; bungalow, built of reconstituted stone and concrete, which cost only &pound;475, with a deposit of &pound;25 and weekly payments of 17<i>s</i>. The business grew rapidly as developments went up in all parts of Edinburgh. He increased the range of designs to six, while buying land on the outskirts of the city for future developments, and he formed a partnership with his younger brother, John Manson Miller.<br>
<br>In 1933 Miller married Ella Jane, daughter of John Stewart, an Edinburgh butcher. They had three sons and one daughter. The business was converted into a limited liability company, James Miller &amp; Partners Ltd, in 1934, with all the shares owned by Miller and his two brothers, and it went on to become the largest housebuilding company in Edinburgh. As well as building private houses and flats, the company managed garages, cinemas, and dance-halls, and Miller was also a director of the builders' merchant John and James Lawrence, an important supplier of pre-cast stone.<br>
<br>During the Second World War the business undertook government contracts, building airfields and factories, and in 1941 embarked on open-cast mining contracts in Yorkshire for the government. Offices in London and Wakefield were opened, and in 1942 it took over L. J. Speight &amp; Partners, a contracting firm in London. After the war James Miller &amp; Partners built thousands of council houses for local authorities all over the country. Miller designed a new, non-traditional house, built of brick or concrete with standardized components produced in his own factories at Craigleith and Granton: 7000 were built in the early 1950s. In the later 1950s Miller, who was in charge of the housing side of the business, designed new houses for the private market, while his brother John expanded the company's mining concerns in Yorkshire and Northumberland, and handled the contracting. Two of Miller's sons were taken into the business.<br>
<br>During the 1960s a group structure began to evolve, and in 1970 the Miller Group was formed, including Miller Construction and Miller Homes Northern. Miller retired from the day-to-day management of the company, and established Heritable Development Consultants, which was later incorporated into the Miller Group. He resigned his Miller Group directorships in 1973, and his son James became managing director of James Miller &amp; Partners while his son Roger became managing director of Miller Homes Northern.<br>
<br>Miller was elected a member of Edinburgh town council in 1936, serving until 1954. He was a JP from 1942. He held various offices, including that of city treasurer in 1946, and he was lord provost of the City of Edinburgh in 1951&#150;4. In 1953 he was knighted, and the honorary degree of LLD was conferred on him by Edinburgh University. A businessman in London as well as Scotland, Miller was an alderman for Bishopsgate in 1957&#150;72, and served as lord mayor of London in 1964&#150;5: during that year he devoted himself full-time to his official functions, and left his brother and sons to run the business. He was the first, and only, person to have held the offices of both lord provost of Edinburgh and lord mayor of London. He was made GBE in 1965.<br>
<br>Miller was a keen sailor, and after the death of his youngest son in a road accident in 1966 he gave &pound;75,000 towards the cost of building the training ship the <i>Malcolm Miller</i>. He also bought the former Clyde puffer <i>Auld Reekie</i>, and fitted it out as a training ship. Despite his London interests in the latter part of his life, Miller remained firmly based in Scotland: he loved highland gatherings, and was chieftain of the highland gathering at the Festival of Scotland held in Richmond, Surrey, in 1973. It was he who instituted the highland games at Murrayfield in Edinburgh. He died on 20 March 1977 in Edinburgh, survived by his wife. His remains were cremated at Warriston on 23 March.<br>
