<span class="headword">Spender,  (John) Humphrey</span>  (1910&#150;2005), <span class="occ">photojournalist and artist</span>, was born at 47 Campden House Court, Kensington, London, on 19 April 1910, the third son and youngest of the four children of (Edward) Harold Spender (1864&#150;1926), journalist and author, and his wife, Violet Hilda, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Schuster (1878&#150;1921). He was a brother of the poet <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57986/', "Sir Stephen Spender")</script>. In early life his myopia was, bizarrely, misdiagnosed as a symptom of congenital syphilis, and he was forbidden to read, initially for a year, and later in artificial light, contributing, he believed, to his much heightened visual sense. He was educated at Charlcote School, Worthing, at a school in London, and at Gresham's School, Norfolk, before spending a year in Freiburg im Breisgau studying art history and perfecting his German. He then spent four years at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, London, qualifying in 1933. He never practised as an architect, however, instead setting up a photographic studio in the Strand with his lover Bill Edmiston. Much of his income initially came from portraiture, but an assignment photographing housing conditions in the East End of London led to commissions from the <span class="italic">Left Review</span> to take pictures of the Jarrow marchers and the British Union of Fascists' rally at the Albert Hall.<br>
<br>In 1935 Spender joined the <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> for which, as Lensman, he covered numerous stories in the UK and abroad before resigning on a point of principle in 1937. He travelled frequently to Germany, where he was almost arrested at the Nazis' notorious Degenerate Art exhibition of 1937, after he had been overheard praising the art on display. He and his brother Stephen travelled often with Christopher Isherwood, and Humphrey Spender designed the dust jacket of Isherwood's <span class="italic">Goodbye to Berlin</span> (1939) and took the iconic photograph of Isherwood standing at a window, which was later reproduced on the jacket of <span class="italic">Christopher and his Kind</span> (1973). Meanwhile he had been persuaded by Tom Harrisson to join the team of Mass-Observation, and took more than 900 photographs in Bolton (Worktown). These he always took covertly, declaring that a photograph was &#145;spoiled&#146; if its subjects had noticed his presence. He took a similar series of documentary photographs elsewhere for Stefan Lorant's <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>, whose staff he joined soon after its launch in 1938. At one point the mayor of Newcastle was driven to complain that Spender's photographs only ever showed the seamier side of Newcastle life. He was conscripted in 1941, and after a brief period in the Royal Army Service Corps spent the rest of the Second World War as an official photographer and interpreter of photo-reconnaissance pictures.<br>
<br>On demobilization Spender returned briefly to the <span class="italic">Picture Post</span>, but after he had won a textile design competition (judged by his friend Henry Moore) Robin Darwin, rector of the Royal College of Art, invited him to join the staff of the textile department, where he remained as a tutor from 1953 until 1975. He won four awards from the Council for Industrial Design for his textile and wallpaper designs, and his work was reproduced by companies including Sandersons and the Edinburgh Weavers. He also painted&#151;his greatest passion&#151;and designed murals for the television pavilion at the Festival of Britain, and for the P&amp;O liners <i>Canberra</i> and <i>Oriana</i>. Solo exhibitions of his work were held at the Leicester and Redfern galleries, the New Art Centre, and various provincial galleries. In 1982 he published some of his Mass-Observation photographs in <span class="italic">Worktown People</span>, and others were included in David Jury's boxed set, <span class="italic">In Darkest England</span> (1998). Deborah Frizzell's book <span class="italic">Humphrey Spender's Humanist Landscapes: Photo-Documents, 1932&#150;1942</span> had meanwhile been published the previous year, to coincide with an exhibition at the Yale Center for British Art. His final publication, <span class="italic">Morocco</span> (2004), was a record of a <span class="italic">Daily Mirror</span> assignment in 1935.<br>
<br>Spender was married three times. His first marriage, on 13 July 1937, was to Margaret (Lolly) Low, a 28-year-old architect whom he had met at the Architectural Association, and daughter of V. Warnen Low, surgeon. They adopted a son. Her death on Christmas day 1945 inspired Stephen Spender's &#145;Elegy for Margaret&#146;. Spender married second, on 20 March 1948, Pauline Wynn, a 29-year-old actress and radio dramatist, and daughter of Group Captain Wynn Elias Wynn, RAF officer. They had one son. She died in 2003, and on 18 June that year he married his by then long-term companion, Rachel Anne Hewitt, a photographer and artist, and daughter of James Roy Hewitt, painter. She was fifty-five years his junior. Spender's wives were aware of his bisexuality, and the first two tolerated his many affairs with both men and women, who reputedly included Frederick Ashton and Paul Robeson's wife, Eslanda. From 1968 he lived at The Studio, Ulting, Maldon, Essex, a modernist building that was the first built work by the then unknown architect Richard Rogers. He died there on 11 March 2005, of heart failure, and was survived by his wife, Rachel, and his two sons. His Worktown photographs are now owned by Bolton Museum and Art Gallery.<br>
