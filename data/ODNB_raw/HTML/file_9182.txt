<span class="headword">Farquharson,  James</span>  (1781&#150;1843), <span class="occ">writer on science</span>, was born at Coull, Aberdeenshire, the son of John Farquharson, excise officer. Educated first at the parochial school at Coull, he went in 1794 to King's College, Aberdeen, where he graduated AM in 1798, and in 1799 he was appointed schoolmaster of Alford, Aberdeenshire. He then began to study theology, and was licensed to preach. On 17 September 1813 he was ordained minister of Alford, where he remained thereafter. On 19 October 1826 he married Helen, daughter of Alexander Taylor, with whom he raised a family of five sons and a daughter.<br>
<br>Farquharson's leisure was devoted to theological and scientific study, in particular meteorology, though his knowledge extended also to botany, chemistry, zoology, and the agriculture of his region. Several of his scientific essays dealt with the aurora borealis, which he studied closely for many years. In 1823 he published in the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Philosophical Journal</span> a far more accurate description of the aurora than had previously appeared. In the Royal Society's <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> for 1829 he reported new observations that showed that the structure and motion of the aurora's arches and streamers followed the lines of the earth's magnetic field, proving that they represented the same phenomenon. Although this assumption was correct, Farquharson erred in believing that the visible aurora lay in the lower atmosphere&#151;on one occasion he believed it to occur below the stratus layer. For his observations on the aurora he was elected to the Royal Society in January 1830.<br>
<br>In a paper published in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> for 1836, Farquharson explained the formation of ice at the bottom of running water, a phenomenon already discussed by Arago and others, in terms of the radiation of heat from the bottom of the stream cooling its bed more quickly, under certain conditions, than the water flowing over it. He also sent the Royal Society copies of the registers of temperature that he kept for a long period of years. This led him to investigate the origin and progress of currents of colder and warmer air moving over the face of a flat country surrounded by hills, and their effects upon vegetation. His paper on the nature and localities of hoar frost was of sufficient agricultural interest to be published in the <span class="italic">Transactions</span> of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland for 1840.<br>
<br>Farquharson corresponded with like-minded scientists in Scotland and England, and contributed frequently to the <span class="italic">Aberdeen Journal</span>. The university of King's College conferred upon him the degree of LLD on 25 February 1837, and the following year he became an honorary member of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Fran&ccedil;aise de Statistique Universelle. He was considered a moderate in ecclesiastical matters, and conservative in his political views. His writing included religious works: his essay &#145;On the form of the ark of Noah&#146; (published 1831) was followed by an account of the animals designated in the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span> by the names of Leviathan and Behemoth, and by <span class="italic">A New Illustration of the Latter Part of Daniel's Last Vision and Prophecy</span> (1838). He furnished the account of the parish of Alford for the <span class="italic">New Statistical Account of Scotland</span> (vol. 12, 485&#150;524). Farquharson died on 3 December 1843 at Alford.<br>
