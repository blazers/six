<span class="headword">Shiels,  George</span>  (1881&#150;1949), <span class="occ">playwright</span>, was born on 24 June 1881, one of seven sons in a family of eight, to Robert Sheills (<i>fl</i>. 1880&#150;1920), and Elizabeth, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sweeny (<i>d</i>. 1925), in Ballybrake, near Ballymoney, co. Antrim. Shortly after his birth the family moved into the small town of Ballymoney, where his father was a railway worker. George received the basic primary education then available to about the age of twelve. It is not known how he was occupied between about 1893 and 1900, when he emigrated to the United States. There he worked at a variety of casual jobs, mining and farming, in the west, and may have married in Oregon (the matter remains obscure). Having made his way to western Canada, Shiels suffered a serious accident in 1904 while working on the Canadian Pacific railroad. He spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair. He returned to Ballymoney about 1908 and set up a small travel and shipping business in Main Street.<br>
<br>While in hospital in Canada, Shiels began to read serious literature, and he later said that <span class="italic">Pride and Prejudice</span> fired his imagination. Thereafter he read widely, and like so many Irish writers of the time was largely self-taught. Once home Shiels took a correspondence course with the Pelman School of the Mind, London, and gradually began to write. His first efforts seem to have been westerns, partly based on his experiences in Oregon and Manitoba. In 1916 two stories appeared in the <span class="italic">Irish Weekly</span>. He then turned to drama and, under the name George Morshiel, wrote three plays between 1918 and 1920 for the Ulster Literary Theatre (founded on the model of the Abbey Theatre). These plays, &#145;Away from the Moss&#146;, &#145;Felix Reid and Bob&#146;, and &#145;The Tame Drudge&#146;, remain unpublished. Shiels's first play under his own name, the one-act <span class="italic">Bedmates</span>, staged at the Abbey on 6 January 1921, was published in 1922 and launched the career of one of Ireland's most popular playwrights of the first half of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Shiels went on to write twenty-one plays for the Abbey, roughly the same number as Lennox Robinson, with whom he may be compared. Shiels was not as sophisticated as Robinson but early learned the skills of the Abbey comedy so ably demonstrated in Robinson's prototypal <span class="italic">The Whiteheaded Boy</span> (1916). Shiels's <span class="italic">Paul Twyning</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">Professor Tim</span> (1925) are similarly genial, gently satirical, and well-crafted comedies of rural Irish life. What lent strength to Shiels's comedies was the fine company of players then working at the Abbey. Thus <span class="italic">Bedmates</span>, though but a trifle, had in the cast Barry Fitzgerald, Michael J. Dolan, and Maureen Delaney, while F. J. McCormick played the lead in the first <span class="italic">Professor Tim</span>, accompanied by Sara Allgood as Mrs Scally and Eileen Crowe as her daughter Peggy. The enormous popularity of these and other Shiels plays, revived again and again for decades, is bound up with the strengths of such performers. To a large extent the plays were vehicles for the Abbey style of acting.<br>
<br>Yet Shiels could also be a serious playwright, and <span class="italic">The New Gossoon</span> (1930) is usually singled out as evidence of this. Even <span class="italic">Bedmates</span>, short though it is, offers evidence that Shiels always had ambitions above the writing of farce. That play's basis of a dispute in a guest-house over who should rent a bed, is at the same time a political allegory: a northern protestant and a southern Catholic are set at odds by a conniving Englishman. The issue becomes how the Orangeman and the nationalist can co-habit, without sawing the bed in half! <span class="italic">The New Gossoon</span> explores the new, post-treaty Ireland, by using the character of Luke Carey on a noisy motorbike to shatter the peace and moral ideas of the older generation. Similarly <span class="italic">The Passing Day</span> (1936) provides, in a form which goes beyond realism, a fairly hard-hitting critique of the materialism of small-town Ireland. And <span class="italic">The Rugged Path</span> (1940), as a kind of anti-pastoral play, explores violence in the Irish countryside and the politically contentious issue of informing against wrongdoers. Not surprisingly, Shiels struck a nerve with this play. <span class="italic">The Rugged Path</span> ran for three months at the Abbey, where a rapid change of programme was the norm. Shiels wrote a sequel, <span class="italic">The Summit</span> (1941), where social conscience leads to solidarity against the vicious family threatening decent people. Shiels was aware that at this time the question of standing up to the violence of the IRA, then waging a campaign in England, was topical. &#145;The reaction in Ireland to the Coventry martyrs has amazed me. To advocate the exercise of a public conscience after that would probably be regarded as &#147;playing England's game&#148;&#146;  (Kennedy, 53). These two plays challenged traditional attitudes towards the nationalist question. A few years later he was less successful in tackling the issue of the great famine of 1845&#150;7. <span class="italic">Tenants-at-will</span> (1945), written to commemorate the centenary, proved too serious for the Abbey audience and its failure was a bitter blow to Shiels.<br>
<br>In 1932 Shiels moved to New Lodge, Carnlough, in the Glens of co. Antrim and, abandoning his little business in Ballymoney, lived entirely by his writing, in the company of his brother Eddie and sister Mary. He rarely saw one of his plays on stage. Yet he was not reclusive, and loved to hear news and stories of the people of co. Antrim who provided the raw material of his comedies of manners and intrigue. A modest man, he refused an honorary degree from Queen's University, Belfast, and membership of the Irish Academy of Letters. Shiels was a member of PEN (Dublin centre). He died in New Lodge, Carnlough, on 19 September 1949 after a long illness and was buried in Ballymoney on 21 September.<br>
