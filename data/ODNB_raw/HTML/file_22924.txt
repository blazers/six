<span class="headword">Pye, Sir  Walter</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1571, <em>d.</em> 1635), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was born at The Mynde in Much Dewchurch, Herefordshire, and baptized there on 1 October 1571, the first child of Roger Pye (<i>d</i>. 1591) and his wife, Bridget (<i>d</i>. 1624), daughter of Thomas Kyrle of Walford, Herefordshire. He was admitted a commoner at St John's College, Oxford, in 1585, and entered New Inn in 1589. Transferring to the Middle Temple the following year, he was called to the bar in 1597, was Lent reader in 1618, and treasurer in 1626&#150;7. On 22 July 1602 he married Joan, daughter of William Rudhall of Rudhall, Herefordshire, and his wife, Margaret; they had fifteen children. She died on 10 September 1625 and on 31 October 1628 he married Hester (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1643), daughter of John Ireland and widow of Ellis Crispe, alderman of London; she died about 1643.<br>
<br>The family of Pye or Apie (that is ap Hugh) had been minor gentry in Herefordshire from at least the fifteenth century, but Walter Pye's fortune was small and no match for his appetite for land purchases. He seems first to have sought advancement by attaching himself to Charles Howard, earl of Nottingham: it was probably through his influence as high steward of the borough that he was elected MP for Scarborough in 1597. Afterwards he built up his practice as a lawyer, and it was another twenty years before his next preferment. He and his younger brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37872/', "Robert Pye (bap. 1585, d. 1662)")</script> attached themselves to George Villiers, marquess of Buckingham, probably as legal and financial adviser respectively, and through the favourite Walter Pye was made chief justice in Glamorgan, Brecknockshire, and Radnorshire in February 1617. In February 1621 he was knighted and made attorney of the court of wards and liveries. He sat in parliament for Brecon borough in 1621, 1624, and 1625, and for Herefordshire in 1626 and 1628&#150;9. In both 1626 and 1628 he was also elected for Brecon; on the latter occasion he surrendered his seat to his eldest son, also Walter (1610&#150;1659).<br>
<br>Pye was recognized by his contemporaries as a learned and ingenious but unscrupulous lawyer, which made his talents both feared and much demanded. In 1607 there were complaints in Herefordshire of his &#145;underhand dealing&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 11042, fols. 11&#150;12) and in 1631 a Welsh victim of one of his judgments tried to run him through with a sword. Criticism of his attorneyship of the court of wards mounted towards the end of his life. In 1633 it was said that he &#145;does now what he pleaseth&#146; and that a new master of the court was needed to restrain his power  (Birch, 2.229). Later there were allegations that he suppressed the evidence of witnesses and overruled and directed juries. Sir Richard Hutton called him &#145;more than ordinarily covetous&#146; and reckoned that he &#145;advanced the profit&#146; of the court of wards &#145;excessively&#146;, getting thereby a great estate and preferring his children &#145;in ample manner&#146;  (CUL, MS 6863, fol. 81<i>r</i>). Nevertheless, his income was probably never more than &pound;2000 per annum. Pye died on 25 December 1635 and was buried in Much Dewchurch on 9 January 1636; at his death he was mocked as &#145;the devil's Christmas Pye&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 465, fol. 62<i>r</i>).<br>
