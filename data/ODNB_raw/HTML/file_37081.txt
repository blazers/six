<span class="headword">Young, Sir  William Mackworth</span>  (1840&#150;1924), <span class="occ">administrator in India</span>, was born at Cookham, Berkshire, on 15 August 1840, the third son of Captain Sir George Young, second baronet (1797&#150;1848), RN, of Formosa Place, Cookham, and his wife, Susan (1804/5&#150;1895), daughter of William Mackworth Praed, serjeant-at-law, of Bitton Court, Devon. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37075/', "Sir George Young, third baronet (1837&#150;1930)")</script>, was his eldest brother, and Winthrop Mackworth Praed (1802&#150;1839), poet and politician, was a maternal uncle. Young, known throughout his life as Mackworth, was a scholar of Eton College and of King's College, Cambridge, and a fellow of King's from 1863 to 1869. He joined the Indian Civil Service in 1862, and in December the following year was posted to the Punjab as an assistant commissioner. It was a felicitous assignment: the Punjab service had a history of evangelicalism and easily accommodated Young's own commitment to missionary endeavour. He became a member of the Church Missionary Society corresponding committee for the Punjab and Sind. His first marriage, on 17 August 1869, to Isabel Maria (1841/2&#150;1870), daughter of Charles Boileau Elliott, rector of Tattingstone, Suffolk, was performed by John Barton of the Church Missionary Society. Unhappily, Isabel died in the following May, two weeks after giving birth to a daughter, Isabel Mary.<br>
<br>Young was quickly singled out for secretariat work. In 1875 he became settlement secretary to the Punjab financial commissioner, in 1878 acting superintendent of Kapurthala, and in 1880 chief secretary to the Punjab government, in which post he remained for seven years. On 21 April 1881 he married Frances Mary (<i>d</i>. 1932), daughter of his chief, Sir Robert Eyles Egerton. Egerton thought highly of his son-in-law's abilities, but although Young officiated in several important posts, including that of provincial home secretary (1888), he repeatedly missed out on the best appointments. In 1893&#150;4 he presided over the Indian hemp drugs commission, and in September 1895 was made resident of Mysore, a princely state in southern India. Finally, in March 1897, Lord Elgin appointed him lieutenant-governor of the Punjab, the post he had coveted most, and promoted him to KCSI (he had been made a CSI in January 1890).<br>
<br>Young's lieutenant-governorship was dominated by two issues: the administration of the north-west frontier and the transfer of land from indebted peasants to urban trading castes. On the latter subject, Young argued that the laws of political economy should be applied regardless of societal differences, but in the face of the government of India's enthusiasm for intervention he drew up a bill which allowed for a minimum of legislative interference. In October 1900, when it came before the central legislative council, he spoke against it but did not vote on it, a compromise which in Lord Curzon's eyes had neither the merit of loyalty nor that of conviction.<br>
<br>Young's accommodating demeanour and thin, almost ascetic, appearance belied a tenacious and inflexible nature. In Curzon, however, he met his match, especially on the subject of the north-west frontier. Young was jealous of encroachments on his authority, but Curzon was determined to free the frontier from the Punjab's lumbering administrative machinery. In September 1900, frustrated by Young's touchy reaction to criticism, Curzon sent his proposals for a separate frontier agency direct to the secretary of state for India in London without first consulting Young. Young was furious; while he did not expect support from his own frontier specialists (each of whom, hoping to be chosen chief commissioner of the new province, had privately told Curzon to go ahead), he had expected to have sufficient warning to rally old Punjab hands in London against Curzon's plans. His ire stemmed in part from being comprehensively outmanoeuvred by the viceroy.<br>
<br>Relations worsened in the summer of 1901 when Young learned that Curzon intended to shift the Punjab's summer capital from Simla. In a widely reported speech at a Masonic banquet, Young let it be known that he looked forward to &#145;a hill station where the full glare of the Supreme Government might be softened by distance&#146;. He apologized almost instantly for his indiscretion, but although Curzon accepted the apology graciously, he henceforth spurned Young's social invitations because of what he insisted was the vituperative backbiting of Young's wife. Young was a courteous and scholarly man with a fine ear for music, and an evening at the gubernatorial residence, Barnes Court, was considered one of Simla's more refined social offerings. The viceroy's refusal to go there pitched Simla society into turmoil and deeply offended Young. Upon leaving India in February 1902 he rebuffed Curzon's farewell courtesies, observing bitterly that he had publicly dishonoured him and his wife.<br>
<br>In retirement, Young settled at St Leonards and, despite capricious health, became vice-president of the Church Missionary Society, chairman of the Church of England Zenana Missionary Society and of the Church Education Corporation, and a member of the Central Board of Missions. He died on 10 May 1924 at his home, Lerryn, Weybridge, and was buried on 13 May at Weybridge parish church. He was survived by the daughter of his first marriage, and by his second wife and four sons and a daughter from his second marriage: the eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/34769/', "Gerard Mackworth-Young (1884&#150;1965)")</script> of the Indian Civil Service, was a director of the British School of Archaeology at Athens; the second, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37077/', "Major Sir Hubert Winthrop Young (1885&#150;1950)")</script>, was governor of Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia, and Trinidad and Tobago; the third, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51588/', "Sir Mark Aitchison Young (1886&#150;1974)")</script>, was chief secretary of Palestine and governor of Barbados, Tanganyika, and Hong Kong; the youngest was Norman Egerton Young (1892&#150;1964), of the Treasury and government director of the Suez Canal Company; the daughter of his second marriage, Lucia Katherine Young, married Arthur John Beamish and was an associate of the Royal College of Music and a professional singer.<br>
