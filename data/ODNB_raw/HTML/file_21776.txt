<span class="headword">Peeters,  Gerard</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1562?, <em>d.</em> 1598), <span class="occ">author</span>, was probably the child baptized on 20 September 1562 at Arundel, Sussex. His father may have been William Peeters of Arundel. Having been educated at Westminster School, where he was a queen's scholar, Peeters was elected in 1582, as an alumnus of that foundation, to a closed scholarship at Trinity College, Cambridge, from which he matriculated a member of Cambridge University on 13 October of that year. Despite the date of his election it was only in April 1583 that his formal admission as a scholar of Trinity College was recorded. He graduated BA in June 1586.<br>
<br>In October 1589 Peeters became a minor fellow of Trinity College, advancing to become a major fellow there in May 1590, in which year he proceeded MA. The senior bursar's accounts show him receiving his quarterly fellow's stipend from 1590 to 1593. His name does not feature in these accounts for either 1594 or 1595, suggesting that he had vacated his fellowship at the end of the fourth quarter in 1593. Peeters was incorporated MA at Oxford on 9 July 1594.<br>
<br>There is a long-standing tradition&#151;at least as old as 1861&#151;that Peeters was the author of two Latin works which challenged Alexander Dickson's ideas on artificial memory as being, in Eleanor Rosenberg's words, &#145;impious and vain&#146;  (Rosenberg, 38 n. 23). Prominently dedicated to Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, Dickson's book was entitled <span class="italic">Alexandri Dicsoni arelii De umbrarationis &amp; judicii, sive, De Memoriae virtute prosopopoeia</span> (1583). The works attributed to Peeters are: <span class="italic">Antidicsonus cuiusdam Cantabrigiensis G. P. accessit libellus, in quo dilucide explicatur impia Dicsoni artificiosa memoria</span> (1584) and <span class="italic">Libellus de memoria, verissimaque bene recordandi scientia</span> (1584). The <span class="italic">Antidicsonus</span> was answered by Heius Scepsius (a pseudonym for Dickson) in <span class="italic">Heii Scepsii defensio pro Alexandro Dicsono arelio adversus quendam G. P. Cantabrigien</span> (1584), which, like Dickson's earlier tract, was dedicated to Leicester. More definitely Peeters can be said to have contributed a Greek verse to the tribute to Sir Philip Sidney by Cambridge University: <span class="italic">Academiae Cantabrigiensis lachrymae tumulo nobilissimi equitis, D. Philippi Sidneii</span> (1587).<br>
<br>The date and location of Peeters's ordination (or ordinations) is obscure. His ecclesiastical preferments all seem to have lain within the diocese of Chichester, which was largely co-extensive with Sussex. In September 1591 he was instituted to the vicarage of Poling (near Arundel) on the presentation of William Day, provost of Eton College. The following February Peeters was presented by the crown to the Lewes rectory of St Peter in Westout and St Mary in Westout. Nevertheless it is not clear whether or not this presentation took effect, not least because, although the grant passed the signet office, a docket apparently remains among the state papers (domestic) and no notice of his institution has been found. What is known is that, described as vicar of Poling and rector of St John's sub Castro in Lewes, he was dispensed in January 1593 to hold two livings in plurality on the grounds that he was chaplain to Thomas Sackville, first Baron Buckhurst. In fact Peeters's institution to the latter benefice took place, following Buckhurst's presentation, in February 1593. In November the chaplain was further instituted to the rectory of Plumpton on the presentation of one Richard Leeche. By now Peeters had exceeded the terms of his dispensation, which probably explains why he resigned Poling vicarage by 22 April 1594. Even so he was both collated and installed in April 1596 to the prebend of Hampstead in Chichester Cathedral. This preferment was not Peeters's first link with the cathedral, for the dean and chapter had in May 1593 appointed him their attorney in the matter of a livery of seisin concerning the rectory of Bedingham. His career as a prebendary began inauspiciously: failing to appear in June 1596 for the election of Anthony Watson as bishop, Peeters was declared contumacious. In May 1597 he protested for residence following the next vacancy among the residentiary canons, but died before that vacancy occurred.<br>
<br>Peeters wrote his will on 12 September 1598, and was dead by 22 November, when his successor was instituted to the rectory of Plumpton. Describing himself as of Lewes, yet mentioning only his Plumpton benefice, he asked that his body be buried at the discretion of his sole executor, his wife. He made generous provision for his mother; his son, Henry; his daughter, Joan; and the child with which his wife, Elizabeth, was then pregnant. If Henry died before reaching twenty-four then &pound;20 of his &pound;80 cash bequest was to be delivered, within one year of his death, to the mayor and four senior burgesses of Arundel to be employed, but without diminution, for the benefit of four poor folk there. Peeters's kindred were to be given preferential treatment in this charity should need arise. Having made various other provisions he devised the residue of his estate, which included land in Lewes, to his widow. Peeters's wife, Elizabeth (<i>b</i>. in or after 1567, <i>d</i>. in or after 1599), was one of the nine children of Dr Henry Blaxton or Blackstone (<i>d</i>. 1606) and his wife, Joan Nunn (<i>d</i>. 1607). Probate of Peeters's will was granted in the prerogative court of Canterbury in May 1599, when Elizabeth Peeters was still alive; her date of death is uncertain. It is not known where Peeters was buried, though it was not at Plumpton.<br>
