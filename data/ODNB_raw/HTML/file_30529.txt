<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bailey,  Philip James</span>  (1816&#150;1902), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Nottingham on 22 April 1816, the only son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1057/', "Thomas Bailey (1785&#150;1856)")</script>, merchant, newspaper editor, and author, and his first wife, Marie-Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Taylor (<i>c</i>.1791&#150;<i>c</i>.1818). He showed an early interest in his father's poetical tastes, which his father stimulated by taking him to see Byron's lying-in-state at the Old Blackamoor's Head in Nottingham High Street, and by encouraging him to learn by heart the whole of <span class="italic">Childe Harold</span>. Educated in Nottingham, he was tutored in classics by Benjamin Carpenter, a Unitarian minister. In his sixteenth year Bailey matriculated at Glasgow University with a view to the Presbyterian ministry; but quickly renouncing this ambition, he began in 1833 to study law in a solicitor's office in London, and on 26 April 1834 he was entered a member of Lincoln's Inn. His legal studies were interrupted by his poetic pursuits, and in particular by the reading of Goethe's <span class="italic">Faust</span>. He felt compelled to produce his own version of the legend, and retired for that purpose in 1836 to the seclusion of his father's house at Old Basford, near Nottingham, where after three years he completed the original version of his poem <span class="italic">Festus</span>. It was printed in Manchester by W. H. Jones, and published at his father's cost without the author's name in London by William Pickering in 1839.<br>
<br>On the whole the reception of <span class="italic">Festus</span> was enthusiastic. If <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> (21 December 1839) pronounced the idea of the poem to be &#145;a mere plagiarism from the &#147;Faust&#148; of Goethe, with all its impiety and scarcely any of its poetry&#146;, Bulwer Lytton, R. H. Horne, and Mary Howitt joined with other leading figures in a chorus of praise, and some of these reviews are reprinted in the second edition.<br>
<br>Bailey married Anne Reed on 23 April 1840 at St Giles, Camberwell, and on 7 May of that year he was called to the bar, although he never practised. The couple had a daughter and a son (baptized Philip Festus James) but the marriage was not happy, in part because of the wife's intemperance. Anne Bailey lived off and on with her mother, and Bailey returned to Nottingham to help his father edit the <span class="italic">Nottingham Mercury</span>.<br>
<br>A second edition of <span class="italic">Festus</span> appeared in 1845. Bailey had made large additions, and when Tennyson wrote to Edward FitzGerald urging him to order it, he also cautioned &#145;You will most likely find it a great bore but there are really <i>very grand</i> things in Festus&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Alfred Lord Tennyson</span>, 265). The second edition brought <span class="italic">Festus</span> its remarkable popularity in America; seventeen &#145;editions&#146; of a version pirated in Boston were called for in the first nine years, and it was also reprinted numerous times in Philadelphia, Louisville, and New York. Bailey became something of a &#145;lion&#146; for visiting Americans of the transcendental stamp. Nathaniel Hawthorne visited in the 1850s and described the poet as a &#145;dark, handsome, rather picturesque-looking man, with a grey beard, and dark hair. &hellip; there is a sadness glooming out of him, but no unkindness nor asperity&#146;  (N. Hawthorne, <span class="italic">English Note-Books</span>, 2 vols., 1856, 2.92). Unfortunately, the processes of addition and recasting went on in later editions until, in the eleventh or jubilee edition of 1889, the work reached more than 40,000 lines. That volume incorporated the greater part of three volumes of poetry, which Bailey had published separately. These were <span class="italic">The Angel World, and other Poems</span> (1850), which attracted the attention of the Pre-Raphaelites, and was noted by W. M. Rossetti for review in <span class="italic">The Germ</span>; <span class="italic">The Mystic, and other Poems</span> (1855); and <span class="italic">The Universal Hymn</span> (1867). Although the popularity of <span class="italic">Festus</span> fluctuated, it was alive at the end of the nineteenth century, and a <span class="italic">Festus Treasury</span> was edited by Albert Broadbent in 1901.<br>
<br>Bailey's poetic power was never so fresh and concentrated as in the first edition of <span class="italic">Festus</span>. His later additions turned the poem into a theological and metaphysical treatise, for which some critics claimed high philosophical merits, but beneath which the poetry was smothered. Theodore Watts claimed that the poem contained &#145;lovely oases of poetry&#146; among &#145;wide tracts of ratiocinative writing&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 1 April 1876). Bailey was often regarded as the father of the &#145;spasmodic&#146; school of poetry, and satirized as such along with Alexander Smith and Sydney Dobell by W. E. Aytoun in <span class="italic">Firmilian</span> (1854); but in his last year he denied the imputation in a long letter in which he restated, with a self-satisfied seriousness, the intention of his work.<br>
<br>Bailey wrote a play on the subject of Aurungzebe, admired by Talfourd but, despite an introduction to Macready, the play was not produced and was finally destroyed by Bailey in a fit of despondency. Besides the volumes afterwards incorporated in <span class="italic">Festus</span>, he published <span class="italic">The Age: a Colloquial Satire</span> (1858).<br>
<br>In 1856 Bailey received a civil-list pension of &pound;100 in recognition of his literary work. After the death of his father in the same year, Bailey began an unsettled time of living in a number of seaside villages. His marriage became worse, and with the advent of the new divorce law escape was possible. The court for divorce ruled in his favour on 27 May 1862, after adultery with a Mr Shenton was proved; Bailey's son testified, though both he and the daughter were estranged from their father thereafter. On 24 February 1863 Bailey married Anne Sophia (<i>d</i>. 1896), daughter of Alderman George Carey of Nottingham. In 1864 they settled in Jersey, and from there paid frequent visits to Europe, including Rome and Naples, where Bailey witnessed the eruption of Vesuvius in 1872. In 1876 he returned to England, where he settled first at Lee near Ilfracombe, and in 1885 at Blackheath. Finally he retired to The Elms, 54 Ropewalk, in his native Nottingham. In 1901 Glasgow University conferred an honorary LLD degree on him in his absence. He died after an attack of influenza on 6 September 1902, and was buried in Nottingham cemetery on the 9th.<br>
