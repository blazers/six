<span class="headword">Faithorne,  William</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>William Faithorne the younger]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1670&#150;1703), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was the eldest son of the engraver <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9102/', "William Faithorne (c.1620&#150;1691)")</script>, and his wife, Judith (<i>d</i>. 1690), said to be the sister of Captain Grand. He was apprenticed to his father for eight years on 2 January 1683 in the Goldsmiths' Company. He never took up his freedom. As an artist Faithorne the younger is known only as the author of forty-three mezzotint plates. The earliest, datable 1688&#150;9, were published by Grace Beckett, the widow of Isaac Beckett, and by William Beckett, who was probably Isaac Beckett's son.<br>
<br>One further plate from the same years was published by Faithorne's father, who emerged from retirement to do so. This lends support to John Bagford who, in his biography of the father, says in his inimitable spelling that &#145;the misfortune of his eldest sonne mutch broke his sperits althou of a rabust and stron constitusion&#146;  (Colvin, 133). George Vertue noted that the younger Faithorne never published one of his own plates, and comments that &#145;he was somewhat negligent of his affairs that put him under a necessity of working for them [publishers]&#146;  (Vertue, 1.141). It was presumably this same incompetence that prevented his taking over his father's business.<br>
<br>Faithorne was bequeathed two-thirds of his father's estate in 1691, and henceforth most of his plates were published by the leading London printseller Edward Cooper. His last datable plate is of the duke of Ormond, which was made in or shortly after October 1702. As a mezzotint engraver, in Vertue's opinion, Faithorne &#145;arrived to a considerable perfection&#146;  (Vertue, 1.141), but he has never been regarded as a major figure in the history of English mezzotint. Faithorne was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields on 7 February 1703. Vertue states that he died young, aged about thirty. This would place his birth around 1673, but this is probably a few years too late, given that he was apprenticed in 1683.<br>
