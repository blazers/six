<span class="headword">Kebell,  Thomas</span>  (<em>c.</em>1439&#150;1500), <span class="occ">lawyer</span>, was the third son of Walter Kebell and his second wife, Agnes, daughter of John Folville of Rearsby in Leicestershire. His father's background is hazy but from at least 1420 Walter was steward of the honour of Abergavenny, the dower of Joan Beauchamp, Lady Bergavenny. He later served the lord treasurer, Richard, Lord Cromwell, but it was probably the Beauchamp connection that secured his marriage to Agnes, the daughter of the royal coroner for Leicestershire, and eventually half the estates of her long-established county family. About 1454 Thomas Kebell entered the Inner Temple, and his name came to figure prominently in records connected with the educational work of the inn. He became a bencher, and a partial text of what is probably his second law reading exists in the British Library  (BL, Hargrave MS 87, fols. 302&#150;8). Kebell built a highly successful midlands practice upon service to the locally dominant Hastings retinue, as both attorney-general to the family and as the counsel of choice to the Hastings affinity. He remained a client of the Hastings family until his death.<br>
<br>From 1477 Kebell was retained by the duchy of Lancaster. In 1483, probably through the influence of William, Lord Hastings, Kebell replaced Richard Empson as duchy attorney-general but was promoted serjeant-at-law in 1486 to allow Empson to be restored to office. Commissioned as justice of assize on the northern circuit from February 1494, Kebell became second justice at Lancaster in 1495. In June of that year he took the oath as a royal counsellor and in November became a king's serjeant, sitting in the Lords in that capacity in 1497. In 1499 he was appointed justice at Chester.<br>
<br>Inheriting no land himself, Thomas Kebell was the fortunate beneficiary of a gift in the late 1460s of a sizeable estate in and around Great Stretton near Leicester. The donor was a distant relative, Richard Hotoft, esquire, of Humberstone, who may already have financed Kebell's training at the Inner Temple, and it was probably this new status (in addition to the support of William, Lord Hastings) that accounted for his appointment as a Leicestershire JP in 1474. Thereafter by careful investment of his &#145;winnings&#146; from the law&#151;and shrewd if not sharp speculation&#151;Thomas Kebell built up a substantial estate in some twenty villages in the county, with possibly other property outside. In 1476 or 1477 he purchased the Hotoft manor and house at Humberstone near Leicester which he made his home, a substantial two-storied building of fourteen rooms, with offices. Much of his estate was devoted to sheep farming and after his death his flock was inventoried at over 3500.<br>
<br>Although never a judge at Westminster, Kebell is of unique interest among late medieval common lawyers because of the comprehensive documentation that has survived about him. As well as the law reading, this includes his will, inventory, inquisition post mortem and a very large number of his law opinions which throw considerable light on contemporary legal ideas and practice; Kebell is, indeed, the most reported serjeant-at-law of his day. In court he showed a boundless confidence coupled with a style aggressive and humorous, and in the year-books he comes over as well educated and of real intellectual strength. He was fluent in French and Latin, expert in rhetoric, and his inventory, which details his farming and his affluent lifestyle, also lists thirty-six books, both manuscript and print, an impressive collection covering religion, general knowledge, the classics, literature, and a little law.<br>
<br>Thomas Kebell married three times. Margery Palmer probably belonged to a Northamptonshire legal family. His second wife and the mother of his minor heir, Walter, was Agnes Flower, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Saltbie, the widowed daughter-in-law of Roger Flower, four times speaker of the House of Commons; they were married in 1483. Kebell died on 26 June 1500. Despite his planning, the crown established a claim to the wardship of the heir, but although this was then purchased by Kebell's patron, Lady Mary Hastings, and Walter later made two advantageous marriages, he died young leaving a two-year-old son in royal wardship and an estate encumbered with charges. One of these was to the serjeant's third wife, Margaret Basset (whom he had married in 1498), the heir of Ralph Basset of Blore in Staffordshire, who continued to collect a jointure of &pound;40 for thirty-four years, despite having married Sir Ralph Egerton of Ridley in Cheshire, Henry VIII's standard-bearer; she died in 1534. The death of Walter's own son was followed by a third minority and more encumbrances, and by the time his male line died out in 1571 most of the serjeant's estate had been liquidated. A memorial tomb in Humberstone church with Kebell's effigy in robes was destroyed between 1638 and 1795.<br>
