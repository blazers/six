<span class="headword">Speke <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Pye]</span>,  Mary</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1641&#150;1697), <span class="occ">nonconformist patron and political activist</span>, was the eldest daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37872/', "Sir Robert Pye (bap. 1585, d. 1662)")</script> of Faringdon, Berkshire, and his wife, Mary Croker. She may be the Mary Pye who was baptized at Richmond, Surrey, on 10 November 1625. Her father, an auditor of the exchequer, was a client of the duke of Buckingham in the 1620s. In the 1640s he was a lukewarm parliamentarian suspected of royalist sympathies, presbyterian in his religion, and a victim of Pride's Purge. Her brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22921/', "Sir Robert Pye")</script>, married Anne Hampden, daughter of John Hampden. An active soldier during the civil war, he shared his father's political and religious presbyterianism, though not his lukewarmness. After the Restoration he retired to his father's Berkshire estate, where he was reportedly in league with other &#145;fanatics' families&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July&#150;Sept 1683</i>, 338).<br>
<br>Mary Pye married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26099/', "George Speke (1623&#150;1689)")</script> of White Lackington, Ilminster, Somerset, on 21 May 1641 at St Mary Abbots, Kensington: George had been the ward of her father (who had purchased the wardship for &pound;1800). She was probably responsible for his conversion from civil war royalist to Restoration radical. Of their six children, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26100/', "Hugh Speke")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67748/', "John Speke")</script>, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67747/', "Charles Speke")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26099/', "Speke, George")</script>], and their eldest daughter, Mary Speke [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/67751">Jennings,  Mary</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/26099">Speke,  George</a>], were active whig supporters. Their youngest daughter, Philip Speke [<i>see </i><a target="_top" href="/view/article/67749">Trenchard,  Philip</a>, <i>under</i> <a target="_top" href="/view/article/26099">Speke,  George</a>], married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27705/', "John Trenchard")</script> of Bloxworth, Dorset, chairman of the notorious Green Ribbon Club, pro-exclusion MP, and Rye House conspirator.<br>
<br>Mary Speke was an ardent supporter of protestant dissenters and of whig politics in Somerset. She led conventicles at the Speke houses at White Lackington and Dillington, supported numerous presbyterian teachers, and frequented dissenting meetings throughout Somerset. She was indicted in 1663 for keeping conventicles, but fearlessly, and without protection from her husband, who was dismissed as a JP for refusing to disturb presbyterian meetings, pursued nonconformist devotion. She was widely known for her religious enthusiasm, and in 1675 the presbyterian preacher James Strong dedicated an edition of his sermons to her. She was obviously a strong-willed and influential woman, the force at the centre of her turbulent and notorious family. She strove to control her grown sons, scolding Hugh Speke so violently in 1682 that he declared he was unwell for weeks. Her movements were closely watched by Peter Mews, bishop of Bath and Wells. When Mary visited her sons in London in July 1683, the bishop warned Secretary Jenkins of her arrival, asserting that &#145;there is not a more dangerous woman in the west than she, and what her sons are I need not tell you&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>July&#150;Sept 1683</i>, 8). Later the bishop wrote:<blockquote>I need give you no character of their family. I suppose it is sufficiently known how actively of late years they have all appeared against his Majesty's interest, especially the mother and the son, Hugh. &hellip; It is a wonder that Whitelackington House is not searched by particular order, not only for arms but papers for the lady keeps great correspondence, and her son-in-law, Trenchard, is her darling. (ibid., 178)</blockquote>In August 1683 Mary was called before the privy council investigating her son Hugh's involvement in an effort to uncover the supposed murder of the earl of Essex in the Tower. The council was interested in Hugh's connection to the prominent whig lawyer Sir Robert Atkyns. Mary testified that her son had &#145;lost great sums&#146; gambling and had borrowed money from Sir Robert Atkyns  (ibid., 342).<br>
<br>The Speke family were great supporters of the duke of Monmouth and entertained him lavishly during his 1680 progress through the west. Not surprisingly, Mary Speke and George, and their sons John and Charles, were all implicated in Monmouth's rebellion in 1685, and Charles was executed. Mary was excepted from James II's general pardon of March 1686, although her husband obtained a pardon for the entire family in 1687. Her family supported the prince of Orange's invasion in 1688. George Speke appointed Mary his executor in his will of 1689. She made her own will on 22 September 1697, in which (apart from some small bequests to her servants) she left all her estate to her youngest son, William. He proved the will on 9 November 1706.<br>
