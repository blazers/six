<span class="headword">Plumptre,  Robert</span>  (1723&#150;1788), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and college head</span>, was born in Middlesex, the youngest of ten children of John Plumptre (1679&#150;1751), MP for Nottingham, and his wife, Annabella, daughter of Sir Francis Molyneux, fourth baronet, of Teversall, Nottinghamshire, and Diana Howe. He was educated at Henry Newcome's public school in Hackney. Admitted as a pensioner at Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1740, he obtained his BA in 1744, was elected a fellow of the college the following year, and was ordained in 1748.<br>
<br>The Plumptre family was patronized by Philip Yorke, first earl of Hardwicke, who presented Plumptre with the Cambridgeshire livings of Wimpole and Whaddon in 1752. These had been held since 1745 by Plumptre's elder brother Charles (1712&#150;1779). On 7 September 1756 Plumptre married Anne Newcome, the daughter of his old schoolmaster. Immediately afterwards he received from Hardwicke a prebend at Norwich (again following Charles), apparently as a wedding gift, and thereafter maintained residences in Cambridge and Norwich. In October 1760 he proceeded DD and the following month was elected president of Queens' College. He served as vice-chancellor of Cambridge University in 1760&#150;61, and again in 1777&#150;8. In 1769 he obtained the Knightbridge professorship in moral theology. His scheming to secure this appointment, which he considered &#145;small in value&#146; but with &#145;the recommendations of having nothing to do for it&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 35628, fol. 90), is well documented and reflects the family ethos that Thomas Gray slyly satirized when he translated the Plumptre motto, <i>Non magna loquimur, sed vivimus</i>, as &#145;We don't say much, but we hold good livings&#146;  (Gray, 2.646). In 1777 Charles Plumptre, now archdeacon of Ely, made Plumptre his assistant, another sinecure place. Plumptre also served as a justice of the peace for Cambridgeshire.<br>
<br>Plumptre presided over Queens' in its whig heyday, when the college was &#145;distinguished for its attachment to Civil and Religious liberty&#146;  (Gunning, 1.262). He was reform-minded, an active campaigner for such liberal causes as the abolition of religious tests in the university and the introduction of annual examinations. His only publication, apart from a few congratulatory poems in Latin, was <span class="italic">Hints Respecting some of the University Officers</span> (1782), which argued that university officers should be properly paid. The American War of Independence led Plumptre to adopt a more moderate stance in university politics. In 1775 he supported the university's controversial address to the king, condemning the Americans, and was branded &#145;a tory&#146; by David Hughes, a fellow of Queens'. In 1780, having read William Cole's characterization of him as a &#145;<i>warm Whig</i>&#146;, Plumptre noted that he was &#145;thought of late (by some of that Party still <i>warmer</i>) to incline towards Toryism, because he abhors the American Rebellion&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 5849, fol. 142). Plumptre's &#145;inclination&#146; was symptomatic of wider trends; after his death a mood of reaction set in at Queens'. He interested himself in the history of his college and left a valuable &#145;Historical account of the foundation, benefactors, presidents &amp; fellows, &amp;c.&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 5849, fols. 118&#150;48).<br>
<br>Plumptre had ten children. He was an enlightened parent who gave his several daughters &#145;an education very different from what generally falls to the lot of even well instructed females&#146;  (Watkins and Shoberl, 277); two of them, Anne and Annabella, became known for their writings [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22399/', "Plumptre, Anne")</script>]. The liberal ideals he fostered led his wife and eldest daughters to leave the Church of England. Plumptre died at Norwich on 29 October 1788 and was buried in Norwich Cathedral.<br>
