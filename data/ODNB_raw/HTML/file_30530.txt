<span class="headword">Bailhache, Sir  Clement Meacher</span>  (1856&#150;1924), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Leeds on 2 November 1856, the eldest son of the Revd Clement Bailhache, a Baptist minister and secretary to the Baptist Missionary Society, and his wife, Emma, daughter of Edward Augustus Meacher, of Ivinghoe, Buckinghamshire. The Bailhaches were Huguenots who had settled in Jersey.<br>
<br>Bailhache was educated at the City of London School and at London University, where he graduated LLB in 1877. He practised as a solicitor at Newport, Monmouthshire. In 1881 he married Fanny Elizabeth, the daughter of Herman Liebstein, a member of the Chancery bar; they had a son and two daughters.<br>
<br>Bailhache's powers as an advocate led him to enrol at the Middle Temple and he was called to the bar in 1889. He was made a bencher in 1912. He joined the south Wales circuit, where he was already well known, and was an immediate success. Within ten years he was receiving briefs in important cases in London. He was expert in commercial law, and City firms using the newly established commercial court were quick to recognize his merits.<br>
<br>In 1908 Bailhache became king's counsel, when the favourite leaders of the commercial court were T. E. Scrutton (afterwards lord justice) and J. A. Hamilton (afterwards Viscount Sumner). Their speedy elevation to the bench gave Bailhache the lion's share of commercial work. He was so busy in the commercial court that he seldom appeared in cases which attracted publicity. But there was no one better at explaining a complicated set of facts and arguing for legal principle to be applied. His arguments and addresses were notoriously short, often limited to the single, best point. &#145;Few leaders at the bar have said so little or said it so well&#146;, was the judgement in his obituary in <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<br>
<br>In 1912 congestion in the common-law courts led Lord Haldane, who had just succeeded Lord Loreburn as lord chancellor, to promote Bailhache to the bench as an additional judge. The customary knighthood followed that year. As a judge, Bailhache usually presided in the commercial court where he was at his best. Quick to a fault, he got through a great quantity of work. It was said that he did not pay enough attention to the arguments of counsel, and his summary treatment of cases led to some successful appeals. His judgments were easily delivered and well expressed, and, however difficult the case, he preferred to deliver judgment at the end of proceedings.<br>
<br>Bailhache decided many important wartime cases in the commercial court including <i>Sanday v. British and Foreign Marine Insurance Company</i> (1915, constructive total loss by declaration of war) and <i>Becker Gray &amp; Co. v. London Assurance Corporation</i> (1915, whether putting into port to avoid capture was a loss covered by insurance). Both judgments were affirmed in the Court of Appeal and in the House of Lords.<br>
<br>As a criminal judge Bailhache was less successful. He saw no reason why swift and businesslike methods should be confined to the commercial court and was known, for example, to ask counsel whether there was really any defence to the charge. His direction to the jury in <i>Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard</i> (1920), on the effect of drunkenness upon criminal responsibility, led to an appeal to the House of Lords. Bailhache had said that if the accused was so drunk that he did not know what he was doing, or did not know that what he was doing was wrong, the defence of drunkenness succeeded to the extent of reducing the crime from murder to manslaughter. Their lordships held that he was wrong to apply the test of insanity to a case of drunkenness. The conviction for murder was upheld, with an intimation, however, that the death sentence would not be carried out.<br>
<br>Bailhache did no extra-judicial public work, apart from chairing a committee in 1916 to inquire into allegations about the aircraft supplied to the Royal Flying Corps and into reports on the administration and command of the RFC. He disliked all social occasions and pomp. A lifelong Baptist and teetotaller, he was addicted to smoking a pipe to and from court and even on such formal occasions as the Mansion House dinner for the judges. Bailhache died suddenly from a cerebral haemorrhage at Beach Cottage, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, on 8 September 1924.<br>
