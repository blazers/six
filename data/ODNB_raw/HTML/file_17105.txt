<span class="headword">Lowth,  Simon</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1636, <em>d.</em> 1720), <span class="occ">nonjuring Church of England clergyman and writer</span>, was baptized at Dingley, Northamptonshire, on 30 October 1636, where his father, Simon Lowth (1600&#150;1679) was the rector. His mother was Elinor Paddon, of whom little is known. Lowth was the third son of four sons and two daughters baptized at Dingley between 1633 and 1641: the eldest, William, was the father of the theologian <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17106/', "William Lowth")</script> and grandfather of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17104/', "Robert Lowth")</script>, bishop of London. Lowth's father suffered sequestration in 1655 for reading the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>, bowing at the name of Jesus, preaching only once on Sundays, and general insufficiency, but in 1658 became rector of Tilehurst, Berkshire. Lowth senior may have been the author of <span class="italic">Catechetical questions</span> (1673), and he was buried at Tilehurst on 21 June 1679.<br>
<br>Lowth was admitted to Clare College, Cambridge, on 29 June 1653; he graduated BA in 1657 and proceeded MA in 1660. He served as vicar of St Dunstan's, Canterbury (1665&#150;89), rector of St Michael's, Harbledown, Kent (1670&#150;90), and vicar of St Cosmus, Blean, Kent (1679&#150;89). On 8 November 1679 he was licensed to marry Jane Austin (<i>b</i>. 1654/5, <i>d</i>. in or after 1720) of Canterbury.<br>
<br>Lowth appears to have found a patron in Samuel Parker, archdeacon of Canterbury, and in 1685 he published <span class="italic">Of the Subject of Church Power</span>, which upheld the role of the bishops in the governance of the church, and was an attack on the Erastian leanings of Edward Stillingfleet, John Tillotson, and Gilbert Burnet. He published several other pamphlets on this theme before the revolution of 1688, mainly contesting the claims of Burnet. He was probably the Mr Lowth who preached the sermon at the consecration of bishops Samuel Parker (his old patron), Thomas Cartwright, and William Lloyd on 17 October 1686. He seems to have been in royal favour because James II presented him to the deanery of Rochester on 6 November 1688, and Bishop Thomas Sprat instituted him on 12 November. However, Sprat then discovered that Lowth's degree of MA was insufficient for the post and he wrote to the chapter on the 14th advising them not to install Lowth. The chapter duly refused installation on 27 November. By the time Lowth proceeded BD and DD at Cambridge (delayed because there was no vice-chancellor) on 18 January 1689, and again claimed installation on 19 March 1689, William III had presented Henry Ullock in his place, and installation was again refused. This disappointment may have coloured Lowth's subsequent reaction to the new regime, because the register of St Cosmus, Blean, indicates that Lowth prayed in public for the new regime until the deanery was disposed of elsewhere.<br>
<br>Lowth's refusal to take the oaths of allegiance led to his suspension from his Kentish parishes in August 1689, and to his deprivation in February 1690. Lowth was an important contributor to the controversy following the deprivation of the nonjuring bishops in 1691; in particular in his <span class="italic">Historical Collections Concerning Church Affairs</span> (1696), he refuted the arguments of Humphrey Hody, who used medieval documents to provide precedents of the practice from the early church. Hody in response referred to Lowth as a &#145;foul mouthed collector&#146;, whose work was a &#145;long wild rage of impertinences&#146;  (Champion, 49). Other historically based tracts followed, such as <span class="italic">Ekalogai, or, Excerpts from the Ecclesiastical History</span> (1704), and <span class="italic">Historical Collections Concerning District Successions and Deprivations</span> (1713), both of which upheld the power of episcopacy against that of the state in spiritual matters.<br>
<br>Lowth was living in London in the parish of St Andrew's, Holborn, when he made his will on 27 April 1713. The amounts he bequeathed were small, and most of his estate was left to his wife. He republished his will in a memorandum of 22 June 1717. He died on 3 July 1720, and was buried in the new cemetery of the parish of St George the Martyr, Queen Square. He was survived by his wife, whose date of death is unknown, and by at least two children, Simon and Anne.<br>
