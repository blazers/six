<span class="headword">Prideaux,  Edmond</span> <span class="st"> [created Sir Edmond Prideaux, baronet, under the protectorate]</span>  (1601&#150;1659), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was born in September 1601 at Netherton, Devon, and baptized at Farway in the same county on 27 September, the second surviving son of Sir Edmund Prideaux, baronet (<i>c</i>.1555&#150;1629), lawyer, and his second wife, Katherine, daughter of Piers Edgcumbe of Mount Edgcumbe, Cornwall. He was descended from an ancient family originally of Prideaux Castle, Cornwall. He entered the Inner Temple, where his father was an eminent lawyer, in 1615 and was called to the bar on 23 November 1623, where his practice was chiefly in chancery. He lived in Devon during the 1630s serving as a sewer commissioner and a JP. His first wife was Jane (1609/10&#150;1629), daughter and heir of Henry Collins of Ottery St Mary, Devon; shortly after her death he married Margaret (<i>d</i>. 1683), daughter and coheir of William Ivery of Cothay in Somerset.<br>
<br>Prideaux was returned to the Long Parliament for Lyme Regis (which seat he held until his death), and forthwith took sides against the king. His subscription for the defence of parliament, in 1642, was &pound;100. By his own side he was regarded as one of the persons best informed as to the state of feeling in the west of England. He was <i>custos rotulorum</i> of Devon from 1646. Retained as a legal counsellor by the corporation of Exeter by 1642, he was recorder there from 1643, serving Bristol in the same capacity from 1647. On the national scene Prideaux attained prominence as a manager of first the &#145;war&#146; then the independent interests, or parties. For three years, from 10 November 1643 until it was transferred to the custody of the speakers of the two houses, he was one of the commissioners in charge of the great seal of parliament, an office worth &pound;1500 a year; as a mark of respect he was, by order of the House of Commons, called within the bar with precedence next after the solicitor-general. He had also been one of the commissioners appointed to negotiate with the king's commissioners at Uxbridge in January 1645. He fled parliament for the safety of the army in July 1647. On 12 October 1648 he was nominated by the Commons as solicitor-general, the Lords accepting his nomination on 18 October, and an ordinance passed both houses accordingly on 24 November. He avoided acting in the king's trial, but remained busy in the House of Commons throughout December 1648 and January 1649. On 9 April 1649 he was appointed attorney-general, and remained in that office for the rest of his life. He sat on the third and fifth councils of state during the Commonwealth, polling a respectable fifty-three votes in the December 1652 election.<br>
<br>From 1644 to 1653 Prideaux was intimately and profitably connected with the postal service. The question of the validity of patents for the conduct of posts was raised in both houses of parliament in connection with the sequestration, in 1640, of Thomas Witherings's office, granted in 1633. Prideaux served as chairman of the committee appointed in 1642 upon the rates of inland letters. In 1644 he was appointed, by resolution of both houses, &#145;master of the posts, messengers, and couriers&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 3, 1642&#150;4, 619), and he continued at intervals, as directed by the House of Commons or otherwise, to manage the postal service. He was ordered to arrange a post to Hull and York, and also to Lyme Regis, in 1644; in 1649 to Chester, Holyhead, and Ireland, and also to Bideford; in 1650 to Kendal, and in 1651 to Carlisle. By 1649 he is said to have established a regular weekly service throughout the kingdom. Rumour assigned to his office an income of &pound;15,000 a year&#151;at any rate it was so profitable as to excite rivalry. &#145;Encouraged by the opinion of the judges given in the House of Lords in the case of the Earl of Warwick <i>v</i>. Witherings, 9 July 1646, that the clause in Witherings's patent for restraint of carrying letters was void&#146;, Oxenbridge, Thomson, and others endeavoured to carry on a cheap and speedy post of their own, and Prideaux met them by a variety of devices, some in the way of ordinary competition, others in the shape of abuses of power and breaches of the law  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1654</i>, 22). The common council of London endeavoured in 1650 to organize the carriage of letters, but Prideaux brought the matter before parliament, which referred the question to the council of state, on 21 March 1650. On the same day the council made an order that Prideaux should take care of the business of the inland post, and be accountable for the profits quarterly; a committee was appointed to confer with him as to the management of the post. After various claims had been considered, parliament, on 21 March 1652, resolved that the office of postmaster ought to be in the sole disposal of the house, and the Irish and the Scotch committee, to which the question was referred, reported in favour of letting contracts for the carriage of letters. Prideaux contended that the office of postmaster and the carrying of letters were two distinct things, and that the resolution of parliament of 1652 referred to the former only, but eventually all previous grants were held to be set aside by that resolution, and contracts were let for the inland and foreign mails to John Manley in 1653. The loss entailed affected Prideaux little; his legal practice continued to be large and lucrative, being worth &pound;5000 a year. Among several acquisitions of real estate, he bought Forde Abbey, at Thornecombe, on the Devon/Dorset border, and built a large house there. On 31 May 1658 he was made a baronet, ostensibly in reward for voluntarily undertaking the maintenance of thirty foot soldiers in Ireland. He died, leaving a great fortune, on 19 August 1659 and was buried in the chapel of Forde Abbey. He appears to have been a sound chancery lawyer and highly esteemed by his party as a man of religion as well as learning. He was survived by his second wife and a son by that marriage who was to take part in Monmouth's rebellion.<br>
