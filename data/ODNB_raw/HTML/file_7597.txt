<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Dick,  Thomas</span>  (1774&#150;1857), <span class="occ">writer on science and philosopher</span>, was born on 24 November 1774 in the Hilltown of Dundee, the youngest of three children of Mungo Dick and Margaret Stroak. His father was a handloom weaver of moderate means who served as treasurer for the Bell Street church, meeting-house of Anti-Burgher Seceders. His mother taught him to read the <span class="roman">Bible</span> before he entered school. By his own account he was a serious minded boy, given to imaginative, and at times disturbing, musings about the heavens and God.<br>
<br>Inspired in 1783 by a spectacularly bright meteor, Dick embarked on a lifelong exploration of the heavens. He begged old spectacle lenses from neighbours, built a lens grinding machine and his own telescopes and microscopes, and resisted his parents' attempts to put him to the loom. Childhood attacks of smallpox and measles, together with his natural temperament, rendered him unfit for physical labour. In 1794 he entered the University of Edinburgh, supporting himself by private tutoring and by taking various teaching positions. He did not take the MA degree since it involved extra fees.<br>
<br>In pursuit of his vocation Dick entered the Theological Hall of the General Associate Synod of the Secession church in 1801. Licensed the same year, he officiated as a probationer before being called to the Viewfield Anti-Burgher congregation of Stirling. Here he was ordained on 30 November 1803. On 26 August 1804 he married Elisabeth Aedie, and soon thereafter became moderator of the Stirling presbytery. In December 1805, however, the presbytery found him guilty of adultery with Betty Ker, his servant. He was deposed and excommunicated. When both his wife's and his servant's babies died soon after birth, he viewed it as God's just punishment for his transgression.<br>
<br>Seeking to rehabilitate himself, Dick endeavoured to become a Christian philosopher in the tradition of Robert Boyle and others who had consecrated their pursuit of natural knowledge to the greater glory of God. He returned to teaching, becoming in 1807 a parish schoolmaster in Methven. During his ten years here, he formed a rudimentary mechanics' institute. To encourage others in this direction, he penned, in 1814&#150;15, a series of articles for the London <span class="italic">Monthly Magazine</span> which advocated the establishment of mechanics' institutes for the middle and lower classes. In 1817 he left Methven for Perth and a post as schoolmaster at Stewart's Free Trades' School. Along with teaching he made astronomical observations in the daytime, invented a new telescope which he termed an a&euml;rial reflector, and published articles in literary, religious, and scientific periodicals.<br>
<br>The success of his <span class="italic">Christian Philosopher, or, The Connection of Science and Philosophy with Religion</span> (1823) completed Dick's self-rehabilitation. Defining science as the study of God's revelation in nature, he declared that it had to remain inseparably intertwined with Christianity and that its pursuit was an expression of sincere piety and devout worship of God. Selling his copyright for &pound;120, he retired from teaching in 1827 and had a house built on Fort Hill in Broughty Ferry, which he equipped with a rooftop observatory. His next two works, <span class="italic">Philosophy of Religion</span> (1826) and <span class="italic">Philosophy of a Future State</span> (1828), focused on theology. On the basis of his first three works Union College awarded him a doctorate of laws in 1832. Later works included <span class="italic">On the Improvement of Society</span> (1833), <span class="italic">Mental Illumination and Moral Improvement of Mankind</span> (1835), <span class="italic">Celestial Scenery</span> (1837), <span class="italic">Sidereal Heavens</span> (1840), <span class="italic">Practical Astronomer</span> (1845), and three works on science and religion for the Religious Tract Society. Nearly all of these sold well, but Dick unwisely sold to his publishers, for comparatively small sums, the copyrights to all but one of his works. Three of his works were translated into Welsh, and one each into German and Chinese. They proved immensely popular in the United States, where collected editions sold in huge numbers into the 1880s.<br>
<br>Viewed collectively, Dick's works, filled with devotional utterances and scriptural citations, espoused a God-praising theology of nature. Citing Christ's two great commandments they promulgated an eirenic protestantism&#151;tinged by evangelicalism&#151;to counter sectarianism, inhibit secularization, and advance the millennium. More radically, they argued that those who properly pursued science acquired heightened conceptions of God and a deeper understanding of his word and works which made them privileged as interpreters of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> and as teachers of God's works in the hereafter. Those who possessed such expertise, Dick argued, deserved to be accorded the same respect and status as the most dignified clergymen. Fervidly espousing the plurality of worlds, Dick's works influenced David Livingstone and Edgar Allan Poe, among many others.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Dick pursued numerous philanthropic, educational, and scientific interests. He directed the Watt Institute, Dundee's Mechanics' Institute, in 1830&#150;31, and from 1835 to 1836 edited the <span class="italic">Educational Magazine and Journal of Christian Philanthropy</span>. Capping his astronomical career was his election to the Royal Astronomical Society in 1853. A Christian pacifist, he wrote forceful articles denouncing slavery and war for American newspapers.<br>
<br>Dick's first wife died some time before 1830. On 25 July 1830 he married Euphemia Young (<i>d</i>. 1840), widow of Alexander Davidson (<i>d</i>. 1826) and on 5 September 1841 he married Elizabeth Glegg (<i>d</i>. 1874). His finances were severely strained partly as a result of his charitable activities, which included supporting a family of five orphans. In 1846 he applied for a government pension but was turned down. A surgical operation on his chest in 1849 left him weakened. Fortunately, the next year a local subscription fund provided him with &pound;30 per year, and his American admirers collected a further &pound;300 for him. Supported by the Royal Literary Fund from 1850 to 1853, he secured a civil-list pension for &pound;50 per year in 1855. This was continued to his widow after his death at home on 29 July 1857. A 14 foot high obelisk in his memory was erected in 1860 at St Aidan's Church in Broughty Ferry, where he was buried.<br>
