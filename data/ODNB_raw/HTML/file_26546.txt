<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stocks,  Lumb</span>  (1812&#150;1892), <span class="occ">engraver</span>, was born on 29 November 1812, and baptized on 24 January 1813, at Lightcliffe, near Halifax, Yorkshire, the third of the five children of William Stocks (1769&#150;1836), a coalmine owner, and his second wife, Mary (Mally) Lumb (1777&#150;1864), the daughter of John Lumb. He was educated at Horton, near Bradford, where his drawing instructor was C. Cope, the father of Charles West Cope (1811&#150;1890). Determined to take up engraving, he was indentured to Charles Rolls (<i>c</i>.1800&#150;1857) on 24 October 1827 for seven years, to run from 30 November 1826, with a &#145;consideration&#146; of &pound;315, paid by his father. In 1832 he exhibited <span class="italic">Portrait of a Young Artist</span> at the Royal Academy, which was followed by the exhibition of works in miniature and crayon up to 1836. At the end of his apprenticeship in 1833 he set up on his own, engraving mainly for the annuals, commencing with <span class="italic">The Lace Maker</span> and <span class="italic">Going into Service</span>, after James Inskipp, in <span class="italic">The Amulet</span> for 1835. Two plates appeared in the <span class="italic">Literary Souvenir</span> in 1835, and <span class="italic">The Keepsake</span> contained fifteen plates between 1836 and 1843. Three engravings were done for <span class="italic">Findens Royal Gallery of British Art</span> (1838&#150;40) and were among the last of his book plates. On 10 December 1839 Stocks married Ellen Fryer (1813&#150;1898) and set up home at 12 College Terrace, Islington, London. The couple had eight sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>The Association for the Promotion of the Fine Arts in Scotland employed Stocks from 1843 to 1846 to engrave their presentation plates, and he did a plate for their <span class="italic">Six Engravings &hellip; of The Lady of the Lake</span> (1868). From 1849 to 1884 he engraved twenty-three plates for the <span class="italic">Art Journal</span>, many from the Royal and Vernon collections. A watercolour of Stocks working on <span class="italic">Autolycus</span>, after C. R. Leslie (1867), was probably painted by his son <a href="#cosubject_26545">Arthur [<i>see below</i>]</a>. For the Art Union of London he engraved <span class="italic">Raffaelle and the Fornarina</span> (1842), which was unfavourably reviewed by the critics, so the Art Union did not commission him again until 1865, when he engraved <span class="italic">Claude Duval</span>, after W. P. Frith. Following this he was commissioned to produce his most important work. In February 1866 he was given until April 1872 to engrave a plate measuring 44 inches by 12 inches of Daniel Maclise's mural <span class="italic">The Meeting of Wellington and Blucher at Waterloo</span>, painted on the wall of the Royal Gallery of the House of Lords. From about 1864 he appears to have engraved several banknote designs for Bradbury, Wilkinson &amp; Co.<br>
<br>The death of John Landseer in 1852 created a vacancy for an associate engraver of the old class in the Royal Academy, to which Stocks was elected on 10 February 1853; he was elected to the new class in 1855, and when John Henry Robinson died he was elected a fellow in December 1871. He joined the Royal Academy council in 1873, became its auditor in 1875, in the 1880s was twice on the hanging committee for engravings, and in 1892 was one of the twelve members of the Fine Arts Commission for the Chicago Exhibition. One of his last plates was <span class="italic">The Spanish Letter-Writer</span>, after J. B. Burgess, exhibited in 1888. He died at 9 Richmond Villas, Seven Sisters Road, Holloway, London (his residence since 1845), on 28 April 1892, of influenza, having been in excellent health until a few days previously, and was buried in the grave of his son Arthur in Highgate cemetery on 3 May. He was one of the most influential exponents of steel line engraving, and his death left the Royal Academy without an engraver in its ranks. Sir Frederick Leighton described him at the 1892 academy dinner as a &#145;sterling and gentle man [with] many friends&#146;  (Stocks, 1). His headstone adds: &#145;The memory of the just is blessed&#146;. A man of sturdy build, Stocks presented a venerable appearance in later life, with a full beard replacing the &#145;mutton-chop&#146; whiskers worn in his sixties. His will, dated 5 February 1892 and proved on 8 June, left a personal estate of &pound;37,833; he was one of the very few engravers to have made a modest fortune from his work. His widow, Ellen, died at her daughter's home, Culmington rectory, Shropshire, on 13 March 1898, and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_26545"></a><span class="headword">Arthur Stocks</span>  (1846&#150;1889), <span class="occ">painter</span>, the third son of Lumb and Ellen Stocks, was born on 9 April 1846 at 9 Richmond Villas, Seven Sisters Road, London, and was educated at Islington proprietary school. After an apprenticeship with his father he gave up engraving to enter the Royal Academy Schools, where he gained a silver medal for life studies in 1868. <span class="italic">Twas a Famous Victory</span> was exhibited at the Society of British Artists in 1866. Stocks exhibited fifty-nine genre paintings at the Royal Academy and fifty-six elsewhere up to 1890, including the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, of which he was a member. He died, unmarried, at 63 Hanley Road, Hornsey Rise, London, on 12 October 1889 and was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>The second son, Walter Fryer Stocks (1842&#150;1915), became a landscape painter in watercolour, and exhibited 275 pictures at the Royal Academy and elsewhere between 1862 and 1893. He married Marian Hill. Katherine Mary Stocks (1844&#150;1908) was the third child. She had thirty paintings, mainly of flowers, exhibited in London between 1877 and 1889 and married the Revd D. E. Holland. Bernard Octavius Stocks (1859&#150;1915), the eighth son, was a mezzotint engraver. He engraved his brother Arthur's <span class="italic">Sermon Time</span> (1881), and his three still-life paintings were exhibited at the Royal Academy (1881&#150;90). He died on 1 September 1915 and was buried in the family grave at Highgate cemetery. Philip Stocks (1854&#150;1916) was the seventh child. At one time vicar of Twickenham, he married Frances Knapp Fisher and emigrated to Canada, where his grandson John Philip (Jack) Stocks (1922&#150;1978) published a catalogue listing 113 of Lumb Stocks's engravings. He presented his print collection to the British Museum at his death.<br>
