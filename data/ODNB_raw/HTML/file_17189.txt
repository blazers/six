<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Lunardi,  Vincenzo</span>  (1759&#150;1806), <span class="occ">balloonist</span>, was born at Lucca, Tuscany, on 11 January 1759, and passed his early years in the East Indies before becoming, through the patronage of his guardian, Chevalier Gherardo Compagni, secretary to the Neapolitan ambassador to the Court of St James, Prince Caramanico. In July 1784 he obtained permission from Sir George Howard, governor of Chelsea Hospital, to make a balloon ascent from the hospital grounds. This permission was subsequently revoked after onlookers turned violent when the balloon of a French rival, the Chevalier de Moret, failed to inflate at the demonstration on 4 August planned to pre-empt Lunardi's. John Sheldon also attempted an ascent before Lunardi's but on 16 August his balloon managed only a modest captive ascent before it caught fire. Lunardi finally secured permission from the Honourable Artillery Company to use their ground at Moorfields and on 15 September, in the presence of spectators estimated variously to number between 30,000 and 300,000, he made a successful ascent. His balloon was about 32 feet in diameter, and was filled with hydrogen under the direction of the physician and chemist George Fordyce. The balloon, known as a Charli&egrave;re after Jacques Alexandre C&eacute;sar Charles who made the first hydrogen-filled balloon, contrasted with that of the Montgolfier brothers and most other contemporaries whose Montgolfi&egrave;re balloons rose after the common atmospheric air that they contained had been heated. The only new features of the balloon were the oars by which Lunardi hoped to steer the balloon downwards without needing to lose hydrogen, and the wings with whose flapping he hoped to move the balloon horizontally. These additions had no scientific rationale. He claimed that the use of the oars helped his descent but it seems more probable that loss of gas was responsible for this. The balloon lacked a valve at the top to control the escape of gas. It is not known how far Lunardi was responsible for the design; his partner George Biggin is spoken of warmly in Lunardi's account of the voyages, and may have been responsible for the design, being something of an inventor. Lunardi flew over London before making a brief landing at what is now known as Balloon Corner, Welham Green, where a stone marks his landing and the ejection from the balloon of a cat. He finally descended about 24 miles from his starting point in Stanton Green End, Thundridge, north of Ware, Hertfordshire, where a monument was later erected to mark the event, and shortly afterwards waited on the prince of Wales and other patrons, who had been present at the ascent, with an account of his journey. A <span class="italic">March for the Flight of an Air Balloon</span> was composed for the occasion by Samuel Wesley. Lunardi became the hero of the moment. A balloon-shaped bonnet was named after the aeronaut (see Robert Burns, &#145;To a Louse&#146;, 1789, where it is used to signify the social pretensions of a country girl), and Lunardi skirts, decorated with balloon motifs, and Lunardi garters were also fashionable. Several descriptions were printed, the best by Lunardi himself in <span class="italic">An Account of the First Aerial Voyage in England</span> (1784). Numerous prints depicting the event were published and a drawing by Paul Sandby (Patent Office) survives. A medal was struck to mark the event and Lunardi exhibited himself and his balloon to enthusiastic crowds at the Pantheon.<br>
<br>Lunardi subsequently made numerous other more or less successful ascents, including one from St George's Fields, Newington Butts, on 29 June 1785, when Mrs L. A. Sage, a London beauty, ascended and thus became &#145;the first English female aerial traveller&#146;, according to the title-page of her <span class="italic">Letter Describing &hellip; her Expedition with Lunardi's Balloon</span> (1785). (She flew without Lunardi who gallantly left the balloon when her ample bulk put a strain on its lifting power.) Moving north he made successful ascents from Liverpool, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Kelso, and York, each time to acclaim. A memorial stone marks the place at North Callange Farm, Pitscothe, where he landed after leaving Edinburgh on 5 October 1784. Lunardi took pains to describe himself as &#145;the first aerial traveller in the English atmosphere&#146; as James Tytler had already ascended in Scotland on 27 August 1784, a fact which is graciously mentioned in Lunardi's <span class="italic">Account of Five Aerial Voyages in Scotland</span> (1786). But his string of successes came to an end after a planned ascent on 23 August 1786 from Newcastle upon Tyne at which a young man, Ralph Heron, became entangled in one of the balloon's ropes, rose with it, fell, and died from his injuries, the country's first victim of air travel. The press turned against Lunardi as quickly as they had f&ecirc;ted him, thus ending his career, which depended on his being able to raise money by subscription to pay for his balloons. In 1787 he was in London experimenting with a device for saving life at sea, but he was evidently pressed for money, and had turned his hand to other ventures including hotel keeping.<br>
<br>Having left Britain in August 1787, Lunardi continued his ballooning exploits across Italy, Spain, and Portugal, his last recorded ascent being from Lisbon on 24 August 1794. He died in the convent of Barbadinas, Lisbon, on 31 July 1806 &#145;of a decline&#146;.<br>
<br>Lunardi added nothing to the technical or scientific development of ballooning (his only innovations being his wings and oars which seemed to be of little use, and a &#145;double balloon&#146; which he advertised that he would use but never did), but he was a likeable and courageous opportunist who brought the spectacle of ballooning to a wide British public and deserved his description in his death notice in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>: &#145;Mr Vincent Lunardi, the celebrated aeronaut&#146;.<br>
