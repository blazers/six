<span class="headword">Jones,  Lewis Richard</span>  (1897&#150;1939), <span class="occ">political activist and novelist</span>, was born on 28 December 1897 at 4 Sunny Bank, Blaenclydach, a mining village in a side valley of the Rhondda, Glamorgan, the illegitimate child of Jane Jones (<i>d</i>. 1940/41), a domestic servant, and was brought up by his grandmother. He lived all his life in Blaenclydach, which is the setting of both his novels, <span class="italic">Cwmardy</span> (1937) and <span class="italic">We Live</span> (1939). His attendance at the local primary school was punctuated by frequent absences during which he lived a street life in an attempt to supplement his family's meagre income. At the age of twelve he went to work underground at the Cambrian colliery and, seven years later, on 9 April 1917, married Elizabeth Mary Jones (<i>b</i>. 1898/9), the daughter of Daniel Jones, a timberman; they had two daughters, Megan and Avril. Within a year of his starting work the Cambrian Combine owned by Lord Rhondda, whom Jones pilloried in his novels as Lord Cwmardy, embroiled all the pits of mid-Rhondda in a strike which ended in defeat for the miners, and in 1910 he witnessed the Tonypandy riots, a civil disturbance by locked-out miners which is among the most famous events in the history of the south Wales coalfield.<br>
<br>Elected chairman of the Cambrian lodge, a hotbed of the &#145;advanced&#146;, mainly syndicalist thinking of the South Wales Miners' Federation, in 1918, Jones began a career as a public speaker of legendary power. During his first year at the Marxist-orientated Central Labour College (1923&#150;5) he joined the Communist Party and, on his return to the Rhondda, became one of its most eloquent and able representatives as well as an organizer of immense talent. By the general strike, which began in May 1926, his ambition to be a mining engineer had dwindled as he became more interested in political philosophy. On the miners' ignominious return to work in the following November, after they had held out for nearly seven months against Stanley Baldwin's government, Jones&#151;like many militants&#151;was removed from his job as check-weighman for refusing to work with blackleg labour. He then became an organizer for the National Unemployed Workers' Movement in an area where unemployment was endemic, widespread, and long-term. In this capacity he led contingents of hunger marchers from the Rhondda to Cardiff and from south Wales to London in 1932, 1934, and 1936. He also arranged demonstrations against the hated means test which culminated in the mass movement of 1935. In that year he attended, as a British delegate, the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International in Moscow but, always a maverick, sometimes in bad odour with his party, and appalled by the cult of leader, refused to stand or clap for the person or name of Stalin.<br>
<br>In 1931 Lewis Jones had been elected a member of the Welsh committee of the Communist Party and, for the last three years of his life, was one of two communist members of Glamorgan county council. A fiery orator, who served a three-month prison sentence in 1926 for his allegedly seditious speeches and was fined for &#145;inciting disorder&#146; during the 1930s, he commanded a strong personal following among miners and other workers in the heavy industries of south Wales. Ardent in his support for a popular front between communists and the Labour Party against the threat of fascism at home and abroad, he also played a prominent part in the campaign in Wales on behalf of the beleaguered Spanish republic. He died of a heart attack at 12 Clare Road, Cardiff, on 27 January 1939 after addressing some thirty street meetings in the week that Barcelona fell to the fascist forces of General Franco. His secular funeral procession, the coffin draped with a scarlet banner, seemed to some observers as it wound its way through the packed streets of Tonypandy to the Judges' Hall in Trealaw to symbolize the thwarted hopes of &#145;Red Rhondda&#146; and the passing of one of its most militant sons. He was buried in Trealaw cemetery, Rhondda, Glamorgan.<br>
<br>Like other left-wingers in south Wales during the inter-war years, Lewis Jones was influenced by the syndicalism of the pamphlet <span class="italic">The Miners' Next Step</span> (1912), but the essential fact of his volatile but attractive personality, whether expressed in his stormy political career or in his writing, was the Marxism which he had embraced so wholeheartedly in his youth and to which his life was dedicated. He was remarkable not least because, during a brief, difficult, and busy life, he wrote&#151;besides articles and stories contributed to the <span class="italic">Daily Worker</span>&#151;two novels about the mining communities of south Wales which, though unsatisfactory in strictly literary terms, gave an authentic account of the social deprivation and political militancy which were typical of his time and place.<br>
<br>In a preface to <span class="italic">Cwmardy</span> (1937) the author attributed the inspiration for the book to the miners' leader Arthur Horner, who &#145;suggested that the full meaning of life in the Welsh mining areas could be expressed for the general reader more truthfully and vividly if treated imaginatively, than by any amount of statistical and historical research&#146;; there he also admitted that the novel had been written hastily &#145;during odd moments stolen from mass meetings, committees, demonstrations, marches and other activities&#146;. The novel's focus is divided between scenes of vivid documentary in its description of strikes, pit explosions, and the workers' clashes with troops and policemen, on the one hand, and a sensitive exploration of the psychology of the principal character, Len Roberts, and his sweetheart, Mary, and their denial of sex, on the other. Len, the archetypal wounded hero, grows increasingly sceptical about the efficacy of political action and is drawn to introspection and a quest for aesthetic beauty. His political involvement is part of the price he has to pay for not pursuing the life of the imagination, a compromise reflecting one of the main tensions in the author's own life. This theme is further developed in the sequel <span class="italic">We Live</span> (1939), which was finished after the author's death by Mavis Llewellyn, a communist with whom he shared his last years, and published posthumously. It brings an added subtlety to both books, which otherwise might be read as merely propagandist novels bristling with outrage against working-class conditions and advocating radical, even revolutionary, means of exposing and improving them.<br>
