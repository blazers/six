</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Acland, Sir  Arthur Herbert Dyke</span>, thirteenth baronet  (1847&#150;1926), <span class="occ">politician and educational reformer</span>, was born at Holnicote, near Porlock, Somerset, on 13 October 1847, the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/67/', "Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, eleventh baronet (1809&#150;1898)")</script>, and his first wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1851), daughter of Sir Charles Mordaunt, eighth baronet, of Massingham, Norfolk. The Aclands, leading landowners in the west of England, were well established, both at the University of Oxford and in wider political circles. Sir Thomas Acland was an educational reformer and Arthur recalled growing up among his father's reports for the Taunton commission. He entered Rugby School in 1861 and matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1866. He obtained a second class in classical moderations (1868) and also in the final school of law and modern history (1870), graduating BA in 1870 and MA in 1873.<br>
<br>In 1871 Acland was appointed lecturer, and in 1872 tutor, at Keble College, then newly founded. As the third son, however, Acland was educated to enter the church, being known from birth in the family as &#145;the little clergyman&#146;. In 1872 he was ordained deacon and after his marriage on 14 June 1873 to Alice Sophia (1849&#150;1935), daughter of Francis Macaulay Cunningham, the vicar of Witney [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56454/', "Acland, Alice Sophia")</script>], the young couple were expected to take up the family living at Luccombe, Somerset. Beset by doubts as to the validity of Anglican dogma, Acland suffered a nervous collapse. He later told R. B. Haldane in a letter in 1898: &#145;I knocked up my brain early in life and have overstrained it ever since&#146;  (Matthew, 9). His curacy under Mandell Creighton in Embleton, Northumberland, did nothing to reassure him. A tour of the industrial north in 1875 and, in particular, to the working men's club in Rochdale, however, suddenly provided invigoration and a growing political awareness. It also confirmed his decision to resign holy orders, and he took advantage of the <span class="roman">Clerical Disabilities Act</span> in 1879.<br>
<br>Acland's time as principal of the new Oxford Military College from 1875 to 1877 proved unhappy. In 1879 he was appointed steward of Christ Church and was a senior student there in 1884&#150;5. He was the first treasurer of Somerville College. In 1884 he was appointed senior bursar of Balliol College and was made an honorary fellow in 1888. While at Oxford he gathered around him a group of young fellows and undergraduates, including Hubert Llewellyn Smith, J. A. Spender, L. T. Hobhouse, and Michael Sadler, known as the Inner Ring, who met at his home to discuss political and social questions. Acland remained a mentor for many of them. He urged Spender to investigate old age pensions and sickness insurance and wrote the introduction to the findings in <span class="italic">The State and Pensions in Old Age</span> (1892).<h2>
<a name="ExtramuralteachingandLiberalpolitics"></a>Extramural teaching and Liberal politics</h2>In 1878 Acland was appointed secretary responsible for &#145;the provision of Lectures and Teaching in the large towns of England and Wales&#146;, a new initiative of the University of Oxford delegacy of local examinations (which had been founded by his father in 1857). The chairman was his close friend T. H. Green, the Balliol idealist philosopher, and it was his teaching which Acland now began to translate into a programme of &#145;education for citizenship&#146;. Significantly, it was the industrial north of England, with its growing political strength, to which Acland directed his efforts. His great success as a lecturer, often to audiences of more than seven hundred, and the rapport he established with working men, and especially co-operators, laid the foundation for the unique contribution of Oxford University extension. In 1882 he brought the Co-operative Congress to Oxford and in meetings in the Sheldonian Theatre and Balliol College leading co-operators and sympathetic university dons forged relationships which were to result eventually in the creation of the Workers' Educational Association and the joint tutorial classes. Acland not only lectured but provided syllabuses and texts for classes. In 1882, with Professor Cyril Ransome, he produced <span class="italic">A Handbook of the Political History of England</span>, which had considerable popularity as a book of reference and reached a new edition in 1913. In 1883 he published <span class="italic">The Education of Citizens</span> and in 1884, with Benjamin Jones, <span class="italic">Working Men Co-Operators</span>, an account of the artisans' co-operative movement in Great Britain. University extension did much to emphasize the gaps in educational provision, particularly between elementary and higher education, and it was to a campaign for the provision of greater educational opportunity, which he felt would underpin a democratic society, that Acland was to devote the rest of his life.<br>
<br>In December 1885 Acland was elected as Liberal MP for the newly formed Rotherham division of the West Riding of Yorkshire with a majority which was one of the largest in the country. In a series of painstakingly researched speeches on education, land reform, and local government reform he established a reputation in parliament as a leading exponent of a new positioning of Liberalism, based on links with the working classes. His earnestly democratic stance and his zeal for social justice won him a following among a group of young Liberal MPs including Haldane, Grey (well known to Acland since Embleton days), Asquith, Atherley-Jones, and particularly Tom Ellis, the Welsh member for Merioneth.<h2>
<a name="Welsheducationandtechnicalinstruction"></a>Welsh education and technical instruction</h2>Since 1881 Acland had kept a home at Clynnog Fawr, Caernarvonshire. Buoyed by the deep friendship he had formed with Ellis, Acland began discreetly to orchestrate the campaign for Welsh education. He injected his advanced democratic ideals into the proposals for the reorganization of secondary schooling, ensuring better access for both girls and boys, as well as providing guidelines for an enhanced common curriculum. He pointed out what might be achieved through the use of county councils as educational authorities. He guided the passage of the <span class="roman">Welsh Intermediate Education Bill</span>. He chaired a series of meetings of the joint committees of the Welsh counties at Shrewsbury in 1890, and, with great political skill, achieved unanimity of purpose throughout Wales. As alderman of Caernarfon, he submitted the first scheme for approval under the <span class="roman">Welsh Intermediate Act</span> of 1889, providing a model for the other Welsh county councils and anticipating the reform of English secondary education. In government Acland helped to crown the new system by assisting with the creation of a linked University of Wales.<br>
<br>In 1887, with Henry Roscoe, Acland founded the National Association for Technical Education to persuade the government to organize and supervise secondary and technical education. He furthered the passing of the <span class="roman">Technical Instruction Acts</span> of 1889 and 1891 and, by diverting revenue from liquor duties (&#145;whisky money&#146;) to county councils for the benefit of education, allowed what was virtually a secondary education system to grow up. With the assistance of H. Llewellyn Smith, he edited a comprehensive review, with guidelines for reconstruction, of secondary education, published as <span class="italic">Studies in Secondary Education</span> (1892).<h2>
<a name="Ingovernment18921895"></a>In government, 1892&#150;1895</h2>In August 1892 Acland was appointed vice-president of the committee of council on education in Gladstone's fourth ministry, Gladstone overruling Harcourt's attempt to make him chief whip. Morley recalled that to admit &#145;the son of the oldest of all the surviving friends of his youth&#146;  (J. Morley, <span class="italic">Life of Gladstone</span>, 3.494&#150;5) gave personal gratification to Gladstone. Morley dubbed Acland and his earnest friends, Asquith, Haldane, and Grey, the &#145;Brethren&#146;. With his uncompromising and ardent nature, Acland could be a demanding colleague but Haldane wrote admiringly, &#145;I would rather be like Arthur Acland, with all his fanaticisms, than anyone I know just now&#146;  (D. Sommer, <span class="italic">Haldane of Cloan: his Life and Times, 1856&#150;1928</span>, 1960, 90) and Morley recorded that he was one of the &#145;inner ring&#146; in the cabinet.<br>
<br>By taking advantage of his considerable administrative freedom Acland made substantial gains. He exploited the 1891 act rapidly to extend the number of children with free places and he publicized the right to free education by urging parents to make &#145;representations&#146; about &#145;deficiencies&#146;. In his codes of 1893 and 1895, he ended payment by results and liberalized the curriculum in elementary schools. In 1893 the age for compulsory attendance at school was raised from ten to eleven. Acland's syllabus for the evening school code, &#145;The life and duties of a citizen&#146;, reiterated his belief in the democratic power of adult education, and evening school education spread at an unprecedented rate once work of the highest possible level could be attempted and age restrictions were removed. Fresh appointments invigorated the inspectorate but when grants were refused to schools deemed inefficient, Acland was accused of being the enemy of voluntary schools. In particular his circular on the sanitary and hygienic requirements of the department, including the provision of playgrounds, was felt by hard-up church schools to impose onerous obligations on them. For some churchmen he was &#145;a bitter little Radical&#146; and taunts of apostasy wounded him  (Acland, journal, 3 Sept 1893).<br>
<br>At Acland's prompting request, a national conference on secondary education held in Oxford in 1893 resulted in a memorial to the prime minister from the convocation of the university calling for a royal commission. The resulting commission of 1894, chaired by James Bryce, had among its members many close to Acland&#151;H. Llewellyn Smith, Harry Reichel, Roscoe, T. H. Warren, and Sadler&#151;and the recommendations laid the foundation of Balfour's 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. In 1895 Acland appointed Michael Sadler to be director of the newly created department of special inquiries with the hope that such information would help to maintain the momentum of reform when he left office. He instituted a new departmental committee with the Charity Commissioners and the Department of Science and Art, foreshadowing a single central authority for education. Asquith described him as &#145;the success of the Government&#146; but by the time of the Liberals' fall from power in 1895 he was feeling &#145;squeezed out&#146;. He was a formidable opponent of Conservative educational measures but in 1899 he resigned his seat, fearing a breakdown in health. His father's death in 1898 had resulted in a period of personal crisis. As the unrecognized heir to his childless elder brother, he sublimated his unhappiness by writing a loving memoir of his father, <span class="italic">Sir Thomas Acland: Memoir and Letters</span> (1902).<h2>
<a name="Educationaladministrationandpolicy"></a>Educational administration and policy</h2>In 1900 Acland was called on to lead the Liberal attack on the proposed new <span class="roman">Education Act</span>. Once passed, however, he decided to &#145;work it to the best of our ability&#146;  (Acland, journal, 4 Feb 1903). For seven years he guided his local West Riding of Yorkshire county council in implementing a system of secondary education, taking a particular interest in Pickering grammar school where he was chairman of governors. He also assisted the Yorkshire College at Leeds to receive its charter as a university in 1904. As chairman of Bedford College (1903&#150;15) and Imperial College (1907&#150;25) he ensured an important period of growth.<br>
<br>Acland's influence remained strong at national level. From 1906 he chaired the consultative committee of the Board of Education and, with the help of members who had long been close to him, such as Reichel, T. H. Warren, Mansbridge, and Sadler, produced a series of wide-ranging and far-sighted reports which kept up the pressure for further reform. Successive education ministers, Birrell, Haldane, and Trevelyan, turned to him for coaching and direction. He continued to champion the case for greater democratic representation in the management of schools, the provision of better teacher training, pay, and pensions. In his lengthy evidence to the royal commission on the civil service in 1912 he took the opportunity to air his dissatisfaction. The changes he advocated anticipated those of many later educational reformers: a wider curriculum, a revised examination system, supplemented by both teacher assessment and school inspection.<h2>
<a name="LiberalismandLabour"></a>Liberalism and Labour</h2>Acland continued to exert influence on the political fortunes of the Liberal Party, persuading Grey and Haldane to join the cabinet in December 1905. He became president of the National Liberal Federation in 1906 but he resigned in 1907, feeling out of sympathy with &#145;official Liberalism&#146;. When Asquith offered him a peerage in 1908 he refused it as &#145;inconsistent with all we care most about in life on the democratic side&#146;  (Acland, journal, 9 Aug 1908).<br>
<br>In 1912 Acland chaired an inquiry, linked to Lloyd George's campaign for land reform, into &#145;the facts of Land in town and country and Rural conditions generally&#146;. The report, published in 1913, with an introduction by Acland, was very favourably received in progressive circles, despite recommendations for a ministry of land, a legal minimum wage for farm workers, and compulsory power to acquire land for allotments. Acland began to raise money and work on a number of the Webbs' research projects, such as mother and infant welfare, and conditions for women in industrial work, and he chaired a committee set up to investigate the feasibility of forming an institute in London to further such research. For Beatrice Webb, he was the most enlightened and far-seeing of all the liberal politicians of the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth  (Webb, 77n). He maintained his friendship with Lloyd George but judged that his influence had been &#145;overall degrading to public life&#146;  (Acland, journal, 23 April 1920). In the 1922 general election he helped to finance young Labour candidates, among them Hugh Dalton, and rejoiced when Labour almost doubled its membership. He gave &pound;600 a year for three years to the rental of the Parliamentary Labour Club, close to the House of Commons, for members and their wives.<br>
<br>On 18 February 1919 Acland succeeded his brother Sir Charles Thomas Dyke Acland, as thirteenth baronet. &#145;We shrug our shoulders and make the best of the &#147;Sir Arthur&#148; and &#147;Your ladyship&#148;&#146;, he commented  (Acland, journal, March 1919). He received the honorary degree of LLD from the universities of Leeds (1904) and Bristol (1912). He died at his London home, 85 Onslow Square, on 9 October 1926 and was cremated at Golders Green. His ashes were interred at Columb John Chapel in the Killerton estate, Devon. He was succeeded as fourteenth baronet by his elder son, Francis Dyke Acland (1874&#150;1939), also a Liberal MP. He left &pound;10,000 to found four scholarships, two for the Labour Party and two for the central co-operative board, to allow young men and women to travel abroad and do research of value to either organization. The trust, the Acland Memorial Fund, still continues.<br>
