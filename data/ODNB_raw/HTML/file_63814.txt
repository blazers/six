<span class="headword">King,  Bolton</span>  (1860&#150;1937), <span class="occ">educational administrator and historian</span>, was born at Chadshunt, Gaydon, near Kineton in Warwickshire, on 8 May 1860, the only son of the second marriage of his father, Edward Bolton King (1801&#150;1878), to Louisa Palmer (1825&#150;1920), descendant of the fourth earl of Aylesford. His father, a landowner, had been Liberal MP for Warwick (1832&#150;7) and for South Warwickshire (1857&#150;9).<br>
<br>King was educated at Eton College from 1872 to 1879, in which year he went up to Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained first-class honours in modern history in 1883. The master of Balliol, Benjamin Jowett, of whom he was a prot&eacute;g&eacute;, noted his seriousness of character and enthusiasm for progressive causes. King abandoned his intention to enter the church through scruples about subscribing to the articles of faith  (Jowett, 283), but found an alternative vocation through the influence of Arnold Toynbee and his ideals of social reform. He was closely involved in the foundation of Toynbee Hall Settlement in the East End of London, where he lived and taught until 1892. He was a friend of A. H. D. Acland and belonged to Acland's &#145;inner ring&#146;. He founded the Toynbee Travellers' Club, which organized educational tours to the continent. Dame Henrietta Barnett referred to his gracious personality, princely generosity, and dreadful clothes  (Barnett, 26). He married on 8 May 1895 Lydia (<i>c</i>.1869&#150;1965), daughter of George Arnold of Gaydon; they had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>King left Toynbee Hall to complete <span class="italic">A History of Italian Unity</span> (1899) and <span class="italic">Mazzini</span> (1902). These studies were influential; the first was for long standard and the second is still quoted. <span class="italic">Italy Today</span> (1901), an account of contemporary Italian history, written in collaboration with Thomas Okey, the master basket maker and self-taught Italian scholar whom he met at Toynbee Hall, is more dated.<br>
<br>Though his stepbrother inherited Chadshunt, King did not lose touch with Warwickshire's labouring community. He set up two experiments in co-operative farming at Radbourne Manor and Ufton Hill. These were well thought out, but ultimately unsuccessful. In Gaydon he built a hall and reading room and houses with allotments for agricultural labourers. He occupied one himself with his wife, Lydia, but later moved to Warwick. With Joseph Ashby of Tysoe, who did most of the fieldwork, he published &#145;Statistics of some midland villages&#146; in the <span class="italic">Economic Journal</span> (March and June 1893), setting out the problems that the agricultural working class faced.<br>
<br>King's radical views prevented his election to the newly created Warwickshire county council in 1892, when he stood at Kineton against Lord Willoughby de Broke, but he was chosen as a county alderman. He opposed the South African War and stood unsuccessfully for parliament as Liberal candidate for the Stratford upon Avon division of Warwickshire at a by-election in June 1901. Experience as chairman of the Warwickshire technical education committee between 1893 and 1903 led to his appointment in 1904 as Warwickshire's director of education under the 1902 <span class="roman">Education Act</span>.<br>
<br>Armed with resources, and supported by the chairman of the county council's education committee, James Broughton Dugdale, King was able to set up a workable administrative structure, build new elementary schools in the populous areas, create new secondary places as at Nuneaton Girls' High School, and provide the educational ladder of minor and major scholarships. Two central intermediate schools in rural areas allowed abler children to stay on if they wished and share the opportunities provided for rural pupil teachers. He strongly supported the 1918 act, which raised the school leaving age to fourteen, and drew up the county's plans to implement the act; these are to be found in his third printed report, <span class="italic">Education in Warwickshire</span> (1919). This envisaged the setting up of non-selective secondary schools, ten of which were to be created each year until the planned target of sixty schools to cover the whole county was reached. But this ambitious scheme was thwarted for lack of funds. Warwickshire was the only county to set up a successful day continuation school, offering day release up to the age of sixteen, which was enthusiastically adopted by employers in the skilled industries of Rugby. But King was disappointed that day continuation schools were not established elsewhere. His faith in the teaching profession led him to set up a teachers' consultative committee to advise on books and scholarship examinations. He encouraged secondary teachers to write on their teaching subjects and elementary school teachers to expect responsibility from quite young children.<br>
<br>Clashes with his former opponents recurred when, on the outbreak of war in 1914, the education committee circulated a leaflet prepared by King, <span class="italic">Why We Are at War</span>, containing the passage &#145;this then is a righteous war. Many of the wars we have fought have not been righteous. We have sometimes done unjust and cruel things&#146;. Asked by the committee to withdraw the latter words, King refused &#145;as a historian&#146;, but offered to resign. His chairman, who had given permission for the publication, took the blame for the issue and the matter was dropped. A later leaflet, <span class="italic">The Schools and the War</span> (1916), detailing the schools' war effort, was well reviewed in <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>  (22 April 1916) and met with general approval.<br>
<br>When he retired in 1928 King made a moving tribute to the teachers:<blockquote>It is upon you that it depends whether Education shall be lifeless or life-giving, whether the children shall go into life just with more or less undigested knowledge, or with character and mind so formed that they grow to be thinking men and women and giving citizens. (King, Browne, and Ibbotson, 28)</blockquote>In retirement he wrote <span class="italic">Schools of Today</span> (1929), describing recent changes in education, and supporting the recommendations of the Hadow report, notably that for raising the school leaving age to fifteen. His suspicions of Mussolini's regime were confirmed by Professor Gaetano Salvemini, who had fled from Florence after imprisonment and with whom he spoke on Mazzini at the King's High School, Warwick. A miniature edition of King's study <span class="italic">Fascism in Italy</span> (1931), translated into Italian, was dropped on Rome by a young airman, Lauro di Bosis. King died on 15 May 1937 at Redholme, Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, where he lived in his advanced years, and his ashes were interred in the family vault at Chadshunt. The blessing at the interment was pronounced by Bishop Barnes of Birmingham, like King a Christian of advanced opinions.<br>
