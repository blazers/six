<span class="headword">Macdonald,  Duncan George Forbes</span>  (1827/8&#150;1884), <span class="occ">agricultural engineer and writer</span>, was the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17441/', "John Macdonald (1779&#150;1849)")</script> and his second wife, Janet, eldest daughter of Kenneth Mackenzie, of Millbank. Initially he devoted himself to the study and practice of agriculture on his father's extensive glebe, before starting business on his own account in 1848, as an agricultural engineer in London and Dingwall, Ross-shire. He also worked as a civil engineer, in addition to acquiring practical knowledge of farming.<br>
<br>Macdonald was a prolific writer, producing publications on a multitude of different aspects relating to British agriculture and on his visits to the colonies. His first work, <span class="italic">What the Farmers may Do with the Land</span>, appeared in 1852; the subtitle, <span class="italic">Practical Hints for their and its Improvement</span>, effectively summarized the content of the text. Later Macdonald went to British Columbia, where he became a member of the government's survey staff and one of the commissioners responsible for adjusting the boundary line of British North America. This led, following his return to Britain, to the publication of <span class="italic">British Columbia and Vancouver Island</span>. The text provided a detailed analysis of the physical characteristics and climate of the area, in addition to assessing the manners and customs of the native people. Rather controversially, in this work he opposed immigration to the area on the grounds that the land was not as rich and fertile as his contemporaries believed. His views were also reiterated in subsequent lectures on the topic.<br>
<br>After the deposition of Napoleon III Macdonald wrote a pamphlet entitled <span class="italic">Napoleon III, the Empress Eug&eacute;nie, and the Prince Imperial</span>. The rest of his life was devoted to agricultural and similar interests. He became drainage engineer of improvements under the control of the enclosure commissioners for England and Wales, and engineer-in-chief to the inspector-general of highland destitution. Macdonald was a fellow of the Geological Society and of the Royal Geographical Society; he also became a justice of the peace, and was made LLD. He died on 6 January 1884 at 23 West Hill Road, Brighton.<br>
