<span class="headword">Baillie,  Robert</span>  (1602&#150;1662), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and author</span>, son of James Baillie (<i>d</i>. before 1631), merchant burgess of Glasgow, and Helen Gibson (<i>d</i>. 1634), was born in Saltmarket Street, Glasgow, on 30 April 1602. He attended Glasgow grammar school and between 1617 and 1620 the University of Glasgow, graduating MA. At both school and university he was taught by Robert Blair, whom he later acknowledged as having been, after his parents, &#145;the first and principall instrument&#146; of whatever piety, good letters, and moral virtue that he had. &#145;I have alwayes found my selfe more in your debt, than in any other man's on earth&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 1.xxiii).<br>
<br>Baillie's ambition was to spend his life as parish minister in a &#145;landwarrt kirk&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 1.xxiv), or country church, and from 1625 to 1631 he taught at Glasgow University as a regent while studying divinity in preparation for entering the ministry. In 1631 he was appointed minister of Kilwinning in Ayrshire by the earl of Eglinton, the father of one of his pupils, and now that he had a living he married, on 12 July 1632, in Glasgow, Lilias Fleming (<i>d</i>. 1653). Baillie had earned a reputation for outstanding academic ability, but he resisted a suggestion that he move to a more prestigious parish in Edinburgh in 1633 on the grounds that it would break his, and many of his parishioners' hearts if he left Kilwinning.<br>
<br>An additional motive for Baillie's remaining in rural obscurity was that, though he was willing to conform quietly to the innovations that Charles I was introducing to the Scottish church, he was at heart opposed to them. Moving to a high profile appointment in the capital would have brought him under pressure to declare open support for royal policy. As late as January 1637 he was ready to submit to the new prayer book which was being introduced, though he predicted that it would lead to &#145;the most pitiful schism that ever poor Kirk has felt&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 1.5). After disturbances provoked by the book broke out in July 1637 Baillie was instructed by the archbishop of Glasgow to preach in favour of it and the book of canons before the synod of Glasgow, but he begged to be excused, declaring that &#145;my mynde is no wayes satisfied&#146;, and that the books had caused him such &#145;grief, that I am scarce able to preach to my own flock&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 1.12). But, typically, when the order was renewed, Baillie was ready to obey, rather than &#145;cast my self in needless contests with a troublesome man&#146;  (ibid., 1.20), though a change of mind by the archbishop spared him from the ordeal.<br>
<br>In spite of his forebodings Baillie soon became involved in active opposition to the king's innovations, though he wrote in October &#145;I think our people possessed with a bloody devill, farr above anything that ever I could have imagined&#146;, so that he feared &#145;a bloudie Civill warr&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 1.23&#150;5). When, in February 1638, the draft for the national covenant was produced, Baillie urged moderating the text at several points, and succeeded in getting an undertaking to abolish episcopacy removed. &#145;Bishopes I love&#146;, he had written before the troubles had begun, &#145;but pride, greid, luxurie, oppression, immersion in saicular affaires&#146; would destroy them unless they were reformed  (ibid., 1.2). In the Glasgow assembly at the end of 1638 Baillie again stood up for moderation, for though now willing to accept the abolition of episcopacy he argued that it should not be declared unlawful, and he opposed persecution of opponents.<br>
<br>Baillie was reluctant to accept the legitimacy of armed resistance to the king, but again was soon won over. He served as chaplain to Eglinton's regiment in the bishops' wars of 1639 and 1640, and he became an outstanding propagandist for the covenanting cause. <span class="italic">Laudensium <i>autokatakrisis</i>, the Canterburians self-conviction</span> was published in Edinburgh in 1640, and London and Amsterdam editions quickly followed. Moreover Baillie had for some years been writing about events in Scotland to his cousin, William Spang, minister to the Scottish congregation at Campvere in the Netherlands, and he now expanded these letters (which form the greater part of the published <span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>) into detailed, though hasty and informal, narratives and analyses designed to provide Spang with material for justifying the covenanters abroad. From this material Spang published Latin apologias for the covenanters in 1640 and 1641.<br>
<br>Thus Baillie, in spite of his reservations and anxieties, became a well-known public figure, and in October he was summoned to the camp of the Scottish army occupying northern England. There, on 2 November 1640, he and three other ministers were ordered to go to London to support the Scots commissioners negotiating with the king  (NL Scot., Adv. MS 33.4.6, 109&#150;10). While in London he published a further three propaganda tracts, and he was given a leading part in working to secure the downfall of Archbishop Laud and the earl of Strafford, held to be the main authors of the religious and other grievances of both the Scots and the English puritans.<br>
<br>Pressures on Baillie to leave Kilwinning had by now been renewed. He refused an attempt to move him to the ministry in Glasgow in 1639, after pleading that he was already &#145;in a place eminent enough for any gifts I have&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 1.229), but in June 1642 he accepted an invitation to become joint professor of divinity (with David Dickson) in Glasgow. Late in 1642 the commission of the general assembly of the church resolved, in response to approaches from the English parliament in favour of religious union between the two countries, to send commissioners to England to help bring about reform there. Baillie was one of the delegates chosen, though it was not until 18 November 1643 that he and his colleagues reached London. They were admitted to the Westminster assembly of divines as observers, and in January 1645 Baillie returned to Scotland and reported optimistically to the general assembly on the progress being made. In spite of his protests that he wanted to return home, he was sent back to London in March, though he was delayed after his ship was blown off course to the Netherlands, and he recorded with pleasure visiting Spang and roaming the bookshops of Rotterdam. On 21 January 1647 Baillie again reported on the Westminster assembly to the commission of the general assembly in Edinburgh, presenting it with the confession of faith that had been approved.<br>
<br>Though Baillie, like the other Scots commissioners, had not been able to take a direct part in the debates of the Westminster assembly, he had been influential in discussions behind the scenes in the cause of uniformity, as well as preaching to the houses of Lords and Commons and supporting presbyterianism through further published tracts, including <span class="italic">An Historical Vindication of the Government of the Church of Scotland</span> (1646). However, initial triumph quickly turned sour. The English parliament, no longer in need of Scottish military help in its war against the king, showed little interest in enforcing uniformity, and in 1644 and 1645 royalists led by the marquess of Montrose won repeated victories over the covenanters' armies. In his letters Baillie expressed his bewilderment as to why God was allowing his people to be scattered&#151;especially by a force that included so many Roman Catholics.<br>
<br>An outbreak of bubonic plague prevented Baillie from returning to Glasgow after reporting to the commission of the general assembly in 1647, but some of the classes of Glasgow University assembled at Kilwinning and he joined them and his family there. As plague approached the parish he retreated to Edinburgh, now plague free. Again he was perplexed, but concluded that plague was a gift&#151;though a mysterious one&#151;from God. Political events were also demoralizing. In 1648 most covenanters allied with moderate royalists in the engagement to help Charles I against the English parliament. The church opposed the scheme, and Baillie expressed na&iuml;ve horror on finding that the state could defy the church, raise an army, and do what it liked.<br>
<br>The defeat of the engagers by Cromwell in England brought the kirk party regime, supported by the church, to power, and in March 1649 Baillie was one of a delegation it sent to The Hague to invite the young Charles II to Scotland. But Charles refused the terms offered, and Baillie soon became disillusioned with the kirk party because of its severe persecution of engagers and those who had not been active in opposing them. He bravely refused to vote to depose guilty ministers, and was especially active in support of his friend John Strang, the principal of Glasgow University. But finding that he was himself in danger of being classified as a malignant, Baillie soon retired to his university duties, as advised in July 1650 by his mentor Robert Blair: &#145;Get yow to your book and your work, and meddle not&#146;, for he was destroying his good name  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 3.105).<br>
<br>When, in 1650&#150;51, the church in Scotland tore itself apart over how to react to English invasion and the revival of royalist sentiment that it provoked, Baillie supported the majority resolutioners' party rather than the extremist remonstrants, though he was reluctant to involve himself in the bitter controversy: &#145;I loved not to appear in contradiction to some violent men&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 3.115). The remonstrants might be a minority party nationally, but in Glasgow they had a majority among ministers, and Baillie feared deposition from his professorship&#151;his friend Strang was forced to resign as principal of the university in 1650. The remonstrant George Gillespie then became principal, while Baillie supported Strang's right to the post until the latter's death in 1654.<br>
<br>To professional problems was added personal grief, when on 7 June 1653 Baillie's wife, Lilias, his &#145;most gracious and vertuous companion&#146;, died of &#145;a languishing disease&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 3.219, 237). When in October 1656 Baillie remarried he chose as his new wife Helen (<i>d</i>. 1679), the widowed daughter of John Strang.<br>
<br>the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 led to Gillespie's deposition, and Baillie was offered promotion to the principalship by the earl of Lauderdale, Charles II's Scottish secretary, but he dithered. On the one hand the post was, &#145;no lesse than my due and just deserving&#146;, and he felt that acceptance would somehow avenge Strang's forced resignation, but he had always been &#145;farre averse from changes and advancement&#146; and was ageing and ill  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 3.418&#150;19). None the less, he eventually accepted the appointment, which was made on 23 January 1661.<br>
<br>It was to prove an unhappy end to Baillie's career. He was already fearful of the king's intentions for the church, and expressed his opposition to the return of episcopacy, but before the end of the year appointment of bishops began. Baillie was demoralized, realizing that by accepting office as principal he had seemed to endorse this development. His last letter to Spang, in May 1662, reveals that he was ill, and scurvy had been diagnosed. What with physical pain and grief at the Restoration settlement &#145;It were a favour to me to be gone&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters and Journals</span>, 3.483). Scotland had suffered so much for the covenants, and now all was lost and godly men were being persecuted. He met the new archbishop of Glasgow, but made clear that he was opposed to &#145;his way&#146; and refused to use formal &#145;styles&#146; in addressing him  (ibid., 3.487). He longed to see his most ambitious academic work, a chronology of the world from the creation to Constantine the Great, published before his death, but he died in late August 1662 and his <span class="italic">Operis historicum et chronologicum</span> did not appear until 1663.<br>
<br>Baillie was a man who had felt his natural home was a country parish (he was still dreaming of returning to one in 1661) but whose talents and enthusiasm led to his half pushing himself, half being dragged, into more public roles in which he never felt entirely at home. He repeatedly expressed fears of the consequences of his actions and hesitated to speak out, but he recognized this vein of timidity in himself and sought to overcome it. He used his skills in favour of the dominant&#151;and therefore relatively safe&#151;covenanting cause in the 1640s, and once involved in the movement showed in his propaganda pamphlets and his letters that he could at times be virulent to the point of bloodthirstiness. More creditable were the occasions when he overcame his fears sufficiently to protest against the persecution of colleagues in the ministry. None the less, his protests, though brave, were muted, and it was pliancy, a willingness to be persuaded by prevailing opinion, that shaped his career. The man who was reluctant to accept the abolition of episcopacy in 1638 and 1639 soon became one of its most renowned opponents, but then accepted its reintroduction in 1661. Recognition of his tendency to accept the lead of others is clearly indicated in the judgement that this &#145;learned and modest man: though he published some very violent Writings&#146; did so at &#145;the instigation of other persons&#146;  (Burnet, 23).<br>
<br>The distraction of public affairs limited Baillie's achievements as a scholar, but his reputation was high. It was claimed that he was a man of &#145;profound and universal learning&#146;, but the assertion that he understood twelve or thirteen languages  (Wodrow, 1.288) is doubtless exaggerated. Only one personal description of Baillie survives. In 1657 Lauderdale referred to him as &#145;my old acquaintance, the some times litle monk of Kilwining&#146;  (Stephen, 2.38), words that conjure up the quiet, scholarly man rather than the strident covenanting propagandist.<br>
