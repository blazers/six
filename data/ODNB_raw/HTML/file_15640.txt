<span class="headword">Kip,  Johannes</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1653, <em>d.</em> 1721?), <span class="occ">draughtsman and engraver</span>, was born in Amsterdam. He trained there under the engraver Bastiaen Stopendael from May 1668, probably for two years, and lived in Stopendael's house on the Angeliersgracht. His marriage to Elisabeth Breda in Amsterdam on 5 April 1680 resulted in at least one daughter, whose name is unknown. Kip's earliest dated engraving is from 1672, and he provided many plates for books published from this date onwards. In 1686 he made six plates of <span class="italic">William of Orange, his Wife and Attendants near The Hague</span>. Shortly after William's usurpation of the English throne in 1689 Kip travelled to England, although it is not known if this was motivated by connections with William's court.<br>
<br>The majority of Kip's work consists of topography, which has been called &#145;the most dynamic area of publishing &hellip; in the first quarter of the century&#146;  (Clayton, <span class="italic">The English Print</span>, 75). It was possibly for William's court that he began to develop and produce the bird's-eye prospect views of country houses on which his reputation rests. The first view was of the Chelsea Hospital&#151;in which William had quickly taken a personal interest on becoming king&#151;which Kip drew and engraved in 1690. About 1698 he began producing drawings and plates for his best-known work, <span class="italic">Britannia illustrata, or, Views of several of the queen's palaces, as also of the principal seats of the nobility and gentry of Great Britain</span>, a collection of high-quality engraved bird's-eye prospects sold on single sheets from about 1700 and issued together in 1707. For the first volume of this work, which achieved &#145;immediate success&#146;  (Harris, 140), Kip engraved the views drawn by Leonard Knyff, but for the second volume he drew and engraved the views himself. He probably sold out his interests in the work before or shortly after its publication, and it was expanded by booksellers with contributions from other artists from 1709. Kip also drew and engraved the sixty-five plates for Robert Atkyn's <span class="italic">The Ancient and Present State of Gloucestershire</span> (1712) and engraved Thomas Bladeslade's drawings for John Harris's <span class="italic">The History of Kent</span> (1719).<br>
<br>During his career in Britain Kip produced engraved portraits, frontispieces, and architectural miscellany, and for an unknown period lived in and sold prints from his house on St John's Street, Westminster. His contemporary reputation as a fashionable engraver probably peaked in 1708 with the appearance of <span class="italic">Britannia illustrata</span>, but he found himself superseded by the engraver Henry Hulsburgh, who introduced a more up-to-date architectural survey into the expanded work of 1715. Kip retained a persuasive reputation as a draughtsman and engraver. He published a 12-sheet view of St James's Park from Buckingham House in 1710, and was chosen by Godfrey Kneller to survey his new house about 1715.<br>
<br>Kip can probably be identified with the John Kipp who was buried in St Margaret's Church, Westminster, on 12 August 1721. It is not known when his wife died, but his daughter outlived him and, having reputedly been taught by him, seems to have been known as an artist of some merit. Since his death Kip's reputation has suffered, with the credit for much of the draughtsmanship in his work going to Knyff.<br>
