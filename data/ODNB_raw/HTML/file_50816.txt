<span class="headword">Thorfinn (II) Sigurdson</span> <span class="st"> [&THORN;orfinnr Sigur&eth;arson, &THORN;orfinnr inn R&iacute;ki]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1009&#150;<em>c.</em>1065), <span class="occ">earl of Orkney</span>, was called inn R&iacute;ki (&#145;the Mighty&#146;) in later sources and remembered as being the most powerful of all the earls of Orkney; he was also the first to be recorded as having been granted the earldom of Caithness in the kingdom of Scotland. He was the son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49270/', "Sigurd (II), earl of Orkney")</script>, and of a daughter of &#145;Malcolm, king of Scots&#146;, most probably <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17858/', "Malcolm II")</script> (<i>r</i>. 1005&#150;1034). He was born <i>c</i>.1009, as he is said to have been &#145;only five years old&#146; in <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> when his father was killed at the battle of Clontarf in 1014: he was then living with his grandfather, Malcolm, king of Scots, who gave him Caithness and Sutherland, with the title of earl, &#145;and appointed counsellors to govern with him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 13).<br>
<br>Despite his Scottish upbringing Thorfinn became thoroughly immersed in the late viking world of the Norse settlements around the northern and western coasts of Scotland, which had been raided and conquered by his ancestors. He built on the successes of his father and maintained a maritime &#145;empire&#146; stretching from Shetland and Orkney to the southern Hebrides, even including Man (and &#145;a large realm in Ireland&#146; if the saga is to be believed). This was the result of his successful career as a warrior and leader of a war-band (<i>hir&eth;</i>) whose generosity is lauded by his court skald Arn&oacute;rr Earls' Poet (Arn&oacute;rr Jarlask&aacute;ld). Administrative and tax-raising structures (as seen in the territorial units of ouncelands) in the northern isles and the Hebrides were probably developed by him, and the saga writer provides the significant information that after his pilgrimage to Rome Thorfinn gave up piracy and &#145;devoted all his time to the government of his people and country and to the making of new laws&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 31). He certainly made Birsay in Orkney his chief residence and established the seat of the first bishop there, building Christchurch, &#145;a fine minster&#146;. It is to this period of time that the full ecclesiastical establishment of churches and priests in Orkney, Shetland, and Caithness can be attributed. Thorfinn's own piety is beyond doubt, as is evident from his pilgrimage to Rome. Neither liaisons nor offspring of any union is mentioned other than with his wife, Ingebjorg 
    (Earls' Mother; <i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1070)
  , daughter of Finn &Aacute;rnason of Norway, and one of their sons is named, significantly, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21594/', "Paul")</script> (the first Christian name in the earldom family).<br>
<br>The preliminary phase of Thorfinn's rise to eminence concerned his struggle with his half-brothers, Sumarlidi, Br&uacute;si, and Einarr, to gain a share of the earldom of Orkney which they had divided between them on the death of their father in 1014. After Sumarlidi's death Thorfinn claimed his third of Orkney, although it was argued by Einarr that Caithness and Sutherland&#151;which Thorfinn held&#151;constituted over a third of their father's earldom. With the support of Thorkel Amundson, an Orkney farmer who fostered Thorfinn when young, he succeeded in acquiring one-third of the islands. The rivalry with Earl Einarr came to a head at a feast at Thorkel's farm at Sandwick, when the earl was murdered by Thorkel (recorded in the Icelandic annals in the early fourteenth century as having taken place in 1020). These events gave the king of Norway, &Oacute;l&aacute;f Haraldsson, an opportunity to intervene in the affairs of the earldom to his own advantage, and there are some highly imaginative scenes, described in the section of <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> devoted to Thorfinn, of the occasion when the king announced the terms of the agreement made with Br&uacute;si and Thorfinn over Earl Einarr's third of the earldom. The Icelandic annals describe this as Thorfinn and Br&uacute;si giving the Orkneys into the power of King &Oacute;l&aacute;f. Later, when &Oacute;l&aacute;f was exiled from Norway (1028&#150;30), Thorfinn managed to reverse the balance of power and secure two-thirds of the islands, and Br&uacute;si kept one.<br>
<br>During the negotiations with &Oacute;l&aacute;f, Br&uacute;si had to leave behind as a hostage his son, <a name="cosubject_50816"></a><span class="headword">R&ouml;gnvald (II) Br&uacute;sason</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1046), <span class="occ">earl of Orkney</span>, an outstanding member of the earldom family, who also played a foremost role in the stirring events that took place in Norway in the following decade. He participated in the battle of Stiklestad, and went into exile with Harald Hardrada to Novgorod, returning with Magn&uacute;s &Oacute;l&aacute;fsson the Good to Norway in 1035. The following year he was given the title of earl, three fully equipped long ships, and one-third of the islands by Magn&uacute;s, although when he arrived in Orkney he claimed his father's third also, which Thorfinn allowed, &#145;because his hands were full with the Hebrideans and the Irish&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 22). The two campaigned together in the Hebrides, Ireland, and a wide area of western Scotland, and this successful partnership continued for several years, culminating in raids on England during Harthacnut's reign (1040&#150;42). They must have made a dramatic contrast: R&ouml;gnvald, &#145;one of the handsomest of men, with a fine head of golden hair, smooth as silk&#146;, who had &#145;a great reputation for his shrewdness and courtesy&#146;  (ibid., chap. 19), and Thorfinn, &#145;unusually tall and strong, an ugly-looking man with a black head of hair, sharp features, a big nose and bushy eyebrows&#146; but &#145;a forceful man, greedy for fame and fortune&#146;  (ibid., chap. 20).<br>
<br>At some point during this period (the chronology of the saga account does not permit any specific date to be hazarded), Thorfinn faced attack from a powerful ruler of Scotland, called in the saga Karl Hundason, who claimed Caithness and expected tribute to be paid for it by the earl. The claim on Caithness, and the location of the movement of the armies of both Earl Thorfinn and King Karl around the Moray Firth make it very likely that the Scottish rival was a ruler of the province of Moray, rather than of the southern mac Alpin dynasty: that he may have been Macbeth has often been suggested, though never entirely proven. He was clearly a famous warrior and the battles fought with Thorfinn&#151;one in Orcadian waters, off Deerness, and the other near Karl's own home base at &#145;Torfness&#146; (possibly Tarbat Ness in Easter Ross)&#151;were close-won victories for Thorfinn. The descriptions of them and of Thorfinn, accoutred with &#145;a golden helmet on his head, a sword at his waist, wielding a great spear in both hands&#146; are highlights of the saga narrative and among the best in Icelandic literature. &#145;People agree that he went ahead of all his troops&#146;, and Arn&oacute;rr Earls' Poet sang of the encounter:<blockquote>
<div>Well the red weapons<br>
</div>
<div>fed wolves at Tarbat Ness,<br>
</div>
<div>young the commander who created that Monday-combat.<br>
</div>
<div>Slim blades sang there<br>
</div>
<div>south on Oykel's bank.<br>
</div> (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 20)</blockquote>After this encounter Karl disappears from the saga narrative, which (if he can be identified with Macbeth) could be accounted for by his movement south on the take-over of Duncan's kingdom. Such a unique turn of events created an unprecedented situation and might explain the succeeding description of Thorfinn's conquering raids as far south as Fife.<br>
<br>The next dramatic scenario centres on the falling-out of the two earls, Thorfinn and Rognvald, over the third of the earldom that had belonged to Earl Einarr. Thorfinn's resources were stretched by the arrival of a relative by marriage, Kalf Arnason, who was fleeing from King Magn&uacute;s, with &#145;a large following&#146;. The earls came to blows at the naval battle of Roberry, off south Ronaldsay, which was decided when Kalf decided to put his &#145;six large ships&#146; into Thorfinn's force. R&ouml;gnvald was finally hunted down and killed on Papa Stronsay just before Christmas 1046, betrayed by the barking of his lap-dog as he hid among the rocks; he was buried on Papa Westray. This was after he had set Thorfinn's house (on the mainland of Orkney) on fire when the earl had made a dramatic escape, unnoticed by the attackers, through a wooden partition wall with Ingebjorg in his arms. The saga tells us that R&ouml;gnvald's death &#145;was mourned by many&#146; and that &#145;everyone agrees that of all the Earls of Orkney he was the most popular and gifted&#146;  (chap. 30).<br>
<br>Thorfinn thereafter ruled the Orkneys unopposed; but presumably in expiation for his murder of R&ouml;gnvald and at least thirty of his supporters he went on pilgrimage to Rome, where he had an audience with the pope &#145;and received absolution from him for all his sins&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 31). This famous journey included a visit to Swein Estrithson in Denmark and the emperor Heinrich III in Germany &#145;who gave him a warm welcome and many fine gifts&#146;  (ibid.). Thorfinn died &#145;towards the end of the reign of Harald Sigurdarson&#146; (Harald Hardrada), that is <i>c</i>.1065, and was buried at Christchurch, Birsay, Orkney, in &#145;the very church he had built&#146;  (<span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span>, chap. 32). A foremost ruler of the Scandinavian world, Thorfinn's &#145;empire&#146; fell apart at his death and his earldoms were divided between his two sons, Paul and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62845/', "Erlend")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21594/', "Paul")</script>]. His widow, Ingebjorg, is said in <span class="italic">Orkneyinga Saga</span> to have married Malcolm III Canmore, king of Scots: a liaison recorded in no other source, but which may have produced Malcolm's two eldest sons.<br>
