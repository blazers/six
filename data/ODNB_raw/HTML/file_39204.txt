<span class="headword">C&uacute; Chuimne</span>  (<em>d.</em> 747), <span class="occ">canonist and hymn writer</span>, is associated with Columba's monastery of Iona in a colophon found in the Paris manuscript Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, MS Lat. 12021. His date of birth is unknown but his obit is recorded in 747 in the annals of Ulster, where he is called &#145;the wise (<i>sapiens</i>)&#146;. To C&uacute; Chuimne is also attributed a Latin hymn to the Virgin Mary which is considered the best of early Irish Latin hymns, notable for the hymnodist's skill in versification, being marked with alliteration, assonance, and internal rhyme. The hymn, &#145;Cantemus in omni die&#146;, was intended to be sung and testifies to the devotion to the Virgin which was fostered by Adomn&aacute;n of Iona and developed in the eighth-century Irish church. Two ancient quatrains in Irish are also associated with C&uacute; Chuimne's name. In the annals of Ulster these are attributed to C&uacute; Chuimne's nurse, while in the eleventh-century <span class="italic">Liber hymnorum</span> the first quatrain is put in the mouth of Adomn&aacute;n and the response to the first quatrain, given in the second quatrain, is attributed to C&uacute; Chuimne. The quatrains state that C&uacute; Chuimne squandered his resources on nuns but later repented and devoted himself to learning. These peccadilloes may account for the fact that his name is not mentioned in the later martyrologies.<br>
<br>The colophon copied into the Paris manuscript Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, MS Lat. 12021, states that C&uacute; Chuimne collaborated with Ruben of Dair-Inis (Ruben mac Connad) to compile the <span class="italic">Collectio canonum Hibernensis</span>. This collection of canons was drawn up from biblical, patristic, penitential, and conciliar sources, both native and foreign. The wealth of sources shows the number of books available to the compilers, perhaps in the library of the monastery at Iona. The <span class="italic">Collectio</span> was a reference book to the enactments of the church, arranged according to subject rather than chronology, and gave instructions on how an eighth-century Christian should live. There are two main recensions of the collection: A, the shorter, in sixty-five books, in which the latest author cited is Theodore of Canterbury (<i>d</i>. 690); and B, the longer, in sixty-eight or sixty-nine books, in which the latest author cited is Adomn&aacute;n of Iona (<i>d</i>. 704). The collection contains decrees which had links with native Irish law concerning the family, property, and ecclesiastical organization. There are parallels to the contents in the eighth-century vernacular legal text <span class="italic">Bretha Nemed</span> composed in Munster. The <span class="italic">Collectio</span> was a juridical source which covered not only spiritual but also ecclesiastical and social activity. Evidence for the actual implementation of the decrees seems slight. The text hardly ever suggests that penalties are to be enforced if the stipulations are not observed. It has been argued that there was originally a florilegium of extracts in Ireland on which the <span class="italic">Collectio</span> was based. The compilers often alter their sources and when the authors cited offer conflicting ideas, no attempt is made to reconcile them. Among the sources, two bodies of native synodical decrees are used. Those of the Synodus Hibernensis were propagated by a faction in the Irish church, which followed older ecclesiastical practices, while those of the <i>Romani</i> followed those of Rome. The decrees of the Synodus Hibernensis are believed to show the influence of C&uacute; Chuimne, since he came from Iona, a centre notable for the conservatism of its practices, which was the last to accept the Roman calculation for the date of Easter, in 716. The Synodus Hibernensis passed rulings which were more likely to mention native legal institutions than were those of the <i>Romani</i>.<br>
<br>All the surviving manuscripts of the <span class="italic">Collectio</span> stem from the continent, where it was influential, and much copied, especially in Brittany. No manuscripts of the text survive from Ireland. The text was known to St Boniface, Archbishop Odo of Canterbury, Bishop Arbeo of Freising, Sedulius Scottus, Wulfstan, and, possibly, the Carolingian empress Judith. In the late eighth and ninth centuries the collection was transmitted on the continent particularly in regions with long Celtic traditions or where the &#145;officially&#146; promulgated Roman texts seem to have been little copied. The Welsh and Anglo-Saxon evidence points to the existence of an insular tradition of the text. The section on marriage influenced later European conciliar collections. It has been proposed that there was a connection between the stipulations of the text on kings, possibly drawn up under the influence of Adomn&aacute;n of Iona, and a school of thought in the Irish church at that time which was particularly concerned with altering the succession practice, and especially the inauguration ritual, of kingship, and that this influenced the anointing of Pippin III in Francia.<br>
