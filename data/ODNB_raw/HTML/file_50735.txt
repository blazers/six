<span class="headword">Senhouse,  Humphrey</span>  (1705&#150;1770), <span class="occ">landowner and port founder</span>, was born on 2 July 1705 at Millom Castle, Cumberland, the fourth child of Humphrey Senhouse (<i>d</i>. 1738) and his wife, Eleanor, daughter of William Kirkby of Ashlack, Lancashire. Humphrey Senhouse senior was a scion of an old gentry family in west Cumberland and had his roots in Whitehaven. He was agent at Millom Castle for his aunt until her death in 1715. The following year he moved his wife and children to the family property at Netherhall and Ellenborough, on the west Cumberland coast north of Workington, which he had purchased from his brother's heirs. His son subsequently built his town here and thus gained his reputation.<br>
<br>Senhouse was educated at a school at Lowther, Westmorland, from 1720 to 1723, and went to Queen's College, Oxford, in 1724. He returned home to Netherhall on the death of his younger brother in 1727. On 16 February 1731 at Carlisle Cathedral he married Mary, daughter and ultimately coheir of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9698/', "Sir George Fleming")</script> of Rydal, Westmorland, dean (and later bishop) of Carlisle, a marriage which strengthened his standing and eased his entry into the close-knit hub of county society at Carlisle. They had three sons and a daughter. Their eldest son, Humphrey (1731&#150;1814), confirmed the family's ascent into the cluster of gentry dynasties which dominated political life in Cumberland by serving as MP first for Cockermouth and then for the county.<br>
<br>His elder brother also having died young, Senhouse inherited the estate at Netherhall and Ellenborough on his father's death in 1738. He was soon to transform the trade of the northern part of the west Cumberland coalfield by founding a new town and port on his property. In the early eighteenth century there was a small harbour at Ellenfoot, from which coal was shipped, and in 1740 a Whitehaven merchant named Walter Lutwidge proposed the establishment of a new industrial settlement there. In 1749 Senhouse promoted a parliamentary bill to improve the harbour at Ellenfoot, with a view to obtaining a share of the coal trade, at that time dominated by Whitehaven and the Lowther family. Harbour work commenced in May 1749 and by the middle of the following year the new harbour was handling thirteen or fourteen ships at any one time.<br>
<br>From the very beginning Senhouse had planned to develop a new town at Ellenfoot, which he renamed &#145;Mary Port&#146; in honour of his wife. More than one hundred rectangular plots in the town were sold between 1749 and 1769, almost half of the sales being in the years 1752 to 1754. Nearly all the purchasers were local. By the mid-1770s Maryport contained about 340 families and the port was home to 70&#150;80 vessels, engaged principally in shipping coal to Ireland and the Isle of Man, but also in trading with the Baltic. Unlike Whitehaven, Maryport was not heavily involved in trade with North America. An iron furnace, established in 1754 on Senhouse's property beside the River Ellen by a consortium of Whitehaven merchants, provided for a secondary trade to supplement the export of coal. By the time of Senhouse's death, the port and town at Maryport yielded an annual return of over &pound;150, out of a total rental income of over &pound;600.<br>
<br>Senhouse retained a close personal interest in Maryport, playing the leading role in founding the town's church, St Mary's, which was consecrated in 1763. Although he and his family continued to worship at the parish church at Crosscanonby, he bore most of the expense of establishing the new church, providing all the stone for the building and the churchyard wall, paying for the furnishings, and negotiating a contribution to the curate's salary from the governors of Queen Anne's bounty. Patronage of the church was vested in Senhouse and his successors and a measure of independence from the mother church at Crosscanonby was achieved in 1766, when the churchwardens agreed no longer to collect contributions for communion wine from the inhabitants of Maryport.<br>
<br>Senhouse also took an active part in developing the coalmining industry on which his new port depended. In 1736 his father had agreed with Sir James Lowther of Whitehaven to refrain from mining, but Senhouse obtained a relaxation of that constraint and, in 1755, took a lease of Broughton colliery with his neighbour, John Christian of Ewanrigg, and four other partners, a move which helped to prevent Lowther from securing a monopoly over the west Cumberland coal trade. A waggonway, built across Senhouse's estate, carried coals from Broughton to the harbour at Maryport.<br>
<br>Humphrey Senhouse died at Bath in late June or early July 1770 and was buried in the family vault at Crosscanonby church on 26 July. The words on his monument in Maryport church, written by one of his sons, record his foremost achievement: &#145;the town of Maryport founded and flourishing through his auspicious patronage&#146;.<br>
