<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Wharton,  Thomas</span>  (1614&#150;1673), <span class="occ">physician</span>, only son of John Wharton (<i>d</i>. 1629), and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1646), daughter of Roger Hodson of Fountains Abbey, Yorkshire, was born at Winston, co. Durham, in 1614 probably in August, and was baptized there on 31 August of that year. Little is known of Wharton's childhood and youth other than that he experienced a self-described &#145;pestilential fever&#146; in 1633. He matriculated as a sizar at Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1637. Wharton then migrated to Trinity College, Oxford, where he may have been influenced by followers of William Harvey, some of whom were then members of Trinity. At Trinity he tutored John Scrope, natural son of Emanuel, Lord Scrope of Bolton. From 1642 to 1645 Wharton spent much time with John Scrope at Bolton Castle in the North Riding of Yorkshire, studying chemistry and medicine. In December 1644 Wharton accompanied Mr and Mrs Elias Ashmole to the South Lambeth house of John Tradescant the younger: he subsequently participated in cataloguing part of the Tradescants' collection of scientific curiosities, which was later acquired by Ashmole and became the nucleus of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. At Bolton, Wharton also served as a member of the royalist garrison from 1642 to 1645. Subsequently he moved to London to study medicine with the physician John Bathurst, who had Yorkshire connections, and assisted him with his practice.<br>
<br>When John Scrope died in 1646 Wharton returned to Oxford, where he was created DM on 7 May 1647. A candidate of the College of Physicians, London, in 1648, he became a fellow in 1650, incorporated at Cambridge on his doctor's degree in 1652, and served as a censor of the college in 1658, 1661, 1666, 1667, 1668, and 1673. From 1648 he practised medicine in London, and his patients included the Ashmoles, the artist William Faithorne, and the countess of Northampton. On 25 June 1653 he married Jane (<i>d</i>. 1669), daughter of William Ashbridge, of London. They had three sons, Thomas, Charles, and William; the latter two died young. In 1657 Wharton was appointed physician to St Thomas's Hospital, London, a post he held for the rest of his life. During the London plague of 1665 he was one of the few college physicians who remained in the capital, where he treated plague sufferers at St Thomas's Hospital. As a reward he was promised the next available appointment as physician to the king, but the post was given to another, and Wharton received only an augmentation of his paternal coat of arms.<br>
<br>In 1652 or 1653 Wharton delivered the Goulstonian lectures at the College of Physicians on the subject of the glands, a topic assigned to him by the college president, Sir Francis Prujean (1593&#150;1666). These six lectures formed the basis of his only anatomical work, the 287 page Latin text <span class="italic">Adenographia, sive, Glandularum totius corporis descriptio</span>, first published in London in 1656. Other editions include those published at Amsterdam (1659); Oberwesel (1664, 1671, 1675); and D&uuml;sseldorf (1730). Portions of <span class="italic">Adenographia</span> also appear in LeClerc and Mangot's <span class="italic">Bibliotheca anatomica</span> (Geneva, 1699, 1.200&#150;03; 2.755&#150;73). An English translation by Stephen Freer, with a historical introduction by Andrew Cunningham and a facsimile of the 1656 edition, was published in 1996.<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">Adenographia</span> is the first European text devoted entirely to the glands. Previously, anatomists had not considered glands important in understanding the functioning of the body. For example, both Galen and Vesalius noted various glands, but they did not consider them as a separate topic, and their treatment was cursory. A 1559 text by the Italian Realdo Columbus, <span class="italic">De re anatomica</span>, devoted one of its fifteen books to the glands, but the book consists of just two pages. Wharton's extended presentation of glands as classes of related natural objects changed this; consequently, for several decades after its initial publication, <span class="italic">Adenographia</span> was considered a basic reference on the subject. In addition to discovering the duct of the submandibular (salivary) gland, Wharton named the thyroid gland (though he was not its discoverer).<br>
<br>Wharton, a self-proclaimed Aristotelian, adopted scholastic modes of reasoning in <span class="italic">Adenographia</span>. For him, as for his mentor Francis Glisson, various kinds of matter had specific qualities and affinities, not just the properties of mass, extension, and motion. For them, different bodily fluids ended up in the right places because of an attraction of like for like. Wharton did not use a microscope and disparaged the virtuosi among whom the microscope was popular. In contrast, contemporary mechanist anatomists, such as Marcello Malpighi, used the microscope to discover fine structures, which they then related to the behaviour of particles and substances. By the later seventeenth century mechanical analyses that emphasized structure&#150;function relationships and denied the possibility of special properties were displacing scholastic accounts, and <span class="italic">Adenographia</span> began to lose influence.<br>
<br>Wharton wrote four English verses, entitled &#145;Arcanum, or, The grand secret of hermetic philosophy&#146;, prefixed to a translation by Elias Ashmole, and published in Ashmole's <span class="italic">Theatrum chemicum Britannicum</span> (1652). He was also a close friend of Izaak Walton, who acknowledged his integrity and anatomical assistance in <span class="italic">The Compleat Angler</span>.<br>
<br>The Royal College of Physicians holds five volumes of Wharton's manuscripts numbered SR 640&#150;644. In letter no. 10 in MSS SR 640, which was written in 1673, the year Wharton died, he responded to the query of a Mrs Church as to whether her son should become a physician. Wharton compared unfavourably the professional situation of physicians with those of attorneys and clerics. He also derided the universities for abandoning the &#145;old and sound Aristotle learning&#146; for &#145;new-fangled fripperies of Cartes [Descartes], Gassendus, Boyle, Hobbs, and Regius, etc&#146;.<br>
<br>Wharton's outburst against mechanist natural philosophers belies the impression contemporaries had of him as a leader in developing new medical knowledge. For example, in 1657 the prominent physician Walter Charleton, in his <span class="italic">Immortality of the Human Soul, Demonstrated by the Light of Nature</span>, portrayed the College of Physicians as a veritable &#145;Solomon's House&#146; of intense collaborative investigation of the structure and function of animal bodies and noted Wharton among the &#145;Miners of Nature&#146; for his investigations of glands . Wharton's collaborators included Francis Glisson, George Ent, Baldwin Hamey, and John Bathurst, all members of the College of Physicians.<br>
<br>Wharton died in London on 15 November 1673 and was buried next to his wife at the church of St Michael Bassishaw, London, where a monument was erected. The church was demolished in 1897, and the monument moved to St Lawrence Jewry, where it was destroyed by enemy action during the Second World War. Wharton's grandson <a name="cosubject_29166"></a><span class="headword">George Wharton</span>  (1688&#150;1739), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was the eldest son of Thomas Wharton (1652&#150;1714), who followed his own father, Thomas, to Pembroke College and practised medicine; he was buried at Durham in 1714. George's mother was Mary, daughter of John Hall, an alderman of Durham. He was born at Old Park, Durham, on 25 December 1688, and matriculated from Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 6 July 1706, proceeding MB in 1712 and MD in 1719. He was elected a fellow at the Royal College of Physicians on 30 September 1720, and was censor in 1725, 1729, 1732, and 1734. He was treasurer from 1727 until his death. Wharton married Anna Maria, daughter of William Petty. In 1729 George Wharton presented a portrait of his father to the Royal College of Physicians. He died from &#145;mortification of the bowels&#146; at his home in Fenchurch Street, London, on 21 March 1739. As he died childless, the Old Park estate passed to his younger brother, Robert, mayor of Durham. A number of later descendants, including Christopher Wharton (<i>d</i>. 1990), were physicians and fellows of the Royal College.<br>
