<span class="headword">Hales, Sir  Robert</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1381), <span class="occ">administrator and prior of the hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England</span>, may have come from a Lincolnshire or Norfolk family. He probably began his career at Rhodes, where he had become preceptor of Sanford and Slebech before August 1358, when he was allowed to leave the convent. Having returned to England, he acted as attorney for the prior of England, John Paveley, in July 1362, but in October 1365 was one of the 100 knights of St John who took part in the crusade of Pierre I of Cyprus which captured Alexandria. By February 1366 he was an associate of the master, Raimond B&eacute;renger, and perhaps also preceptor of Upleden, while in April 1367, Pope Urban V granted him full absolution in the case of his death. He was back in England no later than November 1370, and when Paveley died in 1371, he was nominated as his successor. As prior of England, Hales was summoned to parliament in 1372 and 1373, and between 1375 and 1380, while in June 1373 he was called to the king's service against the French, though the expedition did not materialize.<br>
<br>In June 1374 a serious dispute arose when the master, Robert Juilly, appointed the Scot Robert Mercer to be administrator of the Scottish properties of the order. The appointment was confirmed by Pope Gregory XI in January 1375, but by then Hales, who claimed authority over the Scottish preceptory, had caused Edward III to put a stop on the order's moneys from England that were destined to finance the return of the master to Rhodes and an expedition against the Turks. Although in February 1375 Gregory warned that anyone claiming to have rights in Scotland would be forced to bow to justice, pope and master soon gave in. On 15 October 1375 Juilly and the convent of Rhodes revoked the grant of the Scottish preceptory to Robert Mercer, and reserved the provision of this preceptory to the English prior, while the pope nominated a foreign administrator to take over the Scottish properties of the order for the time being. In December Gregory asked King Edward to lift the arrest on the order's moneys and to allow the English contingent of an expedition planned for 1377, consisting of thirty-eight brethren and thirty-eight serjeants, to leave the country. However, only a few went, and Hales, who also stayed in England, was made admiral of the fleet from the Thames to the west in November 1376, and again in August 1377. In November 1377 Hales went to sea with a fleet led by Thomas of Woodstock, earl of Buckingham, and others. Having endured storms and many other difficulties, they returned without success.<br>
<br>Nevertheless, Hales became increasingly important in English politics. In November 1378 he was appointed to the third of the continual councils which administered the country in the name of the young Richard II; the fact that he was subsequently paid for 238 days' attendance shows that he was among its more active members. In September 1380 he was a member of a commission, headed by John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, to deal with breaches of the truce with Scotland. Presumably it was such services that lay behind his appointment, on 1 February 1381, to be treasurer of England. The fact that he himself then lent the government 1000 marks did nothing to relieve Hales of the stigma of association with the third poll tax in four years, even though it had been granted in the previous November, before he took up office. The collection of this extremely unpopular tax led directly to the peasants' revolt, of which Hales was to be one of the principal victims. On 10 June 1381 Temple Cressing and other hospitaller properties in Essex were burnt down, while on 13 June the priory in Clerkenwell was sacked and destroyed, as was its manor at Highbury, which Hales himself had restored and beautified. Like the king and the chancellor, the aged Archbishop Sudbury, Hales fled for safety to the Tower of London. But when Richard went out to meet the peasants at Mile End on 14 June (on his way there he received a complaint against Hales from a London goldsmith, Hugh Farringdon), a company of the rebels was able to enter the Tower. They found Sudbury and Hales in the chapel of St John in the White Tower, dragged them out, and beheaded them on Tower Hill. The fate of Hales's body is unknown. The leaders of the peasants' revolt were killed or executed, but many others were pardoned, and it is not known who was responsible for the death of Hales. In spite of his violent end, in historiography and political poetry he was acclaimed as a most energetic and doughty knight.<br>
