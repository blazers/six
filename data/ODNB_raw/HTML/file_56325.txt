<span class="headword">Schwabe,  Julie</span>  (1818&#150;1896), <span class="occ">philanthropist and educationist</span>, was born at Bremen on 31 January 1818, daughter of the Jewish merchant Gottschalk Herz Schwabe, and was educated at Hamburg and Leipzig. She was originally named Ricke Rosetta Schwabe; by the time of her marriage she had the name Julie. In London on 14 October 1837 she married her older kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/57656/', "Salis Schwabe (1800&#150;1853)")</script>, a wealthy calico printer who had adopted Unitarianism and been naturalized British by act of parliament on 11 March 1835. Mistress of two grand homes&#151;Crumpsall House near Manchester and Glyn Garth near Beaumaris&#151;she entertained lavishly, hosting contemporary &#145;lions&#146; like Chopin, Jenny Lind, Baron Christian Bunsen, and Ary Scheffer, whose portrait of her, painted in 1850, shows a bright, buxom woman with dark hair, full lips, and a challenging gaze. She had an insatiable urge to befriend people, at the risk of mixing them up. Among her assorted acquaintances were the Cobdens, the Brownings, Dickens, Ferdinand Gregorovius, Alexander Herzen, George Eliot, Jane Welsh Carlyle, and Elizabeth Gaskell who, while noting the gay flow of her existence, was one of many to salute her exceptional kindness, her help to anyone in sorrow. Her sensitivity to pain was seen when she walked out disgusted from a bullfight in Madrid. Like her husband, who not only built a colossus of a chimney for his factory at Rhodes, near Middleton, but did all that a benevolent capitalist could for both workers and society, she was enthusiastic for every good cause, from imprisoned Chartists to the German Hospital in Dalston. She found time also to give birth to three daughters and four sons, raising them with the help of governesses including Malwida von Meysenbug.<br>
<br>Salis's unexpected death on 23 July 1853 deprived his wife (as she humbly avowed) of &#145;quiet, clear reasoning power&#146;  (BL, Add. MS 45789, fols. 199&#150;204). Julie Schwabe's was an effervescent personality, passionate, impulsive, even indiscriminate, as she bounced from cause to cause. When she spoke, she intermingled half of Europe's languages. But in debate she was shrewder than critics contended. To one who thought foreign recipients of her charity might feel demeaned she wisely observed: &#145;I do not understand what scruples of delicacy should limit the freedom of all men to unite on the common ground of humanity in an act of benevolence&#146;  (Schwabe to A. Panizzi, 13 May [1862], BL, Add. MS 36720, fols. 434&#150;5). Moreover, in devoting her energies to the happiness of others, she was seldom wasteful. If she lent money to Wagner (whose music sent her to sleep), she later defied his indignation by reclaiming it for a better cause. Ambitious, persuasive, and determined to succeed, she was never shy of knocking at famous doors in the hope of sponsorship. Few dared disobey her, be it to give money, run errands, or draft correspondence. Unlike Salis Schwabe, who had held that socialism was a subtle poison that needed replacing with Christianity, she cared little for the creed as long as it fed the belly and did not close the mind.<br>
<br>Russian and Italian exiles found in Mrs Schwabe an ally for their political struggle. In 1860 she shipped tents, mattresses, and ambulance supplies to Garibaldi's troops, and raised money for the wounded; the first she induced to contribute was Florence Nightingale. In 1861 she became British representative of the Italian Ladies' Philanthropic Association, which Garibaldi, at her suggestion, had exhorted to provide food, work, and education for the masses. She quickly raised &pound;2000 in subscriptions, and a further &pound;1000 through a Jenny Lind concert. Long shocked by squalor and ignorance in Naples, she hastened to establish a girls' elementary school there under the direction of Emily Reeve; on the latter's untimely death from cholera in 1865, it had to be disbanded. Meanwhile she continued charitable works at home, frequently visiting the family schools at Rhodes, donating cloth for the children's uniforms, and arranging parties and outings. She increased her ability to help by personal economies, such as travelling third class on the railways. When the injured Garibaldi was confined at Varignano in 1862 she rushed to his side, made his first clean shirt, and procured a waterbed for him from Paris.<br>
<br>Truly international in spirit, Julie Schwabe funded medical relief for victims of conflict everywhere&#151;Poles in 1863, Germans in 1866, French in 1870, Russian Jews in 1891. But her heart was set on Naples. After extensive negotiations she was granted in 1873 the lease of a large public building, the disused Collegio Medico. Earlier inspired by the ideas of William Ellis (1800&#150;1881), she was convinced by friends to work also with Froebel methods. She opened first a kindergarten and a mixed elementary school, and with the proceeds of art sales in London and Berlin added in 1877 a training college and in 1879 secondary classes for girls, whose parents helped cover the costs of poorer pupils. At the Brussels pedagogical congress in 1880 she expounded her belief in the moral basis of education and the removal of prejudice. Despite malicious opposition from the church she persevered until, in 1887, her establishment was publicly incorporated as the Istituto Froebeliano Internazionale; in 1890 a handicrafts centre was added. Meanwhile she had conceived for England something more influential still: the Froebel Educational Institute in West Kensington, for which she liberally supplied both money and encouragement; its training college was officially opened by her friend the Empress Frederick in 1895. That same year she republished in its support her intriguing book about Richard Cobden, whose devotion to free trade she shared more for cosmopolitan than for commercial reasons. (It had come out first in French, in 1879, in aid of the Naples schools.)<br>
<br>Julie Schwabe (who in later life was sometimes known as Julie Salis Schwabe) died suddenly of pneumonia at the former Collegio Medico on 20 May 1896, and was buried three days later at the British cemetery in Naples in the presence of Italian and foreign dignitaries. In a subsequent tribute Claude Montefiore praised &#145;her tremendous faith in the supreme importance of the cause, her unshaken conviction that persistent pegging away will at last overcome every obstacle&#146;  (<span class="italic">Middleton Guardian</span>, 17 July 1897, 5).<br>
