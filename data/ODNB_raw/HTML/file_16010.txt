<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Langdale,  Marmaduke</span>, first Baron Langdale  (<em>bap. </em>1598, <em>d.</em> 1661), <span class="occ">royalist army officer</span>, was the only son of Peter Langdale, esquire (<i>d</i>. 1617), and his wife, Anne Wharton (<i>bap</i>. 1576/7, <i>d</i>. 1646), daughter of Michael Wharton, esquire, of Beverley and his wife, Joane. He matriculated at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1613 and succeeded his father in 1617, inheriting from him estates at Molescroft, Pighill, Sancton, and Bainton. He then pursued a military career in Europe in the service of the queen of Bohemia. Among his comrades was his neighbour, the future parliamentarian Sir John Hotham. In 1620, under the command of Sir Horace Vere, he participated in the defence of the Palatinate against the Spanish.<h2>
<a name="Theopponentofthorough"></a>The opponent of &#145;thorough&#146;</h2>On 12 September 1626, at St Michael-le-Belfry in York, Langdale married Lenox (<i>d</i>. 1639), daughter of Sir John Rodes of Barlborough, Derbyshire, and his third wife, Catherine, daughter of Marmaduke Constable of Holderness. Lenox was also the sister of Sir John Hotham's first wife, Katherine Rodes. Despite his refusal to pay the forced loan in 1627 Langdale was knighted by Charles I at Whitehall on 5 February 1628. He resided at North Dalton until his purchase of Holme-on-Spalding-Moor from Sir William Constable in 1633. He spent over &pound;12,000 on land purchases and increased his rents, bringing his family into the ranks of the county's upper gentry. They had four sons and three daughters, but on 22 July 1639 Lenox died in childbed at Holme.<br>
<br>Langdale became a predictable and leading opponent of Charles I's and Wentworth's policy of &#145;thorough&#146;; in 1638 Wentworth referred to him as a &#145;Person of ill Affections I am sure, to the Provinciall Power, if not to the Regall Power&#146;  (Cliffe, 311). His rent book contains notes detailing Yorkshire's grievances during the bishops' wars, and in 1639 he led the East Riding's opposition to ship money. Wentworth reflected on 26 March 1639:<blockquote>I hear my old friend Sir Marmaduke Langdale appears in the head of this business, that gentleman I fear carries an itch about him, that will never let him take rest, till at one time or other he happen to be thoroughly clawed indeed. (Cliffe, 313)</blockquote>He was appointed high sheriff of Yorkshire on 12 November 1639, and his health may have been poor as he made his will six days later. The king had rejected Wentworth's suggestions for the shrievalty, intent on punishing Langdale with the appointment, reasoning that his attitude would soon change when faced with making up tax shortfalls himself. However, Langdale still took no action for months, and the king remarked that he had &#145;neglected to perform that service in manifest contempt of our crown and dignity, and thereby have incurred our high displeasure and indignation&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1640</i>, 223). He finally agreed to collect the tax on 16 June 1640, after having been threatened with Star Chamber proceedings. Despite his opposition he remained on the commission of the peace, and on 28 July 1640 many Yorkshire gentlemen gathered at his house, where a petition of the county's grievances was framed by Sir John Hotham and Sir Hugh Cholmley.<h2>
<a name="Theroyalist"></a>The royalist</h2>Despite maintaining close links with key future parliamentarians until early 1642, Langdale was named a commissioner of array for Yorkshire on 18 June 1642. In July he mustered Sir Henry Griffith's trained bands regiment of foot in the East Riding, and was commissioned a colonel. In November, with parliamentarian forces blockading York, he was sent to persuade the earl of Newcastle's royalist army, north of the River Tees, to march to York's relief and accept command in the county in place of the earl of Cumberland. Langdale had seen the devastation wrought by the Thirty Years' War, and his letter to Sir William Savile dated from Newcastle on 9 November reveals his foreboding and reluctance for war:<blockquote>We in Yorkshire should have some happiness if we could make an end of the troubles and distractions of our county and so divert the war southward, that whatsoever foreign nations come they may be employed in the South where the wellspring of our miseries began, and where there is pillage enough to satisfy many armies. (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 1.70)</blockquote>Langdale waited upon Queen Henrietta Maria shortly after she landed with her convoy at Bridlington on 25 February 1643, and, making a very favourable impression, equipped his regiment with some of her arms and supplies. He was also involved in important attempts to persuade his kinsmen, the Hothams, to forsake their parliamentarian allegiance. On 11 September 1643 he was commissioned colonel of a brigade of horse returned from Ireland. A mark of his military reputation, he was even authorized to summon his own council of war.<h2>
<a name="TheNorthernhorse"></a>The Northern horse</h2>When the Scots covenanter army invaded England, Langdale defeated its cavalry at Corbridge on 19 February 1644. Despite the royalists' defeat at Marston Moor on 2 July he enjoyed success against Sir Thomas Fairfax in his part of the battle. He retreated with Rupert through Lancashire, fighting in engagements at Ormskirk and Malpas, where he was wounded on 26 August 1644. During these weeks he forged a new brigade composed of the remnants of the earl of Newcastle's old cavalry regiments, 1600 veterans known as &#145;the Northern horse&#146;. After joining the king's main field army he fought at Donnington Castle in November and in Rupert's raid on Abingdon.<br>
<br>In the following year Langdale was given permission to return northwards to endeavour to relieve Pontefract Castle. On 25 February 1645 he defeated a parliamentarian force under Colonel Rossiter that intercepted him at Melton Mowbray. On 1 March 1645 he relieved Pontefract, scattering the besiegers. His report claimed to have captured 20 colours and 500 prisoners, representing one of the royalists' last major field victories in England. Returning south, he was wounded again at Lydney in Gloucestershire on 15 April. He commanded the Northern horse on the royalist left wing at Naseby on 14 June, but was outnumbered and overpowered by Oliver Cromwell, sustaining heavy losses. He was present at Rowton Heath on 24 September as a major-general, and won the royalists initial advantage before the battle was lost.<br>
<br>The Northern horse contributed to the king's subsequent decision to move northwards, but Charles's elevation of Lord Digby to the position of lieutenant-general in England north of the Trent eclipsed Langdale from command. Digby's poor generalship contributed to the devastation of the remnants of the Northern horse at Sherburn in Elmet, in Yorkshire, on 15 October 1645. Digby and Langdale fled through Skipton into Cumberland but were further defeated at Burgh by the Sands. On 24 October they embarked at Ravenglass for the Isle of Man, whence they took ship for Ireland. Langdale finally reached France, and on 15 May 1646 a parliamentarian agent reported his presence in Paris.<h2>
<a name="Thesecondcivilwar"></a>The second civil war</h2>At the outbreak of the second civil war Langdale landed in Scotland in early 1648, where he angered his Scottish allies by refusing to wait for them to complete their preparations. On 28 April 1648 he captured Berwick by surprise with only 100 men. Raising the northern royalists, he invaded England with a commission from the prince of Wales as commander of five northern counties. He rallied considerable support and his forces of English royalists grew to 3000 foot and 600 horse. His army then joined the larger Scottish engager army under the duke of Hamilton as it marched down the western side of the Pennines. Langdale's forces suffered heavy losses when Hamilton ignored his warnings and the engager army was defeated by Cromwell at the battle of Preston on 17 August 1648. Langdale was captured six days later while resting in a small alehouse near Nottingham. He wrote an account of the failed expedition  (printed in Sunderland, 133&#150;6). He was confined in Nottingham Castle and might have been sentenced to death, for on 21 November 1648 he was among the seven royalists exempted from pardon by parliament. However, Lady Savile (Sir William's widow) aided his escape and, employing a variety of disguises including that of a milkmaid, he eventually made his way to London. Sir Thomas Fairfax offered a reward of &pound;1000 for his capture, his estates were confiscated, and he was perpetually banished as an enemy and traitor on 13 March 1649. He had reached the continent safely by April, and in June he was sent for a short time to assist the earl of Derby in the defence of the Isle of Man. He was reportedly &#145;a very lean and much mortified man so that the enemy called him ghost (and deservedly, they were so haunted by him)&#146;  (Sunderland, 231).<h2>
<a name="Exileconversionandreturn"></a>Exile, conversion, and return</h2>Langdale engaged in the Venetian service in 1652, defending Candia (Crete) against the Turks from 5 to 12 May. After war broke out between England and the United Provinces, Langdale offered to seize Newcastle and Tynemouth with the aid of the Dutch, but he was not encouraged. Now Langdale was openly Roman Catholic; Sir Edward Nicholas wrote to Sir Edward Hyde in January 1653: &#145;I pray by whom was the K. moved to send for Sir M. Langdale and to make him of his Council? Sir M. [is] as eager in pursuing the Papists' interest as any new Popish proselyte ever was&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nicholas Papers</span>, 2.3). Langdale was reported in the royal council as &#145;driving on with much fierceness the Catholics design and extolling excessively those worst of Papists in Ireland&#146;  (Newman, <span class="italic">Royalist Officers</span>, 223). He confidently expected Catholic priests to carry royalist messages for him in Yorkshire, but by favouring a Spanish alliance he distanced himself from his fellow English Catholics around the queen. Sir Edward Hyde clashed with him also, describing him as &#145;a man hard to please, and of a very weak understanding, yet proud, and much in love with his own judgement&#146;  (Scrope and Monkhouse, 3.135, 181). He resided in Brussels for much of 1655 where he resented his exclusion from plans for the 1655 uprisings and complained of having to deal with Richard Overton's and Edward Sexby's Leveller involvement in royalist conspiracy: &#145;I am so weary of discoursinge with them that I can noe longer endure it with patience &hellip; they are not wourth the taking notice of&#146;  (<span class="italic">Nicholas Papers</span>, 3.128). He was involved in the royalist plot uncovered in the spring of 1658, but by the later 1650s he had become extremely poor and took refuge at the English Benedictine abbey of Lambspring, in Westphalia. On 4 February 1658 at Bruges the future Charles II created him Baron Langdale of Holme-on-Spalding-Moor.<br>
<br>Langdale returned to Holme in 1660 and was the only pre-war JP to return to the bench in the East Riding. He was also appointed lord lieutenant of the West Riding in 1661. His estates were comparatively easy for him to recover because his confiscated manors of Holme, Pighill, Molescroft, and Gatenby had been granted to leading republicans and regicides. Nevertheless he had reportedly lost &pound;160,000 in the royal service. On 7 April 1661 he wrote to excuse himself from attending Charles II's coronation; he pleaded that he was too poor to attend with the requisite dignity, but he was also in poor health. He died in his house at Holme on 5 August 1661, and did so without a priest, as his son reportedly could not bring himself to warn him of Langdale's impending death. He was buried on 10 August among his ancestors in the sanctuary on the right side of the altar at All Saints' parish church, Sancton, where a monumental inscription commemorated him. He was succeeded as second baron by his son and namesake.<br>
