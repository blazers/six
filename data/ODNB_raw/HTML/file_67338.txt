<span class="headword">Morley,  Ebenezer Cobb</span>  (1831&#150;1924), <span class="occ">lawyer, sportsman, and sports administrator</span>, was born at Hull, Yorkshire, on 16 August 1831, the son (there were also three daughters) of Ebenezer Morley, Congregational minister, and his wife, Hannah Cobb, who had been married at St Mary's, Kingston upon Hull, five years earlier. Morley was baptized at his father's Holborn Street Chapel in Hull on 11 September 1831. He became an articled clerk to a solicitor and qualified in law in 1854.<br>
<br>From 1858 Morley lived in Barnes, Surrey, and he practised as a solicitor at various addresses in London, including 10 King's Bench Walk and 53 Gresham House, Old Broad Street, until 1921. He was always ready to give free legal advice to the poor and he also supported working men's clubs. He was a justice of the peace and he represented Barnes on Surrey county council between 1903 and 1919, attending meetings of the music and dancing houses, racecourses and explosives licensing committee, and various education committees. He was also a conservator of Barnes Common. On 14 October 1869 he married Frances (1837/8&#150;1911), daughter of Alexander Masters Bidgood, woollen merchant. They had no children.<br>
<br>Morley was often referred to as &#145;the grand old sportsman of Barnes&#146;, and sport, in several forms, was his abiding interest. He was an accomplished oarsman and, in 1864, rowed in the London Rowing Club's eight for the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley. He was secretary of the London Rowing Club for many years and also founder and secretary (1862&#150;80) of the Barnes and Mortlake regatta. He also helped to organize a big annual athletics meeting on the day of the university boat race. He kept a pack (twelve couples) of foot beagles, and for nearly fifty years he hunted with the Surrey union foxhounds and, for twenty years, the Devon and Somerset staghounds. He also built and equipped a small gymnasium&#151;near his Thames-side home, 26 The Terrace, Barnes, Surrey&#151;which was used by footballers and oarsmen.<br>
<br>Football, however, was the sport on which Morley made his biggest mark. He played the game on Barnes Common before he formed the Barnes football club in 1862, which was based at the Limes Field at Mortlake. There were regular disputes about the way the game was played: Should the ball be handled as well as kicked? Should &#145;hacking&#146; an opponent be permitted? Morley, a natural and willing organizer, wrote to <span class="italic">Bell's Life</span> suggesting that football have set rules in the way that cricket had. This led to the meeting of representatives of a dozen London and suburban clubs at the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London, on 26 October 1863, at which the Football Association of England (FA) was formed. Morley was a clever and effective player himself and he scored the first goal in the first representative match (London versus Sheffield, 31 March 1866).<br>
<br>Morley himself drafted the FA's first set of playing laws for football, which, hitherto, had been a violent thing of the streets and fields or a collective exercise, with many confusing variations, of the public schools. Several meetings were held before there was agreement, and &#145;hacking&#146; was forbidden. The FA's early influence was confined largely to the London area, but its motives and ambitions were honourably based and its authority grew steadily. Morley's strong handwriting can be seen in the first minute book which is still in the possession of the FA. Morley was secretary of the FA for three years (1863&#150;6), and as its second president (1867&#150;74) he was the first man to present the FA cup in 1872. He was a principal guest at the FA's golden jubilee dinner in 1913. His wife having predeceased him, Morley died of pneumonia at his Barnes home on 20 November 1924&#151;eighteen months after the opening of Wembley stadium&#151;at the age of ninety-three. He was buried in Barnes old cemetery five days later.<br>
<br>As the first secretary of the first organized football body, Morley may be described as the father of the world's most popular game. Morley and the FA gave the game shape and direction which led, a decade after the FA's foundation, to the birth of tournament and international football.<br>
