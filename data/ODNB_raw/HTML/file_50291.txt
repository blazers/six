<span class="headword">Beauclerk, Lord  Frederick de Vere</span>  (1773&#150;1850), <span class="occ">cricketer</span>, was born on 8 May 1773 in the parish of St George, Hanover Square, London. He was the fourth child and youngest son of the seven children of Aubrey Beauclerk, fifth duke of St Albans (1740&#150;1802), and Lady Catherine Ponsonby (1749&#150;1789), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22504/', "William Ponsonby, second earl of Bessborough (1704&#150;1793)")</script>, and he was a direct descendant of Charles II and Nell Gwyn. After being privately tutored, in 1790 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained his MA in 1792 and his DD in 1824. He was ordained deacon in 1795 and priest in 1797, and he was vicar of Kimpton, Hertfordshire, from 1797 to 1827 and then vicar of both Redbourn, Hertfordshire, and of St Michael's, St Albans from 1827 to 1850. Like many youngest sons, though, he entered the church reluctantly, and often forsook his clerical duties in favour of sport: &#145;he ne'er preaches once a twelvemonth&#146; was one biting judgement. He was married on 3 July 1813 to Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1866), the third daughter of Charles Dillon, twelfth Viscount Dillon, and of Henrietta Maria, only daughter of the first Baron Mulgrave. The couple had two sons and two daughters. Lord Frederick also later became lord of the manor of Winchfield, Hampshire, which he inherited from his brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1845/', "Lord Amelius Beauclerk")</script>, in 1846.<br>
<br>Lord Frederick devoted much of his life to cricket, which was then becoming fashionable and achieving metropolitan recognition, partly because it served the Regency taste, avidly shared by Lord Frederick, for excessive gambling. He claimed to earn 600 guineas a year in this way, roughly the same as from his two clerical livings. As a player he was a quick, bustling figure, usually clad in striped trousers, scarlet sash and white beaver hat, 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighing 12 stone. He was described as a very fast runner, an excellent slip fielder, and a &#145;wonderfully accurate&#146; underarm bowler; as a batsman he was slow to begin but, once set, capable of attacking offside hitting. He succeeded Silver Billy Beldham as England's finest batsman, and was for several years the most effective &#145;amateur&#146; single-wicket player in the land. Lord Frederick's career stretched over thirty-five years. In the ninety-nine important matches in which he played, he scored 4555 runs (averaging 27), including four centuries, and took 251 wickets&#151;exceptional figures for the time. In all forms of cricket, his highest score was 170 for Homerton against Montpelier in 1806.<br>
<br>Lord Frederick was the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Thomas Lord's patron, the earl of Winchilsea, and took part in the first recorded match on the present Lord's ground in 1814; he often played for the Gentlemen against the Players between 1806 and 1824. He became a frequent visitor to the ground (accompanied by his dog), and was president of the MCC in 1826. He was not popular, however, being widely regarded into his disgruntled old age as the autocratic arbiter of the game. He had a petulant and unbridled temper, and stories about his fierce disposition abound: David Dawson, an infamous horse poisoner, once refused him entry to his coach because of his &#145;fluent and expressive language&#146;. Lord Frederick died at his London home, 68 Grosvenor Street, on 22 April 1850, just before his seventy-seventh birthday, and was buried at Winchfield Manor, his country residence. He left properties at Winchfield and Odiham to his son Charles.<br>
