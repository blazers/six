<span class="headword">Albone,  Daniel <span class="st"> [Dan]</span></span>  (1860&#150;1906), <span class="occ">cycle and motor tractor manufacturer</span>, was born at the Ongley Arms inn, Shortmead Street, Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, on 12 September 1860, the fourth son and youngest of eight children of Edward Albone (<i>d</i>. 1864), publican and market gardener, and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Gilby (<i>d</i>. 1883). The death of his father, who was tenant of the Ongley Arms, left his mother with a large family to bring up and she continued to run the inn while ensuring that the children received schooling. Dan was also a church chorister. On his ninth birthday he was given a Boneshaker bicycle by his cousin and became a keen cyclist. About 1872 he was apprenticed to the Biggleswade millwrights and engineers Thomas Course &amp; Son, Hitchin Street. Being mechanically minded he designed and built his first bicycle, a spider cycle with suspension wheels, in 1873. By 1880 he was advertising bicycles for sale, which he manufactured in the outhouses of the Ongley Arms, and which he named the Ivel Cycle Works after the nearby River Ivel. Also in 1880 he started the Biggleswade and District Cycling Club, for which he rode in races.<br>
<br>From 1880 Albone marketed lightweight racing bicycles, to which he added tricycles in 1882 and a safety bicycle in 1885. Following his mother's death he became landlord of the Ongley Arms, which became a stopping place for cyclists on the Great North Road, combining the occupations of innkeeper and cycle manufacturer. He advertised his products by racing them. In 1885 he won open races over 2 miles at Oundle, Lincolnshire, and 1 mile at Crystal Palace, and was an original member of the North Road Cycling Club, founded in December 1885.<br>
<br>In 1886 Albone developed the Ivel Automatic Steerer, a tricycle which could be ridden with minimal use of the handles. Also in 1886 he marketed a cross-framed Ivel safety bicycle, of the type designed by John Kemp Starley, Hillman, and Cooper. Ridden by George Pilkington Mills in October 1886 to break the 50 mile record on the Great North Road, the Ivel safety bicycle was advertised as &#145;the fastest bicycle ever made&#146;  (Irvine and Miller, 23). He followed this in 1887 by marketing a drop-frame safety bicycle for women, which was one of the first to be commercially produced. Other innovations included his design of low-friction ball-bearing axles which used to produce pony traps.<br>
<br>Albone married on 23 August 1887 Elizabeth (1860&#150;1936), daughter of Charles Moulden, tailor; they had a son and a daughter. In 1887 he became proprietor of the Ivel Hotel in Biggleswade, next to the Ongley Arms. The Ivel Cycle Company Ltd, incorporated in March 1888, had expanded to employ fifty men, and Albone travelled around Britain establishing agencies for its products. In September 1888 he won the international 5 km Tricycle Scratch Race at Sheveningen, Holland, which he regarded as his greatest racing achievement. Pneumatic tyres were fitted to Ivel cycles from 1890 and in 1892 he patented a wickerwork child carrier fitted to the front of cycles. His firm was affected by the recession in the cycle trade in 1893, brought about by overproduction, and went into voluntary liquidation, but resumed cycle making in 1894.<br>
<br>Albone constructed a prototype motor car in 1898 and exhibited it in London in 1900, having in 1899 sold one to the duke of Bedford. His work on car design benefited from his experience of cycle building, which gave him an understanding of lightness and strength. The Ivel motor car had independent suspension, pneumatic tyres, and a choice of one or two cylinder Benz engines. He produced an Ivel motor bicycle in 1901, including a version designed for women.<br>
<br>Albone also began experiments in using petrol-driven engines for agricultural purposes, where they had the advantage of being lightweight compared to existing steam traction engines. In the summer of 1902 he demonstrated a motor-driven three-wheeler to cut a field of hay and followed this by demonstrations of ploughing. In November 1902 he applied for a patent for a motor tractor for agricultural purposes, which was accepted in 1903, and in December 1902 registered Ivel Agricultural Motors Ltd to produce the new machines. The other directors included Selwyn Edge and Charles Jarrott. The tractors were marketed in 1903, received much publicity and orders from around the world, and won a silver medal at the Royal Agricultural Society show in 1904. The Ivel tractor has been seen as the forerunner of later, multi-purpose tractors, and were the most successful of the early British tractors, although the number in use on British farms remained very small before the First World War. Albone foresaw the military potential of his invention, demonstrating an armoured version to War Office officials in 1903. One of his last inventions was the Ivel potato planter, which ploughed and then set potatoes.<br>
<br>Albone was active in Conservative politics in Bedfordshire, and was secretary of the Licensed Victuallers' Association in the county. He was prominent in the town's celebrations on the relief of Mafeking in 1900. He died on 30 October 1906 at the Ivel Hotel, Biggleswade, where he was taken after collapsing from an apoplectic fit due to cerebral haemorrhage while receiving a telephone call at the Ivel Cycle and Motor Works. He was buried in Biggleswade cemetery on 2 November. In recognition of his achievement in designing the first successful light internal-combustion engine agricultural tractor, the Albone glacier in Antarctica was named for him in 1964.<br>
