</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Sedgwick,  Adam</span>  (1785&#150;1873), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 22 March 1785 in the vicarage at Dent, Yorkshire, the third of seven children of Richard Sedgwick (1736&#150;1828), the local vicar, and his second wife and cousin, Margaret, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sturgis, (<i>bap</i>. 1752, <i>d</i>. 1820). From an early age Sedgwick attended the grammar school at Dent, between the ages of eight and sixteen under the instruction of his father. In 1801 he was sent to the grammar school at Sedbergh conducted by the Revd William Stevens.<h2>
<a name="TheCambridgestudent"></a>The Cambridge student</h2>In 1804, after a summer of tutoring from the self-taught mathematician John Dawson, Sedgwick entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a sizar, a position which allowed poorer students to pay reduced fees in exchange for doing menial duties. Unsophisticated, untravelled, and uncouth, Sedgwick gradually began to make an impression at Cambridge, despite a near-fatal attack of typhoid in 1805. He was elected to a college scholarship in 1807, and graduated fifth wrangler in the following year. He took private pupils and read for a Trinity fellowship, which he finally obtained in 1810. Overworked in preparing for the position and dissatisfied with its duties, in 1813 he burst a blood vessel and his health broke down completely. Sedgwick recovered during the next few years, but suffered thereafter intermittently from poor health. He became an assistant tutor in mathematics at Trinity in 1815, and was ordained a year later, when he also travelled for several months on the continent.<h2>
<a name="EarlyyearsasWoodwardianprofessor"></a>Early years as Woodwardian professor</h2>In 1818 Sedgwick was elected to the Woodwardian professorship of geology at the University of Cambridge, a post which he was to hold with great distinction for the next fifty-five years. He had previously attended the mineralogical lectures of Edward Daniel Clarke and read a few works on the subject, but he was elected on the strength of his character, connections, and general ability. The new appointment galvanized Sedgwick into action. He undertook his first geological excursion in that summer and became a fellow of the Geological Society of London. In 1819 he delivered his first course of lectures, and joined with John Stevens Henslow and others to encourage scientific pursuits within the university by founding the Cambridge Philosophical Society.<br>
<br>Sedgwick's most immediate concern after taking up his chair was to build up the geological collections of the university. He collected rocks and fossils during systematic tours in the British Isles and elsewhere in Europe, and he also purchased rare specimens, either with his own funds or through public appeals. The collection quickly outgrew its original accommodation, and in 1841 spacious new quarters were at last made available. By this time the Woodwardian had a reputation as one of Europe's outstanding geological museums.<h2>
<a name="Earlyfieldstudies"></a>Early field studies</h2>In connection with his summer collecting tours, Sedgwick became an accomplished field geologist, learning much from Henslow and William Daniel Conybeare. His earliest papers, read in 1820 before the Cambridge Philosophical Society, discussed the structure of the ancient rocks of Devon and Cornwall. An important monograph published in the Geological Society <span class="italic">Transactions</span> in 1829 used the Magnesian Limestone as a key for working out the structure of New Red Sandstone of north-east England. Sedgwick correlated the rocks with their counterparts in Germany, showing that these strata formed an uninterrupted succession from the Lias down to the Coal Measures.<br>
<br>In 1828 Sedgwick accompanied the wealthier but less experienced Roderick Murchison, whom he had met at the Geological Society, on a tour of Scotland. Opposing the work of John MacCulloch, they concluded that the ancient sandstones of the north-west highlands could be correlated with the Old Red Sandstone to the east, a finding which geologists abandoned in the second half of the century after much controversy. The two men became close friends, and during the following summer travelled in the eastern Alps, aiming to find a continuous succession to bridge the notorious gap between the fossil faunas of the Secondary and Tertiary strata.<br>
<br>As these early papers show, Sedgwick believed that the remaining &#145;lost pages&#146; in the record of the rocks would be found, and that geologists could hope to obtain a comprehensive picture of earth history. Two eloquent presidential addresses to the Geological Society in 1830 and 1831 expressed his theoretical views. Discussing Charles Lyell's recently published <span class="italic">Principles of Geology</span> (1830&#150;33), Sedgwick agreed that geologists had demonstrated the need for a vastly expanded time-scale. He abjured his support for fellow cleric William Buckland's attempt to find empirical evidence for a universal flood, and attacked those, like Andrew Ure and William Cockburn, who interpreted geology in the light of scripture. However, Sedgwick rejected what he saw as Lyell's gratuitous assumption that geological processes had been uniform in intensity throughout all time. He argued that the empirical record of the strata bore witness to catastrophic events without parallel in forces currently shaping the face of the earth.<h2>
<a name="BelowtheOldRedSandstone"></a>Below the Old Red Sandstone</h2>From the late 1820s, Sedgwick's chief goal in geology was to complete a big book on the strata below the Old Red Sandstone. Most of his papers over the next two decades were progress reports on this project, as Sedgwick toured the Lake District, Wales, and the southern uplands of Scotland to add to his knowledge of the older rocks. In 1831 he entered north Wales with the young Charles Darwin, who thereby gained his first training in the field. Sedgwick, with his thorough grounding in mathematics, had an unrivalled ability to work out the complex geological structures characteristic of these strata. Particularly important was a distinction, which he emphasized from the late 1820s, between stratification, jointing, and slaty cleavage. Sedgwick was also guided by Leonce Elie de Beaumont's theory of the elevation of mountain chains, which he believed would provide a key to unravelling the older rocks.<h2>
<a name="TheCambrian"></a>The Cambrian</h2>While Sedgwick was in north Wales, Murchison independently began examining the younger and more fossiliferous strata of south Wales and the Welsh borders. Together, their work provided the foundations for a new classification of the oldest rocks with fossils: Sedgwick's strata were called the Cambrian, while Murchison's became the Silurian. This amicable arrangement was threatened when Henry De la Beche discovered Coal plants in rocks which appeared to be of the same age as those which the two friends had been studying. The resulting controversy, in which the two friends collaborated closely, bore fruit in their 1839 announcement of the Devonian system as a distinctive period in earth history.<br>
<br>The creation of the Devonian, however, also effectively removed any distinctive fauna from Sedgwick's Cambrian. The problem was exacerbated when John Eddowes Bowman, Daniel Sharpe, and finally the official Geological Survey extended its work into Sedgwick's territory during the early 1840s; most of the strata which had been identified as being older than the Silurian proved to be of the same age. Almost all geologists followed Murchison in wiping the Cambrian off the map, ignoring Sedgwick's attempts to create alternatives to what he condemned as a grossly over-extended Silurian. Sedgwick believed that the question involved nothing less than the foundations of proper scientific method. Strata classifications required a secure understanding of geological structure; only then could fossils take their rightful place in establishing correlations. For Sedgwick, the issue was one of first principles.<br>
<br>By the 1850s, with his book on the older rocks scarcely begun, Sedgwick argued the case for the Cambrian in increasingly intemperate language. He cut off links not only with Murchison, but also with the Geological Society (whose Wollaston medal he had been awarded in 1851) and the metropolitan geological community more generally. The controversy was settled only after Sedgwick's death. The discovery of a fauna below that of Murchison's oldest Silurians&#151;first in Bohemia and then in Wales&#151;became the basis for a redefined Cambrian. The uppermost strata of Murchison's expanded system were called Silurian, and the strata in between were termed Ordovician.<h2>
<a name="Thoughtsonevolution"></a>Thoughts on evolution</h2>Throughout his life, Sedgwick was an eloquent advocate of the moral basis of scientific enquiry, which he saw as a bulwark against the chilling influence of unbelief. His <span class="italic">Discourse on the Studies of the University</span> (1832), originally delivered as a sermon in Trinity College chapel, argued for the place of geology within natural theology, opposing what he condemned as the misuse of the science by scriptural literalists. The sermon reserved its strongest fire for the utilitarian philosophy of John Locke and William Paley, eliciting a savage reply from John Stuart Mill in the <span class="italic">Westminster Review</span>.<br>
<br>Sedgwick passionately opposed all attempts to explain the origin of new species through natural laws. He was particularly concerned about Robert Chambers's anonymous best-seller, <span class="italic">Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</span> (1844), which introduced an evolutionary cosmology to a wide public. Such views threatened to undermine the moral and spiritual basis of Christian society, and Sedgwick condemned them in a long review for the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> and in even longer additions to the bloated fifth edition of his <span class="italic">Discourse</span> (1850). By the time Darwin sent him a copy of the <span class="italic">Origin of Species</span> in 1859, Sedgwick's reaction was predictably one of dismay:<blockquote>You have <i>deserted</i>&#151;after a start in that tram-road of all solid physical truth&#151;the true method of induction, and started off in machinery as wild, I think, as Bishop Wilkins's locomotive that was to sail with us to the moon. (Clark and Hughes, 2.357)</blockquote>That Darwin, a former student, should fall from grace was especially shocking. Sedgwick's lectures, like all those in the natural sciences at Cambridge in the first half of the century, were extracurricular and aimed to make geology an appropriate study for the Christian gentleman. &#145;I cannot teach you all geology&#146;, he told his class, &#145;I can only fire your imaginations&#146;  (Clark and Hughes, 2.489). Nevertheless, he must have hoped they would follow his advocacy of proper reasoning: when Sedgwick set his first examination questions in 1851 after the introduction of the natural sciences tripos, he asked students to show that the fossil evidence does not support evolution.<h2>
<a name="Theeducatorandadministrator"></a>The educator and administrator</h2>Sedgwick was a major performer at the British Association for the Advancement of Science, serving as president at its third meeting in 1833 at Cambridge. In this capacity he voiced his belief that science should be extended to working-class audiences. He gave vivid and widely reported lectures throughout the country, serving as an example of the compatibility of truths of religion and science. In 1820 he became a fellow of the Royal Society of London, which awarded him its Copley medal in 1863 as part of an anti-Darwinian campaign.<br>
<br>Sedgwick was active in university politics and administration. He was appointed senior proctor in 1827, and in 1847 he served as secretary to Prince Albert in his capacity as university chancellor. In politics a firm whig, Sedgwick strongly supported reform of the ancient universities and the abolition of religious tests, and for two years from 1850 he sat on the royal commission appointed to investigate the affairs of the university. His relatively modest income from his chair was supplemented by his college fellowship at Trinity and by his appointment in 1825 to the vicarage of Shudy Camps, Cambridgeshire. In 1832 the whig government offered Sedgwick the valuable living of East Farleigh, which he turned down. Two years later he accepted a prebendal stall at Norwich, which required absence from Cambridge for only two months of each year. Much influenced by the sermons of Robert Hall, Sedgwick had strong evangelical views and opposed innovations in Anglican ritual.<h2>
<a name="Finalyears"></a>Final years</h2>Sedgwick never married, nor could he have done so without giving up the Woodwardian chair, which stipulated that its holder must remain a bachelor. Contemporaries admired his erratic brilliance, while regretting his inability to produce a sustained argument in prose. He was animated, generous, disorganized, hospitable, and prone to procrastination and hypochondria. By the end of his life he was increasingly lonely and isolated at Cambridge, although he received visitors and maintained a wide correspondence, especially with his nieces. He retained a lifelong connection with his home village of Dent, recalled in autobiographical pamphlets issued in 1868 and 1870. Sedgwick died in his rooms at Trinity College on 27 January 1873, and was buried in the college chapel on 1 February. The Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge was established by his successor, Thomas McKenny Hughes, as a memorial to house the collections he had done so much to bring together. He is also memorialized in the Sedgwick prize, given at Cambridge for a student essay; the Sedgwick Club, the undergraduate geological society; and by a granite memorial fountain in Dent.<br>
