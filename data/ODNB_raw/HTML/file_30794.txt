<span class="headword">Barraclough,  Geoffrey</span>  (1908&#150;1984), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was born in Bradford, Yorkshire, on 10 May 1908, the eldest of three children (all sons) of Walter Barraclough, a prosperous wool merchant of that city, and his wife, Edith Mary Brayshaw. He was educated at Ackworth School (1917&#150;19), Colwall (1919&#150;21), &#145;which made a lifelong rebel of me&#146;, Bootham School in York (1921&#150;4), and Bradford grammar school (1924&#150;5). At seventeen he went to work in the family firm of O. S. Daniel &amp; Co., selling essential oils in Europe. &#145;Whatever essential oils may have been&#146;, he wrote, &#145;I soon discovered that they were not essential to me.&#146; In 1926 he won a scholarship to Oriel College, Oxford, where he developed an interest in medieval history, winning first-class honours in history in 1929. Graduate work followed at Munich (1929&#150;31), where he took his new bride, Marjorie Gardiner; they had one son, Alan (<i>b</i>. 1930).<br>
<br>In 1931&#150;3 Barraclough moved to the English School at Rome and did research on the papacy. His first books, <span class="italic">Public Notaries and the Papal Curia</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">Papal Provisions</span> (1935), were intended to correct what he regarded as the provincialism of English medievalists.<br>
<br>In 1934 Barraclough won a fellowship at Merton College, Oxford, and in 1936 moved to St John's College, Cambridge. He also published <span class="italic">Medieval Germany</span> (2 vols., 1938), and became editor of <span class="italic">Studies in Medieval History</span>, designed to introduce English readers to German scholarship. By the age of twenty-nine he was the leading authority on German medieval history in the English-speaking world.<br>
<br>When the Second World War began, Barraclough joined the Enigma project at Bletchley Park, first as an employee of the Foreign Office, and later as a squadron leader in the Royal Air Force. In Bletchley's Hut 3 he became &#145;first of the watch&#146;, presiding over the horseshoe table where Luftwaffe dispatches were read during the battle of Britain. In 1941 he was sent to the Mediterranean, and in 1944 was seconded to France. At the war's end he was in the Air Ministry at London.<br>
<br>During the war Barraclough wrote <span class="italic">The Origins of Modern Germany</span> (1946), which offered a historian's long view of the German problem. The book was widely read, and the policy it recommended was adopted by Britain and the United States.<br>
<br>In 1945 Barraclough became professor of medieval history at Liverpool. He divorced his first wife and married Diana Russell-Clarke; they had two sons, Nigel (<i>b</i>. 1947) and Giles (<i>b</i>. 1948). Diana was the daughter of Edward Russell-Clarke, barrister, of the Inner Temple. The new family moved to an Elizabethan house 18 miles from Liverpool, and lived there from 1945 to 1956, a decade of happiness and peace in Barraclough's life. At Liverpool he founded a programme in archival administration, where a generation of British archivists was trained. He published <span class="italic">The Mediaeval Empire</span> (1950), <span class="italic">Cheshire Charters</span> (1957), and <span class="italic">The Earldom and County Palatine of Chester</span> (1953). Barraclough also developed a new interest in applying history to present problems, and contributed to <span class="italic">The Listener</span>, the <span class="italic">New Statesman</span>, <span class="italic">The Observer</span>, and the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>. A collection of essays appeared as <span class="italic">History in a Changing World</span> (1955). He was also active in the Historical Association, of which he was president in 1964&#150;7.<br>
<br>In 1956 Barraclough was offered the Stevenson research chair at the University of London formerly held by Arnold Toynbee, and the directorship of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. His task was to publish an annual <span class="italic">Survey of International Affairs</span>, a labour which he disliked. In 1962 he quit his job, and returned to St John's College, Cambridge, where he wrote his most successful book, <span class="italic">An Introduction to Contemporary History</span> (1964).<br>
<br>Increasingly restless, Barraclough took flight to America, teaching at Texas (1965) and San Diego (1965&#150;8). He was married a third time, to Gwendolyn Lambert, and in 1968 moved to Brandeis. There he recovered stability in his life, publishing <span class="italic">The Medieval Papacy</span> (1968). There were no children of this marriage.<br>
<br>In 1970 Barraclough was called to Oxford as Chichele professor of modern history and a fellow of All Souls. There, things went badly again. Barraclough felt confined by the curriculum, oppressed by the ambience of All Souls, and disliked by colleagues who expected him to resume a narrow speciality in medieval history.<br>
<br>After two years of strife, Barraclough abruptly left Oxford and returned to Brandeis, remaining there from 1972 to 1981, his most prolific period. He published <span class="italic">The Crucible of Europe</span> (1976), a history of the ninth and tenth centuries; <span class="italic">Management in a Changing Economy</span> (1976), an application of history to economic planning; <span class="italic">Main Trends in History</span> (1976), a survey commissioned by UNESCO; <span class="italic">&#145;The Times&#146; Atlas of World History</span> (1978); <span class="italic">Turning Points in World History</span> (1979); <span class="italic">The Christian World</span> (1981); and <span class="italic">From Agadir to Armageddon</span> (1982). He wrote abundantly for <span class="italic">The Nation</span>, the <span class="italic">New Republic</span>, and the <span class="italic">New York Review of Books</span>.<br>
<br>Barraclough was lionized in Boston, and became a famous figure in American universities. He dressed in a wool tattersall shirt, an old tweed jacket, drab necktie, ancient Oxford bags, and gleaming British walking shoes. He walked rapidly with a curious rolling gait, his bald head cocked oddly to one side, and his round, ruddy face veiled by blue clouds of smoke from a battered pipe.<br>
<br>Honours cascaded upon Barraclough, from everywhere but Britain. &#145;His reputation in Europe and the United States &hellip; was enormous,&#146; an English colleague wrote, but &#145;British colleagues, especially in his later years, tended to view his achievements rather more coolly.&#146; His contribution was to enlarge the historian's territory beyond the boundaries of the nation state, and to expand the temporal context of history from the study of the past to the study of change. His work inspired young scholars throughout the world.<br>
<br>In 1981 Barraclough retired from Brandeis, and moved to Williams College, and in 1982 he taught at Munich. There he fell severely ill of lung cancer. He returned to his second wife, Diana Barraclough, in Burford, Oxfordshire, and resumed a project on Cheshire charters which he had put aside thirty years before. As he neared the end of that last labour, he died at his home, Sylvester House, Witney Street, Burford, on 26 December 1984.<br>
