<span class="headword">Sheridan,  Charles Francis</span>  (1750&#150;1806), <span class="occ">author and politician</span>, was born in June 1750 at 12 Dorset Street, Dublin, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25371/', "Thomas Sheridan (1719?&#150;1788)")</script>, actor and lecturer on elocution, of Richmond, Yorkshire, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25365/', "Frances Sheridan (1724&#150;1766)")</script>, novelist and dramatist, daughter of the Revd Philip Chamberlaine. He was a year older and a much paler literary and political shadow of his better-known brother, the playwright and politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25367/', "Richard Brinsley Sheridan")</script>. Apart from a short period at Mr Whyte's school in Dublin, he was educated by his father, who was anxious that his son should become an orator.<br>
<br>In 1772 Sheridan was appointed secretary to the British ambassador to Sweden and he made his literary reputation by writing <span class="italic">A History of the Late Revolution in Sweden</span> (1778). On his return he entered Lincoln's Inn on 11 May 1775 and he was called to the Irish bar in 1780. At the Irish general election of 1776 Sir Robert Tilson Deane, MP for co. Cork, who wished to obtain a peerage, purchased one of the seats for the borough of Belturbet from Lord Lanesborough for Sheridan. Apart from his connections, the Irish administration probably hoped that they had recruited a good parliamentary speaker, for it was said that:<blockquote>in his manner, ardour and earnestness prevail, which render it strikingly pleasing. In argument he is strong, subtle and acute; investigating with precision, what he has studied with diligence; diving to the bottom of his subject, not merely skimming it's surface; he answers objections with ability, but avoids all asperity of recrimination. (Johnston-Liik, parliamentary lists, 1799(1))</blockquote>However, despite his gifts he kept a low parliamentary profile for the fourteen years that he was in parliament.<br>
<br>In 1782 Sheridan considered that nothing except &#145;the most unequivocal assertion of the total independency of the Irish legislature&#146; would satisfy the country  (Grattan, 2.215). In 1782 the lord lieutenant, the duke of Portland, dismissed John Lees, formerly private secretary to lords lieutenant Townshend and Harcourt and an efficient Dublin Castle apparatchik, and appointed Sheridan under-secretary in the military department of the chief secretary's office. Sheridan owed his appointment to the influence of his brother Richard with the Rockingham whigs. The office was worth &pound;1000 p.a. and a house. At the general election of 1783 he was returned for the borough of Rathcormack, through government influence with Richard Tonson, who also wished for a peerage and duly became Lord Riversdale. In spring 1783 he married Letitia Christiana, the daughter of Theophilus Bolton, and they had at least five surviving children, including Thomas, Charles, Letitia, and Caroline.<br>
<br>As was expected of an office-holder, Sheridan voted a solid government line. Nevertheless, Sheridan's situation in one of the key positions in the Irish establishment provided the Portland whigs who went into opposition in 1784 with a valuable ally inside Dublin Castle. As early as 1783 Lord Lieutenant Temple remarked to his brother W. W. Grenville on &#145;the pleasant private intercourse of the two Sheridans, which you may possibly trace in London as I do here&#146;  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 3.198). Lord Lieutenant Rutland found his literary gifts useful as a pamphleteer in opposition to parliamentary reform and in support of the commercial negotiations and commented that &#145;he has dealt honourably with the government he serves, and his principles have not been warped by the influence of private connections&#146;  (<span class="italic">Rutland MSS</span>, 1.242). The Regency crisis in 1789 broke this discretion and, in accordance with his English connections, he voted for a regency. Lord Lieutenant Buckingham promptly dismissed him but granted his &#145;very handsome and amiable wife&#146; a pension of &pound;600  (<span class="italic">Fortescue MSS</span>, 3.445). Sheridan declared that &#145;he was promised a pension of &pound;1,200, &pound;600 of this to his wife&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PRO 30/8/326, fols. 67&#150;8), but when and whether this materialized is uncertain.<br>
<br>Sheridan's political career ended in 1790. He published two pamphlets: <span class="italic">An Essay on the True Principles of Civil Liberty and Free Government</span> (1793), which upheld the view of Ireland as an independent kingdom, and <span class="italic">Some observations on a late address to the citizens of Dublin with thoughts on the present crisis</span> (1797), in which he attributes the troubled state of the country to the example of France. On the whole, however, he spent his retirement in various unsuccessful experiments, for instance, in trying to design a perpetual motion machine. He was a member of the Royal Dublin Society and of the Royal Irish Academy. He did not enjoy good health and died, aged fifty-six, at Tunbridge Wells on 24 June 1806. The <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> declared him to be &#145;a gentleman of most distinguished talents as an author, both in history and political controversy, and no man was more universally beloved and respected in private life&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 679).<br>
