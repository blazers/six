<span class="headword">Malins, Sir  Richard</span>  (1805&#150;1882), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born at Evesham, Worcestershire, on 9 March 1805, the third son of William Malins of Ailston, Warwickshire, and his wife, Mary, eldest daughter of Thomas Hunter of Pershore, Worcestershire. He was educated at a private school in Soho, London, before entering Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in Michaelmas 1823 and was sixth junior optime. He graduated BA in 1827. He had already joined the Inner Temple in 1825, and was called to the bar on 14 May 1830. On 10 May 1831 Malins married Susanna (<i>d</i>. 1881), eldest daughter of the Revd Arthur Farwell, rector of St Martin's, Cornwall.<br>
<br>Malins practised with success as an equity draftsman and conveyancer in Fig Tree Court, Temple, and later in New Square and in Stone Buildings, Lincoln's Inn. He had no family or other connections in the profession, but he was industrious and persevering, and eventually, through his special knowledge of real property law and of the interpretation of wills, he obtained a good court practice in equity. He trained in his chambers numerous pupils, of whom the most eminent, Hugh Cairns, was his responsible assistant for some time. In 1849 he transferred his membership from the Inner Temple to Lincoln's Inn, and was made a bencher, acting as treasurer in 1870. In 1849 also he was appointed a queen's counsel, and soon enjoyed a large leading business in the court of vice-chancellors Parker and Stuart.<br>
<br>Malins was elected as a Conservative MP for Wallingford in July 1852, standing as a supporter of agricultural protection, and held the seat until July 1865, when he was defeated by Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke. He was a frequent parliamentary speaker, and was prominent in the determined opposition which was made to the <span class="roman">Divorce Bill</span> of 1857. He carried two bills successfully through parliament, the <span class="roman">Infants' Marriage Settlements Act</span>, in 1855, and the <span class="roman">Married Women's Reversionary Property Act</span> in 1857, known jointly as &#145;Malins's acts&#146;.<br>
<br>On 1 December 1866 Malins was appointed a vice-chancellor of the Chancery Division of the High Court in succession to Sir Richard Kindersley. He was knighted in February 1867. He had a considerable gift for marshalling facts, expressed himself with fluency and point, and was esteemed for his amiability and generosity of sentiment; but he was talkative and impulsive, and his judgments did not add much to the law of England. Early in 1879 he was lamed by a fall from his horse. He was seized with paralysis early in 1881, and in March 1881 he retired and was sworn of the privy council. The death of his wife at the end of 1881 hastened his own death, which took place at his London home, 57 Lowndes Square, on 15 January 1882. He was buried on 21 January at Bray, Berkshire. A niece, Henrietta Carey, married the judge Sir Charles James Watkin Williams. He left no family.<br>
