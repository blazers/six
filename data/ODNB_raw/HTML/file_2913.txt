<span class="headword">Borough, Sir  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1643), <span class="occ">antiquary and herald</span>, was the son of John Borough of Sandwich, Kent, and his wife, a daughter of Robert Denne of Dennehill, Kent, who inherited land in The Hague. His grandfather William Borough was apparently married to a Dutchwoman, and his father was described by contemporaries as a Dutch gardener or brewer. He should not be confused with Sir John Burrough, a professional soldier, who was killed at La Rochelle in September 1627.<br>
<br>In 1611&#150;12 Borough was a student at Gray's Inn, the inn of Sir Francis Bacon. He had a position in Bacon's household before 1618 and served Bacon in the Lord Chancellor's Office. Borough also held office as keeper of the ancient records in the Tower of London, a position amenable to his antiquarian interests. In this capacity, with the prominent lawyer and antiquary John Selden, Borough assisted the disgraced Bacon with archival research for his <span class="italic">History of the Reign of Henry VII</span>.<br>
<br>Borough sat in the parliament of 1621 as MP for Sandwich. He was accused in the session of accepting bribes along with his employer, Bacon, but escaped censure when Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel and earl marshal of England, called upon him to assist the countess of Arundel, who was then in Europe. Arundel joined them the next year as ambassador to Venice with Borough serving as his secretary. Arundel himself had a strong antiquarian interest and patronized Selden and Borough's cousin, Sir Robert Cotton, for whom Borough purchased books and manuscripts in Venice.<br>
<br>In 1623, presumably in connection with his stewardship of the records in the Tower and reputation for knowledge of historical precedents, Borough was appointed one of the extraordinary clerks of the privy council. Arundel brought Borough into the College of Arms as Mowbray herald-extraordinary that same year, and by June 1624 Borough had advanced to Norroy king of arms; he was knighted in July of that year. Borough sat in the parliaments of 1624, 1625, and 1626 as MP for Horsham, Sussex, on Arundel's interest. Although a relatively inactive member of the House of Commons he kept detailed notes of the proceedings in these parliaments, an activity in line with his antiquarian interests.<br>
<br>Borough's expertise led crown officials to consult him on virtually all matters that might have historical precedents: in 1631 on the office of lord admiral, in 1634 on coat and conduct money, and also on ship money and other financial measures of the personal rule. Borough dabbled in writing verse, but his only published work resulted from his ship money research, <span class="italic">The Soveraignty of the British Seas</span>, written in 1633 although not printed until 1651. Borough accompanied Charles I on his coronation trip to Scotland in 1633 and the following year became Garter king of arms, the principal herald of the College of Arms and principal officer of arms to the chivalric Order of the Garter. He took a leave of absence from the college to serve in Arundel's embassy to the Holy Roman emperor in 1636, and achieved unpopularity with his fellow heralds when he obtained a grant from the king maintaining his income from the office and suspending all heraldic visitations while he was away. In 1639 Arundel as earl marshal convened a court of inquiry into charges of corruption brought by Borough against Norroy and the Somerset herald, whom Arundel subsequently dismissed from the college.<br>
<br>The name of Borough's wife is unknown, but he was said to have had two sons and two daughters. One son, perhaps named Cassius, accompanied him in the 1636 embassy. The son travelled also in Italy with a son of the principal secretary of state, Sir Francis Windebank. It was presumably the same son who accompanied Borough and two of Windebank's sons in the bishops' war of 1639 against the Scots. Borough was in the king's entourage in his capacity as chief herald, but was also called on to clerk for the privy council when Sir Thomas Meautys fell ill. Borough reported to Secretary Windebank that he himself was ill and in any case had been excluded from all council meetings concerning military matters. The war came calling on Borough, however, when his tent in the king's camp was shot through twice. Despite his claim of having been excluded from proceedings, it was Borough who recorded for posterity most of the important negotiations in the bishops' wars, for example the pacification of Berwick and the treaty of Ripon. Borough was also consulted by the secretaries of state on how to call and hold a great council of peers, which he attended at York in September 1640, once again providing detailed notes of its proceedings.<br>
<br>Borough was a faithful royalist who followed the king in the civil war. At the royalist headquarters of Oxford he was created a doctor of civil law of the university in August 1643, and died there the following October. He was buried in the divinity chapel adjoining the choir of Christ Church. In the same month his post of keeper of the ancient records in the Tower was awarded by the Long Parliament to Selden. Borough's eldest son, John, was a lawyer in the court of chancery. He was knighted by Charles II, but lost his legal practice with the passage of the <span class="roman">Test Act</span>.<br>
