<span class="headword">Maxwell,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1647), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland archbishop of Tuam</span>, was the son of John Maxwell of Cavens in Nithsdale, Kirkcudbrightshire. He entered the University of St Andrews, where he graduated MA on 29 July 1611. In 1615 he was called and ordained minister of Mortlach parish church in Banffshire, which lay in the patronage of the crown. From 1622 he held four successive pastoral charges in Edinburgh. On 18 July 1622 he was chosen by the town council to be minister of St Giles but was translated to Trinity College Church on 25 November 1625. Three weeks later, on 14 December, however, he was nominated by the burgh magistracy to the second charge in St Giles and officially admitted on 27 January 1626. Later that year he was finally promoted to the first charge in the same incumbency. At an unknown date he married Elizabeth Innes; they had four sons, John, David, James, and Robert, and five daughters, Anne, Janet, Elizabeth, Rachel, and Bethia.<br>
<br>Maxwell was initially brought to the king's notice through the recommendation of his cousin James Maxwell of Innerwick (afterwards earl of Dirleton), who as a gentleman of the king's bedchamber was ideally placed to promote the interests of his kinsman. In July 1629 John Maxwell was sent to court in London, ostensibly to discuss how best the Scottish church should combat Roman Catholicism. In reality, however, his trip south had been arranged with a view to discussing the introduction of a new Scottish liturgy which conformed to, and imitated, the English prayer book. Fearful of an adverse and possibly violent reaction from Scottish public opinion Maxwell conveyed to Bishop William Laud of London the Scottish hierarchy's view that it was inexpedient simply to transpose wholesale the English liturgy to Scotland. Nevertheless Maxwell made a favourable impression on the future archbishop, and became his chief acolyte in Scotland. He returned from court in November 1629 reputedly bearing the king's instructions that the Church of Scotland was to prepare for conformity with its southern counterpart. As an enthusiast for the ceremonial and liturgical changes, he preached to his congregation in Edinburgh on Christmas day 1629 with &#145;not only bitter invectives, but curses also, aganis all such as would not keep such holie days&#146;  (Row, 350). In 1632 he was involved in the suspension and deposition of the Scottish presbyterians Robert Blair, John Livingstone, George Dunbar, and Josiah Welsh from office in the Church of Ireland. He also played a conspicuous part in the trial of John Elphinstone, second earl of Balmerino, in 1634 for his opposition to the crown's religious programme.<br>
<br>Maxwell's endeavour to suppress religious dissent was not merely predicated on loyalty to the king, however, but sprang from deeply held doctrinal convictions. Unlike the previous generation of Scottish churchmen Maxwell was a <i>jure divino</i> episcopalian. Preaching in Edinburgh on 22 and 31 July 1631 he sought scriptural justification for this belief, but it earned him a swift rebuttal from the Scottish hierarchy who wanted to distance themselves from an inflammatory and widely discredited doctrine that appeared to repudiate the biblical ideals of the protestant Reformation. Nevertheless his strident attitude and forthright courage gained him the plaudits of the growing constituency of Anglican sacramentalists who found favour with the king.<br>
<br>For his service to crown and church, on 23 April 1633 Maxwell was elevated to the bishopric of Ross and was consecrated in the presence of the king at some date between 15 June and 18 July that same year. He also took part in Charles's Scottish coronation. On 23 June he caused a stir at a service in St Giles attended by the king when he peremptorily dismissed the ordinary reader and replaced him with two English chaplains dressed in full ecclesiastical vestments, who, with the aid of others present, including the bishops, conducted divine worship in accordance with English practice. From as early as October 1634 he is known to have used and promoted the English liturgy in his cathedral at Fortrose in Easter Ross.<br>
<br>Maxwell continued to be rewarded for his stalwart service. On 19 March 1634 he gained an annual pension of &pound;166 while his patrimony was enlarged on 22 October that year by a crown grant of the priory at Beauly in Inverness-shire and on 26 March 1636 by the addition of a number of charges and chaplaincies. His political and social ascendancy was enhanced when he was made a privy councillor and an extraordinary lord of session in December 1633 and a justice of the peace in 1634. Henry Guthry in his <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> pertinently noted that Maxwell was &#145;a man of great parts; but the mischief was, they were accompanied with unbounded ambition&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoirs of Henry Guthry</span>, 16&#150;17). His failure to secure the office of Scottish treasurer that went to John Stewart, the first earl of Traquair, in 1636 was the cause of resentment and future animosity between the pair.<br>
<br>Maxwell's ascendancy in Scotland was, however, cut short by the covenanting revolution of 1637&#150;8. The Glasgow assembly excommunicated him in his absence on 13 December 1638. He signed a declinature against the assembly and in August 1639 was signatory to a protestation that declared the assembly's proceedings unlawful. He had already departed for the safety of the king's court in March 1639 after being interrupted in the course of conducting worship by a party of covenanters who swiftly requisitioned all the offending prayer books before hurling them into the Moray Firth. His wife initially took refuge with the children in the home of her brother Alexander Innes, the minister of Rothiemay, but they left Scotland in August to join Maxwell in England.<br>
<br>From his enforced exile Maxwell emerged as a highly effective polemicist for the royalist and episcopal cause. In 1640, his <span class="italic">Epistle congratulatorie of Lysimachus Nicanor of the Societie of Jesu, to the covenanters of Scotland, wherin is paralleled our sweet harmony and correspondency in divers materiall points of doctrine and practice</span> made his name anathema to the new regime in Scotland. He began by congratulating the covenanters as &#145;most worthy Brethren of the holy League&#146;, rejoicing &#145;in behalfe of our Mother Church of Rome at your begun returne from your former errors and heresies&#146; and taunting them with an ironic expectation that, having &#145;forsaken the former erroneous Doctrine of the Protestants concerning the &#147;Civil Magistrate&#148;, and &hellip; happily joyned with us, you will also betimes abjure all that yet remaineth&#146;  (J. Maxwell, <span class="italic">The Epistle Congratulatorie</span>, 1641, 1). He made no secret of his contempt for and opposition to the political philosophies of John Knox and George Buchanan, readily accepted and promulgated by the covenanters, that had challenged the notion that kings ruled by divine right and were therefore unaccountable to the law of the land and her people. The Scottish parliament declared him an incendiary in July 1641 and proclaimed him guilty of treason in November that same year. However, Maxwell continued to publish on the same themes as before in <span class="italic">Episcopacy not Abjured in his Majesties Realm of Scotland</span> (1641), <span class="italic">An answer to a gentleman who desired of a divine some reasons by which it might appear how inconsistent presbyteriall government is with monarchie</span>, and most notably, <span class="italic">Sacro-sancta regum majestas, or, The Sacred and Royall Prerogative of Christian Kings</span> (1644), a trenchant call for the restoration of royal authority indebted to Jean Bodin. Samuel Rutherford responded to the latter in <span class="italic">Lex rex</span>. Finally in <span class="italic">Burden of Issachar, or, The tyrannical power and practices of the presbyteriall government in Scotland</span> (1646), Maxwell defended Erastian episcopacy.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, Maxwell had continued high in the king's favour. On 12 October 1640 he was appointed bishop of the Irish see of Killala and Achonry by royal patent after the deposition of his fellow Scot, Patrick Adair, for his commitment to the national covenant. Trinity College, Dublin, conferred on Maxwell the title of DD the same year. On the outbreak of the Irish rising in 1641 he was forced to flee for his life from his episcopal residence at Killala. Intercepted at the bridge of Shrule, co. Mayo, he was stripped naked, beaten, and left for dead. Only the intervention of Barnabas O'Brien, sixth earl of Thomond, saved his life. After a short spell in Dublin, Maxwell made his way to the royal court at Oxford where he served as a chaplain to Charles I. On 30 August 1645 he was elevated to the archbishopric of Tuam by letter patent and returned to Ireland to take up his prestigious post. On receiving news that the king had surrendered to the Scottish army on 30 January 1647 he retired to his private chambers, where he was found dead upon his knees at prayer on 14 February. He was interred in Christ Church, Dublin.<br>
