<span class="headword">Gould,  Rupert Thomas</span>  (1890&#150;1948), <span class="occ">horologist and broadcaster</span>, was born on 16 November 1890 at St Edward's Road, Southsea, Hampshire, the second son of William Monk Gould (<i>d</i>. 1923), composer and musician, and Agnes Hilton (<i>d</i>. 1937), daughter of Thomas Skinner, medical doctor of Edinburgh. After a period at Eastman's Royal Naval Academy he was sent as a fifteen-year-old cadet to Britannia Royal Naval College at Dartmouth in 1906, with the intention of providing him with a career in the Royal Navy. The boy's intelligence was quickly apparent and he was top of his class almost throughout his schooling. He seems to have had an almost photographic memory, enabling him to amass considerable learning as a young man; he was especially interested in mechanical things, discovering a fascination for clocks and watches at a very early age. From May 1907 he began service as a midshipman and in the following seven years, during which time he underwent specialist training as a navigation officer, he served, among others, under captains Beatty and Jellicoe in the Mediterranean and home fleets and on the Yangtze (Yangzi) in China.<br>
<br>Although he looked the part&#151;he was strikingly handsome, blond, blue-eyed, and 6 feet 4 inches tall&#151;Gould's nature was actually quite unsuitable for a naval officer. His knowledge caused him to be rather pedantic; although he was generally kindly in demeanour, he was not a team player nor a good leader of men. He was, however, a talented artist, especially in pen and ink, was socially and intellectually assured, and had a ready wit, especially when he had a large audience. In spite of great self-confidence, he was unfortunately prone to violent nervous disorders, usually provoked by the stress of national crises. Thus, at the outbreak of the First World War, Gould suffered a severe mental breakdown and was invalided out of active service. During convalescence in Yorkshire in 1915 he met his future wife, Muriel Hilda (1894&#150;1980), daughter of Thomas and Emily Estall; they were married on 9 June 1917. A son, Cecil, was born in 1918, followed by a daughter, Jocelyne, in 1920. In 1916 Gould had been found a job as one of the assistants to the hydrographer at the Admiralty, receiving promotion to lieutenant-commander in 1919.<br>
<br>In that year Gould decided to devote his spare time to writing a history of the marine chronometer, an essential navigational instrument for which he had developed a fascination during his training. This led him, in 1920, to discover the great marine timekeepers by John Harrison (1693&#150;1776), decaying in the cellars of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, and he vowed one day to restore them to their former glory. In the same year Gould was introduced by his friend the author Ralph Straus to the dining club the Sette of Odd Volumes (founded by the antiquary Bernard Quaritch in 1878) and over the next two decades the printed menus for the Sette often featured Gould's fine caricatures of members. The menus always included a distinguished selection of fine wines, and regular dinners with the Sette, which Gould evidently enjoyed to the full, combined with the stress of late nights writing his book, soon began to tell on the Goulds' marriage.<br>
<br>The year 1923 saw the publication of <span class="italic">The Marine Chronometer</span>, a book so thoroughly researched and well written that it still had no equal seventy-five years later. By this time Gould had sought, and received, permission to restore the Harrison timekeepers and this next Herculean task, to be done in his &#145;spare time&#146;, had already begun at his home in Epsom. Three years later, by which time his wife was finally losing patience with his obsession, Gould's overwork, combined with news of the general strike, precipitated a second nervous breakdown. On his discharge from hospital Gould found, to his dismay, that she had left him. After a vain attempt by Gould's mother (who had recently moved to nearby Ashtead) to reunite them, Muriel petitioned for judicial separation on grounds of cruelty (they were never divorced). She cited as particularly distressing his excessive drinking, certain sexual predilections, and a series of fits associated with his breakdowns, during which she stated that he terrified her. The case, which was heard in 1927 at the High Court in the full glare of the national press, was won by Muriel and Gould lost everything: the custody of the children, his home and, because of the adverse publicity, his job at the Admiralty. He had no option but to go and live with his mother in Ashtead, at Downside, a large house in Woodfield Lane.<br>
<br>Once Gould had recovered from the stress of separation, the following ten years proved to be the most settled and prolific of his life. At Downside, in a specially converted loft workshop, he completed the restoration of all the Harrison timekeepers, during which time he also wrote many articles for the horological and maritime press and compiled extensive notes for a history of the typewriter, an instrument he amassed a very large collection of at Downside. His major publications at this time, however, consisted of a series of books about unsolved scientific mysteries; <span class="italic">Oddities</span> (1928) and <span class="italic">Enigmas</span> (1929) were followed by <span class="italic">The Case for the Sea Serpent</span> (1930). Gould was one of the first people to investigate the Loch Ness monster mystery systematically, and published his work <span class="italic">The Loch Ness Monster and Others</span> in 1934. He had always been interested in the history and the rules of tennis (he was an active player himself, though by all accounts not very sporting), and on many occasions in the 1930s he was engaged to umpire at Wimbledon, often on the centre court.<br>
<br>In 1934 Gould was asked by the programmers for BBC radio to speak every week on <span class="italic">Children's Hour</span> under the name Stargazer, giving a fifteen-minute chat on any subject which he felt might interest the young &#145;listeners in&#146;. His broadcasts, live and (until wartime) without any script, continued, off and on, for over ten years and included at least one early television broadcast from Alexandra Palace. In 1935, as well as writing a fine small biography of Captain Cook, Gould completed his restoration of all the Harrison timekeepers and gave a historic presentation on John Harrison and his timekeepers to the Society for Nautical Research at the Drapers' Hall in London in that year.<br>
<br>Two years later his mother died, and Gould was obliged to sell up and leave Downside, the estate passing directly to his children, with a small income only to Gould. It is probably for this reason that he was remembered by many of his contemporaries as being decidedly mean with money.<br>
<br>In 1937 Gould had tried hard to gain a curatorial position at the newly opened National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, where the Harrison timekeepers were on display, but the scandal of 1927 was not forgotten and he was refused any employment. Until 1939 he lived at the Red House, a residential hotel in Leatherhead, but the looming international crisis pushed him into his last and worst mental breakdown. One of the few things he had inherited was his mother's car, and on the day war broke out in September that year he packed what effects he still had and drove aimlessly west&#151;away from Europe and war&#151;arriving at Shaftesbury before finally collapsing. During a stay in a nursing home there he fell in love with Grace Ingrams, one of the nurses, and moved in with her and her mother in Wiltshire for the duration. During the war, after convalescence, Gould was employed again by the BBC to broadcast as the Stargazer, and, in October 1942, he was invited to join <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/57624', "The Brains Trust")</script>. He was remembered for being the most frequent sparring partner of another <span class="italic">Brains Trust</span> panellist, the well-known philosopher Professor Cyril Joad. Gould was noted for his ability to answer even the most esoteric factual questions with his characteristic eloquence and pungent wit. When the panel was once asked, tongue in cheek, &#145;What is the difference between &#147;fresh air&#148; and &#147;a draught&#148;?&#146; it was Gould who immediately replied: &#145;it's fresh air when you open the railway carriage window yourself and a draught when somebody else does!&#146;<br>
<br>Since the late 1930s Gould had become very overweight and in 1944, probably owing to the vigorous tennis matches he still played, and perhaps also to his lifelong habit of pipe smoking, he suffered a severe heart attack, compounded by the appearance of Parkinson's disease. In 1945 Grace Ingrams and Gould separated. After a hopeless attempt to reunite with his wife which lasted just two weeks, Gould, now an increasingly sick man, went to live with friends at Harbledown near Canterbury. Ironically, at this late stage the National Maritime Museum decided, in 1945, that it would employ Gould as a curator after all, only to find that, within just seven days of having started, he had to resign owing to ill health. Realizing that this truly great horologist was not long for this world, in 1947 Gould's colleagues in the British Horological Institute awarded him their gold medal, the highest honour the institute can bestow. He described it as the crowning moment of his career. He died on 5 October 1948 at the Kent and Canterbury Hospital, Canterbury, of a combination of Parkinsonism and paroxysmal tachycardia. Only his son and a handful of others were at his funeral in Ashtead parish church when he was buried on 11 October, alongside his mother.<br>
<br>Gould's part in the restoration of Harrison's chronometers was dramatized to good effect in Dava Sobel's bestselling book <span class="italic">Longitude</span> (1996) and in its subsequent television adaptation (1999), where he was played by Jeremy Irons.<br>
