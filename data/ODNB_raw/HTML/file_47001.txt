<span class="headword">Horner,  (Norman) Gerald</span>  (1882&#150;1954), <span class="occ">physician and medical editor</span>, was born on 1 January 1882 at High Street, Tonbridge, Kent, the son of Arthur Claypon Horner, medical practitioner, and his wife, Frances, formerly Cundell (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooper). He was normally known by his middle name, Gerald, or as &#145;NG&#146;. His father, who died while he was a child, had served with the Red Cross during the Franco-Prussian War and as medical officer and naturalist on two Arctic expeditions. From 1891 to 1899 Horner was educated at Tonbridge School, where his father held the post of medical officer; he then went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read natural sciences (1899&#150;1902). After graduating with a second-class degree he undertook his medical training, at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London. He also gained his first experience of medical journalism, as assistant editor of the <span class="italic">St Bartholomew's Hospital Journal</span>. He qualified MRCS and LRCP in 1906. In 1910 he graduated MB BCh, from Cambridge. He was awarded the degree of MD in 1922 with a thesis on the history of the general practitioner in England. In his youth Horner was a capable cricketer and an enthusiastic performer of amateur dramatics, in which he excelled as a female impersonator.<br>
<br>In London, after a short spell as house surgeon at Westminster Hospital, Horner returned to St Bartholomew's where, briefly, he was both house physician and editor of its journal. He then combined general practice with clinical assistantships at both St Bartholomew's and Shadwell Children's Hospital in east London. Meanwhile he retained his links with medical journalism, first as a contributor and then as an assistant editor of Sir Henry Burdett's weekly journal for GPs, <span class="italic">The Hospital</span>. On 4 August 1911 Horner married Grace Malleson Fearon (1890/91&#150;1950), daughter of Walter Malleson Fearon, a woman of powerful personality. In the same year he gave up clinical practice to become assistant editor of <span class="italic">The Lancet</span>. One of his first duties was to cover the national health-insurance struggle. In 1915 he left <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> to take up a commission in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC). He attained the rank of captain and for two years served in France, including on the Somme. In 1917 his wife, aware that her husband did not wish to return to <span class="italic">The Lancet</span> on leaving the army, took it upon herself to ask the editor of the <span class="italic">British Medical Journal</span> (<span class="italic">BMJ</span>), Sir Dawson Williams, to arrange her husband's release from the RAMC and appoint him to an assistant editorship. These arrangements having been made, Horner stayed with the <span class="italic">BMJ</span> until his retirement in 1946. He was editor from 1928, though for several years before his departure the journal was effectively run by his successor, Hugh Clegg.<br>
<br>Horner faced several difficulties during his years at the <span class="italic">BMJ</span>. As assistant editor he had to shoulder much of the editorial responsibility for producing it as Williams's health declined. As his own health failed, particularly following the detachment of his right retina in 1940, he carried the substantial burden of having to run the journal under wartime conditions. Moreover he had major difficulty as editor in his inability to escape the conviction that he was unworthy to succeed his mentor, Williams. Nevertheless, under his editorship the <span class="italic">BMJ</span> had its successes. Most significantly it carried many important scientific papers. Horner also oversaw the major design changes of 1936&#150;7, in which a new front cover was introduced featuring a design by Eric Gill and a typeface designed by Stanley Morison. Additionally, the <span class="italic">BMJ</span>'s circulation rose substantially during Horner's editorship, though this had more to do with rising membership of the British Medical Association (the journal was a benefit of membership) than with the journalistic quality.<br>
<br>Overall, however, Horner cannot be counted a successful editor of the <span class="italic">BMJ</span>. His successor observed that he &#145;did nothing except sit there and shift columns&#146;; the journal &#145;wasn't being edited and people were beginning to complain&#146;  (Clegg MSS). Under Horner's direction the <span class="italic">BMJ</span> became staid and unimaginative, and as such it reflected the personality of its editor. Kind and courteous, Horner possessed an understated sense of humour, but he was also extremely diffident, painfully sensitive to criticism, pedantic, indecisive, and wholly undynamic. Shortly after his appointment as editor <span class="italic">The Times</span> suggested that the responsibility of editing the <span class="italic">BMJ</span> was &#145;well-nigh crushing&#146;  (28 Feb 1928). Sadly, Horner was well and truly crushed.<br>
<br>Horner became honorary FRCP in 1939 and FRCS in 1942. Towards the end of the Second World War he began to live at the Savile Club, possibly because he and his wife had separated. He had a keen interest in the history of medicine and was, successively, honorary secretary and vice-president of the Royal Society of Medicine's history of medicine section. Although he wrote very little outside the pages of the journals with which he was editorially connected, in retirement he briefly assisted in the compilation of Sir Arthur MacNulty's official medical history of the Second World War. Following several years of illness, Horner died of broncho-pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, and coronary thrombosis at St Pancras Hospital, London, on 7 March 1954. He was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on 12 March. His only child, a son, survived him.<br>
