<span class="headword">Berkeley, Lady  Henrietta <span class="st"> [Harriett]</span></span>  (<em>b. </em>in or after 1664, <em>d.</em> 1706), <span class="occ">figure of scandal</span>, was a younger daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2209/', "George Berkeley, first earl of Berkeley (1626/7&#150;1698)")</script>, and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1708), daughter of John Massingberd. Little is known of her early life. But in 1682 Lady Henrietta (or Harriett, as she was known in her family) became a well-known figure of scandal when still a minor, and under eighteen, following the revelation of her love affair with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11531/', "Ford Grey, Lord Grey of Warke (bap. 1655, d. 1701)")</script>, the husband of her elder sister Mary. The intrigue seems to have begun in 1681 and continued for about fourteen months before it was discovered by Lady Henrietta's mother. Lady Berkeley forbade Grey from seeing Henrietta, and took her to the family seat at Durdans, near Epsom, where Lady Mary was also staying. However, Grey was invited to Durdans at the instigation of his wife, who was ignorant of the affair; Lady Berkeley, desperate to keep the matter secret from her daughter and husband, agreed to his coming. Grey arrived late one evening in August and stayed several days until his mother-in-law's protests finally succeeded in getting him to leave on 19 August. Later that night Henrietta fled the house, apparently aided by Robert Charnock, Grey's servant, and his wife, Anne.<br>
<br>During the following weeks Lady Henrietta Berkeley lived incognito at a series of lodging houses in London. One week after she absconded lampoons began to appear speculating on the cause of her disappearance. Her family, who wished to send her to a nunnery in France, offered a reward of &pound;200 to anyone who could trace her whereabouts and placed advertisements calling for her return in the London press. Grey admitted to the Berkeleys that he had access to his lover, but refused to let them see her. Eventually the earl of Berkeley launched a lawsuit for unlawful seduction against Grey and his accomplices, which was brought before the court of king's bench on 23 November 1682. Henrietta herself appeared at the trial, but with her evidence the lord chief justice told her, &#145;You have injured your own reputation, and prostituted both your body and your honour, and are not to be believed&#146;  (<span class="italic">State trials</span>, 9.176). As the court was breaking up the earl attempted to take his daughter away with him, whereupon Henrietta announced that she was married to William Turner (Grey's servant). A scuffle broke out in the courtroom as she refused to return home and her father tried to seize her by force. For her own safety she was taken to the king's bench prison, accompanied by Turner, who reportedly lay with her there. After three days she was released. Grey and the other defendants were found guilty but escaped punishment as the matter was compromised early the next year. The trial attracted a great deal of publicity and the story of Lady Henrietta's affair with her brother-in-law became the inspiration for Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">Love Letters between a Nobleman and his Sister</span>, the first part of which was published in 1684. After Grey, a leading whig and supporter of the duke of Monmouth, was implicated in the Rye House plot in June 1683 Lady Henrietta accompanied him into exile in the Netherlands. She travelled with him to Cleves, where it was rumoured that she was pregnant.<br>
<br>The rest of Lady Henrietta Berkeley's life remains a mystery. It is possible that she stayed in the Netherlands or joined Grey at his seat at Uppark, Sussex, on his return to England. Grey, earl of Tankerville from 1695, died in 1701 and in his will settled &pound;200 a year on her. She died at Tonbridge, Kent, on 10 August 1706. By then her affair with Grey was stale news, and in recording her death the annalist Narcissus Luttrell confused her with her niece Elizabeth [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10565/', "Germain, Lady Elizabeth")</script>]. Lady Henrietta left in her will bequests totalling &pound;370, of which &pound;100 was left to her niece Elizabeth Berkeley. Lady Mary survived both her husband and her sister, marrying, in 1712, Richard Rooth of Epsom; she died in May 1719.<br>
