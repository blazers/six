<span class="headword">McArthur,  John</span>  (1755&#150;1840), <span class="occ">seaman and author</span>, details of whose upbringing and parents are unknown, entered the navy in 1778 as assistant clerk on the <i>Eagle</i> on the North American station. On her return McArthur was moved into the cutter <i>Rattlesnake</i>, and on 22 March 1779 was promoted purser for his gallantry in boarding a French privateer in an engagement off Le Havre on 14 March. In November the <i>Rattlesnake</i> assisted the <i>Tartar</i> in capturing the Spanish frigate <i>Santa Margarita</i>, and McArthur was promoted purser of the prize when she was commissioned in the British navy. During the American War of Independence he was often stationed to observe signals, and was confronted with the many defects of the current system. In order to address them he prepared a revised signal book which Admiral Robert Digby issued on 5 October 1782, and which was used experimentally by a small cruiser squadron for three months (MOD, NM/76 and NMM, KE 1/S/9).<br>
<br>McArthur followed these lines of study during the peace, while still purser of the <i>Santa Margarita</i>, and in 1790, according to his own statement, laid a new code of signals before the Admiralty. In his publication of 1782 he had sought to clarify the existing system by which individual flags flown in particular places in the rigging indicated an intention to execute particular tactical movements described in the book of fighting instructions. By contrast this new code employed a system developed by the Chevalier du Pavillon for the French navy, by which a two-flag hoist of flags, flown where they could best be seen, directed the recipient to look in the appropriate line and column of a chart which in turn referred to the fighting instructions. This procedure was a definite improvement on the older system, but it was unnecessarily complicated, and its capacity was more limited than that ultimately adopted by the navy, which used hoists of three numeric flags in conjunction with a numbered signal book. McArthur's system was somewhat incoherent as it had four different code charts with overlapping applications, but the provision he made for changing the meaning of signals for security purposes, while technically unsatisfactory, was ahead of his time.<br>
<br>McArthur's signals caught the attention of Lord Hood, then first sea lord, who, in the Russian armament of 1791, made McArthur his secretary. Hood was eager to try McArthur's signals; but the Admiralty preferred to retain Lord Howe's. McArthur was employed to simplify his system in line with Howe's, but only succeeded in adding to its complexity. However, after approval by Howe, it was tested and used in the experimental cruise of 1792. In 1807 McArthur wrote that &#145;from that period it has been universally adopted in the service, and is, it is believed, continued with little or no variation in form or substance at the present day&#146;. But in this McArthur was certainly wrong, for Sir Home Popham's code had been generally adopted some years before. As early as 1799 McArthur claimed  (in &#145;Thoughts on several plans combining a system of universal signals&#146;, <span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span>, 1.509, 2.70) to be the real author of the code known by the name of Lord Howe; it appears probable, however, that his contribution was reserved to seeing it through the press.<br>
<br>McArthur was again Hood's secretary when the admiral went out as commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean in 1793. He was also appointed purser of the flagship <i>Victory</i>. McArthur's duties at this time were onerous and important. In addition to the ordinary work of secretary, the occupation of Toulon and the intimate association of the Spanish and Italian forces required him to undertake a correspondence in three languages, without, he says, any assistance. He had also acted as Hood's interpreter, and as his representative in the disbursements of public money, both to the British forces and to those of the allies. For some time there was no British commissary-general, a role he also fulfilled. In addition, he was prize agent for the fleet; and though his duties as purser of the <i>Victory</i> were performed by a deputy, the responsibility, pecuniary and otherwise, rested on him. When Hood, after returning to England, was ordered to strike his flag, McArthur went back to the Mediterranean solely as the <i>Victory's</i> purser. As soon as the ship joined the fleet Rear-Admiral Man hoisted his flag on her, and in the action of 14 July 1795 McArthur volunteered to observe the signals. He was afterwards secretary to Sir Hyde Parker (1739&#150;1807), and returned to England with him early in 1796.<br>
<br>In 1803 Lord Nelson offered to take McArthur as his secretary to the Mediterranean. McArthur, however, declined, &#145;as Lord Hood's accounts with the treasury were then pending before the auditors&#146;. This was the official reason, but he was probably more directly influenced by his literary engagements. As a young man McArthur had published <span class="italic">The army and navy gentleman's companion, or, A new and complete treatise on the theory and practice of fencing</span> (1781). In 1792, while secretary to Lord Hood, he brought out <span class="italic">A Treatise of the Principles and Practice of Naval Courts-Martial</span> which, in the second edition, appeared as <span class="italic">Principles and Practice of Naval and Military Courts-Martial</span> (1805); in this form it ran through many editions, and was long the standard work on the subject. McArthur may also have been one of the &#145;Literary and professional men&#146; who assisted with the <span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span> under its first editor, James Stanier Clarke. He certainly collaborated with Clarke in the preparation of a <span class="italic">Life of Lord Nelson</span> which set a new standard in the use of primary sources. This was published in 1809 and was extensively used by later editors of the <span class="italic">Naval Chronicle</span> in the preparation of biographical memorials.<br>
<br>In 1801 McArthur published an octavo volume of <span class="italic">Financial and Political Facts of the Eighteenth Century</span> which, with a change of &#145;century&#146; into &#145;and present centuries&#146;, ran through several editions; he followed this in 1806 with <span class="italic">A translation from the Italian of the Abb&eacute; Cesarotti's historical and critical dissertation respecting the controversy on the authenticity of Ossian's poems</span>, in which he described himself as a member of the committee of the Highland Society of London employed to superintend the publication of Ossian in Gaelic. On 22 July 1806 McArthur received the degree of LLD from the University of Edinburgh. He was at this time living in York Place, Portman Square, London, but afterwards he settled down at Hayfield in Hampshire, where he died on 29 July 1840. He left a widow and, apparently, one daughter, Mrs Conway.<br>
