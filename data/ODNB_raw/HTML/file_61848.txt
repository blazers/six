<span class="headword">MacRae,  Douglas Gordon</span>  (1861&#150;1901), <span class="occ">printer and newspaper editor</span>, was born on 6 April 1861 in Upper Hill Street, Richmond, Surrey, the son of John Gordon MacRae of Fyvie, Aberdeenshire, then a coal merchant, and his wife, Harriette Elizabeth Tolley.<br>
<br>Little is known of MacRae's early years. One obituary mentions that his father was a director of the Richmond Gas Company  (<span class="italic">Financial News</span>); another that MacRae attended Shoreham grammar school, Sussex, before taking up an apprenticeship in the printing trade  (<span class="italic">City Press</span>). While serving his apprenticeship MacRae also took his first steps in journalism, writing notes on cricket and subsequently supplying weekly items to the <span class="italic">Eastern Province Herald</span> and other South African newspapers.<br>
<br>Once qualified, MacRae set up business in Catherine Street, off the Strand, London, where he printed a number of papers owned by Horatio Bottomley's Catherine Street Publishing Association. In 1887, seeking capital to expand the business, Bottomley and MacRae approached H. Osborne O'Hagan, the City financier, who arranged a merger between the Catherine Street Association, MacRae &amp; Co., and Curtice &amp; Co., newspaper publishers and advertising agents. O'Hagan was &#145;much impressed&#146; by MacRae's plan for utilizing the spare capacity of his printing works. The new company quickly justified MacRae's prediction that it would generate a 10 per cent return on O'Hagan's capital  (O'Hagan, 1.265&#150;6).<br>
<br>Bottomley's tendency to overreach ensured that his relationship with MacRae was short-lived. It ended in 1888, when Bottomley formed a new company, the Hansard Union, with a view to taking over MacRae's business and various other printing and publishing firms. MacRae severed his connection with the rogue financier, taking with him the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Draper's Record</span>. &#145;He was a printer and I was a journalist&#146;, Bottomley later recalled, &#145;but he took the papers and left me the printing works&#146;  (Hyman, 30). It proved a wise decision. Bottomley's over-capitalized enterprise crashed within two years, by which time MacRae was ensconced as editor of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> and managing director of Financial Times Ltd.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> had first appeared on 9 January 1888 as the <span class="italic">London Financial Guide</span>, challenging the position established by the <span class="italic">Financial News</span>, founded four years earlier. Bottomley had taken it over when the original owners could not pay their printing bills. MacRae joined the board in June 1888 and quickly secured control. The <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> soon matched the <span class="italic">Financial News</span> in coverage of City affairs but its approach was &#145;cooler and more pragmatic&#146;  (Kynaston, 30). MacRae's most significant editorial decision was to widen its scope by supplying a digest of general news likely to interest &#145;the intelligent business man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>, 2 Jan 1893). Despite this initiative the paper struggled to break even; for a number of years MacRae relied heavily on weekly subsidies from O'Hagan. It was rescued by the boom in South African mining companies after 1895 and the abundance of prospectus advertising which followed.<br>
<br>There is ample evidence of MacRae's drive and energy, not least in the intensity of his rivalry with the <span class="italic">Financial News</span> in the late 1880s. O'Hagan recalled a vindictive side, but the persistence with which MacRae exposed fraudulent enterprises suggests that this could be usefully directed. &#145;Our chief&#146;, noted his paper in its obituary:<blockquote>was a man in a thousand&#151;a man of the finest business faculties, of the most intense energy, of the most indomitable pluck and the most unswerving loyalty towards those who worked with him or who enjoyed the privilege of his friendship. (<span class="italic">Financial Times</span>)</blockquote>Tributes in rival newspapers were equally heartfelt.MacRae lived life to the full, working more hours than were good for him and seeking recreation in hunting, yachting, and billiards. On 11 July 1885 he married Caroline Cecilia Colbourne, the daughter of George Colbourne. They had several children. In the late 1890s his health began to fail on account of a renal disorder. MacRae died while on holiday at Kreuzlingen, near Lake Constance in Switzerland, on 2 April 1901. O'Hagan was glad to sell MacRae's interest in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> &#145;for a very large sum for the benefit of his wife and children&#146;  (O'Hagan, 1.109). He was buried at Norbiton, Surrey, on 10 April 1901. MacRae was survived by his second wife, Florence Lucy Frederica MacRae.<br>
