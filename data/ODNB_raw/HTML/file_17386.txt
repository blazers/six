<span class="headword">McCaul,  Alexander</span>  (1799&#150;1863), <span class="occ">Hebrew scholar and missionary to the Jews</span>, was born of protestant parents in Dublin on 16 May 1799. He was educated at a private school, entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 3 October 1814, graduated BA in 1819, and proceeded MA in 1831; he was created DD in 1837. He was for some time tutor to the earl of Rosse, but becoming interested in the Jews he was sent in 1821 to Poland as a missionary by the London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews. He studied Hebrew and German at Warsaw, and at the close of 1822 went to St Petersburg, where he was received by the tsar, who took some interest in his work. After returning to England he was ordained and served the curacy of Huntley, near Gloucester, where he became friendly with Samuel Roffey Maitland.<br>
<br>In 1823 McCaul married and returned to Poland, where he lived at Warsaw as head of the mission to the Jews and as English chaplain until 1830. He was supported by the Grand Duke Constantine, but had disputes with the Lutheran congregations, and withdrew to Berlin, where he was befriended by Sir Henry Rose, the English ambassador, and by Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia, who had known him at Warsaw. To improve his health he visited Ireland, and returned for a short time to Poland in 1832. He finally decided to settle in London, and took up residence in Palestine Place, Cambridge Road; there he actively supported the London Society and helped to found the Jews' Operatives Converts Institution. In 1837 he began the publication of <span class="italic">Old Paths</span>, a weekly pamphlet on Jewish ritual, which continued for sixty weeks. In 1840 he was appointed principal of the Jewish college founded by the London Society; and in the summer of 1841, through Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia, he was offered the bishopric of Jerusalem, though he declined it because he thought it would be better held by one who had earlier been of the Jewish faith. In the same year McCaul succeeded Michael Solomon Alexander as professor of Hebrew and rabbinical literature at King's College, London; in 1846 he was also elected to a chair of divinity and later he was also professor of ecclesiastical history. He held these three chairs until 1863.<br>
<br>In addition to these offices McCaul in 1843 was appointed rector of St James's, Duke's Place, London; in 1845 he became prebendary of St Paul's, and in 1847 he declined Archbishop Howley's offer of any one of the four new colonial bishoprics. In 1850 he became rector of St Magnus, St Margaret, and St Michael, Fish Street Hill. When the sittings of convocation were revived in 1852, McCaul was elected proctor for the London clergy, and he represented them until his death. At first strongly opposed to the revival of the ancient powers of convocation, he modified his views and worked dogmatically with the high-churchmen, opposing the relaxation of the subscription to the articles, and seconding Archdeacon Denison's motion for the appointment of a committee (of which he was afterwards a member) for the assessment of Bishop Colenso's works on the <span class="roman">Old Testament</span>.<br>
<br>McCaul published many single sermons and pamphlets, and several books, the chief being <span class="italic">A Hebrew Primer</span> (1844), Warburtonian lectures (2 sers., 1846&#150;52), <span class="italic">Rationalism, and the Divine Interpretation of Scripture</span> (1850), a critique of <span class="italic">Essays and Reviews</span>, entitled <span class="italic">Some Notes on the First Chapter of Genesis</span> (1861), and <span class="italic">An Examination of Bishop Colenso's Difficulties with Regard to the Pentateuch</span> (2 vols., 1863&#150;4). McCaul died at his rectory, 39 King William Street, London, on 13 November 1863, and was buried at Ilford, Essex. He left several sons, his wife having apparently predeceased him. His friends donated a stained-glass window in his memory in King's College chapel.<br>
