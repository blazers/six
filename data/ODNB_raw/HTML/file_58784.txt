<span class="headword">Findlater,  Mary Williamina</span>  (1865&#150;1963), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 28 March 1865 at Lochearnhead, Perthshire, the second of the three daughters of Eric John Findlater (<i>d</i>. 1886), a minister of the Free Church of Scotland at Lochearnhead, and his wife, Sarah Borthwick (<i>d</i>. 1907). Her younger sister, <a name="cosubject_58783"></a><span class="headword">Jane Helen Findlater</span>  (1866&#150;1946), <span class="occ">novelist</span>, was born on 4 November 1866 at 14 Claremont Crescent, Edinburgh. As a child, Mary suffered from the isolation and restrictions of life at the remote manse, but took pleasure in Jane's company; the two formed a deep bond which endured, with only rare periods of separation, for eighty years. The sisters were educated at home by governesses. Influenced by the story-telling of relatives, friends, and servants, Mary began writing, in collaboration with Jane, at a young age. When her father died in 1886, Mary moved with her mother and sisters to Prestonpans, near Edinburgh. There Mary and Jane struggled to supplement their family's meagre income with their writing. Mary published her first book, <span class="italic">Songs &amp; Sonnets</span>, in 1895, but it was the publication of Jane's first novel, <span class="italic">The Green Graves of Balgowrie</span>, in 1896 which launched their careers. A popular and critical success, it was praised by readers as various as William Gladstone and Ellen Terry, and it established the Findlater name in literary and intellectual circles.<br>
<br>Between 1897 and 1914 Mary published ten novels, including two written with Jane, and two in collaboration with Jane, Kate Douglas Wiggin, and Allan McAuley, while Jane published short stories and four novels of her own. Popular with British and American readers as well as with the critics, the sisters enjoyed financial security and a growing circle of distinguished friends, including Sir Edward and Lady Grey and the novelist Mary Cholmondeley. They moved to Devon in 1900 for their mother's health. In 1905 Mary and Jane went on a successful publicity tour of the United States, where they formed friendships with Henry James, and William and Alice James, among others. Neither sister ever married. Mary was once engaged for a brief time, but broke it off when she realized that she could not bear to be parted from Jane. Thereafter, the sisters would joke that &#145;<i>we</i> could only marry a Mormon&#146;  (Mackenzie, 24).<br>
<br>Mary's novels are Victorian in their large casts of characters and leisurely paced narratives, but her heroines are surprisingly modern. Unmarried yet reluctant to give in to the demands of the marriage market in either appearance or behaviour (much like Mary herself), they openly criticize the dearth of options available to women who want something out of life other than a husband and children. In <span class="italic">The Rose of Joy</span> (1903) the heroine supports herself as an artist and chooses to live with a female companion rather than marry. In Mary's finest collaboration with Jane, <span class="italic">Crossriggs</span> (1908), female independence again replaces the conventional happy ending of marriage as an inheritance allows the middle-aged heroine to leave behind her life of self-sacrifice to travel the world.<br>
<br>Mary's career effectively ended with the First World War, after which she published only one more novel, a collaboration with Jane entitled <span class="italic">Beneath the Visiting Moon</span> (1923). Although Mary was interested in developments in modern literature, her own novels, with their discursive plots and lack of psychological analysis, had, by the 1920s, fallen out of fashion. In 1923 she underwent surgery for cancer, but recovered to supervise the building of a new home in Rye. The threat of war prompted the sisters to return to Perthshire in 1940.<br>
<br>Strikingly handsome in her youth, with dark eyes and hair, Mary was the more outspoken and emotional of the two sisters, though they were both forthright, gregarious, and intellectually curious. When Jane died of a heart attack on 20 May 1946, in Comrie, Perthshire, Mary was sure her own death would soon follow. But she lived on for seventeen years, alert and happy despite deafness and other infirmities of age. She died on 22 November 1963 at St Fillans, near Comrie.<br>
