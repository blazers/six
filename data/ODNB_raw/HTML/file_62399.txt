<span class="headword">Gorer,  Geoffrey Edgar Solomon</span>  (1905&#150;1985), <span class="occ">anthropologist and author</span>, was born at 45 Netherhall Gardens, Hampstead, London, on 26 March 1905 in London, the eldest of the three sons of Edgar Ezekiel Gorer (1872&#150;1915), a London art dealer of note who died on the <i>Lusitania</i>, and his wife, Rachel Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cohen (1873&#150;1954). The immunologist and geneticist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/33475/', "Peter Alfred Isaac Gorer (1907&#150;1961)")</script> was his younger brother. He was educated at Charterhouse School, spent a year at the Sorbonne (1922&#150;3), graduated in 1927 from Jesus College, Cambridge, with a double first in classics and modern languages, and then passed the following year at the University of Berlin.<br>
<br>As a young man Gorer saw himself as an imaginative writer, but his plays were not staged and he could not find a publisher for his picaresque novel. His first published book, <span class="italic">The Revolutionary Ideas of the Marquis de Sade</span> (1934), enjoyed considerable critical success. Gorer was the first writer outside France to recognize de Sade as more than a purveyor of pornographic filth. The book was also his first attempt to explain modern social phenomena in psychological terms: in this case, the popular vote for the Nazis.<br>
<br>Gorer's travels in the mid-1930s to Africa and the Far East drew him closer to the academic study of cross-cultural variation. On a trip to the USA in 1935 he met Margaret Mead, whose intimate colleague Ruth Benedict was then reviewing his <span class="italic">Africa Dances</span> (1935, repr. 1945, 1949). Over the four months of his stay, Benedict informally instructed him in social anthropology. Mead became a very close friend for the rest of their lives. Though he espoused long-term study of a people, his only intensive fieldwork was a three-month spell among the Lepchas of Sikkim, published as <span class="italic">Himalayan Village</span> (1938). Because of the injuries he sustained when he fell off a rock while in the Himalayas, he was advised, at least for the immediate future, to avoid further fieldwork in non-westernized areas.<br>
<br>Instead Gorer deepened his social and psychological studies into western peoples. In 1939 he went to live in the USA when the humanities division of the Rockefeller Institute invited him to study the impact of radio and film on Americans. Subsequently he worked for the allied authorities on a series of investigations of national character. From his own account, his first such study, &#145;Japanese character structure and propaganda&#146;, produced as a mimeograph, had a &#145;quite fantastic circulation and influence&#146;  (&#145;The Gorer papers&#146;, University of Sussex website). After the war he worked with Benedict and Mead on a series of studies of &#145;cultures at a distance&#146;. His <span class="italic">The Americans</span> (1948) was an analytical summary of opinion-poll surveys about American domestic culture. A year later he collaborated with the psychiatrist John Rickman to produce <span class="italic">The People of Great Russia</span> in which he tried to interpret common Russian attitudes and behaviours in terms of their upbringing.<br>
<br>In 1950 Gorer bought a small manor house and farm in Sussex, where he lived until his death. There he settled down as a freelance social scientist and literary critic, and devoted much time to his garden, winning prizes for his rhododendrons. During these decades he produced several substantial studies of English culture, the result of commissions by national newspapers: <span class="italic">Exploring English Character</span> (1955), <span class="italic">Death, Grief and Mourning in Contemporary Britain</span> (1965), and <span class="italic">Sex and Marriage in England Today</span> (1971). He died at his home, Sunte House, near Haywards Heath, Sussex, on 24 May 1985.<br>
<br>Gorer was considered a gallant man, of broad acquaintance. His friends included W. H. Auden, who dedicated a book of poems to him. His most significant and long-standing friendship, however, was with Margaret Mead. For decades they maintained an intense correspondence and went on annual holidays together, with Gorer organizing everything and vainly trying to show his workaholic companion &#145;how to have a good time&#146;. Though it was often rumoured that the two (he a lifelong bachelor, she bisexual) were to marry, Mead later confided that she could not imagine having to apply medicine to his back.<br>
<br>Gorer himself claimed that his &#145;chief sin&#146; was sloth. He stated that he had not dedicated himself exclusively to social scientific work because of his private income and the easy money he made through journalism. Even though in 1966 his publisher described him as &#145;probably Britain's best known and respected social anthropologist&#146;, his work is little acknowledged today. While contemporary academics are unimpressed by his readiness to produce generalizations for the whole of a complex society, such as the USA, and his persistent enthusiasm for explaining social phenomena by reference to child-rearing practices, his genuinely pioneering social investigations of film, radio, television, and literature, as well as his studies of everyday culture, all deserve recognition as neglected exemplars of cultural studies <i>avant la lettre</i>.<br>
