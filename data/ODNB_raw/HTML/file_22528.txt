<span class="headword">Pope,  Alexander</span>  (1763&#150;1835), <span class="occ">actor and painter</span>, was born in Cork. Both his father and his elder brother, Somerville Stevens Pope, were miniature-painters, and Alexander was trained as an artist under Francis Robert West at the Dublin Art School, and, for a time, under H. D. Hamilton in London. Hamilton's influence is evident in Pope's crayon portraits, the best of which date from the early 1790s. He practised as an artist for a time in Cork, but, after appearing as Norval at a fancy-dress ball and then taking the same part in private theatricals, he turned to the stage for a profession. He had a success in Cork in the title role of a stage adaptation of Aphra Behn's <span class="italic">Oroonoko</span>, which led to his engagement to play the same part at Covent Garden in January 1785. He went on to perform a number of roles that season, including Jaffier in Otway's <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span> and Horatio in Nicholas Rowe's <span class="italic">The Fair Penitent</span>, and Othello for his own benefit. In the same year he began exhibiting at the Royal Academy, a practice he maintained until 1821.<br>
<br>In August 1785 Pope returned to Dublin, where on 9 August he married Elizabeth Younge (1739&times;45&#150;1797) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22530/', "Pope, Elizabeth")</script>], an actress more than twenty years his senior. But his career was to be based in London, where he was favourably received, and where he played the principal tragic parts at both Covent Garden and Drury Lane. He also made occasional appearances in the provinces, especially in Edinburgh, where he first appeared in June 1786 as Othello to the Desdemona of his wife and became a favourite with the audience. He was soon well known for an entire round of parts, chiefly tragic. In Shakespeare alone he played Antonio, Banquo, King Henry in <span class="italic">Richard III</span>, Bassanio, Iachimo, Leontes, Romeo, Hotspur, Wolsey, Richmond, Macduff, Lear, Hamlet, Ford, Posthumus, Tullus Aufidius, the Ghost in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, Henry VIII, Polixenes, Macbeth, Proteus, Antipholus of Syracuse, Antonio, Iago, John of Gaunt, Henry VI, Hubert, Friar Lawrence, and Kent. Except for the Kembles, Pope had at the outset few formidable rivals.<br>
<br>The first original character assigned Pope at Covent Garden seems to have been St Preux in Reynolds's unprinted tragedy <span class="italic">Eloisa</span> (December 1786); the second was Haswell in Elizabeth Inchbald's <span class="italic">Such Things Are</span> (February 1787). At this period he was assigned a wider range of parts than was afterwards allotted him, and he played Lord Morelove in Cibber's <span class="italic">The Careless Husband</span>, Lord Townly in Vanbrugh's <span class="italic">The Provoked Husband</span>, Young Bevil in Steele's <span class="italic">The Conscious Lovers</span>, and Young Mirabel in Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Inconstant</span>. At the end of 1789, on a question of money, he left Covent Garden, to which he returned after an absence of three years. His wife, however, remained there even during his absence. On his return, apart from playing the first Columbus in Morton's <span class="italic">Columbus, or, A World Discovered</span> (December 1792) and Falkland in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span> (May 1793), Pope confined himself principally to serious parts; he made his first attempts at Hamlet and Lear, and played the Earl of Pembroke in George Watson's <span class="italic">England Preserved</span>, the prince of Wales in Pearce's <span class="italic">Windsor Castle</span>, and Mordant in Holcroft's <span class="italic">The Deserted Daughter</span>. In Lent, with John Fawcett, Charles Incledon, and Joseph George Holman, Pope gave readings, accompanied with music, at the Freemasons' Hall. For his benefit the following year he played Sir Giles Overreach, and in January 1797 he was the first Charles in Morton's <span class="italic">A Cure for the Heartache</span>.<br>
<br>On 15 March 1797 Pope's first wife, Elizabeth, died and on 24 January 1798 he married his second wife, the actress Maria Ann Campion (1775&#150;1803) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22532/', "Pope, Maria Ann")</script>], at St George's, Hanover Square. In the meantime he continued at Covent Garden. For his benefit in April 1799 he was Henry in <span class="italic">The Count of Burgundy</span>, translated from Kotzebue by Anna Plumptre, and adapted for the English stage by Pope himself. During this season he was one of the eight actors who published the statement of their case against the management. Pope continued at Covent Garden during the following season, in which he played Hastings in Rowe's <span class="italic">Jane Shore</span> for the first time, and one or two other parts, but was little seen; the next year he transferred his services to Drury Lane, and appeared in January 1802 as Othello; on 2 March he played the first Major Manford in Cumberland's <span class="italic">Lovers' Resolutions</span>. The second Mrs Pope died on 18 June 1803, and in 1804 Pope's son, a midshipman, also died. At the close of the season Pope was dismissed by the Drury Lane management, which had secured the services of the child prodigy Master Betty as tragedian. He had played very little recently, and expressed his intention of retiring and devoting himself to painting. In February 1806, however, he reappeared at Covent Garden as Othello.<br>
<br>Pope married, on 25 June 1807, his third wife, Clara Maria (<i>bap</i>. 1767, <i>d</i>. 1838), a painter, the daughter of Jared Leigh, and the widow of Francis Wheatley RA [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22529/', "Pope, Clara Maria")</script>]. After visiting Ireland, being robbed in Cork, and narrowly escaping shipwreck, he was again seen at Covent Garden, as the original Count Valdestein in Charles Kemble's <span class="italic">The Wanderer</span>, in January 1808. After Covent Garden burnt down he played the original Count Ulric in Reynolds's <span class="italic">The Exile</span> at the Haymarket (November 1808). At the smaller house in the Haymarket, to which the company migrated, he appeared as Pierre in <span class="italic">Venice Preserv'd</span>. Pope was then dismissed from Covent Garden, and for three years was unheard of in London, though he played at times in Edinburgh. He returned to the new house at Drury Lane (28 November 1812) as Lord Townly, and in January 1813 was the original Marquis Valdez in Coleridge's <span class="italic">Remorse</span>. He remained at Drury Lane until his retirement. Among the more notable parts he played were Cardinal Beaufort in <span class="italic">Richard, Duke of York</span>, compiled from the three parts of <span class="italic">Henry VI</span> (December 1817), and Farneze in an alteration of Marlowe's <span class="italic">The Jew of Malta</span> (April 1818). After a short absence, in October 1819 he made what was called his &#145;first appearance for two years&#146;, as Strictland in Benjamin Hoadley's <span class="italic">The Suspicious Husband</span>, and in March 1820 he was Prior Aymer in Soanes's <span class="italic">Hebrew</span>, a version of <span class="italic">Ivanhoe</span>. However, his popularity and his powers had diminished, and he began to be assigned subordinate parts, such as Zapazaw, an Indian, in <span class="italic">Pocahontas</span> (December 1820), Drusus to Macready's Caius Gracchus in Sheridan Knowles's <span class="italic">Caius Gracchus</span> (November 1823), and Lord Burleigh in <span class="italic">Kenilworth</span> (January 1824). In 1824 he also played at the Haymarket, but his last appearance on stage was at Drury Lane, on 21 May 1827, as the original Clotaire in Grattan's <span class="italic">Ben Nazir the Saracen</span>. In 1828 he applied for a pension from the Covent Garden Fund, to which he had contributed for forty-four years, and obtained a grant of &pound;80 a year, which was later raised to &pound;100.<br>
<br>On Thursday 22 March 1835, Pope died at his house in Store Street, Bedford Square. He had been a mainstay of one or other of the patent theatres for many years, and his Othello and Henry VIII were held in his day to be unrivalled. He was strong and well formed, and he had much harmony of feature, but was, in spite of his excellence in pathos, deficient in expression. He possessed a mellow voice and a graceful and easy deportment.<br>
<br>Throughout his life Pope practised miniature-painting, and between 1785 and 1821 he exhibited at the Royal Academy fifty-nine miniatures. Many portraits by him were engraved, including those of Henry Grattan, John Boydell, Henry Tresham, the actor William Lewis, and Anna Crouch. He also engraved a mezzotint plate from a picture by himself, entitled <span class="italic">Look before you Leap</span>.<br>
<br>Pope was a confirmed gourmand, and went so far as to offend people of distinction and influence by his pretensions, such as refusing to sit with Angelica Catalani because she cut a fricandeau with a knife; and ordering expensive luxuries, for which he did not pay, to be sent in to houses to which he was bidden. Many of these stories are probably coloured, if not apocryphal; but there is abundant proof of his gluttonish propensities and supercilious ways.<br>
