<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bird, Sir  Vere Cornwall</span>  (1909&#150;1999), <span class="occ">prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda</span>, was born in St John's, Antigua, probably on 9 December 1909, the son of Theophilus Bird and Amanda Edgehill. He grew up in Garling slum, a swampy area of lower St John's. He always maintained that it was his experiences growing up in this impoverished neighbourhood that led to his lifelong mission to improve the conditions of the poor. His formal education was confined to primary school. At the age of eighteen, he joined the Salvation Army. He became a cadet sergeant while attending its training college in Trinidad and was then stationed in Grenada, where he was promoted to captain. Bird often said that his greatest achievement was becoming an officer in the Salvation Army, and it was there that he learned the skills that he used to great advantage later in life: public speaking, organizing, and negotiating. Bird was tall and charismatic, his speeches laced with biblical references, and he made his reputation giving rousing addresses on the public platform.<br>
<br>Bird returned to Antigua in 1929. He married Lydia Bryant, a Barbudan, in the 1930s. They jointly owned a grocery store while Bird also managed a bakery. Bird had four sons with his wife: Vere (<i>b</i>. 1936), Lester (<i>b</i>. 1938), Ivor (<i>b</i>. 1940), and Roswald (<i>b</i>. 1944). Vere and Lester later trained in Britain as lawyers and became involved in Antiguan politics, while Ivor managed the family-owned Granville Radio (ZDK) and Roswald became an educator. Bird had two other children: Hazel, his first child, an evangelist, and a daughter who was born in his declining years.<br>
<br>Sugar estates had dominated the Antiguan economy since the early eighteenth century, but by the early twentieth century declining world prices and competition from the European sugar beet industry had left the British West Indian colonies in a precarious economic position. By the 1930s trade unions were being formed throughout the Caribbean. In 1938 Sir Walter Citrine, general secretary of the British Trades Union Congress, visited Antigua as a member of the West Indian royal commission (the Moyne commission) and at a public meeting urged Antiguans to create a trade union. As a direct result Antigua's first trade union, the Antigua Trades and Labour Union (AT&amp;LU), was registered in 1939. Bird was elected to the union's executive committee. At its first delegates' convention in 1943 he unseated the union's first president, Reginald St Clair Stevens, in a bruising fight over trade-union tactics. In 1945 he was elected to the island's legislative council, filling a seat left vacant when Stevens died. The following year he was appointed by the governor to a seat on the policy-making executive council in recognition of the trade union's growing role in Antigua's politics. For the next half-century trade unionism and politics dominated Bird's life.<br>
<br>In March 1941, as a result of the signing of the lend-lease agreement, the United States opened a naval air station and army base in Antigua to be a centre of anti-submarine patrols. Bird went to work as a tally clerk at the base and continued to lead the union, which had agreed not to impede sugar exports during the war. After the bases closed in 1945 Bird led the union in a series of strikes against the sugar estates, but it was only after a year-long strike in 1951 that the estates recognized the union and signed a contract. During that strike several sugar cane fields, as well as prominent business places, were set on fire. Bird was charged with incitement and contempt of court for leading public meetings but was found not guilty by a jury, the only time he was ever prosecuted for his union activities.<br>
<br>By the 1950s the British had begun the process of decolonization. One of the first steps was to grant complete adult suffrage in 1951. In successive elections through the 1950s and 1960s Bird headed slates of candidates put up by the AT&amp;LU (under the banner of the Antigua Labour Party, or ALP) that won all the seats. As the British introduced more responsible government, some elected members became government ministers. Bird, as president of the AT&amp;LU, was first appointed chairman of the legislative council, then in 1960 the country's first chief minister, and then, in 1967, with the country given partial self-government (via associated statehood), the first premier. During this period the Bird administration led a series of initiatives that transformed the living conditions of the population: government primary and secondary education was provided for all children, free health clinics were built in the villages, pipe-borne water and electricity supplies were extended, the housing and transportation infrastructure was expanded, and sugar-estate land was allocated to the peasantry for cultivation.<br>
<br>Bird was a strong believer in Caribbean &#145;oneness&#146; and participated in several conferences organized to bring the former British West Indian colonies together. When the attempt to form a West Indies federation failed in 1962, Bird joined with the prime ministers of Barbados and Guyana to found the Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA) in 1965, which in 1973 expanded into the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). Bird was also a founder of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS).<br>
<br>In the late 1960s a group of younger men led by the AT&amp;LU's general secretary, George Walter, challenged Bird's leadership, charging that government ministers who were also union leaders had a conflict of interest because they were in essence negotiating with themselves. In 1967 Walter and his group were dismissed from the AT&amp;LU and immediately formed the Antigua Workers' Union (AWU), which then formed its own political party, the Progressive Labour Movement (PLM). The PLM won the elections of 1971 but in 1976 the ALP, with Bird as leader, was returned to office and Bird resumed the premiership.<br>
<br>When Antigua and Barbuda became independent on 1 November 1981 Bird became the first prime minister of the independent country. In the post-independence period the illegal export of guns to apartheid South Africa, the trans-shipment of guns to the Medellin drug cartel, the harbouring of unsavoury fugitives from the American courts, and repeated allegations of domestic corruption tarnished Bird's reputation. Nevertheless Papa Bird, as he was known, was still revered in Antigua for ending the stranglehold of the plantocracy and for dramatically raising the standard of living of the population. It was not until March 1994 that ill health forced him to retire from politics. The reins of government then passed to his son Lester, at that time deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs.<br>
<br>Bird was a member of a pioneering generation of Caribbean leaders&#151;Norman Manley of Jamaica, Forbes Burnham of Guyana, Sir Grantley Adams of Barbados, and Sir Robert Bradshaw of St Kitts&#151;who used trade-union-affiliated political parties to advance their local economies and to argue for nationhood for the British West Indian colonies. In 1994 he was named Antigua and Barbuda's first national hero. In 1998 he was awarded the order of the Caribbean Community by the heads of government of CARICOM and later the same year received the order of knighthood from the Antiguan government (having reportedly refused a knighthood from the British government). He died in St John's on 28 June 1999. He was honoured with a state funeral at the Antigua Recreation Grounds on 11 July and was buried in the newly created Heroes' Park, in the grounds of the prime minister's residence near St John's.<br>
