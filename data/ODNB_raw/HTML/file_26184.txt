<span class="headword">Spruce,  Richard</span>  (1817&#150;1893), <span class="occ">botanist and traveller</span>, was born on 10 September 1817 at Ganthorpe in Yorkshire, where his father, Richard Spruce, was village schoolmaster. His mother, Ann Etty, was related to the painter William Etty (1787&#150;1849). Spruce began his education at his father's school; little is known of his later studies. Between 1839 and 1844 he was a schoolmaster, teaching mathematics at St Peter's School, York.<br>
<br>Spruce began his botanical collecting in Yorkshire about 1833. He specialized in mosses and liverworts, publishing his first paper, on those of Eskdale, in the <span class="italic">Phytologist</span> in 1841. He subsequently published papers on those of Teesdale (<span class="italic">Annals and Magazine of Natural History</span>, 1844), and of Yorkshire (<span class="italic">Phytologist</span>, vol. 2). A visit to Dr Thomas Glanville Taylor (<i>d</i>. 1848) in Ireland in 1842 confirmed his interest in this group of plants. Spruce came to the attention of Sir William Hooker in 1844 and was recommended for a collecting expedition to the Pyrenees under the sponsorship of George Bentham. In addition to its botanical value, the expedition (1845&#150;6) also served to improve his health. He described the work in three letters published in Hooker's <span class="italic">London Journal of Botany</span>. Two works followed: &#145;Notes on the botany of the Pyrenees&#146; and a more elaborate article, &#145;The musci and hepaticae of the Pyrenees&#146; (<span class="italic">Annals and Magazine of Natural History</span>, 1849).<br>
<br>In 1849 Spruce was sent to South America by Hooker, Bentham, and other botanists; Bentham was to receive, name, and distribute the plants he sent home. Towards the end of the year Spruce travelled up the Amazon to Santar&eacute;m, at the mouth of the Tapajos, where he met the zoologist Alfred Russel Wallace and the lepidopterist Henry Walter Bates. Spruce explored the River Trombetas to a point close to the borders of British Guiana and reached Man&atilde;os, at the mouth of the River Negro, towards the end of 1850. Among his discoveries were a number of plants with medicinal properties, including the datura and coca plants. (It was his samples of the latter, sent to Berlin, which helped Dr Nieman isolate the active principle of the alkaloid cocaine in 1858.) Spruce spent three years on the rivers Negro and Orinoco, entering Venezuela and discovering many plants new to science, including 200 species of fungi in the rain forest of the Uapes. His travels were interrupted in 1852 when he returned to the River Negro to assist Wallace, who had been struck down by malaria, and oversee his safe passage down river.<br>
<br>Spruce returned to Man&atilde;os at the close of 1854, and then ascended the Amazon by steamer to Nantua in Peru, proceeding by canoe to Tarapoto at the eastern foot of the Andes, where he stayed two years and collected, within a 25 mile radius, 250 species of ferns. In 1857 he again descended the Amazon and went up the Pastasa to Ecuador, reaching Banos. Six months later he moved on to Ambato, which he made his headquarters for two years and from where, despite the civil war, he explored the Quintensian Andes. In 1859 he was commissioned by the India Office to collect seeds and young plants of the cinchona, the source of quinine; he managed to obtain 100,000 seeds and 600 plants on the western slope of Chimborazo, which were dispatched to Guayadil. Robert Cross later sent them to India, although the plantations subsequently failed. Spruce's report on this expedition was published in 1861. Spruce remained on the Pacific coast until 1864 to recover his health, but in that year he lost his entire capital in the collapse of a Peruvian bank; he returned to collecting for three years, finally embarking for England in 1867 after an absence of eighteen years.<br>
<br>Spruce's collections included the vocabularies of twenty-one Amazonian languages, hundreds of drawings, and maps of three previously unexplored rivers. His 7000 flowering plant species were catalogued by Bentham, Daniel Oliver, and others; the ferns by Sir William Hooker and John Baker; the mosses by Mitten; the lichens by the Revd William Leighton; and the fungi by the Revd Miles Berkeley. Spruce was awarded a PhD degree by the Imperial German Academy in 1864, was elected a fellow of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh in 1842, and was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.<br>
<br>Spruce, who never married, retired to Coneysthorpe, Yorkshire, in near poverty in spite of a &pound;100 government pension. He spent the remaining twenty-seven years of his life on sorting his collections, forced by ill health to do much of this work lying down. He died at Coneysthorpe on 28 December 1893, and was buried in the churchyard at Terrington nearby. After his death his notebooks were edited by Wallace and published in 1908 as <span class="italic">Notes of a Botanist on the Amazon and Andes</span>. This work best reflects the author's gift for analysis, description, and narrative, along with his dry humour. His name was commemorated by the moss <i>Sprucea</i>, and a liverwort, <i>Sprucella</i>.<br>
