<span class="headword">O'Sullivan,  Mortimer</span>  (1792/3&#150;1859), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, was born at Clonmel, co. Tipperary, the second son of John O'Sullivan, a schoolmaster. He was educated with his elder brother, <a href="#cosubject_20914">Samuel [<i>see below</i>]</a>, and his friend William Phelan at the Clonmel endowed school. The headmaster, Dr Richard Carey, a close friend of John O'Sullivan, was an earnest protestant, while the O'Sullivans were Roman Catholics. Carey was much revered by his pupils, and the realization that Catholic dogma pronounced him a reprobate first led Mortimer to begin the train of thought that led him to Anglicanism. He entered as a protestant scholar at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1813 (having first matriculated in 1811), and proceeded BA in 1816. He took his MA in 1832 and his BD and DD in 1837.<br>
<br>After six or seven years at the university O'Sullivan returned to the south, and became second master of the Tipperary endowed school, and curate of the parish of Tipperary. He was subsequently the first master of the Royal School at Dungannon and also lived in Waterford for a time. He was chaplain of St Stephen's Chapel, Dublin, and on 20 December 1827 was collated to the prebend of St Audoen's in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. This office he resigned on 24 August 1830 on being presented to the rectory of Killyman, co. Armagh, in succession to William Phelan.<br>
<br>As a young man O'Sullivan became interested in the relations between the Catholic and protestant churches in Ireland. In 1824, in reply to Thomas Moore's <span class="italic">Captain Rock</span>, he wrote <span class="italic">Captain Rock Detected</span>. Here O'Sullivan refuted the charges of financial rapacity that Moore levied against the Anglican clergy and attributed the current disturbed state of the south of Ireland to excessive rents, absentee landlords, and the demoralizing influence of the Roman Catholic clergy. O'Sullivan gave evidence before the parliamentary select committee on the state of Ireland in spring 1825 and (with William Phelan) subsequently published <span class="italic">A Digest of Evidence on the State of Ireland in 1824&#150;5</span> (1826). In 1834 he was sent with the Revd Charles Boyton as a deputation to England and Scotland from the Irish clergy to make known the condition of their church. O'Sullivan described with great eloquence and passion the insecurity of the Irish protestant clergy, in Liverpool on 22 November 1834, Exeter Hall, London, on 20 June and 11 July 1835, and also in many provincial towns. On 26 May 1835, when summoned to give evidence before the select committee on Orange lodges, O'Sullivan stated that the Orange societies were of importance in preserving the peace of Ulster. On his return to Ireland in October 1835 he engaged in a controversy with Dr Daniel Murray, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Dublin, who charged him with misreporting his words before the Lords' committee on the circulation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span> among the laity. The correspondence was published. In September 1836 O'Sullivan was again in Glasgow, and on 27 May 1837 a further enthusiastic meeting was held in Exeter Hall. Full reports of all the meetings from mid-1835 onwards, with correspondence, were published by O'Sullivan and the Revd Robert M'Ghee in <span class="italic">Romanism as it Rules in Ireland</span> (1840). In 1851 O'Sullivan was Donellan lecturer at Trinity College, taking as his theme &#145;The hour of the Redeemer&#146;, an examination of the redeeming and atoning work of Christ. O'Sullivan published numerous other sermons, tracts, and contributions to the debate on Roman Catholicism and the state of Ireland. In 1849 he became a prebendary of Armagh and in 1853 was made rector of Tandragee, co. Armagh. During the latter years of his life he resided in Lower Gloucester Street, Dublin, and officiated as chaplain to the earl of Carlisle, the lord lieutenant, and to the duke of Manchester. He died in Dublin on 30 April 1859, and was buried on 3 May in Chapelizod churchyard.<br>

<a name="cosubject_20914"></a><span class="headword">Samuel O'Sullivan</span>  (1790&#150;1851), <span class="occ">Church of Ireland clergyman</span>, elder brother of Mortimer, was born at Clonmel on 13 September 1790, and educated with Mortimer at the Clonmel endowed school. He attended protestant services with his schoolmaster, and was powerfully attracted by the liturgy. When he obtained a scholarship at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1814 (having first matriculated in 1812), he was entered as a member of the Church of England. He graduated BA in 1818, MA in 1825, and BD and DD in 1837. He was an active member of the university historical society, and was awarded the medal for the best speaker in debates. He was ordained in 1818, serving initially as curate of St Catherine's, Dublin, and at the same time chaplain of the Marshalsea, Dublin. In 1827 he succeeded Dean Le Fanu as chaplain to the Royal Hibernian Military School in Phoenix Park, a position he held for the rest of his life. His time was chiefly devoted to literary pursuits. His first work, published in 1816, argued that the course of English history in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries manifestly displayed the agency of divine providence. It greatly impressed his contemporaries. He contributed to <span class="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</span> and to <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>, and wrote extensively for the <span class="italic">Dublin University Magazine</span>. Towards the end of his life, in 1850, he compiled and published a well-received explanation of the catechism of the Anglican church. He died at the Royal Hibernian Military School on 6 August 1851 and was buried on 9 August in the churchyard at Chapelizod, Dublin. His wife, a son, Henry R. M. O'Sullivan, and a daughter, survived him.<br>
