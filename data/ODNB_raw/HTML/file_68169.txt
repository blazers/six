<span class="headword">Welsh <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Dalzell]</span>, Dame  (Ruth) Mary Eldridge</span>  (1896&#150;1986), <span class="occ">director of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force</span>, was born on 2 August 1896 at 22 Slatey Road, Claughton, Birkenhead, one of two children of William Robert Dalzell, a medical practitioner, and his wife, Ruth Mary Frances Annie Elizabeth Goldsworth Kirkpatrick (<i>b</i>. 1872). She attended a local high school, but the First World War precluded attendance at a French finishing school. Instead she went to France in October 1918 as a driver in the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, remaining until June 1919.<br>
<br>On 2 October 1922 she married Squadron Leader William Lawrie Welsh (1891&#150;1962) of the Royal Air Force, and in 1926 her only child, Michael, was born. She travelled widely with her husband's RAF postings, and also gained six years' business experience. When in 1937 her husband was promoted to the Air Council, she joined the Emergency Service, a body, set up in response to the growing German threat, to train women as officers in case of war. The 1938 Munich crisis precipitated the forming of the Auxiliary Territorial Service, for which she volunteered in December 1938. Shortly afterwards she was appointed senior commandant, with thirty-two London companies under her command. Welsh later recalled watching the women &#145;in dusty unromantic drill halls, drilling in high heels and tight skirts &hellip; I really did admire them&#146;  (Welsh, 12).<br>
<br>When war broke out, Mary Welsh transferred in October 1939 to the newly formed Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), initially as squadron officer responsible for recruiting, then as staff officer to a London balloon group. In spring 1940&#151;the eve of the battle of Britain&#151;she became senior WAAF officer to Fighter Command, where her husband described her, at the start, as &#145;looking like a hunted hare&#146;  (Welsh, 14). Nevertheless, by 1942 she was able triumphantly to outface a critic on the Marham committee inquiring into WAAF conditions. The strain of continual travel throughout the country necessitated three months' sick leave. After her husband's knighthood in 1941 she also became sensitive to accusations of nepotism in her career.<br>
<br>Despite her misgivings, Mary Welsh was appointed to the newly created office of inspector-general WAAF, in December 1942. The post took her to commands up and down the country, where she had to break down a wall of suspicion and mistrust. However, being now experienced, conscientious, extremely smart in uniform, having an easy and approachable manner, and with a saving sense of humour, she proved to be very effective. Welsh thus became the natural choice as director of the WAAF, in succession to Air Chief Commandant Katherine Trefusis-Forbes, who was being seconded to special duties overseas. The latter kept her rank as senior officer, which was not achieved by Mary Welsh until August 1944. Nor did Welsh accept the post willingly, refusing it twice before it was finally gazetted on 4 October 1943. By this time she was in her forty-eighth year, tall and slim, with dark eyes and hair, and a husband head of the RAF delegation in Washington, DC.<br>
<br>Plans were already afoot for airwomen to be posted overseas, a move bitterly resisted by the Air Ministry. In January 1944 a tri-service agreement settled shipping, conditions, and accommodation abroad for women. This in turn led to controversy on overseas warm-weather WAAF uniforms. The army could not understand why airwomen objected to wearing khaki, but khaki it became, until autumn 1945, when the director won her case.<br>
<br>&#145;Concern for women serving overseas was very real&#146;, Welsh later wrote  (Beauman, 232); and her duties necessitated frequent inspections of units and stations at home and abroad. She was involved also in discussions about the continuation of women's services after the war, to provide a nucleus of trained women for expansion against future emergencies. As the war drew to a close, the director also had to consider demobilization arrangements for the WAAF, and was to oversee the gradual reduction of a force of 180,339 when she took over to about 32,590 when she left. She turned the new advisory council into a powerful instrument of administration, and gradually strengthened the director's role. The myriad of other matters with which she dealt included a general merging of messing, and sometimes living accommodation, for the WAAF and the RAF, the further extension of the duties of specialist officers and non-commissioned officers into administration and welfare, and the substitution in trades of WAAF for RAF (which was almost 100 per cent in mechanical transport and meteorology).<br>
<br>By late 1946, aged fifty, tiring from the strain, often putting in a seventeen-hour day, and with her marriage falling apart, Mary Welsh asked to be relieved of her post. She was sometimes criticized for preferring the <i>status quo</i> to reform, and being overinfluenced by her staff; but she had seen the WAAF through three momentous years covering the transition from war to peace, and under her the WAAF had settled down and matured. Welsh retired on 30 November 1946, being created a DBE that year. Her marriage was dissolved in October 1947. Later Dame Mary settled in Odiham, Hampshire, where she was secretary of the local British Legion and first president of the Odiham Society; in the latter role she helped to save the pest house, used during the great plague of 1665, from demolition. She died from bronchopneumonia aged eighty-nine on 25 June 1986, at 26 Fleet Road, Cove, Farnborough.<br>
