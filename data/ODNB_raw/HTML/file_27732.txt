<span class="headword">Trevor,  Richard</span>  (1707&#150;1771), <span class="occ">bishop of Durham</span>, was born on 30 September 1707 at Peckham, Surrey, the youngest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27736/', "Thomas Trevor, first Baron Trevor (bap. 1658, d. 1730)")</script>, judge, and his second wife, Anne (<i>d</i>. 1746), the daughter of Colonel Robert Weldon and widow of Sir Robert Bernard. Trevor was educated first at Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire, and then at Westminster School. On 6 July 1724 he entered Queen's College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner; he graduated BA in 1727. In November 1727 he was elected fellow of All Souls, and in 1731 received his MA; he took holy orders in the same year. In 1732 his half-brother Sir John Bernard presented him to the valuable living of Houghton-with-Wilton in Huntingdonshire. He was appointed canon of Christ Church on 8 November 1735, and proceeded DCL in 1736.<br>
<br>Trevor was consecrated bishop of St David's on 1 April 1744, and translated to the see of Durham on 9 November 1752. He owed the former episcopal office to the patronage of the duke of Newcastle, and the latter to Henry Pelham. However, he failed to gain promotion to the primacy when the archbishopric of Canterbury became vacant in 1758; and he was unsuccessful in his attempt to be elected chancellor of Oxford University in 1759, when his two competitors, the earls of Lichfield and Westmorland, combined their votes against him.<br>
<br>Trevor was actively involved in the &#145;improvement&#146; of his two major places of residence: the palace of the bishops of Durham, in which he lived in summer, and the Sussex family estate where, after 1744, he spent the winter months. Thus he is said to have spent &pound;8000 at Bishop Auckland, in order to begin the south front and build a Gothic gateway to the park. As for his other residence, Glynde Place, near Lewes, he not only improved the mansion, but also had the church rebuilt in Georgian style.<br>
<br>Horace Walpole and his correspondents jokingly referred to Trevor as St Durham&#151;a jest aimed at his reputation for saintliness. His record of ecclesiastical patronage in the long Durham episcopate provides evidence of his consistent concern for the high standard expected of clerics to whom he offered preferments. A very benevolent man, Trevor bequeathed &pound;3450 to several public charities and to the poor of the places he had lived in  (TNA: PRO). The full-length portrait in oils that is preserved at Glynde Place conveys the confident image of a prelate of great human stature, though not as &#145;fat-bellied&#146;  (Walpole, 10.257) as Horace Walpole's correspondence suggests. Two of Trevor's five published sermons were in support of the Hanoverian establishment in times of crisis.<br>
<br>Bishop Trevor, who was unmarried, died of gangrene in London on 9 June 1771, and was buried &#145;very privately (according to his own directions)&#146;  (Allan, 24) at Glynde in Sussex on 19 June. A monument by J. Nollekens was erected to him in the chapel at Bishop Auckland in 1775.<br>
