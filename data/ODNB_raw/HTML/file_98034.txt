<span class="headword">Duck,  Ann</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1717, <em>d.</em> 1744), <span class="occ">criminal</span>, was baptized on 22 July 1717 in Cheam, Surrey. Her father, John Duck, was a black man and her mother, Ann Brough, was white; they married on 12 August 1717 in St Clement Danes, Westminster. John Duck was also the father of an illegitimate daughter, conceived early in 1716 when he was visiting London with his master, Edward Green, of Nonsuch Park, near Cheam. He appears to have left service about the time of his marriage, to become a teacher of sword fighting to the gentlemen of the inns of court. The family lived in Little White's Alley off Chancery Lane, where they had at least two other children, Elizabeth and Mary.<br>
<br>Until the death of her father, around 1740, Ann's behaviour was unexceptionable; she learned to read, write, and do accounts. She may have worked for a while as a shop assistant but then became a servant in a bawdy house and joined the Black Boy Alley Crew, a notorious gang of criminals in Clerkenwell, north of the City of London. In June 1742 she was committed to Newgate prison for assaulting and robbing a man, although no proceedings resulted from the incident. By her own account, she had already spent time in various gaols, including Wood Street, the Poultry Compter, the New prison, and the Clerkenwell Bridewell, all minor prisons used for those sentenced in the lower courts for such lesser crimes as soliciting.<br>
<br>Ann Duck's first appearance at the Old Bailey was on 14 January 1743 for assault and theft from a waggoner; she was acquitted. On 29 June 1743 she made her second appearance in the same place for theft and was again acquitted. In these and further alleged crimes she worked with one or more other women, sometimes enticing a man into a house, plying him with drink and then, when he was befuddled, robbing him. At least two of these subsequent victims did not bring charges and a third did not turn up at the Old Bailey, probably for fear of reprisals, so Duck was yet again acquitted. The crimes she and her associates committed increased in violence, however, and at least one man died in the course of a robbery, although Duck and her two friends were not apprehended and she never confessed to this. The last of her thefts occurred on 21 September 1744. Three days later Duck was one of a mob who viciously attacked and left for dead the headborough of Clerkenwell, sent to the gang's headquarters to arrest a number of them. Duck was charged with both these crimes. On 17 October 1744 she was tried at the Old Bailey, first for the assault on the headborough, for which she was acquitted, and then for the theft. Including appearances in the lower courts, it was, according to the <span class="italic">Daily Gazetteer</span>, the nineteenth time she had been brought to trial. She was sentenced to death. In Newgate she made a confession to the ordinary and, despite a petition to the king from a cousin, was hanged at Tyburn on 7 November 1744.<br>
<br>Ann Duck's life shows that black people were an unremarkable part of the population of London during the eighteenth century and that there was no apparent prejudice against them in the courts. Her colour was mentioned by witnesses only incidentally as a way of identifying her. One witness thought Duck was the proprietor of a drinking house, for which an official licence was needed. A gentlewoman who saw a victim struggling with Duck assumed they were married and that what she was witnessing was a domestic dispute. She was neither surprised nor shocked to see such a relationship, which, as Duck's parents' marriage also suggests, was relatively commonplace.<br>
