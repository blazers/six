<span class="headword">Brown,  Maud Frances  Forrester-</span>  (1885&#150;1970), <span class="occ">orthopaedic surgeon</span>, was born at Wyverndern, The Ridgeway, Enfield, Middlesex, on 15 November 1885, the daughter of James Samuel Brown, civil engineer, and his wife, Emma Laetitia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Tomkins. No evidence of siblings has been traced. After spending some of her childhood in India (where her father was consulting engineer to the government of Bombay), she attended Bedford high school from March 1898 for eight years, where her headmistress described her as a most brilliant and well-balanced scholar. On application for a place at the London School of Medicine for Women, with clinical training at the Royal Free Hospital, she gave her name as M. Forrester Brown. The source of the additional name Forrester is not known, nor why she later introduced a hyphen, to adopt the surname Forrester-Brown permanently. Placed first out of five candidates at an entrance examination, she was awarded a school scholarship and started basic science studies in late 1906. The school's records confirm excellent examination results as a student and she received the London MB BS in 1912, with honours in pathology and in forensic medicine. Postgraduate courses followed in London and Newcastle on Tyne. A Gilchrist studentship from London University enabled her to study in Berlin, including operative gynaecology, and after obstetric experience she gained the MD (London) in 1914 in gynaecology. She held junior hospital posts as far apart as Dundee and London, including that of house surgeon to Sir Harold Stiles at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.<br>
<br>In 1916 Forrester-Brown's senior residency in Sheffield was cut short and her subsequent career shaped by an invitation from Stiles to join him as orthopaedic resident at the Edinburgh War Hospital, Bangour, to investigate peripheral nerve lesions due to missile wounds. This resulted in several communications and, in 1920, an MS (London) for a dissertation entitled &#145;The results of operations for peripheral nerve injury&#146;. In 1921 she and Stiles published <span class="italic">The Treatment of Injuries of the Peripheral Spinal Nerves</span>, of which she wrote two-thirds and for which she drew all the illustrations of operative techniques. Clearly inspired by this experience, she became orthopaedic surgeon to Fairmuir Specialist School, Dundee, and visited Sir Robert Jones in Liverpool and G. R. Girdlestone in Oxford, who were establishing orthopaedic centres throughout England and Wales. This may have promoted the award of a William Gibson research scholarship in 1923, enabling her to visit orthopaedic surgeons in the United States, Italy, France, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and many in Britain, and doubtless determined her subsequent appointment as resident surgeon of the newly established Children's Orthopaedic Hospital, Bath, in 1925, of which Jones and Girdlestone were honorary consultants.<br>
<br>Nominated visiting surgeon to childrens' clinics, Forrester-Brown worked prodigiously and by 1926 was attending some eleven clinics in Somerset and Wiltshire. At the hospital 51 operations were performed in 1924, the number increasing to 237 in 1927, the vast majority by Forrester-Brown. The addition of Dorset added another five clinics, which she was said to visit on horseback for what was termed &#145;her out-week&#146;. Soon the Bath and Wessex Orthopaedic Hospital gained many more beds, including twenty in a babies' ward with a pool which she dedicated to Jones, who had died in 1933. She was joined by another surgeon in 1935, who took over Wiltshire, and they visited some twenty-one clinics periodically. With the initiation of the National Health Service in 1948 she was termed consultant orthopaedic surgeon and was joined by two further surgeons. She retired in December 1950.<br>
<br>In 1929 Forrester-Brown published <span class="italic">Diagnosis and Treatment of Deformities in Infancy and Childhood</span>, a guide and a plea for general practitioners and school medical officers to refer deformities as soon after birth as possible. With R. G. Gordon, a neurologist, she wrote <span class="italic">Paralysis in Children</span> (1933), an erudite and detailed work, and in 1935 she described her remarkable experience of 152 cases of club foot. To congenital problems and poliomyelitis was added the care of joint tuberculosis, rickets, and nerve lesions; she had no remit for acute trauma. An active attender of conferences at home and abroad, she was in 1921 the first female member of the British Orthopaedic Association, later its secretary and an emeritus fellow; she was also an emeritus member of the International Society for Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery and the Medical Women's International Association.<br>
<br>After her move to Bath, Forrester-Brown lived at 22 Combe Park, opposite the hospital where she would often arrive on horseback; she had consulting rooms in the Circus, Bath. After retirement to Edinburgh she undertook locum work, including as surgeon to the Holy Cross Hospital, East Pondoland, Transkei. Despite active horse-riding, swimming, skiing, and golf, she sustained four episodes of fracture suggesting underlying osteoporosis, although she died after a cerebro-vascular accident, at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 12 January 1970. She never married.<br>
