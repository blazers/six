<span class="headword">Oldisworth,  Nicholas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1611, <em>d.</em> 1645), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and poet</span>, was born at the home of his grandfather Sir Nicholas Overbury in Bourton on the Hill, Gloucestershire, and baptized in the parish church on 14 July 1611, the elder son of Robert Oldisworth of Coln Rogers, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Merial, sister of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20966/', "Sir Thomas Overbury")</script>.<br>
<br>Oldisworth was educated at Westminster School under the headship of Lambert Osbaldeston, who encouraged his verse writing. While at Westminster he developed a close friendship with Richard Bacon, who proceeded as a king's scholar to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1628 but left after a year for training at Douai. Oldisworth kept up his contact with his friend, addressing many poems to him and to his siblings; he was deeply affected by Bacon's death from the plague in 1636.<br>
<br>From Westminster Oldisworth moved, as a king's scholar, to Christ Church, Oxford, in July 1628. He matriculated on 24 February 1632, in time to take his BA on 24 April and to be incorporated at Cambridge University. His MA followed in 1635, by which time he had already been presented with the living at Bourton on the Hill by his grandfather.<br>
<br>Most if not all of Oldisworth's more than 120 poems were written while he was at Christ Church. Only two were published in his lifetime, in university commemorative volumes in 1633: <span class="italic">Solis Britannici Perigaeum</span> and <span class="italic">Vitis Carolinae gemma altera</span>. A poem to Ben Jonson, paying tribute to his influence, appeared in <span class="italic">Wit Restor'd</span> (1658), an anthology by Sir John Mennes. Few of the poems display the brittle wittiness valued by Oldisworth's contemporaries but, with an often engaging awkwardness, the collection as a whole evinces an unexpected sensitivity to personal, domestic, and familial relationships.<br>
<br>The fate of Sir Thomas Overbury appears to have haunted the family; Oldisworth himself gathered material relating to the trial of his uncle's murderers. He records reading the manuscript to his aged grandfather, Sir Nicholas Overbury, on 9 October 1637 and includes the old man's comments. Oldisworth also kept a manuscript fair copy of his moderately Laudian sermons  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Eng. th. f. 20). Because he used sermons more than once he meticulously recorded when and where he preached them.<br>
<br>Oldisworth married in 1640. He and his wife, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1684), had three daughters: Mary (<i>bap</i>. 6 Jan 1641), Frances (<i>bap</i>. 11 June 1642, <i>bur</i>. 28 Nov 1643), and Margaret (<i>bap</i>. 8 Feb 1644). Mary married a Londoner, and became Mistress Sherwood; Margaret married John Mann of Tewkesbury.<br>
<br>As a moderate royalist Oldisworth expressed his bewilderment at the course of public events and their effects on people's lives. During the plague of 1644 and 1645 he appears to have moved his family to Willington in Warwickshire, near Shipston-on-Stour and about 11 miles from Bourton on the Hill. He occupied himself with preparing a manuscript fair copy of his poems, entitled &#145;A Recollection of Certain Scattered Poems&#146;, for presentation to his wife; the dedicatory epistle is dated 24 February 1645. (The volume&#151;Bodl. Oxf., MS Don. c. 24&#151;was inherited by his daughter Margaret, who used it to record recipes.)<br>
<br>Oldisworth continued with his pastoral duties, preaching perhaps for the last time in Burmington, Warwickshire, on 16 March 1645. He died at Willington, of the plague, on 25 March 1645 and was buried the next day in the chancel of the nearby church at Barcheston. The church having been refurbished, there is now no trace of his grave. His death is recorded in Barcheston parish register and, more fulsomely, by his brother, Giles, in Bourton on the Hill parish register.<br>
