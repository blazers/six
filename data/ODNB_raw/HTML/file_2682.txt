<span class="headword">Blount,  Charles</span>, fifth Baron Mountjoy  (1516&#150;1544), <span class="occ">courtier and patron of learning</span>, was the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2702/', "William Blount, fourth Baron Mountjoy (c.1478&#150;1534)")</script>, and his third wife, Alice Brown, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Kebel 
    (or Keble; <i>d</i>. 1521)
  . Charles was born on 28 June 1516 in Tournai, where his father was governor, and after William was recalled in 1517 to resume his role as chamberlain to Katherine of Aragon, his son was in due time made a page in her household. Charles's education was based on the most rigorous humanist standards and his tutors were remarkable for their learning. In 1522 Jan van der Cruyce, a graduate of the university at Louvain and a friend of Erasmus, travelled to England to become private tutor to Mountjoy's children. He remained in the household until 1527, when he returned to Louvain and was appointed a professor of Greek. Possibly on the recommendation of Erasmus, van der Cruyce was succeeded by Petrus Vulcanius of Bruges, also a graduate of Louvain, who remained in England until 1531. In 1531 Erasmus praised Charles Blount for his fine written style, but after Vulcanius's departure realized that the credit should have gone to the preceptor rather than the student. John Palsgrave, who composed <span class="italic">L'esclarcissement de la langue francoyse</span> (printed in 1530 and dedicated to Henry VIII) and was tutor to Henry Fitzroy, also gave tuition to the sons of several court noblemen, Charles Blount among them. One of his fellow schoolmates in this group was Thomas Howard, son of the second duke of Norfolk, whose own tutor at Lambeth had been John Leland. Leland in turn praised Charles's skill in Latin and presented a book along with commendatory verses to him. In 1523 Juan Luis Vives wrote a short educational treatise dedicated to Charles, <span class="italic">De ratione studii puerilis ad Carolum Montioium Guilielmi filium</span>. This served as a parallel to the tract on female education Vives had composed in the same year for the benefit of Mary Tudor. Erasmus added Charles's name to that of his father in the dedication to the 1528 edition of the <span class="italic">Adagia</span> and Charles was the dedicatee of the next two editions (1533, 1536) as well. Erasmus also dedicated his 1531 edition of Livy to him.<br>
<br>About August 1530 Charles Blount married Anne, daughter of Robert, second Baron Willoughby de Broke. Her mother was Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Grey, fourth marquess of Dorset, who had become the fourth wife of Charles's father. Succeeding to the title after his father's death in 1534, Mountjoy was regular in his attendance in the House of Lords. In May 1537 he was one of the peers summoned for the trial of lords Darcy and Hussey and he was also on the panel of 3 December 1538 for the trial of Henry Pole, Lord Montague, and Henry Courtenay, marquess of Exeter, his own brother-in-law. His country house was at Apethorpe, Northamptonshire, and in London he lived in Silver Street.<br>
<br>After the dissolution of Syon Abbey in 1539 Mountjoy granted asylum at his London house to the pious, learned, and outspokenly conservative priest Richard Whitford, who had been patronized by his father. Whitford remained in the household until his death in 1542 and may have acted as tutor to Mountjoy's children. Like his father, Mountjoy was deeply interested in the humanist educational programme and he tried to engage the learned scholar and educationist Roger Ascham, then teaching at Cambridge, as a tutor to his eldest son and secretary to himself. Although Ascham did not take the position&#151;and he also refused a similar offer from Margaret Roper&#151;he admired Mountjoy and referred in flattering terms to his learning, likening his household for its patronage of learning to that of the Medici. Mountjoy left 40 marks in his will to provide lectures for the children of Westbury under the Plain, Wiltshire, for the succeeding two years.<br>
<br>Mountjoy drew up his will on 30 April 1544, just before embarking for France with the expeditionary force. In it he admonished his children to &#145;kepe themselfes worthye of so moche honour as to be called hereafter to dye for ther maister and countrey&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/30, fol. 343). He also composed his own epitaph in English verse. Present with Henry VIII at the siege of Boulogne he died on 10 October of that year at Hooke, Dorset (formerly the home of his mother), probably from illness contracted on campaign. In his will he reckoned his assets, in money, goods, and debts owed to him, at nearly &pound;2100. He was buried at St Mary Aldermary, London. His widow remarried and lived until 1582.<br>
<br>Mountjoy's heir was his eldest son, <a name="cosubject_53018"></a><span class="headword">James Blount</span>, sixth Baron Mountjoy  (1532/3&#150;1581)<span class="occ"></span>, who was made a knight of the Bath in 1553 at the coronation of Queen Mary. On 26 May 1559 he became lord lieutenant of Dorset and he was a JP for Dorset and Wiltshire in 1562 and 1564. On 10 February 1564 he was admitted to Gray's Inn. In 1572 he took part in the treason trial of Thomas Howard, fourth duke of Norfolk. He married Catherine, daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh, and their sons William and Charles succeeded in turn to the title. In the dedicatory epistle to his <span class="italic">Lyues of M. Luther, J. Ecolampadius &amp; H. Zuinglius</span> (1561) Henry Bennet situated Mountjoy within the tradition of good letters followed by his father and grandfather. Bennet also claimed that James had a zeal towards good religion and in the same year Jean Veron dedicated his antipapal tract <span class="italic">The Ouer Throw of the Iustification of Workes</span> to him. Apparently Mountjoy dabbled in alchemical studies and according to Sir Robert Naunton's <span class="italic">Fragmenta regalia</span>, written about 1630, he spent the family fortunes in pursuit of the philosopher's stone. He was also a shareholder in the Company of Mines Royal, and in his attempt to find a formula for the production of alum and copperas he fell badly into debt and was forced to mortgage several properties. He patronized a company of players from at least 1558 to 1578; they toured predominantly in the south-west. Mountjoy died on 20 October 1581 at Hooke, Dorset. He had two younger brothers, Francis and William, the former of whom later became a friend of John Dee.<br>
