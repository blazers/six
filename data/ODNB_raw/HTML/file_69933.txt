<span class="headword">Maclean,  Patrick</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1538&#150;1565), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop-elect of the Isles</span>, was the illegitimate son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76540/', "Lachlan Cattanach Maclean (c.1465&#150;1523)")</script> and an unidentified Katherine Hay. Several times referred to as &#145;brother germane to Lord Maclane&#146;  (<span class="italic">LP Henry VIII</span>, 20/2, no. 4), that is, to Hector Maclean of Duart, he owed his influence to his relationship to that formidable chief. Nothing is known of his early life, but as he is invariably described as Master Patrick he was evidently a university graduate. He may have been the &#145;Dom Patrick Mauchlyne, chaplain&#146; who received &pound;5 from the revenues of Haddington in 1531, and for several years thereafter  (<span class="italic">Exchequer Rolls 1529&#150;1536</span>, 59), but his first certain appearance in the records comes in 1538, when he accounted at the exchequer for crown revenues from the Isles received by his brother. By 1545 he was bailie of Iona and justice clerk of the South Isles.<br>
<br>In 1544 Donald Dubh, the last MacDonald lord of the Isles, escaped from prison and fled to his homeland. The islanders under Duart's leadership rose in revolt, at a time when Henry VIII was making strenuous efforts, abetted by the fourth earl of Lennox, to force the Scots to break their alliance with France and marry their infant queen Mary to Prince Edward of England. In a politically confused situation Donald saw advantage in an alliance with Lennox and England, and employed Patrick Maclean as one of his agents. In March 1545, having already been with Lennox, Maclean proceeded to Westminster, from where the privy council soon sent him back to Donald with promises of money. The result was that on 28 July, &#145;with the advice of his barons and council of the Isles&#146; (among whom Duart was named first), Donald made Maclean one of his commissioners to negotiate an alliance with the English king. An essential component in any agreement was Donald's ability to raise fighting men in Ireland, and to expedite this Maclean visited Dublin in mid-August, but was back at Westminster by the 23rd. On 5 September the privy council reported that articles had been agreed whereby the English would pay the wages of 3000 of Donald's men and assist him with a further 2000 men under the command of the ninth earl of Ormond.<br>
<br>Donald Dubh died at the end of 1545 and the uprising collapsed. It has been argued that it was also betrayed by Duart, who was certainly in favour with the pro-French Scottish party later in 1546. Patrick Maclean was in Ireland in February 1546, endeavouring to revive the islemen's alliance with England, but he too subsequently made his peace with the Scottish government, for on 7 August, following the death of Bishop Farquhar MacEachan, he received &#145;the temporalite of all landis &hellip; quhilkis [were] pertinentis of the bischoprik of the Iles and abbacy of Colmkill&#146;  (<span class="italic">Registrum secreti sigilli</span>, 3, no. 2367).<br>
<br>For nearly twenty years there was confusion in the sequence of bishops of the Isles. Maclean was not without rivals, and, indeed, neither then nor later was he formally made bishop, but was styled only bishop-elect. He seems to have claimed papal provision, but in 1551 one Roderick Maclean began an action to deprive Patrick of the abbey of Iona, perhaps all he actually held, and a year later the lords of council ordered him to hand the abbey over, on the grounds that he had failed to demonstrate his provision. Roderick Maclean was dead by 26 November 1553, to be succeeded by Alexander Gordon, but again without confirmation. One John Campbell was referred to as bishop-elect in 1560, but Patrick Maclean once more obtained crown nomination to the see, and on 22 April 1562 Gordon resigned to him his rights in Iona. Maclean's second tenure of Iona and the Isles was short-lived, however. On 12 January 1565, still only &#145;elect of the Iles&#146;, he acknowledged &#145;the impotence of his awne bodie&#146; and resigned all his rights to John Carswell, an active reformer supported by the fifth earl of Argyll. Carswell promised him &#145;ane yeirlie pensioun for his intertenement&#146;  (<span class="italic">Registrum secreti sigilli</span>, 5, no. 1885). No further reference to Maclean survives, and he probably died soon afterwards.<br>
