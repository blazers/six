<span class="headword">MacLeod,  Roderick</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1595), <span class="occ">highland chief</span>, was the son of Malcolm MacLeod of Lewis (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1528) and his wife, Christine Urquhart of Cromarty. His family, which owned Assynt and Coigeach on the Scottish mainland together with the island of Lewis, had been closely connected with the lords of the isles, and when Donald Dubh MacDonald, the last of that line, escaped from prison in 1501 it was to Torquil MacLeod of Lewis, his uncle by marriage, that he turned for help. For his part in Donald's rising Torquil's lands were forfeited to the crown in 1506, but five years later they were returned to his brother Malcolm. Having succeeded his father, Roderick continued the family tradition of support for MacDonald claimants to the lordship of the isles in 1539 and again in 1545. Summoned for treason he failed to appear, and in 1554&#150;5 the fourth earl of Argyll besieged Stornoway Castle. Although it withstood Argyll's artillery, Roderick submitted and was pardoned.<br>
<br>Roderick MacLeod carried on feuds with many of his neighbours, but most of his later life was overshadowed by turmoil within his own family. He was married three times, to Janet Mackenzie, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/76545/', "John Mackenzie")</script> of Kintail [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70945/', "Mackenzie family of Kintail")</script>], to Barbara Stewart of Avondale in 1541, and to Janet Maclean of Duart. When a son, Torquil, was born to Janet Mackenzie, Roderick claimed that he was the child of Hugh Morrison, breve of Lewis, and divorced her. Torquil was brought up by his mother's people in Strathconon and was consequently known as Torquil Cononach. With Barbara Stewart, Roderick had another son, Torquil Oighre (the Heir), who, however, was drowned about 1563. Some ten years later Roderick married Janet Maclean and they had two sons, Torquil Dubh and Tormod. He also had five acknowledged illegitimate sons.<br>
<br>The death of Torquil Oighre saw the start of the long and complicated tale of the &#145;ewill trowbles of the Lewes&#146;  (Macphail, 265). Roderick MacLeod had appeared to accept Torquil Cononach as his heir, but went back on this in favour of Donald Gormson MacDonald of Sleat, whose father had married a daughter of Roderick's brother Torquil. Torquil Cononach captured his father and held him prisoner for three years. On his release Roderick complained to the privy council of his &#145;evill handiling captivite feir of my life perell of hunger and cauld and manifest compulsione&#146;  (ibid., 282). On his release he made his third marriage and had his two younger sons. In 1576 Torquil Cononach again captured his father at Stornoway together with the family charters, and handed the latter over to his uncle Mackenzie of Kintail for safe keeping. Meanwhile the five illegitimate sons divided, with Donald, Rory Og, and Neil supporting their father, and Tormod and Murdoch backing Torquil Cononach. During the ensuing turmoil the latter's eldest son was killed by Rory Og, while Donald killed Tormod but was himself captured and beheaded by Torquil Cononach, who never lost the support of his Mackenzie relatives with their considerable influence at court.<br>
<br>Roderick MacLeod died in 1595, in nominal possession of Lewis and with the young Torquil Dubh as his heir. In August 1596, however, Torquil Cononach received a royal charter for the lands and barony of Lewis and the lands of the mainland, and after the death from fever of his second son he named Kenneth Mackenzie of Kintail as his heir. A year later Torquil Dubh invaded Coigeach but was captured and killed by Torquil Cononach, while Kintail abducted the dead man's brother Tormod from school in the lowlands and held him prisoner for several years. After his release Tormod saved the life of Torquil Cononach when the latter was captured by John MacHutcheon MacLeod of Sanday. In 1605 Torquil's daughter and heir, Margaret, married Roderick or Rory, the brother of Kintail, who gave him a charter for Coigeach while reserving a life-rent for Roderick's father-in-law. Torquil Cononach was dead by 1609, when Roderick was granted a crown charter for the lands.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_69920"></a><span class="headword">Neil MacLeod</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1613)<span class="occ"></span>, who in the meantime had gained control of Lewis and of Torquil Dubh's three young sons, proved to be by far the most effective of Roderick's sons. However, he was now to be involved in a struggle of a different kind. In 1598 James VI formed a plan to &#145;civilize&#146; Lewis and contracted with ten Fife gentlemen, calling themselves the Fife Adventurers, to establish a fishing colony at Stornoway &#145;for the public good and the king's profit&#146;  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 1592&#150;9, 463). This was greeted with alarm by many in the highlands, and Neil led the initial opposition in Lewis. At first he was supported by his brother Murdoch, but later they fell out, and Neil handed his brother over to the Adventurers, one of whose leaders Murdoch had captured, and he was hanged at St Andrews in 1599. During the next six years the settlers were harassed by Neil MacLeod, who had the covert support of Mackenzie of Kintail, even though the latter was ostensibly backing the royal experiment. In 1605 Neil took Stornoway Castle. Two years later Mackenzie was given a royal charter to recapture it and to help the settlers generally, but he managed to warn Neil of the arrival of a supply ship for them, which Neil took.<br>
<br>Finally, in 1610, after he had been made a peer for his good service in Lewis, Mackenzie was instructed to allow Neil to negotiate, a process apparently forwarded when Neil by treachery seized and handed over an English pirate ship. But MacLeod's opposition to the Adventurers was reinvigorated when Mackenzie died in February 1611. In spite of having by now lost most of the island of Lewis he withdrew with his &#145;infamous byke of lawles and insolent lymmaris [ruffians]&#146; to the rock of Berisay, at the mouth of Loch Roag in the west of Lewis, and there turned to piracy  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 1610&#150;13, 3). They eventually surrendered to Roderick Mackenzie after a threat to drown their women and children, and Neil was executed in Edinburgh on 13 March 1613; he was reported to have died &#145;verie christianlie&#146;  (Mackenzie, 258).<br>
<br>Neil MacLeod left two sons, Donald and Rory Dubh, who were released in 1613 on the promise of good behaviour but returned to Lewis to make trouble; Rory was killed there while Donald was captured and banished to England, from where he went to Holland. The three sons of Torquil Dubh also all disappear from the record around 1613, while his brother Tormod was exiled. Neil's brother Rory Og, who died after escaping from Duart Castle, left three sons, of whom William and Rory were executed as rebels while Malcolm, after years of piracy, died in Ireland. Thus ended a line which was subsequently described as &#145;the stoutest prettiest men, but a bloody wicked crew whom neither law nor reason could guide or moddell, destroying one another till in the end they were all expelled of that country&#146;  (Mackay, 265). The heir male of the family was MacLeod of Raasay, but the lands of Lewis, Assynt, and Coigeach were inherited, after so much &#145;ewill trowble&#146;, by the Mackenzie descendants of Torquil Cononach's daughter.<br>
