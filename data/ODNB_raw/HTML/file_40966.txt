<span class="headword">Lavino,  William Edward</span>  (1846&#150;1908), <span class="occ">journalist</span>, was born on 10 March 1846 at Lower Broughton, Lancashire, the son of Joseph George Lavino (<i>b</i>. 1810), a Dutch protestant businessman naturalized as a British subject in 1850, and Elizabeth Matilda Lavino (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Reiss). Lavino was educated in England before being sent, aged fifteen, to study civil engineering in Hanover. About 1861 his parents moved to Paris; Lavino later joined them and spent two years at the &Eacute;cole Sup&eacute;rieure du Commerce. He was engaged in commerce in Antwerp between about 1865 and 1867, before becoming secretary to Bertrand Fourquet, a Parisian merchant commissioned to supply material for the modernizing efforts of the Ecuadorian dictator, General Gabriel Garcia Moreno (1821&#150;1875). Lavino soon became private secretary to General Francisco Javier Salazar (1824&#150;1891), the Ecuadorian minister to France, and held the post until 1874, when Salazar left Paris.<br>
<br>In 1874 he was offered the post of secretary to the San Salvador legation but Lavino's career lay not in South American diplomacy but in assisting the formation of European opinion, especially in the troublesome arena of Anglo-French relations. His cosmopolitanism, intelligence, tact, and sensitivity gained the widest possible scope for their exhibition in journalism. He began with a scoop for the <span class="italic">New York Herald</span> when he persuaded the exiled Marshal Bazaine to publish a self-justification for the paper. He then became editor of the London-based <span class="italic">Continental Herald</span>, before his career began in earnest as assistant to the Paris correspondent of the <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span> in 1874. In 1878 he moved to Vienna as that paper's representative, a position he held until 1892 when he was appointed, on Lord Rosebery's recommendation, to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Over the next sixteen years he garnered increasing recognition as one of the paper's most influential correspondents. Since he was positioned at the diplomatic crossroads of Europe, Lavino's letters and columns reveal both an absorption in contemporary crises, and a growing fear of the international issues of the future, notably the future of Anglo-German relations.<br>
<br>In 1903 Lavino replaced Henri de Blowitz as Paris correspondent for <span class="italic">The Times</span>. As early as 1896 Lavino had written of the need for a <i>rapprochement</i> with France, and he is best known for his association with the Anglo-French <i>entente cordiale</i> of 1904. There seems little reason to accept uncritically the judgement of contemporaries that Lavino was of primary importance in sealing the <i>rapprochement</i>. However, inasmuch as good personal relations between British and French politicians were crucial corollaries of the entente, Lavino's close contacts with Th&eacute;ophile Delcass&eacute; and Eug&egrave;ne &Eacute;tienne, his dispatches and the avowedly diplomatic agenda which informed&#151;if it did not propel&#151;his journalism, must have influenced public and private <i>rapprochements</i>. Over the years he developed a strong belief in the deep-rootedness of German antipathy to Britain, its inexorable evolution into hostile action, and the concomitant need for the security of an equally innovative Anglo-Russian agreement to supplement the entente. This assessment of the European diplomatic situation was shared by Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace, and Valentine Chirol at Printing House Square. It formed an agenda that was given a great deal of publicity, and which was difficult for politicians to avoid. The influence of <span class="italic">The Times</span> on diplomacy before the First World War, if difficult to locate precisely, can never be ignored, and Lavino was one of its vital correspondents.<br>
<br>Lavino was, for his contemporaries, a solitary figure. He never married, and in both Vienna and Paris he forsook society for the diplomatic world. He died suddenly at 7 rue de la Chaise, Paris, on 4 August 1908, from complications arising from diabetes and an operation for a strangulated hernia; he was buried in Poissy.<br>
