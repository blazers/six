<span class="headword">Philips,  Humphrey</span>  (1632/3&#150;1707), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, was born in Somerton, Somerset. According to one account he was &#145;of a genteel family&#146; and &#145;inclined to the ministry from his youth&#146;  (Palmer, 1.472). Philips matriculated at Wadham College, Oxford, on 14 November 1650 and was elected a scholar in July 1651, aged eighteen. He graduated BA in 1654 and proceeded MA in 1656, with the latter degree incorporated at Cambridge in 1657. He was elected a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1656 but was ejected from the post in 1660.<br>
<br>Ordained at the age of twenty-four, Philips had been a chaplain and tutor to the family of John Bampfield of Poltimore, near Exeter. Following ejection from his fellowship he moved to Sherborne, Dorset, where he became curate to Francis Bampfield, whom Calamy notes he had already assisted in 1658. Both Philips and Bampfield were ejected in 1662, and for preaching they were held in an inn with twenty-five people and bound over for good behaviour until the next quarter sessions, an event described in <span class="italic">A brief narration of the imprisonment of Mr Francis Bampfield &hellip; with Mr Phillips (his assistant)</span> (1662). On the imprisonment of Francis Bampfield in Dorchester gaol Philips became chaplain to Thomas Bampfield at Dunkerton, Somerset, with whom he was incarcerated in Ilchester gaol for eleven months. Appearing at Wells assizes he experienced &#145;hard usage; being put into a chamber, like Noah's Ark, full of all sorts of creatures, and laid in a bed with the Bridewell-keeper, where the sheets were wet, and clung to his flesh&#146;  (Palmer, 1.473).<br>
<br>On his release Philips travelled to the Netherlands in the company of the son of Colonel Strode MP and visited Leiden and other university cities, where he discussed theology with Dr Gisbert Voet, last survivor of the 1618 Synod of Dort. Following his return to England he went back to Dunkerton, where he discovered that the Bampfields had become sabbatarian Baptists. He preached there &#145;with good success&#146;  (Palmer, 1.473) as well as at a number of other parishes in Somerset, and also at Warminster in Wiltshire. He was heavily fined for his Presbyterian beliefs and &#145;had much trouble from the bishop's court, which drove him from his home to Bristol, London, and other places for several years&#146; until the indulgence of 1672  (ibid., 1.474). Philips returned to Sherborne where he was licensed in June 1672 as a Presbyterian preacher, at the home of Cath[erine?] Chase, but was &#145;forced away&#146;  (ibid.). In the following September he was licensed at his own home in Priston, Somerset, which was also a meeting-place. He is next recorded as living on his estate at Beckington, Somerset, and continued to preach at Frome where he &#145;[brought] forth fruit in old age&#146;, and at Simonsbath and Englishcombe, Somerset  (ibid.).<br>
<br>Philips's literary output was small and he is thought to have written only two funeral sermons, one for a Mr Ivyleaf, and the other for Mrs Anne Gibbs. He was married three times: first in 1665 to Dorothy (<i>d</i>. 1667), daughter of John Collins of Priston; then in 1672 to Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1675), daughter of John Rosewell of Englishcombe; and finally, in 1679, to Anna, daughter of Sam[uel?] Millard of Shaftesbury. He had a number of children, among them at least one son, Samuel, and four daughters. He died on 27 March 1707 and was buried at Beckington, Somerset, where his funeral sermon was preached by his son-in-law, the Presbyterian John England, husband of his daughter Mary.<br>
