<span class="headword">Bulmer,  (George Henry) Bertram</span>  (1902&#150;1993), <span class="occ">cider manufacturer and business entrepreneur</span>, was born on 30 August 1902 at Fair Oaks Cottage, Kings Acre Road, Hereford, the eldest of the three sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46791/', "Edward Frederick Bulmer (1865&#150;1941)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38979/', "Bulmer, Henry Percival")</script>] and his wife, Sophie, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Rittner (1874?&#150;1968), who was of German parentage but was born in Liverpool. Educated at Bedales School, Shrewsbury School, and King's College, Cambridge, he obtained a master's degree in modern languages before joining his father's family firm. H. P. Bulmer had been founded in Hereford in 1887 with a loan from Bertram's clergyman grandfather, the Revd C. H. Bulmer. Beginning as a small family organization, Bulmer's was for many years the largest employer in Hereford.<br>
<br>Fluent in both German and French, young Bulmer worked in every department of the firm and strongly believed that such experience was vital to understanding the nature of business. Appointed a director in 1924, he went to Normandy and Brittany to purchase apples at a time of company expansion. On 29 July 1933 he married, in King's College chapel, Christine Mary Frederica Laughton (1912&#150;2000), who had been born in San Francisco. Then, with the repeal of prohibition, Bulmer went across to the United States to sell to Americans the concept of cider drinking. Company policy was to buy up small troubled cider factories, and in 1937 a 50 per cent interest was acquired in Bulmer, Magner &amp; Co., along with W. Magner's extensive cider fruit orchards in the vicinity of Clonmel, co. Tipperary. During the Second World War Bulmer preferred to remain a sergeant in the Home Guard, unwilling to leave the ranks but enjoying the occasional romps inseparable from army life near to home. In the 1940s he served as a Liberal member of the Hereford rural district council, and in his younger days he had chaired the Hereford co-operative housing venture. Holidays were spent often in the company of Bancroft Clark, of the well-known firm of shoe manufacturers C. &amp; J. Clark, of Street, in Somerset, or rough shooting and fly fishing for trout.<br>
<br>A profitable sideline was initiated with the establishment of a plant in Hereford to make pectin preservative for jam-setting from waste apple pomace, which until then had been dumped or sold to the pectin producers of the day. In the ongoing quest for citrus peel to improve the quality of the firm's pectin base, the 1960s saw production companies set up in Ghana (since the 1940s a supplier of this peel) and Australia, the latter for cider brandy.<br>
<br>A director for sixty-three years, Bulmer succeeded his cousin Howard Bulmer as chairman from 1966 to 1973, when he handed over the chairmanship to the first non-family member, although he stayed on as a non-executive director until 1987. In 1970 he steered the company through a heady period of expansion leading up to stock-market flotation. He is best remembered, however, for reviving the art of apple brandy distillation&#151;something not attempted in England for at least two centuries. Brussels was not amused, and thereupon a spirited fight was waged against European bureaucracy on methods of distillation and hostility to the notion of British brandy. In retirement Bulmer was in robust form, battling with the obfuscation and entrenched prejudice that tried to confine the term brandy to grape distillation. Eventually he won the right to be the first man in England since 1763 to be granted a customs and excise licence to distil apple brandy, using a Heath Robinson contraption of copper drum and curling pipes discovered in Normandy, to produce King Offa Cider Brandy. The queen and the prince of Wales conferred royal patronage on his cider and donated oaks from royal estates to make the maturation casks, and her majesty was rewarded with the first bottle of legitimate apple brandy at the firm's centenary in 1987. Bulmer held the queen's warrant for cider supply for many years and became a freeman of the city of Hereford. When buyers began to take the word &#145;offa(er)&#146; too literally, the brand label was changed to Hereford Cider Brandy, although King Offa is still made available at the Cider Museum.<br>
<br>In retirement, Bulmer oversaw the Bulmer cider festival, and, after some years of planning, in 1973 he founded the Hereford Cider Museum Trust; the museum opened in 1981. Aged seventy, he opened the road race at the festivities of 1973 on a penny-farthing bicycle which he had learned to ride for the occasion. As was remarked at the time, there was no shortage of his own brew to steady the nerves. Such activity probably surprised and delighted the majority of the workforce, Bulmer's image being a microcosm of the paternal, punctilious employer of yesteryear, demanding respect, loyalty, and reliability in return for caring, compassionate, and structured stewardship of employees' livelihoods. Bulmer was honoured with the presidency of the National Association of Cider Makers and was life president of the European Cider Markets Association. He valued highly his election to membership of the Worshipful Company of Distillers and the French Calvados Connoisseurs' Association. Bulmer died at his home, Little Breinton, Breinton, Herefordshire, on 5 January 1993, survived by his widow, four sons, and a daughter. He was cremated. Christine Bulmer died on 30 September 2000 and was buried at Credenhill church, where many Bulmers lie.<br>
