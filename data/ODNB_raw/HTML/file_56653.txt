<span class="headword">Bateman <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Harker]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1768&#150;1809), <span class="occ">thief and poisoner</span>, was born in Asenby, Yorkshire, the daughter of a small farmer named Harker. She evidently received a good education for one of her class, and could read and write proficiently. At the age of thirteen her father sent her into service in Thirsk. Seven years later she removed to York, where she learned the rudiments of dressmaking, and it was here that her life of crime began in earnest. After only one year she had to flee to Leeds after being caught in the act of robbery. During the next four years she worked as a mantua maker, and began to practise as a wise woman, telling fortunes and pretending to remove spells. In 1792 she married a wheelwright named John Bateman.<br>
<br>Although her magical activities undoubtedly brought in a healthy income, Bateman displayed what may have been a pathological need to steal. She was, moreover, none too discreet in the manner of her robberies. Caught several times by lodgers and neighbours, she seems to have avoided prosecution by buying off her victims. There is no evidence that John Bateman was an accomplice in his wife's various frauds and thefts. Indeed in 1796 he was apparently motivated by shame to join the army, bringing Mary with him. They returned to Leeds within a year, however, and Mary resumed her criminal career.<br>
<br>In 1806 Bateman hit upon a new scam that brought her to the attention of a wider public. Encouraged by the local popularity of the millenarian prophet Joanna Southcott, she joined and attended meetings of the Southcottians, a group of people she presumably saw as possible victims for her magical frauds. To seal her reputation among them, and also to exploit them, she publicly claimed that one of her hens had laid three miraculous eggs bearing the inscription &#145;Christ is coming&#146;. Hundreds came to see these unusual vehicles of divine communication, with visitors having to pay a penny each to satisfy their curiosity.<br>
<br>Considering her lack of discretion and tendency to take her frauds too far, it was perhaps inevitable that Bateman would eventually find herself before a criminal court. That day came in October 1808 after a Leeds clothier named William Perigo accused her of murdering his wife, Rebecca, by poisoning. Mrs Perigo had consulted Bateman about a pain she felt in her breast, and was informed that she was suffering from the effects of an &#145;evil wish&#146;. Bateman commenced to extract large sums of money from the couple under the pretence of effecting a cure.<br>
<br>Bateman was tried at the York assizes in March 1809, and found guilty of murder and fraud. She was hanged at noon on Monday 20 March. Her body was taken to Leeds General Infirmary for dissection, but, with an opportunism worthy of the woman herself, the infirmary publicly exhibited her corpse, charging 3<i>d</i>. per person and thereby raised more than &pound;30.<br>
