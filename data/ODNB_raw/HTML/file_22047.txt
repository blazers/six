<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Petre, Sir  William</span>  (1505/6&#150;1572), <span class="occ">administrator</span>, was the son of John Petre, a prosperous cattle farmer and tanner whose family had long been settled at Tor Newton in Torbryan, Devon. John had married Alice, daughter of John Colling of the neighbouring parish of Woodland. Both families occupied that intermediate station between yeomanry and gentility then known as that of franklin. William may have been the eldest son, though his brother John (<i>d</i>. 1568) inherited the main family property; another brother, also John, became customer of Dartmouth and Exeter, and sat for Dartmouth in the parliament of November 1554; the youngest brothers, Richard and Robert, became respectively archdeacon of Buckingham and an auditor of the exchequer.<h2>
<a name="Beginningacareer"></a>Beginning a career</h2>Petre entered Oxford as a law student in 1519. He has been claimed for Exeter College, of which he was later a considerable benefactor, but there is no evidence of his undergraduate membership, which would have been irregular in a college restricted to arts students. He was admitted fellow of All Souls in 1523, retaining this place until 1535 and serving as law bursar in 1528/9. He graduated bachelor in both laws on 2 July 1526, and during 1527 and 1528 he practised in the Oxford chancellor's court. He is believed to have been made tutor to Sir Thomas Boleyn's son George (brother of Anne). Through this connection, supposedly, he came to Henry VIII's notice, and was one of the junior counsel representing the king in his matrimonial suit before the legatine court at Blackfriars (May&#150;July 1529). Petre played no active part in these proceedings, and his presence is deduced only from the imprecise recollection of Cavendish in his life of Wolsey.<br>
<br>On 19 January 1530 Petre advanced his Oxford career by becoming principal of Peckwater Inn, a position he vacated by February 1534. On 17 February 1533 he incepted DCL. It is difficult to see how an alleged residence of several years abroad, chiefly in France, in the service of Boleyn father or son, can be accommodated in these years. Possibly Petre attended George Boleyn (now Viscount Rochford) on a mission to France between October 1529 and February 1530. If Petre spent further time overseas, he must have returned by the start of 1533; on 8 March he was admitted to Doctors' Commons, and in the course of the year began work as a chancery clerk. About this time he married Gertrude, daughter of John Tyrrell of Little Warley, Essex.<br>
<br>During the summer of 1535 Petre submitted proposals for the reorganization of ecclesiastical jurisdiction under the crown, and from October he presided over Cromwell's vice-gerential court. On 2 November Cranmer recommended him for the deanery of arches (&#145;no man so meet&#146;; <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Writings</span>, 315); this particular appointment eluded him, but on 13 January 1536 Cromwell made Petre his deputy in probate and other matters. In this capacity, though still a very junior official, he controversially presided at a session of convocation in June. Perhaps feeling that his status would be enhanced by an ecclesiastical dignity, Petre accepted a canonry of Lincoln Cathedral, with the prebend of Langford Ecclesia, to which he was installed by proxy on 11 December. The presentation was in the crown's gift by the attainder of the previous incumbent; Petre resigned by the following April. More importantly he had in 1536 been promoted to a mastership in chancery, and as such was on 25 November appointed to scrutinize papal bulls in the light of recent legislation. He may also have entered parliament this year as MP for Downton, Wiltshire, though the only evidence is an inconclusive scrap in Cromwell's hand.<br>
<br>Between 1535 and 1540 Petre was principally occupied with the visitation and dissolution of religious houses, tasks he performed with efficiency and fairness, avoiding the unsavoury reputation of his fellow commissioners. Nevertheless he used his position to amass a substantial landholding, mainly in his native Devon and in Essex. By 1540 he had a rent-roll in excess of &pound;500. Like others he secured favourable leases from houses on the point of surrender, including (May 1538) that of the manor of Gyng Abbess, Essex, from Barking Abbey. On 15 December 1539, following the abbey's dissolution, he received a grant of the property from the crown. Here he built his seat, Ingatestone Hall, which his heirs still occupy.<h2>
<a name="Senioradministrator"></a>Senior administrator</h2>During 1540 Petre first showed that adroitness in high politics which marked his career thereafter. He had been deputed to travel to Cleves to negotiate Henry VIII's marriage to the duke's daughter Anne, but he escaped this responsibility and so emerged from the resultant fiasco untainted by too close an association with Cromwell's failed scheme. On the minister's fall no new vicar-general was appointed, and Petre's deputyship necessarily lapsed. But on 5 October he was sworn of the king's council and appointed to preside over the conciliar court of White Hall.<br>
<br>Petre's wife died on 28 May 1541. By the following March he had married Anne, daughter of John Tyrrell of Heron (of another branch of the Essex gentry family from which Petre's first wife had come). She was the widow of William Browne of Flambard's Hall, and brought a healthy portion of &pound;280 per annum.<br>
<br>During 1543&#150;4 Petre deputized for Sir Ralph Sadler as keeper of the seal of the duchy of Lancaster. On 21 January 1544 he was appointed one of the principal secretaries (of state) in succession to Sir Thomas Wriothesley and as junior to Sir William Paget; at the same time he acquired a knighthood, membership of the privy council, and an <i>ex officio</i> seat in the House of Lords. By this year also he sat on the Essex bench; he would be appointed to numerous other local commissions. When in the summer of 1545 Henry VIII went to campaign in France, Petre was one of the queen regent's small advisory council, and (because the king took Paget with him) he was for the first time in charge of the national bureaucracy. From April to July 1545 he was one of five ambassadors sent to discuss commercial affairs at the imperial diet of Bourbourg. In September 1546 he paid a brief visit to France in an attempt to persuade the French to honour an ancient debt. He was unsuccessful, but this in itself cannot explain why Henry VIII excluded him from the regency council which he designed for his son's minority. Petre was appointed only to the outer group of assistant executors, and was the only one of the whole body of executors who did not receive a personal legacy from the king.<h2>
<a name="Royalsecretary"></a>Royal secretary</h2>Notwithstanding this apparent disappointment, Petre and Paget were reappointed secretaries on 13 February 1547, Edward VI's coronation day, but for the moment Paget, as a privy councillor, was markedly the senior partner. Not until 18 March, when Somerset had expanded the privy council, did Petre regain a place there. However, on 29 June he was promoted to the comptrollership; he was then sole secretary until April 1548, and remained senior secretary until retirement in 1557. The secretaryship was his life's work; to it he brought a sharp mind and an easy command of paperwork; his handwriting, though not particularly neat, has a fluency which demonstrates the confidence with which he handled the multifarious duties of his office. Unsurprisingly he found little time for his position of <i>custos rotulorum</i> for Essex, also acquired in 1547, and he rarely sat as JP for the county. On 18 August 1547 he was made keeper of the <i>ad causas</i> seal which authenticated the crown's ecclesiastical jurisdiction. On 9 October he was awarded a &pound;200 &#145;bequest&#146; from the late king (in reality compensation for the legacy he had been denied).<br>
<br>If Petre found Somerset's administration increasingly arbitrary he did not (as Paget did) make his feelings known. He developed a rapport with William Cecil, whose function as Somerset's secretary to some extent undercut the principal secretaries' work. Petre played a key part in the events leading to the end of the protectorate. He was with Somerset and the king at Hampton Court on 5 October 1549 when the protector, alarmed by the opposition of councillors left in London, appealed for military assistance. On the next day Petre was sent to London to parley with the councillors there. When he had not returned by nightfall, Somerset hustled the king away to Windsor. He supposed that Petre had been detained against his will; in fact he had been won over, and he drafted much of the correspondence which then flowed from opposition headquarters at Ely House, including the separate letters of 10 October to Somerset and to the latter's colleagues, the one conciliatory and the other disclosing the conspirators' true purpose. This manoeuvre succeeded in forcing Somerset's peaceful capitulation; when he was removed to the Tower, Petre composed the new government's official explanation. His role in the affair is not enlightened by any personal account, and he has been much criticized for it. Hayward, writing at the end of the century, said that &#145;under pretence of gravity [he] covered much untrustinesse of heart&#146;  (Hayward, 108). Subsequent better understanding of the ineptness of Somerset's regime makes it easier to condone Petre's defection.<br>
<br>In the succeeding administration Petre was (20 October 1549) given the further office of treasurer of first fruits and tenths, which he held until 25 January 1553. From January to May 1550 he was among the commissioners who negotiated the return of Boulogne to the French. During this mission Petre was said to have been described by Gaspard de Coligny as &#145;the man who said nothing&#146; by whom the French were denied an additional 200,000 crowns in compensation  (Emmison, <span class="italic">Tudor Secretary</span>, 88). The report is not contemporary, but it has fixed Petre with a reputation for shrewd silence, though it may be that his hesitancy in French contributed to this impression. In the remaining years of Edward VI's reign Petre served on taxation and chantry commissions for Essex, and in 1551 he was named a governor of Chelmsford grammar school. As the king was introduced into affairs of state, Petre assisted his political education; among Edward's surviving papers is a scheme in the king's hand for improving the privy council's routine, which was revised by Petre for submission to the council on 15 January 1553. The appointment of Cheke as a third principal secretary on 2 June was thought to signal Petre's imminent removal. But, although he was later reported by Cecil to have had misgivings, he remained senior secretary and, though excluded from part of the deliberations, drafted some of the documents by which the succession was altered in favour of Lady Guildford Dudley. He was one of those who swore allegiance to her as Queen Jane on 9 July, three days after Edward's death. He and Cecil were sent to explain matters to the imperial ambassadors on the 10th. By 19 July the coup had collapsed, and Petre was among the councillors in London who changed sides and proclaimed Mary. On 30 July he was received by the queen at New Hall in Essex, and admitted to her council. The queen spent the night of 31 July at Ingatestone; there, if not before, Petre was reappointed secretary. Lady Petre's presence in the new queen's household may have assisted his re-engagement, but Mary was in no position to form a government from her own affinity, and Petre was among those of her brother's councillors she would have employed anyway.<br>
<br>Petre at once busied himself with the varied business the accession involved, and was soon rewarded with honours and service. With effect from 29 September he became chancellor of the Order of the Garter (though never a knight companion), charged with restoring religious elements in the statutes which Edward had personally expunged. On 1 January 1554 Petre was among the commissioners appointed to negotiate the queen's marriage to the prince of Spain. He was active in suppressing the disorders which the marriage provoked, and was among those who interrogated Princess Elizabeth over her alleged involvement in Wyatt's rising. When Philip arrived Petre was naturally in attendance, and received an annuity appropriate to his rank. After the king's departure in 1555, he became one of a group of &#145;select&#146; councillors on whom Philip relied for information, and through whom he channelled his directives for his English realm. Petre drafted most of this body's reports, and so played a pivotal role in the Tudor&#150;Habsburg monarchy. Meanwhile the English ambassador in France, Nicholas Wotton, frequently wrote dispatches to Petre alone, confident in his ability to digest news and present it to the government as a whole.<h2>
<a name="Parliamentaryservices"></a>Parliamentary services</h2>Petre may have wanted to retire as early as September 1554, but in November that year Paget had told the emperor that he should not be allowed to do so because &#145;he had been there so long that he was as good as a council register&#146;  (<span class="italic">CSP Spain</span>, <i>1554&#150;8</i>, 89). No doubt this was meant as a compliment, though it could have seemed patronizing from one who had moved on from the secretaryship to higher office and a peerage. Petre was in fact by no means chained to his desk, but was also active in parliament. He sat as a member for Essex in every assembly from 1547 to 1563&#151;which gave him a seat in the Commons as well as his <i>ex officio</i> place in the Lords. During Edward's reign he was employed on at least seven Commons' committees, and in the more frequent sessions of Mary's parliaments he came to be something like the modern leader of the house. Two months before the meeting of April 1554 he was among those deputed to plan the legislative programme and to appoint drafters of bills. In the first Marian parliament he had carried up two bills to the Lords, and in that of April 1554 he did so six times. In the crucial parliament of November 1554, when the reconciliation deal with Rome was hammered out, Petre was the chief mediator between legislature and legate; as Christmas approached he was almost daily on the river, plying the diplomatic shuttle between Westminster and Lambeth. He also had to introduce the new <span class="roman">Treasons Bill</span> in the Commons when the government's original proposals were thrown out by the Lords. In the 1555 parliament he was again busy on the floor of the house and in committee. In the final Marian parliament (1558) he was on the committee to examine the revived sanctuary claims of Westminster Abbey&#151;an awkward by-product of the restoration of Catholicism.<br>
<br>Petre was probably sympathetic to the reunion with Rome; back in 1539 he had drafted the conservative <span class="roman">Act of Six Articles</span>, and now he was able to help implement Mary's comprehensive reaction. He was given to pious reflection, and in a letter to Cecil in 1551, discussing the many who were &#145;angling&#146; for a particular church preferment, observed that:<blockquote>We which talk moch of Christ and his holy worde have I feare me used a moch contrary way, for we leave fysshing for men and fyssh agayn in the tempestuous sees of this world for gayne and wycked mammon. (TNA: PRO, SP 10/13, no. 43)</blockquote>Nevertheless, like all conservatives who had a share of appropriated church lands, he was not minded to part with his new acres to save his conscience. The deal made between Cardinal Pole and parliament in December 1554 had only been achieved because the current owners were left in possession. A bull issued by the new Pope Paul IV in July 1555 apparently rescinded that concession, to the consternation of Mary's council. Petre appears to have had secret knowledge of the issue, and expressed his anxieties to King Philip. He then secured for himself a personal papal bull confirming his property rights. By the time this was issued (28 November) a general confirmation of Pole's settlement had been received from Rome, but the incident is a notable indication of Petre's ability to make the papal bureaucracy work for his private purposes.<h2>
<a name="Retirementanddeath"></a>Retirement and death</h2>Dutiful son of the church he may now have become, but Petre probably thought the queen's firm policy against heretics was misguided, and this may help to explain his resignation. Another factor was Philip's return to England in March 1557, determined to bring the country into his war against France and the papacy. Unlike Paget, Petre had never been an ardent Habsburg imperialist, and he now voiced his opposition to English involvement in the continental war. For whatever reason, Petre vacated the secretaryship by the end of March. That he nevertheless continued to draft a good deal of the routine correspondence in the office shows that his retirement was unforced, and highlights the inexperience of those whom the queen had to employ in his place. Mary named Petre one of her executors but, by her successor's general order, he did not receive his designated legacy. Elizabeth retained him as a councillor, but he does not seem to have been a candidate for any office of state. He did, however, return to duty as acting secretary when Cecil was in Scotland in the summer of 1559.<br>
<br>In July 1561 Petre entertained the queen at Ingatestone for a few days, at a cost of &pound;136. During 1564&#150;6 he had another, though involuntary, royal guest, the queen's cousin Lady Catherine Grey, under house arrest because of her unauthorized marriage. Petre continued to attend council meetings until February 1567. He died at his house in Essex on 13 January 1572 and was buried on 1 February in the church at Ingatestone, where his memorial stands. He had already made substantial charitable bequests&#151;a fellowship endowed at All Souls in 1557 and an almshouse founded at Ingatestone in the same year, and seven fellowships endowed at Exeter College in 1566, and another in 1568, these benefactions earning him recognition as the second founder of the college. By these and other gifts in his will he disposed of about &pound;5000.<br>
<br>Petre's widow lived until 10 March 1582. The surviving children of his first marriage, Dorothy [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46470/', "Wadham, Dorothy")</script>] and Elizabeth, had married Nicholas Wadham, founder of the eponymous Oxford college, and John Gostwick respectively; Catherine and Thomasine, daughters of Petre's second marriage, married respectively John Talbot of Grafton, Worcestershire, and Ludovick, son of Sir Edward Greville. Petre's only surviving son, from his second marriage, was John (1549&#150;1613); he inherited Ingatestone, was knighted in 1576, sat as MP for Essex (1584&#150;7), and in 1603 was created Baron Petre of Writtle. He and his descendants made their chief residence at Thorndon Hall near Brentwood, as a result of which (and some conscious twentieth-century restoration) Ingatestone remains much as it was in Sir William's time. His life there is also richly documented by a substantial household archive, amply drawn on in F. G. Emmison's biography. Petre established a reputation for handsome hospitality, though perhaps of the contrived kind to which the <i>nouveaux</i> are reputedly inclined. As far as can be judged he lived within his means at the level appropriate to his station. Unlike his colleagues Cecil, Paget, and Russell he did not found a political dynasty. His family's firm adherence to the Catholic religion [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/64188/', "Petre family")</script>] largely impeded his heirs from following the path of royal and public service which he had himself so successfully negotiated.<br>
