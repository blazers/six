<span class="headword">Tremayne, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1647, <em>d.</em> 1694), <span class="occ">lawyer and politician</span>, was baptized at Mevagissey, Cornwall, on 16 September 1647, the eldest son of Colonel Lewis Tremayne (<i>bap</i>. 1619, <i>d</i>. 1685) of Heligan, St Ewe, Cornwall, and Mary (<i>d</i>. 1701/2), daughter and coheir of John Carew of Penwarne, Mevagissey. He entered the Inner Temple on 8 December 1666, transferring to the Middle Temple on 30 October 1669, and being called to the bar on 9 May 1673. He must have quickly built up an impressive legal practice because in 1680 he was one of the leading king's bench barristers. No doubt this legal success allowed him to marry, on 13 April 1680, Frances (<i>bap</i>. 1655, <i>d</i>. 1683), daughter of William Davie, a barrister, of Creedy, Devon, a union which produced one son who died young. It also explains a volume of &#145;entries, declarations, and pleadings&#146; from the reigns of Charles II and James II which he collected  (BL, Lansdowne MS 1142). In 1685 Tremayne succeeded his father to Heligan, and over the next few years embarked on a building programme which saw a new house erected on the site. Later generations of the family were responsible for developing the gardens at Heligan, which are now a notable attraction [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/97938/', "Tremayne family")</script>].<br>
<br>The revolution of 1688 gave a further boost to Tremayne's career. On 4 May 1689 he was made a king's serjeant, which increased his legal practice, and he appeared frequently as a counsel before the House of Lords between 1689 and 1693. In May 1689 he was also made a serjeant-at-law, and he was knighted on 31 October. In 1690 he was elected to parliament as a whig for Tregony, but this served only to enhance his legal reputation, as he combined speech-making in the Commons with advocacy in Westminster Hall. He acted as counsel for Richard Graham, Viscount Preston, and others, on trial for treason in January 1691, and for Sir John Germaine in the action for damages brought by the duke of Norfolk; and he prosecuted Lord Mohun for the murder of William Mountfort, the actor, in January 1693. In June 1692 he failed in an attempt to be elected recorder of London, but in the following year he petitioned for, and was granted, the stewardships of several hundred courts in Cornwall.<br>
<br>The exact date of Tremayne's death has not been ascertained, but he made his will on 10 February 1694 and his death was noted on the 20th by Narcissus Luttrell. He was buried in the Temple Church, London, on the 23rd. In 1723 his <span class="italic">Placita coronae, or, Pleas of the Crown in Matters Criminal and Civil</span> was published, &#145;digested and revised by the late John Rice of Furnival's Inn&#146;. An English translation by Thomas Vickers in two volumes was published in Dublin in 1793.<br>
