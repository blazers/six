<span class="headword">MacPherson,  Mary</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>M&agrave;iri Mh&oacute;r nan &Ograve;ran, M&agrave;iri Nighean Ian Bhain]</span>  (1821&#150;1898), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born on 10 March 1821 at Skeabost, Skye, the second youngest child of John Macdonald, crofter, known as Ian B&agrave;n Mac Aonghais Oig, and his wife, Flora MacInnes, daughter of Neil MacInnes of Uig, Snizort. Educated at home in domestic skills, she left Skye for Inverness to marry Isaac MacPherson, a shoemaker, on 11 November 1847. He died in 1871 leaving four surviving children. Mary MacPherson was imprisoned on a charge of theft in 1872, and later that year she moved to Glasgow. There she trained as a nurse at the Royal Infirmary gaining a nursing certificate and a diploma in obstetrics. She practised in Greenock and Glasgow until her return to Skye in 1882.<br>
<br>MacPherson found her poetic voice while serving sentence, expressing in Gaelic verse her protestations of innocence and profound sense of outrage. A frequent member of Highland Society c&eacute;ilidhs in Glasgow, she met leading advocates of highland land reform, including John Murdoch, editor of <span class="italic">The Highlander</span> newspaper, and became well known for her poetry. Her support for Charles Fraser Mackintosh, candidate in the Inverness burghs election of 1874, was declared through her early songs. She later accompanied him during his campaign for election to parliament. A prominent figure during the land league agitation of the 1880s, she recited her Gaelic verses at principal gatherings. Song was a primary vehicle of the dissemination of information to Gaelic speakers without literacy in the language of the printed press. Her poetry, and that of other bards of the land agitation, also provides an essential body of Gaelic evidence relating to the highland land movement. Angus Macbain, the Celtic scholar, believed that her songs contributed to the success of crofter candidates in the 1885&#150;6 elections, and described her as the bard of the movement. Her personal sense of injustice and empathy with the sufferings of her people gave a unique force to her poetry. In 1891 a volume entitled <span class="italic">Gaelic Songs and Poems, by Mrs Mary Macpherson (Mairi Nighean Ian Bhain)</span> was published. These were transcribed from her recitation, for although she could read her own poems she could not write them.<br>
<br>A gregarious woman of great physical stature, MacPherson numbered among her friends the scholar Professor John Blackie. He always wore the plaid she made for him, which was placed upon his coffin. Her design was patented as the &#145;Blackie tartan&#146;, which she sold as rugs or wraps. She was the official bard of the Clan Macdonald Society.<br>
<br>After a short illness Mary MacPherson died on 7 November 1898 while visiting Portree, Skye. She was buried on 10 November in Chapel Yard burial-ground, Inverness, where Charles Fraser Mackintosh MP erected a monument. A plaque to her memory was unveiled in 1966 at Skeabost, and a film was made of her life by Comataidh Telebhisein Gaidhlig in 1994.<br>
