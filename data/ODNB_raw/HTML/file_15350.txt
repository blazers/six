<span class="headword">Kendall,  John</span>  (1726&#150;1815), <span class="occ">Quaker minister and writer</span>, was born on 6 March 1726 at Colchester, one of six sons of John Kendall (<i>d</i>. 1752?), printer and bookseller, and his wife, Elizabeth Yarritt (<i>c</i>.1704&#150;1773). John and Elizabeth Kendall belonged to the Society of Friends in a town with a large congregation and two meeting-houses. Kendall himself became a minister in the society at the age of twenty-one. He travelled extensively in the ministry for some years, his first tour of religious visits taking him, in 1750, to the north of England and Scotland as companion to Daniel Stanton. Two years later, in July 1752, he set out for the Netherlands, which he revisited on four further occasions. A group of Friends, by then dwindling in numbers and including the parents of the Quaker historian William Sewel, was at that time established in Amsterdam and in the neighbouring town of Twisk. Kendall, who had some knowledge of Dutch, was always welcomed at both places.<br>
<br>After the death of his father, Kendall took responsibility for his mother, his five brothers, and the business which he inherited. He prospered, and on 17 July 1764 he married Ann Havens (1734?&#150;1805), daughter of Philip and Ann Havens of Colchester; they had no children. His time and money were thenceforth spent in religious visits to various towns, sometimes as part of extensive tours, in philanthropic pursuits, and in study. He attended the yearly meeting of Friends in London over a long period. With his wife he founded, in 1791, Kendall's almshouses at Colchester, for eight poor widows. The rules and original minutes are in his own handwriting, and the former were subsequently printed. He was also involved with the short-lived Friends' school at Ipswich, which was in existence from 1790 to 1800. His bequest of &pound;2000 set up Kendall's Trust, which provided for the distribution of a certain number of religious books every year, and Kendall's Foundation, a school at Colchester, to which his cousin Francis Freshfield also bequeathed money. Six poor boys, preferably the sons of Quakers, were to receive a free education, and a valuable library of 1030 volumes was left for the use of the master and assistants. Since this consisted chiefly of Greek, Latin, and Dutch books, it proved unserviceable and was by consent of the charity commissioners sold, with its furniture, by Sothebys in 1865, the net benefit of &pound;270 going to the school. From 1746 Kendall also undertook clerical work for the Quakers in Colchester, and he appears to have been clerk of Colchester monthly meeting between 1757 and 1791.<br>
<br>Kendall's kindly disposition and personal influence caused him to be received with courtesy wherever he went. It is said that he attended the theatre in Colchester one Saturday night, at the start of the performance, and persuaded both actors and audience quietly to disperse. He called at public houses in Colchester to admonish people against the evils of intemperance, and visited other places of public entertainment for similar purposes. He published his views on the wasting of time in a pamphlet, addressed to all Christians, entitled <span class="italic">Remarks on the prevailing custom of attending stage entertainments: also on the present taste of reading romances and novels</span> (1794).<br>
<br>Kendall was a prolific author and editor of Quaker literature. His most printed work was <span class="italic">Some principles and precepts of the Christian religion explained, by way of question and answer, for the use of children</span> (1783), of which five editions were printed in his lifetime and further reprints went on into the mid-nineteenth century. Rearranging the entries chronologically he edited the Quaker devotional standard collection of obituaries, <span class="italic">Piety Promoted</span> (1789). Sharing the quietist enthusiasm for continental devotional writing, he also edited <span class="italic">Extracts from the writings of Francis F&eacute;nelon, Archbishop of Cambray, with some memoirs of his life</span> (1797). Outside the Quaker tradition he published an abstract of <span class="italic">The Imitation of Christ</span> (1805). A work much used in Quaker families early in the nineteenth century was his abstract, in two volumes, <span class="italic">The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament</span> (1800). Other devotional publications included anthologies of poems on religious subjects (in three parts, 1775&#150;1807) and two volumes of Quaker letters (1802&#150;5).<br>
<br>Kendall more than once visited George III and Queen Charlotte, and, when with his regiment in Colchester, the prince of Wales called on Kendall at the king's request. Kendall died at Colchester on 27 January 1815 and was buried there, in the Quaker burial-ground, on 3 February. The posthumous <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Religious Experience of John Kendall</span>, containing a short autobiographical sketch and a number of letters, was published in 1815.<br>
