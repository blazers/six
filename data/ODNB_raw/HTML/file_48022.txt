<span class="headword">Russell,  Thomas</span>  (1830&#150;1904), <span class="occ">financier and land speculator</span>, was born in Cork, the first of six children of Thomas Russell (1808&#150;1873), carpenter, and Mary Roberts (1811&#150;1847), ward of a Church of Ireland rector. The Russells left Ireland with the infant Thomas in 1833. After seven years in New South Wales the family settled in Auckland, the new capital of New Zealand. In 1844 young Thomas was articled to Auckland's foremost lawyer, Thomas Outhwaite. While undergoing legal training, he became an enthusiastic lay worker for the then powerful Wesleyan denomination. Licensed to practise at twenty-one, he had grown into a tall, energetic man of persuasive personality. As ambitious as he was able, he set up as a sole solicitor. The Wesleyans helped him by putting much church and mission work his way. On 18 July 1854 he married Emeline Vercoe; they had seven children.<br>
<br>During the later 1850s Russell rose to be a powerful figure in the Auckland business community, as an activist in the progress party (the political arm of the local merchants), and as a foremost conveyancing solicitor. Determined and plausible, he established an ascendancy over the settlement's capitalists which endured for three decades. In 1859 he took the initiative in forming the New Zealand Insurance Company, and two years later was the driving force behind the creation of the Bank of New Zealand. In the same year he formed a legal partnership with Frederick Whitaker, renowned counsel and politician. Whitaker and Russell soon became the most profitable practice in the land. In an era when business advantage was inseparable from political influence, Russell entered the general assembly in 1861. Within a year he was taken into the cabinet, holding office until late 1864 in two successive ministries. As minister of defence in the second administration, he pressed for an uncompromising military reckoning with Maori during the land wars, and for confiscation of all &#145;rebel&#146; lands, policies which cause, even today, undiminished anguish and resentment among the Maori people.<br>
<br>When the capital was shifted to Wellington in 1865 Russell withdrew from politics to concentrate on his multifarious business interests. He was the chief promoter in the same year of the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Co. Ltd, incorporated in London. This company raised mortgage debentures in Britain to finance short-term advances to squatters secured by a lien on the season's wool clip, and more importantly to take over some troublesome long-term mortgage advances of the Bank of New Zealand. During the Thames gold rush Russell was a heavy investor in mines, batteries, and goldmining companies. By 1874 he had so prospered that he went to live in England as an expatriate rentier, entrusting his extensive interests in New Zealand to his partner Whitaker and to local agents. He realized, as few did, that by living in London he could take advantage of the capital market there at times when investors were &#145;on the feed&#146; to finance first the development of extensive landed estates run by syndicates, of which he was the key figure, and second the Bank of New Zealand and its loan company whose directorates he now dominated. A rural collapse in New Zealand and the well-founded suspicion of British debenture holders that colonial borrowers could no longer service their debts brought down Russell's landed companies in the later 1880s and imperilled the financial institutions he had created. Russell himself would have been ruined had he not shuffled off some of his debts to the shoulders of others, and invested in the highly profitable Waihi Goldmining Company formed in 1887.<br>
<br>Russell remains a controversial figure. He was extraordinarily self-regarding. A chancery judge investigating the affairs of Russell's insolvent Loan and Mercantile Company in 1894 identified him as the chief culprit; the evidence showed &#145;irresistibly&#146; that the other directors had the &#145;fixed belief that everything recommended by Mr Russell must be right and for the interest of the company &hellip; They left him absolute master of the situation&#146;  (Mennell, 71&#150;2). Yet he was admirably forward-looking. His policy of making use of readily available nineteenth-century British capital to develop the infrastructure of the colonial economy has few detractors today, although most historians agree that his sanguine temperament often led him to mistake the right time to invest. He died at Farnham, Surrey, where he had lived from 1897, on 2 September 1904.<br>
