<span class="headword">James,  (John) Morrice Cairns</span>, Baron Saint Brides  (1916&#150;1989), <span class="occ">diplomatist</span>, was born on 30 April 1916 in Finchley, Middlesex, the only son and younger child of Lewis Cairns James, professor of drama and elocution at the Royal College of Music, and his second wife, Catherine Mary, daughter of John Maitland Marshall, of Dulwich, London. He was educated at Bradfield College, Berkshire, and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he obtained second classes in classical honour moderations (1936) and <i>literae humaniores</i> (1938). He entered the Dominions Office as an assistant principal in 1939. After war broke out he joined the Royal Navy as an ordinary seaman in 1940, before being commissioned into the Royal Marines in 1941. He subsequently saw action in the Middle East and Sicily, for which he was appointed MBE (military) in 1944, and he was demobilized in the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the following year to return to the Dominions Office (soon to become the Commonwealth Relations Office).<br>
<br>James was a born diplomatist and an outstanding negotiator, whose qualities were made full use of by ministers of both parties, though his easy manner and ready smile concealed a toughness and ambition which did not always endear him to his subordinates. Entries in successive editions of <span class="italic">Who's Who</span> after his retirement describe his main recreation first as &#145;exploring the fallibility of contemporary statesmen&#146; and later as &#145;meeting new and intelligent people&#146;. He appears to have made few lifelong friends among his immediate colleagues, but his new friends invariably found him congenial and sympathetic.<br>
<br>Having joined the civil service before the war, James's promotion when he rejoined it was rapid. After a brief period as first secretary in the high commission in South Africa (1946&#150;7), he became in quick succession head of the Commonwealth Relations Office defence department (1949&#150;51) and then of the establishment department (1951&#150;2). In 1952 he was posted as deputy high commissioner to Lahore, so beginning a unique series of postings to the Indian subcontinent where, with a few breaks, he served successively as deputy and high commissioner in both Karachi and New Delhi. During one of these breaks he accompanied Harold Macmillan on his tour of Asia and the Far East in 1958, and in another made a series of visits to Rhodesia to set up what proved to be the abortive talks between Harold Wilson and Ian Smith in HMS <i>Tiger</i> in 1966 and HMS <i>Fearless</i> in 1968. Smith's duplicity (or weakness of character) was underlined by the fact that he assured James before the <i>Tiger</i> talks that he had &#145;full and unequivocal powers to settle&#146;, but allowed his agreement to be overruled by his cabinet colleagues on his return to Salisbury.<br>
<br>In the Indian subcontinent James initially tended to be identified with Pakistan, where he served as deputy high commissioner in 1955&#150;6 and high commissioner from 1961 to 1966. With his opposite number in India, John Freeman, he was closely involved in the negotiations to settle the Rann of Cutch affair which preceded the outbreak of war between India and Pakistan in 1965, in which the Wilson government gave some evidence of favouring Pakistan. As a result, when James was posted to Delhi as high commissioner in 1968, he faced some initial hostility, though with characteristic aplomb he quickly gained the confidence of Indian ministers.<br>
<br>James's appointment to Delhi came as the culmination of a curious sequence of events. Having been deputy under-secretary of state for two years, he had been appointed permanent under-secretary of state at the Commonwealth Office (formed two years earlier from the amalgamation of the Colonial Office with the Commonwealth Relations Office) in early 1968, but within ten days of his appointment the cup was dashed from his lips by Harold Wilson's announcement that the Commonwealth Office itself was to be amalgamated with the Foreign Office. He thus served as permanent under-secretary of state for only six months, but in compensation was awarded the rare honour for a civil servant of being sworn of the privy council (1968). He ended his career in the diplomatic service as high commissioner to Australia (1971&#150;6). While in the post he had to deal with Australian apprehension over Britain's entry into the European Common Market and with the affair of John Stonehouse, the runaway MP.<br>
<br>James was appointed CMG (1957), CVO (1961), KCMG (1962), and GCMG (1975). In 1977 he received a life peerage, taking the title of Baron Saint Brides and accepting the ceremonial post of king of arms of the Order of St Michael and St George. After his retirement he took up a succession of academic appointments at American universities, including Harvard, the Foreign Policy Research Institute at Philadelphia, and finally the Center for International Security and Arms Control at Stanford, California, where he was remembered with affection and admiration for his work on the Asian&#150;Pacific region and for his encouragement of the younger students.<br>
<br>James was a big man in every way, who in his earlier years waged a cheerful, but not wholly successful, battle with corpulence by swimming whenever he could during his lunch break. He was married twice. His first marriage in 1948, to Elizabeth Margaret Roper Piesse, daughter of Francis Charles Roper Piesse, solicitor and, later, hotelier, came as something of a surprise, many of his colleagues having been under the impression that he had been courting her mother. Of this marriage two daughters and a son were born. Following Elizabeth's death in 1966, he married in 1968 Genevi&egrave;ve Christiane (Jenny) Sarasin, daughter of Robert Henri Houdin, company director. On their return from Australia he moved with her to live in France at La Plotte, Cap St Pierre, St Tropez; he died at St Tropez on 26 November 1989.<br>
