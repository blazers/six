<span class="headword">Sheaffe, Sir  Roger Hale</span>, baronet  (1763&#150;1851), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born at Boston, Massachusetts, on 15 July 1763, was the third son of William Sheaffe, deputy collector of HM customs at Boston, and his wife, Susannah, eldest daughter of Thomas Child of Boston. As a boy, Sheaffe became the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Hugh Percy, Earl Percy (later second duke of Northumberland), who during the American War of Independence had his headquarters in Boston in the boarding house run by Sheaffe's widowed mother. Percy sent Sheaffe to sea, then transferred him to Loch&eacute;e's military academy, Chelsea, and subsequently bought most of Sheaffe's commissions. On 1 May 1778, through Percy's influence, Sheaffe received an ensigncy, and on 27 December 1780 a lieutenancy in the 5th foot, of which Percy was colonel. He served in Ireland from January 1781 to May 1787, and in Canada from July 1787 to September 1797. Under orders from Guy Carleton, first Baron Dorchester, who had been instructed by Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe, he was sent in 1794 to protest against certain settlements made by the Americans on Indian land on the south shore of Lake Ontario. On 5 May 1795 he obtained his company in the 5th foot and on 13 December 1797 a majority in the 81st; on 22 March 1798 he became lieutenant-colonel in the 49th, but he seems to have become unpopular with the men. He served in the Netherlands from August to November 1799, in the expedition to the Baltic from March to July 1801, and in Canada from September 1802 to October 1811. He was promoted brevet colonel on 25 April 1808, and major-general on 4 June 1811. He married, on 29 January 1810, Margaret, daughter of John Coffin of Quebec, and cousin of Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin, bt. They had two sons and four daughters, all of whom predeceased Sheaffe. His wife died at Bath on 1 May 1855. He again served in Canada from 29 July 1812 to November 1813. On 13 October 1812 United States troops took Queenstown on the Niagara, but on the same day Sheaffe, on the death of General Sir Isaac Brock, assuming command of the British forces, recaptured the town, the Americans losing heavily. On 27 April 1813 he defended the town of York (later Toronto), when the losses of the Americans in taking the place exceeded the total numbers of those opposed to them. Heavily outnumbered, Sheaffe withdrew his force; probably a sound decision, but much criticized. He continued to command in the upper province, cautiously declining to take risks, and to administer its government until June 1813 (when he was replaced by Major-General Francis de Rottenburg), and on retirement was praised by the executive council. He had lost the confidence of his superior officer, Lieutenant-General Sir George Prevost, and so was recalled to England, leaving in November 1813.<br>
<br>On 16 January 1813 Sheaffe was made a baronet for his victory at Queenstown, and further rewarded by being made colonel of the 36th on 20 December 1829, and promoted to general on 28 June 1838. He had a residence at Edswale, co. Clare, but from 1817 lived largely in Edinburgh, where he died on 17 July 1851, when his title became extinct.<br>
