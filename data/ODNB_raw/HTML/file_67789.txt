<span class="headword">Gunter,  Anne</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1584), <span class="occ">demoniac</span>, was baptized at Hungerford on 10 May 1584, the fifth and youngest child of Brian Gunter (<i>c</i>.1540&#150;1628) and Anne Gunter (<i>d</i>. 1617). She enjoyed a brief period of fame in the summer and autumn of 1605 when James VI and I interested himself in her supposedly bewitched condition.<br>
<br>The Gunters were an extensive gentry clan which had originated in Abergavenny, and which by the time of Anne's birth was firmly established in Berkshire. About 1588 Anne's family moved to North Moreton in that county when her father inherited the village's rectory on the death of a brother. Brian Gunter was a contentious, litigious, and violent man, this last quality being demonstrated in May 1598 when he inflicted fatal injuries on John and Richard Gregory, members of a local yeoman family, in the course of a brawl at a village football match.<br>
<br>In summer 1604 Anne Gunter briefly fell ill; her sickness at this stage was attributed to &#145;the mother&#146;, or hysteria. She rapidly recovered, but fell ill again in October of that year. This time the symptoms persisted, and, when the numerous doctors who were called to examine her failed to diagnose a natural disease, it was decided that she was bewitched. By this point, indeed, she was showing the classic symptoms of what might be described as possession by witchcraft, including going into fits and comas and vomiting pins, and was naming three village women as her tormentors. The chief of these was Elizabeth Gregory, who had married into the family upon two of whose members Brian Gunter had inflicted fatal injuries in 1598.<br>
<br>As was common in such cases Anne Gunter's sufferings attracted a large audience, among which, remarkably, were a number of figures from Oxford University. Anne's elder sister Susan was married to Thomas Holland, regius professor of divinity at Oxford, and at one point Anne was lodged in his apartments at Exeter College, where he was rector, while her father obviously enjoyed a wide social circle at the university. Among those who witnessed her sufferings were Bartholomew Warner, regius professor of medicine, and a man who was subsequently to achieve considerable eminence at Oxford, John Prideaux.<br>
<br>Elizabeth Gregory and another of the suspected women were tried for witchcraft at the Abingdon assizes on 1 March 1605, and acquitted. Matters should have ended there, but Gunter's afflictions persisted. She was taken into custody for observation by Henry Cotton, bishop of Salisbury; most of those who examined her at this stage were convinced she was simulating being bewitched or possessed. Brian Gunter, however, was anxious to demonstrate the genuine nature of his daughter's afflictions, and took her to meet James VI and I when the king visited Oxford University in August 1605.<br>
<br>James was sceptical, and passed Gunter's case on to Richard Bancroft, the archbishop of Canterbury, who in turn delegated investigating her to Samuel Harsnett. Bancroft and Harsnett had been involved in investigating a number of incidents of possession, witchcraft, and exorcism (notably those involving John Darrell) and had developed a thoroughly sceptical position, while the physician Edward Jorden, another proven sceptic, was brought in to examine Anne. The net effect of their efforts was that by 10 October 1605 James was able to write a letter to the earl of Salisbury stating that Anne had confessed that she had simulated her sufferings at her father's instigation.<br>
<br>Early in 1606 Star Chamber proceedings were initiated against Brian and Anne Gunter for false accusations: Harsnett and Richard Neile were heavily involved in orchestrating these proceedings, which were probably initiated by Bancroft. More than fifty witnesses gave evidence, their depositions covering hundreds of foolscap pages, making this among the best documented English witchcraft cases. The Gunter case showed many remarkable features, but is perhaps chiefly significant for demonstrating how witchcraft accusations, begun in the context of personal grudges and village conflicts, might emerge in the context of national ecclesiastical politics. The scepticism of those leading clerics who brought the Gunters to trial was part and parcel of their hostility to the pretensions to powers of exorcism made by certain godly ministers, a hostility which was but one strand in an anti-puritanism which involved conflicting visions of the church.<br>
<br>Gaps in documentation mean that the outcome of the Star Chamber proceedings cannot be established, while we have no sure evidence of Anne Gunter's later fate. James's letter of 10 October 1605 mentions that Anne had fallen in love with one of Bancroft's servants, surnamed Asheley, and that a marriage was being arranged with royal support, and a number of other sources support this story, but no record of such a marriage, or of any other indication of what later happened to Anne, has yet been found. Brian Gunter died at Oxford, and was buried at St Mary the Virgin on 17 November 1628.<br>
