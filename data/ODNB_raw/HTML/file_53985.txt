<span class="headword">Momma,  Jacob</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1679), <span class="occ">copper and brass manufacturer</span>, was born in Stolberg, in the Rhineland of Germany, the son of Leonard and Barbara Momma, members of a group of protestant brass manufacturers. Having previously been settled in Aachen, religious persecution had persuaded them to move to the city outskirts at Stolberg. Several gravestones still commemorate the Mommas and other brassworking families in the town's protestant graveyard.<br>
<br>One branch of the family established brass and copper manufacture under royal patronage in Sweden during the seventeenth century. Jacob Momma, however, moved to England where, with German partners Daniel Demetrius and Peter Hoet, he leased Esher Mill in Surrey in 1649. The partners adopted traditional European brassmaking methods, using crushed calamine&#151;the zinc carbonate ore, which they obtained from Mendip in Somerset&#151;alloyed with copper, imported from Sweden in the absence of English supplies. Water-powered hammers were employed to flatten brass ingots to produce sheets of the metal and also to form hollowware vessels; and wire was also drawn by water-power.<br>
<br>Momma petitioned unsuccessfully to parliament in 1656 for relief against high duties imposed on imported Swedish copper. A few months later he was brought before the court of the Society of Mineral and Battery Works, the monopoly established in the reign of Elizabeth I, for failing to pay charges for leasing their brass manufacturing rights. Although in defence he pleaded ignorance of this moribund organization, his payments remained outstanding for some years. At some point Momma married and had at least two sons.<br>
<br>Momma was naturalized by 1660 when he purchased the Esher premises outright. A year later he was appointed as constable and served as a juror in 1663, having thus attained the respect of his local community. At this time he and his partners were again petitioning parliament for assistance for the industry, claiming that their manufacturing concerns were almost lost and that their fires were going out. Separately, he pleaded for higher tariffs against imported brass wire. Protection was sought from the price manipulation of exports controlled by powerful Dutch merchants whose practices in England varied from the dumping of cheap foreign brass to the withholding of copper supplies. Momma succeeded in obtaining a degree of support from the Society of Mineral and Battery Works, but neither petition succeeded.<br>
<br>In an attempt to obtain copper at more economic prices, Momma was briefly involved from 1665 in mining copper at Ecton Hill, Staffordshire (later a hugely successful and profitable mine). There he is credited with the introduction of gunpowder to English mining technology and also of a new kind of bellows in smelting his ore at the nearby Ellastone Mill. However, the whole project, managed by his son Jacob, was abandoned at a loss of &pound;300 a few years later when it was found to be unprofitable. The younger Jacob returned to Esher to manage the copper mills, where brass production and manufacture was still surviving in spite of economic pressures. During the 1660s the Esher premises were taxed on twenty hearths, believed to have been related to the brass-making processes. The Momma family appears to have continued this business until the 1670s when two brassworks were demolished. Jacob senior claimed that he had lost &pound;6000 in attempting to make the works pay.<br>
<br>Jacob Momma died in 1679, probably at Esher, and two copper mills at Esher involving both sons, Jacob and William, survived only briefly after their father's death. A failed scheme for producing brass farthings and a business exporting Mendip calamine were also revealed in papers of a dispute in 1686 over family property. In the early 1690s a new company led by William Dockwra, benefiting from political change and technical innovation, succeeded in reviving the Esher brass and copper works of Jacob Momma.<br>
