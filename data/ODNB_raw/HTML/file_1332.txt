<span class="headword">Barber,  Mary</span>  (<em>c.</em>1685&#150;1755), <span class="occ">poet</span>, is of unknown parentage. She married Rupert Barber (<i>d</i>. 1777?), a Dublin woollen draper, and lived in Werburgh Street, Dublin, from at least 1705 to at least 1724. In 1719 her husband acquired rights to property at Delville, north of Dublin, adjoining that of Patrick Delany, a friend of Swift and later chancellor of St Patrick's; by 1744, when Mrs Delany, formerly Mary Pendarves, came to Delville, Mary Barber and her family were neighbours. She had nine children, four of whom survived infancy: Constantine, born in 1714, later MD, professor of materia medica at Trinity College, Dublin, and president of the Royal College of Physicians; Mira, born in 1717; Rupert, born in 1719 and later known as an artist in miniature and an enamellist; and Lucius, born in 1720.<br>
<br>Barber admitted in the preface to her <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1734) that a woman should not enter into public debate and that she wrote poetry to educate her children, but almost a decade previously she had attracted the attention of Lord Carteret, the lord lieutenant of Ireland, and Lady Carteret with several poems, one of which, a petition on behalf of the widow of an army officer, is the earliest evidence of the social conscience which she demonstrated in her <span class="italic">Poems</span>. These poems also came to the attention of the poet Thomas Tickell, whom Carteret had appointed chief secretary in Ireland in 1724 and who was on favourable terms with Swift. Through her connection with the Carterets Barber entered Swift's circle, coming to know Delany, the poet and classical scholar Constantia Grierson, and Laetitia Pilkington. Swift praised Barber's work, including her in his &#145;triumfeminate&#146; with Constantia Grierson and the literary critic Elizabeth Sican (Psyche).<br>
<br>In 1730 Barber visited England, with Swift's support, to raise subscriptions for a volume of her work. Against his advice she approached, and irritated, Alexander Pope, evidently expecting the encouragement she had readily obtained in the <i>senatus consultum</i> of her friends in Dublin, where Swift, in the chair, Constantia Grierson, Laetitia Pilkington, her husband Matthew, and Delany had discussed her verse. While Swift believed, as he wrote to Pope in 1731, that &#145;her Modesty and her Ambition&#146; had been in conflict  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 3.457), mystery surrounds an incident later in 1731 in which Swift's signature was forged on a letter to Queen Caroline in praise of Mary Barber. Swift denied any involvement in a letter to Pope and Mary Barber has never been cleared of suspicion.<br>
<br>Barber travelled between Ireland and England several times in the early 1730s, visiting London, Tunbridge Wells, and Bath. She contributed anonymously to <span class="italic">Tunbrigialia, or, Tunbridge Miscellanies, for the Year 1730</span>. In 1732 Swift attempted to assist her, without success, when he asked his friend John Barber, lord mayor of London, who was no relation, to secure a position for her husband. In 1734 she was arrested in England with Matthew Pilkington and others for possession of manuscript copies of some of Swift's political poems attacking Walpole's administration. Matthew Pilkington had informed against her. After an early release she lived for some years in Bath, possibly with her son Rupert. She obtained over 900 subscribers to her <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1734), including leading figures of the Irish and British establishments. Swift subscribed for ten copies. The Pilkingtons were conspicuously absent. Six poems by Constantia Grierson were published posthumously in this volume. Barber's son Constantine contributed five and Elizabeth Rowe one. One poem, &#145;Apollo's Edict&#146;, has since been published as Swift's and has inspired scholarly controversy. A second edition followed in 1735 and was reissued in 1736. Swift and Mary Barber wrote prefaces to the earl of Orrery, one of her most influential patrons.<br>
<br>In 1737 Swift gave Barber the manuscript of his <span class="italic">Complete Collection of Genteel and Ingenious Conversation</span> (1738) in response to her plea for support. She was unwell, having suffered considerably for some years from gout, for which she had been treated by Dr Richard Mead. She abandoned her idea of sailing to Georgia and returned to Ireland, where she lived near the Delanys at Delville, possibly with her son Rupert. She wrote very little after 1734, notably some verse on gout in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> in 1737 and some minor pieces. She corresponded with her printer Samuel Richardson about <span class="italic">Pamela</span> in 1741, and indirectly with George Ballard in 1747 about Constantia Grierson. She was given significant representation in <span class="italic">Poems by Eminent Ladies</span> (1755).<br>
<br>Barber died on 14 June 1755, &#145;in an advanced Age&#146;  (<span class="italic">Dublin Journal</span>, 14/17 June 1755). A few months before, Mrs Delany, her friend from the early 1730s, wrote that &#145;Old Mr. Barber <i>is alive</i>, drinks his claret, smokes his pipe, and <i>cares not a pin for any of his family</i>&#146;. He survived his wife by twenty-two years  (Pilkington, 2.391).<br>
<br>Swift's praise of Barber as &#145;the best Poetess of both Kingdoms&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 4.186) was not universally accepted. Her most trenchant critic, Laetitia Pilkington, thought her work &#145;might &hellip; be seen in the Cheesemongers, Chandlers, Pastry-cooks, and Second-hand Booksellers Shops&#146;  (Pilkington, 2.383). Swift referred to her &#145;bashfulness&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence</span>, 4.456) but that did not protect her from controversy. Her world of the friendships and social conscience of an early eighteenth-century Irishwoman has been generally neglected since her own time, but since the 1970s she has received individual scholarly and critical attention as a woman writer and a significant figure in Irish culture and eighteenth-century studies.<br>
