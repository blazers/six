<span class="headword">Pearsall,  Richard</span>  (1698&#150;1762), <span class="occ">Independent minister</span>, was born and baptized at Kidderminster, Worcestershire, on 29 August 1698, the son of Nicholas and Anne Pearsall. Little is known of his early life, but it is said that his sisters Hannah and Phoebe encouraged him in faith. After Hannah married and became Hannah Housman, he published extracts of her diary in 1744 under the title <span class="italic">The Power and Pleasure of Divine Life</span>. Phoebe, who was married to Joseph Williams of Kidderminster, was a correspondent of Philip Doddridge; her diary was published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Richard grew up under the ministry of John Spilsbury and was educated at a dissenting academy at Tewkesbury under Samuel Jones. Joseph Butler and Thomas Secker were among his fellow students.<br>
<br>In a letter dated 18 December 1718 Pearsall wrote that he was setting out as a candidate for the ministry. He was ordained at Bromyard in Herefordshire in 1721, and succeeded Samuel Philips (<i>d</i>. 1721), whose daughter Anna he married at Avebury, Herefordshire, on 8 December 1724. They had two daughters. In 1731 he moved to Warminster in Wiltshire, where the church had divided after a dispute over charges of Arianism. From 1747 until 1762 he was minister of the Independent church at Taunton, Somerset. He conducted his last baptism in July 1762 and died at Taunton on 10 November 1762.<br>
<br>Pearsall was a keen correspondent, and wrote to Philip Doddridge, George Whitefield, and James Hervey among others. His friendship with Hervey may have encouraged him to attempt to write verse, and one of his poems was published in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (March 1736). After his death, under the title <span class="italic">Reliquiae sacrae</span> in 1765, Thomas Gibbons published a deathbed letter that Pearsall had written to his congregations, together with <span class="italic">Meditations on selected passages of scripture and sacred dialogues between a father and his children</span>. In addition to a few tracts, sermons, and letters Pearsall published contemplations on the ocean, harvest, sickness, and the last judgment (1753), which ran to several editions, and <span class="italic">Meditations on Butterflies: Philosophical and Devotional, in Two Letters to a Lady</span> (1758).<br>
