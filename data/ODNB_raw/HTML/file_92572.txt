<span class="headword">Corrigan,  Kathleen</span> <span class="st"> [<em>name in religion </em>Felicitas Corrigan]</span>  (1908&#150;2003), <span class="occ">nun, writer, and church musician</span>, was born on 6 March 1908 at 16 Gurnall Street, Everton, Liverpool, the second of eight surviving children of Joseph Corrigan, a &#145;private coachman&#146; or taxi driver of Irish extraction, and his wife, Edith, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Breze. Though 97 Eversley Street was a humble home her mother was determined her children should receive a good education and somehow money was found to provide piano lessons to nurture Kathleen's talent for music. At fifteen she was able partially to repay her parents when she was appointed, at a salary of &pound;15 a year, as organist of Our Lady of Lourdes and St Bernard's Church in Kingsley Road in Toxteth. Her academic abilities matched her musical accomplishments and in 1926 she was awarded the senior city scholarship to read English at Liverpool University and in 1931 the Cambridge teaching diploma for higher education.<br>
<br>As a small child Corrigan had felt called by God to be a nun. However, her mother persuaded her to complete her education first. Her university days over, in September 1931 she won the first organ scholarship offered by the Catholic archdiocese of Liverpool. As part of her studies she was tutored in plainsong by Dominic Willson, a monk of Ampleforth Abbey. It was he who sent her to another Benedictine house, Stanbrook Abbey in the Malvern Hills near Worcester, to meet the renowned expert in Gregorian chant Abbess Laurentia McLachlan. Such was the impact of their encounter and of Stanbrook itself on Corrigan that she knew she must make her life there within its enclosure, though she once joked in a newspaper interview that without the abbess's intervention she had planned to abandon all notion of vocation and buy a packet of cigarettes and the <span class="italic">News of the World</span>. She entered in September 1933, taking the name Felicitas because her birthday fell on the feast of saints Felicity and Perpetua. Four and a half years later she made her final profession and became&#151;as has been the custom with English Benedictine nuns since the middle ages&#151;Dame Felicitas. The community at Stanbrook, founded at Cambrai in 1623 and devoted in the Benedictine tradition to prayer and the regular chanting of the divine office, excelled in music, scholarship, the arts, and offering hospitality. In all fields Dame Felicitas made an outstanding contribution and was one of a number of exceptional women in the community who made a substantial impact in the wider world.<br>
<br>In 1946 Dame Felicitas published her first book, a collection of correspondence between saints and nuns. There was no author credit line, as was the way until 1966 at the abbey. Its writer was described simply as &#145;a Benedictine of Stanbrook&#146;. It was her similarly anonymous account of the unexpected friendship between Dame Laurentia, the playwright George Bernard Shaw, and the scholar Sir Sydney Cockerell which generated the most attention. <span class="italic">In a Great Tradition</span> (1956) sparked so much interest in this unlikely triangle that in 1985 Dame Felicitas produced an expanded volume on the subject. <span class="italic">The Nun, the Infidel and the Superman</span> was the basis of Hugh Whitemore's 1988 play, <span class="italic">The Best of Friends</span>, which had two successful runs in the West End and was made into a film, starring Wendy Hiller as Dame Laurentia. It was through Cockerell that Dame Felicitas was introduced in 1959 to the poet Siegfried Sassoon, who two years earlier had become a Catholic. In 1960 she produced a compilation of his religious verse, <span class="italic">The Path to Peace</span>, and in 1973 an anthology marking his spiritual pilgrimage, <span class="italic">Siegfried Sassoon: Poet's Pilgrimage</span>. Her biography of the poet and translator of medieval Latin verse Helen Waddell won the James Tait Black memorial prize in 1987. It was through Cockerell too that she began a long friendship with the actor and recent convert to Catholicism Sir Alec Guinness. For forty years they corresponded regularly and Guinness wrote a foreword to <span class="italic">George Thomas of Soho</span> (1970), her biography of the writer whose early hardships in life paralleled her own. Another long friendship, this time with Rumer Godden, led to <span class="italic">In This House of Brede</span> (1969), the Anglo-Indian writer's best-selling novel set in a Benedictine monastery.<br>
<br>Dame Felicitas's postbag was large. She often resorted at Christmas and Easter&#151;after the silences maintained in Advent and Lent&#151;to sending out circular letters to keep up contact with her many friends and admirers. Despite her decades in the enclosure, her mind was never constrained and her round robins displayed an encyclopaedic knowledge of church writers and English literature. They were also full of her forthright, shrewd, and wry observations.<br>
<br>Dame Felicitas's musical talents were used to the full from her arrival at Stanbrook, both in organ playing and choir training. She retired as organist only when her eyesight was too poor for her to continue. She counted the role her greatest achievement. Her love of plainchant remained, but in the years after the reforming Second Vatican Council of the Catholic church (1962&#150;5) she played a leading role in adapting liturgical music to the vernacular in plainsong idiom. Her English setting for compline, maintaining its traditional poetry and theology intact, is regarded by many as peerless.<br>
<br>In 1977 Dame Felicitas took on a new challenge&#151;to help a new abbey of Benedictine nuns at Enugu in Nigeria&#151;but it was not for her and she soon returned. She made other occasional forays out of Stanbrook. In 1980 she attended the national pastoral congress of the English and Welsh Catholic church in her native Liverpool, but while she approved of greater use of women's talents in the church&#151;and advocated the return of deaconesses&#151;she did not favour their ordination to the priesthood.<br>
<br>Dame Felicitas's life and its many achievements exemplified the qualities of the monastic tradition in the English setting. The rare combination of spirituality and scholarship at Stanbrook made her an inspiring character. She spent her last months at Nazareth House, London Road, Charlton Kings, Cheltenham, and died there on 7 October 2003. She was buried at Stanbrook.<br>
