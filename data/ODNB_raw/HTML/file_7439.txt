<span class="headword">Delane <span class="st"> [Delany]</span>,  Dennis</span>  (1694/5?&#150;1750), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in Ireland and educated at Trinity College, Dublin. Burtchaell and Sadleir identified him as the Dennis Delany who was the son of Solomon Delany, a clergyman, and who was educated at Mr Griffin's school, Elphin, before his matriculation at Trinity on 16 December 1711 at the age of sixteen. Originally intended for the bar, Delane made his acting d&eacute;but in 1729 at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin, under Thomas Elrington's management. There he developed a sizeable repertory of mostly tragic major roles, his principal parts being Alexander in Nathaniel Lee's <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span> and Bevil in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Conscious Lovers</span>. Delane negotiated for a London engagement at Drury Lane but the company was &#145;brimful&#146;  (Chetwood, 131) and he was employed instead by Henry Giffard at Goodman's Fields. He made his first appearance on 24 November 1731 as Chalmont in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Orphan</span>, and in his first three seasons he played at least thirty-five different roles, including Othello, Oroonoko, Richard III, Bevil, Alexander, Tamerlane, Aimwell in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Stratagem</span>, Hotspur, Manly in <span class="italic">The Provok'd Husband</span> by John Vanbrugh and Colley Cibber, Brutus, Piercy in John Banks's <span class="italic">Virtue Betray'd</span>, Macbeth, Lear, and Cato. With his &#145;good person&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>) and rich repertory, Delane was an immediate and conspicuous success in London.<br>
<br>Delane's first appearance at Covent Garden, where he had been recommended by James Quin, was as Alexander in <span class="italic">The Rival Queens</span> on 25 October 1735, under the management of John Rich. Delane was one of the original twenty-four members of the Sublime Society of Beefsteaks, formed by Rich in 1735. At Covent Garden he reprised many of his old parts and added Antony, Lothario, Falstaff, King John, Richard II, Henry V, Volpone, and Herod. On 10 September 1741 he made his first appearance, as Othello, at Drury Lane, where he remained until the end of the 1747&#150;8 season, creating the characters of Mahomet, King Henry, and Osmond in James Thomson's <span class="italic">Tancred and Sigismunda</span>, as well as adding Comus, Antonio in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span>, Silvio in John Fletcher's <span class="italic">Women Pleased</span>, and a number of other new roles to his repertory.<br>
<br>Delane married Margaretta Horsington at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 9 November 1745, when both declared themselves residents of the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, and buried a daughter there on 11 July 1746. Delane moved lodgings frequently in London, living at various addresses in the Strand and Covent Garden. He often returned to Ireland for summer seasons, where he inherited a small paternal estate. Upon his death <span class="italic">Faulkner's Dublin Journal</span> described him as &#145;of Killinough in the County of Roscommon, a Gentleman of exceeding good character&#146;.<br>
<br>In the <span class="italic">Apology for the Life of Mr. T[heophilus] C[ibber], Comedian</span>, ascribed to Henry Fielding, Delane is compared favourably to James Quin, his mentor. While admitting that Delane &#145;has a Sameness of Tone and Expression, and drawls out his Lines to a displeasing Length&#146; the author concedes that &#145;that loud Violence of Voice is useful to him when Anger, Indignation, or such enrag'd Passions are to be expres'd&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>). Not all critics, however, were impressed by Delane's loud voice, described by Thomas Gray in 1746 as &#145;deep-mouth'd&#146; and &#145;like a Passing Bell&#146;  (Walpole, <span class="italic">Corr.</span>, 14.6).<br>
<br>Delane's friendship with David Garrick ended irrevocably after the summer of 1748, when Delane recommended Mrs Ward to Rich at Covent Garden. Garrick resented this as disloyalty and was furious. Delane left Drury Lane and played at Covent Garden for the remainder of his career, beginning with Hotspur on 17 October 1748. Faced with the ridicule of Garrick, who mimicked his style when portraying Bayes in <span class="italic">The Rehearsal</span>, he turned to alcohol &#145;for relief to his hurt mind&#146; and &#145;continued to use it with such excess that he was never himself again&#146;  (Wilkinson, 1.83).<br>
<br>Delane, however, played a heavy schedule during his 1748&#150;9 season, and for the first time in his career he acted with Quin. He put in a special appearance at Twickenham on 21 September 1749 as Manly in William Wycherley's <span class="italic">The Plain Dealer</span>, a part considered ideal for him due to his &#145;easy and polite&#146; manner. John Hill suggested in <span class="italic">The Actor</span>, shortly after Delane's death, that his reputation would unquestionably have been much higher had he only played characters with &#145;strength of voice and dignity of figure&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>), such as Aimwell, rather than the heroic parts that brought him to prominence. It is commonly agreed that Delane achieved success before he had matured as an actor and that he simply couldn't compete with Garrick and Spranger Barry at Drury Lane, both of whom played similar lines. Delane gradually turned more to comedy and was given fewer opportunities to play good leading roles. According to Davies &#145;his attachment to the bottle prevented his rising to any degree of excellence&#146;  (Davies, <span class="italic">Life of Garrick</span>, 1.27). Delane was a well-built, good-looking, graceful man but, by 1749, &#145;inclining to the bulky&#146;  (Chetwood, 131).<br>
<br>Delane's last appearance was at a benefit on 17 March 1750. He died on 31 March and was buried at St Paul's, Covent Garden, on 6 April. He had written an undated will in which he bequeathed his entire estate, including land in co. Roscommon and co. Galway, to his wife.<br>
