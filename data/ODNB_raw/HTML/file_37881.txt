<span class="headword">Ramsbottom,  John</span>  (1814&#150;1897), <span class="occ">railway engineer</span>, was born at Todmorden, Lancashire, on 11 September 1814, the son of a cotton spinner who owned the only steam-driven mill in the area. He was educated by local schoolmasters and Baptist ministers. His practical training started at his father's mill, where he was given a lathe and built small working steam engines. He then rebuilt and re-erected the beam engine at his father's mill and invented the weft fork, later adopted universally, which enabled looms to be worked at high speed. He was an active and enthusiastic member of the Todmorden Mechanics' Institute, showing quick perception and ability in all mechanical matters.<br>
<br>About 1839 Ramsbottom went to Manchester and joined Sharp, Roberts &amp; Co., who already had a high reputation as builders of locomotives and cotton-spinning machinery. Here he gained experience in locomotive building and his ability sufficiently impressed Charles F. Beyer, who ran the locomotive department, that, in 1842, he recommended Ramsbottom as locomotive superintendent of the Manchester and Birmingham Railway; in 1846 the latter company became part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), of which Ramsbottom was then appointed district superintendent of the north-east division. In 1857 he was promoted to locomotive superintendent of the northern division, covering all routes of the LNWR north of Rugby, at Crewe works, where in the following year the first of almost 1000 of his DX 0&#150;6&#150;0 type freight locomotives were built. Some of these were still running over sixty years later. In 1859 he built the first of his 2&#150;2&#150;2 type express locomotives, two of which took part in the railway &#145;race&#146; between east- and west-coast companies from London to Edinburgh in 1888, and in 1863 he developed the 2&#150;4&#150;0 type for use over more heavily graded routes.<br>
<br>In 1862 Ramsbottom became all-line chief mechanical engineer of the LNWR, Britain's largest railway, with locomotive construction concentrated at Crewe works. His mechanical and organizing abilities were given full scope during the rapid development of these works, where he introduced Bessemer open-hearth steelmaking. In 1868 he installed Siemens-Martin furnaces. He reduced the number of individual locomotive types and standardized their components to the greatest possible extent; and new machine tools and equipment ensured accuracy in manufacture, and facilitated transfer of components within the works. The result was a more than twofold increase in the rate of locomotive production. He was the inventor of water pick-up troughs laid between the rails, whereby a scoop lowered into the trough from the locomotive or tender allowed additional water to be picked up while the train was running, thus making possible much longer non-stop runs. First applied in 1860, this was rapidly extended to most British and some American and French main-line railways. His other inventions included narrow spring piston rings (1852), tamper-proof safety valves (1856), and locomotive screw reverse (1858). In 1870, locomotive haulage replaced steel-rope haulage of trains up the steep gradient from Liverpool, and Ramsbottom designed ventilating extractor fans to remove foul air and smoke from the tunnel.<br>
<br>In 1871 Ramsbottom retired from the LNWR. In 1883 he became consulting engineer and in 1885 a director of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, where he was responsible for the design and construction of their Horwich locomotive works near Bolton and was chairman of the rolling-stock and locomotive workshop committees. He was also a director of Beyer, Peacock &amp; Co., locomotive builders, a firm in which his two sons held important positions.<br>
<br>A modest and kindly man, Ramsbottom took a great interest in technical education and was a governor of Owens College, Manchester, where, in 1873, he endowed the Ramsbottom scholarship for young men in the locomotive department of LNWR. He was a founder member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1847 and its president in 1870&#150;71. He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers from 1866 and in 1868 received the honorary degree of MEng from the University of Dublin. Ramsbottom died on 20 May 1897 at Fernhill, his home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, and was buried in Macclesfield cemetery.<br>
