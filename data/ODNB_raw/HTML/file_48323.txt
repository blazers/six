<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stevenson,  James Cochran</span>  (1825&#150;1905), <span class="occ">chemical manufacturer</span>, was born on 9 October 1825 in Glasgow, the eldest of the numerous children of James Stevenson (1786&#150;1866), a Glasgow cotton broker, and Jane Stewart, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Shannan, daughter of a Greenock merchant. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36289/', "John James Stevenson")</script> was a younger brother, while <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50711/', "Louisa Stevenson")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/46826/', "Flora Clift Stevenson")</script> were among his sisters. Stevenson was educated at Glasgow high school and the University of Glasgow. When he was eighteen, the whole family moved to South Shields, where his father became senior partner of the Jarrow Chemical Company, alkali manufacturers. It seems probable that there were business links between the elder Stevenson and the Tennant family, alkali manufacturers at St Rollox in Glasgow, who put up one sixth of the original &pound;36,000 capital for the Jarrow Chemical Company and were involved in other combined ventures. The Tennants set up their own alkali works at Hebburn-on-Tyne in 1863.<br>
<br>On the retirement of his father in 1854, Stevenson and one of his father's partners, John Williamson, took over management of the Jarrow Chemical Company. This was only one of dozens operating the Leblanc process to produce soda ash, acids, and bleach. Demand from the textile and paper industries was high and competition minimal; price agreements were the rule. Williamson and Stevenson managed the Jarrow company effectively. In 1855 they patented a revolving kiln to improve the efficiency of the production process. Within a few years it was the largest chemical company in England and, after the Tennant St Rollox works, the second largest in the United Kingdom. With Tennants, the Jarrow Chemical Company developed brine deposits on Teesside for salt and were involved with the Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Company, set up to mine pyrites in Spain to supply their need for sulphur. By the 1870s the Jarrow Chemical Company employed 1400 men and produced annual profits of around &pound;90,000, of which Stevenson's share was over &pound;20,000. As soon as the Solvay ammonia-soda process, licensed to Brunner and Mond in 1873, was developed as a practical alternative, the Leblanc producers came under heavy competitive pressure. In 1890 they merged their interests into the United Alkali Company to rationalize production. Stevenson, who had been very active in the merger negotiations, became a vice-chairman; almost all Leblanc plants, including his own, were closed down over the next few years.<br>
<br>Apart from his work in the chemical industry, Stevenson played an active part in public life on Tyneside. As a young man he campaigned for a River Tyne Improvement Commission to offset the growing needs of North and South Shields and Gateshead against Newcastle's traditional dominance. Appointed a life member of the commission from its establishment in 1850, and chairman for twenty years from 1880, Stevenson pressed for improvements to navigation and the establishment of dock and customs facilities at the mouth of the Tyne, often against the opposition of Newcastle interests.<br>
<br>Stevenson was closely involved with the civic life of South Shields; first elected to the council in 1862, he became successively alderman, mayor, and radical Liberal MP (1868&#150;95) and the borough's first freeman. He was instrumental in persuading the council to undertake major sanitation and road-widening schemes financed by municipal borrowing rather than implementing such works piecemeal out of current rate revenue as had been the practice. He was the first chairman of the chamber of commerce, colonel of the 3rd Durham artillery volunteers (1860&#150;87), and a JP. He was on the board of several local companies, notably Swan's Electric Light Company (of which he was the first chairman in 1881) and the Northern Press and Engineering Company, publishers of the <span class="italic">Shields Daily Gazette</span>, of which he became sole proprietor on his father's retirement. He was a member of the general council of the University of Glasgow and of the Institute of Chemistry.<br>
<br>Stevenson was a modest and retiring man, somewhat humourless and deeply religious. He was a Sunday school teacher and office bearer in the Laygate Presbyterian Church. He married on 31 October 1855 Elisa Ramsay, third daughter of Revd James Anderson DD, Presbyterian minister of Morpeth (a prominent follower of Dr Chalmers in the Disruption of 1843); they had five sons and seven daughters, including the politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48691/', "Hilda Runciman")</script>. Through his wife, Stevenson was linked to the Anderson shipowning family.<br>
<br>Stevenson's strong sense of public duty and commitment to his local community contrasted with his business activities as a Leblanc manufacturer. The process was noxious, producing foul smells and large quantities of industrial waste, which polluted the environment. Conditions of employment were harsh, typically with alternating 56 hour weeks of day shifts and 112 hour weeks of night shifts, and damaging to the health of workers. The Jarrow Chemical Company was, however, the first on Tyneside to grant a Saturday half-holiday.<br>
<br>On his retirement Stevenson moved to Eltham Court, Eltham, Kent, where he died on 11 January 1905. <span class="italic">The Times</span> obituarist reported that the news was received on Tyneside &#145;with great regret&#146; as he was &#145;highly esteemed&#146;.<br>
