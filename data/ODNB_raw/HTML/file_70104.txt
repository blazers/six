<span class="headword">Campion,  Mary Anne</span>  (<em>c.</em>1687&#150;1706), <span class="occ">singer and dancer</span>, was born of lowly parents, her father having possibly been a servant of William Cavendish, first duke of Devonshire. She displayed a precocious talent on the stage; aged eleven, she was a member of Christopher Rich's company and sang at a performance of <span class="italic">Phaeton</span> in March 1698. She sang at Drury Lane over the following seasons; in May 1699 she spoke the epilogue to the second part of <span class="italic">The Famous History of the Rise and Fall of Massaniello</span> and danced an entry, with Weaver and Cottin, in <span class="italic">The Pilgrim</span> on 6 July 1700. At her benefit at Drury Lane on 22 June 1703 she exhibited her range of talent, performing a duet with bass Richard Leveridge in &#145;a mad song&#146; by Henry Purcell, and other songs by John Weldon; dancing with De Ruel; and accompanying Visconti on the harpsichord in a performance of <span class="italic">Love's Contrivance</span>, presented for the entertainment of the king of Denmark's envoy  (<span class="italic">Daily Courant</span>, 22 June 1703). She was fluent in Italian. She occasionally performed at York Buildings, and she commanded good fees; in 1702 she was paid the considerable sum of &pound;3 4<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for performing Weldon's prize music composed to accompany Congreve's <span class="italic">The Judgment of Paris</span> at Lincoln's Inn Fields for the duke of Bedford. In July of that year another benefit for her was advertised at Drury Lane, in &#145;<span class="roman">Oronoko</span> &hellip; with several dances by Mrs Campion and others&#146;.<br>
<br>Campion's last public stage performance was probably on 14 March 1704, after which she retired at the behest of William Cavendish, first duke of Devonshire, whose fancy she had attracted. Installed in Bolton Street, Westminster, she and the duke, then in his sixties and already provided with a wife, sundry other mistresses, and their offspring, enjoyed a fecund relationship that brought them a daughter known as Mary Anne Cavendish. In early 1706 Campion contracted a severe fever, and she died on 19 May 1706. Devonshire buried her in his family church at Latimer, Buckinghamshire, where he set up a lavish tomb of freestone, black marble, and alabaster, celebrating at length her beauty and virtue. In her will, drawn up on 23 April, she left her house and all her valuables to create an income for her daughter when she reached twenty-one. The duke died in London on 18 August 1707, &#145;afflicted with dropsy, gout, the stone and repentence&#146;  (Highfill, Burnim &amp; Langhans, <span class="italic">BDA</span>, 32), but the probable falsity of this repentance occupied the first section of the scurrilous tract by John Dunton <span class="italic">The Hazard of a Death Bed Repentance</span> (1708):<blockquote>Had the Duke aggravated his lewdness with Miss Heneage, Miss Campion, etc., but more especially had he lamented having a bastard child when he had one foot in the grave &hellip; [a reference to Campion's unfortunate offspring] he should have detected and lamented his mean adultery of tempting an actress out of the Playhouse (I mean Mrs Anne Campion) and doating on her to that degree, as to erect a tomb to her memory in Latimer's Chancel, he disgraced himself by ordering a Latin epitaph to be set on the tomb of one of his concubines &hellip; erected a tomb to perpetuate the memory of a lewd strumpet. (Dunton, 24&#150;5)</blockquote>
