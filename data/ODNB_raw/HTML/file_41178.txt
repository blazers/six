<span class="headword">Horwood,  William</span>  (<em>c.</em>1430&#150;1484), <span class="occ">church musician and composer</span>, is of unknown parentage and upbringing. During 1458&#150;9 he was admitted to the Confraternity of St Nicholas, a guild of the clerks and professional musicians working in the parish and collegiate churches of the London region. In February 1461 he was appointed thence to Lincoln Cathedral, probably to introduce there the newly developing practices of choral polyphonic singing. However, he left Lincoln at Michaelmas 1461 and in 1462&#150;3 was readmitted to the Confraternity of St Nicholas; he served as its master during 1474&#150;5, in which year his wife, Agnes, also was admitted.<br>
<br>Later in 1475 Horwood returned to Lincoln Cathedral to occupy a newly created post of master of the music, which conferred responsibility for the direction of all performances of polyphony. His duties were to attend daily at Lady mass and the evening Marian antiphon; both were sung in the lady chapel by the choristers and the ablest vicars choral, and at the former he was both to sing and play the organ. For the choristers he was to provide a comprehensive musical training, extending to playing the organ and clavichord, and to all the styles of singing then current: plainsong, counterpoint improvised to plainsong, and &#145;pricksong&#146; (singing from the written notation of polyphony). In April 1483 he also became player of the principal cathedral organ, used on Sundays and major feasts at the major services sung by the full choir. His total emoluments placed him among the highest-paid professional church musicians of his day.<br>
<br>In music history Horwood is very important. He was a conspicuously able composer of that generation which, by adding bass and boy treble voices to the historic core of altos and tenors, created one of the most enduring of all resources for musical performance, namely the four-part chorus of soprano, alto, tenor, and bass voices. Three Marian votive antiphons (one incomplete) and an <i>alternatim</i> <span class="roman">Magnificat</span>, all for five unaccompanied voices, survive in the Eton choirbook of <i>c</i>.1502&#150;5 [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/theme/94452', "Composers of the Eton choirbook")</script>]. The experimental scoring and harmonic and cadential idioms of the <span class="italic">Salve regina</span> show it to be an early piece, dating perhaps from his London days. The remainder demonstrate Horwood's role in the establishment of the principal features of late fifteenth-century English style, especially its vocal scoring and its characteristic grandeur in terms of scale of composition, sonority of choral writing, and virtuosity of solo writing. A setting of a Lady mass <span class="roman">Kyrie</span> survives in a fragmentary state elsewhere.<br>
<br>At Lincoln Horwood dwelt within the cathedral close, and may have been of a somewhat irascible disposition, being fined in 1478&#150;9 for an assault on one of the chantry priests. In the same year he was also fined, as was his daughter Joan two years earlier, for brewing and selling ale that was in contravention of the law. He died early in 1484, probably in Lincoln. He was survived by his wife, and was buried in the cathedral nave south aisle.<br>
