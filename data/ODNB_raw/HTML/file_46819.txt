<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Clark,  William Stephens</span>  (1839&#150;1925), <span class="occ">shoe manufacturer and retailer</span>, was born on 22 February 1839 at Street in Somerset, the third of fourteen children of James C. Clark (1811&#150;1906), rug and shoe manufacturer of Street, and Eleanor, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Stephens (1812&#150;1879), of Bridport. He was educated at Sidcot School in Somerset (1848&#150;50), and then at Bootham's School, the Quaker foundation in York, until 1854.<br>
<br>William joined the family business in 1856 as an apprentice, quickly gaining a good understanding of the trade. Organized as a partnership between his father and his uncle, Cyrus, the company specialized in producing and marketing quality ready-made shoes at a time when much of the industry was still on a bespoke basis. With an output of 234,000 pairs in 1857, produced by a small factory workforce and a large number of outworkers, it was already one of the largest shoe manufacturing concerns in the country. Within a few years, however, poor financial practice put the company in serious difficulties and in 1863 Clark took control, successfully rescuing it and becoming a full partner in 1873. Between 1863 and 1903 Clark guided the fortunes of the C. and J. Clark business, saving it from bankruptcy to become a major company in the shoe industry in a location distant from the main midland centres of production. By 1903, when Clark retired, the company was employing some 1400 workers producing 870,000 pairs with a sales value of &pound;150,000, nearly a fivefold increase in production and a fourfold increase in money values since 1863.<br>
<br>As a businessman Clark was distinguished by his financial ability, working with others to establish proper accounting procedures. He established a separate company, Clark, Morland &amp; Son Ltd, for the remaining rug making business in 1870, under the direction of John Morland, the husband of his sister Mary. In 1877 he also created the Avalon Leather Board Company. Clark oversaw the gradual mechanization of shoe production in the main firm, starting with stitching and riveting, and leading to the almost complete elimination of outwork in favour of factory production at the start of the new century. In marketing terms he saw the continued advantage of an insistence on quality, durability, and solidity, and aimed to sell shoes to the more expensive end of the home market.<br>
<br>Foreign competition became fiercer towards the end of the nineteenth century and Clark, despite earlier misgivings, encouraged a proliferation of the product range as a strategy to defend market share. This policy was largely successful, although there were long-term disadvantages, and it allowed the company a production share of just under one per cent of British output&#151;a respectable size in a notoriously fragmented industry. In the light of problems created by his own father's and uncle's increasing rigidity in business he perhaps made a timely decision to relinquish control in favour of his son, John Bright Clark (1867&#150;1933), and to see the company acquire limited liability status.<br>
<br>Clark came from a strong Quaker family, and his connections helped him at a number of points in his career. In 1866 he married Helen Priestman Bright (1840&#150;1927), the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3421/', "John Bright")</script>; they had two sons and four daughters, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38517/', "Alice Clark (1874&#150;1934)")</script>, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/38518/', "Hilda Clark (1881&#150;1955)")</script>. His religious views led him to emphasize his direct social responsibilities to his workforce as an employer, and his indirect ones as a leading figure in the local community and county government. He encouraged home ownership among his workers and various local improvements including a library, and Crispin Hall for the local inhabitants to meet in. Such paternalism also had an economic benefit in a low-wage area where production was sometimes threatened by labour turnover and out-migration. However, he opposed trade union recognition for his workers during the period that he was in charge of the firm.<br>
<br>In politics Clark was a Liberal. Although he refused to stand for parliament, he and his wife supported Josephine Butler in her campaign against the <span class="roman">Contagious Diseases Acts</span>, and later they worked for women's suffrage. He was continuously active in local government from 1878 to 1922 as a leading councillor, alderman, and magistrate; he was also an important figure in the west of England temperance movement. As a Quaker he had a special interest in education, and became chairman of the central education committee of the Society of Friends. Clark died of a heart attack at his home, Millfield, Street, on 20 November 1925, and was buried at the burial-ground of the Friends' meeting-house in Street three days later. He was survived by his wife.<br>
