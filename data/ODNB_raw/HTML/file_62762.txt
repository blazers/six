<span class="headword">Drummond <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Keith]</span>,  Mary</span>, Countess Marischal  (1675&#150;1729), <span class="occ">Jacobite sympathizer</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/8070/', "James Drummond, fourth earl, and Jacobite first duke, of Perth (1648&#150;1716)")</script>, and his first wife, Lady Jane Douglas (<i>d</i>. 1678), the fourth daughter of William Douglas, first marquess of Douglas. According to the <span class="italic">Red Book of Grandtully</span> Mary (or Maria) was born in Scotland on 14 July 1675. About 1690 she married <a name="cosubject_75177"></a><span class="headword">William Keith</span>, ninth Earl Marischal  (<em>c.</em>1664&#150;1712), <span class="occ">Jacobite politician</span>, the son of George Keith, eighth Earl Marischal (<i>d</i>. 1694), army officer, and Lady Mary Hay (<i>d</i>. 1701), courtier and third daughter of the second earl of Kinnoull. The date of Lady Mary's marriage means that she did not accompany her father into exile for Jacobitism in 1693, though she would have witnessed the unpopularity which demanded that exile and his earlier imprisonment at Kirkcaldy between December 1688 and 1693.<br>
<br>William Keith succeeded to the earldom in March 1694. In politics an anti-union tory, he took the oaths to the <i>de facto</i> monarchy and his seat in the Scottish parliament in July 1698 and was sworn of the privy council in June 1701. Created a knight of the Thistle by James III (James Francis Edward Stuart) in 1705, his known Jacobite leanings led to his imprisonment in Edinburgh Castle during the rising of 1708 (when his father-in-law accompanied King James to Scotland) and to his being sent for trial in London in its aftermath. Notwithstanding, he was made one of the sixteen representative peers at Westminster in 1710 and remained so until his death in London on 27 May 1712. The earl founded, but did not endow, a chair of medicine at Marischal College, Aberdeen. John Macky described him in colourful terms which enrich his committed but sober political career:<blockquote>He is very wild, inconstant and passionate; does everything by starts; hath abundance of flashy wit, and by reason of his quality, hath good interest in the country; all Courts endeavour to have him at their side for he gives himself liberty of talking when he is not pleased with the Government. He is a thorough Libertine, yet sets up mightily for Episcopy; a hard drinker; a thin body; a middle stature; ambitious of popularity. (GEC, <span class="italic">Peerage</span>, 8.484)</blockquote>The marriage of Lady Mary and Lord Keith produced an heir, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15265/', "George Keith, later tenth and last Earl Marischal")</script>, a second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15267/', "James Francis Edward Keith")</script>, and two daughters: Mary (<i>d</i>. 1721), who married John, sixth earl of Wigtown, and Anne (<i>d</i>. 1728), who married Alexander, sixth earl of Galloway. As the name of her second son suggests, Lady Mary was a committed Jacobite throughout her life. She died on 7 March 1729 at Edinburgh and was buried at Holyrood Abbey. The ascription to her of the song &#145;When the king comes o'er the water&#146;, sometimes called &#145;Lady Keith's lament&#146;, has no solid foundation, and the song itself (printed in James Hogg's <span class="italic">Jacobite Relics</span> of 1817) has been dated to later in the eighteenth century. Consequently, while in her kinship networks and their combination of Roman Catholicism and Episcopalianism she is representative of the private sphere in which Jacobite sympathies were sustained among the Scottish &eacute;lite, her principal contribution to Jacobite history remains the parenthood of her soldier sons.<br>
