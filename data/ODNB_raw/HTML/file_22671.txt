<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Power,  (William Grattan) Tyrone</span>  (1797&#150;1841), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born near Kilmacthomas, co. Waterford, Ireland, on 2 November 1797. His father was a member of a well-to-do Waterford family, and died in America before Tyrone was a year old. His mother, Marie, the daughter of a Colonel Maxwell, who fell in the American War of Independence, settled, on her husband's death, in Cardiff, where she had a distant relative named Bird, a printer and bookseller. On the voyage from Dublin she and her son were wrecked off the Welsh coast, and narrowly escaped drowning. Power may have served an apprenticeship to Bird's business in Cardiff. Bird was printer to the local theatre, and seems to have introduced Power to the company of strolling players which, to the great grief of his mother, he joined in his fourteenth year. He was handsome and well made, and creditably filled the role of a &#145;walking gentleman&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1815 Power visited Newport, Isle of Wight, where he made his d&eacute;but as Alonzo in Sheridan's <span class="italic">Pizarro</span>, and where he also became engaged to Anne Gilbert (1798&#150;1876), the third daughter of John Gilbert of that town. He married her in 1817 when he was nineteen and she was a year younger. After appearing in various minor characters he undertook in 1818 at Margate the part of a comic Irishman, Looney Mactwoler, in Colman's <span class="italic">The Review</span>. His first attempt in the role, in which he was destined to make a great reputation, was a complete failure. Want of success as an actor led him at the end of the year, when his wife succeeded to a small fortune, to quit the stage. He sailed for the Cape of Good Hope in 1820 and spent twelve months ineffectively in South Africa, but returned to England and the stage in 1821. He made his first appearance at the English Opera House, London, in 1822, as Charles Austencourt in <span class="italic">Man and Wife</span>. In the same year he performed at the Olympic, of which he also became stage-manager for a while. He continued to obtain small engagements in the London theatres, and in 1824 made a second and somewhat successful attempt in Irish farce as Larry Hoolagan, a drunken scheming servant, in <span class="italic">The Irish Valet</span>. In 1826, while filling small roles at Covent Garden, his opportunity came. Charles Connor, the leading Irish comedian on the London stage, died suddenly of apoplexy in St James's Park on 7 October 1826. At the time he was fulfilling an engagement at Covent Garden. Power was allotted Connor's parts as Serjeant Milligan in <span class="italic">Returned Killed</span> and O'Shaughnessy in <span class="italic">The One Hundred Pound Note</span>. His success was immediate. Henceforth he confined himself to the delineation of Irish characters, such as Sir Lucius O'Trigger in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Rivals</span>, Dr O'Toole in <span class="italic">The Irish Tutor</span>, and Dennis Brulgruddery in Colman's <span class="italic">John Bull</span>, in which he is said by contemporary critics to have been superior to Connor, and at least the equal of John Henry Johnstone. He appeared at the Haymarket, Adelphi, and Covent Garden theatres, fulfilling long engagements at &pound;100 and &pound;120 a week, and he paid annual visits to the Theatre Royal, Dublin, where he was always received with boundless enthusiasm. Between 1833 and 1835 he made a tour of the principal American towns and cities, and repeated the visit in 1837 and 1838.<br>
<br>On his return to London after his first tour of America, Power published <span class="italic">Impressions of America</span> (2 vols., 1836). He had previously published three romances&#151;<span class="italic">The Lost Heir</span> (1830), <span class="italic">The Gipsy of Abruzzo</span> (1831), and <span class="italic">The King's Secret</span> (1831). He also wrote the Irish drama <span class="italic">St Patrick's Eve, or, The Orders of the Day</span> (1832); a comedy entitled <span class="italic">Married Lovers</span>; and the Irish farces <span class="italic">Born to Good Luck, or, The Irishman's Fortune</span>, <span class="italic">How to Pay the Rent</span>, <span class="italic">Paddy Carey, the Boy of Clogheen</span> (1833), and <span class="italic">O'Flannigan and the Fairies</span> (1836), all of which he produced himself.<br>
<br>Power's last appearance on the London stage was at the Haymarket on the evening of Saturday 1 August 1840, when he filled the roles of Captain O'Cutter in Colman's <span class="italic">The Jealous Wife</span>, Sir Patrick O'Plenipo ADC in Kenney's <span class="italic">The Irish Ambassador</span>, and Tim More (a travelling tailor) in <span class="italic">The Irish Lion</span>. He then paid a fourth visit to America, in order to look after some property he had purchased in Texas and &pound;3000 he had invested in the United States Bank, which had stopped payment. His performance at the Park Theatre, New York, on 9 March 1841, as Gerald Pepper and Morgan Rattler, was to be his last appearance on stage. On 11 March 1841 he left New York on the return voyage in the <i>President</i>, the largest steamer then afloat. There were 123 persons on board. The steamer was accompanied by the packet ship <i>Orpheus</i>, also bound for Liverpool. On the night of 12 March a storm rose and raged during the whole of Saturday the 13th. Before the break of dawn on Sunday the 14th the <i>President</i> disappeared, and no vestige of her was afterwards recovered. Power was forty-three years old at the date of the disaster. He left a widow and four sons and three daughters. His eldest son, Sir William Tyrone Power KCB, became for some time agent-general for New Zealand and was the author of various books of travel. His second son, Maurice, went on the stage, and died suddenly in 1849.<br>
<br>Tyrone Power was about 5 feet 8 inches in height; his form was light and agile, with a very animated and expressive face, light complexion, blue eyes, and brown hair. He was best in representations of blundering, good-natured, and eccentric Irish characters; but his exuberant, rollicking humour and his inexhaustible good spirits he infused into every comedy and farce, however indifferent, in which he acted.<br>
