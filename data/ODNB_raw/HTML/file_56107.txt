<span class="headword">Blackwood,  Hariot Georgina  Hamilton-Temple-</span>, marchioness of Dufferin and Ava  (1843&#150;1936), <span class="occ">vicereine of India</span>, was born on 5 February 1843, the eldest child of four sons and three daughters of Archibald Rowan-Hamilton (1818&#150;1860) of Killyleagh Castle, co. Down, in Ireland, and his wife, Catherine Anne (1820&#150;1919), daughter of the Revd George Caldwell. She married on 23 October 1862, in the drawing-room at Killyleagh Castle, Frederick Hamilton-Blackwood, fifth Baron Dufferin and Claneboye (1826&#150;1902) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/31914/', "Blackwood, Frederick Temple Hamilton-Temple-")</script>], who was elevated to the earldom of Dufferin in 1871 and became first marquess of Dufferin and Ava in 1888. They had three daughters and six sons. Theirs was a good-humoured and affectionate marriage. She was a child bride of innocence and beauty who seemed &#145;delicate but very gentle and pleasing&#146;  (<span class="italic">Later Letters of Lady Augusta Stanley</span>, 91). She matured into a strong, decisive woman with a magnificent presence. &#145;Of a reserved nature, she gave her love and confidence sparingly but, when she did, the recipient was rich indeed&#146;  (Chapman-Huston, 90).<br>
<br>Accompanying her husband to Canada in 1872, Lady Dufferin soon proved to be that rarity, a governor's wife who strengthened her husband's hand. Her popularity was probably unsurpassed among governor-generals' wives in Canada. She was resilient, zestful, attentive, shrewd, and kind, but never blas&eacute; or spoilt by her official experiences. Her dignity and devotion to duty were both as natural as they were undeviating. An intrepid traveller in rough or frightening conditions, her endurance and stoicism were formidable. In Canada, as in later postings, it was a distinct advantage that:<blockquote>she could spend the night in a rough country sledge, or sleep in her clothes on a truss of hay, and yet appear in the morning as fresh and neat, and spick and span, as though she had had the most elaborate toilet appliances at her disposal. (Hamilton, 122)</blockquote>She was very unhappy at leaving Canada on 31 August 1878.<br>
<br>In 1879&#150;81 Lady Dufferin was ambassadress at St Petersburg and in 1881&#150;4 at Constantinople. The Dufferins in all their embassies were celebrated for their hospitality and kindness, treating their staff with charming informality; visitors felt as if they were staying in a country-house party. Despite her shyness, she was a consummate actress in amateur theatricals: her lead in Sheridan's <span class="italic">The Critic</span> at Constantinople in 1881 was a particular success. Notwithstanding her Presbyterian upbringing, she had a great sense of fun and a feeling heart.<br>
<br>The Dufferins arrived in India as viceroy and vicereine in December 1884. Lady Dufferin took lessons in Hindustani and later in photography. An indefatigible organizer, traveller, and hostess, she most memorably used her energies to found the National Association for Supplying Female Medical Aid to the Women of India, often known as the Countess of Dufferin Fund, in 1885. Its purpose was to relieve the suffering by illness and child bearing of Indian women. Her plan was to recruit and train women doctors, nurses, and midwives to provide medical advice and attendance under conditions which respected patients' wishes. With gentle, persistent authority she presided over countless fund-raising meetings; by the time she left India her scheme had been adopted in every province, and there were Countess of Dufferin Fund hospitals and dispensaries for women in all the principal states. This great act of constructive charity was commemorated by Rudyard Kipling in his &#145;Song of the Women&#146;. She was depressed at leaving India, and the demonstrations of gratitude were unusually numerous and sincere. She was a great benefactor of Indian women, compassionate and uncondescending in her manner, whose initiative introduced Western ideas of hygiene and medicine into many parts of India: her work saved innumerable lives.<br>
<br>Accompanying her husband in his embassies to Italy and France, Lady Dufferin maintained her reputation as the most effective diplomatic wife of her generation. According to George I of Greece, &#145;there was no lady in Europe who could enter a room like Lady Dufferin&#146;  (Nicolson, 145). She retired with her husband to Clandeboye in co. Down in 1896, although for much of her long widowhood she lived in a small house in Tedworth Square, Chelsea. Her sons were always short of money, and she made selfless economies to relieve their burdens.<br>
<br>Lady Dufferin published her letters to her mother in the form of journals: <span class="italic">Our Viceregal Life in India</span> (2 vols., 1889), <span class="italic">My Canadian Journal</span> (1891), and <span class="italic">My Russian and Turkish Journals</span> (1916). Her books focus on ceremonials, journeys, and festivities rather than high policy, but are vivid, picturesque, and amusing. They establish her near the forefront of nineteenth-century women travel writers. She savoured the ridiculous, but curbed her satiric powers in public. Her unpublished correspondence is often as fluent and elegant as her books. Lady Dufferin received the Crown of India (1884) and the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert (1889), and was created DBE in 1917. The Ottoman sultan and shah of Persia respectively bestowed on her the grand cross of the Chefakat (1883) and the order of the Lion and the Sun (1887).<br>
<br>Lady Dufferin outlived her six sons and her eldest daughter: Archibald, the eldest son, was killed in the South African War in 1900; Terence died of pneumonia in 1918; the third son, Sydney, died shortly after birth, on 29 May 1867; the fourth, Ian, died similarly, on 6 August 1868; Basil was killed in action in 1917; and Frederick, the youngest, was lost in an aviation accident in 1930. The eldest daughter, Helen, Viscountess Novar, died in 1930; Lady Dufferin's two younger daughters survived her. The marchioness died of arteriosclerosis and heart failure on 25 October 1936 at her home in 4 Wellesley House, Sloane Square, Chelsea, and was buried on 28 October at Clandeboye.<br>
