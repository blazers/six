<span class="headword">Walker, Sir  James</span>  (1809&#150;1885), <span class="occ">colonial governor</span>, the son of Andrew Walker of Edinburgh, was born at Edinburgh on 9 April 1809, and educated at the high school and the university there. After entering the Colonial Office as a junior clerk in 1826 he served under several secretaries of state, and on 11 February 1837 he became registrar of British Honduras, from where he was transferred on 18 February 1839 to be treasurer of Trinidad; here he acted as colonial secretary from June 1839 to September 1840. On 15 October 1839 Walker married Anne, the daughter of George Bland of Trinidad. They had a son and three daughters.<br>
<br>In January 1841 Walker became secretary to Sir Henry Macleod, special commissioner to British Guiana, for the purpose of settling the difficulties with the legislature over the civil list. In 1842 he was appointed colonial secretary of Barbados. This colony was at that time the seat of the government for the Windward Islands, and during his service there Walker was sent in September 1856 to act as lieutenant-governor of Grenada and in 1857 to fill a similar position at St Vincent. He acted as governor of Barbados and the Windward Islands from 13 March to 25 December 1859, and as lieutenant-governor of Trinidad from 20 April 1860 to 25 March 1862, when he was appointed governor-in-chief of Barbados and the Windward Islands. A careful official rather than an able administrator, he became a CB in 1860 and KCMG in 1869. On 4 January 1869 he was transferred to the Bahamas, which were then going through a time of severe financial depression. He retired on a pension of &pound;400 on 3 May 1871, and lived a quiet country life, first at Uplands, near Taunton, and later at Southerton, Ottery St Mary, Devon, where he died on 28 August 1885. Walker's son, Sir Edward Noel-Walker, was lieutenant-governor and colonial secretary of Ceylon.<br>
