<span class="headword">Cornish,  Charles John</span>  (1858&#150;1906), <span class="occ">naturalist and journalist</span>, was born on 28 September 1858 at Salcombe House, near Sidmouth, the residence of his grandfather, Charles John Cornish JP DL. He was the eldest son of Charles John Cornish (1834&#150;1913), then curate of Sidbury, Devonshire, and his first wife, Anne Charlotte Western (1831&#150;1887); the geographer <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/32573/', "Vaughan Cornish")</script> was his brother. He was brought up at Debenham, Suffolk, where his father became vicar in 1859. In 1872 he entered Charterhouse School as a gownboy, and left in 1876. After receiving private tuition, he entered Hertford College, Oxford, as a commoner in 1881, and was elected Brunsell exhibitioner in 1882, and Lusby scholar in 1883. He obtained his blue in association football, a second class in classical moderations in 1883, and a second class in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1885. After leaving Oxford he was appointed assistant classics master at St Paul's School, London, a post which he held until his death. In 1893 he married Edith, eldest daughter of Sir John I. Thornycroft FRS, and they had one daughter. In 1896 he founded the school field club.<br>
<br>Soon after going to London Cornish started to write occasional articles on natural history and country life. In 1890 he became a regular contributor to <span class="italic">The Spectator</span>, and, later, to <span class="italic">Country Life</span>; many of his articles reappeared in book form. The work for which he was best known was <span class="italic">Life at the Zoo</span> (1895); his final work, <span class="italic">Animal Artisans and other Studies of Birds and Beasts</span>, was published posthumously in 1907 with a prefatory memoir by his widow.<br>
<br>Cornish's country tastes and love of shooting and fishing were fostered by his father, in whose family they were traditional. His artistic and literary gifts he inherited from his mother. His powers of observation were unusually keen and rapid, his memory remarkably good, and he had vivid powers of expression. His literary energy, which continued through twenty years, stimulated public interest in natural history and country life, and helped to give these subjects an assured place in English journalism. He died at 114 Marine Parade, Worthing, Sussex, on 30 January 1906, from an illness originating in an accident he suffered when shooting, many years before. After cremation his ashes were interred at Salcombe Regis, near Sidmouth, and a mural tablet to his memory was placed in the parish church.<br>
