<span class="headword">Stark,  William</span>  (1770&#150;1813), <span class="occ">architect</span>, was born on 25 May 1770 in Dunfermline, Fife, one of the three sons and two daughters of Mark Stark of Kirkhill, Lasswade, Edinburghshire, a Glasgow merchant who had established spinning and beetling mills, and his wife, Margaret Paton. An elder sister, Sarah, had in 1787 married the Glasgow architect John Craig, and it may have been his brother-in-law who provided Stark's initial professional training. He married Catherine, sister of George Thomson, collector of Scottish music, and daughter of Robert Thomson, schoolmaster. They had one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1798 Stark was in St Petersburg with his elder brother, who died there. He returned some time before 1804 to Glasgow, where family connections enabled him to compete successfully against David Hamilton for the Hunterian Museum at the university. Square on plan and domed, its Roman Doric portico was by far the grandest then built in Scotland. In the following year, 1805, he designed for Greenock a domed school with a Greek Doric portico, and in 1808 a French neo-classical scheme with Greek Doric porticoes for the enlargement of Broomhall, Dunfermline, for Thomas Bruce, seventh earl of Elgin, both of which remained on paper.<br>
<br>In 1807 Stark designed the lunatic asylum in Glasgow, in which he adapted Benthamite prison planning to contemporary theories on the segregation of patients by sex, rank, and degree of derangement. Built in 1810&#150;11, it was a memorable exercise in neo-classical geometry, comprising four residential blocks radiating from a central drum of day-rooms crowned by a tall glass dome over the stairwell at its core. Stark published the plans in the form of a pamphlet, subsequently developed into <span class="italic">Remarks on the Construction of Public Hospitals for the Cure of Mental Derangement</span> (1810), which resulted in the building's cruciform planning being widely adopted. In his later asylums at Gloucester (1811) and Dundee (1812) Stark himself adopted markedly less institutionalized concepts, the former being planned as a crescent set in gardens and the latter as a domestically scaled rural farm.<br>
<br>Although Stark, uniquely at that date, had experimented with a severe part Wren, part Russian neo-baroque at the steeple of his St George's Church, Glasgow (1807), his next major design, the Greek Doric judiciary buildings in Glasgow's Saltmarket (built in 1810&#150;11), established his reputation as the pioneer of the Greek revival in Scotland. Internally its main court, a Doric colonnaded hemicycle, drew inspiration from the rebuilding of Chester Castle by Thomas Harrison.<br>
<br>By 1811 Stark was in bad health and on medical advice left Glasgow for Edinburgh, where the writers to the signet and the Faculty of Advocates commissioned him to redesign their libraries (later both occupied by the signet) for which the carcass had already been erected by Robert Reid. In these he brilliantly overcame the problems set by Reid's window levels to create colonnaded interiors worthy of imperial Russia.<br>
<br>When he died, Stark's career was on the brink of still greater success, since his posthumously published report on the plans for Edinburgh's Calton area, in which he advocated attention to contours rather than the imposition of grid plans, had a profound effect on Edinburgh's town planning. Sir Walter Scott, for whom Stark designed &#145;an English vicarage house&#146; for Abbotsford, lamented that in him &#145;more genius died than is left behind among the collected universality of Scottish architects&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters of Sir Walter Scott</span>, ed. H. J. C. Grierson, 8 vols., 1932&#150;5, 3.368). Stark died in Drumsheugh, Edinburgh, where he lived, on 9 October 1813, and was buried in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh.<br>
