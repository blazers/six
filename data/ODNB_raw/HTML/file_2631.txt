<span class="headword">Bleek,  Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel</span>  (1827&#150;1875), <span class="occ">philologist</span>, was born at Berlin on 8 March 1827, the first of six sons and four daughters of Friedrich Bleek (1793&#150;1859), professor of theology at Berlin University, and from 1829 at Bonn University, and his wife, Augusta Charlotte Marianne Henriette, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sethe (<i>d</i>. 1873). He was educated in Bonn, and then studied theology at Bonn University from 1845 to 1848. When he went to study Hebrew at Berlin for two terms in 1848&#150;9 he developed an interest in African languages. He returned to Bonn and until 1851 studied theology and philosophy. His doctoral thesis, &#145;De nominum generibus linguarum Africae australis, Copticae, Semiticarum aliarumque sexualium&#146;, dealt with grammatical gender, and attributed a north African provenance to Khoi (Hottentot). Also in 1851 he translated into German a work on the Akra language (1828) by Rasmus Rask. In 1852 he studied with the famous Egyptologist Professor Carl Richard Lepsius, and adopted his phonetic script. Late in 1852, in pursuit of African language studies, he was in Berlin, where Professor Wilhelm K. H. Peters (1815&#150;1883), who had been in east Africa in 1842&#150;8, gave him his African languages material to edit.<br>
<br>During a visit to England in 1853, or early 1854, Bleek met Dr William Balfour Baikie RN, and joined his expedition up the Niger and Isadda, as linguist and ethnographer. They left from Liverpool in May 1854, but Bleek was obliged by an attack of fever to turn back at Fernando Po, and by August was again in London. There he was introduced to Sir George Grey, recently appointed governor of Cape Colony, and to J. W. Colenso, first bishop of Natal. In November Bleek accepted Colenso's offer of work on the completion of a Zulu grammar, and in May 1855 arrived with the bishop in Natal. There, as recorded in his diaries (1855&#150;6), he used a small German grant to travel widely, learned Zulu (and later Xhosa), visited the Zulu king, Mpande, made first-hand studies of &#145;Kaffir&#146; language and culture, and published <span class="italic">The Languages of Mozambique</span> (1856). He contributed articles to Peterman's <span class="italic">Geographische Mitteilungen</span> (1855&#150;7) and edited the <span class="italic">Natal Witness</span> to earn money. He met several missionaries who had useful material on African languages. In Durban he met Archdeacon W. H. C. Lloyd, but probably did not meet his daughter, Jemima Charlotte Lloyd (1837&#150;1909), until March 1861.<br>
<br>In 1856 Sir George Grey invited Bleek to become his official interpreter, and in November he moved to Cape Town. Sir George put him in charge of his valuable collection of books and manuscripts, mainly on philology and ethnography, which Bleek catalogued in <span class="italic">The Library of H. E. Sir George Grey</span> (vols. 1&#150;2, 1858&#150;9; vol. 3, 1862; vol. 4, 1867). When Grey was appointed to New Zealand in 1861, the new governor, Sir Philip Wodehouse, cancelled Bleek's post as interpreter. Fortunately, Sir George wrote from New Zealand, leaving his collection to the public library in Cape Town on condition that Bleek be made curator, a post he held from August 1862 until his death. This appointment, worth &pound;250 per annum, enabled him on 22 November 1862 to marry Jemima Lloyd, and they set up house in Mowbray, a suburb of Cape Town. They had a son and six daughters, the son and one daughter dying in infancy. To raise money Bleek wrote ephemeral articles for the <span class="italic">Volksblad</span> of Cape Town. In 1863 he supported his friend Bishop Colenso in his celebrated trial for &#145;heresy&#146;.<br>
<br>Ill health and financial worries prevented Bleek from undertaking the major African expeditions he had originally planned. Instead he produced his major work, <span class="italic">A Comparative Grammar of South African Languages</span> (pt 1, <span class="italic">Phonology</span>, 1862; pt 2, <span class="italic">The Concord</span>, section 1, <span class="italic">The Noun</span>, 1869). In this pioneering work he clearly distinguished the two language families of sub-Saharan Africa: on the one hand the Bantu or B&acirc;ntu languages (a term he introduced), which extend in a vast swathe from west Africa through the Cameroons to south Africa, and on the other the Bushman (San) group, with their distinctive &#145;clicks&#146;, and the possibly related Hottentot (Khoi) group.<br>
<br>As early as 1857 Bleek visited Bushmen imprisoned on Robben Island and in the Cape Town gaol, where he tested a Bushman vocabulary he had received from a Dr Lichtenstein. The Bushmen, as hunter-gatherers, had come in conflict with the settlers and herdsmen, white and black, who encroached on their territories, killing game. When Bushmen retaliated by stealing or killing cattle, the settlers either shot them down or enslaved them. Governors of Cape Colony faced settler demands for punitive forays, or annexation, as opposed to Westminster's policy on human rights, and its aversion to costly campaigns and imperial adventures. Bleek sided with the pro-Bushman white missionaries who supplied him with valuable linguistic material, and in 1866 made further visits to Bushmen in prison.<br>
<br>Bleek's publications in the 1860s included <span class="italic">Reynard the Fox in South Africa, or, Hottentot Fables and Tales</span> (London, 1864; Weimar, 1870), based mainly on material from G. Kronlein. His brief work on the origin of language, <span class="italic">&Uuml;ber den Ursprung der Sprache</span>, had a Darwinian approach. This was first published privately in 1867 in Cape Town and Jena, and then with a preface by his cousin Ernst Haeckel in Weimar in 1868. It received an English translation in 1869 in New York.<br>
<br>In 1867 an economic depression in Cape Colony led to a 16 per cent reduction in Bleek's salary, and in addition to problems in funding and publishing his work he was still in poor health. This took him for a few months in 1869 to Europe, where he visited German relatives and was at the funeral of his brother Johann Friedrich. In England, through the influence of Sir George and other distinguished academics, he was awarded in 1870 a queen's civil-list pension of &pound;150 p.a.<br>
<br>In 1870 Bleek visited twenty-eight North Cape /Xam Bushmen in Breakwater prison, and was allowed to install several of them in his home, including an older man, //Kabbo 
    (Dream or Old Jantje; <i>d</i>. 1876)
  , who had a wealth of Bushman stories. Bleek now concentrated increasingly on his Bushman studies, intent on recording this dying race, and in this he was helped increasingly by his sister-in-law <a href="#cosubject_73892">Lucy Catherine Lloyd [<i>see below</i>]</a>, who had joined the household shortly after his marriage. He issued two reports: <span class="italic">Report of Dr. Bleek Concerning his Researches into the Bushman Language</span> (Cape of Good Hope, 1873) and <span class="italic">Second report concerning Bushman researches &hellip; presented to both houses of parliament of the Cape of Good Hope</span> (London and Cape Town, 1875). In the latter he refers to 7200 half-pages of Bushman literature and 11,000 entries to a Bushman&#150;English English&#150;Bushman dictionary. Bleek's numerous articles in the <span class="italic">Cape Monthly Magazine</span> included &#145;Scientific reasons for the study of the Bushman language&#146; (new ser., 7, September 1873, 149&#150;53). By 1874, when George William Stow, a trader and geologist, sent Bleek some of his copies of Bushman rock paintings, Bleek and Lloyd were fluent in their /Xam Bushmen's language, and, using these paintings as a talking point, deepened their understanding of Bushman stories and culture.<br>
<br>Early in 1875 Bleek was again unwell, but continued to work. He died suddenly at Charlton House, Mowbray, of a long-established disease of the lungs, on the morning of 17 August 1875, and was buried in the nearby Anglican cemetery at Wynberg.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_73892"></a><span class="headword">Lucy Catherine Lloyd</span>  (1834&#150;1914), <span class="occ">philologist and folklorist</span>, was born on 7 November 1834 at Norbury, Staffordshire, England, the second eldest daughter of William Henry Cymric Lloyd, rector of St Peter's Church, and his wife, Lucy Anne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Jeffreys. When Lucy was eight her mother died, and she and her three sisters went to live with their maternal aunt, Mrs Caroline Dundas, and were privately educated. When William Lloyd was appointed colonial chaplain for Natal in 1849 Lucy and her sisters accompanied him, along with his second wife and family, to Natal.<br>
<br>A short career as a schoolteacher was ended by ill health, and after her sister Jemima married Wilhelm Bleek in 1862, Lucy joined their household at Mowbray, Cape Town, and helped Bleek with his language studies. She proved an able pupil, and, with Bleek's ill health and increasing deafness, became indispensable in work with the Bushman informants. Some two-thirds of the Bushman transcripts are hers. In a codicil to his will, dated 30 June 1871, Bleek entrusted his posthumous papers to Lucy Lloyd, gratefully acknowledged her help in his literary labours, and asked her to continue their joint Bushman studies, &#145;in which her quicker ear, and great industry has been of so important help to science&#146;. He urged his scientific colleagues to assist her financially.<br>
<br>After Bleek's death Lucy appealed to his associates in Europe for financial support in the expenses of Bushman research. She continued the work with the /Xam Bushmen informants, especially with //Kabbo's son-in-law, /Han&ne;kass'o, &#145;an excellent narrator of Bushmen lore&#146;  (Lloyd, <span class="italic">Short Account</span>, 3), studied Bushman music and drawings, and collected material on other Bushman languages, including !Kora and !Kung. She succeeded Bleek as curator of the Grey collection, but at half salary. She was secretary of the South African Folklore Society, and in 1879 helped to establish the <span class="italic">Folklore Journal</span>. When she was given her notice as curator in 1880, in favour of a professional, Dr J. T. Hahn, she sought legal remedy, but the case dragged on, and Hahn was appointed. When he had to resign in 1883, having proved ineffective, Lloyd was not reappointed. When G. W. Stow died in 1882 she bought his copies of rock paintings, but lacked the funds to publish them.<br>
<br>Overworked and in poor health, Lucy left south Africa about 1887, and, after some time at Rhyl in Wales, joined Jemima and her daughters, who had moved to Berlin. Her work is recorded in <span class="italic">A Short Account of Further Bushman Material Collected</span> (1889). In 1904 Jemima and her daughters returned to South Africa, where Lucy joined them about 1906 and resumed her work, assisted by her niece <a href="#cosubject_73891">Dorothea Frances Bleek [<i>see below</i>]</a>. Together with Dorothea's sister Edith, they saw through the press <span class="italic">Specimens of Bushman Folklore</span> (1911). This contained English translations of a selection of the Bushman stories, and the verbatim /Xam and !Kung transcripts as recorded between 1870 and 1884.<br>
<br>In 1913 Lucy Lloyd received an honorary doctorate of literature from the University of the Cape of Good Hope, the first woman in South Africa so to be honoured. She died on 31 August 1914 at Charlton House, Mowbray, Cape Town, and was buried in Wynberg cemetery.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_73891"></a><span class="headword">Dorothea Frances Bleek</span>  (1873&#150;1948), <span class="occ">philologist and folklorist</span>, was born on 26 March 1873, at The Hill, Mowbray, Cape Town, the sixth child of Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Bleek and Jemima Charlotte, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Lloyd (1837&#150;1909). She was two and a half when her father died. In 1883 Jemima took her five daughters to Europe, where Dorothea attended schools in Germany and Switzerland. She then trained as a teacher in Berlin, took a course in African languages at Berlin University, and attended the school of oriental languages in London.<br>
<br>In 1904 Dorothea returned to Africa and taught at Rocklands Girls' High School in Cradock until 1907. With a colleague, Helen Tongue, she visited Bushman rock paintings, and Helen's copies were exhibited in London in 1908. Some of these paintings, with notes by Dorothea and her sister Edith, were published in 1909. Back in Africa, Dorothea devoted herself to further studies of Bushman life and languages, and assisted her aunt Lucy Lloyd until the latter's death. She then edited much of the research left by her father and Lucy. She made many expeditions to study Bushman dialects and rock art, and visited the Kalahari, Bechuanaland, Angola, and modern Tanzania, taking many photographs of shelter, weapons, and dress. In 1928 Dorothea visited the original sites of sixty of the seventy-four copies of rock paintings by Stow, which she had inherited from Lucy Lloyd, and published them with descriptive notes in 1930. Besides /Xam, she studied other Bushman languages.<br>
<br>From 1923 to 1948 Dorothea was honorary reader in Bushman languages at the University of Cape Town. She published her important collection of /Xam folk-tales, <span class="italic">The Mantis and his Friends</span> (1923, 1930), and articles on the customs and beliefs of the /Xam Bushmen in <span class="italic">Bantu Studies</span>, parts 1&#150;8 (1931&#150;6). In the introduction to <span class="italic">The Mantis</span> (a trickster deity) she writes:<blockquote>The Bushman is a good lover and a good hater, very loyal and very revengeful. He remains all his life a child, averse to work, fond of play, of painting, singing, dancing, dressing up and acting, above all things fond of hearing and telling stories.</blockquote>Her <span class="italic">Bushman Dictionary</span> (published posthumously in 1956) incorporated the lexicon of her father and Lucy Lloyd.<br>
<br>In 1936 the University of the Witwatersrand wished to confer on Dorothea an honorary doctorate, but she declined, reputedly saying that there could be only one Dr Bleek. She died on 27 June 1948 at Plumstead, Cape Province.<br>
