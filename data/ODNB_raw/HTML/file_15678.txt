<span class="headword">Kirkstall,  Hugh  of</span>  (<em>c.</em>1165&#150;<em>c.</em>1227), <span class="occ">Cistercian monk and chronicler</span>, was the author of the <span class="italic">Narratio de fundatione</span> of Fountains Abbey, and probable author of the foundation history of Kirkstall Abbey. Both these Cistercian houses were in Yorkshire. The <span class="italic">Narratio</span> contains two references to Hugh; he names himself in his address to Abbot John of Fountains (1203&#150;11), and states that he received the habit at the hands of Abbot Ralph Haget of Kirkstall in the third year of his abbacy, and lived under his rule for seven years. This places Hugh's entry into the monastic life <i>c</i>.1184, and implies his birth not later than <i>c</i>.1165. Although he is not named as the author of the Kirkstall history, which was completed shortly after <i>c</i>.1204 and which survives in Bodl. Oxf., MS Laud misc. 722, similarities between portions of this and the <span class="italic">Narratio</span> make it likely; and it may have been on the basis of his earlier work that Abbot John commissioned Hugh to write an account of the origins of Fountains. The <span class="italic">Narratio</span>, begun <i>c</i>.1205&#150;6 and completed <i>c</i>.1227, is a much longer and more ambitious work. It purports to be the reminiscences, committed to writing by Hugh, of the aged monk Serlo, who had been educated at St Mary's Abbey, York, had entered religion at Fountains <i>c</i>.1137, and been one of the party that colonized Kirkstall in 1147. Certainly the description of events up to 1147, especially the career of Abbot Richard (II) and the fire at Fountains Abbey, is vivid. However, after 1190&#150;91 when Ralph Haget moved from Kirkstall to become abbot of Fountains, it was Hugh himself who became the eyewitness.<br>
<br>But Hugh's <span class="italic">Narratio</span> was much more than personal testimony. In addition to Serlo's and his own recollections, Hugh had access to, and used, archival material&#151;charters, possibly an early register of the abbey, and letters, including those of St Bernard and Archbishop Thurstan&#151;and also literary models. The latter appear to have been mostly Cistercian&#151;the Byland foundation history, which predated that of Kirkstall by just a few years, and more especially the <span class="italic">Exordium parvum</span>. A Cistercian audience would not have failed to recognize the similarities that Hugh conveys between the foundation of Fountains and that of C&icirc;teaux itself. The <span class="italic">Narratio</span> survives in only one medieval manuscript (Trinity College, Cambridge, Gale MS O.I.79), evidently an incomplete copy of the original, and the text was revised in the last half of the fifteenth century to produce a different recension. The literary merits of the <span class="italic">Narratio</span> are generally considered to be few. However, in it Hugh of Kirkstall vividly evokes the spirit and spirituality of the great age of Cistercian monasticism in the north of England.<br>
