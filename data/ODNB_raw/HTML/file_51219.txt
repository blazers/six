<span class="headword">Markus <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Scharfstein]</span>,  Erika <span class="st"> [Rixi]</span></span>  (1910&#150;1992), <span class="occ">bridge player and writer</span>, was born on 27 June 1910 in Gura Humora, then in the Austro-Hungarian empire (but now in Romania), the youngest daughter of Michael and Louise Scharfstein, a prosperous Jewish couple with interests in forests and vineyards. After the First World War the family moved to Vienna, where Rixi (as she became known) was educated in music, literature, and the theatre. She learned from one aunt to play poker, and from an uncle in the Netherlands to play whist at ten and bridge (<i>plafond</i>) at thirteen; she had natural card-playing sense. Her parents did not approve, but after attending finishing-school in Dresden (Frau Wallenstein's <i>Pensionat</i> for Jewish daughters of good families) she took up bridge in Vienna and was regarded as a prodigy.<br>
<br>Through bridge Rixi met Salomon Markus. Twice her age, and in the shoe business, &#145;Salo&#146; first admired her ability but soon resented her success, objecting to her playing in coffee houses, surrounded by men. Rixi married him in 1928, partly to remain in Vienna after her parents moved to Berlin, but equally to continue playing. Marriage proved a complete disaster (the only mistake to which Rixi would admit). Pregnant at nineteen (her only daughter was born in 1929), she fell seriously ill. This ruined any chance of an active career and led her to become a professional bridge player in 1934.<br>
<br>Rixi caught the attention of Dr Paul Stern, who invited her to join the Austrian women's team, in defiance of her husband's will. Partnered by Ethel Ernst, she won the first European women's championship (Brussels, 1935) and the second (Stockholm, 1936), then the world women's championship (Budapest, 1937), her team remaining unbeaten in international play. The Anschluss ruined her plans for Oslo in 1938. She left for England, where her parents had moved in 1936, as Hitler entered Vienna. Her husband followed, but the marriage was dissolved in 1942. An elder sister, living in Poland, died in a concentration camp. Salomon Markus later became a millionaire property developer in Austria, and her daughter Margo led a glamorous life in America but died in 1976 from cancer, aged forty-six. Rixi had many affairs, including a thirteen-year alliance with <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/58077/', "(Norman) Harold Lever, Baron Lever (1914&#150;1995)")</script>, millionaire lawyer, Labour cabinet minister, and a bridge player of international class; but she never remarried.<br>
<br>Bridge offered Rixi an entry into society, through Lady Rhodes, Manning Foster, and other influential figures. During the Second World War she was a fire-watcher and translator for the Red Cross. Naturalized in 1950, she played for Britain, partnering Doris Rhodes in the ladies' team which won the European championship in 1951 (Venice) and 1952 (Ireland), and toured the USA in 1953. Her partnership with <a href="#cosubject_51053">Fritzi Gordon [<i>see below</i>]</a> began in 1951 when Sidney Lee, trailing Denmark in the final, successfully reshuffled his pairings. Universally known as Frisky and Bitchy for their free-wheeling style and willingness to confide to all that the other was &#145;a selfish bitch&#146;  (<span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, 6 April 1992), the pair were a formidable partnership which often disintegrated, but both recognized the special chemistry that made them the top women's pairing of all time. Rixi's highlights included winning the European women's championship (1951, 1952, 1959, 1961, 1963, 1966, mostly with Fritzi); the gold cup (1961); the world women's pairs (1962, 1974); the world mixed teams of four (1962, with Nico Gardener); the women's team Olympiad (1964); and the inaugural European bridge cup (1974&#150;5). Rixi had numerous victories in the spring foursomes and masters pairs, and the Whitelaw, Lady Milne, Queen's, and Hubert Phillips cups. With over 100 international and national titles, she was the outstanding woman player of her day; but Fritzi was close behind.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_51053"></a><span class="headword">Friederike <span class="st"> [Fritzi]</span> Gordon <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Leist]</span></span>  (1906&#150;1992), <span class="occ">bridge player</span>, was born in Vienna on 25 January 1906 (she claimed 1916), of middle-class Jewish parents. She worked as a buyer for a Salzburg store before marrying Paul Gordon and moving to Graz. After the Anschluss she fled to London and supported her family through playing poker. Paul Gordon was an excellent bridge player, and her brother Hans Leist a gold cup winner. Fritzi represented Britain fifteen times in the women's European championship, winning seven gold medals. She shared many of Rixi's triumphs, notably in the world women's pairs (1962, 1974), mixed team Olympiads (1962, with Boris Schapiro), and women's team Olympics (1964&#151;Britain's only Olympiad successes). She twice won the gold cup (1957, 1961), and was the second woman to attain world grandmaster status, Rixi being the first. Their last major tournament together was the Monte Carlo Olympiad (1976). Survived by one daughter, Fritzi died on 9 February 1992 in the Royal Free Hospital, Camden.<br>
<br>Despite their similar backgrounds, the two were not friends, sharing only their bridge skills, a tigerish appetite for success, and a knack for disconcerting opponents. Rixi was regarded as friendly away from the table, but intolerably aggressive at play, preferring to be respected and feared rather than liked. She disliked artificial bidding, advocating a simple system with a strong NT and CAB responses to 2C and relying on flair and technique. Her slogan was &#145;Bid boldly, play safe&#146;, which became the title of her first and best book (1966). Her &#145;Rixi bids&#146;, as Terence Reese christened them, were notorious: intuitive leaps to &#145;lucky&#146; contracts (&#145;Soaring fancy, wild illogicality and comical resource&#146;), which were, she insisted, the outcome of inexorable logic plus aggression, with the thrill of danger. She had a photographic memory, and an uncanny sixth sense. As a woman respected in a man's world she often scorned the abilities of other women.<br>
<br>Rixi contributed regular columns to <span class="italic">The Guardian</span> (1955&#150;92) and the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> (1975&#150;80), many syndicated widely. She was a contributing editor to <span class="italic">The Bridge Player's Encyclopedia</span> (1967). She regularly organized the <span class="italic">Guardian</span> Easter tournament, the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> charity congress (August), and the <span class="italic">Harpers &amp; Queen</span> festival (December); and she initiated the annual Lords v. Commons challenge match. The author of a dozen books (the early ones written with the assistance of Derek Senior), she at first offered excellent analysis, then tended to recycle her <span class="italic">Guardian</span> gossip or simply present hands. Some she translated into German. <span class="italic">Aces and Places</span> (1972) and <span class="italic">Bridge around the World</span> (1977) reflect the international circuit, from St Moritz in January to Marrakesh in December, offering insights into the foibles of the rich and famous but too often name-dropping and excessively promoting her own interests. In her memoirs, <span class="italic">A Vulnerable Game</span> (1988), a minor classic without a single bridge hand, she discusses her life and interests in ballroom dancing, gourmet cooking, music, theatre, and sport.<br>
<br>Rixi Markus received many honours. She won five world titles and four Olympic gold medals, ten European championships, and a gold medal from the European Bridge League as best ladies' player (1959); she was recognized by the World Bridge Federation as best woman player (1972) and first woman grandmaster (1974), and was named &#145;bridge personality of the year&#146; by the International Press Association (1974) and Charles Goren player of the year (1976); and she was awarded the Common Market medal of honour and, prized above all, the MBE for services to bridge (1975). The Rixi Markus cup (women's individual) was named after her, and she participated in Channel 4's <span class="italic">Master Bridge</span> series (1983). She died on 4 April 1992, two months after Fritzi Gordon, at 42 Nottingham Place, Westminster, from pneumonia, having written her <span class="italic">Guardian</span> columns almost to the end.<br>
