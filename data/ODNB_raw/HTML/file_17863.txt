<span class="headword">Malcolm,  James  Peller</span>  (1767&#150;1815), <span class="occ">antiquary and topographical draughtsman</span>, was born a British subject in August 1767 and baptized at St Peter's Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of the merchant Moses Malcolm (<i>d</i>. 1769) and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Peller (<i>b</i>. 1742). His father, whose parents had moved to America from Scotland, died when he was two years old. His mother was the granddaughter of James Peller, who had accompanied William Penn on his journey from Bristol to the banks of the Delaware, where he built a house and eventually settled in 1689. Despite being a member of the Church of England, Malcolm began his education at the Quaker school in Philadelphia; following the horrors of war his family fled to Potts-town, Pennsylvania, where his education continued &#145;at an enormous expence&#146;  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 85/1, 1815, 467). After the war ended in 1784 he returned to Philadelphia, where, under the guidance of a Mr Bembridge, he began to concentrate on the study of art and taught himself to engrave. His first published plate was the frontispiece for Colonel John Parke's <span class="italic">Lyric Works of Horace</span> (1786), after a sketch by Peter Markoe. Towards the end of 1787 he travelled to England to continue his artistic training at the Royal Academy Schools in London. During his three years there he received encouragement from Benjamin West and Joseph Wright of Derby but, realizing that his interests were in history and landscape images, he turned to etching as a more appropriate medium. His potential was recognized at the end of his time at the Royal Academy Schools, when two of his landscape prints were included in their annual exhibition of 1791. Shortly afterwards he began regular work as an illustrator for the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, for which he etched numerous, mostly topographical, plates between 1792 and 1814. He was also an active contributor to this periodical, writing numerous letters and articles on antiquarian subjects, including a detailed history of Somers Town, the London suburb where he lived throughout his time in England. It was also in the pages of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> that his marriage to &#145;Miss Chrysogon Vaughan, daughter of the Rev. Richard V[aughan] rector of Leominster Co. Hereford&#146; was announced in January 1797  (<span class="italic">GM</span>, 1st ser., 67, 1797, 79&#150;80).<br>
<br>In 1850 the antiquary John Britton recalled Malcolm's passion for antiquarianism, recording how he would religiously spend his days making sketches and notes either at his home or at the reading room of the British Museum  (Britton, 1.112). Although he was not elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries until 27 March 1806, his work from 1797 onwards reflected his enthusiasm for research into English antiquities and topography. Of his eleven illustrated antiquarian publications, the most renowned are <span class="italic">Londinium redivivum</span> (4 vols., 1802&#150;7), <span class="italic">Excursions in Kent</span> (1807), and <span class="italic">Anecdotes of the Manners and Customs of London</span> (3 vols., 1808). In these he compiled an impressive array of unknown parochial and institutional documents and combined these with personal observations and his characteristic and skilful etchings of historical architecture, artefacts, customs, and costume. He also appealed to the more commercial market for antiquarian publications with his series of etchings entitled <span class="italic">Views within Twelve Miles Round London</span> (1800), where the plates were designed to complement the topographical texts of popular authors such as Thomas Pennant and Daniel Lysons.<br>
<br>Malcolm died on 5 April 1815, after a three-year-long debilitating illness which is said to have begun with an abscess on his knee. His inability to work during his final months rendered him totally indigent and at his death his wife and ageing mother were left destitute. As a mark of respect for Malcolm's industry and popularity, following his death his loyal friends set up a public subscription to provide for his mother and widow. This appeal was announced in the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> (May 1815) and was supervised by Malcolm's most regular publishers, Longman &amp; Co., and John Nichols.<br>
