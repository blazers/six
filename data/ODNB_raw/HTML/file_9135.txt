<span class="headword">Fane,  John</span>, seventh earl of Westmorland  (<em>bap. </em>1686, <em>d.</em> 1762), <span class="occ">army officer and politician</span>, was baptized on 24 March 1686 at Mereworth, Kent, the fourth son of Vere Fane, fourth earl of Westmorland (1645&#150;1693), and his wife, Rachel (1653&#150;1711), the daughter and heir of John Bence, an alderman of London. He was educated at Eton College (1698), Lincoln's Inn (1703), and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a fellow commoner in March 1704 and matriculated in the same year. In March 1709 he was appointed captain in Cadogan's regiment of horse (5th dragoon guards), with whom he fought at Malplaquet and subsequent campaigns in Flanders; he left the regiment in 1714. It has been suggested that he was made lieutenant-colonel in 1710, possibly later, but this is not confirmed by army commission registers. In 1715 he succeeded to the colonelcy of the 37th regiment of foot (North Hampshire regiment), who were brought over from Ireland and stationed at Chester during the rising of 1715. Fane was involved in a series of quarrels with local ordnance officials and magistrates over billeting and supplies. His arbitrary action in imprisoning them in Chester Castle provoked George I's displeasure and he was ordered to London and confined to his room on arrest. However, he was allowed to return to the command of his regiment, who remained garrisoned in Chester until early 1717. On 16 August 1716 he married Mary (1700&#150;1778), the only daughter and heir of Lord Henry Cavendish, the second son of the first duke of Devonshire. In December 1717 he transferred to the colonelcy of the 1st troop of Horse Grenadier Guards. As a peacetime officer in Hanoverian England, Fane found his career prospects dependent on his political support for Walpole and the whigs&#151;a role which, as time went by, he was increasingly unable to fulfil.<br>
<br>In 1708 Fane entered the House of Commons, as a whig, for Hythe, but in 1710 he lost his seat on petition. He succeeded his brother Mildmay as knight for the shire of Kent at a by-election upon the latter's death in 1715. The following year he voted against the <span class="roman">Septennial Bill</span>. He withdrew from the election in 1722 but was returned for Buckingham in 1727, when his friend Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham, brought him in at a by-election. When Cobham was dismissed from the army in 1733 for opposing the <span class="roman">Excise Bill</span> (a measure which Fane supported), Fane was granted the colonelcy of the 1st troop of Life Guards&#151;the result of the vacancy created by Lord Pembroke's appointment to Cobham's regiment. In addition, on 4 October 1733 he was created a peer of Ireland, as Baron Catherlough. This marked a high point, for in 1734 he greatly displeased the king and Walpole by supporting a motion to prevent the dismissal of army officers on political grounds (his conscience no doubt pricked by his advance by the misfortune of his friend Cobham). At the general election of that year Walpole prevented his standing for one of the Cinque Ports, previously promised by the duke of Dorset.<br>
<br>Upon his succession to the earldom of Westmorland in 1736 Fane became a tory in the House of Lords. His speaking and voting for an increase in the prince of Wales's allowance resulted in his dismissal from the army in June 1737 without compensation, and he lost the &pound;6500 he paid for the colonelcy in 1717. Now a confirmed enemy of Walpole, Westmorland was reinstated in the army only after Walpole's fall. Having been made brigadier-general in November 1735, in 1742 he was appointed major-general, antedated to 1735, and lieutenant-general, antedated to 1739. However, he was not granted a regiment or compensated for his financial loss, a source of continual resentment towards the Hanoverian regime which led him towards Jacobitism. In 1743 he was privy to the negotiations with France which resulted in the rising of 1745, and he continued to play a leading role within English Jacobite circles during the late 1740s and early 1750s. However, he combined his Jacobitism with service to Frederick, prince of Wales. In 1747 he and his nephew Sir Francis Dashwood [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7179/', "Dashwood, Francis, eleventh Baron Le Despencer")</script>] were Frederick's principal representatives in negotiations to form a broad-based opposition. In September 1750 he met the Young Pretender, Charles Edward, in London. However, by the mid-1750s English Jacobitism had disintegrated and Westmorland was already exclusively following a pro-Hanoverian opposition path. He was one of the peers who volunteered to subsidize Frederick's journal <span class="italic">The Remembrancer</span> after the latter's death in 1751. In 1761 Westmorland attended George III's coronation and was made general of horse.<br>
<br>Before his accession to the earldom in 1736 Westmorland devoted much energy and money to improvements in his seat, Mereworth Castle in Kent. In 1720 he commissioned Colen Campbell (1676&#150;1729), the architectural designer and chief propagandist of the Palladian movement in British architecture, to rebuild the family seat. The resulting building, which was roofed in 1723 with an impressive lead dome and finally completed in 1725, was the closest of the English reproductions of Palladio's Villa Rotunda at Vicenza and, according to Pevsner, remains one of the major achievements of Palladianism in the county. In 1737 Westmorland was made lord lieutenant of Northamptonshire and warden of the east bailliwick of the forest of Rockingham; he became master forester in 1739. In 1754 he was appointed lord high steward and in 1759 chancellor of the University of Oxford, his installation being conducted with unusual magnificence. Westmorland died, childless, from a stroke of the palsy on 26 August 1762 and was buried at Mereworth on 2 September. His widow, Mary, died on 29 July 1778 at Hammersmith.<br>
<br>Westmorland was succeeded as eighth earl by Thomas Fane (<i>b</i>. 8 March 1701), a Bristol merchant, barrister, and MP for Lyme Regis (1753&#150;62), the great-grandson of Sir Francis Fane and great-great-grandson of Francis, first earl of Westmorland. The eighth earl died on 25 November 1771 and was succeeded as ninth earl by his son <a name="cosubject_9135"></a><span class="headword">John Fane</span>  (1728&#150;1774)<span class="occ"></span>, who was born on 5 May 1728 and was educated at Westminster School between 1739 and 1745. In 1762 he became MP for Lyme Regis, and in an undistinguished career always supported the administration. He married first, on 26 March 1758, Augusta (<i>d</i>. 1766), the daughter of Lord Montagu Bertie, and second, on 28 May 1767, Lady Susan (<i>c</i>.1746&#150;1814), the daughter of Cosmo George Gordon, third duke of Gordon. He died on 25 April 1774 and was buried at the family seat at Westbury-on-Trym, Gloucestershire, on 3 May. He was succeeded as tenth earl by his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9136/', "John Fane (1759&#150;1841)")</script>.<br>
