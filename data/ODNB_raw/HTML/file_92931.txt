<span class="headword">Harland,  (Walter) Brian</span>  (1917&#150;2003), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 23 March 1917 at 9 Stepney Road, Scarborough, Yorkshire, the son of Walter Ernest Harland (1880&#150;1947), auctioneer and estate agent, and his wife, Alice Marian, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Whitfield (1883&#150;1954). His early years were spent in and around Scarborough, and he was educated at Bootham School, York. When he was thirteen his discovery of the skeleton of a large crocodile fossilized in the Jurassic rocks of the north Yorkshire coast created national expert interest. In 1935 he went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He graduated with double first-class honours in natural sciences (geology) in 1938, and then started PhD work to investigate the deep structure of eastern England, using explosion seismology. During this period Harland met his future wife, Elisabeth Margaret Ethelwyn Lewis (<i>b</i>. 1919), a fellow student and daughter of Edward Lewis, solicitor, and became a Quaker, starting a lifelong interest in the relationship between religion, philosophy, and science.<br>
<br>When the Second World War broke out, Harland abandoned his PhD study and registered as a conscientious objector. Before this a plan to work in China had been developed through a Quaker contact. In 1942 he was able to travel to Chengdu in China to join the teaching staff at West China University to teach geology. He was joined there eventually by Elisabeth, whom he had married, at the Friends Meeting House, Cardiff, on 3 January 1942. They subsequently had three daughters and one son. Various factors led to the return of the Harland family to Cambridge in 1946, where he had been offered a teaching post in the department of geology. Nevertheless Harland maintained contacts with Chinese geologists for the rest of his life. By coincidence, Joseph Needham, also a member of Caius College, Cambridge, visited the Harlands while working in China during the war. In later years Needham became the leading scholar of the history of Chinese science, and Harland became a founder trustee of the Needham Research Institute in Cambridge.<br>
<br>Harland's teaching in Cambridge was always his first priority, and during his teaching career from 1946 to 1984 he was demonstrator, lecturer, and finally reader in the department of geology (which later became the department of earth sciences), and a fellow of his old college, Gonville and Caius, from 1950 to 1984. He devised and taught many courses at all levels. He was particularly remembered for the delight he showed in the training of students in making observations in the field, and then arguing the meaning of these in the face of all preconceptions. He pioneered the incorporation of fieldwork as a regular part of the Cambridge curriculum, and led some 2000 students, over more than thirty years, on first-year trips to the Isle of Arran. His energy and staying power in the field became legendary, as did the half-mile long crocodiles of students and staff, trailing around the Arran north shore, and living on titbits of information relayed back from Harland.<br>
<br>Immediately on graduation in the summer of 1938 Harland had joined a geographical summer expedition to Spitsbergen. He became fascinated by the geological potential of this high Arctic island group, where the geological story is particularly rich and varied. After his Chinese years, and on his return to Cambridge, he started to develop in Spitsbergen a remarkable programme that eventually resulted in forty-three summer seasons of expeditionary fieldwork, of which he led twenty-nine. More than 300 undergraduates and about thirty graduate collaborators were involved over the years. From this organization he founded the Cambridge Arctic Shelf Programme (CASP) in 1975. This evolved into a scientific research company with charitable status, which by the time of his death employed some twenty-five staff. Harland's determination to make available high-quality information, and the contribution of his own career to this, were admirably represented by his <span class="italic">The Geology of Svalbard</span>, published in 1997 as memoir 17 of the Geological Society of London.<br>
<br>Harland felt great loyalty to his university, department, and college, and shouldered many tasks in their development and administration. For thirty years he edited, with others, the <span class="italic">Geological Magazine</span>, the international journal based in the department. His belief in the importance of collaborating with others to compile research information was another feature of his career. For seven years, from 1963, he was honorary secretary of the Geological Society of London, and led the plans for the society to become a centre for the publication of research information. From 1964 onwards he was the author, principal contributor, and/or managing editor of numerous volumes published by the society, and continued as the driving force behind other collaborative publications, becoming secretary of the International Geological Correlation Programme.<br>
<br>Harland's publications covered many fields of research work. His fascination with geological time and his planning and organization of multi-author, worldwide analyses and reviews of the geological timescale led to his international nickname, Timescale Harland. His research involved independent thinking as well as compilation and collaboration. He had a long-term interest in evidence that the earth has suffered ice ages earlier than the one that is still with us. He led aspects of this research into climate change, initiating the idea that the earth may have been totally covered by ice in an episode some six hundred million years ago&#151;the so-called &#145;Snow-ball Earth&#146;. He also made original contributions to the analysis of movement patterns during mountain-building episodes. These were encapsulated in his invention of the terms &#145;transpression&#146; and &#145;transtension&#146;, which came to be used widely to aid understanding of these patterns. He will probably be remembered most for his determination to use all varied information available to work out the movement patterns that have left their marks in the earth's crust. Typical of this was his considered advocacy of continental drift, long before it was accepted to be a result of what became known as plate tectonics.<br>
<br>Harland retired in 1984, becoming a life fellow of his college, but he remained active, continuing to direct CASP and to publish (including work on scientific philosophy). His last few years were dominated by health problems, which were particularly trying for someone who had led such an active life of arduous field research. He died at his home, 117 Grantchester Meadows, Newnham, Cambridge, on 1 November 2003, of heart failure. He was cremated at Cambridge crematorium on 5 November. He was survived by his wife, Elisabeth, and their four children.<br>
