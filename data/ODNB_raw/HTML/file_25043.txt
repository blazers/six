<span class="headword">Seward <span class="st"> [Seguarde]</span>,  John</span>  (1364/5&#150;1435/6), <span class="occ">schoolmaster, grammarian, and poet</span>, appears to have originated in the north of England and to have been educated there, perhaps at Norham, Northumberland, and Guisborough in the North Riding of Yorkshire, before studying at Oxford University of which he called himself &#145;an unworthy subject&#146;; he also wrote respectfully of John Leland (<i>d</i>. 1428), the leading Oxford schoolmaster of his day. Seward first occurs in 1404 in London as a schoolmaster and described himself as such until his death. His school was in Cornhill and seems to have been a private establishment for teaching Latin grammar, since it was not one of the authorized public schools of the capital. The Tudor bibliographer John Bale says that Seward at one time kept a school in Norwich, but this has not been substantiated and may have arisen because Seward dedicated one of his works to the local bishop, Richard Courtenay. His will, made on 5 June 1435 and proved in the following January, reveals that he had a brother and sister, a wife called Matilda, whose maiden name may have been Broke, and a married daughter, Sybil Scholdyng. The will does not prescribe a place of burial.<br>
<br>Seward had a good knowledge of classical Latin literature. He refers in his writings to Cicero, Horace, Ovid, Seneca, and Virgil, among others, and both echoes their style and alludes to their contents. He was also fond of Boethius. His works, which survive in three manuscripts, fall into two groups. His grammatical writings included a <span class="italic">Compendium super modis significandi</span> on speculative grammar, and five tracts on metre: <span class="italic">Hisagoga metrica</span>, <span class="italic">Mamilla</span>, <span class="italic">Somnium</span>, <span class="italic">Metristencheridion</span>, and <span class="italic">Cathametron</span>, the last of which has been lost. <span class="italic">Somnium</span> (written about 1403) is cast in the form of a dream in which the author meets Lady Philosophy (a Boethian figure) who opens to him the secrets of grammar and metre. He also wrote several poems: <span class="italic">Arpyilogus</span> and <span class="italic">Brachilexis sancte Arpyle</span>, moralizations of the story of the Harpies; <span class="italic">Antelopologia</span>, a description of the properties of the antelope addressed to Prince Henry of Wales, later Henry V, whose badge it was; and <span class="italic">Ludicra</span>, <span class="italic">Invectivae</span>, and epigrams. These last three works are poems, often humorous, exchanged with a group of like-minded men in London and sometimes concerned with discussing metrical topics. The group included William Relyk, master of a private grammar school at the Cardinal's Hat in Lombard Street, and some local clergy. Seward may also have written two epigrams in Oxford, Magdalen College, MS Lat. 15, fol. 128. In 1426 he compiled the cartulary of the guild of St Peter Cornhill. Such dates as occur in his works suggest that they were mostly written between about 1400 and 1420, and the names of people to whom they were addressed imply that Seward had contacts outside London, including John Eyton, canon of Repton, Simon Southerey, prior of St Albans, and William Swan, proctor of the Roman curia. He also dedicated or rededicated works to some important figures: Prince Henry, Edward, duke of York, Bishop Courtenay, Robert Hallum, bishop of Salisbury, Philip Repyndon, bishop of Lincoln, and Paul, bishop of Brindisi. Altogether Seward emerges as a man widely read and connected, but it is not clear whether his works ever gained him patronage, and he seems to have spent and ended his days in modest circumstances.<br>
