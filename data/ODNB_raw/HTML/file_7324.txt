<span class="headword">Dafydd ap Gruffudd</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1283), <span class="occ">prince of Gwynedd</span>, was the third of four sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11696/', "Gruffudd ap Llywelyn (d. 1244)")</script> and his wife, Senana, and grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16874/', "Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (d. 1240)")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Earlycareer"></a>Early career</h2>Dafydd first appears in the historical record on 12 August 1241 when he and his younger brother Rhodri, both still under age, were placed in the custody of Henry III. They were given as sureties for their mother's good faith in an agreement with the king by which she endeavoured to secure the release of her husband from imprisonment by his half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7323/', "Dafydd ap Llywelyn (d. 1246)")</script>. After his elder brothers Owain and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/16875/', "Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (d. 1282)")</script> shared the patrimony of Gwynedd in 1246, and secured the king's endorsement of their position a year later, Dafydd may have associated himself with Llywelyn, whose charter to the priory of Penmon in 1247 he witnessed. The Welsh chronicle <span class="italic">Cronica de Wallia</span> states, however, that he became captain of the household troops (<i>dux familie</i>) in Owain's service, and by 1252 he is found exercising lordship over the commote of Cymydmaen in the cantref of Ll&#375;n. The cantref formed part of Owain's portion of Gwynedd and he may have ceded the commote in response to his younger brother's demands for a share of the patrimony. Dafydd pressed his claims upon the king and in September 1253 Henry took his fealty for whatever portion of Gwynedd he could secure for himself. The two elder brothers were required to provide the portion due to Dafydd &#145;according to the custom of Wales&#146;  (<span class="italic">Close Rolls</span>, 7.419), but, although Owain may have been prepared to accommodate him, Llywelyn was resolutely opposed to any further partition of Gwynedd. The proposals put to the king &#145;concerning Llywelyn's brothers&#146;  (ibid., 10.104) may have urged that Dafydd be given an estate in Perfeddwlad or the Four Cantrefs, the land east of the River Conwy then in the king's possession. Negotiations were of no avail, and in June 1255 Owain and Dafydd brought an army against Llywelyn to resolve the issue by force. They were defeated at Bryn Derwin on the borders of the commotes of Arfon Uwch Gwyrfai and Eifionydd and imprisoned, but whereas Owain was held for twenty-two years Dafydd was released before Llywelyn advanced into Perfeddwlad in November 1256. The lands given him by Llywelyn were mainly located in that area.<br>
<br>Dafydd is found in Llywelyn's service in the next years, participating in a campaign in south-west Wales in 1258 when he is described as &#145;a young man most splendid in arms&#146;  (<span class="italic">Annales Cambriae</span>, 96). In the same year he appears second to Llywelyn in a record of an agreement between the princes of Wales and a group of Scottish magnates, and in 1260 he and Llywelyn put their seals to an agreement for the prolongation of the truce with Henry III. Dafydd may have been formally recognized as second to Llywelyn in the prince's councils. When, in the summer of 1262, Henry III heard a rumour that Llywelyn was dead he was anxious to ensure that Dafydd, who in the king's estimation was no &#145;true heir to Wales&#146;  (<span class="italic">Close Rolls</span>, 12.142&#150;3), should not succeed to the supremacy that Llywelyn had by then established in Wales.<h2>
<a name="RelationswithhisbrotherLlywelynto1278"></a>Relations with his brother Llywelyn to 1278</h2>Henry evidently made an attempt to entice Dafydd from Llywelyn's allegiance shortly before he set out from Chester on his Welsh campaign in 1257, holding forth a prospect that upon the defeat of Llywelyn the king would retain Anglesey and Perfeddwlad and divide the remainder of Gwynedd between Owain and Dafydd. Henry's efforts were of no avail, but the Lord Edward, in the course of his intervention in the march of Wales in April 1263, received Dafydd into his allegiance. Although he was in no position to make his will effective, Edward granted him the cantref of Dyffryn Clwyd and the commote of Ceinmeirch, a provision extended three months later so as to convey the cantrefs of Dyffryn Clwyd and Rhufoniog. The grants were made until such time as Dafydd, by his efforts and Edward's aid, could secure his inheritance in Gwynedd Uwch Conwy, that is in the land west of the Conwy centred on Snowdonia. This was to remain Dafydd's principal ambition throughout his life, and dissatisfaction with the territorial provision made for him by his brother was probably an important reason for his defection. Under the terms of the treaty of Montgomery in September 1267 it was &#145;specially ordained&#146; that he be given the lands which he held before his departure. If Dafydd were not satisfied, further provision should be made by five named members of the prince's council and, if he were still not content, justice would be done to him according to the law and custom of Wales in the presence of two persons who would inform the king of the decision. The matter was required to be resolved by Christmas but agreement is not known to have been reached before 1269, when a compact was made that gave Dafydd no more than he possessed upon his secession to the king. Dafydd was married, after 1265, to Elizabeth, sister of Robert Ferrers, earl of Derby (<i>d</i>. 1279), and widow of William Marshal (<i>d</i>. 1265). Through his wife he held the manor of Folesham, Norfolk, then exchanged with John Marshal for the manor of Norton, Northamptonshire.<br>
<br>Although Dafydd served in Llywelyn's forces in Glamorgan in 1271 and is mentioned as one of his councillors two years later, relations between the brothers remained difficult. The surviving evidence indicates that in 1274 Dafydd ap Gruffudd and Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn (<i>d</i>. 1286) conspired to kill Llywelyn. At a session of the prince's council in April 1274 Gruffudd and his son Owain were convicted of infidelity, but action against Dafydd was taken only later in the year following a confession by Owain ap Gruffudd, who was held in custody as a surety for his father's good faith. Dafydd was summoned to appear before the prince's council at Rhuddlan to answer charges against him. Told to appear again at Llanfor in Penllyn, Dafydd fled to England with an armed following. Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn did likewise and Edward I received them into his realm. Dafydd asked for Edward's guidance as to how he could do most to damage Llywelyn, and sought the king's aid in doing so. Refusing to do homage to Edward at Chester in August 1275, Llywelyn gave as his main reason the king's decision to receive the two vassals who had conspired to kill him.<br>
<br>In the war of 1277 Dafydd served alongside William Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, in a force based at Chester which advanced into Powys Fadog. Reporting during April that Dafydd was making demands concerning the payment of his men and insisting that he retain booty taken by them, Warwick feared that he might withdraw from the king's service. Dafydd was also said to be angry that certain men, probably magnates engaged in the campaign, were asking the king for land in Wales. Dafydd's continued concern for his interests, and perhaps anxiety over his continued fidelity, may have prompted Edward's charter of 23 August, which indicated that, upon securing Gwynedd Uwch Conwy, he would divide the land between Dafydd ap Gruffudd, Owain ap Gruffudd, and himself. The two Welsh lords would be summoned to the king's parliaments in England like the other earls and barons of the realm. Dafydd was also granted the lordship of Hope, where, with Edward's help, he began to build the castle of Caergwrle. By the autumn Edward had other intentions. On 10 October he issued a charter granting Dafydd the two cantrefs of Dyffryn Clwyd and Rhufoniog in Perfeddwlad, thereby affirming the grant which he had made upon Dafydd's defection in 1263. Once more the grant was made so as to provide for Dafydd until he could secure his share of the patrimony in Gwynedd Uwch Conwy, but on this occasion Edward was able to put his will into effect immediately. Edward may have been reluctant to see Dafydd established in Snowdonia, and a negotiated settlement with Llywelyn was secured by the treaty of Aberconwy on 9 November. A week earlier, in a document which points to a key issue in the negotiations, Edward granted Llywelyn a life-interest in Gwynedd Uwch Conwy in return for his acknowledgement of Dafydd's hereditary right there. The substance of this agreement was then embodied in a treaty which, creating only a life-interest for Dafydd in Dyffryn Clwyd and Rhufoniog, and leaving his aspiration for a share of Snowdonia still unrequited, provided no permanent solution to the problems that Dafydd had posed.<h2>
<a name="Thewarof12821283"></a>The war of 1282&#150;1283</h2>Dafydd was at Rhuddlan in September 1278 when, in Edward's presence, Llywelyn agreed to fulfil the terms of an earlier financial settlement with Rhodri ap Gruffudd. Dafydd gave a security that the money pledged by Llywelyn to Rhodri could be raised on his English estates. At the same time the king issued to Dafydd a grant for life of the manor of Frodsham, Cheshire, previously held at will. There is no certain evidence of discord between Dafydd and the crown until late 1281. He had previously been summoned to the county court of Chester to answer a claim by William de Venables to lands in Hope and, according to Dafydd's account, an inquisition had shown that the lands in question were in Wales and were subject to Welsh, not English, law. The decision appears to have been reversed following Reynold de Grey's appointment as justice of Chester in November 1281. Dafydd went to court and, in a loud voice, declared that the land was in Wales and that he had no need to answer in the county court. He pleaded that the laws of Wales be respected like the laws of other nations. He subsequently complained of interference by royal officers in his lordships of Dyffryn Clwyd and Rhufoniog, and he was particularly aggrieved at the actions of Reynold de Grey. He shared his aversion to Grey with the communities under the justice's authority in Rhos and Tegeingl and this common experience was a major cause of renewed conflict in 1282 when Dafydd played the main initiating role. On Palm Sunday (22 March) 1282 Dafydd launched an attack on the castle of Hawarden, capturing its custodian, Roger Clifford (<i>d</i>. 1285), and Rhuddlan was put under siege. Dafydd was probably the inspiration behind the almost simultaneous rising on the part of several of the princes of south-west Wales. Llywelyn may have tarried before committing himself to war, and Dafydd was certainly the main object of Edward's anger during the conflict.<br>
<br>Dafydd's castle of Caergwrle fell to forces advancing from Chester on 16 June, three months after hostilities began. The main royal advance began in early August and Grey was able to reach Ruthin, the centre of Dafydd's lordship of Dyffryn Clwyd, by the third week of the month. There is, however, no indication that the king's army reached the vicinity of Denbigh until mid-October, and this suggests that strong resistance was encountered in Dafydd's lordship of Rhufoniog. Along with Rhos, Rhufoniog was granted to Henry de Lacy, earl of Lincoln, on 16 October, and Dyffryn Clwyd was conveyed to Grey on 23 October.<br>
<br>Conflict was stayed upon intervention by John Pecham (<i>d</i>. 1292), archbishop of Canterbury. Dafydd's grievances were included among the materials sent to Pecham before he entered Snowdonia for discussions with Llywelyn and probably with Dafydd. Upon his return to Rhuddlan, finding the king still bent upon the princes' unconditional surrender, Pecham secured the magnates' consent to proposals that they would be prepared to recommend to the king if Llywelyn and Dafydd were to submit. Llywelyn was offered sanctuary in England, Dafydd was given only an opportunity to leave for the Holy Land, never to return unless recalled by the king. In a trenchant reply Dafydd said that, when he went to the Holy Land, he would do so of his free will, for God and not for man. He, and others with him, had gone to war to defend their patrimony and their liberties. He insisted that he was fighting a just war, and that he was prepared to answer before God for what he had done in the name of justice.<br>
<br>When Llywelyn subsequently departed for the march Dafydd was left to defend Gwynedd Uwch Conwy and, after his brother's death on 11 December 1282, assuming the style &#145;prince of Wales and lord of Snowdon&#146;, he maintained resistance for several months. However, the English assault forced Dafydd's withdrawal to his innermost fastnesses. Castell y Bere fell on 25 April and thereafter Dafydd was a fugitive, searches being made for him by contingents of soldiers far and wide in Snowdonia and further afield. The Hagnaby chronicle states that he sent his wife and Roger Clifford to the king to plead for mercy but to no avail. Dafydd was captured on 22 June 1283 and six days later Edward announced that he had been taken by men of his own nation. He was imprisoned at Rhuddlan. The magnates of the realm and representatives of the shires were summoned to Shrewsbury by the morrow of Michaelmas for the trial of &#145;the last survivor of a family of traitors&#146;  (<span class="italic">Calendar of Various Chancery Rolls</span>, <i>1277&#150;1326</i>, 281). Edward expressed his anger at the perfidy of one whom the king had received as an exile, nourished as an orphan, and endowed with lands and placed among the great ones at court. Dafydd was tried and sentenced to death for treason. He was dragged to the scaffold as a traitor, he was hanged for homicide and, because he had committed the murders during the Lord's passion, he was disembowelled and his entrails burnt. For plotting the king's death his body was quartered and sent to four English cities. Geoffrey of Shrewsbury was paid 20<i>s</i>. for executing the judgment on Saturday 2 October. Dafydd's head was placed beside that of his brother at the Tower of London.<br>
<br>Dafydd had two sons, Llywelyn and Owain, who, after their capture, were taken under escort through Acton Burnell to Bristol Castle. Llywelyn died there in 1287 and was buried in the Dominican church; Owain was still at Bristol in 1325. Dafydd was said to have had seven daughters, one of whom was named Gwladus (<i>d</i>. 1328); they were sent to the Gilbertine house of Sixle, Lincolnshire, and other nunneries. The poet Bleddyn Fardd composed Dafydd's elegy and another poem to commemorate Owain, Llywelyn, and Dafydd together.<br>
