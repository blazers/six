<span class="headword">Watson,  John</span>  (<em>c.</em>1520&#150;1584), <span class="occ">bishop of Winchester</span>, was born in Evesham, Worcestershire, son of Thomas Watson and his wife, Agnes, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Weekes. He had three surviving brothers, William, Thomas, and Robert, and six sisters. The family was of some means as he bequeathed silver plate left to him by his father and a house in Bengeworth, near Evesham. Watson was educated at Oxford, graduating BA in June 1539. Admitted a fellow of All Souls in 1540 he incepted MA in February 1545. On 9 December 1551 he received letters patent for the eleventh prebend in Winchester Cathedral. In April 1554 he was admitted to the rectories of Kelsall, Hertfordshire, and Winchfield, Hampshire, and may have been the man who matriculated at the University of Louvain in June that year. He did not take orders until 1557. On 12 June that year he was ordained to minor orders and as subdeacon, as of Worcester diocese, by Thomas Chetham, bishop of Sidon, suffragan of London, using his parish of Winchfield as his title. Following letters dimissory to take higher orders, issued on 28 August 1557 by Bishop Richard Pates of Worcester, he was ordained deacon in London on 24 September 1558 as of All Souls, although now stated to be of Gloucester diocese. Meanwhile, on 7 February 1558, he had been collated by Edmund Bonner, bishop of London, to the chancellorship of St Paul's, a post he retained until his consecration. Later that year he vacated his Winchester prebend.<br>
<br>Watson accommodated himself to the Elizabethan settlement and was granted letters patent for the hospital of St Cross, near Winchester, on 17 August 1559, and for the first prebend at Winchester at about the same time. That same month he was one of the few members of the St Paul's chapter to accept the oath of supremacy. Thereafter his rise was surprisingly rapid for one whose career had been actively promoted by Bonner. Becoming archdeacon of Surrey, also by letters patent, on 7 November 1559 he was, perhaps predictably, found on the conservative wing in the convocation of 1562&#150;3. In 1568 he was admitted to the rectory of South Warnborough, Hampshire, and in February 1573 received letters patent for the deanery of Winchester, resigning his archdeaconry and his prebend. On 27 July 1575 he proceeded doctor of medicine at Oxford.<br>
<br>Watson was evidently on good terms with his bishop, Robert Horne, being named one of the four executors of Horne's will in June 1579. He was elected Horne's successor on 29 June 1580 and consecrated on 18 September, having discovered in the interim that he was expected to pay a substantially higher figure for his first fruits than Horne had negotiated in 1561. Perhaps as a form of compensation he was on 2 December 1580 granted the right to hold the hospital of St Cross for a further three years.<br>
<br>In November 1580 he began his primary visitation of the diocese but was interrupted by the parliamentary session that ended in March 1581. During this parliament and convocation Watson, along with bishops John Aylmer of London, John Whitgift of Worcester, John Piers of Salisbury, and Thomas Cooper of Lincoln, was ordered by the privy council to investigate the religious sect known as the Family of Love. The government was also much concerned to clamp down on recusancy at this time. In October 1580 Watson had been directed to hold the husbands of women recusants responsible for their wives' conformity, through fines if necessary. On 22 November he responded that it was surely unreasonable to punish men &#145;for their wives' faults&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 12/144/36).<br>
<br>It was perhaps for that reason, and because of his own Marian past, that he was suspected of leniency towards recusants. The charge would appear to be unjust since the evidence of his brief tenure of Winchester is largely concerned with the suppression of Catholicism. In 1580 he interrogated Elizabeth Sander, sister of Dr Nicholas Sander, and in August 1582 the seminary priest John Chapman. In 1583 two local schoolmasters, John Slade and John Body, were condemned at Winchester assizes and executed on 30 October and 2 November 1583 respectively. During the following month Watson and the mayor conducted a house-to-house search, which resulted in the discovery in Lady West's house of a trunk containing all the items necessary for conducting mass. Nothing else is known of his brief episcopate beyond the fact that he seems to have granted a lavish number of episcopal leases and, according to his successor, Thomas Cooper, left the episcopal manors poorly stocked and in a state of decay.<br>
<br>The unmarried incumbent of a still rich see, Watson was in a position to prove a generous benefactor. In 1582 he contributed &pound;60, his dean and chapter adding &pound;40, to endow the city of Winchester with a fund that would provide interest-free loans to needy freemen. His will, drawn up on 23 October 1583, contained a stream of impressive bequests. He left &pound;40 to All Souls, &pound;20 to Oxford University, 100 marks to the use of the university's poor scholars, and &#145;exhibitions&#146; of &pound;4 per annum payable over five years to five poor scholars appointed at the discretion of his executors. The poor of Winchester received &pound;20; those of Evesham &pound;10; and those of Bengeworth &pound;5. A stock of &pound;40 was to be set up for the poor of Evesham and of &pound;10 for those of Bengeworth. He also remembered the thirteen poor brothers of St Cross, left &pound;40 for the purchase of books to Winchester Cathedral Library, and bequeathed a horse to his principal overseer, Sir Francis Walsingham. Altogether his monetary legacies to his siblings and their numerous offspring, to prot&eacute;g&eacute;s and to good causes amounted to about &pound;1000. He left his medical books to a cousin, Simon Tripp.<br>
<br>Codicils to the will are dated 22 and 23 January 1584 and Watson died at Winchester on the latter day. On 17 February he was buried in his cathedral, as directed in his will, which was proved on 22 June 1584. Thereafter Bishop Cooper managed to extract &pound;530 from his executors towards the repair of the episcopal manors.<br>
