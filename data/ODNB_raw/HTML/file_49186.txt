<span class="headword">Johnston,  Lawrence Waterbury</span>  (1871&#150;1958), <span class="occ">garden designer and plantsman</span>, was born in Paris on 17 October 1871, the elder son of Elliott Johnston (1826&#150;1901), a member of a well-connected banking family from Baltimore, Maryland, and his wife, Gertrude Cleveland Waterbury (1845&#150;1926), an equally well-connected heiress from New York city. He was brought up mainly in France, where his mother preferred to live; after her divorce from his father his mother married, in London in 1887, a New York banker, Charles Francis Winthrop (1827&#150;1898). Gertrude Winthrop, a New York socialite, dominated her son's life. In 1893 Johnston came to England to Little Shelford, near Cambridge, where he became a pupil of a Mr J. Dunn and prepared to enter the university. In June 1894 he entered Trinity College as a pensioner; he matriculated at Michaelmas of that year and graduated BA in 1897. He had enjoyed the friendships that Cambridge afforded, and one of his friends encouraged him to study farming at New Etal, Northumberland. In 1900 he became a British citizen in order to serve as a private in the South African War, and later received a commission in the Northumberland Hussars.<br>
<br>By 1904, when he was elected a fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society, Lawrence Johnston was again living at Little Shelford. In 1907 Mrs Winthrop bought the small estate of Hidcote Bartrim, near Broadway in the Cotswolds. It was Johnston's nature to study thoroughly and master his interests, and he turned first to architecture in order to restore the Hidcote Manor house and buildings, and then to garden design for the enlargement of the garden. In appearance he was small and militarily smart, combining a shy and reserved manner with birdlike energy; he loved to paint and play tennis and was welcomed into Broadway society by the artist Alfred Parsons and the American actress Mary Anderson de Navarro; he also formed links with many of the distinguished local gardening fraternity. From 1907 to 1914 Johnston set about the restoration of the old garden at Hidcote, enclosing adjoining fields to create wide vistas to the west and south and planting hedges of every variety to form small sheltered &#145;rooms&#146;. Although he was nearly forty-three when the war started in 1914 he went to the western front as a major in the hussars: he later told his friend Alvilde Lees-Milne how he was wounded and left for dead until the officer of the burial party recognized him and saw him move. He was invalided home in October 1914 but returned to France in 1916 and continued to serve as an officer with the Northumberland regiment until he retired in November 1922 on reaching the age limit.<br>
<br>While continuing to develop his garden at Hidcote Manor (with his head gardener, Frank H. Adams, from 1922 until 1939) Johnston also acquired a French property in a valley near Menton, La Serre de la Madone, where the winters were spent for the sake of Mrs Winthrop's health. She died in 1926, releasing Johnston to pursue his plant hunting in South America, South Africa, and the Far East. In 1930 Hidcote Manor garden was featured in two articles in <span class="italic">Country Life</span>, which showed the well-grown structure of hedges and avenues of beech, holly, hornbeam, and yew and exhibited Johnston's wisdom in planning and planting them all so carefully. During the 1930s he concentrated upon filling the garden rooms with a lavish collection of rare and beautiful flowers and shrubs, his tastes and enthusiasms being shared with his closest gardening friend of those years, Norah Lindsay. Having escaped from Menton in 1940 just before Italian forces entered the town, Johnston returned to Hidcote. He maintained the garden throughout the Second World War, but it was still known to only a comparative few outside the horticultural world. However, it attracted much attention when Johnston announced that he wished to retire to his French home for the sake of his health, leaving Hidcote Manor to Mrs Lindsay. She died suddenly in 1948, and it was largely because of support by Vita Sackville-West that the National Trust acquired Hidcote Manor on behalf of the nation, entirely on the merit of the garden. This followed a public appeal for funds to preserve some of Britain's finest gardens, launched by the National Trust and the Royal Horticultural Society in June 1948. Hidcote was the first garden to be saved under this scheme and Johnston signed the deed in August 1948.<br>
<br>Johnston never married, and remained a devout Roman Catholic throughout his life. After leaving Hidcote, he moved to La Serre de la Madone, where he died on 27 April 1958. He was buried in Mickleton churchyard, near Hidcote Manor, alongside his mother. His garden in Hidcote, maintained to his design and with many of his favourite planting schemes, is now regarded as one of the most influential of twentieth-century gardens, of enduring appeal and inspiration as a network of small private garden rooms. It became one of the most visited of British gardens.<br>
