<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Thomas,  (Lewis John) Wynford  Vaughan-</span>  (1908&#150;1987), <span class="occ">author and broadcaster</span>, was born on 15 August 1908 at 9 Calvert Terrace, Swansea, the second of three sons (there were no daughters) of Dr David Vaughan Thomas, professor of music, and his wife, Morfydd Lewis. He attended Swansea grammar school, where he just overlapped with Dylan Thomas, the poet, of whom he became a close friend. He won a history exhibition to Exeter College, Oxford, and obtained a second class in modern history in 1930.<br>
<br>Having graduated at the depth of the depression Vaughan-Thomas (he had added Vaughan to his name) made a precarious living by lecturing. In 1933 he became keeper of manuscripts and records at the National Library of Wales and in 1934 area officer of the South Wales Council of Social Service. In 1937 he joined the outside broadcasts department of the BBC's office at Cardiff, in order to be close to the girl he was to marry ten years later. Outside broadcasts were then the only BBC programmes where words spoken were not read from a script. The challenging task of an outside broadcast commentator was to convert an event, as it unfolded, into vivid words and structured sentences which immediately conveyed the scene visually to audiences who could only use their ears.<br>
<br>Vaughan-Thomas was a dark-haired, somewhat chubby man of great vitality. His natural effervescence, his Celtic eloquence, his humour, and his well-stocked mind soon brought him to the fore as a commentator on major occasions in both English and Welsh. He gave the Welsh commentary on the coronation of King George VI. On the outbreak of the Second World War he transferred to the London outside broadcasts department as a home front reporter and in 1942, after covering the blitz, he became a war correspondent. He was the first BBC reporter to fly in a Lancaster bomber on a night raid on Berlin (1943). The bomb run which he brilliantly described, as the aircraft was caught by the German searchlights and dodged the flak, gave listeners a vivid picture of the gruelling perils the RAF crews endured.<br>
<br>Later Vaughan-Thomas recorded memorable dispatches on the Anzio beachhead and covered the liberation of Rome. He also &#145;liberated&#146; the vineyards of Burgundy, remarking typically, &#145;We had three marvellous days in a cellar and I emerged with the Croix de Guerre&#146; (1945). The closing stages of the war found him in Hamburg, broadcasting from the studio which William Joyce, Lord Haw-Haw, had been using only days before. He visited the Belsen concentration camp shortly after it was opened and was outraged by the assault on human dignity that he found there. In 1946 he married Charlotte, daughter of John Rowlands, a civil servant. There was one son of the marriage, who became a film director.<br>
<br>For the next three decades Vaughan-Thomas was a leading commentator on state occasions, most notably the wedding of Princess Elizabeth to the duke of Edinburgh. He covered the granting of independence to India and many similar celebrations as former colonial territories hauled down the union flag. He went on overseas tours with the royal family. He took the popularity of his broadcasts in his stride. In his television commentary at the memorial service in Westminster Abbey for Richard Dimbleby he said: &#145;Ours is a transient art, our words and pictures make a powerful immediate impact, and then fade as if they never had been&#146;.<br>
<br>Vaughan-Thomas was happier as a performer on radio than on television, but in 1967 he became a leading member of the group headed by the fifth Baron Harlech, which was unexpectedly awarded the franchise for the commercial television channel serving Wales and the west of England. Vaughan-Thomas became the first director of programmes for Harlech Television (HTV) in Cardiff and three years later was promoted to be executive director of HTV. His return to Wales brought him into active participation in the affairs of the principality. He was a director of the Welsh National Opera, chairman of the Council for the Preservation of Rural Wales, and an honorary druid (1974). He was also a governor of the British Film Institute (1977&#150;80).<br>
<br>Vaughan-Thomas wrote a number of books, especially about the countryside. He continued to broadcast radio talks about the changing seasons and made regular forays to London where he would regale his friends with scatological limericks involving complicated Welsh place names, composed by himself. He had an infectious good humour. He was made OBE in 1974, CBE in 1986, and an honorary MA of the Open University in 1982. Vaughan-Thomas died on 4 February 1987 in Fishguard, where his home was Pentower, Tower Mill. He was survived by his wife.<br>
