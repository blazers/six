<span class="headword">Dowling, Sir  James</span>  (1787&#150;1844), <span class="occ">judge in Australia</span>, was born in London on 25 November 1787, the second son of Vincent Dowling (1756&#150;1825), at various times a journalist, bookseller, and vendor of patent medicines, of Queen's county, Ireland, and London. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7965/', "Alfred Septimus Dowling")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7970/', "Vincent George Dowling")</script> were his brothers.<br>
<br>Dowling was educated at St Paul's School, London, before becoming a parliamentary and general reporter. In 1815 he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple through the system, as his son described it, of being able to &#145;deposit what is known as &#147;caution money&#148; with the Society &hellip; to pay his &#147;call dues&#148;&#146;  (Dowling, 43). He produced, with Archer Ryland QC, the king's bench reports from 1822 to 1831, as well as other well-received legal works. On 3 September 1814 he married Maria (<i>d</i>. 1834), the daughter of J. L. Sheen of Kentish Town, London; they had ten children, four of whom died in infancy. Following her death, on 1 September 1835 he married Harriott Mary Ritchie (<i>d</i>. 1881), the widowed daughter of the Hon. John Blaxland of Newington, New South Wales.<br>
<br>Dowling had become a &#145;prot&eacute;g&eacute;&#146;  (Ward, 85) of Lord Brougham and other influential individuals, and in 1827 he obtained the position of a judge on the supreme court in New South Wales. He arrived in the colony in February the following year. When Chief Justice Forbes retired in 1837, Dowling's claim to succeed to the post, as senior puisine judge, created controversy. He had previously offended, during a case, the influential local politician James Macarthur, who offered the opinion that Dowling's appointment to the position would be &#145;a public calamity &hellip; a man of no ideas&#146;  (ibid., 84&#150;5). The retiring chief justice, however, came to the point in his recommendation that &#145;Dowling's is the stronger claim and &hellip; is &hellip; backed by Lord Brougham&#146;  (ibid., 85). Dowling became chief justice, and was knighted the following year.<br>
<br>Despite the controversy, in his new position Dowling gained the respect of his colleagues, as they later said of him, for his &#145;indefatigable industry&#146; in applying himself to his duties, as well as his good humour and &#145;kindly nature&#146;  (Dowling, 49&#150;50). However, as Sir Alfred Stephen expressed it, Dowling's &#145;painstaking and anxious&#146; approach to his job  (Currey, 320) led him to illness through overwork. In May 1841 he applied for extended leave to recover his strength, but this was delayed. In June 1844 he collapsed while sitting on the bench; he was preparing to return to England when he died at his home, Brougham Lodge (named after his benefactor), in Darlinghurst, Sydney, on 27 September 1844. He was buried in the Devonshire Street cemetery, Sydney.<br>
