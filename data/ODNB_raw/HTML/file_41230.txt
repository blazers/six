<span class="headword">Cust, Sir  Herbert Edward  Purey-</span>  (1857&#150;1938), <span class="occ">naval officer and hydrographer</span>, was born on 26 February 1857, the second son of Arthur Perceval Purey-Cust (1828&#150;1916), dean of York (1880&#150;1916), and his wife, Lady Emma Bligh, younger daughter of the fifth earl of Darnley. He entered the Royal Navy in 1870, was promoted to midshipman in 1872, and to sub-lieutenant in 1876. He served in the steam frigate <i>Newcastle</i> in China, and then in the sloop <i>Squirrel</i> at Devonport, where he was promoted to lieutenant. After a time in HMS <i>Valiant</i> in the channel squadron, he specialized in hydrographic surveying from 1881. He was appointed to HMS <i>Fawn</i> and worked for two years in the Red Sea and on the east coast of Africa. After taking a course in 1884 at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, where he gained the first prize for general proficiency, he joined the surveying sloop <i>Rambler</i>. On passage out to China she was involved in military operations in the Sudan, based on Suakin, for which Purey-Cust was awarded the Egyptian medal and the khedive's bronze star. In China Purey-Cust surveyed the south channel of the Yangtze (Yangzi) River from the imperial Chinese customs cruiser <i>Kua-Hsing</i>. His four years in the <i>Rambler</i> were followed by three in HMS <i>Egeria</i> in the Pacific and the eastern archipelago.<br>
<br>Purey-Cust obtained his first command, the converted yacht <i>Dart</i>, in 1892, and spent three and a half years surveying on the east coast of Australia, in Tasmania, and in the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu). Working off the island of Ambrym, <i>Dart</i>'s surveys were interrupted by a volcanic eruption, which threw molten lava into the sea near the ship. Steam and dust clouds put a stop to surveying, and the ship's company gave help to the inhabitants of the island before resuming work. Purey-Cust was promoted to commander in 1894, and before leaving Australia in 1895 married Alice Ella (<i>d</i>. 1945), daughter of George Stuart Hepburn of Smeaton. In England Purey-Cust joined the hydrographic department as a naval assistant until, in November 1897, he was sent back to the <i>Rambler</i> in command. In three years in this ship he ranged widely, from the Strait of Belle &Icirc;le and the West Indies to east and west Africa and the Red Sea. His work included surveys of the South African coast in 1900, for which he successfully applied for the South African medal for himself and his ship's company. He was promoted to captain in 1900, and left the <i>Rambler</i> in Malta in 1901. His final sea command was the paddle surveying vessel <i>Triton</i> from 1902 to 1905, working in home waters. He was commended by the hydrographer for his ingenuity in devising a transparent plastic protractor, which remained in use until automatic plotting devices were introduced in the 1970s.<br>
<br>In April 1907 Purey-Cust was appointed assistant hydrographer, and two years later became hydrographer of the navy. As the storm clouds gathered over Europe he was much concerned with preparing the hydrographic service for war. He ordered new surveys of the southern North Sea. He also prepared the systems required for promulgating navigational information to warships and friendly merchant vessels under the constraints of wartime secrecy. He relinquished office on 31 August 1914, shortly after war broke out. He had been promoted to rear-admiral in 1910, and made CB in 1911. Not content to idle in retirement, during the war Purey-Cust was commissioned as a captain RNR in November 1914, and appointed in command of the fleet auxiliary <i>Zaria</i>; initially employed as a store ship, from 1915 <i>Zaria</i> was a depot ship for auxiliary patrol craft, with Purey-Cust holding an appointment as commodore RNR. <i>Zaria</i> was paid off early in 1919, when Purey-Cust reverted to the retired list. He had been promoted to vice-admiral on the retired list in 1915, and to admiral in 1919, in which year he was made KBE.<br>
<br>Herbert and Alice Purey-Cust had two children, a son, Arthur John, born in 1897, who followed his father into the Royal Navy and was killed in action in HMS <i>Strongbow</i> in October 1917, and a daughter, Marjorie, born in 1905, who survived them both. Sir Herbert died in Highgate on 11 November 1938; he was buried in Highgate cemetery on the 15th.<br>
