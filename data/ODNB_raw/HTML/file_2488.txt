<span class="headword">Blaauw,  William Henry</span>  (1793&#150;1870), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was born on 25 May 1793 in Queen Anne Street, Marylebone, Middlesex, the only son of William Blaauw (1748&#150;1808), an immigrant from Amsterdam, and his second wife, Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1812), daughter of Christopher Puller of Woodford, Essex. He was educated at school in Sunbury and then at Eton College and privately before going to Christ Church, Oxford, where he gained a first-class BA in classics in 1815 and proceeded MA in 1818. On 24 June 1825 he married Harriet, daughter of John King MP and under-secretary of state, but she died in 1828; both daughters of the marriage died young. His second wife, whom he married at St Marylebone on 16 June 1832, was Margaret Emily (1798/9&#150;1881), daughter of Sir John St Leger Gillman, bt, of Curraheen, co. Cork; their elder son died young, and a son and a daughter survived him. His first wife's marriage settlement gave Blaauw an annual income of &pound;1000 for life.<br>
<br>Between 1827 and 1837 Blaauw lived at 24 Lower Brook Street, St George's Hanover Square, London. In 1834 he purchased a 39 acre estate in Newick, Sussex, and after greatly enlarging the farmhouse on the estate, Beechland, he took up residence there in 1837. As a country gentleman, Blaauw extended his estate by judicious purchases, sat on the bench, and served in the lieutenancy. The distant view of the battlefield of Lewes inspired him to study the upheavals of Henry III's reign and in 1844 to publish <span class="italic">The Barons' War</span>, which drew extensively on chronicles then only in manuscript. As many as 120 years later R. F. Treharne considered that it &#145;is still the only account of the baronial reform movement as such, and remains a work of great perception and value today&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Battle of Lewes, 1264</span>, 1964, 121).<br>
<br>
<span class="italic">The Barons' War</span> brought Blaauw to the attention of those active in organized historical scholarship. He was known as a very valuable supporter of the Archaeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland from its first congress (1845). He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1850 and also of the Royal Geographical Society, and he served as a council member of the Camden Society from 1848 and as the society's treasurer from 1862. Nearer home, he was a founder of the Sussex Archaeological Society in 1846, its first secretary until 1859, and the first editor of <span class="italic">Sussex Archaeological Collections</span> (1847&#150;58). As a gentleman and scholar of independent means, he made the society possible by providing the bridge both to the national societies, and between the Sussex gentry and nobility and the lesser professional men of Lewes, such as Mark Antony Lower, who were the other prime movers.<br>
<br>Blaauw did not again produce sustained research to match <span class="italic">The Barons' War</span>, although he was preparing a revision at the time of his death (edited by C. H. Pearson, 1871). All his contributions to <span class="italic">Sussex Archaeological Collections</span> (as also to the <span class="italic">Archaeological Journal</span>) were based on a single or a few documents, or described one antiquity, and they ended in 1861. His public service culminated in the office of high sheriff in 1859. A portrait in middle age suggests a man of medium height and build, clean shaven and balding. An obituary referred to a melancholy illness which had long precluded any exertion. Blaauw died on 26 April 1870 at Beechland and was buried on 3 May in the churchyard at Newick.<br>
