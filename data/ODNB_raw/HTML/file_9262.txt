<span class="headword">Fell,  Thomas</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1599, <em>d.</em> 1658), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was baptized in Ulverston, Lancashire, on 13 March 1599, the son of George Fell of Hawkeswell (<i>fl</i>. 1596&#150;1614), a gentleman of an ancient Lancashire family. He entered Gray's Inn in 1623 and was called to the bar in 1631. In 1651 he was chosen a bencher of that society. By then he had established himself as a prominent lawyer and a leading judicial figure within the parliamentarian and republican establishments.<br>
<br>Having served as a parliamentarian sequestrator in Lancashire during the civil war, Fell was recruited to one of the vacant Lancaster seats at Westminster in January 1646. A year later he was acting in conjunction with the leading parliamentarian counsel John Bradshaw in both the duchy court at Westminster and the vice-chancellor's court at Lancaster. In 1648 he became attorney-general in north Wales. Having withdrawn from the Commons at the purge in December 1648 he was nevertheless appointed on 20 July 1649 as deputy to the chief justice of Chester (where once he had served as counsel to the corporation), and his formal readmission to the House of Commons followed three days later.<br>
<br>Bradshaw was appointed chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster on 28 July 1649, and Fell was made a serjeant-at-law in the duchy court within days. He was vice-chancellor of the duchy by 11 September. A little over four years later the chancellorship was put in commission and the palatinate seal was held exclusively by Fell for a few months from 28 February 1654 (the express wish of the lord protector himself), then from 9 June shared once more with Bradshaw. Although two years passed before Fell took up his duties in the duchy court at Westminster he was in harness from February 1656. Apparently it was generally Fell, with his assistants, Baron Parker and Sergeant Cooke, who presided over Lancaster affairs at his time, while Bradshaw withdrew entirely. Hence the claim made in the parish register at Ulverston that, at his burial there on 10 October 1658, Fell was &#145;Chancellor of the Dutchy &amp; commissioner of the Seals of the County palatine of Lancr&#146;.<br>
<br>In 1632 Fell had married Margaret Askew (1614&#150;1702) of nearby Marshgrange, who was descended from a Lincolnshire dynasty once prominent at the early Tudor court. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9260/', "Margaret Fell")</script> was an early convert to the doctrines of George Fox and asked her husband to arrange, if he could, the publication of some of her mentor's spiritual meditations in 1653, along with those of other early Quakers including James Nayler and Gervase Benson. Fell had certainly used his local judicial position to protect Fox from his persecutors in Lancashire. He even made available his home, Swarthmoor Hall, for the first Friends' meetings in that area.<br>
<br>There were limits to Fell's tolerance of the kind of revolutionary anti-formalism which appears to have weakened somewhat any pretence at a conventional patriarchal order in his own household. In 1657 his wife had to advise Gerrard Roberts to make sure a certain book that she wished published should &#145;Com forth Speedely and Bee Sent Abrode, before my Husband Com up to London, lest hee have sight of it and prevent the Sarvice of it&#146;  (RS Friends, Lond., Spence MS 3, 49). Quaker correspondence of the time frequently refers to the judge's resistance to truth. There is no doubting his godly credentials, however. In 1646 he had been appointed leading layman in the ninth classis of the Lancashire presbytery.<br>
<br>Fell died on 8 October 1658 leaving his widow, one son, and seven daughters, including the Quaker preacher, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69145/', "Isabel Yeamans")</script>; he was buried at Ulverston parish church two days later. His father being described posthumously at the Restoration as a &#145;grand malignant&#146;, Fell's son, George, had to sue for pardon  (<span class="italic">CSP dom.</span>, <i>1660&#150;61</i>, 50). In his will, dated 23 September and proved on 4 December 1658, Fell endowed the grammar school at Ulverston towards the maintenance of a schoolmaster. His extensive patrimony became the object of an apparently acrimonious dispute between his widow, Margaret, and his heir, George Fell, George's wife, Hannah (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Cooke), and their son, the judge's grandson, Charles.<br>
