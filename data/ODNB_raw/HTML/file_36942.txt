<span class="headword">Wilmot, Sir  Sainthill  Eardley-</span>  (1852&#150;1929), <span class="occ">forestry officer in India and Burma</span>, was born in Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land, on 17 July 1852, the third son of Augustus Hillier Eardley-Wilmot, police magistrate in Hobart, and his wife, Matilda Jessie, daughter of John Dunn, banker, of Hobart. His father, who resettled in London in 1855, was the sixth son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/52438/', "Sir John Eardley Eardley-Wilmot, first baronet (1783&#150;1847)")</script>, governor of Van Diemen's Land.<br>
<br>Eardley-Wilmot was educated at East Budleigh, Devon, and, from 1870 to 1873, at a German forestry school in the Harz Mountains. In December 1873 he joined the Indian forestry service, and was posted as an assistant conservator to the Trans-Sarda Forest in Oudh abutting the Nepal border. In the next sixteen years he worked as an executive officer in most of the forests of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh (subsequently entitled United Provinces), with postings to the Bharirathi valley, Kumaon, and Garhwal.<br>
<br>While stationed in Kumaon, Eardley-Wilmot married, on 1 December 1884, Emma Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1890), daughter of George Casey, of Winterbourne, St Leonards, with whom, in 1886, he had a daughter, Helen Jessie. In 1890, in which year Emma died, Eardley-Wilmot was promoted to conservator, an administrative post, and took charge of the forests of Oudh. Relishing the opportunity to exercise professional initiative, over the next eight years he reorganized the management of Oudh's forests, often numbering and ageing their individual trees, and abolished the long-standing practice of felling only the best trees, a system which tended to deplete the forests' &#145;capital&#146;. He was often accompanied on tour by his second wife, Mabel Boisragon (<i>d</i>. 1958), daughter of William Henry Winter of Tunbridge Wells, who was a fine amateur photographer. With Mabel, whom he had married at Lucknow on 12 December 1891, he had a second daughter, (Mabel) Iris, born on 6 August 1893.<br>
<br>In January 1900 Eardley-Wilmot was posted to Upper Burma. He was unhappy in the post, complaining that after twenty-seven years in northern India he could understand neither the language and culture nor the animals and trees of Burma. Notwithstanding this unease, his Burmese forestry work was rated highly by his superiors, and in 1902 Sir Frederick Fryer, lieutenant-governor of Burma, recommended him for the CIE as &#145;one of the best conservators I have known&#146;  (Sir Frederick Fryer to Lord Curzon, 14 July 1902, Curzon MSS, OIOC, BL).<br>
<br>By early 1903 Eardley-Wilmot was prepared to retire from the forestry service if he could not find a more congenial posting than Burma. He was about to ask for the charge of the Forest School at Dehra Dun in the United Provinces, when the inspector-general of Indian forests, H. C. Hill, suddenly died, and Eardley-Wilmot was appointed to the vacancy. He took up his office in Calcutta in February 1903 and was confirmed in the post in the following year. As inspector-general he enhanced both the salaries and status of the forestry service and improved the training of the subordinate executive, establishing elementary forestry schools in each province and initiating a series of educative forestry manuals. In 1906 he set up the Forest Research Institute, with specialist appointments in silviculture, zoology, botany, forest economy and chemistry, and forest working plans. Initially housed in the existing Forest School at Dehra Dun, the institute graduated to prestigious accommodation of its own in 1929.<br>
<br>Eardley-Wilmot retired as inspector-general in 1908, in which year he was also created CIE. He returned to Britain, and in 1910 was appointed to the newly formed Development Commission. In 1911 he was promoted to KCIE. After five years' service on the commission he became its forestry adviser, a post he retained until 1919, when the new Forestry Commission was formed under the aegis of the <span class="roman">Forestry Act</span>. As a commissioner he strove to improve forestry education at British universities and agricultural colleges, and to encourage private proprietors in the work of afforestation.<br>
<br>During his Indian career, Eardley-Wilmot published a number of professional papers and reports on Indian silviculture. Once back in England, however, he turned his pen to less specialist writings, and in 1910 published his autobiographical <span class="italic">Forest Life and Sport in India</span>. In his youth Eardley-Wilmot had been an ardent hunter, and claimed in all to have shot 139 tigers in India, a passion which is amply represented in the early chapters of the book. With age, however, he mellowed, and in his conclusion to <span class="italic">Forest Life and Sport</span> he observes that as an older man he preferred living in a state of neighbourliness with the animals of the forest to hunting them. The book, which achieved the status of a minor classic, was illustrated by his wife's photographs. In 1911 he published <span class="italic">The Life of a Tiger</span> and in 1912 <span class="italic">The Life of an Elephant</span>, imaginary, but unsentimentalized, biographies of a tiger and an elephant, each one born in the wild but subsequently captured and tamed. Mabel's photographs were again used in the books, which in addition featured numerous sketches by their daughter, Iris.<br>
<br>Eardley-Wilmot died at his home, Tollgate Cottage, Henley-on-Thames, Berkshire, on 13 November 1929, after a long illness. He was survived by his wife, who died on 18 August 1958, and by his two daughters. Helen Jessie, the daughter of his first marriage, was appointed MBE in 1955. In 1930 his widow published a collection of Eardley-Wilmot's writings, entitled <span class="italic">Leaves from Indian Forests</span>.<br>
