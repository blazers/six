<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Cosgrave,  William Thomas</span>  (1880&#150;1965), <span class="occ">president of the executive council of the Irish Free State</span>, was born at 174 James Street, Dublin, on 5 June 1880, the second son and second child of Thomas Cosgrave, licensed vintner, of 174 James Street, and his wife, Bridget Nixon. After schooling with the Christian Brothers he entered his father's business, soon turning also to share his father's interest in local politics.<br>
<br>In 1905 Cosgrave participated with Arthur Griffith in the founding of Sinn F&eacute;in and in 1909 was elected a Sinn F&eacute;in representative to Dublin corporation. He served this body for thirteen years, being elected chairman of its estates and finance committee in 1915, and being returned as an alderman in 1920. In 1916, as a lieutenant in the Irish Volunteers, he fought under Eamon Ceannt in the South Dublin Union, was captured and condemned to death, a sentence later commuted to life imprisonment. After one year in Portland prison he was released in the general amnesty of 1917.<br>
<br>Cosgrave entered national politics as a Sinn F&eacute;in abstentionist, winning a two-to-one victory over the parliamentary party candidate, John Magennis, in the Kilkenny City by-election of August 1917. In October 1917 he became one of the honorary treasurers of Sinn F&eacute;in, and in December 1918 was returned unopposed in the general election, for Kilkenny North. At the meeting of the first D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 2 April 1919 he was appointed minister for local government. In that year he married Louise (<i>d</i>. 1959), daughter of Alderman Flanagan, a farmer of Dublin; they had two sons.<br>
<br>In the elections of 1921, 1922, 1923, and June 1927 Cosgrave represented the Carlow&#150;Kilkenny constituency. In the election for the sixth D&aacute;il, in September 1927, he was returned for both Carlow&#150;Kilkenny and Cork borough, topping the poll in each. He chose to sit for the Cork seat and in the elections of February 1932, January 1933, July 1937, June 1938, and June 1943 he topped the poll there on all occasions except 1938. He retired from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1944.<br>
<br>Local government, the seat of much disruption of British administration, was perhaps the true revolutionary arena in the years 1919&#150;21. The department's inspectors and numerous councillors waged a continuous, consciousness-raising battle with the official local government board, withholding allegiance yet striving to retain as many housing and employment moneys as possible. Inefficiency and mismanagement were other characteristics, however, and Cosgrave's experience undoubtedly affected the attitude of the independent Irish government towards local authorities in the years to come, when he himself was to be thrust into greater prominence. A determined advocate of the Anglo-Irish treaty of December 1921, which he felt represented the best settlement available, he accepted membership of the provisional government, established to receive power from Britain, in January 1922, becoming its chairman in August after the death of Griffith and Michael Collins. He added the office of president of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in September 1922, finally becoming the first elected president of the executive council of the Irish Free State on 6 December 1922. He held also the ministry of finance, in 1922&#150;3, and for short periods the Ministry of Defence, in 1924, and the ministry of external affairs, in 1927. Having steered the country through civil war during 1922&#150;3, it was his responsibility to establish the domestic administration and the international reputation of his country, which had assumed a somewhat ambiguous &#145;dominion status&#146; by the 1921 treaty.<br>
<br>Under Cosgrave's wise chairmanship an able cabinet team established full parliamentary, legal, and administrative processes on a foundation of probity and wide acceptance. Orthodox financial management and cautious economic development secured an equally sound reputation for integrity in these spheres. The government's main economic initiative, the harnessing of the River Shannon to generate electricity, also proved a resounding success, while the body established to control it, the Electricity Supply Board (established in 1927), set a pattern of semi-state authorities widely emulated in the future. The failure of the boundary commission to advance Irish unity provided both crisis and disappointment for the government in 1925, but the ensuing agreement with Britain in December of that year was, Cosgrave felt, &#145;a damned good bargain&#146;. His subsequent policy of co-operation with Belfast and of promoting Irish unity through the attraction of good government set a realistic course all too soon interrupted.<br>
<br>Surviving other crises such as the army mutiny in 1924 and the assassination of his vice-president, Kevin O'Higgins, in 1927, Cosgrave enjoyed a personal triumph when he visited the United States and Canada in 1928. Already he had led his country into the League of Nations, in 1923, and at successive imperial conferences, notably 1926 and 1930, his ministers helped expand &#145;dominion status&#146; into full sovereignty, a position given legal force in the 1931 <span class="roman">Statute of Westminster</span>.<br>
<br>With the state firmly founded at home and abroad, and successfully weathering the world depression, Cosgrave suffered defeat in February 1932, but watched with satisfaction the ensuing peaceful change from his administration to that of Eamon De Valera. An unflagging democrat, he recoiled in horror at aspects of the amalgamation of his foundering party with the neo-fascist Blueshirt movement in 1933. When the brief leadership of General O'Duffy ended in September 1934, however, Cosgrave soon returned (spring 1935) as head of the renamed Fine Gael, and led the parliamentary opposition until his retirement in January 1944. His interest in horse-racing was then reflected in his chairmanship of the Irish racing board, from 1946 to 1956, and again from 1957.<br>
<br>Cosgrave received a number of honours during his lifetime, becoming a knight grand cross, first class, of the Pian order, in 1925, and gaining honorary doctorates from the Catholic University of America; Columbia, Cambridge, and Dublin universities; and the National University of Ireland. He died at his home Beechpark, Templeogue, co. Dublin, on 16 November 1965, and was buried in the Golden Bridge cemetery, Inchicore, co. Dublin, two days later. His elder son, Liam, became leader of Fine Gael in 1965, and subsequently taoiseach (prime minister) of a coalition government in 1973.<br>
<br>Regarded by Sir Winston Churchill as &#145;a chief of higher quality than any who had yet appeared&#146;, Cosgrave was throughout his life an unpretentious and modest man. Short in stature, with a shock of hair he retained into old age, he had a lively eye and a ready wit, with gifts of common sense, courage, coolness, good humour, and humanity, which won the respect and affection of opponents as well as supporters. A deeply religious man, courteous and considerate, and a reconciler, he proved more successful in office than as an opposition leader, his greatest work being done in the decade 1922&#150;32. The parliamentary democracy then established against daunting odds remains his most fitting monument.<br>
