<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Brown,  Christy</span>  (1932&#150;1981), <span class="occ">writer and painter</span>, was born on 5 June 1932 at the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin, the son of Patrick Brown (<i>d</i>. 1955), a Catholic bricklayer active in the trade union, and his wife, Bridget Fagan (<i>d</i>. 1968). There were seventeen children in all, thirteen of whom survived into adulthood; Christy was the tenth. Shortly after his birth it became clear that he was suffering from a severe physical disability, later diagnosed as cerebral palsy. This made both movement and speech difficult for him throughout his life as he strove to control wayward movements of his body, and to overcome the physical and psychological inhibitions on achieving self-expression. The family was told he was a &#145;mental defective&#146;&#151;a label mockingly referred to by Brown in the working title of his autobiography, &#145;Reminiscences of a mental defective&#146;&#151;but his indefatigable mother devoted much of her considerable energy to proving the authorities wrong. She became in effect his private tutor since there was then no possibility of formal education. The breakthrough occurred when Christy was six and was watching his older brothers and sisters working on their lessons with chalk and slate. Grabbing hold of both with the only part of his body he could actively direct&#151;his left foot&#151;and with the coaxing of his mother, he wrote a shaky but identifiable letter &#145;A&#146;. As he remarks in his poem on Helen Keller, &#145;that kind of triumph is seldom won&#146;, a temporary liberation from the &#145;deafmute world&#146; in which he seemed condemned to live. Christy's mother went on to teach him all the letters of the alphabet and, armed with that, he soon began to write. The primary medium of communication throughout his growing years was painting, and it offered temporary release from the torment that words themselves brought. He painted throughout his life and had a number of exhibitions; the artistic life offered a more gregarious world than the solitary life of the writer.<br>
<br>When Christy's mother was seriously ill with her last baby, the Rotunda Hospital sent a social worker, Katrina Delahunt, to the Brown household. She immediately took an interest in Christy and his burgeoning artistic potential. In his autobiography he writes of the romantic yearnings stirred in him by the arrival of this beautiful young woman and of the jealousy he suffered when she showed up one day with an engagement ring. This pattern&#151;of romantic longing for the women who entered his world, most often in a caring capacity&#151;repeated itself throughout his life. His waning faith was bolstered by a visit to Lourdes in 1950, and his hopes were raised by the arrival of the paediatrician Dr Robert Collis. Collis wished to develop the study and treatment of cerebral palsy in Ireland and nurtured literary ambitions himself. He judged the nascent autobiography that Christy was writing to be the most promising of his literary productions so far, but was critical of certain stylistic excesses, urging him to use &#145;a short word rather than a long one&#146;. When the autobiography appeared, certain people held it to be the work of Collis; Christy was aware of the charge and countered it by acknowledging the editorial role which Collis had performed and, while they remained friends, by determining to write subsequent works without his input. Collis sent Christy to his sister Dr Eirene Collis, who had established a clinic for children with cerebral palsy at Queen Mary's Hospital, Carshalton. She, like her brother, thought he was treatable, but insisted he give up working with his left foot, and instead develop his whole body equally. The treatment continued back in Dublin, where separate quarters were constructed for Christy in the garden of his family home, becoming a kind of artist's studio. It emphasized his growing independence.<br>
<br>In 1954 the London firm of Secker and Warburg, under the editorship of David Ferrer, published Brown's autobiography <span class="italic">My Left Foot</span> to immediate success. It comprises a series of short, vivid chapters covering his growing up, first with his family, then with a series of social workers, doctors, and carers. The heart of the book is the watchful, loving care of his mother (to whom the book is dedicated), and the close bond between them. It is also the story of Brown's developing relationship with himself, as he struggles to come to terms with his condition, and the highs and lows he experiences. This heightened sense of Brown's determination to follow his own path is frequently at odds with the more conventional narrative of progress that his later novel depicts. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in Brown's decision to overthrow Eirene Collis's advice and to return to writing with his left foot.<br>
<br>The question of how to follow the success of an autobiography published in his early twenties dogged Brown for more than a decade. At first he considered writing a sequel, taking the story up through the years of his success. Instead he wrote something more like a novel, more deliberately literary in its treatment and broadening the social canvas beyond his own life story. <span class="italic">Down All the Days</span> did not appear until 1970, but when it did, it was praised for its novelistic skills, and made more acceptable the notion of Christy Brown as a writer. It revisits the terrain of the autobiography, but is much franker in its treatment of the young man's sexual urges; these form a central part of the ordeal to which his body subjects him. While his father in <span class="italic">My Left Foot</span> remained in the background, the novel is dominated by the hulking figure of the frequently alcoholic bricklayer, alternating between brooding and outbursts of graphically depicted violence, and his baffled relationship with the daughter who defies him. The closing account of the father's death and burial is clearly based on the sudden death of Patrick Brown in 1955. But these realistic scenes are preceded by an impressionistic account of the father's last walk home, which recalls Gypo Nolan in Liam O'Flaherty's <span class="italic">The Informer</span>. His mother is here the one relegated to the background. She is replaced by the Rabelaisian figure of a blowsy, drunken, big-breasted widow, whose gossipy scenes with two other old women form a break with literal autobiography. Bridget Brown, who continued to work despite increasing ill health, died in 1968. Christy's care passed to his married sister Ann Jones.<br>
<br>When <span class="italic">Down All the Days</span> was published in 1970 its worldwide success provided Brown with financial security for the rest of his life. He now occupied the niche vacated by Brendan Behan, writing with the same &#145;sad hilarity&#146; (as his poem on Behan puts it) about working-class Dublin. But the combination of fame and drink induced the same downward spiral. In the remaining eleven years of his life, Brown wrote three more novels, <span class="italic">A Shadow on Summer</span> (1974), <span class="italic">Wild Grow the Lilies</span> (1976), and <span class="italic">A Promising Career</span> (1982), but none achieved the financial success or literary acclaim of his first two books. A more lasting legacy was provided by three volumes of poetry, <span class="italic">Come Softly to my Wake</span> (1971), <span class="italic">Background Music</span> (1973), and <span class="italic">Of Snails and Skylarks</span> (1977), where the poetic form imposes a discipline increasingly lacking in his prose, and where the various lyrical, satirical, and philosophical aspects of his personality achieve expression.<br>
<br>At Easter 1972 Brown became engaged to Mary Carr (<i>b</i>. 1945), a dental hygienist from co. Kerry living in London, daughter of Marie Cecilia Carr. Because she was divorced, they married, on 5 October 1972, in the Dublin register office. In the following year they went to live in Ballyheigue in north Kerry; the poems in <span class="italic">Of Snails and Skylarks</span> speak of increasing depression and solitary drinking amid the natural splendour of north Kerry. The couple moved to Parbrook in Somerset in 1980. Christy Brown died at his home there, Longacre, 2 Withial Lane, on 6 September 1981 after choking on some food. His body was returned to Dublin and buried at Glasnevin cemetery along with his parents. He was survived by his wife.<br>
<br>Brown's funeral was described by his fellow Dubliner Noel Pearson as &#145;probably the most colorful funeral I was ever at&#146;. Ever since meeting Christy at an art exhibition in the early 1970s, Pearson had been fascinated by him&#151;&#145;because of Christy's absolute determination to be normal&#146;&#151;and tried to make a film of <span class="italic">Down All the Days</span>. When the rights to that proved unavailable, Pearson acquired those to <span class="italic">My Left Foot</span>. The final screenplay, by the novelist&#150;actor&#150;playwright Shane Connaughton and the theatre director Jim Sheridan, drew on extra material from the novel and brought the life up to his marriage. The film <span class="italic">My Left Foot</span> was produced by Pearson and directed by Sheridan in 1989, a first work for both men and a labour of love. Daniel Day-Lewis was cast as Christy and won an Oscar for his role, as did Brenda Fricker for hers as Bridget Brown. The film was a worldwide success, exploring Christy and his life with understanding, sympathy, and a complete lack of condescension. His story remains extraordinary. The autobiographical, fictional, and filmic versions of it have earned him what he always hoped for: enduring literary fame.<br>
