<span class="headword">Fisk, Sir  Ernest Thomas</span>  (1886&#150;1965), <span class="occ">entrepreneur and developer of radio</span>, was born on 8 August 1886 at Sunbury, Middlesex, the second child of Thomas Harvey Fisk, builder, and his wife, Charlotte Hariette, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Halland. Educated at St Mary's and Sunbury Boys' schools, Fisk later attended the United Kingdom College, London, a private coaching institution, and the University of Sydney, but sat no examinations. After studying engineering at Frederick Walton's works, Fisk joined the Post Office as a wireless telegraphist. In 1906 he joined Marconi, qualifying as an operator and engineer at Liverpool and Chelmsford, and from 1909 worked for American Marconi, before returning to London.<br>
<br>In 1910 Fisk visited Australia to demonstrate Marconi apparatus. He returned there in 1911 as resident engineer, persuading shipowners to fit Marconi equipment, which he installed, and trained telegraphists to operate. A patent dispute between the Australian government and Marconi in 1912 was resolved in 1913 when a new company, Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd (AWA), was formed with exclusive rights to both Marconi and Telefunken patents. Fisk was appointed general and technical manager, becoming managing director in 1916, and chairman in 1932.<br>
<br>Fisk married Florence, the second daughter of Samuel Chudleigh, music teacher, on 20 December 1916 at St John's Church, Gordon, Sydney. In 1931 Marconi was godfather to Fisk's fourth son, David Sarnoff Marconi.<br>
<br>In 1916 Fisk arranged a series of test transmissions from the Marconi long-wave station at Caernarfon, and, in 1918, the transmission of messages from the prime minister, W. M. Hughes, and Sir Joseph Cook established that direct wireless communication between Britain and Australia was practicable. At the Imperial Conference of 1921, Fisk, as adviser to Hughes, promoted his scheme for direct communication between Britain and the dominions. The Australian government commissioned AWA in 1922; the beam service between Australia and Britain was inaugurated in 1927, and that between Australia and Canada in 1928. In 1927 AWA pioneered empire broadcasting, and in 1930 an empire radio-telephone service. Fisk promoted wireless as integral to the empire, arguing that no scientific discovery offered such great possibility for binding together the parts of the far-flung empire, and for developing its social, commercial, and defence welfare. He promoted the wireless industry as president of the State Wireless Institute of Australia in 1914&#150;22, founded its journal, <span class="italic">Sea, Land and Air</span>, and was president of the Institution of Radio Engineers in the 1930s. As a freemason, he was a member of the Electron chapter at AWA.<br>
<br>Knighted in 1937, Fisk was invited to join the boards of several Australian companies. In 1939 Robert Menzies appointed Fisk secretary of the economic cabinet and director of economic co-ordination, but the position was terminated in 1941. Fisk held many patents: notably his solariscope, for short-wave radio users, and Fisk soundproof windows. His vision for wireless was boundless, raising hopes for an international language, and even the possibility of communicating with the dead; following the death of his son, Thomas Maxwell, in the Second World War, he maintained an interest in spiritualism.<br>
<br>In 1944 Fisk left AWA to become managing director of Electrical and Musical Industries in London, but he returned to Sydney in 1952 as a consultant, concerned with the future of television, and solar, hydro, and nuclear power. Fisk, whose name became synonymous with the development of radio in Australia, died at his home at Roseville, Sydney, on 8 July 1965 and was cremated. He was survived by his wife and three sons.<br>
