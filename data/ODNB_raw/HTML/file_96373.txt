<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Argent,  (Bernard) Godfrey</span>  (1937&#150;2006), <span class="occ">photographer</span>, was born on 6 February 1937 at Taringa, Eastbourne Road, Willingdon, Sussex, the only son of Godfrey Stanley Albert Argent, a motor engineer for a local builders' merchant, and his wife, Helena, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Smith. The couple also had two daughters. He was educated at Bexhill grammar school and, after a brief spell in the police force in Eastbourne (where he was introduced to photography), he entered the Household Cavalry in 1954 in which he served as a corporal in the Life Guards for nine years.<br>
<br>Argent's interest in portrait photography developed while he was stationed at regimental headquarters, Whitehall. In 1960 he won the army's photographic competition and was appointed an associate member of the Royal Photographic Society. Two years later he was asked to photograph Sir Gerald Templer, chief of the imperial general staff, in full dress uniform, on his appointment as colonel of the Royal Horse Guards. Templer's pleasure at the portrait led to further commissions, including an invitation to photograph Prince Philip's uncle, Earl Mountbatten, in the following year. Templer also advised Argent on where his future might lie, informing him that he was &#145;a much better photographer than you will ever be a soldier&#146;, and warning him not to &#145;get to my age and then regret what you might have done&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Independent</span>, 15 June 2006). He duly left the army and, as Godfrey Argent, began work as a freelance photographer in June 1963. Initially his portfolio comprised portrait photography of friends and former army connections, as well as picture postcards of regimental ceremonies and English and Welsh beach scenes. By now he had a young family of three daughters to support, having married Janet Rosemary Boniface (1937&#150;1969), daughter of Robin Boniface, nightwatchman, on 17 November 1956 at St John's Church, Polegate, Sussex. After her death he married, on 29 December 1969, Ann Yvonne Coxon (<i>b</i>. 1939/40), physician, and daughter of James Coxon, businessman, at St Edward's Roman Catholic church, Sutton Park, Woking. They had no children and were divorced in 1973.<br>
<br>On the recommendation of Templer, Argent was invited to provide the illustrations for a forthcoming study of the Royal Mews, published in 1965 as <span class="italic">The Queen Rides</span>. This led to an introduction to the monarch, who evidently warmed to the young photographer, and opened the way to Argent's emergence in the late 1960s as a leading royal portraitist specializing in elegant black and white images. In June 1966 he was invited to photograph Princess Anne on her sixteenth birthday and followed this with studies of the eighteen-year-old Prince Charles (also in 1966), the last portraits of Prince Philip's mother, Princess Andrew of Greece (1967), a portrait for the postage stamp marking Charles's investiture as the prince of Wales in 1968 (one of many studies of the prince to 1974), and group portraits for the royal family's Christmas cards (1966&#150;74). Part of the success of these commissions lay in Argent's ability&#151;a skill perhaps honed in the army&#151;to combine deference to his sitters with a charming, relaxed, sometimes playful manner. Even so, he admitted to feeling &#145;physically sick with tension&#146; before sittings throughout his career  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 30 June 2006).<br>
<br>Argent's work as a royal photographer coincided with his growing reputation as an artist and businessman. An invitation to join the prestigious Camera Press picture agency (whose clients included lords Snowdon and Lichfield, Cecil Beaton, and Yousuf Karsh, whose work Argent greatly admired), was followed in 1967 by his purchase of the business of another leading portrait photographer, Walter Bird. This brought Argent both a new studio, at 49 Queen's Gate, London, and the post (replacing Bird) of official photographer of the National Photographic Record, a collection of portraits of noteworthy Britons established on behalf of the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) in 1917. Argent's appointment came soon after Roy Strong's as director of the NPG. With Strong eager to see the record broadened to include studies of &#145;people who are actively doing things&#146;, Argent's four-year tenure included photographs of David Attenborough, Alan Bennett, John Betjeman, Sir No&euml;l Coward, and Spike Milligan. A selection of the 650 portraits Argent created for the record was exhibited as a one-man show at the NPG in 1972. From 1967 until 1993 he was also the official portrait photographer for the Royal Society, for whom he undertook 750 portraits, including studies of Sir Ernst Chain, Dorothy Hodgkin, Francis Crick, and Stephen Hawking.<br>
<br>Alongside these official positions Argent continued to develop his private business. In 1967 he began a long-running association with the theatre as cast photographer for <span class="italic">The Mousetrap</span>, a commission he undertook annually on a further twenty-two occasions and combined with similar records for other productions. In 1974 he moved to new premises at 8 Holland Street, Kensington, and in the same year he purchased the Mayfair studio of the dance and society photographer Baron (Sterling Henry Nahum); the sale also gave Argent the lucrative copyright to Baron's negatives, which in turn he presented to the NPG in 1998.<br>
<br>Now established as one of the capital's leading society photographers, with a speciality in corporate, military, and family studies, Argent undertook a number of overseas commissions from the 1970s. In 1976 an exhibition in Johannesburg included portraits of the politicians John Vorster, P. W. Botha, and Helen Suzman, the transplant surgeon Christiaan Barnard, the author Alan Paton, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Argent had written to these and other prominent South Africans to request a sitting while visiting the country on honeymoon with his third wife, Sally Dorothy McAlpine (<i>b</i>. 1951/2), whom he married on 25 April 1975 at Westminster register office; the couple had one daughter and were divorced in 1990. Further shows in Cape Town and Durban (1977) were followed by several visits to Los Angeles, where he photographed the city's mayor Tom Bradley and exhibited in 1978. Argent later worked from his London home, 8 Ladbroke Walk, near Holland Park, and from the late 1990s combined this with portrait painting in oils. In 2005 he held his final exhibition at the Special Photographers' Gallery, London, by which time his photographic commissions and other work totalled more than 9000 images.<br>
<br>Godfrey Argent died on 1 June 2006 from cancer of the oesophagus at Pembridge palliative care centre, St Charles's Hospital, Kensington, London. He was survived by his four daughters. Between 2007 and 2009 his contribution to photography was marked with the Godfrey Argent award for the most outstanding black and white photograph or the best photographer aged twenty-five and under at the NPG's annual portrait competition.<br>
