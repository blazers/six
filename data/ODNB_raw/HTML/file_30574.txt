<span class="headword">Banks,  Leslie James</span>  (1890&#150;1952), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born on 9 June 1890 in West Derby, Liverpool, Lancashire, son of George Banks, general merchant, and his wife, Emily Dalby. He won a classical scholarship at Trinity College, Glenalmond, and then went on to Keble College, Oxford, again as a classical scholar. He made his first professional appearance on the stage in 1911 at the town hall, Brechin, as Old Gobbo in <span class="italic">The Merchant of Venice</span> with the company of Frank Benson. He remained with Benson until the following year, when he went on tour with George Dance's company in <span class="italic">The Hope</span> by Cecil Raleigh and Henry Hamilton, a racing melodrama from Drury Lane. He then joined H. V. Esmond and Eva Moore in a tour of the United States and Canada, making his first New York appearance in a small part in Esmond's comedy <span class="italic">Eliza Comes to Stay</span>. Returning to London he made his West End d&eacute;but at the Vaudeville in May 1914, in Esmond's <span class="italic">The Dangerous Age</span>.<br>
<br>The First World War cut short Banks's career just as it was beginning to show promise. He served in the Essex regiment, receiving a disfiguring wound in the face that might have driven a weaker character to seek some less public profession. Banks never allowed it to deter him and when he started acting again after the war he found that it did not handicap him. In 1915 Banks married Gwendoline Haldane, daughter of Edwin Thomas Unwin; they had three daughters. A month after the armistice he made a fresh start under Nigel Playfair at the Lyric, Hammersmith; from there he went to the Birmingham repertory theatre under Barry Jackson, and in 1919&#150;20 he played leads in the repertory company of Lena Ashwell. A Shaw season at the Everyman, Hampstead, followed early in 1921, and in May of the same year he had his first important part in a successful West End play, as Archie Beal in <span class="italic">If</span> by Lord Dunsany at the Ambassadors.<br>
<br>In little more than two years Banks had established himself in the good opinion of most of the managements in London at a time when the disillusion consequent on the war had forced down the standard of public taste to a depressingly low level. Because he was so much in demand he was free to pick the plays in which he wanted to act, and to study the long list of parts he played is to realize what care he took to avoid claptrap or rubbish. To see Leslie Banks's name on a playbill or in a theatre programme was to be given a virtual guarantee that the play had merit. He was an actor of very wide range and as his services were constantly in demand in films as well as on the stage he was able to avoid being stereotyped. No better evidence of this need be asked for than the fact that in a season of repertory with John Gielgud's company at the Haymarket, from October 1944 to June 1945, he played Lord Porteous in W. Somerset Maugham's <span class="italic">The Circle</span>, Tattle in Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>, Claudius in <span class="italic">Hamlet</span>, Bottom in <span class="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream</span>, and Antonio Bologna in Webster's <span class="italic">The Duchess of Malfi</span>; he also played such disparate leading roles as those in <span class="italic">Goodbye Mr Chips</span> (1938) and <span class="italic">Life with Father</span> (1947). Among the many films in which he appeared were the Hitchcock productions <span class="italic">The Man Who Knew Too Much</span> (1934) and <span class="italic">Jamaica Inn</span> (1939). Banks belonged to that stalwart type of actor which, ranking as leading man rather than popular star, is able for that very reason to reach a pitch of distinction in his career that many stars miss.<br>
<br>One of the most variously talented and deeply respected figures on the British stage of his time, no man in private life ever looked or behaved less like the popular conception of an actor. Banks showed no trace of that exhibitionism, that desire to be noticed, which is the motivating force with many actors of every degree of distinction. &#145;He remained through all his success&#146;, said A. A. Milne, &#145;the man next door, a good neighbour and a good friend&#146;. Yet the serene integrity of his nature did not interfere with his versatility as an artist. He was able to understand and play with sympathy a character with whom it seemed he could have nothing at all in common: as Gerald Coates in <span class="italic">Grand National Night</span> at the Apollo in 1946 the character's besetting fault, which brought him to ruin, was a streak of wild recklessness&#151;it was unthinkable that Leslie Banks in his own person could ever yield to such weakness. He was also a successful producer, among his productions being Galsworthy's <span class="italic">The Eldest Son</span> (Everyman, 1928) and Norman MacOwan's <span class="italic">The Infinite Shoeblack</span> (1929). Banks was appointed CBE in 1950 and he died at his home, 27 South Terrace, Kensington, London, on 21 April 1952.<br>
