<span class="headword">Lambert,  Aylmer Bourke</span>  (1761&#150;1842), <span class="occ">botanist</span>, was born on 2 February 1761 at Bath, the only son of Edmund Lambert (<i>d</i>. 1802), landowner, of Boyton House, Wiltshire, and his first wife, the Hon. Bridget Bourke (<i>d</i>. 1773), daughter and heir of John Bourke, eighth Viscount Mayo. As a child he began to collect objects to form a little museum, and amassing botanical collections, together with horticulture, became a lifelong obsession. He was educated at Newsome's School in Hackney but spent his holidays at Hanford, Dorset, with Henry Seymer (1714&#150;1785), brother of his father's second wife, a keen naturalist and gardener. Through Seymer, young Lambert came to know Richard Pulteney (1730&#150;1801), the botanical historian, and Margaret, dowager duchess of Portland (1715&#150;1785), likewise a botanist and gardener.<br>
<br>In January 1779 Lambert entered St Mary Hall, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner. However, although he became well acquainted with the Oxford botanists Daniel Lyons (1762&#150;1834) and John Sibthorp (1758&#150;1796) and continued to develop his interests in the subject, he left Oxford in 1782 without taking a degree. In December that year he married a young widow, Catherine Webster, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Bowater (<i>d</i>. 1828), whose gracious hospitality and charm endeared her to Lambert's many botanical friends. Among these were Sir Joseph Banks (1743&#150;1820) and James Edward Smith (1759&#150;1828).<br>
<br>When Smith, together with Samuel Goodenough (1743&#150;1827) and Thomas Marsham (<i>d</i>. 1819), founded the Linnean Society of London in 1788, Lambert became a member and was appointed a vice-president in 1796. (At his death in 1842 he was the last remaining original member.) He contributed to the society's <span class="italic">Transactions</span> a few small papers.<br>
<br>A keen field botanist, Lambert formed a herbarium of British and Irish plants. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1791. Interested in many branches of natural history, in 1829 he joined the Wiltshire historian Sir Richard Colt Hoare (1738&#150;1838) in the excavation of tumuli, subsequently becoming a member of the Society of Antiquaries. Near Boyton he found, for the first time in Britain, <i>Cirsium tuberosum</i> (<i>Cnicus tuberosus</i>), a rare species of thistle.<br>
<br>In 1789 Lambert went to Connaught in Ireland and in 1790 he did much botanizing in Mayo. There he met the ailing veteran Irish botanist Patrick Browne (1730&#150;1790), who gave him his list of plants of Mayo and Galway. Lambert ultimately gave the list to Smith, but it remained unpublished until 1995. In 1797 Lambert published <span class="italic">A Description of the Genus Cinchona</span> but he was already planning a grand folio book on conifers, <span class="italic">A Description of the Genus Pinus</span>, with engraved plates drawn by Ferdinand Bauer (1760&#150;1826), among the finest (and most expensive) conifer illustrations ever produced. The latter was published in seven parts between 1803 and 1807 in a manner so irregular that copies vary in contents; a plain copy cost 10 guineas, a coloured one 40 guineas. A second volume, largely the work of Lambert's herbarium curator and librarian, David Don (1799&#150;1841), was published in 1824. A second edition, published between 1828 and 1837, included conifers other than <i>Pinus</i>, together with an account of Lambert's herbarium by Don. The variation between copies, indicative of Lambert's lack of control over their issue, has made the work, Lambert's major claim to botanical fame, a bibliographer's nightmare.<br>
<br>On his father's death in 1802 Lambert became a wealthy man of leisure, owning Boyton House (the family property since 1527) and houses in Salisbury and London. He also received income from sugar plantations in Jamaica and estates in England and Ireland. Year by year he acquired, both by gift and by lavish purchases, many collections of dried plants (herbaria). However, he did not organize these into one scientific sequence for research purposes&#151;as Banks, Hooker, Lindley, and Bentham did&#151;but merely kept them as separate lots, which made their consultation difficult and led ultimately to their sale and disastrous dispersal in 1842. Yet Lambert did make his collections freely available for study by others, particularly foreign visitors such as Augustin Pyramus de Candolle (1778&#150;1841). He was overjoyed when such visitors found species new to science within the herberia. David Don, especially, based accounts of genera on the specimens under his care, as also did his brother George Don (1798&#150;1856) in his <span class="italic">A General System of Gardening and Botany</span> (1831&#150;8).<br>
<br>Lambert, a genial and generous (if eccentric) man, needed and enjoyed the intellectual support and friendship of strong-willed botanists such as Banks, Smith, David Don, and William Jackson Hooker (1785&#150;1865). Of these, only Hooker survived during Lambert's last years. Towards the end, Lambert's income greatly diminished but his expenditure did not. His financial and domestic affairs became chaotic, his debts staggering. Ill health and family disputes marred the end of his life. He died on 10 January 1842 at Kew and was buried in the church at Boyton House.<br>
<br>Lambert's will directed that his herbarium should be offered to the British Museum provided the trustees paid his debts, apparently amounting to &pound;2500 even after sale of his London house, botanical library (comprising 689 items), and paintings. This the trustees declined to do. As a result, his botanical acquisitions, described at the time as being in a state of great confusion, were dispersed in three days (27&#150;29 June 1842) by auction. A detailed study of the history and subsequent whereabouts of Lambert's collection  (<span class="italic">Taxon</span>, 19, 1970, 489&#150;656) showed that it had been widely dispersed. Portions of the collection were preserved at Cambridge, Geneva, Florence, Kew, Oxford, and Philadelphia; the part which had gone to Berlin was destroyed in the Second World War. It was a sad end to Lambert's ambition and efforts, and a disaster to botany through the scattering of type-specimens. The generic name <i>Lambertia</i> Smith commemorates him.<br>
