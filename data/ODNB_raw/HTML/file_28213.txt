<span class="headword">Vere,  John  de</span>, twelfth earl of Oxford  (1408&#150;1462), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the elder son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/101270/', "Richard de Vere, eleventh earl of Oxford (1385&#150;1417)")</script>, and his second wife, Alice (<i>d</i>. 1452), daughter of Sir Richard Sergeaux and widow of Guy de St Aubyn. He was born on 23 April 1408 at Castle Hedingham, the family seat in Essex. He inherited his title as a minor on his father's death in February 1417; custody of the heir and his estates was granted to Thomas Beaufort, duke of Exeter, who had established himself as the leading magnate in East Anglia during the previous decade. In 1425, still a minor, the earl married Elizabeth (<i>c</i>.1410&#150;1473/4), daughter and heir of Sir John Howard. On the death of her grandfather in 1438, the couple took possession of her inheritance in Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and Cambridgeshire. The marriage was contracted without the king's licence&#151;although Oxford was later to claim that it had been arranged by the advice of his guardian the duke of Exeter&#151;and the earl was fined &pound;2000, a sum that he had difficulty paying. The earldom of Oxford was among the poorest of the comital titles; in 1437 de Vere claimed that his lands were worth only &pound;500 per year, although he may have exaggerated his poverty somewhat.<br>
<br>When Exeter died in 1426, custody of the Oxford estates was granted to the duke of Bedford. De Vere was granted livery of his inheritance on 4 July 1429. He had already been knighted, at the same time as the four-year-old king, in May 1426. During the 1430s and most of the 1440s, Oxford's political activity at a local level was concentrated in Essex, where the bulk of his estates lay. He was a regular member of the peace commission there from 1429, as well as serving on commissions to raise loans and levy taxes in the shire. He was also consistently appointed as a JP in Suffolk from 1438, and in Cambridgeshire from 1443; both were counties in which he held a number of manors. In February 1435 he secured a licence to travel to the Holy Land, but there is no evidence that he made the journey; certainly there was no significant interruption in his appointment to local commissions.<br>
<br>Oxford also began to be involved in political, military, and diplomatic activities at a national level. In July 1436 he mustered his retinue at Sandwich for the expedition to relieve Calais from Burgundian siege. In June 1439, with Cardinal Beaufort and other envoys, he took part in the inconclusive negotiations with the French at Oye. Two years later he and his retinue accompanied the duke of York, the king's new lieutenant in France, to Normandy. In June 1450 the earl was among the nobles appointed to act against Cade's rebels.<br>
<br>In the late 1440s Oxford became significantly involved for the first time in politics in Norfolk, where some of his wife's estates lay. He had been appointed a JP in the shire once in 1438, but it was only from 1448 that he became a regular member of the peace commission there. In 1450, after the fall from power of William de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, Oxford took a leading role&#151;together with John (VI) Mowbray, duke of Norfolk, and Sir John Fastolf&#151;in attempts to undermine the local power of Suffolk's servants, who had dominated the region during the 1440s. Initially these attempts seemed to make some headway. In August 1450, for example, Oxford and the duke of Norfolk were appointed to lead a general commission of oyer and terminer in Norfolk and Suffolk, before which several of Suffolk's leading supporters were indicted. However, by the spring of 1451 Suffolk's associates&#151;whose power in the region was wide-ranging and long-standing&#151;were successfully regrouping under the leadership of Thomas, Lord Scales, and the widowed duchess of Suffolk. Despite the best attempts of Oxford, who spent a substantial amount of time at his wife's manor of Winch in western Norfolk during this period, and of the duke of Norfolk, Suffolk's men were acquitted of most of the charges laid against them, and by 1452 leading members of Suffolk's affinity, such as Sir Thomas Tuddenham and John Heydon, were again being appointed to office in the region.<br>
<br>It took some time for Oxford's allegiances to become clear as politics became increasingly divided and increasingly confused during the 1450s. He was a member of the protectorate council and was among the nobles appointed to the keeping of the seas in the spring of 1454, but does not seem to have had close associations either with the court or with the protector York at this point. Political division became armed confrontation at St Albans in May 1455, but neither Oxford nor the duke of Norfolk took part in the battle because they arrived a day too late. The earl does not seem to have established a decisive association with either camp until 1459, when he committed himself to the queen against York; in December of that year, and in the following April, he was appointed to lead anti-Yorkist commissions of array in Essex. By May 1460 his eldest son, Aubrey&#151;who had recently married Anne, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26207/', "Humphrey Stafford, duke of Buckingham")</script>&#151;was reported by one of the Paston correspondents to be &#145;great with the Queen&#146;.<br>
<br>The Yorkist victory at Northampton in July 1460 seems to have been followed by a period of illness&#151;whether real or tactical&#151;for Oxford; in November of that year he was exempted, &#145;in consideration of his infirmities&#146;, from appearing in person before the king or in council or parliament. If the earl was trying to maintain a low profile in the face of the new regime, it was an attempt that did not long survive the accession of Edward IV. In February 1462, with his son Aubrey and Sir Thomas Tuddenham, Oxford's former opponent in Norfolk and now a fellow Lancastrian loyalist, the earl was arrested on charges of high treason and committed to the Tower of London. He was tried before the constable of England, John Tiptoft, earl of Worcester, and condemned to death. On 26 February he was beheaded on Tower Hill, and was buried in the church of the Austin friars in London. It was a dramatic end to a career of which the most consistent feature had apparently been Oxford's unwillingness to take sides in the developing political conflict until the last possible moment. His son Aubrey had been executed six days earlier; the earl was therefore succeeded by his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28214/', "John de Vere")</script>.<br>
