<span class="headword">Willes <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Hodges]</span>,  Christiana</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1786, <em>d.</em> 1873), <span class="occ">pioneer of round-arm bowling in cricket</span>, was baptized at Headcorn, Kent, on 20 February 1786, the daughter of William Willes, landowner, and his wife, Sarah Snelling. In 1794 her father inherited the manor of Tonford, near Canterbury. The name Christina, by which she is known to cricketing posterity, is incorrect.<br>
<br>Christina Willes's brother John Willes (1778&#150;1852) was a Kent farmer and county cricketer. She has been credited with giving him the inspiration to develop the round-arm bowling style, in which the arm is raised to shoulder height before delivery of the ball&#151;the forerunner of modern, overarm bowling. Tom Walker of Hambledon Cricket Club in Hampshire had been the first to try this out, without success, about 1800. Christiana is reputed to have resorted to this technique when bowling at her brother in a barn on the family estate at Tonford because the voluminous, crinoline-supported skirts then in fashion (<i>c</i>.1807) prevented her from employing the usual, underarm bowling method. John Willes first bowled round-arm at Lord's in 1806; ten years later the MCC formally outlawed the practice, but Willes continued to use the style in county games and tried it once again at Lord's, famously, in a match between Kent and the MCC in 1822. He was no-balled for throwing&#151;becoming the first player to incur this penalty&#151;and reportedly rode out of Lord's &#145;in high dudgeon&#146;, vowing never to play the game again  (Frindall, 14). The umpire reputedly acted under the influence of Lord Frederick Beauclerk, a formidable cricketing presence of the era and a decided opponent of the innovation. After holding trials in the previous year the MCC gave its approval to round-arm bowling in 1828; the change was formally written into a full revision of the game's rules in 1835.<br>
<br>Christiana Willes had meanwhile married Lieutenant Richard Thomas Hodges RN (<i>b</i>. 1782/3) of Maidstone, at St Dunstan's, Canterbury, on 24 September 1810. Richard Hodges was probably the man of that name recorded as living in Romney Place, Maidstone, in electoral registers of 1832 and 1833; the absence of any members of the family from local burial registers thereafter suggests that they may have moved away from the area. A son, Edward Hodges, had been born at John Willes's home at Bellingham, Sutton Valence, on 11 February 1819, and followed in his uncle's footsteps by playing for Kent. Widowed by 1841, Christiana Hodges died at South View, Ealing, Middlesex, on 14 June 1873.<br>
<br>It was Edward Hodges who, in <span class="italic">Cricket</span> magazine of 28 March 1907, wrote of his mother's contribution to the development of the game:<blockquote>It was my mother's skill in <i>throwing</i> the ball to him [John Willes] for practice in the barn at Tonford &hellip; He then trained a dog to fetch the ball, and there was a saying that Willes, his sister, and his dog could beat any eleven in England.</blockquote>This version of the story&#151;which appears to be the earliest and omits any reference to crinoline skirts&#151;was repeated in Edward Hodges's obituary in <span class="italic">Wisden</span> for the following year (he died at Southsea on 20 February 1907) and was taken up subsequently by the cricket historian Frederick Ashley-Cooper  (<span class="italic">Highways and Byways</span>, 1927, 50). Doubt has since been cast on the authenticity of the tale (for instance by Rowland Bowen in <span class="italic">Cricket: a History</span>, 1970, p. 180); the suggestion that John Willes took his cue from his sister could, it has been postulated, have had its origins in the playful ridicule of contemporaries. Others, including E. W. Swanton, have been happy to take it at face value. Whatever the truth, the story&#151;and the name of Christiana Willes&#151;has become a part of cricketing lore. Her name has been invoked by historians of women's cricket as that of the first of her sex to assist in the game's technical development, and was mentioned, inevitably, in coverage of the battles over the discriminatory admission policies of the MCC, which belatedly opened its doors to women members in 1999.<br>
