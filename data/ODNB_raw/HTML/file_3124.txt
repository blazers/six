<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Boyle,  Charles</span>, fourth earl of Orrery  (1674&#150;1731), <span class="occ">politician and Jacobite conspirator</span>, was born in Little Chelsea near Kensington, Middlesex, on 28 July 1674, not 1676 as stated in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>, and was baptized on 1 August at St Mary's, Kensington, the youngest son of Roger Boyle, second earl of Orrery (1646&#150;1682), and his wife, Lady Mary Sackville (1648&#150;1710), daughter of Richard Sackville, fifth earl of Dorset. His grandfather was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3138/', "Roger Boyle, first earl of Orrery")</script>, a Cromwellian minister and playwright, and his great-uncle was the natural philosopher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3137/', "Robert Boyle")</script>.<h2>
<a name="Upbringingeducationandliterarycareer"></a>Upbringing, education, and literary career</h2>Following the separation of his parents in the 1670s, Boyle was brought up by his mother at Knole in Kent, the seat of his uncle, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/24442/', "Charles Sackville, sixth earl of Dorset")</script>. Educated first at a school in Sevenoaks and then at St Paul's School, London, he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1690, aged fifteen, where he studied with Francis Atterbury, later bishop of Rochester and a co-conspirator for the Jacobite cause. A &#145;studious man not given to the lifestyle of many peers' sons&#146;  (Bennett, 380), Boyle was the only nobleman to take a degree from the college during a thirty-year period.<br>
<br>Boyle's abilities undoubtedly generated respect and led to his involvement in a famous episode, recalled in Swift's <span class="italic">Battle of the Books</span>, during the long-running controversy between the &#145;ancients&#146; of Christ Church and &#145;moderns&#146; led by the Cambridge classicist Richard Bentley. To showcase the talents of their young scholar, the dean of Christ Church, Henry Aldrich, had assigned Boyle to translate the <span class="italic">Epistles of Phalaris</span>, a collection of letters supposedly the work of a Sicilian dating from the fifth century <span class="smallcap">BC</span>. However, Boyle believed that his research on the <span class="italic">Epistles</span> (which, via a third party, required him to consult the collection at the king's library at St James's, Westminster) had been hindered by Bentley, the collection's custodian. His incomplete edition appeared in 1695, a year after his graduation, and contained a prefatory remark concerning Bentley's disobliging manner which proved the catalyst for the controversy. Embarrassed and insulted, within four years Bentley had produced two dissertations on the epistles which disproved Phalaris's authenticity; subsequent rejoinders to Bentley (principally <span class="italic">Dr Bentley's Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris &hellip; examin'd</span>, 1698), though attributed to Boyle, were almost certainly written by Atterbury and fellow Oxford ancients. Boyle's Oxford years also saw the development of a wide-ranging intellectual curiosity evident in his growing personal library (ultimately consisting of 10,000 volumes, and now preserved at Christ Church), which constitutes a comprehensive corpus of medical and scientific treatises between 1690 and 1730. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1706, Boyle later supported the Quaker horologist and scientific instrument-maker George Graham, whose tellurion&#151;an instrument to display the motion of the moon, sun, and earth&#151;was renamed the orrery after the earl.<br>
<br>After Oxford, Boyle also continued to produce works of literary scholarship, as well as satirical poems and a play, <span class="italic">As you Find it</span> (1703), on the then popular theme of marital discord and reconciliation. In addition to George Graham, Orrery supported several prominent writers of the day, including the poet Elijah Fenton, whose <span class="italic">Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany Poems</span> (1708) contained two of the earl's lyrical verses, and the dramatists Thomas Southerne and George Farquhar, whose most celebrated work, <span class="italic">The Recruiting Officer</span>, was based on his experiences in Boyle's (then Orrery's) Irish regiment.<h2>
<a name="Politicalcareer16951714"></a>Political career, 1695&#150;1714</h2>Boyle's public career began with his election to the family borough seat at Charleville, co. Cork, which he represented from 1695 to 1699. In 1701 he ran, successfully, for election to one of the borough seats for Huntingdon. His defeated opponent, John Pedley, disputed the election, and in a petition accused Boyle of improprieties including the intervention of an unnamed peer who with &#145;Swords &amp; Clubs&#146; had threatened to &#145;menace, assault, and strike the Recorders of the said Borough and others of the Petitioner's Voters&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 13.333). Boyle denounced these charges in the Commons, and Pedley's petition was later withdrawn. However, Francis Wortley, borough recorder and a fellow Huntingdon MP, whom Boyle mildly ridiculed in his speech, confronted him in a duel in Hyde Park on 27 March 1701. In a bitter struggle Boyle was seriously wounded and spent several months recuperating. Following his brother's death in 1703, he was raised to the Irish peerage as fourth earl of Orrery. Voting fairly consistently along tory lines, he was re-elected for Huntingdon in subsequent elections. In the year after his ennoblement he purchased a colonel's commission and thereafter held the colonelcies of three major regiments of foot. His military career was aided by a long-standing friendship with John, second duke of Argyll, who arranged for his award of the order of knight of the Thistle.<br>
<br>On 30 March 1706 Orrery married Lady Elizabeth Cecil (<i>c</i>.1687&#150;1708), sister of the sixth earl of Exeter, at a ceremony at Burghley House. On 2 January 1707 their only child, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3129/', "John Boyle (styled Lord Boyle and later fifth earl)")</script> was born, the countess dying in June of the following year. Orrery never remarried, although from at least 1718 he maintained an intimate relationship with Margaret Swordfeger (<i>d</i>. 1741), the wife of his secretary, who became his consort and mistress. With her Orrery had two sons, Charles and Boyle, and two daughters, Clementina and Martha Sophia, names which belie the earl's by then well-formed Jacobite sympathies.<br>
<br>During 1709 and 1710 Orrery participated in three military campaigns in Flanders, and was involved in fierce fighting at Malplaquet and the siege of B&eacute;thune. Now a major-general in the prestigious Royal Scots Fusiliers (1710), he advised the first minister, Robert Harley, on military reforms designed to offset the influence of their mutual political opponent, the duke of Marlborough. From 1711 to June 1713 he served as the queen's envoy-extraordinary at Brussels and The Hague. His attachment to Harley also brought him a place on the privy council (1711) and a seat in the Lords as Baron Boyle of Marston, Somerset. Yet growing dissatisfaction with the apparent duplicity of Harley (now earl of Oxford) prompted him to follow Argyll into opposition in 1713.<h2>
<a name="Jacobitepolitics"></a>Jacobite politics</h2>Following the Hanoverian succession Orrery was designated lord lieutenant of Somerset and lord of the bedchamber to George I. Within two years, however, he was a victim of Argyll's fall from court grace following the duke's unacceptably close intrigues with the prince of Wales. Forced to dispose of his regiment and commission, Orrery joined the dissident whigs under Argyll's leadership, a relationship which was instrumental in his conversion to the Jacobite cause. As a disgruntled former courtier with diplomatic, military, and political experience, Orrery was a valuable individual for the exiled Stuarts and was now sought out by the Jacobite secretary of state, the earl of Mar. By late 1717 Orrery had embraced Jacobitism, although his ongoing circumspection and caution in correspondence drew criticism from fellow conspirators. A firm believer of the need for a sizeable foreign army as an essential requirement of a successful Jacobite invasion, he also insisted that the Stuarts guarantee the security of the Anglican church to their potential supporters.<br>
<br>After 1716 Orrery became a permanent member of the parliamentary opposition, joining forces with staunch tories and suspected Jacobites, and engaging in numerous foolhardy protests designed to annoy the whig ministries of Stanhope, Sunderland, and Walpole. By the early 1720s he was instrumental in many of these protests and has often been included in the handful of tory leaders associated with the Atterbury conspiracy of summer 1722, which resulted in the execution of Christopher Layer for treason in the following year. In fact, while undoubtedly close to Bishop Atterbury, and receiving a military commission from James Edward Stuart, the Jacobite Pretender, Orrery almost certainly did not advocate or assist in the planning of the conspiracy, and was then otherwise engaged in raising money to return tories to parliament.<br>
<br>None the less, Orrery's association with Layer and Atterbury prompted his arrest and imprisonment in the Tower from late September 1722 to March of the following year. His release on bail of &pound;50,000 was granted only after desperate appeals from his family and medical testimonials claiming that his life was in danger. After a protracted convalescence Orrery resumed his parliamentary opposition, as well as his Jacobite activities, assisted after 1725 by a close friend and fellow officer, Colonel William Cecil. In 1725 he undertook the second of his missions (the first being in 1720) to the French court to solicit support for the Jacobite cause. The former was hindered by its coinciding with the financial crisis caused by the collapse of the Mississippi Company; the second failed largely as a result of its emissary's timidity. Plans for a third journey were underway when Orrery died at his house in Downing Street, Westminster, on 28 August 1731. He was buried on 11 September at Westminster Abbey.<br>
<br>Orrery's will reveals the extent to which relations had broken down between the fourth earl and his son, John, who now inherited the Irish and English titles. The worsening relations had been prompted by John's dislike of Margaret Swordfeger, a sentiment he shared by the late 1720s with his new in-laws, the earl and countess of Orkney. This opposition prompted Orrery to draft a will which, to the disgust of his legitimate heir, entitled Margaret and her children to a generous provision of nearly &pound;10,000 to be supplemented by the fifth earl if required. Following Margaret's death in 1741, her two eldest children sought to collect their mother's bequest in full, but were cut off by the fifth earl following Clementina's marriage to a Roman Catholic. The fourth earl's claim that John lacked the &#145;Inclination either for Entertainment or Knowledge which study and Learning afford&#146;  (will, TNA: PRO, PROB 11/646, fols. 241&#150;2) led him to bequeath his library and instrument collection to Christ Church, Oxford. Although father and son were reconciled before the fourth earl's death, his will was never revised.<br>
