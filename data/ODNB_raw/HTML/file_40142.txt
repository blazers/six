<span class="headword">Mason, Sir  Frank Trowbridge</span>  (1900&#150;1988), <span class="occ">naval officer and engineer</span>, was born in Ipswich on 25 April 1900, the elder son and elder child of Frank John Mason MBE, draper and later JP and mayor of Ipswich, and his wife, Marian Elizabeth Trowbridge. He was educated at Ipswich School, passing into the Royal Navy (executive branch) as a special entry (public school) cadet in 1918. After two years as a cadet and midshipman in HMS <i>Collingwood</i> and HMS <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, he volunteered to specialize in engineering (E). He underwent specialist engineering training at the Royal Naval colleges at Greenwich and Keyham. In 1923 he qualified for his engineering watch-keeping certificate in HMS <i>Malaya</i> and was promoted to lieutenant (E), continuing his service in that ship as a fully qualified mechanical and marine engineer until appointed in 1925 to HM Dockyard, Malta.<br>
<br>In 1928 Mason was appointed to HMS <i>Rodney</i>, a new battleship then undergoing severe problems with her novel 16-inch guns. His engineering skill in securing improved reliability led him to specialize in ordnance engineering and to his reappointment after a short period with Messrs Vickers at Elswick. After promotion to lieutenant-commander (E) he served for three years in the naval ordnance department and in 1933&#150;4 he again served in HMS <i>Rodney</i>, but this time as senior (second) engineer, responsible to the commander (E) for all propulsion, electricity generating, and &#145;hotel services&#146; machinery and equipment. Following his next promotion to commander (E) in December 1934, he served again for three years in the naval ordnance department. From there he was appointed as engineer officer (chief engineer) to a new cruiser, HMS <i>Galatea</i>, then flagship of the rear-admiral, destroyers. In 1939 he became the first commander (E) to serve in HMS <i>Excellent</i>, then the naval gunnery school. He was appointed in 1943 as fleet gunnery engineer officer to the Home Fleet in Scapa Flow, and at the same time received promotion to captain (E).<br>
<br>From 1944 Mason served again in the naval ordnance department in the Admiralty (Bath) and in 1947 became chief gunnery engineer officer and deputy director of naval ordnance. In 1949 he was the first engineering specialist to become a student at the Imperial Defence College (later the Royal College of Defence Studies) and, on promotion to rear-admiral, from 1950 to 1952 he held the post of deputy engineer-in-chief of the fleet. After a year on the staff of the commander-in-chief, the Nore, he was promoted to vice-admiral (E) in 1953 and assumed the post of engineer-in-chief of the fleet. He was appointed CB in 1953 and KCB in 1955. He was placed on the inactive list of the Royal Navy in 1957.<br>
<br>By the 1950s Mason was among the last of those naval officers still serving who had entered under the Selborne&#150;Fisher scheme of 1903, whose aim was to put engineers in the main stream of naval life. The scheme was cancelled in 1923 and the navy entered the Second World War technologically bereft. In the immediate post-war era Mason and others determined to resurrect it, in the face of great resistance. But Mason's influence and the battle experience of many senior officers of all specializations carried the day. In 1956 the new arrangements came into being. It was Mason's great service to the navy that he was at the centre of bringing about a general list of officers.<br>
<br>For thirty years after leaving the active list Mason devoted himself to the national, but greatly neglected, engineering aspects of manufacturing industry and to education in general. He was president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (1964) and of the Institute of Marine Engineers (1967), as well as being a member of the Institute of Plant Engineers and chairman or vice-chairman of many other professional bodies. He was a member of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (1958&#150;63), and its vice-chairman in 1962&#150;3, a member of the National Council for Technological Awards (1960&#150;64), a founder fellow of the Fellowship of Engineering (1976), a member of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, and assistant to the court of the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights. He served on the councils or governing bodies of the Further Education Staff College (1964&#150;74), Brighton Polytechnic (1969&#150;73), the Royal Naval School in Haslemere (1953&#150;83), Hurstpierpoint College (1966&#150;80), and Ipswich School (1961&#150;72), and was chairman of the steering committee of the National Engineering Laboratory (1958&#150;69) and of the Standing Conference on Schools Science and Technology (1971&#150;5). He was an active member of the council of the Navy League (1967&#150;73) and from 1967 held the life appointment of high steward of Ipswich. He was a fellow of the Fellowship of Engineering and of the Institute of Marine Engineers, an honorary fellow of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and an honorary member of the Institute of Plant Engineers.<br>
<br>Mason was good-looking and his expression was that of a man at peace with himself. Of medium build, he was always impeccably turned out, and, as he grew older, his white hair added to his aura of long and deep experience and benign but firm authority. He was a committed and practising Christian. On 23 April 1924 he married Dora Margaret (Margot) (<i>d</i>. 1993), daughter of Sydney Brand JP, who, like Mason's father, was a draper. They were a devoted couple who had one son, who became archdeacon of Tonbridge, and two daughters, one of whom was appointed OBE. While suffering from cancer of the lung, Mason died from heart failure at his home, Townfield House, 114 High Street, Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, on 29 August 1988. His body was cremated at the Sussex and Surrey crematorium at Worth, Sussex.<br>
