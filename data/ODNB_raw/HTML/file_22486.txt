<span class="headword">Pomfret,  Samuel</span>  (1650?&#150;1722), <span class="occ">Presbyterian minister</span>, whose parents' names are unknown, was born in Coventry, where he received his early education at the grammar school and then at the academy of Obadiah Grew. From there he went to Cambridge (though he has left no trace in the admission records), where at the age of nineteen, following his mother's death, he seems to have undergone a religious conversion experience. He later recalled how &#145;the days of my youth were miserably spent in vain, foolish disobedient ways, serving divers lusts and pleasures&#146;. Now finding that he could no longer comply with the customs and practices of the university, and determined on becoming a nonconformist minister, he entered the academy of Ralph Button at Islington. After completing his studies he was for a while in the mid-1670s private chaplain to Sir William Dyer, first at Tottenham, Middlesex, and then at High Easter, Essex. For a short time afterwards he served as chaplain on a merchant ship trading in the Mediterranean. On his return to England he preached with considerable success a weekly lecture at Lincoln's Inn Fields which brought him to public notice.<br>
<br>Pomfret began his regular ministry at Sandwich, Kent, about 1677. There were apparently two nonconformist congregations in the town and Pomfret only accepted the invitation from one of them to become their minister &#145;on condition of their laying aside all differences&#146;  (Timpson, 400). He continued as minister there for seven years and became noted for his &#145;fervent zeal and indefatigable diligence&#146;  (Reynolds, 61). However, under the persecution of dissenters in the last years of Charles II's reign Pomfret &#145;was at last taken and imprisoned in Dover Castle, but escaped from thence at night, out of a window and made off to Canterbury and hence to London&#146;  (Calamy, <span class="italic">Continuation</span>, 1004). There he preached on an itinerant basis, especially in Hackney, Bethnal Green, Wapping, and Nine Elms.<br>
<br>It was probably only with the <span class="roman">Toleration Act</span> of 1689 that Pomfret again commenced a settled ministry at a meeting-house in Winchester Street, where he attracted so many listeners that the floor collapsed and a new meeting-house, capable of accommodating 1500 people, was erected in Gravel Lane, Houndsditch. There he acquired a reputation as a &#145;lively and awakening preacher&#146;, who it was later claimed had attracted a larger number of communicants than any other minister in London  (Wilson, 1.397). Not only a popular preacher, he was also noted for his piety, disregard for material possessions, and generosity to the poor. In his religious beliefs he scarcely deviated from orthodox Calvinism. He was a subscriber at the Salters' Hall debate in 1719, but no bigot. In the last two years of his ministry at Gravel Lane he had the assistance of William Hocker.<br>
<br>Pomfret was not a prolific writer and is credited with only three publications: two single sermons and <span class="italic">A Directory of Youth</span>, which was published posthumously in 1722. His declining years were spent in much pain from gout, asthma, and a gallstone. He died on 11 January 1722 and was buried in Bunhill Fields six days later. His funeral sermon was preached by Thomas Reynolds.<br>
