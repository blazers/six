<span class="headword">Douglas, Sir  James</span>  (1803&#150;1877), <span class="occ">governor in Canada</span>, was born on either 5 June or 15 August 1803 in Demerara, British Guiana, the second of three children and the younger son of John Douglas, a merchant, of Glasgow, and an unknown, probably coloured, woman whom he never married, whose surname may have been Ritchie. After a childhood in Lanark, Scotland, where he attended preparatory school, Douglas went to Canada in 1819, employed by a firm soon absorbed by the Hudson's Bay Company. A hot-tempered individual, he early on fought a duel and beat to death a Native American accused of murder. In 1828 he married, &#145;according to the custom of the country&#146;, Amelia, the half Native American daughter of William Connolly, chief factor at Stuart Lake, a marriage which was religiously regularized in 1836. They had thirteen children, of whom one boy and five girls lived to maturity.<br>
<br>After being transferred to Fort Vancouver as an accountant, Douglas rapidly improved its management and was given more responsibilities, including negotiating with the Russians to the north and the Mexicans in California. Having founded Fort Victoria in 1843, he was sent there as chief factor in 1849. Two years later he was appointed governor of Vancouver Island. Despite opposition to the duality of his role and criticism of his creating a judgeship for his brother-in-law, Douglas presided over the steady growth of both company and colony. During the gold rush of 1858 he moved boldly to close Fraser River to non-company trade, organized the policing of claims, assumed authority over the mainland, and sternly maintained law and order in the face of social upheaval. His effectiveness was admired as his arrogance and conflict of interest were deplored, and he was made governor of the new colony, formed when Vancouver Island was incorporated with British Columbia, on condition he leave the company. In 1859 he went to the brink of war with American troops over San Juan Island, despite his council's urging restraint. He seemed disappointed when the dispute was settled at higher levels. The project of a road connecting the Cariboo goldfields to the coast occupied him from 1862. He was appointed KCB when his governorship of Vancouver Island ended in 1863, and he retired from his British Columbia post in the following year, citing the state of his health as the cause.<br>
<br>A physically vigorous, tall, and muscular man of dark complexion, moderate in personal habits, industrious but volatile, Douglas spoke fluent French and several Native American dialects. Stiff and cold in personal relations, he was pompous and excessively attached to the trappings of power. He died in Victoria, British Columbia, on 2 August 1877.<br>
