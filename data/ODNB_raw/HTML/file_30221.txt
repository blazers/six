<span class="headword">Yolland,  William</span>  (1810&#150;1885), <span class="occ">army officer and railway inspector</span>, youngest surviving son of John Yolland, agent to the first earl of Morley, and his wife, Priscilla, was born at Merryfield, Plympton St Mary, Devon, on 17 March 1810. Educated at Trueman's mathematical school at Exeter, and by a Mr George Harvey of Plymouth, he passed through the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, and received a commission as second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 12 April 1828. His further commissions were dated: lieutenant, 4 September 1833; second captain, 19 December 1843; first captain, 1 March 1847; brevet major, 20 June 1854; lieutenant-colonel, 13 January 1855; brevet colonel, 13 January 1858.<br>
<br>After the usual course of professional instruction at Chatham and a short service at Woolwich, Yolland embarked for Canada on 2 August 1831, returning to England in October 1835. He then served at various home stations until his appointment to the Ordnance Survey in May 1838. For the next fifteen years he was employed at the Tower of London, Southampton, Dublin, and Enniskillen, superintending the publication of astronomical observations for the Board of Ordnance and on active survey work, including taking observations from the top of the cross of St Paul's Cathedral. He was also responsible for most of the 6 inch maps of Lancashire and Yorkshire then in course of publication. When the map-room of the Ordnance Survey office in the Tower of London was burnt down in 1841, Yolland moved with the headquarters to Southampton, where he was executive officer and did much valuable work under General Thomas Frederick Colby. He was an associate juror of the Great Exhibition of 1851, class eight. On his leaving Southampton for Ireland in November 1852 the mayor and corporation presented Yolland with an address in acknowledgement of the interest he had taken in the welfare of the town. His pamphlet on geodesy (1852) was used in teaching at Woolwich, and he published several works on surveying.<br>
<br>In July 1854 Yolland was appointed an inspector of railways under the Board of Trade. In January 1856 he was, in addition, a member of the commission appointed to consider the training of candidates for the scientific corps of the army in view of the abolition of patronage and the substitution of open competition. With his colleagues William Charles Lake and Lieutenant-Colonel William James Smythe of the Royal Artillery, he visited the principal continental countries to examine various possible systems. Yolland strongly advocated the continuance of the system of educating the candidates for the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers together at Woolwich, while Smythe preferred that the education should be separate and distinct. Lake agreed with Yolland, and the combined system was recommended.<br>
<br>In 1862 Yolland was a juror of the International Exhibition in London. He retired from the military service on 2 October 1863, retaining his appointment at the Board of Trade. In 1874 he held for a few months the position of superintending engineer of the Ramsgate harbour works. On the retirement in 1877 of Sir Henry Tyler, Yolland became chief inspector of railways, holding the post until his death. It was due to him that the Metropolitan Railway was required to submerge its line between Bishop's Road and Westbourne Park stations under the Great Western main lines near Royal Oak station, instead of crossing them on the level, as they had done for some years. This was a great improvement as regards both safety and convenience, though it was strongly opposed by the Metropolitan Railway Company.<br>
<br>In 1880 Yolland was appointed a member of the commission which inquired into the Tay Bridge disaster of 28 December 1879, and settled the question of the amount of wind pressure which railway structures should be able to withstand. His colleagues were William Henry Barlow, president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and Henry Cadogan Rothery, wreck commissioner. In 1881 he was made a companion in the Order of the Bath, civil division, in recognition of his services as a railway commissioner.<br>
<br>Yolland was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1840, of the Royal Society in 1859, and a member of the Society of Arts in 1860. He belonged to other learned bodies at home and abroad. He was for many years a director of the London and St Katherine's Dock Company. His London residence was at 14 St Stephen's Square. Yolland married at Southampton, on 18 July 1843, Ellen Catherine (<i>d</i>. 6 Nov 1864), youngest daughter of Captain Peter Rainier RN, aide-de-camp to William IV, and grandniece of Admiral Peter Rainier; they had five daughters and a son, William, major in the Royal Engineers. Yolland died at Baddesley vicarage, Atherstone, Warwickshire, where he was temporarily residing, on 5 September 1885, and was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 8 September.<br>
