<span class="headword">Heydon, Sir  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1588, <em>d.</em> 1653), <span class="occ">royalist army officer and mathematician</span>, was baptized at Saxlingham, Norfolk, on 13 June 1588. He was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13166/', "Sir Christopher Heydon (1561&#150;1623)")</script> of Baconsthorpe, writer on astrology, and his first wife, Mirabel (<i>bap</i>. 1561, <i>d</i>. 1593), daughter of Sir Thomas Rivet or Ryvett of Chippenham, Cambridgeshire. By 1613 Heydon was keeper of the stores at Sandown Castle, Kent, perhaps owing his appointment to the patronage of Henry Howard, earl of Northampton, lord warden of the Cinque Ports. Heydon held the rank of captain and may have served abroad, perhaps as a gunner, for he acquired a reputation for his military ability and as a mathematician. He also attracted attention for his wit at court, especially for his exchanges with Lady Carey. About 1627 he married Mary Philips (<i>d</i>. 1658), daughter of William Philips; five of their children were alive in 1653.<br>
<br>John's elder brother Sir William Heydon was drowned in the expedition to the &Icirc;le de R&eacute; in 1627. John inherited the family estates and also succeeded Sir William as lieutenant of the ordnance, the senior executive officer and treasurer of the ordnance office, with a remuneration of 2.5 per cent of the business transacted. He took practical charge of the office, where the clerk, Francis Morrice, had virtually held control until disgraced in 1628. Problems arose from the office's structure and internal feuds among the principal officers. As lieutenant, Heydon was responsible for supplying the ship money fleets of 1635&#150;9 and the armies in the bishops' wars. He also followed his brother in being appointed a paymaster of the posts and in 1629 was made one of the commissioners for forfeited bills of exchange. He was knighted in 1629.<br>
<br>Heydon joined the king at York in July or early August 1642 and had charge of the royalist artillery during the Edgehill campaign. He served as lieutenant-general of the ordnance at Oxford throughout the first civil war, acting as the effective head of the ordnance office, responsible for supplying the Oxford army and garrisons with military <i>mat&eacute;riel</i>. Heydon drew praise from leading royalists, including Clarendon and Sir Kenelm Digby, for his dedication and military ability, and in 1645 was mentioned as a possible governor of Oxford. His house in the Minories, London, was searched in 1642, when his books were seized. Heydon's lands were confiscated in 1642&#150;3 and, following his unsuccessful application in 1646 to compound for his delinquency, he was in 1648 fined &pound;294 10<i>s</i>. His landed income was assessed at &pound;147 5<i>s</i>. per annum.<br>
<br>Heydon was created a DCL of Oxford University in December 1642. He seems to have shared his father's interest in astrology and was a friend of Elias Ashmole. Heydon died at Heston, Middlesex, on 16 October 1653 and was buried there on 19 October. In his will he mentioned outstanding suits in chancery and debts, directing that two remaining properties in Norfolk be sold. He did not name an executor and so that task was carried out by his wife, from whom he was estranged. She was buried at St Bride's, Fleet Street, on 28 November 1658.<br>
