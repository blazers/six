<span class="headword">Carr,  Jonathan Dodgson</span>  (1806&#150;1884), <span class="occ">biscuit manufacturer</span>, was born in Stricklandgate, Kendal, on 9 December 1806, the second in a family of four sons and five daughters of Jonathan Carr, a Quaker wholesale grocer and tea dealer of Yorkshire weaving stock, and his wife, Jane Dodgson, daughter of another Kendal grocer. He was apprenticed to a baker in Stockton from 1822 to 1828. Finding the commercial opportunities in his home town to be distinctly limited, in 1831 he tramped the 50 miles to the city of Carlisle, where he opened a bakery and mealman's shop. Two years later, he felt well enough established to marry Jane, daughter of Thomas and Mary Nicholson of Whitehaven. They were to have two daughters and four sons, three of whom later became partners in the family business.<br>
<br>For much of the 1830s Carr was energetically building up an integrated business which ranged from corn merchanting and flour milling to baking, biscuit manufacture, and retailing. He subsequently added a fleet of ships to transport his requirements of wheat. Biscuits soon became the leading product group and in 1841, with the help of his local MP, he was granted the royal warrant for them. In 1846 he produced 400 tons of biscuits, employing 90 staff. He installed steam-powered machines for mixing the ingredients, though the manually operated cutting machine, adapted by the Carlisle printer Hudson Scott, fell short of the continuously running biscuit machinery evolved in Reading by George Palmer. By 1860 Carr was offering seventy-two varieties of fancy biscuit. The steady expansion of the business led to three of his brothers joining the firm of Carr &amp; Co.; the youngest, John, departed in 1860 to Peek Frean &amp; Co., the London biscuit firm, to be succeeded there by his son Arthur.<br>
<br>Carr was a giant of a man, with a benevolent expression and a full white beard in his riper years. To demonstrate his strength, he once carried three sacks of flour, each weighing 280 lb (127 kg), the length of the mill and back. His treatment of the workforce was humane, the factory being clean and airy; he ensured personal cleanliness by providing a bath which was 14 feet square, with hot water from the steam engine. He had a schoolroom, library, and reading room close by, and he gave religious instruction in his house on Sunday afternoons. Annual outings took place to the Lake District, and once there was an excursion to Edinburgh; one of the Carrs attended the weekly employees' meeting, at which matters to do with conditions in the firm could be raised.<br>
<br>Although Carr never became a local councillor, he took a lively part in public affairs. As a secretary of the Carlisle Anti-Cornlaw Association, he placed in his shop window both a taxed and an untaxed (much larger) loaf. When the corn laws were repealed in 1846, he presented every inmate in Carlisle gaol with a fruit loaf, and had a silk waistcoat made, decorated with ears of corn marked &#145;FREE&#146;. He helped to promote gas and water undertakings in the city; as a founder of the Cumberland Co-operative Benefit Building Society, he spoke on housing conditions at its meetings, and he actively supported the Cumberland Infirmary. He took the initiative in developing the docks and railway in Silloth, whither the firm later transferred its flour milling operations.<br>
<br>As a businessman Carr showed abundant energy and vision, and a rigid adherence to the Quaker principles of offering good-quality products at fair and fixed prices. However, his strong-minded individualism caused some friction in the Quaker community. Having become used to taking his <span class="roman">Bible</span> into meeting, he was censured on the grounds that reading any book during meeting weakened worshippers' dependence on the promptings of the Holy Spirit. After his two eldest sons were disowned, he and his wife resigned from the society, and soon afterwards they joined the Brethren Assembly in Carlisle and became prominent members. Carr died at his home, Coldale Hall in Carlisle, on 6 April 1884.<br>
