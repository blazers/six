<span class="headword">Atkinson,  Thomas Witlam</span>  (1799&#150;1861), <span class="occ">architect and artist</span>, was born on 6 March 1799 at Cawthorne, Yorkshire, the son of William Atkinson, head mason to the Spencer-Stanhope family of Cannon Hall, near Barnsley, and his wife, Martha, housemaid to the same family. He began work as a labourer under his father, then, having been orphaned in his youth, became a bricklayer and quarryman. By the age of twenty he was a stonecarver, and executed sculpture on St George's Church, Barnsley, and a church in Ashton under Lyne, where he was also briefly employed as a teacher of drawing. He then turned to architecture, and became clerk of the works for George Basevi's Greek revivalist church of St Thomas in Stockport, Cheshire, in the mid-1820s and subsequently at St George's Church, Ramsgate (Henry Kendall, 1825&#150;7). He married, in Halifax, on 1 April 1819, Rebecca (or Rebekah), <i>n&eacute;e</i> Mercer (1794/5&#150;1872), with whom he had a son, John William Atkinson (1822/3&#150;1846), who became a marine artist.<br>
<br>In 1827 Atkinson set up in architectural practice at 8 Upper Stamford Street, Blackfriars, London, with Charles Atkinson (possibly his brother) as partner. Having immersed himself in the study of Gothic architecture, particularly that of Lincolnshire churches, from the early 1820s, in 1829 he published a folio volume entitled <span class="italic">Gothic Ornaments Selected from the Different Cathedrals and Churches in England</span> with forty-eight lithographic plates by himself and Charles Atkinson. One of his first works, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830, was a Gothic altar-tomb for Walter Spencer-Stanhope at All Saints' Church, Cawthorne. With Atkinson he rebuilt Bowers Gifford Church, Essex (1829&#150;30), and designed St George's Church, Hyde, Cheshire (1831&#150;2). Another Gothic-style work from this period was the church of St Nicholas at Lower Tooting (1831&#150;3). His domestic commissions included a terraced crescent at Beulah Spa, Norwood, Surrey (1836), and Italianate villas for Cheadle, Cheshire (1841). Most of these were carried out after he had moved his practice to Manchester in the mid-1830s, a move which followed his commissions for Hough Hill Priory, Stalybridge, Cheshire (1832), for David Cheetham, and the Gothic-style Manchester and Liverpool District Bank buildings in Hanley, Staffordshire (1833; dem. 1881), and in Spring Gardens, Manchester (1834; dem.). The astylar Italianate design of the latter signified an important new direction in the architectural history of the city. While in Manchester he designed numerous houses and villas for its suburbs, including Ashton, Stalybridge, and Stockport. He engaged John Gregan as his assistant, and had Frank Bellhouse and Edward Hall as his pupils. He also created his principal architectural work: St Luke's Church, Cheetham Hill, Manchester (1836&#150;9; dem., except tower, <i>c</i>.1980), built in a highly accomplished perpendicular Gothic style. In addition, he designed St Barnabas's Church, Openshaw, Lancashire (1838&#150;40).<br>
<br>By 1842 Atkinson had returned to London and in that year he exhibited drawings at the Royal Academy of Duncan McLeod's Palladianist nawab palace, Murshidabad, Bengal (1829&#150;37). After fire devastated Hamburg in 1842 he went there, and entered unsuccessfully the competition for St Nicholas's Church (1844). Inspired by Alexander von Humboldt's accounts of Siberia, Atkinson then moved to St Petersburg, after a short stay in Berlin. There, in 1846, he abandoned architecture as a profession for the pursuits of an explorer and topographical artist. Between March and November 1847 he travelled to the Urals, the Kirgiz steppes, and Altai Mountains. He then returned to Moscow and on 18 February 1848 <span class="smallcap">OS</span> married <a href="#cosubject_65784">Lucy Sherrard Finley [<i>see below</i>]</a>, a governess, with whom he had a son, Alatau Tamchiboulac (<i>b</i>. 4 Nov 1848). The register of marriages at the British chapel in Moscow recorded his status as widower; the existence of his previous wife did not come to light until after his death. Between 1848 and 1853 he travelled extensively in the Russian orient, gathering much geographical and geological information. During this time he produced over 500 watercolours of the landscapes and peoples, some of them 5 or 6 feet square. He wintered in Irkutsk and Barnaul.<br>
<br>After his return to Britain, an exhibition of Atkinson's Siberian and Chinese Tartar scenes was held in 1856 at Colnaghi's Gallery, London. Some of these were lithographed and published in his narratives of his travels: <span class="italic">Oriental and western Siberia: a narrative of seven years' explorations and adventures in Siberia, Mongolia, the Kirghis steppes, Chinese Tartary, and part of central Asia. With a map and numerous illustrations</span> (1858); and <span class="italic">Travels in the regions of the upper and lower Amoor and the Russian acquisitions on the confines of India and China</span> (1860). The latter work was highly praised by <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> on its publication, but its authenticity was subsequently questioned. Doubts were raised whether Atkinson had personally travelled on the Amur, and the book was shown  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 9 Sept 1899) to be at least in part a plagiarism of Richard Maak's work <span class="italic">Journey to the Amur (Puteshestvia na Amur)</span>, published in St Petersburg in 1859. Meanwhile, in 1858 Atkinson read a paper before the British Association &#145;On the volcanoes of central Asia&#146;. In the same year he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and in 1859 a fellow of the Geological Society. To the <span class="italic">Proceedings</span> of the former body he contributed in 1859 a paper on &#145;A journey through some of the highest passes in the Ala-tu and Ac-tu mountains in Chinese Tartary&#146;, and in the <span class="italic">Journal of the Geological Society</span> in 1860 he wrote &#145;On some bronze relics found in an auriferous sand in Siberia&#146;.<br>
<br>Atkinson in person was the type of an artistic traveller, thin, lithe, and sinewy, &#145;with a wrist like a rock and an eye like a poet's; manner singularly gentle, and air which mingled entreaty with command&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, 254). Returning as an &#145;honoured guest&#146; to Cannon Hall in 1860 he met an acquaintance from his youth:<blockquote>Clapping his old comrade heartily on the back this friend &hellip; hailed Atkinson with the approving, if somewhat tactless comment, &#145;And soa, lad, you've cum back to lay yor ould bones amoong ous!&#146; Atkinson &hellip; failed to appreciate the familiarity of this typical Yorkshire welcome, and did not again honour Cawthorne with his presence. (Stirling, 96&#150;7)</blockquote>After a year of failing health and a fall in early summer, 1861, he died at Lower Walmer, Kent, on 13 August 1861.<br>

<a name="cosubject_65784"></a><span class="headword">Lucy Sherrard Atkinson</span> <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Lucy  Sherrard Finley]</span>  (1817&#150;1893), <span class="occ">traveller and writer</span>, was born at Sunderland, co. Durham, on 15 April 1817, the fourth child and eldest daughter among the ten children of Matthew Finley (<i>d</i>. 1847) and his wife, Mary Ann, daughter of William York, perfumer. It was a large, impecunious family and at the end of the 1830s she went to Russia, where she lived for eight years in St Petersburg as governess to the daughter of a General Muravyov. In 1846 she met Thomas Atkinson, whom she married in 1848. Between 1848 and 1853 she accompanied her husband on his travels through Siberia, south to the Kirgiz steppes and eastwards as far as Irkutsk and the Chinese border before they returned to Britain in 1854. In his memoirs Sir Francis Galton records that they were much visited by the Russian nobility at their cottage in Old Brompton Road  (Galton, 176&#150;7). After her husband's death in 1861 Lucy Atkinson, on applying to the Treasury for moneys owed to her husband, was informed that she was not legally Atkinson's wife as the woman he had married before he went to Russia was still living in Britain. No news of him had reached the claimant, Rebekah Atkinson, living as a lodger at 5 Beaufort Street, Chelsea, who held a different social position, until informed by a friend of her husband's death. In 1863 Lucy Atkinson, or &#145;Mrs Atkinson&#146; as her friends continued to call her, published <span class="italic">Recollections of the Tartar Steppes and their Inhabitants</span> (repr. 1972), and that year was granted a civil-list pension of &pound;100.<br>
<br>This vivid account, which is arranged as a series of letters to a friend, shows Lucy Atkinson to have been an indefatigable horsewoman who was held in respect by local people both for her equestrian skills and as a markswoman with pistol and rifle. Her reference to the birth of her son Alatau (named after a nearby mountain and spring), in the absence of a medical attendant, offers a further indication of her unusually independent capabilities. While of intrinsic interest, her book has recently been used to support criticisms of inauthenticity raised against her husband's second volume by revealing inaccuracies in the chronology and detail. In her descriptions of meetings with survivors of the 1825 Decembrist uprising then scattered through Siberia, including M. I. Murav'ev-Apostol, I. D. Yakushkin, P. I. Falenberg, the Volkonsky and Trubetskoy families, the Borisov brothers, and the Betsuzhevs (which her husband could not include owing to the dedication of his second volume to Tsar Alexander II), Lucy Atkinson's work is of interest and importance to historians of the period. During the years she spent in the home of General Muravyov, Lucy Atkinson knew personally several of the family and friends of the Decembrists in St Petersburg and Moscow. At the end of her book she wrote &#145;I now look back on all those scenes, and repeat what we have often said, that willingly would we face ten times more toil and difficulty rather than go down to mother earth without having beheld them&#146;  (L. Atkinson, 350&#150;51). After the publication of her book Lucy Atkinson returned to Russia. She came back to London, where she lived in Camden Road, Holloway. She died of acute bronchitis at 45 Mecklenburgh Square, London, on 13 November 1893. Her son, Alatau Tamchiboulac Atkinson (1848&#150;1906), became a distinguished school principal in Hawaii, where he was prominent in public affairs.<br>
