<span class="headword">Sihtric C&aacute;ech</span> <span class="st"> [Sigtryggr C&aacute;ech]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 927), <span class="occ">king of York</span>, was a grandson of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49261/', "&#205;varr the Boneless")</script>, probably the son of the Sihtric who ruled in Dublin from 888 until his death in 896, and probably also brother of his predecessor as king at York, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49264/', "Ragnall")</script>. The annals of Ulster describe Sihtric C&aacute;ech (whose epithet means &#145;the Squinty&#146;) as &#145;king of the Finngaill and the Dubhgaill&#146; (the &#145;Fair Foreigners&#146; and the &#145;Dark Foreigners&#146;, that is, the Norwegian and Danish settlers in Ireland and northern England). Most of what is known about Sihtric comes from English and Irish annals, but their ambiguity is such that reconstruction of his career is very difficult and many uncertainties remain.<br>
<br>It seems that, together with other grandsons of &Iacute;varr, Sihtric was expelled from Ireland in 902. He may have been the Sihtric active in the eastern Danelaw, who ruled as an earl in Cambridgeshire, where coins were issued at this time bearing the legend SITRIC COMES and the mint name SCELDFOR (Shelford). The possible identity of the two Sihtrics becomes less implausible when one recalls that &Iacute;varr the Boneless was one of the vikings who slew King Edmund of East Anglia. Coin evidence shows links between York and the eastern Danelaw at this period. The chronology of the two Sihtrics also dovetails. The Danes of Cambridgeshire surrendered to King Edward the Elder in 917, but the fate of their Earl Sihtric is not recorded in English sources. It seems more than a striking coincidence that in the same year Sihtric C&aacute;ech arrived with a fleet off Ireland and established himself at &#145;Cenn Fuait&#146;, presumably Glynn in the south of co. Carlow. There he was attacked unsuccessfully by the forces of the high king Ni&aacute;ll Gl&uacute;ndub. Sihtric then occupied and fortified Dublin and when Ni&aacute;ll attacked on 17 December 919 he was killed, together with twelve satellite kings, by Sihtric's forces. A year later Sihtric departed for York, where he succeeded as king his kinsman Ragnall. Sihtric signalled his arrival by a raid on Davonport in Cheshire, but there is no record of further conflict with the southern English. Instead, after King &AElig;thelstan's accession, Sihtric sent an embassy to the new king's court, which led to their meeting at Tamworth in Mercia on 30 January 926, when Sihtric accepted Christian baptism and took &AElig;thelstan's sister as his wife. Very soon afterwards he renounced her and reverted to paganism. Roger of Wendover, who names Sihtric's wife as Eadgyth, records that she retired to a nunnery at Polesworth (about 3 miles from Tamworth), where she was revered as a saint. The choice of Tamworth for the meeting-place between the two kings may indicate that Sihtric's kingdom then extended much further south than has generally been conceded. Numismatists have suggested that the coins bearing his name, SITRIC REX, were struck at Lincoln, as also were those bearing the &#145;St Martin&#146; legend; others, with the legend &#145;St Peter&#146;, were struck at York during his reign.<br>
<br>Sihtric had several children, the most famous being <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20671/', "&#211;l&#225;f Sihtricson, king of Northumbria and of Dublin")</script>. Another was Gytha, who married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/49266/', "&#211;l&#225;f Tryggvason, king of Norway")</script>. Sihtric died at York in 927, some time before the end of June. He was followed there as king by his kinsman <a name="cosubject_49273"></a><span class="headword">Guthfrith <span class="st"> [Gu&eth;r&oslash;&eth;r]</span></span>  (<em>b. </em>before 920, <em>d.</em> 934)<span class="occ"></span>, another grandson of &Iacute;varr, who had fought with Ragnall at the first battle of Corbridge and replaced Sihtric at Dublin late in 920. Guthfrith was soon driven out of York by King &AElig;thelstan, but he returned to Dublin, where he remained king until his death in 934. Irish sources have a good deal of information concerning Guthfrith's adventures there, but little is known concerning his time at York, and no coins attributable to him have survived.<br>
