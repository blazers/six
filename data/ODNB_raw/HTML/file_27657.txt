<span class="headword">Traherne,  John Montgomery</span>  (1788&#150;1860), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, born at Coedrhiglan, St George's-super-Ely, Glamorgan, on 5 October 1788, was the eldest child (of four) and only son of Llewelyn Traherne (1766&#150;1841) and his first wife, Charlotte (<i>d</i>. 1796), daughter of John Edmonds and his wife, Charlotte Dive, of St Hilary, Cowbridge, Glamorgan. The Trahernes traced descent on the female side from the Herberts of Swansea, progenitors of the earls of Pembroke and Powis, and on the male from the Treharnes of Castellau, Llantrisant, Glamorgan. Shrewd marriages had transformed the family from minor gentry to one of the major and best-connected county families by the late eighteenth century. Traherne was educated at private schools in Hammersmith (1800) and Lodiers, near Bridport, Dorset (1801&#150;06), where he first acquired a taste for antiquities. He matriculated from Oriel College, Oxford, on 11 December 1806, proceeding BA in 1810 and MA in 1813. He was ordained deacon in 1811 and priest in 1812, but he served for only six months at St Hilary before ill health forced his resignation. On 21 March 1844 he was installed chancellor of the diocese of Llandaff, his only ecclesiastical office and an appointment which he retained until 1851.<br>
<br>At Oxford, showing no aptitude for classics or mathematics, Traherne was advised to follow lectures in botany, chemistry, and anatomy. He published some scientific work anonymously and pseudonymously and he was elected fellow of the Linnean Society on 21 December 1813, of the Geological Society in 1817, and of the Royal Society on 29 May 1823. He became one of the chief authorities of his time on the genealogies, history, and archaeology of Glamorgan. In 1822 he published <span class="italic">Lists of the Knights of the Shire for Glamorgan and of Members for the Boroughs</span> and <span class="italic">Abstract of Pamphlets Relative to Cardiff Castle in the Reign of Charles I</span>. In 1840 he edited <span class="italic">Historical notices of Sir Matthew Cradock, knt., of Swansea, in the reigns of Henry VII and Henry VIII</span> and also <span class="italic">Stradling correspondence: a series of letters written in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, with notices of the family of Stradling of St Donat's Castle</span>. The bulk of the letters in this collection were addressed to Sir Edward Stradling (1529&#150;1609), an Elizabethan scholar and literary patron. Traherne was an active member of the Cambrian Archaeological Association, contributing notes and papers to <span class="italic">Archaeologia Cambrensis</span>, and he was a corresponding member of the Welsh Manuscript Society. Among his acquaintances and correspondents were a number of leading literary and scientific figures as well as most contemporary Welsh scholars, and his assistance was frequently acknowledged by other workers in the same field. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 15 February 1838, and he was also an honorary member of the Society of Antiquaries, Newcastle upon Tyne, and of the Society of Antiquaries, Copenhagen. He also played a part in local cultural life, acting as a trustee of the Cowbridge lending library and of the town hall building committee, and as a governor of Howell's School, Llandaff.<br>
<br>Traherne married, on 23 April 1830, Charlotte Louisa (<i>d</i>. 1880), third daughter of Thomas Mansel Talbot of Margam, who was an antiquary and artist in her own right. They had no children. He died on 6 February 1860 at Coedrhiglan, where he had resided most of his life, and which he rebuilt in 1820&#150;23 after taking down the older house of 1767; but he spent the last months of his life at St Hilary, near Cowbridge, Glamorgan, and it was here that he was buried. Traherne's collections of manuscripts contain a great deal of late medieval poetry relating to Glamorgan, histories, records, and genealogies of the county, the papers of the eighteenth-century lexicographer John Walters, numerous transcripts, and his correspondence. A manuscript autobiography to <i>c</i>.1830 is in private hands. A few manuscripts passed on his death to his friend Sir Thomas Phillipps, and are at the central library in Cardiff, but the greater part of the collections, including the papers of William Davies (1756&#150;1823) of Cringell, purchased by Traherne but presented by him to the Neath Philosophical Society Library in 1844, are at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth.<br>
