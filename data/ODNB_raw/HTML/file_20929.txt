<span class="headword">Osulf <span class="st"> [Oswulf]</span></span>, earl of Bamburgh  (<em>d.</em> 1067), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, was the son of Eadulf, earl of Bamburgh (<i>d</i>. 1041), the younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27981/', "Earl Uhtred (d. 1016)")</script>. Eadulf succeeded his brother Ealdred as earl in 1038 but was himself killed in 1041 by Earl Siward who then assumed control of the whole earldom of Northumbria from the Humber to the Tweed. In 1065 Morcar, successor to Tostig in the earldom, appointed Osulf, described as a young man, to rule that portion of his territory which lay to the north of the Tyne, thus revitalizing the comital power of the house of Bamburgh. Following the Norman conquest, Morcar was deposed and imprisoned and Tostig's former deputy, Copsi, was given Osulf's earldom. Early in February 1067 Copsi ventured north and drove Osulf into hiding while he attempted to secure his position as earl. Osulf took to the woods and mountains of the region suffering want and hunger but managing to gather together allies who had shared a similar fate. Some of his supporters were, according to William of Poitiers, disaffected members of Copsi's entourage who wanted their lord to oppose the Conqueror. Osulf's opposition to Copsi may also have been fuelled by the suspicion that Copsi may have been implicated in the deaths of Osulf's uncle Gospatric and other members and allies of the house of Bamburgh murdered at the behest of Tostig in the early 1060s. Five weeks after his appointment to the earldom, on 12 March 1067, Copsi was attacked by Osulf and his men as he feasted at the ancient comital manor of Newburn. Copsi escaped to the local church but when it was set on fire he was forced out of the burning building; as he emerged Osulf decapitated him. Osulf seems to have regained control of the earldom of Bamburgh and remained unthreatened by any other expeditions sanctioned by William the Conqueror. However, in the autumn of 1067, Osulf was run through by the spear of a bandit whom he had intercepted whether by chance or design. He was succeeded as earl by his kinsman <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/11110/', "Gospatric")</script> who purchased the office from the king.<br>
