<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Walter,  John</span>  (1776&#150;1847), <span class="occ">newspaper proprietor and politician</span>, was born at Battersea on 23 February 1776, the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28636/', "John Walter (1739?&#150;1812)")</script>, printer and founder of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and Frances Landen. He was educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, and at fourteen was apprenticed to Thomas Longman, the publisher and bookseller, and later to his father. In 1794 he matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, where he stayed for a year. In 1797 he became a master printer and assumed a half interest in his father's printing business. In 1803, on the retirement of his elder brother, William, he became sole manager of both the printing business and the two newspapers published at Printing House Square, <span class="italic">The Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Evening Mail</span>. Although he engaged in a number of civic and political activities throughout his life, his contemporaries always identified him with <span class="italic">The Times</span>. At his death in 1847 he was still directing the future course of the paper; indeed, he died at Printing House Square a few days after settling who would succeed him as editor and proprietor.<h2>
<a name="WalterandthesuccessofTheTimes"></a>Walter and the success of The Times</h2>In the spring of 1801 Walter's father gave him a one-sixteenth share in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, signalling his intention for his son's future. By the time he took over the sole direction of <span class="italic">The Times</span> in 1803, the newspaper had gone through several years in which it had made very little profit, mainly because William Walter had been both an ineffective editor and an indifferent businessman. In addition, John Walter sen. had lost money on the printing business through some poor publishing decisions and a disastrous attempt to modernize his printing processes with an experimental logographic press. Even the family's branch bookshop in Piccadilly had lost money. Walter began his new career by focusing his attention on expanding <span class="italic">The Times</span>, reasoning quite rightly that the success of the newspaper would also mean success for the print shop. His plan was simplicity itself: he would concentrate on gathering and publishing news, both foreign and domestic, and publish it before rival newspapers could. To do so, he established his own corps of foreign correspondents on the continent, whose job it was to read and translate articles of importance in the foreign press and send summaries to the London office.<br>
<br>Unfortunately, this practice brought <span class="italic">The Times</span> into conflict with the Post Office, which had years before established the foreign newspaper post to supply continental newspapers and summary translations to the London press for a fee that varied from about 60 to 100 guineas per annum. The system was open to abuse: some journals managed to obtain priority treatment by bribing postal clerks. Walter continued to pay his annual 60 guineas to the foreign post office, but dispensed with their &#145;services&#146; by having his correspondents send reports to him privately. Because he did not have to depend on the vagaries of government clerks or observe the foreign post office courtesy of allowing government officials and diplomats the first opportunity of perusing dispatches from the continent, he made few friends either among other journalists or in the government. The foreign post office's reaction was to hold up foreign mail addressed to <span class="italic">The Times</span>. In response, Walter arranged with several businesses in the City to have his mail delivered to them, since the foreign post office had no control over mail delivered to commercial houses. Walter devised a code, which he varied regularly, so that the businesses could identify the mail intended for <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Unfortunately, while this complicated plan worked well for the delivery of letters, postal officials could easily identify and confiscate foreign newspapers.<br>
<br>Walter protested regularly to friends in the government, but to no effect. When he complained to Francis Freeling, secretary to the Post Office, that some rival journals received their foreign newspapers undisturbed while his were regularly &#145;lost&#146;, Freeling replied that newspapers supporting the administration received certain favours, and that <span class="italic">The Times</span> might be similarly honoured were it to pledge a similar support. Walter refused to accept the offer, and in 1807 began to attack the Post Office generally and Freeling specifically for corruption. As a result, Walter was charged with libel and stood trial (with his father as co-defendant) on 3 July 1807. The government won the case, and father and son were required to print an apology and pay costs and a &pound;200 fine.<br>
<br>This temporary set-back did not, however, slow Walter in his attempts to gather continental news independently. As the Napoleonic wars dragged on and the blockade of the continent ended normal ship traffic, Walter, with the tacit approval of John Wilson Croker, the secretary to the Admiralty, employed blockade runners to deliver French newspapers. Walter's success in publishing news that was, in many cases, weeks ahead of even the diplomatic channels made <span class="italic">The Times</span> one of the most powerful, most profitable, and most widely read newspapers in England.<h2>
<a name="Thewarwiththetheatres"></a>The war with the theatres</h2>Walter also boosted the pre-eminence of <span class="italic">The Times</span> by establishing a professional, independent theatre review department. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, stage reviews were usually little more than puff pieces, often written by the theatre owners and playwrights themselves. Influential theatre reviewers were regularly bribed to write good reviews. Walter, taking his cue from Leigh Hunt, insisted that plays be reviewed honestly; in 1805 he hired Barron Field, a twenty-year-old friend of Hunt's, as theatre critic. Field was not allowed to accept free tickets, nor did he mix socially with theatre managers on a regular basis. His candid reviews drew the ire of the theatrical establishment; indeed, Richard Sheridan, who had been friendly with Walter's father, threatened him with a libel suit or worse after a particularly biting review. In addition to insisting on honest criticism, Walter also insisted that the theatres pay full price for inserting advertisements in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, in contravention to the common practice of requiring payment only of the stamp duty. Drury Lane at first refused to pay, and attacked Walter through newspapers heavily under the influence of the theatre interests. However, the growing power and circulation of <span class="italic">The Times</span> made it imperative that play notices be published in it, and eventually all of the theatres bowed to <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s policy.<h2>
<a name="Technologicaladvances"></a>Technological advances</h2>While he increased the circulation of <span class="italic">The Times</span> substantially in the first decade of the nineteenth century, Walter was frustrated by the slow process and significant costs of manual printing. As early as 1804 he had invested in the development of a steam press, an investment which was opposed by his father, and which eventually yielded nothing. In 1812 the German inventor Frederick Koenig demonstrated his newly designed steam press; Walter immediately contracted for two of the machines, and Koenig began to build them in a house in Whitecross Street, next to <span class="italic">The Times</span>'s offices. Walter instinctively knew that the new machines would revolutionize the newspaper industry, both by increasing exponentially the number of newspapers that could be printed and by decreasing labour costs. In anticipation of the first issue, his contract with Koenig required that the inventor not sell any of his machines to a rival newspaper for less than the price Walter was paying for them. In anticipation of the second issue, which would clearly cause labour difficulties among the printers, Walter bound Koenig and his workers to secrecy during the construction stage. And to protect himself in case the machines did not work to their specifications, Walter contracted to sell them back to Koenig if they would not print a minimum of 1100 sheets per hour. Finally, Walter contracted to buy any future machines that might print more efficiently than the ones Koenig was building for him.<br>
<br>Walter had reason to be concerned about the reaction of his pressmen. All his life he had fought the formation of &#145;combinations&#146;, or unions, in the printing business. In 1810, when his compositors struck for a wage equivalent to that being paid on other newspapers, Walter prosecuted them for combination, and nineteen were convicted and gaoled. In addition, the promise (or threat, depending on the point of view) of mechanized printing had been around for years, and pressmen all over London had vowed to smash any machines that might take their jobs from them. Finally, on 28 November 1814, Walter personally supervised the printing of the next day's edition of <span class="italic">The Times</span> on the new presses, then announced to the pressmen waiting for copy that the newspaper had already been printed. He did show his humanity on that occasion, however, by announcing that he would continue the wages of his suddenly redundant compositors until they could find suitable work elsewhere. Eventually, the Koenig machines were able to print 1800 sheets per hour; the new press reduced the time required to print an issue of 3000&#150;4000 copies from ten hours to three. In five years, Walter more than doubled his circulation, and revenue from sales and advertising made <span class="italic">The Times</span> the leading daily in England. Interestingly, he did not stop tinkering with printing machinery; in 1827 he contracted with Cowper and Applegarth to build a machine with four cylinders capable of printing 4000 sheets per hour.<h2>
<a name="Politicalindependence"></a>Political independence</h2>From the day in 1803 that he assumed editorial control of <span class="italic">The Times</span>, Walter reserved the right to offer criticism as well as support to the sitting government. His policy toward the administration was something like his policy toward the theatres: if he accepted nothing from them, he owed them nothing. In a leader published on 10 February 1810 he explained that he strove to conduct the paper with an &#145;independent spirit&#146; that could support &#145;the men in power, but without suffering them to repay [<span class="italic">The Times</span>'s] partiality by contributions calculated to produce any reduction whatsoever in the expense of managing the concern&#146;. He went on to say that the<blockquote>[Addington] Administration, therefore, had, as he before states, his disinterested support, because he believed it then, as he believes it now, to have been a virtuous, and an upright Administration; but not knowing how long it might continue so, he did not chuse to surrender his right of free-judgment, by accepting of obligations, though offered in the most unexceptionable manner.</blockquote>That independence was bound to lead to trouble at a time when most newspapers were allied to a political faction. In 1804 Walter allowed <span class="italic">The Times</span> to take sides against Pitt in a cabinet squabble. In retaliation, the secretary of the Custom House informed Walter on 26 April 1805 that he was cancelling a lucrative Custom House printing contract with the family firm. Walter sen. was furious with his son, but nothing could be done until Pitt lost power. In February 1806, with a new coalition government in place, Walter asked to resume the Custom House contract. Even though he supported the new government editorially, his request went unanswered. When it was suggested to him that he make a formal petition for reinstatement, he refused on the grounds that such a move might encourage some in the government to believe that, by granting him a favour, they might have influence over him. When his friends presented a petition on his behalf, he refused to support it, causing the rift with his father to widen.<br>
<br>Walter's political independence did not, of course, protect him from charges of corruption. Twice he was accused of being in the pay of the French, once for supposedly accepting payments for inserting letters in support of the French monarchy but written by the French secret police, and another time for taking a large bribe from the duc de Blacas, again for supporting the Bourbons. The first charge was rather vague, and had been made against a number of the leading London journals; in some cases, it may have been true, although it was never proven. The second charge was decidedly untrue, and led to some spectacular developments. Barry O'Meara, a surgeon and former British soldier, had served for a brief time as medical adviser to Napoleon. In 1822 he published his reminiscences, <span class="italic">Napoleon in Exile, or, A Voice from St. Helena</span>, in which he charged that in 1816 Blacas had paid Walter &pound;3000 for editorial influence on behalf of the Bourbons. A <span class="italic">Times</span> leader called the charge a lie, and O'Meara determined to horsewhip Walter publicly. He waited outside the Stratford Club, and when the man he was told was Walter emerged, O'Meara began thrashing him. The man turned out to be William, John Walter's older brother, who had O'Meara arrested for assault. The matter was finally concluded on 12 November 1822, when Walter published a letter from Blacas in which the duke stated unequivocally &#145;nothing was ever given or offered to you by my intervention&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of &#145;The Times&#146;</span>, 225). Although O'Meara continued to insist on the truth of his accusation through the rival <span class="italic">Morning Chronicle</span>, Walter appears to have been generally vindicated by Blacas's letter.<h2>
<a name="SoledirectorofTheTimes"></a>Sole director of The Times</h2>John Walter sen. died on 16 November 1812. Although he had apparently been on good terms with his son for several years, his will reflected his anger over the loss of the Custom House contract and probably the fine for libel, as well as some pettiness over his son's printing decisions. Instead of leaving his shares in the newspaper to Walter jun., he merely left him the opportunity to buy two of the shares at an inflated price, and directed that Walter Wilson's share should revert to Walter jun. at Wilson's death. On the positive side, the will required that Walter jun. be sole manager of <span class="italic">The Times</span> and be paid an annual salary of &pound;1000, with provisions for a sliding-scale reduction if profits were to slip below &pound;5000 per annum.<br>
<br>Even though the will made him a minority stockholder, the legal recognition of his position as chief proprietor gave Walter the chance to build <span class="italic">The Times</span> both as a business venture and a journalistic force. Sole control was an important issue; Walter did not get on well with his sisters and his older brother, who were all stockholders. As early as 1808 he had worried, during a serious bout of illness, that the family might interfere disastrously in the conduct of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. Apparently they felt that his independence diminished their profits. However, he soon recognized that he could not manage the printing business, the business affairs of the paper, and the routine editorial affairs involved in publishing a daily. As early as 1805 he had cast about for young talent and, in addition to hiring Field as theatre critic, he had hired John Dyer Collier to report from the court of king's bench; Collier's sons William and John Payne Collier, James Murray, and John and Charles Ross as reporters; and Henry Crabb Robinson as correspondent for the north of Europe and later as occasional editor. After his father's death he hired Peter Lovett Fraser, who acted as managing editor in Walter's absence; Edward Sterling; John Stoddart, who held the formal title of editor for three disastrous years; and Thomas Barnes, the first in a series of long-serving, influential editors, who took over from Stoddart in 1817 and served until his death in 1841. And he paid his staff well: John Dyer Collier received &pound;200 p.a. to report the court of king's bench from 1804 to 1808; John Payne Collier earned up to 210 guineas p.a. as parliamentary reporter; while his brother William Collier began as a reporter at 3 guineas a week. Walter's first formal editor, John Stoddart, received &pound;1400 annually, plus an additional &pound;100 for an insurance premium. In fact, he was known to have &#145;treated his staff so liberally, that in the days of the Regency, a position on the staff of <span class="italic">The Times</span> was regarded as one of the &#147;plums&#148; of the journalistic profession&#146;  (Bowman, <span class="italic">The Story of &#145;The Times&#146;</span>, 111). The core of that staff&#151;Crabb Robinson, Walter, Peter Fraser, and Thomas Barnes&#151;were professional colleagues and personal friends, and remained so for almost forty years.<h2>
<a name="Personallifeandparliament"></a>Personal life and parliament</h2>In 1814 Walter appointed Stoddart as editor so that he might pursue some personal interests, not least of which was a love affair with the daughter of Dr George Gregory, vicar of West Ham. Unfortunately, Miss Gregory's brothers, who were negotiating the marriage settlement on her behalf, apparently could not agree with Walter on several of the articles, and in later 1814, to Walter's distress, the marriage appeared to be off. Adding to his personal distress, he acquired a new home for his bride-to-be and himself in Brompton Row, London, and was devoting a considerable amount of time and money preparing it. Walter finally settled his issues with the Gregory family and the marriage took place on 6 May 1815; sadly, the new Mrs Walter almost immediately &#145;fell into a consumption&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of &#145;The Times&#146;</span>, 1.159) and died later in the year. Walter gave up the house in Brompton Row and returned to his old apartments at Printing House Square. He also threw himself back into the management of the newspaper, which had declined somewhat under Stoddart. Eventually, in 1817, he removed Stoddart from the editor's chair and replaced him with the more whiggish Thomas Barnes.<br>
<br>With Barnes's appointment, Walter could turn his attention to another private pursuit: the construction of a country estate. Bear Wood, near Reading, took over three years and thousands of pounds to build&#151;and thousands of pounds to maintain. Walter remarried in January 1818, and he and his new wife, Mary Smithe, daughter of Henry Smithe of Eastling, Kent, were finally settled in the new estate in 1822, where they lived off and on for the rest of his life. He enjoyed the role of country gentleman, keeping a rather large staff and entertaining lavishly. He also kept a house in town, first in Brompton Row, later at Charing Cross, and continued to lease the apartments at Printing House Square, all at considerable cost. His first son, also John Walter, was born in 1818.<br>
<br>In 1819 Walter determined to sell off most of his interest in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, although he would continue in his position as chief proprietor until his death. He apparently was motivated in part by the need for money to maintain his several homes. He had also decided on a parliamentary career, and he knew that the editor of a newspaper, even one as respectable as <span class="italic">The Times</span>, would not be an acceptable MP. By 1831 he had retired completely from all responsibilities for the newspaper, and was elected on a reforming ticket for Berkshire in 1832. It should be noted, however, that although Walter refrained from any direct management of the newspaper, he still owned a one-thirty-second share; he still owned the premises and, more importantly, the printing business at Printing House Square; and he still received rent from the newspaper for the space that it occupied at the square. In 1827, for example, his total annual income from the various pieces of the business amounted to over &pound;13,000.<br>
<br>Although Walter represented Berkshire as a whig, he continued the political independence that he had established at <span class="italic">The Times</span>. His parliamentary career was not particularly distinguished. He was not an effective public speaker, and the only cause he took leadership in was the opposition to the <span class="roman">Poor Law Bill</span> of 1834. However, his constituents appear to have felt that he was a conscientious representative, and he worked tirelessly for them, especially in projects for poor relief. Despite his independence, he worked well with his colleagues in parliament; his only enemy was Daniel O'Connell, a favourite target of <span class="italic">Times</span> leading articles. As the whig party factionalized in the 1830s, Walter broke away to join Peel's nascent Conservatives, and resigned his Berkshire constituency in 1837. He stood unsuccessfully for Southwark in 1840, and was finally returned for Nottingham as a Conservative at a by-election on 27 April 1841. He lost the seat at the general election in June the same year, but won the seat back at another by-election in August 1842, only to lose it again on petition. Still, he maintained his political independence: his Nottingham supporters comprised both Conservatives and Chartists, and he opposed Peel's poor-law policies. Walter believed that Peel was ultimately responsible for the loss of his Nottingham seat, and as a result Peel never again received support from Walter or <span class="italic">The Times</span>.<h2>
<a name="Thelastyears"></a>The last years</h2>Walter never returned to parliament. Barnes died shortly before Walter lost his Nottingham seat, and the paper once again claimed his attention. He appointed the 23-year-old J. T. Delane as editor, but took back much of the authority of managing the paper. During his last six years he took on the increasingly powerful railroad speculators, and his investigations into fraud and conspiracy resulted in the erection of commemorative tablets in his name by the lord mayor of London. He also insisted that the newspaper maintain an independent, if somewhat conservative, establishment-oriented political position.<br>
<br>Walter had hoped that his eldest son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28638/', "John Walter (1818&#150;1894)")</script>, would succeed him as sole proprietor, but young Walter showed little inclination to become involved in either the paper or the printing business. In addition, Walter was an old-line evangelical, and his son's involvement with the Oxford Tractarians very nearly caused the two to break off relations in 1845. However, they reconciled in 1846 and Walter jun. took a position at <span class="italic">The Times</span> in the business office. Later that year, Walter sen. began suffering from what later would be diagnosed as throat cancer. Feeling his mortality, and knowing how important to the future of the newspaper a clear line of succession would be, he appointed his eldest son joint manager on 5 November 1846.<br>
<br>The last six months of his life were difficult for Walter and those around him. As the cancer grew, he became understandably more temperamental toward his family and his staff. He lived at Printing House Square, which put him in the closest possible contact with the business. He insisted on actively directing the business affairs and even the editorial policies of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. He had undertaken a bitter battle with his old friend and partner William Delane, father of the current editor, over the future control of the paper. He grew querulous, and at times was completely unreasonable. Although it was clear to him and those around him that his cancer was terminal, in January 1847 he met with representatives from Reading to discuss his candidacy for parliament in the next election. However, he finally accepted the inevitability of his imminent death and announced his retirement from politics in February. The uncertainty over the future direction of the paper and J. T. Delane's part in it caused serious dissension among the staff. Finally, on 1 July John Walter jun. was appointed sole manager. On 20 July an agreement was reached between the elder Delane and Walter on the disputed proprietorship, leaving John Walter jun. in complete control of <span class="italic">The Times</span>. J. T. Delane was to continue as editor. Walter jun. would, like his father, enter parliament as member for Nottingham and assume the role of businessman, politician, head of a family, and country gentleman.<br>
<br>Walter died on 28 July 1847 in the apartments at Printing House Square. He was survived by his wife and three sons, John, to whom he left his entire interest in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, Henry, and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/36717/', "Edward Walter")</script>. He was once described by Crabb Robinson as &#145;slow at conversation, caring only for &#147;real things&#148;, a man great in reserve&#146;  (<span class="italic">History of &#145;The Times&#146;</span>, 1.80). Although he entertained on a large scale, he was said to be somewhat quiet, indeed &#145;bashful&#146;. He was an ardent fisherman and landscape gardener. &#145;He enjoyed the country. He rode well. He wrote a supremely good letter; he had a remarkably good head for figures&#146;  (ibid., 1.8). He was a loyal friend and, obviously, a sound businessman. His establishment of <span class="italic">The Times</span> as one of the most influential newspapers in the world makes him one of the genuinely remarkable men of the nineteenth century.<br>
