<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Atkinson,  James</span>  (1759&#150;1839), <span class="occ">surgeon and bibliographer</span>, the son of a medical practitioner and friend of Laurence Sterne, received his medical education as a pupil of Henry Cline of St Thomas's Hospital, London, and attended the lectures of Thomas Denman, physician-accoucheur to the Middlesex Hospital. A Roman Catholic, by 1782 he had started to practise in York and later travelled to Holland and Paris. He is remembered as the author of <span class="italic">Medical Bibliography: A. and B.</span> (1834), which is dedicated: &#145;To all idle medical students in Great Britain sit&#151;&#146;, with a picture of that part of the human spinal column known as the sacrum. Atkinson's reason for attempting the work was: &#145;Wanting better amusement, and through mere accident, I stumbled upon the dry, dusty, tedious, accursed, hateful bibliography&#146;  (p. 371). The subject undoubtedly deserves all these epithets, but Atkinson managed to write a book to which none of them can be truly applied. It is full of anecdote, humour, and out-of-the-way information. The scientific value is, however, small, the bibliography consisting of a simple list of editions arranged alphabetically under names of authors. The notes are merely excuses for Atkinson's discursive and amusing remarks on things in general. The book is usually spoken of as unfinished, as it is only devoted to letters A and B, but there is nothing to show that it was the intention of Atkinson to go any further, especially as he asked &#145;what blockhead but myself, would have chosen such a task for relaxation?&#146;  (Rolleston, 179).<br>
<br>T. F. Dibdin made Atkinson's acquaintance in York in the course of his bibliographical tour, and described him as &#145;a gentleman and a man of varied talent: ardent, active, and of the most overflowing goodness of heart &hellip; The heartiest of all the octogenarians I ever saw, he scorns a stretch and abhors a gape. &hellip; His library is suffocated with Koburgers, Frobens, the Ascensii, and the Stephens&#146;  (Dibdin, 213). On the title of his book Atkinson is described as &#145;surgeon to H.R.H. the Duke of York, senior surgeon to the York County Hospital and the York Dispensary, and late V.P. to the Yorkshire Philosophical Society&#146;. In 1810 he became one of the founders of the York Medical Library. He was also an enthusiastic member of the musical society, who played the violin and entertained Paganini on his visit to York. He collected portraits of medical writers, and proposed compiling a catalogue with memoirs. He and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1840), had a son, Henry, who became a Church of England clergyman in Leeds, and at least one daughter. For many years Atkinson was the foremost medical man in York, and remained in practice to within a few years of his death, which took place at the age of eighty, at Lendal, York, on 14 March 1839. He was buried near his father in the family vault at St Helen's Stonegate, where an inscribed monument was erected to his memory. The <span class="italic">York Herald</span> observed on 16 March 1839 of Atkinson: &#145;Ever prominent with his aid at every benevolent institution, he possessed the blessing of the poor and afflicted whilst among them, and will live in their grateful remembrance beyond the grave&#146;. The portraits attributed to him by the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> were, in fact, the work of James Atkinson (1780&#150;1852).<br>
