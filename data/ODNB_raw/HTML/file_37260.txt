<span class="headword">Cannon,  Thomas <span class="st"> [Tom]</span></span>  (1846&#150;1917), <span class="occ">jockey and racehorse trainer</span>, the elder son of Thomas H. Cannon, a Windsor livery stable keeper, and his wife, Harriett Townsend, was born on 23 April 1846 in Eton, where his father later kept the George Hotel. At the age of thirteen he was apprenticed to a Mr Sextie, who ran a small training stable in Wiltshire. His first win came the following year when, weighing only 3 st 12 lb, he piloted Lord Portsmouth's My Uncle to victory in a six-furlong heats race at Plymouth. In 1872 he became champion jockey with eighty-seven winners. He rode only one Derby winner&#151;Shotover in 1882&#151;but his thirty-two years in the saddle brought him twelve other English classics, several major French victories, and a career total of 1544 winners.<br>
<br>Cannon was one of the four outstanding professional jockeys of the second half of the nineteenth century, along with George Fordham, John Osborne, and Fred Archer. Fordham and Cannon were both attached to John Day's Danebury stables and George acted as Tom's mentor, teaching him the advantage which could be gained from steadying a horse before the final effort. To this Cannon added his own gentle touch. He rarely used his whip and was renowned for his ability to coax the best from even a highly strung two-year-old. Indeed many contemporaries regarded him as unequalled in his handling of young horses. His one fault, shared with other jockeys, was his habit of attempting to win by the narrowest possible margin in an attempt to deceive the handicapper, though his judgement was such that it cost him fewer races than most. What he did not share with other jockeys of the time&#151;Archer, Fordham, and Osborne excepted&#151;was a reputation for dishonesty: no trace of scandal tinged his career.<br>
<br>While still a professional jockey Cannon turned to training, taking over the lease of the Danebury stables at Stockbridge, Hampshire, from his father-in-law, John Day, in 1879, though he did not take actual possession until after Day's death three years later. Most of the horses which he trained he also owned, many of them in partnership with Tom Robinson of High Wycombe; the most celebrated were Reminder (third in the 1894 Derby), Curzon (second the following year), and Playfair (winner of the 1888 Grand National). His ownership, breeding, and training of horses meant that at times he had over eighty animals in his care. Nevertheless George Lampton, turf raconteur, maintained that Cannon was better at training riders than horses and certainly three leading jockeys&#151;John Watts, Sam Loates, and W. T. (Jack) Robinson&#151;served their apprenticeships at Danebury. He also passed on his riding knowledge to Arthur Coventry, an outstanding gentleman rider, as well as to his own sons. His colours last appeared on a course in 1913 but he had relinquished training well before that, when part of the Danebury training grounds passed into the hands of a lady who refused to allow racehorses on her land. Stockbridge races, at which Cannon served as clerk of the course from 1892 to 1898, had to be abandoned for the same reason.<br>
<br>Cannon was physically slight, riding as a lightweight for most of his career, but he was a graceful jockey to whom the epithet &#145;polished&#146; was often applied by contemporaries. Although he was said rarely to smile when racing, he had a sense of humour: in his later years as a trainer he often allowed early-morning visitors to mount a little hog-maned horse which he later revealed to be Duke of Palma, informing his guests that they could therefore rightfully claim to have ridden the winner of the Cambridgeshire.<br>
<br>Cannon's first marriage was to John Day's daughter Catherine (Kate). Three of their sons made a name on the racetrack: Tom junior lost by a length to his father in the 1888 Eclipse Stakes; Kempton (named after the course), in strict contrast to the upright seat of his father, was an English pioneer of the crouched, &#145;monkey-on-a-stick&#146; riding style introduced to Britain by American jockeys in the 1890s; Mornington (Morny), like both Kempton and his father, won a Derby, as well as the Hanworth Plate at Kempton Park in 1891, when his father, in his last race, finished third. Another son, Charles, also became a jockey, and a daughter, Margaret, married Ernest Piggott, a steeplechase rider; their son Keith was the father of the jockey Lester Piggott. Kate died in 1891 and Cannon later remarried but his second wife also predeceased him. His younger brother Joe was a renowned racehorse trainer.<br>
<br>Cannon suffered recurrent ill health for the last two decades of his life and after a final, long, wearying illness, in which dropsy supervened on serious heart trouble, he died on 13 July 1917 at his Grosvenor Hotel, Stockbridge, Hampshire, where he had settled after the death of his second wife. He left the bulk of his estate, valued at &pound;5306 gross, to his son Ronald Portland, whom he advised &#145;to make his will&#146;.<br>
