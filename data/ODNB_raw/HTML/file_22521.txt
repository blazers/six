<span class="headword">Poole,  Robert</span>  (1707/8&#150;1752), <span class="occ">physician and theological writer</span>, about whose childhood nothing is known, completed his initial education at the Academy of Liberal Arts and Sciences in London. Nearly everything known about him comes from his own writings, and some of his early accounts describe the years he spent under Professor John Eames FRS, a theology teacher of the dissenting academy, who was especially famous for his teaching of science. Poole also attended the lectures of Frank Nichols, professor of anatomy at Oxford, who lectured in London, and the chemistry lectures of Henry Pemberton at Gresham College, London.<br>
<br>On 2 March 1738 Poole entered himself as a physician's pupil at St Thomas's Hospital, London. First he was attached to Edward Wilmot, and then, as he became more confident of his ability to take notes, he also walked the wards of the other two physicians, Abraham Hall and Joseph Letherland. He was particularly interested in the treatment prescribed for patients, and claimed he was so busy he did not have time to eat. St Thomas's made a profound impression on Poole. Under the pseudonym Theophilus Philanthropos he published <span class="italic">A Physical Vade Mecum, or, Fifth Gift of Theophilus Philanthropos</span> (1741), a meticulous description of the hospital which listed the governors, the rules, the wards and the number of beds and fireplaces in each, all the staff and how much they were paid, and the number and methods of in-patient and outpatient admissions; the work ended with the hospital's dispensatory (only the second after Henry Banyer's <span class="italic">Pharmacopoeia</span>), a catalogue of diseases and the medicines used, and for good measure, Poole added the dispensatories of St Bartholomew's and Guy's hospitals. Everyone who has since written about the <span class="italic">Physical Vade Mecum</span> has commented on its great interest.<br>
<br>Poole was an observant and indefatigable student of physic and midwifery, a careful taker of notes, and a hard worker. He left his home in Islington on 21 May 1741 to study midwifery in Paris, and wrote a detailed account of his time abroad. He knew no French when he arrived, but rose at five each morning for an hour's study of the language before setting off for the H&ocirc;tel Dieu or La Charit&eacute; hospitals. These two institutions are described and compared in detail: the staff, the wards, the teaching, and the pupils. Poole's midwifery course of eight lectures, which included demonstrations with models, cost him &pound;1 7<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>., and he also attended one difficult home delivery. In July he travelled to Rheims, where four examiners tested him in Latin on anatomy, physiology, diseases and their cure, consumption, and surgery; at the end of the day he was granted his doctor's diploma.<br>
<br>However, more important to Poole than saving bodies was saving souls; by 1741 he had published five pamphlets to that end, under the name Theophilus Philanthropos. In these pamphlets, which he called &#145;gifts&#146;, Poole portrayed himself as vile, but he claimed that God showed love to him and that he atoned for his sins by writing. Already devout, he had a vision-like dream in which Christ called to him. The third &#145;gift&#146;, <span class="italic">The Christian Convert</span> (2nd edn, 1741) had clearly caused offence; one copy had been publicly burnt in Ann's Ward at St Thomas's Hospital on 21 April 1739, and some people wanted to destroy as many further copies as they could find in other wards. Poole wrote that he had &#145;long been the Object of their Banter and Ridicule, Laughter and Buffoonery&#146;  (Poole, <span class="italic">A Friendly Caution</span>, preface, iv). However, he did have the support of Samuel Lessingham, the hospital's treasurer. Other themes recur in Poole's writings: the evil of swearing; that parents should not force their children to marry; that love matters more than wealth; and that precious time should not be thrown away in long courtships. Some of the &#145;gifts&#146; have curious frontispieces, such as a kneeling figure with prayers from his mouth rising in strips to heaven, while hell and demons lurk below to one side. As well as upsetting his contemporaries, Poole's religious works were seen as &#145;revivalist&#146; in the nineteenth century  (Church, 231) and &#145;permeated with fanatical religiosity&#146; in the twentieth  (Berman, 791). There is no morsel of humour in any of his works&#151;religious, medical, or travel.<br>
<br>Although George Whitfield was his &#145;much esteem'd Friend&#146;  (Poole, <span class="italic">A Journey</span>, 92), Poole, a member of the Church of England, disclaimed being a Methodist. Many matters caused him upset in Paris in the summer of 1741: the casual way religion was treated by the resident Church of England clergyman, Mr Thompson; the banker's charges and the rate of exchange; the frequent processions of the host through the street; the junketings on Sundays after mass; and &#145;loose&#146; dressing by women. However, Poole did have some like-minded St Thomas's Hospital friends in Paris. Dismayed by Mr Thompson, Poole regularly attended the sermons of a noted Jesuit preacher, and his antagonism to the Catholic church became less strident.<br>
<br>Poole clearly had independent means. After returning to London he became the first physician elected to the new Middlesex Infirmary (later the Middlesex Hospital), in 1746, but he resigned in the same year. Immediately he became physician to the new Smallpox Hospital, established on 26 September 1746. He resigned two years later, when he went abroad again, this time to Gibraltar and the West Indies. By then Poole was almost certainly married, and his reason for going to the West Indies may well have been to find out if it was a suitable place to settle. The apprehensive &#145;companion of [his] life&#146;  (Poole, <span class="italic">Beneficent Bee</span>, 297) came to say goodbye to him at Greenwich. In Gibraltar he took care to visit both the sailors' and soldiers' hospitals, and found the sailors' institution much the better. In the West Indies he went first to Barbados, and then to ten other islands.<br>
<br>By this time Poole's religious fervour and his moral criticisms of swearing and scanty clothing had become more moderate. Poole explored the islands and described at length the weather&#151;so hot that men did not wear wigs and women had discarded their hoops; the cost of goods; and the geography, vegetation, and agriculture. He deplored what he considered to be some unjustifiably harsh treatment of slaves, but he did not criticize slavery as such. Of all the islands, Barbados appealed to him the most, though Tortola with its Quaker inhabitants pleased him greatly. He recounted that he was always nervous when having to introduce himself at each new place, but seems to have managed well. Poole's journal ends in Santa Cruz, where he became seriously ill, probably with malaria. He returned to Britain, where he lived until his death at the end of May or the beginning of June 1752. He was buried on 3 June in the churchyard of St Mary's, Islington, Middlesex.<br>
