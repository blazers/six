<span class="headword">Lucas,  Margaret Bright</span>  (1818&#150;1890), <span class="occ">temperance activist and suffragist</span>, was born on 14 July 1818 at Rochdale, Lancashire, the youngest daughter of Jacob Bright (1775&#150;1851), cotton mill proprietor, and his second wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wood (<i>d</i>. 1830). Several of her ten siblings, notably <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3421/', "John Bright")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3418/', "Jacob Bright")</script>, became prominent in politics and reform. Educated &#145;in the institutions of the Society of Friends&#146;, she recalled: &#145;I developed slowly for we were strictly brought up and told that &#147;children should be seen and not heard&#148;&#146;  (M. Parker). On 6 September 1839 Margaret married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17139/', "Samuel Lucas (1811&#150;1865)")</script>, a London corn exchange merchant and a fellow Quaker. The pair moved to Manchester in 1845, when Samuel took up a cotton mill partnership, but the family settled permanently in London in 1850. Margaret became politicized during the anti-cornlaw agitation, when, in 1845, she aided her husband in organizing meetings and raising money. Until her husband's death in 1865, however, her main burdens remained within the family, including the rearing of her two children, Samuel Bright Lucas, a deaf mute, and Katharine. By 1870 both children had married, Katharine to John Pennington Thomasson (later MP for Bolton).<br>
<br>Relieved from the cares of immediate family, Lucas now sought a clear plan to fit her Quaker moral purpose. Suffering from bronchial trouble, and seeking a change of climate, she went to North America to stay with a cousin, Esther Blakey, in Halifax in 1870. Lucas easily mixed in the trans-Atlantic reform network that included strong Quaker participation. Woman suffragists and temperance reformers in the north-eastern United States warmly welcomed her as &#145;John Bright's sister&#146;. She would reciprocate the hospitality when American reformers came to Britain.<br>
<br>The American visit was a turning point in Lucas's public temperance career. There she witnessed &#145;the advanced views and institutions of a less trammelled social system&#146;, influences she found &#145;congenial&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 14&#150;28). She had signed the temperance pledge at the age of sixteen, but joined the American-devised Independent Order of Good Templars in 1872, and became a grand worthy vice-templar in 1874. The Good Templars organized the British tour of &#145;Mother&#146; (Eliza) Stewart, whose social protest against saloons in the Woman's Crusade had stimulated the creation of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in 1874. Lucas and Stewart spoke at a Newcastle upon Tyne meeting in 1876 which led to the founding of the British Women's Temperance Association (BWTA). Elected BWTA president in 1878, Lucas also supported peace and anti-prostitution work, and served on the executives of the National Society for Women's Suffrage and the Ladies' National Association. Yet temperance took her chief labours, and she remained BWTA president until her death. In 1885 American WCTU leader Frances Willard selected Lucas as first World's WCTU president, in order to emphasize the organization's global commitment. As a consequence, Lucas crossed the ocean again in 1886 to attend an American WCTU convention in Minneapolis, at which she was f&ecirc;ted.<br>
<br>Lucas represented the phase of women's temperance that located the movement's power primarily in the home and in the superiority of women's moral virtues. In her fourth annual report she stated: &#145;I believe in the household women have a greater power over men, than men have over women, in inducing abstinence from intoxicating drinks&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 32). She also made, in the 1870s, more conservative assessments of the possibility of social protest than Americans did. British women would not, Lucas believed, emulate the American crusade marches. &#145;It is hardly likely we can go through the streets and kneel at the doors of the gin palaces&#146;  (<span class="italic">Crusader</span>, 51), she argued, but temperance women could in Britain hold processions and assemblies. They could also petition, and in 1879 she took the first women's petition in favour of Sunday closing to the House of Commons.<br>
<br>By 1883&#150;4 the general failure to convert men to temperance led to a more radical conclusion: &#145;The conviction grows upon me that while Petitions educate the workers and the people something more is needed to make them effectual&#146;. Had not &#145;the time come&#146;, she asked, &#145;when it becomes a duty to claim the right to vote on the side of Temperance?&#146;  (<span class="italic">Memoir</span>, 32). Nevertheless the BWTA remained only one of several women's temperance organizations, and it did not embark on its major period of expansion until after her death from tuberculosis on 4 February 1890 at her London home, 7 Charlotte Street, Bloomsbury. She was buried in Highgate cemetery.<br>
<br>Colleagues described Lucas variously as a &#145;homely British matron&#146;  (C. E. Parker, 36), and yet &#145;well-preserved, erect and vigorous&#146;  (Willard, 120), an earnest speaker, &#145;tall and stately&#146;  (M. Parker) with an impressive shock of silvery hair when in her sixties. The BWTA achieved greater heights under her successor, Lady Henry Somerset, but Lucas was an important link in the Anglo-American women's reform networks and a pioneer in British women's temperance.<br>
