<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Bond, Sir  Edward Augustus</span>  (1815&#150;1898), <span class="occ">librarian</span>, was born on 31 December 1815 at Hanwell, the son of the Revd John Bond, who conducted a large private school there, and Sophia Bond. He was admitted to Merchant Taylors' School in December 1830. In 1833 he was appointed assistant at the Record Office under the supervision of Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy and the Revd Joseph Hunter. In 1838 he was appointed assistant in the British Museum manuscripts department, where he rapidly earned the respect and affection of the keeper, Sir Frederic Madden, for his expertise and industry. He married in 1847 Caroline Frances, a relative, daughter of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/1376/', "Revd Richard Harris Barham")</script>, author of the <span class="italic">Ingoldsby Legends</span>. They had five daughters.<br>
<br>At the British Museum, Bond became indispensable as a channel for conducting the manuscripts department's business with Sir Antony Panizzi, the principal librarian, with whom Madden was not on speaking terms, and it says much for Bond's tact and integrity that he was trusted by both these imperious and exigent officers. Madden praised Bond warmly to the royal commission on the British Museum in 1848, and his good opinion even survived Bond's appointment by the trustees as Egerton librarian in 1852, nominally in charge of the Bridgewater bequest of manuscripts. The earl of Bridgewater had provided capital for a stipend of &pound;227 to be paid to the holder of this post, and in 1832 the trustees decided that it should be paid to the librarians of the manuscripts department. It was in practice paid to the keeper of manuscripts, but his salary was reduced by the same amount, a violation of the terms of the Bridgewater bequest for which the trustees were censured in the royal commission report of 1850. Their response was to separate the Egerton librarianship from the keepership of manuscripts for the first and last time, so that Madden could no longer complain that he had the office without the salary. This was a meaningless ploy, as he was still responsible for the custody of the Egerton manuscripts as head of the department, and it was a tribute to the value that Madden placed on Bond's services that their friendship outlasted what he called &#145;a pitiful and unworthy trick to take away the money from me to augment Bond's salary&#146;  (Madden, journal, 8 May 1852).<br>
<br>Bond succeeded John Holmes as assistant keeper on the latter's death in 1854. Madden delegated much routine administration to him and when he succeeded him as keeper in 1866 he was virtually running the department. He at once addressed its most pressing problem, the twelve years' arrears of cataloguing. He gave priority, however, to the creation of the class catalogue of manuscripts. Descriptions of manuscripts were cut out of published catalogues, arranged in subject order, and laid down in folio volumes; a subject index was provided, and descriptions were added when new catalogues were published. This invaluable unpublished research tool made it possible for the first time to learn what the department held on particular subjects. Catalogues of additions between 1854 and 1875, published in 1875&#150;7, cleared the cataloguing arrears, and further special catalogues were produced, notably the <span class="italic">Facsimiles of Ancient Charters</span> (1873&#150;8) and the <span class="italic">Catalogue of Spanish Manuscripts</span> (1875&#150;93). He advocated the creation of a separate department of oriental manuscripts, which was established in 1867.<br>
<br>In August 1878 to the surprise of many, including himself, Bond was appointed principal librarian upon the resignation of John Winter Jones, the post having been unexpectedly declined by the heir apparent, Sir Charles Thomas Newton. He immediately set about making the museum more welcoming and useful to the public. Almost his first act was to install electric light in the reading-room, an innovation attended with some misgiving in view of the primitive and hazardous circuitry and apparatus. It was, however, an inestimable boon for readers: the room was now open until 8 p.m. instead of having to be shut upon the failure of natural light, which often happened in the mornings when winter fogs descended. The period when the reading-room was closed for cleaning was cut from eighteen to eight days. The galleries were opened to the public every day instead of three and a half days a week, and the ban on babes in arms was ended. The public restaurant was improved. Accommodation for books was greatly increased at modest expense by the installation of sliding presses suspended from the grid-iron floors of the bookstacks, modelled on those in use at the Bethnal Green Free Library. Improved accommodation for manuscripts, newspapers, prints, and drawings was provided by the completion of the White wing to the east of the colonnade in 1884, built with the legacy of &pound;72,000 from William White, bequeathed in 1823 but subject to a life interest which did not expire until 1879. The delicate business of transferring the natural history collections to the new museum in South Kensington was successfully accomplished in 1880.<br>
<br>Bond also speedily addressed the intractable problem of the printed books catalogue, which then consisted of manuscript title slips prepared by transcribers and laid down in folio volumes. As the slips grew in number, the volumes were continually being broken down and rebound; between 1850 and 1875 their number had swollen from 150 to 2250. The situation was out of control and the expense of the endless relaying and rebinding brought repeated rebukes from the Treasury. Bond capitalized on the Treasury's alarm and in 1880 negotiated its consent to the printing of all new accession titles and the publication of the existing manuscript volumes. The <span class="italic">General Catalogue of Printed Books</span> took twenty years to complete, and with its supplement, published in 1905, it described the library as it was on the last day of the nineteenth century. The British Museum Library was the first library of its size to make its contents known to all the world through a comprehensive printed catalogue, to the inestimable benefit of literature and scholarship.<br>
<br>Bond's personal contributions to scholarship were substantial. For the Hakluyt Society he edited Giles Fletcher's <span class="italic">Of the Russe Common Wealth</span> and the Russian travels of Sir Jerome Horsley (1856). He edited the <span class="italic">Speeches &hellip; in the Trial of Warren Hastings</span> (4 vols., 1859&#150;61), and for the <span class="roman">Rolls Series</span> the <span class="italic">Chronica abbatiae de Melsa</span> (3 vols., 1866&#150;8). In 1873 he founded the Palaeographical Society with his assistant keeper, Edward Maunde Thompson, which did much to develop palaeography as a scientific discipline, and he began publication of the invaluable <span class="italic">Facsimiles of Ancient Manuscripts</span> (5 vols., 1873&#150;88). Also with Thompson, he published <span class="italic">The Utrecht Psalter</span> (1874). He was elected FSA in 1880 and retired as principal librarian in 1888. Bond's colleague Richard Garnett wrote of him that &#145;beneath a cold and reserved exterior&#146; he had &#145;a most kind heart and truly elevated mind, far above every petty consideration and delighting to dwell in a purely intellectual sphere&#146;  (Garnett, 338). He managed to remain aloof from the professional jealousies, feuds, and intrigues rife in the museum for much of his career, and he was entirely without self-importance; he was always receptive to new ideas for the improvement of the museum from whatever quarter, and having accepted them, he would immediately put them into practice. A photograph of <i>c</i>.1880 hints at his benevolent disposition: a broad, open face, generous mouth, and penetrating but kindly eyes.<br>
<br>Official recognition of Bond's great service to the museum was tardy; although he was appointed CB in 1885, he was made KCB only shortly before he died at his house, 64 Prince's Square, Bayswater, on 2 January 1898. His wife survived him.<br>
