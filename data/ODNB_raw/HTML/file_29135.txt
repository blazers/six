</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Weston,  Thomas</span>  (1737&#150;1776), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was the son of Thomas Weston, a cook to the court of George II. He obtained a position as turn-broach under his father but was dismissed for misbehaviour and sent to sea instead as a midshipman aboard the <i>Warspite</i>. Life in the navy proved to be distasteful to him, though, and at the first opportunity he managed to get himself discharged and joined a group of strolling players near London. It is believed that about 1759 he was performing at Bartholomew fair in a booth owned by Shuter and Yates. He made his first appearance on a London stage on 28 September 1759, playing Sir Francis Gripe in Susannah Centlivre's <span class="italic">The Busy Body</span> at the Haymarket. Shortly after this he married a milliner named Martha, whom he encouraged onto the stage. They parted by mutual consent two years later but were reunited in the 1770s. The marriage produced no children.<br>
<br>Weston was not billed again in London until 28 June 1760, when he appeared at the Haymarket once more as Dick in Samuel Foote's <span class="italic">The Minor</span>, and in the interim he is likely to have returned to playing the provinces. By the winter he was at Henry Mossop's Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin, where he appeared for the first time on 17 November 1760. In the summer of 1761 he was engaged by Arthur Murphy and Foote, who had rented the Drury Lane Theatre for twenty-three performances. Here he played Dick once more, and took on new roles such as Brush in Murphy's <span class="italic">All in the Wrong</span> (on 15 June), Dapper in Murphy's <span class="italic">The Citizen</span> (2 July), and the Doctor in Thomas Bentley's <span class="italic">The Wishes</span> (27 July). Playing every night over the summer, he caught the attention of David Garrick, who offered him a contract at Drury Lane for the coming season. Here he added to his repertory Jeremy in William Congreve's <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>, Butler in Joseph Addison's <span class="italic">The Drummer</span>, Charino in Colley Cibber's <span class="italic">Love Makes a Man</span>, and Shallow in <span class="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</span>. He also played Polonius to Garrick's Hamlet there on 14 October 1761. For the summer of 1762 he returned to the Haymarket to take on the roles of Papillon in Foote's <span class="italic">The Lyar</span> and Mr Honeycombe in George Colman's <span class="italic">Polly Honeycombe</span>.<br>
<br>Weston's name is absent from playbills for the 1762&#150;3 season, and he was probably once more playing in the provinces. He joined Foote again at the Haymarket for the summer season in 1763 to take on the part of the henpecked husband Jerry Sneak in <span class="italic">The Mayor of Garratt</span>, a role written for him by Foote and in which he enjoyed great success. It was also at this time that he first played Scrub in George Farquhar's <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>, a part which became his most memorable. By now he had earned himself a respectable reputation as an actor, and he was able to consolidate this during the 1763&#150;4 season at Drury Lane with strong performances as Foresight in <span class="italic">Love for Love</span>, Sharp in Garrick's <span class="italic">The Lying Valet</span>, and Abel Drugger in Ben Jonson's <span class="italic">The Alchemist</span>. He then disappeared from all playbills for two years, perhaps as a result of a need to dodge creditors, and resurfaced in June 1766 once more at the Haymarket, playing three roles in <span class="italic">The Minor</span>. He joined his wife at the King's Theatre in August and then returned to Drury Lane as the Sexton in <span class="italic">Much Ado about Nothing</span> on 23 October.<br>
<br>Between 1766 and 1769 Weston does not seem to have been cast quite so frequently and added relatively few characters to his portfolio. The parts he did take on were not always as significant as he might have wished, and this may have been due, to some degree, to the rivalry for attention he must have had to tolerate from the great comic actor Ned Shuter at both Drury Lane and the Haymarket. During this period Weston adopted the roles of Gripe in Thomas Otway's <span class="italic">The Cheats of Scapin</span>, Roderigo in <span class="italic">Othello</span> (both in the summer of 1767), and Dr Last in Foote's comedy <span class="italic">The Devil upon Two Sticks</span> (30 May 1768). Some of the Haymarket company, Weston included, transferred to a new Edinburgh theatre for the winter season 1770&#150;71. Here he added Paris in Colman's <span class="italic">The Jealous Wife</span>, Sir Harry Sycamore in Isaac Bickerstaff's <span class="italic">The Maid of the Mill</span>, and Tom in Richard Steele's <span class="italic">The Funeral</span> to his repertory. After a brief stint in York he returned to the Haymarket on 5 May 1771 for a heavy summer's schedule of more than sixty performances. He then alternated between Drury Lane and the Haymarket until his death in January 1776.<br>
<br>There is uncertainty surrounding the precise date of Weston's demise. It was first announced in the <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> of 3 January 1776 that he had died on 31 December 1775, but the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> of 13 January assigned his death to 12 January, at Newington Butts, London. The <span class="italic">Public Advertiser</span> of 16 January then agreed with the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span>. The funeral probably at St James's, Clerkenwell, however, did not take place until 21 January, suggesting an even later date for the death. The cause of death, though, is not disputed and is put down to Weston's excessive drinking.<br>
<br>Drunkenness and illness marked his last years, and his death did not come unexpectedly. In a letter to his brother dated 7 November, Garrick stated that it was clear that &#145;Weston is dying, &amp; with him goes a good Actor, &amp; a very bad Man&#146;  (<span class="italic">Letters</span>, 3.1046). By December it became clear to Weston that he was unlikely to climb onto the stage again, and though he made plans to spend time at the spa in Bath he was never to make the journey.<br>
<br>A mock will, credited to Weston, the contents of which were as acrimonious as they were witty, was circulated shortly after his death and published in the third volume of <span class="italic">Dramatic Table Talk</span>. In it Weston was purported to have left Garrick all his money, &#145;as there is nothing on earth he is so very fond of&#146;; to Foote he bequeathed his consequence, to Reddish a grain of honesty, to Brereton a small portion of modesty, and to Jacobs his shoes &#145;for which he has long waited&#146;  (Holcroft, 2.122&#150;3). This will was refuted by Martha Weston and Richard Hughes in the <span class="italic">Morning Post</span> of 12 February 1776, where the contents of the genuine will were also printed.<br>
<br>As an actor Weston was an accomplished comedian and excelled in the parts of fools and clowns. Among his contemporaries, only Ned Shuter (who had been bequeathed Weston's example in the mock will) offered him any significant rivalry. Thomas Holcroft, in his <span class="italic">Theatrical Recorder</span>, recalled his ability to assume a character completely and to perform &#145;with such a consistent and peculiar humour, it was so entirely distinct from anything we call acting, and so perfect a resemblance of the person whom the pencil of the poet had depicted&#146;  (Holcroft, 2.120). It was this skill that caused Davies to couple Weston with Benjamin Johnson as the only men who became &#145;so truly absorbed in character, that they never lost sight of it&#146;  (Davies, 2.106). He also placed his interpretation of Abel Drugger on a par with Garrick's who, though he himself excelled in the role, declared that Weston's work was one of the greatest pieces of comic acting he had ever witnessed. When the two men played opposite one another in <span class="italic">The Beaux' Stratagem</span>, Garrick, as Archer, could hardly keep a straight face against Weston as Scrub. Weston's friend Francis Gentleman held his acting in great esteem and, in his <span class="italic">Dramatic Censor</span> (1770), praised his work in a number of roles.<br>
