<span class="headword">Brooke <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Newton]</span>,  Frances</span>, Lady Cobham  (<em>b. </em>after 1530, <em>d.</em> 1592), <span class="occ">courtier</span>, was the daughter of Sir John Newton (<i>d</i>. 1568) of Hanham, Gloucestershire, and his first wife, Margaret, daughter of Sir Anthony Poyntz. She was appointed a chamberer of the privy chamber in the initial warrant of 3 January 1559, but how her connection with Elizabeth I was formed is unknown, unless it was through her cousin Anne Poyntz, who was a member of Elizabeth's household in the 1550s. On 25 February 1560 Frances married the recently widowed <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/61735/', "William Brooke, tenth Baron Cobham (1527&#150;1597)")</script>. She, her husband, her sister Joanna, and her six children feature in one of the best-known Elizabethan group portraits, <span class="italic">The Cobham Family</span> (1567), now at Longleat House. A later version adds her son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3541/', "George Brooke")</script> (the Bye plot conspirator), who was born in 1568. In July 1565 she was described as mistress of the robes and by 1589 she was a lady of the bedchamber, though still at her original chamberer's salary of &pound;20. She appears to have been one of the most politically active of the gentlewomen and temporarily lost her place, a rare occurrence in the reign. This occurred in 1572, and was undoubtedly related to her husband's temporary disgrace over the Ridolfi plot. In 1574 she was restored and her back pay credited. The earl of Leicester reported on 9 June, &#145;My La. Cobham I thank God ys growen into very good favour and lyking ageyn &amp; I think very shortly shall be in her old place as her majestie hath of late fully promysed&#146;  (Paget papers, X, art. 10).<br>
<br>Frances Brooke was variously described as a supporter of the queen's marriage to the Archduke Charles in 1565 and an opponent of the Anjou marriage in 1571. In March 1586, after her husband became a privy councillor, Thomas Morgan, the agent of Mary, queen of Scots, advised contacting her, as she &#145;beareth a great stroke over her husband&#146;  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 3.137), but he also advised wariness in view of her old friendship with Bess of Hardwick, countess of Shrewsbury, the wife of Mary's former guardian who had become a notorious enemy of hers several years previously. That friendship is confirmed in a letter dated only 21 October that Frances wrote to the countess (&#145;her i love dearlye and most desyr to see&#146;) while doing some needlework for the queen during one of her pregnancies during the late 1560s (Folger, Talbot MS X.d. 428[16], quoted in Arnold, 96). The epithet &#145;whom never woman loved nor would love besides herself&#146;  (Strong, 1.131), may be unkind, but her portrait reveals a sharp-featured woman. Frances's closeness to the queen certainly did her family no harm. The marriage in 1579 of her nephew Sir Henry Newton (<i>c</i>.1531&#150;1599) to Katherine Paston, a waged gentlewoman of the privy chamber, from 27 July 1577, probably reflected her influence. In January 1569, thanks to her intercession, Elizabeth recommended her brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20052/', "Francis Newton")</script> (dean of Winchester, 1565&#150;72) for the prebend at Canterbury left vacant by the death of their brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20068/', "Theodore Newton")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20052/', "Newton, Francis")</script>] in 1569, but the benefice had already been granted elsewhere. Her daughter Elizabeth entered the privy chamber (though without wages) in the 1580s and married Robert Cecil, the only son of Lord Treasurer Burghley, on 31 August 1589. This was the high point of a close relationship with the Cecils; Frances had earlier been chief mourner at the funeral of Burghley's daughter Anne, countess of Oxford, in 1588, and a principal mourner in that of Lady Burghley in 1589. On the other hand her relations with Leicester were no less warm, and her adolescent son &#145;lame George&#146; was a member of the earl's household between 1584 and 1588. Frances died on 17 October 1592, predeceasing her husband, and was buried at Cobham.<br>
