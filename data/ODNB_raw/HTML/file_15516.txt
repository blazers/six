<span class="headword">Kidd,  William</span>  (1795/6&#150;1863), <span class="occ">painter</span>, was born in Edinburgh. Of his parents, nothing is known. He was first apprenticed to the na&iuml;ve animal painter James Howe and exhibited his first painting &#145;aged 13&#146; at the Associated Society of Artists, Edinburgh, in 1809. He was an enthusiastic admirer of the works of Alexander Carse and of Sir David Wilkie, and most of his subjects were domestic scenes from Scottish life, particularly in the manner of the latter. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1817 and at the British Institution in 1818, and was from that time a frequent contributor to both exhibitions as well as to the Society of British Artists. Kidd was very successful in depicting the pathos and humour of rustic life, and his pictures long maintained their popularity, particularly through the medium of engraving. In 1829 Kidd was elected an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy. Never able to manage his own affairs, Kidd fell at the end of his life into hopeless financial embarrassment, and was ultimately supported by his friends and a pension from the Royal Academy. He died in London on Christmas eve 1863. A version of his 1832 picture <span class="italic">Indulging</span>, now at the National Gallery of Scotland, shows Kidd at his finest, echoing both the psychological and the technical qualities of early work by Wilkie. A small panel, <span class="italic">John Toole the Actor in a Character Part</span>, in a private collection in Scotland, also reveals considerable charm and characterization.<br>
