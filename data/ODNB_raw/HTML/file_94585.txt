<span class="headword">Pierrepont,  Francis</span>  (<em>b. </em>after 1607&#150;1658), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22230/', "Robert Pierrepont, first earl of Kingston upon Hull (1584&#150;1643)")</script>, royalist army officer, of Holme Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, Gertrude Talbot (1587/8&#150;1649), daughter and coheir of Henry Talbot, a younger son of George Talbot, sixth earl of Shrewsbury. He was the younger brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22229/', "Henry Pierrepont, first marquess of Dorchester")</script>, and of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/22231/', "William Pierrepont")</script>. He was educated privately, it seems, for there is no record of his attendance at university or the inns of court. Lucy Hutchinson described him as &#145;a man of good naturall parts, but not of education according to his quallity&#146;  (Hutchinson, 72). She also accused him of &#145;a vaineglorious pride, which could not well brook any other should outstrip him in virtue and estimation&#146;  (ibid.). By a marriage licence dated 3 February 1636 Pierrepont married Elizabeth Braye, daughter and coheir of Thomas Braye of Eyam, Derbyshire; the couple had two sons and three daughters. Hutchinson conceded that Pierrepont's bride was rich, but of &#145;base parentage and penurious education&#146;  (ibid., 26). The family background of his second wife, Alisimon&#151;whom he had married by January 1651, and with whom he had one daughter&#151;is obscure.<br>
<br>In the elections to the Short Parliament early in 1640 Pierrepont's father promoted his return for the Nottinghamshire borough of East Retford, believing him better fitted for public life than his eldest son, Henry. Pierrepont was duly elected, but made no recorded impact at Westminster. His career during the 1640s indicates that he was a man of godly convictions. His father, on the other hand, was suspected of having recusant sympathies, and became a royalist&#151;if a reluctant one&#151;during the civil war. Henry Pierrepont, too, joined the king's party. But Francis and his elder brother William sided with parliament. Lucy Hutchinson regarded the Pierreponts' divided allegiance merely as a stratagem to protect their estates whichever side won. Yet she herself acknowledged that Pierrepont &#145;was well affected to honest men and to righteous liberty&#146;  (Hutchinson, 72). Certainly parliament regarded him as one of its most trusted adherents in Nottinghamshire, appointing him a deputy lieutenant and a colonel of foot. In addition, he was a leading member of the parliamentarian committees for Nottingham and the county.<br>
<br>In July 1644 Pierrepont was appointed a commissioner to reside with the Scottish army in northern England. This office&#151;probably procured for him by his brother William&#151;plunged him into Westminster's increasingly fraught relations with its Scottish allies. In November 1644 he joined Ferdinando, second Lord Fairfax, and Sir Thomas Fairfax in a letter to the committee of both kingdoms denouncing the Scots as a military liability. Pierrepont, like the Fairfaxes, and his brother William became closely associated with the anti-Scots, Independent faction at Westminster. From July 1645 he signed numerous letters to parliament from the committee of the northern association at York, complaining about the depredations of the Scottish army. As chairman of this committee he wielded considerable influence in the region. Hugh Potter, the northern steward of Algernon Percy, tenth earl of Northumberland, thought that &#145;Perpoint, for the present, carries the greatest stroak [in the northern association committee], and by his Brother [William] might p[ro]perly be moovd [on Northumberland's behalf]&#146;  (Potter to Northumberland, 21 June 1645, Alnwick Castle, Duke of Northumberland MSS, P.I.3q). In December 1645 the committee wrote to Nottingham corporation recommending Pierrepont as a recruiter MP for the town, and at some point during the winter of 1645&#150;6 he was elected accordingly. On first taking his seat in the Commons, in September 1646, he received the thanks of the house for his &#145;many great Services done to the Parliament&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 4.665).<br>
<br>Despite his industry in parliament's northern affairs, Pierrepont was named to only nine committees before Pride's Purge, and spent most of the period between autumn 1647 and July 1649 away from the Commons. The strongest evidence of his alignment with the Independent interest at Westminster is his presence among those MPs who fled to the army after the presbyterian counter-revolution in London late in July 1647. He seems to have been far more active on the Nottinghamshire county committee during 1647&#150;9 than he was at Westminster. Although not among those MPs secluded at Pride's Purge, he played no part in the trial and execution of the king&#151;both of which he almost certainly opposed&#151;and it was not until 7 May 1649 that he was admitted to the Rump.<br>
<br>Pierrepont was named to twenty-six committees in the Rump&#151;the majority between May and August 1649&#151;including the army and excise committees. A significant proportion of his appointments were to committees for improving or managing the Commonwealth's finances and the maintenance of its armed forces. According to Lucy Hutchinson, he was involved in presbyterian plotting against the Rump, and was only spared punishment by the intercession of her husband, Colonel John Hutchinson. In the absence of any corroborating evidence, this story must be treated with caution. Pierrepont certainly favoured presbyterianism, helping to establish a presbyterian ministry at St Mary's, Nottingham, in the early 1650s, and becoming a patron of the town's presbyterian congregation on High Pavement in 1656. But politically Pierrepont was closer to the Independents. It is revealing that he withdrew from public life at both national and local level not in 1649 but in 1653, following the dissolution of the Rump. When he was picked for sheriff in 1656, his brother William wrote to the lord chief justice, Oliver St John, pleading for his discharge on grounds of conscience: &#145;My brother and I doe very much honour my lord protector [Oliver Cromwell], and are most desirous to doe him service, but in this wee cannot&#146;  (Thurloe, <span class="italic">State papers</span>, 4.469).<br>
<br>Francis Pierrepont died on 30 January 1658, and was buried at St Mary's, Nottingham, on 18 March. In his will, he charged his estate&#151;reckoned to be worth &pound;5000 a year&#151;with portions of &pound;6000 for each of his two surviving daughters. He was succeeded by his only surviving son, Robert, who represented Nottingham in every parliament between 1660 and 1681, and was generally identified as an opponent of the court interest.<br>
