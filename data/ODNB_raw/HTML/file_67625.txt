<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Skues,  George Edward Mackenzie</span>  (1858&#150;1949), <span class="occ">angler and writer on fly-fishing</span>, was born on 13 August 1858 at St John's, Newfoundland, the eldest of eight children of William Mackenzie Skues (1828&#150;1892), surgeon-general of Aberdeen, and his wife, Margaret Ayre (1836&#150;1890), daughter of Christopher Ayre, clerk of the parliament and acting colonial secretary of Newfoundland.<br>
<br>At the age of three Skues was brought to his grandparents' house in Aberdeen from Newfoundland in a sailing vessel. In July 1872 he won a scholarship to Winchester College, which he left in 1877. After a year in the Channel Islands with his parents, he entered the offices of the family's solicitor, James Powell, and by 1895 had become a partner, remaining active until 1940, when he retired at the age of eighty-one.<br>
<br>Skues learned to fly-fish for trout on the River Itchen while at Winchester, and his fascination with the sport culminated in his becoming probably the finest all-round fly-fisherman and writer on fly-fishing of the twentieth century. The year 1883 was a turning point in Skues's fishing career. He was invited to fish the Abbots Barton stretch of the River Itchen, and fished there until 1938. In 1887 he took up trout-fly dressing after being presented with a copy of <span class="italic">Floating Flies and How to Dress Them</span> (1886) by the great Frederic Halford, who pioneered the practice of fishing artificial flies upstream on the surface for rising fish. This was adopted by fly-fishermen world wide.<br>
<br>In 1891 Skues met Halford during a week's fishing on the River Itchen. By then he was exploring the theory that when trout were not taking the floating natural fly or dun, it was more profitable to use an upstream sunk wet fly. This led to his use of artificial nymphs, being imitations of the larval stage of the natural fly, fished below the surface. His views, expounded in articles in the <span class="italic">Fishing Gazette</span> and the <span class="italic">Flyfishers' Journal</span>, culminated in the publication of his first book, <span class="italic">Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream</span>, in 1910. His further researches were embodied, together with an investigation into trout behaviour, in his 1921 book <span class="italic">The Way of a Trout with a Fly</span>. A further book, <span class="italic">Side-Lines, Side-Lights and Reflections</span>, published in 1932, was a collection of articles written for fishing magazines including the <span class="italic">Bulletin of the Anglers' Club of New York</span>. This was the most endearing of his books, with glimpses of the man himself and his sense of humour. Among Skues's attributes were a fluent and lively prose style together with great skill and dedication as a practical angler, despite the handicap of poor sight in one eye.<br>
<br>In 1938 a debate was held at the Flyfishers' Club of London which questioned Skues's theories that the nymph was an effective and ethical way of fishing for chalk-stream trout, and found against him. The disillusioned Skues, at the age of eighty, published a final defence with his 1939 book <span class="italic">Nymph Fishing for Chalk Stream Trout</span>.<br>
<br>Skues's place as one of the greats in fly-fishing history centres on his discovery that trout in chalk streams feed largely on nymphs, even during hatches, and not on the adult, emerged flies. His dressings of artificial nymphs specifically to represent larvae were new and radical. This was extremely controversial and challenged the rigid dry-fly theories of Halford and his disciples. Halford's greatness lay in his exposition of a method which became universal. Skues's forward-looking theories challenged what had become a rigid aridity with methods that were flexible and thoughtful, and were to become a predominant approach on both sides of the Atlantic.<br>
<br>In 1938, partly because his use of the nymph was not popular with fellow members of his syndicate on the Itchen, Skues left and took a rod on the River Nadder, near Salisbury. He went to live at the Nadder Vale Hotel in 1940 until it closed in 1948, when he moved to be near his brother in Beckenham, Kent. He finally finished fishing at the age of eighty-seven, but continued to maintain an immense correspondence with anglers from all over the world.<br>
<br>Skues died, unmarried, four days short of his ninety-first birthday, on 9 August 1949, at 23 Kelsey Park Road, Beckenham, succumbing to myocardial degeneration. His ashes were scattered on the banks of his beloved Itchen by his old friend William Mullins, the long-serving head keeper of the syndicate that fished the river.<br>
<br>Two more of Skues's books were published after his death. <span class="italic">Silk, Fur and Feather</span> appeared in 1950, and was a collection of articles on fly tying which had appeared in the <span class="italic">Fishing Gazette</span> under one of his many pen names, Val Conson. Skues had directed that the second, <span class="italic">Itchen Memories</span> (1951), should be published only after his death. It is a charming recollection of his days on the river he loved so well.<br>
