<span class="headword">Raymond, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1626/7&#150;1683), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was the son of Robert Raymond (<i>c</i>.1583&#150;1636), rector of Bures, Suffolk, and probably his second wife, Margaret, probably Margaret Harding, whom a Robert Raymond married in 1622. His father, having made clear his wish that Raymond be sent to the university, made provision for this in his will and appointed his wife, Margaret, executor. Raymond was duly educated at the school at Bishop's Stortford and then entered Christ's College, Cambridge, on 5 April 1643, aged sixteen, and graduated BA in 1646. Meanwhile he had entered Gray's Inn on 6 February 1645, and was called to the bar on 11 February 1651. By December 1673, when his son <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23207/', "Robert Raymond")</script> was born, he had married Anne (1633&#150;1715), daughter of Sir Edward Fishe, second baronet, of Southill, Bedfordshire. They also had two daughters who died in infancy. Raymond was created serjeant-at-law in October 1677, one of his sponsors being the earl of Danby. Elevation to the bench, as a baron of exchequer on 1 May 1679, was followed by a knighthood on 26 June. He was transferred to common pleas on 7 February 1680 and to the king's bench on 24 April 1680.<br>
<br>Raymond sat with Scroggs at Westminster during the trials of Elizabeth Cellier and Roger Palmer, earl of Castlemaine, and as an assessor to the House of Lords at the trial of Lord Stafford. He concurred with Chief Justice Sir Francis Pemberton in overruling, on 11 May 1681, the plea to the jurisdiction of the king's bench set up by Edward Fitzharris, and with Chief Justice Sir Francis North in passing sentence on 18 August the same year on Stephen College. He also concurred in the judgment on the <i>quo warranto</i> against the corporation of London in June 1683.<br>
<br>By this date Raymond must have been ill, because it was reported on 21 June 1683 that he was &#145;on the mending hand&#146;  (<span class="italic">Third Report</span>, HMC, 246). However, he died on 14 July, while on circuit. He was buried in Downham church, in which parish was situated his seat, Tremnall Park. To Roger North he was &#145;a mild, passive man, who had neither dexterity nor spirit to oppose a popular rage&#146;  (North, 1.131), such as accusations of witchcraft. Raymond left in manuscript a valuable collection of reports first printed in 1696 under the title <span class="italic">Reports of divers special cases adjudged in the courts of king's bench, common pleas, and exchequer in the reign of King Charles II</span>. A second edition appeared in 1743, with further editions in 1793 and 1803.<br>
