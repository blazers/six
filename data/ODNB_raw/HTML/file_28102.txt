<span class="headword">Vansittart,  George Henry</span>  (1768&#150;1824), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, born on 16 July 1768, was the eldest son of George Vansittart (1745&#150;1825), of Bengal and Bisham Abbey, Berkshire, MP for Berkshire (1784&#150;1812), and his wife, Sarah, daughter of the Revd Sir James Stonhouse, baronet, of Radley, Berkshire. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/28104/', "Henry Vansittart (1777&#150;1843)")</script> was his younger brother. Henry Vansittart (1732&#150;1770?) and Robert Vansittart (1728&#150;1789) were his uncles. He was educated under Dr Warton at Winchester College, at a military academy at Strasbourg (when aged fifteen), and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated on 7 November 1785.<br>
<br>After obtaining a commission as ensign in the 19th foot on 18 October 1786, he was allowed a year's leave to study military science at Brunswick and attend the Prussian manoeuvres. He became lieutenant on 25 December 1787, exchanged to the 38th foot on 12 March 1788, and obtained a company in the 18th on 23 June 1790. He joined it at Gibraltar, went with it to Toulon in 1793 to support the anti-Jacobin Toulonnais, took part in the defence, and was one of the last men to leave. He became major in the New South Wales Corps on 20 November 1793, and lieutenant-colonel of the 95th rifles on 21 February 1794. He took part with it in the expedition to the Cape under Sir Alured Clarke in 1795. He was made colonel in the army on 26 January 1797; but the 95th was broken up in the course of that year, and for the next three years he was on half pay and in the Berkshire militia, which his uncle, Colonel Arthur Vansittart, had previously commanded.<br>
<br>On 10 April 1801 Vansittart became lieutenant-colonel of the 68th foot, went with it to the West Indies, and was present at the capture of St Lucia in June 1803. On 25 September he was promoted major-general, and served on the staff in England from 1804 to 1806, and in Ireland from 1806 to 1810, when he became lieutenant-general (25 July). While in command of the Oxford district he received the degree of DCL on 26 June 1805. He was made colonel of the 12th reserve battalion on 9 July 1803, and was transferred to the 1st garrison battalion on 25 February 1805. The colours of this battalion were afterwards presented to him, and later hung in the great hall in Bisham Abbey. He became general on 19 July 1821.<br>
<br>On 29 October 1818 Vansittart married Anna Maria, daughter and coheir of Thomas Copson of Sheppey Hall, Leicestershire. She survived him, with one son, George Henry (1823&#150;1885); a second son, Augustus Arthur (1824&#150;1882), was born posthumously. Vansittart died on 4 February 1824.<br>
