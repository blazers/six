<span class="headword">Vinsauf,  Geoffrey  of</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Galfridus Anglicus]</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1208&#150;1213), <span class="occ">poet and teacher of grammar and rhetoric</span>, also called Anglicus, is best-known as the author of the <span class="italic">Poetria nova</span> (&#145;The new poetics&#146;), the single most successful textbook on rhetorical composition written during the middle ages. It is not known what his name means. What little is known about his life comes chiefly from the <span class="italic">Poetria nova</span> and a shorter poem, <span class="italic">Causa Magistri Gaufredi Vinesauf</span>, preserved in Glasgow University Library, Hunterian MS V.8.14. An Englishman, he studied at Paris and perhaps also at Bologna. While teaching at Northampton, he became involved in a legal dispute with his rival Robert, who had been his friend at Paris. When Bishop Adam of St Asaph (1175&#150;81) ruled against him, Geoffrey wrote the <span class="italic">Causa</span> to tell the archbishop of Canterbury his side of the story and appeal for help. He dedicated the <span class="italic">Poetria nova</span> to Innocent III, during whose pontificate he had visited Rome in the English king's service. The king in question was John, and if the plea for reconciliation with which the <span class="italic">Poetria nova</span> concludes is addressed to Innocent III, then the work must have taken its final shape between 1208, when England was placed under papal interdict, and 1213, when Pope Innocent was reconciled with King John. Nothing is known about Geoffrey's life after this date.<br>
<br>In addition to the <span class="italic">Poetria nova</span> Geoffrey almost certainly composed two prose treatises on rhetorical composition&#151;<span class="italic">Documentum de modo et arte dictandi et versificandi</span> and <span class="italic">Summa de coloribus rhetoricis</span>&#151;and a number of shorter poems. All of these works have been printed by Faral (<span class="italic">Arts po&eacute;tiques</span>; Manuscrit 511), and many of the short poems by Harbert (<span class="italic">Thirteenth-Century Anthology</span>). The <span class="italic">Documentum</span> survives in two versions, preserved in some twenty English manuscripts. The shorter version, printed by Faral, is probably authentic; the longer and still unprinted version is either the work of a later author or else underwent interpolation after Geoffrey's death. Geoffrey may also be the author of a <span class="italic">Summa de arte dictandi</span> (1188&#150;90), written at Bologna and printed by Licitra.<br>
<br>None of Geoffrey's other works approached the <span class="italic">Poetria nova</span> in popularity. It is preserved in nearly 200 manuscripts from all parts of Europe, and many copies are provided with glosses or accompanied by full-scale commentaries. The commentaries indicate that an important source of its appeal was the fact that it was not only about the art of poetry but also an example of that art, a poem of 2116 hexameter lines. In this respect it resembled one of its two main sources, Horace's <span class="italic">Ars poetica</span>, also known as the &#145;old poetics&#146;. What made Geoffrey's &#145;poetics&#146; new was in part its equal reliance on the pseudo-Ciceronian <span class="italic">Rhetorica ad Herennium</span>, often called the &#145;new rhetoric&#146;. The five canons of rhetoric&#151;invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery&#151;provide the poem's structure, with arrangement (mainly the varieties of artificial order) and style (techniques for amplifying and abbreviating the subject matter, difficult and easy ornament, and so on) receiving fullest treatment. Concise yet comprehensive, the <span class="italic">Poetria nova</span> combines the essentials of grammatical and rhetorical instruction, offering precepts equally applicable to the composition of prose and verse. The prose <span class="italic">Documentum</span> covers most of the same and a few additional subjects, but without the economy, inventiveness, and technical virtuosity that made the <span class="italic">Poetria nova</span> so popular.<br>
<br>For at least three centuries Geoffrey of Vinsauf was considered the supreme authority on the art of poetry. Chaucer adopted his metaphor of poetic invention  (<span class="italic">Poetria nova</span>, trans. Nims, 43ff) in <span class="italic">Troylus and Cryseyde</span> and mentioned him by name when parodying his rhetorical lament for the death of Richard I  (ibid., 368ff.) in &#145;The Nun's Priest's Tale&#146;. His influence outlived the middle ages: as late as 1489 Erasmus rated his value to students of poetry on a par with that of Cicero, Quintilian, and Horace. In modern times he is read by students of medieval literature rather than by apprentice poets, but his fame is sufficient to have justified three separate translations of the <span class="italic">Poetria nova</span> and one of the <span class="italic">Documentum</span>.<br>
