<span class="headword">Shirley, Sir  Robert</span>, fourth baronet  (1629&#150;1656), <span class="occ">royalist conspirator</span>, was the second son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70620/', "Sir Henry Shirley, second baronet (1589&#150;1633)")</script>, of Eatington, Warwickshire, and Staunton Harold, Leicestershire, and his wife, Dorothy Devereux (1600&#150;1636) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/68096/', "Stafford, Lady Dorothy")</script>], second daughter of Robert Devereux, second earl of Essex. A descendant of the ancient family seated at Eatington, his father and grandparents were recusants, but he was brought up within the Church of England by his mother. He was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, on 12 August 1645. The following year, on the death of his elder brother, Charles, he inherited the baronetcy and also married, against the wishes of his family, Katharine (<i>d</i>. 1672), daughter of Humphrey Okeover, of Okeover, Staffordshire. They would have five children.<br>
<br>Following the death of his uncle, the earl of Essex, Shirley received a moiety of the large possessions of the Devereux family in England and Ireland. After the execution of Charles I he worked in close contact with those aiming for the restoration of monarch and church. He first clashed with the government in 1648 when he confronted soldiers at the parliamentary garrison at Ashby-de-la-Zouch. His association with Staffordshire opponents of the republican regime led to his first imprisonment in the Tower of London on 4 May 1650 and the sequestration of his estates, though he was soon released and the sequestration lifted. In 1654 he was involved in attending secret meetings to support the exiled king by royalists living in the midland counties, and had become the &#145;chief man in the Royalist organization&#146; in his area  (Underdown, 144), and a recipient of arms. He was again arrested and sent to the Tower. While there he was appointed the royalists' financial agent, having already given substantial sums for the king's service. From there too, in 1656, he drew up proposals for royalist reorganization on the basis of complete identification of the royal cause with the Church of England, urging that &#145;whosoever in these times of persecution professes himself a son of the Church will also by the same principles be a loyal subject&#146;. With clergy acting as agents, bishops would be required to resume their episcopal responsibilities, and the laity must refuse any ministry by ministers lacking episcopal ordination. Weekly communions were advocated, as were alms to provide for the support of the clergy, but the proposals failed to bear fruit.<br>
<br>Shirley had sheltered, supported, and employed as his chaplains many of the deprived clergy, among them Robert Mapletoft, Gilbert Sheldon, Henry Hammond, and Peter Gunning. From 1653 he rebuilt the church at Staunton Harold in pure Gothic. The inscription noted &#145;In the year 1653 when all things Sacred were throughout the nation Either demolisht or profaned Sir Robert Shirley Barronet, Founded this Church; whose singular praise it is to have done the best thing in the worst times and hoped them in the most callamitous&#146;  (Lacy, 25). Although he died before the whole church was finished he left explicit instructions in his will as to how the church, the interior especially, should be completed.<br>
<br>A few days before his death in the Tower on 28 November 1656, probably of smallpox, Shirley set apart &pound;600 per annum for the king's cause. The funeral oration by Sheldon, his chaplain, had an apt text, <span class="roman">Luke</span> 7: 5, &#145;He loved our nation and he hath built us a synagogue&#146;. He was buried on 22 December at the church at Breedon on the Hill, Leicestershire, the burial place of his ancestors, and in 1661 his remains were removed to Staunton Harold and buried in the chancel of Holy Trinity Church. In his will he sought to ensure that any profits he had made from church lands or tithes were shared among the distressed orthodox clergy. Writing to Secretary Nicholas on 17 December 1656 Hyde expressed his hopes that &#145;the news may not be true of the honest gentleman in the Tower, whose loss at this time cannot be repaired&#146;  (<span class="italic">Clarendon State Papers</span>, 3.215).<br>
