<span class="headword">Ranger,  William</span>  (1799&#150;1863), <span class="occ">civil engineer and sanitary inspector</span>, was the son of Richard Ranger (<i>d</i>. 1839), a builder and later town commissioner, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Martin, who were married on 21 October 1798. He was born in 1799 and baptized on 23 November at St Mary's, Ringmer, near Lewes, Sussex. His father had established himself as a builder in Brighton during the prosperous Regency period, and was town commissioner before and after the <span class="roman">New Town Act</span> of 1824.<br>
<br>Details of Ranger's childhood are not known, but he joined in his father's building firm, Ranger &amp; Son, established at 13 Crescent Street and 4 New Road, Brighton. When Charles Barry won the competition for building the new church of St Peter, Ranger was appointed contractor in 1823, the church opening in 1828. Again, when Barry was appointed the architect of the Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, Ranger received the contract to build it in 1825. He also secured the contract for building the Esplanade, which Henry Edward Kendal jun. had designed, and for landscaping the beach and building a tunnel under the Marine Parade. This work was undertaken between 1828 and 1830, and finished by Thomas Cubitt, the builder of Kemp Town.<br>
<br>From the late 1820s Ranger also practised as a surveyor. He began by working for the commissioners of the Pevensey Level, and then gave advice about the draining of marshes in the neighbourhood of Worthing, though the Worthing town commissioners rejected his plans for their own town drainage. He provided the masonry for the Norfolk suspension bridge, designed by W. Tierney Clarke, which opened in 1833 at New Shoreham in the Adur valley, to carry the main Brighton to Worthing road.<br>
<br>In 1832 Ranger patented a kind of cement known as Ranger's artificial stone. The principal ingredient was &#145;grey lime&#146; from the South Downs. The invention was reported in <span class="italic">The Times</span>, and he moved to London about 1833 to set up a patent stone manufactory in Lambeth Palace Road. He secured a further patent in 1834 for improvements to the original invention. Barry used his artificial stone in the building of the College of Surgeons in Lincoln's Inn Square in 1836, and it was used earlier for the Wellington Barracks.<br>
<br>Between 1836 and 1838 Ranger was employed by the Great Western Railway to carry out three contracts, two at Bristol and one near Reading, which included tunnelling, earthworks, and a bridge over the Avon. The contracts overstretched his financial resources and, despite borrowing from the railway company, he failed to meet deadlines. The company took possession of his machinery and materials in July 1838 for non-completion of contract, whereupon he filed a bill against it for fraud, claiming he was misled over the nature of the rock and over Brunel's dual role as engineer and shareholder. The court of chancery dismissed his initial injunction with costs and he was no more successful on appeal. The case of <i>Ranger v. the Great Western Railway</i> was heard twice before the House of Lords, in 1847 and in 1854, but no judgment was given until 1854 because of the death of Lord Chancellor Cottenham.<br>
<br>Ranger was also employed by the marquess of Bristol to make alterations at his country seat at Ickworth, Suffolk, and to design two modest churches in Early English style, both afterwards listed buildings: the first was St Mary's, Westley (1835), and the second St John's, Bury St Edmunds (1841), the opening of which was attended by a duke, an earl, and a lord, as well as by the marquess.<br>
<br>Noble patronage probably accounts for Ranger's appointment in 1841 as professor of architecture and engineering at Putney College, founded in 1839 at Gordon House, near Hampstead, as the College of Civil Engineers. The college migrated via Battersea to Putney House in 1841, surviving until 1851. He was also a lecturer at the Royal Engineers establishment at Chatham.<br>
<br>In December 1848 Ranger was appointed one of the General Board of Health's six superintending inspectors, who were paid 3 guineas a day. Their principal task was to carry out preliminary inquiries, holding open court to hear evidence about the sanitary state of the places they visited and making recommendations about drainage, sanitation, and water supply. Among the first places he investigated were Barnard Castle, Cambridge, Darlington, Southampton, and Tottenham. He was also consulting engineer for the local boards of Dartford and Croydon. He earned unstinted praise at the general board, especially for his dual role at Croydon, the board's showpiece, since it was the first completed scheme. But a typhoid epidemic there in 1852&#150;3 lay both the general board and its inspectors open to charges of incompetence, resulting in a Home Office inquiry in which Neil Arnott and Thomas Page criticized the alterations Ranger had made to the local board's original plan, and also the division of responsibilities which had allowed Ranger to act as both superintending and consultant engineer. When the general board was reconstituted in 1854, its role much diminished, T. W. Rammel and Robert Rawlinson both declined the offer of becoming superintending inspectors, thus enabling Ranger to retain the position. Although he was forbidden to undertake consultancy work, Ranger was given a salary of &pound;800 a year, and he continued to write reports until the board's demise in 1858. He was married to Sarah, who died in 1860. Ranger died three years after his wife, at his home at 39 St George's Square, Pimlico, on 12 September 1863.<br>
