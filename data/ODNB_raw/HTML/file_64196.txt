<span class="headword">Andrews,  Philip Walter Sawford</span>  (1914&#150;1971), <span class="occ">economist</span>, was born at 124 Adelaide Road, Southampton, on 12 March 1914, the son (there was also a daughter) of Frederick Walter Andrews, a railway shunter and later chief traffic inspector at Southampton docks, and his wife, Ethel Alice Sawford, an agricultural labourer's daughter. He was a grammar school pupil in the town (1925?&#150;1931), and in 1931 he entered University College, Southampton, as a scholar. His second-class degree in economics (1934) he attributed to the teaching of economic theory piecemeal rather than as a single body of analysis.<br>
<br>On 27 July 1936, while a research assistant at the college, Andrews married at Ryde, Isle of Wight, Mary Margaret Hawes (<i>b</i>. 1911), daughter of Thomas Charles Hawes, a plumber; they had two sons. Encouraged by Professor D. H. Macgregor, a year later he joined the Oxford Institute of Statistics to work on company accounts, and became secretary of the Oxford Economists' Research Group, which quizzed selected businessmen on economic issues. One of the group's findings was that entrepreneurs who competed under conditions of uncertainty in oligopolistic markets priced their goods according to the full cost of producing them. This finding, which was greatly to influence the future direction of Andrews's work, challenged the basic tenets of the then current theory of the firm, a static one that assumed perfect certainty.<br>
<br>During the Second World War, Andrews, a conscientious objector, became part of a Nuffield College team undertaking economic and social surveys. With the financial support of Samuel Courtauld he embarked on research into the relative efficiency of large and small firms, concentrating on the rayon and footwear industries. He soon had a more comprehensive practical knowledge of the economics of business decision making than any of his British contemporaries. In 1949 he published <span class="italic">Manufacturing Business</span> as an account of current business practice. However, for reasons of confidentiality, he could not cite his basic industry data. Like Alfred Marshall before him, he wrote for both economists and businessmen, thus greatly weakening his book's impact among fellow academics. Having declined to present his pioneering ideas in the context of the conventional theory of the firm, he allowed critics scope to dismiss their significance.<br>
<br>As an official fellow of Nuffield from 1947, Andrews continued to develop his ideas, despite their disappointing reception. In his own theory of firms' operations he discovered parallels with the work of Marshall, of whom he regarded himself as the true heir. Thus he found that firms set their prices according to normal (rather than full) costs, as the risk of entry by rivals in related industries imposed an upper limit on prices. In 1952 Andrews founded the <span class="italic">Journal of Industrial Economics</span>, offering a platform to academics and business economists alike. He acted as consultant for several restrictive practice court cases, including that of the net book agreement, and extended his analysis to retailing and corporate investment. However, not until 1964 did he publish his long-awaited critique of the static theory of the firm, <span class="italic">On Competition in Economic Theory</span>, which covered both manufacturing and retailing firms.<br>
<br>Since 1942, Andrews's assistant and collaborator had been Elizabeth Brunner (<i>d</i>. 1983). A graduate in English, she was taught economics by him, and her quick perception and clear style (his own did not make for easy reading) markedly benefited their subsequent joint publications. He was at his best in the cut and thrust of graduate seminars, from which former students conveyed his teachings to many parts of the world.<br>
<br>Andrews dressed very conventionally, and kept his Hampshire burr to the end. A cultivated man, he adorned his handsome rooms in Nuffield with statues, paintings (some his own handiwork), and sculptures. He played the viola and read widely outside economics, especially in philosophy and literature; he would often bubble with enthusiasm over something new he had learned. Sensitive and in some ways immature, he could be genial and kind; friends and colleagues were warmed by his open, welcoming smile, but remained watchful for passing thunderclouds. A constant hurt for him was the hostility of some (by no means all) senior Oxford economists, one of whom publicly hoped he would not indoctrinate undergraduates with his heterodoxy.<br>
<br>In 1967 Andrews left an increasingly uncongenial Oxford for a chair in economics at Lancaster University, and Elizabeth Brunner became a lecturer (and later a professor) there. With characteristic energy he threw himself into the busy life of a new university, inspiring a large department of young colleagues with his commitment and interest in their work, despite the inexorable progression of a mortal illness. In 1966, during a lecturing visit to Harvard, he was diagnosed as having cancer, and he died of the disease on 5 March 1971, at his family home, Eskrigge House, Gressingham, near Carnforth, Lancashire. Four years later Elizabeth Brunner published&#151;with Andrews named as co-author&#151;<span class="italic">Studies in Pricing</span>, which contains some of the most satisfying expositions of their lives' work. The significance of Andrews's original and often subtle ideas was not appreciated at all widely until decades after his death. However, the rise of evolutionary (as contrasted with equilibrium) economics, and a revival of interest in the work of Marshall on firms, promised that Andrews's analysis, decades ahead of its time, would in due course receive broader recognition.<br>
