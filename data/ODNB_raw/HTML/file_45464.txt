<span class="headword">Nevinson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Jones]</span>,  Margaret Wynne</span>  (1858&#150;1932), <span class="occ">women's rights activist</span>, was born at Vicarage House, Lower Church Gate, Leicester, on 11 January 1858, the daughter of the Revd Timothy Jones (<i>c</i>.1813&#150;1873/4) and his wife, Mary Louisa (<i>c</i>.1830&#150;1888). Her father, vicar of St Margaret's Church, Leicester, was a classical scholar who taught her Latin and Greek alongside her five brothers. Her mother had more traditional notions of appropriate pursuits for her only daughter. A brief, unhappy spell in an Oxford Anglican convent school was followed by finishing school in Paris. The unexpected death of her father increased Margaret's wish to live independently. She tried governessing, then went to Cologne as a pupil teacher in a professor's family. In the early 1880s she became a classics mistress at South Hampstead high school, London. She also studied for examinations in Education, German, and Latin, becoming one of sixty-three women who gained the title and diploma of lady literate in arts in 1882 from St Andrews University.<br>
<br>On 18 April 1884 in London Margaret Jones married a childhood friend, the journalist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35206/', "Henry Woodd Nevinson (1856&#150;1941)")</script>. They spent a year in Germany, Henry studying at Jena University while Margaret resumed teaching English. Their daughter (Mary) Philippa, who became a talented musician, was born in Germany. After returning to London (encouraged by Samuel and Henrietta Barnett) they moved to workmen's flats in Whitechapel. Margaret Nevinson taught French evening classes at Toynbee Hall and helped with St Jude's Girls' Club. She then became a rent collector in artisans' dwellings. In 1887 the Nevinsons moved to Hampstead. Their son, born in August 1889, was the artist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35205/', "Christopher Richard Wynne Nevinson")</script>. His autobiography describes growing up as part of the Hampstead intelligentsia. His mother was &#145;always a pioneer&#146;, from her shingled hair and hatred of lace curtains to her espousal of modern art, European outlook, and commitment to social justice  (C. R. W. Nevinson, 6). In 1901 the Nevinsons bought a house in Downside Crescent, Haverstock Hill, where Margaret lived for the rest of her life. By now Margaret and Henry's lives were running along separate grooves, not least because of the latter's night newspaper work. Henry also became a war correspondent so was frequently away for months. The marriage suffered though they never formally separated.<br>
<br>Margaret Nevinson was a school manager for twenty-five years, initially for the London school board in the East End, then for the London county council (north St Pancras). In 1904 she became a Hampstead poor-law guardian, determined to root out inefficiency and expose anomalies, particularly where they had an impact on poor women. Her greatest contribution was probably not so much through the weekly meetings she attended so regularly as in publicizing the problems of the poor law. She did this through talks to women's suffrage groups, articles, and stories. In 1918 she published twenty-six tales known as <span class="italic">Workhouse Characters</span>. These included one story which had earlier been turned into a one-act play called <span class="italic">In the Workhouse</span>. Performed in 1911 in the Kingsway Theatre by Edy Craig's Pioneer Players, it dramatized the fact that a married woman could be compelled to remain in a workhouse simply because of her husband's marital authority. The stir this provoked helped change the law in 1913. Gender-specific legislation discriminating against married women was increasingly the focus of Margaret Nevinson's writings whether through pamphlets such as <span class="italic">The Legal Wrongs of Women</span> (Women's Freedom League, 1923) or via her thinly disguised autobiographical stories, <span class="italic">Fragments of Life</span> (1922).<br>
<br>Margaret Nevinson joined a number of women's suffrage groups. A committed Christian, she was a member of the Church League for Women's Suffrage, spoke for the Cymric Suffrage Union (her father, originally from Lampeter, was a Welsh speaker) and was treasurer of the Women Writers' Suffrage League. Her main commitment was, however, to the Women's Freedom League (WFL). She was a founder member in 1907, became treasurer of the Hampstead branch and was widely known as a witty speaker with a good stock of stories. She frequently invoked classical and biblical themes to illustrate points. She participated in passive resistance such as the suffrage picket outside parliament.<br>
<br>An early trainee in massage, during the war Margaret Nevinson treated wounded Belgian soldiers. Although she had refused to speak on behalf of parties or causes other than suffrage prior to gaining the vote, once enfranchised she supported the Liberal Party. She also lectured on the League of Nations and became a vice-president of the Women's Peace Crusade. In 1927 she was elected to the committee of the Society of Women Journalists. Her most significant post-war public service was, however, as a pioneer female justice of the peace. Nominated by the WFL, in June 1920 she became the first woman in London to adjudicate at criminal petty sessions. With her experience and self-confessed &#145;passion for justice&#146; and &#145;devotion to logic&#146;  (M. W. Nevinson, 254), she again played a crucial role in Hampstead's affairs. She also visited the United States to study the American probationary system. In 1921 she was one of three women appointed to the lord chancellor's London county justices advisory committee. Margaret Nevinson's autobiography was published in 1926. Her final years were lonely ones, plagued by depression. She died of kidney failure at her Hampstead home, 4 Downside Crescent, on 8 June 1932. She was buried on 11 June at St Stephen's, Rosslyn Hill, London.<br>
