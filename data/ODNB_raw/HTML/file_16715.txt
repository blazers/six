<span class="headword">Lindsay,  Robert, of Pitscottie</span>  (<em>c.</em>1532&#150;<em>c.</em>1586), <span class="occ">historian</span>, was a younger son of William Lindsay of Pyotstoun and Isabella Logan (married 1529), and a cousin of Patrick Lindsay, sixth Lord Lindsay of the Byres (1521?&#150;1589). His date of birth has to be deduced from his first public appearance, in December 1553, when he was granted the escheated goods of Andrew Lindsay, a burgess of Edinburgh and probably a kinsman. In December 1560 he was styled &#145;of Pitscottie&#146; when he was a member of an assize at Cupar, Fife, and he was associated with it again two years later. He may have held Pitscottie as a tenant. There is no evidence of his education and his date of death is unknown. It was certainly before 1592, when his son Christopher was styled &#145;of Pitscottie&#146;. His <span class="italic">History</span> ends on 1 January 1576; the preface may arguably be no later than 24 April 1579 when one dedicatee, John, fourth earl of Atholl, died, and must certainly be earlier than 29 August 1586 when the other dedicatee, Robert Stewart, bishop of Caithness, died.<br>
<br>Pitscottie's <span class="italic">History</span> is a continuation, from the death of James I in 1437, of John Bellenden's Scots adaptation of Hector Boece's Latin history of Scotland. For events before <i>c</i>.1555 his sources were a mixture of borrowings from Boece, family traditions, personal recollections of Fife men, and general knowledge. An unnamed but likely source is his kinsman the Lyon herald, Sir David Lindsay of the Mount (1486?&#150;1555); some of the latter's verses appear as epigraphs in Pitscottie's work and he is the best candidate for providing information about the reigns of James IV and V and the earliest years of Queen Mary.<br>
<br>After about 1555 Pitscottie uses contemporary material and his personal bias becomes clearer. His story becomes a protestant chronicle, telling a tale of protestant martyrs (much as John Knox did, but it is highly unlikely that Pitscottie knew Knox's history, which was not printed until 1586&#150;7), of the struggles of the lords of the congregation for their faith, and, later, of the regents for the infant James VI against Queen Mary's men. This latter part is by far the most original and spirited, and Pitscottie clearly sees it as a critical, almost apocalyptic, struggle.<br>
<br>The climax of the <span class="italic">History</span> comes with the attempts of the regents to defeat the queen's men tenaciously holding out in Edinburgh Castle in the early 1570s. Pitscottie never reveals whether he took part in these raids, counter-raids, and artillery duels. If he did not, he nevertheless had excellent sources&#151;one was probably his kinsman Lindsay of the Byres, a leader of the regent's forces&#151;and he has left a vivid picture of the changing fortunes of the battle, to say nothing of demands for men and money which must have severely strained the resources of Fife, Forfarshire, and the Lothians. This part ends with the surrender of Edinburgh Castle in 1573&#151;thanks largely to the help of English gunners&#151;and peace between the two main Scottish factions.<br>
<br>Pitscottie's attention then turns to Scottish soldiers being shipped to the Baltic; he notes other religious struggles in mainland Europe and a series of domestic problems as James Douglas, earl of Morton, tried as regent to restore order. He is now dutifully recording plague, dearth, and high taxation; some of the earlier verve has gone&#151;except at the end, when he records the happy wedding at Cupar on 25 December 1575 (significantly, he calls it neither Yule nor Christmas) of the earl of Angus and a lady from Fife.<br>
<br>Although only one manuscript (formerly in the collection of John Scott of Halkshill) preserves the text as Pitscottie probably intended it, much of his work must have soon become known, since at least sixteen manuscripts (and possibly four more) have survived and there are scrappy continuations to 1603. The <span class="italic">History</span> was first published, by subscription, at Edinburgh in 1728 by Robert Freebairn, a well-known printer, bookseller, and ardent Jacobite; later editions appeared at Glasgow in 1749, and again at Edinburgh in 1778 and 1814. All were superseded when a full text, based on two of the oldest manuscripts, with extensive introduction, notes, and glossary, was published in three volumes by A. J. G. Mackay for the Scottish Text Society between 1899 and 1911.<br>
<br>Sir Walter Scott read Pitscottie as a teenager and was carried away by his telling phrases and vivacity; parts of Pitscottie turn up little altered in <span class="italic">Marmion</span> and <span class="italic">Tales of a Grandfather</span>, and shorter quotations appear in the <span class="roman">Waverley</span> novels. The mature Scott knew very well that Pitscottie was historically unreliable in the earlier part of his work but recommended him for his language, anecdotes, and knack of presenting a scene&#151;and as a relief from contemporary dry-as-dust writing, especially John Pinkerton's <span class="italic">History of Scotland</span> (1797). Freebairn and Scott together put Pitscottie on the map, and he has been there ever since.<br>
<br>Modern studies have gone much further than Scott in showing just how garbled, inventive, and biased Pitscottie can be. He is not only pro-protestant; anti-Hamilton and anti-Douglas strains are also evident&#151;the latter may explain why the work was not printed during the regency of Morton (1572&#150;80) and so confined to manuscript circulation then and, as it turned out, for some 150 years. Whatever the critical historians may say, the romantic view of Scottish history never dies and so the influence of Pitscottie's colourful episodes, such as the death of James III's favourite at Lauder, the same king's fate after the battle of Sauchieburn, the doings of James IV before and at Flodden, and the deathbed of James V, is certain to persist. Yet there may often be a substratum of fact or probability in what he says, usually when the tale can be plausibly traced to one of his known informants, and in the last fifteen years of the narrative what he says is often confirmed elsewhere.<br>
<br>Like other contemporary diarists, Pitscottie wrote in Scots. Otherwise, his techniques are those of medieval chroniclers; he took material as and when he could find it and is no less episodic and unreflective in the way he uses it. His focus is usually regional, centred especially on the east half of Fife and the Lothians. But he also drew on a unique reservoir of family tradition. Throughout there are stories of Lindsays behaving honourably and loyally. The stories may not always be true, but they entertain at the same time as they record traditional family themes and oral lore. No earlier Scot had written quite like this about his own blood relatives or left such a lively personal view of events. The best verdict on Pitscottie (it is rather like Scott's) was given by W. C. Dickinson in 1949: he is &#145;to be used with the greatest caution, but to be read with the greatest pleasure&#146;  (<span class="italic">Knox's History</span>, 2.347).<br>
