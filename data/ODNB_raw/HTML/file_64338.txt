<span class="headword">Fisher,  David (I)</span>  (1760&#150;1832), <span class="occ">theatre manager and actor</span>, was born on 26 December 1760 in Norwich, the eldest son and third of the eleven children of David Fisher (1729&#150;1782), a craftsman, and his wife, Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> West (1730&#150;1819). The family were farmers, earlier worsted weavers, in Hethersett, near Norwich, where they had owned land since the mid-seventeenth century. Fisher, however, grew up in Norwich, where, after schooling, he was trained as a carpenter and worked in the building trade. His fine tenor voice, his striking appearance, with blue eyes and red-gold hair, and his reputation as an amateur performer led the manager of the Norwich Theatre Royal, Giles Barrett, to give him a trial appearance, on the strength of which he offered him an engagement, primarily as a singer. He is also known to have worked, in the early 1780s, with a travelling company run by William Scraggs. The precise order of events is uncertain, but from 1786 onwards his name appears regularly as singer and actor on the Theatre Royal's playbills, both in Norwich and in the principal towns of Norfolk and Suffolk, which the company visited on its annual tour of what was known as the outer circuit. His exceptional singing, particularly in the patriotic sea songs then in vogue, brought him a considerable personal following.<br>
<br>On 16 March 1788 Fisher married Elizabeth Burrell (<i>d</i>. 1814), aged about twenty-five, who then also became a performer with the company. They remained in its ranks for another four years, by which time they had a three-year-old son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9491/', "David (II) Fisher")</script>, and a small daughter, a second Elizabeth. However, on 7 April 1792 the following announcement appeared in the <span class="italic">Norfolk Chronicle</span>:<blockquote>Mr SCRAGGS having resigned to Mr FISHER, of the Theatre Royal, Norwich, the MANAGEMENT of the Company of Comedians, to be by him conducted upon the plan of the first provincial Theatres in the kingdom&#151;for which purpose a compleat set of scenes, wardrobe, etc., have been purchased and a respectable Company of performers engaged&#151;they jointly beg leave to solicit the patronage of the Nobility, Gentry, and other friends of Mr Scraggs in and near the principal towns in the Counties of Norfolk and Suffolk who have hitherto honoured Mr Scraggs, and to assure them that every exertion in their power will be employed to obviate those objections which have in some towns been made to the admission of a Company of Comedians.</blockquote>By this shrewd step Fisher entered on management in a formidable partnership, adding his own talents and personal prestige to the long experience and local contacts of Scraggs. On 28 April, after a joint farewell benefit, he and his wife left the Theatre Royal, and within days Fisher &amp; Co.'s Company of Comedians (more formally known as the Norfolk and Suffolk Company of Comedians) opened in Bungay, Suffolk. They were an instant success. On 5 July the two-month season ended &#145;with the greatest &eacute;clat&#146;, crowned by a rousing address written by a local celebrity. Before this was in print in the <span class="italic">Norfolk Chronicle</span>, the new company had opened more than 40 miles away in Sudbury, launched on a non-stop round of the smaller towns of the region (the &#145;inner circuit&#146;) which lasted without a break for the remaining forty years of Fisher's life and for a decade afterwards.<br>
<br>At the beginning there were half a dozen other companies travelling the two counties, but these steadily lost ground to the new management, not because it did anything radically different from the others, but because, as a matter of declared policy, it did things noticeably better. The evidence is in the playbills. Here can be seen that &#145;respectable company of performers&#146;, never fewer than twenty in number, led by the two families, with a complement of other professional players. Occasional appearances of the children augured well for the future, though not to the neglect of their education: local schools were found on the circuit for the boys, after which they went to a boarding-school in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, and received separate tuition in music, French, and dancing. The company were indeed &#145;respectable&#146;, as claimed, and it was this that enabled them to come unscathed through a puritan attack in Halesworth in 1808&#151;indeed to laugh it off in a comic song on the affair, sung by Fisher from the stage.<br>
<br>Among more tangible assets, the company's &#145;compleat set of scenes&#146;, already more than most travelling actors could boast, was constantly augmented by the work of successive London-trained scene-painters, engaged both to paint and to instruct the young Fishers in the art. Construction of scenery and trick effects was no problem to the manager, a qualified carpenter, and &#145;Machinery by Mr Fisher&#146; was a feature of their pantomimes. Costume too was a speciality. Writing in 1880, Fisher's grandson <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9492/', "David Nunn Fisher")</script> recollected:<blockquote>Amongst the things remarkable in the company was the accurate dressing&#151;a complete wardrobe for everything and everybody; but the feature of the Fisher wardrobe was the dressing of old comedies. &#145;Old David&#146; had costly presents of dresses of the last century, and bought largely of gentlemen's servants old swords, wigs in heaps, and some very costly dresses indeed. (<span class="italic">The Theatre</span>, 1 April 1880, 199)</blockquote>The dramatic repertory was immense: thirty or forty different pieces in each two-month season, from Shakespeare to the latest opera, farce, pantomime, or melodrama, interspersed with all kinds of music and dancing. The audience for this fare came from all classes, but most lucrative was &#145;the patronage of the Nobility and Gentry&#146; in each neighbourhood, and the number of gentlemen's seats in the vicinity was an important factor in working out a good itinerary. Moreover, Fisher was noted for being at ease with all ranks in society and was a welcome guest in the homes of the gentry. It was found well worth while for the property-man to deliver playbills to every big house within a 6-mile radius of the theatre.<br>
<br>The business was run on a sound family basis. David's two younger brothers, in addition to acting, were printer and box-book keeper respectively. His eldest son, David, became the scene-painter and his second son, Charles, assistant manager. The wider family lent its farm horses to pull the huge waggon-loads of paraphernalia from town to town. Finances were well managed and the actors could count on getting their weekly salaries and regular benefit nights.<br>
<br>By the early 1800s the company had established a profitable two-year circuit. The only things not up to standard were the buildings they played in; although they were called theatres on the playbills, most of them were in fact fitted-up barns. By 1812 Scraggs and his wife were dead and their son had set up on his own. Fisher, now sole manager, began to build. Already, two years before, he had bought land in Lowestoft, Suffolk, and it was here and in Wells next the Sea, on the north coast of Norfolk, that in 1812 he completed his first two theatres. This set the pattern for the next sixteen years, during which he also opened his own theatres in Halesworth (1812), Woodbridge (1814), Eye (1815), East Dereham (1816), Sudbury (1817), Thetford (1818), Beccles (1819), Swaffham (1822), Newmarket (1825), Bungay (1828), and North Walsham (1828). In Halesworth and Sudbury he bought existing theatres as they stood; elsewhere he rebuilt, or built anew on a fresh site, usually financing his projects by raising share capital from local patrons. They were small, simple structures, built to his own design, each with an adjacent family house. From the start they were hailed in the press for their comfort and practicality, neatness and elegance. Two contemporary watercolour sketches of the last of them (now in the Fisher collection), show the interior at North Walsham, decorated by David (II) Fisher. The stage is set with wings and backdrop for a rural scene. The small pit and gallery and the two curving rows of boxes are all in delicate beige, picked out in white, blue, and gold. Decorative gilded lamps adorn the boxes, and over all is a painted sky of summer blue with white clouds. As the papers said, it is &#145;neat and elegant&#146;.<br>
<br>In an indenture of 31 January 1827, with the end of his building programme in sight, Fisher professed himself desirous of retiring from management and made over to his three sons, David, Charles, and George, the running of the theatres, with their entire contents. The theatres themselves he left, by a will made the following day, to his brother-in-law Thomas Sadler, a grocer in Norwich, to hold in trust for his three nephews.<br>
<br>However, though he appears to have relinquished some of his managerial responsibilities, Fisher was undoubtedly still the head of the company, and as a performer he never retired at all. His name was on the playbills, acting in two plays and singing a comic song, for his own benefit night on 3 August 1832, just three days before he died suddenly at his theatre in Dereham, on 6 August. He had lost his wife, Elizabeth, in 1814 and an only daughter and youngest son had died young, but David (II) (1788&#150;1858), Charles (1792&#150;1869), and George (1793&#150;1864) were left to continue his life's work on the circuit. Through their own careers and those of their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren they handed on a family acting tradition which lasted for over 150 years.<br>
<br>The <span class="italic">Norfolk Chronicle</span> wrote of David Fisher when he died that he had been an indefatigable builder of theatres, a highly esteemed manager, a talented actor, a fond parent, a warm friend, and &#145;in the strictest sense an honest, just and upright man&#146;. At his funeral on 11 August 1832 carriages of distinguished patrons followed the cort&egrave;ge to East Dereham churchyard, Norfolk, in a procession a quarter of a mile long. This was the personal impact that he made. His wider achievement was to raise, decisively, the professional standards and moral reputation of the travelling theatre companies of his day. And the driving force behind it was something more passionate&#151;a great and incurable love of the stage. Fisher's hero was David Garrick, whose glories he could describe and manner of acting demonstrate even in old age. All his life he kept an impression of Nathaniel Marchant's small intaglio of Garrick with Shakespeare, a talisman, handed down as an heirloom in the family.<br>
