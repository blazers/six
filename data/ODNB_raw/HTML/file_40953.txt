<span class="headword">Renshaw,  William Charles</span>  (1861&#150;1904), <span class="occ">tennis player</span>, and his twin brother, <a name="cosubject_40952"></a><span class="headword">(James) Ernest Renshaw</span>  (1861&#150;1899), <span class="occ">also a tennis player and sometime doubles partner</span>, were born at Brandon Parade, Leamington, Warwickshire, on 3 January 1861, the sons of James Renshaw, of High Broughton, Manchester, a flax spinner, and his wife, Ellen Knight. James Renshaw died in September 1860, before his sons' birth, leaving an estate valued between &pound;60,000 and &pound;70,000. For two years the brothers attended Cheltenham College as day boys, before leaving in July 1874. Tradition has it that they learned to play tennis on asphalt courts in their home town, where Thomas Gem and J. B. A. Perera had established a club. Five years later they first entered the All England tennis championships at Wimbledon, but, overawed by the crowd, they chose not to play but to watch and learn. Their d&eacute;but on court at the championships came in 1880, when Willie was beaten in the second round and Ernest, for once progressing further than his older brother, reached round three. Then began a period of successes. Willie won the men's all-comers' singles title from 1881 to 1886 (though Herbert Lawford won the challenge round in 1884&#150;7), Ernest won it in 1888, and Willie won his seventh championship in 1889. Playing together they also won five men's doubles titles.<br>
<br>The Renshaw twins revolutionized tennis technique and tactics. Rich enough to be full-time amateurs, they practised hard, including during winter at the H&ocirc;tel Beau Site in Cannes on the French riviera. Until they came on the scene most players had attempted to bring to lawn tennis either the heavy cuts of real tennis or the wristy flicks of rackets. The Renshaws, in contrast, developed a distinctive lawn tennis style, often taking the ball early with volleys and smashes rather than waiting for it to bounce. They also radically changed the manner of playing doubles by having one player stand at the net to intercept and volley back returns of service. Willie was the better player, forceful, determined, and full of fire and dash, in contrast to the patient, graceful, and more restrained Ernest. The last appearance of a Renshaw at Wimbledon was in 1893, when the twins were drawn to play each other in the first round&#151;there being no seeding in those days&#151;but Willie withdrew in favour of his younger brother, who lost in the subsequent round.<br>
<br>Ernest Renshaw died on 2 September 1899 at The Grange, Waltham St Lawrence, near Twyford, Berkshire. He had ingested spirits of carbolic acid but the subsequent inquest could find no evidence whether this had been taken intentionally or not. Willie Renshaw, described as a gentleman of independent means, died at Swanage, Dorset, on 12 August 1904 following epileptic convulsions. Neither twin was married. Their relatives donated a trophy, the Renshaw cup, to the All England club, which for many years was presented to the winner of the men's singles at the Wimbledon championships.<br>
