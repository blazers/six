<span class="headword">Pimm,  James</span>  (1798&#150;1866), <span class="occ">caterer and inventor of the Pimm's cocktail</span>, was born on 9 November 1798, the fifth of twelve children of James Norris Pimm (1769&#150;1848), a yeoman farmer of Linstead, Kent, and Susanna Mills (1772&#150;1846); he was baptized at Newnham, Kent, on 9 April of the following year. At his marriage to Mary Southernden Mallery (1797&#150;1864) on 2 June 1822 in Chatham, Kent, Pimm's occupation was given as an oyster dealer, Kent being the principal source of oysters for the London market. Nine children were born of this marriage, of whom several died shortly after birth.<br>
<br>Baptism records for Pimm's children show that by 1824 he was established as the proprietor of an oyster bar, located first at Lombard Street, later at George Street, and finally at larger premises at 3, 4, and 5 Poultry in the City of London, where as &#145;James Pimm's Oyster Bar&#146; it was depicted on (John) <span class="italic">Tallis's Street Views</span> of 1840. These &#145;fast-food&#146; establishments served oysters and lobsters as well as other food, customarily accompanied with either stout or a rum-based &#145;house-cup&#146;. The drink offered by Pimm, which he had devised in the 1840s, was based on the newly fashionable gin, mixed with fruit extracts, liqueurs, spices, and bitter herbs, and soon gained in popularity.<br>
<br>Mary Pimm died on 28 February 1864. James Pimm died on 16 August 1866 at Bush Place, East Peckham, Kent. It is unclear exactly how and when Pimm's business was transferred to Horatio David Davies (1842&#150;1912) who had other hotel and restaurant interests. Davies was elected alderman for Cheap, the ward in which Pimm's bar was located; he subsequently rose to be lord mayor and then MP for Chatham. Under Davies's supervision the business expanded into five Pimm's restaurants, the last of which closed in 1967. By the end of the nineteenth century James's cocktail was being produced commercially and found a worldwide market. The original cocktail, now known as Pimm's no. 1, was accompanied by Pimm's numbered 2 to 6, based on Scotch and rye whiskies, rum, brandy, and vodka, but these were never as popular and were phased out by 1972. Eventually the firm was taken over by Guinness and is now owned by the Distillers Company. The recipe for Pimm's no. 1 remains a secret confined to a few within the firm, but is declared to be identical to that devised by James Pimm in the 1840s.<br>
