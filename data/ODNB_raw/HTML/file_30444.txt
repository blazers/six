<span class="headword">Arliss,  George</span> <span class="st"> [<em>real name </em>Augustus George Andrews]</span>  (1868&#150;1946), <span class="occ">actor</span>, was born in London on 10 April 1868, the third son of William Joseph Arliss Andrews, printer and publisher, and his wife, Rebekah Tomkins. He was educated in London and an early friendship with the two sons of the actress Nellie Farren turned his ambitions towards the stage. He made his first appearance in 1886 at the Elephant and Castle Theatre, where he obtained a variety of experience under Joseph A. Cave, an actor and manager of the old school. He married on 14 September 1899 Florence Kate Montgomery (1872/3&#150;1950), daughter of Douglas Gordon Montgomery Smith. It was a singularly happy marriage. She was herself an actress who frequently played the part of his wife on stage and screen. They had no children. He then toured throughout the provinces for some years, eventually returning to London where his first appearance of note was his performance as Cayley Drummle in Pinero's <span class="italic">The Second Mrs Tanqueray</span> with Mrs Patrick Campbell, whom he accompanied to America in November 1901. He was next engaged by David Belasco to support Blanche Bates at the Belasco Theatre, New York, and in 1902 he made an immense success as Zakkuri in <span class="italic">The Darling of the Gods</span> by Belasco and J. Luther Long. Later he passed under the management of Harrison Grey Fiske and he appeared with Mrs Fiske in <span class="italic">Becky Sharp</span> by Robert Hitchens and Cosmo Gordon-Lennox, C. M. S. McLellan's <span class="italic">Leah Kleschna</span>, Ibsen's <span class="italic">Hedda Gabler</span>, and various other plays. In 1911 he played the title role in <span class="italic">Disraeli</span>, a play written for him by Louis Napoleon Parker, which, on stage and screen, served him well and faithfully for many years.<br>
<br>Most of Arliss's best work on the stage was done in America, but in 1923 he returned to London after an absence of twenty-two years, and for over a year at the St James's Theatre he gave a memorable performance of the raja of Rukh in <span class="italic">The Green Goddess</span>. This play by William Archer was an excellent vehicle for Arliss, who in 1928 used it for the first of the remarkable series of biographical (if often historically questionable) films that brought him fame. It was followed by <span class="italic">Disraeli</span> (1929), for which he won an Academy award, and <span class="italic">Old English</span> (1930), from the play by John Galsworthy. Other notable successes were <span class="italic">Voltaire</span> (1933); <span class="italic">The House of Rothschild</span> (1934); <span class="italic">The Iron Duke</span> (1934), his first British film; <span class="italic">Cardinal Richelieu</span> (1935), from the play by Lord Lytton; and <span class="italic">Dr Syn</span> (1937), from the novel by Russell Thorndike, set in Arliss's beloved county of Kent.<br>
<br>Had Arliss been a painter he would probably have been a Pre-Raphaelite or a miniature painter. Louis Parker used to say of him that he could &#145;express more with one finger than most actors can express with their entire bodies&#146;. His work was not cast in a heroic mould. His performance of Shylock was intensely interesting, with a mass of detail, but it lacked the magnificent sweeping breadth of character that Shakespeare gave him: &#145;I have never been able to rise to those great heights&#146;, he said, apropos of Richelieu. But if he could not attain the full stature of some of his characters, his miniature performances were always dignified and thoughtful studies&#151;they could not, however, altogether conceal his very distinctive features and the charm of his voice and personality, which was not assumed. It was this, perhaps, rather than his undoubted talents as a character actor that endeared him to the family audiences for whom his films were made. He received a gold medal for diction from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the honorary degree of MA from Columbia University in 1919, and he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1934.<br>
<br>As a man Arliss was of a rather shy, retiring, and cautious disposition. He was not to be hurried, and although for long he thought of himself as a stage actor and intended to return to the theatre, he found less nervous strain in making films. Arliss was a vegetarian on principle. He was a first-rate player of contract bridge, but his chief recreation was walking, which he loved, especially by the sea. For many years he owned first a cottage and then a house at St Margaret's Bay, Kent, to which he and his wife came regularly every year from America. The house was fortunately untenanted when it was completely destroyed in 1942 by a 15-inch shell fired from the <i>Gneisenau</i> when, with the <i>Scharnhorst</i>, she slipped through the English Channel. Arliss died in London on 5 February 1946.<br>
