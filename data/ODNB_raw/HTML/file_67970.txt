<span class="headword">Notari,  Angelo</span>  (1566&#150;1663), <span class="occ">composer</span>, was born in Padua, Italy, on 14 January 1566 (according to his horoscope in BL, Sloane MS 1707). All that is known of his life in Italy is that he was a member of the Accademia degli Sprovisti of Venice (which had the nickname Il Negligente) and contributed a piece to Nicolo Legname's <span class="italic">Libro dei canzonette</span> (1608). Notari arrived in England some time before 1612, when he was listed as one of Prince Henry's musicians at the time of his death; from 1618 he was likewise in the service of Prince Charles.<br>
<br>Notari must have played an important part in introducing Italian music to England in the early years of the seventeenth century. His <span class="italic">Prime musiche nuove</span>, engraved by William Hole in London and dedicated to the earl of Somerset (dated 24 November 1613), contains examples of the various advanced styles current in Italy at the time, such as monody, strophic variation, canzonetta, and chamber duet, but not madrigal. The preface (in English) refers to the <i>trillo</i> as &#145;a kinde of sweetnes in your voice&#146;, which suggests tremolo or vibrato. Over and above his work as a composer, he was also an important copyist of Italian music by Monteverdi and others (BL, Add. MS 31440; parts of Christ Church, Oxford, MSS 878&#150;880). Some of the anonymous pieces in these manuscripts may be by Notari himself; otherwise virtually nothing by him is known other than his published work.<br>
<br>Notari's name crops up in the state papers between 1621 and 1623 as a suspected spy for Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador. He was a known Catholic and sang at mass in the ambassador's chapel on Christmas day 1622. Following Charles's accession in 1625 he was named among the king's &#145;lutes and voices&#146;, and continued as such until 1639, when his name no longer appears on the list.<br>
<br>During the interregnum Notari may have travelled on the continent, but at the Restoration he was reappointed to his old position, assisted by Henry Purcell the elder, who eventually succeeded him. He died a few weeks short of his ninety-eighth birthday and was buried in St Martin-in-the-Fields on 26 December 1663.<br>
