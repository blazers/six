<span class="headword">Harriman, Sir  George William</span>  (1908&#150;1973), <span class="occ">motor vehicle manufacturer</span>, was born in Coventry on 3 March 1908, the son of George Harriman, a motor machinist, and his wife, May Victoria, formerly Cooper. At the age of fifteen and a half he became an apprentice at the Hotchkiss works, Gosford Street, where his father was a general foreman. This factory was taken over in May 1923 by William Morris for the manufacture of engines; it was, at this time, an important centre of innovation in production engineering. Frank Woollard, who became Morris's manager there, enhanced the existing capabilities of the workshops by reorganizing the flow of work. Within a few months he raised weekly engine production from fewer than 300 units to 1200. By 1924 the factory was making 2000 engines per week, with only limited extensions of the work space and labour force  (Lewchuk, 167&#150;70). During his apprenticeship Harriman made the acquaintance of Leonard Lord, who was then working in the drawing office. By 1938 Harriman was assistant works manager at the new Courthouse Green engine works in Coventry.<br>
<br>Two years later Harriman followed Lord to the Longbridge, Birmingham, works of Austin, where he became machine shop superintendent responsible for engine production. During the early part of the war he worked closely with Lord, who had been appointed as government controller of Boulton and Paul Aircraft Ltd, to expedite production of Defiant night fighters. For this work Harriman was appointed OBE in 1943. In the following year he became production manager at Austins.<br>
<br>In 1948 Harriman accompanied Lord on a visit to the United States, where he developed a broader appreciation of American production methods. Under his direction Austins pioneered in Britain the introduction of automated transfer machines for engine manufacture. An innovative assembly building, designed by an American architect, was opened at Longbridge in 1951. Harriman's role in the company was recognized by his appointment as general works manager in 1945 (with a seat on the board), and his elevation to deputy managing director in 1950 and deputy chairman in 1952.<br>
<br>When Austin and Morris merged to form the British Motor Corporation (BMC) in February 1952, Harriman's responsibilities expanded. He was very successful in rationalizing engine production and to a lesser extent the range of models built. The total volume of output was raised from 279,000 in 1952&#150;3 to 656,000 in 1959&#150;60 with only a modest increase in factory space, labour force, and capital investment. Harriman was appointed deputy chairman and joint managing director of BMC in 1956.<br>
<br>When Sir Leonard Lord retired as chairman and managing director in 1961, Harriman was the obvious successor. Over the next five years BMC's production base was extended by new factory development such as the new truck and tractor plant in Bathgate, Scotland, opened in 1961, and by acquisitions such as the Pressed Steel Company in 1965 and Jaguar in the following year. Harriman became chairman of British Motor Holdings Ltd (BMH), formed in 1966 and the fourteenth largest industrial corporation outside the USA. With assets of &pound;210 million, 114,000 employees, 32 factories worldwide, and some 6000 dealers, the new organization had a production capacity of 1.1 million vehicles. In addition to making cars, trucks, and tractors, BMH also made buses, fork-lift trucks, and domestic appliances.<br>
<br>The enlarged corporation had, however, many inherent points of weakness. The 1966&#150;7 financial results showed a loss of &pound;3.2 million, partly a result of the costs of the merger but, more seriously, a reflection of declining productivity and profitability. Future product development was limited. As later critics have noted, there were no real successors to the innovative Mini and 1100/1300 range designed by Alec Issigonis in the late 1950s. A strategy for the European market was only in the early stages with the development of small assembly operations in Belgium, Italy, and Spain.<br>
<br>BMH, in common with other British motor manufacturers, was being undermined by more volatile conditions in the industry especially in labour relations, annual sales, and worldwide export competition. Informal talks between Leyland and BMC about a possible merger had started as early as 1964 but, except for some limited joint ventures overseas, nothing happened. A dinner for Donald Stokes of Leyland and Harriman, hosted by the prime minister, Harold Wilson, at Chequers in October 1967, moved the merger discussions closer to a climax. Final terms were agreed in January 1968 and the formation of the British Leyland Motor Corporation was announced the following month. Harriman became the first chairman but his influence was limited, as Leyland men and outside appointments dominated. In 1969 Stokes took over the chairmanship and Harriman became honorary president. Until his retirement aged sixty-five, in March 1973, Harriman had a very minor role in the direction of the company.<br>
<br>As a key figure in the post-war British motor industry, Harriman was essentially a production engineer, at his best grappling with the problems of engineering, factory layout, and vehicle production. He was adept at expanding output with fairly minimal capital investment, a policy which worked well in the 1950s but one which compromised the future possibilities of higher productivity and profits. In the company Harriman was well liked by fellow executives and workers on the shop floor.<br>
<br>Harriman was important in modernizing the firms created by the first generation of motor magnates, Austin and Morris, but he was less comfortable in the new era of corporate administration where larger strategies in finance, marketing, and organized research were critical. While BMC managed to retain a home market share of about 38 per cent from the early 1950s to the mid-1960s, the merger of the original Austin and Morris interests was never completed. Both companies retained separate boards of directors and books until 1966 and separate lines of dealers were retained until even later. The informal methods of BMC in administration, precise costing of vehicles, and market research contrasted with the rigorous organization of Ford.<br>
<br>Most of Harriman's working life was spent as a company executive. His wider contribution to the British motor industry was recognized by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which he served as president in 1967&#150;9. He was made CBE in 1951 and was knighted in 1965 for services to exports. In his earlier years he was an active sportsman and later found relaxation in golf and trout fishing. He never lived far from the factories he managed, first in Coventry, then for many years in Solihull and latterly in the nearby village of Knowle. Harriman was very reticent about his private life; all that is recorded is that he was survived by a widow and one daughter (Josephine Marie). He died at his home, Dial House, Chadwick End, Knowle, of cardiac failure, on 29 May 1973.<br>
