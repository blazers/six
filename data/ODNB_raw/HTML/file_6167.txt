<span class="headword">Cooke,  Henry</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1672), <span class="occ">singer, composer, and choirmaster</span>, was &#145;bred up&#146; in the Chapel Royal according to Anthony Wood, but Joseph Bridge's suggestion that his father was John Cooke of the chapel, formerly a vicar-choral at Lichfield, is speculative. Cooke joined the royalist army in the civil wars; it is uncertain whether he was the Lieutenant Henry Cooke of Colonel George Goring's regiment in 1640, but if he was it must be doubtful whether he could, as sometimes stated, have been the Henry Cooke who in 1642 scratched his name on a window in the Jerusalem chamber at Westminster. He reached the rank of captain, and retained the title; the will of the musician Thomas Ford, in which he was forgiven a debt, shows that he was using it by 1648.<br>
<br>Cooke was in London by 1651, when John Playford listed him in <span class="italic">A Musicall Banquet</span> among teachers &#145;For the Voyce or Viole&#146;. A letter of 1656 from the musician George Jeffreys indicates that Cooke's pupils included the children of Christopher, first Baron Hatton, whose principal residence was Kirby Hall in Northamptonshire. Hatton's ownership of much Italian music may have helped to familiarize Cooke with the Italian style; John Evelyn's diary entry for 28 October 1654 describes him as &#145;the best singer, after the <i>Italian</i> manner, of any in <i>England</i>&#146;, an opinion endorsed in the 1664 edition of Playford's <span class="italic">Introduction to the Skill of Musick</span>. Another influence may have been Walter Porter, a member of the Chapel Royal before the wars, who visited Italy and claimed an association with Monteverdi. In 1656 Cooke provided some of the music for two stage works by William D'Avenant, <span class="italic">The First Days Entertainment at Rutland-House</span> and <span class="italic">The Siege of Rhodes</span>, singing the part of Solyman in the second&#151;a performance remembered well enough for Mrs Coleman to impersonate it for Samuel Pepys on 31 October 1665. Pepys's view, recorded on 13 February 1667, was that Cooke was &#145;a vain coxcomb&#146;, although &#145;as to voice and manner, the best I ever heard yet; and a strange mastery he hath in making of extraordinary surprizing closes, that are mighty pretty&#146;. In spite of a distaste for Cooke's bragging, Pepys was often in his company, and in 1664 employed one of his choristers, Tom Edwards, as a musical servant.<br>
<br>At the Restoration in 1660 Cooke became a gentleman of the Chapel Royal and one of the musicians for the lutes and voices, receiving additional payments for training two singing boys in the private musick. On 29 June he was sworn in as master of the children of the Chapel Royal, with responsibility for enlisting and training choirboys and seeing that they were fed, clothed, cared for, and taught to read and write Latin and play instruments. Cooke travelled throughout England to recruit boys at intervals for the rest of his life, with authority from January 1661 to impress them. The necessity appears in Matthew Locke's statement, in <span class="italic">The Present Practice of Musick Vindicated</span> (1673), that for over a year after the chapel was reopened cornetts and men singing falsetto were substituted for boys' voices, &#145;there being not one Lad, for all that time, capable of Singing his part readily&#146;. Cooke's duties were carried out with vigour and patent success, but in the face of financial difficulties that began as early as October 1661. By 1668 the boys' clothes were &#145;so worn out that they keep within doors&#146;, and Cooke was called before the privy council. It was not until 1670 that the king resolved to have the boys clothed &#145;as formerly&#146;, and Cooke agreed to arrange a loan for the purpose.<br>
<br>Cooke was among the composers who provided the chapel with a new repertory, writing some thirty anthems, nearly all of the verse type, and other devotional pieces. Most of these are lost. Pepys commented favourably on anthems by Cooke on 12 August 1660 (when Cooke himself sang) and the following 7 October. Ashmole noted Cooke's part in composing and performing music for the St George's feast at Windsor on 17 April 1661; and on 23 April Cooke and his choristers were at Charles II's coronation in Westminster Abbey, when three of his anthems were performed. On Sunday 14 September 1662 Pepys heard &#145;Cookes new Musique&#146; and wrote:<blockquote>This the first day of having Vialls and other Instruments to play a Symphony between every verse of the Anthem; but the Musique more full than it was the last Sunday, and very fine it is. But yet I could discern Captain Cooke to overdo his part at singing, which I never did before.</blockquote>Cooke's surviving anthems show no great gift for composition, but they are carefully tailored to the resources at his disposal, and contain innovations, afterwards developed by younger men, in the independence of instrumental passages, contrasting scorings, and the disposition of performers within the chapel. Cooke wrote four undistinguished court odes and also a handful of songs and catches, of which four were published in <span class="italic">Catch that Catch Can</span> (1667).<br>
<br>In 1663 Cooke successfully petitioned the king for an augmentation of the pay of the gentlemen and children of the chapel, and in the same year was chosen as a steward of the annual chapel feast. From early in 1663 he signed orders as deputy marshall of the Corporation of Musick, a society composed of royal musicians and claiming wide powers to regulate professional music-making; he was one of four members deputed on 31 May 1664 to attend a fruitless meeting with musicians of the City of London, who claimed similar powers. Cooke afterwards became marshall, probably in 1666 (when there is a gap in the records), following the death of Nicholas Lanier. Before that, in August 1664, he had obtained a further official appointment as a composer in the private musick.<br>
<br>Little is known of Cooke's family. His wife was named Mary and brought him land at Pluckley, in Kent; a daughter of the same name predeceased him. In 1672 his daughter Katherine married his pupil <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14154/', "Pelham Humfrey")</script>, who became master of the children on Cooke's death but died in 1674; Katherine's second husband was named Darcey. A third daughter, Amey, was married first to Bartholomew Tothill and then to Arthur Browne. Cooke's will suggests residence at both Westminster and Hampton. His Westminster house may have been in Little Sanctuary, where &#145;Widow Cooke&#146; lived after his death. In 1669 he had lodgings at &#145;the further end&#146; of the old bowling alley at Hampton Court, which in 1671 it was decided to demolish.<br>
<br>On 24 June 1672 Cooke asked to be replaced as marshall of the Corporation of Musick because of illness, and on 6 July he made his will; he added a codicil a few days afterwards. Most of his possessions were left to the members of his family. The will disposed of his house in Westminster, a house and land at Hampton, his land at Pluckley, and houses in Longditch, Westminster, a street in which people named Cooke lived, though it is not known whether they were related to him. He also left plate and jewellery, 120 pieces of gold, and well over &pound;1000 owed to him in wages and allowances. Cooke died on 13 July 1672, presumably at Westminster, and was buried on 17 July close to his daughter Mary in the east cloister of Westminster Abbey, &#145;near the steps&#146;. His widow, who he wished to be buried near him, made her will on 16 March 1696; it was proved on 16 June by her daughter Katherine.<br>
