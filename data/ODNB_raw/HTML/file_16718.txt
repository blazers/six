<span class="headword">Lindsay,  William</span>  (1802&#150;1866), <span class="occ">minister of the United Presbyterian church</span>, was born in Irvine, Ayrshire. He studied at Glasgow University and attended the Relief Theological Hall in Paisley from its opening in 1824, before he was ordained minister of the new East Church, Johnstone, Renfrewshire, on 27 April 1830. He was translated to Dovehill Relief Church, Glasgow, on 22 November 1832, where he served as colleague and successor to John Barr (<i>d</i>. 1839), though he was effectively in sole charge from the outset due to Barr's incapacity. At the Relief Synod of 1841 Lindsay was appointed to his church's chair of exegetical theology and biblical criticism. He was honoured with the degree of DD from Glasgow University in 1844 and in December of that year he transferred, with his congregation, to a new building in Cathedral Street, Glasgow. Though seldom prominent in public matters, Lindsay delivered a memorable address at the union of the Relief and United Secession churches in 1847. He became professor of biblical criticism and sacred languages in the new denomination, his duties overlapping with those of John Eadie. After the death of John Brown in 1858 Lindsay held the chair of exegetical theology.<br>
<br>A contemporary described Lindsay as &#145;about the middle size and habit. His countenance is fresh and ruddy, and indicates placidity, benevolence and kindness. His small, dark eyes look from beneath a prominent brow, surmounted by a plentiful supply of greyish hair&#146;  (Smith, 111). By nature he was sensitive and retiring, living very much in his study. As a professor he was popular, esteemed for his exemplary character and soundness rather than for any brilliance. As a preacher, his sermons were edifying without ever attracting crowds. He published a number of works, including a life of Thomas Gillespie and a small volume on relationships which bar marriage. His most substantial work, <span class="italic">Lectures on the Epistle to the Hebrews</span> (1867), was edited by George Brooks, in two volumes, after his death.<br>
<br>Lindsay appeared to be in normal health, and had preached twice earlier in the day, when he collapsed and died of heart disease at his home, 33 Monteith Row, Glasgow, on 3 June 1866. He was buried in a family grave at Irvine on 7 June.<br>
