<span class="headword">Lincoln,  Ignatius Timotheus Trebitsch</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Ign&aacute;cz Trebitsch; <em>name in religion </em>Chao Kung]</span>  (1879&#150;1943), <span class="occ">political adventurer</span>, was born in Paks, Hungary, on 4 April 1879, the second son of Nathan Trebitsch (<i>d</i>. 1899), a merchant, and his wife, Julia, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Freund (<i>fl</i>. 1870&#150;1920). He was educated in the Jewish elementary school in Paks and at a secondary school in Budapest. In 1895&#150;6 he enrolled in the Royal Hungarian Academy of Dramatic Art but left Hungary before completing his course after being accused of stealing a gold watch. He travelled to England and Germany where he fell in with missionaries and, in 1899, was converted from his native Judaism to Christianity, being baptized Ignatius Timotheus Trebitsch. After studying at a Lutheran seminary at Breklum in Schleswig-Holstein, in 1900 he moved to Montreal where he worked as a missionary to the Jews, initially for the Presbyterian church, later for the Anglican Church of Canada. In July 1901 he married Margarethe Kahlor (<i>b</i>. <i>c</i>.1877, <i>d</i>. after 1948), daughter of a German sea captain, with whom he had four sons.<br>
<br>In 1903 Trebitsch returned to England and served briefly as a curate in Appledore, Kent. After failing an examination for the priesthood in April 1904, and squandering his wife's inheritance, he was engaged early in 1906 by the philanthropist Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree as an assistant. He gathered sociological information for Rowntree's book <span class="italic">Land and Labour: Lessons from Belgium</span> (1911), which involved numerous visits to the continent. He quickly ingratiated himself with Rowntree who, being much impressed, deployed his influence in the Liberal Party to secure Trebitsch's nomination as candidate for the parliamentary seat of Darlington. Meanwhile Trebitsch took the surname Lincoln by deed poll on 11 October 1904 (and was known as Tribich Lincoln or I. T. T. Lincoln) and speedily secured British naturalization, on 5 May 1909. In the general election of January 1910 he campaigned on a platform of free trade and won an upset victory by a majority of twenty-nine votes. His first speech in the House of Commons, on 23 February 1910, earned him only ridicule, and his parliamentary career was short and undistinguished. In the election of December 1910 he was compelled to withdraw his candidacy, owing to financial difficulties. The following month he admitted to a creditors' meeting in York that he was insolvent.<br>
<br>With large subventions from Rowntree he nevertheless embarked on a business career, floating a series of public companies to exploit Galician and Romanian oil. He raised large sums on the London stock exchange to finance these enterprises. One after another, they collapsed and by the summer of 1914 he was down and out in London. Upon the outbreak of the First World War he offered his services as a double agent to the British naval intelligence bureau, headed by Captain Reginald Hall. Rejected by the British, he turned to the Germans who engaged him to send reports on shipping activity in British ports. In 1915, fearing arrest, he abandoned his family and fled to the USA where he published embroidered accounts of his exploits as an &#145;international spy&#146;. He was arrested, escaped, was recaptured and, after failing in an appeal to the US supreme court, was extradited to Britain in 1916. Tried for fraud at the central criminal court in July 1916, he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison.<br>
<br>Released in August 1919, Lincoln was deported and his British naturalization rescinded. He quickly insinuated himself into German nationalist circles in Berlin, and in March 1920 served as &#145;director of foreign press affairs&#146; in the short-lived militarist government of Wolfgang Kapp. After the collapse of the Kapp <i>Putsch</i> he fled to Munich and devoted the next two years to complex intrigues with right-wingers in Budapest, Prague, and Vienna. He was indicted for high treason in Vienna but the charge was dropped. Deported from Austria in 1921, he wandered to China, where he spent most of the rest of his life.<br>
<br>From 1923 to 1925 he acted as an arms dealer and political adviser to several warlords in northern China. In 1925 he converted to Buddhism, took the Chinese name Chao Kung, adopted oriental garb, shaved his head, and after six years of meditation and religious study was ordained a monk and raised to the rank of Bodhisattva. He established his own monastery in Shanghai to which he attracted a small flock of European Buddhist monks and nuns. During the Second World War he earned a meagre living as a low-level agent for Japanese and German intelligence agencies in Shanghai. He died at the general hospital in Shanghai on 6 October 1943, ostensibly as a result of a stomach ailment. Some evidence suggests that he was murdered by the Shanghai Gestapo. His wife, from whom he had separated in 1925, outlived him.<br>
<br>Endowed with considerable linguistic facility and personal magnetism, Lincoln was an unscrupulous confidence trickster who ruined the lives of many of those with whom he came into close contact. Subject to swift changes of mood, he exhibited symptoms of manic depression. He was the only person ever to have been formally adopted by a major British political party as a parliamentary candidate while still a Hungarian citizen; he was also the only former British MP ever to serve as a member of a German government. A shameless self-promoter, he wrote a readable but unreliable account of his early life, <span class="italic">Autobiography of an Adventurer</span> (1932), as well as several other books, mainly on Buddhist themes. He was buried in the Buddhist section of a municipal cemetery in Shanghai.<br>
