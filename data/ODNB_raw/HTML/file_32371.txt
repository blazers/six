<span class="headword">Charlesworth,  Martin Percival</span>  (1895&#150;1950), <span class="occ">classical scholar</span>, was born at Eastham, Cheshire, on 18 January 1895, son of the Revd Ambrose Charlesworth (1863&#150;1921), then curate of Eastham, and his wife, Alice Whish. He was educated at Birkenhead School and at Jesus College, Cambridge, of which he was a Rustat scholar, and was awarded university scholarships, the Bell (1915), Stewart of Rannoch (1916), and, after service in the First World War, mainly in the Middle East as a commissioned officer in the labour corps, the Craven (1920). He was first chancellor's medallist in 1921. After being placed in the first division of the first class in the classical tripos, part one (1920), and in the first class in part two in 1921 with distinction in ancient history, he became visiting fellow at Princeton (1921&#150;2). He was a fellow of Jesus College (1921), and became fellow and lecturer at St John's (1923), and tutor in 1925, an office which he held until, in 1931, he was appointed to the Laurence readership in classics (ancient history) in the university. He had been a university lecturer on the subject since 1926.<br>
<br>Charlesworth first made his name by a Hare prize essay, <span class="italic">The Trade Routes and Commerce of the Roman Empire</span> (1922, published 1924; 2nd edn, 1926), which enjoyed a high reputation and was translated into French and Italian. In 1927 he was appointed an editor of the <span class="italic">Cambridge Ancient History</span>, to which he rendered great services until its completion twelve years later. His contributions to volumes 8, 10, and 11 displayed skill in handling evidence, a sympathetic while penetrating assessment of individuals, and an easy, vigorous style. This was especially apparent in his treatment of Tiberius, Claudius, and the Flavians. In 1935 he delivered the Martin lectures at Oberlin College, Ohio, on notable figures in the empire, published under the title of <span class="italic">Five Men</span> (1936). He was interested in the interpretation of the ideas revealed in coin-types, linked with literary evidence, and in the complex of practices known as the imperial cult. He was aware of continental scholarship, translating V. Parvan's <span class="italic">Dacia</span> in 1928 and exchanging offprints with Stefan Weinstock before the latter's arrival in Britain. But his writings are marked neither by original insights and new directions for research nor by major works of scholarship comparable to those produced in Germany in the nineteenth century. He was also interested in Romano-British studies; the last book he lived to publish was the Gregynog lectures of 1948, <span class="italic">The Lost Province, or, The Worth of Britain</span> (1949). While he was well-versed in ancient history, his especial field was the Roman empire, of which his skilful survey in the <span class="roman">Home University Library</span>, <span class="italic">Rome</span> (1947), was passed for press during his last illness. His <span class="italic">Documents Illustrating the Reigns of Claudius and Nero</span> (1939) was the first of such sourcebooks.<br>
<br>Besides his activity as a historian, both as writer and lecturer, Charlesworth devoted himself to St John's, which repaid his services with affection and admiration. This was attested by his election by the fellows as president in 1937, an office in which he revealed high social gifts. He had very many friends throughout the university and among scholars, so that his untimely death at the General Infirmary, Leeds, on 26 October 1950, following a heart attack, was widely lamented. In 1940 he had taken holy orders, and, although he desired no ecclesiastical preferment, he was a devoted churchman. He was an active president of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies (1945&#150;8), fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and fellow (1940) and member of the council (1948) of the British Academy. In 1947 he received the honorary degrees of DLitt from the University of Wales and D-&egrave;s-L from Bordeaux. He was unmarried.<br>
