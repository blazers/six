<span class="headword">Berkeley,  Randal Thomas Mowbray Rawdon</span>, eighth earl of Berkeley  (1865&#150;1942), <span class="occ">physical chemist and landowner</span>, was born on 31 January 1865 at Ixelles, Brussels, the third son&#151;but the only one born after his parents' marriage&#151;of George Lennox Rawdon Berkeley (1827&#150;1888) and his wife, C&eacute;cile (<i>d</i>. 1914), daughter of Edward Drummond, count of Melfort, in the French nobility, and divorced wife of Admiral Sir F. B. R. Pellew (1789&#150;1861). He assumed the courtesy title Viscount Dursley in 1882, when his father took the title of seventh earl of Berkeley on the death of his cousin, Thomas Moreton Fitzhardinge Berkeley, who by a family arrangement had not used the earldom to which he was entitled. On his father's death in 1888 Viscount Dursley assumed the title of eighth earl of Berkeley and in 1891 his right to the peerage was established.<br>
<br>Berkeley's parents lived abroad and he was educated in France before moving to England to be coached for the Royal Navy at Burney's academy, Gosport. In 1878 he joined the cadet training ship <i>Britannia</i> berthed at Dartmouth. From 1880 to 1887 he served in various ships, including a period on the China station, and also attended the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. While he was in the navy his interest in science and mathematics was stimulated, particularly by books he was lent by a chaplain in one of the ships on which he served. In 1887, finding naval discipline irksome, he resigned his commission in order to devote himself to science. The same year, on 9 November, he married Kate (<i>d</i>. 1898), daughter of William Brand, a landowner, and widow of Arthur Jackson, a composer and teacher at the Royal Academy of Music.<br>
<br>Berkeley studied chemistry for a short time at the Royal College of Science and also attended lectures in other subjects, including geology. A lecture on petrography aroused in him an interest in crystals and he began to study the relationship between crystalline form and chemical composition. However, a serious illness put an end to his work in London. In 1893 he moved to Foxcombe near Oxford and resumed his crystallographic work in the Christ Church laboratory, work which led to two short papers on the accurate determination of the densities of solids. (Real understanding of the relationship between crystalline form and chemical composition had to await the advent of X-ray crystallography.) In 1897, in association with Ernald Hartley, Berkeley conducted research into the electrolysis of glass. No publication resulted, but this work apparently turned Berkeley's attention to semi-permeable membranes and hence to osmotic pressure.<br>
<br>Berkeley built a private laboratory at Foxcombe in 1898 and began researches on the measurement of osmotic pressure. The work began in earnest in 1902 when he was joined by Hartley (who was his collaborator until 1916). At that time physical chemists were interested in the deviations of real solutions from the osmotic pressure equation of Van't Hoff (analogous to the ideal gas equation) and the possibility of expressing these by an equation similar to the van der Waals equation used for real gases. First, however, there were major difficulties to be overcome in order to obtain accurate experimental results; this was the goal Berkeley set himself.<br>
<br>Berkeley and Hartley designed and built an apparatus incorporating a semi-permeable membrane which was capable of measuring accurately osmotic pressures up to 150 atmospheres. They also measured osmotic pressures by the so-called indirect method, based on the lowering of the vapour pressure of a solvent by a solute. Initially there were considerable discrepancies between the results given by the two methods, but these were gradually reduced, almost to zero, by refinements of technique and the discovery and application of necessary corrections. Although much effort was also expended in trying to express the results by equations of the van der Waals type, with the benefit of hindsight it is apparent that such attempts were doomed.<br>
<br>Over the years additional workers were recruited to Foxcombe and the study of solutions was broadened to include diffusion and centrifugation, and there were further opportunities for constructing ingenious apparatus. However, August 1914 marked the start of the decline of the Foxcombe laboratory, as the team Berkeley had assembled dispersed to war work.<br>
<br>During the war years Berkeley himself acquired another interest: on the death of his kinsman Lord Fitzhardinge in 1916 he succeeded to the Berkeley estates in Gloucestershire. The castle was in a neglected state and he threw himself energetically into its restoration, acting as his own architect and clerk of works. But he never lost his interest in osmotic pressure and related phenomena; some research continued at Foxcombe throughout the war and the laboratory did not finally close until 1928. Even after the laboratory closed Berkeley was seeking new equations to express his old experimental results.<br>
<br>Berkeley was not prominent in the life of the scientific community, but he was elected FRS in 1908 and served on the council of the Chemical Society from 1914 to 1918. For many years his main interest outside science was golf, and he laid out a nine-hole golf course at Foxcombe. In 1936 he published <span class="italic">Sound Golf by Applying Principles to Practice</span>. On inheriting the Berkeley estates he became master of the Berkeley hounds; he took up hunting when he was over fifty and continued in the sport until 1927. On 8 November 1924 he married his second wife, Mrs Mary Emlen Lloyd (<i>d</i>. 1975), daughter of John Lowell of Boston, Massachusetts; they spent much time in California and in Italy. Berkeley died peacefully in his sleep at Berkeley Castle on 15 January 1942. There were no children by either marriage and the earldom of Berkeley ended with him.<br>
