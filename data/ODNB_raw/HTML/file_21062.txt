<span class="headword">Ozell,  John</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1743), <span class="occ">translator</span>, was the son of John Ozell. Little is known about his parents. His father was said to be from a Leicestershire family, of French origin. Ozell was educated at the free school in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and then at Christ's Hospital, after which it was expected that he would go to Cambridge, and become a clergyman. However, he decided instead to enter business and he moved to London where he joined an accountant's office. He was successful in this, and managed several important accounts, including those of the City of London, St Paul's Church, and St Thomas's Hospital.<br>
<br>While Ozell was working as an accountant he taught himself a number of foreign languages, which, together with the classical languages he had learned at school, enabled him to undertake the series of translations of foreign classics for which he is chiefly known. Some of the most significant translations that he produced were his versions of Boileau. In 1708 he translated his <span class="italic">Le Lutrin</span>, and between 1711 and 1713 he published an edition, <span class="italic">The Works of Monsieur Boileau</span> (translated by Ozell and others), both of which were influential in introducing the French author's works to an English-speaking public at this time. Like many translators of this period, Ozell's treatment of the texts that he was working on was a free one, in which he continually expanded upon the original. Thus he used Boileau's account of the &#145;battle of the books&#146; in the <span class="italic">Lutrin</span> to comment upon contemporary English writers.<br>
<br>The attack on William Wycherley's poetry included in this translation brought Ozell into conflict with the influential group of Scriblerian writers. Alexander Pope was a friend of Wycherley's, and at this time he was engaged in editing and revising the older writer's <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems</span>. He immediately responded to Ozell in his &#145;Epigram, Occasion'd by Ozell's Translation of Boileau's Lutrin&#146;, written in 1708, in which he claimed that &#145;those were slander'd most whom Ozell prais'd&#146;  (<span class="italic">Minor Poems</span>, 6.37). Ozell continued to be lampooned as the epitome of the hack translator in both Pope's <span class="italic">Dunciad</span> and Jonathan Swift's &#145;Introduction to Polite Conversation&#146;. Yet although he was mocked for his literary incompetence, his translations were not only good by the standards of the time, but also useful to Pope for his own work on the classics. In 1712 Ozell produced a blank-verse translation of Anne Dacier's French version of Homer's <span class="italic">Iliad</span>, and Pope borrowed from this heavily when he began to publish his own famous <span class="italic">Iliad</span> translation three years later.<br>
<br>Part of the tory Scriblerians' hostility to Ozell may have been due to his political affiliations. He seems to have been associated with the group of whig writers such as Eustace Budgell and Ambrose Philips, who centred around Joseph Addison, and &#145;Button's&#146; club, held at Daniel Button's Coffee House in Covent Garden. Ozell's translations certainly suggest that his political views were whiggish. His violent anti-Catholicism is demonstrated in his 1716 translation of the life of the &#145;saint&#146; Veronica of Milan, and in 1717 he published a translation of Rapin de Thoyras's very whiggish <span class="italic">Dissertation sur les Whigs et les Torys</span> of that year (<span class="italic">An Historical Dissertation upon Whig and Tory</span>). Ozell's literary career continued to be marked by literary controversy: in 1728 the Anglican churchman Richard Bundy began to publish a version of F. Catrou's and P. J. Rouill&eacute;'s <span class="italic">Histoire romaine, depuis la fondation de Rome</span> (1725&#150;35), as <span class="italic">Roman History</span>, upstaging Ozell, who had also been planning to release a translation of the text. Ozell responded by publishing a lengthy commentary on the various mistakes and omissions in Bundy's translation. He also issued an advertisement in the newspaper the <span class="italic">Weekly Medley</span>, in which he attacked both Bundy, and his old enemy Pope, whose <span class="italic">Dunciad variorum</span> had appeared that year. In the advertisement he vindicated the reputation of his own scholarship, and claimed that Pope was &#145;that second Cain, whose Hand is against every Body, and every Body's Hand against him&#146;  (<span class="italic">Weekly Medley</span>, 20 Sept 1729).<br>
<br>Ozell never married. At the time of his death he was financially secure, due to his accountancy work and an inheritance that he was left by an old family friend from Leicestershire. He died at his house in Arundel Street in Westminster on 15 October 1743, and was buried in the church of St Mary Aldermanbury, Westminster. He left his estate to his brother, Austin Ozell.<br>
