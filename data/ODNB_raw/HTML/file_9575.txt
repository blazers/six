<span class="headword">Fitzgerald,  Maurice</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Muiris Ruadh]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1268), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, called by the annals of Connacht Muiris Ruadh (&#145;Maurice the red&#146;), was the son of Gerald fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (<i>d</i>. 1242/3), the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9576/', "Maurice Fitzgerald (d. 1257)")</script>, justiciar of Ireland from 1232 to 1245. The identity of his mother and the date of his birth are not known. His father died during, or shortly after, his service on the Gascon expedition of 1242&#150;3. Between 1254 and 1257 his grandfather gave the extensive lands he had himself acquired in Connacht and west Ulster to his second son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9577/', "Maurice fitz Maurice Fitzgerald (d. 1286)")</script>. The grandson was, however, heir to the family lands in Kildare, Offaly, and Limerick, though there seems to have been some doubt about the position of Offaly in 1257, when he was still under age. The careers of the two Maurices, nephew and uncle, are not easy to disentangle, and they have often been confused by historians. In 1264 Maurice the uncle became involved in a bitter dispute with Walter de Burgh, lord of Connacht and Ulster. The Fitzgeralds seized and imprisoned Richard de la Rochelle, the Lord Edward's justiciar of Ireland (who may have been aligned with de Burgh), Theobald Butler, and John de Cogan. This outbreak was appeased by Geoffrey de Geneville, the acting justiciar, in April 1265. According to the Waverley annals, Maurice the nephew was among several barons of Ireland who arrived in England soon after the battle of Evesham (4 August 1265) &#145;to assist the Lord Edward&#146;  (<span class="italic">Ann. mon.</span>, 2.365). The annals go on to say that he was sent with Hamo Lestrange on a sortie against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in the following September. After this he was drawn into court circles through a marriage to Agnes de Valence, the second daughter of William de Valence, lord of Pembroke and Wexford, Henry III's half-brother. In August 1266 at Kenilworth, in a charter witnessed by Maurice the uncle, the Fitzgerald holdings in Limerick were settled jointly on the couple.<br>
<br>Fitzgerald died in July 1268, drowned in the Irish Sea as he was returning to Ireland. His marriage to Agnes appears to have been childless. After his death she married Hugh de Balliol (<i>d</i>. 1271), elder brother of the future king of Scots, and then Jean d'Avesnes, seigneur de Beaumont (<i>d</i>. 1283). Fitzgerald did, however, leave a son and heir, <a name="cosubject_9558"></a><span class="headword">Gerald fitz Maurice Fitzgerald</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1287)<span class="occ"></span>, from an earlier marriage to a wife whose name has not been preserved. Gerald's wardship was granted to Thomas de Clare, who in 1269 sold it to William de Valence for 3500 marks. This Gerald, who married Geoffrey de Geneville's daughter, Joan, was captured in a war against the Irish of Offaly in 1285, and died childless in 1287. His father's sister, Juliana, the wife of John de Cogan, was his closest relative. However, shortly before his death he seems to have granted the castle of Lea and possibly other lands in Kildare and Offaly to his first cousin, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9645/', "John fitz Thomas Fitzgerald (d. 1316)")</script>. John, who was to be created earl of Kildare in 1316, set out to reintegrate the possessions of his grandfather, Maurice Fitzgerald, the justiciar. This process involved complex and acrimonious dealings with Juliana de Cogan, Agnes de Valence, and other heiresses and widows of his kinsmen. In the 1290s it also provoked further contention with the de Burghs, led by Richard de Burgh, earl of Ulster. Possibly it was in connection with this that Agnes de Valence granted the manor of Geashill in Offaly to the earl of Ulster in 1296. Only after her death in 1309&#151;which was followed by litigation over the Limerick lands which she had held in jointure for more than forty years&#151;did her husband's lordships pass fully into the hands of the junior branch of the family.<br>
