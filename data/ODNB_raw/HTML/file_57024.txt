<span class="headword">Abrahams, Sir  Lionel Barnett</span>  (1869&#150;1919), <span class="occ">economist and civil servant</span>, was born in London on 9 December 1869, the only son of Mordecai Abrahams, secretary to the Initiation Society. Educated at the City of London School and Balliol College, Oxford, where he was an exhibitioner between 1892 and 1896 and won the Arnold historical essay prize in 1894, he headed the civil service list in 1893, electing to join the India Office. Marriage to Lucy, daughter of N. S. Joseph, followed in 1896. They had one son. In 1898 Abrahams became secretary to the Indian currency committee, an appointment which brought him into close contact with Indian currency affairs during an eventful period of their history and with which he remained closely associated during the next two decades as assistant financial secretary at the India Office (1901), financial secretary (1902&#150;11), and assistant under-secretary of state for India (1911&#150;17). He also served on departmental committees on Indian railway administration and finance (1907&#150;8) and west African finance (1912), and was a member of the Indian wheat committee (1915).<br>
<br>Known to have been John Maynard Keynes's mentor on Indian finance, Abrahams is rarely spoken of outside the context of the economist's early career. Even the recognition accorded to him by the editor of Keynes's <span class="italic">Collected Writings</span> as the &#145;moulder and manipulator of India's involved but efficient financial system&#146;  (p. 38) does inadequate justice to the wider significance of his contribution. Although the idea derived from David Ricardo, Abrahams was among the first consciously to implement the gold exchange standard, which enabled countries to settle their external accounts in major currencies, helping thereby to reduce their dependence on gold and expand world trade. India became a pioneer of this new system when the rupee was placed on it at the turn of the century, and during the next few years Abrahams perfected the type of management and intervention the gold exchange standard required to make its working mimic the gold standard. According to R. S. Sayers his contributions were also of &#145;high importance in the development of ideas on central banking&#146;, of which he was an early, if somewhat unconventional, exponent. Nor was he loath to advance unorthodox policies such as floating the rupee exchange rate to mitigate the impact of an unstable global environment on the Indian economy. Floating exchange rates too had few supporters when he proposed them in 1919. But both this idea and the gold exchange standard were adopted widely in later years.<br>
<br>Sayers recalls Keynes going &#145;out of his way&#146;, while lecturing in Cambridge in 1928, &#145;to pay tribute to the perception and originality&#146; of Lionel Abrahams. Others, including officials of the government he served with rare ability and imagination during a quarter-century spent at the India Office, and posterity, have however been less generous. His relative anonymity among historians of India too is a puzzle. An answer to this may lie partly in the somewhat technical nature of his achievements and the erroneous view that by the time of his death a few days before his fiftieth birthday they had been undone by the economic shocks of the First World War.<br>
<br>Abrahams was created Companion of the Bath in 1908 and made Knight Commander of the Bath in 1915. The history and social and religious life of his community also engaged his interest. A member at one time of the Jewish Board of Guardians, he contributed to the <span class="italic">Jewish Quarterly Review</span> and was the author of <span class="italic">The Expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290</span>. He also wrote articles entitled &#145;The economic position and influence of Jews in England&#146; and &#145;The exchequer of the Jews&#146; for the <span class="italic">Palgrave Dictionary of Political Economy</span>. He died at his home, 18 Porchester Terrace, Hyde Park, London, on 30 November 1919.<br>
