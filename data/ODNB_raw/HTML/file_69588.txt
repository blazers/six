<span class="headword">Cromwell,  Henry</span>  (1659&#150;1728), <span class="occ">translator and poet</span>, was born on 15 January 1659 at Clifton, Bedfordshire, the second son and third child of Thomas Cromwell (1609&#150;1660), a first cousin of Oliver Cromwell, the lord protector, and Elizabeth Dixie (<i>b</i>. 1627?). It is probable that he was educated at home.<br>
<br>Cromwell owned lands in Beesby, 9 miles south-east of Louth, Lincolnshire, where he sometimes passed the summer months. The rest of the year he spent principally in London, visiting coffee houses, attending the theatre, and playing ombre and piquet in fashionable salons. He also translated Latin poets and wrote his own verse. He contributed a number of amorous songs, and a rendering of Martial (i.67), to Charles Gildon's <span class="italic">Miscellany Poems upon Several Occasions</span> (1692), and versions of half a dozen of Ovid's <span class="italic">Amores</span> (i.7, 8, 10, 15) to <span class="italic">Examen poeticum</span> (1693), the last of which, &#145;Of the Immortality of the Muses&#146;, was &#145;Inscrib'd to Mr. <i>Dryden</i>&#146;  (p. 282). The volume also contains translations of <span class="italic">Amores</span>, iii.2 and 3; a manuscript copy of the latter is to be found in the West papers (BL, Add. MS 34744), where it accompanies an interpretation of <span class="italic">Amores</span>, i.5, in the same hand. And &#145;To his Mistress&#146; and &#145;The Dream&#146;, renderings of <span class="italic">Amores</span>, ii.16 and iii.5, were published in Bernard Lintot's collection <span class="italic">Miscellaneous Poems and Translations</span> (1712), the volume which further contains <span class="italic">The Rape of the Locke</span>, the first edition of that poem. Cromwell is also known to have translated Voiture. His published works, both the translations and original lyrics, reveal a competent, if slightly mechanical, facility for versification.<br>
<br>Womanizing was the other great love of Cromwell's life. Courteously old-fashioned in manner, he was none the less a fashion plate, wearing nosegays, favouring a high, full-bottomed wig, and walking with a mincing step or dancing gait. To an unprepossessing appearance (a long, thin countenance and a sallow complexion: &#145;a Satyr in his Face&#146;, in Wycherley's view) were added &#145;creeping advances, clinging embraces&#146;, as the playwright put it to Pope  (14 June 1709, <span class="italic">Correspondence of Alexander Pope</span>, 1.65), and by Cromwell's own account a thoroughly raffish demeanour: one of his favourite anecdotes recalled his competing with Dryden for the favours of a Drury Lane prostitute. This and suchlike lubricious tales he rehearsed for a younger circle of friends, including Alexander Pope, whom he had met probably through Wycherley, possibly as early as 1705, and a group which comprised Nicholas Rowe, Eustace Budgell, William Fortescue, and John Gay, to whom he was introduced for the first time in the autumn of 1710, on his return from Lincolnshire. (Shortly afterwards, Cromwell was responsible for introducing Gay to Pope.)<br>
<br>For a brief period Cromwell and Pope corresponded on matters literary and carnal. In addition to replies in prose which allowed the young poet to demonstrate, and to apply, his self-education in the ancients, Pope composed verse letters animated by a deal of characterful detail: from &#145;An Epistle to Henry Cromwell, Esq.&#146; (1707), for example, we learn that the recipient was somewhat deaf, was particular in his snuff-taking and penmanship, and kept company with the unheralded poetasters Brocas and Fouler, and the gamester Pentlow. In &#145;Mr Popes Welcome from Greece&#146; (1720), moreover, John Gay imagines &#145;honest, hatless <i>Cromwell</i>, with red breeches&#146;  (1. 136), the source of Johnson's exiguous character of the rou&eacute; in his life of Pope. Cromwell further commented on Pope's translation of Statius, and his is probably the hand which supplies a marginal commentary of approving and monitory Latin exclamations, and the occasional note drawing attention to departures from Ovid's model, to the autograph of Pope's rendering of <span class="italic">Sapho to Phaon</span> (<i>c</i>.1707; published 1712). The annotations show Cromwell to be a scrupulous critic attentive to the nicest points of grammar. That a scurrilous epigram alluding to him appears on the verso of the Ovid manuscript exemplifies the cooling of his friendship with Pope, probably but not certainly to be attributed to Cromwell's increasing association with John Dennis, of whom he was to become a long-term friend and admirer, but who was one of Pope's most persistent literary enemies. Cromwell and Pope remained casual friends after 1711, but ceased to correspond.<br>
<br>From about 1717 Cromwell appears to have curtailed his metropolitan socializing; throughout his life Epsom was a favourite resort. In 1726, however, he returned to public attention when Edmund Curll, another of Pope's long-standing literary adversaries, published the poet's youthful, unguarded correspondence with Cromwell, embarrassing letters he had obtained from Elizabeth Thomas. Thomas was (and has continued to be) referred to in print as Cromwell's mistress&#151;when she is not remembered as &#145;Curll's Corinna&#146;, Pope's scatological revenge on her in <span class="italic">The Dunciad Variorum</span> (1729), <span class="smallcap">II</span>.66&#151;but eighteenth-century senses of the term have been apt to mislead: a literary-minded gentlewoman living with her widowed mother and grandmother in impoverished but respectable circumstances, Thomas had been a friend of Cromwell, but nothing more intimate, perhaps since 1700. He paid court to her, shared Pope's writings with her after 1708, and introduced her to the poet, who esteemed her as a free-spirited literary friend. Thomas pestered Cromwell to be allowed to keep the letters he had shown her, and which she continued to hold, regarding them as relics, or prizes, of her acquaintance with the poet, in which request he eventually acquiesced. He forgot the affair as they drifted apart after 1717; he was reminded of the autographs, and his part in their dissemination, only when he learned that Thomas, indigent after the deaths of her mother and fianc&eacute;, had sold the letters to Curll, who published them in a two-volume collection, <span class="italic">Miscellanea</span> (1726), together with a handful of his uncollected verses. If Pope replied to the two mortified letters Cromwell appears to have addressed to him (but which are known only from the poet's published correspondence), the dispatches have not survived.<br>
<br>It is probable that Pope and Cromwell had no further contact. For a short time, at the beginning of Pope's literary career, the friendship and exacting criticism of Cromwell, a man nearly thirty years his senior, whose other pursuits earned him a reputation as a &#145;<i>louche boulevardier</i>&#146;  (Nokes, 53), fulfilled an important need; later, already alienated by Cromwell's association with Dennis, Pope dropped him as his confidence in his abilities, and his fame, grew. Cromwell died on 29 June 1728 and was buried in London at St Clement Danes, on the Strand, as he had requested in his will.<br>
