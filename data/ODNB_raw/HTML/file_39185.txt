<span class="headword">Tate <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Hogg; <em>other married name </em>Gott]</span>,  Mavis Constance</span>  (1893&#150;1947), <span class="occ">politician and feminist</span>, was born Maybird Constance on 17 August 1893, the daughter (there was also a son) of Guy Weir Hogg (1861&#150;1943), sheriff of St Helena and managing director of Solomon, Hogg &amp; Co., and his wife, Constance Piercy Marsden (<i>d</i>. 1920). She was educated privately and at St Paul's Girls' School, London. She married, on 9 August 1915, Gerald Ewart Gott (1892/3&#150;1966), a captain in the Bedfordshire regiment, son of George Arthur Gott of Will Hall, Alton, Hampshire. This wartime marriage, of which there were no children, ended in divorce in 1925. That year (22 August 1925) she made a second marriage, to Henry Burton Tate (<i>b</i>. 1883/4), also a divorcee, of independent means, the son of Henry Tate, also of independent means. His previous marriage to Ida Guendolen Legge had ended in divorce in 1925. In 1930 she rejected her original first name, Maybird, and adopted Mavis by deed poll.<br>
<br>Like many women of her class and generation Mavis Tate was not originally a feminist, but during the 1920s she took advantage of the many changes in British society and politics to extend her interests beyond the purely conventional. At this time her recreations included not only gardening and reading but also flying, a subject on which she later became a political authority. She served as a JP for Middlesex. In March 1931 she contested a London county council seat at Islington, and then stood for the West Willesden parliamentary constituency as a National Conservative at the general election in October 1931. Though this was not a Conservative constituency, the landslide victory won by the National Government swept her into parliament.<br>
<br>As a back-bencher Tate spoke frequently on a wide range of subjects, refusing to be confined to the domestic topics then considered appropriate for female politicians. For example, she took an interest in overseas trade, which led her to criticize the government for failing to gain preference for manufacturers of sugar refining machinery in the Ottawa agreements in 1932. Above all, she made well-informed speeches on civil aviation, and she anticipated the failure of the disarmament convention by urging an acceleration of air force rearmament in 1934. By the mid- and late 1930s she found herself taking an increasingly feminist stance on such issues as maternal mortality rates, birth control clinics, women's nationality, and equal pay. In 1935 she presented a petition designed to allow married women to enjoy independent nationality, just as married men and single women did. In the same year, in a debate on women's pay, she attacked the view that the state had the right to push women into marriage and out of employment. Tate had found her vocation at last, but as her Willesden seat seemed likely to revert to Labour, her career was in jeopardy. Decisive as ever, she switched to a slightly safer constituency at Frome, in Somerset, for the 1935 election; her narrow victory there kept her in parliament until 1945.<br>
<br>It was the Second World War that brought Tate's career to its peak, though at the price of a breakdown from overwork in 1940. By working closely with the women Labour and Liberal members, she harassed the coalition government for its neglect of women's interests, helping in the process to create what, in effect, was a women's party for the duration of the war. Tate's major achievement was to demand that female civilians be awarded equal compensation with men rather than the two-thirds the authorities considered appropriate. She presented several petitions in support of this claim, and persuaded ninety-five members to vote against the government in a debate in November 1942. As a result the government established a select committee, and in April 1943 accepted its recommendation for equal compensation. From 1943 onwards Tate became a leading figure in the Equal Pay Campaign Committee, whose object was to pressurize the government into conceding equal pay in the civil service and teaching. After a narrow defeat over teachers' pay in 1943 the government resorted to a royal commission as a delaying tactic.<br>
<br>In spite of her growing political role, however, Tate's life began to deteriorate rapidly by the closing stages of the war. Separated since 1938, she was divorced from Henry Tate in 1944. Her defeat at the general election in 1945 at least left her with more time to campaign for equal pay; but she became angry as the report of the royal commission was delayed until 1946. Meanwhile she maintained pressure on the Labour members, but was frustrated by the new government's insistence that no resources could be found to meet the costs of equal pay for women. After her visit to the German concentration camps with other MPs in 1945 her health deteriorated. She had several operations for gallstones and suffered acute pain for lengthy periods. The culmination came on 5 June 1947 when she was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning at 6 Bloomfield Terrace, her Westminster home. In a note to her brother, Colonel K. W. Hogg, Tate explained the reasons for her suicide:<blockquote>As I have no one dependent on me it seems to me the wiser thing to do to end my life. An invalid is only a national liability today, and I cannot endure the extensive and constant pain in my head and practically no sleep at all week after week. (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 11 June 1947)</blockquote>The coroner recorded that she had taken her life while the balance of her mind was disturbed by ill health. Though only fifty-three, she doubtless realized that her chances of returning to parliament were poor, and the prospect of continual physical pain made the situation unendurable.<br>
<br>Mavis Tate had emerged from a background within the British establishment to make a mark as a radical in public life, and during the 1930s and the Second World War she became a prominent advocate of women's causes. Her vivacious personality, ready wit on the platform, and striking appearance  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>, 6 June 1947) gave her an advantage as a public figure. However, her life was punctuated by unhappiness and tragedy, which reflected her decisive temperament and a tendency to overwork.<br>
