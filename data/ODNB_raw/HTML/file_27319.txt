<span class="headword">Thomson <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Byerley]</span>,  Katherine</span> <span class="st"> [<em>pseud. </em>Grace Wharton]</span>  (1797&#150;1862), <span class="occ">historian and novelist</span>, was the seventh daughter among the thirteen children of Thomas Byerley (1748&#150;1810) of Etruria, Staffordshire, and his wife, Frances Bruckfield (1761/2&#150;1838). Her father was a nephew by marriage and sometime partner and manager of the pottery works of Josiah Wedgwood. Her sisters included <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51763/', "Maria Byerley (1787&#150;1843)")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51764/', "Frances Parkes (1786&#150;1842)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/51763/', "Byerley, Maria")</script>]. She was well-educated, attending the Misses Jacksons' school in Brighton. During her youth, she met distinguished figures like Samuel Parr (1747&#150;1825) and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 1810, her elder sisters opened a prestigious girls' school in Warwick, and a year later Katherine became an assistant teacher there. In 1817, the school moved to Barford, outside Stratford upon Avon. On 1 February 1820, she became the second wife of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27293/', "Anthony Todd Thomson (1778&#150;1849)")</script>, a Scottish physician; they had three sons, including <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27305/', "Henry William Thomson (1822&#150;1867)")</script>, the jurist, and five daughters. A. T. Thomson's younger sister became the second wife of William Stevenson, the father of Elizabeth Gaskell; as a result of the family connection, the future novelist was sent to the Byerley sisters' school. The school moved in 1824 to Avonbank, which was the setting for Gaskell's <span class="italic">My Lady Ludlow</span>.<br>
<br>Katherine Thomson's marriage was a very happy one. She and her husband spent most of their married life in London, living first in Sloane Square, then in Hinde Street, and later in Welbeck Street. They were part of a literary and artistic circle, which included Francis Jeffrey and Lord Cockburn. Thackeray and Browning also visited them, and Edward Bulwer Lytton and Letitia Landon were close friends. In 1843, Katherine's sister Anne&#151;then married to Samuel Coltman&#151;recorded that she &#145;never saw any person so full of life, animation, and enjoyment as Mrs Thomson&#151;the people are all in love with her&#146;  (Hicks, 117).<br>
<br>Apparently encouraged by her husband, in 1824 Katherine Thomson wrote a brief biography for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, <span class="italic">The Life of Wolsey</span>, which was commended by Henry Brougham. This was followed two years later by <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Court of Henry VIII</span> (1826), which is one of her best works. Although, inevitably, most of her sources were standard printed ones, such as Holinshed's <span class="italic">Chronicle</span>, Cavendish's <span class="italic">Life of Wolsey</span>, and Strutt's antiquarian works, her material is well-organized and her judgement frequently intelligent. The <span class="italic">Memoirs</span> showed close reading of the recently published work of John Lingard, and was deservedly commended by the <span class="italic">Edinburgh Review</span> as a work of &#145;much good sense, impartiality, and research&#146;. It was followed in 1830 by <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Raleigh</span>.<br>
<br>In 1833 Mrs Thomson published the semi-autobiographical <span class="italic">Constance, a Novel</span> (3 vols.), which she described in the preface as &#145;a natural picture of the affairs of life&#146;. It is a well-written and interesting domestic novel, containing many amusing if rather superfluous cameos of minor characters, including Dr Clayton, a portrait of the Johnsonian Samuel Parr. Favourably mentioned in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span>, which described it as &#145;an animated picture of country life some forty years ago&#146;, <span class="italic">Constance</span> was more successful than its successors, <span class="italic">Rosabel</span> (1835) and <span class="italic">Lady Annabetta</span> (1837). In the 1840s Katherine Thomson wrote several historical novels, including <span class="italic">Anne Boleyn</span> (3 vols., 1842), a monotonous and melodramatic work in the style of W. H. Ainsworth and G. P. R. James.<br>
<br>In her more serious work she abandoned the sixteenth century in favour of more recent history. In 1839 she published the <span class="italic">Memoirs of Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, and of the Court of Queen Anne</span> (2 vols.). This work is caustically described in the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> as &#145;diffuse, indexless &hellip; and inexact&#146;, but is nevertheless a readable and informative biography, which remained the standard work on its subject until the 1930s. It was based mainly on the correspondence of the duchess, which had been printed in 1838, but Mrs Thomson had also consulted the Marlborough papers, then in the British Library. In 1847 she published the <span class="italic">Memoirs of Viscountess Sundon</span> (2 vols.), a far less reputable work, which was deservedly criticized in the <span class="italic">Quarterly Review</span>; the reviewer, J. W. Croker, described the work as &#145;one of the most flagrant specimens of book making that even this manufacturing age has produced&#146;, and criticized it as unnecessarily inflated with irrelevant material and grossly inaccurate. The last failing was evident even on the title-page, where the subject of the biography, Charlotte Clayton, Baroness Sundon (<i>d</i>. 1742), was incorrectly described as viscountess and mistress of the queen's robes, when she could pretend to neither the rank nor the office. In the 1840s Mrs Thomson also wrote the first of her collections of biographical sketches, <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Jacobites of 1715 and 1745</span> (3 vols., 1845&#150;6).<br>
<br>After 1849, when her husband died, Katherine Thomson spent some time abroad, before returning to London. Her later publications were works of light literature. In 1854 she published <span class="italic">Recollections of Literary Characters and Celebrated Places</span> (2 vols.), a collection of essays of &#145;anecdotal topography&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>), which had originally appeared in <span class="italic">Fraser's Magazine</span>. Her <span class="italic">Celebrated Friendships</span> (2 vols., 1861) was, in her opinion, merely &#145;the details of private affairs&#146;; it is an agreeable but generally unoriginal account of the relationships of diverse characters, including Sir Philip Sidney and Sir Fulke Greville, Marie Antoinette and the princesse de Lamballe, and Elizabeth Carter and Catherine Talbot. Other works of the same ilk were <span class="italic">The Queens of Society</span> (2 vols., 1860), <span class="italic">The Wits and Beaux of Society</span> (2 vols., 1860), and <span class="italic">The Literature of Society</span> (2 vols., 1862). These three works were written jointly with her son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27317/', "John Cockburn Thomson (1834&#150;1860)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27305/', "Thomson, Henry William")</script>], the Sanskrit scholar, under the pseudonyms of Grace and Philip Wharton. She also published more novels, including the rather sensationalist <span class="italic">Court Secrets</span> (1857), a contemporary tale based on the life of Kaspar Hauser. In 1860 John Cockburn Thomson was drowned while swimming at Tenby. Katherine Thomson is believed never fully to have recovered from his death; she died on 17 December 1862 at Dover, of gastric fever according to one of her obituaries.<br>
<br>Katherine Thomson's work soon fell into obscurity, though her obituary in <span class="italic">The Athenaeum</span> claimed that her <span class="italic">Memoirs of the Court of Henry VIII</span> and her biography of Sarah Churchill had won her &#145;a good place in literature&#146;. Her output, consisting largely of biographical works concentrating on social and cultural history, and of historical novels which were inspired by her research, was typical of the early Victorian woman historian. With the increasing professionalization of history after 1850, her work became by comparison more marginal and lightweight in character. It has been rightly said that she carried &#145;anecdotal biography&#146; to &#145;the furthest limits of which this genre is susceptible&#146;  (<span class="italic">DNB</span>).<br>
