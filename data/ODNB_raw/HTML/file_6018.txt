<span class="headword">Combe,  Charles</span>  (1743&#150;1817), <span class="occ">physician and numismatist</span>, was born on 23 September 1743 in Southampton Street, Bloomsbury, where his father, John Combe (<i>d</i>. 1768), carried on business as an apothecary. His mother was called Elizabeth. He was educated at Harrow School, and among his schoolfellows he remained on close terms with Sir William Jones, the father of comparative philology, and Samuel Parr. He rose to the sixth form but did not proceed as hoped to Oxford, on account of a brother's illness and death which compelled him to remain at home and assist his father. Having pursued medical courses in London, he took over his father's business in 1768. On 9 May 1769 he married Arthey, daughter of Henry Taylor, watchmaker, of Red Lion Street in Holborn.<br>
<br>In addition to his medical studies Combe maintained an active interest in classical studies, and especially numismatics. He was elected FSA on 10 January 1771 and FRS on 11 January 1776. In 1773 he published <span class="italic">Index nummorum omnium imperatorum, Augustorum et Caesarum</span>, a listing of imperial &#145;large brass&#146;, including provincial issues, down to Domitian. That year, or earlier, he made the acquaintance of William Hunter, the anatomist and founder of the great coin collection now held in Glasgow. Combe's knowledge of Greek, Roman, and Anglo-Saxon coins, his eye for authenticity, and his understanding of the market, were instrumental in creating this collection. Over the next ten years he was of the greatest assistance to Hunter, not merely in acquiring desirable single coins but in valuing entire cabinets and negotiating their purchase. Having initially collected in his own right, he ceased to do so and sold his better pieces to Hunter in 1777. He also played a vital part in Hunter's scheme for a large seven-volume catalogue of the entire collection, divided according to series, each volume to be entrusted to a specialist. Combe would undoubtedly have been responsible for several volumes had the scheme been carried through; in the event only one came out, and Combe was its author. The <span class="italic">Nummorum veterum populorum et urbium &hellip; descriptio</span> (1782), a catalogue of Hunter's Greek pre-imperial issues, was the best work of its kind produced in the eighteenth century. It has been much corrected in detail, and the illustrations, contained in sixty-eight engraved plates, are poor as works of art, but Combe took care that they should be more faithful to the coins than the illustrations in previous numismatic works, and the volume as a whole earned praise from the eminent Austrian numismatist Joseph Eckhel. In many ways it set a standard for all later coin catalogues to emulate.<br>
<br>Combe was only one of several prominent antiquarians advising Hunter; his memoir of another, William Southgate, was prefaced to <span class="italic">Musaeum Southgatianum</span>, a reprint of the catalogues of the latter's library and coin collection in 1795. He was one of the three trustees appointed in Hunter's will to have care of his collection in London for thirty years, after which it was to pass to Glasgow University. Hunter died in 1783, and the trustees were happy to relinquish possession earlier than the prescribed term; in 1807 the coins travelled north under armed guard.<br>
<br>Combe was also associated professionally with Hunter, and this doubtless helped him to gain the degree of MD from Glasgow University in 1784. That year he went into practice as an obstetric physician, and he was admitted licentiate in midwifery by the College of Physicians on 5 April, and nominated governor of St Bartholomew's Hospital on 30 June. In 1789 he was chosen physician to the British Lying-in Hospital in Brownlow Street, and on resigning the post in 1810 was appointed consulting physician to the same institution. He also had a considerable private practice, and assembled a library of rare medical books (sold in 1808) and a collection of <i>materia medica</i> which was purchased by the College of Physicians shortly after his death. His collection of prints, an extensive array assembled on historical principles, with particular emphasis on mezzotints, had been auctioned in 850 lots in May 1803.<br>
<br>Combe's only other numismatic publication was a contribution to an appendix in the second edition of Vertue's <span class="italic">Medals &hellip; of Thomas Simon</span> (1780). After Hunter's death he turned his attention to classical literature, and in 1788 he began to work with Henry Homer, fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, on an edition of Horace with variorum notes. Samuel Parr was also originally to have taken part in the work. Homer died before the first volume was completed, and Combe finished the work alone; it was published in 1792&#150;3. Though the text was well edited and laid out, the copious notes were not free from errors, particularly when quoting in Greek. A severe criticism by Parr in the <span class="italic">British Critic</span>, however, went far beyond these faults by throwing doubt over Combe's judgement in selecting the notes and his faithfulness to the scheme as conceived by Homer. Combe responded with <span class="italic">A Statement of Facts Relative to the Behaviour of Dr Parr</span> (1793) and was answered by Parr in <span class="italic">Remarks on the Statement of Dr Charles Combe</span> (1795).<br>
<br>Combe died after a short illness at his house in Vernon Place, off Bloomsbury Square, on 18 March 1817, and was buried in the cemetery for St George's, Bloomsbury, in Brunswick Square, on 24 March. His wife had died in 1799, and of their four children only two survived him; the elder was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6020/', "Taylor Combe (1774&#150;1826)")</script>, keeper of antiquities in the British Museum.<br>
