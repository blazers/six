<span class="headword">Judd,  John Wesley</span>  (1840&#150;1916), <span class="occ">geologist</span>, was born on 18 February 1840 in Bath Square, Portsmouth, the son of George Judd, civil servant, and his wife, Jannette (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Meldrum). After the family moved to London, where his father worked in Somerset House, Judd attended school at Camberwell before training as a teacher at Westminster College. In 1863 he enrolled at the Royal School of Mines, and later won a royal exhibition for advanced study. However, he decided instead to take a job as an analytical chemist in Sheffield, where in 1866 he met the eminent geologist Henry Sorby, who introduced him to the use of thin rock sections and the polarizing microscope in the study of rocks and minerals.<br>
<br>Judd was involved in a serious railway accident in 1864, but after recovering from his injuries, in 1867 joined the geological survey as a temporary field officer and mapped much of the English midlands. Wishing for more freedom he became a school inspector in 1871, mapping the Wealden deposits of southern England in his spare time. He extended his study of Jurassic rocks to Scotland and studied the igneous complex of the Hebrides, producing many papers from 1873 onwards.<br>
<br>Judd's published works attracted the attention of Charles Lyell, Charles Darwin, and George Scrope, who commissioned him to investigate the volcanic districts of Europe, which he did from 1874 to 1876. On his return to England he was appointed professor of geology at the Royal School of Mines, where he established an innovative and integrated course. In 1896 he was elected dean, a position which he held until his retirement in 1905. Two years after his return to England, Judd married on 10 August 1878 Jeannie Frances Jeyes, daughter of John Jeyes of Great Harrowden. The couple later had one son and one daughter.<br>
<br>Judd was elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1865, subsequently serving as both secretary (1878&#150;86) and president (1886&#150;8). He received the Wollaston medal in 1891. In 1877 he was elected FRS and later served twice on council. In 1885 he was president of section C when the British Association met in Aberdeen. In 1895 he was created CB, and, in 1913, was appointed emeritus professor of the Royal College of Science.<br>
<br>During his career Judd published ninety-seven papers and books. Almost all appeared in either the <span class="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</span> or the <span class="italic">Geological Magazine</span>. His earlier papers concerned the Neocomian (the earliest epoch of the Cretaceous), the most noteworthy correlating the Speeton Clays with the Neocomian of the Lincolnshire wolds and north central Europe. A number of other papers, resulting from his European travels, dealt with the volcanic regions of central Italy and Hungary, in addition to the older volcanic districts within the alpine system. A third group of papers investigated igneous rocks on both the Scottish mainland and the Hebrides and was part of the controversy over the Skye intrusions involving Archibald Geikie. Although Judd's papers were detailed and comprehensive, his findings were not accepted by the geological survey. Judd's 1885 presidential address to section C of the British Association dealt with this controversy over the north-west highlands of Scotland, and in it he was highly critical of the survey.<br>
<br>Judd had a reputation as a specialist petrographer, and he wrote extensively in this area. As one of the new generation of vulcanologists, in 1888 he was asked by the Royal Society to write a report on the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. Judd also produced important concepts in igneous petrology, modifying Bunsen's classification of acid and basic by the addition of &#145;intermediate&#146; and &#145;ultrabasic&#146; categories, and also the concept of &#145;petrographic provinces&#146; to explain the presence of consanguineous rock types. He died of cancer on 3 March 1916, at 30 Cumberland Road, Kew. He was survived by his wife.<br>
