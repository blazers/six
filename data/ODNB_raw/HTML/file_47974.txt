<span class="headword">Thomas,  Lucy</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1781, <em>d.</em> 1847), <span class="occ">colliery owner</span>, was baptized at Llansamlet in south Wales on 11 March 1781, the daughter of Job Williams and his wife, Ann James. Much remains obscure about her early life, but she married Robert Thomas (<i>d</i>. 1833) at Llansamlet on 13 June 1802. Lucy's husband was a contractor of a coal level at Cyfarthfa ironworks, and in the 1820s he opened his own coal working at Waun Wyllt, near Abercannaid, just south of Merthyr Tudful. Between 1805 and 1825 they had six sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>The relative absence of knowledge about Lucy Thomas's personal details perhaps encouraged the development of her legendary reputation in Welsh industrial history: she was referred to as the &#145;mother of the Welsh steam-coal trade&#146;. This title derived from the fact that the initial cargoes of steam-coal to London came from the Thomas family's tiny level at Waun Wyllt, and from the belief that these enterprises were negotiated with Robert Thomas's widow, Lucy. Robert Thomas had opened the level in 1828 on a yearly tenancy from Lord Plymouth, and the terms explicitly banned any sale to the four ironworks which dominated the town.<br>
<br>In November 1830 George Insole shipped to London 413 tons of smokeless steam-coal from the (later) celebrated &#145;Four Feet&#146; seam. In the same year&#151;whether before or shortly afterwards is unclear&#151;James Marychurch and two companions (George Locket and James Duke) also visited Waun Wyllt and are said to have agreed to act as agents in Cardiff and London for the whole output, but Insole continued to pay first Robert and (after his death) Lucy for monthly quantities. Lucy Thomas and her son William later also worked the coal under the neighbouring Graig Farm, for which a lease was signed in 1838. In 1843 William Thomas leased the Llety Siencyn colliery in the neighbouring Aberd&acirc;r valley. In his memoirs John Nixon later described how Lucy Thomas conducted business at Graig colliery:<blockquote>She sat in her office, a wooden hut near the pit's mouth and traded for cash, placing in a basket over her head the moneys which she received for her coal. Her cleverness, her witty tongue, her pleasant manner were known to all the countryside. (Smith, 8)</blockquote>Much of Lucy Thomas's story is taken from the 1888 account given by the Merthyr historian Charles Wilkins, who had a penchant for imaginative touches but was usually sound on essentials. The impression he gives is of an enterprising woman looking for extra markets. However, this is certainly exaggerated: the accounts agree that it was Insole and Marychurch who struggled to seek her out in Abercannaid, and the latter seems to have contracted for a set price, which suggests that Mrs Thomas was not the risk taker. In 1840 John Nixon also claimed that she was reluctant to increase her output to provide him with supplies. Moreover, before her husband died on 19 February 1833, all business references mention only Robert Thomas, who was almost certainly the one to negotiate the initial shipments. Lucy and her eldest son, Robert, were granted probate and thereafter Insole paid to her the sums due for coal dispatched. It was not until 1835 that the account with the Glamorganshire Canal was transferred from Robert to Lucy Thomas. More substantially, although Cardiff later dominated the steam-coal trade, the earliest efforts to open a London market in steam-coal probably came from the ports of Swansea and Llanelli to the west. The Llangennech company, based near Llanelli, sent steam-coal&#151;and not just anthracite&#151;to London as early as 1824, and until the opening of the Aberd&acirc;r valley in the 1840s most Welsh coal sent to London came from the west. Indeed, while Lucy Thomas was alive, her Merthyr coal was the only source in the Merthyr area for steam-coal shipments. Nevertheless, such mundane considerations have been unable to withstand the power of a myth based on the singularity of a woman actively engaged in the almost totally male world of the coal industry. The myth was given some sort of material embodiment when her granddaughter's husband, W. T. Lewis, first Baron Merthyr, paid part of the cost of a water fountain built in Merthyr in remembrance of Robert and Lucy Thomas, in 1906.<br>
<br>Lucy Thomas died on 27 September 1847 at Abercannaid, Merthyr Tudful, having suffered from typhoid fever in the two previous weeks. Like other members of the family, she was buried in the cemetery of the Unitarian chapel at Cefncoedycymer, near Merthyr. Her estate, including the Waun Wyllt colliery and her half-interest (with her son William) in the Graig colliery, was valued at &pound;11,448. However adventurous Lucy Thomas may have been as an entrepreneur, she clearly had conventional views about the solidity of real estate: in her will she bequeathed nearly fifty freehold and leasehold houses and cottages to her various children.<br>
