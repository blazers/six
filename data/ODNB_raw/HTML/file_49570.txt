<span class="headword">Bardsley,  Cuthbert Killick Norman</span>  (1907&#150;1991), <span class="occ">bishop of Coventry</span>, was born on 28 March 1907 at Ulverston rectory, Ulverston, Lancashire, the youngest of the six children of the Revd Canon Norman Joseph Udall Bardsley (1869&#150;1928), rector of Ulverston, and from 1907 to 1928 vicar of Lancaster, and his wife, Mabel Annie (1872&#150;1939), daughter of William Killick, a Liverpool merchant. His father was from a line of twenty-eight clergy, including two bishops. His education at Summerfields preparatory school, Oxford, Eton College, and New College, Oxford (from where he graduated with a fourth-class degree in politics, philosophy, and economics in 1929), was unremarkable. But from his family heritage he received his large frame, large heart, immense enthusiasm; and, underlyingly, his acute instinct for the right creative spiritual initiative. It was this instinct which drew him at university to join Frank Buchman's Oxford Group, then to work full time with it (from 1935 to 1939), but later also to leave it. It also attracted him to a curacy with Tubby Clayton (Toc H), which first linked him with people at the workplace (1932&#150;4).<br>
<br>The same instinct empowered Bardsley when he became rector of Woolwich on the eve of the blitz. There (1940&#150;44) and also when he was summoned to be provost of Southwark (1944&#150;7), all his gifts came into play, of cherishing people and convincing them that they mattered infinitely, of selecting good colleagues, forming a central worshipping group on which he could draw, preaching memorably with alliterative points and stories punched home with passion, producing grand central occasions at which he enjoyed performing, and getting alongside people in shelters or rubble as the bombs rained down, or supremely in factories where they worked. The cathedral expanded his mission. The central occasions were now lectures or concerts, or large-scale diocesan events. The outreach included nearby office workers. Post-war visits to the armed services in Europe, at the archbishop of Canterbury's instigation, to raise morale by rekindling faith, led to the summons to leave his vibrant cathedral to become suffragan bishop of Croydon (1947&#150;56) and of the forces, to repeat and develop his success. He conveyed spiritual reality, combining evangelical and catholic, stressing sacraments <i>and</i> <span class="roman">Bible</span>, and this worked.<br>
<br>Bardsley was enthroned in Coventry in the ruins of the old cathedral in May 1956. He soon set about preparing for the new, &#145;a consecrated people for a consecrated Cathedral&#146; (a phrase from one of the new cathedral team he boldly appointed in 1958). He visited every deanery and clergyman, orchestrated diocesan-wide prayer and study groups, led a mission, speaking to 20,000 people, and finally after a Cross of Nails from the ruins had been carried from parish to parish, bore it up to the new high altar on the eve of the consecration. The central point of his whole life and work was the consecration of Coventry's renewed cathedral, on 25 May 1962, in the presence of the queen and representatives of many nations. As Bardsley's towering figure, in a brilliant yellow cope and mitre, moved purposefully from one focal point to another, calling upon the spirit in his huge voice, &#145;Be here! Be here!&#146;, he caught the imagination of a widespread television audience.<br>
<br>In the following years Bardsley never lost this creative instinct. People might criticize his preaching for being stronger in style than in content, and some found his fervour uncongenial. His enthusiasm sometimes clouded his judgement. His sudden impulses tested his colleagues. But at the heart of his zest for dramatic occasions there was an utterly genuine humility, a depth of prayer and holiness. He was universally loved (people never forgot his parish visits). And these qualities, combined with that brilliant flair for spotting growth points, gave him his greatness.<br>
<br>Bardsley was involved in founding the University of Warwick, to which he gave its name. He inaugurated the Arthur Rank Centre, a Christian presence at the Royal Agricultural Show. He encouraged industrial mission. His influence was felt in many places, among business people, farmers, or as president of Coventry City Football Club. He engaged in many other initiatives, including the Lee Abbey movement, the ministry of healing, especially at Burrswood, the Church of England Men's Society, and countless missions. He married surprisingly and quite late (on 1 August 1972) but intensely happily Ellen Edith Mitchell (<i>b</i>. 1910), a former secretary and Warwickshire county councillor, a long-standing friend of his sister, and a pillar of the diocese.<br>
<br>Bardsley's retirement as bishop of Coventry in 1976 was the end not only of a great episcopate but of an era. Clergy were invited to come and choose a book from his library and one of the pictures painted by him. These latter were surely symbols of that phenomenal presence, which many years later still made its impress felt on the diocese, and they conveyed something of his essence. Lashings of paint and vibrant colour depicted scenes from a larger than life world, strong in the brush strokes, lacking in detail and complexity, but forever fresh and vivid. After a long, active retirement Bardsley died of cancer at his home, Grey Walls, Berkeley Road, Cirencester, Gloucestershire, on 9 January 1991. He was survived by his wife. His ashes were, fittingly, interred behind the high altar of Coventry Cathedral.<br>
