<span class="headword">Iorwerth ab Owain</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1175<span class="mult">x</span>84), <span class="occ">prince in Wales, lord of Caerleon</span>, succeeded the king, his elder brother Morgan ab Owain, on Morgan's violent death in 1158. There is no indication that Iorwerth ever used the royal style, derived from their grandfather, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48539/', "Caradog ap Gruffudd (d. 1081)")</script>, one-time dominant king of Gwlad Morgan and client of William I. Iorwerth's first appearance is in 1136 when Gerald of Wales names him as the man responsible for the killing of Richard de Clare of Ceredigion in the pass of Grwyne Fawr between Abergavenny and Talgarth. In the subsequent conquest of Upper Gwent and Llefennydd by Morgan ab Owain, Iorwerth was closely associated with his brother. They issued joint charters in Stephen's reign, and even appear to have possessed a joint seal (although no impression of it survives). Although King Morgan left at least two sons, it was his brother who succeeded him in 1158. This was quite clearly because Iorwerth had occupied the position of heir designate (<i>edling</i>) during his brother's lifetime.<br>
<br>Iorwerth (styled on one occasion of &#145;Gwynll&#373;g&#146;) presided over the decline of his family's fortunes in Gwent in the 1160s and 1170s. Before 1169 the castle of Usk (taken by his brother <i>c</i>.1136&#150;7) was taken back by Earl Richard de Clare (Strongbow), lord of Chepstow. Iorwerth's failure to come to terms with Rhys ap Gruffudd of Deheubarth added to his problems. In 1171, on his way into the west, Henry II was persuaded by Rhys to join with him to oust Iorwerth from his castle of Caerleon and drive him back to his stronghold of Machen in Gwynll&#373;g. Iorwerth, his sons, and Morgan ap Seisyll, his nephew, retaliated by devastating the region of Llefennydd. Warfare continued into 1172, when Iorwerth's elder son, Owain, was assassinated by the earl of Gloucester's soldiers during a temporary truce. On 21 July 1173 Iorwerth retook Caerleon after a three-day siege and by mid-August had subdued all of lower Gwent, except the castles. He and his son <a href="#cosubject_62213">Hywel [<i>see below</i>]</a> appear to have maintained themselves by force in the area until early 1175, when family unity collapsed after Hywel blinded and castrated Owain Pen-Carn, his uncle (his father's younger brother). Iorwerth's nephew, Morgan ap Morgan ab Owain, seems always to have supported the English rather than his uncle. Caerleon Castle was once more lost.<br>
<br>Late in June 1175 Iorwerth came to an agreement with the Lord Rhys, with whose support he regained Caerleon from King Henry. The recovery of Caerleon may also have had something to do with the sexual liaison between the king and Iorwerth's daughter, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/47222/', "Nest Bloet")</script>, with whom the king had an illegitimate son, Morgan (surnamed Bloet, from his being brought up in the family of Nest's husband, Ralph Bloet (<i>d</i>. 1199) of Silchester). The date of Iorwerth's death is unknown, but he had been succeeded by his son Hywel ab Iorwerth of Caerleon by 1184. In Stephen's reign, probably before 1148, Iorwerth married Angharad, daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27971/', "Bishop Uthred")</script> of Llandaff. With her he had several known sons, Owain (killed in 1172), Hywel, his heir, and a younger pair, Gruffudd and Cadwallon, who appear at the court of King John at St Briavels in 1207, and also perhaps another son, Morgan. Iorwerth probably founded Llantarnam Abbey in Gwent and may have been buried there.<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_62213"></a><span class="headword">Hywel ab Iorwerth</span> <span class="st"> [Hywel of Caerleon]</span>  (<em>d.</em> in or before 1216) continued to rule as <span class="occ">lord of Caerleon</span> until the reign of John. A number of charters, in which he is styled Hywel of Caerleon, attest to his authority in the lowland area of Llefennydd, his control over Caerleon and the forest of Gwynll&#373;g (that is, upland Gwynll&#373;g), and his advocacy of Goldcliff Priory. In 1184&#150;5 he was allied with the king of England, leading a company in the defence of the lordship of Glamorgan, where he acted as castellan of Newcastle, near Bridgend.<br>
<br>By 1216 Hywel had been succeeded by his son, <a name="cosubject_62214"></a><span class="headword">Morgan ap Hywel</span> <span class="st"> [Morgan of Caerleon]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1248)<span class="occ"></span>, who in that year was carrying out a damaging campaign in Gwent against William (I) Marshal, earl of Pembroke and Striguil. The Marshal's biography suggests that Morgan had attempted to reclaim his dynasty's lost lands, which would imply an assault on the lordship of Usk. Morgan seems to have seized the opportunity presented by the invasion of England by Louis of France to press his claims by violence. The coming of peace in September 1217 removed his chance, and Morgan's men were driven from Caerleon at the end of the year by a bloody assault on the castle by the military household of William (I) Marshal. The campaign against him continued, as Morgan moved the centre of his resistance to his castle of Machen in upland Gwynll&#373;g. A conference at Worcester on 11 March 1218 led to Morgan's loss of Caerleon to the Marshal and the rest of Morgan's career is a story of his dogged attempts to reclaim his family's position in lower Gwent.<br>
<br>Morgan's principal opponents were the successive Marshal earls of Pembroke, each formidable in personal wealth and power. His chances of success against the younger Earl William Marshal were slim, for the earl maintained a great position at court, and married the king's sister. Even so, Morgan managed to challenge Earl William (II)'s continued possession of Caerleon in the <i>curia regis</i> and the castle remained in royal hands between 1223 and 1226 pending a resolution of the case. Morgan's failure led to a formal quitclaim of his rights in Caerleon to Earl William in or soon after 1227. But Morgan's great opportunity came with the succession of Richard Marshal in 1231. Earl Richard rapidly fell foul of Henry III and a war erupted in the marches and the south-west in 1232. Morgan was retained in the royal household for the campaign, and did great damage to the Marshal lands in Gwent. In the summer of 1233 his suit against the Marshals for possession of Caerleon was once again in the <i>curia regis</i>. By September 1233 he had a royal decision in his favour, but since the new earl, Gilbert Marshal (who succeeded his brother in 1234), would not give up the castle, Morgan had a grant of two English manors until he could repossess it. Morgan reoccupied the castle of Caerleon and lordships of Edlogan and Llefennydd early in 1236 (the <span class="italic">Brut</span> noting that it was &#145;for fear of the Lord Llywelyn&#146;) and also had damages assessed against Earl Gilbert, which the earl paid (reluctantly) in September. It seems that Earl Gilbert took the reverse badly, as is demonstrated by a remarkable indenture of 1236 between him and a local knight, Sir William de St Maur, by which Sir William undertook to support by any legal means possible the earl's attempts to oust Morgan from the manor of Undy, in lower Gwent. None the less, Morgan remained in control of Caerleon and its associated lordships until his death in 1248, before 15 March. He was childless, and was succeeded by Maredudd ap Gruffudd, who in one source appears to have been the descendant of Iorwerth ab Owain through Gwerfyl, the daughter of his youngest son, Morgan, but who could also conceivably have been the son of Gruffudd ab Iorwerth ab Owain (and therefore Morgan ap Hywel's first cousin once removed). Maredudd acquired lands in Llefennydd and elsewhere, but Caerleon was denied him (presumably on the pretext of its being a life grant to Morgan in 1233, and not therefore heritable except at the king's will).<br>
<br>The career of Morgan ap Hywel is the logical culmination of earlier choices of his family, such as the judicious collaboration of Morgan ab Owain with marcher powers in the reigns of Stephen and Henry II, and the choices of his grandfather and father at key points to ally with the king against the dominant Welsh power of their day (whether Deheubarth or Gwynedd). Morgan ap Hywel was an open Anglicizer: he operated through attorneys in courts of English law; served (as had his father) with English armies; adopted a toponym; and broke with the traditional Welsh families who supported and were tied to his dynasty, as can be seen from his aggression against his own hereditary <i>distain</i> (&#145;steward&#146;), Iorwerth ab Adam, in the 1240s. He prefigures several other Anglicizing Welsh dynasties, notably those of Powys and Afan. It is perhaps ironic that the ab Adam family, with whom he fell out, followed the same path and ultimately became peers of the English parliament in the reign of Edward I.<br>
