<span class="headword">Backhouse,  Jonathan</span>  (1779&#150;1842), <span class="occ">banker and financier</span>, was born in Darlington, co. Durham, the eldest son of Jonathan Backhouse (1747&#150;1826), banker, and his wife, Ann (<i>d</i>. 1826), the second daughter of Edward Pease of Darlington. Jonathan senior was the eldest of three sons of James Backhouse of Westmorland, a yarn and wool dealer, who had moved to Darlington during the 1750s to establish a flax-dressing and linen-manufacturing business [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/56500/', "Backhouse family (per. c.1770&#150;1945)")</script>]. This was the precursor to the foundation, in 1774, of J. and J. Backhouse banking, a partnership shared by James, with his son Jonathan and later also with his nephew James junior. The family had earlier indicated its interest in wider commercial affairs by taking on the local agency of the Royal Exchange Assurance in 1759.<br>
<br>As private bankers, the Backhouses were not untypical of numerous entrepreneurs in the eighteenth-century economy who combined manufacturing ventures with the financing of trade generally. The Quaker Lloyds of Birmingham and the Gibbons family of Wolverhampton provide excellent illustrations in the metallurgical trades, while in mining there are several cases in the north-east of England. In textiles, the best-known example is provided by the Gurneys of Norwich, a Quaker family with a banking tradition going back to the later seventeenth century, but which also developed a thriving trade in woollen yarns in the first half of the eighteenth century. By integrating banking with manufacturing, these family concerns could both advance credit to customers and receive it from suppliers and so more easily sustain the expansion of business. Like the Gurneys, however, the Backhouses were to abandon manufacturing in favour of full banking, a move which had been accomplished by the end of the eighteenth century. At that time J. and J. Backhouse possessed an extensive agency network in co. Durham, underpinned by a considerable note issue payable at sight, and fourteen days after sight, in London.<br>
<br>In 1798, following the death of James senior, the title of the bank was changed to Jonathan Backhouse &amp; Co. It was in this form that it became involved in the financing and projection of the pioneering Stockton and Darlington Railway, the first public railway to be empowered to use steam locomotives. The possibility of improving the transport infrastructure of south Durham and north-east Yorkshire had been discussed intermittently throughout the latter half of the eighteenth century, when attention was invariably focused on the construction of a canal linking the Auckland coalfield to the estuary of the River Tees. The capital cost, however, was viewed as prohibitive, and real progress had to await the development of a capital network spreading beyond the limited confines of co. Durham. In this respect, the Backhouses were well placed. As prosperous Quakers, they proved to be entirely typical of their religious sect in developing marital ties which facilitated substantial financial inflows from other parts of the country.<br>
<br>Of crucial importance was the marriage in 1811 of Jonathan Backhouse junior to Hannah Chapman (<i>d</i>. 1850), the elder daughter and coheir of Joseph Gurney, a private banker of Norwich; the couple had two daughters and a son. This dynastic alliance in itself transformed the prospects for transport improvement, especially when the Backhouses allied themselves with the Quaker Pease family of Darlington in the raising of capital. As woollen manufacturers and private bankers themselves, the Peases were related by marriage to the Backhouses, and developed their own ties with the Gurneys when Joseph Pease married Emma Gurney in 1826. It was thus the Backhouse&#150;Pease alliance which emerged as the principal underwriters of the Stockton and Darlington Railway, authorized by parliament in 1821 and opened formally in September 1825. The early records of the company are illustrative of the strength of Quaker financial networks in mobilizing capital resources. This fact was reflected in Backhouse's appointment as first treasurer to the company, a position which he held until 1833, by which time the railway was well established as a conveyor of coal and other industrial raw materials along the lower Tees valley.<br>
<br>During the first three decades of the nineteenth century Backhouse proved to be the dominant partner in the bank, and he presided over a process of expansion which was to consolidate its position in the commercial infrastructure of co. Durham. In 1805 a branch was opened at Durham and in the following year at Sunderland. In the mid-1820s the network was extended to Newcastle upon Tyne, South Shields, and Stockton-on-Tees. In conformity with the evolution of the banking system in the country as a whole at this time, the north-east of England was afflicted periodically by phases of instability in response to the overextension of credit. Local banking crises occurred in the late 1790s, in 1803, 1815, 1819, 1823, and 1825. Jonathan Backhouse &amp; Co. weathered all of these vicissitudes without difficulty.<br>
<br>The crisis of 1819 was particularly noteworthy insofar as it was the product of a crude attempt by the earl of Darlington to bankrupt the concern. At that time the Backhouses were busily projecting the Stockton and Darlington Railway with a proposed route to the Auckland coalfield through Lord Darlington's Raby estate. Incensed by the potential threat to his fox coverts, the earl attempted to accumulate the bank's paper notes to the point when their value exceeded the gold stock. The apocryphal-sounding but nevertheless true story is told that Backhouse became acquainted with Lord Darlington's plot and frustrated it by posting to London to obtain extra bullion stocks. His coach lost a wheel on the return journey, but the chaise was balanced by his placing the gold at an appropriate point over the rear axle.<br>
<br>Backhouse resigned as treasurer to the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1833 in order to embark upon full-time ministry on behalf of the Society of Friends. He retained his partnership in the family bank, but bequeathed his authority to his son, Edmund (1824&#150;1906). Jonathan Backhouse died at Darlington on 7 October 1842.<br>
<br>The family bank experienced mixed fortunes under later generations. Edmund Backhouse was followed as senior partner by his son, Jonathan Edmund (1849&#150;1918). The latter was rewarded with a baronetcy in 1893 and presided over the merger in 1896 of the bank with Gurneys of Norwich and Barclays of London to form Barclay &amp; Co. of Lombard Street, destined to become one of the &#145;big five&#146; clearing banks after the First World War. Sir Jonathan was appointed local director of the new company and was to prove instrumental in precipitating the absorption of the Pease family's private bank, J. and J. W. Pease, in 1902, but in circumstances which led to the financial ruin of the senior partner, Sir Joseph Whitwell Pease, and his sons Alfred and Joseph.<br>
