<span class="headword">Schofield,  Herbert</span>  (1882&#150;1963), <span class="occ">educationist</span>, was born at Halifax, Yorkshire, on 8 December 1882, the elder son of James and Alice Schofield. On leaving the Trinity higher grade school, Halifax, at fourteen, he joined his father's small mechanical engineering firm to serve a seven-year apprenticeship. He also attended classes in engineering at Halifax Municipal Technical College winning a Carnegie engineering scholarship to the Royal College of Science in South Kensington, where he obtained a BSc honours degree in physics from the University of London. He subsequently took up a post as physics master at Dover county school and director of further education in charge of a small technical institute. It was from this post that, in September 1915, Schofield came to Loughborough as principal of the Technical Institute which had been established only six years earlier.<br>
<br>Schofield's long-term aim was to transform Loughborough College, as the institute soon became known, into a high-level engineering college. His own experience in industry was very probably a motivating factor and he also had a lifelong admiration for American industrial methods which he sought to emulate to a degree in the practical slant he gave his training methods in his college. The first major stage in the college's growth began in January 1916 when Schofield introduced short training courses for women munitions workers, a development that was to expand enormously during the next few years and for which he was made MBE in August 1917. He based his courses on the principle for which he was to become famous, &#145;training on production&#146;, whereby workers were trained under conditions as similar as possible to those in industry. He was later to apply this philosophy to the courses for his students in the post-war college. In September 1918 he introduced a five-year full-time diploma course in mechanical engineering for former officers; the diploma of Loughborough College grew rapidly in the next few years and extended into other branches of engineering and commerce.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, in 1918, Schofield married Clara Johns (<i>b</i>. 1890); they had a daughter and adopted a son. His wife died in 1928 and he never remarried. He was awarded a London doctorate of philosophy in 1923 for research into the thermal combustion and mechanical efficiency of high-speed multi-cylinder internal combustion engines. In the college, major developments in the inter-war period included the setting-up of a department for training handicraft teachers in 1930; the establishment of the annual summer school in August 1931, offering courses mainly in physical education and arts and crafts; the creation of an aeronautical engineering department in 1935; and the gradual extension of the college's work in physical education. During these years, Schofield was busily acquiring property for use as student hostels, while at the same time there was a gradual shift in the centre of gravity of the college from its original buildings in the centre of the town to another more spacious site on the western edge of Loughborough, later the campus of Loughborough University. Throughout this period, the work of the original Technical Institute in offering part-time lower-level courses continued. Thus, by the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Schofield, with the aid of his able lieutenants, had built up a remarkable institution of international repute, considerable diversity, and with a wide range of residential and sporting facilities.<br>
<br>During the war, Schofield endeavoured to keep the normal diploma and teacher-training courses going, albeit in shortened forms and with fewer students. In addition, the college made a direct contribution to the war effort by providing a wide range of technical courses for personnel of all three services, and by housing the RAF medical rehabilitation unit. The immediate post-war period brought a substantial increase in student numbers as former servicemen flocked into the college. Schofield, always eager to start something new, added another string to his bow, with the introduction of a full-time course in librarianship in January 1947. Nationally and regionally, he continued to be very active. He was chairman of the Council of the Institution of Production Engineers in 1946 and its president from 1948 to 1950; he was appointed vice-chairman of the National Advisory Council on Education for Industry and Commerce; and he was a lay canon of Leicester Cathedral, an honour of which he was very proud. For his contribution to technological education, Schoey, or the Doctor, as he had become known by this time, was made CBE in 1947. However, he was now well into his sixties and finally retired in December 1950 at the age of sixty-eight, after thirty-five years as principal of Loughborough College. After his retirement, Schofield remained in Loughborough and, in addition to becoming a local town councillor, continued to be active in the Rotary movement in which he had been a leading figure for many years, having been president of Rotary International of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 1931&#150;2.<br>
<br>The empire which Schofield created during his lifetime did not survive very long after his retirement and broke up into four separate institutions: the College of Technology which in 1966 was to become Loughborough University; Loughborough College of Education, which in 1977 amalgamated with the university; Loughborough College of Art and Design, which merged with the university in 1998; and Loughborough Technical College, now renamed simply Loughborough College.<br>
<br>Schofield was an educational entrepreneur, ever ready to grasp an opportunity, and his courage and foresight were exemplified by the extraordinary growth of his college, especially during the harsh economic climate of the inter-war years. His major contribution to technological education was his policy of &#145;training on production&#146;, considered by some to be the precursor of the modern sandwich course. Though not physically large, Schofield had a masterful presence and, the possessor of enormous energy, he drove himself and his staff very hard. A determined and in many ways an autocratic man, he put his life's work into Loughborough College, a unique institution in its time, one which was essentially his creation and which he dominated for so long. He died in a nursing home at Radmoor Road, Loughborough, on 18 September 1963.<br>
