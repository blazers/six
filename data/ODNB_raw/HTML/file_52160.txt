<span class="headword">Barantyn,  Drew</span>  (<em>c.</em>1350&#150;1415), <span class="occ">goldsmith and mayor of London</span>, was the younger son of Thomas Barantyn, lord of Chalgrove in Oxfordshire (he had an older brother, Thomas, who died in 1400). Barantyn's talents as a craftsman rather than his family connections were to be the key to his success in the world. He was apprenticed to Robert Oxenford in 1363, and became a freeman of the city of London and member of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1370, taking apprentices himself from 1379. He was twice warden of the company: in 1380 and 1385. Thereafter it was as a court supplier, financier, and one of the rulers of London that he was most prominent. Among Barantyn's many commissions for the royal household in the later years of Richard II's reign were two collars and a brooch set with rubies, pearls, and diamonds made &#145;for the king's own person&#146; in 1393. In association with Hans Doubler, an immigrant goldsmith and diamond merchant, Barantyn established a reputation for work in precious stones.<br>
<br>Barantyn was introduced to court circles by Sir Nicholas Twyford. He worked for Twyford before establishing his own business, became one of his executors, and Twyford's patronage was a determining factor in his career. Twyford died in 1390, and Barantyn's first wife, Margery (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1414), was Twyford's widow as well as being the granddaughter of Simon Burgh, another goldsmith. Barantyn followed his patron in pursuing a middle course through the turbulent politics of Richard II's reign. In the quarrel which erupted between Richard and the city of London in 1392 Barantyn, as a newly elected alderman, was one of those summoned to appear before the king and council on 25 June 1392 to answer for defaults in the government of the city. But he was confirmed in his aldermanry by the king on 22 July, and elected sheriff in the following year and mayor in 1398&#151;appointments which, at a time when the city's liberties remained conditional upon royal favour, epitomize the career of one whose expertise in his craft commended him to the crown, but who had the confidence of his fellow citizens as well. That confidence was further expressed in Barantyn's election to the parliaments of 1395, 1397 (September), 1404 (January), 1410, 1413 (February), and 1413 (May), and as mayor once again in 1408.<br>
<br>On 7 May 1393 Barantyn was one of three leading goldsmiths to whom the king granted licence to alienate lands and rents held in mortmain, in aid of the implementation of the company's new charter. Behind the comparatively modest sum of 20 marks paid by the goldsmiths for this grant on 6 February 1393 lay an altogether more substantial exaction. In the same month, as the price of pardons to the Londoners, Richard II acknowledged the receipt of &pound;10,000, a sum that was accompanied by gifts of jewels and plate to an equivalent amount. No doubt the alienations of Goldsmiths' property were intended to finance that company's share of the city's composition with the king. In the relationship between the crown and the wealthy London capitalists during this period, the patronage disposed of by the former was of paramount importance. Henry IV's charter of 1404, granting extended powers to the Goldsmiths, owed much to Barantyn's standing and influence with the king.<br>
<br>Even as Twyford's customers had included not only Richard II but Edward, the Black Prince, and John of Gaunt, so Barantyn's association with Henry of Lancaster antedated the latter's accession to the throne. In 1394 Henry's new year gifts included two gold rings set with diamonds purchased from Barantyn. The mayor who headed the procession which welcomed Lancaster to the city on 1 September 1399 was well known to the duke; for the rest of Henry IV's life Barantyn was to serve him just as he had served Richard. Payments to him by the king in 1408 included &pound;550 for a gold collar garnished with pearls, 1000 marks for a brooch, and &pound;99 12<i>s</i>. for silver vessels given to the French ambassadors. The most outstanding of the jewels pledged by Henry V before Agincourt was &#145;the Michael&#146;, purchased from Barantyn in the previous reign. Loans by Barantyn to Henry IV varied from comparatively small amounts of &pound;27 (1408) and 100 marks (1410) to &pound;150 (1402) and &pound;1500 (1410).<br>
<br>If Barantyn's skill as a craftsman and prestige as a retailer were the bases of his wealth, his marriage to Twyford's widow raised him to the top rank of London's property owners. To the estate acquired through this marriage Barantyn added further investments in land. In the city the most notable of his purchases was the Jewengarden, with adjacent shops and houses, in the parish of St Giles without Cripplegate, a property which, together with houses in Gutter Lane, he left to the Goldsmiths' Company in his will. In the lay subsidy of 1412 Barantyn's assessment of &pound;55 16<i>s</i>. 11<i>d</i>. exceeded that of the wealthy mercer Richard Whittington (<i>d</i>. 1423), and even that of the Goldsmiths' Company itself. Outside London, Barantyn again added to Twyford's holdings, principally in Oxfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, and Buckinghamshire. In his later years Barantyn's varied credit operations and commercial interests, including Mediterranean trade in cloth and wool, contributed to his working capital.<br>
<br>Barantyn died on 14 December 1415, survived by his second wife, Christine, whom he had married not long before. There were no children of either of his marriages. In his will he made provision for his burial in the church of St John Zachary, and for a chantry there for the souls of himself, his first wife, Margery, and Nicholas Twyford, the charges to be met from the property left to the Goldsmiths' Company. 100 marks were to be distributed to &#145;poor and needy men and women of the goldsmiths' craft in the city of London&#146; to pray for his soul, an obligation which the goldsmiths' ordinances show to have been incumbent twice weekly upon the company's almsmen. Barantyn's bequests amounted to over &pound;1000 and included legacies to his servants in both town and country, and also &pound;60 for &#145;the poor kinsfolk of Nicholas Twyford&#146;  (TNA: PRO, PROB 11/2B, sig. 31). His widow's dower was confiscated by the crown in 1419 after she married John Manning, coroner of Wiltshire, without royal licence. Recovered by fine, the dower was the subject of extensive litigation when, after Manning's death, Christine married the heir to the greater part of Barantyn's estates, his nephew, Reynold Barantyn.<br>
