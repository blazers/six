<span class="headword">Yates,  Frederick Dewhurst</span>  (1884&#150;1932), <span class="occ">chess player and journalist</span>, was born plain Fred Yates at Huddersfield Road, Birstall, near Leeds, on 16 January 1884, the son of John Thomas Yates, a mechanical fitter, and his wife, Ada Ellen, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Dewhurst. On leaving Birstall Wesleyan day school in 1898 he took employment in the accounts department of the Birstall district council. In 1901 he moved to London, seeking work as a freelance journalist, with modest results. By 1905 he was back in Yorkshire, and his chess career began. He was not a born chess genius, but achieved his status by diligence. In 1906 he barely scraped into the Yorkshire team, but by 1909 he had become the county champion and made his first appearance in the British championship, held that year in Scarborough. He tied with Joseph Henry Blackburne for the fourth prize. Blackburne, near the end of his career, was the only English player to make a living solely from chess in the nineteenth century, and now Yates decided to follow the same path.<br>
<br>In 1910 Yates played in his first international tournament, held at Hamburg. The leading German player Dr Tarrasch objected to Yates's presence on the grounds that he was not yet strong enough. The only win Yates scored there was against Tarrasch. This is an early example of an aspect of Yates's character&#151;a strengthening of resolve when under fire. In 1913 Yates won the first of six British championships (1913, 1914, 1921, 1926, 1928, 1931), and also his first prize in a foreign event. Perhaps because of his frail physique and nervous disposition Yates did not serve in the First World War, but in the post-war decade his career reached its peak. By then the emphasis of his play had shifted from violent tactics to subtle positional manoeuvring.<br>
<br>Between 1919 and 1932 Yates played in almost sixty international tournaments. Although he never quite reached the highest level, he defeated all the leading players with the exception of Capablanca and Lasker, two of the four world champions he met. A curious feature was that the better the opposition the stronger his game became. Against weaker opponents his play could be lacklustre and careless. Perhaps his best performances in grandmaster tournaments were at San Remo in 1930, when he was fifth out of sixteen, and at Carlsbad in 1923, when he won six games, drew seven, and lost four. He was awarded a special brilliancy prize there for his defeat of the future world champion Alekhine.<br>
<br>In many events Yates played under the serious disadvantage of also working as a journalist covering the whole competition. Some experts consider this to be equivalent to giving the odds of a pawn in each game. His reports and weekly chess columns appeared in the <span class="italic">Manchester Guardian</span>, <span class="italic">Daily Telegraph</span>, <span class="italic">Yorkshire Evening Post</span>, and <span class="italic">Yorkshire Weekly Post</span>. With his close friend William Winter, Yates wrote three books; two covered each of the world championship matches of 1927 and 1928, and the third was <span class="italic">Modern Master Play</span> (1929). Having begun an autobiographical work, <span class="italic">One-Hundred-and-One of my Best Games of Chess</span>, Yates was found dead from gas poisoning on 11 November 1932. Last seen alive at midnight on 9 November, he did not emerge from his room at 32 Coram Street, St Pancras, London, on the 10th, and his door was forced on the 11th. He was buried five days later at Birstall. The autobiography was completed by William Winter and published in 1934.<br>
<br>A great conversationalist over a wide range of topics, Yates enjoyed convivial company late into the night. Some disliked his bohemian lifestyle and false rumours spread, never to stop completely, that he had taken his own life. At the inquest on 15 November a gas company employee demonstrated that the tap was turned off and that a faulty fitting of an obsolete type had caused the gas leak. A verdict of accidental death was returned. As the nearest relatives, two sisters, were almost penniless, the costs of Yates's funeral and his debts to his landlady were met by the chess world. In those lean days it was not possible for a British chess professional to have a wife, family, or home.<br>
<br>Emanuel Lasker, world champion for a record twenty-seven years, said of Yates:<blockquote>At first he went unnoticed but very soon one awoke to the fact that he was intensely likeable and before long his great moral power became evident. He never indulged in intrigue, he never pushed himself to the fore, he never quarrelled. Cheerfully going his very straight way, ready, if need be, to undergo privations, he never did aught contrary to his self-respect. (Yates and Winter, 22&#150;3)</blockquote>
