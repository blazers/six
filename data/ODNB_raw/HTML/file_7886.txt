<span class="headword">Douglas,  George</span>, first earl of Dumbarton  (<em>c.</em>1636&#150;1692), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was the second son of the second marriage of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7934/', "William Douglas, first marquess of Douglas (1589&#150;1660)")</script>, to Lady Mary Gordon (1610/11&#150;1674), daughter of George Gordon, first marquess of Huntly. In 1647 he received permission from Charles I to go to France for five years. He took military service under Louis XIV, receiving by 1656 the colonelcy of the regiment formerly commanded by his elder half-brothers, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7894/', "Lord James Douglas")</script> and <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/7869/', "Archibald Douglas, styled earl of Angus and Ormond")</script>. The regiment was recalled in 1666 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, upon which its arrears, and his pension, were withheld. Charles II returned part of the regiment &#145;as a present&#146; in 1667, whence it was used as a diplomatic tool by Louis XIV in order to endanger British trade with the Ottoman Porte by making it part of the invasion force of Candia (Crete) in 1668/9. Though a great favourite of Louis XIV, he was said to be very much &#145;in their black book&#146;  (TNA: PRO, SP 78/122/122) after deserting the service in 1669, and Arlington had to forward him 242 livres so that he could afford to leave France. He soon returned to French service and was a <i>mar&eacute;chal de camp</i> at the time when his regiment fought alongside the duke of Monmouth's r&eacute;giment royal anglais in the French army during the Third Anglo-Dutch War. On 9 March 1675 Charles II granted him the titles of earl of Dumbarton and Lord Ettrick, though he owned no land anywhere in Scotland. He was appointed a lieutenant-general in the French army in 1676/7 after considerable manoeuvring at the French court. His brother the duke of Hamilton was told that the appointment would gain him nothing save a further debt of the 20,000 livres he was forced to spend on his equipage for the French encampment at Cambray. In the same year the regiment of his younger brother Lord James was collapsed into his own. His regiment was formally disbanded from the French army in June 1678, but was re-formed on the English establishment as the 1st Royal regiment of foot, or the Royal Scots. He again recruited Scots for French service in 1679. From 1680 onwards his regiment served in Ireland, with 200 of his men also being sent to Tangier.<br>
<br>Dumbarton was a great royal favourite; in 1684 Charles II granted him &pound;1500 to cover fines imposed on him for ecclesiastical irregularities resulting from his Catholicism. Following James VII and II's accession to the throne he assisted in the suppression of Argyll's rebellion and was appointed commander-in-chief of the army in Scotland. He was an integral member of James's Catholic court party, supporting the policies in Scotland of his brother-in-law James Drummond, earl of Perth, chancellor of Scotland, and Perth's brother John, earl of Melfort, secretary of state for Scotland. In 1687 he became one of the founding knights of the &#145;restored&#146; Order of the Thistle, and was appointed a gentleman of James's bedchamber. He received the estate of the attainted Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun in the same year, upon which he wrote to his brother-in-law the duke of Queensberry, saying of his sister that &#145;now I am a Scots Laird I may hop[e] to see herr&#146;  (NL Scot., Salt. MS 17498, fol. 57). The king also helped pay off his many debts. He was one of the courtiers who advised James to flee in 1688. He followed James to Rochester, being one of the three courtiers, including his nephew the earl of Arran, who accompanied him there. He died at St Germain-en-Laye on 20 March 1692 and was buried, possibly the same day, at St Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s. He married, in or about 1686, Anne, daughter of Robert Wheatley, of Bracknell, Berkshire. She was supposedly a sister of the duchess of Northumberland, but Dumbarton's brother the duke of Hamilton would never consent to meet her. She died at St Germain-en-Laye on 25 April 1691. He and Anne had a son, George, second earl of Dumbarton, born in April 1687. He wanted to be a monk, but was dissuaded by Mary of Modena in 1704. He returned to Britain, having been pardoned of high treason as a Jacobite in 1710, and attained high rank in the British army and the diplomatic service, being appointed ambassador to Russia in 1716. He died without issue and the title became extinct.<br>
