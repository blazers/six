<span class="headword">Finch,  Edward</span>  (<em>b. </em>after 1584, <em>d.</em> 1641/2), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman</span>, was a younger son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9436/', "Sir Henry Finch (c.1558&#150;1625)")</script> and Ursula Thwaites (<i>d</i>. in or after 1625), of Eastwell in Kent. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9438/', "John Finch, later first Baron Finch of Fordwich (1584&#150;1660)")</script>, was his elder brother. Nothing is known of his early life or education. He became vicar of Christ Church, Newgate, London, on 9 December 1630 following the death of the incumbent, Sampson Price, and received a BD from Cambridge early in 1632. At some point during late 1640 or early 1641 a number of his parishioners petitioned the Long Parliament for his ejection from the parish. They complained of his &#145;superstitious affection to the Surplice and other Popish practices&#146; such as the erection of an altar, bowing at the name of Jesus, and the use of organ music  (<span class="italic">Petition and Articles</span>, 6). They also charged that he exacted &#145;unlawfull and unreasonable Fees and summes of money&#146; from his flock and had not lived in the parish &#145;for many years&#146;. It was further alleged that he was &#145;a common haunter of Tavernes, and Alehouses&#146;, lived apart from his wife, and kept company with &#145;divers women suspected of incontinency&#146;. In particular it was alleged that he had behaved in a lewd fashion while ministering to a dying woman and had tried to seduce another woman by showing her &#145;what was most shameful to be seen or spoken of&#146;  (<span class="italic">Petition and Articles</span>, 1&#150;2, 4, 10).<br>
<br>On 8 May 1641 John White of the grand committee for religion reported the matter to the Commons and the house resolved that Finch was &#145;guilty of practicing Innovations in the Church, Non-residence, foul Extortions, Neglect of the Duty of his Function, and Prophaning of the Sacraments&#146;. The house further resolved that he was &#145;a Man of Prophane Life, Scandalous in his Doctrine and Conversation, and a Hinderer of Preaching&#146; and, as such, was &#145;unfit to hold any Benefice or Promotion in the Church&#146;  (<span class="italic">JHC</span>, 2.139; 8 May 1641). In August Finch's opponents complained that he had not been removed from his position, and he may have still been vicar when he published his defence, <span class="italic">An Answer to the Articles</span>, in November 1641.<br>
<br>In this Finch admitted his Laudian leanings but denied any pastoral, financial, or sexual impropriety. He denied that he was married, and claimed, apparently with some justification, that some of the evidence presented against him had been fabricated. Yet he was forced to admit that he did swear and had frequented taverns and alehouses. He also admitted that he had suffered imprisonment at some unspecified point during the 1630s, and had twice successfully defended himself in the courts against allegations of sexual misconduct. He ascribed the petition and articles against him to the machinations of William Greenhill, &#145;that Arch-incendiary of Christ-Church Parish&#146;, and presented a petition in his favour signed by &#145;most of the Gentry, and divers other persons of quallity, honestie and abilitie&#146;  (Finch) in his parish.<br>
<br>Finch died some time before 1 February 1642, when the &#145;rigid Presbyterian&#146; William Jenkins succeeded him as vicar of Christ Church  (Kennet, 792).<br>
