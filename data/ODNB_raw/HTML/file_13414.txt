<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hoby, Sir  Thomas</span>  (1530&#150;1566), <span class="occ">courtier and translator</span>, was born at Leominster, Herefordshire, the second son of William Hoby, of Radnor, and his second wife, Katherine, daughter of John Forden. He matriculated pensioner from St John's College, Cambridge, on 20 May 1545 and studied for the next two years under John Cheke. In August 1547 he left without taking a degree, spending almost a year in Strasbourg as a guest of Martin Bucer, studying classics and theology. His first translation was <span class="italic">The Gratulation of M. Martin Bucer unto the Church of England</span> (1549). After returning to Britain he was introduced at court at Christmas 1550. The following May he went to France in the train of William Parr, marquess of Northampton, who invested the French king with the Order of the Garter. A convinced protestant, Hoby remained overseas for much of Queen Mary's reign. His &#145;Travels and Life&#146; (1551&#150;64) shows him to be an interested and perceptive participant in aristocratic life abroad. Out of that experience came his translation of Castiglione's <span class="italic">Il cortegiano</span>, done in Paris in 1552&#150;3 and published in 1561. Besides setting the standards of social behaviour for the English cultivated public, <span class="italic">The Courtier</span> left a profound mark on Elizabethan literary and stylistic practice, and Hoby's elegantly sober style was to influence Royal Society prose.<br>
<br>On the death of his half-brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13413/', "Sir Philip Hoby")</script>, in May 1558 Hoby inherited Bisham Abbey, Berkshire, and on 27 June married Elizabeth (1528&#150;1609) [<i>see </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13411/', "Russell, Elizabeth")</script>], daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/6155/', "Sir Anthony Cooke (1505/6&#150;1576)")</script>. They took up residence at Bisham on 8 July 1559, and spent the next six years extending the buildings. His first son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13410/', "Edward Hoby")</script>, was born on 20 March 1560, and on 27 May 1562, &#145;was my wief delivered of a wenche (Elizabeth)&#146;  (&#145;Travels&#146;, 129). Their second daughter, Anne, was born on 16 November 1564. Both girls died in February 1571. Hoby was knighted at Greenwich on 9 March 1566, and was appointed ambassador to France at the end of the month. When he landed at Calais on 9 April, a soldier at the town gate put two shots through the English flag. Hoby demanded an apology, which was grudgingly given, but he was not permitted to inspect the fortifications built after the French had recaptured the town in 1558. He died in Paris on 13 July 1566, and was buried on 2 September in Bisham parish church, where a monument was erected to his memory. His second son, Thomas Posthumous Hoby, was born after his death.<br>
