<span class="headword">Perceval, Sir  Philip</span>  (1605&#150;1647), <span class="occ">politician</span>, was the younger of the two sons of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21914/', "Richard Perceval (c.1558&#150;1620)")</script> of Sydenham, Somerset, and his second wife, Alice, daughter of John Sherman of Ottery St Mary, Devon. He succeeded his father and brother as clerk and registrar to the commissioners of the Irish wards, a post which he held in sole right after 1624. In the late 1620s and 1630s Perceval became feodary and escheator in co. Limerick and clerk of the court of wards in Munster, and he used his position to lease wards' lands at low rates, lending the profits to local families in return for mortgages. His moneylending schemes were extremely lucrative, as Old English debtors, unable to pay the sums due, were forced to surrender their estates. The Barrys, MacCarthys, O'Callaghans, and Roches all fell victim to Perceval's designs, and by 1641 nearly 100,000 English acres in Munster&#151;yielding rents in excess of &pound;4000&#151;had come into his possession. Financial success brought social acceptability, helped by his marriage on 16 October 1626 to Katherine, daughter of the well-connected Dublin official Arthur Ussher. He also became a friend of other acquisitive New Englishmen in Munster, including the first earl of Cork and Sir William St Leger.<br>
<br>In the 1630s Perceval's prospects improved still further with his successful attempt to court the favour of the new lord deputy, Viscount Wentworth. By early 1634 he had become friendly with two of Wentworth's closest advisers, Sir Philip Mainwaring and Sir George Radcliffe. In 1636 he was admitted to King's Inns, Dublin; in the same year he was knighted by the lord deputy at Dublin before accompanying him to England. In the later 1630s Perceval aided Wentworth's schemes to find royal title to lands, preparatory to plantation, in Connaught, Munster, and the Byrnes country in co. Wicklow, in which he and other government lackeys also benefited. With the fall of Wentworth in 1640&#150;41, Perceval's part in these irregular land deals was exposed, and he narrowly avoided prosecution in England (&#145;among those whose actions are re-examined and reflected upon&#146;; <span class="italic">Egmont MSS</span>, 1.142) in September 1641.<br>
<br>The execution of Wentworth did not, however, leave Perceval entirely without allies. A particularly useful patron was the twelfth earl of Ormond, whose business associations with Perceval dated back to 1631, and who had used him as guarantor of his debts in March 1641. After the outbreak of rebellion in Ireland in October 1641 Ormond repaid the favour by commissioning Perceval first as captain of firelocks in his own regiment, and then as commissary-general of the victuals. In turn Perceval, who had travelled to England in the winter of 1641&#150;2, defended Ormond against accusations of colluding with the Catholic rebels, raised by parliamentarians suspicious of his Old English ethnicity.<br>
<br>In the meantime the Irish rising had spread to Munster, where resistance was mounted by Perceval's old friends the earl of Cork, Sir William St Leger, and St Leger's son-in-law, Lord Inchiquin. Perceval's lands were overrun, with his castles at Liscarroll and Annagh holding out until September 1642. It was the local crisis, and the fear that the onset of civil war in England would prevent any further aid to the protestants in Ireland, which encouraged him to support negotiations which led to a truce with the Catholic confederates in September 1643. In March 1644 he was chosen as one of four agents sent by Ormond to Oxford to turn the cessation into a permanent peace. Yet Perceval and his colleagues found that many prominent courtiers (including Prince Rupert) supported the demands of the confederates, and in reaction they were vociferous in their opposition to peace on easy terms. This brought condemnation from many at Oxford. As Radcliffe told Ormond in June 1644: &#145;Perceval &hellip; had gone here for a roundhead if your excellency had not recommended him as he did&#146;  (Bodl. Oxf., MS Carte 11, fol. 175). Perceval had left Oxford at the end of the month, but instead of returning to Dublin, he stayed with friends in Hertfordshire. In August, following the defection to parliament of the Munster forces led by Lord Inchiquin, Perceval went to London, where he too embraced the parliamentarian cause.<br>
<br>From 1645 until his death in 1647 Perceval was a crucial figure in Anglo-Irish politics. He was on good terms with Inchiquin in Munster, and at Westminster sided with those Irish protestant MPs aligned with the presbyterian party, especially Sir Robert King, Sir John Clotworthy, and William Jephson. Perceval also remained on good terms with Ormond, and was an important part of the network which kept open lines of communication between Dublin and London. The rival Independent party, who were suspicious of Ormond and Inchiquin, recognized Perceval as a threat, and from the autumn of 1645 mounted a vigorous campaign to discredit him, reminding the parliamentarians that he had supported the 1643 cessation, and hinting that he had come to Westminster &#145;with the king's leave, and acted for him here ever since&#146;, and stating that he was &#145;so engaged to Lord Ormond that he was not capable of public employment&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont MSS</span>, 1.279, 353&#150;4). Such attacks did not deter Perceval from acting as intermediary between parliament and Ormond in their abortive peace talks in the autumn of 1646, or in defending Inchiquin against Independent attacks in the winter of 1646&#150;7.<br>
<br>Perceval's stance on Irish affairs recommended him to the leaders of the presbyterian party, and as early as March 1647 there were moves to secure him a seat in parliament. His election on 19 May to the Cornish borough of Newport was probably on the interest of Thomas Gewen MP, who was recorder of the nearby town of Launceston. Perceval's arrival in the Commons caused a storm of protest from the Independents, who reminded the house on 2 June that he had supported the cessation and was a &#145;special confidant of the Lord of Ormond&#146;  (<span class="italic">Egmont MSS</span>, 1.411, 413). A further attack came on 5 July, when the Independents were narrowly defeated in an attempt to disable any member who had supported the 1643 cessation. This assault was interrupted by the &#145;forcing&#146; of the houses in late July and early August, when a presbyterian mob invaded parliament. Perceval remained at Westminster during this period, and supported attempts to defend London against the New Model Army. The victory of the army and their Independent allies heightened the danger to Perceval, and by the end of August he had withdrawn from the Commons, staying with friends such as the earl of Suffolk and William Jephson outside London, and preparing his defence against any impeachment proceedings initiated by his enemies. Before he could vindicate himself, however, Perceval fell ill, and died in London on 10 November 1647. He was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields, with a funeral sermon preached by his wife's kinsman Primate Ussher. Through his eldest son, John Perceval, he was the ancestor of the earls of Egmont.<br>
