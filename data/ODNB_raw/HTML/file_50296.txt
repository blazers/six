<span class="headword">Jackson,  Nicholas Lane</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Pa Jackson]</span>  (1849&#150;1937), <span class="occ">sports administrator</span>, was born on 1 November 1849 at 14 Southgate Road, De Beauvoir Town, Middlesex, the son of Nicholas Lane Jackson, a cheesemonger, and his wife, Mary Prior. His family had a long association with the west country. He grew up in London, and was interested in a wide range of sporting activities from an early age. Educated privately, he had intended to join the army, but a change in his family's financial circumstances led to his becoming a journalist instead. He married on 20 January 1869 Mary Ann, the daughter of Frank Williams, licensed victualler; by 1881 they had three sons and a daughter. At various times in the late 1860s and early 1870s he was a member of the London rifle brigade, played cricket for Devon, made a balloon ascent, fished, walked long distances, beagled, ran with the Thames hare and hounds and the London athletic club, and played association football for Upton Park. In addition, like many middle-class sportsmen of the period, he had a strong interest in amateur dramatics.<br>
<br>As well as competing, Jackson was involved in organizing and administering several different sports. In December 1866 he founded the Mutual Improvement Society in Edmonton, then a rapidly developing north London suburb. In the early 1870s, following his marriage, he lived in Finchley, where he founded an association football club, a cross-country running club, and a boxing club, and revived the local cricket club. In 1879 he was the organizer of the Finchley athletic sports. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, as he later recalled, Saturday afternoons off had yet to become customary&#151;so permission was sought from the local vicar to play games on Sunday afternoons instead.<br>
<br>It was through his involvement with association football that Jackson became best known to the sporting public. In 1879 he was elected to the committee of the Football Association (FA), and he served as its assistant honorary secretary in 1881. He founded the London FA in 1882, became a member of the FA council in 1883, and in 1884 served on the FA subcommittee that recommended the removal of the bar on professionalism&#151;a proposal adopted in 1885. In 1886 he was elected to the FA's international board, which gave him responsibility for the selection of international teams, a role he performed concurrently for the Lawn Tennis Association. He was a respected and influential writer on both sports.<br>
<br>In 1882, following a run of defeats for England in association football internationals against Scotland, Jackson founded the Corinthian Football Club, with the intention of providing an opportunity for leading amateurs to play together outside international matches. Membership was formally limited to the fifty leading amateurs of the day; but from the beginning the club was also socially exclusive, and members were invariably former public school or university players. After professionalism in the sport was legalized, the Corinthians quickly became the symbolic leaders of the amateur game, and their clashes with leading professional teams were eagerly anticipated by the sporting public. Jackson was the club's honorary secretary for seventeen years. As the Corinthian Casuals (following amalgamation with the Casuals in 1939) they remain, in the early twenty-first century, England's most famous amateur club.<br>
<br>In addition to the Corinthians, Jackson had long been associated with the organization of &#145;scratch&#146; teams of amateur players, brought together for exhibition matches, often played against professional sides, with the gate money being given to good causes. Jackson helped to raise considerable sums for the Poplar Hospital, of which Rowland Hill, a rugby football administrator and writer, was also a patron. On one trip with a scratch team composed of Cambridge University players he was nicknamed Pa by the younger generation, and he was widely known as such thereafter. In 1894, by which time Jackson was a vice-president of the FA, the FA committee, in response to allegations of improper payments to amateurs, ruled that such scratch teams could not be formed without prior official permission. Jackson viewed this as unnecessarily restrictive, and resigned from the FA in protest; thereafter he gradually withdrew from involvement with the professional game.<br>
<br>Instead, Jackson directed his sporting enthusiasm elsewhere, and became involved with a variety of commercial sporting ventures. He had already founded the journals <span class="italic">Pastime</span> (in 1883) and the <span class="italic">Cricket Field</span> (1892), and in 1893 he became managing director of the Sports Club&#151;a London club founded by a group of aristocratic sportsmen which included Sir John Astley. Jackson was regarded as a leading authority on many sports, and was visited by Baron Pierre de Coubertin when he visited Britain in 1894 as part of his campaign to revive the Olympic games. Jackson was involved with the design of several golf courses in Britain and France, including the development of Le Touquet as a leisure resort, a scheme which included among its financial supporters de Coubertin and Grand Duke Michael of Russia. Following the success of Le Touquet, Jackson attempted to introduce the concept of the country club to Britain, and chose a site at Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire. Initially the project was successful; Edward VII visited in 1910, and by July 1914 the club had 900 full and 200 day members. But the war intervened, and Jackson's interests were diverted elsewhere: he became assistant director of the food production department. After 1918 the club was left in a precarious financial position, and Jackson eventually sold his interest in 1928.<br>
<br>Jackson continued his involvement with a variety of sports into his eighties: judging athletic competitions, serving on local and national golfing associations, driving motor cars, and playing golf. He continued to write books and articles until his death from pneumonia on 24 October 1937 at Avondale, Hermosa Road, Teignmouth, Devon. In his autobiography, <span class="italic">Sporting Days and Sporting Ways</span>, published five years earlier, he had written that he had enjoyed a &#145;longish life which thanks largely to sport has been a healthy one and a happy one&#146;.<br>
