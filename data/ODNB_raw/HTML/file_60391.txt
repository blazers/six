<span class="headword">Birley,  Eric Barff</span>  (1906&#150;1995), <span class="occ">historian and archaeologist</span>, was born on 12 January 1906 at his parents' home, The Poplars, Worsley Road, Swinton, Manchester, Lancashire, the youngest of four sons (there were also two daughters) of Joseph Harold Birley (<i>b</i>. 1870), a Manchester businessman, and his wife, Edith Gladys Fernandes Lewis. He was educated at Clifton College and at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he read <i>literae humaniores</i> (Greats). After graduating in 1928 he was appointed to a teaching post at Armstrong College, Newcastle upon Tyne, from which he transferred to a lectureship at Durham University in 1931. He held a readership from 1943 to 1956 (during which period he was also vice-master and master of Hatfield College) and professor of Romano-British history and archaeology in 1956, a chair that he held until his retirement in 1971. Honours included election as FSA in 1931 and FBA in 1969, the appointment as MBE in 1943, honorary doctorates at the universities of Heidelberg, Freiburg im Breisgau, and Leicester, an honorary fellowship of Brasenose College, and presidency of the Dumfriesshire and Galloway Society and of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne.<br>
<br>The early intellectual and academic influences on Birley were his Brasenose tutor in ancient history, Michael Holroyd, and R. G. Collingwood, who leavened his philosophical activities with an interest in the history and particularly the epigraphy of Roman Britain. Birley's academic career was founded on a central preoccupation with matters archaeological. His interest in the area of Hadrian's Wall had been aroused by Collingwood, who was to inaugurate the standard corpus of Romano-British inscriptions. Birley's early work included studies of imported Roman Samian pottery and excavations at Housesteads, Birdoswald, and Vindolanda. It was at the last site that he purchased the house at Chesterholm which had once belonged to the nineteenth-century antiquary Anthony Hedley. These interests remained constant and central throughout his career; his influential views on the date of the Roman withdrawal from Scotland in the early years of the second century <span class="smallcap">AD</span>, before the building of Hadrian's Wall, were founded on his study of the Samian pottery.<br>
<br>The advent of the war, which took some toll of Birley's health and stamina, brought a position in which he worked in military intelligence, with a particular interest in the structure of the German military command. His experience here was to be influential in steering his interests in a slightly different direction, although in an area in which he had long shared an interest with his friend and distinguished contemporary Ronald Syme, later Camden professor of ancient (Roman) history at Oxford. The two main areas of Birley's contribution to ancient history in the mature years of his career are perhaps best illustrated by two activities of the year 1949. He took a leading role in organizing the first International Congress of Roman Frontier Studies, which took place in Durham and initiated a regular series of such conferences; his formative role was recognized in 1974, when he was elected honorary life president of the Congress of Roman Frontier Studies. In 1949 he also wrote an influential paper on career patterns of the equestrian officers of the Roman army, in which he examined the principles of selection and advancement using, above all, the evidence of inscriptions and prosopographical methods  (<span class="italic">Durham University Journal</span>, December 1949, 8&#150;19). This was to be followed in 1954 by a comparable treatment of the careers of senators in the emperor's service, in which he suggested that evidence for posts early in the career indicated some degree of preselection of those destined for important military commands and the consulship  (<span class="italic">PBA</span>, 39, 1954, 197&#150;214).<br>
<br>For more than half a century and well into his retirement years Birley was a leading figure in Romano-British history, archaeology, and epigraphy, though his interests were by no means confined to Roman Britain. He produced academic work of high standards and lasting value, including <span class="italic">Research on Hadrian's Wall</span> (1961) and articles which were collected in two major anthologies, <span class="italic">Roman Britain and the Roman Army</span> (1953) and <span class="italic">The Roman Army: Papers, 1929&#150;86</span> (1988). That he never wrote a single magisterial work of historical synthesis, of which many thought him capable, should not indicate lack of influence or historical vision. These qualities are emphasized by the fact that he was widely thought of, both in Britain and northern Europe, particularly Germany and the Danube lands, where many of his closest academic friends and kindred spirits worked, as the founding figure of a &#145;school&#146; of pupils engaged at Durham and Newcastle in the study of Romano-British archaeology, military history, and applied epigraphy. Many of these went on to enjoy distinguished academic careers. If he inspired loyalty in his pupils, which he certainly did, he was not the man to shy away from expressing his views forthrightly. His avowedly severe review  (<span class="italic">Journal of Roman Studies</span>, 56, 1966) of the first volume of <span class="italic">Roman Inscriptions of Britain</span> (1966), published under the joint editorship of R. G. Collingwood and R. P. Wright, took the study to task on a host of details and for failure to exploit and apply the results of epigraphical research by treating inscriptions as historical documents. It indicated, as many of his colleagues well knew, that Birley commanded a mine of detailed information and historical insight, much of which was to remain unpublished.<br>
<br>Birley married Margaret Isabel (Peggy) Goodlet, daughter of the Revd James Goodlet, minister of Forest Hall Presbyterian Church, Northumberland, on 5 April 1934. They had two sons, both of whom followed their father's professional interests. The elder, Robin, excavated at Vindolanda, as his father had done, and was responsible for the important discovery of the Vindolanda writing tablets; the younger, Anthony, held chairs of ancient history at the universities of Manchester and D&uuml;sseldorf and wrote, among other things, biographies of three Roman emperors, Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius, and Septimius Severus. Eric Birley spent his final years living with his wife in close proximity to their elder son, Robin, at Carvoran, where the latter had established a &#145;museum of the Roman army&#146;. He died at home at Carvoran House, Carvoran, Greenhead, Northumberland, on 20 October 1995.<br>
