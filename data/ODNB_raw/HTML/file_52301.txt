<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Moore,  Robert Frederick Chelsea <span class="st"> [Bobby]</span></span>  (1941&#150;1993), <span class="occ">footballer</span>, was born in Upney Hospital, Barking, Essex, on 12 April 1941, the only son of Robert Edward Moore, a railway signalman, and his wife, Doris Joyce, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Buckle. He was brought up in a typical street of working-class housing at 43 Waverley Gardens, Barking. After Barking primary school he passed the eleven-plus examination to the Tom Hood Grammar School in Leyton. Although not an outstanding schoolboy footballer&#151;indeed at one time it seemed he might be a more successful cricketer&#151;he had already been noticed by West Ham United and was taken to Upton Park for training. There he met and was influenced by Malcolm Allison, Malcolm Musgrove, Noel Cantwell, and his manager at West Ham in the 1960s, Ron Greenwood&#151;all of whom taught the importance of ball control, accurate distribution, and intelligent movement. As a young man he was also impressed by Ray Barlow, the cultured left half of West Bromwich Albion, by the penetrating passing of Johnny Haynes, and by the spectacular athleticism of Duncan Edwards, whom he once played truant from school to watch at Tottenham. He signed a professional contract with West Ham at the age of seventeen and played his first match for the first team against Manchester United in 1958. It took two years to earn a regular first-team place, after which he became the first footballer to experience the iconic status of the other stars of 1960s popular culture. On 30 June 1962 he married Christina Elizabeth Dean (<i>b</i>. 1942/3); they had a son and a daughter.<br>
<br>Moore had already played eighteen times for the England youth team and eight more for the under-twenty-threes when at twenty-one he was chosen for the squad which went to the world cup in Chile in 1962. He returned an established international, having played in all four matches against Argentina, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Brazil. When Alf Ramsay became England manager in 1963, Moore became both captain and the second central defender in the new manager's new system. Their partnership was the key to one of the most successful periods for any England team. The world cup was won at Wembley on 30 July 1966, England finished third in the European championship in Italy in 1968, and in the 1970 world cup in Mexico England reached the quarter-finals, in which they played some of the most impressive football before losing 3&#150;2 to West Germany after being two goals up. Moore had been voted player of the tournament in 1966 and appointed OBE in 1967, but was probably at his peak in 1970, when he gave a particularly assured performance against Brazil in Guadalajara which led Pele to say that he was the most accomplished defender against whom he had played. His international reputation was symbolized by a famous photograph of his exchange of shirts with the world's leading player after the match. Between 1962 and 1973 Moore played 108 times for England, 90 as captain. Of those 90 games 57 were won, 20 drawn, and only 13 lost.<br>
<br>Yet success at club level proved elusive. The West Ham of the 1960s, often containing three members of England's world cup-winning team, could play exciting and effective football. They won the FA cup in 1964 and Moore was elected footballer of the year; they took the European cup winners' trophy in 1965, but they never finished higher than eighth in the first division. Local wags characterized the team as &#145;erratic as dock work&#146;. Moore was disappointed not to win a league championship and annoyed that West Ham refused to release him when real contenders such as Brian Clough's Derby County and Tottenham made serious offers. Though an admirer of Greenwood's footballing philosophy, he was not always impressed by his signings or, as he got older, by his man management. Greenwood in turn sometimes suggested that Moore concentrated harder for England than he did for West Ham, and it seems clear that Moore relished the stiffer challenges of the international game.<br>
<br>Moore eventually completed 1000 senior games, including 544 for West Ham and 124 for Fulham, whom he joined in March 1974. Ironically he found himself playing for Fulham against West Ham in the 1975 cup final, when West Ham won. He also played briefly for Herning Football Club in Denmark and San Antonio Thunder and the Seattle Sounders in the United States. After his retirement he was expected to have a successful career in football management, but it never happened. Brief spells at Oxford City (1978&#150;81) and Southend United (1983&#150;6) ended in disappointment. It is worth noting that the only member of the England world cup-winning team to succeed as a manager was Jack Charlton, perhaps providing support for the well-worn footballing clich&eacute; that good players do not necessarily make good managers.<br>
<br>That Moore was a great footballer is beyond argument. His balance, timing, and anticipation, his ability both to win the ball with certainty and to deliver it to a team-mate tellingly far outweighed the lack of pace which severe critics pointed to as a fatal flaw. Moreover his skill reflected an unruffled temperament as well as intelligence. In the world cup of 1970 he played the game of his life against Brazil, when only a few days before he had been under house arrest in Bogot&aacute;, his training watched by local policemen after he had been unjustly accused of stealing a gold bracelet from a shop. On the field he rarely appeared flustered or hurried, his play a byword for style, poise, and sportsmanship. If, in the late 1960s or 1970s, a recreational footballer won a tackle at the back and then strode forward, chest out, looked up and attempted a 40 yard diagonal pass inside the opposing full-back, there would have been no doubt whom he was trying to imitate.<br>
<br>Life after football could never quite provide the same excitement or measurable achievement, though Bobby Moore's celebrity meant that he was in continual demand. A man who always enjoyed a drink, he part-owned pubs and clubs in east London, notably Mooros. He did coaching stints in Hong Kong and North Carolina and for three years from 1986 was sports editor of the <span class="italic">Sunday Sport</span>, perhaps the raunchiest of all the tabloids. In 1990 he joined Capital Radio as a football match analyst. He was also involved in a sports marketing and promotions company called Challenge, which went into liquidation in the early 1990s. Perhaps he needed longer to understand the ways of the business world. In 1986 Moore was divorced from his wife, Christina; on 4 December 1991 he married his partner Stephanie Parlane-Moore (<i>b</i>. 1948/9). In April 1991 he had an operation for suspected cancer of the colon. Only he and his closest family were aware that the disease was terminal. He continued his radio work until shortly before his death on 24 February 1993, at his home, 12 Seaton Close, Putney Heath, London.<br>
<br>This sad event produced a public reaction that was only partly related to the fact that Moore was still only fifty-one. The powerful televisual image of the England team captain lifting the world cup at Wembley on 30 July 1966 was engraved on the minds of many people who would not have thought of themselves as followers of football. The moment when he wiped his grimy, sweaty hands on his shorts so that he would not soil the white gloves worn by the queen as she presented the Jules Rimet trophy to him particularly forced itself into the collective memory. It also symbolized this polite, cool, and composed young man, who seemed to represent the best side of a sport not always noted for its sensitivity. Compared to many professionals, Moore was the epitome of fair play, a man of exemplary character both on and off the field. He was a good-looking but modest star and one with a powerful sense of team identity. He was anxious not to let anyone down and did not like those who did. He was a hero as the English like them, a captain who led by example to the last, epitomized by the courage and dignity he showed in the face of death.<br>
<br>Bobby Moore's many fans built a shrine of flowers, candles, cards, and scarves in West Ham's claret and blue colours at the gates of Upton Park, the first of many tributes paid to him. A memorial service was held in Westminster Abbey on 28 June; West Ham opened the Bobby Moore stand at Upton Park at a memorial match on 7 March 1994, and a bridge at Wembley Stadium was also named after him. This was followed in May 2007 by a statue at the new Wembley stadium. His widow, Stephanie Moore, set up the Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK, to support research into the disease which carried off &#145;football's greatest gentleman&#146; at such an early age.<br>
