<span class="headword">Sherlock,  Martin</span>  (<em>b. </em>before 1747, <em>d.</em> 1797), <span class="occ">traveller</span>, was a member, it is supposed, of the Kilkenny family of Sherlock. Nothing is known of his family background or of his early years. He was admitted at Trinity College, Dublin, on 1 November 1763, whence he graduated BA in 1768 and MA in 1773. About 1777 Sherlock became chaplain to Frederick Augustus Hervey, fourth earl of Bristol, and bishop of Derry, and under his patronage travelled extensively in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy between 1776 and 1778. The letters he wrote during his travels are dated from The Hague, Berlin, Dresden, Vienna, Rome, Naples, the Alps, and Ferney, where he visited Voltaire in April 1776. Twenty-seven of Sherlock's two hundred letters were published in Geneva and Paris in 1779 and in Neufch&acirc;tel in 1781 as <span class="italic">Lettres d'un voyageur anglois</span>. In the letters from Berlin, Sherlock described the Prussians as the Macedonians of Germany, but Frederick the Great, who read the book, took this in a sense complimentary to himself, and gave Sherlock an interview in Potsdam on 20 July 1779. An English translation by the Revd John Duncombe was published in London in 1780, before Sherlock's return from Europe and before it was known that he was in holy orders. A German version appeared in Leipzig in the same year. A second series of forty-four letters, <span class="italic">Nouvelles lettres</span>, was published in 1780 in Paris and London, then translated into English by Sherlock (who claimed, in the preface, that he wrote only for fame) and published in London in 1781 as <span class="italic">New Letters from an English Traveller</span>. This volume was Sherlock's first work in English and he warned the reader to be patient with his style, which, by now, was affected by writing in Italian and French. The letters contain impressions of Italy, Geneva, Lausanne, Strasbourg, Berlin, Germany, Senlis, and Paris, which he asserts that no traveller ever left without regret of some kind or another. Both volumes were well received in France and in Italy, where reviewers pointed out the originality and impartiality of Sherlock's observations, but had much less success in England than abroad. Sherlock noted the scant success the <span class="italic">Letters</span> received in England, even though, he claimed, he was forced to pay 2<i>s</i>. a book towards a fine binding in order to increase the prospect of their selling. If it had not been for the sale of 600 volumes in France within four weeks, Sherlock claimed, &#145;these books would have broken my heart&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 8.70). Thomas Carlyle, in the last of his ten-volume <span class="italic">History of Friedrich II of Prussia</span>, quotes largely from Sherlock's <span class="italic">Letters</span> to describe the encounter between Sherlock and Voltaire. About Sherlock's volume, Carlyle comments: the book &#145;is now little other than a Dance of Will-o'-wisps to us. A book tawdry, incoherent, indistinct, at once flashy and opaque, full of idle and exuberances&#151;as is the poor man himself&#146;  (Carlyle, 10.70). In the same year as the <span class="italic">Lettres</span>, Sherlock published in Naples, with some assistance from an Italian friend, the <span class="italic">Consiglio ad un giovane poeta</span>, of which Sherlock gave 400 copies to the bookseller Gregorio Settazi and instructed the marchese di Maccaroni to distribute the money arising from the sale to poor widows. The book was answered by Bassi, professor of Italian and English language in Paris, in <span class="italic">Observations sur les po&egrave;tes italiens</span>, Sherlock having compared the tragic poets of Italy with Shakespeare, with little advantage to the former. Bassi defends Dante, Tasso, Ariosto, Petraica, Chiabreta, and Macini against Sherlock's observations. A portion of the <span class="italic">Consiglio</span> was translated into French by M. D. R. as <span class="italic">Fragment sur Shakspeare, tir&eacute; des conseils &agrave; un jeune po&egrave;te</span>, published in Paris in 1780. An English translation from the French was published in London in 1786. The English translator, the Revd John Duncombe, claimed that Sherlock's digression on Shakespeare in the <span class="italic">Consiglio</span> is the only interesting part of the work (hence the <span class="italic">Fragment</span>). Another English version of the <span class="italic">Fragment</span>, translated by John Nichols, was republished, together with the two series of <span class="italic">Letters</span>, in London in 1802. In 1781 Sherlock wrote a volume of thirty <span class="italic">Letters on Several Subjects</span>, on subjects including Shakespeare, Richardson, Frederick the Great, Voltaire, &#145;Mr. Sherlock&#146;, wit, genius, taste, judgement, delicacy, the French, and women. His former works had all been dedicated to the earl of Bristol, and this was dedicated to the countess. This volume was followed in a few months by a second, dedicated to the earl of Bristol and containing thirty-nine letters.<br>
<br>Sherlock hoped, through the influence of the several authorities and courts he had frequented, to obtain a diplomatic post, and he was spoken of in 1781 as secretary to the embassy in Vienna. He was seen during this season in the salons of Mrs Montagu and Lady Lucan; and Horace Walpole, who was acquainted with Sherlock, wrote of him in 1780:<blockquote>I am far from guessing why Mr Sherlock does not write in his own language &hellip; I should think everybody in this age could write best in his own &hellip; Mr Sherlock's Italian is ten times worse than his French, and more bald. He by no means wants parts, but a good deal more judgment. (<span class="italic">Letters of Horace Walpole</span>, 8.158)</blockquote>Although Sherlock was disappointed in his expectations of a diplomatic career, his merits were, in some degree, rewarded in Ireland, his native country, where he was appointed surrogate to the united dioceses of Killala and Achonry on 9 October 1781, and obtained through his friend Dr Perry, bishop of Killala, the united vicarages of Castlecomer and Kilglass (13 November 1782). In a letter dated 13 June 1781 written in Limerick to a friend in London, Sherlock complained about his living of &pound;200 a year given by the bishop of Killala prior to Sherlock's appointment in 1781. In the letter he asks his friend to put an announcement in four newspapers stating that he was in fact receiving &pound;400 a year. Sherlock believed that making the public know of his income would encourage the sale of his books in England: &#145;the world is very apt (God bless it) to value a man's writings according to his rank and fortune&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Lit. anecdotes</span>, 8.71&#150;2). On 24 March 1788 Sherlock was appointed by John Law (<i>d</i>. 1810), his last patron (bishop of Killala from 10 November 1787, and afterwards bishop of Elphin, 27 March 1795), to the rectory and vicarage of Skreen, and on 28 October in the same year he was collated to the archdeaconry of Killala. In Ireland, Sherlock felt cut off from the world and expressed his frustrations in a letter dated 21 January 1782 from Ballina:<blockquote>The Booksellers in London <i>have given</i>, and to my knowledge <i>do give</i>, very considerable annual sums to men of talents to write for them. I think I could write as well as most men who have written in prose within the century. One great advantage I have over almost all of them, not excepting Dean Swift or Dr. Johnson; I mean a superior education. (ibid., 8.75)</blockquote>Sherlock died in Ireland in 1797.<br>
