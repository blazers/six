<span class="headword">Sempill,  Hew</span>, twelfth Lord Sempill  (1688&#150;1746), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, was born after 16 May 1688, probably at Castle Sempill, Renfrewshire, the fifth son of Francis Abercromby (1654&#150;1703) of Fetterneir, Aberdeenshire, who was created Lord Glasfoord for life on 5 July 1685, and his wife, Anne, <i>suo jure</i> Lady Sempill (<i>d</i>. 1695), ninth holder of the title. The children of the marriage (five sons and a daughter) all carried their mother's surname.<br>
<br>Sempill entered the army as an adjutant in the 26th regiment of foot (the Cameronians) on 1 December 1708. He was made an ensign in July 1709 and served at the battle of Malplaquet that year. He was promoted captain on 12 July 1712, and placed on half pay in 1713, but he returned to active service by a supplementary commission of 26 September 1715 as captain of a newly raised company in his old regiment.<br>
<br>Sempill was promoted major on 5 April 1718 and in Manchester on 13 May 1718 he married Sarah (<i>d</i>. 1749), coheir and daughter of Nathaniel Gaskell of Manchester. They had five sons and six daughters. Although he succeeded to the peerage on the death of his brother John, eleventh Lord Sempill, in February 1727 he remained in the army. After twenty-three years' service with the Cameronians he transferred to the 19th regiment of foot (the Green Howards) as lieutenant-colonel on 12 July 1731. Lord Sempill sold the estates of Eliotstoun and Castle Sempill in 1727 and in 1741 bought the estate of North Bar, also in Renfrewshire.<br>
<br>On 14 January 1741 Sempill succeeded John Lindsay, twentieth earl of Crawford, as colonel of the Black Watch, then the 43rd foot. In 1743 the regiment, originally raised to keep watch in the highlands, received orders to proceed south to England; and when a rumour reached the soldiers in London that they were to be sent to the West Indies, they immediately began to return to Scotland, but were overtaken and compelled to turn back. Their destination was Flanders, and there, under Lord Sempill, they specially distinguished themselves in the defence of the town of Aeth when it was besieged by the French.<br>
<br>On 25 April 1745 Sempill was appointed colonel of the 25th foot (the King's Own Scottish Borderers); he was present at Fontenoy later that summer. At the battle of Culloden on 16 April 1746 his regiment occupied a place in the second line on the left wing where it was heavily engaged in repulsing the charge of the Jacobite army. He was appointed governor of Barbados in 1746 but did not take office.<br>
<br>Sempill died (following an operation on his arm) at Aberdeen on 25 November 1746, while in command of the troops stationed there. He was buried in West Church, Aberdeen, on 1 December. His eldest son, John (<i>d</i>. 1782), succeeded to the peerage.<br>
