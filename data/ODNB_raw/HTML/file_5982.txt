<span class="headword">Colomi&egrave;s,  Paul</span>  (1638&#150;1692), <span class="occ">writer and librarian</span>, was born on 2 December 1638 at La Rochelle, France, the son of Jean Colomi&egrave;s, a doctor at La Rochelle. His family came from B&eacute;arn, but his grandfather J&eacute;rome was a minister of the Reformed church at La Rochelle. Colomi&egrave;s was sent to the academy of Saumur at the age of sixteen and was there taught Hebrew by Louis Cappel. He went to Paris in 1664, and became acquainted with Isaac Vossius, who took him to Holland. Colomi&egrave;s's first and most useful work, <span class="italic">Gallia Orientalis</span>, an account of the lives and writings of French scholars in Hebrew and other oriental languages, was published at The Hague in 1665. He intended to follow this with accounts of such scholars from other nations, but only <span class="italic">Italia et Hispania orientalis</span> was sufficiently advanced for publication, long after Colomi&egrave;s's death, at Hamburg in 1730. The rest of his output was prolific, and included <span class="italic">Rome protestante</span> (1677), an apology for the reformed faith, and <span class="italic">Theologorum presbyterianorum icon</span> (1682), in which his movement towards an episcopalian standpoint became clear.<br>
<br>Colomi&egrave;s remained at La Rochelle until 1681, but then moved to England, perhaps to visit Vossius, who had been there since 1670 and had become a canon of Windsor. Vossius's influence may have lain behind an introduction to Archbishop William Sancroft; Colomi&egrave;s was librarian at Lambeth Palace by 1684. As librarian he compiled a manuscript <span class="italic">Catalogus librorum bibliothecae Lambethanae a Paulo Colomesio Ecclesiae Anglicanae presbytero et bibliothecae curatore</span>. It is a list in shelf order of the more than 9000 books in the library. It also bears extensive corrections by Sancroft himself. He was thus, evidently, in Anglican orders, and became &#145;<i>Lecteur</i>&#146; in the new church established by Peter Allix in Jewin Street, Aldersgate, in 1686. He was licensed as a deacon by 9 October 1687. Some dissatisfaction with his advancement in the church (expressed in a letter to William Cave, Bodl. Oxf., MS Tanner 30, fol. 140) was remedied by his collation by the archbishop to the rectory of Eynesford in Kent on 15 November 1687. As Sancroft's librarian, he also compiled a catalogue of Isaac Vossius's manuscripts. This was published in the <span class="italic">Catalogus manuscriptorum Angliae et Hiberniae</span> (1697)&#151;though Vossius's manuscripts were in fact sold to Leiden. Colomi&egrave;s was naturalized in March 1688  (W. A. Shaw, ed. <span class="italic">Letters of Denization and Acts of Naturalization for Aliens in England and Ireland, 1603&#150;1700</span>, 1911, 204).<br>
<br>With Archbishop Sancroft's deprivation as a nonjuror in 1690, Colomi&egrave;s's appointment as Lambeth librarian came to an end. He had been ill for some time at the time of his death in London in January 1692. He made a will on 2 January 1692; it was proved on 8 January. The principal legatee was his cousin Peter Hamelot. The will does not mention the considerable library of books and papers which Colomi&egrave;s must have owned. The bookseller Paul Vaillant was one of the witnesses to the will, and there is a possibility that the books were dispersed abroad, though some annotated volumes survive in the British Library. Paul Colomi&egrave;s was buried in the churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields.<br>
<br>Colomi&egrave;s's books, beyond those already mentioned, consisted largely of collections of annotations on topics humanistic and patristic. Pierre Bayle's judgement was that he was able to profit from his extensive reading and to draw attention to many matters of interest  (Bayle, 904&#150;6). This view is supported by the posthumous reprinting of his works in London, Paris, and Amsterdam, and in particular by the (partial) collection of his <span class="italic">Opera theologici, critici et historici argumenti</span>, edited by J. A. Fabricius (1709).<br>
