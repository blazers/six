<span class="headword">Mordaunt <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Fraizer]</span>,  Carey</span>, countess of Peterborough and Monmouth  (<em>c.</em>1658&#150;1709), <span class="occ">political wife, and correspondent of John Locke</span>, was the daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/10058/', "Sir Alexander Fraizer, first baronet (1607?&#150;1681)")</script>, physician to Charles II, and his second wife, Mary Wylde, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Carey (<i>d</i>. 1695), later woman of the bedchamber to Catherine of Braganza. She was named after her maternal grandfather, Sir Ferdinando Carey. The Fraizers had followed Charles II into exile and Carey may have been born in Europe. After 1660 the Fraizers lived in Scotland Yard, London. With both her parents holding court office it is not surprising that, on 7 May 1674, Carey was appointed maid of honour to Queen Catherine. She soon gained a reputation for pride and ostentation. Her appearance at the queen's birthday ball of 2 November 1676 in a dress reportedly worth &pound;300 was said to have frightened her suitor, Sir Carr Scroope, who apparently claimed &#145;his estate will scarce maintaine her in clothes&#146;  (Wilson, 29). Called &#145;a haughty lass&#146; and &#145;stately Carey&#146;  (ibid., 240&#150;41) in court lampoons, in December 1677 and again in 1679 she was accused of trying to become the king's mistress. In 1679 or 1680 Carey was secretly engaged to <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19162/', "Charles Mordaunt, second Viscount Mordaunt (1658?&#150;1735)")</script>, became pregnant and consequently, in May 1680, was &#145;marched off from court: how honorably time will try&#146;  (ibid., 241). On 22 May it was reported that &#145;the marriage between my Lord Mordaunt and Mrs Frazer will now be speedily consummated, the lady being discovered with child, and my lord seeming to own something of a contract&#146;  (ibid.). The marriage was, however, not publicly acknowledged until December 1681.<br>
<br>The Mordaunts lived at Parson's Green, Fulham, and Turvey, Bedfordshire. Lady Mordaunt's first child, John, Lord Mordaunt, was probably born towards the end of 1680, and she had at least four other children in the 1680s, of whom a son, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19164/', "Henry Mordaunt (1681?&#150;1710)")</script>, and daughter survived. Charles Mordaunt was a supporter of the revolution and Lady Mordaunt was with him in The Hague in 1689, when she began a correspondence with John Locke. Welcoming Locke's friendship and commenting on the revolution, she wrote that James II had gone &#145;out like a farding candele: and has given us by this convension an occasion not of amending the government: but of melting it downe and make all new&#146;  (<span class="italic">Correspondence of John Locke</span>, 3.538). Embarrassed by her writing, she added, &#145;i know my falts are so crose in wryting that tell i am convinct i hold you fast you shall have as fe&uuml; of my Letters as is possibel&#146;  (ibid.). Locke sent her advice on the education of her eldest son in 1690 and also recommended books for her own reading.<br>
<br>Countess of Monmouth from April 1689 and countess of Peterborough from June 1697, Carey was active in supporting her husband's political career, cultivating such friends as the earls of Shaftesbury and Sunderland, and the duke and duchess of Marlborough. She courted the Marlboroughs at first in hopes of a match for her son John, and later to help her husband, writing very complimentary letters to the duke and duchess, and encouraging the increasingly eccentric Lord Peterborough to remain on good terms with Marlborough. In 1707 Marlborough wrote to his wife that he had had an obliging letter from Lady Peterborough, which he would not send her &#145;since the hand is so ill it would hurt your eyes&#146;  (<span class="italic">Marlborough-Godolphin Correspondence</span>, 780). When her son John eloped in 1705 Lady Peterborough was, ironically given the circumstances of her own marriage, highly displeased. She wrote to Shaftesbury asking for help and threatening to leave John nothing in her will. &#145;O that heaven had left him no hand to dispose of!&#146; she complained  (Hayton, 923). For some time she remained unforgiving, and forbade John to go to Lord Peterborough, who was then overseas, but they were apparently reconciled before her death on 13 May 1709. She was buried in the family tomb in the parish church of Turvey.<br>
