<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Stewart,  John</span> <span class="st"> [<em>called </em>Walking Stewart]</span>  (1747&#150;1822), <span class="occ">philosopher and traveller</span>, was born on 19 February 1747 at 156 New Bond Street, London, the only child of Scottish parents, John and Margaret Stewart, linen drapers at the same address. He attended Harrow School from 1758 to 1761 and Charterhouse from 1761 to 1763, at both of which his character proved to be unconventional and subversive. As an early step in his plan to travel the world, &#145;to trace the causes of human misery and &hellip; welfare, and of determining how the latter might be brought to perfection&#146;  (<span class="italic">Life and Adventures</span>, 4), he went to Madras in 1763 to work as a writer with the East India Company.<br>
<br>Two years later Stewart resigned his post, moving on to work as interpreter and then as army general with Haidar Ali and his son Tippoo, rulers of Mysore, then to the court of the nabob of Arcot as private secretary and eventually as prime minister. Around the mid-1770s he began the first phase of his planned world tour by foot. Traversing the Indian interior, Stewart walked to the Persian Gulf, thence into Africa to southern Ethiopia and on into unmapped central Africa. After recrossing the Arabian desert, &#145;the only Man of Nature that ever appeared in the World&#146;, as he referred to himself in the subtitle of <span class="italic">The Moral or Intellectual Last Will and Testament of John Stewart</span> (1810), covered most Adriatic and Mediterranean nations before arriving in London in 1783. He travelled by foot wherever possible, never carried weapons, and lived as a vegetarian.<br>
<br>In 1784 the journeying recommenced. This time Stewart covered the length and breadth of Europe on foot, pushing his walk into northern Scandinavia and central Asia before returning to London. Here in the early 1790s he began to publish his curious doctrines on human nature. To forward these he would deliberately court notice by presenting himself in Armenian dress in public thoroughfares. Over 6 feet tall, powerfully built, and strikingly handsome, Stewart had no trouble engaging members of the public in conversation, an Ancient Mariner in the role of Socrates.<br>
<br>Disgusted with the reception of his ideas in Britain, Stewart set off for America in 1791. Seized with a corresponding disgust for American and Canadian incomprehension, he was soon back in England and nearly as soon again on the continent, walking around France. It was in Paris in 1792, just weeks before the execution of Louis XVI, that he met the poet Wordsworth, who was impressed by Stewart's conversational powers and political knowledge.<br>
<br>Following a spell of relative poverty in London, Stewart spent the mid- to late 1790s back in America and Canada, pursuing his transcontinental walks (pushing them into South America) and earning a little money by lecturing on his &#145;system&#146;. Back in Britain by 1800, he settled first in Bath and then, in 1803, in London, relentlessly and obsessively publicizing his philosophical ideas, especially after the payment of an outstanding claim of &pound;14,000 on the nabob of Arcot. He remained mostly in London for the rest of his bachelor life, writing, discoursing, pamphleteering, lecturing&#151;and walking&#151; until his death on 20 February 1822 in his Northumberland Street rooms, the scene of numerous, well-attended philosophical and musical evenings. The cause of death is unknown, though there is a chance that the ailing Stewart took his own life by overdosing on opium.<br>
<br>Stewart was a cultivated, genial if eccentric individual whose large circle of friends included politicians, writers, philosophers, and musicians. His erudition was expansive, and, with his fluent command of eight languages (and passing knowledge of many more), truly cosmopolitan. He was well enough known to have been the subject of a popular mass-produced watercolour, and to have been satirized on stage in the &#145;operatic farce&#146; <span class="italic">Hartford Bridge</span> (by &#145;Mr Pearce&#146;) in the 1800s. Problems over interpreting his will, however, meant that a bequest to Edinburgh University of about &pound;1000 to establish a lectureship in &#145;Intellectual Power&#146; had to be declined.<br>
<br>Most of Stewart's thirty or so books were printed and distributed privately; many appeared in duodecimo format, their small size intended to lend itself to portability and alfresco reading. They are curious compounds of geography, materialist philosophical speculation, extravagant moral rumination, occasional excursions into verse, and sundry unrelated harangues at the reader. Thomas De Quincey, a good friend, noted of him that while he &#145;was a man of genius&#146; he lacked the talent to communicate his ideas effectively  (<span class="italic">Collected Writings</span>, 3.117). Stewart's intellectual peers designated him a speculative atheist: his philosophical ideal comprises a sort of self-reflexive pantheism, free love, natural democracy, and perfectibilarianism.<br>
<br>Stewart's most significant books are <span class="italic">Travels over the Most Interesting Parts of the Globe, to Discover the Source of Moral Motion</span> (1790), &#145;Opus maximum&#146; (1803), and <span class="italic">The Roll of a Tennis Ball through the Moral World</span> (1812); thematically his whole opus endlessly revolves around the theme of philosophical atomism. Though most of Stewart's readers would agree with De Quincey that the former was probably &#145;crazy when the wind was at NNE&#146;  (<span class="italic">Collected Writings</span>, 3.111), the serious attempt to analyse and codify morality that lies behind the bizarre titles is easy to see. Having a horror of the imminent formation of some &#145;universal empire of revolutionary police terror&#146;  (Salt, 578), which would ban his books, Stewart urged recipients to translate them into Latin (a precaution against the supposed decay of the English language) and bury them 7 feet underground. Their locations would be passed down orally until the dawn of the age of the Stewartian man made their disinterment possible and necessary.<br>
