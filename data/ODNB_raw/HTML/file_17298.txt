<span class="headword">Lysons,  Samuel</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1763, <em>d.</em> 1819), <span class="occ">antiquary</span>, was baptized at Rodmarton, Gloucestershire, on 17 May 1763, the second son of Samuel Lysons (1730&#150;1804), rector of Rodmarton and Cherrington, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Mary (1734&#150;1791), daughter of Samuel Peach of Chalford in the same county. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/17296/', "Daniel Lysons (1762&#150;1834)")</script>, historical topographer, was his brother. His nephew Samuel Lysons (1806&#150;1877) was also an antiquary. After attending Bath grammar school Lysons was placed in June 1780 with a Bath solicitor named Jeffries. In October 1784 he went to London, having been previously entered at the Inner Temple, and began studying law under a Mr Walton. For several years he practised as a special pleader, and was therefore not called to the bar until June 1798, when he chose the Oxford circuit. In July 1796 he was introduced by Sir Joseph Banks to George III and the royal family, with whom he became a favourite. He was an excitable, vigorous, and ambitious man, with a loud voice and a penetrating eye. His friends included many leading personalities, such as Horace Walpole and Mrs Piozzi. Samuel Johnson met him and was impressed by him. In December 1803 he was appointed keeper of the records in the Tower of London and ceased practising law. Under his rule the staff was increased from one to six, and he did a considerable amount towards arranging the archives. He held the post until his death.<br>
<br>In November 1786 Lysons became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In November 1812 he was nominated one of the vice-presidents of the society, and from 1798 to 1809 he held the honorary office of director. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in February 1797, and was appointed vice-president and treasurer of the society in 1810.<br>
<br>Lysons was an artist of some skill, and between 1785 and 1796 was an occasional exhibitor at the Royal Academy of views of old buildings. He also contributed numerous etchings to his brother Daniel's <span class="italic">Environs of London</span>.<br>
<br>A field archaeologist much ahead of his time is revealed by the reports of the sites upon which Lysons worked, such as the Woodchester Roman pavement and other Roman sites, including Horkstow in Lincolnshire, Frampton in Dorset, Bignor in Sussex, and Bath. He was able to illustrate these reports quite lavishly. His greatest publication was the <span class="italic">Reliquiae Britannico-Romanae</span> (2 vols., 1801&#150;17), which was a survey of sites and finds in Roman Britain. He collaborated with his brother Daniel in producing <span class="italic">Magna Britannia</span>. In 1818, when the honorary office of antiquary professor was revived in the Royal Academy, Lysons was chosen to fill it. He died, unmarried, of heart failure on 29 June 1819, at Cirencester, Gloucestershire, and was buried on 5 July at Hempsted, for long the home of the Lysons family.<br>
