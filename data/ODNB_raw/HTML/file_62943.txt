<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Colum,  Padraic</span> <span class="st"> [<em>formerly </em>Patrick Collumb]</span>  (1881&#150;1972), <span class="occ">writer</span>, was born on 8 December 1881, in the parish of Collumbkille, co. Longford, in the midlands of Ireland, the eldest of the eight children of Patrick Collumb and his wife, Susan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> MacCormack, daughter of a gardener at Powerscourt, in co. Wicklow. His father was the last of an ancient line of peasant farmers, but a graduate of the national school and a teacher in the same institution, and later master of the Longford workhouse. Like his father he was christened Patrick, but after joining the Gaelic League and the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1901, he began using the Irish Gaelic Padraic, and changed his family name to Colum.<br>
<br>Colum took pride in maintaining that of his generation of Irish writers he alone was peasant-born and Roman Catholic; he also enjoyed telling people that he was born in a workhouse, but neglected to mention that his father was in charge of the place at the time. Colum's finest play, <span class="italic">Thomas Muskerry</span> (1910), is set in a workhouse, and many of the characters that people his poetry and stories are derived from his early acquaintance with the residents of such an institution. He also drew inspiration for story-telling from an uncle, Mickey Burns, a yarn-spinning, travelling wholesale buyer of fowls, with whom the young Colum sometimes rode through co. Cavan. His uncle had an increased influence on Colum when his alcoholic father, having lost his position in Longford, spent time in America trying unsuccessfully to accumulate some money. On his return to Ireland, Patrick Collumb moved the family to Sandy Cove, near Dublin, where he was employed as a railway clerk. In time he became stationmaster and employed Padraic and his brother Fred, later a soldier in the British army, as delivery boys.<br>
<br>At seventeen, and having had only eight years of formal education, Padraic Colum passed an examination for a clerkship in the Irish Railway clearing house in Kildare Street in Dublin. He was now able to contribute money to the family and help support his younger siblings. Despite working a nine-hour day (six days per week), he wrote poetry and plays, and was soon discovered by Arthur Griffith, publisher and Sinn F&eacute;in leader, and later first president of the Irish Free State.<br>
<br>Griffith became Padraic Colum's patron, publishing his poems and short plays in the <span class="italic">United Irishman</span>. One of the latter, <span class="italic">The Saxon Shillin'</span>, won a prize for a drama written to discourage young Irishmen from enlisting in the British army. As a result, Colum was invited by Frank and W. G. Fay to join the newly formed Irish National Dramatic Company as both playwright and actor; soon the company merged with the Irish Literary Theatre founded by W. B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, George Moore, and Edward Martyn. Under the new name, the Irish National Theatre Company, what became the great Irish National Theatre, the Abbey, was established.<br>
<br>Colum's first full-length play was <span class="italic">Broken Soil</span>, later rewritten and published as <span class="italic">The Fiddler's House</span> (1907). In it a middle-aged peasant farmer chooses life as an itinerant musician over obligations to his children and the land he works. His choice of art over property and a comfortable life is forcibly contrasted with the priorities of his grasping, mercenary peers. The play's chief strength is its authentic depiction of Irish rural character in the early 1900s.<br>
<br>Colum's second drama, <span class="italic">The Land</span>, opened at the newly acquired Abbey Theatre on 9 June 1905, and promptly gave that theatre its first real triumph. <span class="italic">The Land</span> also established the &#145;peasant play&#146; as a staple of the Irish National Theatre. Unfortunately the headstrong young playwright quarrelled with Yeats and the Fays, and despite Lady Gregory's attempt to reconcile the parties, Colum left the company. In 1910 the Abbey performed Colum's last commercially successful play, the tragedy <span class="italic">Thomas Muskerry</span>, which has been called the <span class="italic">King Lear</span> of Irish drama. Although Colum wrote plays for the rest of his life and always considered himself a playwright first, his continuing significance as a writer lay in poetry, folklore, and children's books.<br>
<br>Colum's first book of poetry, <span class="italic">Wild Earth</span> (1907), was well received for its sheer lyric beauty and simplicity, as well as for its strong characterizations of country folk, who lived according to the ancient ways with courage and nobility. <span class="italic">Wild Earth</span> is the foundation of Colum's poetic canon. It established his early reputation, and as long as he was emotionally, if not geographically, close to Ireland, his poetry was highly effective and well regarded. Yet from the time of its publication onward, Colum's stark, lucid, sympathetic vision of the Irish people slowly faded.<br>
<br>In 1912 Colum married Mary Gunning Maguire (1884&#150;1957), a woman born into the Sligo middle class, and a graduate of University College, Dublin. She was also a gifted writer who became a major literary critic in America. They had no children. Unable to earn a satisfactory livelihood as writers in Dublin, the couple &#145;accidentally&#146; emigrated to the United States in 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War. Josephine Colum, an aunt in Pittsburgh, had sent them money for a honeymoon trip to the United States as a gift at the time of their marriage, and the war prevented their return. They decided to settle in New York city, perceiving that, as a writing couple, there were more opportunities for them in New York than in Dublin. Later they undertook part-time teaching careers at Columbia University and New York University. In New York, Colum continued to write poetry and plays but earned his primary living as a writer of folklore and books for children. He produced a series of stories at this time for the children's column of the <span class="italic">New York Sunday Tribune</span>, and his first children's book, <span class="italic">The King of Ireland's Son</span>, was published to great acclaim in the United States in 1916; it was republished in Britain in 1920. Colum was to support himself financially throughout the rest of his life with his popular children's books, which included accessible adaptations and translations of mythology and the classics.<br>
<br>In 1916 <span class="italic">Wild Earth and other Poems</span> was published in New York and it established Colum as an important voice on the American poetry scene. The collection was revised and added to in 1922, 1927, and 1950. Two subsequent collections continued Colum's early lyric portrayal of Irish country life with some success: <span class="italic">Dramatic Legends and other Poems</span> (1922) and <span class="italic">Old Pastures</span> (1930).<br>
<br>In 1922 the Colums made a triumphant return visit to Ireland, expecting to see, among other friends, Arthur Griffith (with whose biography Colum later struggled and finally published as <span class="italic">Ourselves Alone</span> in 1959), who was now the free state's president. But news of Griffith's unexpected death and the death of Michael Collins reached the Colums on their ship, and they found Ireland in mourning, although the new president, William Cosgrave, received them with great cordiality. Colum had earlier published an Irish travel book entitled <span class="italic">My Irish Year</span> (1912), and after this Irish visit he was to produce his finest work in this vein, <span class="italic">The Road Round Ireland</span> (1924), which was in turn followed by <span class="italic">Cross Roads in Ireland</span> (1930).<br>
<br>After their stay in Ireland, the Colums went on to visit James Joyce and his wife in Paris, the first of several such visits in the 1920s and 1930s. Colum even typed some of <span class="italic">Finnegans Wake</span> for Joyce. Padraic and Mary Colum later collaborated on the highly regarded biographical memoir, <span class="italic">Our Friend James Joyce</span> (1958), and after his death in 1941 they generously raised and personally contributed funds to assist Nora Joyce.<br>
<br>Meanwhile the Hawaiian legislature had invited Colum to codify the folklore of the islands. His in-country investigations and research at the Bishop Museum resulted in <span class="italic">At the Gateways of the Day</span> (1924) and <span class="italic">The Bright Islands</span> (1925), reissued together as <span class="italic">Legends of Hawaii</span> (1937). His work was the key to the foundation of Hawaiian folklore studies.<br>
<br>In his middle years Colum's reputation as a poet faded and he failed utterly as a playwright. <span class="italic">Creatures</span> (1927) indicated that Colum had lost interest, temporarily at least, in writing poems about people, and <span class="italic">Poems</span> (1932) is a collection of previously published material. <span class="italic">The Story of Lowry Maen</span> (1937), Colum's longest poem, was an attempt at epic narrative, composed of over 1800 lines of blank verse about the break-up of Bronze Age order with the advent of Iron Age invaders. The poem is, however, distinguished neither in narrative nor in language, and is too close to a children's fairy tale to serve as a national epic. <span class="italic">Flower Pieces</span> (1938) offered lovely little descriptions of hollyhocks, morning glories, hibiscus, marigolds, and other decorative plants. It testifies to Colum's gentle nature and descriptive powers, and in the next year <span class="italic">The Vegetable Kingdom</span> gave the edibles equal poetical time with creatures and flowers. But it must be said that as Colum settled fully into the New York scene and the international literary set his poetry suffered. None of this later work served to advance his reputation, and it appeared that he had written all of his memorable poetry by the age of fifty. His collection <span class="italic">Ten Poems</span> (1957) did little to refute this assessment, with the exception of one poem, &#145;The Book of Kells&#146;, depicting the work of a medieval manuscript illuminator, which is one of his finest pieces. It presaged the skill and profundity that Colum would display in his last work.<br>
<br>Colum's desire for production of his plays tormented him for some fifty years. He became an experimental playwright, abandoning the naturalism and colloquial but eloquent language that had been the hallmark of his early success. <span class="italic">Theodora</span> (1912), based on the life of the Byzantine empress, went through several revisions and changes of title (including <span class="italic">The Bear Keeper's Daughter</span>) but was never produced or published. <span class="italic">The Grasshopper</span>, a free translation of a Keyserling play, was produced at the Abbey on 24 October 1922, to no great success. Later, the script was burnt in an Abbey fire. He wrote at least four versions of the same play: <span class="italic">The Desert</span>, <span class="italic">Timbuktu</span>, <span class="italic">The Vizier</span>, and <span class="italic">Mogu the Wanderer</span>. It had one brief run as <span class="italic">Mogu the Wanderer</span>, at the Dublin Gate Theatre from 29 December 1931 to 7 January 1932, but proved a complete failure. The audience and even the actors laughed at its pretentiousness. The play is remembered today only because Orson Welles made his stage d&eacute;but in the production. Colum had hoped for a Broadway production of the impressionistic <span class="italic">Balloon</span>, set in and around the glamorous world of a first-class cosmopolitan hotel called the Hotel Daedalus (perhaps in homage to Joyce). It was published in 1929 after a two-week run in a summer theatre in Ogunquit, Maine, but it never went to New York.<br>
<br>Colum also tried his hand at fiction, but his two novels, <span class="italic">Castle Conquer</span> (1923), a romance, and <span class="italic">The Flying Swans</span> (1957), a moving story of an Irish peasant boyhood in the nineteenth century, were not commercially successful.<br>
<br>In his old age Colum returned to Irish themes and found renewed celebrity. After his wife died in 1957 and he took her body back to Ireland, Colum divided his time between New York, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and Ireland. He renewed his bonds to his mother country, producing in a series of <span class="italic">Irish Elegies</span> (1958, 1961, 1963) powerful and poignant biographical poems centring on deceased friends who had contributed to the winning of Irish independence, or to the creation of Ireland's international reputation for art and literature. At the time of his death Colum was working on a cycle of Noh plays, influenced by Yeats's experimental dramas, and based on the classical Japanese performance form, Noh, which combines elements of dance, drama, music, and poetry into a highly stylized stage performance. His completed plays in this genre (<span class="italic">Moytura</span>, <span class="italic">Glendalough</span>, <span class="italic">Cloughoughter</span>, <span class="italic">Monasterboice</span>, and <span class="italic">Kilmore</span>, 1961&#150;6) achieved some success both as written poetry and in small productions performed by dancers.<br>
<br>Colum's final poetry collection, <span class="italic">Images of Departure</span> (1969), is a subtly crafted and moving collection of poems of farewell to much loved people, such as his wife and mother, and nostalgic tributes to favoured spots in Dublin. It also represents a farewell to Ireland, his memories, and his life. A remarkable achievement for an eighty-seven-year-old poet, <span class="italic">Images of Departure</span> is one of the finest Irish poetry collections of the last half of the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Padraic Colum died at the Parkway Pavilion, a nursing home in Enfield, Connecticut, on 11 January 1972, one month after his ninetieth birthday. His body was viewed at the Abbey Funeral Home in Manhattan, and a high mass of the resurrection was conducted at St Patrick's Cathedral. His body was returned to Ireland and interred in St Fintan's cemetery, Sutton, co. Dublin, in the same grave as his beloved wife.<br>
<br>Padraic Colum has long been recognized as an early contributor towards developing the Irish National Theatre, and as one of the significant Irish poets of the twentieth century. It is as a lyric poet that Colum will be best remembered. The beauty and discipline of his early and very late verse, his surety in characterization, and his unquestioning belief in God are the foundations of his achievement. His real monument is the last full collection: <span class="italic">The Poet's Circuits: Collected Poems of Ireland</span> (1960).<br>
<br>Colum conceptualized the early modern Irish poet as a peasant bard, a preserver of the oral tradition, a story-teller with dramatic skill, a codifier of mores, and a conveyer of cultural values. Unlike Yeats, Colum never philosophized deeply, being content to respond emotively in his poetry to his country, his wife, his friends, and the poor hardworking people of the rural Ireland of his youth. Today Colum's lyrics are read and memorized by thousands of Irish school children yearly, although often they do not learn or remember the author's name. Thus Padraic Colum has become both a national poet and an anonymous bard, exactly as he would have wished.<br>
