<span class="headword">Bargrave,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1610, <em>d.</em> 1680), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and collector of curiosities</span>, was baptized at Nonington, Kent, on 18 November 1610. His father, also named John, was the elder brother of Isaac Bargrave and had increased the family fortune derived from tanneries in east Kent by his marriage to Jane Crouch, the daughter of a prosperous London haberdasher. A year after the birth of John, his second son, he received a grant of arms and soon afterwards retired from his profession as a mercenary soldier to build the country house of Bifrons, at Patrixbourne, near Canterbury. As a younger son, Bargrave was destined to follow his uncle into the church. He attended the King's School, Canterbury, between 1623 and 1626, and proceeded in 1629 to Peterhouse at Cambridge where Isaac's close friend Matthew Wren was master. He served as college librarian between 1634 and 1636 and was admitted as a fellow in 1637. By this stage Wren had been succeeded by John Cosin, at Archbishop Laud's special behest. In the polarization of political and religious views that preceded the outbreak of the civil war, Bargrave held to the churchmanship and royalist loyalties of his Kentish connections. His uncle, as dean of Canterbury, took a lead in defending universities and cathedral chapters against the Long Parliament in 1641, and helped to rally the Kentish gentry to the king's support in 1642. Bargrave himself was caught up in the reprisals, being ejected from his fellowship in 1644.<br>
<br>From 1645 until the Restoration, Bargrave chose to spend most of his time travelling on the continent. From time to time he had charge of young fellow travellers from among his Kentish and Cambridge connections. The first of these journeys, which took place in 1646&#150;7, resulted in the first Italian guidebook published in the English language; it appeared under the name of his nephew John Raymond. The likelihood that Bargrave had a major part in this work is strengthened by the recent discovery of a manuscript journal of Bargrave's earlier French tour of 1645. Bargrave's periods of foreign residence, and particularly the four journeys to Rome that he undertook in 1647, 1650, 1655, and 1660, enabled him to collect numerous coins, curiosities, and small-scale antiquities. His subsequent comments in cataloguing them, together with his acute observations penned in the margins of a set of mounted prints of the College of Cardinals, provide innumerable piquant details about his life as a royalist exile.<br>
<br>With the Restoration Bargrave resumed his ecclesiastical career, though his longest foreign journey was still to come. In September 1662, simultaneously with his appointment as a canon of Canterbury, he took charge of a royal mission to ransom Christian slaves from the dey of Algiers; the mission, successfully concluded, allowed him to add a portrait of the dey and a mummified chameleon to his collection.<br>
<br>Bargrave's marriage in 1665 to Frances Osborne, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Wilde, a well-connected Kentish widow, was childless. Up to his death in Canterbury on 11 May 1680 he remained an active member of the cathedral chapter, compiling a survey of its revenues as receiver-general in 1675, and later serving as vice-dean. He was survived by his wife. Buried in Canterbury Cathedral, he had requested that the chains of one of the slaves whom he had redeemed be hung over his grave. His meticulously documented collection, housed originally in two cabinets and left to the dean and chapter in his will, has achieved a widespread reputation as the best preserved example of its kind in Britain.<br>
