<span class="headword">Lindo,  Abigail</span>  (1803&#150;1848), <span class="occ">lexicographer</span>, was born in London on 3 August 1803, the third daughter and fifth child of the eighteen children of David Abarbanel Lindo (1772&#150;1852), a prominent Jewish communal worker, and his wife, Sarah (1777&#150;1852), the daughter of Abraham Mocatta and his wife, Esther. Her parents were Sephardi Jews belonging to leading families established in London since the early years of the community in the seventeenth century. She was closely related to the best-known Sephardi Jewish families of the time; Sir Moses Montefiore (1784&#150;1885) was a cousin, and her uncle Ephraim Lindo was a brother-in-law of Disraeli's mother, Maria Basevi. (Her father performed Disraeli's circumcision on 28 December 1804.) Her family home was in Whitechapel, London: first at 15 Leman Street and later at 37 Mansell Street, Goodmanfields, not far from Bevis Marks Synagogue, of which her father was an influential and strictly Orthodox member. Intellectual pursuits were highly regarded in the family circle. Her uncle Moses Mocatta (1768&#150;1857) was a writer and patron of Jewish scholars, and one of her cousins, Elias Haim Lindo (1783&#150;1865), was a pioneer Anglo-Jewish historian.<br>
<br>A studious girl, Abigail benefited from her father's keen interest in Jewish education and also from the tuition of her uncle Moses Mocatta. She became thoroughly proficient in Hebrew and unusually well versed in biblical studies, reaching a level sufficient to be respected by the religious head of the Sephardi community from 1828, Rabbi (Dayan) David Meldola (1797&#150;1853). In the course of her studies she compiled a Hebrew and English vocabulary, which also included brief Hebrew and English dialogues, exchanges amusingly reflecting the polite middle-class society in which she lived. The volume was intended for her own use, but, encouraged by friends, she sanctioned its publication (1837). The value of the work was soon recognized, and it was recommended for use in the community's Hebrew schools. A second edition (1842) incorporated a list of Hebrew abbreviations in ordinary use, the fruit of her extensive reading and a valuable study aid of a kind not then readily available. In 1846 came her main work, a Hebrew&#150;English dictionary, which was intended to assist students towards the works of the most eminent Hebrew lexicographers.<br>
<br>Abigail Lindo was the only woman involved in the early nineteenth-century expansion of biblical philological research and to have publications to her name. She was presumably unacquainted with the cognate languages Aramaic and Arabic, and her work has therefore to be judged by amateur standards. Though overshadowed by subsequent developments in Hebrew philology, her achievement is remarkable for a young English Jewish woman of the time. A later age might well have provided a wider field for her talents. Her writings reveal her as a devout and dutiful daughter, not given to emphasizing her independence; the title-pages of all her works describe her as the third daughter of David Abarbanel Lindo, and his portrait prefaces her dictionary. Valuing what she had achieved by protracted study, she was concerned to inspire others to pursue the same course.<br>
<br>Abigail Lindo did not enjoy robust health. She died at home on 28 August 1848, aged forty-five, following an attack of phlegmasia dolens&#151;a condition described as &#145;white leg&#146;&#151;which lasted for five weeks; she had suffered from growths in the uterus for fifteen years. She was buried two days later in the Novo (new) cemetery of the Sephardi congregation in Mile End Road, Stepney, in the first of the three graves her father had reserved in 1844 for his unmarried daughters then aged over thirty-five, next to the two he reserved for himself and his wife. He presented &pound;50 in stock (consols) to the congregation in remembrance of her. Her epitaph, in Hebrew, with a poem in Hebrew and English praising her character and achievements, was compiled by Dayan Meldola and printed and circulated to her relatives and friends.<br>
