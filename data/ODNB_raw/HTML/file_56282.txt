<span class="headword">Bowring <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Castle]</span>,  Deborah</span>, Lady Bowring  (1816&#150;1902), <span class="occ">local activist</span>, was born on 30 July 1816, one of the fourteen children of Thomas Castle of Clifton and his wife, Mary. Her family were Unitarians, and she was brought up in the Bristol circle which included Lant Carpenter and J. B. Estlin. On 8 November 1860, at the age of forty-four, Deborah Castle became the second wife of the linguist and politician <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/3087/', "Sir John Bowring (1792&#150;1872)")</script>, whose first wife had died in 1858. The couple made their home in Exeter, where they took a prominent part in the life of the city. Lady Bowring was active in local philanthropy, supporting, <i>inter alia</i>, the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital and the Children's Band of Mercy. She was a prominent member of the Unitarian George's Meeting, where she was often to be heard &#145;hopefully pleading the cause of a large-minded and practical Christianity&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>, 493). Lady Bowring was a keen advocate of the university extension movement, serving as a member of the Exeter committee, and a promoter of education for the young women of the city. She was a supporter of the Albert Memorial Museum, of which her husband had been among the founders, and to which she left a bust and portrait of Sir John in her will, and a member of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature and Art.<br>
<br>Lady Bowring was a keen supporter of the women's suffrage movement, becoming in 1871 one of the vice-presidents of the Bristol and West of England Society for Women's Suffrage, a position she retained until her death. She regularly appeared on west country platforms in support of the cause, the last occasion being a meeting at the skating rink, Exeter, in May 1897, when she presided. A committed Liberal, she also spoke at public meetings on other political issues; an &#145;apt and dignified speaker&#146;, she &#145;blended a good deal of humour with her shrewd and graceful remarks&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Inquirer</span>, 493).<br>
<br>After Sir John's death in 1872, Deborah Bowring edited <span class="italic">A Memorial Volume of Sacred Poetry</span> (1873), for which she also wrote a fluent memoir of her husband; the memoir was republished in 1895 as a preface to her edition of his <span class="italic">Matins and Vespers</span>. A woman of &#145;vigorous grasp of mind and efficient action&#146;  (<span class="italic">Englishwoman's Review</span>, 282), Deborah Bowring died at her home, 7 Baring Crescent, Heavitree, near Exeter, on 28 July 1902, having survived her husband by thirty years. She was buried alongside him on 30 July in the higher cemetery, Exeter.<br>
