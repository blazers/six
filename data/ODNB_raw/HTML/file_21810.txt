<span class="headword">Pellew,  George</span>  (1793&#150;1866), <span class="occ">dean of Norwich</span>, third son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21808/', "Edward Pellew, first Viscount Exmouth (1757&#150;1833)")</script>, and his wife, Susan, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Frowde (1756&#150;1837), was born at Flushing, Cornwall, on 3 April 1793. <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/21809/', "Sir Fleetwood Broughton Reynolds Pellew")</script> was his brother. He was educated at Eton College from 1808 to 1811, and admitted as gentleman commoner at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, on 20 March 1812, graduating BA in 1815, MA in 1818, and BD and DD in November 1828. In 1817 he was ordained in the Church of England, in which his family's connections made his preferment straightforward. In February 1819 he became, by the gift of the lord chancellor, vicar of Nazeing, Essex. In November 1820 he was advanced by the same patron to the vicarage of Sutton on the Forest, Yorkshire. He subsequently was appointed seventh canon in Canterbury Cathedral (14 November 1822 to 1828), rector of St George the Martyr, Canterbury (1827&#150;8), prebendary of Osbaldwick at York (15 February 1824 to September 1828), prebendary of Wistow in the same cathedral (18 September 1828 to 1852), rector of St Dionis Backchurch, London (October 1828 to 1852), dean of Norwich 1828, and rector of Great Chart, Kent, 1852; he held the last two preferments until his death. Pellew was one of the last in the Church of England to accumulate pluralities on such a scale. As dean of Norwich he had a seat in convocation, where he took a very active part in the debates, which show him to have been a moderate churchman. He married, on 20 June 1820, Frances, second daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/150/', "Henry Addington")</script>, prime minister and first Viscount Sidmouth, and his first wife, Ursula Mary, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Hammond; they had one son and five daughters.<br>
<br>Pellew published many sermons and tracts, the most important of which was a <span class="italic">Letter to Sir Robert Peel on the Means of Rendering Cathedral Churches Most Conducive to the Efficiency of the Established Church</span> (1837). Many of his sermons were included in <span class="italic">Sermons on many of the Leading Doctrines and Duties Taught by the Church of England</span> (2 vols., 1848); they show him a strong defender of the Reformation. In 1847 he published <span class="italic">The Life and Correspondence of Addington, First Viscount Sidmouth</span>; this biography of his father-in-law is still of use as a documentary source.<br>
<br>Pellew died at the rectory, Great Chart, on 13 October 1866, and the east window of the church was filled with stained glass in his memory. His widow died at Speen Hill House, Newbury, Berkshire, on 27 February 1870.<br>
