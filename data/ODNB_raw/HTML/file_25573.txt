<span class="headword">Appulby,  Simon</span> <span class="st"> [Symon the Anker of London Wall]</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1537), <span class="occ">religious recluse and author</span>, was the last anchorite to be attached to the church of All Hallows, London Wall. An ordained priest, Simon made his anchoritic profession at the nearby priory of the Holy Trinity in June 1513. In choosing the solitary life, he was following in a long parish tradition: All Hallows had hosted an &#145;anker&#146; since at least the early fifteenth century, and probably rather longer. Their reputation for piety meant that anchorites frequently benefited from devotional gifts, and &#145;Syr Symon&#146; could evidently afford to be a generous benefactor of his church. The accounts kept by the churchwardens record a number of donations made by the recluse. Appulby is first mentioned in a fragmentary account, undated but from early in Henry VIII's reign, when he gave a &#145;stande of ale&#146; which yielded 4<i>s</i>. 6&frac12;<i>d</i>. for the parish. When All Hallows was building a new aisle in 1528/9, he contributed 32<i>s</i>. in cash and a further 8<i>s</i>. for the scaffolding poles. He also donated a chalice weighing 8 ounces, and a sum of 9<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. that he had personally received in offerings. The accounts further reveal that he employed a servant, who was on one occasion paid 4<i>d</i>. for &#145;playstrynge of the cherche wall&#146;.<br>
<br>But Appulby's fame was not restricted to the parish of All Hallows. In 1514 Wynkyn de Worde published <span class="italic">The Fruyte of Redempcyon</span>, a series of thirty-one short English prayers and meditations on the life of Christ in the form of a devotional treatise. This book was based upon a popular but anonymous Latin text, <span class="italic">Meditationes de vita et beneficiis Jesu Christi, sive, Gratiarum actiones</span>, which was first published in Cologne about 1488. Although the <span class="italic">Fruyte</span> has sometimes been attributed to Richard Whitford, it plainly states that it was written by &#145;the Anker of London wall wretched Symon&#146;. Its principal theme is the redemptive value of the passion, and the physical sufferings of Christ are graphically described. The text is illustrated by nineteen intricate woodcuts depicting, among other subjects, the Trinity, the annunciation, and the temptation in the wilderness. The book explains that it was written in English &#145;for your ghostly conforte that understande no latyn&#146;, and it was commended to the reader by the conservative bishop of London, Richard Fitzjames. William Bonde, a Syon monk, also expressed his approval of Appulby's treatise in the first edition of his own <span class="italic">Pylgrimage of Perfection</span>. The <span class="italic">Fruyte</span> clearly sold well, since five editions are known to have been printed in all, the last of these in 1532. Appulby died five years later, having made a will bequeathing his books and vestments to his successor as anchorite, should one be found. He requested that his burial be attended by the priests of the Pappey, a fraternity for elderly and indigent clerics where he had served as one of the two wardens between 1505 and 1507. He also made provision for the poor, and asked that 8<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. be spent on a feast of ale, cheese, and buns at his funeral. He was interred in a tomb that he had prepared in his anchorage.<br>
