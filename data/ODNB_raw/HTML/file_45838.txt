<span class="headword">Cave <span class="st"> [<em>married name </em>Winscom]</span>,  Jane</span>  (<em>b. </em>1754/5, <em>d.</em> in or before 1813), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born in Wales, probably at Talgarth in Brecon, where her father, John Cave (<i>b</i>. 1712/13), was an exciseman. He was later converted to Methodism by the religious reformer Howel Harris (1714&#150;1773), an associate of the Wesleys. He worked as an excise officer in Talgarth and as a glover in Brecon. Jane wrote on the deaths of Harris and of George Whitefield, and on the consecration of chapels for the sect known as the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion; she also attended Anglican services. Her mother, who died on 6 February 1777, must have been a Miss H&#151;, as was an aunt to whom her daughter addressed verse letters. Jane Cave had more than one sister. She addressed to her mother, not her father, a poem of farewell to her own maiden name.<br>
<br>From her childhood Cave had a taste for books and poetry. She lived in several places before her marriage, probably in employment. In Bath she had friends who were like parents to her, and she wrote a poem for two young women being bound apprentices to a milliner. She moved to Winchester in November 1779. In 1783 she had printed by subscription there, &#145;for the Author&#146;, <span class="italic">Poems on Various Subjects, Entertaining, Elegiac, and Religious</span>. It bore her birth-name and a portrait showing her pen in hand. It had a lengthy list of subscribers, arranged by their places of residence. This work became the basis of her publishing career. The next edition, published in Bristol in 1786, added &#145;Now Mrs. W&#151;&#146; to her name.<br>
<br>Thomas Winscom, whom Cave married on 18 May 1783, was an exciseman like her father. They had two sons, and perhaps other children who did not survive. Her husband's job entailed moving to a new place every four years: they were at Chagford in Devon before moving in 1792 to Bristol, where he was still working in 1797. A family named Cave were bankers in Bristol, but their family tree gives no evidence of connection; nor is there any evidence of relationship with Edward Cave (1691&#150;1754), founder of the <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, which printed an obituary notice of Jane Cave. She enjoyed a network of links all over the west country, though it was not of her own building, since she says she had not the honour of being known to most of her subscribers. Those to her first volume (whose names fill fifty-two closely printed columns) come from towns like Oxford, Woodstock, Abingdon, Whitchurch, Newbury, Southampton, and Portsmouth, several places in the Isle of Wight, Salisbury, Winchester, and Bath. The next edition expands the list to draw from Windsor and from Sussex. Further editions appeared at Shrewsbury in 1789 and at Bristol again in 1794 (listing the names of newly acquired noble subscribers only). The number of subscribers, and the continual addition of new ones, suggests that Cave was skilled in operating the patronage system.<br>
<br>The first edition is dedicated in a poem &#145;To the Subscribers&#146;, and mentions the author's humble admiration for the &#145;Celebrated Poetesses&#146; Anna Seward, Anne Steele, and Hannah More, whom Cave does not presume to emulate. The poems are arranged more or less by genre: occasional poems (many written at some specific request), pieces on love, marriage, and family affection, elegies, epitaphs, and hymns. The second edition breaks up this generic ordering, adds new poems, and drops others which might be considered low, like &#145;Written by Desire of a Lady, on an Angry, Petulant Kitchen-Maid&#146;. Cave writes advice to unborn children, an address to her baby son, poems on religious topics, and about her own relationship to poetry (notably of being too busy with domestic duties to give proper attention to the muses when they make a social call). She also addresses the perennial topic of a reader who disbelieves that she can, as a woman, really have written her works herself. Poems in her last collection relate how in 1791 she rescued a poor woman from debtors' prison by getting up a subscription, and how she has treated her persistent headaches, for which doctors' prescriptions proved useless, both by sea-bathing and by drinking the waters of Bristol.<br>
<br>On 25 May 1793, the year before her final volume appeared, Cave published &#145;The Head-ach, or, An Ode to Health&#146; in a Bristol newspaper, including a request for suggestions from any readers who might know of a remedy. From the 1780s onwards, she says, she was losing twelve days every month to excruciating headaches, which a modern scholar diagnoses as migraines, and felt that her effectiveness as wife and mother was seriously impaired. She was scathing about the best efforts of the medical profession. When she first tried sea-bathing she found it terrifying, but later she came to revel in the experience. It did not cure her headaches, but she may have persisted in the practice none the less, for her <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span> obituary says that two years before she died she had a &#145;miraculous escape from a watery grave&#146;. This obituary pays tribute to Cave's genius, intellect, writings, and virtues as a wife and mother. She died aged fifty-eight in Newport, Monmouthshire, by January 1813 (the date of the obituary).<br>
