<span class="headword">Capes,  William Wolfe</span>  (1834&#150;1914), <span class="occ">Church of England clergyman and classical scholar</span>, was the third son of Joseph Capes, an employee of the Royal Mint and a bookseller in Paternoster Row, London, and his wife, Anne, daughter of Joseph Wolfe, of Reading. He was born on 1 January 1834 in the parish of St Michael-le-Querne, London, probably in Paternoster Row. He was admitted to St Paul's School, London, on 31 January 1843. A keen pedestrian, he used to walk to school daily from Norwood, where his parents then lived; at sixteen he began to travel abroad (he continued these journeys throughout his life), making an expedition, mainly on foot, from the Netherlands to Rome. In 1852 he went up to Oxford, as Michel exhibitioner at Queen's College. The foundation of the college was then being thrown open, and in 1854 Capes was elected to a taberdarship, previously a closed scholarship. He had in 1853 obtained first classes at moderations in classics and mathematics, and in the final honour schools in 1855 he obtained a first class in classics and a second class in mathematics.<br>
<br>Capes was elected fellow of Queen's on 11 December 1856, and as tutor found himself responsible for all the college teaching in <i>literae humaniores</i>. He proceeded MA in 1858, and remained a fellow of Queen's until 1870. He was ordained in 1865, and served briefly as curate at Abbot's Anne, near Andover. He returned to college work, and was junior proctor in 1865&#150;6, and examiner in <i>literae humaniores</i> in 1867&#150;9, 1873&#150;5, and 1878&#150;9. In 1869 he was presented by his college to the rectory of Bramshott, Hampshire, which he held for thirty-two years. On 23 August 1870 he married Mary (1836/7&#150;1908), daughter of John Leadbeater, of Blackburn. Bramshott was an extensive agricultural parish and, with as many as fourteen gatherings on Sundays for teaching and worship, the services of his wife, his curate, the schoolmasters, and other laymen were called on. But Capes spent three or four days in the middle of each week of term in Oxford, and was from 1870 to 1887 university reader of ancient history. From 1876 to 1886 he was elected fellow and tutor of Hertford College. At this time Capes published <span class="italic">The Early Roman Empire</span> (1874) and <span class="italic">The Age of the Antonines</span> (1877), both in a series of <span class="roman">Epochs of Ancient History</span>, <span class="italic">University Life in Ancient Athens</span> (1877), a course of lectures based on Greek inscriptions, and <span class="italic">Stoicism</span> (1883). Several of these were reissued in the twentieth century. He also prepared editions of some of the texts newly introduced as set books for university honours courses. An edition of Livy, books xxi and xxii (1880), which was reprinted as late as 1960, was followed by one of Sallust (1884) and the part of Polybius containing the history of the Achaean league (1888). Capes was select preacher to the university (1873&#150;4), rural dean of Petersfield, and honorary canon of Winchester from 1894 to 1903. His <span class="italic">History of the English Church in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries</span> (1900) was the third volume of an eight-volume work on <span class="italic">The English Church</span>. Although reprinted in 1968, it had by then very largely outlived its usefulness.<br>
<br>Capes resigned the rectory of Bramshott in 1901 and settled for a while at Addington, Kent, where he wrote <span class="italic">Rural Life in Hampshire</span> (1903), an account of the neighbourhood of Bramshott. In 1903 he was collated to a residentiary canonry in Hereford Cathedral, and in 1908 he published <span class="italic">The Charters and Records of Hereford Cathedral</span> with a long introduction containing a valuable account of the constitution of the cathedral. In the late twentieth century this was still a useful work, not least as others have proved reluctant to improve on it. Capes had earlier founded the Cantilupe Society, which succeeded in a few years in printing all the pre-Reformation registers of the bishops of Hereford. Six of these he himself edited, and he took an active interest in the work of his colleagues. He was one of the first scholars to apply himself to publishing this sort of record and is remembered for his early lead, even if his editions have not themselves stood the test of time. He also began arranging and cataloguing the valuable cathedral library, but this he had not finished at his death, on 30 October 1914 at his home in the cathedral close at Hereford. He and his wife were both buried at Bramshott. They had no children.<br>
