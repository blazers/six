<span class="headword">Tollet,  George</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1725, <em>d.</em> 1779), <span class="occ">literary critic</span>, son of George Tollet (<i>b</i>. 1696) and Elizabeth or Isabel (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Oates), was baptized on 29 September 1725 in Kirk Braddan, Isle of Man. He was probably a student at Eton College by 1742. Tollet matriculated from King's College, Cambridge, on 17 December 1744, and appears to have been in residence at King's from Michaelmas 1744 to Nativitatis 1748. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 2 July 1745, and was called to the bar by the inn on 19 June 1751.<br>
<br>A bachelor, Tollet lived for the latter decades of his life in Betley Hall, in the small town of Betley, Staffordshire; he had inherited the house and surrounding properties from his father. In 1754 Tollet inherited the bulk of the library of his aunt Elizabeth Tollet, the poet, and subsequently enlarged it with his own acquisitions. He contributed fifteen notes to the 1773 edition of Shakespeare by Samuel Johnson and George Steevens, and over four hundred to the ten-volume 1778 edition. In Arthur Sherbo's assessment, this makes Tollet<blockquote>one of the greatest single contributors to the commentary on Shakespeare in the eighteenth century, always excepting the editors of the various editions. His notes are on all the plays of the accepted canon except <span class="italic">Julius Caesar</span>, <span class="italic">Titus Andronicus</span> (which many thought uncanonical), and <span class="italic">Romeo and Juliet</span> (hardly bachelor fare). (Sherbo, <span class="italic">Shakespeare's Midwives</span>, 51)</blockquote>Sherbo laments that Tollet's scholarship has frequently been overlooked by recent Shakespearian critics, and asserts that his work &#145;richly deserves&#146; greater attention  (ibid., 66).<br>
<br>Tollet's dissertation on the so-called Betley Window, a painted glass window from his house in Betley, thought to depict Morris dancers and May day festivities, has inspired much comment from scholars of Shakespeare, folklore, and early English painted glass. This dissertation was first printed in the 1778 edition of Shakespeare by Johnson and Steevens (5.425&#150;34), and a manuscript version addressed to George Steevens is held by the Bodleian Library (Bodl. Oxf., MS Percy c. 4., 62<i>r</i>&#150;65<i>v</i>). The window itself is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Tollet's copy of Elizabeth Tollet's <span class="italic">Poems on Several Occasions</span> (1755)&#151;now at Smith College Library, Massachusetts&#151;is enriched by extensive annotation in his hand, and constitutes an important source of evidence for the poetry and life of his aunt.<br>
<br>Tollet died in October 1779, probably on the 21st or 22nd, at Betley. He was buried there, at St Margaret's Church. William Cole, who had been a contemporary of Tollet at King's College, described him as &#145;a shy, reserved man, and of no genteel appearance or behaviour&#146;  (Nichols, <span class="italic">Illustrations</span>, 8.584), but no portraits have been located.<br>
