</div>
<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Durrell,  Lawrence George</span>  (1912&#150;1990), <span class="occ">novelist and poet</span>, was born on 27 February 1912 at Jullundur in the Punjab, India, the first of the five children of Lawrence Samuel Durrell (1884&#150;1928), a civil engineer then with the railway system, and his wife, Louisa Florence Dixie (1884&#150;1964), from a family associated with the Thomason College of Civil Engineering at Roorkee. Neither parent had seen England, and many of Durrell's forebears, over half from England, but some protestant Irish on his mother's side, had gone to India before the revolt of 1857&#150;9 as privates or non-commissioned officers in the British army. Durrell emphasized how rooted in India his ancestors were, speaking the local languages and studying Buddhism. Durrell's father became quite successful: his construction firm, Durrell &amp; Co., built much of the Tata iron and steel enterprise in Jamshedpur. This heritage was vital in forming Durrell's outlook: a cosmopolitan, he called himself &#145;a pure Anglo-Irish-Indian ASH BLOND&#146;  (<span class="italic">Durrell&#150;Miller Letters</span>, 50), but could never identify fully with England, Ireland, or even India.<h2>
<a name="Earlyyearseducationandfirstwritings"></a>Early years, education, and first writings</h2>During Durrell's early life the family followed his father to various postings. The next child born after Lawrence died in infancy, but two brothers and a sister survived to adulthood. His youngest sibling was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/59124/', "Gerald Malcolm Durrell (1925&#150;1995)")</script>, who became a noted zoologist and author. After some tutoring by his Irish governess in Kurseong, Durrell spent the years 1921&#150;2 in the primary school at St Joseph's College in Darjeeling, within sight of the Himalayas, and the vast panorama of snowy peaks remained his lifelong metaphor for unattainable beauty. Although baptized at the chapel of St Luke in the Jullundur cantonment, late in his life Durrell considered himself a Buddhist.<br>
<br>In 1923 Durrell sailed with his family for England, where he was left by his parents to continue his schooling for two years at St Olave's and St Saviour's in Southwark and then for one year and a term at St Edmund's College in Canterbury. Durrell dropped out of St Edmund's in December 1927, having completed only the fourth form. He then studied with an army crammer at Cambridge, but did not join the army, and claimed&#151;no corroborating evidence exists&#151;to have repeatedly failed university entrance examinations. On the death of his father, aged forty-three, at Dalhousie in April 1928, his mother moved to England, living successively in south London and Bournemouth. Durrell demanded his patrimony, and on &pound;150 a year he embarked at about the age of eighteen on a bohemian existence in London, convinced that he would become a poet and spending much of his time in the British Museum reading room, while attempting to supplement his income through various stratagems: as estate agent, jazz pianist, and, with the Slade art student Nancy Isobel Myers (1912&#150;1983), studio photographer. Durrell's first book of poems, <span class="italic">Quaint Fragment</span>, was printed on a friend's hand press in 1931. A year spent in relative seclusion in a Sussex cottage produced Durrell's first work of fiction, <span class="italic">Pied Piper of Lovers</span>, written as an entry for a first novel prize offered by Cassell. Durrell did not win, but Cassell published his novel, paying an advance of &pound;50. Early in March 1935, having married Nancy Myers on 22 January, the 5 foot 2 Durrell and his tall, slender bride set off for the island of Corfu, where they were soon joined by his mother and siblings. In 1956 Gerald Durrell published his hilarious version of their Corfu adventures, <span class="italic">My Family and other Animals</span>.<br>
<br>Durrell, who had hated &#145;Pudding Island&#146;, loved Corfu. Inspired by the liberating Greek ambience and an exotic acquaintanceship, he wrote two novels in three years: <span class="italic">Panic Spring</span> (1937, published under the pseudonym Charles Norden) and <span class="italic">The Black Book</span> (1938); drafted many of the poems that would form his first collection, <span class="italic">A Private Country</span>; and initiated a correspondence with Henry Miller that continued until Miller's death in 1980. <span class="italic">The Black Book</span>, inspired by Miller's <span class="italic">Tropic of Cancer</span>, but also the novel in which Durrell claimed that he &#145;first heard the sound of [his] own voice&#146;  (preface, <span class="italic">The Black Book</span>, 1960, 13), attacked both the stultifying &#145;English death&#146; and Lawrence's <span class="italic">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span>. T. S. Eliot wrote that the book was &#145;the first piece of work by a new English writer to give me any hope for the future of prose fiction&#146;, praising especially the &#145;sense of pattern and of organisation of moods&#146;  (flyleaf copy, <span class="italic">The Black Book</span>, 1938). However, he judged that it could not be published unexpurgated in England, so Durrell gave it to the Obelisk Press in Paris. In the modernist <span class="italic">Black Book</span> Durrell displayed the narrative complexity and linguistic virtuosity that characterized his later novels: the multiple points of view, achieved through diary fragments, letters, and dialogue reported by characters turned narrators; an Elizabethan fascination with the language of trades and sciences; and the tendency to describe scenes in lavish painterly terms.<br>
<br>In 1941 Durrell, Nancy, and their infant daughter, Penelope, fled to Egypt ahead of the German invasion. While in Egypt during the war he composed <span class="italic">Prospero's Cell</span>, a lyrical account of the life he had lived on Corfu, as well as a teasing suggestion that the island might have been the setting for Shakespeare's <span class="italic">Tempest</span>. Durrell's book is not travel literature but a &#145;foreign residence&#146; account, combining a first-person narration and vividly presented characters and events with a palimpsest of history, botany, and folkways. In 1947 he drafted another book in this genre about Rhodes: <span class="italic">Reflections on a Marine Venus</span>, eventually published in 1953.<br>
<br>Durrell's first volume of poetry to be published by a major press, <span class="italic">A Private Country</span>, appeared in 1943 with Faber and Faber, where Eliot was his editor. Durrell's best poetry captures the spirit of Greek places:<blockquote>
<div>And the Greek sea's curly head<br>
</div>
<div>Keep its calms like tears unshed.<br>
</div> (&#145;Bitter Lemons&#146;, <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 1974)</blockquote>He had a fine ear for lyrical utterance, and there is a flower-like perfection to his best short poems:<blockquote>
<div class="indent">&hellip; go<br>
</div>
<div>mimic your mother's lovely face<br>
</div> (&#145;Cradle Song&#146;, <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, 1974)</blockquote>he admonishes Sappho, his daughter with his second wife, Eve. His best sustained sequence is &#145;Cities, Plains and People&#146; (1946), in which his theme is his evolution as an artist.<h2>
<a name="TheAlexandriaQuartet"></a>The Alexandria Quartet</h2>Durrell still thought of himself as a poet forced to write novels to support himself, but in 1945 he sketched out for Eliot his master plan for fiction. He would treat, sequentially, the <i>agon</i> (struggle), <i>pathos</i> (suffering), and <i>anagnorisis</i> (recognition). These three main thrusts would present dislocation, uniting, and acceptance and death. In <span class="italic">The Black Book</span> Durrell had already described the necessary dislocation of the artist from suffocating England. &#145;The Book of the Dead&#146;&#151;Durrell's working title for <span class="italic">The Alexandria Quartet</span>&#151;would show the birth of the artist through suffering and love. The final segment he called provisionally &#145;The Book of Time&#146;, and, true to his plan, <span class="italic">The Revolt of Aphrodite</span> and <span class="italic">The Avignon Quintet</span> would purport to vanquish time and death. Durrell's sequence, loosely linked by his major themes, love, art, and death, by geography (the Mediterranean world), and by a few recurring characters, eventually comprised twelve volumes in all and took him almost fifty years to complete. Durrell considered his first two novels outside his master plan, and he placed in the potboiler category two later works of fiction, <span class="italic">The Dark Labyrinth</span> and <span class="italic">White Eagles over Serbia</span>.<br>
<br>In Egypt Durrell found employment as public information officer attached to the British embassy, first in Cairo and, from 1942, in Alexandria. His familiarity with a broad spectrum of the polyglot society of the Egyptian cities provided him with material for his <span class="italic">Quartet</span>. Divorce from Nancy, marriage on 17 February 1947 to the Alexandrian Yvette (Eve) Cohen (<i>b</i>. 1918), various press officer jobs in Rhodes, Yugoslavia, and Cyprus, interrupted by a year as director of the British council in C&oacute;rdoba, Argentina&#151;where he wrote the monograph <span class="italic">A Key to Modern Poetry</span>&#151;postponed Durrell's start on the <span class="italic">Quartet</span> until 1955. He completed <span class="italic">Justine</span>, the first volume of the <span class="italic">Quartet</span>, on Cyprus in 1956, after his separation from Eve, and wrote the remaining three volumes in Languedoc, where he lived near N&icirc;mes and in Sommi&egrave;res.<br>
<br>The concept in the <span class="italic">Quartet</span> that perceived truth is relative, dependent on the situation and condition of the observer, was derived by Durrell from Einstein's theory of relativity. Thus, the na&iuml;ve L. G. Darley, bearer of Durrell's initials and principal narrator of <span class="italic">Justine</span>, tells the story of Darley's love affair with Justine as he perceived it. In the next volume, <span class="italic">Balthazar</span>, the eponymous commentator reveals that Justine had really loved another and was using Darley as a decoy. <span class="italic">Mountolive</span>, the third volume, is a straight third-person narrative in which Justine is shown to have been engaged with her husband in a political conspiracy for which her affairs provided cover. Each of the three versions is &#145;true&#146; within its own parameters. The final volume, <span class="italic">Clea</span>, moves the story forward in time and shows the emergence of Darley as an artist, thanks to the lessons in love and narrative &#145;truth&#146; that he has been given.<br>
<br>The four novels emerged in rapid succession from 1957 to 1960 and elicited wildly divergent but generally favourable reviews, praising or attacking Durrell's luxuriant prose, his highly romantic recreation of Alexandria, and his self-proclaimed use of Einstein. Only with the <span class="italic">Quartet</span> sales did Durrell begin to live from his writing, but he never became rich. Despite an excellent cast that included Anouk Aimee, Dirk Bogarde, and Michael York, the film based on the <span class="italic">Quartet</span>, known as <span class="italic">Justine</span> (1969), was mediocre.<br>
<br>During 1957 Durrell published not only <span class="italic">Justine</span>, but also <span class="italic">Bitter Lemons</span>, an analysis of the tragedy of modern Cyprus and his best work in the foreign residence genre; <span class="italic">Esprit de corps</span>, a series of Wodehousian sketches based on Durrell's days on &#145;Embassy Row&#146;; and <span class="italic">White Eagles over Serbia</span>, a thriller directed towards juvenile readers. <span class="italic">Bitter Lemons</span> gained Durrell a Duff Cooper award.<br>
<br>Durrell's fascination with the Elizabethans led to three verse dramas, <span class="italic">Sappho</span> (1950), <span class="italic">An Irish Faustus</span> (1963), and <span class="italic">Acte</span> (1964), which, despite excellent productions in Hamburg and Edinburgh, did not establish the author's stage reputation: his plays are more notable for the quality of their verse than for dramatic verve.<h2>
<a name="Laternovelsandlastyears"></a>Later novels and last years</h2>Durrell's life was darkened by the death on 1 January 1967 of Claude-Marie Forde, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Vincendon (<i>c</i>.1926&#150;1967), like Eve an Alexandrian, a secretary and novelist whom he had married on 27 March 1961, and he took up novels again. <span class="italic">The Revolt of Aphrodite</span> was orginally published as two volumes, <span class="italic">Tunc</span> (1968) and <span class="italic">Nunquam</span> (1970), titles derived from Petronius's phrase <i>aut tunc, aut nunquam</i> (&#145;it was either then or never&#146;). Ostensibly a comic novel, <span class="italic">Revolt</span> is Elizabethan and Jacobean in its careful numerological structure and its mix of comic and tragic elements&#151;contrasting with various farcical sub-plots, the scientist-narrator's son is killed by an elaborate booby trap intended by his father for the head of Merlin's, the multinational firm at the centre of the story. Durrell proved an accurate prophet of the development of the personal computer and of the modern mega-corporations that can exceed nations in wealth and power, but <span class="italic">Revolt</span> offended many readers who had expected a rewrite of the romantic <span class="italic">Quartet</span>.<br>
<br>A similar fate befell <span class="italic">The Avignon Quintet</span>. Eastern in philosophy, the <span class="italic">Quintet</span> demonstrates the breakdown of the &#145;discrete ego&#146;, and characters exchange traits and are reincarnated. More overtly postmodern than the <span class="italic">Quartet</span>, the <span class="italic">Quintet</span> further erodes the distinction between reality and fiction. Characters talk back to their creators, as a pattern of narrators within narrations unfolds. Durrell called his structure a <i>gigogne</i>, like the nesting boxes of a Chinese puzzle. A system of fives provides the basic structure: the <i>quincunx</i> pattern employed in medieval arboretums, with trees planted like the dots on a five in dominoes, and the five <i>skandas</i> of Buddhism&#151;form, sensation, perception, conformation, consciousness. <span class="italic">Monsieur</span>, the first volume, turns out to be the centre dot on the domino, the &#145;reality prime&#146; or fiction derived from the &#145;reality&#146; presented in the other four novels of the <span class="italic">Quintet</span>. Fives pervade the <span class="italic">Quintet</span>, as Durrell attacked the &#145;five M's&#146; that he believed were destroying western society: monotheism, Messianism, monogamy, materialism, <i>merde</i>&#151;&#145;The gold bar is the apotheosis of the human turd&#146;, he wrote in <span class="italic">Monsieur</span>  (p. 142). Fascinated by the Gnostics, and a convinced Manichean, Durrell saw in &#145;divine entropy&#146; the running down of the universe, against which the artist must valiantly throw the creative act, both in love-making and in literature.<br>
<br>Durrell's later years were trouble-filled. His marriage to his fourth wife, Ghislaine de Boysson, a model and actress whom he married in 1973, ended in divorce in 1978; and his daughter Sappho committed suicide in 1985. Although he talked about a major novel to follow the <span class="italic">Quintet</span>, Durrell was barely able to complete <span class="italic">Caesar's Vast Ghost</span>, his non-fiction tribute to his beloved Languedoc and to Provence. His relationship with his final companion, Fran&ccedil;oise Kestsman, a translator and restaurateur, was turbulent; his laboured breathing was diagnosed as due to emphysema; and he tried with varying degrees of success to stave off his heavy drinking with yoga and acupuncture. He died on 7 November 1990 of a cerebral haemorrhage at his home in Sommi&egrave;res, France, and was buried on 8 November at La Chapelle St Julien, Sommi&egrave;res. After Durrell's death, Sappho's literary executor accused the author of an incestuous relationship with his daughter, on the uncorroborated revelations of &#145;recalled memory&#146; induced while Sappho was undergoing psychoanalysis. On the basis of present evidence, this accusation should be regarded as unfounded.<br>
<br>The final verdict on Durrell's writing is still open. His readership peaked in the 1960s and declined with the negative reaction to his later fiction, falling further because, especially after his death, many of his titles went out of print. His foreign residence books have become accepted as classics, but he remains underrated as a poet. All this may change as the narrative and technical mastery of his later work becomes acknowledged. <span class="italic">Deus loci</span>, a Durrell newsletter, was founded in 1977, and it was succeeded by an annual Durrell journal of the same title. The creation of the International Lawrence Durrell Society in 1980 has led to an unbroken series of biennial conferences devoted to Durrell, and the growth in size of these meetings (ninety speakers appeared on the programme for the 2000 conference in Corfu), plus a burgeoning French society, Lawrence Durrell en Languedoc, demonstrate that he still has a considerable following. This scholarly and popular interest suggests that he may well achieve status not merely as an intriguing minor experimenter in fictional relativism, but as an important twentieth-century writer.<br>
