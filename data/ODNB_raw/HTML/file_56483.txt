<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Gordon,  Seton Paul</span>  (1886&#150;1977), <span class="occ">naturalist and photographer</span>, was born at 26 Rubislaw Terrace, Aberdeen, on 11 April 1886, the only child of William Gordon (1839&#150;1924), advocate and town clerk of Aberdeen, and his wife, Ella Mary, daughter of the horticulturist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35418/', "William Paul")</script> of Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire; she wrote poetry. As well as a family house in Aberdeen, the Gordons had a chalet (Auchintoul) at Aboyne on Deeside, which played a big part in developing the young boy's love of wildlife, fishing, climbing the hills, and photographing birds; he wrote so well about what he was discovering that the first of his twenty-seven books, <span class="italic">Birds of Loch and Mountain</span>, illustrated with ninety of his photographs, was published in 1907. In October 1908 he matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, and took a second-class honours degree in natural sciences in 1911. At Oxford he met (Evelyn) Audrey Pease (1893&#150;1959), an undergraduate at Lady Margaret Hall, studying the same subjects. She not only matched him in ornithological knowledge, but had photographed a variety of birds from hides in her home county of Northumberland. They were married on 19 August 1915, had a son and two daughters, and their partnership lasted until her death.<br>
<br>In 1912 Gordon published <span class="italic">The Charm of the Hills</span>, which remained in print almost a century later. During the First World War he was given the job of organizing a secret coastguard service, based on the Isle of Mull and with his own boat. For Gordon a whole new world opened up as he recruited a corps of over 100 Hebrideans on different islands to watch out for enemy submarines. He was conscious of the inequality which meant that he could go where he pleased among the islands and wildlife that he loved while his friends were being killed in the trenches in France. <span class="italic">The Land of the Hills and the Glens</span> (1920) and <span class="italic">Hebridean Memoirs</span> (1923) drew on these experiences. Indeed, his wartime career launched him on a career as a naturalist, writer, and photographer, for, as he discovered in the 1920s, there were more qualified former officers than appointments. He observed, &#145;After the war we visited much of the Highlands and the Hebrides, staying with crofters, camping on the islands, some of them uninhabited, living the hard way, thus getting to know the crofters and their outlook on the world.&#146; In 1922 he published <span class="italic">Amid Snowy Wastes</span>, an account of the wildlife on the Spitsbergen archipelago, and in 1927 <span class="italic">Days with the Golden Eagle</span>, the first of many volumes on birds which bridged the gap between ornithology and environmentalism. His <span class="italic">Edward Grey of Fallodon and his Birds</span> (1937) was an affectionate account of the former foreign secretary's interest in the subject.<br>
<br>Seton Gordon had a disciplined approach to his work, routinely writing for three hours in the morning and three in the evening. In February he went on lecture tours, travelling all over the British Isles to show his slides taken with a half-plate camera; the tours always finished in time for him to return to his home, Upper Duntulm, on the island of Skye, to catch the nesting of the golden eagle. The routine produced some thirty or more books, many illustrated with photographs by both Gordon and his wife. Among them were <span class="italic">Thirty Years of Nature Photography</span> (1936), <span class="italic">Highways and Byways in the Central Highlands</span> (1948, with illustrations by Sir David Young Cameron), and <span class="italic">Afoot in the Hebrides</span> (1950). Gordon was appointed CBE in 1939. Audrey Gordon died in 1959, and the following year (2 June 1960) Seton married a family friend, Elizabeth Maud (<i>b</i>. 1899/1900), widow of Colonel Reginald Badger and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/53022/', "George Murray Smith")</script>, landowner. Gordon's discipline now relaxed somewhat, and they divided their time between Upper Duntulm, his wife's cottage in Kintail, and Biddleston Manor, Northamptonshire, where Seton Gordon died on the night of 18&#150;19 March 1977. His ashes were scattered in the Cairngorms.<br>
<br>Adam Watson summed up Gordon's life in <span class="italic">Scottish Birds</span>, the journal of the Scottish Ornithologists Club:<blockquote>With his passing ends the period of wholly exploratory naturalists in Scotland and their extraordinary breadth of interests. He was the long last practitioner, overlapping for decades the modern period when scientific method dominated ornithology. Astride two centuries, Seton had a timeless attitude, exemplified by the patched, decades-old kilt he wore on every occasion, sun or snow, mansion or bothy.</blockquote>
