<span class="headword">Ghose, Manmohan</span>  (1869&#150;1924), <span class="occ">poet and university teacher</span>, was born on 19 January 1869 at Bhagalpur, Bihar, India, the second son of Krishna Dhan Ghose (1844&#150;1892/3), a civil medical officer in Bengal, and his wife, Swarnalata Basu (<i>b</i>. 1852), the eldest daughter of Rajnarayan Basu (1826&#150;1899), a popular and distinguished poet and the first historian of Bengali literature. His younger brother was <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62510/', "Sri Aurobindo (Aravinda) Ghose (1872&#150;1950)")</script>, the politician and spiritual leader. His parents belonged to Brahmo Samaj, a Hindu reformist movement opposed to the traditional practice of suttee, and his father, who had studied at Aberdeen University, was also an Anglophile who employed an English governess and deeply admired the English character.<br>
<br>In 1877 Manmohan and his brothers were sent by their father to Loreto convent school at Darjeeling to be taught by Catholic nuns; Krishna Dhan Ghose wanted them to be at a distance from their mother, who as a result of repeated bouts of insanity would subject her children to extreme physical torture. In 1879 the family visited England and the boys were sent to live in Manchester in the house of the Revd William Drewett, a kind and learned Congregational minister who taught them Latin and Greek and read the Elizabethan poets with them. Manmohan, a brilliant scholar, was educated at Manchester grammar school (1881&#150;4) and St Paul's School in London (1884&#150;7). In London he knew Laurence Binyon, the poet, who remained his closest friend for the rest of his life. Binyon was amazed at Ghose's passion for Greek verse, his vast knowledge of English literature, and the skill and subtlety of the English poems he was writing.<br>
<br>Manmohan won an open scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford, which he hesitated to take up: his father, though a prosperous and philanthropic doctor, had many calls on his income, supported a great number of impoverished relations, and was harassed and distraught by the growing mental illness of his wife. Manmohan nevertheless went up to Oxford in Michaelmas 1887 with the intention of studying classics. He had almost no money and lodged among rich and fashionable undergraduates. He found himself unable to pay the tuition fees and lived a solitary and ascetic life, writing verse in his rooms and living on bread and butter. In the vacations he and his brothers stayed at 128 Cromwell Road, London, the office of the South Kensington Liberal Club, whose secretary was J. S. Cotton, editor of <span class="italic">The Academy</span>, who was born in India and sensitive to the plight of the Ghose brothers. Manmohan began work on a rich and colourful Indian story, &#145;Prince Pomegranate&#146;, but he was lonely in London. Sympathizing with his friend's sense of isolation, Binyon introduced him to Selwyn Image, who designed the cover for the forthcoming anthology of poems <span class="italic">Primavera</span>, and to Arthur Galton of the <span class="italic">Hobby Horse</span> circle. Ghose obtained a second class in classical moderations in 1889 but, deeply in debt to Oxford moneylenders, did not return to Christ Church in autumn 1889 and instead pursued his classical studies alone.<br>
<br>On 8 April 1890 Ghose met Oscar Wilde at the Fitzroy Street settlement. A little later, after several visits to Tite Street for afternoon tea with the Wildes, Ghose wrote to Binyon:<blockquote>He is a wonderful and charming being. You are inclined to think him superficial, I know, you should know him as I do then you would feel what depth and sagacity there is behind his delightful mask of paradox and irony and perversity. (Ghose to L. Binyon, 28 Aug 1890, BL)</blockquote>Wilde himself was profoundly impressed with Ghose and, amused at the three-piece velvet suit in aesthetic brown in which Ghose would visit him, christened him &#145;the young Indian panther in evening brown&#146;  (Purani, <span class="italic">Sri Aurobindo in England</span>, 97).<br>
<br>Ghose's poems were published in the little anthology <span class="italic">Primavera</span> in 1890. They were praised by the reviewers (notably Wilde in the <span class="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> and John Addington Symonds in <span class="italic">The Academy</span>) for the music and charm of the writing and the subtle mastery of English prosody and diction. Ghose at first concealed from Wilde that he was practically destitute; when Wilde discovered the truth he gave Ghose a wealth of practical help and advice and tried to persuade him to finish &#145;Prince Pomegranate&#146;, so that Wilde could place it with an editor. Ghose was never satisfied with the story and it was neither completed nor published. He became a member of the Rhymers' Club and a friend of Lionel Johnson and Ernest Dowson, but his verse was not published in <span class="italic">The Book of the Rhymers' Club</span> (1892) because he could not afford to share the expenses with the other contributors.<br>
<br>In 1893 Ghose's father learned that the ship bringing his son Aravinda back to India had been wrecked and his son drowned. The news was untrue, but the doctor died of heart failure. Ghose returned to India in mourning and took a series of teaching posts in Patna, Bankipur, and Calcutta, enduring dullness and exhaustion for the sake of the salary. In 1897 he was appointed an assistant professor at Dacca College; here, for five years, he taught English literature, corresponded with Binyon in England, and contributed poems to the <span class="italic">Garland of New Poetry</span> (1898). In 1899 he married Malati Banerjee (<i>d</i>. 1918), the beautiful, unlettered daughter of a Dacca chemist. At this time he began work on his <i>magnum opus</i>, the epic poem &#145;Perseus&#146;, and published a volume entitled <span class="italic">Love-Songs and Elegies</span> (1898) with Elkin Mathews. Aided by Binyon and Herbert Horne, he made a study of Italian art and became an avid collector of prints and photographs of Renaissance painting. He became a friend and admirer of Rabindranath Tagore, whose &#145;Paras Pathar&#146; he translated into English. He was made a full professor at Dacca in 1901. In the same year his first child, Mrinalini, was born. In 1903 he became an inspector of schools in the Chota-Nagpur division; this involved 200 days' travelling a year, journeying by ox-cart to remote villages. His second daughter and future biographer, Lotika, was born at this time, and shortly afterwards the family moved to Calcutta, where Ghose became a professor at Presidency College. He was widely regarded as the best teacher in the city. He filled his house with English flowers and reproductions of Italian paintings. He was extremely happy.<br>
<br>In 1905, however, Ghose's wife fell ill with an incurable nervous disease, which led to paralysis and loss of speech and memory. At the same time, Ghose suffered greatly from the political activities of his younger brothers Aravinda and Barindra Kumar, who settled in Calcutta with the secret intention of raising an armed revolt against British rule. Ghose, who suspected nothing of this and was a frequent visitor at their house, was put under surveillance by the intelligence services. After the detonation of a terrorist bomb, which killed two English women and for which Barindra Kumar was given a sentence of life imprisonment, Ghose himself came under suspicion as a possible associate of terrorists. Friends and relatives no longer came to his house and he became isolated and remote. During the First World War he was again put in danger of arrest and imprisonment because he was wrongly thought to be involved in a case of revolutionary arms smuggling. The government allowed him to retain his liberty on the extraordinary condition that he abandon his grandly ambitious poem &#145;Perseus&#146; in case it should prove to have a concealed political motive. At this time Ghose was in anguish at what was happening in England as a result of the war and was writing deeply patriotic verse to the country he regarded as his home.<br>
<br>Restored to favour after a decade in which his salary had been frozen by the authorities, Ghose was promoted to a class I post in the Indian education service, with a specially enhanced grade of pay. Ghose's wife, whom he &#145;worshipped&#146;, died in October 1918, and his own health broke down following the long years of devoted care with which he had nursed her while also caring for two infant daughters. He aged prematurely. In 1921 he lost the sight of one eye and could see little with the other. There followed a period of renewed poetic composition, inspired by his grief for his dead wife. The blind Ghose dictated to his daughters two series of elegiac lyrics, &#145;Immortal Eve&#146; and &#145;Orphic Mysteries&#146;, which were published posthumously in 1926 as <span class="italic">Songs of Love and Death</span>, with a moving memoir by Binyon. W. B. Yeats, moved to tears on reading &#145;page after page of majestic lines&#146;, described the volume as &#145;one of the most lovely works in the world&#146;  (Ghose, <span class="italic">Selected Poems</span>, 253). John Freeman compared the poems to <span class="italic">The Angel in the House</span> by Coventry Patmore.<br>
<br>For thirty years Ghose had cherished the dream of returning to England. In 1924 he booked a passage for himself and his daughters for a date in March, but he died at 275/3 Bowbazar Street, Calcutta, on 4 January 1924 after a short illness, three weeks before his retirement from Presidency College. While he lay dying his daughters read to him from Scott and Shakespeare at his request as no one was able to read to him from his beloved Greek poets. He was cremated the same day at the Keoratala burning ghat according to the rites of the Brahmo Samaj.<br>
<br>Between 1970 and 1977 Ghose's daughter Lotika published four of a projected five volumes of her father's hitherto unpublished writings as <span class="italic">Collected Poems</span>, garnered from scores of notebooks and mountains of loose sheets of paper lying neglected for more than half a century in the cellars of Calcutta University Library. These volumes, unnoticed in India, where they were published, also remain largely unknown to the Western world. They contain &#145;Perseus&#146;, abandoned after 8572 lines, and the completed lyric epic <span class="italic">Adam Alarmed in Paradise: an Epic of Eden during the Great War</span>. At 12,282 lines in trochaic trimetre, it is almost as long as John Milton's <span class="italic">Paradise Lost</span> and <span class="italic">Paradise Regained</span> put together&#151;a splendid testimony to Ghose's devotion to poetry, his delight in difficult metre and verbal music, and his powers of concentration and learning.<br>
