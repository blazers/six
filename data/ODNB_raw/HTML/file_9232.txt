<span class="headword">Fawkner,  John Pascoe</span>  (1792&#150;1869), <span class="occ">pioneer in Australia</span>, born on 20 October 1792 in London, probably near Cripplegate, was the son of John Fawkner (<i>b</i>. 1770), a metal refiner, and Hannah Pascoe (<i>b</i>. 1774), whose maiden name her son added to his own after her death in 1825. In 1801 his father was sentenced to transportation for receiving stolen goods worth &pound;455, and with his wife, son, and daughter sailed on 24 April 1803 for the new convict settlement at Port Phillip. From there on 26 January 1804 the convicts were taken to Sullivan's Cove (Hobart), Van Diemen's Land, where the Fawkner family ultimately became successful farmers. In 1809 Hannah received a legacy which enabled the family to expand their farming and open a shop, while young John tried his hand as a sawmiller, builder, and baker. In 1814 he helped some convicts to escape, and for this he was said to have been sentenced to 500 lashes and three years' government labour. It seems he was not flogged but was sent to Newcastle, New South Wales, where he was employed in timber-cutting and lime-burning. He returned to Hobart in 1817, resumed his former bakery business, cultivated a 93-acre farm, supplied firewood and sawn timber, and sold (unlicensed) liquor. By the end of 1818 he had made &pound;1000 and had begun to live with his future wife, Eliza Cobb (1800/01&#150;1879), a newly arrived convict, transported for stealing a child. After further trouble with the law, the couple, who married on 5 December 1822 but never had children, moved in 1819 to Launceston, where Fawkner started another bakery and was active as a bookseller, lawyer, timber merchant, and farmer. In 1824 he opened&#151;without a licence for two years&#151;his large Cornwall Hotel, built for &pound;2500. He sold his bakery and timber business, made some good purchases of land near the town, and became a very successful bush lawyer in the lower courts. On 8 February 1829 he started the <span class="italic">Launceston Advertiser</span>, which he edited for two years and owned for three, but, having in September lost the licence of his flourishing hotel, he returned to farming, with a nursery which soon became famous for the quality and variety of its produce. The following year he recovered his hotel licence, opened a library and newsroom, became an auctioneer, and began a coach service to Longford, 15 miles to the south; rumours of his having tried to &#145;rescue&#146; more prisoners in 1829 prevented his obtaining the mail contracts that he sought, but he seems then to have been earning a net income of about &pound;900 a year.<br>
<br>By 1834 Fawkner had become intrigued by reports of the southern coast of mainland Australia and determined to make an attempt to settle there. He bought a ship, the 50 ton <i>Enterprize</i>, to cross the strait, but existing contracts delayed its delivery until after John Batman had visited Port Phillip.<br>
<br>When the <i>Enterprize</i> was finally ready, Fawkner, held back by his creditors, could not sail with her, but he financed the expedition which, under the command of John Lancey, was the first to settle on the site of the future city of Melbourne, landing on 30 August 1835 with horses, ploughs, plants, seeds, building materials, and provisions. Fawkner arrived at Melbourne on 17 October, moved into his house&#151;the first to be built there&#151;on 7 November, tended his farm, and opened a store and a hotel. In June 1837 he bought his first lots of city land, and on 1 January 1838 he started the <span class="italic">Melbourne Advertiser</span>, the first nine issues being in manuscript, but, unlicensed, it had to cease publication in March. Next year, having obtained type and licence, on 16 February he began the <span class="italic">Port Phillip Patriot</span>, which he owned for nearly seven years. By then he had built a larger hotel, which in June he leased for five years to the newly established Melbourne Club, and had bought 569 acres of suburban land for subdivision and 709 acres at nearby Pascoe Vale. Here he planned a village settlement and lived for fifteen years after 1840. He was then said to be worth &pound;20,000.<br>
<br>In 1841 Fawkner was elected to the market commission and the following year to the freshly constituted town council. He was a radical, but was regarded as honest and independent, though constantly involved in controversy and litigation. Legal expenses and the economic depression brought insolvency in March 1845, but in 1846 he sold his newspaper and paid his debts. He continued his farming, held a 12,800 acre pastoral run near Macedon for seven years, recommenced his business as a commission agent, and bought another 5000 acres of land, mostly near Melbourne, for &pound;6000. In the public sphere, he passionately supported the agitations against convict transportation and Superintendent La Trobe, as well as the continuing campaign for separation from New South Wales.<br>
<br>When this was achieved in 1851, Fawkner was elected a member of the new legislative council; he was re-elected to the reconstituted council in 1856, and remained a very active member until his death. He was a lifelong critic of squatters, Chinese and Americans, state aid to religion, papists, and La Trobe, and a supporter of yeomen farmers, a free press, law reform, married women, and national (non-sectarian) schools. In rejecting close participation in the policy of any administration he remained an independent critic of an increasingly conservative stamp, and in 1856&#150;7 opposed manhood suffrage, the ballot, payment of members, and the opening of hotels on Sundays; in 1865 he supported the legislative council in its dispute with the radical MacCulloch government. Sickness prevented him writing his projected history of the colony, of which he always insisted (quite unjustifiably) that he was the founder; however, despite his increasing asthma and gradually failing health, his stocky figure, only 5 feet 2 inches in height, in its smoking cap and long cloak, was a familiar one in the council until very shortly before his death, on 4 September 1869, at his home at 226 Smith Street, Collingwood, where he had moved in 1856. Dogmatic, abusive, and litigious, he was shrewd and generous, with a radical's desire to develop a colony where a poor man might flourish. He was buried in Melbourne general cemetery amid general signs of respect for him as an indefatigable pioneer, his public funeral on 8 September being said to have been attended by 50,000 people.<br>
