<span class="headword">Mollineux <span class="st"> [<em>n&eacute;e </em>Southworth]</span>,  Mary</span>  (1651?&#150;1696), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was born Mary Southworth, probably in 1651 and probably in Lancashire. Her parents' names do not appear on her marriage certificate, but it has been speculated that her mother may have been Alice Southworth of Warrington  (Mortimer, 126). Mollineux's cousin Frances Owen (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Ridge) was editor and writer of the introduction to her cousin's selection of devotional verses, <span class="italic">Fruits of Retirement</span> (1702).<br>
<br>Frances Owen observed that Southworth's father &#145;brought her up to more Learning than is commonly bestowed on our sex&#146;  (Mollineux, sig. A4<i>r</i>). She learned about the nature of plants and minerals, in addition to Latin, Greek, &#145;physick and chyrurgery&#146;, and arithmetic. Though seemingly her learning was impeded by &#145;weak Eyes&#146;, her first dated poem puts her at eleven  (ibid., sig. A4<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>). She may have been raised a Quaker; Henry Mollineux notes that &#145;she was Convinced of the Way of Truth in her Youth&#146;  (ibid., sig. B<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>In as far as the poetry can be read as biography, Southworth's early work, prior to 1684, extolling the virtues of retirement and retreat, is a pattern of feminine piety. In 1684, however, Southworth was arrested attending a Quaker meeting at James Wright's house in Warrington. Her first experience of imprisonment is rendered in heroic language:<blockquote>
<div>Tho' the Righteous be in Bonds confin'd,<br>
</div>
<div>They inwardly sweet Satisfaction find.<br>
</div> (Mollineux, 124)</blockquote>Southworth met her future husband, <a href="#cosubject_18913">Henry Mollineux [<i>see below</i>]</a>, while in Lancaster Castle. They were married eleven years&#151;from 10 April 1685 until Mary's death in 1696. John Tomkins describes her as &#145;a Loving Wife; an Affectionate Mother to her Children&#146;  (Tomkins, 50). They had two children, Othniel and Elleazor, both boys. Mollineux compares friendship with the trials of marriage:<blockquote>
<div>They that are unengag'd in Wedlock, seem<br>
</div>
<div>T'enjoy a Privledge of Liberty<br>
</div>
<div>To act Spontaneously.<br>
</div> (Mollineux, 162)</blockquote>The imprisonment of Henry in February 1691, for not appearing before the consistory court over non-payment of tithes, led Mary Mollineux into public conflict with the authorities, whom she engaged in scriptural debate. Answering Bishop Stratford of Chester in August in a way sufficient to convince him that Quakers should be treated with &#145;kindness&#146; and given their liberty, and arguing with vigour enough to stop the mouth of the bishop's chaplain, she was, nevertheless, accounted a woman with &#145;so much Learning it makes her mad&#146;. Even despite these victories, Henry was imprisoned, once more, by February 1692  (ibid., sig. B7<i>v</i>&#150;C<i>r</i>).<br>
<br>Mary Mollineux's poetry was published posthumously since, according to Tryall Ryder, &#145;she [was] not seeking Praise amongst Men, but to communicate the Exercise of peculiar Gifts amongst her near Friends and Acquaintance&#146;  (Mollineux, A7<i>v</i>). Indeed, such is the paradigmatic nature of her meditations on modesty and chastity, her preferment of &#145;Divine Contemplation&#146; over &#145;unprofitable Invention&#146;, her creative expression is noticeably circumscribed by constrictive notions of pious femininity  (ibid., A6<i>r</i>&#150;<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>On her deathbed, Mary Mollineux was &#145;seized with violent Pain and Sickness&#146;; this continued for a month until she was very weak and rarely achieved consciousness  (Mollineux, B2<i>r</i>). She died on 3 January 1696, in Liverpool, &#145;without any Noise, Sigh, or Groan&#146;; she was forty-four  (ibid., B3<i>v</i>).<br>
<br>
<a name="cosubject_18913"></a><span class="headword">Henry Mollineux</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1720) was born at Lydiate, near Ormskirk, Lancashire. His date of birth and parentage are uncertain. He may be either or neither of two Henry Molynex who were baptized in Aughton by Ormskirk: the son of Edward (14 August 1652) or, perhaps less likely, the son of Robert (28 September 1662). He was also a Quaker, and suffered imprisonment in 1684, 1691, and 1692  (Mollineux A8<i>v</i>, B7<i>r</i>, C<i>r</i>). On his marriage certificate he is listed as a yeoman. He was the author of <span class="italic">Anti-Christ Unveiled</span> (1695), <span class="italic">An Invitation from the Spirit of Christ</span> (1696), and <span class="italic">Popery Exposed</span> (1718), in addition to his testimony to Mary (included in <span class="italic">Fruits of Retirement</span>, sig. A8 <i>v</i>&#150;B8 <i>v</i>). Henry also contributed to the <span class="italic">Collection of Roger Haydock's Works</span> (1700). In 1698 he took part in a ministering campaign to Scotland, travelling with Daniel Rigby and Joseph Penington. He died at Lydiate on 16 February 1720.<br>
