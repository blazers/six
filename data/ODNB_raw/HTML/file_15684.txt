<span class="headword">Kirwan,  Francis</span>  (1589&#150;1661), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic bishop of Killala</span>, was born in Galway, the son of Matthew Kirwan, merchant, and Julia Lynch, both from long-established and wealthy merchant families of the city. He was educated there by his mother's uncle, a priest named Arthur Lynch. He then went to Lisbon, Portugal, to study at the Irish College founded there for the education of students for the priesthood in 1593. Poor health forced a premature return, but he completed his studies in Galway and was ordained priest there in 1614. In 1615 he went to France for further studies, and for a short time taught philosophy in the schools of the Congregation of the Oratory at Dieppe. In 1620 he returned to Ireland as vicar-general of Archbishop Conry of Tuam, who remained in exile for political reasons.<br>
<br>When the Wars of Religion ended in France in 1598 the ideals of the Counter-Reformation began to flourish there, and it was clear when he returned to Ireland that Kirwan had absorbed them to a considerable degree. Society in the west of Ireland was now so solidly Roman Catholic that he was in practice free to function. He based himself in his native Galway, where his social position would also have helped him. From there he carried out regular visitation of the extensive diocese, including the wild and trackless western parts and even the islands. Here especially he found much to reform, ignorance of even basic truths of religion among the laity, and a clergy not well equipped to instruct them or in some other respects to give them example.<br>
<br>Kirwan made great efforts to build up an educated and devoted priesthood. Before candidates were sent to seminaries in Europe they spent some time in his household in Galway, where they received training as envisaged by the reforms of the Council of Trent and as put in practice by such figures as St Charles Borromeo, archbishop of Milan, for whom Kirwan had a particular reverence. In a deeply traditional society he also had a wide-ranging social function, settling not only religious but also secular disputes with the approval of Roman Catholic magistrates. He combined his attachment to the new reforms with a native austerity, as was shown by his devotion to the traditional pilgrimages of Croagh Patrick and Lough Derg. A real shrewdness went with a thorough asceticism, exemplified in the reported case of the man he had ordered to take back the wife he had put away. It is said that the man claimed he would rather suffer the pains of hell than his wife's company, but changed his mind very quickly when invited to put his finger in a candle flame.<br>
<br>Archbishop Conry died in 1629 and was succeeded by Malachy O'Queely. O'Queely, though resident, asked Kirwan to continue as his vicar, and he agreed. But about 1636 Kirwan set out again for France, where he worked to develop the continental base so vital to the religious reorganization in Ireland. In Paris, however, despite his friendship with so influential a figure as St Vincent de Paul, he failed in his efforts to set up what would have been a second Irish seminary in the city.<br>
<br>Meanwhile, the archbishop of Tuam and others had procured Kirwan's appointment to the see of Killala. He accepted with real reluctance, and was consecrated bishop at St Vincent de Paul's headquarters, St Lazare, on 7 May 1645. He took possession of his see on 5 October 1646. In fact, much of his time was to be taken up with the political affairs of the Irish Confederate Catholics. He sided against the papal nuncio Rinuccini in the dispute which finally tore the Confederates apart in 1648 and arguably incurred excommunication, a fact which weighed very much on his conscience until he secured what he considered satisfactory absolution.<br>
<br>Oliver Cromwell landed in Ireland on 15 August 1649 and his military campaign ended with the surrender of Galway on 12 April 1652. After this Kirwan was a fugitive, dependent on what was inevitably the diminishing power of the Roman Catholic gentry to protect him. He made his way to Galway, where he finally gave himself up in 1654. For a time he was allowed to live under house arrest, but he was later imprisoned and then deported in the summer of 1655.<br>
<br>Kirwan arrived in Nantes in August, and two years later he went to Rennes, where he remained until his death. Many Irish exiles found refuge in Brittany, but most had to live in great poverty. Kirwan was fortunate to find a generous benefactor at Rennes, where he also helped the local bishop. He died there, deeply revered, on 27 August 1661. On his deathbed he was received into the Society of Jesus, whom he had always highly regarded, and on 29 August he was buried in their church in Rennes. A bronze plaque with a brief inscription was placed on his tomb.<br>
