<span class="headword">Herle, Sir  William</span>  (<em>b. </em>in or before 1270, <em>d.</em> 1347), <span class="occ">justice</span>, was probably born some time before 1270, since his first appointment as an attorney for litigation in the common bench was in 1291, and he must already then have been of age. His surname is apparently derived from Kirkharle in Northumberland. He may be the William Herle who acquired property there in 1304; he is certainly the William Herle who was granted free warren in his demesne lands there in 1332 and who also acquired lands elsewhere in Northumberland. He may be the William, son of William Herle, who is mentioned as the tenant of one-fifth of a knight's fee at Kirkharle in an inquisition <i>post mortem</i> of 1310, and whose father, another William (grandfather of William the justice), is known to have died in 1307. William and his brother Robert are both known to have acquired extensive properties in Leicestershire from the last decade of the thirteenth century onwards, and Robert was described in a conspiracy case of 1299 as a &#145;conspirator&#146; active in Leicestershire, Warwickshire, and Staffordshire. It seems possible that the brothers had inherited some connection with Leicestershire, perhaps through their mother.<br>
<br>William Herle began practising as one of the serjeants of the common bench in Michaelmas term 1299, and seems to have been one of several serjeants called to the common-bench bar at that time. Final concord authorizations and law reports show him in regular attendance in the court until 1320. His success at the bar is also shown by the fact that early in the reign of Edward II he was retained by the city of London as one of its counsel, and that in 1315 he became a king's serjeant. Early in Michaelmas term 1320 he replaced John Benstead as a junior justice of the common bench and around this time he was knighted. For three terms in 1321 he was absent from the court while sitting as a justice of the London eyre, hearing civil pleas and <i>quo warranto</i> cases with the chief justice, Hervey Staunton. Otherwise he served continuously as a junior justice of the common bench, until he replaced Staunton as chief justice of the same court early in Hilary term 1327. He left court after Trinity term 1329 to serve as chief justice of the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire eyres of 1330&#150;31, but returned to the common bench, as its chief justice, in Easter term 1331; he relinquished this post at the end of Trinity term 1335, though he lived for another twelve years.<br>
<br>Herle's wife, Margaret, is first mentioned in a final concord relating to their joint acquisition of the reversion to lands at Bourton-on-Dunsmore in Warwickshire in 1311. She was dead by 1339, when William sought a licence to grant property to Garendon Abbey in Leicestershire in return for the provision of a monk to celebrate mass for William, his son Robert, the deceased Margaret, and William's deceased brother Robert. There seems to be no contemporary evidence to support Nichols's suggestion that Margaret was the daughter of Philip Courtney, or other later suggestions which make her the daughter and heir of one William Polglas. Herle died on 26 March 1347. His heir was his son Robert, who died without issue in 1364, when the Herle lands passed to Ralph Hastings, the son of Robert's sister Margaret.<br>
