<span class="headword">Clenock <span class="st"> [Clenocke]</span>,  Maurice</span> <span class="st"> [Morys Clynnog]</span>  (<em>c.</em>1525&#150;1580?), <span class="occ">Roman Catholic ecclesiastic and administrator</span>, was probably born in Clynnog Fawr, Caernarvonshire. He was educated at Oxford, possibly at Christ Church, proceeding BCL in 1548 after more than twelve years of study, by his own account. He lectured there on civil law for six years. He claimed to have studied law for a further eight years in Louvain (as well as theology for two years), Bologna and Padua, probably after he left England in 1559. He compounded for the rectorship of Gatcombe, Isle of Wight, to which Sir Geoffrey Pole had presented him, on 4 September 1554. He had become prebendary of Botevant in York Minster by 22 July 1556, but almost certainly never resided and resigned on 25 February 1561. Cardinal Pole appointed him dean of Shoreham and Croydon on 31 August 1557, after Clenock had obtained the rectory of Shoreham through other means, as well as that of Orpington, Kent, from Pole. Clenock was then identified as Pole's chaplain and domestic. He alleged that Pole made him chancellor of the prerogative court of Canterbury and dean of Canterbury peculiars, as well as legatine auditor, confessor to Pole and his household, and the cardinal's almoner and personal secretary, but only the first (between about August and October 1558) can be documented and Clenock was unusually called &#145;custos&#146;; most of the rest seems unlikely, since Pole never identified him as anything more than chaplain, whether in an act of December 1557 or in his will, which Clenock witnessed.<br>
<br>Thomas Goldwell, bishop of St Asaph, presented Clenock to the rectory of Corwen or Curr Owen on 20 November 1556. He was probably the &#145;Mr Maurice&#146; who had a room in Lambeth Palace at Pole's death in 1558. At about that time he was nominated bishop of Bangor, but was never consecrated. When Elizabeth came to the throne he is said to have surrendered his preferments and to have had a licence to leave the realm, but he was certainly deprived of Orpington, perhaps not until 27 December 1566. Although in 1560 he accompanied Pole's former agent, Vincenzo Parpaglia, on an abortive mission to Elizabeth, by the following year he was urging Cardinal Morone, protector of England, to induce Philip II to depose the queen. Thereafter he went first to Louvain and then to Rome, about 1563, perhaps in company with Goldwell, although they very quickly came to head opposing factions there. Probably after his arrival in Rome an anonymous reporter judged him &#145;a good man, but &hellip; no preacher&#146; and suitable for Bangor, should the pope decide to fill the see.<br>
<br>Once in Rome, Clenock became Morone's client. By 1564 he had entered the English Hospice, and in the following year became its warden; he kept rooms there until 1578. He almost immediately found himself in conflict with a faction of the hospice led by Nicholas Morton, which was backed by Goldwell. An attempt to depose Clenock in 1565 was thwarted by Parpaglia and Morone's auditor. Elected warden again in 1567 Clenock refused and became a chamberlain instead, a position which he held again in 1569&#150;71 and 1573, at which time he was said to be without means of subsistence. His catechism, <span class="italic">Athravaeth Gristnogaul</span> (&#145;Christian teaching&#146;), with an introduction by Gruffydd Robert, appeared in Milan in 1568.<br>
<br>In 1575 and 1576, probably in co-operation with Owen Lewis, Clenock drafted several detailed plans for an invasion of England. He also proposed that Lewis be made a cardinal. During the discussions of these plans in Rome the decision was taken to convert the hospice into a college, and on 26 May 1576 Clenock again became warden. Within a year a proposal was floated that the Jesuits take over. The English students quickly rebelled against Clenock's government, alleging among other things that he favoured Welshmen. Morone firmly backed Clenock, separating hospice and college and extending Clenock's term as warden of the latter to two years and then making him perpetual rector in 1578, assisted by two (later three) Jesuits. Clenock traced the origins of his terminal difficulties to his refusal to remove Goldwell from his rooms at the hospice. Morone, in tandem with Lewis, tried to quash the rebellion, but the English party with backing from the Jesuit Robert Persons induced Pope Gregory XIII to remove Clenock, probably on the grounds that he was interfering with their missionary vocation. Clenock retired to Rouen and, embarking thence for Spain, was drowned at sea, probably in 1580.<br>
