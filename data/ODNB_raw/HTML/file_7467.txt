<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Demainbray,  Stephen Charles Triboudet</span>  (1710&#150;1782), <span class="occ">natural philosopher and astronomer</span>, was born on 20 February 1710 in the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Westminster, London, the son of Stephen Triboudet Demainbray of that parish and his wife, Marie Rigaud, daughter of Alexandre de Schivac, minister of the French church in Bristol. Demainbray's parents were Huguenots who had come to Britain with William III. They died when he was a small child, and he was subsequently brought up by his uncle, and then in the family of John Theophilus Desaguliers. He was educated at Westminster School and by Desaguliers, and as the latter was then the most influential lecturer in natural philosophy in England, Demainbray became familiar with the business of lecturing. In 1727, at the age of seventeen, he married Mary Warshare (<i>d</i>. before 1755) of Embden, and left England to study at the University of Leiden, in the Netherlands. About 1731 he became a freemason, and joined a French lodge in London.<br>
<br>In the 1740s Demainbray ran a school in Edinburgh for young ladies learning French and English. His teaching career was interrupted when he volunteered for the British army and took part in the battle of Prestonpans on 21 September 1745. By 1747 he had experimented on the effect of electricity on plant growth and published letters on the subject in the <span class="italic">Caledonian Mercury</span> and <span class="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. Although he did not pursue this work further, these letters brought him to the attention of savants such as Stephen Hales and Abb&eacute; Nollet. During the winter of 1748&#150;9 he took up lecturing on natural philosophy. Having left Edinburgh in early 1749, he gave courses of lectures in Newcastle, Durham, and Sunderland. By December he was in York, where he met the instrument maker Henry Hindley, from whom he acquired a pyrometer to demonstrate in his lectures. Demainbray lectured next in Leeds in April 1750. His growing reputation led to his being awarded an LLD degree by King's College, Aberdeen, the following July.<br>
<br>By August 1751 Demainbray was in Dublin. There, through James Simon, a wine merchant and antiquarian, he made contact with Henry Baker, a teacher of deaf people and writer on the microscope, in London. In 1753 he left Dublin for France, and during the next year he travelled to Bordeaux, Montpellier, where his wife died, Lyons, and Toulouse. In each of these towns he lectured to the local academy and became an associate member in recognition of his work. His success was in part due to the fact that the members of these academies had a growing interest in Newtonian philosophy. In Lyons he collected models of machines, including some he copied from M. De Grollier's collection, which he later demonstrated in his lectures in London. In the autumn of 1754, on the eve of the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, he returned to London, having visited Paris on the way.<br>
<br>In London, on 1 February 1755, Demainbray remarried. His new wife was Sarah Horne, whose father, John, was the royal poulterer. Later that month Demainbray offered a course of lectures on natural and experimental philosophy at his house in Panton Street, near the Haymarket. Soon afterwards he lectured to the prince of Wales, later George III, and Prince Edward. One consequence of this royal patronage was that Demainbray introduced his brother-in-law, John Horne (later <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/27545/', "John Horne Tooke")</script>), to the prince of Wales, a connection that eventually caused much embarrassment for Demainbray when Horne became a staunch supporter of John Wilkes and opponent of the king.<br>
<br>Unfortunately for Demainbray and others, lecturing on natural philosophy could not provide sufficient income in the later 1750s. In an attempt to increase his audience, Demainbray offered a course on natural history. During 1758 he moved from Panton Street to an &#145;experiment-room&#146; in Carey Street, but his fortunes did not improve and he gave up these premises early in 1759. He made a last attempt to give a &#145;Popular and practical course of experimental philosophy&#146; in 1761, but it was not a success. During a visit to Britain two years later the French astronomer Lalande heard that Demainbray had abandoned physics and could not even be bothered to show his instruments to Benjamin Franklin.<br>
<br>When George III, his old pupil, came to the throne in 1760, Demainbray's hopes of royal patronage rose. He became an official of the customs, and eventually found a sinecure connected with natural philosophy. In 1768 he was appointed superintendent of the king's new observatory at Richmond. Kew observatory, as it was known, was built for the king to observe the transit of Venus that occurred on 4 June 1769. The significance of this rare event was that it was possible, from measurements made at different places on earth as Venus crossed the disc of the sun, to calculate the size of the solar system; numerous expeditions were mounted to observe the transit in remote parts of the world.<br>
<br>In the years following the transit Demainbray spent his time recording the weather, perhaps giving a few lectures, and checking the clocks that provided time for parliament. He died on 20 February 1782 at Northolt, Middlesex, where he was living at the time and where he was buried. His son, <a name="cosubject_7468"></a><span class="headword">Stephen George Francis Triboudet Demainbray</span>  (<em>c.</em>1759&#150;1854), succeeded him as <span class="occ">superintendent at Kew</span>. The younger Demainbray was also a royal chaplain. He was assisted at the observatory by his brother-in-law Stephen Rigaud, and then by his nephew <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/23642/', "S. P. Rigaud (1774&#150;1839)")</script>, who later became professor of astronomy at Oxford and a historian of science.<br>
