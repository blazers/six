<span class="headword">Kinnaird,  George William Fox</span>, ninth Lord Kinnaird of Inchture, Baron Rossie, and first Baron Kinnaird of Rossie  (1807&#150;1878), <span class="occ">landowner</span>, eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15632/', "Charles Kinnaird, eighth Lord Kinnaird of Inchture (1780&#150;1826)")</script>, and his wife, Lady Olivia Letitia Catherine (1787&#150;1858), daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9588/', "William Robert Fitzgerald, second duke of Leinster")</script>, was born on 14 April 1807 at Drimmie House, Perthshire&#151;the family mansion before the erection of Rossie Priory. He was educated at Eton College, and then entered the army as an officer of the guards; he afterwards transferred to the Connaught Rangers. He succeeded to the Scottish peerage on the death of his father, on 11 December 1826, having resigned his commission. In recognition of his father's and grandfather's support for the Liberal Party, in 1831 Kinnaird was, on the recommendation of Earl Grey, raised to the rank of a peer of the United Kingdom, with the title of Baron Rossie of Rossie, the name of a portion of the family estates at Inchture, Perthshire. In 1860 a further title was added&#151;that of Baron Kinnaird of Rossie, which could be inherited by his brother and his heirs male. On 14 December 1837 Kinnaird married the Hon. Frances Anna Georgiana Ponsonby (1817&#150;1910), daughter of Lord de Mauley; they had two sons and one daughter, all of whom predeceased him.<br>
<br>A considerable part of Kinnaird's youth was spent in Italy. Like his father he was very interested in archaeology, and he conducted important excavations near Rome which resulted in the discovery of a number of Roman antiquities; these were later preserved at Rossie Priory. On 15 January 1840 Kinnaird was made a privy councillor; he was chosen a knight of the Order of the Thistle on 6 July 1857. He was appointed lord lieutenant of Perthshire on 28 February 1866, a position he held until his death.<br>
<br>As a large landowner Kinnaird, unlike many of his contemporaries, insisted on becoming personally involved in agricultural issues. Acknowledging the need for modernization he was one of the earliest reformers of the old style of husbandry prevailing in the Carse of Gowrie. His interest in farm mechanization led to the introduction of steam ploughs, threshing machines, and other agricultural implements on his estate in Scotland. He sought energetically to improve the condition of the labouring classes, organizing evening schools for the ploughmen and establishing free reading-rooms and libraries about his estate. It was largely through his exertions that the railway system in the east of Scotland was developed, and the line connecting Perth and Dundee, which ran through part of his property, was constructed with his guidance. He helped to found and maintain industrial schools throughout the country, and his philanthropic aims extended to the reform of criminals, especially young offenders.<br>
<br>Kinnaird's principal legislative work was the drafting of the important measure for the closing of public houses on Sunday, known as the <span class="roman">Forbes Mackenzie Act</span> from the name of William Forbes Mackenzie, MP for Peeblesshire, who introduced it in the House of Commons. It received the royal assent in 1853. Kinnaird was particularly interested in the issue of smoke pollution, the reform of the Royal Mint (on which subject he wrote several pamphlets), and the regulation of mines. He was chairman of the mining commission. As a Liberal politician he took a prominent part in the agitation for free trade, and was personally associated with David Ricardo, Richard Cobden, and John Bright; he took the role of chairman at an important meeting of the Anti-Corn Law League at Covent Garden Theatre. Kinnaird's liberal views were also shown by his aid to Polish refugees, and his friendship with Giuseppe Mazzini and with Garibaldi.<br>
<br>Kinnaird also had a wide-ranging interest in science. He spent some time in developing photography with Fox Talbot, and in forming an extensive geological collection, with the aid of Sir Charles Lyell. Kinnaird died at Rossie Priory on 6 January 1878, in his seventy-first year, and was buried four days later at Old Rossie. The titles and estates fell at his death to his eldest surviving brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/15631/', "Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird")</script>.<br>
