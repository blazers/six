<span class="headword">&Eacute;tampes,  Theobald  d'</span>  (<em>c.</em>1060&#150;<em>c.</em>1125), <span class="occ">teacher and theologian</span>, took his name from &Eacute;tampes in the &Icirc;le-de-France, where he was born. He spent his youth at Caen, in the abbey of St &Eacute;tienne, where he would have known Lanfranc (<i>d</i>. 1089). His correspondence with Queen Margaret of Scotland (<i>d</i>. 1093) shows that there was some exploration of the possibility that he might become one of her chaplains&#151;one which attests his ambition, and maybe also an early consciousness of exceptional ability which he wanted to have recognized.<br>
<br>Perhaps before 1089 Theobald went to England, at a time when other scholars from the region were doing the same thing, but not, apparently, to join Lanfranc, as so many others did, but to settle in Oxford. Oxford had a nascent school of some importance from about the time Robert Bloet became bishop of Lincoln in 1094, which was fostered by Walter of Oxford, archdeacon of Oxford from 1111&#150;12. Walter seems to have invited visiting lecturers to the school attached to his collegiate church of St George in the Castle, and Theobald was apparently one of the first and most notable of these.<br>
<br>Theobald is the author of a number of surviving letters in which he describes himself variously as doctor of Caen, master of Caen, and master at Oxford. Several of these letters show him to be a highly competent theologian, and well versed in the topics of the day. Before he went to Oxford he had written to Philip, a friend, on the sins of the flesh, taking the view that lust was less serious than pride. To the bishop of Lincoln he wrote, now as an Oxford master, on penitence and confession in a context of scriptural interpretation; he wrote to Abbot Faricius (<i>d</i>. 1117) of nearby Abingdon to insist that he had never taught that unbaptized infants would be saved. The most important of these theological letters is one to Roscelin de Compi&egrave;gne, a grammarian who had attacked both Anselm of Canterbury and Peter Abelard; Theobald's letter discusses the current issue of the eligibility for holy orders of the sons of priests (in which there was recognized to be potential for nepotism).<br>
<br>Theobald took part in a debate at the beginning of the twelfth century on the question whether a monk ought also to be a priest (taking the view that he should not). The <span class="italic">Rescriptum cuiusdam pro monachis</span> (<i>c</i>.1132&#150;3), written by an anonymous monk in response to Theobald, makes the point that there is no better life than the monastic, and condemns his teaching on the parochial rights of monks. Theobald is attacked as an insignificant little clerk, who is still merely a grammar master, although he had more than 100 pupils. This condemnation must be read as an attempt to diminish the reputation of a teacher of theology who was in fact of considerable standing, and evidently active in the controversies of a highly controversial period.<br>
