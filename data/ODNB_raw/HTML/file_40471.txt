<span class="headword">L&ouml;hr,  Marie Kaye Wouldes</span>  (1890&#150;1975), <span class="occ">actress</span>, was born on 28 July 1890 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, the daughter of Lewis J. L&ouml;hr, treasurer of the opera house, Melbourne, and his English wife, Kate Bishop (1848&#150;1923), who had acted on the London stage for twenty years and had been a member of the original cast of <span class="italic">Our Boys</span> at the Vaudeville Theatre in 1875: she was the sister of Alfred Bishop (1848&#150;1928), the actor&#150;manager. Marie L&ouml;hr first appeared on stage at the age of four in <span class="italic">The World Against her</span> in Sydney, and after moving to England made her London d&eacute;but in 1901 at the Garrick Theatre in <span class="italic">Shockheaded Peter</span>, a children's play by Philip Carr and Nigel Playfair, and <span class="italic">The Man who Stole the Castle</span>. She first went on tour with her godparents, the actors William and Madge Kendal, in 1902, and continued to tour with the Kendals until 1907.<br>
<br>After the Kendals retired in 1908 L&ouml;hr embarked on a successful acting career, playing Mrs Reginald Bridgenorth in the original production of G. B. Shaw's <span class="italic">Getting Married</span> at the Haymarket Theatre in 1908. She was closely associated with Herbert Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty's Theatre, playing the part of Margaret in <span class="italic">Faust</span> in 1908, and Lydia in a revival of Shaw's <span class="italic">The Admirable Bashville</span> in 1909. Also in 1909 she was Lady Teazle to Tree's Sir Peter Teazle in R. B. Sheridan's <span class="italic">The School for Scandal</span> and Ophelia to his Hamlet. W. Somerset Maugham wrote the part of a country-bred parlourmaid for her in <span class="italic">Smith</span> (1909), and in 1911 she appeared with Sir John Hare (1844&#150;1921) in <span class="italic">The Marionettes</span> by Gladys Unger, and <span class="italic">Better not Enquire</span>. She married Anthony Leyland Val (1888&#150;1942), son of Val Prinsep RA, in 1911: they had one daughter. She continued to act leading roles for several West End managers, including Gerald Du Maurier and Charles Frohman, until January 1918, when in partnership with her husband she took on the management of the Globe Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue (opened as the Hicks Theatre in 1906 and renamed the Globe in 1909). They opened in 1918 with Somerset Maugham's <span class="italic">Love in a Cottage</span>, and she went on to appear in several successful productions at the Globe, including <span class="italic">Nurse Benson</span> by R. C. Carton and J. H. McCarthy (1918), <span class="italic">The Voice from the Minaret</span> by R. S. Hichens (1919), and <span class="italic">A Marriage of Convenience</span> by Sydney Grundy (1920). After her New York d&eacute;but in 1922 as Lady Caryll in <span class="italic">The Voice from the Minaret</span> she returned to the Globe to appear in successful productions of <span class="italic">The Return</span> and Alfred Sutro's <span class="italic">The Laughing Lady</span> in the autumn of 1922. Her final role at the Globe was as the Hon. Margot Tatham in Frederick Lonsdales's <span class="italic">Aren't we All?</span> in 1923. After this she retired from active management of the theatre and was replaced as leading lady by Margaret Bannerman, who became Anthony Prinsep's second wife after he and Marie L&ouml;hr were divorced in 1928, when Prinsep also gave up the management of the Globe. L&ouml;hr continued to pursue a successful career as a light comedy actress. At Christmas 1927 she made the first of several appearances as Mrs Darling in J. M. Barrie's <span class="italic">Peter Pan</span>, and her successes in the 1930s included roles in Somerset Maugham's <span class="italic">The Breadwinner</span> (1930), Dodie Smith's <span class="italic">Call it a Day</span> (1935), Esther McCracken's <span class="italic">Quiet Wedding</span> (1938), and Lynne Dexter's <span class="italic">Other People's Houses</span> (1941). She played in several musicals, including <span class="italic">Casanova</span> (1932), and Ivor Novello's <span class="italic">Crest of the Wave</span> (1937).<br>
<br>L&ouml;hr was also a popular film actress, first appearing in the film version of <span class="italic">Aren't we All?</span> in 1932. Two of her best performances were in films of plays by G. B. Shaw, as Mrs Higgins in <span class="italic">Pygmalion</span> (1938), and as Lady Britomart in <span class="italic">Major Barbara</span> (1941), and in 1942 she was in the cast of the wartime thriller <span class="italic">Went the Day Well?</span> After several years' absence from the stage, she returned in 1947 in <span class="italic">Caste</span> by T. W. Robertson at the Duke of York's Theatre, and she continued to act in the West End for the next twenty years. She had parts in Terence Rattigan's <span class="italic">A Harlequinade</span> (1948), John Whiting's <span class="italic">A Penny for a Song</span> (1951), William Douglas-Home's <span class="italic">The Manor of Northstead</span> (1954), and No&euml;l Coward's <span class="italic">Waiting in the Wings</span> (1960). She also continued to appear in musicals, including <span class="italic">Jubilee Girl</span>, which opened in Bristol in 1956, although it was so poorly received that she left the cast before its London opening. She took the part of Lady Bracknell in <span class="italic">Half in Earnest</span> (1958), a musical based on Oscar Wilde's <span class="italic">The Importance of being Earnest</span>, performed to inaugurate the new Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, and she was in John Osborne's <span class="italic">The World of Paul Slickey</span> (1959), which was booed on the opening night, and lasted only six weeks in the West End. She made her last stage appearance in 1966 as Mrs Whitefield in a revival of Shaw's <span class="italic">Man and Superman</span>. She died on 21 January 1975 at her home in Brighton, 24 Harrington Road, and was buried in the Brompton cemetery, West London, on 30 January.<br>
