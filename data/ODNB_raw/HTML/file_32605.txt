<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Hardy,  Herbert Hardy  Cozens-</span>, first Baron Cozens-Hardy  (1838&#150;1920), <span class="occ">judge</span>, was born Herbert Hardy Cozens on 22 November 1838 at The Lodge, Letheringsett, Holt, Norfolk, the second son of William Hardy Cozens-Hardy (1806&#150;1895), a former solicitor with a large practice at Norwich, and his wife, Sarah (1808&#150;1891), daughter of Thomas Theobald, a textile manufacturer of the same city. When he was four years old the family moved to Letheringsett Hall. In the same year, 1842, his surname changed to Cozens-Hardy when his father, who was a supporter of the Wesleyan reform movement and was subsequently a member of the United Methodist Free Churches, inherited the estate of his uncle, William Hardy (1770&#150;1842), the son of the diarist <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/48935/', "Mary Hardy")</script>. Educated at Amersham Hall School and at University College, London, Cozens-Hardy graduated at London University in 1858. He took the degree of LLB in 1863, and afterwards became a member of the senate of London University and a fellow of University College, London. In 1862 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn after obtaining a studentship and a certificate of honour. He read in the chambers of Thomas Lewin and James Dickinson, both eminent as equity draftsmen. On 26 July 1866 he married Maria (<i>d</i>. 1886), the daughter of Thomas Hepburn, of Clapham Common; they had two sons and two daughters. Between 1871 and 1876 he was an examiner for London University in equity and real property law.<br>
<br>Cozens-Hardy soon acquired practice as a Chancery junior, his nonconformist and Liberal connections being considerable assets. After twenty busy years he took silk in 1882. Attaching himself at first to the court of Mr Justice Fry, he took his seat before Mr Justice North when Fry went to the Court of Appeal in 1883. He proved so successful as a leader that in 1893 he joined the small band of &#145;specials&#146; of which John Rigby and Horace Davey were also members. In this distinguished company he held his own, and was constantly employed in heavy cases both in the Chancery Division and before the appellate tribunals.<br>
<br>A layman &#145;would have been puzzled to understand&#146; Cozens-Hardy's success as an advocate  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). Although he was of unimpressive appearance, and without the vigour of Rigby or the subtlety of Davey, he had industry, knowledge, and lucidity of speech, and judges listened to him with respect. He was kindly and courteous, and his popularity with the practising members of the profession was shown by his election as chairman of the general council of the bar. Among the important cases in which he appeared as counsel were <i>Sheffield v. London Joint Stock Bank</i> (1888, the right of a bank to sell securities deposited by a borrower with limited authority), <i>Bradford Corporation v. Pickles</i> (1895, the effect of a malicious motive on the lawful use of property), <i>Trego v. Hunt</i> (1896, the right of the seller of a business to canvass his old customers), and <i>Attorney-General v. Beech</i> (1899, the liability of a remainderman who has bought a life interest to pay estate duty).<br>
<br>At the general election of 1885 Cozens-Hardy was elected Liberal member of parliament for North Norfolk, and he continued to sit for the constituency until elevated to the bench in 1899. In the House of Commons, although never a prominent figure, he was a not infrequent speaker. As a rule he confined himself to matters of which he had professional or local knowledge, such as married women's property, the winding-up of companies, bankruptcy, and the law relating to trustees. His most notable achievement was the passing of an act relating to the law of mortmain, which was known among Chancery lawyers as <span class="roman">Cozens-Hardy's Act</span>. In 1886, when the Liberal Party split on the subject of home rule for Ireland, Cozens-Hardy remained faithful to Gladstone, having in May 1886 been wavering towards Joseph Chamberlain and the Liberal Unionist defectors. He was never a violent partisan in the politically disruptive period which followed.<br>
<br>In February 1899 the death of Lord Justice Chitty and the promotion to his place of Sir Robert Romer created a vacancy in the Chancery Division. Lord Halsbury, who was not ordinarily predisposed towards political opponents, disregarded Cozens-Hardy's Liberalism, and with the full approval of the profession raised him to the bench. He received the customary knighthood. Halsbury offered the post in a letter of 21 February 1899 beginning: &#145;My dear Cozens-Hardy. Notwithstanding your abominable politics I think you are the fittest person to succeed Romer &hellip;&#146;  (Heuston, 59). The incident inspired Theo Mathew to produce a cartoon entitled &#145;Kiss me&#151;Hardy&#146;  (Mathew, 70). As a judge Cozens-Hardy showed the industry and care that had marked his work at the bar. His findings of fact were more often criticized than his decisions on points of law. In November 1901, on the resignation of Lord Justice Rigby, he became a lord justice of appeal and was sworn of the privy council.<br>
<br>In March 1907 Cozens-Hardy succeeded Sir Richard Henn Collins as master of the rolls. In this onerous office he performed his duties with ability and dignity. Appeals under the <span class="roman">Workmen's Compensation Act</span> of 1906 were numerous, and Cozens-Hardy, although unversed in this branch of the law, dealt with them satisfactorily. His familiarity with equity law and practice made him a strong president of the court when Chancery appeals were being heard. Many of his judgments as master of the rolls stood the test of appeal, and afterwards proved of value to his successors. They were marked &#145;by clarity of reasoning and succinctness of expression&#146;  (<span class="italic">The Times</span>). In 1913 he was one of the three commissioners of the great seal during the absence in Canada of the lord chancellor, Lord Haldane, and in July 1914 he was raised to the peerage with the title Baron Cozens-Hardy of Letheringsett. For some years he chaired the Council of Legal Education; he was also a chairman of quarter sessions in Norfolk. His chief interests outside law were gardening and religion, and he was a frequent speaker at the Whitefield Tabernacle while his son-in-law the Revd Charles Silvester Horne was the minister there. His health had been failing for many months before his retirement in April 1918. He died at Letheringsett Hall on 18 June 1920, and was buried at Kensal Green. He was succeeded as second baron by his eldest son, William Hepburn Cozens-Hardy KC (1868&#150;1924), who sat as Liberal coalitionist MP for South Norfolk (1918&#150;20).<br>
