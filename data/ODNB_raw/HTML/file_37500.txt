<span class="headword">Hackworth,  Timothy</span>  (1786&#150;1850), <span class="occ">locomotive engineer</span>, was born on 22 December 1786 in Wylam, Northumberland, the eldest of three sons and five daughters of John Hackworth (<i>d</i>. 1802), master blacksmith at Wylam colliery, and his wife, Elizabeth Sanderson of Newcastle. He went to Wylam School and at the age of fourteen was apprenticed, initially to his father, who died the following year. He showed a natural aptitude for mechanical construction, and on completing his apprenticeship he was appointed to his late father's post at the colliery. There he was involved in experiments with steam locomotion. In 1812 Hackworth and Jonathan Foster, the colliery engine-wright, were responsible for the <i>Wylam Grasshopper</i> and in 1813 for the <i>Wylam Dilly</i>, two locomotives incorporating novel means of propulsion.<br>
<br>In 1816 Hackworth regretfully left Wylam colliery, because Sunday work offended his Methodist principles, and became foreman blacksmith at the nearby Walbottle colliery. In 1825 he became locomotive superintendent, and also manager and contractor, for the Stockton and Darlington, Britain's first public railway. Its early locomotives were unreliable, and in 1827 the owners' committee authorized Hackworth to build a new one to his own design. The result was the <i>Royal George</i>, a marked advance on previous types, which established the effectiveness of the steam locomotive. It had two vertical cylinders with direct rod drive to cast-iron wheels with shrunk-on tyres of wrought iron, the first of their type; most importantly, it pioneered the discharge of exhaust steam through a converging nozzle blast pipe in the chimney, greatly increasing combustion intensity and steam production. It was also the first to use controlled pre-heating of boiler feed-water. Twelve similar locomotives, with further improvements, were built. In 1830 Hackworth built the <i>Globe</i>, which had inside cylinders and crank axle, and a boiler with transverse water tubes running through the main flue&#151;a forerunner of the Galloway patent boiler.<br>
<br>In 1840 Hackworth left the Stockton and Darlington Railway to concentrate on his own engineering business, conducted from new workshops at New Shildon, co. Durham, where locomotive, marine, and industrial engines and boilers were built. As well as supplying a number of British railway companies, the firm supplied some of the earliest locomotives for Russia and Canada.<br>
<br>Hackworth was one of the great pioneers of the steam locomotive and the eminent railway engineer D. K. Clark stated in 1855 that no single individual had, up to the year 1830, done so much for the improvement of the locomotive. He had the reputation of a kindly man, much respected by those who worked for him. He was elected to the British Association for the Advancement of Science. His <i>Sanspareil</i>, which competed unsuccessfully in the Rainhill locomotive trials of 1829, instituted by the directors of the London and Manchester Railway and won by the <i>Rocket</i> of Robert Stephenson, gave excellent service on the Bolton and Leigh Railway until 1844 and subsequently became an exhibit at the Science Museum, London.<br>
<br>In 1813 Hackworth married Jane Golightly, who shared his devout Methodism. They had three sons and six daughters; the eldest son, John Wesley Hackworth (1820&#150;1891), carried on the business after his father's death, which took place from typhus on 7 July 1850 at his home, Soho, Shildon, co. Durham. He is commemorated by the Timothy Hackworth Museum at Shildon.<br>
