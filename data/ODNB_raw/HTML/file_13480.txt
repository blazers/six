<span class="headword">Holborne, Sir  Robert</span>  (1598&#150;1648), <span class="occ">barrister and politician</span>, was born to a gentry background on 15 November 1598, the eldest son of Nicholas Holborne (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1570&#150;1620) of Chichester, Sussex. His mother was possibly Anne (<i>fl</i>. <i>c</i>.1570&#150;1620), sister of John Lane. Holborne began his legal education at Furnival's Inn before entering Lincoln's Inn on 9 November 1615 and was called to the bar in 1623. He married Anne (<i>d</i>. 1663), daughter of Sir Robert Dudley, the illegitimate heir of the Elizabethan courtier Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. Holborne was steward for a Sussex manor in 1622 and was involved in further land transactions in that county in 1628 and 1636. Through his marriage Holborne acquired an interest in his wife's Warwickshire lands valued at &pound;80 a year.<br>
<br>During the 1630s Holborne emerged as a critic of the fiscal policies of Charles I's personal rule (1629&#150;40) during which the king governed without parliament or aid of parliamentary subsidy. Along with Oliver St John he served as counsel for John Hampden in the ship money case, making an elaborate four-day argument from 2 to 5 December 1637. His distaste for the fiscal measures of the personal rule persisted and in 1639 he attacked tonnage and poundage on behalf of a merchant's widow. In 1640 he became a bencher of his inn and sat in the Short Parliament for Southwark speaking occasionally on issues relating to parliamentary subsidies and the legality of ship money. In the Long Parliament he sat for the borough of St Michael, Cornwall, which he may have procured through his association with members of the Arundell family with whom he had been familiar at Lincoln's Inn. In parliament he emerged as a leading royalist, changing sides probably for reasons of religion. Holborne championed both episcopacy and the legislative autonomy of the clerical estate against a rising tide of Erastian sentiment in the early Long Parliament. On 15 December 1640 he confronted his former ally and co-counsel Oliver St John and John Pym over the legality of the 1640 canons passed by convocation after the dissolution of the Short Parliament. Holborne argued that not only could convocation make canons by royal assent alone without parliamentary confirmation but also that these canons could bind the laity provided that they &#145;weere not against law&#146;  (D'Ewes, 152). Holborne argued further that the king was within his right to continue convocation by separate commission after the dissolution of parliament, citing numerous precedents that his opponent Sir Simonds D'Ewes described as &#145;being very dangerous examples&#146;  (ibid., 153). In the spring of 1641 Holborne both opposed in the house and ultimately voted against the attainder of the earl of Strafford. In November of that year he spoke in defence of the impeached twelve bishops on charges of high crimes and misdemeanours. His last committee appointment in the House of Commons was 29 March 1642 and he appears to have absented himself soon afterwards.<br>
<br>Later in the same year Holborne reappeared, having joined the king at Oxford, where he published <span class="italic">The reading in Lincolnes-Inne, Feb. 28. 1641: vpon the stat. of 25.E.3. cap. 2., being the Statute of Treasons</span>. At Oxford the king made him attorney-general to the prince of Wales, knighting him on 19 January 1643. He also received the degrees of MA and DCL from the University of Oxford on 1 November 1642 and 7 February 1643. Also about this time the Long Parliament sequestrated his estates. He was probably not, as the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span> recorded, the author of <span class="italic">The Freeholders Grand Inquest</span> (1648), a tract that more recent scholarship has convincingly reattributed to Sir Robert Filmer. However, it is possible that Holborne was among those whom Filmer consulted in the composition of the tract. He was an avid follower of astrology, being a devotee of William Lilly, at one point paying &pound;100 to Nicholas Fiske for the calculation of his nativity. He died childless, in London or Middlesex, and was buried under Lincoln's Inn chapel on 16 February 1648.<br>
