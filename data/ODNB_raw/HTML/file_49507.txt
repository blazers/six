<span class="headword">Milner,  William</span>  (1662&#150;1740), <span class="occ">woollen cloth merchant</span>, was born on 29 November 1662 at Leeds, the third and youngest son of William Milner of Leeds, a merchant. Of dissenting stock, he recalled towards the end of his long life that he had enjoyed a &#145;pious upbringing&#146; and &#145;tolerable schole learning&#146;. In the late 1670s and early 1680s he spent five years in the Netherlands gaining a thorough knowledge of business and accounts. On his return he married, in 1685, Mary (<i>d</i>. 1745), the daughter of Joshua Ibbetson, a merchant, and mayor of the town in that same year, and his wife, Mary, the daughter of Christopher Breary, lord mayor of York in 1666.<br>
<br>Milner maintained that he started life as a cloth merchant in Leeds from &#145;no very great beginnings&#146;, although it is clear that his expensive training abroad and marriage into one of the leading merchant dynasties in Leeds thrust him into the front ranks of the town's merchant &eacute;lite. Certainly he was a man of enormous drive and shrewdness. In 1707 he recounted his success in exporting cloth to Hamburg to a cousin, the diarist and antiquary Ralph Thoresby, who noted:<blockquote>[I] was mightily pleased with some remarkable providences that have attended this worthy magistrate who is of good family &hellip; yet began the world with little, being the youngest son &hellip; [he], with a thankful heart to God recounted to me the various stages of his growth, the first year he had commissions for &pound;5000; the second for &pound;10,000; the third for &pound;15,000; the fourth for &pound;20 or 25,000 pounds; and has now dealt for &pound;80,000 per annum. (<span class="italic">Diary of Ralph Thoresby</span>, 1.429&#150;30)</blockquote>There is an implausibility about this mathematical progression, but there is no doubt that Milner enjoyed more than fifty years of profitable foreign trading in cloth from the West Riding. It was, he maintained in 1736, &#145;such success as few ever had&#146;. Thoresby and the coterie of antiquarians who surrounded him knew Milner as &#145;Alderman Million, the Bashaw of Pannopolis&#146;.<br>
<br>The most tangible evidence of Milner's claim to be one of the most successful provincial merchants of the period 1680&#150;1740 was his purchase for &pound;17,000 in 1707 of the 2800-acre Nun Appleton estate, some 17 miles east of Leeds, from the impoverished Fairfax family. He immediately set about rebuilding the great ramshackle house in which Lord Fairfax and General Monck had planned Charles II's return. In 1716 he gave the property to his son William (created a baronet the following year) on his marriage to a daughter of the archbishop of York, Sir William Dawes.<br>
<br>Milner himself always lived in Simpson's Fold, Leeds, close by the River Aire, and traded to the end. He was mayor of Leeds in 1697&#150;8 and was instrumental in securing an act of parliament (1699) to improve the rivers Aire and Calder, opening up to water carriage the great inland cloth markets of Leeds and Wakefield to Hull. It was perhaps the most notable river navigation improvement of the eighteenth century. Milner was the driving force in the first three decades of its history and largely responsible for raising the capital stock of &pound;26,700 to effect improvement in the difficult first twenty-five years of the venture. It was a superb investment for his family, providing his great-great-grandson with an income of &pound;9494 per annum by 1817.<br>
<br>Milner was also prominent in financial matters. He was deputy receiver of the land tax in Yorkshire, Northumberland, and Durham from 1697 to 1717. By the 1720s he was lending large sums of money to the Irwins of Temple Newsham, who were placed in considerable financial difficulties by the deaths, in quick succession, of the third, fourth, and fifth viscounts. He was a justice of the peace and deputy lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1713, to establish the questionable patriotism of the low-church party in Leeds, he commissioned a white marble statue of Queen Anne (still to be seen in the City Art Gallery), which was erected in front of the town's Moot Hall. A convert to the established church, he was a noted benefactor in Leeds. &#145;What should I render to the Lord for all his benefitts?&#146; asked Milner shortly before his death . His will revealed that he had left &pound;20 per annum to the poor, &pound;10 yearly for repairs to Holy Trinity Church (built in the 1720s), and &pound;20 a year for a clergyman to read prayers each evening in the parish church. Few provincial merchants were more pious or prosperous than Milner; none straddled more easily the worlds of trade and landownership in the early eighteenth century. He died at his home on 23 December 1740, leaving a widow, his son, Sir William Milner, bt, MP for York (1722&#150;34), and four daughters. He was buried in Leeds parish church.<br>
