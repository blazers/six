<div class="para">
<span class="headword">Amory,  Derick Heathcoat</span>, first Viscount Amory  (1899&#150;1981), <span class="occ">industrialist and politician</span>, was born on 26 December 1899 in London, the second son of Sir Ian Murray Heathcoat Heathcoat-Amory, second baronet (1865&#150;1931), and his wife, Alexandra Georgina (<i>d</i>. 1942), daughter of Vice-Admiral Henry George Seymour. Derry, as he was familiarly called, was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he achieved a third in modern history in 1921, and settled down to a business career in the family's textile business in Tiverton, Devon. In the course of the next quarter-century only war service really interrupted his work for John Heathcoat &amp; Co., of which he became managing director, leading by example and&#151;like Stanley Baldwin&#151;placing a high value on traditional working relationships. His early biographer was, however, insistent that whereas Baldwin's Worcestershire inheritance was Anglican and feudal, Amory's in Tiverton was &#145;puritan, radical, nonconformist, squire-less&#146;. The view from within the firm was that &#145;Mr Derry&#146; was &#145;the born executive&#151;slow-moving, tenacious, patient, never deflected by personal considerations from what he held to be the general good&#146;  (Gore Booth, 19, 44). This liberal view of owners' responsibility within modern industry was powerfully reinforced when he made over a large part of his personal capital (and persuaded his wealthier elder brother to do the same) in order to create a trust fund for the benefit of Heathcoats workers.<br>
<br>Amory's sense of duty took him on to the Devon county council for twenty years from 1932, where he chaired the education committee. He was also county commissioner for the Boy Scouts from 1930 to 1945. In the same spirit of support for the young he was later a leading advocate of the Outward Bound Trust, and secretary of the House of Commons' own scout troop. Amory served in the Territorial Army during the 1930s, and during the Second World War he was a staff lieutenant-colonel with the Royal Artillery, seeing action at Salerno. In 1944, responsible for training paratroops for the Arnhem landings, he insisted on taking part along with his trainees, and was injured and taken prisoner during the operation.<br>
<br>In 1945 Amory stepped into the vacancy left by a cousin killed in action to become Conservative MP for Tiverton, his earlier Liberalism now abandoned in admiration for Churchill and an anti-socialism that had been enhanced by Labour's upsurge. He remained, though, an extremely moderate man with little of the fire of party politics in him&#151;the despair of Conservative Party image makers when he became chancellor. When appointed to his party's industrial policy committee in 1946 he moderated the conflicting views of other members, and transmitted to them the consensual, co-partnership approach to industrial relations that he had inherited and fostered at Heathcoats. He was thus an important, if inconspicuous, influence on the <span class="italic">Industrial Charter</span> which the Conservatives published in 1947, a landmark in their recovery from the election defeat in 1945. His moderation even more clearly signalled his support, throughout his parliamentary career, for the abolition of the death penalty, a view shared by few tory leaders of his generation.<br>
<br>Though Amory made only a limited impact within the opposition period of 1945&#150;51, he was appointed to ministerial office as soon as Churchill regained power after the general election of 1951. His promotion was so surprising that he himself is said to have asked whether Churchill had really meant to send for Julian Amery. He served initially as minister of state for pensions (1951&#150;3), where his moderate politics reassured voters fearing that the Conservatives intended to attack the new welfare state. He had already served as a representative of the war-disabled, on the pensions central advisory committee. Then after a short period as minister of state at the Board of Trade (1953&#150;4), he joined the cabinet as minister of agriculture, fisheries, and food on 28 July 1954, after his predecessor Thomas Dugdale had been forced out over the Crichel Down affair.<br>
<br>Churchill needed a reassuring presence at agriculture, preferably someone versed in the priorities of the countryside, and he found this in the member for Tiverton. Amory, with added responsibility for food policy, carried through the final demolition of wartime rationing as economic conditions improved, a policy that did no harm at all to the Conservative Party's chances of re-election in 1955. He also introduced and passed the <span class="roman">Agriculture Act</span> (1957). This completed the long process of disengaging the industry from wartime controls and introducing the price support which remained in place for many years, a remarkable feat which was achieved without alienating either farmers or consumers. Eden kept him at agriculture throughout his premiership (1955&#150;7), as more surprisingly did Macmillan when he succeeded Eden in January 1957. Though one of the cabinet critics of the Suez adventure, Amory loyally accepted the majority view. He was the only one of those whose names were mentioned in the press as Eden's ministerial critics who immediately denied the press reports and pledged his complete support for the prime minister and the invasion.<br>
<br>A year later Macmillan suffered the resignation of his chancellor of the exchequer, Peter Thorneycroft, after the cabinet refused in January 1958 to agree to expenditure cuts deemed necessary to reduce inflation. He turned to Amory to restore business and party confidence in government policy. Macmillan probably also saw Amory as a more biddable chancellor than Thorneycroft had been, and knew that he would not cause him real difficulties as the government proceeded to reflate the economy in advance of the next general election, due in about two years. Amory therefore took over the Treasury on 7 January 1958, only a few weeks before a budget that was bound to be contentious, and with the previous team of Thorneycroft, Nigel Birch, and Enoch Powell tempted to criticize in order to justify their own departures.<br>
<br>It says a good deal for the respect with which Amory was already regarded in the Commons and the financial press that the budget of 1958 was a personal triumph. He did enough to get the economy moving after a period of sluggish growth, but continued to proclaim his adherence to Thorneycroft's war on inflation. As his time at the Treasury went on, however, and under constant expansionist urgings from Macmillan, this hard-won early respect was partially lost, with a steady sequence of moves to free up credit. A second expansionist budget in 1959, cutting both interest and purchase tax when growth was already surging ahead, did something to ensure Conservative re-election in the following October, but reluctance to insist on remedial action when Macmillan still did not want to apply the brakes, either then or in his final budget in 1960, helped to prepare the way for the recession, credit squeeze, and major economic setbacks of 1961&#150;3. It is only fair to add that Amory presided over a period of steady economic growth, low unemployment, and sustained business confidence, and that he shared with Macmillan, as a result of his experiences in Tiverton in the 1930s, an absolute abhorrence of unemployment.<br>
<br>Amory remained at the exchequer until July 1960, having made it clear at the time of the general election in 1959 that he would retire from ministerial office when he was sixty, and to general amazement insisting on actually doing so. This was surprising in part because some Conservative MPs by then saw him as a potential successor to Macmillan, though whether such support would have survived the economic consequences of his Treasury policies during 1961 is far from clear. The premiership was in any event an outcome well beyond the ambitions of Amory himself, who stepped down in 1960 not just from the government but from his Commons seat too, making the break irrevocable.<br>
<br>Amory was made a viscount in September 1960, on his departure from the Commons, and succeeded his brother as fourth baronet in 1972. He devoted the rest of his life mainly to public service, most prominently as chairman of the Medical Research Council (1960&#150;61 and 1965&#150;9) and as British high commissioner in Canada (1961&#150;3). Latterly, his activities centred on Devon, where he became a deputy lieutenant in 1962, his other positions including the chancellorship of the University of Exeter, chairmanship of the Exeter Cathedral appeal, and presidency of the County Councils' Association. He also partially resumed his business career, as a director of ICI and chairman of Heathcoats. He died at his home, the Wooden House, Chevithorne, near Tiverton, on 20 January 1981. Since he was unmarried, the viscountcy became extinct, the baronetcy passing to his brother William (1901&#150;1982).<br>
<br>During a visit to India in 1957, Amory explained to an audience in Bombay:<blockquote>I began as a businessman, and it took me almost twenty years to get over my initial distrust of politicians, whom I had heard defined as people who always looked for trouble and found it, generally made wrong diagnoses and consequently applied wrong remedies.</blockquote>He was a stocky, bespectacled, modest, and earnest-minded man, and the celebration of his career in the naming of a Yorkshire pub as the Jolly Minister (the inn sign depicting him on horseback, as minister of agriculture) was among the most improbable events of the 1950s. Yet he was easily the most prominent of the patient, committed, moderate, and trustworthy men who did so much in office to restore the Conservatives' credibility in the generation after 1945. It was also highly symbolic of those conservative times when, on his appointment as chancellor in 1957, he refused to move into 11 Downing Street, preferring to remain in his tiny bachelor flat in Pimlico. When a journalist suggested that he would have to secure the help of a sister-in-law with official entertaining, he replied in tones of horror, &#145;Good gracious, no. They all have husbands and they are far too busy&#146;  (Gore Booth, 183).<br>
