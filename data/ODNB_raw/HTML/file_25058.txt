<span class="headword">Seller,  John</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1632, <em>d.</em> 1697), <span class="occ">maker of navigational instruments and chart and map seller</span>, was baptized in London at St Katharine by the Tower on 29 December 1632, the son of Henry Seller(s), a cordwainer. Further family circumstance remains untraced, except that an elder sister was baptized at the same church in 1629. Seller was apprenticed to Edward Lowe in 1644 and became a freeman of the Merchant Taylors' Company in 1654. He further became a brother of the Clockmakers' Company in 1667 and served as warden of that company in 1692. His trade was originally that of a compass maker and so he is described, with a note that he also sold navigational instruments, in Timothy Gadbury's <span class="italic">The Young Sea-Mans Guide</span> (1659).<br>
<br>Seller's career was dramatically interrupted by his arrest for high treason in 1662, accused of involvement in a plot led by Thomas Tonge. The trial at the Old Bailey on 11 December 1662 revealed no connection between Seller and the other defendants: he had almost certainly done no more than repeat a rumour about a cache of arms, but this was enough for the jury to convict him. Tonge and others, all of whom admitted some degree of complicity, were executed, but Seller, after imprisonment in Newgate and a succession of petitions, was eventually pardoned. It was perhaps this incident that first brought Seller to the notice of the authorities: if so, it was a notice that was eventually to prove advantageous. The trade in printed maritime atlases and charts had previously been wholly dominated by the Dutch. In terms of national mercantile aspiration this was clearly unsatisfactory&#151;as Seller himself put it in the dedication to <span class="italic">The English Pilot</span> (1671), &#145;we must see no further than their books direct us&#146;&#151;and when he proposed to produce English-printed maritime atlases he was soon given a royal licence, granted a virtual monopoly, and appointed hydrographer to the king in March 1671.<br>
<br>In the event, Seller was forced, whether by financial constraint, by lack of source material, or by the size of the task, to use as the core of his atlases a quantity of disused Dutch printing plates, originally engraved some fifty years earlier and said to have been acquired as scrap metal. These he &#145;refreshed in several places and used them in his pretended new work&#146;  (<span class="italic">Tangier Papers of Samuel Pepys</span>, 107). However that may be, Seller produced what he had promised, with the handsome first volume of <span class="italic">The English Pilot</span> appearing in 1671, dedicated to the duke of York, to whom he had earlier addressed his pleas from prison. Further instalments soon followed and to these were added <span class="italic">The Coasting Pilot</span> (1672) and the <span class="italic">Atlas maritimus</span> (1675). The publications may not have had their anticipated success and when a further volume of <span class="italic">The English Pilot</span>, covering the Mediterranean, was published in 1677 it was with additional partners, two of whom, John Thornton and William Fisher, were soon to take over the whole project.<br>
<br>Seller had meanwhile moved on to another enterprise no less ambitious, a new survey of the whole of England and Wales to be published in the form of a large-scale county atlas, the &#145;Atlas Anglicanus&#146;. In association with John Oliver and the engraver Richard Palmer, Seller published fresh surveys of six counties between 1675 and 1681, as well as Oliver's map of London, but there the project ended. For the remainder of his career, Seller's output concentrated on less financially challenging material, in particular the production of miniature compendia and atlases of the type exemplified by the undated <span class="italic">Atlas minimus</span> and the <span class="italic">Atlas caelestis</span> (1680), the earliest British celestial atlas.<br>
<br>Seller never abandoned his original career as an instrument maker and some idea of the breadth of his activity is given in a lengthy catalogue of instruments preserved in the British Library copy of the <span class="italic">Atlas maritimus</span>  (BL Maps C.8.d.5). In 1672 he successfully petitioned for a contract to supply the Chatham Dockyard with compasses and glasses. Aside from this practical work, to which must be added the occasional production of manuscript charts, Seller also taught on navigation, mathematics, surveying, gunnery, and fortification. He appears as a correspondent on the topic of magnetic variation in the <span class="italic">Philosophical Transactions</span> of the Royal Society in 1667. He wrote several textbooks, including the popular <span class="italic">Practical Navigation</span> (1669), outlining the mathematical basis of navigation through worked examples. Within the limits of contemporary practice his description of the various instruments and their use at sea is of exemplary clarity. He was further responsible for a large number of nautical almanacs, many relating to American waters. His other works include the very early set of London views, <span class="italic">A Prospect of London</span> (<i>c</i>.1680).<br>
<br>Seller operated throughout his documented career from premises at the Hermitage Stairs in Wapping, but for a number of years maintained additional retail premises in and about the Royal Exchange. Little is recorded of his private life. He is perhaps the John Seller granted licences for various Baptist meeting-houses in Kent in 1672, an identification made more likely by his connections with Chatham as well as his long professional association with the elder John Darby, a printer of known nonconformist affiliations. A court case over poor relief disbursed by Seller and not refunded reveals him to have been chapel-warden of Wapping Hamlet in 1688.<br>
<br>Seller has long had his detractors: his contemporary Robert Morden referred to him as an &#145;upstart Hydrographer who never did, nor ever knew how to project or draw a map or sea-chart&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Introduction to Astronomy</span>, 1702, pt 2, 32). Pepys, on the other hand, while aware of his limitations, still made use of Seller and understood the strategic importance of his activities: &#145;till Seller fell into it we had very few draughts, even of our own coasts, printed in England&#146;  (Pepys, <span class="italic">Naval Minutes</span>, 238). The extent to which he relied on earlier Dutch work has often been overstated and, by the only means perhaps available, he was successful in establishing a trade in London-printed charts, a trade further developed by Thornton and Fisher. It has perhaps been too little appreciated that he was also, by a line of descent through his apprentice Charles Price (1679?&#150;1733), the founding figure of the school of map makers who came to dominate eighteenth-century British cartography, a group that included John Senex, Emanuel Bowen, Thomas Kitchin, and Thomas Jefferys. Judgement of Seller has likewise been prejudiced by the low survival rate of his work: not a single example of a large wall-map of the world is known to survive. Perhaps the best epitaph is the anagram of his name sometimes appended to his works, &#145;John Seller: Here's no ill&#146;.<br>
<br>Seller and his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 1711), baptized daughters Elizabeth (1655), Thomasin (1656), and Priscilla (1659). Their sons John and Jeremiah, apprenticed to Seller in 1681 and 1687 respectively, both briefly followed their father's career. Seller died of dropsy between 19 and 31 May 1697 and was buried at the church of St John-at-Wapping that month. His will noted an earlier advance of &pound;500 to John junior and left the remainder of his estate, including his stock, to his widow and to Jeremiah, who subsequently formed a partnership with Charles Price.<br>
