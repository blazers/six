<span class="headword">Griffith,  Stewart Cathie</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Billy Griffith]</span>  (1914&#150;1993), <span class="occ">cricketer and cricket administrator</span>, was born on 16 June 1914 at 51 Balham Park Road, Wandsworth, London, the elder son and elder child of Henry Leonard Adams Griffith, stockbroker, and his wife, Jean, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Cathie. A man of considerable charm, Billy Griffith (as he was always known) became one of the best-liked and most scrupulous figures in the cricket world. At Dulwich College he was head of the school and excelled at sport, being four years in the cricket eleven, as a batsman who took to wicket-keeping, and four years in the rugby fifteen, as a rumbustious centre three-quarter. In the early 1930s he and his contemporary and lifelong friend, Hugh (H. T.) Bartlett, a brilliant schoolboy cricketer, brought Dulwich outstanding success on the games field. After gaining a Cambridge cricket blue in 1935, his second year at Pembroke College, Griffith was chosen to tour Australasia in the winter of 1935&#150;6 with a side sent out by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to try and heal the wounds inflicted during the bodyline tour three years earlier.<br>
<br>Between going down from Cambridge and the outbreak of the Second World War, Griffith went back to teach at Dulwich. On 1 April 1939 he married Barbara Ethel Reynolds (<i>b</i>. 1915/16), daughter of Robert John Reynolds, a hotelier, and his wife, Ethel. They had a son, Mike, and a daughter, Pauline. Mike was named after one of his godfather P. G. Wodehouse's characters, Wodehouse having been a friend of Griffith's from Dulwich days. Griffith might well have abandoned his schoolmastering career whether or not the war had come. He kept wicket well enough for Sussex after the end of the school summer term of 1939 to be offered the job on a regular basis and to be selected to go with the MCC to India in 1939&#150;40, a tour which was cancelled with the onset of war. Griffith found himself going instead to Normandy and then to Nijmegen as a pilot in the glider pilot regiment. Thickset, resolute, and seldom without a pipe in his mouth, he rose to the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. As commander of his wing, he piloted the commander of the 6th airborne division, General Sir Richard Gale, to the Normandy landing, for which he won the DFC. He was able to keep his hand in with some wartime cricket and duly signed up with Sussex when the war ended, combining the secretaryship of the county with keeping wicket for them. This he did until 1949.<br>
<br>The highlight of Griffith's playing career came in the first test match against the West Indies at Port of Spain, Trinidad, in January 1948, when, with England beset by injuries, he was pressed into service as an opening batsman. In his unaccustomed role, Griffith scored a heroic 140, thereby becoming one of only a handful of cricketers whose maiden first-class century has been in a test match. He played two more test matches, both against South Africa in South Africa, when, as a wicket-keeper, he was preferred to the great Godfrey Evans. Leaving Sussex in 1950, Griffith had two years writing about cricket and rugby football for the <span class="italic">Sunday Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Sporting Record</span> before joining the secretariat of the MCC at Lord's, where he stayed until his retirement in 1974.<br>
<br>Griffith's first ten years at the MCC, as assistant to Ronny Aird, were relatively uneventful, unlike his last twelve, when he was in full charge, and English cricket, still largely controlled by the MCC, was under pressure both financially and politically. Griffith was of a conservative bent. &#145;For most Britishers&#146; he once said, &#145;cricket has a unique image, quite different from any other sport &hellip; Nothing must be done to damage that&#146;  (private information). It was not so much that he was against change as that he was wary of it. He had the greatest affection for Lord's and all that it stood for. However, in 1963 he was obliged to supervise the abolition of the distinction between amateurs and professionals, as well as the introduction of one-day cricket played by the first-class counties. He made time to manage the MCC side to Australia and New Zealand in 1965&#150;6, but was back in the thick of things at Lord's when, to enable the game in England to benefit from Sports Council funds, unavailable to a private club, the MCC relinquished its long-standing authority by establishing the Cricket Council and its subsidiary bodies, the Test and County Cricket Board (later the England and Wales Cricket Board) and the National Cricket Association.<br>
<br>Next came the D'Oliveira affair, with its far-flung repercussions. This arose as a result of the MCC's first leaving Basil D'Oliveira, a &#145;Cape coloured&#146; who had emigrated from Cape Town, out of their side to tour South Africa in 1968&#150;9, and then bringing him in when injury forced T. W. Cartwright, an original selection, to withdraw. Having been privy to earlier informal discussions that had taken place in South Africa between B. J. Vorster, South Africa's prime minister, and Viscount Cobham, a former president of the MCC, in which Vorster strongly implied that if D'Oliveira were chosen there would be no tour, Griffith was in a cleft stick. In the event, he gave nothing away; Vorster made good his threat and the tour was abandoned. Griffith, who was known to favour the retention of sporting links with South Africa, offered to resign, and, although that was never seriously entertained, the club found themselves fighting off a vote of no confidence in their handling of the matter at a special general meeting at Church House, Westminster. So it came as something of a relief to Griffith when, at the age of sixty, he could retire honourably.<br>
<br>Inflexible in his beliefs, sometimes disadvantageously so, Griffith was yet eminently companionable, and had a host of friends and a delightful sense of humour. To an unhappy extent his retirement was marred by ill health. He was appointed CBE in 1975 for services to cricket and stayed well long enough to be president of Sussex from 1975 to 1977 and of the MCC in 1979&#150;80, and to recodify the laws of cricket in 1980; but complications following an operation for bowel cancer left him so heavily immobile that his last five years were spent in a nursing home, Hollymead House, Downview Road, Felpham, Sussex near the home at Middleton-on-Sea where he had lived since soon after the war. He died there, on 7 April 1993, of bronchopneumonia. He was survived by his wife, Barbara, his son, Mike (who captained Sussex from 1969 to 1972), and daughter, Pauline.<br>
