<span class="headword">Bolton,  Arthur Thomas</span>  (1864&#150;1945), <span class="occ">architect and architectural historian</span>, was born on 14 April 1864 at 37 Westbourne Park, Bayswater, London, the second son in a family of five sons and three daughters of Thomas Bolton (1819&#150;1895), solicitor, and his wife, Emily Wildman (1831&#150;1906), of Chilham Castle, Kent. He was educated at Dr Huntingford's Preparatory School, Wimbledon, and Haileybury College, before entering University College, London, in 1882. In 1884 he was articled for three years to the architect Robert Edis. He studied at the Architectural Association from 1885 to 1888 and from 1888 to 1889 acted as clerk of works to Ewan Christian before setting up his own architectural practice in 1890. He was elected an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1888 and a fellow in 1909. In 1893 Bolton won the Soane medallion for his &#145;Design for a railway terminus&#146;, and in 1895, having become increasingly interested in the history of architecture, he won the RIBA's silver medal for an essay, &#145;The influence of literature on architecture&#146;.<br>
<br>On 26 January 1897 Bolton married, in London, Harriet Barnes (1863&#150;1944), daughter of Samuel Fall of Carolina. They had three sons and two daughters. In 1901 Bolton was appointed first headmaster of the new day school at the Architectural Association. His first major commission was a factory and offices in Limehouse for the Sanitas Company (1900). He built for himself a house, Larkscliff, on the cliffs at Birchington, Kent (1906). His most important commission was to complete the offices for the Hamburg-Amerika Linie in Cockspur Street, London (1906&#150;8). Subsequently Bolton built a house in the country for a wealthy barrister (Hurtwood in Sussex) and another in the Usk valley (Colomendy), where he also displayed a talent for garden design (1912&#150;14). However, most of the work he was doing at this time was of a minor nature.<br>
<br>Having moved his family back to London in 1913, Bolton was in 1917 appointed curator of Sir John Soane's Museum in succession to Walter L. Spiers. He remained in this post until his death. He opened up the museum to scholars and architectural historians by writing many articles on Soane and his collections for the architectural press in the 1920s and also embarked on a series of publications about Soane: <span class="italic">The Works of Sir John Soane</span> (1924), an edition of Soane's Royal Academy <span class="italic">Lectures on Architecture</span> (1929), and <span class="italic">The Portrait of Sir John Soane</span> (1927), as well as a number of pamphlets. During the 1920s he campaigned tirelessly to stop the destruction of Soane's Bank of England by Sir Herbert Baker. Besides his work on Soane, Bolton became a great authority on the Adam brothers and wrote a two-volume work, <span class="italic">The Architecture of Robert and James Adam</span> (1922), still regarded as a major source of reference on the subject. This led to work at several Adam buildings and to an invitation from Sir Lawrence Weaver to design an Adam room for the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1925.<br>
<br>Bolton was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1914 and served on the council of the London Topographical Society (1918&#150;27). From 1923 until his death he was joint editor with H. Duncan Hendry of the Wren Society volumes, which aimed to publish all the drawings, documents, and facts relating to Wren's life and works; the twentieth and final volume was published a few days before Bolton's death in January 1945. In the 1930s he carried out extensive research on the work of Sir Charles Barry and was working on a study of Barry's diaries at the time of his death. Bolton enjoyed only modest success as an architect, although he was greatly respected; but as a scholar he excelled. He died of a heart attack in London on 17 January 1945, having collapsed on the platform of Queensway tube station on his way to a meeting of the trustees of Sir John Soane's Museum.<br>
