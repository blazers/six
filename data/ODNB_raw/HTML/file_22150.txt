<span class="headword">Phillips,  George</span>  (<em>fl. </em>1579&#150;1600), <span class="occ">preacher</span>, is of unknown parentage. He matriculated as a pensioner of Trinity College, Cambridge, on 2 December 1579 and graduated BA in 1583 and MA in 1587. The only other information about his life comes from his published works, which demonstrate him to have been a moderate puritan evangelist whose main concerns lay in the field of social ethics not (after the defeat of presbyterianism in the 1580s) in striving to alter the government of the church by bishops. He published six works, beginning with <span class="italic">Five Godly and Learned Sermons</span> (1594) which, among other things, encouraged the soldiers of Christ to sing psalms and condemned the sin of usury. His <span class="italic">God's Generall Summons to his Last Parliament</span> (1595) emphasized the need for the committed Christian to examine the deeds of his life for signs of grace with the hope that, on Judgment day, he be accounted among the godly not the ungodly who &#145;shall appeare but as Satan amongst the sons of God (that is) in the companie, but not of the companie of Gods electe&#146;  (sig. B4<i>v</i>). The same year he published his <span class="italic">Paines of a Faithfull Pastor</span>; the reissue of this in 1597 as <span class="italic">The Good Sheepeheardes Dutie</span> has sometimes been mistaken for a separate work. Both were dedicated to Thomas Aldersey, a member of London's common council and sometime MP for the city and patron of puritan ministers, which suggests that Phillips was resident in London at this time and eager to obtain backing. He lauded the pastoral calling&#151;including its highest expression, the bishop&#151;as higher than all others. Preachers were &#145;Gods Lieftenants upon earth in spirituall affaires&#146;  (unfoliated) because of their crucial role in delivering the scriptural message on the divinely ordained sabbath. That a proportion of clergymen neglected to preach the word was evidence of a grievance to be corrected, but the main enemies were the papists and their antichristian leader, the pope, who maintained devotion by enforcing ignorance.<br>
<br>In <span class="italic">The Embassage of Gods Angell</span> (1597) Phillips described again the ministry's vital role in dispersing the ignorance of popery by preaching the word and evoked the notion of the godly commonwealth where true religion, not social pre-eminence, was the only qualification for high civil and ecclesiastical (including episcopal) office. His final publication came in 1600 with <span class="italic">The Life and Death of the Rich Man and Lazarus</span> in which he addressed the problems arising from inequality. The wealthy should avoid the sins of prideful display, covetousness, and usury and bestow their money compassionately to relieve the (deserving) poor: &#145;the greatest of you shall come from his Downe bed to his dust bed at the last&#146;  (sig. D3<i>r</i>). The poor were to avoid the sins of idleness and scrounging. Nothing more is known of the remainder of his life but it is clear that this sermon was preached in the city of London where, perhaps, Phillips was still resident.<br>
