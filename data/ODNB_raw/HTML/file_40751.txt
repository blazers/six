<span class="headword">Myers,  Arthur Thomas</span>  (1851&#150;1894), <span class="occ">physician</span>, was born on 16 April 1851 at St John's parsonage, Keswick, Cumberland. He was the third and youngest child of the <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19688/', "Revd Frederic Myers (1811&#150;1851)")</script>, perpetual curate of St John's, Keswick, and his wife, Susan Harriet, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Marshall (1811&#150;1896). In July 1851 his father died, and his mother, who came from a wealthy family, moved with her three sons first to Blackheath and then to Cheltenham, where all three were sent as day boys to Cheltenham College. Arthur was a good all-rounder, who played cricket and rackets for the school. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1869, became a scholar of the college in 1872, and in 1873 obtained a first class in the classical tripos and a second class in the natural sciences tripos. He also won the Winchester reading prize. He was captain of the college cricket eleven, and gained a half blue at real tennis. After graduating Myers turned to medicine, studying at Cambridge and at St George's Hospital, London. He obtained his LSA in 1879, a Cambridge MD in 1881, and his MRCP in 1882. He settled in London, becoming house physician and medical registrar at St George's and physician to the Belgrave Hospital for Children. He also practised privately, and he published several rather routine medical papers.<br>
<br>Myers's interests lay particularly in mental disorders and their treatment by hypnotism. Hypnotism, little known in Britain, was attracting considerable attention in France. In and after 1881 he paid a number of visits to Charcot, Bernheim, and other leading French authorities, with many of whom he established friendly personal relations. His own publications on the subject, though neither numerous nor lengthy, are moderate in judgement and exceptionally well informed. No British medical man knew more about contemporary European hypnotism, or about the history of mesmerism and hypnotism; he wrote the article on James Esdaile for the <span class="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</span>.<br>
<br>Related to his interest in hypnotism was his involvement in the Society for Psychical Research (founded in 1882), of which his eldest brother, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/35177/', "Frederic William Henry Myers")</script>, to whom he was very close, was a leading member. A well-established tradition held that the hypnotic, or mesmeric state is especially conducive to telepathy and clairvoyance, and Arthur Myers was involved as participant or adviser in various of the society's early hypnotic experiments. His activities were mocked, though not unkindly, in J. K. Stephen's poem &#145;To A.T.M.&#146;, a clever parody of Frederic Myers's <span class="italic">St Paul</span>. He was also often consulted on the psychopathological issues which can arise in psychical investigations. On behalf of the society he and his brother assembled an outstanding collection, still extant, of rare books, periodicals, and pamphlets on mesmerism and hypnosis.<br>
<br>Myers's hypnotic studies and his interests in psychical research came fruitfully together in a long, thoughtful, and frequently cited paper, &#145;Mind-cure, faith-cure, and the miracles of Lourdes&#146;, which he and Frederic published in the <span class="italic">Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research</span> in 1893. The paper discussed the kind of evidence that reports of allegedly miraculous cures ought to offer, presented a selection of the most striking and better attested cures, and showed that very similar cures had been obtained without any hint of the miraculous. In the great majority of the &#145;miraculous&#146; cases there was inadequate testimony or the likelihood of misdiagnosis, sometimes combined with a strong element of suggestion.<br>
<br>Various photographs of Arthur Myers survive, but no description of him. Although a bachelor, he was a kindly and sociable if occasionally brusque individual, an enthusiastic cricket and tennis player, and a keen walker, skater, and climber. His many friends included several of his most eminent contemporaries. His undoubted abilities as a physician (he became an FRCP in 1893) could have led to a distinguished medical career. But, despite valiant endeavours to remain cheerful and positive, his life was increasingly overshadowed by a then hopeless malady. His first slight attacks of what was diagnosed as <i>petit mal</i> epilepsy took place in 1871. At first they amounted to no more than a brief but overwhelming absorption &#145;in a vivid and unexpected recollection&#146;. He also had a few <i>grand mal</i> attacks. However it was the so-called <i>petit mal</i> which gradually disabled him. It steadily progressed into more frequent episodes of what would now be termed psychomotor epilepsy, involving superficially intelligent but really disordered sequences of actions for which he had afterwards no recollection. On rare occasions these seem to have resulted in anti-social behaviour. He gave up medical practice in October 1893. In 1877 and subsequently he consulted J. Hughlings Jackson, the celebrated neurologist. Jackson published two papers (Jackson, 1889; Jackson and Colman, 1898) largely about Myers's case. He made extensive use of Myers's own notes. These papers are still regarded as milestones in the development of modern ideas about temporal lobe epilepsy.<br>
<br>On the morning of Tuesday, 9 January 1894 Myers was found at his London home, 2 Manchester Square, in a coma apparently induced by some narcotic medicine. He died the following day, and was cremated at Woking five days later. At the inquest the possibility of suicide was clearly in the air. But testimony was heard that he had been in unusually good spirits on the Monday afternoon and evening; he was known to have regularly taken narcotics, and there was no suggestion of financial worries (his estate was later valued at &pound;28,056). His death was attributed to asphyxia during epileptic coma, accelerated by a dose of narcotic medicine while suffering from incipient Bright's disease. Hughlings Jackson (who chanced to be Myers's neighbour) assisted at the post-mortem, seeking the temporal lobe lesion which he anticipated. He was rewarded by the discovery of a very small cavity in the left mesial temporal lobe&#151;a tiny thing (if indeed it underlay Myers's epilepsy) to have ruined the career of a sensitive, brave, and intelligent man.<br>
