<span class="headword">Stevenson,  Matthew</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1684), <span class="occ">poet</span>, was probably of Yorkshire origin, but for most of his life he lived in Norfolk. He was occasionally seen in London, a member of a circle of cavalier wits who haunted the lawcourts in the years following the Restoration. The coterie was dominated by such faint luminaries as Henry Bold, Valentine Oldys, Alexander Brome, and Edward Baynard. Stevenson's first publication was <span class="italic">Occasion's Offspring, or, Poems upon Severall Occasions</span> (1654), dedicated to his friend and cousin Benjamin Cook. The work is preceded by a portrait of the author by R. Gaywood. His next work was a compendium of oral tradition and folklore entitled <span class="italic">The twelve moneths, or, A pleasant and profitable discourse of every action, whether of labour or recreation, proper to each particular moneth</span> (1661). The occupations of each month are illustrated by a woodcut. Also in 1661 he published <span class="italic">Bellum presbyteriale, or, As much said for the presbyter as may be, together with their covenants catastrophe, held forth in an heroick poem</span>. The catastrophe in question is the burning of the covenant by the common hangman on 22 May 1661 and the consequent confusion of the Presbyterians, at which the author rejoices. A year later he published <span class="italic">Florus Britannicus, or, An exact epitome of the history of England from William the Conqueror to the twelfth year of the reign of his sacred majesty Charls the Second now flourishing</span> (1662), which is very rare in a perfect condition. The dedicatory epistle to his cousin Mrs Grace Killingbeck of Baroughby Grange, near Wetherby in Yorkshire, was written from his study in Fleet Street on 12 March 1661. He &#145;had the happinesse for some years, not long since, (through your more than generous goodnesse) to call your house, My Home&#146;  (sig. A2). The letterpress, amounting to a page and a half for each monarch, was evidently written to accompany the plates, which are by Renold Elstracke. In 1665 he published his <span class="italic">Poems</span>, inscribed to Edward Somerset, marquess of Worcester, on whose &#145;Inimitable, Water-Commanding Engine&#146; there is an elaborate panegyric  (1&#150;3). Stevenson's last volume of verse was <span class="italic">Norfolk drollery, or, A compleat collection of the newest songs, jovial poems, and catches, &amp;c.</span> (1673), reissued as <span class="italic">Poems</span> in 1673 and <span class="italic">The Wits</span> in 1685. Many of these poems had been composed under the roof of Mary Hunt, of Sharington Hall to whom the book is jointly dedicated with Thomas Brown of Elsing Hall. A number of the verses had appeared before and, although the author celebrates the East Anglian labourer's practice of demanding largess from field-farers, there is little in the volume that is distinctive of Norfolk. Stevenson was buried at St Mary-in-the-Marsh, Norwich, on 20 March 1684.<br>
