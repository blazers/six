<span class="headword">Brooke,  Henry William</span>  (1771/2&#150;1842), <span class="occ">civil servant</span>, attended none of the leading schools, nor did he go to university, and his origins and much of his career are shrouded in mystery. For several years he drew a salary as distributor of stamps in Ireland, but it seems unlikely that he was one of the Irish Brookes. He was probably from Kent; at any rate he owned property in Deal and Walmer, and was married at Davington, Kent, on 2 March 1799 to Catherine (1769/70&#150;1825), daughter of the Revd John Tucker, rector of Ringwould, near Walmer. A letter of 1809 refers to their five children.<br>
<br>Brooke's claim to noteworthiness rests on his role in the alien office. Established in 1793 by the <span class="roman">Alien Act</span> of that year, the alien office was a branch of the Home Office which ostensibly acted as the administrative centre for the regulation of the conduct of foreigners resident in Britain. In reality, it co-ordinated counter-revolutionary efforts against &#145;disaffected&#146; Britons as well as suspect foreigners.<br>
<br>The secretiveness of the alien office's work makes it difficult to provide details of Brooke's activities: &#145;My duties have ever been of the most confidential nature&#146;, he wrote to R. B. Jenkinson, second earl of Liverpool, in 1809. Brooke appears to have joined the alien office about 1796, and he was clerk from about 1798 to 1813. He served briefly (1802&#150;3) as acting superintendent, bridging the gap between the departure of Charles Flint and the appointment of John Reeves. Brooke was employed in Manchester, and then in Ireland at the time of the rebellion. After his return to England, he was involved in the interrogation of Fran&ccedil;ois Barth&eacute;lemy, the former French charg&eacute; d'affaires in Britain, who fled from France in 1799. Two years later, Brooke was given responsibility for the Kent coast from Dover to Whitstable, with the task of preventing any communication between the French and their English sympathizers. To Lord Liverpool he hinted subsequently at the difficulties in &#145;serving the ends of Government in such a situation of delicacy with limited Legal powers&#146;.<br>
<br>Ill health obliged Brooke to retire in 1813. His salary at this time was &pound;1000, and upon leaving the service he received a pension of &pound;600 p.a. He devoted his remaining years to Kentish affairs: he was an active local magistrate; he promoted a loyal address to the king from the inhabitants of Walmer in December 1820; and in 1826 he was one of the main subscribers to the enlargement of Walmer church. Brooke died at Walmer on 15 April 1842, aged seventy.<br>
