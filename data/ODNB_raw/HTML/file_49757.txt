<span class="headword">Graham,  Angus Charles</span>  (1919&#150;1991), <span class="occ">Sinologist and philosopher</span>, was born on 8 July 1919 at 31 Clive Place, Penarth, Glamorgan, the elder of two sons of Charles Harold Graham (1893&#150;1928) and his wife, Mabelle, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Booker. At the time of his birth, his father was a coal exporter, but in 1925 he moved to Malaya to work as a rubber planter; he died of malaria three years later. From 1932 to 1937 Graham attended Ellesmere College in Shropshire, and in 1937 he went to Oxford University to read theology at Corpus Christi College, graduating with a second-class degree in 1940. He then joined the Royal Air Force for his compulsory wartime service and in 1944 he was put on a Japanese language course at London University; he served as a Japanese interpreter in Malaya and Thailand until he was released from the air force in 1945 with the rank of flying officer.<br>
<br>Graham had lost his religious faith a few months after leaving Oxford and in any case had never intended to enter the church. In 1946 he enrolled at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at London University for a three-year course in Chinese, graduating with first-class honours in 1949, followed by a PhD in 1953. It was not modern Chinese but the Chinese classical language and the classical texts which profoundly interested him and which he continued to study for the rest of his life. In 1950 he was appointed a lecturer at SOAS and in 1971 professor of classical Chinese; he remained in that post until his retirement in 1984. During those years and in retirement he also held a number of visiting fellowships and professorships both in America and the Far East, which took him abroad for parts of the year. On 23 January 1956 he married Der Pao Chang (<i>b</i>. 1932/3), daughter of Yuan-po Chang, general merchant; their daughter, Dawn, was born in 1964.<br>
<br>Graham regarded the two greatest periods in the history of Chinese thought as being the last years of the Zhou dynasty, 500&#150;200 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, and the period of the Song dynasty, <span class="smallcap">AD</span> 960&#150;1279. For the subject of his PhD, which he expanded and published as his first book in 1958, he chose two Chinese philosophers of the eleventh century, the Cheng brothers, who questioned orthodox Confucianism and whose ideas influenced the leaders of neo-Confucianism. He then turned to the earlier period, when the loss of power of the Zhou kings had led to a breakdown of the traditional feudal system. The sage-kings of old had claimed the authority of heaven, whose Dao, or &#145;way&#146;, they confidently followed, but now every school of thought proposed its own way, and Graham decided to study &#145;the variety of modes of thinking inside the tradition&#146;  (Graham, 4). In 1960 he published a new and for the first time complete translation of the <span class="italic">Book of Liezi</span> (<span class="roman">Lieh Tz&#365;</span>), drawing attention to the Daoist concept of &#145;spontaneity&#146;, the importance of responding to circumstances without prior thought, spontaneously following the way. He also worked for many years on the text of the anti-rationalist Zhuangzi (Chuang-tz&#365;); he disentangled and then reunited the different strands of philosophical ideas by comparing the grammatical structure of the passages, and when he had completed the textual revision he re-translated the whole work and published it in 1981.<br>
<br>Graham's interest in the structure and use of the classical Chinese language was always an important part of his studies: he believed that an understanding of the language was the way to gain access to the meaning of a text. He was especially respected for his work on the rationalist Mozi (Mo-Tz&#365;), the logical and scientific chapters of whose text had for 2000 years been known to be incorrect because the manuscript had been damaged and the bamboo strips left in the wrong order. By patient study and devotion to the task Graham succeeded in revealing the correct text, which he then translated and analysed for its scientific value and published in 1978, with the title of <span class="italic">Later Mohist Logic, Ethics and Science</span>.<br>
<br>Poetry was a further interest and Graham reached a wide audience with his <span class="italic">Poems of the Late T'ang</span>, first published in 1965 and continually in demand since then; he felt that the increasing complexity of language in the seventh and eighth centuries made the poets of that period the most interesting of all Chinese poets and that late-Tang poetry &#145;explores the Chinese language to the limit of its resources&#146;  (<span class="italic">Poems of the Late T'ang</span>, 22).<br>
<br>In 1989 Graham published his most acclaimed and popular book, <span class="italic">Disputers of the Tao</span> [Dao], a general history of philosophy in China during the classical age, 500&#150;200 <span class="smallcap">BC</span>, providing a wealth of information about the wide variety of philosophers and schools of thought of that period. In a book of essays written to celebrate his seventieth birthday, <span class="italic">Chinese Texts and Philosophical contexts</span> (1991), Graham himself was invited to contribute by writing a commentary on each essay: this he was glad to do, showing not only his continuing lively interest in the discussion but also the warmth of feeling between him and his former students. He was widely respected as the leading Western authority on classical Chinese when he died of cancer in the City Hospital, Nottingham, on 26 March 1991. He was survived by his wife, Der Pao, and their daughter, Dawn.<br>
