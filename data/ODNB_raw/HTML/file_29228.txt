<span class="headword">Whitaker,  William</span>  (1547/8&#150;1595), <span class="occ">theologian and college head</span>, was possibly born in the first year of Edward VI's reign. He was the third son of Thomas Whitaker of Holme, near Burnley, Lancashire, the head of a gentry family established there since the fourteenth century. Thomas had in 1530 or possibly 1531 married Elizabeth, daughter of John Nowell from Read, 10 miles away; William was consequently nephew to three distinguished brothers: <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20378/', "Alexander Nowell (c.1516/17&#150;1602)")</script>, dean of St Paul's, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/20380/', "Laurence Nowell (c.1516&#150;1576)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/69731/', "Nowell, Laurence (1530&#150;c.1570)")</script>], dean of Lichfield, and Robert Nowell, attorney of the court of wards. <h2>
<a name="Educationandearlycareer"></a>Education and early career</h2>Whitaker first attended a private school at Burnley run by William Hatgrave. At the age of twelve or thirteen he was extracted from Lancashire and the Catholic sympathies of his parents by Alexander Nowell, who entered him at St Paul's School, London, then under the high mastership of John Cook. On 4 October 1564 Whitaker was admitted pensioner of Trinity College, Cambridge, where his tutor was Robert West. In 1565 he was admitted scholar. Nowell continued to support his education with a reversionary lease of a St Paul's Cathedral property (5 August 1566). He graduated BA in March 1568. In 1569 he published <span class="italic">Liber precum publicarum</span>, a Latin rendering of the daily offices, collects, and other matter from the <span class="roman">Book of Common Prayer</span>; this he dedicated to Alexander Nowell (23 May). On 6 September that year he became a minor fellow of Trinity. On 25 March 1571 he was advanced to a major fellowship, and five days later he proceeded MA. In this year he published some Greek verses appended to Nicholas Carr's <span class="italic">Demosthenis Olynthic&aelig; orationes tres &amp; Philippic&aelig; quatuor</span>. In 1573 he provided the Greek version of Nowell's larger catechism, issued with the Latin original. He did likewise for the shorter (1574) and &#145;middle&#146; (1575) polyglot versions. His work was dedicated to Sir William Cecil with whom the Nowells had long connections, and whom he was evidently now cultivating. His talents had already been recognized by the master of Trinity, John Whitgift. While still a junior figure, he had the assurance to advise Whitgift against responding to Thomas Cartwright's <span class="italic">Second replye</span> (1575), which he derided as &#145;loose &hellip; childish &hellip; unworthy to be refuted by any man of learning&#146;  (Paule, 15). <h2>
<a name="Timeofhope"></a>Time of hope</h2>On 31 July 1576 Whitaker was presented by the crown to the rectory of St Florence, Pembrokeshire; the appointment seems not to have taken effect, since another presentation was made to the same vacancy in the following year, but on 21 December he was ordained deacon and priest in London. On 25 October 1577 the queen presented him to a canonry of Norwich Cathedral, where he was installed by proxy on 23 February 1578. Shortly afterwards he gave his first university sermon by way of supplicating BTh, as which he was admitted on 14 June. On 14 July he incorporated his degree at Oxford. On 27 September 1578 Nowell had asked William Cecil, Lord Burghley, to obtain for his nephew the living of Withington, Gloucestershire, should John Bullingham be made bishop of Chester, none of which happened. On 3 November there appeared the first of Whitaker's anti-Catholic works, a translation of John Jewel's book against Thomas Harding which he dedicated to archbishops Edmund Grindal and Edwin Sandys, bishops John Aylmer, John Whitgift, and Edmund Freake, and Nowell&#151;a stupendous feat of self-promotion which his disclaimer merely highlighted, but which served its purpose. The elevation of William Chaderton, regius professor of divinity at Cambridge, to the bishopric of Chester was Whitaker's opening. The chair was first offered to and declined by William Fulke; by 4 October 1579 Whitaker was regarded in Cambridge as the only remaining candidate, and he was appointed in the following year. He at once found himself at odds with the Lady Margaret professor, Peter Baro, whose lectures on the book of <span class="roman">Jonah</span> had questioned the Calvinist orthodoxy on salvation and election to which Whitaker resolutely adhered. This debate dominated Cambridge theology for fifteen years, and intermittently erupted on to the wider world. On 23 September 1580 Whitaker became chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral by royal grant, though obviously on the recommendation of Dean Nowell. In 1581 Whitaker brought out <span class="italic">Ad rationes decem Edmundi Campiani jesuit&aelig; responsio</span>. By thus taking on the most gifted of the English Catholic missioners, he built up his reputation as &#145;David &hellip; against the popish Goliath&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Answere to &hellip; Downame</span>, 19). The mass of anti-Catholic propaganda which he published ensured him a respected place within the church which may (as in the case of John Reynolds at Oxford) have amounted to a kind of protected status. While adhering firmly to the establishment, he had a continuing sympathy with those protestants who were uncomfortable within it. In the summer of 1583, following the death of Grindal, he feared for puritan ministers under the next r&eacute;gime at Lambeth, and was among those who urged that only those of the <span class="roman">Thirty-Nine Articles</span> which concerned doctrine should be enforced by subscription. He joined the puritans who encouraged Cartwright to respond to the Rheims translation of the <span class="roman">Bible</span>. Whitaker himself published <span class="italic">Ad Nicolai Sanderi &hellip; responsio</span> in that year. The appointment of Whitgift to Canterbury (August 1583) cannot have entirely gladdened him, though it meant his friends were now in the highest places. He continued to court Burghley's patronage, and submitted to him his answers to Campion's <span class="italic">Qu&aelig;stiones</span>. In 1585 he dedicated to him <span class="italic">An Aunswere to &hellip; W. Rainoldes</span>. <br>
<br>By this time Whitaker had acquired another wide and interrelated set of connections in the city of London, in colonial investment, and in religious radicalism. Perhaps early in 1580 he married Susan, widow of Cuthbert Fuller, a London merchant who died late in 1579, and daughter of the haberdasher <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/62232/', "Nicholas Culverwell (d. 1569)")</script> [<i>see under </i><script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/70079/', "Culverwell family")</script>]. The couple had three daughters, Susan, Elizabeth, and Mary (all named in the 1589 will of their grandmother Elizabeth Culverwell), and two sons, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/71159/', "Alexander Whitaker (1585&#150;1617)")</script> and Samuel (1587&#150;1617). Susan Whitaker predeceased her mother, Mistress Culverwell, but a notable family connection persisted. Susan's sister Cecilia had married in 1577 or 1578 Laurence Chaderton, who became in 1584 the founding master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. For a time Whitaker and Chaderton had set up house together; they remained closer friends than Whitaker sometimes cared to admit as he advanced his career. <h2>
<a name="Thenewmaster"></a>The new master</h2>In 1585 Whitaker was being run by Burghley and Whitgift as a candidate for the mastership of St John's College, Cambridge (Burghley's old college), which should have been vacated by Richard Howland's consecration to the see of Peterborough that February. However, most of the fellows were against Whitaker's appointment; some objected simply because he was an outsider, but there were also suspicions of his in-laws and other puritan connections. It was rumoured that Whitaker had withdrawn an application to supplicate DTh before reaching the statutory age because he had developed puritan qualms about taking the title &#145;doctor&#146;. Less than a quarter of the fellows openly supported his candidacy. He felt obliged to set before Burghley his qualifications for the post, promising to rule the college without partiality. Meanwhile Howland was kept in office, and did his best to promote Whitaker's cause. Only on 17 February 1587 were the college's acting visitors (including Burghley and Whitgift) able to proceed, authorizing an election before the full fellowship could be assembled. Even so, the fellows appear to have chosen another candidate; yet Whitaker was admitted to office by the vice-chancellor in Trinity on 25 February. On 27 May he proceeded DTh. By 29 June he had resigned the chancellorship at St Paul's. On 30 June he was admitted fellow of Eton College. <br>
<br>New statutes (1580) had given the master of St John's increased powers, and Whitaker was determined from the outset to exercise them. His first move was to expel Everard Digby, whom he identified as the leader of opposition among the fellows. Whitaker's real objection to him was his eclectic and relatively liberal theology; but knowing that this alone could not justify dismissal, he concocted a ragbag of disciplinary and financial charges. Digby managed a few hits by way of exchange (quoting Nowell against Calvin; and, having himself been accused of non-residence, mischievously noting that the master spent his nights in town with his wife). Digby was expelled and appealed to Whitgift; both he and Burghley felt that Whitaker had exceeded his powers, and in April 1588 ordered Digby's return. Neither party, however, was looking for a compromise. Digby provocatively boasted of his readeption, while Whitaker raised his game by appealing to the earls of Essex, Leicester, and Warwick. Whitgift continued to regret the &#145;violence of pr&aelig;cisenesse&#146; with which he saw his prot&eacute;g&eacute; acting, and told Leicester that the affair had degenerated into &#145;private revenge&#146;  (BL, Lansdowne MS 57, nos. 70, 72). Leicester intervened decisively by arranging for Digby to have a few months' grace and then, in effect, to be paid off. Whitaker seems to have had no connection with Leicester before this case, which therefore demonstrates the social address and political competence he already commanded. <h2>
<a name="Loveofthebrethren"></a>Love of the brethren</h2>Whitaker now embarked on a wholesale revision of the college statutes, designed to ensure the dominance of the divines over those of other faculties, and to curb gambling and other recreations. This was partly the customary purge of a new r&eacute;gime, but in sum it attempted to restructure St John's on the lines of the puritan academy founded at Emmanuel under Chaderton's mastership. The opposition at St John's drafted a counter-proposal of forty-three &#145;flatt breaches of statute&#146; which Whitaker had committed since his appointment, such as pushing through his own, unsuitable, nominations for college posts at inquorate meetings  (CUL, CUR 6.1, no. 35). But the fellows could not hope to remove the master under the existing statutes, and he would obviously not consent to changes making this possible; the controversy therefore subsided into deadlock. Meanwhile Whitaker's polemical output continued with <span class="italic">Disputatio ad sacra scriptura</span>, issued on 2 May 1588, in which he attacked Cardinal Bellarmine. <br>
<br>Further puritan agitation at Cambridge in 1589&#150;90 made Whitaker fear that a new visitation might &#145;pull up moe good plants than weedes&#146;, and he was worried even for his own tenure  (BL, Lansdowne MS 62, no. 41). Hostilities in St John's were resumed when it was revealed that in September 1589 a national presbyterian synod had been held in the college. Some said this took place in Whitaker's own lodging while he was away in Lancashire. The issue was raised in a letter of 20 October 1590 from Eleazar (son of John) Knox, one of the conservative fellows. Whitaker was at once summoned to London to explain. That the synod, the last of its kind, took place at St John's, is not in doubt; Chaderton and Cartwright attended, and the host was Henry Alvey, Whitaker's favourite and a noted radical activist. The question exercising the government was what the master knew, and when he knew it. In a carefully worded response, conveyed in a letter to Burghley on 26 October, Whitaker avoided all reference to the specific meeting of the national synod; instead he solemnly swore ignorance of a continuing presbyterian cell within the college&#151;something much harder to define and detect, and in any case not the issue. Whitaker's absence was genuine enough, but it it is difficult to believe that on his return he really was surprised to find his lodge appropriated for such a meeting. He was not the last Cambridge head to give covert assistance to a radical cause he was unable openly to endorse. Significantly, his regard for Alvey was undimmed, and in December 1591 he secured him as president (vice-master) against the wishes of the majority of the electors. He used the textbook tactic of provoking the conservatives to withdraw, and voting through his appointees in their absence. He added the delightful touch of naming some of the absentees to minor offices, so demonstrating his magisterial impartiality. <br>
<br>That the remaining years of Whitaker's mastership were uneventful is witness to the success with which he had packed the college with men of his own stamp. He gazed, however, on the lusher pasture next door. In April 1591 Nowell had recommended him for the mastership of Trinity should John Still be made a bishop. Whitaker jeopardized his prospects of any further crown appointment when, that month, he married Joan, widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/9287/', "Dudley Fenner (c.1558&#150;1587)")</script>, puritan minister of Cranbrook, Kent. She brought with her two daughters, More Fruit (<i>d</i>. in or after 1602) and Faint Not (<i>d</i>. in or after 1604). Whitaker would not have given his own children such ostentatiously puritan names, but his sympathies were again expressed in February 1593 in deploring the execution of separatists, which he contrasted with leniency shown to many Catholics. <h2>
<a name="Allsoundlearning"></a>All sound learning</h2>Whitaker's final major publication, <span class="italic">Adversus Thomae Stapletoni</span> (1594), was a refutation of another leading Catholic apologist. The last year of his life was dominated by the controversy over predestination, simmering at Cambridge throughout his professorship, which he now moved into the public domain. On 27 February 1595, preaching before a congregation including eight peers and many gentry, he condemned the doctrine of universal grace as taught by Peter Baro. In response on 29 April a junior fellow of Gonville and Caius College, William Barrett, preached a university sermon which shocked the establishment with its outright rejection of the Calvinist dogma of assured salvation for the self-recognized elect, and which included personal attacks on Calvin, Pietro Martire Vermigli (known as Peter Martyr), and other leading reformers. Whitaker, as regius professor, took a lead in prosecuting Barrett before the university's consistory court and beyond. Whitgift at first thought Barrett had been harshly treated for what seemed a fair point of academic debate. Whitaker and his colleagues eventually persuaded the archbishop and Burghley (as chancellor) that the emerging anti-Calvinist party, for whom Barrett was obviously a stalking horse, was a threat to the university's <i>magisterium</i> and privilege. If such offensive novelties were tolerated, &#145;greate difference in poyntes of religion will breake furthe&#146;  (Trinity College, Cambridge, MS B.14.9, p. 47). Whitgift proposed a conference at Lambeth between Barrett and his principal opponents. The archbishop's continuing confidence in Whitaker is shown by his appointment on 10 May to a canonry in Canterbury Cathedral. <br>
<br>Though further debate at Cambridge was meanwhile forbidden, on 9 October Whitaker set out in a Latin sermon his own uncompromising supralapsarian position. As he left for Lambeth he promised Chaderton he would &#145;stand to Gods cause against the Lutherans&#146;  (<span class="italic">Two Elizabethan Puritan Diaries</span>, 125). He took with him nine propositions in which his doctrine was hammered home from different angles: salvation and reprobation were determined for eternity; saving grace could never be forfeit. Though minor changes were agreed at the meeting on 20 November, perhaps by way of according Whitgift a share in the drafting, the Lambeth articles remain Whitaker's composition. Whitgift circumspectly commended them as &#145;private judgments&#146; in settlement of the Cambridge controversy  (<span class="italic">Salisbury MSS</span>, 5.465). Others would have had them tacked to the established articles of religion; this was sought at the Hampton Court conference in 1604, and in 1613 they were formally adopted by the Church of Ireland. In England, though Calvinism remained the orthodoxy for a generation more, the Lambeth articles were the high water mark of Calvinist doctrine. By the time Whitaker was on the way back to Cambridge, the queen had expressed outrage and had ordered the articles to be abrogated. Their particular theological definition, though misliked by her, was less the issue than the attempt by an unofficial assembly to ordain narrow confessionalism in place of settled imprecision. Whitaker had forgotten whose church he served. His usual self-confidence seems to have been ebbing before the Lambeth meeting. On 19 November, in an uncharacteristically whingeing letter to Burghley, he begged for a more lucrative position, with greater freedom for the further writing he planned. As he rode home on 29 November he was taken ill at Trumpington; on arriving at St John's he went straight to bed with a hot ague, and died in the master's lodge on 4 December, trusting &#145;shortly to see God face to face&#146;  (<span class="italic">Two Elizabethan Puritan Diaries</span>, 125). The whole university mustered for his funeral on the 9th; the vice-chancellor (Roger Goad) preached in Great St Mary's, and John Bois spoke at the interment in St John's on the same day. <br>
<br>Two days after his death Whitaker's widow had a son, whom she called Jabez. She subsequently married <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/37809/', "Josias Nicholls (c.1553&#150;1639/40)")</script>, puritan minister and religious controversialist. Whitaker's will does not survive, but he is known to have left means to his eldest son, Alexander. Whitaker had at least eight children. Samuel became a fellow of King's, while Richard was a prominent bookseller and publisher in Paul's Churchyard from 1618 to his death in 1648; in the 1630s he dedicated works to Charles I and Archbishop William Laud, but among his last publications was a work of Calvin. Jabez followed Alexander to Virginia and as a missionary to the Indians; he died in 1624. <h2>
<a name="Theconscienceoftherich"></a>The conscience of the rich</h2>Despite his many sinecures, Whitaker complained of poverty; no doubt his children and two stepchildren were a hefty expense. He also collected a library which the queen is said to have coveted, though Nowell said it had small resale value. Whitaker may have mismanaged his finances, but the claim that he was a &#145;contemner of money&#146;  (Fuller, 115) is a pious fiction. There is a wider contradiction, since it was axiomatic of Whitaker's anti-Roman polemic to discount the visible church, whose material benefits he nevertheless so obviously enjoyed, and in whose political machinations he excelled. Even his friends sensed this dilemma; Samuel Ward was thankful that Whitaker had died before becoming (as was expected) provost of Eton, and so being &#145;overcome with the world&#146;  (<span class="italic">Two Elizabethan Puritan Diaries</span>, 125). Whitaker's reputation was also oddly distorted by the wish of the conservative fellows of St John's to acquire a new master more to their liking; being now in a minority they could not risk a free election, but instead asked Burghley to nominate a successor to Whitaker, whom they could not overtly criticize. They therefore described their late master as a gentle and retiring scholar, whose unrelenting studies had prevented him from noticing the infiltration of the college by radicals. The plentiful encomiums of his friends were less devious but scarcely more plausible; chief among these was a life by Abdias Ashton, fellow of St John's, published in 1599 and reprinted in the 1610 Geneva edition of Whitaker's collected works. <br>
<br>The Whitaker who finally emerges is, by contrast, a formidable but believable figure, as sharp-minded and decisive in his administrative role as he was in theological argument. Yet even there is a paradox. Determined to eliminate mere philosophy from scriptural exegesis, asserting that reason alone was &#145;no lawful weapon in the Lords warfare&#146;  (<span class="italic">An Aunswere to &hellip; W. Rainoldes</span>, 187), he deployed a rarefied system of logic proceeding from his own considerable intellect. In debate he maintained a civil tone (except to Stapleton), and was generally respected by his opponents: it is said that Bellarmine placed his picture above his desk, rather as Montgomery was to keep an eye on Rommel. In appearance Whitaker was dark-haired, with a red face which nobody seems to have attributed to drink. He enjoyed chess and archery and, like his uncle Alexander, was an angler whose skill is recalled by Isaak Walton. When the new chapel was built at St John's in 1869, his memorial was replaced in a position of honour at the centre of the west wall.<br>
