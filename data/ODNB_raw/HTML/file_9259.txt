<span class="headword">Fell,  Leonard</span>  (1624&#150;1701), <span class="occ">Quaker missionary and writer</span>, was the son of Thomas Fell of Baycliff, near Ulverston in the Furness district of north Lancashire. He took service in the nearby godly household of Thomas Fell (1598&#150;1658) and Margaret Fell (1614&#150;1702) at Swarthmoor Hall, near Ulverston; despite their shared surname, he appears to have been at most their distant relation. There he was converted to Quakerism by George Fox on his evangelizing tour of north Lancashire in 1652. In the following year Fell married Agnes Chambers, who died in 1662; he subsequently married a woman whose first name was Mary and who died in 1708. In 1656 he contributed to the survey <span class="italic">The Persecution of them People they Call Quakers, in Several Places in Lancashire</span>. He himself experienced sharp persecution in the 1650s and 1660s&#151;he was imprisoned in Lancashire in 1654&#150;6, in Leicester in 1661, and in Lancashire again in 1666 and 1668. It was, then, from an unimpeachable position of a witness of suffering, that Fell could publish in 1670 <span class="italic">An Epistle for the Strengthening and Confirming of Friends in their most Holy Faith</span>, a work which urged Friends, &#145;Look not at sufferings, but look to the Lord that is able to deliver&#146;  (Backhouse, Backhouse, and Mounsey, 139). He was gaoled for refusal of tithes in 1671 and in the same year suffered distraint of goods as punishment for preaching.<br>
<br>Enumerated in 1676 (as &#145;husbandman&#146;, of Baycliff) among the evangelizing Quaker &#145;First Publishers of Truth&#146;, Fell travelled extensively on Quaker missions, often with Fox, with whom he was closely associated as a disciple. In 1677 he left Swarthmoor with Fox on an extensive preaching tour of the south of England, and he visited Scotland three times during the course of his career as a missionary, one of these expeditions taking place late in his life. Fell's regular travelling gave rise to a colourful anecdote involving him with a highwayman who stole his horse and money but who was charmed by his victim's protestation &#145;Though I would not give my life for my money or my horse, I would give it to save thy soul&#146; into returning the property  (Braithwaite, 370).<br>
<br>A Foxian loyalist, Fell, in 1677, joined in a denunciation of the anti-leadership Wilkinson&#150;Story separation within Quakerism. In 1684, at the height of the tory reaction, he was again gaoled, for absence from church, sharing his imprisonment in Lancaster with Margaret Fell. He was, however, evangelizing in Cornwall in 1686. On Fox's death in 1691 he paid his tribute to his mentor in <span class="italic">My Testimony for my Dear, True, and Well Beloved Friend and Father in Christ, George Fox</span>, and in 1693 in <span class="italic">A Warning to England in General, and the Cities of London and Bristol in Particular</span> he made his own contribution to this Quaker genre of admonitory literature. A model Quaker peace lover and reconciler, &#145;dear, ancient Leonard Fell&#146;  (Braithwaite, 369) made friends of quarrelling Sedbergh Quakers in 1695. Fell was saintly as well as peaceable, but was also a practical man of affairs, a horse dealer involved in regular financial transactions with the Fell household at Swarthmoor, as well as taking part in a property undertaking with the Quaker merchant of Lancaster, William Stout. He died in Darlington in 1701, having been a Quaker minister for forty or fifty years, and was buried there.<br>
