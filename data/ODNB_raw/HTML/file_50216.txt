<span class="headword">Berkeley,  William</span>, marquess of Berkeley  (1426&#150;1492), <span class="occ">magnate</span>, the eldest son of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/50214/', "James Berkeley, first Baron Berkeley (d. 1463)")</script>, and Isabel, widow of Henry Ferrers and daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/19459/', "Thomas (I) Mowbray, duke of Norfolk")</script>, and Elizabeth Fitzalan, was born at Berkeley Castle. He accompanied Cardinal Beaufort to the peace negotiations at Calais in 1439, presumably as a member of his household, and was knighted shortly after his return. His adolescence was dominated by the great feud between the Berkeleys and the Talbots over the descent of the Lisle barony which Thomas, Lord Berkeley, had enjoyed in right of his wife and which had passed via his daughter Elizabeth to his three granddaughters, among whom the Berkeleys' most committed opponent was Margaret, wife of the first earl of Shrewsbury. In 1451 a settlement was reached which was very much in the Talbots' favour, and which included the requirement that William Berkeley should enter the household of the earl of Shrewsbury's son Lord Lisle as surety for his father's observance of the agreement. The dispute lapsed until the death of James, Lord Berkeley, in November 1463, but was reopened by William and came to a head in 1470 when Margaret's grandson and heir, Thomas Talbot, Viscount Lisle, challenged Berkeley to battle during a period when royal authority had been defied by the rebellion of Warwick and Clarence. The challenge was accepted and the two forces met at Nibley Green, Gloucestershire, on 20 March, where Lisle was killed.<br>
<br>The costs which Berkeley incurred in pursuing the dispute made him vulnerable to royal pressure when the descent of the Mowbray duchy of Norfolk became an issue on the death of the last duke in January 1476, leaving a daughter, Anne, whom Edward IV chose as the wife for his second son, Richard. In May 1476, when the marriage was being planned but had not yet been effected, Berkeley agreed to surrender all his reversionary rights in the Mowbray inheritance to Prince Richard and his heirs, and, failing such heirs, to the king and his heirs male. In return Edward took over Berkeley's debts totalling &pound;34,000. In April 1481, probably as an encouragement to make the formal conveyance of the inheritance, which he had not yet done, Berkeley was made a viscount. On 19 November 1481 Anne died, and her estates, instead of reverting to the heirs general, Berkeley and his cousin John, Lord Howard, were settled on her young widower.<br>
<br>On 28 June 1483, two days after his accession, Richard III, in response to a petition from Berkeley, cancelled the settlement and divided the Mowbray inheritance between Howard, who became duke of Norfolk, and Berkeley, who was made earl of Nottingham. It seems, however, to have been understood from the outset that Berkeley would make over his share to the king. The formal grant was not made until 23 October 1484, but the manors concerned were at Richard's disposal earlier in the reign. The agreement was voided by the king's death at Bosworth. Howard died in the same battle and the Mowbray title of earl marshal, which he had held, was granted by Henry VII to Berkeley during pleasure on 26 October 1485.<br>
<br>To the disgust of the family historian, who dubbed him &#145;William Waste-all&#146;, Berkeley, who was by now childless and likely to remain so, continued to use his lands to buy advancement under the new regime. On 19 February 1486 he granted William Stanley his share of the Mowbray lands in Wales and the march, presumably in return for Stanley's support in having the title of earl marshal made into a life grant on the same day. In December 1488 he granted the reversion of Berkeley itself to Henry VII should he die childless and was rewarded with the title of marquess the following month. Grants were made on similar terms to several of the king's courtiers, including Reynold Bray, Thomas Stanley, earl of Derby, Richard Willoughby, and Humphrey Talbot, and it was evidently at court where Berkeley now spent most of his time. In 1490 he leased a house in the sanctuary, Westminster, and lived there for the remainder of his life.<br>
<br>Berkeley married three times. His first wife, whom he married in 1466, was Elizabeth, daughter of Reynold West, Lord de la Warr, and Margaret, daughter of Robert Thorley. Berkeley repudiated her shortly afterwards, whereupon she appealed to Rome, but the dissolution was upheld and in November 1468 he married Joan, widow of Sir William Willoughby and daughter of Sir Thomas Strangways and Katherine, daughter of Ralph Neville, earl of Westmorland. She died on 24 February 1485 and was buried in the Augustinian friary in London, where Berkeley himself was subsequently buried. His third wife was Anne, daughter of Sir John Fiennes, Lord Dacre, and Alice, daughter of Henry, Lord Fitzhugh. Berkeley died on 14 February 1492. His widow married Sir Thomas Brandon; she died on 10 September 1497 and was buried in St George's Chapel, Windsor. Berkeley had two children with Joan: Katherine and Thomas (<i>b</i>. 1470). Both died in 1475 or shortly afterwards, when negotiations were under way for Thomas's marriage to Mary, daughter of William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. Berkeley's heir was thus his brother Maurice. The two brothers had apparently been allies in 1470, when Maurice was granted an annuity for his support at Nibley Green, but Berkeley's land transactions from 1476 onwards were all at Maurice's expense, who inherited nothing at his brother's death. Only with the end of the male Tudor line at the death of Edward VI were the Berkeleys able to regain some of their alienated estates.<br>
