<span class="headword">Bisse,  Philip</span>  (<em>bap. </em>1666, <em>d.</em> 1721), <span class="occ">bishop of Hereford</span>, was baptized on 28 May 1666 at Oldbury on the Hill, Gloucestershire, the elder son of the Revd John Bisse (<i>c</i>.1638&#150;1686), rector of the parish, and his wife, Joyce Gyles. He was a cousin of Robert Harley, through whose patronage he no doubt won his later promotion to the episcopal bench. His brother <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/2477/', "Thomas Bisse (1675&#150;1731)")</script> was notable for his part in founding the Three Choirs festival. Philip entered Winchester College in 1682, where, though the college visitor later disallowed it, his family claimed for him special privileges as one of the founder's numerous kin. In June 1686 he entered New College, Oxford, where he graduated BA in 1690 and proceeded MA on 15 January 1694; he became a fellow and subsequently BD and DD (29 January 1706). On 13 February 1706 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In October 1710 he was consecrated bishop of St David's, and in September 1713 he was enthroned bishop of Hereford.<br>
<br>As for patronage, Bisse had already improved his position in 1704 by marrying Bridget Osborne (1661&#150;1718), daughter of Thomas Osborne, first duke of Leeds, formerly lord treasurer of Charles II, and widow of Charles fitz-Charles, earl of Plymouth, the king's illegitimate son. Bisse was her chaplain, and perhaps for this reason news of the marriage was not published until 1706. Described as Robert Harley's &#145;urbane and socially-minded cousin, whose talents as a genial matchmaker for the aristocratic young were unsurpassed&#146;  (Bennett, 141), Bisse gave him, as a moderate Hanover tory, political support. As earl of Oxford and treasurer, Harley repaid this by having him preferred to his two bishoprics in 1710 and 1713 respectively. In return Bisse supported Harley, even through his impeachment, by frequent attendance in the House of Lords until at least 1719, and also by often acting as proxy for Bishop George Hooper of Bath and Wells. In ecclesiastical politics, too, like John Robinson, bishop successively of Bristol and London, and like Hooper, Bisse was a moderate in the Harleian mould. Certainly as bishop of St David's he was a prominent member of a small inner group of six tory bishops in convocation in 1710. Chosen by them to bear a message to the queen, he was noted to have managed his business so well that the queen &#145;was pleased to send us a message in writing&#146;  (Sykes, 1.130). In 1714 some thought that his political and ecclesiastical activity betrayed a reputation for angling, like others, for further preferment to the archbishopric of York when it fell vacant on John Sharp's death; and a contemporary noted that &#145;our friend the bishop of Hereford never at first desired a bishopric so much as he now does a better&#146;  (<span class="italic">Portland MSS</span>, 178).<br>
<br>Despite his political connections Bisse was an exemplary diocesan bishop. He undertook his episcopal duties with efficiency and care of the highest order. The articles for his primary visitation, originally planned for 1714 but postponed until 1716, displayed an unusual thoroughness. They were presented in a new format, and copied by his successors; and there were special new sections on charities, and enquiries into peculation and overzealousness of his diocesan officers. In 1718 he introduced a new investigation into the use and abuse of diocesan charitable investments. Moreover not only was Bisse enthroned in person at a time when many bishops used proxies, but he also himself regularly conducted the ordinations in Hereford Cathedral. Seven out of the eleven ordinations he undertook were held there and only one was outside the diocese&#151;at Duke Street Chapel, Westminster, soon after he became bishop. Furthermore he impressed many by extensively refurbishing the cathedral and the bishop's palace. He died at Westminster on 6 September 1721, and was buried in Hereford Cathedral on 11 September. His only published works were a few sermons. He may have been a political schemer and an artful manipulator of patronage, but, more important, he was a dedicated and efficient diocesan bishop.<br>
