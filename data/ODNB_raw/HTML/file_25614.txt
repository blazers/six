<span class="headword">Sinclair,  George</span>, fifth earl of Caithness  (1566/7&#150;1643), <span class="occ">nobleman</span>, was the son of John Sinclair, master of Caithness (<i>d</i>. 1575), and Lady Jean or Janet Hepburn, only daughter of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/13007/', "Patrick Hepburn, third earl of Bothwell (c.1512&#150;1556)")</script>, and widow of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/26490/', "John Stewart (c.1531&#150;1563)")</script>, and was half-brother of <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/12999/', "Francis Stewart, first earl of Bothwell (d. 1612)")</script>. His father, imprisoned at Castle Girnigoe on the advice of his grandfather <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/25613/', "George Sinclair, fourth earl of Caithness")</script>, died there in 1575, after seven years of &#145;famine and vermine&#146; (Gordon, 164; Calder, 105). After succeeding to his grandfather's title in 1582, Caithness was, according to one source, known as Wicked Earl George, and he lived up to this by murdering his father's gaolers, Ingram and David Sinclair, shooting the former in the head and killing the latter with his sword.<br>
<br>Caithness suffered a diminution of his influence in 1584 when, through George Gordon, sixth earl of Huntly, his office of justiciary of Caithness was reduced. He had his grandfather's &#145;hatred towards the house of Sutherland&#146;  (Gordon, 179), and the earls of Sutherland and Caithness were often called to Elgin where, in the presence of Huntly, &#145;hereditary judge and arbitrator of all debates and controversies&#146;  (ibid., 200), they would make bonds and be reconciled, but never for very long. On 29 July 1585 Caithness married Lady Jean, only sister of Huntly and daughter of George Gordon, fifth earl of Huntly (<i>d</i>. 1576), and his wife, Lady Anne Hamilton. Caithness received a remission under the great seal for the murders of a David Hume and of the Sinclairs, but in 1594 or 1595 he was revealed to be one of those nobles of Roman Catholic sympathies who had entered a bond with his rebellious stepbrother Bothwell.<br>
<br>In 1606 Caithness and Sutherland were among a number of nobles suspected of popery, and ordered to confine themselves within the bounds of certain towns and to sign an assurance to keep the peace under pain of rebellion. Caithness then, having mistreated the earl of Orkney's servants, fell into a dispute with him, which came to the attention of the king and the privy council. Under caution of 10,000 marks he was compelled to sign another assurance of peaceable behaviour in 1608 to last until 1610. The two earls were reconciled, and Caithness finally bound himself in future to allow a free and safe passage to all the king's subjects through Caithness to and from Orkney.<br>
<br>On 12 November 1612 Caithness was appointed to the commission of the peace and in the following year recommended himself to the privy council by delivering up his kinsman Lord Maxwell, who had taken refuge at Castle Sinclair. On 26 May 1614 he received a commission for the pursuit, capture, and punishment of pirates infesting the north-east coast between Peterhead and Shetland, and on 12 July was named one of a commission for the apprehension of &#145;jesuits, seminary priests&#146; and &#145;verie dangerous pestis in this commonvele&#146; who frequently visited Caithness  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 10.241). On 6 August he was commissioned as king's lieutenant for the suppression of the rebellion of the earl of Orkney, detained in Dumbarton Castle, and his illegitimate son Robert Stewart, who had fortified himself in Kirkwall and openly defied the king's authority. With 100 men he compelled the Kirkwall garrison to surrender, and received a warrant to destroy the castle.<br>
<br>Later in 1614 Caithness visited the king in London and received remission of his past crimes and a yearly pension of 1000 crowns. He was also made a privy councillor in Scotland. However, all these signs of favour were lost within a short time. In 1615 the corn of Lord Forbes's tenants in Sansett was burnt, and, to remove any suspicion from himself, Caithness spread the rumour that the Mackays had committed the offence. After complaints were made to the privy council Caithness was said to have caused the witnesses to be drowned so that no actual proof could be found against him. Lord Forbes demanded a reset of the incendiaries, and on 11 June Caithness was denounced for not exhibiting them, while later in the year he was denounced a rebel for his &#145;papistical&#146; opinions. He obtained a remission by resigning the sheriffdom of Caithness and by forfeiting his yearly pension.<br>
<br>Eventually Caithness got hopelessly into debt and on 1 June 1619 was denounced for trying to defy outlawry. On 25 October 1620 his eldest son, William Sinclair, Lord Berriedale, who had been imprisoned for some of his father's debts, complained to the privy council, and Caithness was obliged to mortgage several portions of his estate to satisfy creditors. After various ineffectual moves against him in 1621, on 19 December 1622 a commission was issued to Sir Robert Gordon to reduce him to obedience. When negotiation failed, Gordon was given on 10 June 1623 sanction to use &#145;fire and sword&#146; and &#145;all the lieges of the north&#146; were commanded to assist  (<span class="italic">Reg. PCS</span>, 13.281, 283). Caithness fled, first to Orkney and then to Shetland. On 30 March 1624 a proclamation warned all mariners against helping him back to Orkney or Caithness, but on 10 June the proclamation against intercommuning with him was cancelled, and a new protection was granted to him to go to Edinburgh and deal with his creditors. Reaching agreement with them, he obtained an extension of his protection and an allowance from his estates for the remaining years of his life.<br>
<br>It is accepted that with his wife, Countess Jean, Caithness had three sons and one daughter: his son William was living in 1623, but died before his father; Francis married Elizabeth, daughter of Andrew Fraser, Lord Fraser; John, a lieutenant-colonel in Swedish service, was killed in the Palatinate in 1632; Elizabeth, his daughter, in 1621 married George Lindsay, fourteenth earl of Crawford. He also had two illegitimate sons: Francis, ancestor of the Sinclairs of Sterkoke, and John. He may also have had an illegitimate daughter who married the laird of Dunn. When Caithness died in February 1643 he was succeeded by his great-grandson George Sinclair (<i>d</i>. 1676), William's grandson, who, childless and deep in debt, in 1672 made over the lands and titles to Sir John Campbell of Glenorchy.<br>
