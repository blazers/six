<span class="headword">Madeleine</span> <span class="st"> [Madeleine de Valois]</span>  (1520&#150;1537), <span class="occ">queen of Scots, consort of James V</span>, was the second daughter and fourth child of Fran&ccedil;ois I of France (1494&#150;1547) and his first wife, Claude (1499&#150;1524), daughter of Louis XII of France and Anne of Brittany. She was born on 10 August 1520, at St Germain-en-Laye, and joined her elder sister, Charlotte, and brothers, the dauphin Fran&ccedil;ois and Prince Henri, in the royal nurseries. Claude had two more children, Charles and Marguerite, but died when Madeleine was four, and little Charlotte died that same year. The princes and princesses had their own household and in 1523 this comprised no fewer than 240 officials and servants, including five chamberlains, nine stewards, and twenty pages. After Queen Claude's death the children's upbringing was supervised by their paternal grandmother, Louise de Savoie. When she died in 1531 the king's mistress, Anne d'Heilly, later duchesse d'&Eacute;tampes, and his learned sister Marguerite, queen of Navarre, took charge of the girls.<br>
<br>Madeleine's daily companions also came and went. Her brothers the dauphin and Prince Henri were taken away to Spain as hostages and remained there for four years. They came back in 1530 and, three years after that, Henri's young bride, Catherine de' Medici, arrived from Italy. No mention was made, however, of a match for Madeleine. A charming childhood drawing of her shows a plump little girl clutching a rattle, but she seems to have contracted tuberculosis and was judged too sickly for marriage. In October 1536, however, <script>writeSeealsoLink('../view/article/14591/', "James V (1512&#150;1542), king of Scots")</script>, arrived at Dieppe in search of a French wife. As long before as 1517 the Franco-Scottish treaty of Rouen had promised the then five-year-old James &#145;a daughter of the French king already living or yet to be born&#146;  (Donaldson, 99). He had inherited the throne at the age of one, whereupon his nobility had engaged in bitter power struggles with each other and nothing had been done about the marriage. Now, however, he was ruling for himself, and he had forceful ideas about his country's future. His uncle Henry VIII had broken with Rome and was urging him to do likewise. He refused to listen, instead resolving to strengthen Scotland's traditional alliance with France.<br>
<br>When he asked Fran&ccedil;ois for the promised bride, James was offered the duc de Vend&ocirc;me's daughter Marie. He went to see her for himself, incognito, but made the excuse that she was too ill-shaped. In fact, he seems to have been determined to have no less than a French princess, and set off for the French court which was then at Lyons. A portrait of Madeleine, probably painted that autumn, shows a rather sallow, serious girl in a jewelled French hood and a dark dress with ermine sleeves. James was handsome, highly-strung, and attractive to women. According to the Scottish chronicler Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, when Madeleine met him she fell in love with him and persuaded her father, against his better judgement, to agree to the match. Whatever the truth of the matter, negotiations went ahead, in spite of her doctors' warnings that she would never survive the cold Scottish climate.<br>
<br>The marriage contract was finalized in Blois on 26 November 1536. The court then proceeded to Paris, where James spent 1100 crowns on a great table diamond for his bride's spousing ring. The wedding took place at Notre Dame on 1 January 1537, the bridal party standing on a platform which was draped with cloth of gold just outside the cathedral. They then went inside to hear mass, and finished the day with a magnificent banquet. After lengthy celebrations the young couple set out for the coast. They were delayed at Rouen when Madeleine fell ill, but by May she had recovered sufficiently to set out on the long voyage to Scotland. She and James took up residence in the palace of Holyroodhouse while elaborate preparations were made for the ceremonial entry into Edinburgh and coronation of the new queen. Within weeks of her arrival, however, Madeleine fell ill once more, and although she seemed to be recovering in early June, she died in her husband's arms on 7 July 1537.<br>
<br>Thomas Arthur, the royal tailor, laid aside the celebratory garments he had been making and started work on mourning gowns instead. James wrote to tell his father-in-law of the death of &#145;votre fille, ma tres chere compaigne&#146;  (Paris, Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Fonds Clairambault, MS 48, fol. 5971) and one of his officials began to list the young queen's belongings. There were gowns of cloth of gold, black velvet, and crimson satin, a kirtle of violet satin embroidered with gold, her silver cross and altar plate, and the two little gold cups made for her when she was a child.<br>
<br>Madeleine was buried in Holyrood Abbey, and a few weeks later James sent an emissary to France to ask her father for a replacement bride.<br>
