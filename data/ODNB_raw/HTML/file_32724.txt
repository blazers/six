<div class="para">
<span class="headword">David,  Albert Augustus</span>  (1867&#150;1950), <span class="occ">bishop of Liverpool and headmaster</span>, was born in Exeter on 19 May 1867, the second son of the Revd William David, then principal of the Exeter Diocesan Training College for schoolmasters and afterwards priest-vicar of the cathedral, and his wife, Antonia Altgelt. After attending Exeter School he won a classical scholarship to Queen's College, Oxford, where he took a first in both classical moderations and Greats. He was successively a lecturer at his college, a master at Bradfield College and Rugby School, and then a fellow of his college. He was ordained priest in 1895. David married Edith Mary, daughter of the late Thomas William Miles, of the public works department, India, in 1909, and they had three sons and one daughter.<br>
<br>In 1905 David became headmaster of Clifton College. A tall and imposing presence, he was a great success with masters, boys, and the school's trustees. He introduced physical drill into the curriculum, expanded the chapel and grounds, and increased pupil numbers. But when he moved back to Rugby as headmaster in 1909, he did not repeat this success. He had become interested in the progressive educational theories of a controversial American psychologist, Homer Lane, some of which he now sought to implement. He was concerned that the public schools did nothing for the less able boy, and sought to reform the curriculum to promote creativity and free expression. He later expanded on these ideas in his book <span class="italic">Life and the Public School</span> (1932). David encouraged masters at Rugby to experiment with new teaching methods, and allowed one of them, J. H. Simpson, to institute a system of self-government for his class, in which boys were constituted into a court to discipline their peers. Such innovations went too far for many of his older masters, who felt that he was jeopardizing the discipline and reputation of the school, and one of them, G. F. Bradby, wrote a comic novel, <span class="italic">The Chronicles of Dawnhope</span> (1921), satirizing David's progressive regime.<br>
<br>David, who had been made DD in 1910, had already refused four offers of bishoprics when he was appointed bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich in 1921. He had barely made a start in his new diocese before being translated to Liverpool in 1923. As only the third Anglican bishop of Liverpool, he inherited an unfinished cathedral, consecrated in 1924. David also had to confront the city's sectarian divisions, which erupted into violent attacks by protestant mobs on Anglo-Catholic churches and on the Anglican cathedral in 1932.<br>
<br>But the most serious sectarian controversy of his episcopate came from an unlikely source, Unitarianism. David was a liberal churchman, and during the First World War he had been prominent in Life and Liberty, the campaign for church self-government which was led by his old pupil from Rugby William Temple. But in 1933&#150;4 David found himself in conflict with Temple, who was by then archbishop of York, over whether Unitarians should preach in Anglican churches. David was a proponent of reunion with the nonconformists, and to this end gave permission for the prominent Unitarian L. P. Jacks to preach at a special service in Liverpool Cathedral in 1933. This was a controversial move. Many Anglicans held that Unitarians were not Christians because they denied the Trinity. David defended his action on the narrow grounds that Jacks had preached at a special service, and when the dean, F. W. Dwelly, invited another Unitarian, Lawrence Redfern, to preach at a regular cathedral service, the bishop reproved him. But this legalistic distinction did not satisfy critics like Lord Hugh Cecil, who accused David of promoting heresy. In 1934 the bishops of the northern province, led by William Temple, rebuked David for inviting non-Christian ministers to preach at Anglican services.<br>
<br>David remained bishop until 1944, raising &pound;85,000 for his diocese before retiring to Cornwall. He was elected an honorary fellow of Queen's College, Oxford, in 1920, and received an honorary DD from Glasgow University in 1937. Besides his work on the public schools, he published a number of devotional books, and a pamphlet, <span class="italic">Who are Christians?</span> (1934), justifying his conduct in the unitarianism controversy.<br>
<br>David died at Trebetherick, Cornwall, on 24 December 1950. His wife survived him.<br>
