<span class="headword">Peyton,  Edward</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1749), <span class="occ">naval officer</span>, details of whose parents and upbringing are unknown, entered the navy in 1707 as a volunteer per order on the <i>Scarborough</i>. Afterwards he served as a volunteer in the <i>Kingston</i> for over four years, during which he participated in the abortive expedition to the St Lawrence in 1711. Peyton went on to serve as midshipman in the <i>Aldborough</i> and the <i>Elizabeth</i>. He passed his lieutenant's examination on 4 August 1715, but seems not to have gained a commission. On 6 February 1716 he married Ester Higgins at the church of St Mary, Lewisham, Kent. What he did during the next eleven years is unclear, but he was given a commission as fourth lieutenant in the <i>Royal Oak</i> on 30 April 1727 by Sir Charles Wager, whose squadron was cruising off the Spanish coast. The commission was confirmed on 6 February 1728 and he was promoted third lieutenant on 22 May. On 26 July he became lieutenant on the <i>Gibraltar</i> and seems to have joined the ship with her new captain, John Stanley, at Lisbon. Peyton left the ship when she refitted at Deptford and was not recommissioned when the <i>Gibraltar</i> left for America under Captain Henry Medley. However, Peyton rejoined the <i>Gibraltar</i> on 23 November 1733 and went with Medley to the Mediterranean. Peyton was commissioned lieutenant in the <i>Dursley Galley</i> on 18 June 1734, and stayed with this ship on cruising and convoy duties in the Mediterranean until 20 January 1738, when the muster book notes that he &#145;quitted&#146; the ship. He seems to have made his way back to England and on 24 April 1738 he was commissioned lieutenant of the <i>Chatham</i>, which was fitting out for Newfoundland under Captain Vanburgh. The <i>Chatham</i> spent the summer at Newfoundland and in October escorted the fisheries trade to the markets of Lisbon and Leghorn. At Leghorn, on 24 February 1739, Vanburgh left the ship and Peyton was commissioned first lieutenant of the <i>Somerset</i>, flagship of the commander of the Mediterranean squadron, Rear-Admiral Nicholas Haddock.<br>
<br>Peyton's first command, from 27 June 1739, was as master and commander of the sloop <i>Grampus</i> in which he resumed the familiar convoy and cruising work between Port Mahon and Gibraltar. On 17 January 1740 he was put in command of the bomb-vessel <i>Salamander</i>. On 20 January Captain Ambrose of the <i>Greyhound</i> was suspended after complaints by the Lisbon merchants and on 4 April Haddock gave Peyton a commission as captain of the <i>Greyhound</i>&#151;he had thus at last achieved post rank. On 16 July Peyton took command of the <i>Kennington</i>. Operations in the <i>Kennington</i> took Peyton to the West Indies, where he saw the remnants of the expeditionary force return from the failure to take Cartagena de las Indias. After returning to Portsmouth for a refit he convoyed trade to Ireland and on to Gibraltar. The new commander in the Mediterranean, Vice-Admiral Thomas Mathews, promoted Peyton to the <i>Rochester</i> on 10 June 1743. He stayed in the <i>Rochester</i> only until 3 August, when Mathews chose him to take dispatches to the king in Hanover and then on to the ministry and Admiralty in London.<br>
<br>Peyton had gained considerable experience at sea and evidence of high regard from his commanders when he arrived in London. However, he heard that Captain Ambrose had been acquitted at a court martial and was to be paid as captain of the <i>Greyhound</i> during his suspension. This called into question both Peyton's pay and seniority. Peyton wrote to the Admiralty: &#145;I believe there is no precedent of any Gentleman having served without a commission from any admiral on board his majesty's ships (especially in time of war) without being confirmed from it. I therefore hope their Lordships will not make me a precedent&#146;  (Peyton to the secretary of the Admiralty board, 7 Oct 1743, TNA: PRO, ADM 1/2285). He heard nothing and wrote again requesting the confirmation of his commission. He feared &#145;being commanded by so many gentlemen that I must always look on as juniors to me. I must also beg their Lordships to consider my service on board the <i>Greyhound</i> was in time of war on a station where I might have lost my life and limbs and surely I deserv'd something for my service&#146;. He offered to give up the pay if only they would confirm his rank  (ibid., 21 Jan 1744). Although he received no reply from the Admiralty it appears that this compromise was accepted and his post rank was dated from 4 April 1740  (TNA: PRO, ADM 6/424).<br>
<br>On 19 March 1744 Peyton was given command of the <i>Medway</i> (60 guns); she was under two years old, but already plagued with a serious leak that could not be located. He sailed as part of Commodore Curtis Barnett's small squadron for the East Indies in May 1744. After leaving Madagascar the <i>Medway</i> and the frigate <i>Diamond</i> were sent to cruise the straits of Malacca, where Peyton captured a large French merchant ship, which was added to the squadron as the <i>Medway Prize</i> (40 guns). Peyton later joined Barnett at Batavia, where the <i>Medway</i> was cleaned and the problem of the ship's leak became more pronounced. The force later sailed for the Bay of Bengal. Throughout the following months rumours of a French squadron reaching this coast forced Barnett to keep his force together despite diminishing stores, fouled bottoms, and the serious leak in the <i>Medway</i>.<br>
<br>On 29 April 1746 Barnett died at Fort St David, Cuddalore, and Peyton, as senior captain, assumed command of the force. By June the <i>Medway</i> was taking in so much water that he decided to take the whole force to Trincomalee to repair her. On 25 June he fell in with the long-expected French squadron off Negapatam. The force that La Bourdonnais, the governor of Mauritius, had managed to assemble consisted of nine large ships. Peyton drew up his vessels into line of battle and by late afternoon there was a general cannonading along the line. The following day, calms and light winds precluded renewing the action. Three British ships had severely damaged masts and a council of war decided it was best to seek repairs at Trincomalee, so the British force bore away. On 27 July Peyton's squadron was at sea again in search of the French. On 7 August he sighted them in Negapatam Road and bore down. The following day, as the two squadrons closed, Peyton believed that the French were now considerably reinforced and decided not to pursue the action. Instead he stood off to remain in a position to protect a convoy expected from England. With the French close to Madras, provisions short, and the <i>Medway's</i> leak causing great concern he sailed to re-provision in the Hooghly River, south of Calcutta. La Bourdonnais unexpectedly captured Madras on 10 September while Peyton's squadron was careening and victualling. Peyton was still effecting these repairs when Commodore Thomas Griffin arrived with reinforcements in December 1746.<br>
<br>Although there were no immediate repercussions news of the loss of Madras reached England by the end of 1747. The secret committee of the East India Company, the principal executive body of the company, complained to the Admiralty about Peyton on 8 December that year and the board reacted by ordering Griffin to arrest Peyton. Peyton had been ill since the end of 1747; his health suffered further when he was confined aboard the <i>Pearl</i>, which, with Peyton and his witnesses, returned with Griffin to England and arrived at Spithead on 6 July 1749. Peyton remained confined aboard the <i>Winchester</i> until the end of the month and was eventually allowed to return to London to await events. Although too ill to travel, Peyton considered himself a prisoner and pleaded for his case to be brought to trial. However, by then the East India Company had made it clear to the Admiralty that it would not proceed as the principal complainant against Peyton. On 16 September 1749 Peyton informed the Admiralty that his condition had become so bad that he hoped<blockquote>their Lordships will excuse me that I have at last put myself into his hands [his surgeon, Mr Sharp] and shall tomorrow undergo an operation for the stone. If I survive it as soon as I am able to go out I will acquaint their Lordships and be ready to attend their commands. (Peyton to the secretary of the Admiralty board, TNA: PRO, ADM 1/2289)</blockquote>He survived the operation, but died on 26 October of &#145;a mortification in his foot&#146;  (TNA: PRO, ADM 6/424). He was buried at St Alfege, Greenwich, on 31 October 1749.<br>
<br>Peyton was an officer with great experience in keeping ships at sea for long periods in difficult circumstances. The need to keep his squadron seaworthy and a threat to the French until reinforcements arrived led to decisions that ended with the loss of Madras. Although never formally condemned for this, he was never able to justify his behaviour and the result was to end his career and probably to shorten his life.<br>
