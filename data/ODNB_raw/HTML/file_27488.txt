<span class="headword">Todd,  Elliott D'Arcy</span>  (1808&#150;1845), <span class="occ">army officer in the East India Company</span>, was born on 28 January 1808 in Bury Street, St James's, London, the third and youngest son of Fryer Todd, accountant, of Chancery Lane, a Yorkshire gentleman of good family and originally wealthy. His mother was Mary Evans, the &#145;Mary&#146; of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. His father lost his money by speculation, the home was broken up, and Elliott D'Arcy Todd, when three years old, came under the care of his maternal uncle, William Evans, of the East India Company's home establishment. He was educated at Ware, Hertfordshire, and in London, and, through his guardian's influence, entered the company's military college, Addiscombe College, in 1822, passing out in December 1823.<br>
<br>Todd was commissioned second lieutenant in the Bengal artillery on 18 December 1823, landed at Calcutta on 22 May 1824, and was stationed at the artillery headquarters at Dum-Dum until the rainy season of 1825, when he was posted to the 4th company 3rd battalion of foot artillery at Cawnpore. His company joined Lord Combermere's army for the second siege of Bharatpur. When the place was taken on 18 January 1826 Todd received a subaltern's share of the prize money amounting to &pound;250, and the same year he was posted to the 1st troop 2nd brigade of the horse artillery; but, on promotion to first lieutenant on 28 September 1827 he reverted to the foot artillery. He was posted in 1828 to a horse artillery troop at Mathura. In January 1829 he moved to Karnal, where bad health compelled him to go on sick leave to the hills.<br>
<br>On 2 March 1831 Todd was transferred to the 1st troop 1st brigade horse artillery. He studied Persian with such success that the Indian government, who, among their efforts to enable the shah of Persia to maintain his independence, had decided in 1833 to send British officers to instruct the Persian army, selected Todd to serve with the regular Persian troops under Colonel Pasmore, and to be artillery instructor. He embarked at Calcutta on 7 August, and arrived at Tehran on 28 March 1834. After the death of Shah Fatteh Ali and the accession of Muhammad Shah, a firman was issued on 31 July 1835 placing all matters connected with artillery in Todd's hands.<br>
<br>Todd took great pains in drilling the artillery at Tehran, and received from the shah the second class of the order of the Lion and Sun. Sir Henry Ellis, British minister at Tehran, was much impressed by a critical paper by Todd on Burnes's <span class="italic">Military Memoir on the Countries between the Caspian and the Indus</span>. Ellis wrote to Lord Auckland, the governor-general, urging the necessity of a political agent at Kabul, and recommending Todd.<br>
<br>In the autumn of 1836 Todd was at Tabriz as military secretary to Major-General Sir Henry Lindesay Bethune, commanding the Persian legion trained by British officers, but when Bethune declined to accompany the shah's troops beyond Khorasan and returned to Tehran, Todd was sent, in January 1837, by John McNeill (1795&#150;1883), British minister, to travel by the shores of the Caspian, Ghilan, and Rudbar, to Qazvin, and thence to Tehran. For his report on this route he received a complimentary letter from Palmerston. He was granted the local rank of major while specially employed on service in Persia. In March 1838 Todd accompanied the British minister to the Persian camp before Herat, where he arrived on 6 April. Todd was employed by McNeill to negotiate with the Heratis, and, as it was the first time a British officer had appeared in Herat in full uniform, &#145;a vast crowd went out to gaze at him&#146;  (Kaye, <span class="italic">History</span>, 1.256). The negotiations failed, and in May Todd carried dispatches from McNeill to Lord Auckland. He travelled as an Englishman, but in Afghan dress and without baggage, and his route was by Kandahar, Kabul, and Peshawar. He arrived at Simla on 20 July, having accomplished the ride in sixty days.<br>
<br>On 1 October 1838 Todd was appointed political assistant and military secretary to William Hay Macnaghten, the British envoy and minister to Shah Shuja. He was promoted to be brevet captain on 18 December 1838. He arrived with Sir John Keane's army at Kandahar in April 1839. Eldred Pottinger was the political agent at Herat, but it was decided to send Todd on a special mission to negotiate a treaty with Shah Kamran, whose chief minister, or wazir, was Yar Muhammad, of whom Kaye has written &#145;of all the unscrupulous miscreants in Central Asia, Yar Mahommed was the most unscrupulous&#146;  (<span class="italic">History</span>, 1.218). The mission left Kandahar in June, and arrived at Herat on 25 July. A treaty was concluded with the Shah Kamran, by which he was allowed 25,000 rupees a month on certain conditions, one of which was that he should have no communication with Persia without the consent of the British envoy. A committed Christian, Todd loathed the slave trade and the cruelties of the Herati government. M. E. Yapp has suggested that &#145;a more cynical, less scrupulous unambitious man might have been a better envoy at Herat&#146;  (Yapp, 364). Todd favoured British annexation of Herat, but Auckland refused it. After Pottinger's departure for Kabul in September 1839 things went on smoothly at Herat for some months. One of the objects of the mission was to try to stop the slave trade by the central Asian peoples. In this traffic Yar Muhammad, the khan of Khiva, and the Turkoman peoples towards the Caspian were the chief offenders. In December 1839 Todd, on his own responsibility, sent Captain James Abbott, one of his assistants, on a friendly mission to the khan of Khiva to mediate between him and the Russians who were advancing on Khiva, and to negotiate for the release of the enslaved Russian captives. Todd's action was approved. Later, again on his own initiative, he sent Richmond Shakespear to Khiva to negotiate the release of the Russians sold into slavery, which Shakespear accomplished to the number of 416 captives.<br>
<br>Early in April 1840 Todd received, through the British charg&eacute; d'affaires at Erzurum, a letter which the wazir, Yar Muhammad, had written in January in the name of Shah Kamran to the Persian Shah Mahommed; Kamran declared himself the faithful servant of the Persian monarch, and stated that he merely tolerated the British at Herat from expediency. Kamran and his people had been saved from starvation by British aid, and had received over 10 lakhs of rupees from the Indian government. The act of treachery was, however, pardoned by the governor-general.<br>
<br>On 27 January 1841 Todd was formally gazetted political agent at Herat. From the time of his first arrival at Herat in 1839 he had desired to introduce into Herat a contingent of Indian troops under British officers. Early in 1841 Kamran and his minister proposed to agree to their introduction on condition that &pound;20,000 was paid down and the monthly subsidy increased. It soon, however, became clear to Todd that Yar Muhammad and his master had no intention of admitting any contingent into Herat. Todd, apparently misunderstanding private instructions from Macnaghten, provoked a rupture with the Herati government. He refused to pay the subsidies. Yar Muhammad demanded more money, then expelled the mission. After submitting to indignities short of personal violence, Todd withdrew the mission on 9 February 1841 to Kandahar, without first receiving permission to do so.<br>
<br>Auckland was so exasperated by the withdrawal of the mission, which he believed jeopardized his policy, that, without waiting for Todd's explanations, he removed Todd from the political department and ordered him to rejoin his regiment as a subaltern. Todd was shocked by this. Macnaghten wrote to comfort him that his conduct had been admirable and that he had told Auckland so. But Auckland, angry and bitter at Todd's conduct at Herat, was obdurate. Todd ceased to be political agent and military secretary to the envoy at Kabul on 24 March 1841, and gave over charge of the Herat political agency on 24 April, when he was posted to the Bengal artillery. Before joining he went to Calcutta, and had an interview with Auckland, but without result.<br>
<br>Todd joined his regiment at Dum-Dum in March 1842, having been appointed to command no. 9 light field battery on 2 February. He was promoted to be captain in the Bengal artillery on 13 May 1842, and on 22 August of the following year he married Marian, eldest daughter of Surgeon Backshall Lane Sandham of the 16th lancers. It was a brief marriage. On 27 September 1845 he was given the command of the 2nd troop of the 1st brigade of the horse artillery. His wife died on 9 December, and Todd left to take part in the First Anglo-Sikh War. At sunset on 21 December 1845 Todd's troop was ordered forward at the battle of Ferozeshahr. He placed himself in front of the troop, and was giving orders to advance when his head was taken off by a roundshot. His remains were buried on the field of battle.<br>
