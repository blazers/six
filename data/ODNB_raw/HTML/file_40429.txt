<span class="headword">Morrison,  James Horne</span>  (1872&#150;1947), <span class="occ">Church of Scotland minister and author</span>, was born on 2 September 1872 in Aberdeen, the youngest of the four sons and one daughter of William Morrison (1835&#150;1912), head gardener at the Aberdeen Mental Asylum, and his wife, Jane (1832&#150;1925), a domestic servant, daughter of John Horne and his wife, Jane, both of Forgue, Aberdeenshire. When his father became head gardener to the dowager duchess of Gordon at Huntly Lodge, Aberdeenshire, James Morrison attended the local Gordon Schools (<i>c</i>.1878&#150;1888) and was dux of his upper school. In 1888, at the age of sixteen, he entered the University of Aberdeen, from which in 1892 he received his MA degree with honours in classics and philosophy, in the process taking prizes in mathematics and physics. Later that year he entered New College, Edinburgh, to prepare for the ministry of the Free Church of Scotland, and in his first year won prizes in Hebrew and natural science.<br>
<br>Following his second year at Edinburgh, Morrison offered himself as a student missionary in the Canadian North West Territories. He was sent to the district known as Assiniboia in April 1894, where for twelve months he laboured among mostly Scottish settlers in the area of Buffalo Lake, north of Moose Jaw. He arrived in North America at the height of agrarian unrest caused by a combination of commercial depression and crop failure during a devastating summer. Only his fine equipoise enabled Morrison to overcome the drought and heat of that summer and the bitter cold of the subsequent winter. All this he described in a compelling personal journal, a rare first-hand account of prairie life during the period, containing evocative accounts of settlers' lives. He also revealed high descriptive powers in portrayals of natural phenomena.<br>
<br>Morrison returned to Scotland in April 1895 and that autumn commenced his third year of theological study. Elected president of the New College missionary society during his fourth year, he graduated in March 1897. He served as an assistant minister, first at the South Free Church, Aberdeen, until 1899, and then at St Leonard's United Free Church, Perth, to 1901. In July 1901 he was ordained and was inducted as minister of the United Free Church of Falkland, Fife. On 3 September he married Lizzie Jane Milne (1874&#150;1962); the union produced three sons and two daughters.<br>
<br>From March to September 1914 Morrison travelled in central Africa as one of the delegates to foreign missions of the United Free Church general assembly, having published in 1913 <span class="italic">On the Trail of the Pioneers: a Sketch of the Missions of the United Free Church of Scotland</span>. He published a booklet, <span class="italic">Forty Years in Darkest Africa: the Life of Dr Laws of Livingstonia</span>, in 1917 and two years later his second book, <span class="italic">Streams in the Desert: a Picture of Life in Livingstonia</span>. In 1917 he was inducted as minister of Newhills United Free Church, Bucksburn, Aberdeenshire. For several months during 1918 and 1919 he served with the YMCA in France, lecturing to British troops. During the 1920s he published three further books on overseas missions: <span class="italic">Missionary Heroes of Africa</span> (1922), <span class="italic">William Carey: Cobbler and Pioneer</span> (1924), and <span class="italic">The Scottish Churches' Work Abroad</span> (1927), and he contributed fifty-seven sermons and two general introductions to the <span class="italic">Speaker's Bible</span>.<br>
<br>The early 1930s saw the publication in the <span class="italic">Expository Times</span> of several articles on Christianity and science. This led to Morrison's invitation to deliver the Cunningham lectures at New College, University of Edinburgh, in 1936, a penetrating analysis of the relationship of, and the boundaries between, science and Christian faith. These were published later that year as <span class="italic">Christian Faith and the Science of To-Day</span>. In 1937 he produced a booklet for the Church of Scotland, <span class="italic">God and the Atom</span>, and in the same year received the degree of doctor of divinity from the University of Aberdeen. Morrison remained at Bucksburn until his retirement in 1942, when he moved to Edinburgh. He died there of heart failure on 2 January 1947, and was buried in the city's Morningside cemetery.<br>
