<span class="headword">Nicol,  Erskine</span>  (1825&#150;1904), <span class="occ">genre painter</span>, son of James Main Nicol, assistant to a wine merchant, and Margaret Alexander, was born in South Leith on 25 July 1825, the eldest of a family of five sons and one daughter. At an early age he was employed as a house painter in Leith but an interest in fine art led him also to enter the Trustees' Academy in Edinburgh in 1838. He studied there under Sir William Allan and Thomas Duncan, and in 1843 he progressed to the recently formed Royal Scottish Academy life school. While still a student he had his first painting, <span class="italic">Fruit</span>, accepted for a Royal Scottish Academy annual exhibition in 1841. Later, during the early 1840s (probably while he was attending the evening classes in the academy) he was appointed drawing master at Leith high school.<br>
<br>In 1846, having resigned from his teaching post, Nicol travelled to Dublin where he remained until about 1850. He found employment there both as a teacher and as a portrait painter. However, it was Nicol's keen observation of Irish everyday life and humour that fed his imagination and supplied the material for most of his painting for the rest of his career. While in Ireland he had the good fortune to find a patron in a Mr Armstrong of Rathmines; this enabled him to send two paintings back to Edinburgh for the 1849 and 1850 Royal Scottish Academy annual exhibitions, both of Irish subjects.<br>
<br>Nicol settled back in Edinburgh in 1850 and very quickly established his reputation. On 10 June 1851 he married Janet Watson; they had one son and a daughter before she died in 1863. In 1855 Nicol was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy and only four years later, in 1859, he became an academician. As well as being a successful exhibitor at the Royal Scottish Academy until 1885 Nicol also exhibited at the Royal Academy on a regular basis between 1851 and 1893. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1866. In common with many of his Scottish contemporaries with ambition, Nicol turned his attention from Scotland to London. In 1862 he first rented a studio in St John's Wood and from 1864 he lived at Clonave Villa, 24 Dawson Place, Pembridge Square, in Bayswater. On 20 April 1865 he married Margaret Mary (1831/2&#150;1919), daughter of Thomas Wood, a merchant; they had two sons and a daughter. In addition to his London base, Nicol also built himself a studio in Ireland, at Clonave, Deravaragh, in co. Westmeath. This enabled him to continue working closely with his preferred subject matter until ill health forced him to stop travelling over to Ireland. Instead, Nicol found an alternative studio in a disused church in Pitlochry in Perthshire: thus Scottish rural life became the focus of his attention, although by this time he was producing little actual work.<br>
<br>Erskine Nicol's art education in Edinburgh links him firmly to the tradition of David Wilkie and Scottish narrative painting. Rather than assimilating any artistic influences during his stay in Dublin, the importance of these years lay in his collection of subject matter. On his return to Scotland he immediately settled down to producing large numbers of Irish cottage scenes, many full of wit and even caricature. From <span class="italic">Paddy's Toilet</span> (exh. Royal Scottish Academy 1851) to <span class="italic">The Day after the Fair</span> (1860; Royal Scottish Academy) even the titles demonstrate his comic presentation of the rural poor, ironically just a few years after the devastating effects of the Irish potato famine. Nicol's Royal Scottish Academy diploma work, for example&#151;<span class="italic">The Day after the Fair</span>&#151;presents a cottage interior in which the head of the household sits bandaged and suffering from a hangover while his less than stoical wife prepares him a cup of tea. This painting combines the delicate qualities of light and shadow with the sharply drawn characters in the subject; extraneous detail is kept to a minimum. A slightly later work, <span class="italic">The Rent Day: Signing the New Lease</span> (1868; Leicester City Museums), recalls very closely Wilkie's <span class="italic">The Letter of Introduction</span> (1813; National Gallery of Scotland) both in the arrangement of the figures and their setting. Nicol's work may also be compared with that of Thomas Faed, but whereas Faed's painting tends to be highly finished and somewhat sentimental, Nicol's brushwork remains direct and although he treats his subject with gentle humour he does not idealize it. In his later paintings, Nicol turned to more serious subjects and, in common with many of his Scottish contemporaries such as Thomas Faed and William McTaggart, explored such themes as immigration, emigration, and shipwreck as for example in <span class="italic">The Missing Boat</span> (1876; Royal Holloway College).<br>
<br>Despite the humour of many of Nicol's paintings he was a serious, shy, and reserved man. A photograph of about 1859 (Royal Scottish Academy) presents him in a thoughtful pose, his face partially hidden behind a thick, black beard. In 1885, after a serious illness, Nicol officially retired; he moved out of London to The Dell in Feltham, Middlesex. He also had a Scottish home, Torduff House in Colinton, then a village on the outskirts of Edinburgh. On 8 March 1904 Erskine Nicol died at The Dell; he was buried at Rottingdean in Sussex.<br>
