<span class="headword">Brown,  Thomas</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1180), <span class="occ">officer of the exchequer</span>, was possibly one of the Brown family, members of which had served as officials for Henry I. After that king's death, like others of his countrymen, Brown went to Norman Sicily. In two royal charters of Roger II, king of Sicily (1130&#150;54), dated 1143 and 1147, he appears in a prominent position as <i>magister</i> Thomas. He may also have been both <i>capellanus regis</i> (&#145;king's chaplain&#146;) and datary of royal documents, although only spurious documents now survive as evidence for his tenure of these offices, so no precise dating can be given; it was probably while Robert of Selby, his fellow countryman, was Sicilian royal chancellor in 1139&#150;52. That he was already <i>magister</i> in Sicily suggests some experience and seniority before his exile. The death of Selby in 1152 and the rise of Maio di Bari to be all-powerful minister under Roger II's son and successor, William I (1154&#150;66), probably clouded Brown's prospects of further advancement. Richard fitz Nigel, the bishop of London, who knew him well, says in the <span class="italic">Dialogus de Scaccario</span> that he had held a high place in the councils of the king of Sicily until &#145;a king arose who knew him not&#146;; eventually, therefore, in response to repeated invitations from Henry II, Brown returned to England.<br>
<br>For two years from 1157 Brown's nephew Ralph was paid as a royal clerk at the rate of 4<i>d</i>. a day; Thomas Brown himself received &pound;42 14<i>s</i>. from the king in 1160 and an annual stipend of &pound;7 12<i>s</i>. 1<i>d</i>. (5<i>d</i>. a day) for the next twenty years while he held an important position in the royal exchequer. The king was so confident of his loyalty and discretion that Brown was made responsible for keeping a special roll on which he recorded the laws of the realm and the <i>secreta</i> of the king. It has been supposed that there was a deliberate word play here on the Greek word <i>secreton</i>, used of the Sicilian financial office, but there is no evidence for Brown's employment in Sicily on the financial affairs of the crown&#151;a consideration that removes the principal reason for believing in the reciprocal influence of the Sicilian and English royal financial institutions. Although Madox conjectured that the special duties assigned to Brown were the basis of the later office of chancellor of the exchequer, Poole argued that his functions were more like those of the thirteenth-century remembrancers. Between 1164 and 1175 he was also described as the king's almoner, and during this period he has been credited with the responsibility for revising the <span class="roman">Domesday</span> information about Herefordshire, the county from whose farm his stipend was drawn. He had property of his own in both Hereford and Winchester. He died after Easter in 1180.<br>
