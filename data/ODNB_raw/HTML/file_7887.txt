<span class="headword">Douglas,  George</span>, fourth Lord Mordington  (<em>d.</em> 1741), <span class="occ">political writer</span>, was the only son of James Douglas, third Lord Mordington (1651&#150;1706?), and his wife, Jean Seton (<i>b</i>. 1651), eldest daughter of Alexander Seton, first Viscount Kingston. On 16 November 1704 he married Mary Dillon (<i>d</i>. in or after 1745). He was imprisoned for debt at Newgate on 22 April 1706, and abandoned his wife soon after. On 1 April 1715, while his wife still lived, he went through a form of marriage with Catherine (<i>d</i>. 1741), daughter of Robert Lauder, rector of Shenty, Hertfordshire. She styled herself Lady Mordington; they had one son, Charles, and two daughters, Mary and Campbellina.<br>
<br>Mordington's principal political study was <span class="italic">The Great Blessing of a Monarchical Government</span> (1724), a rambling work of patriotic and anti-Catholic sentiment which he dedicated to George I. In the preface he wrote of his not being &#145;insensible that what I sent into the world at two different times about three years since, occasioned by a weekly paper called &#147;<span class="roman">the Independent Whig</span>&#148;, created me some enemies&#146;, referring to two tracts: <span class="italic">Aminadab, or, The Quaker vision: a satirical tract in defence of Dr Sacheverell's sermon before the lord mayor</span>, which was answered anonymously in <span class="italic">The Tory Quaker</span>; and <span class="italic">A Letter from Lord Mordington to the Lord Archbishop of York</span> (1721).<br>
<br>Mordington died in Covent Garden, London, on 13 May 1741 and was buried at Paddington, Middlesex. He was survived by both Catherine Lauder, who died on 3 June of the same year, and his estranged wife. His son, Charles, did not assume the title in 1741, having no landed property. He was imprisoned in December 1745, first at Preston and later at Carlisle, for his supposed Jacobite sympathies. He then pleaded his peerage, and the trial was postponed. However, he was still in Carlisle gaol in 1750 and may have remained there until his death in 1755. His sister Mary, who was married to William Weaver, an officer of the Horse Guards, then assumed the title of Mordington; but she died childless, and it finally lapsed in July 1791.<br>
