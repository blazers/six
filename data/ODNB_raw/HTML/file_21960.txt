<span class="headword">Percy,  William  de</span>  (<em>d.</em> 1096<span class="mult">x</span>9), <span class="occ">baron and administrator</span>, probably took his name from Percy-en-Auge, Calvados, Normandy. According to the cartulary of Whitby Abbey, he bore the nickname of Asgernuns or Ohtlesgernuns, which may have been in allusion to his moustaches. An untrustworthy late memorandum in the Whitby cartulary claims that William de Percy came to England with Hugh d'Avranches, earl of Chester, and William the Conqueror in 1067. This may have been an invention to support the charter which the Whitby monks had concocted in his name, supposedly giving them the churches of Whitby and Flamborough. It is unlikely that Percy was originally Hugh's man or that he came to England in his company, but in 1086 he was the tenant of Earl Hugh at Whitby and Sneaton, Yorkshire. In Percy's foundation charter for Whitby Abbey, Earl Hugh was described as Percy's lord.<br>
<br>William de Percy was with the Conqueror on his expedition to Scotland in August 1072, and after his return he superintended the rebuilding of the castle at York under the direction of Hugh fitz Baldric, the sheriff. Soon after 1077 Percy endowed the community of St Peter and St Hilda at Whitby, which had been newly re-established by the hermit Reinfrid, one time monk of Evesham. Shortly afterwards there was a schism within the community, the reasons for which are unknown. Abbot Stephen (<i>d</i>. <i>c</i>.1112) and the main body of the convent moved to Lastingham, part of the royal demesne. Prior Reinfrid and the remainder of the Whitby monks later moved to Hackness, with Percy's consent, in order to escape from the assaults of robbers and pirates. It appears that Percy attempted to recover his donations from Abbot Stephen and return them to Reinfrid, whom he had first sponsored at Whitby. The monks went back to Whitby, possibly by <i>c</i>.1090 and certainly before 1096 when Percy issued a charter confirming them in considerable possessions. William Rufus granted and confirmed various privileges and the church of Allsaints, Fishergate, York, to Prior Reinfrid and the monks at Whitby and later liberties, the church of Hackness, and various lands to Percy's brother, Prior Serlo de Percy.<br>
<br>In 1086 William de Percy was a tenant-in-chief in Yorkshire (where he held the bulk of his lands), in Lindsey, in Nottinghamshire, and in Hampshire. The lands he held as tenant-in-chief in Yorkshire were worth approximately &pound;64 19<i>s</i>. <span class="roman">Domesday Book</span> also records that he was a tenant of the bishop of Durham at Scorbrough, Yorkshire, and in several other locations in the county. Percy's son Alan was to come into conflict with the bishop over holdings at Lund, Holme on the Wold, and Welton in the reign of William Rufus. William de Percy also possessed property in the city of York and the church of St Mary, Castlegate. He was present when William the Conqueror heard a plea relating to the property of the abbey of F&eacute;camp <i>c</i>.1086, and he later witnessed charters of William Rufus in the period 1091&#150;5. He is known to have built castles at Topcliffe, Spofforth, Sneaton, and Hackness, in Yorkshire.<br>
<br>William de Percy married Emma de Port, a kinswoman of Hugh de Port of Basing, and the marriage brought Hambledon, Hampshire, to the Percy family. Emma herself was a benefactor of Whitby, granting to the abbey lands in Cambridgeshire which had formed part of her dowry; she survived her husband. William de Percy went on the first crusade, in 1096, and died in Palestine, where he was buried. He was succeeded by his son and heir, Alan de Percy (<i>d</i>. 1130&times;36). His other sons were: Walter; William, who may be identical with a certain William de Percy, canon of York; and Richard of Dunsley, who patronized the family foundation at Whitby with his eldest brother. In 1166 William de Percy's grandson and namesake, another William, answered for twenty-eight knights' fees of the old enfeoffment and just over eight fees of the new enfeoffment. Percy's brother Serlo was prior of Whitby Abbey and his nephew William de Percy was later the abbot of the house in the reign of Henry I. Picot de Percy, a Yorkshire tenant of William de Percy in 1086 who witnessed a number of Whitby charters, was probably closely related to William. Another likely kinsman was Ernald de Percy, a tenant of Robert de Brus, who witnessed William's charter for Whitby <i>c</i>.1090&#150;96.<br>
