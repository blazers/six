<span class="headword">Stewart,  Patrick</span>  (1832&#150;1865), <span class="occ">army officer</span>, second son of James Stewart (<i>d</i>. 19 Sept 1877) of Cairnsmore, Kirkcudbrightshire, and of his wife, Elizabeth (<i>d</i>. 18 April 1872), only daughter of Dr Gilbert Macleod of the East India Company, was born at Cairnsmore on 28 January 1832. He was educated at Dr Cowan's school, The Grange, Sunderland, and at Perry Hill, Sydenham, and entered the East India Company's military college, Addiscombe College, in August 1848. He passed out at the head of his term and won the Pollock medal. He was commissioned second lieutenant in the Bengal Engineers on 14 June 1850. His further commissions were: lieutenant (1 August 1854), second captain (27 August 1858), and brevet major (28 August 1858).<br>
<br>After the usual course at Chatham, Stewart arrived at Calcutta on 13 October 1852. In May 1853 he was appointed acting superintendent of electric telegraphs during the absence of Dr William Brooke O'Shaughnessy in Europe. The establishment of telegraphs in India had just begun, and Stewart's work was the construction of lines from Calcutta to Lahore and from Agra to Indore, some 1700 miles. The energy and rapidity with which he carried it on won great praise. In November 1853 he took up the duty of aide-de-camp to the lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces. An ardent sportsman, he had ample opportunities for hunting, and experienced many accidents. Lady Canning observed on the occasion of one of his frequent visits to Calcutta: &#145;We have had Lady Selkirk's friend of the electric telegraph here&#151;Lieutenant P. Stewart. He has been mauled by a tiger, hugged by a bear, kicked off by wild asses, and lately had the cholera.&#146;<br>
<br>From January 1854 to July 1856 Stewart was employed in the Punjab on public works. He then again officiated as head of the telegraph department, and was in Ceylon on telegraph business when the mutiny caused him to hasten back to Calcutta. Calling at Madras on 9 June 1857, he found that most important messages for the governor-general had arrived there from the Punjab and the North-Western Provinces, the line having been cut at Cawnpore. These he took with him by sea to Calcutta, and on his own responsibility ordered the immediate commencement of a coast telegraph line from Madras to Calcutta.<br>
<br>From Calcutta, Stewart went on 18 June to Benares and Allahabad, and lent valuable assistance to Colonel John Neill. With 200 Sikhs and some irregular cavalry he crossed the Ganges and destroyed a rebel stronghold on 25 June, inspected the telegraph line accompanying Major Renaud's force, and returned to Calcutta on 9 July to hurry on the new coast line. A few weeks later he was again at Benares constructing, with the assistance of Lieutenant Limond RE, and many thousand Indian workmen, a fortified position at the Raj Ghat, which he had himself suggested to Lord Canning. In six weeks a position was fortified capable of holding 5000 men if necessary, but easily defended by 500. Guns and stores were placed in it, and Benares was made secure. This done, he was back in Calcutta in the middle of September on telegraph duty.<br>
<br>Stewart accompanied Windham's force in October for more than 300 miles, and went on in advance to arrange for transport. On 2 November he was with Sir Colin Campbell at Allahabad. He was attached to the headquarters staff during the relief of Lucknow, and was mentioned in dispatches. He accompanied Sir Colin to Cawnpore, and took part in the battle of 6 December 1857 and in the pursuit of the Gwalior contingent. On 8 December he returned to Calcutta on urgent telegraph duties, and gave Lord Canning a detailed account of the relief of Lucknow.<br>
<br>On 18 January 1858 O'Shaughnessy, who had returned to India, highly praised Stewart's services during his absence and recommended him for some substantial reward. Despite bad health Stewart accompanied Canning to Allahabad at the end of January. He was then deputy superintendent of telegraphs, but was attached to the staff of the commander-in-chief in India and given charge of the <span class="italic">Times</span> correspondent, William Howard Russell, who wrote that Stewart's duty was to put the end of the telegraph wire into Sir Colin's hand wherever he went. No sooner were headquarters established than the post and the wire were established also. It was the first time that the telegraph had been made to keep pace with the advance of an army in the field, and Stewart had many a narrow escape from the enemy's cavalry. He was honourably mentioned in the governor-general's order of 5 April 1858 for his services at the siege and capture of Lucknow, and received a brevet majority.<br>
<br>Ill-health compelled Stewart to return home. In 1859 he was employed in various scientific enquiries in connection with telegraph cables. He married in August 1860 Jane (<i>d</i>. 28 Dec 1895), daughter of Colonel McDouall of Logan, Wigtownshire; they had no children. He returned to India at the end of the year. In the following year he was employed on a commission to ascertain the cause of the great mortality from cholera, and visited many parts of the country. The report of the commission was rendered in January 1862.<br>
<br>In February 1862 Stewart was sent to Persia in connection with the construction of a proposed telegraph through that country. In June sickness compelled him to leave Tehran, and he went home through Russia. In England he was entrusted with the completion of the arrangements for the Persian Gulf cable. In November 1863 he went to Bombay as director-general of the government Indo-European telegraph, laid the cable from Gwadar to Fao, returned to Bombay, and in August 1864 went to Constantinople and made successful arrangements with the Turkish government. For these services he was made CB. His achievements were described in Sir Frederick Goldsmid's <span class="italic">Telegraph and Travel</span> (1874), which contained a memoir of his life. He died at Misseri's Hotel, Constantinople, on 16 January 1865, and was buried the following day at the Scutari cemetery. His wife survived him.<br>
