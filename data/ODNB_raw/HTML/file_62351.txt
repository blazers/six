<span class="headword">Davies,  James</span> <span class="st"> [<em>known as </em>Kitchener Davies]</span>  (1902&#150;1952), <span class="occ">Welsh-language writer</span>, was born on 16 June 1902 in Pant Afallen, Cardiganshire, the third son of Thomas Davies, smallholder and miner, and his first wife, Martha, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Davies. About a year later, the family moved the short distance to the smallholding of Y Llain, Llwynpiod, where a fourth child, Laetitia, was born.<br>
<br>Situated on the edge of the Red Bog of Tregaron, the poor soil of Y Llain was insufficient to support the family, and Thomas Davies followed the established pattern of moving to work as a miner at Nantgarw, returning home at intervals to work on the smallholding. The death of Martha Davies split the family for the first time when James was seven, and he was sent to stay for a year with an aunt in Banbury until Mary Davies, their mother's sister, came to Y Llain to keep house for the family. That traumatic experience developed a precocious self-consciousness in the seven-year-old which fundamentally affected his later development. From Y Llain he travelled the short distance to the church school in Tregaron, and later to the county school, where he came under the influence of the charismatic history teacher S. M. Powell. In the county school he acquired the nickname Kitchener, because of a supposed resemblance between his father and the field marshal. The name stuck, and even appears on his death certificate, although he never assumed it legally; it is as Kitchener that he continues to be known, in preference to his baptismal name.<br>
<br>Two years before Davies left the county school to go as a pupil teacher to Blaengwynfi, his father sold Y Llain and moved to Blaengarw, where he married the woman with whom he had been lodging. Davies later referred to this event as the second great sadness of his life, the third coming when he learned that Mary Davies, his &#145;aunt/mother&#146;, who had moved to Tonypandy when the family split up, was dying of cancer. After taking a general arts degree and training as a teacher in Aberystwyth between 1922 and 1925 Davies established himself as a teacher in the Rhondda valley, where he spent the rest of an active life. On 15 April 1940 he married Mair Irene Rees (1911&#150;1990) of Ffos-y-Ffin, Cardiganshire, the daughter of Evan Rees, schoolmaster. They had three children: Megan, Mari, and Manon.<br>
<br>In the Rhondda Davies was active as a political campaigner on behalf of Plaid Cymru, and threw his weight behind the movement to establish Welsh-medium education in an area where the language was under the severest pressure. He stood for election to the county council and for parliament (1945 and 1950), and was active within the party. He was a member of the Calvinist Methodist chapel, Bethania, in Tonypandy, and was an active lay preacher. He also wrote regularly for the periodical press, and broadcast on literary and cultural topics.<br>
<br>In spite of all of this, however, it is for his poetical and dramatic work that Davies is now chiefly remembered. In 1934&#150;5 he achieved notoriety as the author of a naturalistic play, <span class="italic">Cwm Glo</span> (&#145;Coal valley&#146;), originally entitled <span class="italic">Adar y to</span> (&#145;Sparrows&#146;), which investigated the relationship between social conditions, manners, and morals in the coal-mining valleys of the south with a frankness and honesty quite unparalleled in Welsh literature up to that time. Other less important poetic and dramatic works followed, but his next major achievement was the poetic drama <span class="italic">Meini gwagedd</span> (&#145;Stones of emptiness&#146;), whose title echoes a phrase in <span class="roman">Isaiah</span> 34: 11. The inspiration for his final and greatest work was his experience of the cancer which killed him. While in hospital recovering from an operation he dictated to his wife his introspective radio poem <span class="italic">S&#373;n y gwynt sy'n chwythu</span> (&#145;The sound of the wind which blows&#146;), again of biblical inspiration. In all of these works Davies brought a sharply critical consciousness to bear on his own formative experiences and on the myths central to Welsh culture. His work was simultaneously critical, revisionary, and constructive, and although he wrote comparatively little, he has a clear claim to being one of the most important Welsh writers in the twentieth century.<br>
<br>Davies died of cancer at his home, Aeron, Brithweunydd Road, Trealaw, Glamorgan, on 25 August 1952, and was buried at Llethr Du, Trealaw. He was survived by his wife and three daughters. On 3 September 1977 a plaque in his memory was placed on the wall of Llwynpiod Calvinist Methodist Chapel. His widow published a volume of his works in 1980, but many of his papers were destroyed in a fire in her home in Llangwyryfon, Cardiganshire, in 1990, in which she also died.<br>
